&gt;As a horde I wish you alliance had more anti horde banter to throw our way.  You're all too nice to me.

My Mother raised me to not make fun of mentally disabled people.

---
Maybe it’s consistent post 1.9 when it was added to the DR list? Nope has to be a bug though right?
---
Should’ve been a Tauren hitting another Tauren.
---
You know Old Ironforge was a thing that got scrapped right? Afaik it was intended to be an Alliance RFC equivalent. You used to be able to sneak in there through the doors/walls near Magni earlier on in vanilla.
---
Majority of people are still bad, especially the ones that will be coming from trophy handouts retail
---
&gt; Patch 1.7
---
&gt;
---
&gt; Freezing Trap now shares the same duration in pvp as other long-duration forms of crowd control (ie: polymorph, fear, sap).
---
What about Fear and Sap?
---
Do literally all of these CCs share DR with each other? What does a 4s Disorient have in common with a 20s long Fear?
---
Swear words evolve. Fuck shit damn is way more casual today than it was 50 years ago. 50 years ago they had profanity the new generation didnt care about as well. Its all dumb.
---
could very well be a different cd for each of them. 2 minute trigger for xp, 10 for looting any random flower, 30 minutes for looting a chest, 2 hours for looting a black lotus or other high level flowers, etc.
---
And what's the problem? 
---
The majority of the community clearly showed that it wants old mechanics in the spell batching discussion, even if their sole use was compensation for bad internet connection. 
---
And Blizzard actually did listen and you got what you wanted.
---
I'm excited to rush to 60 instead of taking months like I did when the game first.
---
I worked in a fraud control department for 11 years. I considered it. What rmt solution do you think blizz could implement? I already told you that I prefer a black market due to it having consequences on paper, so that's not anything new.
---
Go Dwarf. Dwarves look cool as engineers, and stoneform is great in tons of situations, particularly PvP. 
---
The secret for Dwarf of course is that find treasure finds lockboxes, which makes levelling lockpicking a breeze and can get you an extra bit of money too.
---
How about exacting so e sort of penalty from players who abuse it? Fuck all the assholes who will take advantage and ruin the economics of the game before it has a chance to get going. Those assholes are toxic. Use layering as a means to find and dispose of them. Then when it is no longer needed get rid of it and perhaps invite said offenders back.
---
It seems to be variable (like suggested in the video). It also seems to accumulate every time you make a layer hop, making it harder to chain-hop. Definitely feels much harder/more confusing to exploit. I'll keep testing tho to make sure i understand it more.
---
I'm convinced.
---
Put on the dress bish.
---
This was substantially funnier than it had any right to be.
---
Good god ... lol
---
&gt; but then didn't like the result and added it to the tbc changes. So I expected it to be that way for classic.
---
Yeah but if we'll go there there's lots of things to change, not just scatter/trap.
---
TBC fixed lots of things in classes. It was my favorite expansion. But that doesn't mean I think that TBC balance changes should be applied to classic.
---
You're breathtaking.
---
Go M Dwarf hunter. Be the cinematic dude.
---
Alliance: Dwarf for both PvE and PvP
---
Horde: Troll for PvE and Undead for PvP
---
Taurens affinity for the earth and clan structure made them far more suitable to be Shamans. There were no Tauren Shamans in WC3 either, but taurens is an example where giving Taurens Shamans made complete sense.
---
But Druids are an entirely different matter. Druid is even more exclusive exclusive than Paladin by design--Paladins were invented in the Second War, an implementation of the idea of war-priests. So it's actually quite reasonable to assume that any race that has priests can field Paladins.
---
Druids though practice their magic through communication with spirits, these secret techniques were taught to them directly by **a demigod**, it's not an art you can 'discover' yourself. Taurens **could not** have had Druids during WC3, where were their demigod masters when the Centaurs were killing them all?
---
So the only explanation for Tauren Druids existing is... the night elves taught them. And that's the lore explanation IIRC. It's kind of a headscratcher exactly though why would the fiercely racist and internal-focused night elves would ever do that before WC3, and why in the world would they do so after WC3 when the taurens are their enemies?
---
Like 70 percent of people havent internalized the philosophy of this kinda stuff. They just live on reaction til then. Just like you and i havent thought about something else and we havent fully understood whats going on.
---
i was trying to find that damn shortcut the other night and couldnt. I knew it was there though!
---
Yeah sure.
---
The shared DR between trap and Scatter happened in April 2006 (1.10). 1 year and a half after US release.
---
The weapon normalisation is 1.8 (october 2005), nerf on crit was 1.7 (september 2005)
---
If you were in a raiding guild (like me :) ) which cleared BWL early and had access to Ashjre'thul xbow, you would know you could crit above 3k constantly. 
---
In addition you could trap 3 players at a time because there was no heartbeat mechanic and trap lasted full duration and obviously no diminushing return with scatter shot :=) trap couldn't not be seen by any players except rogues swirly balls (google that) and they had a larger radius of activation.
---
I could add there was no CD on counter attack during this era aswell.
---
So wearing mail, One/2 shooting casters at 41 yards, many (better) tools to leave melee range. 
---
Hunter got nerfed down patch after patch, i don't care but don't spout nonsense when you clearly didn't play during this period of time.
---
The main issue I had with TBC was giving Paladin/Shaman to both sides. I hated this. It was the first step towards this type of "balancing" that has led us to the current state of the game - no talant trees and homogenized classes/builds.
---
Better question, should classic wow break the tmorph fixes for the True Authentic Classic Experience (®) ?  A whole lot of people were using it even back then, and it ended up being an "don't ask, don't tell" kind of situation with Blizzard.  
---
\&amp;nbsp;  
---
Even better:  remove the fix, but have it still be a bannable offense.    Everyone's equally (un)happy.
---
J’avais jamais fait le rapprochement... j’avoue on a l’air con !
---
DumbleDwarf - priest
---
If that's what you think, you're welcome to believe so.
---
It's also worth mentioning you're actually wrong about Patch 1.7. On a better reading, there's no mention of DR in Patch 1.7. At all.
---
* Freezing Trap now shares the **same duration** in pvp as other long-duration forms of crowd control (ie: polymorph, fear, sap). 
---
I misread it because I assumed you were correct. 
---
You were not, and so now one mystery is solved. But the unspecific wording of Patch 1.9 is still an issue, as it doesn't actually indicate anything about DR *tables*, just DR itself.
---
Hence, it's inconsistent behavior is still unaccounted for.
---
Big difference between passionate GMs and leadership at blizz. I hope they can stay separate.
---
No.
---
There was a timed automatic completion. Otherwise it would have taken years to open on smaller realms.

Just stick with BfA, you’ll be fine.

Yes but it’s « baguette magique », as « magic wand ».
---
&gt; You don’t get layered randomly
---
I never said you did. 
---
When I said " Who knows when/if/why your friends/guildies might get "Layered" to another shard randomly," it was meaning that, when you're in a group, and leave the group, that you'd suddenly disappear from their world, and you from theirs. Or, if you're questing with someone, and invite someone else, then the other people around you would disappear, etc. I guess "random" wasn't the correct word. 
---
&gt; you invite them they hop a layer and then you disband and make a new group with different people on a different layer who also are on CD and can’t join
---
Exactly...
---
The blue post regarding batching talked about one of the simplest form of batching, being two mages who start casting polymorphs on each other near simultaneously and thus polying each other. Or a spell interrupt landing at the same time spell finishes casting and both spells still going off. I agree with you - on these examples spell batching does not increase the skill cap. Those occurences can be "common", but there's a plethora of other effects of batching that are not common. Most rogues going into classic will NEVER vanish an instant cast non-projectile CC, by accident or by skill. To the top PVPers this can however be a daily occurence. If a specific play is only common or somewhat reliable to top level players but will never happen with most players it probably is because the play requires skill to pull off.
---
You are still sidestepping my question about predictively vanishing blind/cheap shot. Your argument about you being slower and still being able to perform an action fundamentally does not work with this example. Without batching this play is not possible. It has nothing to do with you being slower or faster than the other player. In a scenario without batching even if you are the faster player there's nothing you can do, and the best player would get hit by the cheap shot or blind just the same as the worst player.
---
I am also unsure why you are repeating this "let's increase batching to 1-5 seconds" either. It was literally the first thing I agreed with you on.
---
DM won't be out at launch.
---
Bad philosophy to have tbh, if all the pvpers go horde 1. there will be abysmal queue times and it'll be harder to rank in general 2. Alliance premades are actually better in vanilla because of paladins but a lot of new players won't realize that till its too late ;)
---
you're only getting classic because of pservers, based retard
---
I agree. If it was intended as a balance change, then fixing it opens the door to all the other TBC balance changes. I think unless someone can show without a doubt that it was a bug, then it shouldn't be changed. Even then, I would be fine with keeping it in. It is how I remember hunter pvp
---
Stoneskin is broken and perception is nice I think you're meant to say. If you can see me first, but I can immune all your shit for as long as a fight lasts, have at me.
---
This one loses. You were suppose to complain about the complainer, not join him.
---
If by “majority” you mean “vocal minority”.
---
To be fair it made Alliance ridiculously OP in vanilla PVE. Imagine TBC if Bloodlust was Horde-exclusive. :p
---
Got so excited when I logged in today and saw Wow classic pop up. I never got an e-mail or anything though and I'm not currently subbed, so its most likely a mistake? Or would I get access If I subscribe?
---
I'm not sidestepping. I'm agreeing without batching it wouldn't be possible, and the reason it wouldn't be possible is because someone either vanished first or cheap shorted first but the came **forcibly** causes both to resolve at the same time.
---
It has absolutely fucking everything to do with faster or slower, because that's the part that batching ignores aslong as it's in the same window.
---
It's so simple to understand that if you give someone a window to react even though they were slower, that's not increasing skill. It's literally allowing you to do something you should not be able to do.
---
It gets me excited to think about if Blizzard would occasionally release time limited servers for the purpose of speed levelling. Probably not though.
---
It’s a bug. It would be wow beta 7 if you had beta.
---
This was the stress test client that is now closed.
---
Thanks, appreciate the clarification - definitely felt like I was missing some key info. Glhf come classic friend
---
I don't know about all of this nonsense posted here.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The plot of Vanilla was The Battle for Hillsbrad.  
---
The Horde of Tarren Mill fought the Alliance from Southshore repeatedly, mostly over the rights to farm and hunt yetis.  Initially the Alliance do well and drive the Horde back to Tarren Mill, only to be reminded they are called the Horde for a reason.  Horde reinforcements come in twice as many and twice as fast and quickly the Alliance is forced to abandon Southshore before the last of the griffons die and leave them stranded.
---
Veterans of those battles fought again in the jungles of Stranglethorn Vale, largely over hunting and fishing rights.
---
Alliance just looking for a relaxing safari and some quality time with good ole Hemet Nesingwary are constantly ambushed by Horde hunters and rogues.  They organize a valiant defense that again becomes quickly overwhelmed by the sheer number of horde reinforcements.
---
The Alliance, realizing they cannot match the horde's ability to swarm towards conflict, lures the horde into meaningless and endless conflicts in Ashenvale, Arathi Highlands, and Alterac Valley.  With the hordes numbers spread out and bogged down in these more structured battles, the Alliance is able to farm, hunt, and fish across Azeroth once more.
---
The Alliance prospers and forms mighty guilds of adventures that go on to take down the biggest threats to Azeroth while the Horde remain bogged down in pointless conflict chasing a dream of becoming a high warlord.
---
Reminds me of the good/bad old days when installing large games involved 2 hours of disc swapping.  The last time I did that was right after I picked up WOTLK from Gamestop at midnight.
---
Nowadays we just click a button and wait for the download &amp; install to finish, just like magic.  Major QoL upgrade to be sure, but sometimes I still miss those disc-swapping days.
---
Aight, I'll take that as you got nothing else to say.  
---
It's quite funny though because I think it's because you're starting to realize that none of that crap you said makes any sense.
---
From what I’ve seen in the streams it has the quest helper from retail wow. Unless everyone has quest helper which would be weird since it’s a dead add on that hasn’t been relevant for several expansions.
---
I played Nost pre shutdown and played pserver back when they sucked dong. I know why we’re getting classic and it’s not just cause of pservers it’s cause people have been asking for years.
---
Let me guess you think Nost is the only reason we’re getting it? Cute.
---
Honestly I think everyone is overreacting. Not about the mechanic but the idea that blizzard won’t fix it. They will 100% fix it
---
Ok hold up. Just **hold** *up*. There is absolutely no way that 10-20% of players in vanilla were doing this. There is absolutely no way that 80% of players will be doing this in classic. 
---
Only ~10% of people even play hunters in total so that's the top end.
---
I'm going to go ahead and assume that 90% of hunters can't even pull it off, so that makes 1% of players the maximum that will be doing this. So your numbers are way off.
---
Lol I was gonna ask what that I win button was for
---
I feel like Priests are just so much better in vanilla
---
Resto goes oom really fast in pvp if you spam regrowth
---
You are more mobile but Priest can dispell offensively and defensively, provide shields etc
---
PVE healing output is stronger for priests und you use more spells i believe
---
anyways thats just my 2 cents
---
As a host to a Discord server of over a thousand wow roleplayers, I find that we generally match the opposite--everyone seems to be skin and bones.
---
I'm sorry, I can't really continue to engage with someone who starts a discussion with

&gt; the fuck did I just read?
---
After giving him numerous chances to actually talk to me in good faith.
---
I was trying to reach out to you in your own language. I guess I failed.
---
Yeah I realized that when you posted it the first time I read it as DR first.
---
 
---
Inconsistent as to what?
---
Pathfinder: Kingmaker
---
I agree, I don't play games for pixel upgrades but for the fun those upgrades can bring me. I always try to be the best I can be and thus I'll get my gear, get enchants, consumables and all the other stuff. But the endgame isn't the stuff, it's the fun. I would also happily pass on an upgrade if it's a bigger upgrade for someone else.
---
I really hope to find a nice guild to fit in. But I don't even know where to start looking.
---
In otherwords, Rngesus works in mysterious ways.
---
What about the wotlk graphics?
---
I already see all those #nochanges guys coming but first play classic again..
---
I honestly think its the best way, it sticks to the old one yet its an improvement. Most important improvement is that not ever Single player looks exactly the same.
---
Just take a second to realize that you got like 6 hairstyles and 3 of them were a thing in the early 2000s
---
So 99% dont roll these because they cant look at it.
---
Nochanges is good for mechanics.
---
Unique Classes
---
The slower but really rewarding system.
---
Funny thing is how they will be spamming #nochanges to something like that but layering is totally fine.
---
They took my hog... now I'mma take their LIVES
---
I would like to take an opportunity and thank Joana's guides found on [Joanas World](https://www.joanasworld.com/) I am a fan and while I dont follow the guide 100% and need to adapt, it has great information that helped me get started quickly.
---
Yes, in time release zones that will be catered to classic like Gilneas, Hyjal etc.
---
I really hope if classic takes off and maintains the player base, they will have a separate dedicated team that releases new never before seen content to classic
---
That fucking boar.
---
Nice
---
Yea but that is still potentially less hits than you would take if you stood still, right?
---
You think this would have been changed if people didn't complain about it for months straight?
---
Yk that moat of these zones were supposed to be in vanilla but they didnt have the ressources to realize them?
---
Hyjal was supposed to be a zone and raid as an example
---
I have absolutely no doubt there will be Oceanic servers.
---
&gt; Of course it is. You're talking about a live action game where one person can act first, but have the execution resolved simultaneously. That's objectively not fair, you're quite literally allowing the slower player advantages.
---
Nope. Any game where all players consent to the rules is by nature fair. It doesn't matter how stacked the game is in one player's favor, *everyone agreed to those rules when they chose to play the game*. Second, if you're entrusting the developers of any given game to define a "fair" tick rate for you, you literally don't even have an argument anymore because Blizzard thinks 400ms is fair.
---
You've shredded your own argument here. You're trying to present yourself as a pragmatist, but it's clear you just don't like the mechanical systems on display and want them changed.
---
I hope they will introduce a better bloodelf zone, such a lore behind it and it ended up in being a starting zone most would skip anyway.
---
My friends first priest on private servers was "Holymoly" a week ago. Hope he doesn't land the same server as you do. Nice name! :D
---
Greater Magic Baguette
---
Naxx is being pugged on Lightbringer.
---
I still don't get this. If you want retail stuff go play retail. Blizz said no changes. We all cheered. End of story!
---
Been a while since I've played Classic but yes to all of these. Nothing game breaking out of any of these, just makes the game less clunky.
---
Reposting exactly the same content is actually a violation of this subreddit rules.
---
This and Quel’thalas - these are the two zones i would want the most if they took the route of filling out the emoty zones. The city itself is so cool, it’s such a shame it has no use on live
---
I'm just going to assume you haven't actually thought out your logic
---
If you want a version without the 3D black bars, lemme know.
---
Batching isn't a rule you absolute numpty it was a restriction if the hardware at the time.
---
Honestly even if i got it to drop I'd sell it.
---
You forgot the most important fact.
---
They safe money by using as much capacity as needed.
---
When the greed for a few hundred dollars cost you a playerbase of thousands..
---
Thats what i call quick maths from your usual boss in 21 century
---
Pls dont spark any more discussions, thanks.
---
The epicly slow respawn time is the ultimate limiting reagent when it comes to farming. Just because you can loot faster doesn't mean mobs will respawn faster - which they certainly don't in Classic.
---
Why not get out of bed and look for a job?
---
I found it to be the perfect reading material for the porcelain throne.
---
I don't see how they are going to remove layering unless the populations drop drastically, they would end up with overpopulated servers. Either they need to not have layering from the start and just have server queues, or keep it forever. They are banking on most of the 'tourists' leaving by phase 2, however if the player base stays or actually increases layering is here for good.
---
I honestly can’t tell you because she’s actually my gf and some guys just copied my message.
---
I'm having the same conversation with two different people, so forgive me if I argue ahead of myself.
---
DRs function in DR categories like Stuns and Roots. Scatter Shot is a Disorient, and Freezing Trap is uncategorized until post-Vanilla. That is, it has no known category from any actual documentation. 
---
One would think it would be a Freeze (like the Freezing Band, which is explicitly a Freeze) or an Incapacitate (since it specifically "incapacitates" in the description like Sap does). In post-Vanilla sources, this is the case.
---
Whenever Blizzard add a DR, they explicitly mention the school. For example:
---
* Patch 1.9
---
* Improved Starfire - The stun effect's duration no longer diminishes or is diminished by controlled stun abilities and spells (e.g. Cheap Shot, Hammer of Justice, Charge etc.).
---
Whenever Blizzard add a DR that is inconsistent, they made explicit note of that inconsistency. For Scatter Shot:
---
* Mists of Pandaria Patch 5.3.0 (2013-05-21): Now shares diminishing returns with  [Freezing Trap] and  [Wyvern Sting]. 
---
Merges Disorient, Incap, and Sleep into one DR.
---
There's no such mention of DR categories in the 1.10 Freezing Trap patch note. It only mentions that it DRs, ie. It now suffers from diminishing returns with itself.
---
If Freezing Trap was a Disorient, then it ought to DR with other Disorient effects. But it doesn't behave like a Disorient at all (no wobble or head particle effects, nor is the debuff called "Disoriented" like others), and there's no mention of it being added to that category. 
---
Therefore, it is inconsistent. It's a bug at worst, and extraordinarily poorly conveyed intent at best.
---
&gt; I'm able to dislike retail as a whole and enjoy Classic while not being so delusional as to refuse to acknowledge that some things are better today
---
Read that part until you understand it. It's sad that you think I prefer retail to classic just because I'm saying anything remotely good about the former. You ought to try thinking a bit more critically
---
These sorts of QoL stuff, where as you say 95% of people will be using, should just be considered to be in the game. Not saying there should be on-screen prompts during raids like there currently is, obviously, but multi-mailing and autodismounts just reduce clunkiness. It's a decade old game, some good ideas came up between now and then, and it's okay to implement them.
---
It is, he mentions in his bio on Twitch that he played Hunter on Frostwolf.
---
My time would of been at least 1:55 if I wouldnt have done the last quest, but honestly i was a few quests over. I may have hit 1:50
---
Layering for months until phase 2 or even longer is infinitely more damaging to the vanilla experience than just sharding the starter zones for a week, which you stay in for maybe a few hours.
---
Silvermoon raid
---
If you leave a group on layer X you do not change layers, you’re bound to that layer now. You would hop a layer if you join a group on a different layer Y. With this ICD you would then have to wait or just invite them yourself and let them hop.
---
If the ICD is low enough you’re rarely ever going to run into a scenario where you joined a group, hopped, then left a group and tried to group with people who are both on another layer and on ICD. We don’t know how long the cooldown is but if it’s minutes it will almost never happen.
---
Generally yes, but not quite.
---
Vocal minority used words like "vanilla flavor" "nochanges" "tarnished meta" to gain massive support of not so well knowledgeable majority.
---
I'm just not convinced on AoE looting. You still need mobs to respawn, looting faster doesn't change that. Not sure how someone could say AoE looting is bad but guild bank is okay. Guild banks are such a big game changer.
---
After my only dwarf priest DCs a couple times I'm gonna at least -TRY stance dancing
---
We wouldn't get cool changes, we would get blizzard changes. Daily quests, mobile friendly content, 600 mounts to collect, tokens to hand in.
---
That was one of my favorite videos in vanilla days, seeing that paladin just straight charge in ay Kazzak like the man Leeroy Jenkins wanted to be
---
Only an idiot want to keep the old models.
---
nice blog
---
forced to take an uncontroversial upgrade.  You poor thing.
---
Wotlk pservers as always
---
It’s pretty obvious . People want updated graphics with the classic gameplay. Surly you understand that and aren’t actually this dense
---
So heroic strike takes up your ability to generate rage on your next swing... Wouldn't that mean that you also have worse rage generation when heroic striking with a slow weapon compared to a fast one?
---
ie
---
AA 10 damage gain rage
---
HS 21 damage spend 15 rage
---
You've generated rage on 31 points of damage compared to say:
---
AA 20 damage gain rage
---
HS 31 damage spend rage
---
Both instances have done the same amount of damage and assuming the second weapon is exactly half the speed over the same period of time, but you would generate less rage in the second instance.
---
Also wouldn't integer-only values only make a negative difference if they uniformly round down? Do we know that to be the case?
---
If Hitler said 1 + 1 = 2, would he be wrong because he's a racist?
---
If every person who intends to play Classic sat down and watched this video, and then you asked them if they wanted this mechanic, do you really think a majority would say yes?  I think most people would say no, that’s a stupid mechanic.
---
" if you stare long enough into the abyss the abyss stares back at you"
---
I enjoyed bo4 for a month or so then lost interest.
---
I didn’t believe that shit first time I saw it. Told my friend it was fake. Did the same thing with the 3 man ony video from  pre TBC patch.
---
$15 a month is the cheapest babysittter and anti-drug.
---
Server to server will vary more than faction to faction as a whole imo.  Its the same people playing the game in general, so some people are attracted to talents for min maxing pve or pvp, some just want a certain look, some want a certain 1-20 experience.  
---
I don’t think you could say “Alliance are more willing to help low level players” so much as you would say “On the Emerald Dream server, the alliance are more helpful to low level players than the horde are”.
---
Warlocks are really safe in world pvp. Sacrificing the voidwalker is a great defence against ganks. Affliction kills slowly, but I've seen destruction locks burst like mages for kills. There's also the triple succubus charm tactic for 1v1 scenarios.
---
Then again Trolls are heavily underrated shadow priests. Shadow guard can proc blackout, and hex of weakness stacks with similar effects.
---
Yup, it's not going to work. Still useful to keep a mob damage leashed tho
---
Lol at all the hunters in here trying to score themselves a buff. Get outta here.
---
I had debated on fury but ima have me a pocket priest so sweeping strikes seems the way to go, plus I’ll be avoiding execute so she can get the killing blows for the regen
---
I’ll prolly go fury ~50 since vanquishers and thrash blade are guaranteed and good 2h’s are random around that time
---
I want to enjoy WoW again. I was trying to force myself to.. 8.2 just seems eh.. Im so excited for Classic because everyone is starting from level 1.. When we load in there will be NOTHING on the AH.. that’s exciting. Im riding the hype train hard.
---
It’s not a bug, it was downloadable when stress test came out, and after that day they closed all their servers.
---
So it’s a bug it’s still up there today..
---
It depends on the mobs attack speed.
---
2 for 1 it good if you have a weapon speed thats more than twice the mobs attack speed.
---
You can in fact trade one for one if you ride the edge of the leeway radius. The only problem is you can't run through the mob without taking extra hits so I end up aggroing mobs because I need a ton of space to kite effectively.
---
I think there’s one more stress test coming and they’ll open the servers up again, it’s not a bug, the devs wanted it to be like that.
---
June 4, 2006, Northshire.  I for one am absolutely thrilled and am counting the days to Classic. I've been lucky enough to have played on the stress tests.  And those days from announcement to now, did the days in bewteen matter... yeah, they did actually.
---
Get rekt
---
I’d recommend putting a macro to dismount on charge unless you plan on using a hotkey for it. Many frustrations from jumping towards a mob and hitting charge - *You can’t do that while mounted* - then aggro the mob so charge isn’t even an option anymore
---
Hey Guys I just finished editing the rest of soloing Uldaman together. Hope you guys enjoy it! I want to thank you all for your previous support on the last video! So much love and support from this community. I hope i made you guys proud. Tried to give some tips in there on how to kill these bosses. Let me know what you think. Thank you again &lt;3
---
&gt; due to it having consequences on paper

Then you have no clue how human psychology works. If consequences on paper were a deterrent then the chinese gold farming black market would not have ballooned to be a multi-million dollar industry before the WoW Token killed them.
---
I seriously can't believe you worked in fraud control. Or you were just on customer service and not actually designing and implementing anti-fraud systems.
---
What if you find better guild now?
---
Yeah I’m considering messaging my main mvps from vanilla and bc as I’m still on steam and fb to most of them, but I feel like I’ll find a brand new group that is epically woke.
---
!remindme 2 months
---
There’s a good warrior video by Mizoto on YouTube for this topic.

I'm starting to think people really are that fucking obtuse and that this really is that hard for them to understand.
---
bUt MUh LayERiNg!!!!

Same

Second time was trying to get on top of khaz modan to the airfield, this jump at the beginning in loch modan sometimes sent you flying into the nether
---
Does leeway apply to npc combat as well? If so it needs to stay as it makes it harder to escape an npc that is chasing you.
---
Thank you. Priest seems like  a great choice but going oom after 1 kill does not seem fun, but then again what class doesn't in a hard fights.
---
I really hate these kinds of attitudes though. It's so undermining and indicative of how the community is complicit in incentivizing bad content.
---
So many raids were amazing, but because they didn't have the perfect, utopian 20/20 hindsight timing of release, the playerbase just trashed them and will never remember them fondly ever.
---
you missed the point lol
---
More than two less than four
---
Nothing. Nothing is fun. Maybe some re plays of other adventure games , the few that have struck me before or since.
---
They both have different forms of utility.  Paladin has more pvp utility where priest has more pve.
---
That sounds pretty cheap... 100 EU for epic mount...
---
&gt; You're still wrong, because Vanilla is not 1.12, 1.11, or a single patch. It should be changed because it's a bug and didn't work like that for most of Vanilla, and that's really all there is to it.
---
Just fucking admit it when you are wrong.  You are not getting "Vanilla", you are getting a close recreation of 1.12.  There is no amorphous "Vanilla" that somehow gives you the sum of every moment of Vanilla WoW.
---
this guy gets it.
---
Trolls cannot be druids so it would have to be hunter or warrior.  Troll hunters are great in pve and troll warriors are meh.
---
Exploits are getting fixed regardless of being in 1.12 or not.
---
cool.
---
How about bugs?
---
What do you mean no paragon boxes? Last time I played like 3 months ago I was getting box after exalted.
---
DR != duration
---
1. You should look up what exactly people have had to do to get to rank 14. The grind is insane.
---
2. Few people get 1 legendary let alone more. For some guilds the 'Eye of Sulfuras' took months to drop off Ragnaros. Some guilds are okay with giving it to PvP offspec if it doesn't drop until phase 2.
---
3. IF your going to put this much time into the game you'll obviously have an alt at lvl 60. A lot of people will have a warrior alt they raise after their main.
---
More players = more layers is wrong.
---
Layers just splits the amount of players.
---
Lets say there are 100 people. There are always 100 people. Having layers doesn't mean there are 200 people. What layering does is takes those 100 people and make them 4 x 25 people.
---
So the resources that should be shared and contested by 100 people are instead shared and contested by 25. There are now 4x as many resources. The layer hopping people, or more importantly, the hardcore levellers, will gobble up all the resources.
---
Players are the finite number in this equation. There will only ever be X amount of people to play. Layering doesn't make there be more people, it just splits what there is.
---
having shield block up pushed both cirt and glancing blow off the  [attack table](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_table). A mob couldn't land a crit or glancing blow on you. That link says 80 but that was the case at 60.  [This article](https://www.engadget.com/2007/03/24/attack-tables-and-you/)  also mentions that.
---
Hunters are amazing at world pvp as they can kill any class.  If you go night elf you can still have the stealth attack approach with shadowmeld.
---
thats kinda my point. We arent perfect moral beings. so why even pretend. im perfectly fine with that.
---
&gt;I want to do everything in Classic this time: rank 14, full raid clears, all the legendaries, max professions (secondary ones too).  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; Classic warriors are the embodiment of what the classic experience is to  me. You start as a weak nobody who seeks the help of others, but  eventually you become the powerhouse of the game and people start  running to their group when they see you in coming. 
---
I think these points decide it for you. You're aiming for the most extreme hardcore content ceiling the game can offer and that means warrior will be a much more gratifying class. Getting more spell damage just doesn't have the same power spike that getting a big badass-looking weapon does.
---
Yes, warrior gets kited and solo'd easily by mages and other classes with worse gear, but to achieve the things you're setting out to do you will not be soloing. Rank 14 requires a constant daily grind of BG premades where you ought to get pocket heals. Your willingness to tryhard (i.e. frost reflector, free action potions) will also significantly mitigate your kite-ability.
---
All these things would benefit you as a mage too, but not to the same extent.
---
Once the number 3, being the 3rd number be reached - then lobbeth thou thy holy hand grenade of Antioch towards thy foe. Who being naughty in my sight, shall snuff it!

Been playing ATLAS, it’s still kinda buggy and now the servers are dead, but I’m having fun building boats and sailing around!

Troll Warriors have the best threat generation iirc

November 23 2004 - US Release
---
February 11 2005 - EU Release
---
August 22 2006 - 1.12 Release
---
December 5 2006 - Pre-TBC Patch Release
---
So US had Vanilla for 106 weeks, EU had Vanilla for 94.5 weeks, and 1.12 lasted for 15 weeks.
---
1.12 is 14.15% of the US experience and 15.87% of the EU experience.
---
But even still, we're playing 1.12, so any bugs that existed in 1.12 should exist in Classic.
---
what do you think were talking about here?
---
Im debating that warsong1 will be crammed as fuck because a lot of people will start there and in order for people to go to warsong2/3 they would need to see a reason to go there, i.e. queues or "VERY HIGH" pop at warsong1. And in the following days there will be tons of people joining in after their friends/family, which will be on warsong1 by a large degree (because warsong1 has the most day1 players). All the day1 tryhards will be at warsong1, so minmax boys looking to join to the best PvE server are probably going to endure 3h+ queues aswell for that.
---
Honestly if you get a few levels ahead its not a big deal at all, and if you get too far ahead you can help level and make the dungeons he needs much easier.  Also if he has an extended break or quits you will facepalm for not playing when you had the time.
---
So we should just throw out any class changes made from 1.10 to 1.12 because they were "not in for most of vanilla"?
---
You're right, I updated the link thanks!
---
Everybody that's downvoting me is getting it wrong it wasn't my post I merely said that some idiot as the first post on Twitter already was negative about the fix that's what I meant
---
I want new models tbh. I like classic for the community and RPG aspects, not the graphics.
---
If you received a Beta invite without a subscription, you don't need a subscription to play the Beta.
---
More than likely, you did not receive a Beta invite.
---
Stuck between hunter and lock. 
---
I feel pretty across the basic pros and cons, so it's coming down to some real nitpicky stuff / straight class flavour. I'll be raiding regularly and have never been fussed about topping meters as long as I'm useful. 
---
How do Locks fare in pvp (all facets) in early gear? I understand hunters are strong as fresh 60s but how do Locks go in blues / tier 1 assuming everyone else is similarly geared? 
---
How do hunters fare in pvp during AQ when say most other classes are tier 2.5 / AQ geared and hunters are still running round in tier 2? 
---
How much does your ranged weapon affect you in pvp as a hunter? If you get unlucky with ashjrethul drops will you feel gimped?
---
Lastly, how do shards affect pvp in general, how often do you need to stop to go farm shards, if ever?
---
Sorry for all the questions lol
---
If they are not completely gamebreaking they will stay, unfortunately some bugs are getting fixed that shouldn't be.
---
The new bugs are a lot more concerning though.
---
Call me crazy, but I plan to level 1H&amp;Shield for most of time in WoW. Get Imp Revenge. One point in Imp Shieldblock. Grab both avoidances in Arms/Prot. Get Anger Mangement at 30-something. Roll Troll with Alchemy for Troll's Blood pots. Get some Spirit gear people have been talking 'bout. Slap a Shield Spike on and just out last everything. Shield Block up and get stuns. Might be slow but I won't die if I miss 3 times in a row.
---
Even the bugs that were not in the majority of Vanilla and were only "introduced" in 1.12 and were planned to be fixed with the release of  TBC? So now those bugs will exist for eternity?
---
Yes.
---
Unless you can click "Play" on "Beta: World of Warcraft Classic" under the "In Development" tab you do not have beta.
---
no, "people" dont want updated graphics.
---
literally, no changes. do you understand what "no" means?
---
Sorry, crush not crit.
---
So this month im on a mage and priest hype. 
---
Will be either;
---
undead, undead 
---
Or gnome, dwarf 
---
This all depends on my real life homies faction. 
---
Current plan is level one in under 2 weeks on first release and then the other casually with my wife when she wants to casually play. 
---
She likes hunter or warlock (might play druid but prefers to have pets then be the pet, her words). 
---
What should i roll first?
---
Im considering attempting to pug mc with all the fast boys on the server. Shouldnt be too hard.
---
Currently im leaning towards mage for that early rep farm for quintessences, gold making and just cruisy play style. 
---
I would like your thoughts and maybe anything i might be missing?
---
Id run it.
---
Yeah, as a horde player I always wanted to say we had it harder in every way just because alliance bases themselves have fewer ways to sneak in or for lvl 60 hunters to snipe you between holes in the walls, and because AV is so far slanted in alliance's favor it's ridiculous and beyond defending. But aside from that basically meaningless base design, and one battleground that basically makes it a level playing field, horde have better base position, better travel from zone to zone (durotar &gt; barrens &gt; stone talon &gt; hillsbrad &gt; 1k). Notice how Horde's "special" transportation has 3 destinations, zeppelins fly to UC, ORG, and STV. Alliance have the deeprun tram that takes you from the top of the same continent to the bottom, 
---
which means:
---
* wait for deeprun tram
---
* ride it
---
* fly to a boat from the main city the tram took you to
---
* land at the harbor and wait for a boat
---
* ride the boat to the other continent
---
* fly to your destination
---
Horde does this
---
* wait for zeppelin 
---
* when you arrive you run to a flight master in the city you landed and fly to your destination
---
3 steps so not only is it less micro intensive (you are afk on flight paths most of it) but it just takes less time overall.
---
What class? Are you leveling professions too? Two hours isn't bad at all, nice work.
---
What do you mean? Plenty of people do. You can disagree that’s fine but don’t pretend there aren’t people who want this.
---
For or against don’t be ignorant to facts
---
Professions in vanilla are not locked in.  Typically I find myself with mining / skinning until i get good amounts of gold, mining makes a ton early and devilsaur stealing as rogue.  Then once arcane crystals go down in value I drop mining for engineer and when devilsaur tapers off ill drop skinning for herbalism because around that time herbs go up in value.
---
Poor little feller.
---
Why do people think layers add more players to the game?
---
Lets on release day there are 100 people waiting to play classic. Lets say they have 10 servers.
---
10 People go to each server. With layering, that is 3 layers. 3/3/4.
---
Without, there is just 10 people on each server.
---
For this example, 10 people is a lot, you're gonna have to wait for mobs etc.
---
You can move the numbers around all you like. The amount of people will be the same.
---
Even if you were right, you are just multiplying the resources for the select few that know exactly what to do, putting them so far ahead early on it will take forever to catch up.
---
YES, THAT'S HOW PLAYING ON 1.12 WORKS.
---
It's a video of me leveling unread warlock. I only pick up herbalism to help with two of the quests. I plan on leveling professions after the classic release chaos is over... the goal is simple - get out of the starting zone quicker than most people. If you watch, I do 1-6 in about 35 minutes.
---
The only option other than DKP is, of course, random rolls. Of course.
---
My biggest fear is getting my warlock pet on launch, which requires rattlecages and rng.
---
I am also playing this.
---
&gt; more likely when a layer reaches "capacity" they split it down the middle (preserving groups, guilds + friendlists as possible) and keep adding to both so population is more or less evenly spread out.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; We know that some layer hopping is happening without group invites from a bunch of streamer clips.
---
&gt; Dynamic population re-balancing is the most likely reason.
---
&gt; https://clips.twitch.tv/DifficultProtectivePlumPhilosoraptor
---
&gt; https://clips.twitch.tv/MoralAgileCatTwitchRPG
---
not a chance in hell that it would work like that.   It would cause way too many deaths in the open world.   People would die constantly because of it.
---
You have 1 clip that shows something similar happening, but it's impossible to say for sure.
---
Paladin will be better for the group you are with.  Freedom for melee and bop for the mage.
---
that applies to assertions on both sides, if you just want to say "citation" to force me into doing a lot of effort for no real reason (people on the internet don't just read your study and change their mind) then you have to make a sacrifice first.
---
Give me an itemized list of citations for myself and the person I responded to, what do you want to see qualified. What values do you have that you would challenge them on and ask for a citation in defense of their position as a whole.
---
i was on the fence orc/human but now i am sold
---
Supply and demand my dude. Probably there isn't enough demand for RP servers, let alone for RP-PVP server. That being said, they should give you that option, freedom of choice.
---
Isn't it more of a boat cave?
---
It's not the new models that bug me it's the shitty over exaggerated animations.
---
It seems as though you made this specifically made this for me, as I have been suffering with this dilemma. So thank you!! :) 
---
Thanks to you, I have officially decided Night Elf simply because I do want to level in Darkshore! And I've never actually fully leveled in Ashenvale (always run to Duskwood after). Maybe this time, I will stay and venture through.
---
I keep thinking it was announced last Blizzcon...blows my mind that it was the year before. Although that just reflects badly on the previous one.
---
Nowdays private server players reach 60 before 3 days played. And thats the latest servers records atleast. Silver Hand just launched for a last race to 60 for all private server players and Jokerdtv (twitch) got to 60 in 2 days 17 hours as mage AoE farming from lvl 16-60. Server launched on Saturday at 16.00. He got to 60 aprox 20 hours ago.  Thats not average lvling tho and if classic AoE farming still will be as bad at it is now it wont even be possible.
---
Also PServers may have turned up the XP gain.
---
I’m going to roll a Tauren Shaman and Troll priest. I’m very committed to these (played hunter and warrior back in the day and like the pvp options this brings.)
---
What do you think I should go for first?
---
Why is it unfortunate if bugs are getting fixed? This isn’t vanilla wow. This is classic, it is different.
---
&gt; There is no amorphous "Vanilla" that somehow gives you the sum of every moment of Vanilla WoW.
---
That's exactly right.
---
Why am I wrong again? I'm confused at your insistence that I am.
---
You aren't using dkp if the hunter gets geared for free either... What's your point? There are usually rules. I'm all for dkp with small rules.... Getting free gear if noone else needs/isn't a bis is one (because it helps overall dps) and not being able to spend dkp outside of your obvious class items. Loot distribution is hard.
---
Now all the private server hunters will finally understand why entrapment+frost trap was the way to go to fight melees post 1.9 ...
---
It isn't like people were telling them over and over again
---
One thing I would argue about Night Elf Racial, is although yes you can stealth in cat form, I enjoy eating and Shadowmelding in PvP. Especially in Warsong Gulch after you just barely survived and can't afford to go cat and stealth away.
---
Yep, $3.99
---
That's an easy buy.  It will be the 3rd time, I buy some version of the original dark souls lol
---
&gt;If my Gladius Heroic Strikes for 163, and Tomahawk Heroic Strikes for 150, how   
---
&gt;exactly  
---
&gt; is the Damage Per Rage the same? Please don't come in here and shit talk someone who cleared Vanilla Naxx on his warrior main,   
---
&gt;peasant  
---
&gt;.
---
BECAUSE HEROIC STRIKE SUBSTITUTES FOR YOUR NEXT WHITE ATTACK, YOU UNCULTURED SWINE.  
---
So, you Gladius white hits for 152, and Tomahawk white hits for 139. When you HS you get +11 damage REGARDLESS OF WHICH WEAPON YOU HAVE.  
---
Holy shit this discussion is dumb.
---
People are going to play Classic with the new models and animations regardless of whether Blizzard adds them in or not.
---
The shills accusation is dumb but considering how exploitable layering swapping without a cooldown was, it's not that hard to imagine why some people were making a big deal out of it.
---
I'm not sure they don't have financial pressure, being part of Activision.

Ideally, this would be client side and each player could choose which graphic they see.
---
I bet her reasoning was "I run this guild and I deserve it due to all the hard work I put in" wasn't it?
---
Doesn't shifting take that off, on the beta?
---
No, sharding wasn't added until warlords of draenor.
---
\-Rage generation is fundamentally variable based on damage output, weapon speed, and multiple game factors including player level, mob level/hp, etc. You can't just theorycraft raw numbers on Reddit and assume it to be true in game. The same two weapons of the same DPS but different speeds will generate rage in nuanced ways. Also, the faster weapon that uses more Heroic Strike is allowing more chances for Mob Block Value to trigger. Static Block Value on mobs is a significant DPS decrease to a faster weapon than slow (if DPS is the same).  
---
\-Parry haste is really, really good. It triggers on average once per fight for an Arms spec'd warrior. On average the haste gain on slower weapons will be larger than faster.  
---
\-The discussion was never about standing still spamming HS. It was an argument about the effect of weapon speed on Heroic Strike Damage Per Rage calculations.  
---
Here's a source link to the Rage Formulae. Notice how bonus rage increment (\[f\*s\]/2) even favors slower weapons for rage generation:  [https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Rage#Formulae](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Rage#Formulae)
---
Retail doesn't need saving. It will forever out-earn Classic.
---
You are wrong in saying that 1.12 isn't Vanilla.  It is.  So is 1.0, 1.1, 1.2...
---
They all are.  Stop pretending you don't know this.
---
Name some unintended bugs that were present in 1.12.
---
&gt;You're paying for 11 damage on your next hit, which means you're also giving all rage generation on that swing up.
---
which means HEROIC STRIKING with a slower weapons gives up way more rage than HSing with a faster weapon.  
---
Shit you can't even keep your argument straight.
---
No changes mean: the good, the bad, and the ugly.
---
&lt;3 thanks for the love. I'm torn on this one honestly. I hate to bite the bullet here but it's clear that in the videos it DR's with each other and so they might stick with it.  
---
However, I will say that I just found/verified that the listed [classic.wowhead.com](https://classic.wowhead.com) CC classes were correct. If you look [here](https://wow.tools/dbc/?dbc=spellcategories&amp;build=1.13.2.30901#search=14309&amp;page=1) you can see the spell effect for freezing trap is listed as Mechanic 13. This is the CC class if you're unaware, and this is straight from the game files itself with 13 being a freeze effect. Only Ice block shares the same CC class though that one is a buff and is removable. See [here](https://wow.tools/dbc/?dbc=spellcategories&amp;build=1.13.2.30901#search=11958&amp;page=1) for confirmation. If you look [here](https://wow.tools/dbc/?dbc=spellcategories&amp;build=1.13.2.30901#search=19503&amp;page=1) you can see the mechanic listed for scatter shot as 2, which is a disorient. Notice the classes are 2 different ones. You can also see [here](https://wow.tools/dbc/?dbc=spellcategories&amp;build=1.13.2.30901#search=2094&amp;page=1) that the CC class of Blind is also 2, which is disorient. This just further proves (from the literal game files) that they are different CC classes.  
---
The official patch notes clearly state that different schools do not diminish each other as well.   
---
[Patch 1.4 notes](https://web.archive.org/web/20050421034846/http:/worldofwarcraft.com:80/patchnotes/patch-05-04-19.html)  
---
" A handful of spells were added to the list of spells subject to diminishing returns in PvP. It is our goal to set as few spells as possible to be diminished. We've identified this short list of spells as having durations and cooldowns sufficient to almost permanently slow or immobilize targets but without adequate controls or other limiting factors. When a spell with diminishing returns is used against a target in PvP, the first effect has full duration. On the second **use of the same category of spell (e.g. slowing)**, that spell's duration is reduced by 50%. On the third use, the duration is reduced by 75%. On the fourth attempt, the target becomes immune to the spell. Spells must be used on the same target within 15 seconds of the \*end\* of the duration in order to be diminished. In other words, if a target hasn't had a slowing spell active on them for more than 15 seconds, the next slowing spell will have full effect. "  
---
I bolded the important part. So we have the patch note that says it has no DR if they're not the same category and we have info pulled straight from the game files that it is not the same DR category. Then we have video evidence from vanilla showing that it DR'd, clearly indicating that it was bugged or that blizzard added additional code in specifically for scatter and freezing trap to make it indeed not DR with itself. I think the latter is the least believable of the two, but who knows.
---
Classified trade secrets man.
---
They don't want dead servers and they don't want massive queues.
---
&gt;Your arguments all seem 100% true in regards to instant attacks, but I'm not sure that they necessarily hold water in a theoretical world where you're standing in one spot spamming HS.
---
They don't.
---
Obviously the bugs and exploits should be fixed.  The only people that will disagree are the shitters from the pirated realms that abuse the exploits constantly.
---
I'd like some small class changes post-naxx, but nothing close to what TBC did.   
---
Give hybrids a tiny boost in non-healing roles, but make those boosts more for consistency than actual power; gear can do the rest.   
---
That said, I'm fine without those changes as well; unique class trinkets to help with mana would also be neat, but perhaps too necessary for prot pallies/ele sham/boomkin, etc...
---
The hunter big ppl are talking about. Some previous patch put scatter and frost/freezing (I get them mixed up) on the same DR. That was not intended as it was never in the notes.
---
It's going to be very hard to tell what was, and was not intended. The whole gold duping thing is kind of a bad example, in that regard, since it's clearly unintended. The point I was making was that IF we found out it WAS a bug, it should be removed. 
---
People say DM N tribute farming is a hunter bug and should be removed. Funny enough I was able to do it, on a druid, on every private server I had one at max lvl.
---
&gt; Batching isn't a rule
---
It is an intentional mechanic designed for the game and programmed into it. It doesn't matter that it was done because of technical limitations of the time. It is a rule. *You don't have to like that it is a rule*... but... *it is a rule*. Games have rules that govern them. You literally can't define the word rule that doesn't include batching as a rule without also excluding lots of things that are obviously rules.
---
&gt; Just like 20ms is the current lowest feasible amount.
---
You still have yet to prove this. If the horrendous lag from world-pvp in retail is any indication, 20ms is not actually the lowest feasible amount. So you need to prove that 21ms is not low even and that 19ms is not feasible. How is it that some online games that run at 60 FPS work on 16ms batching and those are fine? CSGO has a tickrate of 64, which means it has 15ms batching. Why isn't that feasible for WoW?
---
So 1.12 should be allowed to have 1.12.1, and so on?
---
That's what a beta is for... to test things so they aren't abusable in the live game.
---
Dont forget innervate
---
Tons of changes didn't make the notes. The could have easily changed it in the 5 months where 1.11 or 1.12 came out  if they wanted to. They didn't. Not a bug.
---
It’s not reasonable to just leave bugs and exploits simply because a vocal group sits here and yells ‘no changes’ every time something comes up.
---
Classic is supposed to deliver a vanilla-esque experience, not be a carbon copy. These are different ideas, and advocating for bugs or exploits to remain in the game because “nochangeslolbbq” is short sighted.
---
They were focused on TBC and complete redesign of the classes and systems.
---
Not the same haha.
---
No no no. It was not designed for the game and programmed into it nor was it intentional. It was **limited** to that. The hardware of the time could not support better. 
---
I absolutely do not have to prove that 19ms is not feasible, I'm not the one who decides what is feasible and I even told you that already. If it turned out 19 was feasible, I'd argue for that. All the way down to zero.
---
Some sort of catacombs instance inside Arathi Highland's Stormgarde Keep would be awesome. Have it start inside the main keep itself and wind it's way through the catacombs of the keep then into a cave system until it spits you out in the little cove on the backside. Have it be level 38-42 which would come after Scarlet Monastery but before Zul'Farrak, and 1 or 2 levels above RFD. Lore would wrap around a Syndicate Faction instance and dispatching them from the once proud stronghold plus the factor of them being douches up to no good. Make it be like Deadmines (Defias Faction) with a mixture of interesting races and enemies that fall within the Syndicate Faction. Additionally since there are already quest lines to enter Stormgarde and kill everyone and everything in it, it would tie together with the current lore in the game. Continuity!

Since both Alliance and Horde share Arathi Highlands, and many players are there, it would be in a good location. It would be the only instance in it's area as well, with a well guarded and annoying band of elites in the exterior keep to defend it.

-People complain about stuff in the Beta.   
---
-Blizzard changes things people are complaining about
---
-See they changed it, I don't even know why people were complaining.   
---
Mind blowing.
---
same it's crazy thinking about how patient I was about classic until the beta launched
---
Did i say he would be wrong? Or did i say would you take advice from him? Seems like you two need learn to read. See you in classic :)
---
I like that round-a-corner trick -- thanks.
---
Yeah, I wish pvp would give you decently itemized gear. Oh well. Small price to pay to have a decent version of the game back. 
---
Thanks again.
---
(We are actually playing on 1.13, technically)
---
Yup, and also made and added a massive 40 man vanilla raid and talent revamps for mage, shaman and rogue. Seems a bit odd they would just leave a core hunter mechanic *bugged* for the entire time?
---
This is my favorite post on this sub in a while. It over complicates and over engineers something in wow that just doesn’t need any attention... one of my personal favorite pastimes. More please!
---
More like ‘Classic 1.0’
---
A fix would assume that it was broken and went without notice despite every hunter who lacked the ability to kite or the knowledge to use other options to disengage a melee (imp wing, counter, entrapment) whining like a madman about it on the forums. Hell even the pvp videos of that time q.q about the DR changes and warcraftmovie comments mention them.
---
(but alas p-server players were immune to all that for months)
---
The change to scatter in TBC was made because the trap mechanic was changed entirely to allow players to use traps in combat. Though with a 2 second delay and scatter was taken off that DR category so hunters could crowd control in combat in pvp as well...
---
It depends on the location.  I definitely try not to curse in public, but if i'm around people I know.  Fuck, shit, asshole, god damn...all of it comes out.  But the thing is...that's what the podcast is supposed to feel like, just an intimate place to shoot the shit with people you don't have to worry about offending (like in public).
---
I do agree though, that he should have some sort of warning in the beginning, most podcasts will do that.  But also, most podcasts will also use swear words.
---
&gt; No no no. It was not designed for the game and programmed into it nor was it intentional
---
Oh? Really? Then how come 400ms batching exists? Is there a goblin that lives on each server rack that sucks on the cables and only allows data to go through every 400ms? Perhaps a gremlin? A curmudgeon? Oh ho ho very interesting this lore you weave. I wonder just how that 400ms batching got into classic wow. Maybe it was the illuminati scanning all the packets and creating "fake lag"??? Truly we should endeavor to get to the bottom of this.
---
Relevant username
---
It was not patch notes. But I don't want to focus on single item. My question is more general. Original 1.12 had a finite lifespan and TBC would change everything, so Blizz was not focused on bugs. 
---
Now 1.12 is kind of a permanent state, should blizz continuously fix things?
---
It’s a bigger change to leave them in and known than it is to take them out.
---
One guy, one guy, that I’m aware of on Arthas US knew how to jump out of the map in wsg. One guy. 
---
If something like that stayed in, learning it would be a necessity for any decent Druid flag carrier.
---
So we go from back in they day where one nerd knew about it. To 2019 where every premise abuses it. 
---
“Classic, just as I remember it”
---
The world buff exploits won't work in classic.
---
There already was a 1.12.1, and a 1.12.2.
---
Never forget that the previous beta Blizz did was for BfA...
---
Last night I had a dream (or should I say a nightmare) where Classic was launching and for some weird reason I could not start to level straight up with other people. My character got sort of layered away and I could not find any mobs or NPCs. It was hellish.
---
It was an example.
---
Pretty sweet idea
---
You don't know that it wasn't intended.  The "bug" could be that it wasn't mentioned in the notes.  They didn't spell out what group they put it in, but omitting that doesn't make it being in one table over a different one a bug.

OMG totally reminded me that in my five year absence (since WoD) I don't recall where I stashed all of my paraphernalia lol
---
Yeah imagine making it a place for Rogues to hang out as a uh Class Hall...
---
They don't want dead servers and they absolutely hate merging realms for some reason so they won't ever do this.
---
Well "Classic" is being called 1.13.  I'm sure we're going to wind up with 1.13.1 when they find some more stuff to tweak after it's released.  Maybe not, but I'll be a bit surprised if they don't.
---
Agreed, that was just an example as requested.
---
That is easy though because you just need the kill. So group with people hunting rattle cages.
---
That’s just it. It’s a different game engine, different server structure, same quests, same talents. The amount of work needed to release classic is similar to a brand new game. Classic is a different game than I played in the second half of 2006, if it has the same feel as that game, I’m going to be happy. It will never be the exact same, and that’s a good thing.
---
DM = Deadmines
---
DM North/East/West = Dire Maul
---
Man hunters look so bugged right now. Puts me off playing one at least until it's sorted.
---
400 batching is not in wow. 200 was what it was and what it is.
---
Even if you were right (which I doubt) it's irrelevant anyway. Saying 400ms batching once existed is no different to saying 200ms batching also once existed.
---
They didn't do 200 for fun, or because it seemed like a nice number. They did so because earlier hardware **could not handle going lower**
---
Once your hardware can't supply you with what you **intend** to do, you don't get to say the limitation you put in it's place is intentional. As new hardware has come in, the batching was made lower and lower, and its now at 20. That's a fact. Its objective.
---
It makes things fairer. That's a fact. It's objective.
---
You want to deny that? Fine. You can, but you're wrong.
---
Ok.
---
I’m leaning Troll. Sell me on UD
---
[removed]
---
Yeah I mean cuz it took us only 10 years of pressuring for classic. They surely break under preassure :D
---
I think it was 1 AP per strength and 2 per agility.  So that would put the  second one at something like 70-117?
---
Pservers are one server though that doesn't really die due to it's auidencne. Classic having many servers means some will eventually die
---
Yea I think you’re right. Resto druids definitely feel a little underwhelming in some aspects. I like the mobility but maybe it’s time to try a different approach. I’m starting to lean a bit toward priest. On retail I actually didn’t play Druid until TBC but really felt powerful as resto. Maybe I’ll give priest a go this time.

The current WoW classic client is 1.13.2.

&gt;All I gotta say is that there are thousands of people who enter an immersive fantasy world and still choose to play as a human.

\+10% reputation is the winning factor for me.

Reminds me of EQ raiding. 90% of the time you’re clumped up in a weird spot to avoid all boss damage with half your character in a wall.

Someone probably answered already, but it is working properly. A lot of people using the ring, and I myself did it on a 40 hunter.

wait what happened?

*for vast majority of Vanilla
---
I want to add my 2 cents here because I actually watch the "Horde walljumper" in question when he does stream - He has expressed already that he's constantly abusing this in order to draw attention to it. Even stated on stream that he had intentions of uploading a video of all the jumps possible in the current Beta in a very easy and watchable format for Blizzard to decide on their own which jumps are "fair" and which are completely "exploits" or "busted". Those getting upset at him for prolonging games by using the walljumps, I understand where your frustration comes from. However, rallying others and witch-hunting him and calling for him to be banned on launch is actually despicable behavior and I won't name names but there are those who need to separate that they are playing a Beta where these things are supposed to be tested and actual launch.
---
&gt;You don't need to be at Def cap to raid.
---
luckily because you can't cap def without raids
---
&gt;I feel uncomfortable to enter a raid and not be crit capped.
---
You can't crit cap before at the very least BWL
---
badass!  it looks great, wish i still had all my discs!  hmm.  i think i do.  time to go digging!
---
You're looking at it wrong.  
---
More players leads to more layers.  
---
Assume each layerof a server is designed for 3000 players. If 6000 players log into the server, a 2nd layers is generated for the additional 3000 players.  
---
Assume (and this is assuming) 20% of the player base per layer are farmers. That means 600 players per layer are farming nodes.  
---
Sure if a 2nd empty layer exist, that would mean more items to farm for the 600 players. However, the 2nd layer would only exist if there's more players.  
---
So assuming layer #2 also has 600 farmers, that's 1200 players farming nodes on that server alone.  
---
This is throwing a lot of assumption, but is an example of how layering is meant to work.  
---
However, layering does have a problem, while no abusable, is a problem.  
---
What happens when there are 4000 players online? That means a 2nd layer is generated with less player, but same resource spawn timer. Than players from the 1st layer can abuse the 2nd.  
---
This is something Blizzard needs to think about.  
---
About the economy part. I'm sure some players will dedicate themselves early on farming. And will abuse the system. OK than. What price are they going to charge on AH? If they charge too high, no one is going to buy them, they'd farm themselves. A server equilibrium will be created either way.
---
&gt; I don't think it's wrong to discuss healthy living options. The part  where it may perhaps become questionable is (assuming) motive. 
---
Fully agree and an intelligent observation.
---
&gt; For instance, if an individual pursues change in another for **personal  gain**, it is **likely manipulative**, and ultimately dangerous. This is  typically because motives like this often lead to near-impossible  expectation management, which typically resolves in further failed  relationships. 
---
I strongly agree with your intentions here, but disagree on 2 points I put in bold letters. Every single relationship, happy and healthy or otherwise, is based mostly on **personal gain**.(he doesn't have enough money to support me and the kids I want to have, she isn't young enough to raise my children healthily, as examples) You would not at first sight see a potential partner who looks physically unappealing and seems personally toxic, and say "this is my moment to be altruistic and prove relationships are about making them happy and I come second". I think a stronger way to phrase your claim is that we always want **some** change and concessions made on the part of someone we meet, but you try to minimize this by finding a "near perfect" match before so much less realigning happens in the relationship. Let me know what you think.
---
&gt; However, what is generally not assumed, is **the possibility of genuine  care for another individual**. The **liklihood of this is remote, and  generally disregarded**, as in this case, **the individuals did not have a  close working relationship as friends outside of online interactions** \-  which **greatly limits effective communication**. This means that while the  guy in this story may have indeed been genuine, it would be **much easier  for him to simulate genuine care, regardless of whether he did or not at  the time.** 
---
You can't know for sure and to what degree but you admit that, I think people meeting online is fine, they are both adults and accept the weaknesses of it. I strongly agree that overall being online can get you catfished and should be taken into account just like any other "sub-optimal" way of interacting with people where information gathering is important.
---
&gt; The part of speaking to a **girl** he wanted to date, who **was in a committed  relationship** creates **an entirely new scenario**. In this case, directly  confronting issues with someone he is interested in seems innocent  enough. However, there is something to be said for the missing peice of  this puzzle: we must assume that given the information provided, she was  not available to pursue another relationship, having a current  commitment to another. 
---
I am going to just go on a personal rant here, to me personally. This is disgusting, you are in a relationship that IIRC was emotional at least for the man she left, and given a quick monkey branch to a higher rung on the latter she takes it instantly. This is disgusting to me and a big red flag for a lot of reasons, she was basically just keeping the motor running while waiting to make a big getaway with the "right" man it seems. I think men OR women doing these kinds of trades is manipulative because it isn't openly stated and seems like some level of subterfuge is required(to be fair I think most people know deep down if they are keeper type material or just being used as a stepping stone). To people who care(either sex) about the number of partners their S/O has been with this also kind of adds another notch to the belt that just disgusts some people, and thinking she hopped from one guy to another so quickly might make that worse. I could say more, overall I agree this is a big red flag and probably means they both had some issues, would not take a woman who could be so disloyal or flaunt herself out in boredom while waiting for a better relationship.
---
&gt; While many have no issue with the pursuit of anyone in this particular  circumstance, it is worth noting the morality/ethics of this situation.  First and foremost, what is the nature of the new relationship, founded  on this separation? The man in this case, once securing his prize, then  must deal with the internal dilema surrounding the inevitable question:  Will do the same to me that she did to her ex? 
---
I fully agree, he probably offered her mostly superficial benefits, while motivating her to get in shape is probably as good to her emotionally and spiritually as it is to both of them physically it is still not even close to a working relationship by itself, maybe they thought they could form trust around this big dowry payment at the outset. She will love him for all his help and stay loyal, maybe he thinks he has to "rescue" a woman because he can't keep her loyalty without the guilt of leaving the guy who saved you. Low self -esteem like that can't be good if that's the case. To me I agree, this relationship would feel like a spy vs spy type of thing where both of them have trust issues.
---
&gt; This often results in various character traits deemed negative, or even  entirely dangerous. Some individuals become possessive. Others **never  fully trust their partner**, constantly searching and allowing no quarter  of personal space, to ensure compliance with their new contract. This  may also be considered possessive, but is usually defined as  "controlling" - as many times these individuals are steadily isolated  from other friendships, phones or e-mails and other personal items are  scrutinized or confiscated altogether, and any sort of freedom comes at a  high cost. 
---
Seems kind of dramatic but it's true I've known people who have "phone checks". Fuck that my phone is personal and you aren't aloud to just inspect it, trust me or leave me, fuck this resent stoking "show your papers" kind of stuff. fully agree here if this happens it's get out time.
---
&gt; On her side, she must cope with the knowledge she hurt someone she once  cared about. And, she did it for her own personal gain - so no matter  how legitimate, she will live the rest of her life with this thought  weighing on her conscience. Then, she has to realize that she has stuck  herself in this situation, with a new man, who was willing to pursue a  woman already in a commitment, which means his own commitment to her may  not hold the same value she hopes and desires. 
---
On the flip side, she realized the person she was with was a loser with no goals, and who was happy with her being fat, miserable, and unhealthy. Now she resents him because she found a man who was willing to invest in her personal self esteem and freedom, not enable her co-dependent side with just words but no actions to reflect those words. **Maybe, but who cares** about the outcome it works for some and others it doesn't. Overall agree here.
---
Personally, I have had bad friends before, and good friends. And you have no idea what a bad friend is until you meet a genuinely good friend.
---
What a good post, I barely had any disagreements or points to pick at. I would never do what was done there or trust anyone who did, but that is me personally. My personal moral values are very high I think.

&gt; Posts a link, puts in an unattributed quote after the link that doesn't appear in the link. Then assumes the quote specifically means strict hardware limitations and not cost limitations based on shareholder demands, or software limitations that could have been improved, but they didn't feel like putting in the effort at the time.
---
wew.
---
&gt; It makes things fairer. That's a fact. It's objective.
---
You have no idea what any of these words mean. Objective doesn't mean something that is "obviously true". It means something that is "provably true". I would agree with you that faster batch speeds are better *in general*, but unlike you I am willing to acknowledge that that's not based on some fundamental truth of the universe, that's just how I like my games - responsive. If you want to present any evidence that "proves" anything you're saying, I am still waiting.
---
Depends on what you want to run. It's pretty to add an East, West, North or Tribute to the words Dire Maul.
---
Wow, I clicked into the comments and totally missed that it was a link to a video. Sorry about that.
---
That's a good plan, especially if you have the time to keep pushing and stay ahead of the zerg. If I had the time to do that I would push to 60 first and go back for professions later, especially as a warlock since food buffs aren't necessary. Good luck!

It seems you won the argument, but you should have mentioned the parry hasting and static block values and armor way earlier... Because at first it did seem like you didn't understand that heroic strike adds just 11 damage no matter what speed weapon.
---
&gt;you always have shield block up so you're not getting hit with crushing blows.
---
if you get parried any boss can eat up your shield block
---
With perception honestly not so much. It has a limited physical and you have to be FACING the target. Basically you have to already have an idea of where the target is for it to maybe be helpful and work. Extremely situational, certainly not worth choosing a race for.

Nah that's called Scholo

Thank you for your input. I had no idea the druid in question streamed, and am happy to hear his reasoning. If my tone came off as frustrated at him personally for using those jumps, I apologize for being unclear. I'm annoyed at the existence of the exploits, not the people who use them. It's a beta test, emphasis on test. These sorts of issues are exactly why it's happening.
---
Pretty sure many of these are just supposed to be inaccessible mountains.
---
Yeah I said the same replying to dnewc, obviously the other guy didn't care enough to motivate her to lose weight, or she wouldn't let him motivate her because of something on her side. Losing a lot of weight is a BIG DEAL no pun intended, so many factors we don't know like the length of the first relationship etc. Overall it wasn't a relationship built to last for obvious reasons, that guy knocked it down early.
---
"a lot".

Only two servers until this very day managed to hane a ~5 thousand (still not even close to 10k) queue line.

Blizzard, apart from the recent work done by the Classic team, has done absolutely nothing to inspire confidence in the fan base over the last ten years. It has been one long series of gaffes, miscalculations, and bizarre out of touch decisions. - one after another. The rampant skepticism and scrutiny of their every action by the fan base has been well earned and they deserve every bit of it. 
---
The actions of the Classic team so far have definitely been encouraging, but that isn’t going to make people forget everything they’ve done overnight. It took them over a decade to earn their legendary reputation with SC, Diablo, and the WoW series and even if they turn over a new leaf it might take just as long for them to earn that reputation back.
---
Doesn't assume anything. Feasibility studies include the things you mentioned.
---
I have every idea. You don't. Instead you post boring loaded questions, ignore answers that I have to repeat, and demand evidence that I don't have to give because I'm not the arbiter of the decisions around them.
---
If you want to stop going round in circles with your own nonsense, start by accepting that it's fairer for acted first to have their spell act first. Otherwise you're dishonest.
---
&gt;should have this ability up all the time. especially if you're prot.
---
but when you get your attacks parried the boss attacks faster and can eat your 2 charges before the cd is up, resulting in a 3rd hit which can crit or crush.
---
&gt; Didn't ever imply if it was acceptable or not. 
---
Yes I noticed you left it that vague on purpose, I never implied parents should have the legal right to knock down their adult kid's door and arrest them for taking dirty pictures, but for some reason that is where you people jump to.
---
&gt; Please cease.

---
In infinite rage scenarios Heroic Strike actually deals higher DPS with faster weapons because it adds flat damage on your next swing.
---
I take issue with you making sweeping generalizations about the nature of human society and sexual morality without bringing receipts. You made the claims. Back them up.
---
&gt;You cannot be crushed with block, but you can be crit.
---
that's not how attack table works.

 Enjoy the grind.

Can you provide source that there's always a fixed number of layers? Because that's what you're implying. And is the fundamental cause of the argument here.
---
That IS the time they give you to organize with guild and friends. 2 weeks.
---
If you want PVP utility try druid. They are beasts in wpvp and bgs because of their abilities to self heal, have increased movement speed without mounting, shed ccs, pop into tanmy mode OR stealth mode, heal on the fly with hots, cc eith roots, damage with dots or direct damage, etc. Basically you can do anything and can outlast or outrun almost anyone.
---
you need 102.4% to cover the whole attack table, to account for reduced parry/dodge/miss chance
---
Before i rip my bong, the answer is no.
---
&gt;You should already be defense capped if you're tanking the MC.

it's practically impossible to cap defense before BWL.

I'm not, I was in the Navy for 10 years, if I dont say fuck, fucked or fucking after every period then you know i'm mad.

Horde not having access to Dartol's Rod of Transformation is a *much* bigger affront than some silly mount.

MC is way easier than ZG though.

Oh no. His five brain-cells overheated.

That's such a dodge. We're imperfect so screw it, do whatever you want? We can't ever attain perfection, but by striving we may approach it. It's not about pretending, it's about taking accountability for yourself and your actions without explaining away bad behavior. I hit on women in relationships during my less-altruistic past. It was wrong. Simple as that.

Do you believe racism is bad?

&gt;The world buff exploits won't work in classic.
---
it's not an exploit, and while it'll be more logistically difficult it will work.
---
It's a step in the right direction.
---
Shoutout to all the moms who paid for our subs.  Seriously.
---
This game kept me out of trouble.
---
The reason it's so heavily coveted is for its PvP applications. It remains BiS for frost mage pvp throughout the entirety of Classic.
---
I mean lower shapeshift form damage is already a blow against the easy TPS of druids. As for parry -- it's a little more than slightly worse; yes you will get parryhasted less often because you will be parried less often, but if you get parried at the start of a fight or heaven forbid double parried, you and your raid could either be sitting around like idiots for 7 seconds OR dead because dps didn't anticipate that and ripped.
---
Of course it is. This is obvious to anyone with a functional brain. Assigning negative stereotypes to human beings based on superficial characteristics is something only a fool would do.
---

---
Not sure that link is working, but that's just an example of a hybrid build. You can mix and match though, for emphasis on different play styles. You could drop the +hit for the pushback resist. You'll just have to find what fits best for you
---
The server list could be announced sooner than when they open it up for character creation.
---
You made me want to play priest... thank you!
---
There are like 1000 pointless classic wow discussion videos on YouTube a day.  I'm almost impressed.

---
We got retail cause Blizzard listened to the complainers, not the people minding their own business playing the game.
---
So can anyone else...
---
Meanwhile, Stress Test #12 was a ghost town. :(
---
Shaman with a good weapon could really excel at leveling. so if you have a way to feed him the weapon it would be nice.
---
Priest needs a wand .... but an amazing or an average want do not make much difference compared to an ench shammy especially with WF.
---
It will work in Classic.
---
This is a fair point; I could have been more clear. However I was trying to not misrepresent game mechanics in a way that would de-rail this threat from it's original purpose: I made a thing in case anyone would like to use it, in the hopes that it could help some poor solo warrior wandering Azeroth. Apparently I failed completely in that regard.
---
I would take any queue, crowded areas or zones, over any layering and a huge quantity of other too, way more than those who want RP servers.
---
Is there a transcript?
---
Thank you.
---
Is there any official statement on exactly how long layering is intended to be active for, that we could hold them to account for?
---
Vague statements about intentions mean nothing from Blizzard anymore.
---
There's a bunch of info about druids doing less damage on the beta than ps, the dr on blind doesn't seem to work the same, there's wonky stuff with mouseovers and now this dr about scatter.
---
How dare you
---
Kodos are the best mounts in the game
---
You act like the only way to have gold on classic is to no life it. Lol
---
All you have to do is dedicate some time to farming instead of doing a dungeon or wpvp. People who justify buying gold honestly ruin the game.
---
Oh god yes they did.  In early gear levels it’s extremely good.  Later the stages go the worse it gets unfortunately
---
This will actually solve layer hopping of farming rare nodes. The more often they hop, they longer the next one takes.
---
I think I should do more research on the event, I wasn’t aware there were rewards for turn ins.
---
I'm playing Monster Hunter World. It's been really fun so far.
---
Horde or Alliance?
---
PVP or PVE server (matters for leveling and open world PVP)
---
Moonwalking is a bug and it's a really fun part of Vanilla. It has nothing to do with gameplay it's just something visual.
---
&gt;The reason it's so heavily coveted is for its PvP applications. It remains BiS for frost mage pvp throughout the entirety of Classic.
---
it's a 1% proc chance, I honestly can't see it being that relevant
---
Absolutely, I didn't mean that you were witch-hunting him. You have put forth more exposure to the issue and you did the right thing in blocking names to avoid further witch-hunting
---
Their armor is really high
---
This was the only thing I use to think about in class, probably the deterioration of my high school career.
---
Also to be fair, we don't pay attention to the stuff Blizzard does fix. The ones they don't are just obvious and more remembered.
---
&gt; 99% of people who buy gold are just poor and terrible with managing their own resources.
---
This is just outright false.
---
"The potentially unlimited charges that could be built up was limited to 5 in a hot fix after a video of a paladin soloing Doom Lord Kazzak was released."
---
That quote is in the paragraph, and the video of Lord Kazzak being soloed by a paladin using the "reckoning bomb"  is on YouTube.
---
What if I found a way to abuse spell batching to dupe gold?
---
Priests are a nit more offensive healer in PVP, You mana burn, fear, MC
---
Paladin is more defensive healer with not much killing potential if ever caught alone.
---
When you're a clicker it's actually faster since it's closer to the center of the screen. Didn't have a good hotkey setup back then.
---
Oh boy... Stop assuming shits. The world doesn't revolve around your unproved needs.
---
There's no demon Hunter on there
---
If they were bugs that were not intended perhaps yes, if they were planned changes then no.
---
Horde PvP, sorry!
---
Dwarf warrior, human mage -- rocking the boat there with those race choices, eh??
---
Generally curious why you'd skip humans and +weapon skill though.
---
Man it's almost like you're intentionally ignoring literally everything I'm saying. I wonder how much longer you'll scream "You're wrong" at me while simultaneously agreeing with me. It's really feeling a little gaslighy right now.
---
Topical
---
#nochanges
---
Ya it isnt a copy. It has updated talents, gear, spells, UI, macros, and ever certain graphics. 
---
What is actually blizzlike and more classic, is for bugs being abused to slowly be fixed. There were dozens of patches addressing bugs. Why would they leave them in?
---
Go to /r/buildapc or /r/buildapcsales
---
I don’t want them to overclutter the game with patches every 6 months for forever like with the live game. But small pieces of content, for 1-59 and 60, could be pretty cool *if* executed pretty well. Something like Karazhan Crypts, or the old Dragon Isles map that was never used. Maybe a zone or two.
---
The thing is, it’s hard to keep adding to the game when there’s no reset, like the live game gets every 2 or so years. So power creep, too much content, possibly trivializing some older content. In small pieces that are spread far apart, I’d be pretty excited for it.
---
Warlock and Hunter are much easier to level solo. I would consider leveling a harder soloing class with a partner so Rogue is a good option.
---
The time from 1.10, where diminishing returns was added in notes along with the undocumented cooldown change, to the TBC prepatch where it seems to have been removed wasn't that long.
---
It's definitely possible that this was a bug that went unaddressed for a bit longer than usual.
---
That said I don't 1v1 PvP much, so whatever.
---
If Blizz has time to check in on this it's worth it imo.
---
Not in the healing world. I was a Resto shaman in a top 50 world guild, cleared pre-nerf T5 for example. Resto shaman healing was hugely OP, in raids I would routinely double the HPS of our best non-shaman healer.
---
In PVP in my battlegroup, of the top 100 teams in 2v2, there was around 85 with druids at any time and 75-80 with warriors. I spent time as the highest rated shaman in BG9 in 2v2 and it was druid healers for days. When I used to sell teams I'd find utterly horrible druid/warrior teams sitting at 2100.
---
I'm not a hardcore Overwatch player, but I find it a good game overall.. Diablo 3 turned into a really good ARPG. Legion is considered one of the better WoW expansions. Heroes of the Storm TBH I felt was underrated.
---
Just my two cents. Blizz aint perfect but this "literally havent done good in a decade" is insane speak.
---
Optional? Sure. I wouldn't use them but I'm sure some would.
---
So tired of it. Honestly just watching nostalgia videos and enjoying the fact that we are going to play.
---
Generally curious as to why you would main and alt two chars with the same endgame role, albeit different functions with that role.
---
I don't really think it matters which comes first. For Phase 1 you will be going for a lot of the same pre-bis and some of the same gear within MC / Ony, and both classes will be in demand.
---
You know pc part picker is there so anyone can setup a pc. It only lists compatible parts...pretty easy to do yourself.
---
all they've said is it will be gone before the first phase.
---
Yes, Druids will have slightly less TPS in Classic, but still far more than a Warrior who isn't completely gimping their mitigation and avoidance.
---
Yes, your worst case scenario can happen on private servers, and slightly more often in Classic.
---
Why do you seem so dead set against Druid tanks? Intimidated?
---
I need more like this
---
Technically you could print just the SVG element, but losing the tech features worsens your experience quite significantly. The quest-log is always up to date so you can regularly check if you've messed up and fix it. Having direct links to database sites that detail how a weird quest is completed also saves time in the long run.
---
Keep in mind that 1-60 routes would be closer to 600 pages long. Due to bug reports, most issues have been addressed but there's no doubt plenty still left. The more I play, the more I figure out ways to make something better and because the route is located in a centralized place I can just push fixes instantly and make them available to everyone without them ever needing to download anything.
---
I am indifferent, but I fail to see how this is such an issue. So some people want new character models some don’t. It’s not like these people want all the graphics to be redone, just the ability to toggle the character models they are looking at on their screen.
---
Why would anyone be so adamant about controlling how someone else looks at the game? If Blizzard is willing to add a toggle for new models how would that effect anyone who chooses not to switch it on? Like I said, I’m indifferent, but if Blizzard is willing to include a toggle I say fine. It’s a non-issue, red apples or green apples, they are still apples.
---
I felt so vindicated when 1.11 came and I could waltz right into Naxxramas with my exalted rep.
---
If you're looking to pug MC with fast boys, I have a feeling priest will be in much more demand. Fast mage levelers will be a dime a dozen. That said, mage does have more utility for gold farming and if you don't want your gold farming abilities to be tethered to your wife's level you should take that into consideration.
---
Official word is that layering will be gone by phase 2 of Classic - which could range anywhere from a few weeks to a few months.
---
Only mages and warlocks have real AoE in classic.
---
Taking a flight path and having multiple planes of existence are way different things. WoW has never been super realistic, so something like people vanishing when they log out, take a flight, or even lag was never off putting. But any instances of changing worlds will feel really off putting to me in Classic. Having one single MMO world is probably the biggest pro the old expansions have over the modern game. 
---
Personally, their plan at Blizzcon to shard 1-10 was way better than what we’re getting now, but layering still isn’t the end of the world... if they actually kill it after two weeks. But I have a feeling, 90 days from now I’m gonna be thinking... “okay, any day now Blizz is going to remove layering right? Right?”
---
Nope.
---
Yeah if there are bugs that allow for exploit dungeon farming they should be changed as well in my opinion.
---
Pals for Life? Is that the same guild Leeroy was in?
---
I think a collections tab would be cool simply because I'm an achievement whore and vanilla doesn't have achievements.
---
Guess I'm planning on playing in a more severe zombie mode and need a format that's almost impossible to mess up.
---
Farmed Essence of Fire in Un Goro for months, lol. Probably one of the worst methods.
---
The situational aspect of dp just simply doesn’t beat out shadow guard tho.  In order for DP to be good it has to be used on a non pally non priest non dwarf who is either solo or not near one of those classes and even still it can be ice blocked/potted off/reflected back at you.... and even still it NEEDS to be used with IF or you will 100% oom yourself which eats up half the benefit of the spell.  And even on top of all that it’s on a 3 minute cool down so once it’s down, you’re gimped.
---
On troll you have shadowgaurd up 100% of the time, it does more damage over the course of a full fight than DP and it procs stun.  On top of that troll gets to use IF on a mindblast that can one shot someone with a crit.  Also berserking can go up to 25% increase casting which makes your offensive spells insanely fast or can be used to pop out a clutch heal.
---
Big true. For the alliance.
---
Then what? You think this is the only one that needs a change? Fact is it's not going to be and that's good.
---
I farmed a bunch of thorium ore and undercut the hell out of people at the AH.  I used to get up really early and farm a ton before anybody woke up.
---
You wanna play as affliction, play bfa
---
You, I like you
---
Except I don’t know what’s best???
---
Then you'd be in direct violation of Article I Section C Part 7 of the Blizzard EULA and would be banned.
---
No it isn't the only balance change that should be made by a long shot.
---
Arcane Crystals, sold for 20-30g, Thorium Bars 4-7g a stack, Dense Stone 1-2g (seem much more expensive on pservers) and the other gems, 1-7g. I had a very well pathed Rich Thorium Vein route in EPL and I can tell you with 100% certainty that no pserver has ever gotten mining node spawning correct yet.
---
Its not like I got it overnight, it took a few months, but a full circuit of EPL would usually average me about 1 full stack of Thorium and 1 AC for about 20 mins of work.
---
The fact that there was no Horde equivalent to the Winterspring rep upsets me greatly...
---
I'll miss you, purple kitten
---
Priest is less boring. Paladins are notorious for having a boring rotation (spam FoL, hit your oh shit button if it's off CD, buff everyone every 5-15 minutes). You may think this isn't a huge deal but it can actually matter a lot in the long run. Healing in general can sometimes get boring in farm content as more is not always more with that role. Couple a boring rotation with not much to do and you might regret the lack of dynamic-ness.
---
Unless you plan on staying enchanting past the wands, don't bother. There are always tons of people rushing enchanting to sell wands at inflated prices and I've found that it's easier to just pick up skinning for extra cash and buy the wands from them.
---
Nah it’s good the way it is.
---
You can solo farm lower lvl instances as a mage. 
---
Get the rarer recipes as an enchanter 
---
Get rank 11
---
I bought it on s u s a n e x p r e s s . c o m
---
For tanking troll is BiS, For fury, orc.
---
&gt; DeadMines is DM in english 
---
Incorrect. Deadmines in English is VC. DM is Dire Maul.
---
I made a lot of money running MC and BWL when we had them on farm. If you're not wiping they're actually decent money, especially as a cloth wearer with low repair fees. Aside from that most of my money came from herbalism.
---
You are right on about everything.  However, I think that if they are properly managed the server split issues would be reduced significantly.
---
&gt;Merging them would create queues 
---
They should simply not do this if it will create a queue.
---
&gt;where some people expected to eventually end up on the same server as everyone else 
---
They should actively dissuade from that assumption.
---
&gt; the ghost server would stay a ghost server and slowly die off
---
I don't see how this happens with active merging.
---
I farmed SM Cathedral mostly and living essences in Felwood (to sell). It took probably between 30 and 35 hours total over the course of a few weeks. Clearing SM became mindless, and it’s rather short so it’s a quick reset. Bonus low level ganks too. 
---
I was a shaman so aoe was tougher, relied on magma totem/fire nova totem and auto attacks, but there was a lot of safety since you could easily run out if you got overwhelmed. 
---
This was all before the BWL patch, as long as you’re not buying stupid stuff on the ah or wasting money it’s pretty simple. I farmed and sold savory deviate delights to get my alt his epic mount, it’s a mandatory raid consumable!
---
Lul, raid in something useful, get gear \[if you're lucky\] and then respec and go pvp or something.
---
You think I'll be welcomed as a Cat in raids? Hell no.
---
All these hunter issues have me switching to priest now as well.... feels bad man
---
That ain't gonna work as long as Paladin and Shaman are faction exclusive. Who's gonna AOE tank for horde and who's gonna give bloodlust for alliance?
---
Well I'm waiting then....
---
Every class has something they would like to see adjusted. I’d rather see none of them as opposed to all of them. Hate to say it, but I guess I’m with the no changes crowd on this one..
---
Whoa, I had no idea. That's pretty incredible. Is it shown how many remaining materials are needed in real-time?
---
Oh sorry. That portion didn't exist in 2005. It's not technically classic content.
---
And the fact that trap shares dr with scatter.
---
Rank 11 rewards won’t even be in game til phase 3
---
Herbalism.  My mighty dwarf warrior made his fortune by selling flowers.
---
I'm on the same boat as you are, i'm either going rogue or mage now....
---
In my previous observation Warlock is more popular on horde and Hunter on Alliance. 
---
Warlocks are weak early levels and until they get gear. They are basically a mage without blink and ice block or priest without Shield or Insta fear. Unless you get a jump on someone it is likely they will chew you up.
---
Hunter is annoying in PVP, hard to get to and they can pretty much run away from almost anyone.
---
With Gear warlocks scale MUCH better. SL lock in T2 or above gear is scary. They have enough HP to survive and each dot is insane. 
---
They take pretty much 100% of plus damage so with all talents they will each do 2K, so 4 K of DOT damage ..... A shadow bolt can crit for 4-5K so regular 2+K hit. Tanks had 5-6K HP so you can imagine others
---
Range weapon was important to hunters as much as melee weapon for melee players. 
---
Shards were not an issue in PVP ..... I mean you would run out of them in duels since everything around was low level but in BG you could just Drain Soul.
---
It takes longer to get rank 11 than it would to just farm 1000 gold.
---
You’re getting 0 balance changes.
---
Duping was in the old ToS too.
---
&gt;  I never implied parents should have the legal right to knock down their adult kid's door and arrest them for taking dirty pictures, but for some reason that is where you people jump to.
---
And I never said that was the root of your argument.
---
Learn to follow nuance in a conversation. Things might evolve past I "i didnt say but you said" jerkfest.
---
Christ.
---
I had a guildy buy the shifting cloak pattern for me. At the time I could sell one for about 1k gold but it was a pain to farm the materials. Skin of shadows was 1 per scholomance run and you needed 4 I believe plus a bunch of other mats. I think I only made 3. Sold them for epic mounts for my two toons and one to pay back my guild mate.
---
quite literally my point. No changes is better than a bunch. It stops being classic after class rebalances.
---
**NOSTALGIA**tm
---
I got the AV ram. Looked really stupid on a human warlock, but it ran pretty fast.
---
I was in a top 100 world guild back in Warlords myself, but different times.
---
I never said TBC balance was perfect. I only said TBC balance was better--class balance only ever got better every expansion. Of course, starting with WotLK, that was because of class homogenization.
---
Ya and so was this. So as long as you are using a bug the other person is unaware of, and gaining some sort of advantage, guess what?
---
"cheats; i.e. methods not expressly authorized by Blizzard, influencing and/or facilitating the gameplay, including exploits of any in-game bugs, and thereby granting you and/or any other user an advantage over other players not using such methods"
---
You’re not raiding as Affliction Warlock. You will be removed from the group on the first pull even if you tried to.
---
On my most recent I completed 1-6 in under 32 minutes
---
I'm glad we made different life choices. Bring on 18+ hours a day for the first two weeks! 😁🤘
---
Private servers heavily nerf most farming spots. So those gold farming videos will be even more relevant in Classic.
---
The bugs OP wants fixed aren't exploits.
---
Loot everything. Sell everything. All those gray items on trash mobs actually add up if you're killing enough stuff.
---
Yes and include Quel’Thalas somehow.
---
I’m between playing Dwarf Paladin or NE Druid and need help deciding... When classic finally launches I’ll be running mostly 5 mans for fun with friends and will be the group’s tank. I am also looking to enjoy other aspects of the game such as casual world pvp and leveling. Not looking to tank raids if I even get that far in the game, and not to interested in the warrior class (just not my cup of tea). Important caveat is that I will be leveling with a friend.  Anyways, I want to see what you guys think would be more fun to roll/the perks either class has to bring to the overall experience of the game?
---
I do hope they make some balance changes at some point. I get the whole #nochanges autism but there are a lot of specs that simply underperform. 
---
Having every spec be at least somewhat viable endgame wouldn't break the game.
---
It’s a little like gay marriage 
---
The people who wants the new models are the gay couples who wants to get married, and the people who doesn’t want it as a toggle is those against gay marriage
---
It doesn’t affect those who are against it if it’s added, but they would still prefer other people being less happy than they could be, because the thing that increases their happiness is something they don’t like, EVEN THO IT DOESN’T AFFECT THEM
---
Warrior named meatshield
---
&gt;I want 'insert spec here' to be viable!
---
Sorry, thats not how classic works.
---
Honestly, I never really looked at them. I could probably not place most. They're cool
---
I don’t get the drama. All the hunter issues will end up being patched. And your gonna have put your time into a toon u didn’t really wanna play.
---
I'll straight up admit it, even though I cringe when thinking about it now;  
---
I bought gold from a Chinese gold-seller.   
---
*From memory* I think it was $20USD for 1000g.
---
What about clever uses of mechanics?
---
I have no bugs in mind, more of a general question. As you can see by the lack of up votes a lot of ppl want the NOCHANGE approach to 1.12 (1.13)
---
I love being an asshole on my rogue toons. Always have.
---
Fantasy wise, a dwarf priest takes the cake for me - Especially with shadow and mind control. I'm hesitant because I've never loved healing and will inevitably end up doing just that in raids
---
Warlocks are great mechanics, ease of leveling, and I want to do the demon quests. I rolled a lock main in bc and have always been a lock main
---
Definitely torn
---
phase 2 afaik.
---
I forgot about the AV Ram! My NELF hunter looked amazing on it!
---
Debuff cap should stay as it was for this cycle. If blizzard wants to restart servers and run a clean classic server alongside a classic+ server this is one of the things I’d want considered.
---
But not for 2019-2021
---
Holy shit
---
Rule of thumb: If you're farming a 1% drop, expect to do ~69 runs.
---
i always thought r11 is just the requirement to still BUY it for 800-900g?
---
Im sorry ok ;-;. Point taken
---
Agreed. If you are not Reck-bombing or doing huge Command crits or something, it's pretty lame. And if you're doing that, then your support ability is weakened quite a bit.
---
Compare that with fear, silence (depending on spec), dispel, mana burn, bubbles, MIND CONTROL, etc. on a Priest... They are squishy for sure, but make up for it with tons of control.
---
Acting like there is only one class people want to play lol
---
Im playing lock and affliction is my favorite tree - still i disagree.
---
Was this Lightbringer server? Eternal reign guild?
---
Hahaha, this is too funny
---
Thanks. 
---
Im not looking to commit to a guild just yet. So ill be looking to fill roster spots for the faster guilds/pserver guilds while they wait for there slower levelers. 
---
You bring up a good point. Early MC verses gold farming. 
---
I know later in phase 2 and onwards priest lasher farms can be pretty good. 
---
Ill be time poor after the first rush (16 days) as ill have to go back to my non neet lifestyle (Job, uni, wife and kid)
---
So ill only have night shifts and my hobby time to play. 
---
With that in mind i have been leaning towards the mage. early Gold can get me far enough into the game where i can raid log and help my priest and gear out my wife with ease. 
---
However, i do fantasize about the idea of being in the first few groups to clear MC.
---
Why is there a space on the horde side. This bothers me :/
---
It doesn't matter. Blizzard fixed bugs all throughout vanilla and was telling people NOT to abuse them. How is abusing bugs of any kind "blizzlike"?
---
The point was not that they haven't done anything of value whatsoever.
---
You're arguing a stawman.
---
I actually would prefer a slower rotation, since rotations where I always have to be pushing buttons kinda overwhelms me.
---
I like the idea of only having to hit buttons every once in a while, and then spending the rest of the time watching my party to figure out when I need to hit them with extra heals, cleanses, or any other utility stuff them might need.
---
How long is trap supposed to last? 20 seconds in PvP?
---
Do they include all of the retcons or are they giving the story from before the WoW retcons?
---
Farming sm armoury and cathedral. On my warrior. I feel like I spent 1/2 my income on food... food a while... I don’t miss that...  that’s why I’m rolling a hunter with a warrior alt I’m gonna play with friends to level... Mara here I come baby!
---
I recently realized that lorewise. There should be no undead priests. 
---
They cant channel holy cause it burns them. And shadow spec is based off the void, which the void avoids undead. 
---
Boom no fosaken priests.
---
Aff locks still worse than DS/Ruin locks even with corruption. Debuff limit has nothing to do with it lmao.
---
makes perfect sense. Destruction like the hand of Gul'dan, affliction like the plagued grain that doomed lordaeron and a corrupted forest like Felwood.
---
I don’t think a class breaking bug like that would go unnoticed for so long. I think it’s intended.
---
The only difference between a bug and an exploit is what Blizzard calls it.
---
They'll either be fixing Classic exploits or banning people that use them or doing nothing.
---
They'll be doing nothing about bugs.
---
Yeah this is somewhat the answer to your issues with damage and healing, but understand your healing throughput will be compromised with this and that it is less than ideal for progression content.
---
Generally this is an issue of wanting to have your cake and eat it too. You can't really do significant DPS while healing. That would be too broken.
---
Druid might actually come the closest to this though, perhaps closer than the ele sham. With just a gear swap and shapeshift you can do OK even specced resto (certainly better than a holy / disc priest could)
---
People want vanilla warts and all.
---
What kind of pleb doesn't keep it in their bags

Took a stupid long time selling herbs, potions, and doing arcanite xmutes. I also had an add-on to find AH items with buyout less than vendor price so I could buy then vendor for a few copper profit. Sounds stupid but I'd say that was a free 3-5g per day with 0 effort. I'd just start a scan when I woke up and check it out when I got out of the shower.
---
Play a Druid then! Tanking is a breeze, and you have a \*lot\* of flexibility in your build/spec. You also won't be slowed down by your tiny mana pool like a Paladin might.
---
Phase 2, and it’s just an option Incase they get tired of farming
---
WoW is and was HUGE in Germany. I know barely anyone who hasn't atleast tried WoW sometime and if they haven't, then they don't care about pc gaming at all.
---
I can hardly imagine being stuck on a server with Spanish, French and italian people being necessary when Germany alone loves the game this much and will have big playernumbers.
---
I bet we're not alone with that. International servers are... Curious, and I'm not a fan of them. Language specific servers are more comfy, convenient and cool to keep the alliteration afloat. Give us language specific servers, Blizz. Comeon!
---
Going oom after 1 fight isn't a huge deal in PVP. It's a much larger deal in PVE. What is your focus?
---
If I remember right they were around 90g each. It may depend on what patch we're talking about because they reversed the riding and mount costs at some point, but I'm not sure that included the pvp mounts.
---
it will be a madhouse
---
Yes you are right. They are different. That's why the TOS says don't exploit bugs. 
---
"cheats; including exploits of any in-game bugs"
---
They will be fixing 1.12 bugs. I guarantee it. They will find stuff that nobody noticed before and just assume it's not working properly and fix it. They aren't going to take the time to make sure it's "classic" every time they encounter something that looks broken.

They weren't removed until BC (I believe in the pre-patch). There was one crazy bastard in my guild back then who was obsessed with rep and maxed out his Wildhammer rep just on the off chance of them having a faction discount on epic flying mounts come BC.

awesome video!
---
It is very easy (and very fun!) to be an spriest pvp asshole, too. Your life in PVE will be much harder but spriests are not unheard of and if you work hard to gear yourself and consume you can make it work. You'll never doing anything better than bottom 50% DPS in a competitive group of raiders, but it's not boomkin or ele/enh shaman levels of laughable.
---
Lol, no.
---
The Freezing Trap + Scatter Shot is not an exploitable bug, it's just a bug.
---
And it won't get fixed because that's how it was for all of 1.12.
---
I feel like Cartman waiting for the Wii release. Anybody wanna help me get into the freezer?
---
Depends how you value your time, $20 to save yourself from potentially hours of boredom makes sense, especially if you could pick up an extra shift at work
---
Different CC classes can stack with one another depending on patch. In this case, Freeze and Disorients. It's not a bug, it's intended as of 1.12.1 and it'll be that way in Classic WoW.
---
The same way Blind and Fear shared DRs in further expansions and then reverted back, same thing with Banish and Cyclone, then with Blind and Cyclone. Then with Sheep and Disorient.
---
They don't have to be in the exact same catecogry to share DRs.
---
Since he's already been exposed, here's a clip of him expressing his intent:
---
 [https://clips.twitch.tv/EmpathicAffluentReindeerAliens](https://clips.twitch.tv/EmpathicAffluentReindeerAliens) 
---
He has mentioned his intent on multiple occasions, but to be honest, over the past few days he has begun to be frustrated because people are genuinely witch-hunting him and saying they're going to "mass report" him on launch simply to ban him for something he's doing on the Beta. And being a streamer, he has to deal with constant hate in his chat from opposing streamers' chat on opposite faction who are rightfully frustrated with what he's doing, but again, its a beta. At the end of the day, people are on the beta to test the game and discover exploits or bugs and bring them to Blizzard's attention - even if that interfere's with a streamer's content, it doesn't make them better than other streamers and give them the right to witch-hunt Stormx for this. Would I be frustrated if I played against this? Absolutely I would; which is why I'm glad he's doing this and exposing these jumps in order for Blizzard to address so that they can decide what's right and wrong about particular jumps and fix those ones before launch.
---
And league, csgo and many other games are toxic as hell. This is only amplified by the occasional person who doesn't speak English or just refuses to do so. 
---
Speaking German exclusively e.g takes a bit of the anonymity out of the game for me and reinforces a feeling of community. Very subjective, won't pretend as if that was a big point that everyone will get, but alas 
---
German WoW has a ton of inside jokes, references and unique quirks that you won't get anywhere else. Y'all don't know Barlow, Jan Hegenberg or Allimania, yet every German wowplayer can quote atleast some of them.
---
International servers bother me quite a bit. We'll have inofficial ones anyway, you're just adding 20-30% confused players who'll have a hard time finding people who speak their language.
---
I never said that scatter shot DR was a bug. I'm not the guy that's advocating for that to be changed.
---
I'm saying if they find out that Onyxia has a bug where she one shots the tank, and it's so rare that nobody noticed it before, and they see it happen? They will more than likely fix it.
---
Yeah man, Druid became my favorite class in TBC, but I remember the second I hit 40 in classic I felt like a beast. Druids have an incredible amount of utility as tanks, I just can’t stand not seeing my gear.
---
Loved healing at 80 too. Still remember my first heroic halls of lightning, that fight was no joke man. Such a crazy experience healing all the way through that xpac. Even had a solo heal on Malygos back when spirit was completely busted. Definitely an experience that stays with me. Good luck tanking in classic! Check our Skarm Tanks videos on YouTube, he has some really good tricks for Druid tanking.
---
I am SO pumped for it. I can't wait for how hectic the initial log on will be. Knowing that we're all starting on a fresh server with no established economy, no high-level characters coming to gank popular questing areas (at least for a few days anyway), and everyone gunning for the world/server first records.
---
I've got a few days of PTO scheduled for the launch, and I know I won't be the only one stockpiling energy drinks :)
---
what is pex phase
---
Doubt it.
---
Like shoppers storming a Wal Mart on Black Friday
---
Getting a big upgrade is always nice. Through corrupt DKP systems I managed to keep losing on Neltharion's Teat on Nost. I think I saw 4 drops and somehow there was always a mage with higher DKP. Then the server closed and Ely started it up again. New warlock, new guild and this time we basically rolled it out instead (which is insane). Naturally I never won the roll and about 5 drops later (so 9 in total) I finally got the damn trinket after being the only core raider without it. I was happy that day. 
---
Two weeks later LH launched a new server and the server I played on was instantly dead so the trinket was essentially useless. 
---
Ugh I'm so tired of private servers! People may complain and whine about layering or AV not being the old version. It's still miles better than a server that can disappeared at any moment, is full of Chinese and Russians who can't communicate in English, and run by anonymous people who steal donation money and sell rank 14 characters and Thunderfuries. In my first WSG at 60 the enemy team had 3 warriors with BREs, and this was like a month after release and they were all from the same guild. 
---
Ugh this evolved into a rant haha.
---
It might be, but it'd be close. With SM you get nightfall and SL as well.
---
I think most of us did tbh!
---
Legion was absolutely terrible when it launched.
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
Yup, strat was give tanks boot speed enchant and have them staggered running around the room, picking up and kiting melee dragons with taunt and sunder armor. Groups would be placed around the room to take care of the ranged dragons, but strategically placed well enough for healers to be in range of kiting tanks. As tanks run by you, healers refresh any hots they have.
---
We had fun with it.
---
Or at least queuing to play Classic WoW
---
you made a lot of sweeping generalizations there, citations please.
---
He tricks a guy to jump off the boat.
---
The amount of layers doesn't matter. It just splits the people up more. More layers is even more resources.
---
So should rogues also be reverted to their OP state that they were in 1.4? 
---
Should Druids have Innervate instead of Swiftmend as their 31-pointer in resto and Hurricane instead of Moonkin Form?
---
Where exactly are you drawing the line? If Blizzard said they'll release the game with 1.12.1 patch data/balacing, then it has to be the 1.12.1 version, and the the "majority of vanilla" version.
---
Joined a guild who had an officer specifically assigned to train newly max levels.  They gave you the run down of dungeons, what gear to aim for, what a rotation was, taught you how to spec etc
---
Well, sure, but if you do this, demonology tree should also be fixed. Also, if we're doing pet scaling, let's do hunters too. But if we do that, we need to give ret pallies a chance. But then druids would be the worst class, so let's give moonkin form a passive 20mp5, with a 8mp5 aura for allies. 
---
Everyone wants something fixed, but adjusting one thing leads to a slippery slope with many changes. That's why people are so adamant about no changes. Not because you don't make a fair point, but because who knows what is next. One of the changes may ruin the game we all desire.
---
So a druid actually has a spec that allows to Tank, DPS and Heal 5 mans and PVP with appropriate gear. Paladins have a spec to either heal/PVP and tank OR ret DPS/PVP.
---
It is MUCH harder to solo level a paladin than a Druid. Druids are like second or third fastest leveling class compared to paladin second slowest. So IF you are considering leveling two characters I would level Paladin with friends and Druid on a side.
---
True. You can use scatter shot on a different target than the one you are trying to trap if you are doing 1vN wPvP.
---
This is my concern haha.
---
Taking a couple of days leave to really enjoy the launch, but I'm worried if there will be massive launch issues or queues that mean the time off is wasted.
---
Joined a group only to get cursed out for not having attunment mind you i was 14 and new to mmorpgs
---
Unpopular opinion: 1H + Shield to level. 
---
\+Don't have to worry about miss chance, you have the same miss rate as a 2H (MH is 9% base - only OH suffers 24% miss)
---
\+Easy to retain racial +5 Skill - Plenty of 1H Axes/Swords/Maces (Orc = Axe | Human = Sword and Mace) 
---
\+Can still use abilities like MS or Bloodthirst when you get them
---
\+Additional stats like stam and spirit 
---
\+Often good survival effects on CoB or Equip
---
\+Can handle a lot more attacks due to block chance
---
\+Flatly inceased physical defence via armour gains
---
\+Helps offset Zerker stance 10% physical damage taken (If that's what you want to do)
---
\-Less damage resulting in slower time to clear
---
\-Wouldn't suggest using in dungeons, probably best to maintain a 2H so people don't look at you weird
---
\-Not as cool aesthetic as big boiz like WW axe 
---
\-Not going to do nuclear crits like a 2H will
---
&gt; If it's possible to verify that this was ONLY bugged in patch 1.12 and wasn't bugged for the rest of the vanilla lifetime, I think you might have an argument.
---
It's not a bug
---
Yeah but this one is not a bug.
---
I had a krol blade drop for me off a bat in EPL.  I was so pumped lol.  I was a hunter so I didnt feel bad about selling it
---
I never did on my own.  Eventually borrowed 500g from a mage guild mate for it, and I never paid him back.
---
If he comes back and plays classic I'm fucked.
---
Oh yea well watch this
---
Because the only way to fix it, is to not have it at all.
---
So I guess this is this week's topic? Fucking hell.
---
Not at all. Until recently it was my first choice class / role for Classic. My issue with druid tanks is just that it requires a fair bit of work to get the gear required to make them worth it for most content. Farming AB / WSG rep, farming MCPs, trying to get "of the monkey" slaghide gloves, buying a warden staff, etc. There are also generally fewer pieces that drop for feral tanking. Doing druid tank to an equivalent level of effectiveness to a warrior tank requires a lot more work and planning. Add onto that the nerfs that seem to be on the table for classic, and it's really not a class/role for amateurs or someone who isn't invested in it 100%. I have also observed the state of feral tanking on pservers for the lifespan of a pserver, and witnessed precisely ONE feral make it from MC to KT without quitting. It's a lot of work and not really something I would recommend to someone who isn't already dead set on it.
---
so awesome. didn’t they do a aq40 one too?
---
Go Human Warrior so you can get priority on Ironfoe and speak Dwarven! If you go Dwarven, your BiS list shrinks drastically and can't include 1H Maces *or* any 2H Weapons. :&lt;
---
True. From there I can solo some higher level mins easy. I also know where all the supposed locations are for each mob.
---
JUST
---
REMOVE
---
LAYERING
---
 It was definitely around in BC. Maybe not vanilla though. I can't say for sure.
---
MC attunement wasn't a thing until ~15 weeks into the game, by then we knew to read patch notes.
---
You’re a sophist.
---
Alliance Warlock is the hardest class to PVP on. 30% (statistically undead) of your enemies have a fear/charm break and a 5 sec immunity. There is a reason why Alliance warlock on PVP server is so easy to get a raid spot, no competition.
---
Dwarf priest is BIS among all priests.
---
Everquest Progression servers added this as well.  It was a 5 minute timer and you couldn't change layers (pick zones) during combat.
---
It helped.
---
These are good changes.
---
Yeah, I think everyone let at least one raid down and lost respect. After that I got attuned to everything available ASAP.
---
I got the title in BC. May not have been present in vanilla tho.
---
As far as I'm aware, you will only be crushed by a mob 3 or more levels higher than you, so you don't have to worry about trash
---
I've read a lot of conflicting information about block/hit/crit interactions on the hit table
---
Here's what I understand:
---
Blocks don't push crits off the table because you can still block crits. There's some extra roll or calculation there I'm a bit fuzzy on (in order for a hit to be counted as both a block and a crit), but i'll just go with that. 
---
Defense skill doesn't actually push crits off the table in the normal sense, but instead directly reduces the chance of a boss critting you from 5.6% down to 0% from 300-440 by converting those crits into regular hits/crushing blows, which *can* be pushed off the table by shield block.
---
You won't be hitting buttons every once in a while -- you will be hitting them constantly as flash of light is a quick-casting heal and you will need to be rebuffing every member of your raid constantly and individually.
---
Just like Fear and Seduce are grouped together even tho they have different categories.
---
It's a balancing change, not a bug.
---
Interesting.  Thanks for that insight
---
By what standard?  The game was playable right off the bat, unlike WoD where you literally couldn't even zone in and play the fucking new zones.
---
Its a water bottle and a capri sun packet. Same exact thing just done a little differently.
---
On W10
---
press windows key+shift +s
---
profit more
---
Because people have waited years for this? They want as close to a 100% recreation of the game they loved? All this shit like layering (whether you agree with it or not) is not part of that recreation.
---
You played it wrong it seems
---
as a warlock:
---
no. fuck off
---
I could do with less of that north guy.
---
that would be an amazing idea, an alliance alternative of RFC in orgrimmar, but in Ironforge which is also the capital of the alliance and since alliance have no very low level dungeon like RFC its the best thing to do tbh
---
I actually like Vanilla's balance. It gives consequences to decisions. Hunters and Druids are underpowered but they're both amazing solo and are good casual classes. Warriors are one of the best classes in 5 mans, raids and BGs but are gimp solo. Mages got lucky, they're good all round.  
---
I disliked dailies but the real downside to TBC was "catering to casuals". Free arena gear, epics for everyone, etc. The best part of Vanilla was having people to look up to and want to be like.
---
And layering is because of complainers who don't want to wait a few minutes to tag quest mobs.
---
Debuff duration on enemy targets, so you know if you have to reapply it in the near future
---
Raid logging is actually easy for a priest IMO. You have fewer consumes than most classes and your tier gear is pretty decent. Healers also tend to be less gear dependent in general. This means you won't be needing to run random  dungeons on repeat to farm your gear to be competitive (mage t1 sucks!) and you will generally face less competition for that gear when it does pop up. Something to consider...
---
(And yeah, lasher farming for priests is ez. Just need to wait for DM to come out :-/)
---
You will wear dresses most of your paladin life.
---
turns out backpeddle is slower than running
---
news at 11
---
&gt; All I'm claiming is that 1.12 isn't representative of Vanilla, since Vanilla is all those patches.
---
And that's where you are wrong.  All of it is representative of Vanilla.  1.12 more than all of them, because that was the final Vanilla product.  If it was that way in the version they are working from, then you should expect it to be that way, and you saying "it wasn't like that in vanilla" is wrong.
---
&gt; It was bugged in 1.12 and never caught before TBC.
---
Not bugged. Changed. It was intentional
---
You sound charming.
---
Lots of weasel words used in your statement here.
---
 **Weasel word**. ... A **weasel word**, or anonymous authority, is an informal term **for words** and **phrases**  such as "researchers believe" and "most people think" which make  arguments appear specific or meaningful, even though these terms are at  best ambiguous and vague. 
---
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel\_word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_word)
---
&gt; And I never said that had anything to do with your argument. 
---
I was making a point, I know you didn't say that, but you made a defense against that statement which I never said
---
&gt; Why are you continuously failing to respond to my main statement and creating imaginary talking points? 
---
Because your main statement comes down to a value judgement turned into a normative claim made by you, in other words you made a leap from "is" to "ought" which is where the big issue is, you don't realize you are defending your own personal opinion. Honestly I don't even remember the original point as much as I have just followed your irrational replies.
---
&gt; Learn to follow nuance in a conversation. Things might evolve past a  pseudointellectual-tier "i didnt say but you said" jerkfest. 
---
I never said I was that smart to begin with, nuance = weasel, be clear and specific so you don't slide by things you want to protect emotionally.
---
&gt; If you did that you would realize **the point of contention shouldn't have  been what your social perception of the issue was**, **but merely that I  made a statement that respect of your kids individuality and ability** to  make their own decisions holds priority over your desire to step in when  they are adults and intervene. That's it. **You went on an unrelated  tangent about the morality of the actions. Not even the parenting  strategy itself.** 
---
"I merely said to ignore your moral values, while preaching my own moral values of respecting your kids individuality and ability, did I mention I play underwater 7D CHESS for fun?"
---
So now I see why you had to insult my intelligence earlier, you are self conscience about it. You wouldn't be making arguments this fucking badly constructed if you knew better.
---
Why is your moral preference for non-intervention superior to mine, and if it is, do you apply it universally or just when you feel like it? I don't think I appealed to morality at least not in a vacuum, the problem is people who make bad decisions usually end up having to pick up the pieces to some extent, and when they burden others that is where you are aloud to go back to the beginning and question the first act itself. Most people aren't bursting at the seams to tell people they sell pictures of themselves naked, that's a hint I think.
---
&gt; Creating these imaginary arguments for me is really cute though, you're trying! 
---
Yeah I never took a college course on debate or philosophy so it's good practice for me to get around the internet talking to people and trying to learn better ways of thinking. I concede it's cute for you and I have to put in more effort.
---
Multiple planes of existence in a game about magic isn't immersion breaking.  We are literally talking about a game with portals to different worlds, and **time travel**.  We're going back in time due to Chromie's device.  Layering only breaks your immersion if you want it to.
---
I really love the Agamand Mills quest line. I still remember the first time rolling an undead warlock (inspired by the opening trailer) from more than a decade ago! This quest line has cemented my love for the forsaken storyline and I can't wait to do it once again (the open stress test was *not* enough!)  
---
Hope there are some other Forsaken lovers here as well. Do you have any other favorite quest lines?
---
What about Fear and Charm?
---
Friend gave me the last 300 or so gold I needed in exchange for cloudkeeper legplates.
---
Nope, because blizzard won't allow it.  They will fix it.  sry QQ
---
Has it really been that bad lol? I’ve seen the layering posts as well bugs (most notably on hunters), but I haven’t seen anyone say things like they will go back to private servers or mention activision on this sub in a long time. People are on panic mode because the anticipation makes people overthink things about the game. Once the game comes out, I am almost certain people won’t be as “afraid” (for a lack of better word) about the forthcoming of the game.
---
We’ll have to agree to disagree - I find North really compelling as a guest, he’s funny, talkative, well spoken and I love his passion! He makes it a breeze to chat with him.
---
nope.  Blizz will fix it.
---
fighter of the night man
---
Before phase 1 eh? I too look forward to phase 0.
---
Why is that? This would help my decision considering my main in TBC was a female human warlock. Is it because there's less competition for the warlock's raid role (imp, healthstone, curse)?
---
Well, good players did anyway :P
---
Mage rogue or hunter for your cc and Burn down
---
I was one of the only reliable healers in my guild, so they bought it for me.
---
I feel like if it was worth anything, someone on some private server somewhere would have made a meta out of it. 
---
I'd suggest starting with some ele shaman pieces, add the power, do some math with the formulas and see if it's even worth attempting. You can probably get the pre-bis gear pretty easy. I'd be interested to see the results, both of the math and if you actually build it.
---
Actually I don't care about racism, personally. I am a libertarian and a minority, and I've been the victim of probably half a dozen if not more incidents of racial discrimination and/or crimes. I do lead with that question a lot because the shock in people is funny.
---
Here is a story of a man who committed an act of heroism.

---
Oh man. Jealous...What a way to ding 60...
---
Getting clarification from bliz on this subject matter would be ideal. However bliz in all likelihood will not acknowledge this bug and claim all bugs are working as intended.
---
Wether or not it was added after patch x.xx or since it’s inception. No one can find any direct evidence, besides personal experience or circumstantial evidence of videos from patch x.xx.
---
My hot take is if Hunter’s have to deal with DR’s, then decrease the range or window of leeway.  Ideally I would want no DR or leeway but as it stands #nochanges.
---
2 months to go will assess the situation and make the  appropriate decision then.
---
Get kicked too? :P
---
Every other class: paintings
---
Paladins: screenshots
---
Again, thats just so far off. Multiple planes of existence on Azeroth that we interact with is not even remotely close to a fantasy element. I don't even care about layering too much so long as it's over and done with really fast. But saying layering is a fantasy element, just like every other fantasy element in the game that is supernatural is insane.
---
lol
---
I tell myself it was my first DLC purchase
---
Nice, is it instead level 70 for the questing zones? Would love to give it a go
---
I thought we were supposed to name the dungeon after the last boss in the dungeon. That's logical right?
---
too bad if you wanna raid with the best you gotta be the best
---
Yeah I absolutely did play. You act like hunters were the only class affected by changes like weapon normalization. Freezing trap did share dr with scatter shot for almost half the length of the Classic. It was most likely not bugged, but intended by Blizzard with the Freezing trap dr change.
---
You should let her decide the class for herself
---
I'm saying it doesn't have to break your immersion unless you want it to.  If you can justify someone vanishing from right before you to go into a battleground, you can justify them being out in the world where you can't see them.
---
More clickbait.
---
Pass.
---
How did you deviate from Joanna's guide? Which parts did you improve on?
---
&gt;The best part of Vanilla was having people to look up to and want to be like.
---
I'm not sure what you mean by this, as though this wasn't a thing in TBC. I started playing in vanilla, but didn't care much for competitive until I was doing Heroic Mechanar, and for some reason we had this guy from our local top guild The Logical Cub in our team. He just melted everything. He was decked in Tier 6, lightning zapping everywhere, and I was just left dumbfounded at the idea that our three DPS (I was the healer) were completely and utterly unnecessary. I was then inspired to be like him, and I somehow actually managed to beat Teron Gorefiend before WotLK came out (I was 11 and a half years old!).
---
I was always excited to see one of their players in Shattrath. I also started learning a bit about who the top guilds are. I learned Play Out was the Horde guild leading the charge on the other side, and it was exhilerating to see them, strolling about in their Tier 6, or the crazed yelling in Trade chat when Deus managed to take down Archimonde.
---
Vanilla **absolutely** had people to look up to, and 'epics for everyone' is not very correct. Epic badge gear was ludicrously time gated, and only end bosses of heroics dropped like a total of 3 epic items, there was nowhere near enough epics to even have half your gear epic. Welfare epics started with WotLK, not TBC.
---
Sounds good. I'm glad you kept an archive of things I said back when I was 12 years old. Must have had a profound effect on your life lmao
---
Aye. I'm having a really hard time finding any truly valid data on it so far considering how obscure and unusual of a build it is on top of being over a decade ago. Looking at AQ/Naxx gear, 440ap, 27%crit on arcane, 530 or so spell damage bonus. Not sure it's worth the drop in everything else looking at the stats, but it makes me wonder how it would effect arcane shot in the end.
---
I'm actually in tears this was amazing
---
Cool list, looks useful
---
My old guild mate was a farming expert. He farmed mats for the AH for his and his wife’s epic mounts. 
---
The week TBC patch dropped he gifted me with the few hundred gold I needed to get 100% mount speed. 
---
We were both hunters.

LUL... Uldaman wasn’t until WotLK nub. 
---
(Sorry, I had to).
---
Always loved Grim Batol! Cataclysm gets a lot of shit but it had some amazing dungeons.
---
Layering supposedly means there won’t be queues sooo
---
Never take first launch day off for an mmo. Always wait a day or two for everything to settle down.
---
I bored my scepter earlier. Does that count?
---
Phase 3 afaik
---
We were told we are getting a game that is close to the authentic experience as possible. You suggest they go back on that word and fuck with everything right before launch?
---
You’re not only selfish, but you’re also delusional. 
---
We want to play Classic, not KindaClassic.
---
It was actually very cool.  I returned the favor in tbc in the same guild because of how much I liked it.
---
While they’re at it give moonkins, elemental shaman, and shadow priests a 50% mana gen while casting talent so they can raid at the top end.   And enhancement shaman could use some threat lowering to do more than Nightmare proc. Oh andPaladins could use some tanking buffs...  and warriors and rogues could use some self-heals for solo play. 
---
I don’t think we need to start going down that path lol
---
What happened to the daily "X days left" threads? Those were hype. Are the mods deleting those?
---
I get off work just an hour before launch. I cant wait. Took off the 3rd week after launch though to let some of the initial surge die down. So hopefully will be close to 60 within the first month!
---
phase 2 yes, but i think the highest theorized rank you could get with just world pvp is rank 11 (i think swifty mathed this out?) and that would probably require an epic mount to achieve anyway.
---
The closer it gets, the longer it seems to take... So much time has passed since it's announcement. I wasn't checking the countdown clock at all at first but the past few weeks I've been looking at it every other day.
---
we will get the old mount system and im pretty sure the war mounts will cost 800g then (20% discount included)
---
20g for Riding a race-specific mount (horse/tiger/kodo etc, need exalted if not your own race)
---
80g for 60% mount
---
1000g for 100% mount.
---
Not few, several, maybe even an hour. Launch will have 100s of players at the starting zone at same time.  
---
I've played on private server post launch by several months, and I've still spent 30-60min on single quest because everyone is competing for mob tag.
---
TLDW:  streamers get camped.  Such news
---
I was a quest-a-holic. I made it my mission to hunt down and complete every single quest in the game. Turns out you actually get quite a lot of gold from quests, especially once you're 60 and all the extra XP gets converted into gold.
---
Questing gold alone got me more than halfway there. For the rest I typically farmed dungeons (I mained Resto Druid so solo farming wasn't very efficient). I remember doing a ton of Strat Live and selling the Righteous Orbs. And I would go farm Larval Acid in EPL while waiting for the group to form.
---
There was a decent sized time where they had not yet added paragon boxes in bfa.
---
FF7 on Xbox one

Hated farming. Organized battlegrounds till rank 11.

No need to go all ad hominem. 11 years in telecom fraud control for businesses. I stopped fraud, millions of dollars of it, and coordinated with other telcos to shut down fraud rings as well as international terrorist money laundering.
---
Your argument is an irrefutible one because of how you have designed it. That's not a compliment, mind you. You're setting up a "you're bad if you don't agree" situation. Weaksauce, and really easy for anyone making such an argument to just keep coming back over and over.
---
You apparently know just enough about human psychology to embarrass yourself, but not enough about fraud to know that *it does not stop.* The solution, without ruining the economy, is to actively mitigate it like I did for a decade, but that's expensive.
---
Oops, was that ad hominem? I like to think I am just analyzing you.
---
Now, again, if you have any suggestions on what Blizz could do other than wow tokens, since you suggested that was a false dichotomy with gold sellers, I always accept knew ideas and knowledge. You could win me over. You're only intent upon destroying me.
---
The correct way to deal with streamers
---
helm of narv dropped, sold for like 300g?
---
one week later
---
lion horn of stormwind in UBRS, rolled and beat 14 other people, somehow sold this piece of shit for 700g i kid you not.  
---
literally the only reason i got one
---
Grinded exaulted with frostwolf, won a greed role for backstab's highest rank in a UBRS run and sold it to a rogue with thunderfury in full T2 for 650 gold and bought the frostwolf mount.
---
 Pretty easy no luck involved.
---
What exactly happens at rank 11?
---
You get access to pvp mounts which were like 100g or something.
---
Clearly you can understand in the slightest what i'm saying. So i'm done. You win I guess, fucking hell.
---
Nope, they said they will keep it nochanges.
---
Don't forget the loss of dps from wasting inner focus as well. I don't think DP crits, so when you use it for the mana savings you're cost yourself a crit mindblast 1 in 4 casts.
---
Shadowguard scales much better with gear, too.
---
Lastly, if DP resists (and it does) it can be as decisive a factor in you *losing* a pvp encounter as it can be in helping you win one.
---
Crazy idea but instead of all these problems and solutions going back and forth what if we just had some kind of persistent server that everyone played on and there wasn't multiple versions of it. I'm surprised nobody has done it before.
---
I got it...in WotLK. But obviously the gates had been open for a very long time. 
---
In terms of getting it in a relevant time, you basically need the head to start the quest within your first two possible BWL runs after the AQ patch drops. After that, probably too late. Then you need a lot of people willing to help those two people, because you need a lot of farming then a lot of world bosses. Also, you've got a crapload of others on the server in the same shoes. Finally, once the server gong goers become known, they coordinate to wait until a few people get it before they ring that gong. Anyone who does it within 10 hours of the first gets their mount and glory. As per typical online interactions, that pact to wait was a lie and the very first person to get it rings it as soon as they physically fucking can, based on your server with the war effort. Lots of people get pissed and generally only 2 to 3 people in an entire server get the mount. Also, say goodbye to your social life for a few weeks.
---
Good luck. We're all counting on you.

Ah but not all of it because battlegrounds and the associated gear vendors will release between phases 3 and 4.

Thank you!

I mean, I think if you're looking at Naxx gear for it just call it out. I'd look for relevance in MC, Ony, AQ20, ZG, UBRS, rep, crafting, and dungeons. If it can't work with that lower tier of gear, it probably won't ever work. But I'm a pessimist, so that's my thought.
---
Torn between mage and shaman... I’m going to be playing solo more often than not and I’m more interested in BGs over raids... how much more difficult is it to play shaman than it is to play mage?
---
Is layering to stop queues? I assumed it was more to fix the same issue as dynamic, meaning too many players for the spawns.
---
Guy pops all CDs on low health/low mana people for 10 minutes.
---
Huh, that's not as shitty as I expected.
---
It's pretty funny, they go around ganking people and talking shit all the time. Yet when it happens to them they cry and bitch throw a big fit. Much cringe, such wow.
---
Its survival was such a huge retcon. The whole idea is that Kael'thas took his people with Illidan to Outland as none could survive. Quel'thalas was assumed to be a forsaken wasteland devoid of life. It should have been the culmination of the efforts of the Argent Dawn in the Eastern Kingdoms.

Source?

Do you wanna be a shitty stun rogue or an epic powerhouse warrior that everyone looks up to?.... but seriously I hate rogues on the opposite faction... and here recently I hate rogues on my own faction as well 😂

I live there, yeah

Original Vanilla Player &gt; Classic Beta Player

Preparing for classic. Basically draining the corpses of 10-15 adult males since they yield the greatest amount of blood. Better to do it now then during classic.
---
Forgot to mention im a vampire lol! Otherwise it would just be concerning.
---
Probably won't if the no changes crowd gets their way...Might as well save the 15$ and play on a private server. 15$ isn't worth slightly prettier graphics.
---
Why do you hate rogues?
---
Apparently everyone seems to think so. But they might be overthinking it.
---
As a pampered hunter main, with mage on the side...
---
Warrior leveling is a big enough pain to tip the scales.
---
I think most people learned from chat when people were LFM for the attunement quests or mentioning being attuned for whatever raid they were recruiting for.
---
Yeah.
---
Not a lvl 1-20 spot
---
Sorry english lvl too high for me but i think i know what you mean.
---
Paladin+Warrior combo is really good
---
This guy gets answers.
---
i dont see why rank12+ shouldnt be achievable just with worldpvp? 
---
Being the player with the most CP on your faction every week for 12 weeks = r14. There will be definitely enough people in the pool for the top bracket to exist aswell.
---
Or is he arguing that phase2 will hit after 6 weeks so nobody can get to r12 even while being #1 every week?
---
lol 26 amazing pieces of concept art and a single, barely edited, photo of the in-game graphics lol
---
I wonder which class/spec that one's from.
---
Choose Rogue unless you are okay with  
---
\-No way of dropping threat  
---
\-Your cool one-handed weapons you get are worthless in pvp
---
\-Expensive repairs  
---
\- taking a long time to get geared as you are fighting for drops with warriors and rogues.
---
Yes, warriors are easier to gear up pre-bis. You tank dungeons and tell rogues they're not allowed. You also get to rock 2h weapons. A lot of people shit on 2h weapons, but that just means you get less competition and get that gear faster. Rocking a BRE when everyone is fighting for 1h weapons will give you an early headstart until AQ or Naxx or never.
---
I've played both in vanilla, but the rogue was the main. Everyone says the fury warrior does better damage but I never saw it once while in vanilla. However, we still had DPS warriors and we still had rogues. There was always places for skilled and willing players. 
---
Play what seems the most fun to you, or both.
---
I do genuinely believe you've drawn a large number of assumptions from my post, and i've noticed the trend from your very first reply.
---
I do appreciate what i've learned from you but I think you're horribly off base. I think if you were looking for a rational discussion to begin with you wouldn't have replied the way you did to begin with.
---
Keep in mind this has solely stemmed from me saying I would give my kid the ability to make their own decisions once they are an adult. Please remember you directly replied to that with this:
---
&gt;Because sex workers have such good life outcomes? If she wanted to be a professional meth smoker would you support her? What happened to home maker, doctor, secretary, veterinarian, or chef?
---
Off of me saying my child (an adult) is allowed to do what they want. To clarify this isn't me saying I don't care, and this isn't me saying I support them for being a drug dealer. I clarified in another thread when I said that if they were to come to me for support, I would then do my best to do so as their parent.
---
I can count the number of times you have made assumptions or flat out said I have said or implied something when that was never the case in this post almost on two hands. This is genuinely ridiculous and I get the mental image of you arguing with a clone made our of air that seems to be shouting completely different things back at you.
---
I've been in a huge number of humbling, and genuinely engaging discussions. None of them have come even remotely close in the raw amounts of assumptions and arguments against parts of my opinion that aren't even directly related to anything I have said.
---
You've genuinely lost me on your weasel word bit. I'm familiar with your term. But it sounds to me that you're looking for complete objective clarity on every statement. Me leaving something out (intentionally or otherwise) isn't me using a weasel word when you are targeting something that was definitive to begin with.
---
Targeting an assumption you've made from someones argument and the person replying "dude, that's not what i'm saying" isn't them being a weasel, it's just you not following the discussion. It's coming off as a disruptive crutch at best and it's the first time I've seen someone try to rely on it so heavily.
---
It doesn't read right, and I don't buy it.
---
Yea, I’ll accept a blue post before the word of a mediocre conartist.
---
yes, but you get the mount from the general pvp vendors in the instanced vendor hall in OG/SW, these arent battleground vendors
---
Definitely gaslighting.
---
The power of Ret!
---
Man, I really should've paid more attention to chat. XD
---
SL is a purely PVP talent (outside of twin emps tanking I guess, but it's not mandatory for that either). You definitely don't grab it for a PVE spec.
---
Not changed. Bugged. It wasn't intentional.
---
Thanks for clarifying.
---
That's the real hole in people's "Classic+" desires. It's not sustainable without introducing catch-up mechanics that would be hugely unpopular.
---
gaslighting = literally what you wrote
---
Right, I understand.
---
That is a lot of SP. Is Arcane shot just flat 183 damage?
---
One hander + shield solves both of your problems, hitchance and low swing speed.
---
People overestimate spirit stacking, you shouldn't stack spirit, just don't avoid spirit gear (people in dungeons will "love" it), but it gives you a very minor benefit in form of ooc regen which is easily replaced by bandages and/or food, while also increasing your "in combat" by reducing your AP (which makes it harder to fight asspulls or even just two mobs)
---
Regardless of my personal fan base or lack of fan base (the latter is VERY much assumed), I will personally be streaming during the bulk of the first week of WoW Classic.
---
With that said... those who endorse/follow, or incorporate their own experiences of the game with streamers... will ultimately uncover an unsatisfactory result of how they are treated and what they ultimately have accomplished when it comes to the game itself. In other words.. time wasted on social things, negates from tangible progression in the game.
---
As per a direct comment on the picture that was posted... it's pharked. Those who play the beta currently aren't contributing to Blizzard, but are instead contributing towards Asmongold. The "goal" of a beta isn't being met... such that the goal is to provide explicit evidence and advice towards Blizzard about inaccuracies and glitches.
---
Incorrect. The thing is. You're weird. Deadmines is DM. "DM East" "DM West" is the correct way !
---
Camping Soda is natural cause he brags about corpse-camping and "being an asshole" 
---
But what did Payo do?
---
I'm avoiding streamer servers like the Plague, but Classic has a code of conduct, even for streamers this is extreme. (For Beta I think it's warranted and funny, but during actual release this would be extreme)
---
Leveling a rogue is much easier than a warrior.
---
PVP in a PVE spec is much more effective as a rogue than a warrior.
---
Farming gold as a rogue is much easier than as a warrior.
---
Warriors barely stand a chance against all other classes without a healer.
---
Rogues aren't very effective in BGs.
---
Repair costs are much higher for a warrior than a rogue.
---
Warriors have no threat reset or reduction like a rogue.
---
Warrior DPS is slightly more difficult to gear up than a rogue.
---
If you don't tank at all, you'll have slightly more difficult time finding dungeon groups than a rogue.
---
I like how everyone just says "no".
---
No argument, no reasoning. Just "no".
---
I guess there are no arguments or reasoning then. Change away.
---
This is literally attempting to gate-keep discussion.
---
I'm an expert on the topic and can confirm its perfectly fine. 
---
Source: the other rogue behind you
---
Haha, on est la risée de tous putain, on fait quoi maintenant? "Bâton de la mort" ?
---
Personally I don't dislike streamers, but there are some individuals who happen to stream that are ragey shit-talkers like Payo and newbie-campers like Sodapoppin, so it's funny to see them get ganked over and over.
---
Thanks for the reply!
---
If you want to be a DPS / OT hybrid when it is necessary to the guild roll warrior.
---
If you only want to DPS, nothing else, roll Rogue.
---
If you like BGs more than world PvP, roll Warrior.
---
If you like ganking or world PvP more than BGs, roll Rogue.
---
Now that we can agree on. They're underestimating their own game, to the extent of preparing everything for a big launch and a tiny long-term population...
---
This is only the beginning.
---
I also was willing to give them another chance. They immediately proved me wrong with their cashgrab mentality regarding beta event timing. As much as I want classic to succeed, the woe seems to be between Blizz upper management, the brain drain when they cut salaries (a lot of the talent left) and the remaining team working in an environment of fear/unrealistic expectations.
---
If they continue like this, we won't have Blizzard for that much longer.
---
I act that way? I hardly think so, "no-lifing" is highly subjective. Some people see No lifers as those who can spend a full-time jobs worth of hours playing. Other people see "no-lifers" as someone who just has 15 hours a week to play. Some people may even see "no lifers" as someone who can manage to play every night even if just for an hour. It all depends on that person's point of view.
---
I believe I mentioned twice that I'm neither for nor against buying/selling gold.
---
I'm just looking at it from a devil's advocate point of view, some people spend copious amounts of time that the average player cannot to gain gold/gear in the game. So logically there will be people with copious amounts of money that the average player doesn't have to gain gold/gear in the game.
---
Time is Money and Money is just Time spent.
---
If someone makes $50/hr they may not want to spend 3 hours farming gold because they may only have 3 hours a week to play. Their Time is worth more than the Money they would spend to avoid the farm and instead play those Dungeons or WPvP you mentioned.
---
That's how they justify it and I can understand and even relate to that. (That doesn't mean I agree with it)
---
I do however fail to see how it "ruins" the game for you or anyone, if that ruins the game for you than by that logic the "no lifer" that can spend 50+ hours a week playing should also ruin the game.
---
&gt; Obviously the bugs and exploits should be fixed. The only people that will disagree are the shitters from the pirated realms that abuse the exploits constantly.

See, most people would think I'm some kind of french-only person to be interested in that. Truth is I speak 4 languages, and play in english mostly just like you, but even so it's a bad choice to force people into this way of playing... 
---
That does make sense in a way, very sad if that's the reason for it happening that way !
---
Layering let's more people on the server at the same time, thus effectively eliminating queue times. The more players, the more layers.
---
This is exactly what I'd like to see.  There are a ton of gaps that could be covered with dungeons instead of just throwing out more 60+ content.  
---
More varied high end and post-Naxx content would be awesome, but the best way for a theoretical WoW Classic+ to survive is by adding varied content that the majority of the playerbase will be able to experience.

Anger management is worth tactical mastery. Ability to generate rage, swap stances, maintain rage after leaving combat when blood rage is down

It's known that swearing can originate in the limbic system, which is responsible for more primitive thoughts and actions.  And hearing it can activate the same part of the brain, even if the person speaking didn't use that.  It can be distracting and discordant to have someone alert your primitive side when you're trying to get to know them.
---
What counts as rude is a little nebulous, but if you think about the terms you find people dancing around, you can size them up.
---
You can see some in the newspaper.  'Cancer' is avoided by saying "a long illness".  People maybe don't 'die', they "pass away".  And respectable people can't kill themselves, but they may take their own lives.
---
Others are more quotidian.  If someone says they're going to the bathroom, do you supposed they are just walking into the room and walking out?
---
Somebody said that a lot of podcasts have swearing, and I don't doubt it.  Howard Stern figured out that he could get attention by intentionally avoiding euphemisms that most people would use most of the time.  And that's really the point of his show, is to 'shock' your brain.  For me, the other positive points of the show get drowned out.
---
The phrase 'shitting on' was used in the joking sense early on in the podcast, but by people I didn't really know.  It was as jarring to me as if the speaker was saying it to a new interview subject that they didn't know well.  Imagine if the first interview question was "Welcome, [former Blizzard artist], how do you react when people shit on your work?"
---
Not saying it doesn't do that. I'm asking about the intent.
---
I’m pvp I just am stunned for 25 seconds and then I’m dead 😵 probably just the classes I play but god damn do I hate them!
---
Yes. It only scales with spell power. And I believe it uses your spell crit chance.
---
That doesn't stop people from trying their hardest to get close to cap pre raid which ends up  having them substitute other more important stats.
---
Good, because I definitely don't anymore. Can you help me?
---
I read recently that quest line in Elwynn Forest "Jasperlode Mines" which ends abruptly after one quest, was originally going to be a low level dungeon for Alliance before the idea was scraped for whatever reasons.
---
It's sounds soooo satisfying to open lol I can't wait.
---
&gt; (everyone will just use addon anyway)
---
This is really the correct answer. If "everyone" will use an add-on for it anyway, it should be in the game by default.
---
I got answers to all that:
---
PvP servers could be fine with one language for all. PvE though, could be better with language specific servers, to allow for people to find guildies more easily and all. RP servers will have less people interested, so it makes sense to have international servers, but it makes it hard to RP for non-english speakers. So that way, you just have to add one server per language, for PvE for french and german, so that people don't end up on their unofficial server.
---
Second, your point about other games is both valid and not legit. Sure we play most games in english, but that's because it's easy to deal with english for those. In League, you sa
---
Do you like stealth/stealing/being sneaky?
---
This is brilliant if applied to all classes. Would make for awesome pvp
---
I would say on most US servers it switched from VC to DM in wrath or cata.
---
I am planning on playing a tauren druid. Is there any real advantage so far on beta to go FEMALE over MALE? Or are there even some advantages to going male such as a larger melee range when playing feral? Or is the only advantage to going FEMALE truly to squeeze through holes in random places throughout the world and BGS?
---
It's a sign of respect.
---
Just remove layering already...
---
You're need to read up on Prot Warrior then.
---
Agi is a priority stat for a Prot Warrior just below Hit and just above Str.
---
Armor, Mid, Avoidance, Crit, Attack Power. Literally everything a tank wants.
---
Shit, in early SWG if you were a Jedi and died three times your character was deleted forever lol.

Don't forget this one:  
---
Do you want a ton of T3 tokens in Naxx, or do you want 0 T3 tokens in Naxx?  
---
RIP rogues
---
I'm still waiting on my Cat Form Questline and Air Totem Questlines
---
what do you mean rogues were op in 1.4! how so
---
&gt;"I sorta held down Kurzen's Compound, but really it was just one of several dimensions.
---
So I've heard this before, but I'm not really sure I understand it. Couldn't you make the same argument about other realms? You always know other versions of the compound exist. It's an unavoidable part of being a human playing a game. To immerse yourself in the game is to ignore the other thousands or millions of players playing a different version of the exact same content and pretend like yours and the other players' versions of things around you are the version that maters. 
---
&gt;It also robs those other-layered Alliance, in this hypothetical, of later encountering the same undead rogue and saying, "that damn guy, I remember him from Stranglethorn Vale!"
---
I see how you could see less of the same people leveling if you were put on different layers from day to day. Do we have any idea if this is how it will work? With realms in one time zone, I always thought people would like be on similar layers day to day as they logged on.  If (I'm hoping for this to be when) layering goes away, you'll still see those people assuming they're still playing though, right?
---
&gt;So layering makes for bad storytelling
---
I think this is pretty subjective. While seeing the same people while leveling happened, I do not think storytelling needs to be reliant on this, nor do I think it happened as often as everyone is suggesting. I'm also confused how storytelling would be good when there's 12,000 people in the starting 6 zones standing around waiting for the same 10 plainstriders to respawn.
---
Not saying layering is perfect, good, or better than dynamic respawns. I have just not been able to wrap my head around the insistence that layering is horrific that a lot (not necessarily you) have been screaming about.
---
&gt; Any predictions for how the launch will go?             
---
               
---
Well everyone finds value in different aspects of WoW, some will race to server first 60, others will try to rig the auction house and a lot will sneak into contested areas for some good time gankings. Me? I'll take my sweet time getting up to lvl 18, hang out in Westfall and throw heals on people struggling to do the defias escort or help find the messenger for others.           
---
            
---
I wont get to 60 and raiding in the first month, I wont make a fortune or become twitch famous as a master STV ganker but I hope to meet a few chill peeps and offer a helping hands to any that need it.
---
Indeed, would be a shit surprise to discover you're on a german server after leveling it all...
---
The biggest issue will be the reputation grind. You need to farm a shit ton of carapaces from the elite silithids in Silithus. And you can't even begin to loot the carapaces until you get the head of Broodlord from BWL (or someone with the head deputizes you). 
---
You need so many carapaces too that the only realistic way you're getting them in time is to have your guild help farm them out. Or you'll have to buy them, so save up gold prior to the AQ patch.
---
Isn’t the rank 11 mount pretty cheap it also doesn’t require the riding skill for epic either. Not that that’s expensive but y’know.
---
I can't believe how much rage that Payo guy displayed. That wasn't just entertainment for the camera -- that was real. How do you get to be that old and still get so upset over WoW. He was one death away from becoming the [Wow freakout kid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m7ewouLQXA)
---
freezing trap is technically an "incapacitate" iirc, which does share DR with "disorient" in vanilla...abilities like gouge and sap should also DR both scatter and freezing trap
---
the reason why freezing trap DR is sticking out like a sore thumb right now is probably because nobody has both scatter and clever traps on beta
---
I mean their country is huge. I don't know about population though cause I'm lazy but it might be justified to give them one server, idk
---
Rogue 10 to 22 is terrible. Warriors can at least duo with a healer.
---
 I took an entire week off for this bad boy. I’m ready.
---
What makes you believe Paladin has "more pvp utility"? Optimal BG premades use multiple Disc Priests and Shadow is top tier in world pvp/duels
---
Meet yourself halfway and play Fury Warrior with Daggers 
---
Thank me later.
---
Shit that was actually my first thought lmao.
---
I killed some grubs in EPL, farmed some Trent's in Felwood, got lucky on some need rolls for Holy Orbs then ran Dire Maul and Scholo with some guildies.
---
If it's an unintended change, then it's an unintended change and a bug is a bug is a bug.
---
Good. Camp them into rolling on pve servers.
---
Exactly, this is what iv been saying from the start. They will either have to keep layering indefinitely or open more realms so you can transfer. They should have ditched this layering "solution" way back.
---
Hey dude, check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSGI5Uu5REk). This guy paid people different amounts to do different commissions and reviews the results. He pays a few hundred, but the best results that come back are still artists using a lot of edited photoshop to create a more real-looking background and textures without having to do as much of the leg work. I'd imagine paying someone enough to create something like this at such a size and detail would definitely cost quite a bit. Also realize that there's plenty of artists who would take money to do this, but probably wouldn't deliver nearly as spectacular results.
---
I mean, do you even speak another language at all? I speak four, and I'm telling you: nobody's gonna force me to speak another language than the one I wanna play with. If we end up having an unofficial french or german server and you end up on it, you'll have fun just learning french or german to adapt yourself just like you're saying we should. Easy to tell other people to learn your language, not so much to learn theirs, is it?
---
Don't count on it, is all in saying.
---
&gt;Freezing trap was added to that category.
---
Would appreciate if you had any information to back that up since I suspect you're pulling this from the furthest reaches of your rear end right now.
---
It wasn't like this for the majority of the game's life span.
---
You can have 2 on at the same time. With 2 you'll get at least one proc per fight.
---
The freeze is super OP, it's basically a Hunter's freezing trap. It counts as a stun so it doesn't share any DR with your other CC. But the biggest bonus is it counts towards Shatter. So you can very easily gain distance, bandage up, then slap them with a phat Frostbolt for major damage.
---
No titles in vanilla except pvp ranks I believe
---
Now that I have a credit card I'd swipe hard for that.
---
I hit rank 12,   at rank 11 I got an epic mount for like 10g ish
---
The data was requested by the CDC to predict how humans would react in a real pandemic.
---
Use it to bait interrupts as it looks like a healing spell.
---
my man
---
How does agility increase armor? Also strength goes just as mush attack power as agility does to warriors. I will give you dodge but blocking is a higher priority. Strength is be for rage generation as well.
---
Just sitting here on auto attack.
---
So now you won't be able to group up with another party if they are on abother layer, if let's say the group you just left were on a different one as well. This is shit, remove layering already.
---
I got geared up enough that I could solo the elites at Tyrs Hand. Being level 60 elites, they dropped a lot of silver and grey items.
---
It's such a strange decision though because FT didn't DR with blind/scatter in 2.x or later versions. This looks more and more like a mistake.
---
If you're not planning on a big investment into the game, and don't want to be taking, then probably rogue.
---
Comparable DPS through at least T2. Easier to gear. Loads of convenience features (stealth is a great defensive tool). No constantly being asked to tank.
---
If you wanna no life it and be serious, then warrior (probably with a farming alt).
---
Yes, flat 183 damage that scales only with SP.
---
So at the end of the day, with Naxx gear and try-hard consumables, you'll be hitting for about 650 non-crit damage every 5 seconds (talented). It's not overly impressive on paper, but it's also not terrible on paper. With mortal shots, you'd be be throwing out some solid crits that would bypass armor so there's that.
---
This is a pipe dream for sure simply because of the gear requirement, but it could be a bit of fun.
---
Then you are f...ed, because layering is cancer in a game like wow.
---
Same with hearthstones
---
That's some good content right there.
---
What if people are guildies/friends that are on a different layer, or even someone in general chat (assuming chat goes through the different layers since chat servers are separate) then they join up and can't phase to their groups layer at all? Then what?
---
There is no perfect fix and this could be even more annoying from a players perspective. The only 'perfect fix' would be to just remove layering altogether so we don't have to deal with it and it's problems at all.
---
I mean that's what a lot of them do including streamers.  Kinda the nature of a gank.
---
This is funny seeing the reactions. This kind of makes me want to do this too.. I would of imagined the streamers would be running around as a stack.
---
Payo is actually a super chill streamer. I don’t get him being on here... I fully support the Soda deaths though.
---
AKA - “I haven’t found a life mate yet”
---
At level 10 a rogue has:
---
* Stealth
---
* Eviscerate 2
---
* Sinister Strike 2
---
* Gouge
---
* Evasion
---
* Sap
---
* Slice and Dice
---
* Sprint
---
By 22 they know:
---
* Kick
---
* Expose Armor
---
* Garrote
---
* Sinister Strike 3
---
* Eviscerate 3
---
* Ambush
---
* Instant Poison 1
---
* Crippling Poison 1
---
* Rupture
---
* Stealth 2
---
* Vanish
---
* Garrote 2
---
* Sinister Strike 4
---
* Riposte
---
At level 10 a warrior has: 
---
* Battle Shout 1
---
* Heroic Strike 2
---
* Charge
---
* Rend 2
---
* Thunder Clap
---
* Hamstring
---
* Bloodrage
---
* Taunt
---
* Sunder Armor
---
* Overpower
---
* Battle Shout 3
---
* Demoralizing Shout 
---
* Revenge
---
* Heroic Strike 3
---
* Disarm
---
* Thunder Clap 2
---
* Cleave
---
* Retaliation
---
* Rend 3
---
* Intimidating Shout
---
* Sunder Armor 2
---
So no, there's really no benefit to a healer choosing to duo with a warrior over a rogue, at least at these levels, and there's really no argument to be made that 10 to 22 is faster for a warrior than a rogue. Poisons are a very small part of a rogue's damage.
---
RPers
---
And I want to live in a  fairy land. It's unrealistic to think they can avoid dead servers and merges in such a game. All they care about is saving money tbh.
---
I totally understand why as humans we enjoy others raging I just dont get the obsession to make a video and post on reddit. 
---
I mean sure gank a few times here and there but continuously following someone just to make them not enjoy the game anymore seems juvenile.
---
&gt; Warrior leveling is a big enough pain to tip the scales.
---
I swear I'm like the only guy who found warrior leveling awesome.  I enjoyed every minute of it.

The majority of US servers called it VC during vanilla. The weird superiority complex of calling it DM is one of the strangest things about this sub. 
---
Everyone knows which one people are talking about and it doesn’t matter. Why are people on both sides so holier than thou about it?
---
On silver hand and azgalor, it was always called VC. I’d probably call it DM to follow the norm, but this circlejerk makes me want to stick with VC.
---
Another thing to keep in mind is that the Warcraft games and books also tie in a lot of story as well.
---
Agi Increases armor, crit, dodge and attack power. It says so right on the character panel, and many sites go in depth with the actual math on it.
---
I'm not a mathematical theory crafter but it's been pretty common knowledge since Vanilla that while STR and AGI are pretty much on par with their tanking benefits, most people place AGI just slightly above STR in the stat priority.
---
Warlock wasn't too bad on alliance back in the day.  And now that everyone knows how op orcs are there will be way less undeads.
---
My server had an epic war between Alliance and Horde. As the alliance guild leader of the primary PvP guild, I would love to go back and read that history.
---
There were some epic moments during the war.

---
I hope you reach 60 before next summer :)
---
Actually, she’s playing with me. Find a better mate 😉
---
The first thing they did then had another 10+ /w to let me know how stupid i was lol
---
Cause people don't want layering because it's a terrible idea, is that too complicated for you to grasp?
---
I'm playing on a private server with a buddy.  I've leveled three classes past 20 so far.  Got my layout of which one I'm focusing and my main alt.
---
.... What? Yes, that is the intent?
---
if i want to ride a black war tiger as a gnome i need exalted with darnassus in order to learn how to ride a tiger.
---
and the pvp mount should cost as much as other mounts.
---
There's usually only 1 in a guild before the gates open, 2 is possible if they plan everything right and finish raids early in the week.
---
New models are TRASH. They are bouncy cartoon characters. No.
---
Fury Warrior is so much more fun to play.
---
Alliance warlock is very good and you get to play conflag build in premades.  I played a dwarf hunter and a night elf and both have their perks.  Stoneform will save your life but there will be many times that not having shadowmeld will kill you.  Also its more fun to invis gank especially when playing with rogues so you don't have to be bait.
---
Dark Souls 3 and Stardew Valley. Basically add those 2 together and you got WoW Classic anyways.
---
Human racial is only 1-2% dps max and daggers are completely viable to raid with too.
---
At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.
---
Same.  EPL arcane crystal farm was pretty good to me.
---
Yes
---
15 bucks a month +Internet. Maybe a computer every few years. She should be happy lol. Dirt cheap hobby
---
Make more realms or shard starting zones, come on dude don't be a sheep.
---
But riding is still like 800g no?
---
idk who that is, but sure w/e.
---
Balding and Baldy right below Asmongold, nice lol
---
New models?  No.  Fixed spines for orcs?  Yes.
---
It really depended on the servers. There were a few servers in wrath that still had the gates closed and a couple guilds transferred to those servers just for the  mount, also for server first wrath titles. On my server, stormreaver, there were a lot of high end guilds on both sides and we all kinda worked together, each faction respectively of course. Lots of pvp fighting over spawns and such. It was pretty awesome really.
---
Shadowmeld is only usable out of combat and it doesn't effect stealth at all.  Night elfs do have increased stealth though.
---
shadowstep was fye
---
Well if we were doing that then wouldn't I call Dire Maul PT?
---
I guess this question belongs in the what to play Wednesday threads, but how much of a benefit is the Human 10% increased rep gains? I'm not planning to roll human based on this or anything, just curious as to how much people value this.
---
Pretty very wrong. Must have taken a while to make this pic 2.
---
&gt; With the mod you're still having the press a different key to exit the form.
---
Ah, no, the `mod:alt` is just there to allow you to _intentionally_ recycle from bear back to bear. This reshifting is useful when you want to break immobilization, but dangerous if you are trying to shift, say, from travel form to bear form when being attacked; defaulting to always allow reshifting risks popping back out of bear form when bashing the keys.
---
Retail wow and my time at Portia.
---
So it should be KG for King Gordok.
---
Undermining the whole game because people can't wait a few weeks after launch :(
---
I remember this. I played on TL - horde. Was in Scooyrit.
---
Ahh the good old days.
---
Tyrs hand was.a big farming area in vanilla. I spent many hours there on my pally
---
Kinda dumb they removed easy customer service. I’m stoked for classic, but the levels of nit picky shit like right click reporting being removed makes me frequent this sub far less.
---
Why would you need macros as a rogue? Startattack?
---
Too long didn’t read, but awesome work man. I lied I did read a little bit not the whole thing, but that’s not to discredit your work, I’m just drunk. Thanks for making this. I like that you put this much work into a quest line to give us a little bit of context and to really enjoy the story they put into the little things such as some quest I’ve barely paid attention to just to get a little experience.
---
Questie is the one I've seen a few streamers use.
---
If you truly want an in-game addon, the streamers all seem to use Questie.  I believe even Joana was using it. 
---
If I remember correctly more guide addons are still being developed, including an in-game version of Joanas guide.
---
I didn't follow the news at all for Classic. So do I need to buy a new game for it, or do I just need to pick up the subscription again for WoW (at the same price or less I hope) and Classic will just be there?
---
Warriors will have threat issues, rogues will not
---
My vacation starts the 29th. I've never seen a game launch go smoothly.
---
It's actually gotten a lot better for the average player.. lots of the new characters allow for different styles of play. For example Hammond makes me more forgiving as a Tank main when having to deal with Triple/Quad-DPS in Competitive. They have also done a great job bringing each and every character into line, while some may be "meta" there aren't any real throw picks in the game the way Torb / Hanzo / Widow were at one point. 
---
Outside of the fact GOATS has been king for the past few seasons, I really think Overwatch is leaning in a good direction. Too bad its been 15 seasons and there are still multiple issues that haven't been dealt with.
---
One other thing: this sub likes to act as if everyone has the exact same opinion which is far from the truth. Who is surprised that they make a change that many people have been asking for, and then a different set of people come to complain about the new change?
---
Its not the same people complaining but yes, Blizzard can NOT please everyone.
---
It was usually midnight and only half the guild wanted to push it before reset.
---
It's mostly because dots do worse DPS than shadow bolt. Debuff limit is just the nail in the coffin
---
This is what I did as well but had a path in Un'goro
---
&gt; It's unrealistic to think they can avoid dead servers and merges in such a game
---
Try EQ2!
---
Can blizz insert some sort of hypnotic trance when you log in so that you forget everything that you have done in vanilla and everyone can start a noob again?
---
After winning against the bots on unfair we got into our first unranked match. The other team massacred us! Indeed, I think our first 20-30 matches will be demoralizing. After that first match I went to bed thinking if I'll have the time and patience to properly learn DotA.
---
Tfw your post gets removed.
---
mmoglider baby, lol
---
If you want to spend 200 hours rep grinding and just as much time farming gold to get at best a bit of server noteriety, at worse getting 99% there and someone else bangs the gong before you can.
---
If I was to set a big lofty dumb goal, it would be sulfuras personally.
---
Sweet, 7s has passed for me to write this comment
---
Same, had a nice solid route. Kind of circled the whole thing.
---
They are like seasons. You start with a fresh account and no characters
---
Auctioneer.  Bought it soon after 60.  don't tell anyone.
---
Weapon skill is &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; everything else
---
This was a special time for me, I was heavy into pvp and running an undead warrior. I bought stacks on stacks of heavy leather to get exalted with orgrimmar so I could ride into nodes in AB on a wolf. It’s a very good time to increase rep and sell resources. I don’t know how I managed to do it. This might have been around the same time I was bored with the game and spent a lot of time playing the auction house. Ended up grinding 1000g very easily in a couple weeks. I dunno vanilla was mostly a blur.
---
Champion of the...day man...! 
---
Ooooahhhhhahhhhhhhh!!!
---
I don’t think it did. Almost positive it didn’t. My brother farmed rank 11 cause it save him x gold if all it saved him was 80g on riding he wouldn’t have farmed it. Now saving him 500g+ (I believe it was ~100g for it) that he would do.
---
I would ask him but I know he won’t remember.
---
We have discussed random rolls, loot council, and DKP.  If other such systems exist, they would be rare to find.  Nearly every guild used one of the three.
---
I'm not quite grasping the point of your sarcasm here.  Did you simply run out of things to say?
---
I’m hoping perfectraid is updated for classic. It’s by far my favorite raid frame add on for its simplicity. 
---
Definitely will be rocking;
---
Swing time add on
---
Gatherer 
---
Atlas loot
---
DBM 
---
Cast bar add on 
---
Some type of UI interface like bartender 
---
Onebag/one bank
---
Probably a few more I can’t think of right now.
---
I’m macro-illiterate so I’ve been keeping an eye out for these as well.  I couldn’t even figure out how to get my imp to attack at the same time I cast during the stress test.
---
Just rep.
---
deadzone shouldent be effected right so will still be able to do as much dmg as before but sadly harder to kite right? Hunters wont get extended range?
---
I can't decide...dwarf priest or NE priest. I know all about min/maxing and how dwarf priest is the best, fear ward, etc. And I love dwarves, and never cared much about nightelves. 
---
But, shadowmelding and surprise attacking or mind controlling a passing horde seems like the coolest thing ever.
---
Gear up MT then the rest go to rogues. A couple pieces for OT.
---
You dont need 8 naxx geared tanks for 4H.
---
You dont even need 1 naxx geared tank.
---
r/savedyouaclick
---
It's kinda scary that I can actually remember my exact route and where the spawns were some 14+ years later. Some spawns I remember being a huge PITA because of mob spawns.
---
Clearly I spent far too long farming there lol
---
Questie only puts a UI arrow that points to objective and some icons on map where objective is. It doesn't state which quests are worth picking up and optimum route to speed up leveling so your not wasting time on out of the way or long quests with poor rewards etc. Wow-Pro Guides Addon looked interesting, but wasn't sure if it was similar to Joanna guide where it gave checklist of quests to pick up and do at each level and zone.
---
&gt;Expect

There's a useful macro to apply Poisons, but I can't type it from memory.
---
It's not an English server, it's a European server which means people are free/allowed to use whatever language they want.
---
??
---
I honestly kind of... didnt. I used to like to complete every single quest for instances, like for completionist sake, so Id just grab the quests and do them all. I completed MC and BWL attune without knowing about them. For MC, I had gotten halfway through the Jail Break quest line before I realized what Ony attunement was.
---
All these classes are fine for open world farming and wPvP encounters. I guess Druid would be the best by most metrics, as they are arguably the fastest leveler beside Hunter and is really hard to kill in wPVP. Shaman is also quite fast out in the world, and can easily slip away from sticky situations thanks to wolf form. Priests might have to fight more often, but shadow priests are obviously almost unfair in 1v1 situations. Do keep in mind that you might have to respec as Priest quite often (rip gold), if you want to function well in both solo open world and group PvE endgame.
---
**Organized PvP:**
---
Druid is mostly used as a flag-carrier in premade Warsong Gulch, and you will be very sought after if you enjoy this role. You are a bit more underwhelming in other specs and BGs, but wouldn't surprise me if people let you step in as a healer when they struggle to find Priests.
---
Shaman is used for both burst and healing in battlegrounds. A lot of fun, if you enjoy playing as support in the mid and frontlines. I would recommend not buying into the Enchantment meme, as those build are really bad in 1.12.
---
Priests are expected to be talented into Disc for most serious premade situations, and you are mostly healing and debuffing the opposition. This is imo more fun and challenging than it sounds like, as you can play both offence and defence (most setups use two Priests) and will often be the difference between winning and losing team battles. You will also be sought after af, as everyone need Priest utility and few people roll Priests with organized PvP in mind.
---
**PvE (group):**
---
Druid will for the most part be expected to go resto. Although there's still some stigma over it, they can be pretty good and sometimes even optimal over Warriors as off-tanks.
---
As a Shaman, you will be expected to heal and put up totems. I hope you didn't expect anything else. You are not able to compete against casters in full elemental and Enchantment is a meme. Make sure to let your raid leader know if you want off-spec gear for PvP.
---
Priests are, unsurprisingly, also healers. There might be a spot for a Shadow Priest if your guild bring a lot of Warlocks, but never more than one.
---
I watched it live it maybe had 400. Even that is is being generous. I would like to see blizzard numbers but a couple thousand is a joke.
---
IMO, a mod that literally lays everything out for you is a bit of overkill. If you want the most optimized way to speed level, join a private server and memorize the quest route.
---
There are different levels of wrong. When a person openly displays this level of wrong it's usually a pretty safe assumption that they're wrong about a lot of things.
---
I'm comfortable grouping WoD with Legion as also being unfinished at launch. Just a handful of the big items I remember off the top of my head for Legion:
---
1. Artifact questlines didn't work for about same number of people as WoD's garrison bug - effectively preventing them from playing the expansion
---
2. Legendary soft cap - You were soft capped at 2 legendaries (the chance of a 3rd legendary was astronomically high), so raiders were actually leveling 2+ characters and playing whichever one got the best legendary. As a bonus to this one, the chances of getting your 2nd legendary were absurdly high for some reason, so most people had either 0 or 2 for several weeks
---
3. No way at launch to target legendaries (the currency was introduced way into launch)
---
4. Secondaries were horribly balanced - for some classes the crafting pieces were BIS over raid/M+ loot for the first tier (I started the xpac as Enhance, and my crafted rings were better than my first legendary: Sephuz's Secret. I literally did not equip my first legendary except in super niche situations)
---
5. You were stuck gathering loot for 1 spec only, forever, because almost every activity in the game had a chance to drop a legendary, and you didn't want to burn a legendary on an offspec piece
---
6. AK existed
---
7. AP was spent by spec, so coupled with AK slow buildup and inability to set your loot preference to offspec (since you might get the wrong legendary), playing offspec was absolutely terrible until your AK started stacking up after several weeks
---
8. The most efficient way to farm AP was to spam Maw of Souls. All other dungeons were effectively worthless. I did maw something like 200 times and every other dungeon a handful. BFA's M+ experience is massively better than legion's.
---
9. Emerald Nightmare (by far the worst full raid in WoW's history)
---
10. Arcanocrystal was essentially another legendary for most classes and dropped off a rotating world boss that couldn't even be spam re-rolled. You either had this and did 5-10% more dps or you waited another month for 2 more chances at it. Fortunately world bosses were one of the many bugged experiences at the start of the expansion so US servers got 2 chances at Withered Jim in the first 2 weeks.
---
Most of Legion's problems were centered around AP and Legendaries. It took them tiers to fix these.
---
There was plenty I liked about Legion, and it finished really strong, but it was FAR from a finished product when they sold it to us.
---
herbalism is always better.
---
Especially holy because you'll have a pocket healer
---
no thats just how his arm is now, it decayed on the run through ashenvale.
---
Haven't seen anyone talk about the 3 arcane dmg you do while struck in combat. Might sound like nothing but once you pair it with similiar items (Ragnaros trinket, ring from BRD etc) and consumables such as Oil of Immolation and grenades your warrior will become a very potent AoE tank.
---
No matter what every tank warrior should wanna pick up Drillborer disk for their threat set (When you don't want to break your engineering shield).
---
You know what I meant, regardless.
---
Oh shit I think one of the old private servers I played on actually used this area, that was a weird dose of nostalgia.
---

Look, US servers also have all the Latin America servers too. And Americans speak many different languages. I guess I’m missing what the difference between US/Oceanic/Latin America vs Europe. We handle multiple languages over here, have Spanish speaking guilds and things go alright.
---
&gt;"can we have a version of classic for people who don't actually like classic?"
---
Pretty much exactly what they are saying in a lot of these threads.
---
1)You do want to go straight for rattle cages, it is true. If you are blessed and get all 3 pickups on the first 3 mobs, you will miss level two by ONE experience point... make sure you pick up another mob on the way.
---
2)Try to summon your minion in a location you can complete quests or buy/sell while its summoning - it will not stop your summon.
---
2)When i hit level 2 i got straight behind the church and work my way down getting a mix of bats, wolves, and mindless ones. Hopefully i complete all wings and paws by the time I get to the bottom house, and then just circle back up for remaining mindless ones and wretched. I use immolate and pull 3 at a time. Pull loots like this....
---
Start pet attack, use immolate, let pet attack 2 more times while I immolate other two creeps. Shadow bolt or auto to finish in order pulled.
---
3) I have my imp attack mobs while I'm picking up boxes, preferably rattle cages because they are most hard to find and are worth more xp (level 3) if other people are around.
---
4) For 12 rattlecages I can never seem to get them all at once, I get what i can while looting those boxes, and go for samuel that way I can gage asap what I should do next. If somebody just finished him and I see that I go back for rattlecages and try to loop around the blacksmith area. If it looks like it was already done and may spawn at any time I grind higher level 4 bats if near by, or whatever is highest --- even if you have a perfect run you will need to grind a few mobs anyway to get to level 6 before brill... might as well do it now. IF i actually get him I head straight for the rest of the rattlecages as close to spiders as possible killing all along the way. Since I already have 6 or more out of twelve I normally dont have to wait (or wait long).
---
5) ALWAYS suicide after spiders, they kill you the quickest (take off demon armor - i forget to do this sometimes). It will not have a negative effect and literally take you back to where you need to go, right next to samuel remains turn in.
---
6) Scarlets are always hit or miss - I have to skip Meven probably 50% of the time. When completing your last bands CHECK FOR HIM before you go turn in, to decide if you should do it. If he just died forget it - it seems to take atleast 3 minutes and I can farm xp quicker.
---
7) I always try to find gloom weed on the way there, but I never seem to be able to find it. I always pick up herbalism in brill to help with this and doom weed quests. I want this profession anyway, later down the road.
---
8) The pumpkin farm is really far away and you will want to suicide to get back BUT YOU CANNOT. if you do, it takes you to deathknell. You literally have to walk half way back first, i wait till i cross the road to be sure. See near end of that video.
---
9) Putrid claws suck, but dont be discouraged just keep grinding them while getting that gloom weed.
---
10) I cannot guarantee kill Maggot eye before level 8. He is sometimes level 11 even though the guide says 10. That means he may resist  or dodge most of your skills. You have to pretend your imp is a tank and let him keep aggro if you are level 7, do not attempt at 6 not worth risk.
---
11) I find the bats just north of brill to have the best drop rate, regardless of what the quest addons say. I try to wait and to them when I get Maggot eye on the way back north. These bats have an annoying interrupt that makes pulling more than 2 risky.
---
12) I do not do mills overrun until i have the murloc quest, and get the murlocs west of them instead of doing them near maggot eye. The casters at mills are likely to kill you if you get caught with extra mobs and are not ready (patrol).
---
13) I try to have my hearth ready for level 10, and have failed my last two attempts at doing so because of other issues. at this point I would immagine i would walk to undercity next for void quest as he is so important. I have not got this far yet, but I have 8 level 10 warlocks for the next steps to try this. I do not plan on going to the barrens on launch, even if I am ahead of a large percentage of people I will not be first and I expect ~75% to go to barrens.
---
Final Notes) it is super important to pick up your level 4 and 8 spells as soon as possible and try to pace your leveling around being at the town for these spells. Do not forget imp fire bolt 2 at level 8, it not only does more damage but helps your pet tank for you with that damage. makes maggot eye much easier if you havent done him yet.... 
---
I am doing this and having a blast - but I do not have beta access. I am playing on a private server. I know this means I will need to adapt, but knowing where everything is and about how much xp i will get will help with this significantly.
---
Azeroth Auto Pilot will be available for Classic.
---
I died in that crypt like a million times trying to get those weapons.
---
So I played vanilla, but i was only 8 so i dont remember much... Considering rolling a NE Prot Warrior, any thoughts? Good idea, bad idea? Why or why not? Mainly concerned with playing prot and not sure if I'll enjoy it enough to lock myself into it
---
I never even bought gold but whenever I hear the name Susan this permanent imprint on my brain comes to mind.
---
If you only care about dps I dunno what the argument for rogue over warrior is. 
---
*Rogue*
---
* Better on aggro sensitive fights
---
* Sap? (crappy cc only for dungeons but usually not worth it)
---
*Warrior*
---
* Slightly better single target dps
---
* Much better cleave/aoe dps
---
* Better cooldowns
---
* Execute phase
---
* More weapon options
---
* More armour options
---
* More interesting rotation
---
* Fear immunities
---
People on reddit will sit here and argue points like this ad nauseam. The truth is, if you aren't going for some ridiculous lvling world first style thing, who the fuck cares. Just dont level prot. You can tank as fury or arms or as a shaman or even a rogue if your healer is good. Early 5 means are easy. Everyone is just itching to play classic. It's all they can think about so people come up with things to be in conflict over. If you want to play warrior. Play one. Choose the class you want to play, and play it. If you dont like your spec then respec! The first few respecs are cheap and the cost will decay back down while you are leveling anyway. It takes a long time to level all classes. Warriors are just a little longer. The most important thing is you like what you play. Leveling takes too long to play a class you dont like. 
---
Also some of your info is off. I'm pretty sure 24% off hand miss chance is only for mobs 3 levels higher, ie raid bosses. I think its 12 or 15 for same level, not sure exactly. So its typically better to grind mobs either same level or one level lower, your kill times out weight the slight exp penalty for killing something one level lower than you. Also if you are orc or human the extra wep skill helps a ton! As you said yourself, you will be missing a lot regardless. Also dont forget rogues duel wield also. I know energy isn't dependent on hitting blah blah but still. Literally thousands of warriors leveled up completely using DW fury back in the day. The more savvy warriors switch from dw fury to 2h arms after 40. MS and Overpower crits destroy mobs and sweeping strikes is great for leveling.
---
Basically I'm saying it sounds like you aren't worried about getting world first, so why worry about it at all. Just play what you will have fun playing! As long as you aren't just randomly putting points in stupid places like I did in vanilla, you will be fine. I ended up killing C'thun, so I turned out just fine! You will figure it out. I believe in you friend!
---
That’s my kinda style right there!
---
The overreaction is real
---
? Ice lance, seed of corruption, unstable affliction, water elemental, slow, shadowfury, lifebloom, cyclone, shadow word death, binding heal, shadow fiend, Shadow Step, kill command, steady shot.
---
Like are you kidding me? How come every single time someone always responds they always same the same shit. All these new quick or instant spells that where insanely powerful got introduced, then WOTLK counter balances this by adding more mobility. It's a stupid vicious cycle of bad balance
---
All power to you then, lots of minutes to enjoy.
---
This might help—Shadowmeld breaks on casting, and MC has a long cast time, so it negatives the benefit you’d get from stealth. Dwarf hands down wins.
---
And Teldrassil should be called Darnasus and The forsaken should be called Undercity
---
I really hate how this sub whines about the same posts getting made (layering) but then when some new player, retail baby or not, asks a question or pitches an idea the post is downvoted heavily and the responses are literally just "No" or "Nochanges" with absolutely no discussion.
---
Nobody is fine with BFA
---
Just take into consideration that A LOT of people will be using Joanas, Questie, Azeroth Auto Pilot etc.
---
So what you may think is an optimal guide to follow my end up being the least optimal guide once everyone is following it and you have lineups of people waiting for the same questspawn mob/item.
---
I remember taking days off for mmo launches. good times.
---
Isn't it obvious? They don't like retail
---
ill just paste what i gave to the other guy but
---
Ice lance, seed of corruption, unstable affliction, water elemental, slow, shadowfury, lifebloom, cyclone, shadow word death, binding heal, shadow fiend, Shadow Step, kill command, steady shot.
---
Every spell introduced was instant asides like arcane blast, and incinirate. All new shaman spells where instant but also all new shaman spells where buffs. So, it's a pretty hard example. This in turn means that if things are quicker to cast, you need to be able to move faster to balance it
---
He was definitely healbotting. That's like the #1 job of WC3 paladins.
---
Dude, don't be stealing my idea.
---
Also I am not perfect. I die at least once unexpected per run, its going to happen. But learning to use your pet (such as I needed to a few times) to pull aggro off of you will help.
---
I cornered the market on an essential crafting material everyone needed to level a profession.  I also bought every copy of a moderately rare recipe to a fairly useful and popular item to limit my competition in selling that item.  If you wanted to compete in that space you either had to be lucky or pay me a premium up front for the recipe.

 **To clarify this isn't me saying I don't care** 
---
Do you believe that *reasonable* inferences can be made based off your statements, and logical conclusions drawn from those inferences, which does not make them accusations or statements of absolute fact, but makes them reasonable criticisms/replies which you can then go back and correct errors or defend your position? So when someone were to say something like "What if it was your daughter, who wanted to give away all her possessions and wander around homeless?" and you reply "Absolutely. If my daughter is a grown ass adult she can do what she wants." We are able to *reasonably* draw conclusions from that statement?
---
Let's recap on what was said just after you said
---
 [1776nREE](https://www.reddit.com/user/1776nREE/)
---
Because  sex workers have such good life outcomes? If she wanted to be a  professional meth smoker would you support her? What happened to home  maker, doctor, secretary, veterinarian, or chef?
---
 [Dessiato](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dessiato/)3
---
Good leaps of logic. Good rhetoric.
---
Nice.
---
Okay, so your comment was a few things in regards to your daughter sending nude pictures of herself for  literal WoW items. It was distant, it was so brazenly ignorant to the idea that someone could have concern for their child based on how it completely ignored what Hermes8675 was **hinting at(no subtly though)**. It looks like you actually just wanted to be edgy here and pretend his issue was so minuscule that you didn't even address **his very obvious point.** 
---
Now, after you trying to peacock(not meant in a pejorative way) your very radical point of view that if your daughter were sending nude pictures for WoW items, it didn't bother you because she was an adult, I challenged it. I did equate her sending nudes to sex workers, which is not a 1:1 ratio, but the greater point I was making was that sending pictures of yourself for "stuff" is one facet of those worker's lives, and it has negative outcomes almost all the time. There is even evidence of it directly angering women, look up the guys who made a program that scans your GF's face to search adult videos and see if she has performed in one, no shame in it right?
---
So what happens next?
---
\-I link the study of sex workers
---
\-You call it a leap of logic again, blatantly missing the point or refusing to take the relevance into account because it isn't a perfect 1:1 analogy of sending nude pictures online for WoW items.
---
\-I dialed down the analogy to **"that's why mothers would hide it from their teenage children, or avoid  telling their parents, and it apparently counts as privileged  information that causes a backlash when guys make a facial recognition  search engine to find out if their partner ever did a porno."**
---
\-Your response was just an evasion: "heh, I don't necessarily agree or disagree, can't pin me down can you? BTW, I only used 5% of my full power /animerun"  
---
[Dessiato](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dessiato/)3
---
Didn't ever imply if it was acceptable or not.
---
I just said if my kid is an adult, they have the right to do what they want.
---
Please cease.
---
You did **imply** it, when you act completely uninterested and show absolutely no concern, but DO actively defend the activity as "muh adult children" You implied it here, or your statement could be taken to imply it, ***reasonably***.
---
Let's use an analogy again here:
---
Bob tells Joe his son is becoming a racist and Joe replies with "Hey wait a minute now, racism isn't illegal and as a grown man he can do whatever he wants"
---
It is completely within ***reason*** for Bob to assume some level of endorsement here, and it is up to Joe to correct him with more accurate information. We are not computers, and we don't operate at 110% autism, it isn't feasible or even desirable to most people. So you can take the lawyeresque innocent until proven guilty crap and stop wasting people's time.
---
As for me making assumptions, I worked with the information you gave me, and it was honestly more than you think you gave. They can have toxic or destructive behavior and you wait until they ask for help because they are adults and it's none of your business. But now it sounds like I am implying that my criticism is in you not intervening, it isn't. My criticism is in you *seemingly* showing no concern at all for the actions they take, it isn't a criticism of the point at which you choose to intervene(you said you would wait until they ask).
---
You say you've had humbling and meaningful conversations in the past, let me just be frank. You fucking squirm and wiggle around topics instead of saying anything substantive, my values and arguments were there from the very beginning when I related a fucking outcome to the action itself. But you chose to fucking nitpick the less than 100% perfect analogy which doesn't scream 140 IQ response to me. It just sounds like you are full of shit especially when you are on the defensive for so long and do nothing but criticize me instead of engaging with the material. So far you've shit posted "nice leaps bruh" and ended it without a deeper explanation of your ideas, all while repeating you haven't even told us your ideas. Someone who doesn't post anything substantive and is happy to go back in forth is this stupid shit flinging is someone who doesn't know how to have a proper back and forth, at some point you cut out the crap whining about me misrepresenting your views and you just state them.
---
This is a waste of time now, if you want to keep talking about it please use DMs, this went on for too long in the wrong reddit section.

Stuck between warrior and Druid. I’ve always enjoyed tanking and want to be able to do it in classic. I’ll probably have to OT as I won’t be able to be there every single week, but I can be there often. Just stuck between the 2, what should I play?

Make more realms and and end up with dead servers. I personally am not interested in paying for a server transfer. Sharding only works on a continent basis because of loading zones. Before you call people “sheep” do your research instead of copying and pasting old ideas.

Only Scarab Lord. I don’t think you could change your title if you just had a PVP one either, although I could be wrong.
---
I'm aware it breaks on casting, but that still gives an advantage because it will initially catch the enemy off guard which is very rare for an in-range caster. Question is, can one react to casting MC quick enough to interrupt? I guess so yeah because of the long cast. 
---
Shadowmeld works best with warrior I think. Surprise charges.
---
Nearing 8k hours on poe, legion is amazing aside from a few bugs!
---
What's worth doing depends on your level and class and the server and what your hearthstone CD is on and all sorts of things. Questie gives you a list of available quests and tells you how to do them. Unless you can plug into the google ai neural network you're gonna have to do the rest of the thinking yourself.
---
Well that and the ability to live out your genterbending furry fantasies. We don’t judge here.
---
For retail? Sure, Blizzard changes their mind on a dime to whatever yields the most profit. For Classic, their goal is much different. Do they want to make money? Sure. But, the actual path to making the most money for Classic is to keep the community happy. Layering after afew weeks will not keep the community happy, but it will make the initial launch smooth which makes Blizzard more money.
---
After that, layering will not longer be beneficial to Blizzard. There will be too much community backlash. It will not yield profit.
---
It is this hypothesis as to why I trust Ion in what he says. Community desire and Blizzard's goals align.
---
I love pvp = Frostwolf Howler Horn ftw!
---
I only hope people do not rush that bg and play the whole thing out again.
---
WOTF is definitely annoying, but also keep in mind that Warlock is significantly more rare on Alliance than Horde. You will likely be in a bigger demand for premade BGs on Ally side. Your burst is also more desireable on Ally than Horde side, as you lack Shamans.
---
It'd make the experience so much more pure, ya? XD

its not just random places female taurens fit, its a large number of exterior doorways, especially when you're mounted.
---
Most of the things you listed are personally why I like the hunter - its playstyle is so unique and with practice can be played to an extremely high skill level. But, I understand why all of the side mechanics might be annoying to some.
---
As for the bag management, this is really less of an issue than most people make it out. You only really need one or two slots for meat (20-40 items) as long as you regularly pick up some more when you go by inns. And although one bag slot is dedicated to ammo, you don't have to deal with the sometimes multiple sets of gear that other classes need to constantly manage. In reality, druids, warriors, priests, shamans, warlocks, and paladins will have just as much bag management to deal with if not more.
---
I think Joana wants to have an in-game addon for his guide too. The best would be 2 monitors and Joanas/whoevers webguide on the second monitor, as the web guides do tend to have a lot more info generally speaking than in-game guides.
---
Whether the guides will be of any use on thee launch given how saturated those particular routes will be is a completely different discussion however and something you should consider too.
---
that reminds me of farstrider lodge. i loved finding these little out of the way outposts.

I’d love to see Kara but I always felt northrend should have come before Outland, as it’s a continent on the planet with the most obvious story continuation from naxx. But it’d have to be sans tyrion Mary Sue, deathknights, argent dawn, garrosh, the settlements we set up there, toc, icc, malygos etc etc. Just a broken land, with tonnes of history and the foreshadowing of the Lich king, sitting atop a throne with his motives unclear and his next action unknown. Azjol nerub would have to be the explorable zone that it was supposed to be and all the zones would need to be made ground mount friendly. Ulduar was a good raid and obsidian sanctum has a pretty cool “hard mode” activation. The crappy pvp zone and raid within should just be a smouldering crater. 
---
It’s probably because I’m a big fan of snowy locations though. Because bc is the no1 expansion by a long shot. Pre-welfare gear preferably.

&gt; log-in queues, crashes, sitting afk waiting for mab-tagging and sliding across the map in loot animations bc the database server is lagged out.
---
Ah, the true Vanilla experience..
---
Agreed. I hadn't read your post yet and thought about the hinterlands! Stonetalon mountains is pretty bad too. That place is so long.
---
But blizz want it for the first few weeks at max till phase 2 which could be months after launch.. which blizzard said themselves.. thats why it needs to be as abuse free as possible.
---
People were selling them on the AH. Other people were buying them and turning them in.
---
Also there was a lot of cross faction selling of the one side only mats.
---
Classic WoW subreddit is minority of the playerbase in interested in Classic WoW. Of that minority, a portion of them are not happy with layering (a new post made every couple of minutes).  
---
There is legitimate reasons to not be happy about them, assuming Blizzard doesn't fix some of the issues (so far they seem to be addressing it based on this post).  
---
But for the vast majority of players, and potential new players interested in Classic WoW, if launch is not successful (hours long queue, or clusterfuck starting experience), they may be discouraged, or pass the game.  
---
For Classic WoW community, they won't care, their dedicated already. They want that Vanilla experience.  
---
But Blizzard, a company that cares about profit, will care about all the players, the casual and hardcore. After all, their all players pays them. Remember, they aren't making Classic WoW to make us happy, they're doing it for the money.
---
A cheat is a cheat.  You should feel bad for cheating.  If you don't, then u r a bad person.
---
Alliance come from Darnassus or Theramore for AQ. And from IF / Menethil for Naxx. 
---
The asymmetry is part of it!
---
Just a subscription. Same base subscription, no changes to it. One subscription to play retail and classic on same account.
---
Addressing your first point, add the realm names to what I said, if you please. You understand the distinction between layers as something ephemeral and realms as separate ecosystems. "I held down Kurzen's Compound-Sargeras." If you were in Kurzen's Compound on this day and at this hour (and on this server), you saw me. There are numerous examples of this from retail vanilla wow - the guy who became infamous on his server for guarding the Menethil Harbor bridge comes to mind - which would not be possible if people were having separate experiences on separate layers. In no way are realms equivalent; I will never encounter the people who visited Kurzen's Compound on other realms. I will, at some point, randomly, encounter the people who came there on different layers. 
---
Addressing your second, this is difficult for us to predict at this point, but it's problematic no matter what. If the layers were more fluid, then I refer you to my first point. If they are more rigid, as you suggest, then it isn't any better. At the very least, the impact of layers (in this regard) can only be negative. We will not see *more* of people we've encountered before, obviously - it is only possible that we will see fewer. If the layers were "perfect" (and by perfect I mean the layers sort of function as their own ecosystems, as you suggest) then that just means that every layer collapsing will be an explosion of strangers who had a completely different experience than you as they leveled up. Neither possibility would be ideal, neither is conducive to storytelling.
---
And your third, of course we are going to run into issues of subjectivity when we are trying to determine if something is "good" or "bad" - inherently subjective terms. I don't think I will be able to explain to you the appeal of one, coherent server. Based on what you just said, it is only those really nice, easily describable experiences of running into the same person again that could make a single world unequivocally superior for you. I dispute your suggestion that these occurrences are rare, for one, but more importantly: even if they were rare, this reveals that you and I disagree fundamentally on certain things. The *knowledge* that you are in a single, coherent world obviously has no appeal for you. It does for me. It does for others. The possibility that someone will suddenly appear next to me because they "accepted an invite" (rather than they "were summoned" or "teleported") does not jive with the fantasy of the world I want to inhabit.
---
Yeah I couldn't get the Pick Pocket macro to work on Stress Beta. It would just open with whatever the action is. 
---
The Blind and Kick macro I would add "harm, nodead" spelling might be off going off memory.
---
If you can't quite decide before launch, I would definitely consider leveling up a Warrior with your girl first and run the Mage solo whenever she can't play. Reason being that the difference between solo and duo-leveling as a Warrior is pretty radical.
---
And yeah, I went ahead and assumed you will play more than your girl. r14 is no joke, and will demand a serious grind. The good news is that ranking won't be out before phase two, so you might be able to have two lvl 60s by then.
---
I hope in Fr/De servers, so I don't have to mix with those people.

You have the same conversational flow as Sam Hyde.

You are a textbook sophist and I don't forsee any meaningful self-reflection or growth in your future.
---
yeah but if youre mounting while being a druid youre doing it wrong
---
It's a beautiful chaos. Thanks for sharing!
---
I was a warrior and I farmed the water elementals in FelWood for Essence of Water.
---
I would clear them and then scope the area for mining nodes after.
---
uh 1-2% dps is huge
---
I agree with language specific servers, but who tf in europe doesn't speak english in 2019?
---
If that's a layer why do people think questing is going to be easy? I love the optimism, layering wasn't made so people can quest on launch though.
---
Argent Dawn and Cenarion Circle have some pretty nice rewards, but some weren’t added for a while after launch. I remember when they made EPL a major questing hub.
---
Hey peng, the best way to get around that is to just turn into a cat and prowl! I can't believe you guys were able to keep up with us in the tram and alli cities without it. Especially when we would just sit in the rowboats haha. Can't wait to start getting out of maps again.
---
Considering Warlock for the 1st time and was wondering a few things. Is there a good build that suffices for both PvP and PvE? Or do you mostly have to respec like Mages do? Also I’ve heard Alliance side Locks are much less popular? Would I run into issues here finding spots for either PvP or PvE content? And is there much downtime while leveling like for Mages (i.e. Mages having to drink very often) or are Locks more efficient in this regard?
---
Shadowmeld would be the only reason I'd consider rolling NE if I went alliance. Just so I could troll with MC. But, I think that would be rare to do for any length of time or even often and I know I would enjoy playing a dwarf much more. Sounds like you would too.
---
It's the winning strategy for them in my eyes. If they move on to TBC they'll split the player base (they said they'd keep Classic servers) then split it again if they go to Wrath. 1.14 is their ticket to keeping the classic community engaged and cohesive.

Wtf?! How are so many of you asking for new content? The entire point of classic is that it's a complete experience and doesn't need anything else. Get that shit out of here. You can't be pro-classic and demand new content. Fuck no.
---
If you only want to DPS then you shouldn't roll a warrior
---
I'd typically get my epic mount within 3 weeks of 60.  Usually I sell stuff from my gathering profession, do quests for gold, or farm stuff in high demand on the AH.  Big thing is not to buy anything on the AH until you've farmed the gold, which is hard to do when hit 52 or so and the gold starts rolling in.
---
Exalted is possible in the current game but I’m not sure when it was added (Legion?). There’s a quest that takes you to 999 exalted.
---
This dude Hakurai on youtube made a video guide for Alliance: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4jtC3TtAH0
---
Only watched a couple episodes since I'm planning on playing horde, but it seemed to be pretty in depth and one of the big differences is he is not speed leveling. He levels first aid, cooking, herbalism and alch as he goes and accounts for running dungeons and getting flight paths. Seems like it could be a potential guide to have on second monitor or in the background playing as you go.
---
Yeah its fair enough. Will be good once you have enrage, but you'd want to be an expert at it so you're not just eating bulk crits attempting it :P
---
There's a reason it is Warriors and not druids.
---
If the idea is to preemptively prevent people from layering it's a bad way to implement the system. You can't make the CD anything significant if you do it that way since even a 5 minute CD makes the system a major pain in the ass to deal with for people who's using it legitimately. 
---
But let's say it's 5 minutes, you can still loot the thing, wait 5 minutes change layer, loot again. For anything that takes more than 5 minutes to respawn (as in, most valuable things) that's still a win. Or for farming stuff you can clear out a zone, wait 5 minutes, switch layer, clear out the zone, wait 5 minutes rinse repeat. 
---
If you put the CD on the actual switch you can make it like 45 minutes or an hour and it would not cause major issues for people using it normally. Either way it's still completely abuseable, but with the latter at least you have to fill an hour doing something productive for it to be worth it.
---
The fact that private servers release one at a time does not prevent them from dying. The opposite: they have all declined after release.
---
Your vision of perfect is not the same as everyone elses vision of perfect. Thats why it doesnt matter.
---
I like it a lot. Reminds me of Scorpion from MK.
---
Defilers has one of the best tabards in game.
---
Takes forever to grind that rep out though. A lot of ABs.
---
I'm pretty sure that's been confirmed. That they're in this for a long run. Even if classic completely flops, they are dedicated to have it accessible in case anyone wants to try it.
---
That would mean keeping at least one #nochanges server no matter what happens in the future, be it classic+ or TBC or anything.
---
Slowly farmed mobs.
---
Yeah, Classic WoW was designed around "hey, I have this cool idea for X, can we fit that with the game mechanics?"
---
Retail seems to implement the game mechanics first and then the lore is an afterthought.
---
noob
---
What about cunt?
---
Twice? That sounds a bit suspect. You sure she didn't secretly want children and "forgot"?
---
Everything shreds on retro. Naxx gear does that to PvP.
---
Most of the private servers nowadays are set up in sketchy countries that don't enforce IP laws.
---
That's the smart choice. Unless you're going for server first there's NO reason to rush on launch week. You will get more out of your playtime the next week than launch week.
---
Well, 500g with the compounded interest of 3.5% per month over the past 14 years comes out to ~815g. Better get grinding buddy.
---
I've felt the same until last week when I picked up Mordhau, pretty good fun and not super expensive either. Not sure if it'll last me 60 days but its good enough for now
---
Rogue and Warrior share the armor token for Tier pieces in Naxx.  They are saying that rogues won't get priority on them since you often want to give your tanks first priority, then the situational OTs for Four Horsemen the next priority, then rogues last (DPS warriors don't want T6).  So, as a rogue, you won't get your tier until very late into Naxx.
---
You think you do, but you don't.
---
As soon as he started talking about ice cream, I knew exactly where he was going but it still didn't seem real until he actually said "Vanilla"
---
The basic issue is there just isn't much to talk about. Beta has understandably died down, so we are just kind of waiting for 2 months.
---
On my first char I sold Felcloth and Mooncloth. Also just did a lot of dungeons. People tend to under-estimate how much gold you make from doing dungeons if you're not constantly wiping.
---
Yeah? Try to speak English with a German that is around 25-30 years old.
---
You either get a broken mess or just a weird stare followed by a "My English is not good" because they never had to use it after school and as such their basic knowledge is, for the most part, gone.
---
I'm so sorry Philip
---
Man I’m playing a private server and my rogue is lvl 15 and leveling has been such a pain in the ass. If I pull more than one mob I’m in a bunch of trouble and have to constantly be eating/bandaging
---
I mean if you go into fatal anaphylactic shock if someone asks you to tank like some people do then yeah ok. If you're a normal person who doesn't mind chucking a shield on and spamming sunder for the 1 fight in 50 where it might come in handy for a guild, but 95% of the time will be a dps - a warrior seems like a much better option. Personally I wouldn't call that an 'OT hybrid' though. There's literally only a handful fights in the game that require more than 4 tanks - plenty of room for  *95% dps warriors*.
---
Don't do it! // u/future_throwaway_1738593740
---
It clearly says in 1.10 patch notes that it has been changed. Why would they put a bug into patch notes.
---
And bc was a new expansion, lots of balance changes. Classes were also changed heavily, they decided hunters didn’t need the nerf with the new changes in 2.0
---
I've seen people say this a few times, and it's definitely not the case. BFA launch was a massive shit show, I was amazed. Noone on my server could even log in for the first 8 hours, and there were consistent login and server stability issues for the first week.
---
Yeah all a rogue has to do is vanish to erase all their threat. They also avoid wipes and ganks in the world that way. Rogues have a ton of survivability and cc too. They are very gear/cd dependent though.
---
Riding training was cheap. The mounts were what was expensive. It was not common to see multiple mounts on characters because each mount cost so much.
---
This reversed at some point where training was the one-time high expense while the mounts became cheap, so you would pay the training cost upfront to get the selection of mounts at the cheaper cost.
---
Queing **is** the Classic WoW experience!
---
He is also right.
---
I don't know for sure what will work with classic as I've only had access to the demo and the stress test, but I can go over what I know about the current macro API as it most likely will be the case in classic, or at least most of this will be. I'll start with what I know first by saying that @mouseover is supported, so you can do ones for sap and pick pocket like this:
---
    #showtooltip
---
    /cast [@mouseover,harm,exists][] Pick Pocket;
---
Another thing to consider is that you cannot do multiple /cast commands in a single macro if they can't all be done within the same global. I don't know of any cases where this may be necessary as a rogue, but I can give an example as a warrior:
---
    #showtooltip Berserker Rage
---
    /cast [nostance:3] Berserker Stance; [stance:3] Bersekrer Rage;
---
You'll need to add conditionals if you wish to have a macro do more than one ability. You can use stance conditionals (form, noform, stance, nostance), target conditionals (harm, help), or binding conditionals (mod:shift).  
---
Now we go onto the more experimental stuff for classic.
---
This is one that switches between Cheap Shot and Kidney Shot based on if you're stealthed or not, but I don't know how stealth will work in classic (in retail steal activates its own stance, which is labeled as 0):
---
    /cast [nostance:0] Cheap Shot; Kidney Shot;
---
The @cursor conditional may also in classic so you can quick-cast any spell with an AoE reticle. As an example (though I wouldn't recommend this):
---
    /cast [@cursor] Distract;
---
If you wanted to heal people with your precious bandages for some reason but didn't want to have to click on them, but also still wanted to have some self-cast functionality, you can do something like this with the @player conditional:
---
    /use [@mouseover,help,exists][@target,help,exists][@player] Heavy Runecloth Bandage;
---
A cross fitter, a vegan, and a libertarian walk into a bar. I only know because they told everyone within five minutes.
---
There's also land mass east of redridge that isn't represented on this map for some reason.
---
I would start trusting the pserver homies a bit more in this regard. Retail players haven’t been used to a fresh server start and gold isn’t going to be circulating for a while, so learning how to literally grind gold drops and great vendor trash is gonna help a lot, once server economies establish in a month then the more traditional farming strats will net you more overall gold.
---
Classic doesn’t have inflated gold injections like dailies or world quests, and the gold from questing to 60 is going to cover 60% mount, skill training, bags and a head start on the early parts of your profession. 
---
In real vanilla the pro play is don’t go for epic mount on launch, take advantage of the low prices and finish your profs for pvp/pve for your main then start leveling an alt for farming mats and then you’ll be really ahead and have a farm toon for your epic riding in a month or two.
---
It's no different for warriors.
---
But private server mobs are usually tuned to be much harder than Classic/Vanilla.
---
I anticipate queues and a horrible stability, and I'm going to suffer through it all gladly. I'm going to go proper nostalgia with period correct music, junk food, and some manner of energy drink(s). My ears will hate me, my stomach will hate me, and my backside will hate me, and I won't care.
---
/petattack
---
/cast Shadowbolt
---
I think?
---
I love these kinds of videos. Please make more if you are enjoying it.
---
It's a win-win !
---
Cheating and impelling cheating agree with nobody’s vision of perfect. It matters. Holding your friends to a high standard while still accepting them despite their faults is the best thing you can do for them. Giving them a pass on shitty behavior is the worst thing you can do for them.
---
Mouse over are great for Rouge, as as loose combo points on our current target if we switch targets.
---
Another one is to pick pocket the target before using a stealth opener. Extra $$$
---
Gouge macro to gouge and instantly bandage so you don't waste a tick of your bandage.
---
Blind/Bandage
---
Stealth spam macro so you can spam stealth while you have a target blind/gouged or running away (Spam clicking stealth can often lead to you clicking again to exit stealth)
---
I'm sure there are many more.. All classes can and should be making use of macros
---
Stop making these threads. Classic and making new stuff don't go together. There is no new in classic. They're opposites.
---
I disagree with every point you raised.
---
As I said to my friend “once classic WoW comes out, I’ll be my 12 year old self again, and nothing will matter. I’ll feel safe again and all my stress will disappear”. Obviously this isn’t going to happen. But you should still enjoy WoW. Even a few hours a night. You don’t HAVE to go hard core. Just do a few levels here and then when you can. And remember the love and memories you have for the game.
---
I was a druid with the leatherworking profession. I solo farmed the Devilsaur dinos in Un'Goro and sold the Devilsaur sets for anywhere from 100-150g a set.
---
Brainlet tier
---
Dps warriors gear up just as easy. Most of the prebis we share is in ubrs. It’ll all be luck of the roll.
---
I really love soloing dungeons lol I plan on doing as much as I can and hope you’re enjoying them. If you have any suggestions on how to make them better feel free to let me know
---
Just roll a dwarf rogue and dumpster all over all the UD rogues walking around. It's seriously impossible for them to fuck with you.
---
Some dude was arguing with me about how the Longboi in BFA (5 million gold mount with AH vendors on back) is unfair because it isn't accessible to the average player.. they have over-done the accessibility to the point where people feel entitled to even the most obscure parts of the game.
---
I personally love the fact that not many had the longboi cause it was one of the few items in WoW that actually was that way. The fact that it had an AH on back made sense to me because to get 5 million gold your practically farming the AH.
---
Blizzard has been feeding that mentality for a long long time now.
---
I think vanilla wow might not be the game for you if you want an overly convenient race to 60. You can level up really fast in modern wow if you want without anybody else in your way.
---
A true jedi never dies..
---
Currently torn between warrior and warlock. I want to primarily PvP and will devote a good amount of time to the game but I am cautious that I wont find a spot in raids to attain wep/gear to help me along the pvp journey... As a warlock it feels like I will be far more likely be able to find a position in casual raids.   
---
I played a warrior in late vanilla - cata so I am familar with the class and do love it, but the drawbacks of a harder time farming at 60 etc make me uncertain
---
On this lass stress test i was the second person in northshire. I was able to stay ahead even as a rogue. If I’m able to do that at launch it’ll be easier. If not I’ll struggle till people who have work/school have to log off.
---
I found myself often just taking the rez sickness and then taking a 10 minute break. Annoying but simple enough!
---
I once grinded the entire level from 32 to 33 trying to find Helcular's Rod off the yetis in the cave near Tarren Mill.
---
The ooze covered bag quest would like a word with you.
---
In my case it was. We had a spreadsheet we could all view. The problem wouldn't be when we go all in on an important drop, but rather when I would bid 10 points on a small incremental upgrade only to find that RLs buddy had bid 12. No matter what number I put in, the winning bid would be juuuust slightly ahead. It was pretty obvious what was going on.
---
Remember its on a week night so a lot of people have school and work was in the morning. Those of us with pto will be able to push ahead after everyone logs for the night.
---
Lots of arcanite transmute cooldowns and getting lucky with a few world drops. Also being a cheap bastard and not buying small upgrades on gear.
---
This was some quality vontent, the World PvP comparison video was also fun!
---
You act like I haven't leveled to 60 on a pserver.
---
Is there a map of where to kill someone for their furthest graveyard walk home? I doubt it exists, but God it would be the most sinister thing.
---
It will go one of 3 ways:
---
1. Perfect launch: Smooth and crowded servers that open exactly at the time stipulated. You will be held back a bit on leveling because of the number of people around, but you will move forward at a reasonable rate... you will be in lvl 10 zone within a couple to several hours. Anyone with the smallest bit of patience should be O.K with this. 10/10.
---
2. Mediocre launch: Servers are overcrowded and there are occasional relogs needed. Servers are 1 hour late to be opened. Not all your friends are able to get on the same server for some reason. Once you're lucky and got in before the rest of your friends, you are in heavily over-crowded server and a lot of people are way ahead of you for some reason. But hey, you're playing! Woo! 7/10 (good for an MMO launch)
---
3. The Worst/Standard launch: Servers are 12 hours late to open. You now have to get up for work! Those who are not working are trying to create a character with their friends, but all the servers are full. Your friend Jamal got into HELIOS US EAST, but you cannot make a character unless it is on a European server because they are all full. Once you are in, you grind an overcrowded server for 2 hours to get to level 3, then there's a server reset and a wipe. You have to remake your character. 
---
Blizz tweet says, "servers will be up on the 30th and sorry for the delays". You log in one the 30th and have a perfect launch (see 1) but some rogue named StabzYa ganks you in Westfall when you're lvl 17. StabzYa is level 40 and has a mount somehow. Server wide announcement saying, "Guild Echelon has downed Ragnaros! Congratulation!". You /who 60 and notice everyone is in molten core at level 57-58- no one on the server has even hit 60 yet. You uninstall World of Warcraft. 0/10. Would do again when World of Warcraft 2 comes out.
---
Yes, but if you're tanking, you don't get to roll on DPS gear. And if you're not tanking, the tank is better off not bringing any other warriors so they get all the plate.
---
As a Warrior, I decided that getting r11 was more attainable than farming the gold. In hindsight I would have rather found a slow and steady gold farm.
---
&gt; Scatter didn't share DR for the majority of Vanilla 
---
Yeah, that's why it was in the 1.10 patch notes. This is not a bug, wtf. They clearly added Freezing Trap to a DR group in 1.10 and this cause the Scatter interaction. Peopel WANT this to be a bug for the 13s+ CC combo, but this is clearly not 1.12.
---
The aesthetics grind is real, and I love it
---
fuck you
---
!Fuck the mods!!! Revolt!!!
---
Noticed this too, odd lol
---
that, my friend, is a fantastic idea!!
---
And did you enjoy it?
---
Is autoloot enabled for classic?
---
OK, well since you asked. :) I edit video and sound as part of my job. One little thing you might think about it fading your music out while bringing the next track up. Of course, this isn't always appropriate, but there was at least one time when the music stopped in the video for a few seconds. I think it would have been cool for the beat to keep going in that instance (pun intended). Still enjoyed it though, and look forward to SM.
---
No it was the worst 6 days of my life.
---
Considering 1.10 has this line:
---
&gt;  Freezing Traps are now affected by diminishing returns.
---
It's clearly intended to have DR. It's impossible to tell if it should be in the Scatter Shot group, so all this "it's a bug!!!" shouting is people talking out of their ass because they want that long CC chain on hunters.
---
Yes, it's in the options.
---
Either way you can play a suboptimal build good at multiple rolls, or heal at maximum efficiency.
---
Many different kinds of CC are in similar groups or even have complete exceptions for balance purposes.
---
what color is your shirt right now?
---
I'm really excited to take up fishing. Never really bothered / understood about pools before.
---
Ochsenscheisse... there are many ppl 30+ in germany or france who are not this educated in english as you think. In Games like PUBG or Hearthstone you didnt need deep interaction. But this is a Roleplaygame
---
There's no point in keeping it for only a few days. As mentioned below, "a few weeks but no later than before phase 2" is their plan for removal. It's not only a starting area overflood protection, it's a population control mechanism that "needs" (based on it's concept) to be in the game until the majority of tourists left the game, and that's clearly more than a few days. Layering could be in for \~2 months, so these fixes are direly needed.
---
In what world is it insane? Picking a class based on the feel and the animations is a pretty normal thing to do.
---
I remember doing this in Cata for that deaf dragon.. can't remember the boss name, just that her soundwaves didn't hit were we stood.
---
Sarcasm or no?
---
I used to stealth solo BRD, fill my bags with dark iron, get to the black forge and smelt it.
---
I also got AV exalted for the cheaper epic mount.
---
Did the exact same for that very reason. 27th is more like the real stress test...hopefully things will be running smooth by that weekend.
---
Q E R T F C X Z - Shift / Alt modifers for 1-4 - I also used F1-4 for Food / Drink / Pots.
---
Never really needed more bindings. I don't see how WASD was ever a good choice for spells lol
---
Can we get some math on how much the average players will be contributing, provided everyone did an equal effort on the server?
---
Not really German community protest is nearing 20k posts and we already got feedback that blizzard is discussing this issue. Last update was 25.06.
---
Never said cheating. I said getting infatuated and not knowing what to do about it. Never meant cheating. I agree with you on the friends part.
---
Let's be real, Warriors coming back after 10+ years have A LOT more to adapt to than just Shield Wall.
---
Teaching the 12yo brother to PvP at a bare-minimum level so he can farm honor while i'm not playing..
---
I call bullshit on this. It’s WoW, you’re not a duck in gangster
---
They sure going to do that. But let's just wait what blizzard has to say.
---
See: Old School Runescape
---
&gt; @Zippo. Yup. I'm as adamant at preserving the playstyle in Classic as anyone but not making QoL, or class changes that will improve gameplay is completely ridiculous. Might as well save the $ and play on a P-Server. 
---
This is neither QoL or an improved gameplay. This is a complete balance change. The current limit already makes early bosses a lot easier, raising the limit even further would insanely increase the raid DPS. Not by switching warlocks to affliction, but by playing non dot classes and them being allowed to use all their tiny crappy dots on top of their usual dps.
---
I feel like there is very little consistency in moderation on this sub.
---
I'm talking about 2 or 3 years down the road. You can't have a game that ONLY has the same content for many years without adding new stuff.
---
Honestly at this point I would recommend learning a basic programming language like python and just make a single functions that calculates this for you.  
---
The math side is questionable though as its kinda hard to compare different criteria and their effects on your enjoyment based on a linear number scale but gl
---
&gt;I do not plan on going to the barrens on launch, even if I am ahead of a large percentage of people I will not be first and I expect \~75% to go to barrens.
---
Could you please explain how you plan to proceed after you reach level 11-12 in Tirisfal Glades? While practicing my leveling routes for launch (also on P-Servers) I have noticed, that Silverpines is considerably faster than Barrens for UD until level 15. After that you are out of Yellow Quests and all that remains are elite quests and the Fenris Isle quest chain. (not very xp-efficent)
---
Yeah sarcasm.  I enjoyed it quite a bit tbh.
---
The USA averaged 734 deaths per 100,000 people in the year 2000 (I was lazy and went with an early [google result](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/death-rate-per-100000/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D) instead of digging deeper).
---
This subreddit has 144,000 subscribers, that would mean about 1,052 deaths per year, or 175 in two months.
---
Now we all aren’t Americans and we don’t have as many elderly in our demo, but it is plausible 50 of us don’t make it.
---
I hope I make it.
---
War mounts are only 100g base price
---
[Note the comments from 1.9.4](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=12783/lieutenant-karter) 
---
So this saves you 900g base, as they require the minimum riding skill and not epic.
---
Baron Rivendares mount dropped for me. Easiest cake in life.
---
Yea thats for sure, it will be a nice reward for those who can learn the timing well. Ive also heard its easier to proc if you move with a movement key like strafing or moving forwards or backwards rather than going through the animation of sitting to standing. https://clips.twitch.tv/PlacidObservantClipsmomPipeHype he gets 4 in a row at the end
---
Only if they keep some servers 1.12 forever
---
No, he asked for unintended bugs that were present. Real bugs that people know about.
---
It also WAS mentioned in the notes. 1.10 clearly puts Freezing Trap on a DR, the notes simply didn't say in which group it is and what it DRs with.
---
Isn't carrying on an emotional affair behind your SO's back cheating? Isn't carrying on an emotional affair with an unavailable woman cheating? I'm having trouble understanding your perspective, here.
---
It didn’t. They did however give everyone with the rank 11 mount free epic riding skill with the change.
---
I’ll start exploring it more. I feel like today I got the full grasp of the zone and I’ll move on to 11+ soon. My next test is trying to skip most of the start zone Incase it is chaos
---
&gt; Well, sure, but if you do this, demonology tree should also be fixed. Also, if we're doing pet scaling, let's do hunters too. But if we do that, we need to give ret pallies a chance. But then druids would be the worst class, so let's give moonkin form a passive 20mp5, with a 8mp5 aura for allies. 
---
Oh no, and then most specs would be viable!
---
&gt;One of the changes may ruin the game we all desire.
---
Chances that **class balance** will somehow "ruin" the game: 0
---
I think you're confused.
---
I like the cut of your jib. Sounds like you're gonna roll Alliance...unfortunate haha.
---
The Affliction warlock backround is sooo damn cool!
---
Ya, like slower reflexes.
---
Okay to be fair I'd be pissed if my Lunchable had fucking water in it, I mean what the shit.
---
In PvE, yes.
---
this is awesome.  I would love to have something like that.  What a thoughtful gift.
---
For those interested in information from any specific faction, that's what I got from a bit of research:
---
Alliance:
---
Stormwind, Ironforge Clan, Teldrassil and Gnomeregan - Race-tied reputations, can be farmed through early level quests and cloth turn-ins. Exalted is necessary to buy other race's mounts.
---
Silverwing Sentinels - Warsong Gulch rep. Sells consumables, items and a tabard.
---

I believe this post is pretty late to be of any relevance, but I used it as a way to learn somethings as well. You may correct me if I have any wrong information or grammar, and I'll appreciate that!
---
Well I wrote it for myself so it's easily readable by myself. I'm also running the the route a lot so it's become more for reference at this point than a guide but I always want to optimize my route.
---
A guild can only reasonably complete two scepters due to raid lockouts before the War Effort ends. And with all the items known ahead of time, there might only be time for one scepter per progression guild.
---
Was one of the few skinners with finkles dagger.. skinned pristine hide of the beast and sold it for 900 gold in an hour 😃
---
Fewer people will risk it now that Blizzard has finally taken a stance on tmorph and will perma ban you for it.
---
You won't get to 60 7 to 8 days after release unless you're playing close to 24/7.
---
What the fuck are you even saying
---
Too early, spell batching kicks in. 
---
Too late, raid leader kicks you. 
---
Tough choices.
---
Just divide everything by 5,000 to 20,000.
---
Haha. How to fuck you game up even before releasing it. GJ Blizz, give me more reasons not to join :)
---
Dueling for gold.
---
Not to mention, releasing a new expansion is just repeating their mistakes. After 2 years, what do they do next? Keep rereleasing more and more expansions? Nah that's silly. Building on classic would be much better for the long term.
---
Sure it is. But see it this way: you meet someone online, become friends, suddenly you start to feel infatuated with the person and you feel insecure about how you can feel this way and what that means. At this point you have started an emotional affair but you also dont know what to do about it. Its not a clear cut situation. And this happens a lot and imo is totally ok.
---
Gold, obviously.
---
Use the AQ event to max rep, on all your characters if you really want. The gates are going to open regardless.
---
Nice battlestation bro! dab on the haters Beta wow style!
---
I believe the currently available ones would be not optimal at all. The optimal decision at the moment is to practice your own route or someone else's that you find reliable, with your own tweaks, and get used to it.
---
Leveling
---
Tanking has never ever been difficult.
---
I’m glad there are colorblind options in classic. While I enjoy the challenge you described (I have an issue with those too, thought everyone did). I am glad that distinguishing blue and purple will be easier.
---
And end-game greens. And scrolls to vendor.
---
 Woah brother, sick battlestation! It looks very cool and epic
---
They have been developing WoW for 15 years, homogenized all of the classes, pruned dozens of abilities, and even normalized gear and they STILL can't achieve true 'class balance' so good luck with that
---
There's no reason they need to make the same mistakes as the live game. They could just expand horizontally, even including new low level zones. I don't really think a new raid is a good focus.
---
Thank you for the feedback! I couldn’t decide what to do with the footage I had and the 3 songs being longer timewise than the video. Was trying to not have a new song start playing at the end of a boss kill and be going wild before next boss shown. That’s definitely something I’ll need to figure out. Thank you ❤️ I’ll put some extra time into learning that
---
Haha yes I forgot about the empty tanaris! Great times :)
---
If you inadvertently begin an emotional affair, you can either cut it off, or cut off your relationship. Those are your only moral options. There's a huge difference between having a harmless little crush and the long-term pattern of secret communication you're describing. Imagine if your SO did this to you. Imagine learning they'd been secretly talking to someone else and escalating things behind your back until they ditched you for someone you never saw coming. It would be a pretty awful feeling, wouldn't it? There's a reason they're keeping this secret from her ex, and it's not just to spare his feelings. It's because they know they began the relationship in a shady, shitty way.
---
Shit you're supposed to get paid for doing that??
---
he was assuming the time between phase 2 and phase 3 wouldn't be longer than it originally was (about 2 months between honor system and wsg/av patches) which wouldn't be quite enough time to make it before battlegrounds grinders lock you out of being high enough. on smaller realms maybe it would work?
---
Unless something unexpcted happens the average age of players in Classic, after the tourists quit, should be significantly higher than in Retail WoW. So I assume that there will be a lot of people that settle for a more casual playatyle focusing on doing Dungeons with friends.
---
Quite a few people are going insane with current bugs on discords I follow saying this and that about the death of Classic already, and I'm not exaggerating.
---
Myself, I believe the team will keep on delivering that the community asks for, and we will finally be able to relive the experience we're so much looking after and can't find in any other game.
---
Are those cheaper than normal epic mount?
---
$20 is easily worth the time saved
---
And I'm guessing it didn't have layering? So either you started at launch and made it through the overpopulation without requiring the game the be ruined, or you started later when the population had already dwindled. Why can't you do that for classic?
---
Did you ever find the other 7 wolf meat in there?
---
Wha?!? Bruh the drag at night is where its at.  If that isn't your cup of tea the Cleft of Shadows is wild AF
---
As if warriors are less gear dependent.
---
Is it hot in here?
---
It will be much more time consuming than you can imagine. A "couple" of hours will turn into 5hours or more each session due to the constant travel times etc.  
---
But this is not a complaint, it will be worth every second of it trust me.
---
Well my point is there's plenty of shit to bind long before your movement keys like you said
---
Quick question can multiple people get legendary weapons like sulfuras in one server?
---
Factorio its such a simple but also complex  factory building game, I can pretty much work on it whenever I want and put it down whenever I need.
---
What if you don't know what to do? A more realistic thing to do is to take the time to figure it out. What long term thing are you talking about? Im not sure we're talking about the same thing anymore.
---
haha brother dab on them haters i def gonna be gaming this hard too when wow vlassic pickles releases :okhand: :joy: :100:
---
a) forget rushing to 60 in a week. not going to happen.  Not in 2 weeks. not in 3 weeks.    
---
b)  playing hardcore in the first week is fine, you can then discover if the game is something for you and you can see how far  you come.  but set your expectations on which level to reach LOW!!!!  
---
c)   you can raid towards AQ40 fine without flasks, on a casual play schedule.  Don't worry at all
---
d)  don't worry about farming pre raid gear.  This will come naturally as well. 
---
e)   enjoy the game.  
---
f)  it's a game   
---
g)  not your second or 3rd job
---
Fucking litty brother, rank 14 here I come.
---
fuck yes bruther man, you're going fucking gamer mode I bet
---
its like 1200$ now or something, lol
---
No they shouldn’t. Next stupid idea from the community.
---
&gt;apparently my good friend irl was talking to the guild leaders GF in whispers all the time about non game related stuff. one day he somehow convinced her how amazing she would look with a different hair color, and then if she lost weight etc etc
---
The way you present this makes it seem like a long-term affair. People aren't dishonest about things they're proud of. Her ex being in the dark about what happened is not an accident.
---
Should hunters also be allowed to Serpent Sting?
---
*Insert Bubbles talking about Piss jugs*
---
Mages are better at that, furthermore hunters can farm DMT which is a lot more solid gold.
---
Brother you have no idea, I have 400 Monsters n the fridge and I fucking dab on Red bull
---
From what I remember, each zone had a certain fishing level. You fished trash until you reached the skill floor from that zone, and get higher chance of valuable loot the higher your skill
---
It would change the game completely. It affects everything, pve, pvp raid composition etc. It will not be classic if they do those changes. The imbalance is one of the things about vanilla that made it interesting.
---
Haha brother, I would do the same but the wife said I can only play 30 minutes, you know how it is brother haha
---
&gt; blue and purple
---
Always been such a hard thing for me.
---
Old school RuneScape. Will be getting some afk 99s on my way to lvl 60 in classic.
---
Not being able to use an ability to stop eating/drinking or dismount will annoy the piss out of me.
---
Any source of gold that bids on taking gold from hands of other players isn't going to work for couple of months after release. 
---
Selling portals is not going to be a hot shit unless it's a monthly event.
---
It can still be abused even with a CD. This change probably means layering will be permanent
---
Would love doing this
---
I too am in love with sweeping strikes and cleave. Each cleave hits both targets twice, so 4 hits in one swing.
---
That's nice that you hate it. Now who the hell are you talking to? Lol.
---
Wrong crowd
---
Sorry, What's BoS BIS?
---
Leeroy or Leeroyjenkins
---
I did princess in maradon as a priest, I think I grinded maybe 300g there. The rest I got from doing dungeons and selling enchants.
---
Warlocks are, in general, more time consuming to play, deal less damage (until later), more difficult to master, much fussier to gear best-in-slot, really benefit from shadowweaving which you will likely not have, and above all perhaps, have to play Gnome if they want to min/max on alliance.
---
It's been a common saying since '04 that if you wanted a raid spot, play heals or ally lock. If you do either, you'll find a multitude of guilds that will take you in and give you gear with a minimum amount of effort required on your part. Of course, you can still get a raid spot and gear otherwise, but you will have to do more farming, go to more raids you don't need, be more available, bring more consumables, play better, etc, in order to make it work.
---
If you play every day, play what you like. If you play twice a week and still want to kill C'thun you're gonna want to roll heals or ally lock.
---
Yes. And if they want to expand on that while leaving vanilla playable as close as it was for me and hundreds of thousands of people who have been asking for that for years, great.
---
Farmed thorium and arcane crystals over and over in Un'Goro.
---
Bloody Susan...
---
lasts 3 mins &amp; has 2 min or so CD
---
Yah man I really want a heal spec for my rogue. I dont understand why blizzard hasn't fixed yet.
---
Dude thats the second time you have confused me someone else. I read through our replies and we are kinda in agreement. We're talking about the same thing, not this particular case, but cases like this in general. You are a bit more clear cut on when it becomes bad and im a bit less clear cut on that. You: "if you become infatuated make the choice now". Me: "if you become infatuated, take some time to make the choice". Basically
---
Yeah, sure. Everyone complaining are pservers owners. Don't forget to spit it out.
---
&gt;what if you are on an active account currently even playing world of Warcraft but do not have a subscription
---
...what?
---
As the guild i applied too needed priests, once i joined some officer from the guild took several new ppl through the attunement process.
---
Great thing was i had farmed full devout before joining the guild so i was invited to raids very quickly and helped down raggy the upcoming weeks.
---
that is not how you interpret a statistic, lol
---
My idea is for a raid, Siege of Undercity but by Scarlet Crusade since they are still powerfull in vanilla. Attunment would involve finding demon coeeuption in their ranks and slaying Balnazar, because of demons Alliance would get involved too. Quest givers: Argent Dawn, Sylwanas and Bolvar. Last boss: Mal'Ganis.
---
BFA ?
---
The trash was added later to make it easier to level up fishing.
---
Your fish gets away until you're at a high enough skill level, and you only have a chance at increasing your skill if you actually catch something.
---
"Have you looked at our bodies? They got *skulls* on them."
---
Wanted to just see inside mc so made a raid with a buddy and after unsuccessfully entering mc by yeeting ourselves out the window next to the elf we learned from an onlooker what exactly it meant to be attuned to anything. We were not even 60 so it wasnt like a super time wasted at max level not raiding situation. Very thankful for whoever fixed my buddy and I after they watched us die in a fire out the window...yes maybe we didnt do it right did in fact come up and yes we did it multiple times for science.
---
Orc rogue would shred the dwarf.
---
Bfa launch went super smooth
---
What kind of reply is this? Literally nobody is asking for that.
---
Yeah, sorry about the doubled-up confusion. This is what I get for replying to a bunch of different threads and viewing each comment in isolation. I'll try to be more aware of this in the future.
---
I'd describe my position as, "If you start having these sorts of feelings, you need to have a dialogue with your SO and figure out why. Otherwise you're keeping secrets, and that's the death knell of a relationship."
---
What’d the comment say?
---
I used to do laps of ungoro mining thorium. Had my hs set there for my whole time ranking. Took a long time.
---
People will complain just to complain. The infamous "No changes"-crew.
---
Honestly, we had people complain that you could move your characters in the character selection. If people can complain about that, you bet your ass they will complain about just about everything.
---
I remember my exact winterspring route as well. This included grabbing chests around the zone and killing mobs that dropped certain rare items.
---
Damn why is my class so fucked up rn
---
Fuck man are you trying to 1 up me?? Nice fucking battle station bro! Oh the haters are gonna be mad at this, looking so fucking comfortable and sexual.
---
Bit of a retard innit.
---
I just really hope they do some balancing so I can be a viable healer, as well as a dps. And maybe they could throw in a tank spec that would be viable.
---
Like others have posted, no chance you'll be getting to 60 in 7/8 days, especially if you've never played vanilla.
---
Might as well take your time, play for 2-3 hours and slowly level up. Its not like retail where if you dont start raiding soon you will fall behind the curve...people will always be running dungeons and every raid at 60, that's why classic is great!
---
You're full of shit bud. Ion said initially that layering was for the starting zones for a couple of weeks. Now its across all zones, with an unknown time frame. Why would anyone with half a brain believe a single word that comes out of his mouth?
---
 BIG NEWS: If noone would care and complain about layering it would of stayed in the original state until release. I am really surprised how people accept terrible product and even is happy about it rather than trying to point out OBVIOUS issues.
---
We need them so the rest of us dont have to deal with clueless Spanish people, and people from Portugal. Obviously no Russians as well please.
---
Theres no limit to any legendary item (sulfuras, thunderfury, ateish or black Qiraji resonating crystal).   
---
The only reason few people have the mount is because once the event is over its no longer obtainable.  
---
none of the other legendaries are bound to events that can expire. (except for ateish when they removed old Naxx in wotlk?)
---
The Russians can just not play on Russian servers. 
---
There, I fixed your "problem"
---
Haha brother you know it is for sure! You better be chugging the monsters to this one tonight brother
---
I hated farming, so I only farmed up like 200-300G and made the rest by diddling the AH. 
---
- Buying up stacks of resources &lt;20, normally at a lower price per unit than full stacks, combine then resell at a profit.
---
- Buying resources during peak hours when the market was flooded with farmers, selling during off-peak hours when they were off line. Also cleaning up the residual lower-priced items as well then immediately re-listing at a markup
---
- Clearing out all the listings for lower volume items, then trickling them back in one at a time to drive the price up a bit. 
---
- Buying stuff off /2, normally at a much lower price than AH. 
---
I was on a pretty busy server (Khaz'Goroth), so the margins could be razor thin at times, but it sure as hell beat mining ore for months on end...
---
Farmed crusader and plague bloom in wpl
---
&gt;I feel like if it was worth anything, someone on some private server somewhere would have made a meta out of it. 
---
I wouldn't count on that. I was on a wotlk server as a resto druid and I had talents that no one picked and a trinket that noone used (the scarab brooch). I was able to heal a lot more than anyone else, and I don't think I'm a good player, above average at most.
---
Just because a lot of people play the same game for a really long time it doesn't mean that they will theorycraft something new.
---
These are my favorite posts on this subreddit.
---
Warrior with a healer behind you is the most fun you can have in vanilla pvp.
---
I still really hate the thought of running around thinking "there could be other people here in the same place on a different layer", big immersion breaker, especially the chance of seeing people you know. Feels like blizz/others only care about groups/friends when it comes to other players
---
I dont think it will stay interesting when content is on farm.  Might take months if not more but I can definitely see them doing balancing eventually.
---
Was funny though.
---
I agree with that.
---
Its horrendously tuned at every server launch. Being in a cave is a death sentence because its constant spawning. 
---
Lines of people fighting for lootable spawns for quests. 
---
Constant "fixes" to dynamic spawning stated by the GMs because its constantly changing and completely fucks with it. 
---
Instantaspawns breaks any sense of immersion with lag unbearable. If your computer can load the mob faster than the rendering speed then you have an advantage because of tagging.
---
That !
---
His American. Thats excatly how the president would interpret this.
---
He dosent care because his viewers will wipe his ass the entire time with gold/mats etc. He has the audacity to talk about vanilla as if hes going to get the real experience. We all know this shill never played vanilla, and with all of his dickriding viewers carrying him in classic, of course he wont care about layering
---
This would make for a great online quiz.... I consider myself an expert on vanilla matters, and most of these had me stumped, I'd say only 3-4 I was confidant on...
---
The thing about alliance wl in pvp is that there's gonna be a lot of undeads that can break your fears with will of the forsaken (their racial ability) . I think it's Platinum Wow that mentioned there were around 40% undeads in pvp in vanilla, so that can be a pain in the a. Regarding macros, that is really where the skill ceiling kicks in. There's lots of choices to be made when to use what pet and of course when to use what spell on what focus, but that's the same as for hunters. Not complicated for PvE though. 
---
When it comes to leveling, it's one of the easier classes to play. You hardly have any downtime as you can let your bouncer pet tank, convert health into mana and then drain life back up to full health.
---
In PvE, it will take a bit of end game progression for you to shine dps wise as wls are quite gear dependant. However, you are a must in raids because of your utility (health stones, summoning, etc.).
---
Don't know about the specs though :(
---
Thats the twist, he's going horde
---
Tinfoil hats.. ON! CLASSIC IS DOOOOMED!!!
---
I had the same thing, I would suddenly think "OMG! xlegolaszx I need to make a hunter to use this name!"
---
Honestly, outside of lore, it comes down to other classes. Druid with kings buff is vastly superior in raiding environment especially if you want to be feral.
---
In PvP, tauren have an advantage because you don't have to deal with purge which murder your hots and murder your free action potions.
---
&lt;Mcconnell&gt; clan in force!
---
Quite the stretch considering you have no idea what the cooldown actually is.
---
After doing some UI adjustments i started seeing the swing timer better, and suddenly it hit me that the auto shot was almost delayed the same amount of time as the melee swing, but then again we found out it was more correlated to the Bow swing timer...
---
So it would seem that a melee attack resets the ranged weapon swing timer but not the other way around, so there is something wrong going on here.
---
Not at all. Get your head out of the sand.
---
Sounds like you're terrible at making gold.
---
A friend of mine are still looking for a companion on German servers for our 48h classic wow marathon. Marathon doesn't mean we'll rush things, but rather play a shit load :') dm me if you wanna join. We're playing alliance, warlock and (rogue/warr - he's not 100% certain yet)
---
I’ve tried using the colourblind mode, but I can’t seem to find one that fits for me. So I guess I’ll just play like I did back in the day - not finding fuck all on the ground 😆
---
The tinfoil hatting here is so fuckinc crazy. Hilarious, but crazy. Any change to layering other than it being removed is apparently a sign it's here permanently.
---
I think whoever owns that'll die of cancer or diabetes before classic launches.
---
So improving layering during the time it'll be active is now a bad thing? First everyone screeches about how it's abusable and the second Blizzard tries to address it it's all of a sudden a sign it's here to stay permanently? How do you even spin this shit in your brain, honestly?
---
thats what it looks like, hope that blizzard can confirm.
---
They're a hell of lot closer than classic.
---
You can, at least, bring every spec to relevant content and expect to be able to clear it.
---
Nope, everyone can download it since the last battle.net app update.
---
Everyone has the option. If you actually login it just says no servers.
---
You're the only one, never seen anything like this on reddit before....
---
More evidence of this likely being a bug: [https://youtu.be/Y58rz1\_OZcE?t=572](https://youtu.be/Y58rz1_OZcE?t=572) \- This clip from shows a melee attack going off at frame 17113 autoshot fire animation starts at frame 17203. That's 3.0s in between auto shot firing and a melee swing. Hunter is using a 3.2 speed melee weapon.
---
I was taugh english since 5th grade.  
---
I am fluent in english. text and speech. 
---
I still prefer a german realm.
---
it has nothing to do with language barrier or any other conjecture.  
---
its how I played the game 2005 its how I want to play the game 2019.
---
no one is keeping you from joining an EU server. no one.  
---
they are still there. why do you want to deprive others of their preferred choice?
---
If we don't at least get oceanic lableled servers im not playing.
---
That's interesting! I had assumed that horde would be more attractive for hardcore raiding/speed runs because of warchiefs blessing and windfury totem.  
---
Not that its going to affect my decision, i played Alliance in vanilla and i was a massive noob then.
---
So basing something off of nothing is logical now? Got it.
---
Finally a picture I'm in! (Dead horde below the raid frame)
---
Do you actually expect people to constantly be rerolling toons in order to level in new zones? Especially since there's no way they could release enough zones to be able to level from 10 to max in any sort of reasonable time frame.
---
its gotta be one of each or there will be outrage.
---
Yea i did that aswell for farming nature resist gear for Princess huhuran in AQ40 and it was No problem, but I cant speak for release as I never did it in gear inferior to T2 tho. But I dont see it as a problem as it would be easier for your Pet to hold aggro on The fat Princess
---
Depends which realm you're on the full ones area 52 for example, had some log in issues that lasted six hours or so.
---
Loot council is great until someone thinks it was unfair. (even if it wasnt)
---
nobody can argue with who gets what items in a properly run DKP system.
---
Got lucky with world drops. Namely a Dwarven Handcannon on my Rogue and a Krol Blade on my mage.
---
You saved the world like 5 times by now, everyone thibs you are a god.
---
who would want to call dire maul DM  
---
it is Deadmines, the release dungeon vs a later patch dungeon.
---
Its actually true though. There is a developer interview about it because Druids were exclusively NE but they had to change lore so Taurens could have it too.
---
Official language of the nordic servers? Danish.
---
Okay thanks for opening my eyes about the leveling. Im underestimating it.
---
You are the chosen one!
---
That is too slow to know if he had to wait for the ranged weapon speed to fire the shot.
---
Blizzard is on that team, don't pretend it'd be caving
---
Are you a big streamer? No? You don’t have to worry about this then
---
&gt; How about you guys stop being so fucking stubborn and speak a language whom more or less everyone in Europe has in common
---
during sparetime activities, outside of computer games, which language do you usually speak?
---
Now if they can investigate the case before it gets accepted I’ll be okay with it.
---
However it is automated, and people WILL right click to report you if your the main tank of a raiding guild that your competitions against them. Now it’s only for 2 hours, but rip the worlds first.
---
It is automated and that’s the problem.
---
back in classic we used a zero sum system, and implemented decay as a tax that was used to pay out extra for raids people didn't want to show up to.
---
Nice level 2 sword you put on him!
---
I can't remember if it said exactly or if it just approximated it (I have a feeling it was the latter) but there was definitely a way to get a rough idea.
---
I never had a bank alt in vanilla.... But I'll have one this time!
---
This has nothing to do with PvE.
---
Grim Dawn (best ARPG since D2), Pathfinder (best D&amp;D since BGII). I don't get how some people say there are no good RPGs in recent years..there are, but not made by huge studios.
---
Oh man my hatred for the rogue class. I can’t. Warlock all the way!
---
More like scanian. A perfect mix of Swedish and Danish
---
Thank you, I love it too! I picked it because I thought it matched the WoW vibe. It kinda looks like castle battlements :)
---
You do realize a paladin can dispel DP and shadow word with one cast? Priests can also dispel diseases as do dwarves with their racial.
---
In any organized pvp DP will do absolutely nothing, as it just gets dispelled immediately.
---
Choosing a racial, which is only useful, when there is no paladin and no priest around + your target is not a dwarf and is so extremely expensive to cast seems fairly useless to me.
---
If you haven't leveled in vanilla before, getting to 60 in less than about 6 or 7 days played is going to be unlikely. Even with a leveling guide. But that doesn't mean going hard at the start is a bad idea given your stated goals. If you can get to the low 50s in a decent amount of time there will be a lot of 5 mans running for pre raid gear and attunements, so getting a group together and going should be quick. If you're in the first wave they should be pretty experienced groups and go smoothly. Semi casual guilds will be getting set up and getting their feet under them for a few months, maybe even into P2, so you won't 'miss the boat' or anything like that. Just run what you can and you should be fine. Most guilds only raid 2 nights a week anyway. 
---
As for gold, maybe if you're horde parked in kargath you could make decent money from portals. But I don't think you'd get enough business to pay for raids just from selling portals. Especially if you aren't doing that during prime hours.  But you could easily play the auction house, flipping mats, or be an alchemist and either buying the herbs or gathering when you have some free time. You can make serious money that way.
---
I played as a mage for years only playing 3 days a week. Two raiding and one either PvP, farming, dungeon runs, whatever, and then the occasional lazy Sunday where I played more. I was able to clear naxx as a guild officer (private server) with that schedule.
---
tailoring = bags.
---
absolute gold on new servers.
---
I know it doesn't always work with songs with people singing, especially if done to a greater degree, but I will sometimes -- especially with instrumentals -- slow the song down even 1 percent or w/e to where it isn't even noticeable really and over a few minute song, that can fill that gap. No one is any the wiser.
---
That’s a hell of a deal considering it’s $20 to buy a token in retail for a fraction of the worth
---
It’s amazing rogue vs rogue to the point of being broken. 
---
Facing a rogue isn’t a problem and then you just mash your sap macro so even a tiny blip will get them out of stealth.
---
Kings buff outsets that by a wide margin.
---
Sees someone dying on escort, mind control cap, heal them, un mind control.
---
i played during vanilla and put in 5-16hrs a day until I hit 60 and it was on the 22nd day I dinged 60.
---
I don't remember my time played... but I do remember running out of quests and grinding on certain mobs to make the last few levels.
---
I played a hunter and followed some the better strats at the time, and I thought I was casual and I had a lot to learn... I was also one the first handful of people to ding 60 on my server.
---
I have to add I did enjoy the journey and I ran every dungeon at least once and now that I'm older, I don't know if I could honestly sit and grind to 60 that fast again... maybe if I had a super nice comfy chair to sit in ... hmm ;0)
---
Not getting the opener is huge for rogues.
---
Just to add to this so others realise how it got. My server was Alliance dominated for most of Vanilla so what some of the larger Alliance guilds did was farm horde materials, send them on neutral AH then hand them in. This is the only brief window in WoW where I ever witnessed the two factions having a true sort of truce. Our forums changed overnight as Alliance guilds offered to help the Horde because we knew from the get go that us Hordes were going to keep this back just due to sheer size discrepancies.
---
Anecdotally I also found people would gank me less if I was farming in the world, my most vivid memory of this coming from me getting a squeaky bum moment when I got sapped by a rogue in Winter spring and 3 raiders from a very well known progression alliance raid appeared from behind a rock, turns out they were just offering me their kills for skinning and wanted to make sure I knew (cue spam /point macros and various /cuddle /love and such). 
---
The AQ effort was a weird time in WoWs history and it was amazing.
---
Gamebreaking issue: it works like it did on the real game. Yeah okay.
---
On point
---
I had always hoped they would do something with the Syndicate. Like getting enough rep with them made you neutral with the main factions or something; not trusted by them anymore but not hated since you're doing shit behind the scenes for both or something. Maybe opens up some new, hidden flight points.
---
Idk, these are grand ideas. Honestly I would've been fine with something simpler like a bandana or a whole outfit like the bloodsails.
---
God bless streamers for bringing these bugs to the forefront.
---
As a paladin I always loved when UD priests engaged on me with DP + shadow word. Priest is a pretty hard counter to paladin, but if they waste 1.5k mana on two dots I can immediately dispel, they pretty much defeated themselves.
---
lol no
---
I honestly spent half a year farming gear good enough so various guilds would invite me to raid.
---
RNG was a bitch with boss drops in vanilla and I remember wearing green of the monkey shoulders at 60 for the longest time...
---
Those were newly opened servers where Blizzard forgot to turn off the sceptre quest I'm not aware of any Vanilla servers that didn't have the gates open before Naxx as I'm sure Blizz put an automatic unlock timer on it eventually.
---
definitely going to be a lot of dps warriors, there always is IMO. I never rolled a warrior, are they hard to farm with?
---
And this is why I play a hunter.  I make everyone else do the STV run back.
---
I had more fun leveling a druid than a warrior, take that for what's it worth.
---
Well just because you dont see the reason, doesnt make it less BiS...
---
Same I got my epic mount from R11
---
did you play much WoW later on? If you're totally fresh to the game know that leveling a warrior is a long road, and leveling a prot warrior (if you don't plan on paying to change your talents once you hit max level) takes a long time.  
---
That being said, if that's what you're in to, go for it!
---
I wanted to add something to my other reply:
---
Mage is a good character to play on a busy schedule.
---
The person with the head is only allowed to make deputies every so often too so they can't just suddenly make their entire guild deputies.
---
&gt;All they care about is saving money tbh.
---
^ This
---
It's all about saving money, so their solution isnt to invest on hardware for more and better servers but on the software that is cheaper, layering and sharding.
---
Blizzard have been canceling projects and cutting on costs in all their games.
---
Off the top of my head, [cutting developers bonuses](https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/blizzard-axes-employee-bonus-plan-1202968521/) as to drive talent away from the company, [downsizing hots developers](https://wccftech.com/heroes-of-the-storm-team-downsized/), firing 800 people all the while making [record profits](https://www.polygon.com/2019/2/16/18226581/activision-blizzard-layoffs-executive-pay-unions) etc etc...
---
That's a chonky boy
---
What do you mean basing something if nothing? A cool down would have that effect, seriously you can't handle facts?
---
Where am I going astray?
---
Thanks for *sharding* 😉
---
I applogize, ill see myself out...
---
Obviously it's Druid, but the vast vast VAST majority will be healers, and only a couple Druids are needed per raid. whereas you can have a ton of the other classes and be fine. Druids may be the lowest in the polls, but only barely, and they're also the least in demand class there is, outside of maybe Paladin, but even they're better healers than Druids.
---
Are you sure that once this type of spot in know that only 10% will do it ? Nowadays, I doubt...
---
Whether you're the 2nd tank or the 5th, you'll spend a lot of time doing something else for the fights where you aren't tanking. I think you should base your decision on what you want that to be, and by extension, how you plan to spend your time outside of raids.
---
As a druid, you're either going to be dpsing without the cat talents or healing/decursing. 
---
As a warrior, you'll probably be fury/prot, and possibly using one of the debuff axes or keeping up demo/thunder clap depending on how your guild does things.
---
Also consider that warrior tanking is a bit more interactive and doesn't require farming gnomer every week. In addition, you'll have much more tank gear actually come from raids as a warrior.
---
A proper N.E.E.T station.
---
This guy fucks
---
I'm out of the loop too, do i need to buy the latest expac (BFA) or will the subscription suffice?
---
I've played the game since vanilla (took a break during middle of cata-mop) and have never had a problem with being a tank, but I know it was so much different in vanilla. And I was planning on leveling with some friends, that way if I play a prot warrior, we'll always have a tank for elite quests, dungeons, etc... which would he nice, but I'm just not sure how much I'll like tanking how it was way back then
---
I know that voice
---
Fuck yes. I am super psyched.
---
This isn't BFA. Mounts are faster than travel forms. You'll definitely be using your mount a lot as a druid.
---
second person on that layer QQ
---
Master of evasion and friendship for everyone
---
You know he's not wrong. We've all gotta scratch that itch, some are just better at controlling it and being rational than others...
---
[It's more like 40%.](https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?faction=Horde&amp;minLevel=40&amp;realm=Classic%20Beta%20PvP)
---
And one logs on..
---
I cant play anything. Any wow-related game is just a waste of time since I wont be playing it in 2 months. And any game not wow-related sucks because I just want to think about wow.
---
It’s bad
---
No way. Increasing debuff limit would mean nerf boss because you'll do more dps.
---
I remember the day they downed Neff. Orgrimmar was buzzing :&gt;

classic its not gonna be free and thus u cannot exactly meet ur bank alts face to face but will have to rely on mailing them ;)
---
This screenshot is dated 2/6/2006, almost exactly 1 year after I bought WoW (2/15/25, my 25th birthday).
---
Also: This was actually my second 40, though the first character I got to 40, I was not very attached to. I have no screenshots that I can find of that original Human Warrior, but here is my oldest screenshot, dated 11/07/2005: http://puu.sh/DLoeR/6d1b174f16.PNG
---
That's going to be immensely unpopular. They need to make new servers with the additional content and leave the classic-only realms intact.
---
People should be able to copy classic characters to new-content realms to carry on, but keep their classic chars too.
---
I wouldn't want to go up against anything naxx geared using that build xD. It sounds fun for the memes.
---
Here be dragons
---
You only need bfa if you want to play it, for Classic a subscription will suffice.
---
Just responded under my own comment but to reiterate you're asking for something different than classic (think classic +), which is fine to want, but is not the same as what blizzard promised to the fans who have been there since the beginning. Call me dense to make yourself feel better but updated models in classic makes no sense.
---
I feel like everything I have planned will change once that character creation screen pops up.
---
And you get 39 other people proof reading through the 30+ /rolls for generic items like Onys head to make sure there are no shenanigans.
---
I did the Ony attunements as part of doing quests in Burning Steeps after I hit 60.  I got stuck on jail break for quite a while because no one could tank worth shit back then.  I wasn't really sure what the quest chain was for, but it was interesting.  
---
When I finally found a group who could do jail break they explained to me what the quest line was all about and I ended up trying to death run to see Ony a couple of times.  Took months before my server had enough keyed people to make an attempt.
---
The icicle rod is a bad option. I see this a lot that people focus too hard on top end damage for weapons, but weapon speed still matters until you have Mortal Strike, as does having strength on the weapons.
---
You will kill much slower if you only swing every 4s vs 2.9 seconds, so you have to think if you are trying to go for killspeed, or big crits. If its big crits by all means go for it, but for killspeed there are better alternatives - the vendors in Menethil where the icicle rod is rewarded for example sell the Executioners Sword which is a better alternative.
---
Feel free to talk down to me because I have no idea why swearing in a WoW podcast would either bother or offend you.
---
And you often hear Hungarian people ask for their own server? Ive played with thousands of people from all over europe for more than a decade now, and nobody except french/german maybe spanish people want their own server. Ive yet to meet a Hungarian or Dutch person unwilling to speak english.
---
everywhere. you're assuming that everyone is equally likely to fall into any of the fatal categories. gamers in general and reddit users are less likely to die in a homicide, suicide and terminal illness due to socioeconomic privilege. we're also less likely to die in traffic because we're a younger demographic and less likely to own a vehicle. we're less likely to die in work related environments because our hobbies are similar and we gravitate towards academic studies and not hazardous industrial jobs. 
---
if you want to make any guesses on how many people on the sub that'll die before launch you'll need a survey with 21.000 participants for a 99% confidence level and an error of margin of +/- 5% you'll need to narrow it down to white males by region, socioeconomic class, occupation, level degree of education and health. by then you can probably make a decent estimate but it takes a lot of work
---
In 1.12 we will have many more quests than at the start of vanilla around patch 1.1 - 1.5 (if you played that early)
---
&gt;  mainly from kargoz' class guides
---
Let me just tell you that Kargoz doesn't know jack shit. 
---
He is just reposting what he's reading on the Nostalrius forums in video format.
---
Yeah, they had a [c'thun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34ba7rg0gdc) and [twin emps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVuPmDuGXpI). I can't remember if they had any others.
---
Grinding at Tyr‘s Hand. What a fucking pain in the ass. Also it took a long time and I was doing a lot of dungeons where you could at least earn a little gold too.
---
Most of these had no impact whatsoever or just expanded on the gameplay that already existed.
---
Ica Lance and Water Elemental were nice tools which expanded frost mage gameplay, but you still used all your classic spells. All you got was a targetable range nova for burst setup and ice lance for cool shatter comboes.
---
slow, shadowfury, and unstable affliction were absolut non factors. Arcane and affliction werent played and destro was a pure pve specc that spammed shadowbolt.
---
The only class which was really broken because of the new instant spell was druid with lifebloom. That was indeed completely broken in PvP.
---
Shadow word Death on the other hand was a perfect addition, a high skill high reward nuke which let you prevent blind or sheep when used in the perfect moment. It made shadow priest and disci more interesting at the very highest skill.
---
Most of these didnt change the gameplay of the class in any way, besides druid.
---
You could have some neutral quests from Booty Bay. Maybe the pirates are stealing weaponry or some sort of prototype canon to terrorise the coast more effectively. Obviously the goblins are invested in preventing that.
---
During the early stage of Vanilla, my old computer could barely run the game in low settings. During MC raids, it was absolutely horrible, I looked at the floor zoomed in, and watched out for the health bars (I was a rdruid). I had like 5-10 fps.
---
My parents got me a new computer a few months after that, and it became a completely different game experience :)
---
3 gold, 22 silver.

I'm not disputing it being bis.

When it procs is devastating.

It is absolutely 100% layered. In the 2nd stress test there were 2-3 layers in Stormwind at the end when Omar showed up. I got invited to the 'Omar layer' since he wasnt in mine.
---
What you may be right about is entering cities having some kind of phasing or layering effect.
---
This right here. I had no idea what I was doing
---
Dysphoria was solo'n dungeons in [this gear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmT3oyRUB_o&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=601) in the hunter vs world vids i guess

Warrior needs a pocket healer to excel in PvP
---
Oh god, I thought I covered this when I slashed the count by more than 70% and stated we weren’t a good analog for the initial set.
---
This wasn’t an attempt at an accurate calculation, just a “fun” mental game. Did you get upset about Leroy Jenkins “33.33% (repeating of course)” chance of survival?

---
&gt;Blizzard says this is to allow for more freedom to pick a server.
---
That is of course a complete hogwash, its always about saving money.
---
I suppose so. At the same time, most classes lack any real, impactful variance in the way they play. A lot of abilities were pruned throughout the later expansions and the way stats/gear works was simplified. Together this makes the game a lot easier to balance. 
---
If they did something like remove the debuff cap on bosses, who knows what would happen to the meta of raiding in classic. Infinite debuffs would do more than make affliction locks viable.
---
Walk the dog, do some chores, fly for a quest turn in, or craft.  So many things you can do with wow downtime.
---
you literally ended your post with 'it's plausible that 50 of us don't make it". no, it's likely that all of us make it and nobody dies
---
Haha yep I was poor as hell most of the time, I didn't get my epic mount until I had been 60 for a long while, too.
---
Looks like they spent everything on runecloth bags.  :p
---
Something like that should be, I am for no changes but for CB folks it should be
---
Honestly having new servers with the ability to copy one character over would be perfect. Keep going if you want, or just try it out and you can still go back to classic.
---
My point was stealth is useless and opening without distract is terrible. Warriors can get the dun morogh mace which is pretty sick early on to.
---
Honestly you should have made the post and title in French with translation in a response to make a point that we need those language specific servers.
---
Plausible != Certain
---
You think layering exists to prevent queues by allowing far more than the 3000 limit per server, not just reduce congestion in starting zones. If the layering is collapsed to one after a few weeks you either believe that the number of players online will magically stabilize to the 3000 limit or lower per server, or if it doesn't you believe Blizzard will allow mega servers with around 10,000 players online per server. There is no other option.
---
I believe those are Mooncloth, and the undead guy in the screenshot is my friend Taken who made them for me! I was a fortunate sort in that regard.
---
The question is why I 🤔
---
The deaths aren’t evenly distributed, or even close to it. For example, there will far more deaths per capita in Detroit than in South Burlington, Vermont. It also varies by income level, race, age, etc. In particular, that number is driven up by old people dying of natural causes.
---
You have to account for the fact that WoW players aren’t representative of the U.S. on the whole. Just like WoW players tend not to be 80+ years old, they’re also more likely to be mid- to upper-class, which also means they are probably be living in safer cities. I can’t check numbers now, but it’s safe to say the death rate for people in this sub is lower than the overall rate for the country.
---
Nah, the mooncloth bags art are blueish white if I remember correctly. :o

Haha aight, no probs. Do you remember why you had so low money/gold btw?

Cheers man happy u liked it
---
Well, pallies' are more durable and have some unique utility. They're more reliable as pure healers, while priests get a more dispel centered role (either offensive or defensive depending on faction) and more offensive utility while offhealing.
---
Priests are quite fragile if focused while pallies can stall for quite a while while still pulling heals (good old bubble). They even get some in-built protection from CC (BoSac, typically R1) and stronger buffs and oh shit buttons (BoP, BoF, LoH are the big ones).
---
Priests' utility focuses mainly on dispelling (but, depending on faction, shammies have better offensive one, while pallies get a strong defensive one), mana burn (viper sting fills the bill well enough) and shielding.  The only unique move is PI if we neglect racial or shadow only spells.
---
I made a post down below of my thoughts.  Suffice to say I don't think I'm the only person who thinks like I do and anybody who claims to be in a majority should think twice.

Same here, first time I am taking some time off for a game release. Two other colleagues are doing that as well and we are already planning our journey together.

Aye! I was there... I remember when you could damage someone and they not auto target you and AV used to last for 2days or longer.
---
Being a great shaman is harder than being a great mage imo
---
Shamans literally have some of the best spells in the game.... but mages can control the fight and have more escape/reset potential

Its almost like layering is a terrible unneeded unthoughout system.
---
Some words have more than one meaning. It's a complicated concept, I know.
---
Yeah I've always liked that one the best for some reason.
---
Yea, that art is amazing. Almost makes me want to do the whole rep grind! :)
---
Omg this^^ I completely forgot this was a thing until you mentioned it. I recall repair bills being unreasonably expensive also, especially for plate wearers
---
I was working a lot at the time, just starting my career. 
---
Bought me some sweet sweet gold off a gold farmer I knew. I was friends with one that invited me to the 2012 Chinese Olympics (I never went). Seemed logical, work a few hours get shitloads of gold at heavily discounted prices.
---
Now that I am a bit older and wiser, actually grinding out the gold is going to be fun.
---
Still the best thing I ever bought for gaming/healing. Wouldn’t play without one.
---
I think the possibility of multiple months of layering is the main thing players are upset about at this point in time.
---
I personally would be pretty disappointed with layering exceeding one month at the absolute most.
---
&gt; You can have 2 on at the same time. With 2 you'll get on average one proc per fight.
---
I'd like to see your maths behind this.
---
because wearing 2 makes the chance of at least one proccing on any single hit 1.99% let's say 2% for the sake of simplyfying.
---
So it means 1 proc every 50 hits. 
---
So, on average you've got a ~63.3% chance to see it proc in the first 50 times you get hit.
---
84% to see it proc in the first 100 times you get hit
---
98% to see it proc in the first 200 times you get hit.
---
So to have it almost guaranteed you have to get hit 200 times. It's not "on average one proc per fight", and I'd say if it takes 200hits to approach 100% to see it proc you migh  very well be dead by that time.

Shame they're not using it as an opportunity to re-launch but with the new models. Not the world, I guess, as all the resources we have are from cataclysm onwards but yanno.
---
&gt;dest to get close to cap pre raid which ends up  having them substitute other more important stats.
---
And then get gibbed because they've discarded so many important stats they can't mitigate the occasional crit.

Goodbye life

I agree that the guy comes across as condescending, but asking how anyone could possibly have an issue with swearing is hilariously ignorant of the past 50 years of psycholinguistics research and comes across just as condescending. Lets share a cup of thistle tea and get back to talking about WoW.

I got it when the mount was the expensive one. It was a lot cheaper.

Metro Exodus, still haven't finished it.

99,9% that you won’t succeed.

First you need to be in a top guild that has the required bosses on farm status. Secondly only 1 or max 2 players are getting asigned to do the chain. Why should it be you? And lastly you need to have no life.. good luck giving everything up. Social life, Work, sport, girlfriend..

I'm not trying to shit on you, you asked where you went wrong and I'm telling you. but plausible means reasonable given the measured values

Ehhhhh, are you *sure about that*.
---
I know people making endless flame posts isn't exactly fun to read, but I don't think they're ineffective either. 
---
I'd never put it past blizzard, or really any game company to simply ignore what players want if they think they can get away with it and that the backlash will be manageable. Often times the only recourse customers have is to make it as clear as possible that that isn't the case.
---
Day man oooaaah, champion of the sun. mater of karate and friendship.
---
As for suggestions: If I was a part of this, I'd make a list of items and item value. That way I (as a contributer) could pick the items appropriate for me to grind and donate. Grinding items is very much different for each class. Fx. ranged can grind one item better than melee, and melee grind other things better than ranged.  
---
From my own experience. I always go mining/herbalism while leveling, and I hoard everything I find while leveling on bank alts. Ore, herbs, and drops. By the time I'm 60 I usually have enough crap stashed away to level 1,5 professions.

My advice is in part much like what someone else already stated in the comments. Go for valuable items, instead of crap like Light Feathers and Peacebloom. Basically, drop the lvl 1-45 zones.
---
With Classic, you'll have a gazillion tourists grinding low level zones, so the market will be saturated to the point where everthing will be almost free.  
---
If you chose to continue with your plan unchanged, I would like to place a bet that says you'll end up vendoring crap, cause your guild bank account with 10 chars each with 7x14slot bank alts will be full, and you'll end up using the mailbox system as extra storage.  
---
Additionally, set a cap for every donatable item. Would suck if you end up filling all your bank alts with Linen cloth. Having a max donation pr member cap before launch, avoids any drama later on.
---
I don't doubt blizzard will fix most of the bugs. Leeway is not considered to be a bug by blizzard. Watch any of the several videos on this sub. They won't fix it. So yes, expect to lose to melee.
---
Good to know. Thanks.
---
Yes, I do remember. It's because I would spend a ton on grinding up my tradeskills and doing the same on many alts. I had a ton of alts.
---
How? The limit dictates the classes already, and DPS of the excluded classes is roughly equivalent to the included ones or worse.
---
You clearly have no idea what youre talking about. And probably never watched zyzz or known anything about how big his following was way before the youtube and instagram sensations we have now. And I guarantee you: I outlift you on every lift. Dont try to be a tough guy
---
This is the worst reasoning I can think of. This assumes there won't be people who will try their hardest to circumvent the rules. When the workaround is found, it will be posted on reddit, YouTube and wherever.
---
This reasoning can also be used in software development, basically to argue against Open Source Software. Thing is, it's the exact opposite. If your rules are open to be tested, retested and people are allowed to try to circumvent them, then the developers need to be involved and constantly improving the product/fixing the exploits. 
---
I find it much better (for us) for blizzard to eventually create a blue post (the sooner the better) so that players help improving the system, instead of existing 0 information and when workarounds are found, Blizzard just gives radio silence and we are forced to deal with the problem ourselves.
---
Ah ok, yeah makes sense if you spent a lot on professions since they were virtually a gold sink if you didnt want to farm everything for skill ups. :)
---
&gt;I am for no changes but for CB folks it should be
---
Yeah, I'm firmly in the #nochanges camp, but a colorblind mode is a change any sane person should get behind.
---
Holy pally i loled
---
Prot back then excelled at single target threat, having no reliable aoe threat generation. What makes playing prot warrior hard is that you constantly need to switch between targets and properly manage all their aggro. I personally found this to be a lot of fun and seemed to earn my a lot of respect when done well. 
---
For leveling just go fury until 40, then MS. Low level dungeons don't require you to be prot specced, just bring your sword and board and perhaps some other tank gear you might have found while leveling, equip those and you'll be dandy.
---
Leveling prot spec will slow you down considerably, even when being out in the world doing quests or grinding with friends.
---
English is far worse for it - their, there etc
---
To be faaaaaaaaaaaaair, https://youtu.be/E55t0lnp_8M

needs a 15 agi
---
Turn Ravenholdt into a dungeon. Or maybe a caverns of time dungeon based on trolls vs human conflict in arathi.
---
I mean sure, every single taunt in the fight **could** go off without a hitch and you complete it without needing the Dreadnaught 4-set bonus, but history isn't on your side with that one.
---
Depends if you're going horde or alliance, currently there's an huge estimated number of people going warlocks on horde.
---
Btw, warrior is the most stacked class in raids so its not exactly hard to find a guild to raid with as a warrior, so long as you don't mind being an off tank when needed.
---
There's also the thing about fury warriors being the number 1 dps in classic ( for real ).
---
Brother I have been competing in bodybuilding for over 6 years. Let's not even get into the "I lift heavier than you" bullshit because I could easily send you videos that will put you to shame.
---
Don't speak on what you don't know and clearly being a big zyzz fan boy you don't know much about REAL bodybuilding and not some twat wanna be
---
700g for the worst trinket of vanilla hahaha
---
That is great and I hope they fix the range issues and langueage specific servers in Europe (even if it's only English, German and French it's better to know what language is expected to be spoken), too. So far I am really happy about the path they go
---
What's wrong with their mentality? Listening to the players is a bad thing?
---
Far harder to get as well Bloodsail Overlord
---
Fish Master Race from the fishing extrav trinket
---
Mc should be able to be cleared easily in mostly greens.
---
Is there a way to tell how much of a server population is alliance or horde? I'm thinking of going druid or shaman but want to mainly PvP, and once bg's are out obviously a lower queue time will be good if there's a lower number of people in my faction but that will also determine whether I play shaman or not
---
Looking forward to the next! :)
---
Some guy in trade chat wanted [Hammer of the Titans](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12796/hammer-of-the-titans). said he would pay 900g if it had Crusader on it. Spent the next week farming and crafted the weapon.
---
Yeah, but no
---
That would be the best outcome.
---
I like the murloc. It's clearly still alive and just keeps biting.
---
Sulfuras sucks though
---
oh shit this is real
---
The stupidity of the name is not a complicated concept. “Twink” was slang for years and years before WoW was even released. Why name it the same thing as an ALREADY ESTABLISHED word for a GayBoi? 
---
Riddle me That.
---
12 years here lil man
---
Soo little update since my last post here
---
Still cannot decide between Warrior and Rogue
---
1. will def be undead
---
2. I really like tanking, yet I will prolly not get a MT spot since guild leaders already took them (could get one if the guild gets so big we can do 2 raid groups but dunno)
---
3. So it would be either Fury (would love to do 2H fury) or rogue (daggers then) as a DPS
---
4. I will definitly Stream everythink: leveling, PvP, Raids, Dungeons
---
5. Downsides: Warrior-&gt;high rep cost, slow level speed, kiteable in pvp 1v1, harder to farm gold / Rogue: squishy, cannot tank and has harder time to get a group
---
6. Upsides: Warrior-&gt;2Handed Weapons and heavy armor, Beast in PvP with a pocket healer or groups, can tank and has easy time to get a group (almost insta invite) / Rogue-&gt;good in 1v1 PvP, can easy farm, has fun mechanics (poison, stealth, lockpick) 
---
So there I stand. I played both classes since TBC so I know how to do stuff efficient. Any additional points that I could consider? Thank you all for the help :)
---
Absolutely this.
---
I think classic would benefit a lot from a client side choice.
---
I do notice that there is significant air between my understanding of warrior leveling and his, but I really like to try to make my criticisms specific and somewhat constructive. It's not a standard I always meet by any stretch, but I never really feel like it cost me a lot to do so.
---
Lil man?
---
Thanks for the debate, have a good day playing fortnite.
---
Stop thinking of adding new items to this. You've already got a borderline impossible list. I wish you luck.
---
Make time to go outside and see your loved ones, that’s a whopper of a list.
---
2012 isn't vanilla though.
---
Assault each opposing faction capitals maybe
---
I never noticed before.
---
It's weird, it looks like it's in Burning Steppes or something, either way it doesn't look like a place I'd ever expect Frostmourne to be.
---
Also, that weapon was wielded by a Paladin -&gt; Deathknight, why is it in the Warrior background.
---
Obviously it's just early in the game and it's just because the pic was a good fit. It's a nice picture but it looks off.
---
Uh...
---
Try to get the snow leopard mount in winterspring
---
Just did dungeons for drops and farmed herbs/tyrs hand.
---
U just get reel from zg. No problems. And not a fuckload of wasted end game gear for 1 fight.
---
I'm torn here. I agree with both of you to a great extent, but I really hope they wouldn't keep classic specs for all of this. I can't imagine staying on 1.12 specs forever, yikes.
---
Moving to TBC would be great to have actual good specs/all roles being viable, but most everything else about Classic I'd like to keep for any potential future content, such as no flying mounts. Tough one.
---
Well it Counts in with that max out Reputation stuff
---
Except its not this at all.
---
Some people are asking for the ability to let the players choose if they want new models or not. This would have absolutely no effect on anything or anyone outside of the individual player. 
---
What they are not asking for, is forcing it on for everyone, like nearly everyone in this thread thinks.
---
Sometimes I do wonder if the majority of reddit posters can actually read.
---
I've had over 6 hunters max level shared over retail and pservers. I'm actually considering to roll druid just because I hear it's so fucked atm
---
Well again, not something to do as fast as possible. Assuming classic will be out for at least 2 years until something new Comes (Tbc/more classic Content) its quite some time.
---
Add TBC without flying mounts and redefine the stuff which you needed a flying mount for.
---
Incoming saltiness for not being able to play the first half of the week due to instabilities :P.
---
I'll be traveling for work for the first 6 days, but at least I'll miss the mad rush in the early zones!
---
No one's going to do a 6 month mount grind on dead servers lol
---
bullshit
---
Lol gay
---
Someone posted a pic of a handbook and it said DM
---
Spell batching should be in the game. The problem is that the “window” is simply too long now.
---
Roger roger
---
Not interested in fortnite. And it was never a debate with your opening statement. Good luck being a hero
---
It will definitely go terribly, but I suspect it will get remedied quickly. Sadly, I am traveling for about 30-40 days starting just a few days after launch, shit timing.
---
Gonna give you the no-BS story as a lock.
---
Currently there's a huge amount of people going undead lock in classic , this not only means I wouldn't advise rolling horde but it'll also inconvenience you on alliance since undeads are annoying to fight against as an alliance lock and that's the reason why there's less locks on alliance usually.
---
Locks in general are great levelers but they're not top tier dps at 60 ( not until AQ 40/naxx) , there are a lot of annoyances with locks in 1.12 that people have forgotten about, massive bag issues due to carrying shards, being forced to farm shards regularly can veer people away from the class.
---
1v1 pvp is fine for locks but in large group pvp locks get shredded fast due to low mobility and being rather squishy as any spec other than SL, in bgs your playstyle leans more towards CC and controlling the tempo before nuking (placing tongues on healers etc), on alliance you can get away with being a braindead nuker without doing the whole control thing but if that is your preferred playstyle you might as well roll mage.
---
Edited original, thanks. The anti-American zinger in the other comment got me agitated so I became defensive. Sorry for tone of my responses.
---
Have a good night.
---
yep, this is why the trick with new server launches is to start your time off a few days after launch (assuming there is a limit to how many days you can take, if not then disregard).
---
Titan panel has so much useless information. Does anyone know of a simple xp/hour addon? Literally the only useful thing there
---
I remember having an addon that showed probability that something would drop and counted attempts.
---
I was farming for the archaology items in Cata: Extinct Turtle Shell, Staff of Sorcerer Than Thaurissan, Tyrande's Favorite Doll. Gosh that took so long.
---
you know that the community you are talking about it nothing compared to the community back then, right? The pillar for success is nostalgia
---
You can create characters weeks before...
---
DPS warriors won't be after the plate, they'll be after the weapons and leather pieces.
---
1 pve 1 pvp, No need for merges and if its a dead realm its a dead realm no biggie. Let people play the game in a single world.
---
I never said it wasn't a stupid name, only that bringing its name up as an insult is lame and tired.
---
But if I had to guess the name probably does come from the gay slang since a twink is a lower level character that gets geared by a higher level, richer character that's acting as a sugar daddy.
---
I'm calling it Cookie from now on.
---
Undeads have a really strong cooldown ability every 3 minutes which is an almost guaranteed win for short duels and occasional ow-pvp 1v1's but ONLY against classes which cant dispell diseases (which everyone can do with a Purification Potion btw), otherwise its a 3 min cd and \~20% of your mana wasted for nothing.
---
Will of the Forsaken is arguably one of the best pvp racials, but alliance play much less warlocks than horde exactly because of it, its only relevant against 3 classes on alliance side. And out of those, warrior is a priests  easiest matchup anyway irrelevant of race choice (but even then, warriors would also be easier as a troll because of shadowguard being so effective against warriors and rogues).
---
So for duels/1v1 and just some occasional ganking undead spriests are better, but in the endgame, for organized group pvp, bg's, ect. (especially once you stacked a lot of spellpower) trolls are just superior. In group pvp your devouring plague will pretty much always instantly be dispelled anyway, whereas trolls shadowguard is harder dispell, and almost not worth it for efficiency as it costs little and has no cd to reapply, and always has a chance for the blackout stun which somewhat protects them when getting focused by melees, also their second racial priest skill even comes with a 20% heal-debuff, whereas undeads second priest skill is pretty much useless.
---
I agree that having all classes balanced is a bad idea, it takes the uniqueness out of the class. Not sure how you've gotten the idea that I'm advocating for that tho. I literally said they'd serve different roles, different purposes, like mage v warlock. They're both caster DPS classes that accomplish different things, and just because mage deals more dmg doesn't mean warlocks are suddenly dead in PvE. 
---
As it stands now, if you want to tank the only thing you will ever play is warrior and nothing else. If you want to heal you've got 3 options per faction, and if you want to DPS the options open up further. Having just one tank that's always BIS and nothing even compares is bad game design, period. I'm somehow sensing you're a warrior player and have ulterior motives if you claim otherwise.
---
Defending the 1.12 meta as "this is how it's been for a decade, get used to it" is like telling people in high crime rate areas to just get used to it because that's how it's been XD also you returned to the "this is how it works in private servers" argument...this isn't a private server, it's blizzard. People are a lot more likely to tolerate bugs, crashes, downtime and janky design in a private server. Imagine the private server goes down for 1 full day because the owner was late on payment or something. Odds are you'd understand. If official WoW goes down for a full day, you better get ready for the shit show.
---
Also, not all players that come to classic are old players. There will be many players that come in without having played back in vanilla, or on private servers or players that never played WoW to begin with. Whereas I'd wager at least 90% of the private server population started out as die hard WoW fans. So that answers your question of why balance is talked about. To many people this balance is new. Blizzard will also need to cater to those people if they want to turn those casuals into new die hard fans.
---
How will the gear look like? Well that's kinda what this discussion is about in the first place. We're not game designers, we're all just passionate fans. But let's get down to earth here for a second, the chance of blizzard actually going through with updating 1.13 and beyond are astronomically low. IF updates come, they'll probably come in the form of re-releasing the xpacs. Because learning from mistakes is hard apparently.
---
What is the best class for playing solo?
---
Fair point
---
I don't agree with you ofcourse but it does not matter.
---
Ya just have fun. Back in the day we all kinda sucked, so having pots and flasks an other consumables was pretty important. Now a days I dont think that will be such a big deal. I plan on doing pretty much the same as you stated. Maybe not in a week, perhaps 2. Then just try to raid 2 nights a week and enjoy the rest of the game. As far as making gold made most of my mount money selling bags. Portals aren't something you sit in a capital city selling. It's more of a "LF Port to UC will tip"......and when you are in town do it. But I definitely wouldn't bank on making any kind of significant gold doing that. If you really wanna level fast, team up with another mage or lock and go ham on aoe grinding.
---
If you have no debuff limits then there will be so much corruptions, curses, moonfires etc etc on the boss this is much more raiddps as with 16 debuff slots
---
Startattack macros are essential if you want to do max dps as a melee. Some people will claim they dont need them but it does make a difference
---
Are you a GM or raid leader? Then, no.
---
Another option besides those listed here is to make a macro with shift, control, and alt. You can bind the macro and have 4 spells in one spot. More if you use harm and help modifiers. Fairly common for retail healers if you want to look up an example.
---
There's no such thing as an affliction warlock or a protection warrior etc
---
You're a warlock, you adapt your template to what you want to do, like every classes in Classic.
---
This is retail mentality. You're not going to have one template for the duration of classic, but (at least) one for leveling, one for PVP, one for dungeons, one for raiding etc
---
Another thing, you should at least try to get 10% hit chance on your mage....as long as you hit that cap...assuming you put points into the hit chance talent you'll be good to go. That's pretty important to try and get to and maintain once you start raiding.
---
&gt;he best would be 2 monitors and Joanas/whoevers webguide
---
This is what im doing :)
---
Bro..... only you like that name
---
Lol
---
Thats a weird way of saying : I was wrong i learn from my mistakes
---
But hey i hurt your pride better double down on being stupid
---
I am working on my own leveling addon for classic. I posted an early preview here [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c1p5so/i\_am\_writing\_an\_addon\_for\_leveling\_guides/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c1p5so/i_am_writing_an_addon_for_leveling_guides/)
---
It is in a pretty good shape already and I will soon release a beta version.
---
Since I am still looking for guide creators willing to cooperate I will focus on including an editor so it will be easy to add your own guides. My plan is to make it so that everybody could use my addon to bring any guide found anywhere in the internet easily into the addon so you can have it in-game.
---
Using an in-game addon and reading a guide in a browser is really not the same thing (even with two monitors) since the in-game addon will be able to automatically keep track of your progress and thus make it so much easier.
---
If you happen to have your own guides that you would like to see included in an addon feel free to contact me!
---
I wanted it to be good but layering kills the game for me. Might check it out if they ever remove layering.
---
Chubbychaser was good
---
Demise was popular 
---
Fate 
---
I personally am gonna try to get Freshprince and Classicman
---
A debate regarding different opinions is a debate regardless.
---
I prefer to be the anti hero crushing the bullshit and preaching facts
---
Troll has a better average damage due to their shield but DP does a lot of damage on a 3min cd.
---
In a PvP scenario, DP gives you a little burst window that the troll's racial can't compete with.
---
Maybe we should crowdfund to get some television and Internet ads out there 🤔
---
Not sure I would say it is likely nobody dies ... there is likely to be at least 1 person who isn't lucky out of over 100,000 (keep in mind some of us who visit here often aren't even subscribed, so probably more like 200k+).  Out of even 100,000 people the likelihood that someone isn't going to make it 2 months is pretty good although 50 is unlikely.  As stated somewhere above it does seem like our demographic would benefit from younger age and are less likely to commit suicide (got WoW to look forward to for now at least).  Many of us drive or use some form of transportation though, most are probably of age to drink, and you can always get hit by lightning or bitten by a shark.
---
Ill take health of the game and servers over slight frustration for the first 3 days personally.
---
I have an old CRT monitor ready for the ultimate 2005 experience.
---
Sounds like fun, obwohl meine Deutsch ist schlecht :(
---
Midnight for me (UK) so I get to tuck the kids in, kiss the lady goodnight and leave her to dream of the future while I get mad and smash my screen in frustration of the login servers failing, or whatever issue impacts us and ruins it all.
---
Even if there are launch issues I don't see it being a problem for more than a few hours. I'm willing to bet at least 20% of the people logging in on launch are just trying classic and wont like it or will log off because of mob tagging competition.
---
This is great news.
---
assuming its not delayed ;)
---
You don't have to go to EA for that. Don't you know Heroes of the Storm? A game that started in a "technical alpha" with a fully functioning cash shop.
---
With all the music replaced by death metal.
---
I kind of agree with Blizzard this time around, we don't know how popular Classic will be in the long term and it's more valuable to have healthy server populations than language specific servers.
---
Maybe there's a possibility for an in-between solution in that they can give some of the servers german/french/etc names but still keep them under the english tab in the server list.
---
optional i would say yes, for example allowing wowhead to extract the info would be nice but it shouldnt something you can check in-gameto see while on wowhead but otherwise no.
---
Potion of invisibility. \*thumbs up\*
---
Surely warlock or hunter because they have pets. If you don't plan on raiding at all I'd suggest hunter. The main reason for this is that hunters scale fairly well compared to other classes at the lower tiers of equipment. Hunters also have access to the best and most efficient gold farming methods (soloing Maraudon princess runs / DMN tribute runs when available). Hunters also can grind elite chimaeroks which drop Chimaerok Tenderloins (+25 stamina food reagent). This food sells very well, and can also be farmed by a warlock. 
---
\&amp;nbsp;
---
That being said, if you at all plan on casually raiding i'd suggest warlock because they scale much much better as your gear progresses. Hunters really fall off once AQ releases. Warlocks are also better in PvP than hunters imo.
---
25s to read both comments, nice.
---
Use an swing timer and run then jump and turn around when they are about to swing. They will hit you but won't daze you. Then you should be out of harms way I think.
---
He described basic auction house gameplay...
---
The problem with only fighting mobs lower level than you is that you're fairly quickly gonna be forced to grinding instead of questing, which in most cases is a major impact on XP gained. If you can consistently find areas where you can grind low level mobs without being constantly disturbed by other people it might be worth it, but in any scenario where people are fighting over spawns killing a mob for a quest is usually worth about twice as much XP.
---
I stopped playing just after Wrath of the Litch King came out (Life stuff).. So maybe 11 years ago?! Things are extremely different to how it was back then but I am SO excited to ignore my girlfriend for hours on end as I jump back in. She'll understand I'm sure.
---
10 sec
---
Is there an app for the countdown ?
---
There are legitimate reasons for the complaints... Layering being prohibited for people who gained XP recently is going to cause tons of issues.
---
Hunter, lock, mage
---
LVL 40 is where I really started getting into PvP in Vanilla.  I lost a week of leveling progress with pvp at crossroads and Southshore.  It was ok a PvE server and before BGs existed.  There was world PvP every where.
---
- Get all keys
---
- Get one of each faction mounts
---
- Collect all dragon pets
---
- Kill each enemy faction leader
---
i was about to take off 4 1/2 weeks, all sorted out. 
---
monday my boss firend me because of economic reasons, so i wont be able to attend the launch how i planned for like 2 years
---
&gt;"brb, making rogue now"
---
That is a very loose definition of "brb", not sure it means I will be back in 6 months.
---
Leeway is vanilla flavor and very authenthic mechanic, just like spell batched mages polymorphing each other. Not implementing leeway would be a change tarnishing original PvP meta. 
---
Or perhaps people just don't have their own opinion and are blindly following what content makers say? And when at last somebody knowledgeable said that these mechanics suck ass people finally understood it, but it is already too late after all this old mechanic shilling in the spell batching discussion since blizzard went #nochanges in this matter.
---
Tauren female has a slightly smaller hitbox for all i know but it's still larger than other races, I've leveled a tauren male and female before and didn't notice any difference tbh.
---
Once you've worked up enough experience you can start charging, but it's a bitch to get to that point.  All in all I think you're doing it correctly, so just keep at it.
---
Maybe Classic WoW doesn't need to a be game that you play for the rest of your life but are able to revisit over the years. People played Diablo 2 and Warcraft 3 for years and they didn't have any new content after a year.
---
Hell, even during retail-WotLK the paladin SoL-judgement style of healing went under the radar for months. For the entirety of Naxxramas, we were topping the healer meters with more aoe-healing than druids while only actively healing the tanks with Glyph of Holy Light favoring crit over haste. It was simply a shower of green numbers all the time which just turned the healing-over-time spells of your colleagues into overhealing-over-time. It was viable to have you solo-healing most of 10 man Naxx if there was a spriest/oomkin to keep your mana topped up with current-tier gear.  
---
Meanwhile the meta was FoL-glyph and haste with SoW-judgements to keep the bars blue.
---
Yeah, Becasue we wanted no sharding then they offered us a worse deal in layering so now we want sharding back.
---
It feels like layering is a punishment for not accepting sharding.
---
I used my friends account to transfer cheap Deviate Surpreme Recipes from the horde side through the neutral auction house to the alliance side. They sold for much more over at the other side.
---
hs is only for sheman and druid tho
---
In Vanilla i played NE Rogue, Dwarf Priest and Gnome Warlock to 60. Ended up playing a Disc Heal Priest in PvP most of the time. Made him a Gladiator later in arena as well. Had a lot of fun with this character. You can also Heal in 5 man dungeons with your PvP Spec. You can go for a PvE spec and easily find raids. You can also be a really good damage dealer as shadow... Man, i just loved my dwarf. So, id recommend a Priest :)
---
Weapon skill only matters when you fight mobs at least 3 levels above you. So, it mostly matters in raids. Against even level mobs, weapon skill has a fairly small impact.
---
idk man, everyone was using scarab brooch when I used to play wotlk servers
---
Then you would still be able to dodge ganks.
---
Even though shaman has some nice burst damage, it's kit was made for group utility.
---
So if you play solo most of the time you won't be using that kit fully.
---
Yes! I was thinking the same, where you'd leave your pc on overnight to download the updates :p
---
i wouldnt mind the old forum layout in general. modern forums are disgusting.
---
What's all this, then?
---
I made all of these into a single wallpaper. :)
---
https://i.imgur.com/z5q9hXv.png

Literally anything cause you're the best support class in the game.
---
Thanks for clearing that up!
---
So the pvp mounts only cost 100g instead of 1000g.
---
One little correction though: there is no epic riding skill. there is only one, race specific riding skill for 20g. Here is a good overview, which misses the pvp mounts though :c
---

This was a server by server difference. Some used dm for Deadmines, others used VC. My server, for example, adopted vc. I was as confused as anyone else when people were looking for more for Deadmines but using VC, honestly thought it was a server wide joke where people were looking for more for the Viet Cong. Then I asked someone in guild chat who had been playing longer than I had and he explained that when Dire Maul came out people used DM to advertise for it in lfg chat while simultaneously groups were also recruiting for Deadmines using DM. Very quickly VC was adopted to have a clear distinction between the two so nobody joined the wrong groups.
---
Have they reverted the delete quest items on abandoning? That was the most anti fun change they did to the game. Permanently losing 1 quest spot was lame, 2 when you factor in the Tanaris whirlymechanomagic hat as well. Gotta keep that funky hat, they should have been a reward from the quests!
---
I haven't seen any of those "fly 8 circles" FPs yet, but I do remember them. Didn't they shorten FPs a lot in one of the Vanilla patches? Which means we'd be getting the shortened versions.

Amon Amarth, of course
---
A lot of people want TBC, I see no issue with giving them it and splitting the player base, we have more then enough players to fill vanilla wow, vanilla wow+ and TBC I think.
---
i see myself sitting in a spanish server because i dont want to research forums for people uniting. its so funny to me that so many are going insane about the circumstances.
---
"i cant handle if i get onto an unoffical *insert country* server" is what everyon cries, but in de same steps all enable just this by creating what they are scared for. 
---
the more i read about this, the more they seem like literal hypocrits
---
Where to do you find girlfriends who support your childish gaming addiction? I want one of those girlfriends. Mine is just judging me constantly and rolling her eyes when I warned her that September is going to be my special gaming month.
---
That window is the same as what it was in vanilla on purpose.
---
That's exactly why it's an issue. Back then it made sense because hardware couldn't do any better, now it's just intentionally making the game less responsive.
---
There will always be a spot for a shadow priest in raids, you can always find a guild that needs one if you truly wish to play shadow full time, plus the fact that you're dwarf will make it much easier too.
---
Locks are locks I guess, honestly there's gonna be more locks than priests on either side so pick whatever you prefer, locks aren't going to top meters either , even in naxx locks will still get out dps'd by mages and warriors.
---
13th of August character name reservations open up.
---
**GIVE ME BETA!** .......like this?
---
You can try this, but all offtanks are Fury Warriors that just switch the gear.
---
They just do maximum dps if needed and tank also. :)
---
Yes this 100%. You're better off taking the L and durability loss / 10 min cooldown a lot of the time.
---
My god, it’ll be beautiful.
---
Getting to 60 &amp; enjoying the experience is my goal. After that we’ll see what happens.
---
two months and I can actually enjoy WoW again. Can't wait for classic to take off and make blizzard realize that retail has to change.
---
Haha gay
---
I think the general sentiment is that it *can* be done in less than 6 days, but I've not seen that many actually arguing that it's the average.
---
This pretty much.
---
I could add that pallies are slightly more support based while druids are more of a swiss knife ( can do everything at once ).
---
For pvp holy pally is the best healer in game hands down though, while druids have heals they aren't near holy paladin levels. So if you lean more towards a healer playstyle go pally and if you lean more towards a survivalist then druid is for you.
---
Yea, I mainly meant disc. I don't consider myself to be bad, but there was so much going on as disc, that it wasnt really a fun and relaxing experience to heal dungeons like that. That's great information, and I think I'll actually enjoy healing as a priest in classic in that case. Have you got some experience as shadow in classic? Are they viable damage dealers solo &amp; in dungeons? Cheers!
---
I don't know about you but I'm naming an undead rogue "StabzYa" just in case.
---
Honestly, I think Blizzard vastly underestimates the amount of players who want to play Classic and will not have enough servers for all players at release.
---
That's what their EU language decision makes me think.
---
Get that tips out baby video outa here! 
---
2 minute explanation required he bumps it to 22 min somehow.
---
Thanks for you reply, really wanna try them out now!
---
Didn't get one personally (my gold-management skills were simply too shit for that), but I know the first of my friends got there by farming dead wind pass on his mage. It's a circular route which drops a quite a lot of greys and   
---
starts/ends quite close to a vendor. His only relevant profession was tailoring so that didn't add much income either.  
---
The second one to get one was even weirder, he was a gnome but really wanted a nightsaber so he started doing all the nelf-quests while already 60, he had gold to spare by the time he reached exalted simply because apparently doing that many quests while max-level provides a lot of gold due to the xp-conversion.
---
Maybe they do it to get these reactions out of it. It's just text after all, ignore trolls and your life is much better
---
Sounds like you've already made up your mind ( Unlike the topic of this thread).
---
After I discussed my launch party 3 day play until I pass out plan with my partner, I predict separation and bitterness.
---
Double twist
---
Generally I agree with you.
---
Everybody should be able to understand or communicate in english. 
---
Unfortunately there are many Europeans who are bad at English. Eventhough they should have learned it at school. Maybe they did, but lots never followed up and forgot a lot of it or never properly learned it in the first place. 
---
Also the argument with the unofficial servers is a strong one in my opinion. I for example don't really want to play on a server where the majority of players speak French. Because I don't understand a single sentence and I've met many french players (unlike OP) who refuse to speak english or are so bad at it, that you can't understand a single comment. Same can happen on Spanish or German Servers obviously. 
---
Furthermore I don't want to spend money on a server transfer or start over just because I happen to be on the 'wrong' unofficial server.
---
I'd much rather have them divide the server list like they did for retail. So that european players can choose to join a (mainly) german, english, french, spanish, russian speaking server.
---
Be seeing you!
---
or you let the druid tank, the actually better 1-60 leveling tank, and instead pick dps or heal (depending on the other shaman). you can even go for shaman and have two in the group because why not.
---
Dwarf is superior in PvP, where +weapon skills do nothing and Perception is very meh.
---
Go priest first, you'll thank me someday.
---
And this time in 3 months you'll be jobless and facing a divorce.
---
Yes you can really tell that he did just spend a few hundred... as they are all done by either entry level artist or people that did not want to spend more than ~30 min on the painting due to how poorly it pays 
---
And I am almost certain that the ironforge painting is blocked out in 3d and then photobashed and it probably took him 10ish+ hours to complete... you are just looking at a painting from a professional so you dont really notice ;)
---
This is a quite disturbing decision by Blizzard. The classic team did everything right up to this point – no changes all the way through, even "simulating" spell bachting and all that jazz ... but for me as german player this is just baffling and frankly unacceptable. 
---
The german (and all other european languages I suppose) WoW community back in Vanilla has always had its own meta, its own customs etc. 
---
On a sidenote, one of the reasons might just be the availability of GMs for these specific languages and Classic itself – Blizzard just doesn't want to hire more GMs. 
---
So this decision might have actually come from the higher ups and is in fact a business one. I can't imagine the Classic Devs being okay with not having language specififc servers when everything else should be as close to 2004 as possible.
---
It was bugged at some point and disconnected people attacking the wearer, a must have in pvp
---
This is nonsense unless you are only grinding one specific level of one specific mob forever. There's no reason to care about breakpoints when all mobs have different amounts of hp.
---
I feel slightly annoyed by the insinuation that I am some sort of end game focused leveling hater.
---
Matter of fact is, though, that eventually everyone will get to 60 and nobody plays lowlevel dungeons a lot. How often have you really run Uldaman? I mean really. Been thee maybe 10 times in classic as opposed to the hundreds of times Ive done Stratholme or other maxlevel dungeons.
---
The leveling experience is fine as is and adding dungeons for a short level range will never live up to the longevity of a max level dungeon.
---
I mean you have to understand that right now the plan is not to add any content to classic AT ALL. If they decide to do 2 years down the road when everyone who still plays has a maxlevel char and only some twink, do you really think making lowlevel content is the most efficient use of dev ressources compared to making dungeons that people will be able to run for all eternity?
---
I wish so much that I still had my original 60 ding. It was February 2005 after I bought the game at the midnight release of WoW.  It took me 3 months to level, playing pretty much whenever I didn't have work or school or a party obligation!
---
How did you guys manage to save yours for so long?  Do you still have your original computer?
---
I think you can, but you’ll need to sacrifice a lot to achieve it, like taking +3 defence enchant on bracers. I do agree that at that stage it doesn’t worth to aim for 440def.
---
did dungeons normally and vendored the greens i won. about 2-3 months after i was 60 i had enough for mount. that was in vanilla
---
Now on private servers, i only played 1 around 1.5 years ago. so i only have experience from 1 private server with 1 character (hunter), and the answer is DM Tribute runs. you can make 100 gold per hour doing so. I have no idea if this is the case in classic, as i played warrior during vanilla at the time and was still very young and crappy at the game.
---
Just remember if your under 40 and take rez sickness without finishing a quest you will have to run back eventually to finish it.. 
---
Situational at best but 80% of the time I just rez and /afk
---
If you know the game this is not a tough call alliance is CLEAR winner in vanilla and horde is the clear choice for TBC.
---
&gt; not be as elegant, as having it limited to &lt;20 lvl zones
---
Two players are in a lvl 20 zone. They leave it and venture into a lvl30 zone where they meet. They don't group because they are both grouped independently already but communicate in /s and both head back into the lvl 20 zone where their respective groupmates are still around. They both see the other player despawn.
---
The community outcry over ruined immersion is picked up by microphones on the ISS.
---
Half an hour after blizzard introduced starting-zone-layering-only. horde and alliance groups and raids position themselves at the borders of lvl 20 areas, waiting for low level characters to zone out of their layer and right into the midst of them so they can easily kill and gank them.
---
Curiosity on the surface of mars reports back with seismic data indicating marsquakes actually being a thing as the shock-wave of the community outcry hits our planetary neighbor.
---
I LOVE how undead warriors looks, always since vanilla it's been one of my favorite combos. Probably not the best option racial wise, but it's just so cool.
---
You'll be less kiteable in pvp once you have all that gear!
---
Charge &gt; 1 or 2shot
---
If you don't want to install an soon, probably this would be what you want https://wow.gamepedia.com/API_SetBindingSpell.
---
Gotta roll Warlock! I doubt I had the gold for even the slow mount by the time I was 60 but luckily I picked a Warlock!
---
Both are solid choices tbh, deep down if you prefer to dps you should probably go mage.
---
As for the wife, there's really only 1 pet class in the game and that's hunter, warlocks don't have pets they have slaves.
---
I personally loved achievements for the mere documentation of stuff I did.
---
A real achievement system won't be in the game but I hope somebody will do an addon emulating the original achievements!
---
There will probably a few heart attacks/strokes/diabetic comas first week as people neglect all else in the pursuit of sweet sweet warcrack.
---
Troll or worst post of 2019
---
I think he's probably just sick of dealing with trolls and witchhunting from twitch chat that he would reply in such a manner. It is after all a beta - and he's doing jumps, bringing attention to the jumps that we would hope Blizzard would fix prior to launch. I certainly wouldn't want to play against this, it would be frustrating. But I don't think trying to get him banned on the beta or launch is reasonable at all
---
To add to this are you including all server types? I had intended to roll an RP server at launch and would appreciate a majority English speaking realm?
---
I was actually thinking of picking up that talent, and the reduced spell damage taken but my understanding is that the blessed recovery heal will replace itself and you lose the healing of the previous instance if you get crit again before it was finished and was therefor undesirable against classes that either have guaranteed crits or a high crit strike chance.. is this still true? 
---
Also, bad vanilla tooltips vein vague, it just says melee or ranges crit, does anyone know if it heals on spell crit too? 
---
I kinda want to run it on my troll regen memespec but I want to make sure I know how it works
---
I'll throw my arcane intellect on any character I see with a manapool! I'll accept every party invite and see what's up, I'll help folk out when I can, and I'll have a damned good time!
---
I just did some 1-20 on a private server testing out tirisfal glades and silverpine since I haven't lvled there before, and I met and befriended more people there than I have in the last 4 expansions. Thst was 1 week of casual playing
---
Nah man, not in onyxia.
---
\+
---
That computer is long gone. If you mean the screenshots, I saved them to a CD-R. If you mean saving my 60 for so long after release, well, alts!
---
They were so afraid of the arrow they ran straight out of Azeroth and into Skyrim apparently!
---
yes, after the server economy is fucked ... thanks blizzard
---
Well, the only way is to either be extremely good or play on group limited servers where rules are enforced. I actually prefer the gameplay when there's max 3-4 people in a group.
---
Your 31 point talent is a worse lifetap.
---
This is a good filter to stop retards playing shit specs.
---
Ill tell you. These are so low effort bad posts that serious people will only type no and move on. There is no point for discussion in this sense.
---
Lol nice joke post. Well done.
---
"Based on the comments I hope Classic fails then...It's too broken. You'll have your classic server....and that's it. Everyone else will be left in the dust, and it will be a ghost town in under a year. On top of all that the community is toxic."
---
This is my favorite part. You're so funny!
---
Don't sell it too quickly if you get an early drop in the first few months. This piece will skyrocket in price when battlegrounds release and keep rising the more the economy builds.
---
I played that games so much I just started a no death run to spice things up.
---
As a lock main i'll tell you this, good hunters are scary.
---
Locks are obviously strong but I feel like everyone thinks they're op or something, from my experience in the first phases of the game hunter is by far the strongest choice ( if played properly), viper sting is such an underrated ability.
---
Faction wise though, alliance hunters are generally stronger because they don't have to deal with paladins and dwarves who can remove their viper stings.
---
While horde locks have the benefit of not having to deal with wotf and shamans, the numbers reflect that (at least for locks).
---
Feels like there aren't as many hunters on alliance as I thought there'd be but that's probably because people haven't realized how good they are early on.

You don't know how long the cooldown is so where exactly are the facts?
---
Imagine a rogue hitting you 50 times during a duel. you got a 50% chance it will proc at least once. (correct me if I'm wrong)
---
No dude don't you get it? If they didn't fix it before I thought of it I get to vent my rage
---
Achievements? More like achivereeEeeEee
---
My argument has been that we could/should look at the old numbers when WoW had most active players. The player base increased through TBC and WotLK. So that should mean Vanilla and the 2 first expansions are what they should aim at releasing this time, since they were hugely successful. And in my personal opinion, WotLK was the best time in WoW's history.
---
&gt;These are so low effort bad posts that serious people will only type no and move on.
---
I think you have it exactly backwards, kiddo.
---
Just saying "no" is a low effort bad posts that serious people should ignore.
---
And therefore, OP's point still stands.
---
./ragequit if they convert to tbc or add more content to classic tbh... 2 years isnt even CLOSE to enough to finish your little list ofc. Keep dreaming lol
---
Yup, it's kinda broken vs melee.
---
Honestly. I dont remember. What I can tell you though was I didn't make it via a profession. I had eng/tailoring. And I didn't make it via AH trading as that didn't even cross my mind back then. If I had to guess it would a a long hard slog. I did ofc sell the occasional valuable item that dropped on AH.
---
Yes I meant the screen shots. I lost mine over time I'm not even sure when. I guess I never had the foresight to do backups back then.  Good job by you! 
---
I made such a big deal about my 60 too which is kind of embarrassing in hindsight. I pretended I needed help to lure a bunch of guildies to an island in stranglethorn and killed a mob to ding.  Then we had a little party with booze and stuff. Lol
---
I always liked leveling a warrior. It wasnt the fastest but with a good 2H weapon you could do it. You just need get realize that a stuff is sometimes better when its slow and the dpc is fine even though it might have some intellect on it
---
/1 is likely layered anyway. Otherwise, chat would be hell with five-figure server populations all in global channels.
---
Maybe I'm just really tired with it  being 4am, but I'm gonna upvote anyways. I'm down for minigames
---
It's worth mentioning that such high crits with shadowbolt could only come with AQ+ gear levels and the ruin talent ( aka you can't be soul link).
---
The way you worded it makes people think they can be unkillable gods who can 1 shot everything but that's a bit of a stretch :p
---
That... might be the most wholesome vanilla story I've ever heard.
---
I used to go cuddle alliance players who were rping being asleep in Golshire and Stormwind.
---
Good job bringing attention to it.
---
I think I just read the stupidest post of all time.
---
I have my doubts that selling portals will be that profitable. I hope it is! As I am planning on rolling a mage too. :) 
---
If you do make the gold for the raiding. All thats needed then is a guild with a schedule that suits and the rest sounds eminently doable.
---
Unless youre a mage, you would never see area looting in practice anyway.
---
People seem to think they will wade into a giant lump of enemies and kill everything in seconds. When in reality they will go from one enemy to the next, and bandage/eat in between. More than enough time to loot each corpse individually
---
it is not gone, what are you talking about? people will still abuse it, just less, but they WILL and the server economy will still be fucked after a few weeks.
---
Woah, double titan panel all the way!
---
Man if those are your goals you're gonna need to play a ton.
---
Some of the stuff in your list won't be achieveable in 2 years, tbh.
---
Through the Auction House and by selling stuff that dropped when grinding rep for my frostsaber. On my alt I bought the epic mount from AV which saved a couple of hundred gold.
---
But why?
---
Only top 1% warrior will have the stuff to do that. You guys are dreaming
---
No idea if spells proc it too, I played neither priest nor caster so couldn't say.
---
I do however believe it only overwrites the previous buff if it is worth more, so if I crit you for 3k then 100, you don't get the buff for the crit of 100 (But you would the other way round) but don't quote me. I just know I found it really annoying
---
I think you're taking his joke too seriously...
---
Titan panel shiiiiiitttt what a throwback haha.
---
no if a rogue hits you 50times and you've got 2 equipped you've got roughly 63% to see a proc.
---
On the other hand if a rogue hits you 50 times during a duel you most likely lost it.
---
Paladins are the best utility class in the game tbh, priest doesn't come close to paladin levels of utility, freedom/ bop/ bubble / lay on hands/ all the blessings and salvation /DI .
---
Priests are versatile healers that can fill any niche but paladins are god tier at their own niche, which is defensive support.
---
In pvp Holy paladin is the best defensive healer in the game, in pve pallies top the meters too( followed closely by priests), albeit pallies can only heal 1 target at a time but they're so efficient at it that they'll probably be the only healer left with mana after a long fight.
---
Yea a ban is too much, I agree. Let's just hope blizzard will fix these little things for the release, because as you said it would be frustrating.
---
I'll try to milk it as much as I can, but I only care about my 100% mount
---
Could just ask someone to quickly invite you while your dying to change layer and avoid it
---
440 def is also unattainable pre raid.
---
Woah is that Varian Wrynn quote a reference to [this comic](http://i.imgur.com/byHsYKQ.jpg)? If so, that's a crazy specific throwback.
---
And we'll be finally happy
---
Wasnt the whole reason they introduced layering was to avoid this? otherwise its all been for nothing.
---
They're gonna reach the point where they take so many measures because they are afraid of dead populations they will kill the population themselves. Why can't they just give us the best version of the game. They keep making decisions that clearly show a complete lack of confidence in their own game :/
---
Pretty much emphasizes how important the whirlwind weapon quest is. The axe is pretty much on par with your lvl 45 staff of lore recommendation
---
Portals aren't that profitable. Back when I played about 20s + reagant sufficed as a decent tip for a portal. Vanilla is very time consuming. Even playing hardcore for 7-8 days you may struggle to get to 60. Also, levelling isn't how it is in retail now. Just a shitty barrier before the actual content begins. Levelling back then was actually somewhat challenging and fun.
---
I don't think that's true at all. you get full exp for a quest up until you are 5 levels above the quest level, but quest levels tend to be quite high: usually around the level of the highest level mob you are expected to kill.
---
So if you are killing mobs 1 level below you, then waiting 2-3 levels, then turning the quest in (Which is a long time at higher levels), you are still getting full quest exp. The gear you get is less relevant, but you can accelerate key gear quests or make that unnecessary with dungeons. 
---
But the total exp from quests, per quest, is the same. It might mean you need to do more total quests at low levels, as of course, you don't need to kill as much to get to the quest objectives when you are higher level with a smaller aggro radius (you can more selectively pick the right mobs to target), and you will get less total mob exp per quest completed (As even if you fight the same total number of mobs, you get less total exp, even if it may be much faster and easier). 
---
But really, nothing is stopping you from either doing more quests across more zones, and if you DO end up grinding, you are grinding for the same total amount of mob exp, as your quest exp is the same as someone who completes the same quests at a lower level. 
---
Of course, mob competition is a big deal for a warrior as you have mobs you really don't like to fight and you also are not good at doing yolo pulls for quest objectives, and you also need to keep fighting for rage conservation reasons. 
---
But I feel like an overleveled warrior for the area he is in deals with all those problems more easily: you can pull much more aggresively when needed, You can bypass mobs other non stealth players cannot to get to quest objectives first. And you can go grind tougher mobs that other players don't want to if things get desperate, because you are a high enough level that nearby mobs with a couple extra levels are only 1-2 levels above you where they might be 3-4 levels above someone who is doing the same quests at lower levels.
---
Hey again :)... check out the profile of that mad person who is claiming 2000$ is reasonable for a painting like that. I wonder who that is and from were he got that number....
---
The second someone dicks your pocket healer, you're dead.
---
Sure, but he asked.
---
The fact that there is a cool down will mean that. The length only determines how much it will suck for the players. Unless the cool down is just a few seconds long will hinder people from potentially joining another group after they leave another.
---
Hpala is god tier in bg premades, in alliance premades priests are there for offensive dispels and cc.
---
Pala is the heavy lifters of alliance pvp healing , I mean freedom/bop/bubble/lay on hands/ blessing of kings/wisdom and the fact that pallies wear plates + shield makes them the tankiest healers and the most mana efficient too.
---
Does this mean they intend to keep layering in for longer than 2 weeks? why go through the hard work of trying to perfect it if they dont intend on keeping layering in for long..
---
Hell ya 10/10
---
The only realistic way for to achieve such a feat is by being the GM of a server top 3 guild, the raidleader of the server number 1 guild or a streamer with a rabid following and strongarming people into helping you out.   
---
As a healer you're quite handicapped at farming those silithid elites that you'd require more help than others all the time. I simply don't think it's viable.
---
PVP
---
There are far more ppl that has German as their first language in Europe than English.
---
Enchanting in cities. Going to be very annoying switching layers only to find you can't enchant someone else due to layering! Let's hope that Blizz takes that into account.
---
You can get 1 scepter per raid lockout, so 1 per week (except maybe the first week). The fastest opening in vanilla was 3 weeks, with a lot of servers even taking up to 10 weeks. So if you are on a relatively small server then it is definitely possible to have 5+ scarab lords with good planning (and a lot of grinding of course)
---
Race doesn't make the class good, player does.
---
Lets hope Layering gets disabled and EU gets Language servers until then.
---
The main problem with this is that some of the Retail players will never get passed the log in screen because the game doesn't automatically line all the colours up for them.
---
Your mouseover macros can be shortened.
---
For one, I always use /use instead of /cast.
---
    /use [@mouseover,exists,nodead,harm][]Kick
---
This one is shorter by 6 characters and won't error if your mouseover is friendly or dead.
---
It'd also be worth testing if specifying the tooltip is required.
---
Yeah, but it's boring with only having approx. ten people online...
---
My wife actually prefer Chanel rouge for her lips, and she know what she talk about
---
I'd go Warlock. They scale better all around. 
---
If you're looking for ez-mode leveling, go ham on that Hunter life. 
---
Both are fun in PvP, in PvE you'll probably have a better bet as a Warlock, especially as phases roll out.
---
"WoRlD fIrSt LvL 40 dInG sCrEeNsHoT"
---
You mean literally no changes, except all the stuff which can be changed with addons, right?
---
Even if it is stuff which is included in retail :-P
---
To give you a more accurate picture of how many might kick the bucket before classic launch.

The Crude death rate pr. 1.000 people is estimated to be 10,1 in developed countries [^(1)](https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/pdf/mortality/World-Mortality-2017-Data-Booklet.pdf). This is already flawed now, since China is a large percent of the playerbase, but aren't included in developed countries catagory. (Rightfully so imho)
---
With 144k people on this subreddit that would mean 1454,4 deaths a year. Taken into account that only 22% of those deaths are by people between 5-65, we have 319 deaths a year. Time period of 2 months means around 50 people in the age-range of 5-65 years old statistically dies. 
---
Afterwards you have various variables like the social hierarchy.

I spent a very lo g time gathering dark iron ore for Thorium Brotherhood rep to be the only  one in my 100+ person casual guild to have the enchants. That was a time sink, but I loved  it.
---
Sold mats on AH also had the luck of a few BoE epics coming my way via drops in questing. I sold the Staff of Jordan, Taran Icebreaker, Robes of Insight all before 60. Still remember where I looted them all too. Staff was from a mob in Tanaris, Icebreaker was from a mob in EPL and Robes of Insight was from Eranikus I think in ST.

Out of his ass I think

Looking for help with chosing an alt class for farming and casual lvling with my friends.

The thing is that I really dislike ranged classes and it seems like that the only choices for a good farming alts are

Hunter or Mage?  
---
Pros and cons for hunter and mage?
---
How did u calculate that, or maybe I’m wrong but I find it it’s more than 3000g :)
---
Roll a warrior. It is really hard to find groups as a rogue and in raiding it is even harder. Rogue generally not great in group play. You give zero buffs and sap is trash compared to what a mage or lock can do. The only reliable interrupt you have is kick that's great but there will be 6 other rogues in the raid already. I rolled a rogue on private server and it was criminal. People dont want to play with me it was really depressing. Compare this to my retail holy paladin it was night and day. Doors just opened for me all the time. Finding groups lol excuse me they should rather ask me if I want to play with them and sum me.

And dungeons. Compare smite's to the woodsman sword, which you get at similar levels, though you cannot quite equip it until level 18. Half again as much damage and 8 extra stat points, with better allocation.
---
gotten at level 18. Not replaced until you can solo a level 30 mob, or you run another dungeon or elite quest.
---
Druid is the best healer who can actually farm stuff outside raids in a healing spec , their healing specs are also very flexible as you can almost always not go more than 21 points in resto which leaves you with a lot of points in feral or balance.
---
Priests come second to druids (even as full disc) in that they can kill mobs without using much mana ( dot/shield/wand).
---
As a shaman I'll tell you this , 30/0/21 is good burst but if you want to farm stuff you'll be oom after the 2nd mob, so you'll end up having a lot of downtime regardless.
---
Pallies can't be considered farmers, takes forever to kill mobs but you'll never have mana issues at least.
---
You sir are a legend , total annihilation gives me a boner everytime i watch it
---
I wil start 1-2 weeks after launch to have a better experience as i expect it will be hectic to play first week, due to a lot of people that wont stick around but want to poke around and the low respawn timers combined.
---
I just want to enjoy the classic (vanilla) experience without any rush.
---
Troll is the best race for tank warriors.
---
No
---
Probably, yeah.
---
Ouh the key one is good, gonna add that for sure!
---
Gonna add the faction leader to the bosses list.
---
Gotta see about the pet/Mount thingy on how my space goes ... I remember my bank to always be full
---
You sound chill as mate, feel free to PM me if you want a levelling buddy!
---
Alliance troll rouge better :)
---
You don't need semicolons at the end of your line in simple macros.  
---
Also in this one:
---
    /cast [] Sinister Strike(Rank 1);
---
Current target is the default so you don't need [], it would only be necessary if you had other conditionals and want it to fail to your target, eg.
---
    /use [@mouseover,harm,nodead][]Sinister Strike (Rank 1)
---
Yes, but by far not the closest ways in town itself (Mailbox - AH - Bank). Ratchet doesn't have an AH.
---
And yes the typo is a bit stupid... hopefully a mod can change it!
---
1) I opt to skip rattlecages and go for everything else. Pickup Bats/Wolves quest as soon as I hit 2 instead of waiting  
---
4) I skip rattlecages, its the biggest bottleneck behind the initial zombie quest in my eyes  
---
8) I never had to worry about deathwarping as I use my hearth after pumpkins+scarlet warriors  
---
10) As a caster I definitely suggest waiting till 8 to do Maggot eye. If your a melee you will want to find a group or delay till 9/10  
---
13) I play priest so I intend on either crowd sourcing linen for a quicker wand, otherwise I was averaging 60 linen by lvl 10-11  
---
Final notes) Definitely worth learning your breakpoint for spells, know how much you need to save and dont be afraid to aggressively buy bags from a vender if you have excess money  
---
Other) I intend on doing silverpine till ideally 14 (up to the shackles quest) then going to barrens for an easy 14-20  
---
Also if your a lock you can npc everything on you(including dagger) to instantly at the very very beginning to train immolate without any downtime.  
---
And have fun is the main thing
---
I would highly suggest checking out [CauthonLucks](https://www.twitch.tv/cauthonluck) videos as he's been routing lots of different horde races and classes and adapting routes over time.
---
Yep, time to become top 1%, get all the buffs and consumables.
---
BiS isn't unattainable.
---
That said, I'm playing mage so I won't 2shot anyone with my staff
---
Although I really like the achievement System introduced with WotLk, I personally dont want it to be in classic aswell.
---
Most stuff is trackable though - Weapon Skills and Reputation are on your character tab, Exploration when the map is completly visible. Quest dont Show up anymore when moving through the world, items are stored on the bank. Defeating the bosses is kinda not trackable (I mean, gear and quest rewards Show off that you killed them ...)
---
Sweet! I'm only just realising that I never *really* looked at these, suppose you can't see them with all the talents in the way.
---
Thank you, this is really helpful. I enjoy the gameplay of both so my main concern is the significance of their relative troughs, so to speak. 
---
Are warlocks "weak" in wPvP before BWL/ZG or just meh? (Or are they just not as strong, but still strong?)
---
And do Hunters remain strong in pvp through AQ or does their effectiveness drop off as they have less gear upgrades?
---
Its a big showoff if you can ride and have 4 mounts in your bags. People will see "wtf that dude spended 5k gold on diffrent riding skills, mounts and runecloth for rep"
---
You got to showoff somehow : )
---
OP is talking about the distance between the bank and the AH, not the distance between spawn and the city. 
---
But youre right about the initial walking distance
---
Hahah, you are my new favourite internet person!
---
It will just be used on launch and then removed. Or maybe brought back for AQ. And high density community events. In fact if they have been playing with it on, why remove it at all?
---
To be honest, most of the stuff is just a bit grinding. The real hard stuff is only Reputation on some very specific ones and the real hard quest chains later on. Most stuff will come by itself, e.g. sets.
---
I mean if TBC will be a Thing later on (and therefore WotLk later on), it would make sense to allow further Progression with your existing classic character, wouldnt it?
---
I like you
---
Thats my plan though!
---
Looks Dwarven to me! Very cool.
---
I see this everywhere as an argument for layering, but layering does not affect queue times. Nothing but more (physical) servers affects queue times.
---
No it's fucking not you're just a wuss
---
and i love you random citizen!
---
Relax, still 2 months left and they are keen on fixing bugs.
---
Butter me up.
---
Well that’s not true, just yank it and tell people that you gonna roll on leather and weapon nobody will make a drama for it, «  you are doing them a favor by tanking, tank is the really hardest person in the group to find
---
Solo shadow is great, group shadow is quite bad.  
---
In solo play shadow is very tanky, does not bursty damage, but highish sustained.  With spirit tap talent it is at single target grinding without high gear dependence.  Spec gets worse over patches as it scales a bit poorly since you get no real benefit from crit.  
---
Group shadow is pretty bad not acceptable.  You typically cannot multidot without pulling aggro on lower level dungeons or interfering with CC.  When people start to outgear dungeons at 60 your dot lasts too long and is inefficient damage.  Larger issue is that the person you are typically replacing in a group would be expected to provide CC or aoe, shadow does neither.  Largest issue, is that your only mana return ability requires you to killing blow enemies.  Without high uptime on this proc, you will stuggle to not OOM every other pull.  
---
You might also have trouble finding groups as shadow if the group already has a healer+caster dps as they won't want to share loot as much and might look to spread out armor types.  
---
In raiding shadow is 100% not viable, except for the fact that the debuff shadow weaving will buff your warlocks by 15%.  Often there is a spot for a single shadow priest, but even then it is actually more optimal to have a disc priest spec disc/shadow hyrbid and just keeps up shadow weaving while healing in between.
---
&gt;Some people will play mostly on the weekends, some will only have time during weekday evenings, and some will play in the early morning before heading out.
---
I will be playing weekends, weekday evenings and early mornings before heading out.
---
And Holy priest is an edited screenshot, and so is resto shaman
---
Btw does anyone knows an addon to check completed quests? Most quests will be easily done as I know most stuff about classic and can just go Zone by Zone ... but since there are also some hidden quests here and there, it would prolly be wise to use an addon to Keep track of all.
---
Dont want any questhelper addon that Shows you what to do / where to go though!
---
Just read there are no language specific servers and we're both bilingual sooooo
---
you can take the shortcut to ratchet from spawn and then fly to org from there, if you have a few silver.
---
iluvthisgame. Got to level 8 or so. I still remember Mooonfire and rooting the mobs thinking druids were the DoT Kings. 
---
[Then I saw this](https://youtu.be/R469aThZRhw)  and had to reroll Warrior.
---
Yea man to achieve exalted with steamwedldle and bloodsail you have to kill 1 goblin in the blasted land almost 8,000 times I think and he has an 7 min respawn
---
Well if launch was sooner seems like decent timing but I guess you can’t wait around for 2 months before working. Good luck to finding something that lets you attended launch the way you planned.
---
come ooon, cooomee oooooon
---
We tried that with some friends and went for chilly, con, carne but I didn't have friends. My pew pew fire mage was still named Chilly so I keep that going for me which is nice
---
Awesome!
---
Hunter has very little competition for gear. Especially if alliance as there isn't any other mail class. This is good if you are playing with friends as you don't compete for loot.
---
Okay, that's a point... but still, as you mentioned in you comment above, inside the city the distances of Thunder Bluff are shorter.
---
Holy priest and Resto shaman are also screenshots.
---
I think discipline priest is the most interesting though as it shows a meeting stone suggesting that there is a dungeon, however it does not look like any location in the game. Based on the road and ramp up I would guess that it is an early Dire Maul concept.
---
https://lmgtfy.com/?q=layering+vs+sharding+wow+classic
---
Good points, people underestimate the social aspects some classes/specs have to go through.
---
Layering is within the boundary of a single realm. Sharding is accross battlegroups.
---
Layering is shit.
---
Sharding is shit.
---
I can't see any other real difference.
---
Well I will go for the pally charger and really hope for getting the strat one as I will farm the hell out of this ...
---
But the pet ones is definatly possible.
---
The Gold cost Change for the riding skill to be expensive and not the Mount came with TBC right? So yeah, 1k Gold each will be expensive oof.
---
In before some youtuber makes a video using your post as his script.
---
How is it with the goblins in the middle of STV and to the very North? I remember them to give rep for steamwheedle. So in theory you could farm Booty Bay until exalted with bloodsail and then afterwards go for the gobos to get rep back for steamwheedle as they dont give -rep for bloodsail.
---
But yeah, only works if it goes up to exalted ...
---
Good Thing im rolling human rofl
---
Nice quest addon, why not just play retail dude
---
If this is serious, go re-evaluate your life choices
---
That sucks bro,  i feel for you.
---
I mean yeh 60 is the very first Goal of course.
---
Enjoying the experience includes some of the base stuff for me (like Exploration and quests for example) ... the rest is just my inner completist.
---
Thats why I just decided to go undead priest. Feeling forced to play dwarf bothers me greatly, and on Horde I wouldn't be penalized picking between Troll &amp; undead. I also wouldn't have to deal with undeads, whom counter your fear.
---
thats just a blatant overlooking of the impact of instant cast spells. New spells that are stronger then old spells which are quicker to use do in fact change gameplay. All of these spell utilities involve more running around, I know i'm being asked if I never played TBC but to state that nearly all new spells and abilities are mobility or near instant isn't changing the gameplay is a bigger indication of not even knowing the game in general.
---
Imagine if Moonfire was as mana efficient and powerful in vanilla classic as any of the TBC spells, it was a complete shift in balance
---
this!  i NEVER did fishing or cooking, or even rep grinding, despite playing a LOT of vanilla.  I'm kinda hyped to chill and fish and chat to guildies
---
There were quest helpers and thottbot in vanilla.
---
I farmed righteous orbs, and as an enchanted then sold crusader enchants - took maybe a few days of solid farming
---
not anymore you couldn't right?
---
Later down the line, enchant your bank alt’s boots for run speed for that extra hmmph
---
warriors and rogues:  "yo what about my weapon skill brah?"
---
If you're playing solo I would pick mage. Shaman has a lot of group utility and is very valuable for that reason. 
---
I played a 60 shaman in vanilla and I remember farming elemental fire for my epic mount. It was an absolute pain in the ass. Meanwhile I see mages group up 4-5 elementals and just AoE them down.
---
Hey..you wanted some achievments : )
---
UK crew checking in  
---
me and my IRL friend have planned a weekend of wild camping for 24-26 august so that we'll be nice and fresh and ready to spend the week LAN'ing classic and getting all stanky and eating kebabs
---
layering is effectively adding more servers.  I'd assume each 'layer' is actually just a separate virtual machine running a separate server that you are invisibly logged in and out of
---
Eh if you're tanking you get to bring whoever you want to the dungeon, just deny all the rogues. And combat is dogshit for pvp, a fury warrior just equipping a 2 hander is almost the same for pvp, you just lose mortal strike.
---
I mean if the Server/character transends into TBC and WotLk someday where you have the collection for Mounts and pets, then it is something for sure.
---
But Im really scared of the space I will Need in classic
---
I’m guessing you mean 3,5% per year otherwise you’re looking at 160k gold
---
do you have a recording of your mum shouting at you to get off the PC tho?
---
&gt; So if you are killing mobs 1 level below you, then waiting 2-3 levels,
---
But how are you getting those 2-3 levels ? That's the issue. And yes, something is stopping you from doing more quests across more zones, your low level from holding off on delivering quests and the general availability of quests. You're also gonna run into issues with quests giving comparatively lower XP. 
---
If you're holding off delivering quests for two levels that's several thousands of XP you need to acquire in some other way to be able to access new quests. So let's say you grind up a level, then deliver all your quests for another level. Now you've built yourself a "barrier" of XP that allows you to chain low level quests for a while. But since you're higher level now you need more XP to get a new level and the low level quests you're doing is giving less XP than what quests your own level does, so you'll eventually run into a situation where you've done all the available low level quests but haven't gotten enough new levels to create a new tier of low level quests. And then you're back at the beginning of this scenario again.
---
I’d give you a medal but I’m poor so have fake gold 🥇🥇🥇🥇🥇🥇
---
Thanks for the great, informative post
---
In Vanilla you were. Sort of goes against the nochanges doesn't it?
---
**Classic will be a lot different than Vanilla even with nochanges** 
---
People don't realise that in Vanilla your topdps was doing 300dps in MC and in classic that will be your bottom dps. 
---
I understand why they think they don't want any changes but all that shine is going to wear off a couple of months into the game when you start realising how bad some things actually were and your friends start burning out one by one because they're pigeonholed in their roles. 
---
I think most people loved the social aspect of Vanilla and that's why they're excited to return but why would you want to ruin it then because you don't like hybrids doing 75% of your damage, you want them to stay useless at 50%, that's what it basically boils down to for PvE; me me me and it's just asinine.
---
Class balance is a hard thing especially when you need to think of the implications of it in PvE + PvP but I don't think you'd ruin anything if you'd add something to most specs 31 point talents. 
---
For example: 
---
* giving Moonkins a 30% manaregen while casting
---
* Ferals can use potions in forms and benefit from enchants
---
* Prot paladins get a taunt
---
* Shadowpriests get a manaregen buff for 5sec while damaging NPCs
---
* etc... I'm sure there's a lot better suggestions from people in the know
---
This would already address major issues in PvE, for PvP this would barely affect anything but I understand why people would be against it because it's a slippery slope.
---
It's just a shame it took them this long before releasing classic, in an optimal world we could have already been enjoying a /r/classicwowplus/ with all specs viable and everyone happy.
---
less likely to die in suicide? pfff yeah right
---
True
---
Farmed lots of plaguebloom, mountain silversage and dreamfoil.
---
And when I say lots, I mean a huge fucking amount \^\^
---
XP was only converted to gold after classic wrapped. You think there QoL stuff like that in classic? Kek.
---
Did some searching and the “easy” part is steamweedle but you HAVE to farm jazzrick in the badlands* from revered to exalted for bloodsail rep
---
Non of those existed so you must be misremembering, unless you can show us a counterexample.
---
lol not all heroes wear capes my friend thank you
---
Short summary: sharding happens when there’s too many people in a small area, if a shard has the capacity of, let’s say, 50 people and during launch 500 human characters are made on a single realm, there will be 10 shards.
---
A layer, to my understanding, doesn’t care how many people are gathered at one location because it covers all of azeroth, so theoretically you could have 3000 human characters in the starting zone (or whatever the layer population cap is set to). But when more characters are created they will be put into another layer.
---
A 1000 gold item to showoff sometime is worth the single slot.
---
It's not ganking if they deserve it.
---
was hoping for a fat BFA-transmog-hero bending and praying over a slot machine for something to titanforge and as it only warforged vanishing(loging off) in anger....
---
Great video still
---
yeah i always make sure to have low expectations (i'm a pessimist by nature anyway) but we can hope sir!
---
They stated during blizzcon that the sharding would be realm-wide, not your typical retail cross-realm sharding.
---
You pretty much can reasonably catch things even at level 1, if you just attach a bobber. The difficulty is in trying to stay awake, while everyone is having way more fun than you.
---
I'll save fishing when I'm 60 and need a break from the farm.
---
Well not me because I have stuff booked for launch day, every damn time!!! Adulting sucks
---
My first 60 was a paladin.  While paladin epic isn't free it is much cheaper.   If I recall right it ended up costing around 600g to complete the quest.
---
My second 60 was a rogue (undead, so different server).  Since I was leveling a little later on and the server had an established economy already and I was just very aggressive about keeping herbalism leveled up enough so that I could herb where I was questing and I mailed everything of value (greens, tradeskill items, etc) to a bank alt to sell on the AH rather than vendoring it.  This resulted in having enough gold to afford epic mount when I was level 58.  Dinging 60 and immediately going to Brill to buy epic mount was a good feeling.
---
There's only so many quest in the game especially in the lower levels. They guides aren't giving people some super secret leveling route they just point you in the right direction. People not using guides will will still be taking similar rogues because theres only so many quest a lvl 13 or 26 or 54 person can do.
---
Fake gold is real gold for me. You're welcome!
---
I believe there is a trick.. If you fly from thunserbluff to Zoran strand it will fly to crossroads then splintetree costing 7s or so but if you fly to splinter tree from tb and then to zoram strand it cost 6s or so and it is shorter. Not sure if this is correct but I vaguely remember seeing it last night.
---
Probably fine, albeit a bit disastrous if they can't get a PVP-RP realm running.
---
I'm having a hard time deciding between warrior or mage. I know almost nothing about vanilla warrior (i mained one panda-present) and i don't even use macros for it currently but vanilla  seems to have a lot of macro usage and stance dancing thing that i haven't bothered to research. Plus for mage it will be nice leveling with 2 or 3 of my friends who haven't played wow before really. And on top of that i played mage vanilla-cata so i understand the class well. But warrior seems so sick.
---
That's what I said.
---
What the actual f\*\*\*.
---
Carman is my favorite super hero.
---
I sold helms of fire while leveling and also constantly bought out leather below a certain price on the ah where I could make it into a belt and vendor it for decent instant profit. I had close to 1000 before I hit 60.
---
If they can handle the total amount of players we'll see (recent track record is good). Whats fixed by layering is that you can stick 30k people in the same realm in 10 different layers.
---
r/nicegirls
---
If you are gold farming then you are not interested in the chance of a drop within x kills anyway. Gold farming is all about the expected amount of drops.
---
&gt;Layering is within the boundary of a single realm. Sharding is accross battlegroups.  
---
&gt;Layering is shit. Sharding is shit.
---
wow, thats actually VERY wrong.  
---
Layering basically adds new whole servers (around 3k pop) inside the server itself, eastern kingdoms + kalimdor. Sharding creates new zones and subzones based on population/load.  
---
With Sharding you have 90 versions of Goldshire with 30 Humans in each shard.  
---
With Layering you got 3 versions of Goldshire with 900 Humans in each layer.  
---
Basically layers are more comparible to soon-to-be-marged servers ala Warsong1, Warsong 2, Warsong 3 which eventually get merged together. Only layering is dynamic and shuts itself off when no longer needed. The exploitability also goes down, because there will less likely be an 'empty' layer whereas retail has hundreds of empty shards, because they are REALLY easily created and then have to stay active for atleast 1 person.
---
Hmmm okay thats prolly classic then as I remember WotLk to just spam the shit ouf of Booty Bay to get to exalted with bloodsail.
---
Well ... thats gonna be a hard grind then rofl.
---
still was one of the best heroes in the game
---
Locks in general as a mage.
---
Have fun in retail.
---
Not having a level 10 Rogue bank alt for Sprint
---
Amateurs
---
First, thanks for the detailed response! I really enjoyed reading your thoughts to each section, which I had hoped would provoke some thought and mayyyybe even a little discussion. Well done!  
---
So, in response, I'd like to share my thoughts with excerpts from some of your responses.
---
&gt;Every single relationship, happy and healthy or otherwise, is based mostly on **personal gain**. 
---
This is a great observation, and something that is easy for anyone to ignore - I think because it seems somewhat shallow, or maybe even needy. The fact is, we all have needs, and many of those needs can seemingly be fulfilled or assuaged through a healthy relationship.
---
&gt;  I think a stronger way to phrase your claim is that we always want **some** change and concessions made on the part of someone we meet, but you try to minimize this by finding a "near perfect" match before so much less realigning happens in the relationship. Let me know what you think. 
---
This seems like a very reasonable approach - and I like how you reword it. I probably should have been a little more clear in that portion, and adding your definition would certainly help.   
---
To explain my thought process, I was considering how an external change (physical appearance) was altered as a result of "encouragement" from a third party. There is a lot to unpack there, and a bell is ringing in my head of a self-study I took a few years ago on narcissism. In that study, I read various articles and books regarding the character trait, covering a wide range of changes to the way we define it. I don't have the links readily available, but a quick Google search provides several solid derivative sources - these typically categorize types of narcissism, or place it on a sliding scale. The general takeaway seems to me that narcissists can be either completely self-absorbed, placing self value over everyone they meet, or, in seemingly direct contrast, they may appear as dependent, or needy. Ultimately, the best way to define narcissism, appears to be defined not solely by the actions of an individual, but more-so by the motivation for the exhibited behavior.  
---
In one book, I recall the trait was defined as a means of survival - theoretically genetic - used by either strong or weak people to fulfill their needs. For example, consider the "hunter/gatherer" stereotypes. In this case, a strong hunter would brave seemingly unnecessary peril, risking his or her life to bring back to the tribe a healthy animal. In exchange, the hunter would receive praise, and desirable gifts such as clothing, food, and perhaps a nice home. Then, we have a weak gatherer who may be unable to produce as much to the tribe - perhaps due to sickness. In this case, the gatherer brings what he or she can, but it is nothing compared to the strong hunter. In the first example, the narcissism is easy to spot - the hunter, motivated by pride and the need to be adored, needed and desired, goes to great lengths to achieve what he or she desires, typically regardless of the cost to others (textbook narcissism). But, the hunter actually needs more than just meat to survive. He or she needs the tribe, and what they bring. Similarly, the gatherer may provide what they can, but seeks attention as a weaker member, perhaps by using their weakness as a cause for receiving what they also need to survive, regardless of the cost to others... (sound familiar?). Ultimately, their goals are similarly aligned.  
---
I have even seen couples on both sides of the spectrum - and they were seemingly perfect for each other. The one, a "knight in shining armor" and the other, a "damsel in distress" living out their lives in balance, as both benefit from the other to fulfill their needs wants and desires. Of course, this type of relationship may be full of potential pitfalls, as often our needs wants and desires will change based on our circumstances.   
---
So back to the story. While reading the comments of the OP, I found many replies he made, defending his friend's actions, stating over and over that the guy is actually a "good guy" - and yet, to many people on this thread, something doesn't seem quite right about what his friend did in this story. I think, perhaps, it is easy to believe  his friend acts predominantly for the love and adoration he receives - making it appear that he strongly resembles the description of the "hunter" narcissist. Now, here's the tricky part - I think it is possible, given the little we know about the girl in the OP's story, it could be argued she may be on the opposite side of the spectrum.   
---
Unfortunately, I don't think we know enough to say for sure, so this is purely speculation/assumtion - but even if it is not known or understood, the implications are there, and this is probably what bothers so many of us, even if we struggle to express why something seems "off" about this series of events, even without getting into the morality of it. To put it simply, it was a selfish act on both parties, without thought of care for anyone else involved. And that is narcissistic.  
---
Yet, to your point, everyone is narcissistic to some degree. In fact, if we're going to be honest about it, we all put our own survival before the well-being of others. So maybe the key is to make sure we aren't hurting others whenever possible - and that's where morality takes over. I may need water or food to sustain my life. And I may not go out of my way to ensure everyone else has food or water, which is narcissistic, but it's not wrong. However, I am not going to take food or water away from others simply for my own pleasure, or stockpile resources to control them. This would also be narcissistic, but in doing so, I am hurting someone else unnecessarily, and this is wrong.  
---
While this example is clear-cut, relationships are rarely the same way. Even a married person may find "justification" for a separation and immediate connection with a new person based on abuse or adultery. But whether that may be acceptable or not is typically going to be determined on a case-by-case basis.  
---
So back to our original conversation, why would one person pursue change in another? What was the motivation? We don't know, but there are some breadcrumbs here that really have to make us stop and think about what they imply. During my original response to you, I neglected to consider the aspect of how we are all narcissistic in some way, and is why I "pigeon-holed" my thought of this story as "likely manipulative, and ultimately dangerous." So thank you for bringing out that aspect of balance, and how it affects all of us! Very well put!  
---
&gt; You can't know for sure and to what degree but you admit that, I think people meeting online is fine, they are both adults and accept the weaknesses of it. 
---
Very good point - and to be perfectly honest, I met my girlfriend on [Match.com](https://Match.com), so I have NO room to judge, haha. I could go on, but this is already wayyyyyy long. I REALLY appreciate your comments and perspectives on literally every comment you made. There was a lot to consider and I appreciated those thoughts - notably when you talked about how trust in a relationship is important, and "phone checks" or other similar behavior can be detrimental. Or the "rant" about monkey-branching up, keeping the motor running, or using people as stepping stones, and how that affects them. I think you really hit home with the comment "*while motivating her to get in shape is probably as good to her emotionally and spiritually as it is to both of them physically it is still not even close to a working relationship by itself"* \- then further expounding on that statement to really drive it home. And finally, offering a "flip-side" scenario that, while it may sound like an excuse, could have been a very legitimate reason for her to break things off from her first relationship!  
---
So thanks again - I've really enjoyed this discussion! Very refreshing to be able to take a deep dive, even if we mostly agree, I think I've learned quite a bit here!

It’s one of the reasons in cata they changed the insane in the membrane achievement to state you only need honored with bloodsail. 
---
But hey if you are dedicated then I wish you good luck man
---
Added to the list, thanks!
---
You said: «sharding is across battlegroups» which they stated would not be the case.
---
Damn that UI is horrible.
---
Up voted for a far out idea
---
Im playing bfa since 8.2 looks very solid
---
War of the ancients trilogy (10k years ago)
---
The Last Guardian (wc1)
---
Tides of Darkness (wc2)
---
Beyond the Dark Portal (wc2)
---
They are novels and not fact books like the books you have. I really like The Last Guardian and the Warcraft movie is based on same story but the movie is a disaster lore wise
---
WoW-Pro will probably be the best "bang for buck".  
---
Azeroth Auto Pilot will be working in Classic but has much fewer features.  
---
Zygor costs money, unless you know where to look.  
---
But then... There's this... https://tweetsave.com/furiouspaul_/status/1136682492092669953
---
Neat.
---
You'd have to spend 64 hours on your bank alt to balance the 4 hours it takes to get to level 10, and that's when you use Sprint every time it's on cooldown.
---
But sure - if you do this, why not?
---
The imbalance didn't make it interesting it made it boring for people who rolled hybrids who thought they could do anything else than healing. Nothing like losing a healer every month because he gets burned out and your raid struggling to down a boss. Good times!
---
Thanks for the hints :) and I vote for guild banks ;)
---
Is this that chick that had sex for her epic flying in tbc?
---
This guy is still around?
---
QQ this stupid company is remaking a game for an audience I don't belong to and won't change the game to serve the one I belong to instead of the original, QQ.  
---
Take a big step back and LITERALLY F\*\*\* YOUR OWN FACE.
---
You shouldn't say "we'll all". I for one will most likely not and only maybe look in later for a bit if I am seriously bored.
---
Quickly! Delete his comment before other ppl see it!!!

&gt; So that means for example you can still get a skill point for peacebloom at 65 instead of it turning grey at 50. 
---
Wrong, it does not work like that. Peacebloom will still turn grey at 50 even though you're a tauren.  
---
All Cultivation does for you is when you learn herbalism you start at skill 15 instead of skill 1, which means you can gather Earthroot directly without having to level up on Peacebloom/Silverleaf first, this saves you maybe like 10 minutes of farming.
---
also, your max herbalism becomes 315 instead of 300, but there are no herbs in classic wow that requires higher skill than 300 to gather so it's useless in that aspect.
---
no language specific servers really dumped my hype. My Problem is not, that i cant understand or speak english but other people dont understand or speak english and will speak in german, italien, spanish etc. and I won't understand it
---
That's why I'm taking the whole month off just in case.
---
Exactly this. As a hunter I could feign death on top of the node then mount up and ride off. Only took a few weeks of farming.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_fallacy
---
*opens and this closes mouth again*
---
But sharding doesn't apply to classic. So the only real sharding implementation is the one on retail.
---
Please keep down voting me because you don't understand my message. The video game community became seriously toxic..
---
Should have done Air in silithus.
---
It's beyond unreasonable to expect the reintroduction of egregious bugs and exploits.  
---
There's a difference between NOCHANGES and LETMECHEATANDEXPLOIT.
---
ONE week? Filthy casual.
---
My group plans on doing it.
---
Going with a Feral druid for bigger group pulls and AoE tanking. 
---
Frost mage for AoE/Slows. 
---
Warlock for more AoE, and utility. 
---
Holy Paladin.
---
Only four of us so the fifth is going to be a random.
---
Between Soul Stone, summons, portals, Conjuring food and water, Innervate, Brez, Ice Block, Paladin Bubbles; the amount of utility is insane and we have theory crafted this is being the best possible 4 man combo for grinding nothing but dungeons.
---
Druid grabs several packs, mage goes into a standard AoE grinding rotation with Warlock multi-dotting and Rain of fire. If anything goes bad we have a lot of buttons to fix it
---
After any run 2 people can hearth, repair and train and get summoned back. Then two more can repeat that. The warlock can then summon themself and hearth to sell and repair. Warlock probably won't have time to hearth and train so they just train whenever we out level a dungeon and go to a new one.
---
I think it will be viable. And running around in near BiS for your level should be pretty fun for wpvp as well.
---
I was like oh yea imma get married... then you mentioned camping crossroads. Wellllp better luck next time!
---
How do you fly to Org without being to org to get the flight path?
---
Do you think you could post the high res versions of these individually? That would be amazing and I’m sure a ton of people would want them!
---
This was literally posted 11 hours ago https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c5wk40/all_classic_wow_talent_backgrounds_album/
---
Holy crap stop with this karma reaping reposts please.
---
is this some kind of copypasta i dont recognize?
---
Name checks out prolly
---
I legit made a ticket asking this many years ago and the GM didn’t even notice lol. He suspected it was just a random addition made by the artist
---
And 60 days u til release, then 6days until its playable. 666days, anyone seeing this?
---
I would rate Orgrimmar &gt; Thunderbluff for the mere reason that you will sometimes be selling items directly through global trade chat. Orgrimmar used to be the place to be to sell items. Unless all mails are instant, this might not be needed, but #NoChanges and keep the delay.
---
age don't matter as long as you have some good shit going on. I play world of warships, bunch of OG's on there and they are a riot. I am 2 years older than you and I would stream if I wasn't too busy.
---
To clarify, I’m not downvoting you, but I can see why others may because they feel like you’re spreading misinformation.
---
OP asked for the difference between sharding and layering on the Classic WoW subreddit, I’m assuming it’s because they want to know why some people are asking for the originally suggested (at blizzcon) sharding instead of layering. Not the version of sharding that retail uses.
---
Gold digger! 😂
---
Damn it! I missed that point! Shit. 
---
I'll redesign it with the pros and cons. Thanks for this input!
---
The cooldown could be 1 second and you'd technically be right, for 1 second, but that's not at all what you implied. Take off your tinfoil hat for just a second, jesus christ.
---
Will they still have unarmed to level too? My favourite useless skill. :)
---
This. I actually am not gonna play if we dont have german servers, its not because i cant speak english well, but i have been playing german retail (till Legion) snd english pservers, and the community aspect (Yes i know its retail, but Rp servers were quit different in community things). Its just so different speaking your native language and your second language.
---
It's principle * (1+interest rate)^(number of months/12) - principle for monthly.
---
500*1.035^168/12-200
---
Interest is 309g 34s 72c on a 14 year loan of 500g compounded monthly at 1.035
---
On welfare but nice ss :)
---
That's exactly what I meant. You seem to be quick to give blizzard a pass on their "solutions".
---
Is it worth what?
---
Calm down with the clickbait. It's an issue, but pretty far from "game breaking".
---
It's exactly as you say. The best we can do is keep bringing it to Blizzard's attention and hope they change their mind.
---
I want bear www.twitch.tv/highwarlordstino ‘s scepter. 
---
Hard.
---
Saying community is toxic.. Appears to be the most entitled shitbag of them all
---
&gt;Btw my guild tried all through vanilla to get a new dwarf priest, but they never found a steady one and had to settle with me! haha
---
I went through the same thing in TBC with Rsham
---
I wasnt the best and I got replaced in raids a few times but some of those better guys didnt last long cuz of all possible reasons. So they still went with me at the end cuz I was consistent and I was full bis before sunwell came  when the guild was cannibalised and I gave up.
---
if you switch to horde I'll be down
---
It's still 2 months before classic is released and hunters are without a doubt playable. Check some streamers playing hunter, it's like no issues what so ever. Minor bugs that might ruin your PvP experience a bit, but play with friends in that case :)
---
Upvoted for excellent use of popular streamers buzz words
---
I managed to secure 2 weeks off, soooo keen.
---
Not sure if this is weird or romantic... bit of both I guess.
---
In Vanilla soloing Scholomance and entire Dire Maul on my warlock, got my mount in a week. DM West was the most profitable for me but I switched it up for variety.
---
On pserver crafting professions mainly and if I really needed gold asap a couple of DM East jumpruns.
---
For classic I will start out with professions and a couple of level appropiate grinds that give rare loot for quests/professions, once DM comes out I'll be adding that to the cycle for some added fun.
---
Yo, can we get a ban over here, please?
---
Dungeons aren't exactly an experience goldmine (maybe if you have all dungeon quests), but you also won't have to deal with fighting for quest mobs/items in the world so that's good at least. Definitely going to be a grind doing the same dungeons over and over again for each level. That 4 man sounds killer though. Locks dont have AoE at lower levels so make sure y'all got some good wands!
---
Project 1999 (Everquest 1). By the time Classic is released it's gonna feel like a really quick and snappy game.
---
Nah probably not.
---
Saved for use later. Thanks.
---
Got 10 on ya, but no kids, just left law enforcement after 10 years. Going full time for cyber security and work full time, I will still game like I played years ago. Fuck yeh  man!
---
Damn, how has it taken me 6 hours to get here. I need to pick up my game
---
All characters start with their capital citys flightpath.
---
In 5 seconds of searching, I found this - https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info20723-ColourblindMode.html
---
It's pretty old, don't know if it'll still work but it might give you ideas.
---
Yeah no, you'd need to get the flight path first. :D
---
Yeh, lets ban everyone who isn't circlejerking.
---
Dungeons aren't bad experience, especially the first time through a dungeon when you have all the quests for it, but man it sounds like a hell of a grind to do the same dungeon multiple times *per pevel*.
---
I can see it being viable but probably not as fast as you think
---
&gt; Mouse over are great for Rouge, as as loose combo points on our current target if we switch targets.
---
Isn't that a bug?
---
I think the disc priest is a screenshot of the entrance to Darnassus
---
I hope you were hinting at this for months before bringing it up, I've had to ease into the convo so that she already knew what I was saying before I said it.
---
I mean wpvp isn't strictly fair so to say, it's not a duel where you know what you're fighting against, you could be fighting a mob and suddenly get jumped by multiple players of different classes, you'd be dead regardless of your class choice tbh.
---
I wouldn't say locks are weak in wpvp but let's say they need preemptively prepare for situations by having the right pet, healthstone , enough hp/mana to initiate a fight. The worse feeling as a lock is getting jumped on in wpvp while at low mana, having to life tap mid fight is painful. This is especially annoying when fighting hunters early on as viper sting forces lock to kill themselves even if they're ready for it.
---
In general though locks have a relatively short range on fear ( 20 yards untalented ) so lock typically want fights to happen close to them so they can CC, they're not particularly weak but locks tend to favor all in fights where they can abuse their pet sac , since lock have low damage early on they can't really end fights quickly.
---
Classes that can reset fights or keep locks at a distance tend to be very frustrating to deal with from a lock's pov.
---
Hunters on the other hand are highly mobile and pets do a shitton of damage if BM specced ( which you should be while lvling), if you add viper sting in the mix and the ability to kite you can whittle down players long before they ever get near you, there are so many ways to kill mana users without even fighting tbh. Just viper sting and  outrange them till they go oom then finish them off, this works great on low mobility classes tbh.
---
Hunters don't become weak in later stages, it's more about some classes out-scaling them ( not all classes).
---
Hunters in T2 are scary tbh, they remain a force to be reckoned with in wpvp even after AQ. People imagine everyone is running around in AQ gear but that's not really going to be the case, you'll still find players in blues / T1/T2 out in the world even during naxx.
---
The whole hunters dropping off is mostly from a pve dps pov as their pets don't scale with gear and most of hunter's damage is autoattack based, their ability to deal big burst damage isn't exactly weak tbh, aimed shot can destroy players.
---
Hell yeah brother!! I actually just enrolled for data management and analytics courses. Hoping that I enjoy it. 
---
I feel like a kid again man Haha. This game is insane.
---
These were the single pictures of the talent tree backgrounds, this is a desktop background with all pictures on it.
---
Obviously alliance, because horde has no blood elves yet lul.
---
Hey thanks! I’ll try it out when I get home.
---
People who think P-servers have it correct are just sad.
---
You clearly don't read other comments on this. Specially  [IStillUseABlackberry](https://www.reddit.com/user/IStillUseABlackberry/) comment.
---
You change something that affect multiple classes, on top of that, if you're going to change such an impactfull mechanic, shouldn't they change things affecting other classes? The end result wouldn't be authenticity, at all. And Blizzard has already stated that's what they're going for, so thank the fuck this low-effort post is only a child dream.
---
Why do you want to stream?
---
That seems to be right, the tree models and lighting of the scene is different but everything else except the meeting stone matches up with what is in vanilla.
---
Try.  Find out if you enjoy it.   Don’t not do it because someone might not like you when the same chance can be for the fact that some move love watching you.  Just give it a go.
---
Greetings /u/idcthatimfat,

You know which room.

Dude you legit mentioned I was swedish in your other comment. Yes I speak more than English and no English isn't my mother tongue..
---
Sorry im out. Speedrunning to 60 and theres no way even the prettiest or richest of the ladies will loot those harpy claws before me.
---
Nevertheless I wish you the greatest time in your jorney through Azeroth fair maiden. May the blessing of Elune shine upon your soul.
---
Similar thing happened to a friend of mine. He jumped through the window and instead of being ported to MC he took up lava swimming as a sport. lol 
---
iirc we ran him through BRD to get to MC collected the rock for the quest on the way continued into MC  and let him hand in at his leisure. Or maybe we stepped outside and summonsed him? I cant recall. It was the falling in the lava bit that really stuck in my head. That was so funny. :D
---
Yeah, if this is the case, you must be the dumbest one alive.
---
Gotta have the mandatory “look I played vanilla and I’m big deal - believe me... I wrote for EJ..”
---
Lol. You make me laugh.
---
They already achieved class balance back in TBC. The pruning has nothing to do with balancing the game, pointing to that is a strawman argument.
---
How can that be exactly what you meant when you said in your previous post, and I quote "Unless the cool down is just a few seconds", which is exactly contradictory to what you're now saying is your point?
---
And if you end up, at lvl 40, on a realm that speaks German or Italian...what will you do?
---
I guess you little brain isn't up to the task.
---
they only were cuz he played a key hero
---
Swedish my mother tongue. Online if I'm not playing with real life friends, I use English. Don't see how's that relevant though
---
I always exclaim "But you have no kids!?" whenever someone complains about lack of time. Its mind boggling now how much time I used to have. I assume the bigger room for being ineffecient back then is the main explanation.
---
Then you coordinate for people to be stationed in the starting zones on each unofficial language server spamming 
---
/yell This is unofficial french server (in French)
---
/yell unofficial Italian server is &lt;servername&gt; (in Italian)
---
And so on for each language.
---
Because it won't be that short, get real...
---
BUT ITS NOT A BUG ITS A 1.10 PATCH CHANGE AND WAS WORKING AS INTENDED WHAT DONT YOU UNDERSTAND
---
Chats are layered as well, aren't they? And even if they werent it will only cause an issue if you have already partied with someone from another layer very recently and the enchanter is from another layer as well, which I doubt will be very common thing. Layering wont stay for long as long which further limits any possible issues
---
My friends and I made a bet to lose body fat percentage before the release because we know we’ll be binging and don’t wanna look like Cartmans
---
&gt; sand waterfalls
---
If this is being implemented, this news is disappointing.  Why are they devoting time to modifying layering when they should be working on how to remove it down the line without problems or better yet how they can remove it as soon as possible after launch.
---
Tho, the better experience is still "a few days later" in my opinion. If launch day is anything like it originaly was it will be a huge clusterfuck of annoyance where you can't really do much.
---
Honest opinion : asking here if streaming is worth it, is like going to a fundamentalist church asking if sodomy is worth it :D
---
YMMV though :o
---
&gt; Afterwards lets talk again about how great the community is.
---
This is so cute. I see you are new on this subreddit.
---
So 1 second is your point, but it won't be that short? Your making a point about something that won't actually happen? What?
---
Is it worth streaming? You will never know unless you try. There are only two keys to becoming a successful steamer - be skilled or be entertaining. If you were writing guides for EJ then you already have well above average skill which will greatly help your viewership. Don't ask us what we would prefer watching because it doesn't matter, the real question is what do you enjoy doing so much that you would actually want to stream and share with other people? Best of luck mate, see you in August.
---
First thing that jumps to mind. 
---
1. Put spell on sidebar
---
2. Bind button
---
3. Hide sidebar
---
Yeah cause your comments are really screaming intelligence.. I got my opinion and stand by it, if you wanna argument it go ahead if you're just here to insult me you can fuck off
---
Its dead
---
Sorry, I forgot the /s.
---
I felt the physical pain when you fell off the boat.
---
Legion did come after one of the worst periods too though, relation to previous releases is a very real component in how much something is enjoyed.
---
I played a feral tank - they make superb dungeon tanks, and fine offtanks for raiding (I had no problems tanking Onyxia, all of MC, BWL up to Chromaggus).  So long as you bring consumables you can pull respectable dps, too, since most feral talents benefit both bear and cat form.  
---
Druids are also far less common than warriors, so less competition for gear.  As a druid tank, you have no class set to wear, so you will have to aim to acquire very specific pieces of gear to maximize your survivability and threat - see [this list.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wGBasFY8fFGpBtiD1TAUBB99wxboCSVh5MW_6b_z0oU/pubhtml#)
---
Though some times it's also in the first place you look.
---
You're on a subreddit about the Classic game commenting on how you won't be playing Classic unless you're seriously bored. Must have some serious issues to feel the need to comment in such a thread about how you *wont be* playing.
---
28 I just started streaming a few months ago. I only even thought about doing it to stream classic wow. Currently streaming league of legends and diablo 3 or 2 when I have the time. Asking if it's worth it is honestly a strange question. 
---
If your passionate about playing classic and want others to watch and enjoy your playstyle and banter you have while playing then of course it's worth it. If you are in it just to make money or to blow up and have 50 people watching than it's prolly not worth it. 
---
In these last few months I've learned a lot about myself how I play games and manage my time. I work 6 days a week 9 to 10 hours a day married with a baby on the way, streaming has been a great outlet for me to still have a social life outside of my coworkers and my wife. I made affiliate on twitch met some great people made friends with other smaller streamers. It's honestly been an absolute blast. To me it's been worth sleeping 5 hours a day for the last 4 months.
---
I thought discussing it well in advance was enough. I have mentioned it several times in round about ways but she doesn't get subtlety or nuance.
---
Awfully depressing yet factual analysis.
---
What a fucking rebel this guy is, holy maccaroni. Can I get your autograph? You're soo fucking cool!!
---
we're less likely to commit suicide than someone who's socioeconomically underprivileged, correct

---
Orc will give you a shoot against Rogues.
---
Thanks!
---
Lots of older people. 30 years ago people did not learn much englisch in school and some haven't spoken english very much since the since they do not need it for their job. Also in the DDR russian was second english, not english. The same may be true for other east european countries
---
Well it seems like a half measure to keep people from complaining,  I have the notion that the more they keep touching layering the more the community will get upset, unless they remove it which will make people happy I'd imagine. Personally I'd like them to announce they are working on how to remove layering as flawlessly as possible rather than how to make it less exploitable for the time it's in the game.
---
We sure am.
---
On launch it really won't matter. Put it in EPL to get to strat/scholo faster or IF to save money on tps
---
My real life friend was already 60 by the time I started playing, he taught me some of the basics.
---
I think you should make it so every column represents a class
---
so Fire on top of Frost on top of Arcane, for example
---
then, given the oppotunity, you also prefer to speak swedish instead of english?
---
online gaming is just another spare time activity.  
---
its not hard to understand that people prefer to speak their mother tongue while doing it.
---
Cool post
---
Well I like leveling at a decent pace, spending 1 hour to get ready to start doing a dungeon that ultimately gives less exp than questing isn't that. I'll do dungeons when there's big upgrades especially guaranteed ones, and i'll skip if not.
---
Even if you don't have 2 monitors. Most people have at least 1080p screens now and I'm able to have Joana's guide open in a browser on the side with WoW running in windowed mode in a smaller 4:3 resolution.
---
Joana's websites is pretty responsive so scales well when you shrink the window width. The only people who'd have problem with this will be maybe those on laptops since the screen size is generally smaller that what you'd have on a desktop.
---
I'm saying unless it's insanely short you won't be able to group up right after. And common sense dictates it won't be that short because then you won't stop layer hopping. Which means grouping up with different people for normal game play will be affected.
---
Nor would she get the joy and nostalgia that a game like this will bring. I hope that this situation gets better for you, is important to enjoy yourself but not at the detriment top your relationship. Good luck mate.
---
Just tell me one online game (except maybe eve online) with so much communication / coordination needed as in wow? 
---
In csgo it's important to give short simple commands, since you want to deliver info fast. It's something completely different
---
Much appreciated mate
---
&gt; You change something that affect multiple classes, on top of that, if you're going to change such an impactfull mechanic, shouldn't they change things affecting other classes?
---
They should.
---
Honestly I do this too even though I'm not colour blind... It's so much easier to just whisk your mouse along the trees.
---
OnePlus 7 Pro?
---
All except for that unlucky dude who is on hos honeymoon.
---
Actually I don't, I don't play games in swedish even if their supported. The thing is we're talking about an MMO here, it doesn't make sense to split people into smaller groups just cause they wanna speak their own language. People been talking about how great classic gonna be it's so much more social than retail and then they want to make it less social by having language realms.
---
Using a staff has zero negative impacts on you before level 31+, and wailing cavern staff is GUARANTEED, that's what makes it worth it every time. Relying on 30-50% droprate is a shit way to level.
---
Yeah, I know, I am awesome.
---
I can't wait to make a level 29 twink hunter and go through the quest line to eventually get the BiS weapon for that bracket. I miss twinking characters so much lol.
---
I know where you are coming from and i hated the direction WoW went in WotlK but i think the spells that were added in BC expanded the gameplay instead of making classic spells useless.
---
Which spells were neglected in the Frost Mage gameplay by the addition of Ice Lance and Water Elemental? The answer is none. A Frostmage that ran around spamming Ice Lance did no Damage when the target was not frozen. 
---
"all new spells and abilities are mobility or near instant" is a blatant lie which i pointed out but you insist that i am wrong.
---
Cyclone was indeed op but all cc effects had 1.5s casttime before (sheep, fear) so dont act like this was something that originated in TBC. The reason it was OP is that it did not share DR with some other stuff and that Druid was already the best kiting class without it. But that is a balance problem, not a design problem. Give Cyclone a 1 or 2 min Cooldown and it is fine.
---
You name 2 spells and then write "all these spells" simply because you cant name any impactful spells that were "mobility or instant" beside ice lance and shadow wort death.
---
I explained to you how those were actually well designed spells for a certain purpose but you insist that they watered down gameplay.
---
Im not a blind TBC defender, i know it had serious flaws but the stuff you explain is not mainly one of them (besides lifebloom that spell was brainless and stupid).
---
Yes they should
---
Can you link me to that server please? I want to check in touch with them regarding collaborating the project Dylo mentioned. PM me if you prefer.
---
Your going to see a lot of dungeon lvling cheating using multi boxing, if you can keep 5 lol all crushing it at the same schedule that's awesome. Dungeons are great. Only issue is with lockout timers. So don't clear to fast and have plenty of hot pockets on hand man. #livetowin.
---
First time I actually realized there were different pics on the talent trees was a few weeks ago playing a private server. And I've been playing since '07! Boy do I feel dumb
---
Clearing around the back has way lower chance of aggroing a gazillion parrot and friends from the ramp
---
Stream if you like to stream. Don't expect you will get anywhere with it unless if you truly enjoy it.
---
Same plan here. Although I'm starting to get a afraid I might binge so long I'll end up big-boned regardless
---
Oh wow, I had totally forgotten about the handbooks.
---
You're saying they should effectively tune every class to balance every type of off-spec to be viable in *every* part of the game?
---
It's me managing this project so I'll answer, but it depends on the size of the community and the demand. There will likely be two German servers, for example, 1 for PVE and 1 for PVP.
---
I can't expect there will be enough servers and empty players to support more than one server for the Italian community (which I'm struggling to get in touch with, if any one could help).
---
It shares DR with scatter shot. It's in the same category. Simple as that.
---
Maybe they will improve it
---
cool
---
And of course I couldn't even write Cartman properly.
---
Yup!
---
Hunters with engineering can solo the DM end boss for phat loots
---
Sharding = Whenever you enter an area you are put into a group of random people from random servers that occupy that same area as you. This is a temporary group of somewhere between 10 and 100 people and every time you change area you're put into another random group.
---
Layering = You are designated number when you create your character. Any area you enter will only be occupied by people with the same number. This is a permanent designation that's applied to groups of a few thousand people, meaning you'll see the "same" people no matter where you go.
---
Where is your proof that it wasn't intended? It could've been exactly how they wanted it to work.
---
Yeah Well, that's just like, you know, your opinion, man.
---
Glad I entertained you, i’ll pm you my twitch when i get set up for more comedy gold 😘
---
What was wrong with the BC expansion? Apart from flying mounts.
---
In classic I thought there is only going to be one  auction house per faction; one in Ironforge and one in Orgrimar. #nochanges and all that.
---
Whooooosh!
---
Similar boat to you by the sounds of things, thanks for the advice 👍🏻
---
Then don’t roll a hybrid. It should be known for everyone now what the issues are for classes that wants to play speccs in raids that are not optimal. 
---
Don’t change the game for everyone just because you want to to dps as a balance Druid in raids. Roll a mage if you want to be a caster in raids or stick to retail (or join a guild that doesn’t care if you are balance).
---
I guess you don't know what you're saying. It's fine.
---
7-8 days is pushing it to get to 60 unless if you have lots of experience speedleveling already. As a mage you would have to AoE grind and that requires you to be ahead of the curve, ahead of others. It might be do-able it might not, it actually depends a lot on how well you do on launch, how the situation with aoe farming mages on your server is, and also how hard you go on launch. If you can manage playing for 35 hours on launch, and then sleep for 8, and play 15-16 hours afterwards, then I can see you getting 60 in 8 days.
---
As for professions and stuff. your preraid BiS is mostly BoE greens, not that much from dungeons that you can't just buy off AH. If you do intend on doing the AFK in city gold making method, I would probably recommend to level tailoring for prebis chest, and then using the greens to DE for enchanting. Enchanting is perfect for AFK. After you have gotten your Prebis chest https://classicdb.ch/?item=14513 then you can actually just abandon tailoring. Or you can keep it and try doing something with it. 
---
If you do get enchanting and get some decent enchants like crusader and the other rare drops, and you raid in your guild and hopefully become the "guild enchanter" with a rare MC pattern like +30 sp on weapon enchant, then definitely you could afk in city and make gold with it. Playing smart with your gold and maybe doing some AH cheeky stuff.
---
But in order to get fully ready to do this, you would need starter gold after hitting 60, and you would need to do some dungeons. How much time you got for that kind of stuff while you are doing your "superbusy schedule"? I mean you gotta have some hours now and then since you plan on raiding.
---
I always level fishing in orgrimmar from 1-300 while i'm farming AV rep on an AV weekend and waiting for the queue. That way I get exalted amd 300 fishing in one weekend.
---
Where can i get one!?
---
I think it's because Horde in general tends to draw more pvp oriented players because of the racials. And this is of course me sort of just making things up but i think the class fantasy of an undead rogue is extremely appealing to the same kind of people who find joy in spending hours just ruining other peoples experience. ("Cool badass looking stealthy killer boi")
---
I guess you're putting words I've never said into my mouth because you're too mad to read.
---
It's like it was in vanilla:
---
One in every major city and two for the neutral ones (Gadgetzan and Booty Bay).
---
Right ? He's the bestest.
---
Thanks for the input, looking forward to it 👍🏻
---
\+15 on you, workaholic and family BUT I will make it work!  
---
What class, race, faction etc do you plan to go for?
---
horde racials lend themselves toward a more pvp play style (stun resist, fear resist, charm resist, war stomp). Which is why, back in the day... many pvp orientated players went horde. Although, Alliance aren’t in anyway gimped in pvp, especially with paladins. 
---
I also think it’s more aesthetically pleasing to be a hulking, murdering orc, bull, troll or zombie... than a gnome. 
---
AND I think early leveling zones had a lot to do with the disparity of horde/ally gankers
---
Yep pumped as well even though I have played on private servers. Only bad thing with classic being released is that it's so time consuming and addicting. Hopefully I'm not going to choose to kill boars over real life stuff I need to do. :P
---
I want my Todesminen back!
---
Thanks for the comment pal 👍🏻
---
If you don't mind occasionally tanking some stuff, then I definitely recommend warrior. Lot more fun to play in raids. If you don't like tanking, then rogue is pretty good too. Avoid dagger rogue if you can, that rotation is boring AF.
---
As a horde player I had my share of ganking and corpse camping. The grass is always greener on the other side ...
---
Yeah that would be the logical reasoning but since the game is so old now I figured, as I wrote, that it maybe wasn't true anymore. That people switched a lot between the factions.
---
Incorrect. Only people with severe mental disabilities call it VC.
---
It's an app called "Final Countdown", you can create multiple timers and use them as widgets
---
Sure, let's start over. What are you saying?
---
Have been researching Warlock hardcore for the past month and really thought I was done considering other classes. Then started briefly reading up on Fury...and now I’m torn. Does Fury continue to improve through the phases or is that more for the weak-to-start classes? Mainly focused on all variants of PvP
---
This is exactly what I'm doing.
---
I do find however that the slower progression helps keep me interested in the game. Even though I'm still low level and I've never cared much for fishing or cooking skills I'm still wanting to spend time on it because they're actually useful. Also we can now fish while streaming stuff so it's pretty great.
---
To have a laugh, and to pay off my missus so i can play more 😂😂
---
 The feel of the aesthetics are definitely different. Makes sense.
---
hehe true
---
Farmed tyrs hand for hours on end. 
---
It's weird. Because that place is really NOT a great farming spot. Not sure why it was so popular back then. But it was also quite the PvP hub.
---
That unbalanced shit should be balanced rather than left *deliberately* unbalanced because of screeching autists.
---
This is basically my experience. I wasn’t the bearer but my GM was.
---
The smallest faction will always have a rougher time in my experience, though one area which is always rougher for Horde is Hillsbrad Foothills. Horde quests start there around lvl21 while Alliance turn up at lvl30.
---
I think I’m really gonna focus on keeping my professions up to date this time. It was really annoying making linen bags when I was lvl 58
---
as expected, you think there’s easy money in it
---
Sold a BoE for 200g. Then I would play with Auctioneer. I'd make lowball offers to people selling BoEs in chat and sell the items on the AH during weekends.
---
Cant wait to finally play the game I payed for again
---
Read comments and you will understand the problem :)
---
PS: Many people is not the same as all people 
---
PPS: FU :)
---
Im going to make an Undead Rogue and make it my mission to stop you from being nice.
---
I agree. Rather than rush to the finish line, let’s just enjoy the marathon.
---
Affliction and demo are always my favourite.
---
Not at all, in fact I think it’ll be quite challenging, but getting peoples opinions who have been in a similar position gives a good insight into what to expect, part of me is thinking a should just resurrect my youtube channel and not stream at all.
---
Wailing Caverns for them Savory Deviate Delights!
---
I thought this when I read it, I played Horde though, tremor totem is too unreliable so our tanks just had to learn this from the second they stepped into MC
---
I can confirm that specifying tooltip is unnecessary. You can write:
---
    /use [@mouseover,exists,harm,nodead][]Kick
---
An empty `#showtooltip` will show the tooltip for whatever ability the macro triggers in its "current" state, which is always `Kick` for this macro.
---
it would just be super overpopulated zone that's hard to quest in. But hey, that's how it goes.
---
On the other hand, now, if you change groups twice in the row now, people won't be able to see each other. So what's worse?
---
I’m picturing a Christian bale from Batman to the machinist
---
Sure just wait for phase 2 and run DM for the tannin :)
---
how about you stop beeing so fucking narrow minted and realise that there are countries in europe which do not have english as second language?
---
I see your points.  I feel things may be slightly different than our past experiences though.   Whole new ballgame this time around imo, gonna have the older crowd but definitely a lot of people new to the classic environment so it might change which side does more banking and such.  Obviously the server you pick, and how the pop ratio works out will be a factor, really only one way to find out I guess.
---
What does this has to do with this subreddit?
---
Should have done a lot of things different honestly, but it was my first mmo. What did I know?
---
your not a warrior if you hadn't had Whirlwind weapon (axe ofcourse) so im sorry your spreadsheet is not accurate.
---
loved it don't get me wrong. but you cant not include the whirlwind warrior quest and call yourself a warrior.
---
yeah, world PvP is always a bitch even without the described situation. You should play on a PvE server ;)
---
Readin through these comments I can't help but feel that PCs were the real skill cap of vanilla
---
Yikes at that post history, wow classic really brings out the 4chan.
---
From what I have heard, its not possible to hamstring kite in classic due to mobs movement?
---
Without going into specific things, it depends on what you mean by "unbalanced shit". Some classes and specs came with utility to raids, somethings are only used for leveling, and not to mention PvP which is a whole other ball game. If you're going to tune these "unbalanced shit"-specs, it would affect other classes being less viable etc.
---
You still don't see how these two comments correlate?
---
&gt;You're saying they should effectively tune every class to balance every type of off-spec to be viable in   
---
&gt;every part of the game?
---
&gt;unbalanced shit should be balanced rather than left *deliberately* unbalanced
---
If you do, you don't want Classic. If not, then you still don't know the *implications* of what you're saying.
---
Now this is cringe satire
---
Nope, every character starts with their corresponding capitals flight point
---
Tirisfall is the coolest aesthetic starting zone with the most difficult/spread out quests.
---
It's almost certainly not as fast as leveling solo but if you have a team of 5 who are game then it'll be fun and you'll all be geared to the teeth while you level!
---
When I was just a kid, playing my Nelf Hunter, I chose talents based on which of the backgrounds I thought looked coolest that day. I still remember the day when someone asked me What the Fuck my specc was. Somehow I had managed to get to lvl 40 with basically no specc.
---
If you want to make changes to the game at least understand it first.
---
Classes can't just be split into their specs like that. The 31 talent for warlocks are garbage for raiding so they are not used. There's 2 viable specs for warlocks in vanilla and removing debuff limit doesn't suddenly make a new talent, though it does shift the balance a bit.
---
Talent A) Affliction + destruction, also known as SM/RUIN (Shadowmastery the 5/5 talent in aff, and ruin the 21th point in destruction). : https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IEzbbRrkqZZgx0tM0z
---
Talent B) Demonology + destruction also known as DS/RUIN(DS=Demonic sacrifice from demonology)  https://classicdb.ch/?talent#Ig0bZbxhzThoZgx0tM0z
---
As you can see the main difference between these specs is that DS gives 15% damage increase, and SM only gives 10%. But with SM you get nightfall and you don't kill your pet. Which is important since you want the imp buff on the tank group. 
---
So as you can see, affliction warlock IS VIABLE. You want to bring at least 1 in every raid for the tank buff. Usually that warlock is actually given a corruption spot but obviously you can't give that to every warlock. 
---
Lastly, what do you even benefit from getting affliction warlocks? You can't use CoA because you have 3 other curses to put on, wuhuu you can use corruption. Who cares? Really, it's keeping up 1 dot so what.
---
Lastly, you changing debuff limit is gonna boost the overall dps which means raids will be easier, it removes strategy in spelluse, and it does almost nothing to actually balance out the game because the big dps classes out there get at least as much as anyone else.
---
Why stop there? A level 20 hunter with aspect of the cheetah is even better. And if you’re already going the route of leveling your bank alt, why don’t go for level 35 so you can get artisan professions and arcanite bar / mooncloth transmutes?
---
Hey guys.
---
I really wanted to play hunter since I love the play style. My idea was to focus on PVP end-game since I don't have enough time for hardcore raiding but after the leeway bugs that were recently brought to light I decided against it. Do you guys think Blizzard will fix the leeway thing or should I maybe consider rolling rogue (which I also like).
---
I used to play resto shaman in Classic all the way to BFA and I enjoy playing a healer since you can easily get into groups etc. The thing I don't like about healing in classic is spell downranking. What are your thoughts on this?
---
Thanks ;)
---
So you provide an escort service? I’m listening
---
I havnt really been playing any game for like 2 years. Cause every single game I play gets boring after an hour or 2 of play. But i played vanilla and start of tbc like 12 hours a day. So I am excited that I might start enjoying a game for once again
---
Arthas: Rise of the Lich King
---
Sounds like a 5th man hunter or shaman wouldn't be bad due to no mail wearers post 40.
---
Leveling guide on phone if you don't have a second montior maybe.
---
Because for mooncloth you need to be in a Moonwell. And this means traveltime.
---
I'll level a specific hunter (or mage) for this purpose. But sure the possibilities are unlimited!
---
I'll just use the nog elixir (I think you buy it in Tanaris? It's been too long) for playing a race I can't stand.
---
Leveling a warrior solo is quite hard (for me at least). One thing I noticed that does help a lot, and also when leveling a rogue, is to choose herbalism and alchemy as your main professions until you hit 60. Along with this you have to also level cooking and obviously first aid. Always having consumables while leveling makes for a much smoother ride  and far less downtime on your journey to 60. If you have a healer that can level with you would be first prize though.
---

I did a bit of digging and I think [this site](https://www.scrollsoflore.com/gallery/displayimage.php?album=search&amp;cat=0&amp;pos=1) has slightly higher res images, just searched for fury as an example. Use the search to look for other specs.
---
They just disappear when their role in the plot is over.
---
You are very welcome! If you are ever need of any advice plz feel free to send a message me.
---
is the mage rotation really just frostbolt x infinity?
---
I've been using Joana's guide too on a NE hunter going through the NE zones and while skilling up fishing, cooking, skinning and herbalism.
---
I got to level 20 in roughly 22 hours with herbalism skill being below what it should be (only just able to pick mageroyal when I got to the Redridge section) thanks to not getting many herbs in Teldrassil. It's much worse if you pick mining as there are no nodes in Teldrassil and don't appear to be many in Darkshore.
---
It's created for speed levelling but that doesn't mean you can't go off and do whatever you want in the process.
---
i wont *cries in no money*
---
Pretty much! You evocate sometimes. Also mana gems.

Mvp!

Patch 1.10  
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.10.0  
---
&gt; Quest Experience for Gold at Level 60  
---
Previously, quest experience was wasted if one completed a quest at level 60. In this patch, any quests done at maximum level will have their experience reward converted to a healthy amount of gold, thus adding additional incentive to completing those quests in your log once you hit 60.
---
Even in super high pop servers I generally found that griefers wouldn't be enough of a presence to warrant changing sides. The gankers on horde side love Redridge, but the main reason to level there is as a rogue so you can just stealth away.
---
Rise of the horde and the last guardian are both excellent, but I think the last guardian is my favorite.
---
&gt;Only issue is with lockout timers
---
Thats porbably only going to be an issue with RC, SM and Stockades I'd recon, no other instance is that short. Maybe Mauradon single side?
---
&gt; Your going to see a lot of dungeon lvling cheating using multi boxing 
---
Thats my backup gameplan once I hit those pesky contested areas, being a multiboxer puts a huge target on your back
---
They don't correlate because your comment was shitty bait. Like that other guy at the bottom claiming that OP wants Rogues to be healers.
---
&gt;If you do, you don't want Classic.
---
I don't care about Classic. I care about good games. Classic is in many ways not a good game and could be improved.
---
Except we have legions of brainless fanboys who *don't* want the game to be improved because then it will "not be Classic".
---
Funny. In a way, the claims that Classic fanboys are all blinded by nostalgia did come true.
---
I rolled a Druid as a second char fairly late in vanilla and took skinning and herb.  Gathered everything I was able to while leveling and sold it on the AH.  Had enough gold for my epic mount by the time I hit 60.
---
Also, is that [Frostmourne](https://www.scrollsoflore.com/gallery/albums/wow_talents/warrior_arms.jpg) on the arms background?
---
Ive seen more than 10 people (minimum) claim that 6 days is going to be close to average. There was a specific thread about this some time ago, and 90% said that sub 10 days would be average. A bunch of people called me crazy for saying 15 days average was closer to the truth, but id wager its going to be around 20 days.
---
Nice layer!
---
I may take you up on that, really appreciate it 👍🏻
---
Some hardcore guild(s) will farm the mats ahead of time if the requirement is normal.
---
The Battle of Anecdotes
---
Filthy casual, looking for children what about WOW 2.0? Nah I need a woman who sees it the same way as me, so hard pass.
---
you can get to 150 on a fresh character
---
up to 225 after 20
---
up to cap (300) after 35
---
&gt; You're full of shit bud.
---
You can with what I said, but nothing you argued supports this claim.
---
You also haven't addressed the fundamental problem I raised with this line of thinking, bud.
---
Can u imgur link them? Id rellay love to have them
---
f) it's a game
---
g) not your second or 3rd job
---
Glad someone in the sub recognizes this....
---
disappointing, to say the least. Are there any other caster specs with a more interesting rotation?
---
I find your lack of faith disturbing. &lt;wheeze&gt;
---
Hunter has been discussed as being our go to for 5th.
---
We plan on running a second group horde side with a shaman but a lot more melee oriented.
---
Seriously, I love your response. Thank you very much. I will think about it. Enchanting is a great idea.
---
Get scarab lord title
---
Well, I've seen many people meeting their SO in MMORPG, so good luck to you.
---
I dont think people knew back then about the racials that much. It always feels like your own faction is getting ganked more. It also depends of the faction balance. I played both sides and always felt like my side was the one getting jumped constantly
---
I could dig up the comments/thread, but id rather not..
---
Trade and general are full of enough spam without being populated by yet more messages that I am literally incapable of understanding.
---
For the minority languages on a server as well, imagine trying to make a career as an enchanter in trade chat when you are a Spanish speaker on a primarily French and English speaking server. Velum's didn't exist back then, so no AH for you! So what do you do? All your enchants are linked in your game client's language and the English/French speakers can't read the link, so have no idea what you are selling.
---
This really fundamentally breaks the game, in a way none of the other minor issues like layering do. And to make it worse I haven't heard a single valid argument for why Blizz shouldn't separate languages. Not one. (As OP points out, none of Blizz's stated reasons hold up under even brief scrutiny.)
---
Stormwind has a moonwell in the park, had a level 35 hunter with tailoring / Alchemy specifically for that. Although if you're horde you probably want to be a rogue to not constantly die in Stormwind.
---
It's because you're doubling down when you could have just said "Oops, my bad.". Blizzard clearly explained how sharding *was* going to work in Classic.
---
Holy shit those pick pocket macros work?
---
My launch will be staying at work and missing it.
---
Amazing
---
I dont think people were that knowledgeable back then about the racials and how which are better. It just had to do with the server faction balance. Alliance was equally merciless when it came to ganking
---
I think it's less pservers is right and more about druids *already* being weak on pservers so if they're even weaker than that...
---
Mine was an anecdotal as well, albeit prefaced by "I think"
---
Exactly.
---
Do we really need yet another discussion?
---
It’s in game. It’s not going away til the end of phase one a few months after launch. Blizzard is aware of the issues and is tuning layering.
---
There isn’t really much else that needs to be discussed.
---
Not enough lazy peons ...
---
Its pretty good on release since you dont have to worry about "the pack", random pvp etc, ideal situation questing is better but it will be hard to get that on the first month.
---
You would be surprised how fast it can be. With a farming group that you're used to playing with, after you work out the kinks when running each dungeon several times you start to know every single pull and what to watch out for and what to handle, not to mention every person has the best gear possible for the most part.
---
Also the lock gets Rain of Fire at 20, which is when the group would start doing dungeons anyway. 18-20 for Deadmines.
---
There is a very distinct difference between the two things you mentioned. Ingame addons are good at showing you where and webapps are good at showing you how. Routing out an efficient answer to how is very time consuming and tedious. Some people claim to be able to follow guides in spreadsheet form, but if you're planning on playing ridiculous hours in zombie mode I suggest something graphic and simple enough for it to be genuinely hard to make mistakes.
---
[vanilla-questing.me](https://www.vanilla-questing.me/) offers premade routes for both factions and an option to import your custom written route.
---
Guides also let you know a good time to go to another zone and which zone to go to if anyone isn’t very familiar with Azeroth / 1-60 leveling process. The last thing you wanna do is travel all the way somewhere that has few quests or has awful quests
---
That was epic! Loved the layering discussion and the updates made me lol. Subbed to Judgements channel, will watch that tonight.
---
As if retail players are dumb and need things handed to them...
---
You didn't address anything I said, but I still agree with you first post, it's fine to discuss these things. However, ultimately your idea that some parts of the game is not good, are the same reasons while others think it is. See you in classic with my unbalanced shit spec :)
---
Sharding small areas.
---
Layering whole world.
---
Leveling by grinding dungeons is like eating alot of food that has no flavor.
---
I would just get bored.
---
Your screen looks so clean... :D
---
I have no idea what this thread is about
---
Thanks for all the responses. I got my hopes up and then dashed them quite expertly
---
Same here. Looking at them without all the gubbins, I’d swear I’d never seen them before. Also, I wonder how I’d score if somebody turned this into one of them YouTube tests.
---
UK crew checking in also,
---
we're gonna start playing at 6am, have a nights sleep then get up in the morning when everyone has dropped out / gone to work
---
And you will be getting ganked from lvl 60s once you get into contested zones... enjoy.
---
The problem with hiding the rules that govern a system like this is that it makes it harder to find ways to exploit system.
---
I know that sounds like a good thing, but here's why it's not.
---
**This is a beta.**
---
The point here would be to find the exploits in the system so they can be fixed.  Once you have a million people, instead of a couple of thousand, encountering the system on a daily basis, any exploits that are possible are going to be found \*fast\*.  It's possible, unlikely, but possible, that the system has no bugs, but if people could reliably program without bugs, betas wouldn't exist.
---
It is in the best interests of everyone that the specific rules of the system be explicitly stated rather than left a nebulous mystery.  People can't easily find what's broken if they don't know what they're looking for.
---
hahaha but what about people who want to RP as a monk!?
---
Haha, the OnePlus 7 Pro is a great phone!
---
Well if you found it annoying it might be worth picking up still and experimenting with. Thanks man
---
I was the holder of the scepter on Stormscale EU. Holy paladin.  
---
Took a lot of work and a lot of effort to do the collecting.  
---
I was a part of a guild called Glamour which was one of the top guilds on the alliance side and I had talked a whole bunch with the leader of one of the top guilds on the horde side, Curse, so when the time came we discussed among ourselves on both sides and came to an agreement that we would pool all the fragments on me with both alliance and horde players working together. Curse convinced the other large guilds on the horde side and had them transfer all their fragments through the neutral AH.
---
In return for them pooling all their fragments we agreed to keep them updated on all parts of the questline, where we were at the time, when we were going to do the major parts etc. and finally when we were going to open the gates.
---
The gate opening was public knowledge and the server crashed multiple times so we had to postpone, partly because of bad servers but mainly because of evil PvP mages with arcane explosion which, when used in a place with hundred of targets, was hell... We then set a time late at night but that time got leaked but we managed to open the gate anyways and it was glorious!
---
thats a minority of the population
---
Wow that's sounds like when my niece(5 years old) have already planned out her whole life and how she is going to meet a prince and become a princess
---
In classic was it possible to disenchant level 60 greens with only 75 enchanting skill?
---
Bet his bank alt wears a cape.
---
Dont, i played as a holy paladin and I opened the gates back in the day :)
---
This is turning into a nightmare with the layering posts. 
---
We may need the sword of a thousand truths to stop it
---
Hunter if you count it as a caster.
---
Strangely did not expect shoulders to look this good on a troll tbh.
---
This was the plan. Leveled a priest to 13 today, doing RFC later tonight...
---
Hope this one stays inside and away from society. Jesus.
---
Personally? I dont give a toss. That being said I'm a 52 year old curmudgeon so not so much your target audience I think. So, go for it. What have you got to lose? :)
---
Check post history. Unhinged.
---
good strat to be fair.  we'll probably be sitting in queues but i dont really care its all about the hype of the moment haha
---
The only priest I know is lezonta but he's not leveling anymore, mostly just does lv40 shadow pvp. Nice guy though and has lots of knowledge about priests from both vanilla and pservers. https://www.twitch.tv/lezonta
---
Begone thot
---
Defcamp, but I believe he's already 40.
---
Druid. You can do it all. Tank, heal, dps etc for dungeons and more in the HotW spec. You can see farm like a mage comfortably with prebis gear. 
---
Stealth is very comfy for solo stuff. You are great at escaping engagements too.
---
All the "discussions" I see are "layering is shit and ruining the game" followed by "chill out blizzard is working on it". I litterally have no clue if the intended part of layering is actually working. That's all I wanna know
---
Awesome. I’m sure he has some vods. Thanks!
---
Fury is the best pve dps spec through-out classic, mages and rogues come close but fury is king.
---
For pvp though arms is what you're looking for.
---
Do we have a seeker though?
---
Yeah org definitely has a higher pop than TB at all times which equals easier trades
---
I know C++, C# and bash-scripting pretty well.
---
I think there's 2 reasons as for why it doesn't quite make sense yet to write a script for that.
---
The main one being that the ranking in each category would have to be manually determined by me anyways and stored in variables.
---
So I'm simply estimating that the time it takes to code and feed it with data takes longer than doing it manually.
---
Also: Right now I'm mostly tending to roll priest. So I'd probably just adjust the weighing so that priest is the result. :D
---
However, rolling priest comes with another problem, that I had not even considered yet.
---
I can't be a Gnome-Priest. I don't really have too much of a preference for any of the other races. But I really don't want to be a dwarf. So Undead would be nice. But when I roll an undead-priest and want a Mage or Warrior-Alt, which then would of course be Gnome, they'd be the other faction. So I'd go with NE or Human. I slightly favor NE for the looks. But Human has a better racial.
---
So from the aspact of avoiding the race-picking issue, Druid or Mage would be much easier.
---
Another unmentioned aspact is that my friend now kinda decided that he wants to be Warrior, so that's why this otherwise high-in-the-course-class has suffered a bit.
---
All in all this means the algorithm I used yesterday lacks some other important criteria... Race-choice needs to consider the aspect of Alts and the class-choicse needs to consider what my friends will play while also considering the likelyness of sticking around.
---
The formula gets more and more complicates... Maybe I should just roll a dice.
---
I remember Net, he was a nice guy
---
Nah man, Peggle
---
Cock of the north
---
love the speed enchants. genius
---
Same people which created bfa are behind layering.
---
Looking for logic behind their decision is pointless.
---
You bought a cat at booty bay ah, that's where your money went:)
---
I had to answer this a couple too many times for friends, thus I wrote a whole discussion with 300+ arguments regarding which is better, this branch deals with whether Classic is better for new players. The discussion is still not voted on, feel free to participate:

---
Do you get the title for completing the quest chain or being the one opening it?
---
If its really limited, there prolly no Chance for me then. If its for everyone doing the quest chain, I will get it sooner or later I hope.
---
But titles in General is a good point
---
I liked the world building of Retribution. What else could Paladins be seeking retribution for but the loss of Lordaeron to the undead?
---
Sweet Elune how did I not know this
---
Yeah i am leaning towards undead because i will be playing shadow mainly.
---
Blacksmith? Farm Thorium Brotherhood.
---
Warrior is for the hardcore, leveling is hard, gearing is even harder and gear maintenance is a huge hole in your pocket , not to mention farming as a warrior solo is also hard.
---
So in a way you need some serious dedication to do all of these things but in return you are rewarded with being the best dps in any group content ( pve/pvp) and the best tank.
---
That's exactly the case
---
yet all that didnt help me really decide xD
---
lol what the fuck... the conspiracy theories begin.
---
warriors level by killing stuff asap. verified fact.
---
If it was truly optional. I cant get my old model and animations on my retail characters. They are forever fucked 
---
If they couldn't make it work on retail, why would they bother taking the time to do it on classic?
---
The exp/hour for dungeons is okay, as long as you don't die and your group is decent. Still, dungeons are way slower than questing+grinding solo. Keep in mind that doing the same dungeon a dozen of times is very repetitive and can get boring kinda quick. (I couldn't do it :D) You will also miss a lot of cool quest chains, that just make the world feel alive. (Elixir of Suffering, Battle of Hillsbrad, Fenris Isle, EP/WP questchains etc.) If you want to enjoy the game as much as possible, I suggest to mix quests in between dungeons. 
---
On the plus side you will have some nice blues when you hit 60, if you decide to dungeon grind.
---
No its really not, not in the slightest.  No more than people who will play classic.  The fact that they play retail doesn't make them dumb
---
Okay thanks. Followed.
---
I would strongly advise everyone to pick up skinning for leveling as it's mainly extra pocket vendor money which will help you get your lvl 40 mount without effort.
---
You heard they already fixed that right?
---
Rogues can add some cc/ stuns and kicks. They get an aggro reducing and clearing ability (feint/vanish. Rogues do consistent damage all stages of the fight but have almost no aoes. Warriors can taunt loose mobs, add some debuffs to bosses, and boost their damage by eating cleaves. Wars take a lil longer to get rolling as they need to pool rage but they can do great aoe damage on 2-4 mobs and also get a huge damage increase at 25% execute range. Overall I think rogues are more boring pve as wars can save healers/ overaggro small adds for damage boosts/ and pick up big adds/bosses if needed. Rogues is maybe funner pvp cuz you get to pick your fights and win most 1v1s but I'd say war+pocket healer is the funniest pvp in game.
---
To all lonely ambitious men:
---
One quick look at his/her comments on other forums should tell you more then enough, skip this one, you deserve better.
---
I believe you get the title “scarab lord” and a black bug mount.  
---
It’s been a while though I could be wrong
---
The reason you're having a hard time understanding the difference is because there essentially isn't one since it's based on the same tech. However, because it's being sold under the name Layering in classic means that plenty of people are convinced that it's something completely new.
---
The entire reason why the nochanges movement started wasn't because vanilla couldn't technically be improved, but because the people working for blizzard in 2019 are not capable of doing that and sharding/layering is a great example of that.
---
Hold on are you really suggesting there arent enough French people to populate ONE PvE server and ONE PvP server?! (Or for any other language?). I'm sure people would rather play on a language specific server than have the 'luxury' of access to an RP server. Who want to witness a bunch of foreign RP?!
---
Nobody want's to be that one English speaking guy who has joined a bunch of French guildmates advertising in trade looking for a tank for their dungeon. Theyre all chatting away in /p and you have no clue what is happening. You subconsciously assume they are talking trash about you and your tanking skills because you cant understand. You feel completely excluded, and it just isnt fun at all.
---
That is, pardon my French, pure bullshit. We didnt have to deal with that over a decade ago, and why the hell should we have to deal with it now.
---
This is an MMO. Not just any MMO but one that has been specifically recreated because of it's sense of community. Being able to properly communicate is vital, otherwise what is the point of playing classic, because retail does what you are describing, (grouping and never talking to anyone) much better. We asked for this game because we were tired of dealing with that crap, not because we want to farm Nefarian again like in the good ol' days.
---
Apologies if this reads confrontational, I'm angry at Blizz not you :P
---
IMO one of the things that Kill “modern” MMOS and the old school MMO feeling is Language server/ Region servers 😾
---
You can farm as any class tbh.
---
Leveling an alt to 60 specifically for farming is something I would only recommend if you main a non-druid healer.
---
Dumb eh probably not
---
Needing things handed to them
---
Absolutely 100%, anytime blizzard introduces any kind of "do it yourself, show some effort" type of content, the fourms go nuts and they end up making a catch up mechanic invalidating the whole "effort" thing
---
Sorry if that has been answered already: This means there won't be any kind of sharding at all? Not even realm- or layer-intern sharding in the starting zones? Can the servers really handle 3000 people in one spot? What about dynamic respawn?
---
I was just playing on a pserver yesterday as horde in hillsbrad lol. Ended up rage quiting because I got ganked like 8 times over the course of the day and the graveyard run is a bitch there.
---
The upside is not having dead servers after a few weeks. 
---
It's very likely that a lot of players will be flooding the servers when the game goes live and only a fraction of them will actually keep playing the game. It could be BfA players who just want to check it out because of the shared sub or older players who realize after a while that the game no longer appeals to them.
---
Those players will leave so layering allows Blizzard to overpopulate each server for a while to account for all the people who won't stick around. 
---
If they didn't use layer they'd have to create many more servers and after "the tourists" left the game every single server would have extremely low population.
---
Except that everyone has a favorite memory from BC... and taking flying out would mean I can't redo that awesome Swift flight form quest line.  Took me forever, trying to find groups for the dungeon before every dungeon was too easy, and heroic meant something.  That shit was the best.
---
That's not retail players, that's people in general.  Itll be the same with classic
---
As far as I remember in TBC or Wrath Charm and Fear became shared DR CCs, but in Vanilla Charm and Fear are on different DRs. I might be wrong on that one though, I mostly used the Felhunter and Voidwalker for arenas.
---
Anything but warrior , paladin or shaman tbh.
---
Paladin / shaman are group utility based classes and warrior is obvious.
---
Everything else can play solo just fine.
---
No you didnt. You said you would level faster but it would be better for pvp. You wouldnt have suggested dagger if you implied dagger was as bad for pvp as sinister strike. Boo on you and your lies.
---
Night Elf? Eeuw :P
---
Ni Hao?
---
What about them? If they are not considered exploits they don't need to be fixed.
---
And if you're going to 35 anyway, might as well go the extra 5 for the mount. Even faster bank to AH travel. Or hell, just 20 more levels more for the epic mount. Everyone knows lvl 60 bank alts are where it's at.
---
Thanks for listening mate, glad you liked it!
---
I am missing a few addons to complete it, its half finished, bar, minimap, chat and bag addon, i told the hunter chat that i didn’t want to be judged by the unfinished aspect of it, but here we go... :p
---
Whenever i log onto retail and see constant floods of chat about it and go into general fourms and every damn post is about it and when blizzard starts making changes to the game to appease those people, it's no longer just a small group, obviously not every retail player is the same way, but the common conception from looking at the way blizzard handles things and the way people bitch and moan about every little thing that isn't handled to them, its easy to generalize the entierty of retail.
---
There a reason all those guild speed runs are 15 warriors in raid. Still need rogues for kicks I guess.
---
Oh man I felt this in every bone in my body haha xD so good!
---
Sharding = Multiple versions of the same zone, transitioning from one zone to another could make other players zone in and out of existance.
---
Layering = Multiple versions of the same server. Other players will only zone in and out of they join groups with people who are on a different layer.
---
Your Mana lasts longer. You struggle less to keep everyone alive. Same as a tank. You won't die so fast and you have less problems to get or keep the aggro. IMHO it's way more satisfying to progress as a tank then to do so as a DPS. Also when you're farming resistance stuff...last week you had problems with not getting killed by geddons slaps. This week this fella will have a hard time to bring you down.
---
So goddamn satisfying.
---
After watching asmongolds streams on the stress test servers the servers can easily handle like 400+ people in the same area, the lag didn't even seems that bad
---
I actually love to just go there and ... breath-in the ambiance of the zone. I made several damned good RP sessions there too !
---
You don't need to solve sharding, it was removed from Classic a while back.
---
Lord of the Clans is one of the best Warcraft books if not the best. It's covering the history of Thrall from his birth to him being Warchief.
---
Don't like, don't play. ezlife
---
And I still don’t know what to play.
---
Or just make an allied race....
---
That's the small vocal minority you are seeing,  by no means a way to generalize the entire retail population. 
---
That's like saying because I see so many posts about it, every classic player is elitist and wants new non-classic content after naxx
---
If PvP is what you are looking for, then Warrior really is a questionable choice unless you know you'll always have someone to heal and dispell you.
---
Warlocks are way more self-sufficient in PvP.
---
DM isn't really confusing. DM is Deadmines on its own. DMN, DME, DMW however indicate which area you're gonna run. Because let's face it - you're not gonna sell anyone on a full Dire Maul clear. Also you need to specify the objective. If it's a tribute run for instance ...
---
Hamstring kiting works, sitting doesn't it was only on private servers. Lets be realistic here best way to lvl is with a  pocket healer(shaman). Kargoz did  lvl1-20 less than 10 hours with shaman yesterday on beta. Which is really nice.
---
With only 1 enchanting skill.
---
&gt;Check our Skarm Tanks videos on YouTube
---
I've watched every one of them, a few more than once.
---
Breath of the Wild Expert Mod, hard, immersive, Zelda. Perfect.
---
It's an awesome feeling when you can heal people better and have a huge Mana pool.
---
Damn. I wonder why they chose to put it there...
---
I dedicate this song to my future husband:
---
https://youtu.be/2mQy5E6ugSs
---
Non, nous on est là rosé avec notre français en Amérique 😘
---
You're not understanding
---
It MIGHT be a small vocal minority but that doesnt matter becuase blizzard is listening to them and making changes based off what THEY want, if it only went as far as constant posts on the fourms i could shrug it off as a small vocal minority but when the entirety of the game itself is getting changed based on what these people want you can no longer call them a small vocal minority becsuse they speak for everyone at this point
---
The upside is not having dead servers and also not to compete with 9 jillion people to skin 5 bear asses.
---
Magic the Gathering Arena (even though I'm not particularly good XD ) and City of Heroes Homecoming.
---
Blizzard will definitely not keep phase 1 on for 6 months lol  ... 6 months without a PvP system will kill classic.
---
As of now there will be no sharding or dynamic respawns.
---
I'm sure a server today could handle 3k people in one spot, not sure on the client side though.
---
This is incredible. I’ve been slowly making my own BiS excel doc gathering info from plenty of other places and what you have here is something that’s better than I could have ever hoped to create! 
---
I’ll be using this a lot, thank you for this
---
the socioeconomically underprivileged represent a minority of the population? alright buddy
---
Aww! Thanks, glad you'll get some use out of it.
---
Great info. Truly one of the finer aspects of min/maxing that is usually forgotten. 
---
Be sure to login during the holidays to get those sweet costumes to pimp out your bank as well!
---
Cannot wait , I've watched far to many classic vids! From streamers stress testing to recipe locations to pre raid bis ... And everything in between. 
---
Also plan on the night is get to level 20 .. but in realistic  terms get to level 10 and fight the tiredness
---
If you are melee who is raiding at level 60 you need sappers
---
I just hope I can win the fishing event without layer abuse :(
---
I'm constantly going back and forth between **Shaman** and **Hunter**.
---
I enjoy a healthy mix of wPvP, PvE, and solo play. Gotta get that grind in.
---
 I like soloing dungeons, which I'm aware Hunter does best.
---
I also greatly enjoy playing underutilized specs and min-maxing them as far as possible, purely for the fun aspect of it. (Read Enhancement or melee/spell hunter).
---
Vanilla veteran, so I know these classes pretty well. I have a good concept about end-game PvP and PvE, but I suppose I'm looking for nuances that I've missed.
---
I will obviously be rolling Tauren, beef supreme. 
---
(Yes I know about the melee leeway issues on the beta atm)
---
Any advice?
---
Thank you reddit. May the Earthmother smile upon you!
---
My brain is fine. If there is one realm language will be english. German speak english, italian too. There is absolutely no issue at all. Keep QQ, i like salt
---
They said it could last all of phase 1. Expect to see it for at least a few months.
---
The two black bars ruin everything.
---
How does the grind to 11 compare to 10 and 15?
---
I’m not planning on speed levelling so I’ll get involved when I can through the week but will gladly let everyone take off without me. I’ll have a few cold ones in the fridge ready to really start the grind properly from Friday 30th. Can’t wait!
---
I've done two private server launches and I'm pretty happy not doing it again tbh. Hopefully blizzard servers will be better anyway!
---
Massive props to you on not touching the orb.   
---
Let me tip my hat to you fellow player - your story and presence honors us.
---
oh sorry if my writing was missleading, i was talking hypothetically. english isnt my first languange. i dont know what server they meant :)
---
This was true on private servers because the dungeon elites were pretty over-tuned. However on beta it's not impossible to pull large groups of elites and cleave / aoe them down.
---
Also paladin should have concentration for a few extra ticks of dmg . I saw a guide like this where it's where you would make spell clear groups or melee cleave but never mixing melee with casters and just aoe pulling full rooms. Would be interesting to see the results on a private server just to see how the first dungeons go get a route and a idea of how many to pull etc
---
My group is doing it.
---
Warrior, warrior, shaman, hunter, priest.
---
Oh yes, loved that video. &lt;3
---
Rewatched it quite a few times back in the day.
---
Get it to level 35, you can max out professions for those valueable cooldowns (transmutes etc)
---
\+ You'll be able to upgrade it with the Tuxedo gear and a monocle (last one requires engineering tho)
---
Sorry, I'm not going to make an account on your website just to submit my secrets, I answered and gave feedback, that should be enough to get things moving in the right direction.
---
I use my guides for myself, not for others, I'm not a community guy at heart, I just wanted to voice my opinion when people post false information and half-ass low effort guides. (Which is basicly a copy paste of all known private server methods of making gold)
---
Please check your information next time.
---
Have a nice day.
---
You make it sound like hunter/lock are the only solo classes, which isn't true really.
---
The guy wanted to know which classes can function without having to rely much on outside help, most classes fit in that description.
---
I would've agreed with you had he asked which classes are the fastest levelers but that wasn't his question.
---
Also had he asked which classes were the best at farming gold then that answer would also have changed ( mage/hunter/druid and in some cases locks).
---
Finally, there's no class that does great without gear, even hunters. A hunter with quest gear won't stand a candle next to a hunter in any raid tier gear, the same concept applies to any class.
---
When talking about scaling people tend to refer to dps meters but it doesn't necessarily mean classes that don't scale as well are going to end up being bad in the final stages of the game, especially when we're considering wpvp.
---
Hydramist but he's alliance and already 40
---
Technically, he is right. Auction Houses weren't linked until patch 1.9, so when you posted an auction in Stormwind, it would only show in Stormwind.
---
This means, until patch 1.9, it essentially was one auction house in Ironforge and one in Orgrimmar as the others weren't used at all, except by bank alts sniping items cheaply from unsuspecting players.
---
Of course. Any talented players will be turned off by having a guild leader who is playing a meme spec.  A raid full of bad players like yourself will be sloppy and not last long.
---
Do you plan on using nightfall or do you want to use a 2her with higher dps?
---
Thank you ❤️
---
Agree with the others, read the novels. They're awesome!
---
Yes I'm sure lol
---
Thank you so much for your good wishes. I know he’s out there ❤️
---
I was so desperate last night that I installed Diablo 3. *shudders*
---
'Underutilized specs' is a wrench you've thrown into the machine there. I was about to recommend hunter to you but they need to minmax to get into raids as a rule of thumb, so maybe shaman is better for you anyway, as popular as that class is. Both classes are very popular fwiw.
---
Multiboxing is cheating now, huh?
---
Ok cool good to know thanks
---
I like Freshprince.
---
I'd say with that name especially, this must be some wierd form of trolling.
---
You underestimate the slowness of casuals, that takes 20 days+ played to get to 60, not everyone is hardcore, most of the playerbase wont be.
---
/script UseContainerItem(x, y)
---
/script PickupInventoryItem(16)/(17)
---
Arguably you could also level a rogue bank alt to 10 for Sprint for even more movement speed.
---
They’re making adjustments to it basically every day on the beta. We do all need to relax and give the classic dev team some credit for the fixes they have made and how they have responded to the community proactively... 
---
I think a portion of this subreddit just needs something to bitch about perpetually and don’t understand that a part of a beta is ironing out these issues...
---
But he regularly speedrun to 30 , well he is at his fourth run already not sure if he does another one.
---
I mean, we could 100% deal with GM's speaking english, that would be easier to understand than having to do EVERYTHING in english just for that reason... hope they come around
---
Except me
---
Sounds like you're looking at it the same playstyle from different perspectives, rogues shine more in solo situations and warriors are group kings.
---
Just decide whether you prefer group or solo content more.
---
Btw even if you don't get a MT spot as warrior you will still have to off tank as fury from time to time on some occasions, so you'll still get a chance to tank.
---
You're not understanding,  they are changing the game based on internal metrics,  not a small minority
---
If you haven't played since retail vanilla then you don't know what you are talking about...
---
Enhancement shaman is like having a player /follow you through the entire raid...
---
That's why you always bring two
---
It's most likely the satisfaction of knowing that you're the real backbone of your raid. Healers are underrated maybe but as a solid healer everyone will 100% be craving your presence.
---
That's exactly what I'd do, have a suggested language on certain additional servers, that would do the trick...
---
Wouldn't a paladin tank be a better choice? Paladins are after all the best aoe tanks.
---
One of the best wow machinima back in the day
---
The french. It's always the french.
---
Except druids aren't weak on private server?  Do any of you people actually even play druids?
---
It is classic wow content, what doesn't it have to do with it?
---
https://www.elsanglinreborn.com/
---
El's Extreme Anglin' was excellent for me learning where to fish prior to its shutdown. So happy they ate relaunching their website@
---
&gt;Part of me doesn't like that they are 'improving' layering as it's something that's allegedly only going to be in the game for a couple weeks. 
---
Why would you think that? They have said it could last all of phase 1. Expect to see it for a few months at least.
---
I haven’t watched a streamer or “content maker” in quite a while. I watched this video and formed an opinion all by myself!  Melee leeway is pretty dumb and so is spell batching.
---
I got that reference.
---
I would spend 35 minutes on it and then just give up.
---
Blizzard would then  hotfix it; so it only requires 4 in a row.
---
I wouldn’t wish that fate for anyone.
---
No it's not gone. I can tell you about our first guild Argus the Unmaker Heroic clear.   
---
We were two players left. I was tanking as DH. I used everything I have to survive long enough for our hunter to finish the job. He eventually died first (too many large aoes) and I lived just long enough to deliver the killing blow. Like one tick away from dying myself.  
---
Reminded me of a similar thing happening on Heroic LK the first time we killed it. I was the last man alive in a group. Mage. We had spent the evening trying. First Sindragosa was a pain (but it wasn't the \*first time\* we cleared her on heroic) then LK. When I saw how many HP he had left I used one item I had kept for such an occasion on my mage. Not keybound, but in my action bar. Ready for whenever I could pull off a big heist with it. A level 20-ish quest reward from Ashenvale. Something called Tears/Light of Elune can't really remember.   
---
Just google it for ya folks - that potion right there : [https://fr.wowhead.com/item=5816/lumi%C3%A8re-d%C3%A9lune#english-comments](https://fr.wowhead.com/item=5816/lumi%C3%A8re-d%C3%A9lune#english-comments)  
---
I popped every offensive cooldown I had left (Arcane Power for sure, I had Mirror Image as well (I had a benefit IIRC from having those around), trinkets ...) And I arcane Blasted LK into his insta kill phase like a madman.  
---
LK dropped the One hander spell power sword - Bloodsurge, Kel'Thuzad's Agony of something like that.   
---
I was just straight up given the sword without rolling for it. No caster said anything just that it was well deserved.   
---
Rarely felt so proud in a video game. I think it actually was peak pride right there.
---
People were abusing layering to level up extremely fast (ex : mages aoe farming the same mobs over &amp; over), so the XP CD is probably to try and control the exploits with leveling. People were flying through levels exploiting layering, which isn't good. Bad.
---
Basically about the same here lol. 2 kids, was getting to the point where I was thinking of putting the keyboard down, and Bam. Stoked.
---
Nah. The whole reason he rebelled was cause greymane left the alliance. He rebelled cause he wanted gilnaens to help lorderon against the undead.
---
My point is why do these specs even exist if they don't work in raids. Feral/Bear is one of my favorite classes but in raids due to CB they are practically worthless. There are other specs that suffer similar problems.
---
What is wrong with addressing these issues in a way that doesn't ruin other classes, or raiding?
---
Working out will help support longer sessions. Sleep 6-8. Workout 1-2. Play 14-17
---
Get outta here and go gatekeep something else
---
Most people idea of lvling war is with some trash green wep full fury spec single kill mob and eat every pull. If you get the important weapons and go for 2-3 mob pulls war is waaaaay faster than rog.
---
So I am in the same boat but I fully expect problems at launch. So I’ll work 27-30, play in the evenings, then play all weekend and take leave Sep 2-6 and have that whole next weekend. It will give the problems time to get fixed and I’ll be right behind the power curve so questing should be a bit easier.
---
and farm some gold...
---
Here without you reminds me so much of Tirisfal Glades
---
I'm kind of disappointed you're the only one that understood
---
That 8.3hrs till 43 though...
---
That could work! But blizzard always has (or at least HAD) a huge tradition of superb customer service (which not always worked out of course). 
---
Classic and Retail for that matter are not korean-free-to-play-pay-to-win MMOs but buy-to-play and subscription based  – at least in the past and in the case of Retail.
---
So the demand (and the claim on blizzards side) for a well-oiled and working customer service in the specific language is totally justified.
---
I think Blizzard is very cautious about the expected subscriber base of Classic and its long term success. And probably rightfully so. Blizzard is not in a good place financially as far as we know, we should'nt forget that.
---
i dont think i have ever seen a rogue female troll in my life.
---
they look amazing
---
During vanilla someone made a wow-video to 'Here without you' (3 Doors Down). The plaguelands are forever linked to that song in my head.
---
Depends on the server. I wasn't allowed to play games during the weekdays when I was a child so all I did on weekends were bgs. Then when summer came around it was bgs all day for a month or two.
---
One of my siblings was caught skipping school in the early 200s because she took film to be developed at the local Walgreens and when our parents went to pick up their photos the cashier also gave them my siblings phot pack
---
Hydramist, Healingstat, Kalaa, Toez and Claak are good priests streaming Classic on  twitch.
---
I have no idea what you are on about. So uh.... Yikes?
---
That sub looks like a joke circlejerk of asking release dates, it hurts my eyes
---
Shu the fuck up! I'm going to play as an affliction warlock and I don't want to extend the debff limits.
---
You want to preserve playstyle but completely ruin the class balance? What?
---
Classic should be Vanilla recreated and not some monstrosity where balance druids are doing good dps.

But what does it mean really "international server"? Quite frankly if I wanted to speak my own language I'd rather go in a dedicated server. To me an international server is a place in which people who speak different languages want to meet at a crossroad and find some middle ground.
---
Can I hire you to narrate my daily life decision making  
---
I'll probably end up spending 9 hours at the supermarket each time though
---
So far it seems there are a lot more alliance players than horde.
---

---
I seriously hope more people roll horde, it would suck if that sample turns out to be a proper reflection of how classic is.
---
There's a CD anytime you gain XP, so you will have to wait to join groups almost always if I'm reading all this correctly. Joining groups will be a no go basically always unless you AFK for the CD to go away and all party members. They had to add the CD to XP because people were abusing layering to power level basically. With every fix, there's a new problem.
---
If i cant log in on the 27th then no big deal, just means i can still rest from working crazy hours. Win/win for me!
---
Oof that pun hurt a little. But yes. &lt;3
---
Good post. Id like to take steaming up as a hobby, and get into making videos too. I’ve played vanilla since I was a kid, and off and on with private servers because it’s the only version I care about. To me it would just be a new intriguing way to experience the game. 
---
I work as a rancher, and have crazy hours, so there is not a lot of time at the moment, or good enough internet to stream on te hot spot I’m currently using, but in the next few months something may change!
---
Balance is not fun. This has been confirmed by BFA. Every class needs to have something that the others don't and be good in other areas and feel overpowered in some way or another.
---
Thank you, I can't post on the forums (have'nt played Retail in years) but I totally agree. This decision is just baffling.
---
reddit overdose
---
&gt; Hold on are you really suggesting there arent enough French people to populate ONE PvE server and ONE PvP server?! (Or for any other language?)
---
I don't know, fill a server to its 5k capacity after 12 months? Who knows. And then there's RP and RP-PvP too.
---
&gt;Nobody want's to be that one English speaking guy who has joined a bunch of French guildmates advertising in trade looking for a tank for their dungeon. Theyre all chatting away in /p and you have no clue what is happening. You subconsciously assume they are talking trash about you and your tanking skills because you cant understand. You feel completely excluded, and it just isnt fun at all.
---
Or maybe you don't have crippling self-doubt and can live through one dungeon without chatting. ;)
---
&gt;This is an MMO. Not just any MMO but one that has been specifically recreated because of it's sense of community. Being able to properly communicate is vital, otherwise what is the point of playing classic, because retail does what you are describing, (grouping and never talking to anyone) much better.
---
True that though.
---
There is a song called Gravedigging by The Classic Crime that specifically reminds me of killing (what I think were) gnolls, just north of Brill? Oddly specific but just remembered that as you mentioned TG.
---
Why would you spend a name reservation on a bank alt?
---
Yeah, but if you actually care about winning, you should be horde.
---
here in the UK they are roughly 1 in 5 people, so yeah a minority
---
Yes a lot of people love to criticize in a race to be the edgiest and meanest.
---
Don't edit the post to explain it. Let those who don't get it simply be wrong.
---
...? There are so many specs that can't raid... Why is Affliction special?
---
&gt;The shortcut doesn't get added til naxx patch iirc.
---
Was that in actual vanilla, or just pservers though?
---
Yes, because it will most likely ruin our last chance at a fresh launch of the official Blizzard servers for the lifespan of the server. Layering, bad. Bad.
---
I mean, we'll still have to face english speaking GM's no matter where we are, so this superb customer service is even worse because now they officially ignore 35% of the playerbase in that regard, which is kinda sick. Speaking with a GM, it's easier to go for google translate cause it's opening a ticket and waiting for a response, it's alright to have english only there, not everywhere though...
---
The only faction that matters is the horde.
---
15y old bug clap
---
Yeah. That’s me for the first two weeks lol such is life!
---
Why does every class have three different specializations then, genius?
---
And balance does not equal homogenization. No one says the game should be GW2.
---
Feral druid can be made good in raids if you farm MCPs and learn how to powershift and obviously always have full world buffs and consumes. People have done Naxx progression with feral.
---
Otherwise I agree, raid with the useful spec, get gear, go PvP.
---
I would love to join all of you but my 8 year old laptop simply can't handle games anymore. I'm sad that ill miss reliving the vanilla experience like I did back in 05 as a Tauren Hunter named Jimmyl(my irl nickname at the time as I did not have an internet name) on the Azgalor pvp server. I hope it's an absolute blast for all of you.
---
It's starting to look like a triple titan panel! OMG OMG, WHAT DOES IT MEAN!?
---
Windfury is allegedly currently resetting the swing timer on BETA and there's a lot of conflicting info about whether or not it should be.
---
If it is, spamming hamstring can result in a DPS loss rather than gain depending on when within your swing you trigger a windfury.
---
So weird you should say that so early into the thread. 3 Doors Down are actually one of the bands that made me ask this question in the first place. They remind me specifically of the north barrens area where the harpies are in the corner. Must have been from questing with the album on!
---
Another aspect I didn't even touch on is:
---
"How much fun is the main-role to play?"
---
Different roles are fun for very different reasons.
---
What I enjoy about healing is resource-optimization. Juggling with the 5-second-rule, downranking, timing heals perfectly to avoid overheal. Mana-efficiency-optimization makes such a huge difference in how quickly the group can progress.
---
What I enjoy about tanking is situational awareness. Always keeping track of each mob. What mobs will likely be CCed so I shouldn't bother with them? What will the DPS most likely attack? Is every mob, where I want it to be? Am I facing them so the DPS don't have to go around? I'd say it's the most rewarding role in PvE.
---
DPSing, I have to say, is comparatively boring until things go wrong and you have to pull some tricks. But when this happens it's really a lot of fun.
---
But then again everything changes completely in PvP. A mage, for example, is extremly fun in PvP but probably the most boring in a dungeon-group. There's no tanking whatsoever in PvP. So Healer seems like a great compromise, because it is fun in PvE and PvP.
---
You forgot the most important part.
---
A proper Bank alt has to wear full Tuxedo apparel.
---
Rule 5, no orange man bad.
---
Maybe I'm remembering incorrectly, but isn't there ONLY auction houses in IF and Org in Classic?
---
Therefore distance to Stormwind/Thunderbluff is redundant.
---
This is so blandly horde propaganda to discredit our Lady Prestor.
---
Pupg. Nothing better than joining a chinese custom match and driving them over with a Jeep while saying "I'm so Solly" and "Konichiwa".
---
Question regarding the assumption that players will leave. What happens if they dont leave and we have a server with 30k players. Is that something that can come back and hit blizzard in the ass or will they have time to fix that by adding more servers and giving out transfers?
---
Really? That sounds really bad! Haven't played Retail in years, so I wouldn't really know. Blizzard is just on a downtrend for quite some time now, I think they just fired a lot of people who worked in Versailles, France. This was their main office for customer service in Europe, so here you go.
---
Hopefully we meet someday in Classic, on a real German Server! :) FOR THE HORDE!
---
As others said, being a leader of a good raiding guild is a safe bet, which I assume you aren’t going to be. The only other realistic option you have is to be a goblin on your server and make many thousands of gold so you can pay a guild to carry you through the quest chain. I know of at least 1 person who did this in vanilla!
---
Idk how much it would cost though. Somewhere between 40k and 100k I guess.
---
Thanks. Didnt realize that this was good for preventing dead servers 👍
---
Which is the point? I can't even imagine this would seriously be a problem for a lot of people. I don't know anyone who needs to leave and join parties over and over and over. Yes, I know you're gonna say that you do that all the time because how could anyone challenge it? But it's still not that black &amp; white. We don't know if the cooldown will for example scale the more you change layer. In rare instances it might affect gameplay, but you'll just have to deal with it because there is no perfect solution and spamming "just remove layering" isn't going to make that happen.
---
Thank you! Hope your situation changes so you can enjoy classic friend hopefully see you in August.
---
I havent played retail in quite a while so i dont understand references to Bfa. But thanks for trying!
---
**Everything** is worth streaming. There's a market for   
---
 absolutely everything - ex Once I got 8 followers and 7 consistent viewers in an hour just playing an emulated Castlevania SOTN from my phone, completely mute as android was blocking all audio recording. I couldn't see chat though, so i have no idea if they were talking.
---
Idk why none of the bank alt guides have this, it really speeds up the process. Also you could opt for I think level 20 for mage blink. Also makes auctions less boring.
---
Shadow priests or affliction lock perhaps
---
What about a 5th Priest with holy nova ? ( Heal+dmg )
---
Chainpoting is a thing you know ....
---
Thanks for the 2H Maces catch there, I will update the sheet.  
---
The icicle rod was chosen because it has a higher overall DPS, not just damage range, than other options for its level. I did not include the Executioner's Sword because it is a limited-quantity vendor item, so you cannot guarantee it will be on the vendor. I also has a 1.42g vendor price, and the Icicle Rod is free. The guide I created is not a hard and fast "you must take this". For most experienced warriors, I would think of it as a "worst-case scenario" for what your weapon will be for any given level. Personally I tend to heavily invest in social aspects of the game while leveling warrior so my gear is mostly Blues, but I recognize not all players enjoy leveling in that manner.  
---
Weapon DPS is weapon DPS. I could see the argument for flurry procs etc, but at that level it's a moot point. It's a myth that faster weapons provide higher DPS, all other things equal, in a slower environment. In fact due to the nature of first attack being instant and hamstring kiting reducing incoming damage slower weapons do have an advantage. Especially with point-to-point grinding, which you see used at the higher levels of warrior play when leveling quickly.
---
Before 1.12 yes. I'm not sure what patch it was but in its 'finished form' disenchanting did indeed require you level enchanting
---
You could do it once if it's on GCD? They definitely fixed the griefing aspect of it.
---
True but since Im gonna lvl an alt anyway just to explore another class slowly I thought a Hunter or a Mage would fit for that purpose.  
---
I farmed on my rogue back in vanilla but having 2 or more additional professions seems like a great way of earning some extra gold and try something different.
---
What about a 5th player Priest with holy nova ? ( Heal+ dmg )
---
Live to win and Elwynn Forest boar slaughter.
---
Not worried a bit. It'll be more important to see how that pans on per server, as opposed to a whole. Same as back in 2004-2006. The queue times may just be longer for Alliance haha.
---
&gt; Actually I don't, I don't play games in swedish
---
thats the exact opposite of what you said earlier. you speak swedish in your past time activities aswell as when you play online with your friends.  
---
which means, given the chance, you prefer your mother tongue over english.
---
this isn't really that hard to grasp, really.
---
I have yet to hear a valid reason why it would be detrimental to the game if everyone was allowed to communicate in their prefered language.  
---
we had this 2005 and it was fine, we can have this in 2019 with no issue as well.
---
I saved up gold little by little, transfered gold my alts to pay for epic mount, and I joined a mc starting raid guild and didn't use gold on consumes in raid which is ok for MC.
---
They're both great classes. I think make the decision based on the non-dps parts, or the RP aspect. They're both good at dps.
---
I think tanking is a lot of fun. It's nice to have the option to do that.
---
Warriors are great in group pvp. Rogues are great in world pvp and duels. Warriors give you the feeling of a fearless berzerker -- taking damage gives you more rage that you can use to kill people. Rogues are more thoughtful -- you learn your combos, you have a little time to think about your next move while the guy is stunned, etc.
---
One of my favorite memories is stealthing into the ironforge bank to ambush low-health paladins after they bubble-hearth and stalk people in the less-traveled areas. 
---
One of my other favorite memories is breaking the alliance lines in AV with recklessness and fear and whirlwinds and cleaves and sweeping strikes, pushing them all the way up to the bridge. (There must have been three guys healing me, it was ridiculous.)
---
This example is great and just a sign of the bigger problem underneath. Whenever I played any other free- or buy-to-play MMOs (BDO or B&amp;S or Tera, yeah I know :) ) there was no real mix-up between the different language groups. These servers always felt small by comparison. 
---
It's just natural for people in Europe to stay with their own language and their own community.
---
I can't say this enough, but I'm really really irritated by this decision.
---
In my top 1 or 2, for sure. The guy who made this was between jobs and out a tremendous amount of time &amp; attention to getting it right. As far as I know, this video is the only example of his work in WoW machinima.
---
I take it this is on the beta?
---
There’s too many factors at play skewing people faction choice on beta to draw any serious conclusions from it. Like popular streamers doing big events more often on alliance. Also since the beta is very much temporary people don’t care too much what faction they play on. 
---
IMO that huge survey this subreddit had a while back is a better indicator of what live will be like and it had an almost perfect 50/50 faction split.
---
Everyone I know plans to roll alliance but that's just my circle.
---
Vanilla horde just wasn't that appealing to most people baring some hard core pvpers.
---
That's why I take 3 weeks off, just to be sure.
---
(and said no to a friends offer for a week holiday on a sailboat in Greece..."meh, I can do that next year...Classic wow is a once in a lifetime thig")
---
Are also gonna freeze yourself end up on future?
---
Then there really is no winning. If they don't work on layering at all people will scream and complain about how it's exploitable. If they work on layering it's apparently a sign it's here to stay permanently. Did it ever occur to you that they're working on both of those things? They didn't even announce they're working on layering, this is simply something people noticed.
---
If you do close your simple macro with a semi colon, which is good practice to get into the habit of because it will usually be a missing semi colon that breaks a more complex macro, you will need to add an empty bracket for the macro to work.  
---
You can either do this:
---
    /cast Sinister Strike(Rank 1)
---
Or this:
---
That said, the example was just to show how to do a macro with a spell rank. You would actually never make a macro like this unless you just wanted a different icon for the ability or something.
---
Um reaching 200 mp5 on sham makes you a God among raiders, it's not just numbers its sustaining 40 people on 10 min boss fights. You wont realize how 90% of fights fall on the healers shoulders until you heal.
---
Btw, i'm searching for an image that was at the bottom of promotional cards for wow in wc3 best seller where we saw a hanging bridge near a cliff. I'd be glad if someone knew how to find it :)
---
Dont remember it completely, also it might have been TBC  but there was a love triangle between one ally hunter (scuba Steve) and some horde girl and her new horde boyfriend after the girl and scuba Steve broke up. 
---
They organized a wedding at the rogue place in hilsbrad. And scuba Steve was a guest of honor. 
---
Scuba Steve was on vent with an our entire ~80 man alliance raid. The wedding had security st the front gate but somehow we snuck a warlock psssed them and hid in the mountains to summon everyone.   The entire wedding was full Rp mode with tuxedos and shit 
---
Scuba Steve timed it so we arrived right as they said „is there any objections?“ 
---
We stormed the castle and murderd everyone.. 
---
Scuba Steve then opened his mic on vent and we heard the girl screaming at him over his phone haha 
---
I think there is even a YouTube video. I’d have to find it!
---
I'll just go on the Fortnite subreddit and tell them how I'll NOT be playing Fortnite, that way I will also be a rebel.
---
That’s not how queues work...
---
I will not rush either, but will still be in front of the curve due to playing at least 10h a day for a week. 
---
And this time level all my 2nd profs while leveling.
---
Yes, it's about choice. In Vanilla you always had the opportunity to choose on what kind of Server you wanted to play on. A thing that was never really realized in other MMOs.
---
Hey there!
---
[We are a EU based guild](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c4kraw/looking_for_group_monday_june_24_2019/erx2us0/) and we're actually quite open for people right now. We are english-speaking, laid-back (but serious about raiding) and friendly. We won't be pushing any kind of no-life or hardcore, and expect our raids to start a few months after launch (instead of week 2 etc). We will be raiding Wednesday, Friday and Sunday 21:30-23:30 EU server time. Check us out &amp; give me a shout if you have any questions or are interested! :D
---
I can actually feel the "Happy" from that shot! Then you realize you still dont have enough gold for a mount :(
---
It's great if you're in group pvp with your friends. 5 on 5 in felwood or something like that ... the team with a good healer will win 100% of the time, often without even losing any guys. And that's all because of you.
---
You might also have a chance to gear up your shadow damage set or something, I guess. But I think if you are not interested in support, maybe it's not for you.
---
Theoretically, not technically, as we get 1.12. But yeah #nochanges from what state?
---
You would want to grind max reps @ vanilla. I attempted that back, it didn’t worth it! It’s a huge time sink with little to no rewards. Focus on rep grinds that give you something (like the frostsaber tiger)
---
Totally agree!
---
Haha! Yeah, finding the ideal food when it comes to weighing their nutritional value against their taste is an equally difficult process!
---
Especially if you take price, whether you currently prefer something sweet or something hearty, packaging waste, how long it takes before it goes bad, how well it fits into your bag, caloric density and other apsects into consideration.
---
For example I recently bought a water-melon because it seemed pretty good in most important aspects. Like no plastics, decent price per-kilogram, very refreshing considering the whether. However, I did not consider that I'll be left with an unedible shell that needs to be disposed within a relatively short timeframe before it turns into an disgusting moldy goo.
---
Obligatory "[Creedence Clearwater Revival - Fortunate Son](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWijx_AgPiA)" for STVietnam comment.
---
Look at pops for level 40s only. 50/50
---
Exact the opposite for my friend group.
---
Still is now, nobody plays alliance.... im a human IRL, so i dont have the need to play some human thingy in a game...
---
thanks Hakurai :P
---
I'm getting goosebumps just watching this. Can't to feel the pain of STV.
---
Vanilla didnt have it, so im assuming Classic wont have it either.
---
Also its not in the beta
---
ehm... eh... TBC is the one we should get... Also please don't kill me guys :(
---
if you are a min maxer and will play Pala, then you will be a healer, right ?
---
Oh right. They're cross realm. I forget. Doh.
---
Most will use discord I'm guessing.
---
they don't add choice, all they do is make every possible choice you have equally bad.
---
\*Quickly tries to reserve all the well known streamer names on my server just so they won't roll there\*
---
Yea I don’t know. I just wanna play the character I always wanted to play when I was like 13 years old.
---
That's so true... and sad at the same time.
---
 I do enjoy wrenches in my machines! Maybe I just have a screw loose.
---
I don't really worry much about getting into raids. I can be the Nightfall bot. And hell if that doesn't work I'm just a respec away from being "viable". 
---
Raid attendance, reliability and overall dedication to the guild tends to be weigh more than we like to give it credit for.
---
Hopefully we'll see less of a min-max attitude in at least the early stages of Classic than what we've all encountered on private servers.
---
I mostly thought "you guys must be pretty bored" :^)
---
Yeah, I think kalaa puts his stuff up on YouTube. Would be a really good place to learn
---
In vanilla, every major city had an auction house. They were not linked until patch 1.9, but as we get 1.12, this isn't a problem anymore. 
---
Except you want to sell items through the chat. In this case, IF/Org is first choice.
---
Imagine being that person that has a layer all for himself because all layers are full and you are just the one maxxing the layers + 1.
---
its an "international" server, not an english one.  
---
we are free to flood it with sauer kraut as much as we want. deal with it, I like salt.
---
I haven't done the math for rogue. The reason is that I see it as quite low in many of the aspects that are most important for me.
---
For PvP, however, they sound rather appealing. But I really prefer having fun in all aspects.
---
But rest assured, that if I'd roll a rogue, it definitely would be a Gnome.
---
&gt;Naturally, the married couple got divorced after that mess, and rather than living alone the wife started dating and eventually marrying the creepy dude.
---
That's some M. Night Shamalangadingdong plot twist right there.
---
so you are not a min maxer ? :)
---
Yeah, and it's also totally ... unimmersive ...
---
This may sound weird, but esspecially on RP-Servers even the Tradechat was in character most of the time.
---
Hearing different languages all aorund ... I just don't get it.
---
No I’m not.
---
Generally it's a good rule of thumb to actually read posts before replying.
---
MC will definitely not be easy if your dps can't control threat, or your tank threat is low. They're easy on private servers because most people outgear it by the time they get there, as the hardcore has done it many times before and know exactly how much gear they need. But considering the hardcore population is a few thousands at max, and a lot of people will be playing, the amount of first timers will make MC far harder this time around I think.
---
It'll still be just as easy for most hardcore guilds that have been playing private servers, but your average guild will be having a though time for a few weeks to clear it.
---
 I fear for the DDoS... I don't even want to put this in the air, but I'm scared so I'm passing it along (scumbag). I took off 3 days from my old man grown up job, which NEVER happens. I'm going to be pretty upset if we have a rough launch, but I want to be a part of it! Unfortunately DDoS attacks are a real thing for launches.
---
Voice chat is integrated into battle.net, which will be a feature in Classic WoW, so I can only assume it will be there.
---
Got rank 11
---
Same reason you would spend a name reservation on a main, your going to spend a lot of time on your bank alt buying, selling, trading, and using the AH, might as well have a good name for them.  Plus, later in a servers life I tend to mess around on my bank as well (either 3rd alt or lvl 1 think what have you).  To each their own, but I tend to notice people with plain bank alt names tend to have pretty unoriginal/dumb names for their main, but that’s just my opinion... I’ll see you out there, Xxlegolasxx.
---
my eyes and brain are hurting after reading this
---
Hey, that's pretty cool.
---
Love your content man.
---
I hope you're right on them getting fixed. Especially the melee extension/leeway shenanigans.
---
I used to bait people to get flagged in the room. 
---
Run into ironforge by yourself...yell to get attention...get chased into the tram room where you have a group of guys camped at the portal entrance...
---
sorry, but it's closer to 30% 
---
https://www.jrf.org.uk/data?f%5B0%5D=field_taxonomy_poverty_indicator%3A867
---
suggest invite removed? Does that also mean request to join? That was a pretty nice feature.
---
That's totally true. As I said in another comment, even the tradechat was "in character" on some servers.
---
arcane crystals were high on my server so just farmed it for good money, around naxx patch chinese farmers showed up and arcanes price plummeted, so i just took herbalism too and did the same routes if needed. you could farm any needed items though, even low level cloth sold well when people profession leveled alts and couldnt be bothered to farm anything themselves.
---
Thank god I'm not the only one still in debt (though I know for a fact that the person I lend it from will return for classic). But afaik I only have 20g left on my debt.
---
Lucky priest.
---
No one to compete for cloth unless the Shaman goes ele.
---
I think I used AutoHotKey back in the day but there are probably more options out there now with better features
---
Just use Discord for voice Chat as @Trichechus08 said.  
---
[link to Discord](https://discordapp.com/)
---
If Blizzard continues with this plan, here's a tip:
---
Play close attention to the various foreign forums and check which servers they designate as 'unofficial &lt;insert country&gt; server'. I'm sure those topics will pop up in the Blizzard FR and DE forums and on fansites there.
---
I could have sworn that wasnt the case.. :/
---
Ally op. Better buffs and flightpaths may not sound like a huge deal but its huge for raiders. Less chance of losing world buffs, dont have to worry about totem ranges, fear ward. Ugh. Filthy alliance. Horde always underdog.
---
Still a better love story than Twilight
---
A lot of these are spell power and healing, right? Would this also make your mend pet much better off too?
---
I wonder if a BM + Arcane Shot PvP build would be viable?
---
Should be, imo
---
Have blizz talked about it specifically for classic? 
---
I assume you'll be able to chat with your b.net friends but I highly doubt that it'll be integrated into classic wow UI at all in order to preserve the vanilla experience.
---
The mail has been buffed significantly in the beta. You can now mail up to 12 items at a time per letter, which makes mail storage many times easier.
---
It is in the beta. (It was 2 weeks ago)
---
21% of the population in a developed country isn't a big success
---
calling it a minority because it's below the mean, okay sure. 
---
even if it's minority (or 21% of the population) they're still significantly likelier to commit suicide. this isn't an unknown science. people whose circumstances have been altered greatly for whatever reason and are at financial risk have always represented a significant percentage of total suicides
---
We once had a player win against at least 10 other players with a 16. That was hilarious.
---
Married, full time job (12 hours per day), no weekends... I must find some time for wow classic
---
maybe that was his real reason to post the screenshot. To boast about that ;-)
---
Yeah, I honestly hope it ends up 50/50.
---
Spell batching would have little or no impact on the scenario you mentioned.
---
Why did you include the av realm? The post from the pvp and pve beta the other day was almost exactly 50%
---
Exch-dee BFA bad gimme upvotes
---
You don’t have to login is a lie; if your name was used by someone who had it and deleted the character, I believe you won’t receive any mail until you login at least once. Unless they changed how it works.
---
I was gonna ask who Carman is, I thought I’m out of the loop
---
I knew a tank that wiped a raid after an achievement popped up, he told us "He couldn't click taunt".
---
He was the GM.
---
thank you a ton for this valueable information. :)
---
What happens when those leveling hit 40 then ? it'll happen eventually :p
---
If that is the case then you literally just proved my point
---
It’s not about nostalgia for me. It’s about gameplay and community. Classic is a better and more enjoyable game than current retail wow and it has nothing to with graphics. 
---
I personally don’t care if they do or don’t add an option for the new models but to say the whole point of classic is for the nostalgia is crazy man.
---

Back then my friend who was an alliance player on Magtheridon use to go on his Horde warrior just to gank every alliance player he saw. I think he ended up grinding High Warlord with a group.
---
This was back when he was still in school and he use to skip classes to gank the shit out of people. Apparently he did it so often that he became well known on his server as the Orc every alliance player probably got ganked by once.
---
Only problem I had on my high pop / full realm was the initial chamber with Magni being shit up for the first 20-30 mins. After that it was smooth.
---
Yeah even if you drop it to 20, which would be above the levels stress testers could get, it still only provides a 55/45 split in favor of the alliance. And honestly that doesn't surprise me much since I seem to remember hoard almost always being slightly outnumbered until TBC when they gave them a "pretty" race. Some people just won't play the "ugly" races.
---
I didn't ?:o
---
I only added the pve and pvp realms that are capped at 40 , feel free to filter them as you see fit though.
---
Good memories. I won't be going through that again though.
---
The only problem I see is that you'll have basically 3 cloth wearers, as the Holy pally will probably be wearing mostly cloth as a healer, but if you really are gonna run each dungeon 10-20 times then that might not matter as much anyway, but your party will gear up a lot more slowly than if you switched one of your clothies for a healer and let your pally either tank or dps.
---
That is a real bummer. I wish the scaling with spell power was better. :T
---
Although I can compare ridiculous stacking like this, and a more normal layout of gear for a hunter... then compare different rotations (aimed and multi vs arcane and serpent) and of course include autoshots and bla bla bla do some pointless theorycraft that overall will just keep me busy for a day and probably not be worth it. :D Thanks again for your answers!
---
I always thought the GY run wasn’t so bad there, isn’t that why TM vs. SS was a thing before BGs?
---
Worked in beta, without logging in.
---
On PServers this might happen...
---
You left out the part where you cheat on him with the GM and Officers for loot then cause drama and the guild to disband.
---
Yes and while the spells may have good design intention your overlooking that actual power value on classes where not taken into consideration. Lets use druid and cyclone as the first example. Why is cyclone a better form of crownd control then both sheep and fear in PvP when they already have entangling roots. Not only this, But why is it the same cast time as sheep and fear. Two classes who are solely DPS and control.
---
If this was taken in consideration, cyclone should have been made minimally a 2 second cast time spell to compensate for how powerful it is, if not something higher like 2.5 seconds.
---
Lifebloom I refuse to even talk about but all other spells are worth mentioning.
---
Shadow Word death is technically a very good spell, however, shadow tree already has a lot of low cast time spells. Mind Flay, Mind blast, Shadow word pain. If you wanted to actually give diversity to shadow spec you could have a higher cast time cooldown nuke. 2.5 - 3 second cast nuke on a cooldown, this would allow cycleing with mind blast, Perhaps make it something that refreshes power word pain, can maybe proc spirit siphon/blackout talent. But a additional spell that is simply instant cast just promotes bouncing around and not finding a fixed location which feels VERY rewarding in classic WoW.
---
When you play classic wow you'll understand how good it feels to actually pin a person in the right position and then to pull off your combo of abilities, combat is slower so the execution feels better.
---
The whole reason I was pointing this out is because destruction warlocks are weak because they don't have instant cast spells like all other range classes. Incinirate is 2.5, shadow bolt is 3, shadow fury is a lowish cooldown low stun "near instant" but its nothing compared to what all other classes have.
---
Mobility in TBC became a huge thing, increasingly so because of two things. Pillars in arena and the death of world PvP. These two introductions in TBC along with faster cast spells around the board lead to a spiraling issue of problems.
---
I'm all for new spells but new doesn't need to mean faster
---
Is it even possible to stay at def cap without drak shield? I'm pretty sure the list ur looking at would be for a priv server where you could get away with 420 or even no def at all. The drillbore disk is a aoe placeholder until you get force reactive disk as far as I know.
---
it doesn't, it makes dead servers more likely because people are more encouraged to pick the same few servers everybody else is playing on even if the queues are longer
---
Am I crazy, or did the OP change? I must have replied to the wrong thread?
---
people are saying fishing tourney later phase and layering ends before phase 2, so layering and fishing tourney won't be live at same time.
---
No, I haven’t heard them mention it anywhere. But the bnet UI is already integrated into Classic WoW, which is where you’ll find the UI for voice chat, so I don’t see them removing that. I might be totally wrong though, would need a beta invite to tell for sure.
---
That name was probably never created/logged into. I didn’t play private servers, I did have a ton of alts back in vanilla, and I remember blizzard saying something about it.
---
Nothing wrong with Horde being the underdogs. Makes us cooler.
---
I have never used discord before. Is it software you download or browser based?
---
I like the idea of it being integrated into bnet. I assume this way it would not be hard to setup when you get a pick up group full of randoms
---
Use Discord.
---
What other shield gives FR? Thought this was bis FR set for a long time.
---
I also quit games, a bit more recently. I'm so hyped about this though. Nothing else would get me back into gaming. I decided I wouldn't play unless my fiance played with me, she said only if we had the time. Well I'll only have the time if I change from evening shift to the day shift. And that's what I aim to do lol. WoW classic one of the main reasons why I'm shifts.
---
It's a bitch back to the questing area since you basically get sent back and forth across the zone.
---
haha good shout but only 3 per account (not even realm). I'm rolling with two accounts tho K a 5 likely, for the first month or two.
---
Do most people just run the app on their phone and they it on their desk or something?
---
okay, then blizz might have changed it. at least for beta.
---
Can't you hop between layers?

Was playing Monster Hunter World until 3 weeks ago when the new Path of Exile league started.

I'd buy darkmoon cards, put them together and sell the deck. Made 50-100g per deck at its peak. Did that for a week and I bought my epic training. I didn't like the kodos, but I had exalted with Frostwolves at that time so I got the Frostwolf as my 1st and only epic mount in vanilla.
---
Its also im the live client (the last stress test)
---
Its a battle.net feature, so its integrated into the game as well as the social features.
---
I leveled both with a 2H, and as dual wield to 60.
---
And let me tell you, dual wielding wins by a mile.
---
The enemies die in a consistent, steady manner. You don't two hit anything, but you also never stand there not being able to do anything.
---
You always have rage to do things. 
---
It's just less frustrating overall

Hurt by Johnny Cash sums up my entire BG experience.
---
I wondered why people didnt mention tyrs hand more often, that was my main farming spot aswell.
---
Most Chinese farmers were there too, so it couldnt have been that bad, could it ?
---
Within context he was specifically talking about raw damage output.
---
If it sounds like I’m saying layering wouldn’t or won’t affect gameplay negatively, that’s not my point. I do see the value in having a community leveling and seeing the same people and I’m really excited to play a version of wow that does that.  I hope, if layering stays, that it’s made to be as subtle and impact players as little as possible. I hope menthil harbor guards exist 3x :)
---
I think you’re right about the knowledge of the single realm. It doesn’t bother me as much because I know I can still have those experiences and make friends in dungeons, regardless of layering, albeit less likely. This may be my own habits or bad Memory, but most people I remember grouping with for quests were always people I saw in the world anyway to kill limited spawns. Rarely did I see people lfg in general for anything but elite quests and dungeons . Sharding in BFA bothers me a lot more from it being prevalent and noticeably decreasing the volume of players you even get to see. From what I’m reading, that shouldn’t be the case in classic.
---
I’m still curious to know why you think dynamic spawns work better overall for gameplay as it exists on pservers. It certainly keeps the community together, but to me, it makes the world feel much more like a game than a world to have stuff respawn on top of you 3 seconds after you kill it. Since it seems like blizzard is going to keep the number of servers low, and they want to avoid server merges for the reason you mentioned above, they have to do something. It’s a trade off of layering, which hopefully the player will see very rarely, or overpopulating realms, which may ruin the game itself for a lot of people right off the bat. 
---
Again, not trying to dismiss anything you’re saying or how you feel about your gameplay experience and what you’re looking for in classic. Just thinking through the different views and what the impacts of each would be.
---
Back in Vanilla and TBC, my close buddy and I started grouping with this one NE druid all the time, on his friend list from a dungeon, and we all quested together and watched each others back in PvP.  Our group eventually joined a great guild and challenged quite a bit of content together, but we always remained a 3some by ensuring each of us was part of any dungeon run, or raid.   No one got left out.
---
When TBC was nearing its end and rumours of WoTLK was making the rounds, my close buddy and the NE Druid met IRL and started dating shortly after, we live in Canada and she in the US.   Fast forward to today, and they are happily married with 2 kids, still playing WoW together.   
---
Keep your head up, love is out there and in the game.   Great thing about meeting someone in WoW is they won't get mad if you want to stay up late all night playing LOL.
---
Background app on the desktop
---
Pairing a shaman with their paladin sounds like a great idea lol
---
Tier 1 has some decent retribution bonuses, but stat-wise you'll probably be better off pvping for the rank 10 set. You won't necessarily get your ass handed to you constantly, but one thing you should practice / git gud at is positioning and situational awareness. 
---
Just because you'll have a 2h hammer and plate won't mean that you'll be able to just lead a charge on the front lines -- make sure that you are using your resources to buff your groupmates, heal, stun hordies with Hammer of Justice, and lay the smackdown with SoC / hammer of wrath in group pvp situations. Even paladins in blue dungeon gear can turn the tide of a fight, so play smart and you'll be fine.
---
My mind's telling me Paladin, but my FRIENDS, MY FRIENDS, ARE TELLING ME HORDE.
---
If you're going to druid for more reasons than aoe that's definitely ok but druid is weaker than warrior for excessively large pulls (more than 1 traditional pack).
---
The very same.
---
I don't believe pools were in Vanilla. Weren't they added later?
---
No. Just type discord download into google and download it. Discord is basically this generations ventrillo, which it seems like you are familiar with. It is very easy to use and setup.
---
Felstriker offhand was so much fun as fury
---
Will 2H Fury or Arms be better for warrior leveling? I’ve settled on being a warrior (my main on retail has been a DK since WotLK and I’m pretending that my warrior will be my DK before dying and being raised by the Lich King) and I personally like 2H better than dual wielding (looks cooler imo and less competition for gear I feel). I’m leaning arms but I’ve never played a warrior pre-Cata. FYI this is not asking about what’s better in raids or PvP. I’m sure it’s going to take me a long time to get to 60 so I’ll cross that bridge when I get there plus I’ve never had a huge interest in PvPing, my main interest in WoW has always been questing with intermittent dungeons. I plan on keeping a one hander and shield in my bags in case I need to tank to get in a dungeon group for a specific reason. Thanks!

Hi, /u/justsomespecial

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c64y10/anyone_else_gets_goosebumps_just_thinking_about/).

After playing on a densely populated alliance server recently I wouldn't say it makes us cooler at all.\^\^
---
The best wpvp is when both sides are almost equal, else it's just a slaughter.
---
wow, how have i missed that.
---
But we talking about real ingame integrated voice chat ?
---
So not the voice chat within [B.net](https://B.net) ?
---
You want the improved threat skill, and last stand,  and imp shield block
---
you do realize that every single one of us knows you're asking for "optional" aka "client-side" aka "i wont see them" new models, right?
---
did you even watch the video? did you even read past "no" in my comment? dont go around talking about people that cant read if you arent willing to read.
---
and they will never remove it.
---
Uhoh, maybe wife will say goodbyes after september hits...
---
How?  Just because people gravitate towards easy stuff doesn't mean they call for it.

Same will be true of the classic community

addons were in vanilla

Wow I never made a bank alt before but the tip about enchanting means I'm definitely going to now.
---
/r/ComedyCemetery/
---
Isn't there supposed to be a "start up" time on Autoshot if you perform another non-ranged-attack action? Could be that.
---
It will be.  The game cannot work without it.
---
The whole area is a bitch. It's like horde's duskwood. Back and forth to the killing ground on the other side of the zone.
---
Flood as you want. Spam will be reported. Kiss.
---
Not having to deal with queues at launch. Not having to have multiple servers that end up becoming very low-populated. A better method than dynamic respawning which is easy to exploit.
---
Agreed there
---
Yeah, I'm not sure but it's been a week since that message, I remember when there were no shamans on the horde side.
---
Today it seems to have filled up since but I can't tell if the message is bugged or there's still more data to be collected , either way the horde would need at least 6k players to balance out, that's quite a lot.
---
Hahah I love at the end where you’re just like fk it. Take the Rez sickness and call it a night
---
Disc priest or H priest? H priest talents seem to be somewhat superior for healing and levelling. p.s are the early -15% stun/charm/silence and the -threat disc talents useful/essential for PvE?
---
Level up with a resto shaman so I can heal dungeons while I level, or could I mix resto/ele?
---
I'm going to go one or the other.
---
Sure if the bosses dont crit. This isnt gimp mode priv servers thou. The bosses will crit. You have 439 def? Eventually gonna get crit. Get crit? Pry ded. Tank ded and boss not tauntable? Raid ded. When you get good gear and have 6k hp unbuffed sure 10 def isnt that amazing you can survive a crit. In blues... 5k hp full raid buffs.. ya you better have 440 def.
---
And a monocle with a diamond cane!
---
Wow this is cringe.
---
Arms probably, but likely worth picking up crit nodes from fury. P.s. i like your warrior being your pre wotlk DK thematic.
---
20 sit-ups, 20 push-ups and 50 burpees... Or i could just scroll on my phone for a while... Might scroll on my phone for a while.

---
You can move the points to imp revenge or stun resist from the +armor if you feel survivability is a nonissue. Or move them into defiance is you need more threat. 
---
I always grab last stand just because of the number of times it’s saved a wipe.

The delay will stay.
---
I’m generally curious, are the amount of mods on your screen more than average or less than average to the typical wow player (who made it to 60) back then ?
---
Warrior.
---
You said you like tanking and you said that you'd even be up for maintanking.
---
As a rogue you will never have the chance to do so!
---
You also seem to overestimate how easy it is to farm with a rogue.
---
So according to what you wrote I'd say warrior is the more fitting choice for your preferences.
---
Don't know why you're getting downvoted. I'm doing the exact same thing.
---
I don't think they're going to address it ever because they're not going to remove it.  They know it's a big topic and don't want to draw any attention to it.
---
Is this not normal?
---
Cata has amazing 5 man dungeons, when Cata started I seriously thought that wow is back, but then MoP happened.
---
Ret Paladins are horrific. So...
---
Kala
---
Then how do we have levels up to 58?
---
All 5mans can be tanked in any spec easy fwiw. I guess ubrs is where that counts. Get that set of tanking gear at the ready!
---
Screen fades to black....
---
Could also level mage to 20 for the blink spell.
---
Ghost form can only be used outside.
---
Distance between the bank and the auction house in Orgrimmar is also short.
---
Undercity has the most auctioneers, 8 in total. There are 3 in Orgrimmar and 2 in Thunder Bluff. It also has the most bankers (4, opposed to 3 in Orgrimmar and Thunder Bluff respectively).
---
Send gold to your bank account so you're able to post auctions (which require deposit) and send stuff to your main (30c per item).
---
If you haven't taken the item from the mail on your bank alt and you need it on your main, you can press the return button and it won't charge you.
---
Enchant Boots - Minor Speed does not stack with Travel Form and Ghost Wolf.
---
The shaman enhancement tree has a talent Improved Ghost Wolf that decreases the cast time with 2 seconds (making it 1 second). Requires 5 points in enhancement talents.
---
Based on your responses here, it sounds like you'd like retail :D
---
Sounds awesome, got any screenshots of the opening?
---
Absolutely great!
---
This happened to me. I was so hyped, I went and played on a private server to experience the old days ( I started in vanilla ) and I could not get into it. I simply do not have the time like I use to. Playing on a private server reminded me truly how long it is going to take to level and gear, and now I’m afraid when classic comes out I just won’t have the patience / time needed to get anything done :(
---
This is oddly specific. Also I'm sorry.
---
"STVietnam" - The best description I have ever heard of the zone.
---
Yeah that'll come down to the guild, so no.way for me to say. GL!
---
Good healers are the bass players of the raid, only notice them when they aren’t there
---
As I respond to you now, I hold our office scissors. They're purple. At least they were for the first 6 years until someone told me last year that they're actually blue.
---
Why six? Five would be enough to get to imp. shieldblock and imp. revenge.
---
You already need 5/5 Shield spec. then I'd take 3/5 Anticipation, 2/2 imp. Bloodrage and then you can go for imp- shieldblock and imp. revenge. I'd definitely pick up last stand though, you'll then have exactly 15 points in protection
---
So inspirational! Thanks for sharing.
---
They don't really need "hype" they just need everyone to be aware that the release is at the end of August.  Only so much interest in watching players that are maxxed out at lvl 40 and honestly MMORPG are usually not the most interesting streams to watch.  So yeah ... I too have been off the hype train for a while but am waiting patiently instead.
---
Sending my wife and kid on a week long vacation since I’ll be “out of town for work”. Working in Azeroth and using sick days!!!
---
as you yourself perfectly demonstrated
---
Dude - you should post that video you made of the all rogue assassination team stealth farming LBRS for the Shadowcraft Shoulders.  That was hot fire
---
If anything I’m more hyped as we get closer. But I’ve played several private servers so I know exactly what I’m in for
---
It's very cool, can't wait to try it out. Now if only I could figure this out for leveling 1 - 59 haha
---
You get cast sequence, the newer mod paramus like [nostealth] and [stealth], and smaller qol mention is you get the #showtooltip all of these were not working on pservers or not in vanilla itself (like cast sequences were BC) so your options are pretty limitless.  
---
I say wait for something like GnomeSequencer or SuperMacro to get ported and grab all the massive ones you can bc you'll be able to automate basically anything that isn't telling if you're behind a mob really easily
---
Still, I kind of would hate to do some new zone that got smashed into the world 15 years later, rather than one of the zones in the original game. But I might feel like I *have* to because it’s more efficient and is a better use of my time. Same with some newer raids, that might be more efficient for getting gear, when I’d rather see groups doing the original ones.
---
You can use it on either the web or download the software. Most people I know use the software. They have a desktop and a mobile client. Great for staying in touch with all the communities you’re a part of. It’s also totally free.
---
The voice client will be in classic. It’s pretty decent quality. However, you’ll be hard pressed to find anyone that actually uses it in game. Most people have discord. The PUGs I’ve been a apart of usually hop in there to chat.
---
Well ya, if tank gets crit for 3/4 their hp then auto attacked b4 a heal goes off its gg. Tanks job is survive+aggro. That's why you gear the tanks up first. You improve their aggro while keeping mitigation and all the dps can do more damage.
---
You're right, I checked and it was introduced mid WotLK, not in Cata or its prepatch.
---
I won't try to convince you out of 31/5/15, but I would suggest you reconsider imp revenge. A 45% stun can be good, but its inherently anything but reliable and stunning a mob early on in a pull can be just as bad in terms of rage\threat gen.
---
I'd heavily suggest you go something like this instead: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LZZxfzoh
---
Last Stand is the obvious potential wipe saver for things like drakk - SW+LS will buy you a significant amount of time.
---
Defiance is almost a "must". If you go 3/3 revenge you can't get any points there. With my suggested spec you get 9%.
---
I don't think anticipation vs. toughness is as big a deal, there are merits to both.
---
Aesthetics was what drew me to Horde right away, I'm playing a *fantasy* game, get outta here with your humans.  I actually have no idea how anyone can stand playing a human (and by extension, Alliance) in a fantasy game.
---
"Eat your shit, it will surely turn out for the best; it's only a month of your playtime to get to max!"
---
Lmao...man..you’re videos are incredible!!
---
That’s not what people really mean when they say immersion. They’re not literally immersed into the world. It’s feeling like you’re part of this world that *functions* like a real world. If I’m talking to somebody who says “yeah I’m right here by the bank” and they’re not, that takes me out of feeling like I’m in a functioning game world full of other people.
---
The title was added in TBC I believe. Definitely wasn't in Vanilla, just the mount
---
You’re right man. Just go ahead and don’t play. You’ll save the rest of us some headache.
---
While I'm in the same boat as you, I don't think that they released the beta too early. If anything, it was the perfect time to do it. By doing so, they've become aware of numerous bugs and hopefully have been exposed to the drawbacks of layering. 
---
But yeah, I'm with you. I used to tune into the big streamers every day for multiple hours, but now I've basically stopped. That doesn't kill the hype for me, though - more so keeping me in check. I'm taking this time to play all of my other games that I'm going to completely ignore when classic launches.
---
Nah, the stress test brought back all the feels I had for the game and after those two days it left me feening for more. Do yourself a favor and stay off the sub for a few days/weeks. My hype knows no bounds!
---
Oh also are you going to stop for class quests? Druid, warlock, and paladin have a good amount of quests for their forms/demons/res and gear if you'd want it. It should be easy to do SFK for the pally, especially if you wanna do it a lot.
---
So I looked into it; 
---
We're both right and we're both wrong /u/Uwis. 
---
In Vanilla, only IF and Org had auction houses until the Gates of AQ patch, when every capital city got a linked AH.
---
The urge to play Classic is growing stronger by the minute.  
---
Sure its slower progress but thats the beauty of it...enjoy it and dont force it and you'll be happy.  
---
If the journey to lvl 60 take 6 or 60 /played doesnt really matter just enjoy the ride and make the most of it.
---
If you want to 'optimize' your leveling. Turn everything off and read the quests. Find it on your own. Feel the accomplishment. Go far not fast. Also if you want to just fly by everything and get things as quickly and easily as you can just play retail.
---
im more than excited to get to play but im not watching streamers run through SM 50 more times in the beta
---
Affli locks occasionally reapply Corruption if their raid setup allows for it and are otherwise busy spamming shadow bolt x infinity
---
Great write up thanks for taking the time to do it.
---
As someone who levelled a bit on a p server and was always getting full bags, can I ask what should I be sending to my bank alt? I guess I can use them as extra bag space as you said I can use the mailbox as a 60 day bag slot? Mail costs money though right so is there a minimum level of stuff or price of stuff I should send over? Should I just empty my bags every time I get to the mailbox?
---
Azeroth Auto Pilot was working fine for me during the stress test, so I'd assume it'll be good to go for Classic launch.
---
See that's what I was thinking to begin with, and that's where the 6th talent point comes in (you don't need it for imp revenge, but you can't not put it in Last Stand, once you already spent 2 points on imp Bloodrage) ;)
---
you took two things?!?
---
Awesome! Iirc it wasn't a thing early on in classic. That's a welcome QoL improvement
---
Even if it's there, no one will use it.  It's terrible.
---
Cooking is boss for the stamina upgrades if you have to eat food anyway
---
As a warrior, please buff me with AI too. Anything to help the weapon skill leveling is lovely.
---
What are the pimp items for wow classic bank alts?
---
Fashion is the real juice for the bank alts.
---
I think you posted in the wrong thread. :P
---
Enforce English is the the proper solution.  Blizzard already gives us sharding to stop realms dying after release, why would they slice realms even smaller with a language barrier. The game is ages 12+, by then you will have started learning english in school.
---
To be fair, I said I might play it eventually. Just not at release.
---
Reading/Seeing this actually makes me reconsider...
---
I would have preferred alliance for the prettier and funnier races. But I also don't want to wait in BG-queues. 
---
So seriously considering playing undead now. :o
---
Doing each dungeon once for the quests is faster than normal quest leveling (if you have a good group). Normal leveling by questing is faster than grinding dungeons.
---
I’m thinking of going with something similar to your build. In your case I would pick imp bloodrage 2/2, last stand 1/1 and toughness 3/5.
---
I don’t think anticipation is worth it over toughness because:
---
1 defense = 0,04% miss, dodge &amp; parry ~ 0,12 total. 
---
Meaning 6 defense would only give you an extra 0,24% chance to dodge, a 0,24% increased chance to be missed and 0,24% chance to parry. Combined: 0,72% mitigation, while toughness gives 6% armor.
---
i think tis is skewed cause of Asmon's pets
---
The beta is not for hype, it’s to fix the colossal amount of bugs. Your hype would’ve died down on week 1 of Classic release anyway so it really doesn’t matter.
---
No way you can clear a dungeon in classic 5 time in an hour even with an amazing group
---
Druids aren't that great at AoE Tanking tho since Swipe only hits 3 targets. Warriors are better for AoE Scenarios due to Demo Shout and Thunder Clap (AoE only)
---
You're thinking of phasing.. and that was added, only in a handful of quests, in wotlk.  Sharding (layering) was added in WoD
---
WoW community doth protest too much
---
&gt;It's just natural for people in Europe to stay with their own language and their own community.
---
Not really. Maybe for the French, English, Spanish and Germans.
---
That’s right spend all your time in a dungeon not exploring the game for what it is.
---
Gobsmacked that anyone is even considering doing this.
---
Each to their own
---
not going oom. healing for huge amounts. topping charts (if thats your thing). also dueling and such as a healer is a powerful thing with gear. Healer/hybrid progression is a super amazing thing in classic.
---
Cycle of Hatred takes place pretty much before events of Classio/Vanilla so maybe you should save that for last
---
Wife, but no kids.  2 pretty high maintenance dogs and a demanding job however.  
---
Classic will be different, but still fun. 
---
As long as I don’t feel compelled to “keep up with the Joneses” I’ll be just fine.
---
Focus on professions, leveling up, scrapping together a dungeon here and there.  I’ll enjoy the game, just can’t let it consume me!
---
Also at 20 a mage can teleport to org and uc for more convenient in person sales.
---
Tbh, I'm unsure about what I get out of Anticipation and Toughness. How much is armour worth compared to defense? I think, I'd rather have 6 defense than 6% more armour, but I'm just not sure which I get more out of.
---
I love to swear and I don’t know that I’m not allowed to swear. What if I die get up to heaven and God’s like: “Hey, man. Welcome to fuckin’ heaven.”
---
"Champion! Let me have your babies!" - haehaehaeh that's brilliant man, really funny!
---
Real integrated. They still have time to remove it if they choose, but i doubt it.
---
I agree the poster above you is overstating it, but trying to reach a “near guaranteed” 100% rate isn’t the way to approach this question either.
---
Take an average fight with a melee. Rogues are going to hit you 3x more than an arms warrior or shaman, and hunter/lock pet is somewhere in between, so let’s just roughly call it 10 hits per fight even if that is way off. 
---
If you’re wearing two freezing bands, then 1 out of every 5 random fights you’ll see this proc. Against rogues probably every other fight. 
---
For a passive stun that is significant. No other piece of gear has a combat effect that strong that isn’t on a massive cooldown.
---
for the record
---
I do know some people who actually met in wow and married
---
Watching the streamers has become really boring...But I'm still really excited to start leveling on classic for sure!
---
That would be a stupid place to farm that item.
---
No matter what you do you'll be the underdog against pretty much every class as a Ret Paladin. They're a joke.
---
Why, because you can't justify paying for multiple accounts and go through the trouble of setting everything up so no one else should be able to?
---
It's not like multiboxing is somehow inherently stronger than playing "normally", it's not like someone is going to be fully taking advantage of their class(es) while doing it.  I don't care how well someone has their multiboxing setup, say it's 5 characters, if you come across them in the world with your own group of 5 real players, you should easily beat them in a 5v5 fight.
---
Stumbling across them solo is obviously going to end badly for you, but that's no different than coming across a group of enemy players that aren't multiboxing.
---
I never hopped on the hype train. I'll only be on the hype train 1 week before release, and probably at least through the first two weeks of playing. It's also a lot of hype for a game that has a lot of travel time :P
---
After killing 5356466 tigers
---
This video was singlehandedly responsible for all of my dozens of failed rogue leveling attempts.
---
Even if it's a 1/10 proc per fight vs melee. It's an autowin proc. So lets say you have a 50/50 WR vs rogue (made up). Now boost that to 60%(or 5% becuase you'd win the other half). Not too bad.
---
I hope to join their ranks someday :)
---
I believe that after 2 years or so of Classic, Blizzard should do the following :
---
\-release TBC (as it was) realms, with option to copy lvl 60 Classic characters to TBC realms
---
\-release Classic+, within Azeroth, with the same option to copy lvl 60 characters to Classic+ realms
---
\-fully merge the existing Classic realms into a handful of Classic reams, used for leveling to 60, to experience Vanilla as it was, and character copy to TBC, Classic+ or both. Or simply stay in Classic as a lvl 60 forever.
---
This way, the entire player base is preserved, and everyone have all options : TBC, Classic+ and Classic.
---
Not to mention that Classic+ is a MASSIVE CHANCE for WoW to go another path, a TRUE MMORPG path. Even if it requires a relatively high investment, Classic+ will bring in huge revenue, for years. It is WORTH doing it.
---
For discord , its Both. Also a mobile app.
---
Discord.gg is the website, they push for you dling the client, but not totally nessacary. Be warned, the browser site can eat up some RAM.
---
but how much mitigation will 6% more armor give with average lvl 60 gear? This is kinda important for the comparison, 6% more armor does not really tell us anything.
---
Spellweavers turban is phase 2, not 1.
---
How far does enchant level go on level 5?
---
Can you disenchant any item at any level? Or do you need like 150 enchanting to disenchant a level 40 item for example.
---
Keep up the “coarse” language josh. Fuckin’ love your podcast!
---
“maybe if we REE hard enough blizzard will listen!”
---
Get over it, we’re not getting unarmored mounts, RP-PVP servers or national servers no matter how many signatures you get.
---
As a healer, I am so hoping to find a quest group who wants to PVP and do all of the troll quests.
---
Don't forget to do the pirate boat quests, AND find / pick up the mystery note that leads you to a free bag!
---
yeah man, and it'll be nice to have a separate way to get money than just grinding
---
Classic is not for you to experiment and then go "oops oh well I guess that change wasn't good after all lol! see you suckers back to retail for me!"
---
Fire mage is a lot more fun and isnt just spamming 1 ability
---
That is a possibility - there is always also the possibility that the servers aren't populated somewhat evenly and can cause a similar situation. I see 2 possibilities in this scenario: Keep layering or add realms and free transfers. Keeping layering would be the simple solution, adding realms is the better solution. So yes, if Blizzards estimations are shit we can have a bad situation, or if the servers are populated in a shitty manner. Though I imagine the latter case is unlikely.
---
It isn't terrible.  It's good quality but it lacks any of the sort of advanced features that Discord has and that's the reason nobody uses it.
---
I just like the numerous options those two classes provide. I can pretty much run hybrid ele/Reston hybrid and do pvp or pve with a shaman, run ehancement if I want to melee, and still have a priest that I can do shadow for pvp or healing for pvp/pve. I don’t have the time available as when I was younger so I definitely want to play more desirable classes since I may not be able to have a reliable raiding schedule.
---
I wish you good luck. I met my wife in-game in the burning crusade, we are a pair since wotlk, got married a month before MoP and eagerly waiting for classic to come out and play it together, so it’s definitely possible. Although we are proud Taurens, but hopefully Alliance has husband material too! :)
---
Data horder here. I backup everything I have about once a year. The hard part is regularly checking the HDDs for any bad sectors, but it is managable.
---
&gt; so let’s just roughly call it 10 hits per fight even if that is way off.
---
&gt; If you’re wearing two freezing bands, then 1 out of every 5 random fights you’ll see this proc.
---
Your maths are way off.
---
The chance to see it proc nears 98% with 200 hits.
---
If you get hit 50 times you have 63ish% chance to see it.
---
Of course you could see it proc every single fight, but that's not likely.
---
It would be way better if it was pseudo-random, but AFAIK there is no pseudo random in WoW.
---
Haha, is there a big reasoning behind that though?
---
I remember sitting in RFC at 60 getting hit by a mov to avoid afk logouts.
---
It's also much more lightweight than Ventrilo and of course better quality and free.
---
Same here, not sure if it's an age thing or that most games just suck nowadays and offer nothing new.
---
I agree with you; however, judging by the lack of upvotes I don think everyone does.
---
Nah man. Your response is pure "I told you so" and adds nothing to the discussion.
---
You’d get .24% chance to block, parry, and dodge, (so about a 1% boost to avoidance) 
---
The armor percentage would add flat mitigation that really depends on gear, but is of value early because of the diminishing returns on armor increases. Essentially, the boost to armor could add anywhere from 5-10% (or 3-6%) physical damage reduction.
---
The difference between RP-PvP and PvP is literally just how its marked. All it does is signal to players who wish to RP on a PvP realm to congregate here. Its a far cry from changing the patch release schedule or setting up monolingual servers that in *Blizzard's eyes* will negatively affect the community. All it takes is for 1 single PvP server to have RP- appended to it's label.
---
THANK YOU!! :D
---
Level 40 is a magical level.
---
Thanks. I definately overlooked the importance of threat, even in 5-mans.  
---
As for the last part, I'm leaning towards anticipation. Mostly, cause I'll have crappy gear early on.
---
Hide and Seek by Namie Amuro.
---
Man this guy really killed it, I waited forever for more but they didn't come did they
---
This reminds me of the time my guild's MT/GL freaked out and threatened to cancel an Onyxia raid because people were putting the Handful of Rose Petals on her and his frame rate was dropping to almost zero.
---
no, it's 2! fireball and scorch! double the fun!
---
That's a big error. It wasn't added till 1.10 which makes it more like phase ~5. Updated. Thank you.
---
Do you think it matters that a million other people will also be playing mage?
---
You're Breathtaking!
---
Gonna move back to her basement.
---
Yeah watching the 10th streamer corpse running and wall jumping for 1 hour to visit Hyjal is not prime content.
---
That being said, I await the end au August.  Hype has died down a bit but it's cool.  I know it won't be the same as in 2005 and we must approach it knowing that.  I played a bit on a private server and even though it was more than 10 years ago I was still on automatic pilot and knowing exactly where to go and what to do.  For old timers, this is well known content.  But I did rekindle with the feeling of a journey of progressing a character.   Where each level up meant something.  Each new piece of gear.
---
The appeal for me is playing a human in game BECAUSE I'm a human irl.
---
It's fun to "project" myself into my character if that makes sense.
---
And pyroblast and combustion
---
I'll be there the day after!!!! I have 2 weeks off but the wife wants to do stuff the first week :( Won't be home till late on the 27th so my grind starts on the 28th to the 5th
---
Advance features like being able to adjust volumes individually is why I believe it's terrible.  Simply because of the wide variety of mic qualities and input settings, makes it so that you can barely hear some and others sound like their eating the mic.  
---
It's just not good when you compare it to Discord.
---
Yes, I was thinking the same. Early on, I'd probably want to go with Anticipation, since my gear (armour value) will suck.
---
Say what you want about lvl 60, but the best ding was 40 ding. At least for me.
---
&gt;Even if it's a 1/10 proc per fight vs melee. It's an autowin proc. So lets say you have a 50/50 WR vs rogue (made up). Now boost that to 60%(or 55% becuase you'd win the other half). Not too bad.
---
It feels weird.  
---
I'm talking maths and you pull numbers out of your ass.  
---
Of course the proc is super strong.   
---
But outside of 1v1 duels it's not going to matter much.
---
where you from?
---
You are actually better than us, we got closer to classic just by few seconds, you however by 6 hours.
---
i can't remember if this has any use in case you get disarmed. Does the weapon (or lack thereof) skill count in PvP?
---
Cool, nice shit post.
---
75, is you want to skill it.
---
Ye drop that useless b\*tch!
---
Unfortunately i didn't play until TBC was out, but i listened to a lot of Enter Shikari while messing around in Silithus. Whenever i hear the intro song from Take To The Skies, it always takes me back.
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/KnottyPluckyTigerSSSsss  
---
&gt; **Ion:** [...]I don't think we're currently planning on any RP-PVP realms in particular, because that's maybe a bit too small of a niche... but, we'll see how Classic unfolds once it's out there and certainly *if, you know, there's a large population and demand for that server, for that type of server, that could support it, we'd be open to adding it*.
---
No, the disenchant requirements came in 2.0, not 1.12
---
Not really. You never really have too many mages. Filling out 40-mans was hard enough in Vanilla let alone now. And for 5-man content you are the most sought after DPS so there is no shortage of groups to join. Plus if you prove to be a decent player people will always want to regroup with you as every group wants a Mage.
---
75, if you want to max it out.
---
I read a whole series about a ring with no legs that traveled quite a bit.
---
I'd rather a Classic experience but with new Classic content. What messed retail up was stuff like LFR, Welfare epics, lack of community, etc.
---
Adding a Classic version of Grim Batol wouldn't hurt anyone, it would just give people another reason to play Classic.
---
Updated. Ty.
---
&gt; Your Intellect increased by 1
---
Oh I see, when your questing it’s a bitch.  WPvP wasn’t done in the questing areas per-say,  that went right over my head haha.
---
Honestly, your success will depend on your personality.  As much or possibly more than your skill levels.  From there it's about the correct tools and motivation.  
---
I personally would stream myself if had not lost an eye and would have to wear an eye patch all day on video like some weird keyboard pirate.  I'm a pretty skilled and funny guy, but that doesn't fix ugly!
---
Have at it, worst that could happen is it doesn't take off and you stop, or you get swatted, one of the two.
---
I like to dress mine like a pirate cause I'm out here stealing profits from people who don't know how to price their shit.
---
Ammo is a constant upkeep cost to the hunter, but running out of ammo was not really a thing if you had mediocre inventory management skills.
---
Deadzone is mostly a problem agianst mages, not rogues, especially if you play dwarf.
---
Thanks for the explanation. If you by chance have a good source to research more on the diminishing returns on armor, please drop a link :)
---
Not all of us unfortunately. I am doing compulsory military service, so I won't be able to play until ~9th of November 2019 :(
---
This post is like watching a deer be mauled Jesus Christ dude
---
Dungeons take more than an hour and rarely give a full level. You're gunna get bored
---
Probably play on a private server for the first time.
---
Unsub.
---
Anything by Static-X reminds me of Duskwood.
---
Defense also increases your chance to block and decreases your chance to be crit. The main reason to go for defense actually is getting crit-immune.
---
A slightly higher average damage taken can be compensated much better than receiving a crit.
---
Comparing mitigation as a percentage with an armor-percentage is also not quite a fair comparison. You'd have to look at how much further damage-reduction that 6% armor actually will lead to.
---
However, I still think that in this situation Armor is overall better. Sinply because I don't think that a crit of any of the 5-man-bosses is too high for a healer to deal with.
---
Blizzard: Be vocal we hear you.
---
u/zauru193: stfu don't show blizzard what you want and need.
---
Logics.
---
There is a moonwell in Ashenvale as well, horde players usually use that.
---
GTFO dude.
---
Early on don't warriors only have tclap for aoe? But druids have swipe.
---
I would be most likely going Horde... most likely an Orc. Im not a pro player but im definitely not a noob... inventory management wont be an issue... I guess my concern was that either A) arrows would be expensive and constantly render me broke, or B) arrows would run out very quickly and constantly result in me having to buy (or craft?) new ones which would be a constant interruption or worse, I would run out in a dungeon/raid...  
---
or perhaps a mixture of both lol
---
If I go human I can pretend I've been isekai'd
---
Paladins lack taunt in Vanilla. And they need to drink a lot.
---
Right, but we need one for every language. The unofficial servers business everyone is panicking about now has always been the reality of anyone not from the big 4, if people are serious about this being a problem then we need to include the, by far, majority of languages to avoid the problems. "What if you rolled on a server, just to find out there's a server where 80% of the population is from your country, you just never heard about it" is exactly what happened to me the first time WoW was launched. Took me 4 years to find out.
---
If we're making strides to reduce that sort of problem we should do it for everyone, not just people who live in either of the big 4 countries, otherwise the problems are going to be happening anyway, just not to you people.
---
If they'd sent a hunter after her this video would've been remarkably shorter.
---
That was great. 
---
Thanks for the laugh.
---
Move on with life?
---
I dunno. It's buggy as hell. I would play something else since there's always private servers and they're pretty damn good these days
---
not in classic wow. all raid specs are really simple to say the least.
---
I'd give up on WoW altogether and wait for the next best innovative MMO in 20 years.
---
nice strawman
---
Im playing BFA till it comes out. The boss this patch is Azashara and its actually a lot of fun as we are in her kingdom where this a lot to do an alot of pvp
---
id like to beat her on heroic if i could before classic comes out and maybe get above 2k arena rating
---
Ive stopped looking at classic entirely in the meantime (this happened to popup on my reddit this morning)
---
Isnt it easier on classic vs private since the 1.12 itemization is already there?
---
I very vaguely remember getting a cheap epic mount from av? Maybe I'm misremembering but did you still have to buy the riding skill if you had av exaulted mount? No idea how I afforded it back in the day if this was not the case.
---
They have said that opening more servers and offering free transfers off of overpopulated realms will be utilized if necessary but they want to keep the number of servers as low as possible to ensure that every server has a healthy population because once they've created a server they can't never ever delete it.
---
Just roll horde and lock the choke point. You'll get your 40 hour av lol
---
What do you think is the reason that we as humans are upset about seeing when an animal suffers like that?
---
What is it you’re looking to hear? People commuting ritualistic suicide? 
---
People would be disappointed, hold a grudge with blizzard and otherwise move on with their lives.
---
It’s a fucking video game, not broken campaign promises.
---
Rank 10 set is the blue one right?
---
Isn’t that complete trash? I mean.. not only because it’s not written in fancy purple text,  but also because I thought Paladin dungeon t0.5 set is even better than PVP tank 10. 
---
But please, correct me if I’m wrong. So far very thankful for you long answer.
---
I'm really really excited for the 1-60 grind, dungeons and especially the level 55-60 dungeons.
---
Those end game 5 mans were SO much fun, gearing up and doing them a lot. One of the reasons I'd be down for classic+ content, just hoping they add more level 60 5 man dungeons that are hard.
---
I agree about raids, theyre so much about attendance and you lose a bit of that daily journey at that point. Its still fun imo, but yes agreed that all the beginning stuff is the most important and fun part of wow!
---
That's a relief
---
1500 people is not really a large population.
---
Let them focus on the basic stuff instead of thing like RP-PVP.
---
That could work!
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Armor
---
I’m not sure if this is reflective of the true vanilla formula, but it illustrates the concept.
---
Not hard at all, you just fill up whenever you turn quests in. If you’re completely brain dead you’ll have a tough time. The hardest part of hunters is getting to level 10 to get your pet. Everything else is smooth sailing. 
---
Late game or instances the tough part is keeping your pet from pulling. But that is manageable as well.
---
Yeah idk though, I tried the client with my expensive laptop and it made the fans go off like crazy.
---
So lets say it takes 7 days played to level an alt with professions for farming.
---
Thats 168 hours played. If you take the lowest average gold/hour from the first post for example which is 75 g/h you would have made 12,600 gold farming in the time you leveled your alt.
---
At 800 g per mount you could farm almost 16 mounts in the time the alt is level 60.
---
Even when you calculate for lower gold supplies at the start or a lower g/h its still not even close.
---
Also not many people want to abandon their main for very long times at the crucial and fun time when you first get 60.
---
If you want to see how to play a priest, watch Hydra.
---
Highly recommend that you go shadow priest while leveling. You will have no problem healing dungeons until 60. Same thing with Shaman - level as enhancement and respec at 60 to resto.
---
what about leveling to 60 on your rogue first? bit early to think about an alt isnt it?\^\^
---
STOP RUINING MY LIFE!
---
I wasted my whole day at work yesterday reading these
---
I dont know about arrows but ammo for guns isnt a problem at all. Youre just forced to be engineer and you will always have too much ammo. you can even sell them on the ah once you can use better ones.
---
TRUE! 
---
BFA is all about cosmetics.
---
&gt;Nobody asked for Romanian realms. Or Polish, or Bulgarian, or Danish, or Swedish , or etc. etc. realms.
---
Why not? The reasons to make the German, French Spanish and Italian ones are to avoid unofficial servers. Now we'll just have unofficial Romanian, Polish, Bulgarian, Danish and Swedish etc etc realms. If the goal of having national servers is to eliminate the existence of unofficial language-specific servers it will fail, because those servers will form just like they did when WoW came out. 
---
The server I played on ended up an entirely Polish server and I missed out on playing the unofficial one for my nation, which is exactly the problems people are pointing out with only having international servers. So the problem isn't really being resolved, is it?
---
But campaign promises are something I expect to be broken anyways, so I'd probably be much more upset about classic not coming than that. :o
---
For dungeons whatever you prefer, for raid it's up to the composition. 
---
Wand nodes are mandatory, you can't spec into -15%. You usually put just one point into threat reduction since you have a free point when you want to descend the disc tree.
---
You can heal as any spec up to the lategame dungeons around level 56 or so. From that you can still heal if you have some healing gear and your party aren't full of noobs. You will feel when your healing starts to dump, that's the point to respec.
---
Taunt is pretty irrelevant in 5 man in general and especially in terms of aoe tanking.
---
Casters will also have to drink a lot, when they constantly use aoes.
---
A similar list can easily be made for Classic as well. Get over it.
---
I haven't played wow in some time now...but do people just not have bank alts anymore? I played for years and it always seemed like everyone had a bank alt.
---
No, you can disenchant every item with skill level 1.
---
I can't be the only one who NEVER noticed theese beautifull pieces of art when i played WoW?
---
Yes I believe so. If it says requires engineering then you need to be an engineer to wear it
---
It's a requirement to wear/use it.
---
If I were only tanking 5 mans and UBRS....I wouldn’t feel compelled to put any points in prot.
---
Aspect of the cheetah is lvl 20 :(
---
Hello all, I have been researching for a quite a bit and I just can't seem to narrow down what I actually want to play. It is a toss up between a holy priest or a holy paladin. I have mained a holy priest on retail since wrath, however, I also dabbled in shockadin / holy pally during TBC and early wrath. 
---
From the videos I have watch both are excellent and needed in PvE content. Holy priests have a huge toolkit, however, they suffer with mana sustain. On the otherside Holy Pally's essentially use the same two spells and are generally on MT duty (which I am fine with too) but they have excellent sustain. 
---
I never got to play vanilla so the PvP also looks pretty fun. So I will be probably doing some of that also. (70 % PvE 30% PvP)
---
From people who have played both at higher tiers of PvE OR PvP I would love to hear your thoughts and the pro's and con's of each. Thank you all in advance :)
---
Did we watch the same stream? Everyone was teleporting everywhere.
---
If the actual gear item says requires x then you need x in order to equip it
---
&gt; You're having a hard time understanding the difference because there essentially isn't one since it's based on the same tech. 
---
uhm don't listen to this guy\^, the top comment is correct.
---
I'd be bummed but the ensuing shit storm would be amusing to watch at least.
---
play on pservers that have now datamined correct info for a pretty blizzlike experience.
---
Huh. Your “Hours” is spelled wrong. /s
---
I'm leveling a prot paladin since I'll be douing.  My hope is just to tank some 60 dungeons so I can gather holy gear to go holy.  Will I be able to tank dungeons ok, especially Strat and Scholo? (I don't plan to raid prot, I plan to raid holy, pls no bully)
---
Not all hero's wear capes.
---
Lol... if you think scatter and freezing was an intended change you are all wrong.
---
This was a BUG in 1.12 and was fixed later on.
---
Scatter is a disorient, Freezing is a freeze effect, the whole point of scatter in pvp was to trap afterwards.
---
If it wasn't a bug they wouldn't have fixed it.
---
It will be a thing but it _won't_ be a thing for people who don't know what they're getting themselves into.
---
For dungeon grinding to be better than normal questing you need 2 things to happen.
---
1)  Your group needs to know what they're doing and be efficient.
---
That doesn't mean, oh ya I've played wow before and I know how to keybind my spells and not keyboard turn.
---
It means you know the dungeons, know the pulls, know where everything is, know the sticking points so you're not going to take a bad pull and die, know how to keep a good pace, not have people afking or losing focus.
---
2)  Speaking of losing focus, have you tried grinding the same dungeon for 4+ hours straight lately?
---
As cool as something like SM Cath sounds to do right now to all you people not playing the beta or pserver....when you're on your 20th straight clear of it, it's not fun anymore.
---
The average player can do like 3 clears before they start to get bored and want a change of scenery.
---
You will be fine to do exactly that. You may not be the strongest but you will still be able to play. It’s not like you will be killed by everything every time it looks at you all because you are not min maxing. Play the game how you want to play the game. Not everyone is going to play the game to the hardcore extent that this subreddit makes it seem like. If you want to smash people with a 2h hammer and the iconic banana set then do it. I hope to see you on the battlefield having fun doing what you want to do. People will say you have trouble getting into guilds. You will be able to find a guild and obtain t1 if you put in the work for it. You should even have less competition for it because holy paladins don’t necessarily want it. The chances for prot pallys wanting it are fairly slim. Don’t let people tell you, you can’t, and don’t be afraid of not min/maxing.
---
There are three blue post in the German thread with more than 17k comments by now. The community manager said that he‘s waiting for feedback from the higher-ups regarding this issue.
---
I don't have beta access, but played the stress test. After I hit lvl 15 quests started rewarding 50-80 silver. 
---
So, not a hard confirmation, just a bit of personal experience backing up your source.
---
Also the same with crafting recipes. You cannot redeem/learn the plan/recipe until you meet that requirement.

Swipe is king for 3-4 mob pulls. These people sound like they want to do big pulls.
---
Meanwhile the no changes crowd remains silent because nobody they all forgot they were using addons for this feature the whole time.
---
They are made for profit, not out of passion.
---
It should go without saying that not everyone that will be playing classic are on this sub nor have any interest in signing petitions.  
---
I am merely one signee, but I have a entourage of 4 people that is also interested in an RP-PVP server, but unfortunately, have no interest in petitions nor making their voice heard on forums.
---
PServers in general were pretty overtuned. I'm excited to see how much better people will be overall.
---
Rouge if you want to do stuff by yourself, warrior of you want to farm dungeons and stuff.
---
Technically, this *is* client side. The server doesn't send the models or textures to the client. It just tells the client what model to display where doing what  using IDs.
---
I know that there are WotLK pservers that allow you to optionally install cata models clientside and even have guides for that.
---
Ammo isn't an issue. Its just another step you'll take in your city breaks, whenever u go back to turn in quests and buy food, you go to the ammo guy and fill your quiver.
---
Every class has its thing and the dead zone is Hunter's main on. There is melee leeway now, i assume you heard, so things might change but its a manageable and fun mechanic on pservers. Learn how to strafe, get a macro to cast FD + Freezing Trap, and you're set.
---
That’s exactly my spirit! Thanks though
---
Needled 24/7 and Sixpounder by Children of Bodom reminds me of all the time spent in AV on my paladin.
---
STVietnam, the main reason to play on a PvE server.
---
The banana set has some str on it. The 5 piece set bonus give 1% chance for melee crit. Other than that it’s a healing set. 
---
You won’t be ripping through people like a rogue but if you play it smart, you’ll stand a chance. 
---
Like someone else said, you’d be better off investing your time into the pvp set if you aim to be doing that a lot.
---
Can we get all the retail talent backgrounds as well?
---
Guess people get touchy when you insult their store mounts. Your elf waifus aren't real, kids!
---
You don't always have to use the most expensive ammo.
---
The cheapest ammo is 200 shots for 10 copper.
---
At 60 I mostly used the 200 shots for 9 silver-ammo as some sort of compromise between damage and not going broken.
---
If you want to stream, the number of people watching your broadcast is immaterial. In fact, the only difference between you streaming and not, is there is now not only an acceptance for you to talk to yourself, but it’s creepy if you don’t talk to yourself as a streamer.
---
If you like streaming: stream. If you’re entertaining the views will come. If you aren’t, at least you’re broadcasting yourself—which should be the goal anyhow. 
---
Only a narcissist truly cares how many people watch him slay dragons.
---
Why is this subreddit being littered with these dumb post?
---
Yeah but its satisfying to use sprint and its fun to play the game. Not everything needs to be optimized.
---
It's not a good solution if the solution you are proposing only fixes the problem for a subset of the playerbase. If we can make it suck for fewer people, shouldn't we try to make it suck for as few as possible instead of just including German, French, Spanish and Italian players, calling it close enough and having it suck for everyone else?
---
Fresh pserver.
---
The only thing thats killed my hype slightly is this subreddit lol
---
&gt; Pairing a shaman with their paladin sounds like a great idea lol
---
Ya'll are joking...right?
---
Frerver.

If they cancel Classic I would look for a private server for the first time and so would the 10+ people in my crew that are coming back for it. I’ve had an account since early 05. 
---
They won’t do this though. It would be so dumb on their part as it is going to print money for them for at least the next 2 years even if it’s a buggy mess. Which from my beta testing doesn’t look like it’s going to. 
---
I got my warrior to 40 and every other class to 10 or 20. It’s pretty well ready for launch from what I have seen.
---
dworf priest masterrace
---
Can't say a post lead by someone named "LobotomizedCock" is really starting off on the right foot.
---
two schools of thought while leveling... shadow and disc.
---
Honestly if you look at the shadow line there is a lot there but you have to put a lot of points into it before you get to any of the good +damage stuff and you probably won't have a shadow damage wand to take advantage of shadow weaving. 
---
What I'll be doing is getting wand spec and spirit tap then going disc up until meditation / inner focus and then re-spec to shadow at 42'ish for shadow form.
---
you continue to demonstrate it flawlessly.

---
It's because most big streamers played alliance. I'm betting like a 53%-47% ratio in favor of the horde in live.
---
Hail Brother!
---
&gt;easy to do SFK for the pally
---
Especially since you just need to get to the courtyard, which is easily done at 20/21. Verigans Fist is so fucking amazing until late 20's.
---
Hey thanks for adding some very much relevant information! Do you know how much % the block chance increases per defense point? 
---
You’ll have 300 defense as a level 60 and will need 440 defense to reach the «crit-immune» stage vs. level 63 bosses, which might not sound feasible for your average Joe, so I kind of ignored that.
---
However, if OP want to go 3/3 imp revenge then some additional block, dodge and parrry chance might be of value to have revenge proc more reliably.
---
Also a small (probably irrelevant) thing to note is that as a tank, having a high dodge chance CAN hurt your rage generation. Something to note as well is how toughness scales good with gear, if you don’t think you’ll get much high-armor pieces it might not be so good.
---
Are you like retarded? 
---
Everything i linked is at it's current state in Beta which they most likely will be improved.
---
&gt;Give me proof that actual layering isn't working?
---
That was proof, in it's current state.
---
There is a very disappointed mom somewhere.
---
This is natural and your hype will skyrocket again the day/week before release :)
---
This.  Im holding out for classic, but i really don't like BFA, so i would also look into 1 for the first time.
---
you need the same items while leveling though :X
---
If you think Deadzone and Ammo are "problems" than the hunter class is not for you.
---
Wanna know what‘s better? One Shaman and four warriors with SS. No joke. Autism beats utility.
---
You can't be invited to asmongolds raid if you're horde!
---
Submit a bug report, that's literally what beta is for.
---
The paladin will be no competition to the two casters since spell healing and spell damage are different stats in Vanilla/Classic.
---
I started out not caring about this issue, I won't lie. However, over the past several months I've seen SO many people share stories about their experiences leveling on RP-PVP back when they started WoW. I realized that, if I was able to level on a PvE server like I did in 2005, why shouldn't they be given the same treatment?
---
People are ganna give you crap for wanting this, but haters are everywhere. To those against including this server type at launch - What would you be doing if PvP or PvE servers weren't included?
---
Good luck to those pushing for this issue to be solved.
---
&gt; great at AoE Tanking
---
Probably not going to be pulling more than 3 at once anyway I imagine, at least most of the time.
---
Should have started that time off on the day after release.  Shit probably won't work until 5pm EST anyway.  Whats the point of sitting around all day anyway?  It will be like a long patch day.
---
Gorillaz Demon Days played on repeat, over team speak for all to hear 😅, while grinding through the barrens.
---
Some of us already explored it back in vanilla, and now want to have fun with friends and explore endgame...
---
This. Tuxedo set is BiS for bank alts.
---
Put the start attack macro on any ability you need rage to use. Get a clear target/ target nearest for quick swapping to nearest target. Bind your stance specific abilities to the main bar so you can have multiple abilities bound to the same key (pummle and shield bash) or macro them so you auto swap (/cast battle stance /cast mocking blow). Make spam macros for rage dumping (ie for aoe dps: /cast whirlwind /cast bloodthirst /cast cleave).
---
Not worrying about the boredom factor tbh with you, its mostly about wether its an efficient way of leveling
---
Spent as much time in redridge ganking on my horde rogue as I did in TM on my ally. I think there will probably be server specific trends but in general I doubt more gankers will go to one side or the other.
---
So true lol...
---
Fair enough, early on I too would probably sell the ring as I want to go hardcore pve and the money would be amazing as you said. But I can easily understand a pvper not selling it regardless of how much it’s worth
---
Wouldn't you be significantly gimped in BGs without an epic mount?!
---
No, that's not the best one. It doesn't automatically accept the replacement dialog box, doesn't allow you to choose different poisons, and won't work for both MH and OH.
---
You should read up on the concept of a question, it will help you a lot while you attempt to use Internet forums. 
---
Pro tip: when a question is asked it’s not asked because the person asking it thinks something (that’s called a statement) it’s asked because the person doesn’t think something but wants to  think the right thing.
---
It's like my experience with BG's, when I play Horde, we always lose. When I play Ally, we always lose.
---
That said, Horde is more PvP/try-hard populated.
---
Unfortunately it's names like that you'll be seeing if we're forced to play on PVP servers!
---
I dont think efficiency will be an issue, maybe there's a few things we have forgotten, but that should be fixed in the first run or so.
---
And it being boring, I'm not too worried about, just wondering if its an efficient way of leveling.
---
I think you just don't get the point.
---
Galak Hunting Grounds - (16-20) Mulgore - Tauren and centaur fight over the control of the prey-rich area, but nature fights back.
---
Bronzemaul Hold -  (13-17) Loch Modan - The Bronzebeard clan has finally decided to take action on those pesky ogres. Time to get rid of them for good!
---
Azshara Deeps - (50 - 54) - (Insert generic Goblin name here) needs your help to uncover ancient Highborne treasures hidden deep within the flooded depths of the Azshara coasts.
---
I think these would be nice.
---
Yes haha i was always defending because of it
---
Which, like..... Why? Who wants their wallpaper to be a bunch of tiny pictures?
---
If it makes you more comfortable, I'll be leveling a Rogue with my Priest buddy, and a Hunter when I'm solo. I love both classes.
---
The limited ammo thing is fine. You can hold a TON of it in your quiver. I've never struggled with it, but acquiring the best ammo() can be frustrating sometimes. 
---
As for Deadzone, it's just a normal con. It can also play to your advantage. Generally playing a Hunter in PvP; It's definitely the most involved and easily one you have to constantly think ahead on. It's very challenging to play well and correctly, rewarding to an extent, and I feel it's the most fun since there is so much to consider doing every millisecond. It's a high ceiling, for sure. It only takes one mistake, or two if you have the right tools, and you'll get heavily punished for it. They're a blast, man. Now with all the buzz about the weird "Melee Extension/Leeway" thing and the weird "Melee resets Autoshot time" thing; I could see some concerns but it's still a couple months away from release. They seem pretty devoted to delivering vanilla properly to us.
---
In PvE you can't go wrong with either. Absolutely every class has it's place and purpose in PvE.
---
I feel you on the dogs. I got a pair of corgis myself +potential future mrs in the works.
---
5 level 20s running dead mines would get fuck all for experience. The first half of the instance is level 14-16 mobs for starters. You would get 10-15% of a level in a full run which takes at least 30 minutes. This would only get worse at 21 and 22. People in this sub are vastly underestimating just how bad this would be.
---
I’m gonna be leveling a troll rogue and immediately take my self to gold shire to gank level 5s
---
Full arms 2h cleave/ww/ss 2-4 mobs per pull... why anyone levels fury blows my mind...
---
I was hyped. After opting into the beta before invites went out, not getting it, and being stuck to just stress tests, I'm losing my hype. Tired of every time I play it having the same issue. New character and wait 30 minutes to 1 hour to complete the first few quests.
---
If anything, the stress tests make me not even want to attempt to play classic until the next week.
---
Portals are 1g standard nowadays.
---
I was happy on Nostalrius and would be happy on Nostalrius 2. I prefer Classic though.
---
This is a great outlook on a dim situation. So, are we there yet?
---
it's 100% slow as shit. if you were to grind normal mobs solo for the time it takes to do a dungeon, you'd get way more xp. the only difference is that grinding mobs for 2 hours feels so much slower than a dungeon for 2 hours.
---
Thanks man this is a great response. I have a feeling I will eventually have both as well haha I’ll be running mostly in a group with a warrior and a mage. I don’t always get to play at the same time as my friends so something I can solo with when they are offline is appealing for sure.
---
It's the same exact thing.  It's just PR to call it layering.
---
I‘d prefer TBC and an altered WotLK if classic is a success.
---
Perhaps even remove flying mounts.
---
Not resub like I was intending.
---
&gt; just lose mortal strike
---
And 2% parry
---
And 5% total damage
---
And 5% extra attack or 5% crit
---
And Sweeping Strikes
---
And Improved Hamstring
---
And Piercing Howl
---
I'd be more concerned about what you are doing rather than what you are wearing. Especially if your already not sure what you should wear.
---
Your playstyle will be the deciding factor on how effective you are in a BG
---
If you the people on your team only care about doing dungeon runs optimally I'd swap the paladin to tank and the druid to healing.
---
Not sure, i know i have tons of screenshots and video from both the quest and the opening somewhere on an old HDD but I'm not sure where/which one... :/
---
Yep! You should do the same plan. Rogue with buddies, Hunter via solo. Bruh. Happy Hunting, and keep an eye out for IndieFalco and Fawakunee :)
---
idk currently in BFA if i alt tab my wow sound turns off, im not sure if thats true for everyone, and youd have to be pretty quick, second monitor FTW
---
Right so the point is not to be afraid to take some dmg talents and respect at 60. I'm not gonna go shadow because I don't really want to.
---
Not if you're just farming dungeons as a healer it's not.
---
Yup, it doesn't matter what they call it or how the describe it, to the end user, a player in game, it's the same exact thing.  There is zero difference.
---
Corrected this one, thanks!
---
Discord is the standard, if you don't use it you will be lonely.
---
Wasnt this released during WotLk era? Defintly wasnt a Vanilla release.
---
I have more trust in Blizzard than politicians, and just look what they did to WoW in the last 5 years.
---
You realize druids have demo shout too right? Not to mention thorns. Also isn't Thunder Clap target-capped in vanilla?
---
You can. I still play Diablo 2 decades later.
---
"Testing period" sounds absolutely right tho and everyone can understand what that means. It doesnt need to have a cool sounding name for it, otherwise it might just be misused for marketing purposes and to mislead customers.
---
"pre-technical-demo-pre-alpha" ... Sounds fucking badass man! where do I sign up?  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
To be fair I'd rather be in a band without a bass than in a raid without enough healers!
---
Make sure to have at least one enchanter in your group.
---
Sorting by New returns all kind of trash.  Now it is your job to downvote so it doesnt make it to "Hot"
---
Last time I ever took time off for a blizzard release was Diablo 3. I'll never make that same mistake again.
---
Diablo 2 isn't a multiplayer MMO, either.
---
Hope you are horde. I’m gonna try and snipe the name Ullivar, orc tribute to Oliver queen lol
---
level 1 enchanting can DE any level items
---
It’s never too late to start streaming. I do it for fun, as a hobby, after I get home from a long day of work. However, lots of people think we’re there just tying to grub some easy cash. So watch out for the flame you might get from this post.
---
With all that in mind, I’ve had a blast chatting to people while I play a game that I love. It reminds me of the good old days of when my buddies and I used to play WoW and talk about it non stop.
---
One thing to keep in mind is that it can be quite disheartening to start streaming and realize that no one is watching. Most streamers face this when they start. There’s lots of articles on the web explaining how to increase viewers and engagement. I find this one to be a really goo reality check: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2018/7/16/17569520/twitch-streamers-zero-viewers-motivation-community
---
Not sure if you're being sarcastic. I think this demystifies something that tends to contradict natural human intuition, which has value because confusion leads to frustration, frustration leads to hate, and hate leads to suffering...
---
There's a lot of probability math that goes into any game, especially one like WoW, and it contributes heavily to the player experience. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a huge number of people who appreciate the connection between mathematics and reward psychology.
---
It is a multiplayer game, what's your point? It has less content than WoW.
---
In the beta, players soloing have switched "layers" without joining or dropping a group.  So how is that any different than sharding?
---
I'm excited to grind rep with people and take my time playing
---
That's a setting that probably has been in the game since forever. Something around "mute noise in background", no clue how it's actually called in WoW. Many games do have it though.
---
Cant wait to see the complaining about login issues by people who are supposedly "MMO vets"
---
First off I’m not advocating for anything here. Nor am I calling you dense to make myself feel better.
---
You have a valid opinion(no changes).What I don’t believe is that you “don’t understand “ why people who want better graphics also don’t want to play retail.
---
If you truly do not understand that there are people who think classic wow gameplay is far superior to retail but ALSO like improved graphics then you are in fact dense.
---
See, I can't understand playing anything BUT human. The reason I'm playing RPGs is cause I can't murder dragons and orcs irl. So I make my character look like me, and think of it as it being me. 
---
If you're playing an orc it's like you're watching a movie.
---
Play a private like everyone else.
---
The only way you’ll know if it’s worth it is to try it and see. Your background is pretty irrelevant. There are tons of players streaming that have more interesting backgrounds in the current game with large followings. But that’s not really a factor imo. 
---
Content is king and streaming is entertainment. Making the best content you can and be as entertaining as you can and see what comes of it.
---
Bad bot
---
Horde dont have to be around mechstriders so I think fair.
---
There are many reasons why you wouldn't want to roll a warrior.
---
1. Worst solo leveling experience in the game.
---
2. Worse solo experience in the game, period, until you get geared out the ass.
---
3. Have to fight rogues, hunters and shaman/paladin for gear.
---
4. Get pooped on in PvP.
---
Cool, good to know! Thanks for the info.
---
No, it's not 1 per week.
---
First step is kill Broodlord. Then Rep. Then talk to Vael and kill Nefarian. That's a minimum of 2 weeks. Onyxia and Ragnaros also only drop one page of the book each lockout.
---
1. Everyone gets the quest and kills Broodlord in week one.
---
2. Everyone helps 2 people get all the rep before week two.
---
3. They both get the Green Scepter Shard at the same time.
---
4. Person A gets the Red Scepter Shard in week two.
---
5. They both get the Goggles, Chicken, and most of the pages in week two.
---
6. Person A finishes the book in week two.
---
7. Person B gets the Red Scepter Shard in week three.
---
8. Person B finishes the book in week three.
---
9. They both get the Blue Scepter Shard in week three.
---
10. Two Scepters finished in week three.
---
That's the best you can hope for. We're not going to have any relatively small servers in Classic.
---
I’ve been too accustomed to current version of mounts. Only been 12 years since vanilla.
---
100000%. Probably both characters as Orc too :)
---
What's better for healing? It still gives +6 int and +12 spirit.
---
Far and away the best option, maybe not the cheapest, but best.
---
those are nice
---
Basic stuff, lol the only thing blizzard has to do is change the label of the server.  There is no special mechanics to an RP server.  The only added work load will be people reporting unRP names.
---
There's a couple plate pieces on their BIS list and plenty on their almost-BIS list.
---
Guess I'll be the boo-man but I have no faith in lootcounsil guilds that needs help setting it up.
---
I think DMB has a option to check buffs. Can't check for gear enchants that has to be done by inspect.
---
I played alliance in vanilla, BC and WoTLK. Played on a RP server, (Argent Dawn, EU) but was usually flagged (I enjoyed the excitement).  Most ?? horde were pretty chill and left me alone for most of the time.
---
It was a really good server with great community on both factions up until WotLK or so, when a lot of non-roleplayers started pouring in for some reason.
---
Baka! It's not like I like you or anything..
---
Stupid answer.  
---
I badly wanna play Classic, but I'm more interested in lvl 60 PvP and end game content. I already experienced WoW "candidly" for YEARS in the past. I lived the fantasies, made my stupid spec, made thousands of stupid mistakes and exploration.  
---
It's ok, I don't give a damn anymore about low level lore. I want to level fast &amp; efficiently. Who are you to say what is "valid" and what is not ?  Especially for such an old game ?
---
LOK TAR!
---
I personally almost see the deadzone as a pro - playing around the deadzone is one of the most fun aspects of the hunter class for me. Of course it's our biggest weakness and whilst I'm sitting in a frostnova unable to do anything I'm not thinking "Yey, what a fun mechanic!", but it's a fair mechanic, and succesfully keeping opponents out of your deadzone the entire fights is something that feels incredibly rewarding every single time.  
---
I'd say, if you can't see yourself accepting and coming to terms with the deadzone mechanic, hunter is probably not the class for you. However if you accept it for what it is, and you can get enjoyment out of the challenge it brings, then you'd absolutely have my recommendation to play hunter.  
---
Don't worry about the ammo thing, compared to rogue mats, thistletea included, it's slightly more expensive. The more annoying part I think is having only 3 bagslots tbh.
---
Yes they are.
---
Thanks. These are great. Isn't there also a popular macro for starting autoattack with sinister strike cast while also casting riposte if it's available? I can't seem to find it.
---
I really don't understand why they're against RP-PVP servers. If they're worried about population, just make one RP-PVP per region and it'll be one of the biggest servers with out a doubt.
---
You mentioned you are pigeonholed into doing things in Classic... Then proceed to only mention raiding. You can play deep affliction warlock just fine in non-raid situations.
---
The amount of time wasted getting WW solo is not worth the slight dps increase. 
---
Unless you get carried you'll only be getting at like 37+ when at 40 you can simply do a quest for bonebiter.
---
This is pretty fucking stupid...
---
It’s going to be an absolute shot show...and I’ll be loving every minute of it.
---
&gt; In the beta, players soloing have switched "layers" without joining or dropping a group 
---
Can you show me a source? All the videos I have seen players have exploited layering by joining groups.
---
No. They tried temporarily banning everyone for it and then reversed the ban claiming it caught too many innocent people just using it for cosmetic reasons. It was "a warning" only. No one has been permanently banned for doing it unless it was used as an exploit.
---
Guess you learned you would've been a tourist anyway. I doubt they were interested in compromising the usefulness of the beta as an actual test by making it optimal as a marketing tool, it's just not the purpose.
---
If you have already decided that you're definitely going to try for an item, then yes, the drop chance doesn't really matter.
---
This information is for people who want to understand their odds *before* deciding to farm for days or weeks. You might have three or four different items that you want to farm for, and understanding how this math works can help you decide which one you want to farm for first, whether or not you should enlist help, etc.
---
My main end goal is going to be pretty much only PvP.   I also doubt I'll have enough free time to raid or go beyond r10.  Because of this, I'm debating between spriest and ele shaman, with more of a preference to shaman.  Does the ele shaman perform well with only r10 gear?   The sets between the two look similar except spriest has about 50 more spell power while shaman has 40 strength.
---
What's the point? I seriously hope you enjoy your job! 😔
---
I don't think there's really any spell damage/healing gear until the 40s and it doesn't really appear on the majority of gear until even later. Plus there's still a good amount of gear that increase spell damage and healing by x amount, isn't there?
---
Is elemental no good for levelling? Runs out of mana too fast?
---
Beating 6 int isn't particularly hard, but it was mostly because you called it 'fucking amazing'. It defo is as a ret weapon but for healing it's just alright
---
This was posted before I believe
---
Yeah I’m definitely not afraid of a challenge, especially a rewarding one. I just didn’t know HOW bad it was lol. 
---
For instance prot paladin not having a taunt makes it useless in raids (from what I have been told) which for a raider makes it unplayable... I just didn’t know if the dead zone was as big a deal as that or if it was a (relatively) minor as warrior healing for example.
---
I agree with you, its a pretty bad technology to implement in an MMO.
---
Will it do what they want? (resolve merging issues and tourists) yea certainly. But its just not a healthy mechanic to put in a community game thats based around sandbox experiences we share together.
---
Sadly people who understand and agree with that are in the minority now. I'm sure a large portion of nost/ps players would agree. Classic is a lot bigger and theres a lot more people here now who see no problem with sharding or layering because means they don't have to deal with inconveniences. Thats just how it goes now :/
---
Is there not a limit on how many mails you can have in your inbox? I only played vanilla on private servers and there it was like max 100 or something.
---
I happen to have two weeks off starting with the same week Classic comes out, man did I excited when I found out that I by chance had hit the exact time.
---
All the riposte macros are broken. Not sure they'll be any that can do it in Classic.
---
I bet people care more about classic than broken campaign promises. These promises get broken like every single time so we lost our faith already. But in Blizzard We Thrust!
---
I have 10+ players coming back to play Classic and we want to roll RPPVP. I’m the only turbo nerd in the group that is trolling forums and Reddit so I have to speak for my whole crew.
---
Yeah probably , just using a private server as a trial run or runs, just to get used to what to pull etc
---
But Diablo is a single player game that you can jump on solo, kill things in dungeons and turn off. In 5 years, if Classic doesn't adapt in some way, it's going to be significantly harder to get raid groups as the game would be stagnant.
---
8 days at robotic 24/7 play would still be faster than the world record. People don't seem to understand just how long 60 takes.
---
Pendulum’s In Silico album reminds me of Netherstorm from TBC a lot! I think it helped that there was a song called “The Tempest” on that album too...
---
Emerald Dream US was literally a full server 99% of the time.
---
Source: I played on emerald meme
---
Rank 10 set is loaded with spell damage.  It's slightly less raw stat wise than T1, but much better statted than T1 for ret.  T2 is even better.
---
Trolls are beautiful in there own way.
---
You’ll be great in strat and scholo. Paladins are great dungeon tanks, don’t worry!
---
Pros: No competition (HUGE), easy gear upgrades, easy gold, repeatable, not prone to WPVP except for when you're resetting dungeon, and it'll take a lot to get together enough people to more than annoy a little a group of 5 coming out of a dungeon.  
---
Cons: Solo levelling is faster if you are no lifing for the first week and don't get more than 3 hours sleep every 24 hours.  
---
I guess I should also mention that you will miss the most fun part of vanilla WoW, but that's subjective. If being level 60 without interacting with the world at all is your thing, do it.
---
Druid teleport to moonglade for a moonwell, plus cheetah form. :)
---
This is why I plan on skipping most if stv lol
---
Are you stupid? How can layering fuck economy? 
---
Economy is balanced because of layering. With 9000 people on one single layer/server economy is fucked because of a high demand...
---
People like you without any knowledge about economy are the biggest problem about this whole layering complaining thing.
---
So technically you disenchant only greens or I’m i mistaken?
---
My best guess is, that when hitting 60 you will not be geared enough to tank through 60 dungeons, especially when there are already well equipped DDs in your group.  
---
It's probably best to collect heal gear through the leveling process anyhow, since you will be able to heal as well, even in prot specc (being flexible in your role will make a lot of things easier). As soon as you hit 60 you should already be able to heal a group through Strat and Scholo.
---
You might also think about offensive tanking and not speccing too deep into prot while leveling; more dmg, faster leveling, more aggro.
---
Dude he knows everything he remembers exactly how vanilla wow was from when he was 15 and no amount of drugs, time, or alcohol can make him forget. Sheesh cant believe blizz doesnt listen to his input.
---
I am planning on playing warrior. A big reason why is that they're the only real viable tank, people should understand this going into the game and there wouldn't be a problem in my eyes. Druids and paladins have their own niche roles in dungeons or even as off tanks if pushed. But the idea that because only 1/3 tank specs is MT viable is a problem I believe is silly. All throughout vanilla warrior tanks were top. Not every spec needs to be viable in pve or even PvP. There's many "dead" specs, prot pally, ench and ele shammy, surv hunter, ect.
---
It's vanilla and if you compare it to something terrible like a high crime rate than maybe you'd enjoy TBC more?  Players who ask for viable druid and paladins tanks I have no sympathy for, just roll a warrior for your tanking desires.
---
The point is "no matter what, my hype is huge"
---
Because that's what the OP and the comment I replied to was talking about? Offspecs are also more viable in PvP than PvE, for example shadowpriest, elemental shamans, ret/shockadins.
---
Unpopular opinion: dont like the artstyle or most of these pics.
---
On the real though what’s with the asking for a $3 donation? Boooooo
---
For the horde!!!
---
Demo shout is more threat than demo roar, and battle shout is actually more threat than both. Tclap is indeed poop.
---
You are definitely going to do it all the way to 60? Do all of you have time for it? Room for one more? I can no life for months after it comes out, but I'm looking for a group that wants to go the distance, and has time for it.
---
I read the title and had the entire song back in my head. Namie Amuro: Hide and seek.
---
Have a cry and then get on with life?
---
They said that they plan on doing large pulls.
---
I had this video BOOKMARKED back in the day. It always got me so hype. So fucking good.
---
Blizzard is going to announce the servers in advance, giving people plenty of time to coordinate which server they'll play on. Warsong1 would probably be the highest populated one...it's common sense almost so people should pick from 2-5 to have a safer pick.
---
You do you, man. You're the one who's going to be staring at it for days on end. Do what makes you happy.
---
Going Tauren warrior tank here. 28 wife 2 kids full time job rip sleep😵😴🤷🏻‍♂️
---
That's exactly what I said, 1 per week expect for the first week. 
---
i agree that the war effort will be completed faster than in vanilla, but AQ is phase 5 I definitely think there will be smaller and bigger servers at that point, not to mention some servers with extreme faction imbalance which might delay one side of the war effort. I can't see every server being done with it in 3 weeks, the fastest will be 2 weeks, but I think that there will be servers in the 6+ week range as well.
---
I had addons that did this, as well as autodismount when talking to a flightmaster
---
I crieded
---
I used to look at the talent art background in game as a 12 year old and fantasize, theorycraft based on the art. 
---
I love the warlock art still. Honestly if I could find extremely high quality images of them I’d have them printed out to match the sizings in the art prints included in the classic wow special edition, frame them, and hang them.
---
You can credit Savix in title for the good editing
---
This train is on a rollercoaster of emotions. I've felt extreeme entausiasm but also fear of disapointment.
---
Finaly a game to play but will it kill my social life ?
---
I've gone tru some loops, some stale moments but overal the hype train has been a great ride so far.
---
Also sword spec ;)
---
If you've got someone willing to play Priest and healbot you the best possible choice is Warrior.
---
what is the rachet shortcut
---
I don't know how I feel about this. Like, I get where you all are coming from, but if they made RP-PVP servers because of popular demand, I'm not seeing that this popular demand is interested in roleplay in the first place, they only want an alternative to the PvP servers, a more calmer and tight-knit community or whatever. But the whole point of RP servers is the roleplay. I don't know. I feel like if they were to do this because of popular demand, RP-PvP servers would ultimately be populated mostly by people that are not interested in roleplay at all, which kind of bugs me.
---
&gt; If you are gold farming then you are not interested in the chance of a drop within x kills anyway. 
---
You might be. Let's say you need to farm some gold in a short window of time and you have two different items that you could farm for. Item A has a high drop rate and sells for little. Item B has a lower drop rate and sells for much more. You would get a greater amount of gold per hour farming Item B, but you also run the risk of spending a lot of time and never seeing a drop, whereas, if you farm Item A, you could reasonably expect to get the gold that you need in a shorter time frame with fewer kills.
---
Or, maybe an item has a high drop rate but it's offset by the difficulty of the mobs, and going after a less expensive item with a lower drop rate and easier mobs to kill is actually more efficient.
---
How do you determine what items are better to disenchant rather than sell on the AH? Is it all just based off of that item’s current selling price? Or are there certain items that are known to be best for disenchanting rather than selling?
---
Thanks for all the help and info!
---
Correct, This was during the height of machinima videos , songs n shit, which was during wotlk
---
Not only that but it's a flick of a switch to change the realm type. This shouldn't be an issue.
---
Don't think you know what that means.
---
In some ways, I'm more hyped and some ways I'm less.
---
I started tons of videos and streamers and reddit for anything classic related. Eventually broke down and played on a private server for the first time ever  to figure out what I'm going to play. Leveled Druid, Mage, Warloc, pally, and 2 priests to 20, and a third priest to 30.  Messed around with professions, fishing, cooking, tailoring, enchanting, mining, blacksmithing, engineering.
---
Now I've decided on my class, my race, my professions for my main. Have two bank alts already planned and their professions.
---
Now I don't want to ruin it for me, stopped playing on the private server.  So that I still got new stuff to rediscover.
---
Guess I'll catch up on netflix until classic releases.
---
If it were a closed beta, there is some legitimacy to it. 
---
But considering classic will be heavily streamed, blogged and reported on for months after its release (the entirety of p1), if blizzard has any desire, discovering what the communities knows won’t be hard. 
---
I’d much rather a world where the rules are slowly learned and broken (just as all sorts were on retail vanilla) by a select few who slowly inform the server. Vs a bunch of guides on how to break layering cause it is known how to abuse it.
---
Layering is gone by p2 anyhow, if blizzard can make it difficult to reproduce layer hopping such that it’s not a sustainable income generator by way of obfuscating how it works for a few months, the game is over.
---
Hahaha well played
---
Man were so fucked when robots get their revenge.
---
There's only one possible answer: rito.
---
No. Layering is 100% about the server 2months down the line. It does little for launch.
---
Dungeon farming, prot pala farming low level dungeons for cloth and boes, was a real hassle when you had to loot each mob individually
---
0.5 set comes in at phase 5, thats very late into the game.
---
Ventrilo... skype.. dude you really havn't gamed in 12 years have you ?
---
That might be true, but I have my own people (Other Germans) in mind that can barely form a sentence that makes any sense in English and who are not willing to learn an entire language just for a game, something that they did not have to do in the original Vanilla due to German server.
---
People always claim that "Many Germans speak English, especially the young ones" but that is just wrong, I am young and I hang out with plenty of people in the age range of 25-30 and most of them just had the basics of English in school and due to them never having to use it, they forgot almost everything.
---
English people should stop blaming French/German/Spanish people and instead try to find a compromise that does not involve people learning a new language "Just because" or they should direct their anger at the people that are responsible for this, namely Blizzard.
---
~~The ret paladin is wrong.~~
---
Nope, they just changed the paladin ones with WotLK. My bad. Priest seems to be unchanged though, suggesting that only the paladin ones were actually screenshots with filters on top.
---
I understand this reference lol.
---
"HALT KNAVE. FOR YOU SIR, SHALL BE GANKED!"
---
Guys, if we change jours to hours, we wont' have to wait as long.
---
No one will have frost reflector, rocket help and skull in classic.
---
Even then, getting G’s led in wpvp wont give you time
---
To switch.
---
Nothing makes me feel more dumb then a kid telling me what color something is.
---
Which is weird cause you would think that wouldn’t matter but man being told something I thought was purple or blue is the opposite is just earth shattering every time.
---
Don't worry, this is in the Classic sound settings and has been in retail wow for a long time, (probably TBC or Wrath).   Back in the day, the original 1.12 client did not let you turn on sound while focused on another window, but it was also a 32bit game with 12 sound channels.  When you resub for classic, you pay for these (among many other) improvements.
---
Will be first 5% to 60 of the rogues on the server and usually i have to shift focus for a week after a long session of leveling and whats better than slowly enjoy the leveling on a brand new toon? ;)
---
I had just watched some the previous day. Guess I'm just spare parts these days.
---
Thanks for replying!
---
Nah thse guys are suckers. If youre not in a guild making a scepter just sell it all, itll be bought immediately and turned in anyway. Gold is harder to farm than rep.
---
That is very good news! ty for sharing.
---
Lol, the final word was that there won't be any. You disagreeing with their final words don't discredit their finality
---
You stoopid
---
I'd go back to Destiny 2 and play Shadowkeep when it releases Sept 17.
---
Maybe give Borderlands 3 (Sept 13) and Gears 5 (Sept 10) a shot.
---
Link's Awakening remaster on Sept 20.
---
Then I'd have Ghost Recon Breakpoint on Oct 4.
---
New Pokemon game on Nov 15.
---
And Star Wars Jedi: Fallen ORder on Nov 15.
---
Good games come out all the time. I'd be dissapointed for about an hour and then I'd move on. Just like 90% of people will from WoW Classic mid-September anyway.
---
To be serious for a second. Why are you on this subreddit if you're not really interested in classic? This is really not a community you visit for the community or one that you explore to keep up with the game. Since.. you know it was released hundred years ago.
---
Warrior/priest is pretty iconic, but warlocks are also good for levelling with a priest, since you'll have a tank pet, warlock dps a heals
---
Tidal charm?
---
Do you honestly think people will be running around with those 1 use items that were heavily inflated on pservers?
---
And Dots don’t force a block, at aq+ gear mages shields do over 2,000 dog absorb lmao
---
You mean other than being a video from the Classic WoW beta?
---
What's the benefit of the back exit to ratchet for a bank alt?
---
Man T2 pally gear really is bonkers. Besides being beautiful, it's actually itemized to fill a hybrid role, it's too bad Stormrage didn't get the same treatment.
---
Cool thing, good luck then 😊
---
None that I'm aware of. Just saying if you have Deflector then you don't really need to stress as you can get enough FR from other sources to tackle Rag.
---
Priest and mage have excellent synergy, AoE farming becomes easy, you can portal the missus around and fight off monsters, kinda like most wives expect anyways xD mana Crystal's are massively underused but such a life saver and with your experience as a caster you'll find it relatively easy to transition to.
---
Yeah, I'd like to know also.
---
T1 set has exactly two uses:
---
* As an early pvp set for holy paladins
---
* For Loatheb in Naxx, as the 8 set bonus is great.
---
Apart from that, T1 really sucks. It mixes damage and healing stats, which makes it crappy for both healers and rets. If you want to run around using Finkles lava dredger and heal in pvp, then T1 will serve you nicely. 
---
But, if you actually want to play a ret in pvp, you will seveerly hamper yourself by using T1. You'd be much better off with blue items. Even Lightforge, i.e. T0, (which also isn't that great) is better for ret than T1
---
I bet you this guy puts ketchup on hotdogs
---
It's great early on but due to pets not scaling with gear it falls off quite fast.
---
There's only going to be like 3 to 5 servers per continent. Blizzard's goal is to keep them high population throughout the lifecycle of Classic.
---
There is no disenchant limitation in Classic. But the majority will be greens, which will be disenchanted.
---
 [https://www.wowhead.com/spell=13262/disenchant#comments:id=5009](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=13262/disenchant#comments:id=5009)
---
Oh I don't think it's that bad.  
---
Hunters have great tools to keep opponents out of the deadzone. When someone gets in there usually is something you could have done differently to prevent it. Situations in which you are unable to do anything at all, just by being deadzoned are quite rare.
---
You definitely had your answer about RP-PVP when Blizzard announced that 20% of EU's player population isn't even getting a server designated in their own language.
---
Only reason I’m not actively playing the Beta every day now is my crew has already resubbed for Classic and we are fooling around in 8.2 which honestly is pretty good so far. First few days of a patch usually are. Warmode feels way better than the start of BFA. Reminds me of PVP in Tol Barad in Cata
---
I got a warrior to 40 and every other class to 10+ and most of them through VC at least. I’ve tested BGs. I’ve tested all the professions. I’m not interested in the lvl 40 meta. As that won’t be a thing when it goes live. If none of my crew is on then I’m still playing the Beta but if I’m solo I’m testing Classic still.
---
One bank alt? Pffft. At least three.
---
Multiple times.
---
The practice has fallen out of use with many players, because everyone now has access to huge bags (I think they're up to 32-slot bags or something). Modern players use their alts to either gear up and play through all the raids, or as gold generators through farming older content, or other activities.
---
Priest! Other than that...erm...priest!
---
Tanking too actually has plenty of challenge.
---
I do the opposite. I put music on in the background and then alt-tab into the game and watch the bobber.
---
I don't play retail but I think [these](https://github.com/Gethe/wow-ui-textures/tree/live/TALENTFRAME) are the backgrounds?
---
Console babyyyy
---
Totally agree. Loot council asking how to loot council is not the one that should loot council.
---
Also having predetermined loot to people is not great because it gets ruined by random drops. Council should be able to decide on the fly.
---
Yeah I too know a lot of companies who post the passwords, camera angles, shift changes and security flaws in their properties for the world to see. 
---
You put proactive people on the case, one guy trolling the internet can get a gauge of how much the player base knows about how the system works. Trolling certain fan sites (though more of this happens on discord now) you’ll even come across forums where the efforts stem from. Then you just quietly fix it and change the game without telling them.
---
Man the memories!!
---
Your name lives up to your post. Spamming HS is awful.
---
I haven't played WoW in two years, so I'd just go on about my life as I have for the last two years.
---
You bet me THAT dude does or you're betting anyone reading that I do.
---
Cause I do.
---
Blizz killed WoW in retail just like how these guys are producing robots to kill the human race!!
---
Layers. Like onions!
---
Creating an orc or troll. Run up the hills towards Ratchet (theres a path for a shaman quest) and jump into the water and let the char drown. after that, you resurrect at the spirithealer in Ratchet and fly to Orgrimmar. You need a couple of silver for that, but its really fast.
---
On the latest LH release I leveled a new character during the population surge, and that actually was a terrible experience.  I could hardly tag a mob for my quests and actually quit in my low 20's.
---
I'm not that concerned with layering truthfully, particularly with an internal cooldown on it as mentioned.  I know it will be abused by a few, but I'd much rather deal with that over the experience I had on LH.
---
I feel like a lot of people on the Beta are also playing Alliance so they don't get burnt out when they play Horde on Classic release.
---
Warrior. If you have a priest willing to heal, go warrior. You'll thank us later.
---
I can't murder humans in real life without going to the stockades, so I play orcs and trolls so I can murder humans on my way to the Stockades.
---
Why not?
---
Just go with warlock
---
It’s pretty easy to find green mail items of the eagle/whale/owl either in the world on AH because warriors and ret paladins don’t want it. After level 29, holy paladins can heal pretty much naked with illumination, blessing of wisdom, and SoL/JoL/SoW/JoW as required.
---
&gt; It's slightly less raw stat wise than T1
---
Err, what? T1 has 74 str, 1% crit, 138 healing and 134 int with 8 pieces. Blue PVP set has 91 str, 56 int and 134 spelldmg with 6 pieces. I wouldn't say +78 int and +1% crit is anywhere close to 17 str and 134 spelldmg, especially considering the pvp set is two fewer items.
---
The funniest thing is, that the 6 pieces of the pvp set have nearly the same +healing as the T1 set and that also as +spelldmg.
---
The nightslayer... In bwl. Should have been MC, bud. Have my downvote.
---
Battle shout is only more threat under specific conditions. You need to buff all 5 party members every time and have less than 7 (iirc) mobs present for it to be more threat than demo shout per cast.
---
You can curse on the internet.  Don't worry little one.
---
At one point, their final word was we wouldn't be getting Classic servers. Do you remember that?
---
Great video, awesome editing and cool music :)
---
Only if you fulfill one or more of the three golden rules of twitch:
---
1) Be hilarious
---
2) Be exceptionally good at the game
---
3) Be hot (works better for women than men)
---
Health of the server.. you run the risk of a getting on one that could be max pop and likely a que just to get into the server. The experience would be terrible and you would likely have to reroll.
---
You could get on a server that ends up dieing within 6 months. You’ll likely have a 60 already and now you’ll again have to reroll or pay to switch servers. 
---
I personally played on a server in vanilla that was ended up basically dead. I had to pay for a transfer just to be able to raid and that really sucked. On top of that like many of you out there I’ve rolled on several PServers and I’ve seen what a maxed out server looks like. Leveling is next to impossible and once you hit contested zones... GL. 
---
There’s still issues with layering but I trust they will get the worst of it figured out and any problems that still exist outweigh the enormous issues that exist without it.
---
Well, lad, if you're not laughing, then the joke's on you :)
---
Where's Monk?
---
If you want my opinion, I assume it would probably be the fastest way to level as a group. Esp if you have good coordination. Solo you're prolly way better off doing quests.
---
I like to call them somewhat playfully meanly the tryahard mediocres, but alllllllll those guys will be rolling horde for racials as they absolutely must minmax. I expect a lot more horde than traditionally seen in classic.
---
That's how they have fun though so all power to em.
---
Isn't that flightpath via crossroads? So you would have to get that one as well.
---
Yeh I’m sure using rend is a much better use of my rage.
---
What do you all think of the possibility of using a bank alt as a future character? Especially if you level it to 20, 30, or 35 to max out a profession. Then when you want to actually play that instead of your main, you do and perhaps make a new bank alt.
---
I must have been mis-remembering and comparing it to some of my T2 pieces.  It's been 2-3 weeks since I actually looked at it.
---
I hate RP. No.
---
It’s not the best for ret with the fasting attack speed and no strength. Don’t get me wrong, it’s very good, but it’s not do or die like people think.
---
When you know nothing about a class, it's better to keep silent. Ret paladins never were horrific in pvp.
---
I'm playing on a private server, and it's actually not difficult to avoid. Between hillsbrad, arathi, shimmering flats, and desolace, there's plenty of quests to get you past 40
---
When you know nothing about a class, it's better to keep silent. Ret paladins never were a joke in pvp.
---
Hop on a pserver within about 5 minutes because i've been holding myself back just for classic.
---
It's typical, or even less. The double Titan panel is a bit too much but I remember having more mods than that. Add a minimap mod, damagemeters and threatmeters and different unit frames and you had my setup. 
---
Custom ui designs were a big thing even back then.
---
It is trash. I used it during the first raid of BFA every week for a few months. Randomly it would dc me from the call and force me to relaunch the bnet app to connect again.
---
Grind Grind Grind.
---
I practiced a few options for level 1-20 and there's really not much different from questing to grinding at that level if you keep up with mobs your own level.
---
Once quests die down in an area or I notice I'm competing with too many people for quest mobs I just find a corner somewhere and grind.
---
RP-PVP is the least most popular realm choice in Modern wow.
---
Less than 1% of Americas+Oceania players choose RP-PVP.
---
Less than 5% of EU players choose RP-PVP.
---
It's not even an option in Asia because they don't RP at all.
---
All told, RP-PVP makes up less than 2.5% of the active WoW playerbase in the Western world.
---
So if 20% of Europe isn't getting a server in their own language, no one is getting RP-PVP.
---
Well you gotta remember that the alternative is probably being stuck in the zerg. We can reasonably expect to have the majority of the playerbase being stuck in a big blob competing for the same mobs for at least the first 72 hours. Dungeon grinding might be bad, but it's definitely better than that.
---
WoW RP servers where silly back then, and are silly now, I will never not make fun of you guys for it! BUUUT you should have your server where you can be happy
---
Warrior/Warlock + Priest
---
Honestly as good as people will agree that warrior/priest is that iconic duo, for me mage/priest fills that. I can remember old WSG with a mage priest duo that were near unstoppable. They seem to have an answer for everything just about. And if one of you goes tailor/enchanter and the other like herb/alchemist or something you can each provide the other with wands/gear and potions. But I’m sure it will be fun regardless!
---
Let me begin by saying, Thank you very much for the feedback.  
---
&gt; I'd make a list of items and item value.
---
There is a row for that actually.  Im hoping to have some help figuring out what ratios things should be.  For example... with mining, silver, gold, truesilver... they are rare drops from the nodes, so Im not sure what their value would be.  The values may even be set based on how much we have of things.
---
&gt;Go for valuable items, instead of crap like Light Feathers and Peacebloom. Basically, drop the lvl 1-45 zones.
---
Im trying to avoid bottlenecks on things.  So the below 45 zones are going to be available to be gathered, but that's why I have them separated in brackets.  I havent decided that if each tier is going to be limited to its own currency level or if it will be a multiplier to cost to buy things out of tier.
---
&gt;With Classic, you'll have a gazillion tourists grinding low level zones, so the market will be saturated to the point where everthing will be almost free.
---
True, but at the same time the stuff from 31-45 is going to be higher value because the noobs don't get there really, and the dedicated players are going to pass through it.  
---
&gt;I would like to place a bet that says you'll end up vendoring crap, 
---
This is expected.  The donations will still be tracked however, and gold can be used to buy other resources that are needed.
---
&gt;Additionally, set a cap for every donatable item.
---
That's a superb idea.  I'm going to use that for sure. 
---
&gt;Would suck if you end up filling all your bank alts with Linen cloth. Having a max donation pr member cap before launch, avoids any drama later on.
---
We'd turn it into items, and make enchanting items out of it to fill gaps.
---
It'll most likely be rough. I'm not taking any time off on release day, just because I'd rather spend it working than being in the login queue. But I will be saving some time off for the days following, I plan on taking that Friday and Monday off and being a complete no-life piece of shit with my roommate. 
---
I mean the stress tests have been nice, frankly it's refreshing to see an MMO work this hard to insure stability. But I think it's foolish to assume launch day will be smooth. The only thing it really has going for it is being on a Tuesday, which should push some of the traffic off for a little bit.
---
In my case, these characters are only for gold making. Their equipment and positions are dedicated for this only purpose.
---
I'll create a new one for the case I want to reroll my class.
---
I never got the opportunity hitting 60 in Vanilla, but I remember dinging 70 in TBC and was ecstatic. I remember it was late at night , during the summer and the first thing I did was go up the Shat elevator. 
---
Now dinging 40 to be was way more memorable. I remember it was Sunday on a school night. It must of been 5pm (sun was out) and I remember my mom coming in my room constantly telling me to get off, but I was so close...
---
(For age purposes, I am 28 now, so I must of been 15ish? It was at the early stages of TBC when I was 40)
---
I finally did it, I dinged 40 killing the pirates outside of BB... I finally could get my mount.. I cant wait for classic.
---
Exactly. I remember the pain of leveling in STV. Never again.
---
Warrior / Shaman is better than Warrior / Priest (if you go Horde)
---
Windfury is beyond anything a priest can provide!
---
Back in my day, we used them interchangeably and no one gave a fuck. Wrath babies, I swear.
---
It's beta
---
We could just as well just force the progression to TBC for everyone and not have Classic at all anymore. Do you see the problem with this, even if it, just like your solution, doesn't split the playerbase? It obviously still splits the playerbase because the ones who don't want TBC will just quit. Just like those of us who don't want 1.14 to replace Classic will quit if you get your way.
---
Haters gonna hate lol
---
I forgot I'm going to need a new ventrillo server for Classic, to experience it all.
---
They lose against Rogue, Warrior, Mage, Warlock, Hunter, Shaman in 1v1s. They're great support classes but not strong in duels.
---
But in retail I just have my own guild bank...
---
no beta rip
---
Gotta provide some sources for those claims, don't believe it. And again, this is something that is just a flip of a switch and they'd only need one server per region if there was a population issue.
---
Only way to gain allot of exp in a dungeon run is too have all of the related quests
---
I'm pumped even though I won't get to put in serious time until that weekend.
---
You realize that doesnt make a lick of fucking sense. You're embarrassing yourself bud.
---
Ugh I dno, might be Change.org wanting to cash in - There's absolutely no need to pay to sign the petition.
---
Doing dungeons and being able to casually off tank a healing aggro'd mob while not panicking is a great feeling.
---
Oh nice, thank you.
---
Just get her a pc and a sub and play together
---
It's pretty rare on instance drops, but the randomly generated greens can have "of Healing" or "of Frozen Wrath" for +heal and +spell damage. There are some crafted items, too.
---
Stupid bitch tried to solo Onyxia.
---
And all 3 specs are good for something different.
---
SM/Ruin is a good PvP and PvE spec, DS ruin is the strongest for PvE dps, SL is really good for world pvp and 1v1, Deep destro is the best for BGs.
---
For druid, you can tank dungeons and offtank raids or even MT if your guild allows it and you have enough gear, feral DPS can be okay if you really tryhard, for pvp feral is insanely good, resto is obviously their best raid talent, a mix of balance feral and resto is the best PvP heal spec + flag carry, if you want to be a clown you can go balance.
---
Mage uses deep arcane + frost for MC and BWL and 1 mage goes deep frost, in AQ and Naxx deep fire is the best, for PvP there is the 3 minute deep arcane spec, the elemental mage spec, deep frost spec.
---
Disc priest provides power infusion, holy is the best heal spec, shadow is really good for solo PvP and shadow weaving is a must for any raid although you are probably better of using a holy weaver.
---
Paladins, despite ret being terrible DPS for PvE, people actually enjoy playing ret paladins, it's decent for PvP, prot is their best leveling spec and okay for dungeon tanking, holy obviously for healing.
---
Warriors have arms for PvP, Fury for PvE dps and prot for tanking or even go fury for tanking if your healers can handle survivability and you need more threat.
---
There is a reason to roll any of the specs in the game, it's just not a boring, every spec is good for everything bullshit you want.
---
I was ok with it until I saw the dude on a ladder with the whip.
---
horde is the PvP race all the way up until a Paladin MC helmet + BoPs your flag carrier
---
6 hours of sleep, 2 hours workout and rest gamimg? what about working? u ppl still live with ur parents and dont have jobs? :D

It's possible and probably pretty fun. Is it optimal, I doubt it. However a lot of people aren't taking into effect how hard and time consuming it may be to tag mobs or do quests on the first few weeks with the population swarming... so dungeons in a private setting with guaranteed exp seems like just as good a way to go as any
---
I mean no, but I also haven't been inhaling streamer fumes.
---
Well, it has multiple reasons. I like the news factor and I also like to sometimes read about nostalgic experiences of people. Rarely there is also a interesting objective discussion going on. And last, but not least, the insane amount of circlejerking going on here somehow entertains me.

It's not "just a flip of a switch". Blizzard wants every realm to sustain a high population throughout the lifecycle of Classic. All the numbers point to RP-PVP definitely not doing that. You'll be lucky if you have more than one realm of the 3 types available to you on launch.

I never said anything like what he claimed I did, yet he ascribes me those opinions and argues against me by arguing against that opinion.

Yeah you can't address anything I've said so you have to resort to snide comments.  Weak.  Pathetic.  But not surprising.  You're just a fanboy with as much brains as the people that ruined wow to begin with.  Frankly, people like you are why AAA games are in such a sorry state of awful quality.  Oh well.
---
Don't play there then? In fact, it might be better for you if there are RP-PVP servers.  That way people who RP won't be playing on your server.

If she's with you from level 1 to 60... Warrior. It's every warriors wet dream to have that pocket healer. Mage would be good too, though. Can play it alone or with her and always useful. Plus can teleport around for ease of travel either to catch up with her if you set a hearth on your solo adventure or w/e

Or they are counting on people being spread out by the time they remove it.
---
Because Nostralius was almost unplayable in the starter zones up until around level 20, after that it seemed to even out which is what they might be going for.
---
&gt;The player base increased through TBC and WotLK. So that should mean Vanilla and the 2 first expansions are what they should aim at releasing this time, since they were hugely successful. And in my personal opinion, WotLK was the best time in WoW's history.
---
The increase in players in WotLK is negligible compared to the growth during vanilla and BC. Going by the population data it's clear that using the vanilla-BC era as a base should be vastly more popular as WotLK was just barely able to sustain the playerbase.

Well that's after around level 30 though. Pre-30 no matter what you do it's a slog. Once you get sweeping strikes cleave and Whirl Wind and/or whirlwind axe, you become quite a strong character at killing 2-3 mobs at a time. Or even one of the best duo's with a healer as you can pull a ton and cleave them down pretty fast.

They had a to server on beta stress test

Do we know what time it's going to get released?

Depends on how fast you can run it, I used to level alts that way in classic, and if you can clear quickly it's definitely the best xp.

---
LOL that sucks. Atleast Classic will be more reliable because the framework for the servers already exists.
---
You should be a little more informed before claiming such things.
---
First off, no guild is getting 8 warriors with 4 peice before killing horsemen. You'd be waiting half a year at least.
---
Secondly, take a look at https://classicdb.ch/?item=19947
---
Okay it's been a long time, but can't you also sometimes get silver, gold, etc from the other nodes?
---
Same for me - I was REALLY exited before they announced the release date (I actually created a reddit account for r/classicwow) but after that the hype kind of died on me. 
---
Yesterday I joined my friends on a pserver ("wrong" class &amp; faction though) and I fell in love with Vanilla again.  Now I'm somewhat exited again.
---
It's on there, ctrl+f 'monk'.
---
Tuxedo Jacket is required level 30. Not many will put that time in for a bank.
---
Yes it shows on material turn in npcs
---
Why does the attackspeed matter? You have no instant attacks and SoC is ppm based,isnt it?
---
What stops EU players playing on US servers
---
You're comparing Modern WoW to Classic. There are reasons to roleplay and be social in Classic. That for the most part, no longer applies to modern WoW. Why speak to others when you can just simply que to a dungeon or LFR.
---
In Classic, there's no flying mounts or multiple worlds or queing to dungeons/raids. Everyones on the ground and you have to be social. That's what incentives roleplaying. It's no surprise to me at all that Modern WoW RP-PVP servers are dead/low in pop.
---
This is how skynet is born
---
On patch 1.12 the Tux jacket required level 30.
---
&gt;Blizzard’s belief that it won’t be popular enough to warrant its own server
---
I really wish blizzard would learn from their past mistakes. This was their exact stance on classic and now look at it.
---
Tip: Reserve one highly sought after name and sell it (let people give you gold to unlock the name) once the twink boys think it's time or people really start making alts. Names like 'Frosty' or 'Skull' will probably be worth a bunch by that time.
---
Server merges = people have naming conflicts = someone gets a new name = according to this sub community is now totally ruined.
---
You won't be any traction with an idea where server merges is baked in. People really hate that shit here.

Hail Hydra!

Hello Adventurer and welcome to the town of Honeywood.

Do not do dungeon to level no matter what any shitty guide says, unless you enjoy it.

It is slow and horrible. Anyone bother to look up a leveling guide will double or triple your leveling speed

I forget what the dire maul shen'dralar rep was for.

In all these hypothetical situations you list each player has every engi item on CD but they wouldn't have charm?

When CDEW was leveling 30-40 on the beta he was getting like 1 hour 30 minute levels. It is not as slow as you make it out to be

DONT FORGET the guards at Booty Bay fall asleep on 4th of july and New Years Eve!

It was indeed Burning Legion :)
---
Don't get me wrong, I really liked the idea of people from a nationality gathering together on one realm, and in fact my guild managed to push towards top 1% world guilds back then due to these dedicated polish people. 
---
Put it was just that some of them didn't really care to speak a common tongue at the end, thats why our guild migrated - along with our polish friends, though. Setting up shop at Genjuros.
---
But BL server had a lot of nationalities back then. We had the entirety of the Finnish community as well we were to believe, having the early iteration of paragon or something - living there as well, among other hardcore guilds.
---
Warlock/shadow priest is the best combo in the game
---
2 kids fulltime job and warrior Tank? So.. how? Are you planning on tanking Raids?
---
SKIP!
---
p servers
---
Knowing blizzard? Launch will be a cluster fuck it always is. But Im glad that they are bringing back this classic. Im really hoping that the MMO genre can learn from bringing back these old mechanics etc what really made the game great and can use this in new MMO's to come.  
---
But until then I am very excited to play this game again from the start. I never got really deep into it content wise (I think level 40 in BC and then in Cata I got to a higher level but never did adv. content) Cant wait!
---
Quit playing games and move on with my life, since that's what I was about to do before classic was announced.
---
Yeah I was trying to figure out what those numbers represented. I thought they were times at first but now I see they were referring to hours spent on action.
---
Dieser Film ist sehr gut.  Ich liebe die Kampfszenen.
---
Warlock it is!
---
It's exactly what you said :)
---
Unfortunately the block% also only increases by the same small margin as the other chances. So it really isn't much of a deal. I just mentioned it for completion.
---
Nothing, but that still doesn't give them a realm in their own language.
---
My bank ALT plan for release :
---
Orc Warlock, why..? read below.
---
day 1 - AS SOON I CAN LOG IN
---
1- create my main, run to immidiatly to the razor hill inn and log out.  (its gonna be a complete fuckest at start anyway)  
---
2- create my bank, run to immidiatly to the razor hill inn and log out.  
---
3- When Im ready to start leveling (probly the next day depeding on RL schedule)  Earthstone back to the valley and start leveling! Mail all your shit and mats to your bank meanwhile.  At lvl 5 im gonna sacrifice some time to run into ORG and learn my profession. Keep sending everything in mail buffer.
---
4- Once my main is level 8-9ish. Switch to my bank alt, earth back to the valley and start leveling with some good rested XP. Now why a warlock?  Because you get an extra quest and double the reward for killing vile familiar near the cave.  Get to level 4 and  around 1850XP (2100 to ding 5)  and leave for ORG. Discover your wait up and precisely ding lvl 5 with the 90xp for discovering ORG.  Learn Enchanting and either leatherworking or Tailoring. 
---
Open mail, start crafting and shit.. mail back a wand to your main if a caster.
---
5- Boom you got your wand lvl 8-9ish, and you have a lvl 5 bank alt with profession without too much sacrifice.  Youre good to go, start doing an very efficient leveling.
---
Thats my plan
---
Aha, and where do you get this information?
---
Rogue is ludicrous, ret paladins are one of the strongest counters to rogues. Ret is also favored against warriors and hunters.
---
Mage and warlock are pretty even.
---
Shaman and druid are unfavorable for ret.
---
Yet, the strongest counter to paladin, priest, you don't even mention.
---
And that's for the standard ret build, a reckbomb build makes the matchups against druids, shamans and mages better.
---
As I said, when you know nothing about a class, it's better to keep silent.
---
Loot council always turns to nepotism.
---
Is Revered possible?

---
I think I missed the /s on recommending horde to place a rogue inside stormwind for moonwell purpose.
---
I mean, if we want the classic experience, Alliance will outbalance the horde on most servers.
---
Nothing. But it also doesn't really have anything to do with the comment you're replying to.
---
People using a non-English client can't link items to someone using an English client (At least that's how it used to be.)
---
If there's a substantial amount of people who will be using a non-English client they probably should have their own server.
---
Zalgardis 1&amp;2 pvp vid is him using tier 0 and then in Zalgardis 3 pvp vid , i think hes using the tier 1 set with zin rokh destroyer of worlds (from zg) - so yeah... you can hand out assses instead of getting your ass handed..
---
FYI - you can still get the scepter, and do the whole chain (minus ringing the gong) after the gates open. Some of the rewards are pretty juicy, depending on the class. You will not, however, get the scarab lord title, or the mount.
---
As others have said - be prepared to sink a lot of time into the rep grind, the elites tend to drop 1-3 fragments, (I think we averaged like 1.67 fragments/kill) and you need 200 for every 500 rep, if you're a paladin, and you want to do this - be a human. 39,000 rep to get to Neutral is a lot, thats 78 turn-ins (call it 71 if you're a human). 
---
71 turn-ins with 120 kills per turn in is 8520 kills, at 78 turn-ins you're almost to 10,000 (so roll human).
---
We could do the farm with our tank, a dps and a healer (I was often ele specced, so I would help dps), but obviously the bigger group the better.
---
There's really no argument to be made that some massive contingent of RP-PVPers quit the game or transferred servers and plan on coming back to Classic only if there's RP-PVP realms.
---
There's no chance in hell that RP-PVP would ever reach the German or even French player population and they're not getting servers *in their own language*.
---
RP-PVP is just not happening. Time to get over it.
---
Thank you very much man :D
---
eh no thanks no RP server is better overall
---
As the WoW Classic announcement trailer opened with Chromie and her temporal discombobulator, I think it would be neat to see WoW Classic (eventually) move down a completely different timeline than retail has done. I mean, I don't want them to just follow in their own footsteps, that would maybe work for a TBC release but after that most of the nostalgia will be gone. Otherwise, WoW probably only has a handful of years left in it (barring an amazing and revolutionary sequel to BfA, but I'm not holding my breath).
---
So in your mind, we'd have to wait 6 months for the PvP system (not even the including battlegrounds btw), Dire Maul, and the world bosses just because the casuals are slow to level?  That's so stupid. It would be 3 months max.
---
Well of course there sources are coming from modern wow. 
---
&gt;RP-PVP is the least most popular realm choice in Modern WoW.
---
...
---
Cool to ding with an iconic character like Hemet!
---
That one Nesingwary quest with the pages and chapters in books was **very** different in Classic. I seem to recall having to gather A LOT of pages, even having to buy a few on the AH, and that they took up a good amount of bag space.
---
Paladin-Priest has some nice rp value. You can tank or dps while leveling and then both go healing at 60.
---
$3 helps to advertise the petition to others
---
Just do the right thing and replace the one RP server with RP-PVP.
---
PVE servers are already a form of RP anyway.
---

Hope the robots can play it at least :C
---
I'm getting tempted to level a bank alt druid to have both travel and moonkin forms.
---
I’m disappointed that I can’t name them all
---
I would recommend it to anyone just to keep on track and make sure you are doing quests in the same area together.
---
I've basically concluded people have no idea how to level a warrior and thus find it very painful.
---
To expand on this, comparing Classic to pservers is bad practice as they will be different, both in gameplay and community. But an even more grievous error would be comparing it to vanilla; the knowledge gap between then and now is extreme. If you expect Naxx to be even remotely difficult when compared to any content wow has released in the last decade, you'll be sorely disappointed.
---
I think I must be one of the only people not excited for Classic. I've played since Vanilla and I really don't want to go back and do it again - I hate levelling alts now, even with all the ways they've made it 'easier'.
---
I'm in a similar situation as OP with the priest wife. My idea was going warrior, but I really don't think I have enough time to dedicate to playing a warrior... 2-3 hours a night 4 nights a week with some weekend time sprinkled in. I've been considering warlock. Only two more months to change my mind 100 more times!
---
I’ll have to build a computer by then. I’m also having my first child a month later so I’ll have about another month of paternity leave and babysitting. Hopefully he sleeps a lot.
---
depends on how you define unplayable. Some quests still took forever to finish on K3 today
---
Dingshot!
---
You work 12 hours a day everyday ? Between commuting and getting ready for work...do you live like that year round ? If so that fuckint sucks mab
---
Both Feel Good Inc and Fire Coming Out of the Monkeys Head by Gorillaz remind me of Redridge.  
---
Word Up by Korn reminds of Raven Hill Cemetery in Duskwood.
---
I'm really interested in seeing warrior macros. Especially stance dancing macros for tanking.
---
PTSD from those gorillas.  They come out of NOWHERE.
---
And those pages... oh my god... those pages....
---
Run/swim from the starting zone to Ratchet then fly to Org. Senjin Village didn't have a flight path until Cata.
---
&gt;can I ask what should I be sending to my bank alt?
---
That depends on you personally, most folks send mats and items for sale on the AH.  But you can send whatever you like.
---
&gt;Mail costs money though right so is there a minimum level of stuff or price of stuff I should send over?
---
I know it was 30c to mail in Vanilla, but you could only do 1 item at a time.  Apparently, you could send up to 12 items at a time in the Beta but I am unsure of the cost.  As far as being a minimum level of stuff, no as long as the item is not BoP you can send it to the bank alt.
---
&gt;Should I just empty my bags every time I get to the mailbox?
---
Sell what you want to the vendor (if there is a mailbox, there should be a vendor close by) and send anything else to your bank alt.  Personally, I sell all gray and white items and all greens and crafting mats to my bank alts.  Some folks don't send greens and would rather sell them to a vendor but with there being no enchanting level requirement in Classic, you should make your bank alt an enchanter and just DE all those so you don't have to buy mats for your enchants.
---
In the first example you only care about the statistical variance of the gold per hour, choosing the one with less. In the second example you are just comparing the expected amount of gold per hour. Neither of those rely on the chance of getting 1 drop within x amount of kills.
---
Sorry to hear about your warrior's ear injury =P.   
---
Soloing I assume?
---
I shamelessly borrowed from my super dedicated friend. Only managed to return 300ish gold back. He was spending all his non raiding hours in Tyr's Hand.
---
This is one of those things I wouldn’t be surprised if Blizzard said was intentional. I seem to remember delays like this when I played my hunter. I think it depends on when during your shot timer you use a new ability. It just waits the remaining time you had to shoot again.
---
It’s definitely boring I always found success in watching tv turning up the volume on wow and waiting for the sound of a fish jumping out of the water then click and repeat.
---
We don't because it would be bad for the community.
---
More trolls, more politics, more bullshit.
---
Not worth it.
---
Back in the day this had everything. Suspense, detail, perfect finish. This machinima always stood out for being so well done and longer than others.
---
Clap is battle stance only and does bascially no damage, you use your shouts and cleave to generate AoE threat.
---
Thank your! That actually motivated me very much!
---
They’ve seen what you nasty dirty heathens really do on rp realms. 
---
/s
---
I disagree
---
Real question: what would happen if they postpone the release? Now that everyone has put in their requested vacation days... think of the backlash.
---
[Here's](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Multiboxing) a start. Many use software like [ISBoxer](http://isboxer.com).
---
yes, one PC is best... you need extra software that sends the buttons you press to both wow clients. There was also an addon that helped with quest givers and looting.
---
Keybind some abilities on the healer with macros to cast heals on the warrior or on himself. For attack abilities set focus to the warrior then macro target &gt; focus target
---
Who gives a damn about the German or French players, there's a big enough community for NA players without a doubt and you know that.
---
I am not into RP personally, but it makes the world more alive imo. It's great. Emerald Dream-US is the best server I've ever played on.
---
Wife is going to go warlock, so my plan would be to rush holy for concencration (that+fire shield+ reign of fire for maximize AOE leveling).  Already planned on picking up divine intellect and other healing based talents en route to concencration.
---
My Sheep have run amok! If you could be so kind to find the for me and I will reward you greatly.
---
On the stress test I got a firewall prompt for blizzard's voice chat service when I grouped up. So it was in the stress test.
---
This is the kind of info I was hoping to see back, other people's input. I'll check out that channel today as well
---
Well of course but my point still stands, they're different games. Classic incentives social interaction and roleplaying, modern wow doesn't.
---
Don't thank no crediting OP Thank Savix! :D
---
The Ping.
---
You really expect us to play with 200 ping consistently? I know I don't want that
---
You guys really helped me with those comments. Can’t wait to launch this fucking game!
---
Lol healing* but yeah I’ll be soloing. My friend might play classic too and maybe my cousin but all our schedules are so complicated nowadays that if we tried to seriously level together it’d take forever. If they play maybe we’ll make our characters just to play together casually.
---
I think that he has more important things in his life.
---
Just wanted to say I'm excited. Also today is my birthday and next month on the 27th is my wedding.
---
27ths are just big for me I guess.
---
Bull shit. It can be learned. Everyone who used it had to learn it at some point and some how. This guy is on the right track by trying to get information about it.
---
Well - at least we won't have Queue times thanks to Layering
---
Not if you rotate your council.
---
I will be holding off till the calm Dow,  I've decided if the stress test reminded me of anything, that mob sharing is amazing
---
EU and NA have almost identical playerbases. Blizzard definitely gives a damn about German or French players more than they care about RP-PVP players. But they don't give enough of a damn to give them servers in their own language.
---
Exactly this. I have a high quality mic set up, which makes it loud, but clear. People need to be able to turn my volume down or i will be speaking to them with the voice of God, lol.
---
Might as well just make a hunter so you have aspect of the cheetah.
---
Thought the same thing hah, brings me back.
---
Rumor is the guy is working at Disney now.
---
Account sharing is against the rules.
---
Past that, google it.  ISBoxer is a semi-ok program but costs money.  I dropped it because it tries to configure too much stuff in the background and reserves hotkeys without being particularly well documented.  Auto Hot Key you can set up to handle things, but there’s a time investment involved in learning how to set it up.  There are a couple of others I have no experience with.  Or you could alt tab a bunch.
---
I fully plan on making my human warrior "Orcgasm" and anytime I kill literally anyone in PVP I'll press a macro that makes me yell "I JUST HAD AN ORCGASM!"
---
#NOCHANGES except for #MYCHANGES
---
That's fine, but I want transmog if we are gonna start adding things
---
That's actually super cool
---
If you don't mind turning into animals, I would want you to consider playing a druid.
---
Similar advantages as a warrior, when it comes to tanking while having a much better solo-performance. Also you won't be having as much of an issue of wanting the same gear that you'd have with another clothie.
---
And when it comes to end-game, both of you can go to healing again.
---
your*
---
"For my wife and *me*," you mean.
---
You wouldn't say "I hope Michael's can have this made for I." 
---
You need the objective case since (me) since "me" is going to be the object of the prepositional phrase, "for me."
---
As much as I wish that the RP-PvP enthusiasts got their own server option, I agree with Blizzard's decision not to include one. If WoW Classic lives or dies by server communities, that goes doubly so for RP servers in Classic WoW. 
---
Each split of the RP community (each additional server after the 1st) incurs a drastic risk of it's gradual erosion on all servers. The best possible chance the RP community has to thrive in Classic is to remain as centralized and homogenous as possible.
---
No plan to RP, but a RP-PVP server always attracted the coolest players. I'm sad it wont be a thing.
---
This is what I worry about. I barely had enough time for BFA, and I've been trying to get my shit together since then which will leave less time for gaming. Thinking I'll just make a PVP character and level/play at my own pace instead of trying to stay ahead of the PVE curve.
---
My Bank Alt in classic also doubled as my twink.
---
lol is this a real thing?
---
Well I already see some red flags but thats my opinion. I hope he can manage it and gets it to work. I tried to help him by giving some info I know.
---
I also really enjoyed TBC, but I feel like classic plus has a much bigger potential. TBC was a very complete game, but it ruined a lot of the game too. It was like 10 steps forward and 5 steps back. I think Classic plus has the ability to take those 10 steps forward.
---
Guy named “LobotomizedCock” demanding people give him his own personal ERP server...
---
Hard pass.
---
Whatttt
---
Super pumped. 30, engaged, full time office job plus a side gig. but on August 27th everything will change!
---
Jeez dude. Relax
---
That entirely depends on other mages. If they can keep their portals in their pants or demand payment, we won't all be whispered 24/7 in IF for free portals, food and water.
---
There's just a ton of UD rogues around. Also if it was some try hard dwarf with faps, he probably would just shred the orc anyway.
---
There's ways to get out of stuns. There's not many items that reliably take off bleeds, or multiple stacks of poisons.
---
With the world buff exploit and buying gold, are you really telling me the rules matter at all anymore?
---
wtb gf
---
No problem, happy to help. :) 
---
Just make sure, that if you go for the PVP set, to get a decent amount of crit chance on the rest of your items as no crit is the sets biggest weakness. Apart from that, it really is excellent for ret. Same applies, if you were to go for T2 and want to pvp with that.
---
Yes? People have been doing exactly that for over a decade now. Raids are fun, but they are very temporary, and the only way you keep people engaged is if you constantly release new raids (see: modern wow).
---
Yes and your only evidence of this is from BFA. A game that removed social interaction for the most part vs Classic, where social interaction is what it's all about. It's all about the community.
---
No. You’re Breathtaking! 😆
---
Any word on oceanic servers?
---
It precisely does work like that. Either you have a genuine and immersive world, or we can all teleport in and out of different realities at will - and make no mistake, we can. People have been abusing it a ton on the beta. It would be nice to think it was some perfect system, but it brings real issues with it.

**Tenacious Gamers - NA | Classic | Horde | PvP**
---
https://www.tenaciousgamers.com
---
Guild Master: LoanWolf
---
**WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE TENACIOUS?**
---
Tenacious is a long tenured, multi-platform gaming community of friends and like-minded gamers from around the world. We aspire to be extraordinary, to love our members as people as well as gamers, and to change the world around us. The gaming world knows our name, respects our reputation and our members wear our tag with pride and humility. We are large enough to have a server dominant and guild capped presence in multiple games, yet never so large that we forget our roots, never so large that we don't slow down and get to know our members as friends. We came for the gaming, but we stayed for the remarkable family we found.
---
From the seeds of an idea in 2009 to becoming the premier destination for the multi-core gamer, Tenacious has solidified its reputation as a sanctuary for gamers of all abilities who were looking for something more than 'just a guild'. From the casual to the casually accomplished to the hardest of hardcore, Tenacious offers a gaming experience like no other. No matter your play style or your 'core', you are sure to find a peer group in these halls. Where other guilds and organizations are erected for one game, and die with that game, Tenacious has stood the test of time, bound together by the quality of our members, the friendships we forged and the epic times that we share.
---
We are blessed with an international roster of amazing people, most of whom spend their time together in and out of gaming. We pride ourselves on our commitment to each other, our community service and the rage &amp; drama free gaming environment that we've created. Come as you are, be who you are.
---
**TENACIOUS IN WORLD OF WARCRAFT: CLASSIC**
---
If you’re looking for a guild of adult gamers that understand real life comes first, but doesn’t use that as an excuse to be mediocre gamers - look no further. Tenacious is pushing the limits of what people have come to expect from a casual guild.
---
Being a casual guild - to us, at least - does not mean we do not have goals. It does not mean we do not care about progression. It does not mean we do not try our best. It does mean that we won’t force a certain playstyle or skill requirements, because we understand real life obligations take priority. Because we welcome all kinds of players who want to create friendships and have fun. Because your gear doesn’t define who you are as a friend, or as a guildmate. Because we want you to be in for the long haul.
---
You’ll improve. We’ll improve. We’ll grow and better ourselves together. And make no mistake: When shit needs to get done, we will get it done.
---
In Tenacious, no matter how you come to us, you will progress. You will experience everything the game has to offer. And you will have a blast doing it.
---
**WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT**
---
... Organized, involved leadership
---
... Discord server
---
... Website forums
---
... Active player base
---
... Class mentorship
---
... Community events
---
... And most importantly, a friendly and welcoming group of friends to enjoy this wonderful game (and many more) with
---
Preliminary raid times: 9PM EST (we're still working to figure out what times work best for everyone)

---
See you in the game!
---
i mostly did my 15-58 in dungeons because solo leveling without interacting with people was boring to me. So even if it is slower it kept me going.
---
 if you have a constant group that will stick around for hours a day then you will be so much faster then having to go to a capital to replace your tank after every run. So that's awesome.
---
depending on your faction and level make sure to know when you need to keep spare gear. There can be a lot of running back and fourth if you need to repair.
---
"Riders on the Storm" but "Gankers on the Horde"
---
Goldshire whores! Rise up!
---
Again, there's no argument to be made that more people will refuse to play Classic because there's no RP-PVP servers than there are people that will refuse to play Classic because there's no servers in their native language.
---
&gt;Looking for help with chosing an alt class for farming and casual lvling with my friends
---
Warlock for solo DM runs for mad gold.
---
I don't even want people to have the option. It ruins the visuals of the game imo. Something just bugs me about everybody seeing different things.
---
The real pro tips are in the comments
---
I know this is a joke but this is what bugs me the kept about reddit, every time you try to do something good everyone's gotta bring up your lobotomized cock...
---
They don't want to split the RP community, that's the only reason. Furthermore, a lot of times PvP players start playing on RP-PvP because it's less toxic and so the RP element tends to die down on such servers. Sorry, it won't happen because Blizzard understands these issues and what's historically happened, see Emerald Dream (US)

With a group like that, you should be okay. Leveling in a dungeon with four people might be faster than grindquesting in the world.

Justification well delivered. But don’t think blizz is moved by whats going on here ):
---
What's swing time?
---
Don't you need to unlock the Org fly path before?
---
Again, that did not and has not ever worked like that.  A flightpath is fixed no matter what.  You will not and can never have it diverted.  There is literally no situation in the game where you have a flightpoint from A to B, then get one for C and go A-&gt;C-&gt;B.  That does not exist.  You aren't remembering correctly.
---
Rogue is probably the least wanter, therefore, the most competitive class in the entire game. Mage is also abit easier to be good at.
---
Fun is measured differently by different people. I don't expect to be able to level efficiently or really at all that first day, but exp and leveling progress aren't going to be what makes that initial rush enjoyable to me.
---
Grouping with people to complete the most mundane stuff is what sounds fun to me. Or grouping with strangers so we can go kill level 5 mobs from the get go to try and sneak in some exp from the second zone. Having 1,000 people to duel against between levels 1 and 5.... 
---
It took me basically 15 hours to get to level 15 on the most recent stress test, starting immediately at server open. I enjoyed all of that time even though Northshire was crowded as hell and trying to complete a level 1 kobold quest would take something close to 30 minutes.
---
A lot of people view not being able to tag mobs and complete quests as not being able to play the game, but to me engaging with the community and laughing at the absurdity of 700 new recruits killing boars and scorpions in the valley of trials IS playing the game.
---
I never once said that people would refuse to play Classic because there aren't RP-PVP servers. People will obviously still play, it's just a big mistake on Blizzards part.

---
Cant believe we are wasting 2 months waiting
---
Yeah, I whole heartedly support this. I've always prefered either RP servers or RP-PVP preferably, just for that added feeling of immersion knowing that you're mostly playing with like minded players.. people who want to get into the world and lose themselves in it even if they aren't "RPers" of any other fashion. 
---
It's nice just not seeing a bunch of silly troll names around -all- the time.
---
It shows the time between white attacks for melee classes. Similar to a cast bar, but for melee attacks.
---
Great for timing attacks for hamstring kiting/pvp
---
No, each race has its capital city as a flight point unlocked at creation.
---
What are your thoughts on Paladin + Shadow Priest?  My buddy is rolling Paladin, he's gonna go prot/holy and tank instances.  I'll heal our instance groups or dps if we find a Warrior tank.  But I was also leaning rolling a Warlock instead of the Spriest (but I fear that Mind Control is too much fun).
---
No it doesn't. But this topic IS specifically about optimization.
---
I seriously doubt you have 200ms ping to US servers. Try it yourself, the IP is 24.105.62.129.
---
In all likelihood, it's less than 100ms.
---
And just remember that every Central and South American player has a larger ping and always will (all their realms are hosted in Los Angeles). And when Blizzard announces no Classic realms for Oceania hosted in Sydney, all of Australia and the rest of that area will be connecting to Los Angeles too.
---
Rather have class than be crass, brøther :p
---
There are some great single player games being made by Sony's first party studios.  Red Dead Redemption 2 was pretty amazing as well, but I would agree as far as multiplayer gaming is concerned.  Nothing has interested me in that market since I stopped playing WoW back in WotLK.
---
This is a nice little bubble to live in, but there's a dangerous amount of soap in that water. The reality outside of it is that, when something is broken, it is indeed broken whether you want it to be so or not. We all want classic to be a good game, but there's a ton of things wrong with it and a genuinely low commitment from activision blizzards side, so it may well be a rather disappointing event.
---
Agreed. Honestly if you’re contemplating it might as well go 11/5/35 and just live in dungeons or keep MS 31/20 for PVP and keep separate tank gear.
---
Professions were the reason why I never had enough gold to buy an epic mount in vanilla.
---
If people are still going to play, they're still going to pay. So no, it's not really a mistake at all on Blizzard's part.
---
As a private server player, I typically get 120-ish ping on most private servers since they're almost all in France for some reason. It's jarring playing on the few North American servers out there
---
What world buff exploid?
---
Gold buying is against the rules.
---
Acc sharing is against the rules.
---
There are automated bans for these if they catch something fishy. The risk is high.
---
But do what ever you wand but getting you friend to lose its account is not fun to explain to him.
---
It's not looking hopeful. I suggest picking a unofficial PvP realm for RP as soon as the realm name list is released. I really hope they do it well before release so there is time for such things to be decided by the player base.
---
Then feel free to just go get yourself a bot.  I don’t care if you get your friend’s and possibly your account banned.
---
The moment when you as a resto shaman start looking into more +healing instead +mp5 :)
---
No, not really.  But the exact things your listing is why I’ve had beta access for around a month or so now and haven’t logged in once.  I want my hype and excitement to be used up on the actual game leveling chars I actually get to keep.  Leveling burnout is a a real thing for a lot of people (myself included) and I think a lot of people rushed into the beta in a short sighted manner and killed their excitement and hype along the way.
---
Pretty much all greens should be DE'd especially when you get into the lvl 50+ greens as they give the mats you will need for your pre-raid enchants.  
---
As far as what to sell, lvl 50+ green nature resist and frost resist items sell well once AQ and Naxx drop but they are a long time out and the market will probably be flooded initially since people know to sell them once the raids drop.  Some blue items fetch a nice price on the AH so I would not DE those items, just check the AH for the item and undercut the lowest one on the AH.  Always sell epics.  Certain food items sell really well too, been a long time and don't remember the exact ones, you would have to look up what items are needed for food buffs.  
---
On launch, a lot of the low level items will sell well as people are going to be buying items off the AH for actual gear upgrades.  After a couple of months this will die off and pretty much all low level items will not be worth the deposit you have to put up for the AH.  This will be a fluid situation depending on each server, so YMMV.  Cooking items (fish, meat from beasts, etc) usually sell well for people trying to speed level cooking but again that depends on the server.  Cloth will sell well at launch for first aid training but again after a couple of months it will die down and only runecloth will sell well for bandages/war effort.  IIRC each war effort turn in gives rep with the city you turn it into faction but I am not 100% certain of that.
---
Must have talent for AOE tanking and very effective! For your wifes char: Not too sure on this, but maybe letting the pet tank and you putting out as much dmg as possible and healing the pet would make more sense (if you are not planning to do a lot of instances). 
---
Sounds like a fun duo to do in classic!
---
I'm just posting because you asked for sources their claims then once provided decided it no longer mattered even though they were referencing numbers on modern wow for their entire comment.
---
I can't wait for Classic but the number of people who want Blizzard to cater this experience specifically to them is pretty impressive.
---
Aacck..didn’t even notice autocorrect killed me. Thanks for noticing!
---
&gt;Death effect and map markers in classic.
---
sure, bro.
---
Good thing it's CGI and robots are far inferior than this... for now
---
The joy of playing a healer results mostly from how well you manage your mana.
---
Timing your heals in a way that you don't create overheal, using the 5-second-rule to regenerate mana, using the right heals in the right situations.
---
The combination of skill and gear can lead you being able to do your job for a really long time without ever running out of mana.
---
An AV bot is a great idea actually.
---

---
do you have other arguments?
---
Wrong, you clearly don't understand the point of Classic. Social interaction, roleplaying and faction wars is what it's all about. 
---
People don't like Classic because it's hard, its not even hard compared to Mythic raiding. It's the community. Anyone who played the game knows this.
---
Great thanks for the info. It will be interesting to see if that 12 stack thing remains. Do you send any crafting regent, or just the ones you know will sell? Thanks !
---
There are packs of non-elite wasps too. You still need few people for easier progress but it's doable.
---
You might find that to be hard to do in Feralas
---
Honestly my friend, tank Paladin mostly doesn't work. You drink on almost every pull, use your bop as an aggro drop cuz you have no taunt. Most people like to go go go but you cant with a paladin tank. If you wanna tank go druid or Warrior, I'm planning on tanking as druid on my way up for example. If you still wanna go pala, you can play healer very well.
---
Our plan involved the imp, due to fire shield, increased stamina, and eventually soul link for a Mana battery
---
Ret paladins were terrible in vanilla, dude.
---
This is what happens when you read too much reddit. Yes ret Paladins aren’t good at PVE DPS, however a Ret paladin in PvP can be a force to be reckoned with. Especially if they’re clever enough to know when to support and when to charge in.
---
Just tested it, it's 120.
---
Not too bad, but I know that I probably cannot PvP with that ping, especially if im used to having 30 \^\^
---
The Dark Souls series my friends...Dark Souls games are masterpieces.  I played Dark Souls 3 for 2800 hours in total.
---
That’s cool and all but they need to remake the game from the ground up in a new game engine.
---
That's a counter example though. That'd just reinforce that they do what they want anyway.
---
anyone god paladin macros? while were on the subject
---
Are u eu?
---
I get 160 on averga on germany pinging that
---
he should be wearing bloodfang hood. I don't think I ever saw anyone wearing a full set of nightslayer before they got the hood from Ony!
---
If you mean 1 button that casts only riposte if it's available, but not SS, then no, that is not possible in Classic. However you can still just make a macro that casts both at once, SS always, Riposte only when it has procced together with SS(since it is off the GCD).
---
Wouldn't recommend it though, just get an extra keybind.
---
i hope crap like this is on the bottom of the list for blizzard. Hows about you let them work on core game play issues (hunters) first.
---
You would follow that criminal fraud lol. This change happened precisely because people called out on it, rather than remain willfully ignorant. All the same, people will learn this internal cooldown and the problem will persist, only diminished. More fixes needed.
---
Truefaith vestments is an example where you don't need tailor to wear it, only to make it. 
---
Between looking at that and another example where you need to wear it with the skill it should make sense in all cases.
---
It's funny because it's true.
---
Fucking can't wait for these soap operas
---
Came in TBC
---
Lol ret Paladins eat rogues and a lot of those losses you mention are pretty even.
---
You don't get to tell people what "the point of Classic" is. That changes for everyone you ask.
---
And it still doesn't matter. Blizzard won't lose more than their lunch money not giving Germany and France and Oceania their own servers. Not giving people RP-PVP servers is like refusing to bend over to pick up a nickel on the street.
---
They don't care.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=3075
---
You would have to level up you bank alt, but if you want to truly ball out by equipping an epic just for a bank alt.
---
I mean, there's no reason they couldn't do that AND what I suggested.
---
2 monitors mate.. you'll never look back.
---
I think he´s referring to the people that want an english speaking sever only, since the EU realms will be filled with different languages.
---
No no, I meant "no weekend" because it's the only moment where I can stay with my wife (and not all of them since she live far away) :)
---
Just signed a Petition to impeach trump, rppvp server petition pops up after.
---
Rogue is more proactive and Mage is more reactive.
---
I'd say overall mage is easier. Simply because mage is ranged. Being ranged means there's a bigger error-margin. If you misjudge a situation as a rogue, you might not make it out alive. If you misjudge a situation as a mage, you still have a good chance of getting away.
---
Honestly thinking about going on a pve server after playing pvp exclusively. I just don't want to waste my hour or 2 a night I have to play on 10+ minute corpse runs after being ganked.

It's just insane they want to go international only. 
---
Look at the number of German posts alone, there will be ten thousands of German players, WoW was and is still big here. 
---
This decision was made by some higher up from the US without ANY knowledge, nor regard to the EU community.
---
It's so frustrating, put a region code besides the server name, FFS Blizzard.
---
&gt; there's a big enough community for NA players without a doubt and you know that.
---
Gotta provide some sources for those claims.
---
&gt;Grouping with people to complete the most mundane stuff is what sounds fun to me. Or grouping with strangers so we can go kill level 5 mobs from the get go to try and sneak in some exp from the second zone. Having 1,000 people to duel against between levels 1 and 5.... 
---
Well, in my experience it is more about "waiting in queue" followed by server downs, lag and having to sit around, starring on the monitor to click fast enough to get that mob tag.
---
&gt;A lot of people view not being able to tag mobs and complete quests as not being able to play the game, but to me engaging with the community and laughing at the absurdity of 700 new recruits killing boars and scorpions in the valley of trials IS playing the game.
---
I guess we are different kind of people. For me a normal chat client like discord does the same thing. I don't have to start a game for this.
---
No, because you’re probably using a third party program to get 5 different characters to use their abilities simultaneously. If I use a hack to make my 1 key launch 5 frost bolts at the same time, it’s cheating, and me saying “well just because you can’t justify paying for this program doesn’t mean I’m cheating” doesn’t change that one bit. You can do all the mental gymnastics you want to try to justify it, but multiboxxing goes against the spirit of the game, and more than likely it goes against the TOS too.
---
TBC and WOTLK will absolutely work.
---
Ahh, gotcha, I've never really pvp'd so It makes sense now why I haven't really heard of it lol
---
Not really, u have the exact thing I said if you just scroll up for half a second. 
---
I never told anyone to stfu, I never told anyone not to voice their opinion. I support all of these things but what I said was that ree ing about it after they’ve already said no won’t make them change their opinion.
---
You probably didn't have a 30 ping when 400ms spell batching was a thing.
---
I did ask for sources, yes but realized it doesn't even matter because they're completely different games at this point.
---
I also don't understand how this is an experience thats catered towards me specifically when RP-PVP servers were a thing during Vanilla WoW.
---
Hi, /u/delaurentism

Dude delete this. wtf
---
\#NotOnRetail
---
It will be this time, there are lists everywhere.
---
A guide to bank alts... I don't even..
---
That's all fine and good for English speakers, but doesn't have any bearing for non-English speakers. Which is a larger playerbase than RP-PVP by at least a factor of 10.
---
yikes
---
Except that re-releasing something is a lot easier and far far far less expensive.
---
I have no idea to be honest, I was too young to remember my ping back then. I am used to Private servers and retail though, I can just imagine that its gonna be fairly hard to hit grenades when I have a high ping AND simulated spellbatching.
---
Go look up ANYONE who changed their mind on Classic WoW, they always bring up the community and social interaction. This is a fact, you can't argue here.
---
It will be all the same. Their commitment to classic seems extremely lackluster. Rather than passionate developers and a company dedicated to quality and gameplay, we get whatever their profit algorithms will give us, as well some small things here and there to keep the sheep sheared.
---
Why is grim batol showed as used? You can't go there in vanilla right? Wasn't there some kind of huge ass door?
---
or I just disagree with the point.
---
Wow imagine that.
---
I always use a 29 twink for a bank alt that way I have whatever low level speed boosts available. At start I expect to see alot of level 1 dwarf bank alts
---
If they build it off of wow classic they cant redo the engine. A true wow redo needs to be a new game entirely.
---
I'm not disagreeing with that. I'm just concerned about how long they can get away with doing that.
---
If you go warrior and she’s priest, you won’t have to sit around for waiting on either a tank or healer for groups. Plus warriors are good dps, so you’ll be able to farm/grind/dungeon easily and make good use of your time. Plus, as the two roles that set the pace of a dungeon, you’ll be able to further make efficient use of your limited time.
---
It is ok, there will be simcraft classic that will answer those questions but if you are going fury I am willing to be it is the hit neck.
---
Divinity: original sin 2 is keeping my sanity in tact.
---
Fucking insane game and Larian are now doing Baldurs gate 3. Life isn't all bad.
---
TBC is a strong argument, I don't know if I agree that WotLK would see the same turnout. But, the potential is definitely there.
---
What I do for my warlocks is have a list of things I want them to check off. So i.e. general enchants, ZG enchants, Rockfury Bracers, AQ20 spells, pre-BiS, AV exalted etc. This list is published and whenever a warlock has completed one of these goals they poke me and I'll change it. You can further granulate the enchants by having the weapon enchant be a separate thing since it's quite expensive and maybe not worth putting on a blue. 
---
Then I have a sheet with every item in the game on rows and columns with every raid and if a warlock (or mage since we share the sheet) gets an item I put it in there, that way I can see who has gotten items recently and what items they got. 
---
I also have an attendance page with two different values. Basically you get 1 points for being there the entire raid, 0.5 points for most of the raid, 0 points if you're not there but let the guild know beforehand i.e. signed up as absent, and -1 point for not showing up without notice. We're trying to encourage people to sign up so we can get an idea of what raid to do. 
---
I also keep a log of each warlock's performance where I grade them 1-5, being a teacher this is quite easy for me. It's important though to not only look at the raw damage of a warlock. Obviously gear matters too. Instead I like to look at casts. How many shadowbolts did he throw? How many corruption ticks? Etc. I use CT_Raid to check their consumables and soulshards. Sometimes I'll give them a plus for excellent performance or a minus if they failed something. Pulling aggro gives you a minus, taking over tanking on Twin Emps because one of the lock tanks died gives you a plus. 
---
So that gives me a good overview of what warlock deserves what loot. The mage CL does the same with his mages and we usually do it together after the raid, it's just easier that way. He might see a warlock mistake that I missed and vice versa.
---
Can't wait to play a blood elf rogue in classic!
---
wotlk was the peak of wow.
---
Im in full t3 on a private fun server and even with ruin shadowbolt crit is max 2500 lol (if you have curse of shadows and shadow weaving on the target then prob max 3500).
---
In t2/zg stuff 4-5k crit is nonsense sorry. Without ruin (aka as sl) even more...
---
okay bro
---
If we even see TBC classic, we will probably be lucky.
---
I'm a fucking idiot for never knowing why so many people had bank alts. Don't have to carry around shit you want to sell in the AH.
---
I was just one of those idiots who always had bags full of crap.
---
You say of course they are, but it is an important distinction. Vanilla wow was an MMO-RPG. Try and make the same case for modern wow being so! It's a q-hub simulator action games, just look at the bloody talents xd
---
Modern macro API is so streamlined you can pretty much guess what you want to write and it might work. 
---
In your case;
---
    /petattack
---
    /cast *spellname*
---
or if you want something fancier,
---
    /petattack [@pettarget, noexists]
---
this will make your pet attack your current target, and even if you yourself swap targets, your pet will continue attacking the target he already has. You will need another set of pet commanding macros/keybinds to go with this type of macro(2 keybinds, /petattack and /petpassive), I prefer this type since it provides more control and your pet isn't running around like a headless chicken whenever you are dotting stuff up as a Warlock. You can also just skip the /petattack keybind and just have /petpassive keybound and hit that and then your offensive spell with above macro line to make your pet swap targets.
---
This will be a robot propaganda video
---
I just wish they’d get a different voice actor. He sounds so... idk
---
Not sure about that guy, but bear in mind most streamers played lvl 30 for weeks and got BiS, normally you'll still have empty slots and garbage greens on through your 30s, a lot slower to level with ass gear
---
Sounds like togc all over again.
---
I hated togc
---
I changed my mind about Classic WoW without ever once considering the community and social interaction. Just because I didn't post on YouTube doesn't make my opinion invalid.
---
And yet, you're just deviating from the argument. Blizzard is NOT going to release RP-PVP servers.
---
Prevent that from the beginning by having names unique across all servers so there is only ever one character or guild named u/hollahollagotnodolla
---
While enemies in RP, Paladin &amp; Warlock are great when paired together. The lock can go nuts dotting and tapping and raining/hellfiring, and the Palie can do his thing, playing with aggro and white damage, tossing salvation, ret aura, consecrating, healing, and bubbling/rezzing when things get way out of hand or the lock pancakes.  Once the lock gets DS, I'm hoping the Palie can still rez it again and keep the buff like worked in true vanilla, but still have the pet out too for the double buff.
---
High ping = classic. They should be throttling everyone’s ping and fps to keep it #nochanges.
---
It’s a flick of a switch to make a German server but they don’t want even if there’s probably 50x more people interested.
---
Blizzard apparently try to open the minimum of servers they can and not divide player base. Maybe after sometime after release if they must open new server, they will think about it (a good way to encourage people to restart and therefore stay)
---
Get them deviate fish boi $$$
---
You probably know, but these videos are based on the Boston Dynamics videos, where they occasionally trip the robots or nudge them haha: https://youtu.be/fRj34o4hN4I
---
That would be amazing. How about just hijack the site and make every petition rppvp
---
Thank you for the detail in your response, very helpful!
---
Don't you think we are past due for World of Warcraft 2?   Instead of this same old engine?
---
I don't see a reason to downvote here.
---
We absolutely do not know how many servers they are planning so far. If it's less than 5 we're fucked either way. 
---
The second part is also true, while I wouldn't say 90% in this case the majority will still be clueless.
---
Well, all the NA players on PServers have about the same ping as you would connecting to official NA servers and they seem to PVP just fine.
---
Kinda. In battle grounds alliance is naturally more defensive and horde is naturally more aggressive due to the exclusive dynamics of Paladins and shamans. From a Druid perspective that’s about it. I guess, if you’re going as DPS feral you will need to farm a ton of crowd pummelers from Gnomergon so I think as alliance that’s easier to do. For PvE tanking alliance is slightly better for free damage mitigation with nelf dodge% but pvp can technically be better as horde because of the Tauren health bonus because stamina is one of the most valued pvp stat.
---
Leeway and trap sharing dr with scatter shot is what you have to be worried about.
---
Wat
---
Did you play vanilla WoW? Ret has a 0% chance of losing to warrior. You could beat a grand marshal warrior with an arcanite reaper and dungeon crap. Half the classes in the game have to reset a fight and heal up after baiting cooldowns like bubble to have a chance at beating ret paladins. Heck, a ret paladin wearing their healing gear with a 2Her was nigh unbeatable for most melee because they'd save bubble for the reset attempt and use it as a CC immunity to finish you off. Even worse, a ret paladin wearing half healing, half dps (basically t1 and ZG gear) wearing any 1H weapon with a life drain proc and that engineering shield would kill most melee with return damage even if they just sat there autoattacking and healing.
---
Ret paladins are horrid, even worse than rogues in organized PvP, but they are very good at 1v1ing. The only things they can't beat are priests and soul link locks. The major reason why they are shit in group PvP is because they can't deal consistent damage and get turned into NPCs by the mana drain/ignore the ret paladin strategy because they have no dps on demand.
---
Do we really want to split the playerbase with such nonsense?
---
I'm rolling a Murloc Shadow Hunter
---
Okay dude. 
---
Why is it that i always see forum posts, reddit posts, youtube videos all requesting RP-PVP realms? It is without a doubt, a wanted feature. Go look it up, you'll see nothing but support for it.
---
There's without a doubt a request for them and they existed during vanilla wow.
---
He thinks he does, but he doesn't.
---
Woo! My first server was Emerald Dream. I played on there until 3 years ago when i switched to Aerie Peak for the raiding scene.
---
The disadvantage of being a gnome is being a gnome. That's it.
---
September 2nd is Labor Day so some people get that off regardless. I took off the 3rd and 4th so I’ll get that 5 days off
---
I usually play druid on private servers. Their damage is fairly low tho. I wouldn't considered them the best class in the game.
---
Maybe the best petition is to not buy a subscription? Maybe uh...
---
They can't fuck it up more than Private Servers have.
---
Well played I’ll look into it. Thanks!
---
i dont get it, what about PVE servers?
---
No crediting? I fucking cross posted it, can’t give more credit than that since you’re watching his actual post!
---
What?
---
That still doesnt mean its a good thing.
---
Why are you basically saying that Servers should be only in NA? If that was the case even Roblox would have a better Server structure. That's sad
---
For me personally, I use my bank alt to hold items for raid consumables and mats, I don't try to sell items on my bank alt, he/she will be just an extra storage place.  If I got a BoE blue or epic on my main, I would just put it on the AH on my main.  In my mind, it helps to build my reputation on the server if people know who they are buying the good stuff from.  I plan on my main being an herbalist/alchemist so I would send my pots and herbs to my bank alt until I got ready to use them.  I also plan on my bank alt being an enchanter to DE items so I only have to buy minimal enchanting mats and just use the guild enchanter for enchanting my items.  Most enchanters will enchant your items for free/small tip if you supply the items.  Someone who uses their bank alt to sell would have to give you input on what to do it that regard
---
Plus no bloodelves in vanilla
---
You sound like the kids i saw on the forums posting "Blizzard will NOT release Classic realms for years" 
---
We'll see buddy.
---
Pretty sure you'll dismount in shallow water where other races wouldn't, as that wasn't fixed until later expansions.
---
Gonna level in spirit and int gear for health regen and skill upgrades.
---
The dead zone requires management and prep to avoid having it exploited against you.  I recommend you roll engineer for the stun grandees to toss when a mage freezes you in your dead zone. 
---
Running out arrows sucks, but easily managed if you make yourself buy ammo every time you're near an ammo vendor.  The bigger issue is losing a bag slot to a quiver.
---
You could go to the location, but there were a shit ton of red dragons and you'd die unless you went over geared or with a group. It wasn't a dungeon, no.
---
General consensus is you would take the hit neck only if you didnt have enough hit from gear or were crit capped.
---
Yeah I used to think this but they kept grinding into SM Armory/Cathedral when their level 30 BiS gear wasn't even that amazing anymore, and were still clearing it fast.  I am not sure if dungeon spam is optimal for the entire leveling path but it seems like SM is a exp goldmine
---
Always book for a week after a launch if you want to enjoy your time. For BC and Wrath I used all my vacation days and for the first few days my experience was terrible and would have rather been at work just to kill the time. Every launch since then I just pop on when I get home from work just to see what kind of shit storm awaits.
---
I recently convinced my wife to play classic with me, so we started playing on a pserver so she could get a feel for the game and see if it's her cup of tea before classic launches. It's been a bit difficult convincing her to give it a go as she's a bit slow to take to new games she is unfamiliar with. 
---
The other day she came home from work with a full page of notes and diagrams about talent trees for her hunter, and she said log the fuck on honey, we've got pumpkins to collect.
---
I remember them being pretty good in duels simply because they can outlast people but you will never see one in any serious raid or BG group.
---
Not playable, but there was NPCs
---
Hope it is more than additive.  Each layer hop should increase the CD by an order of magnitude.  i.e if first CD is 30 mins, next should be 300.
---
Just get the blue pvp set in phase two. Achieving rank 10 is pretty easy.
---
God damn it doea every wife playing priest?!
---
P.s mine will too
---
If anything playing a gnome is a huge advantage. It’s harder to notice the little guy dropping bombs out of the corner before it’s too late.
---
So we're just taking the word of mr. criminal? Welp.
---
I'd absolutely love WoW 2, and I think this is a great way to get there. Instead of having WoW 2 pickup as, essentially, a sequel to BfA, why not take it from Classic down a new timeline.
---
The crafted one does, but there's a different [tuxedo](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6834/black-tuxedo) and [pants](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6835/black-tuxedo-pants)) that have no level requirements. These were obtained from Brightly Colored Eggs during the Easter world event.
---
Oh I thought it was just not even possible to go up that path. Been a looooong time since I leveled an alliance char so I just forgot about that haha :)
---
5 second rule? Do I eat floor cookies and heal better?
---
No, I sound like the guy that isn't some RP-PVP fanboi that thinks his realm choice is more important than the realm choice of 10x more players that aren't getting servers in their native language or even hosted on their own continent.
---
Can I skip this zone?
---
*It's the main reason to play on a PvP server. Most fun I had leveling was in STV.
---
I got a classic vib for like 30 seconds then the music kicked in...
---
I’d go back to playing Xbox and chipping away at the ever growing Netflix queue.
---
I would continue playing classic. Blizzard is the hotfix king. Launch of mmo's are never without their issues...it's one of the most exciting things to be a part of imo.
---
Good lord :(
---
Thanks for keeping this up, it needs to change. At the very least they should have DE/FR/EN servers. 
---
The playerbase in Germany is huge. 
---
Also the layering will further complicate things as it will obscure the community split even more in the beginning.
---
Your first mistake was telling reddit your character name idea.
---
They won't divide the player base with ONE RP-PVP server. What don't people understand?
---
Actually, there was a guild named &lt;Furniture That Kills&gt; on Daggerspine. Names like couch, dresser, ottoman, etc.
---
At this point it is common knowledge that it is preraid BIS short of BOE epics was 2pc devilsaur, 3 pc black dragonscale(boots, chest shoulders) and the lionheart helm. All crafted.
---
I'm not saying they should only be in NA. They're only going to be in NA, EU, and Asia. But a lot of EU English players are going to play on NA to avoid the clusterfuck that will happen on their own continent's servers.
---
my guess is he's going to play ret and dont want blizz to fix SoR doing more dmg than intended.
---
I think gear will be an issue for you if you want to be an ele shaman, but dont take my word for it
---
Because everyone will envy you since gnomes are the perfect class &lt;3
---
Then private servers data mine everything  and create servers with the community demanded fixes. 
---
We win either way.
---
Am I the only one that realizes that people who want an RP-PVP server can just flag themselves for PVP and RP-world-PVP against other players that want to?
---
14 million is a lot of money aye. I bet it buys some nice bubbles to live in though.
---
Pretty huge downside, literally and figuratively.
---
Oh yeah that sure won’t lead to any ninja’ing at all....
---
Nearly positive it was, but it required people to be on the same stage of a quest chain, so it was hard to use practically.
---
Yes, you can share shareable quests.
---
Friend is an avid HOTS player and isn’t sure what to choose. 
---
He plays mostly damage dealers and bruisers such as Falstad, Valla, Chromie, Thrall and Gall.  
---
His focus would be dungeons and battlegrounds. 
---
He’s new to Wow but became a big blizz fan through hots.  Obviously they are very different games, but he’s a great player and there’s some pieces of hots that seem applicable to wow.  
---
Was thinking maybe mage or hunter would be a solid option?  
---
I’ll be going priest and another friend is going warrior.
---
Fanboy? I'm just trying to recreate the original vanilla experience. I'm stating facts, you just hating like all kids did on classic on the forums for years. The wall of no.
---
Yeah you did, since lot of new players are here it's possible someone doesn't know that. Cheers tho mate.
---
Certain item stats are not in as high demand. For instance, "of the Monkey" gear (+agi +sta) will always be a popular item and therefore will likely sell on the AH for an elevated price. Once you get used to seeing certain stat block items on the AH, you will get a hang of which items are worth selling and which should just be d/e.
---
Ummm yes I know, my point is I cant find a source from 2005 that says they knew what gear was BiS. Please read for context...
---
There should be an RPPvP server instead of RPPvE.
---
All surveys show there is three times more interest in RPPvP compared to RPPvE. (same breakdown of PvP vs PvE)
---
I would hardly call it broken or unfinished. This isn’t fallout 76 we are talking about. They still have two months to tidy up the minor bugs that are popping up
---
Too much Reddit? Bro I mained a Paladin from ‘06-‘18. Ret was garbage in Vanilla. Auto hitting things is not good. But hey, they have BoP and Freedom!
---
I can't see for all these red flags whapping me in the face.
---
I'm into it. Flag me more.
---
What a save!
---
It doesn't matter how much more damage the lower rank one could do, we don't get judgement of wisdom procs or shadow oil and chilli procs which means we're gonna take a solid 20% damage hit on dps
---
Ok cool.  I remember using it a lot
---
You will be a gnome. The supreme race
---
I've pretty much landed on Hunter. My goals for classic will be dungeons in my 50's for blues, hitting 60 then grinding AV rep for gear then being in BGs most of my play time. I'm sort of a loner and I feel Hunter handles solo situations really well, while not being super gear dependant as beyond MC puts I dont see myself in raids. I think team fights will be fun as a hunter and I'll be going NE so shadowmeld shenanigans will be had.
---
My only hangup is thinking if Druid may be a better pick. It's the ultimate solo class, best flag carrier, great base defender, great pvp class, etc. My concerns are 1) the amount of buttons and macros seems scary 2) will my damage matter in team fights? I know druids are support and will be healing, peeling, supporting, etc. but I would hate leveling to 60 then finding out my damage is totally ignorable by design. 
---
I see vids of images killing druids in 5 seconds, while druids are whittling down 1v1 opponents in minutes. Also will a mediocre druid or hunter have more fun and/or be more successful?
---
I do tend to run flags in pugs and defend so those roles come pretty naturally to me.
---
Mage is easier in pve for sure. But in pvp mages have to basically pull out all the stops if they want to survive in a meaningful way. Obviously in AV and large scale world pvp your job is easier since you just rain down blue stuff or go in for the purple boom. But in WSG and AB where is more 1v2 if 1v1 especially against big boy retadins or warriors, you needed to be pretty skilled.
---
Exactly this. Odd animations (strafing bugs) and odd or missing textures (small patches of water missing in remote areas) are nothing compared to mobs have completely wrong health/armor/damage values. 
---
Its pretty apparent that the Classic team is hard at work fixing these bugs, so I have no doubt most of it will be ironed out by release day.
---
Yeah only played Paladin for 13 years. Fuck do I know? Ret was god awful in Vanilla.
---
I don't role play.  I think it's dumb.  But i support anyone who wants to play on a RP server.  PVP or PVE.  
---
Consider this post my joining of your cause.
---
I feel like I remember getting "Unable to share quest with __________" like 90% of the time I used it, haha.
---
Do you like fat women
---
Hotfix King? Strand of the Ancients was broken for something like over a year after it released.
---
Same thing happened on my server (Skullcrusher Ally)
---
Typing in all caps doesn't make your dumbass less wrong. Read.
---
Your words have upsetted me.
---
I predict that the launch will be 2 months later than i'd like it to be.
---
They have told the story of AQ, so I don't know what they would use it for except some random quests that wouldn't really add much to the storyline.  
---
Probably just meant to be scenery to be seen if someone is able to see outside the dungeon area. Most likely, they built the outside area first and then places the instanced dungeon there, and that space is what was left over.
---
Well since furywarrior was not really a thing until the last quarter of 2005, when the warrior rework came through and people realized that it was better than arms. There was not a whole lot of theory crafting on it at that point.
---
RoboCop suffered from a lack of Govt funding
---
Fuck this is one true way to drive the message home. Well done indeed.
---
More than one per server is possible. Anyone that has completed the quest line can ring the gong within the first 10 hours of the first person ringing it. They also get the mount and the title. Theoretically you could have hundreds of people with the title and mount, but realistically given the rep grind and ability to only progress one person per week through parts of the quest (due to the raid requirements), there will be far fewer. I'm guessing each server will have a handful of Scarab Lords.
---
You're not going to recreate the original vanilla experience.
---
And even if they released RP-PVP servers (which they won't), players like me would choose them because streamers likely won't. And guess what? We'd fuck with your RP all day long. 
---
General chat would be full of IRL chat, you'd get laughed at every time you asked for a "scenario", and a majority of players would just ignore your RP shit altogether. The only difference between an RP-PVP server and a PVP server would be player names because that's the only RP policy Blizzard still enforces.
---
Not the most exciting in combat, correct. But when I ranked to Grand Marshal I had a ret paladin at my side for most of that grind and he was anything but garbage. The horde feared him just as much as they did me.
---
Most people didn't experiment with anything new.  They just ran cookie cutter specs, and used the world buff exploit.
---
My thought as well. Resto druid would eventually be in a good position to drop the occasional Hurricane  and a Prot Pally could make use out of the Warrior gear that drops. 
---
If this is with people you know and are using voice communication, running dungeons is a solid way of leveling at launch.
---
They're a race, not a class, and they're pathetic.
---
To each their own. Personally this game would bore the hell out of me if i wasnt constantly getting ganked. Love the personal rivalries that spawn because of it.
---
if they fuck it up I'm done with WoW
---
Wonder if there’s an event trigger that you could use to make an add on that would alarm you when someone resurrects
---
The worst thing about deadzone is if you duel and mages make absolute sure they start the fight in it and never let you leave.
---
It's viable to go into the holy damage nodes as you level. The only thing matters are the wand nodes and spirit tap. After that it really doesn't matter what you pick until level 40/44. That's the point you can respec into Shadowform, which I think is faster to approach 40-56-60. I personally going to respec for at 40 then respec again into holy when I start farming the lategame dungeons. But I might try out how a smite builds feels.
---
I joined Vanilla in late 2005/early 2006. I played at least 5 hours a day and usually 7 or 8 on weekends. Still took 2 months to ding 60. But granted I wasnt following an optimized route or anything.
---
Nope. You can get ore and bars in chests.
---
Don’t think blizzard wants to run two full development teams for essentially the same franchise. You’re talking new art assets, new gear, abilities and balancing. Highly unlikely. Better off going with the tried and true TBC and WoTLK
---
Pservers being they would have more accurate data.
---
If female, 'Sunderwear' is a good one.
---
It's definitely not that bad and theres two months left. I don't agree at all that it's likely that it will release in a broken and unfinished state. Will it have bugs? Sure. Every single release of software throughout history have bugs but I think it will be 99% fine.
---
Its been so long I don't remember: what is the cost to send mail to an alt on the same account? I feel like it was around 30-40 copper, not sure if that is right though.
---
Yeah I'm in the same boat. TBC arguably had some of the best balance... well maybe they favored hybrids a bit too much in that expansion, but honestly they fixed so much. But how do you encourage balancing without being disappointing by certain changes etc. I'm not sure what I want after I'm done with (most) classic content.
---
'Cleaveage'?
---
Sadly only if they care that they are of the rotund inclinations.
---
The primary reason is that Alliance is a bit gay to be honest. Why would you choose gnome/dwarf/elf when you have Orc/Tauren/Undead, I can't comprehend.
---
Y'know, a few years ago people were saying 'Classic is just not happening. Time to get over it.'
---
Yeah, I've followed Boston Dynamics for a while. They're making great progress, but not this great haha. When I first saw the CGI video I thought it was legit until the end and then I watched the behind the scenes. I just dont want anyone to be legitimately scared or worried if they see this and think it's real, because it is pretty convincing.
---
I have no idea what you're talking about, lol
---
Roll the one true hybrid in vanilla. Roll warrior.
---
Actually it wasn't. I made the wallpaper using those assets.
---
Biggest problem with warriors IMO is that their specs are pretty one dimensional.
---
If you spec Arms, you're going to be great at PvP but suck at PvE content.
---
If you spec Fury or Prot, you're going to be great at PvE but suck at PvP.
---
Good information.  Again - thanks.  Will help me determine the 'point' values.
---
I also think tbc and wotlk are better in the "gameplay department" (classes/skills/talents/etc) but the world part nowhere near Imo
---
Yes, and now it is happening. Without German servers, without French servers, likely without Oceania servers, and definitely without RP-PVP servers.
---
If I play Alliance I get ganked by ?? hordes, if I play Horde I get ganked by ?? alliance.
---
There's always gonna be bad eggs on both sides.
---
I have a beard. I aspire to dwarven levels.
---
Why would I wanna be a flimsy ass skeleton or a rare beef steak with dick titties.
---
Exactly!
---
Tanks are imperative, and if you’re crew of friends are tankless I would go with the warrior. In the long run it will pay off. You can always make a mage later if you want but having your tank off the rip will be the best.
---
I'm having a real hard time with nailing down a main. I'll explain some thought processes and hope for some opinions. I started off as a feral tank druid going for MT/OT for my guild, I dropped it after the thought of running Gnomeregan forever hurt my brain. I then led to my current trio of Holy/Shadow healing Dorf priest with shadow weaving, Human Sword rogue, or Gnome DS/ruin Warlock. I like healing, however one of my best friends is going holy paladin which means during leveling, we won't play together much but afterwards we get to be like the bash brothers of healing, plus I get to hold that sweet Benediction. I never really played a rogue ever in my long wow career, and never got to feel that awesome weapon upgraded dps feeling, although I don't want to get lost in a sea of rogues. Warlock, I have played pretty much forever, but between the mounts, summoning utilities, and easy leveling (I work a full time job now l, not 18 anymore), it just seems like it's the most familiar choice, but I'm not sure if the best. So between rogue, priest, and warlock, what are some of your experiences, because going back and forth led me to really lose sleep last night trying to decide. Thanks!
---
I thought tbc was fantastic. It was a beautiful expansion. Wotlk, I did t think it was that great. Maybe I was just burnt out by then.
---
As someone from Tich who spent 5 hours staring at an error message I disagree. 
---
Def wait a day or two.
---
I know I was the odd one out but I had no mods until BC. I didnt even know what mods were and most of my guild didnt use any. Needless to say we didnt raid very well and never got very far. 
---
As the main tank, I didn't have Omen or DBM so it was all remembering the timings of the mechanics and hoping no one pulled off me.
---
Salesman*
---
Voting for this just to keep you off my server :P
---
If you enjoy complexity go for druid, if you prefer that pet pew pew playstyle then hunter.
---
I could if someone gave me all of them.
---
&gt; impactful variance in the way they play 
---
idk man fire mage plays different to frost mage which plays differently to arcane.
---
Fury warriors plays different to arms.
---
Demo/afflic/Destru don't play a like aswell.
---
BM/SURV/MM don't play the same at all
---
what do you mean?
---
Because it's still beta and it's hyperbole. Not like Hunter's sre even close to unplayable.
---
Something missing from a lot of peoples answers. Almost no raid is gonna bring you along if you dont pre gear to some extent. There are loads of pre raid bis from BRD, UBRS, Strat and Scholo etc. These can take quite sometime to clear if you have noob party members or undergeared party members. And you can do it all and NOT get a loot item. A single thing even. Something I feel like a lot of people are missing is the pure RNG on drops. I ran the above dungeons at least 10 times on my mage before getting a single UG. Thats like 20 hours of my life for one single item. Thats vanilla, I love it and I hate it.
---
You can, but it's the same thing as saying you can PvP flag on PvE servers against other players who want to.
---
You'll find some, but it won't be the same
---
PS: Mostly pve play, extremely casual PvP play
---
I like it! Have my most generous updoot.
---
And all the private server people have to get used to not having a bank alt on a second account. Most people did this because then you could just transfer items over directly by logging both accounts. But on Classic you will actually have to pay for that second account so it probably won't be widely used.
---
Warrior stands out since they are on the tougher side to level solo. Also for any 5 man, you just need 3 dps. If you don't wanna do that then any class would be fine, I would avoid mage and lock do you aren't fighting over similar loot.
---
You will be dismounted in places where other races wouldn't otherwise. On the positive side, you will also fit in places where other races can't lol.
---
You are also harder to spot.
---
You can’t play your friends account. Its against the terms of service.
---
If you want to be a giant loser you have to pay for several subs.
---
Wait where's the note?
---
You just can't pass that mage party utility for a hunter, c'mon man, easy mage choice for food and portals.
---
I mean, they totally could if they wanted to. But, as I pointed out, Retail numbers have been slipping. If they just take make the new timeline moving forward as the main game, then they wouldn't need to.
---
Ah yes.  It'll be just like when it originally launched with a bunch of bugs and nobody played. Or when TBC launched with a bunch of bugs and nobody played. Maybe when WotLK launched with a bunch of bugs and nobody played? You see where I'm going with this?
---
My guild come from pserver and will accept any ret paladin as we cruelly need paladin, we rolling horde btw
---
You only need enchanting when dealing with items that drop after your main is 50+, right? It'd just be a waste of time earlier I assume.
---
seems like you got a pretty good idea of gow you want to play anyhow. as always, go as you like, thats what the game is for!
---
tanking right after dinging 60 is hard for all tanks, so dont be dissapointed. Pally is a great choice for all konds of fun :)
---
Put it on a hotbar. Keybind it. Don't display the hotbar.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Dn6X2QIZg
---
You sound just like me bro.
---
I disagree.  The world in TBC and WOTLK felt far more alive, and the threat from Illidan and Arthas seemed far more real.   The raids in Vanilla wow felt completely separated from the world.
---
But if it's popular, maybe it will be full and they will need to open a second one... and maybe a third if other people leave their PvP or RP-PvE server. Or maybe they think the game will not be a great success and in Vanilla RP-PvP was the least played and it's the one to go
---
My point is that I feel that Blizzard want to limit the number of servers and the options greatly so people don't have to 'micro manage' multiple type of servers
---
Can’t wait till you’re banned. In contrast to private servers: blizzard doesn’t give a fuck how much money you pay each month when you break the rules.
---
That's more or less how I felt too. TBC knocked it out of the park. However, WotLK really didn't impress me much, which stunk because Arthas was kind of the iconic bad guy to me.
---
You can already be a troll priest, why would you want to be anything else?
---
I remember clearly when I dinged 60 on my first char but for life of me, cant remember how I earned the gold for my epic mount.
---
That's fine though, ret is useless anyway. You should only play a pally if you want to be a heal/buffbot
---
I do believe a heal 2 is useful for when topping up people who aren't in need of all the extra heals, like after hit by a random ability and no more DMG coming in.
---
Downvoted for asking for upvotes
---
False.
---
Following a guide and not getting distracted, you can easily reach 60 in 5 days /played (120 hours). That's ~15 hours per day over 8 days, giving you a full night's sleep and plenty of time to eat or whatever.
---
And you will hop into MC with greens. That's exactly how all the week-one Ragnaros killing guilds plan to do it.
---
What. I've never seen it and I refresh this sub on like an hourly basis
---
Who gives a damn if people try and mess with the RP. That's part of the experience lmao.
---
Dwarf master race ya bishhhhhh FERDA LYANCE
---
TBC was good, but the beginning of the end. If it were released again it would have to have #changethingssuchasdailyquestgrinding, and all the other things that slowly let wow loose it’s touch.
---
But I must say I absolutely love the duel arenas and hope they find a way to bring that to classic
---
If blizz allows the world buff exploit, then I will go full ham with the cheats.    I will use the 2nd account to run bots.
---
That is true, but being able to do something and being able to do something fast can require different gear, and if you're gonna be instance farming for xp, you're gonna wanna clear as fast as possible
---
Guild bank alts also promote account sharing from what I’ve seen
---
It seems cool at first glance, but all theres very little to do with most of these factions aside from grinding thousands of mobs for rep
---
This was the best shit I've seen on here in a long time. That poor robot
---
&gt;and she said log the fuck on honey, we've got pumpkins to collect.and she said log the fuck on honey, we've got pumpkins to collect.
---
Is it weird that I'm being severely aroused by hearing this? I don't think it gets any better than that. 
---
10/10 she's probably a keeper - Reddit
---
This is just hopeful conjecture
---
Pros: no competition for mobs, better gear than leveling in open world, no wpvp ganks (fewer deaths), and the exp boost from elite mobs and being in 5-man group. 
---
Cons: repetitive grind (sounds like not an issue for you and your group), difficult to get 4-5 people reliably to log at the same time, and if you don't keep everyone in the group within one or two levels of each other the lower leveled folks will start to fall behind due to the way the group exp is awarded.
---
Overall, I think it's viable. Hard to say if it is "better" than questing/leveling in the open world. If the zerg is intense and I'm waiting 30-60 seconds to tag a quest mob while you're group is breezing through an instance then the instance route would be better. It'll be important to stay appropriately leveled for the instance because there is a steep exp drop off for mobs 3 or more levels below your level.
---
It's not part of the Vanilla experience you so desperately want to recreate because not respecting RP was against the ToS back then.
---
I'd go Rogue but that's my own preference speaking. I would not worry so much about playing a popular class honestly as the biggest trouble with raids is getting the 40 people herded.
---
Ah dun wantit
---
Have not seen anyone post it. I farmed for crusaders enchant in EPL. 2 hours a day for 2 weeks. Sold it for 500g+. Fought so many chinese gold farmers for it.
---
I’m not following. So just drop retail entirely? Think that would piss off a bunch of their remaining playerbase there. Pitchforks and chants of “I don’t wanna play classic to get more WoW content!!”
---
Have you seen bear claws though? Those things are like big curved knives
---
Probably why they should allow the whole content to be tested.
---
So we can spot them and report them before release. I don't want players having advantage in end game because of bugs...
---
Im pretty sure when blizzard says they will try to 1:1 vanilla, they will try 1:1 vanilla. Furthermore your defeatist artitude is pathetic and will never get you anywhere in the world.
---
Good point. I might be able to get fury gear as prot
---
Fishing is not as bad as people think. It's not the best moneymaker but I find it strangely relaxing.
---
IIRC they said they aren't going to use old server names. Pretty sure I saw it in one of the many YT vid interviews. Can't recall which one.
---
Curse of shadows works differently. Private servers could not figure out what happens when resist becomes negative. So yes shadow bolts would Crit that much because of the hidden mechanic.
---
I don't think petition signatures counts as upvotes
---
Way too big of a gameplay change
---
Never as I mainly quested and did dungeons at 60 and some of the quests ended up getting me attuned.
---
Had to learn about UBRS key attunement as that one is a. It tricky.
---
Good, gold should be hard to come by.
---
If it means anything, I have a database of close to 40k wow players from Vanilla and less than 4% of my total census submitted they were on an RP-PVP server.  
---
I am not against the idea, just providing real data that’s not from retail.
---
They said they're not using the old names
---
Oh that’ll actually help a ton. Thank you!!
---
Actually they said that they never intended for people to abuse the world buffs in the way they're doing on the pirated realms. 
---
They never said any nonsense like #nochanges.
---
They have already said they will be coming out with new names and not reusing old server names. Battle group names might be an option tho. I bet we get new names all together. They have tons of city and character names they could go with for names that haven’t already been taken.
---
I'm not concerned about getting into a raid as much as doing pug groups to hear "We already have a rogue". A statement I remember using. What did you like about the rogue over other classes you've played?
---
Seen this same stupid question 50 times over, what a shit post
---
There are many predictions how the launch will go, you know that.. you just want to circle jerk about the release being 2 months away
---
You act as if everyone respected rules back then too, when they didn't. No shit sherlock, of course people will break rules regardless of what it states. Welcome to the real world.
---
And that's none of my business, that's Blizzards problem. I don't care if people try and fuck with peoples roleplay, people will find a one way or another to roleplay.
---
Nah I’d be perfectly fine with playing holy until I have my T1, and then go Rest :)
---
Fair enough if that's not what you meant. I read your original comment and interpreted it the same way he did.
---
She is 100 % set on priest tho
---
Yes we need one.
---
Night Elf Paladin baby that would be amazing
---
"I asked for facts but then decided I didnt like them". Blizzard is gonna make business decisions based on whatever stats they can get. And if nobody plays it retail, then its a pretty big leap of faith to assume it will be different on classic.
---
Simple solution. Don't open more than one. If the server is full all the time, it won't be an issue because the population will drop anyway in a couple months or so after release when people realize Classic isn't for them.
---
I think so too
---
Then you might want to google some dude. Tipsout is involved in construction fraud for many millions. He is no one to follow, and he certainly doesn’t get to take credit for this basic bandaid fix to layering.
---
Then just roleplay on a PVP server, duh.
---
No one is ree'ing; they're being politely vocal. It seems like you just reduced that to ree'ing because you're tired of seeing a request that you don't care about.
---
You can fly directly from Ratchet to Orgrimmar instead of having to do the run.

https://youtu.be/ShGRWM9dNy8

This is true, but it is largely due to new players joining at that time. It's hard to say that WoTLK was a "better version" when the "Wrath Babies" who flooded the gates never played Vanilla or TBC. But on the other hand, usually where people begin is their fondest memories, so you may be right!
---
I haven't seen those so didn't know about that.
---
Shame though seems like a wasted opportunity for people to reconnect.
---
But I'll check out those interviews when I got some free time.
---
Stealth mostly. Plus I find pickpocketing and lock picking fun. Being able to go 'oh shit' with vanish or regular stealth to avoid stuff feels great.
---
Yea, let Retail's story end where it is, with the "Battle for Azeroth." It's a fairly apt point to let that story end. As to people complaining about not wanting to play classic to get more content, they wouldn't need to. Blizzard can do what they've been doing for years: give players joining the new content a character boost.
---
Deadzone may be a problem if leeway stay like this. Melee will be able to play with this deadzone while hitting you.
---
My plan is to make bank by getting bis recipes like arcanite reaper early so I can fund engineering for pvp
---
As stated below (or above?), that advice is solid.
---
To elaborate a bit, it will come down to knowing your market. From my time back in 2005 - 2007, some servers had very active auction houses and pricing behaved predictably.
---
Some servers however had much more chaotic environments as far as far as supply and pricing, can also vary per faction on the same server.
---
If you take time to study it and pay attention, you can sometimes sell green items for more than the enchanting mats sell for, if the suffix is a desirable one (eagle, bear etc), or like others say, certain resist gear.
---
You can also get a feeling of when you can buy something priced low and then resell it at a higher price because the person selling it just dumped it at whatever price they came up with. 
---
Not as likely these days, but I have bought Shadowfang's and Assasain's Blades for a gold each and resold for hundreds later. Not a huge chance of something like that these days, but similar things can happen.
---
the lee way is applied to both Pve AND Pvp......... testing has been done for both and proven to be applied to both.
---
We are going horde. so not and option 😁
---
What would she do if she found out you lied?

I grinded AV reputation like an idiot for the discount. Borrowed about 250g from a friend and it took me another month after that to repay it- herbalism and 100% mount make it a lot faster.
---
I used to be the laziest farmer so when epic mounts were already common I was still riding my 60% mount and was a laughing stock of my guild.

Don't put words in my mouth. He stated facts, but so did I. You know I'm right when i say that Classic is all about the social interaction and community. Why do you think people make such a big fucking deal over layering.
---
Ferda! Wheel, Snipe, Celly boys!

tfw u shipped the two rogues back then

Can you prevent it from letting it consume you? I know I can’t, so I’ve decided not to roll at all.

Cries in satellite

Engineering is a gold sink. As far as I know you mostly need it for pvp so you dont need it until you already have a steady income
---
ok.... hot fix duke

I agree. I disliked that everyone was suddenly crammed into smaller continents with no want / need to return to old Azeroth. That's the only downside for me, as well, which includes flying too.

Is it true you can fly to org from ratchet in the beta as a troll or orc?  I only see a flight path to orgrimmar when you get to thunderbluff... For whatever reason XR, as I remember, does not have a path to orgrimmar.

You'll have to first buy a beta account to check any of this information.

Thanks for your opinions man, I'll be weighing everything I hear about
---
Hmmm i dont think Hunter is for me 😒
---
current colorblind mods don't work with me in PVP. All the health bars look exactly the same no matter what setting and strength i put it on. I wish they would just let me pick what color i want the health bars to be.
---
No way - if they are going to do something like that it’s going to happen on the retail side, not the classic. It doesn’t make any sense to do in with classic.
---
Day long ques, server troubles etc. Id say most people have 2 months and 1-2 days before servers work and weeks before we have to stop using scripts, macros and remote logging so we actually dont have to be in que for 10 hours or more :D

Dude you’re going to really hurt your physical and mental health. I did that for a few years, ended up with back problems and other more chronic medical  issues.

Also functions as a message board of sorts so it'll take the place of guild websites from back then.

Another reason for a bank alt is to be able to sell/buy stuff on the AH *'anonymously'* so your friends/guildies don't know that it is that is you that is undercutting or overcharging them.
---
Actual vanilla. Pservers emulate the original vanilla timeline. Whether it will be there in classic at the beginning of phase 5 we don't know.
---
Hey, fashion demands sacrifice.

Yeah because your modem and his modem totaly have the same ip adress.. or your pc’s have the same mac adresses.. because you live in the same town.

Speaking from experience, your wife/fiancée may not be happy with your choice to spend a lot of time gaming. What if you got divorced within a year? Not saying that is definite, but it’s a real possibility.

You should verify this in the beta before posting.  I'm 85% sure your posted strat is invalid.
---
They patched quite a few hunter bugs just in the last few days
---
Roll a Feral tank.  You know you want to...
---
Just fine may be a bit of an exaggeration. As a general rule of thumb, just avoid rogue. Melee in general if it REALLY bothers you. Tanking and ranges DPS feels fine, and gealing is mostly pretty good.
---
Yep
---
HTF do you think it can be released in a broken and unfinished state, we know exactly what content was in vanilla and what content we're getting in classic.
---
All they're doing is time gating various things.
---
Why did you quit gaming? I’ve tried to quit a few times and am trying again now. Classic WoW is a big draw but also know it will end really badly.
---
Account sharing =/= dual boxing
---
This. Although most of us on this sub obviously agree that the game is much more enjoyable in an actual MMORPG style, such as classic &gt; TBC&gt; and *maaaaybe* WoTLK (lost a lot of MMO traits here), there are people that do indeed love retail, and prefer the weird hybrid MMO/Action RPG creature it is today. They will never abandon their current product, in my opinion, no matter how much I'd love to see it happen!
---
I believe the first mobs inside the instance are 17, the first bosses being level 20.

"world buff exploit"
---
XD
---
Undead paladin would make perfect sense, just as undead priests do anyway.
---
Gnome priest should definitely have something like improved Fade.
---
Or go to descolace and grind near the Kodo graveyard
---
Nice :) thanks
---
Don't attribute your opinion onto others: there's dozens of german servers on retail and there was dozen of german servers in Vanilla and it means there's plenty of people who would like to play in German if they were given the opportunity.

40k players isn't close to what Classic will launch with though. And yes the numbers will drop after a couple months but there'll still be millions playing i bet.
---
Except for nost which was growing until the end
---
Those AQ40 exploiters were honest compared to the world buff exploiters from the pirated relams.
---
Yea it was. Mods didn't do anything about trolls except change non rp names. It was really common for a little kid to come in screaming and wanting attention when the adults were talking. They were put on ignore, and eventually left when they couldn't get a rise out of adults.
---
Yes. It’s a lot of kolkar grinding etc but is possible.
---
Blizzard pls
---
Fuck that, they put languages in their games since the beginning, this isn't the time to make us learn every item and every word for everything to communicate with other players. Also forcing people into giving up on their language is shit from the get go anyway
---
Honestly though... he is basing his point of view on facts backed up with evidence and you are just saying "muh opinion"
---
Hunters have a way of blending in with the environment by standing perfectly still
---
kick lock instead of lock picking
---
&gt; And last, but not least, the insane amount of circlejerking going on here somehow entertains me.
---
To be honest with this i can relate. I could've seen myself making a sarcastic streamer related comment here.
---
Well they could but let me ask you this question: why don't they open up one german and french server in your opinion?
---
I know there is support for it, but you claim there is a big enough community for it without actually having solid data to back that up. If you're going to hold /u/EveClassic to providing sources you better also do the same, all you have is anecdotal evidence.
---
Even this change.org petition has only been able to get about 1,300+ signatures in a month, is that enough players to keep a realm alive 1 month after launch? 3 months after launch? A year? Sure it's not the best source, but it's the only solid numbers I've seen so far.
---
WOTLK also started the skeleton structure of new-WoW though. Group finder, super-streamlined questing, giant gear catchups, invalidation of old raids the instant a new raid is released, 5 mans becoming too easy, tank threat becoming a joke, ~everything has a difficulty setting~, class balance became homogenized. There was a lot of good in WOTLK don't get me wrong but mechanically it wasn't without its controversies. WOTLK also may have been peak WoW population but it also started on a high note from BC being an amazing expansion that saw a lot of constant growth, WOTLK saw very little growth by comparison.
---
Maybe it was back when Wow was the only real MMO that most people played. Do you really think classic will draw 10x the number of ppl to RP? I'd be curious about the pserver ratios, i wonder if they are the same.
---
* 1,500 players is at least half of what will probably be maximum server capacity.
---
* Most players who would play on RP-PvP, due to lack of exposure, won't see the petition.
---
Troll Druid makes sense to me. gnome priest with a fairy type spell that turns damage taken into heals might be a cool racial.
---
&gt; 5 level 20s running dead mines would get fuck all for experience. The first half of the instance is level 14-16 mobs for starters. You would get 10-15% of a level in a full run which takes at least 30 minutes. This would only get worse at 21 and 22. People in this sub are vastly underestimating just how bad this would be.
---
At level 20, a full run of The Deadmines would net about 12,800xp in a group of five. 61% of the level.
---
Solo grinding at 20 can hit 20,000xph - so if they can manage 40 minute runs, they should be on par with norm, that's tough tho.
---
I can only imagine the stealth sneaking animation.
---
I would! If they could fulfil a more personally interesting  role in pvp other than flag carrying and base sitting/aoe
---
Druids are awesome no doubt about it. But their dmg sucks and mana sucks. If dpsing. Their healing isn't exactly great in pvp and I'm being ally. Which druid is even more fucked by shamans n priests dispel :(
---
I am in the exact same boat. I just don't know. Warrior for PvE and group pvp. Mage is everything and farming, and solo play.. I can just go nip into the world and kill some people, can't do that as war so easily.
---
Also warrior in BG's alone is just not fun. But I could gear up tank and dps at the same time and get groups so so fast. But what are we gearing up for if not pvp? And then we're in the same boat.
---
Talisman of Binding Shard was obtainable once and then removed.
---
Peak player count != peak quality.
---
WotlK did a lot for accessibility (10mans, 25 mans, heroics, LFG etc...) which naturally drives the participation level up, but that doesn't mean it was the best quality.
---
You have my support!
---
It isn't just STV, but everywhere. I didn't mind too much when I was younger and had 5+ hours a night to sink into playing, but now I have a full time job, wife, newborn baby, house, etc. I just don't have the patience to deal with being ganked over and over and spending the majority of my night doing corpse runs.
---
Yesterday in BFA, I helped Thrall, Saurfang, Jaina, and some other guy (Mattis? idk, something like that, I'm newish) break Baine out of prison while secretly feeding information to Sylvanus. So yeah. It does feel weirdly single-player, considering a million other people did the same thing, varying on the last part.
---
It doesn't have the same IP, but the IP is from the same area, which won't throw up any red flags.  Do you not have friends?  Have you not played at other people's house? lol
---
They won't look into me, so they won't see that I am playing on the same computer.   Hell, even if they did, my friend could be playing with me.  My PC could easily run 2 instances of WoW at ultra on the 2 monitors.
---
Nothing will happen kiddo.
---
The problem I found with the 60 servers with classes I didn't know was I had no idea about spells/rotations/gear/anything. Would need to level the class and learn how it works.
---
Every past WoW release has had bugs and there was no mass exodus of people.  Why would this time be any different?  It's using past experience to predict future experience.  If anything your original post is hopeless conjecture.
---
I leveled an alliance priest at the start of original vanilla.  I was in a large guild and leveled primarily there.  As long as you are in a leveling guild, it can be nice.  You get lots of loot, guild runs were indeed generally better than pugs, and it also really paid off in the 50s when guildies massively helped me to gear and hit 60.  They were having me run Molten Core with them even though I was only 57 and 58.  They did well and I ended up with epics I just couldn't equip, so they pulled me to 60 through Tyrs hand elites, winter frost tigers and chimera, and other farming spots.  I plan to do it again.

Says the world buff exploiter, rofl!!!
---
Do you have any videos uploaded of you leveling a troll priest by chance?
---
Lol thats so wrong I wont bother explaining why
---
Oh yea? Directly from Blizz HQ?
---
Nor do I think they’ll approve of the name haha
---
I understand, horde is for intellectuals anyway.
---
The alliance/horde quests aren't that bad (Kurzen, trolls)... 
---
Nesingwary are definitely harder, especially if there's people hunting for kills or high levels around
---
My first fan art attempt. Made a tribute to the class and specc I'll play the 27th.
---
Which class should be done next? Rogue is already done. Will upload to my instagram tomorrow.
---
Find me on insta mt.jessen
---
Id play it anyway forever and ever. Long live the king.
---
So, the only disadvantage is really a advantage highlighting the overall superiority of gnomes?
---
I'm super baffled that threads like this one always devolves into a weird flexbattle of who has the least free time. Also if you have to bring up "it doesn't mean I neglect the wife or kids" you come off as being entirely in denial about your neglect. I've never had a parent say "I'm totally neglecting my kids" even if it was a drug fiend, you can't trust people to judge themselves fairly.
---
Alexa, play “Straight to the Bank” by 50 Cent.
---
Joanna is developing his own addon - unless that's Questie. No joke, I paid for Joanna's guide back in the day because leveling was such a chore for alts.
---
also, Beast mastery shows a druid.
---
Are u gonna baby rage when I flawless victory you as a midget ?
---
I'd like to see updated points of interest on the world map. Just showing locations of flight paths, and the leveling range of each area when your looking at the world map would be a nice addition without hurting anything.
---
A more controversial change that I would actually welcome is increasing the amount per stack of certain profession materials. If I remember right, mining ore only stacks to 10, and takes a crapload of bag space very quickly. I don't think people would complain if they sneaked this change in.
---
You're not though. He won't be invited to a hardcore raid but MC and BWL will be pubbed half way through. He can still play the class and spec he wants, have fun, and get into raids, just like in 2004.
---
Yes ive played at friends.... on a different computer with a different mac adress... you’re realy not getting it, but thats ok. Dumb people usualy don’t know when they are wrong.
---
(((Other people tell me how to think and feel)))
---
It’s not
---
change.org is so cringy.
---
https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-class-guides/
---
&gt; with so much communication / coordination needed as in wow?
---
&gt; You don't even need a full raid or full 10 man in BGs to win or down bosses.
---
&gt; In csgo it's important to give short simple commands, since you want to deliver info fast. It's something completely different.
---
&gt; It is also important to give commands fast in raids and battle grounds.
---
&gt; It's not a good argument to say that it will suck for many people so we make it suck for all of them
---
It is going to suck the least for the most amount of people.
---
Well it is a real thing, orb of deception.
---
I wanted people that exclusively follow /r/classicwow to also be able to see this amazing art that illustrates a great place on Classic! 
---
Besides the *interesting activities* that happen there, it's definitely a memory of relief for many vanilla and retail players. Looking forward to experience it again after so much time!
---
If you want to be a healer in both high-end PvE and PvP I would recommend Paladin. It's pretty simple in raiding, but my personal belief is a Holy Paladin has an enormous skill cap in PvP. You can shut down an enemy team's entire offensive, making them burn out their cooldowns, while your allies regroup and counter. It's truly fun to watch, and feels super rewarding in gameplay.
---
Yeah but keep in mind that once you farmed 1-2 dungeons for 2-3 levels, you will also have nearly BiS since a lot of that loot comes from the dungeons.
---
So a group might start out with shit gear when dungeon spamming, but getting better gear while doing so is like a snowball affect.
---
The coast north of IF wouldn't be turned into something it's not enough land
---
If you've ever run from teldrassil and done the jump to Kharanos you know that shoreline is boring af and not very big, the Dun Morogh mountains are just too big
---
I wasn’t saying they aren’t... any class can kill a rogue if they catch them out of stealth.
---
shaman could have easily had racial spells considering the wow shaman class is influenced by all of the wc3 orc caster units.  only problem is these spells are actually really fucking strong and would be a balance nightmare.  all of them actually exist in some form in current wow:
---
tauren: spirit link/ethereal form
---
troll: hex/stasis trap (totem)
---
orc: feral spirit/earthquake
---
You can have 2 people play on the same computer now.  The same MAC address isn't a problem.
---
It is the current story of wow.  The books were the retcons, of like the story of sargeras and such.
---
But you're also doing each dungeon 20+ times. There's plenty gear to go around.
---
Ignore nothingfunnysee, complete retard.
---
Wow pvp community has 2 very different sides and that's what makes it so hard to keep pvp good. On the one hand you have people that want to pub stomp and on the other you want people who want skill based rated.
---
I'm more on the skill based side, I enjoy the more recent pvp because it's purely the better player wins  (somewhat) and not the one with the better gear wins.
---
Curious to see how it will pan out, this may change with lower pop servers, but on Fresh servers generally greens from 5-20 will sell fast but be cheap as dirt at launch as everyone is looting them and nobody has cash to buy them at big prices anyway, but a bit later GOOD primary stated greens like slow 2H's, wands, and daggers will raise in price for people re-rolling/decking out alts with their main's cash.  The rest of the low level green market will run out of buyers as you've said.    
---
                  
---
Previously I've just bought and held some the above stuff and then resold it a month or so in and done pretty well.
---
Sand-falls?
---
You linked the tweet of a criminal, and now claim you don’t even care. As morally bankrupt as your point of view is shallow.
---
My god... People hopped on a BETA and had the time of their lives, and you think the live game is gonna be shit ? Fuckin hell
---
Quite the opposite, they had access to the client which laid the foundation for the Mangos Core. They did not have access to the db-values which means much is pure (qualified) guesswork.
---
Not possible unless you have a guild who will carry you until you gear up with raiding.
---
7-8 days (real time) to 60 is really only doable for the biggest nolifers and speed levelers- those who have everything pre planned already.
---
"Farming" gold by selling portals is way too optimistic. When players ask you for a portal and you name a price most just say "lol thx cya" and whisper another mage. A lot of people already have trouble wrapping their head around just paying 10s for the reagent.
---
The gear will be a big problem to get into any serious guild and like I said before if you hope to only play a few hours per week it will only be possible if a guild is willing to take you along and gear you up.
---
Most guilds will raid 3 times per week at least and raids are looooong. Before everybody gets geared and guilds find their footing with regular members (40 people online for every raid is quite a feat) the raids will usualy take 3-4 hours on the minimum.
---
Bitch, I raided with 3 fps. You can deal with 200 ping.
---
w/e you say Ben shapiro.
---
I don't think Tauren is an option?
---
You never see one do you? That's how OP they are.
---
&gt; Completely different issues though. If classic wow were to release tomorrow it would be a great experience
---
We got raid azerite armor around June and release of the expansion was two months later in August.  Justsayin
---
This post is meant to demoralize people, not be a realistic outline of expectations.
---
Priests are a rare occurence under orcs and they are guardians of their spirital ancestry. Orcish blood is strong, orcish priests knew that hundreds of years before the legion corrupted their brethren. Orcish priests are able to draw strength from the spirits of their ancestors and are therfore never truly alone. Based on the deeds of their ancestors, this power can manifest in positive and negative ways.
---
\- **Ancestral guardian** \- Disciplin school - If the priest gets damaged by a critical effect, the soul of a legendary orcish hero manifests in his heir, making him more resistant. Every incoming damage is reduced for x% for x seconds.
---
\- **Ancestors wrath** \- While 'Ancestral guardian' is active, the priest can decide to consume the effect to instead enlarge his damage for x% for x% seconds.
---
Just a spontabeous idea. While Orcs strength can come from demons, from elements and from their warrior nature, I thought, that they also are proud of their heritage and their ancestors, so i tried to focus on that for priests.  
---
Not that I want it anyway in the game, I just like world building and cant resist to participate. :-P
---
OP after much research I believe I have[ found the solution](http://i.imgur.com/x7VEa.png) to this burning issue! thank me later, and Light be with you!
---
I enjoyed this post. Just play both. ;)
---
Poor man is delusional.
---
F
---
The only reason I can back at all after Cata was to play Troll Druid.
---
I promise I will slaughter many low level hordes in the name of The Alliance.
---
Nah, no need.  3 minutes after chunks of people leave classic back to modern or even unsub entirely they'll have made a server for 10 people.  I'd rather have them spending resources and time on servers that people actually might play on after the first month.
---
Clueless moron..
---
Nothing set in stone until the realm list is released. If you're right, then I guess you get to be happy that thousands of people are disappointed, but otherwise they have a right to hold out til then.
---
*cries in mage*
---
Het is negenennegentig, niet  negen en negentig.  KAP MET JE SPATIEGEBRUIK
---
Classic is also the 7.3.5 patch of the game.
---
Gorgeous! Thanks for sharing, I've just received a new desktop background!
---
FPS ≠ Ping
---
They are "one with the nature"
---
Indeed what ever i say. Because in both our discussions you have contributed 0 arguments based in reality.
---
Ok
---
Go look up Preach or Venruki, or any other WoW youtuber that was against classic and then tried it and fell in love with it.
---
They always bring up the social interaction and community. That's not an opinion, that's a fact.
---
Im only 1 man but yes, i was joking about the original suggestion.
---
In ubrs it’s not plate. And you absolutely can roll. Just say it beforehand.
---
As I wrote somewhere else:
---
"Quite a few people are going insane with current bugs on discords I follow saying this and that about the death of Classic already, and I'm not exaggerating.
---
Myself, I believe the team will keep on delivering that the community asks for, and we will finally be able to relive the experience we're so much looking after and can't find in any other game."
---
Considering the good amount of fixes done within the last week, I think it's safe to say there is a lot more coming, and I'm hopeful for it all.
---
I'd assume people that don't care about speed leveling and looking for a taste of battle will pick STV. The more "serious" ones, not so much. Frankly I'd like to go to STV just so i can witness big clusters of people killing each other. i'll enjoy it as long as i can before the 60s start popping.
---
I know for a fact a ton of people are hyped for a trilogy done again (save for LFG, which shouldn't make it to WotLK if they're a bit smart)
---
Classic - TBC - Wrath, reboot or leave three servers, dividing the playerbase won't be a problem since there'll be way more people willing to play than now
---
&gt; I don't think people would complain if they sneaked this change in.
---
Have you seen the lunacy some people are predicting with minor changes? People believe the WoW economy is some precious rainforest that must never be disturbed else or it will permanently collapse. Everything must be just the way it was, no matter how awful, because that's how it was. People disagree on aoe looting because it will somehow increase farms yields, despite it having no impact on respawn timers or amount of mobs lol. Imagine the pandemonium if they doubled the amount of ore you could carry!
---
I won't be too upset if it's already taken. I have a lot of name ideas and the first thing I'm doing is making a bunch of characters to reserve them lol.
---
Hey I’m pretty sure it added coords too pal! Lol
---
It will be a WoW2. But people will call it Classic+.
---
Games not even out and you want to connect? Smh
---
do yourself a solid and go rogue.
---
The guides don't work so well when everyone else is following them and there's a lot of mob contention.  OP has also never played vanilla before. He's not making 60 in a week and he's not going to be raiding in greens.
---
You act as if everyone who plays classic browses this subreddit. I didn't even know about the petition and I've wanted RP-PVP servers since the start.
---
Funny how I get downvoted for asking a plain question. Having the choice between deleting your bank alt and trying to find a name for a third char is not one I want to have to make. For all I care my bankalt could be called Frodobankings as nothing seems less important. 
---
Different strokes for different folks, but i’ll be using my reservations for characters I actually intend to play and get recognized by.
---
Why wouldnt you have time to play? Warrior isn't at any disability with a pocket healer. I soloed a warrior to 60 in a little over 6 days played back in vanilla they are perfectly capable and with items become beasts. I would say that 2 man combo would have comparable results to anything else you would duo since dungeons become free parties.
---
What was the process for making a bank alt in Vanilla?  I admit that I never actually created one. I think it was the process of starting a guild and getting a bunch of random peeps to sign the charter?  I hated having to spam town asking for people to do that.
---
Classic isn't live yet. If you dont have Beta access you also cannot connect.
---
That’s because no server is available.
---
Maybe paladin is worse for levelling?
---
Simply "sound in background" you have to tick it, you'll hear the sound outside of the game
---
Never played RP.. What's the point of RP PVP server, griefing?
---
How did you get that number? I don't think that's accurate but I also don't think my numbers are accurate, I think the truth is somewhere in the middle so like 30% of a level. But like I said that would go down drastically at 21 and 22 as you gain levels on every single mob in the instance. And at 22 where do you go from their to instance level?
---
Wouldn't you need to be an orc for that to make sense?  Or only say it when you kill orcs?
---
I watched a video today about a spot you can get to which is a darkspear troll camp. its mostly in game to see while flying over but with some decent wall jumping you can get there and farm it pretty easily
---
Unless you have particular talents or set-bonuses, you have no mana-regeneration within 5 seconds of spending mana.
---
So you'll want to not cast for extended periods of time and then do all the necessary casting at once.
---
And yeah, in the time you are not casting to regenerate mana, you might aswell pick up a cookie from the floor. :)
---
So on pservers, the fastest leveling has been done by mages who AOE farm. This method has outpaced questing/leveling guides so it's interested to think about AOE dungeon farming. 
---
The core of the group would be 2-3 mages, 1 warlock, and a priest, no tanks required. A hunter or warlock a great for large pulls and it's easy to AOE the mobs down without a tank. This method was very viable on the beta servers between lvl 30-40.
---
Now perhaps AOE farming solo is still more xp per pull, but there is a lot to consider when in the open world. Competitions and/or waiting/traveling between respawns. A dungeon would have an advantage over both of those issues. And as long as you spend at least 15 minutes per run, lock-outs shouldn't be a problem. 
---
So AOE farming dungeons may be the fastest way to level and it wouldn't surprise me if a lot of the 1st lvl 60's use that method.
---
&gt;	or i will be speaking to them with the voice of God
---
I don’t see the problem here.
---
They actually shut down classic forever so you don't need to try and log in anymore. Just uninstall classic from you computer and play BFA.
---
Can you shoot me a link or anything to look it up by? 
---
Would love to check it out
---
You missed off "and find out they lied about being divorced" a few weeks after "meet up in real life". Speaking from experience.
---
Simply tick "Sound in Background" or something in the sound options, below music and all, and you'll hear it when alt-tabbed. You can disable music to hear it better as well. Also, CTRL + S disables/enables sound effects, CTRL + M disables/enables music
---
You don't have to lead the pack, just being in the top 20% will make things much easier for you.
---
Being in the bottom 20% will also be easier, as the pack will have mostly moved on by that point and the newbie areas won't be quite as crowded.
---
I don't RP, but I think there should be a dedicated place for it. I'm all in for RP-PVP servers
---
what if the sun doesnt rise tomorrow?
---
You are tank healer you reserve whatever the f* you want pre raid and you can also just take clothies dps when you want to farm your melee gear.
---
It's great you're posting this here but please get with someone who can post this on the actual beta forums, submit a bug report in game, etc.
---
Again I think it's fantastic that people are going to these lengths to report issues, but I've seen entirely too many situations where someone posts on Reddit, hopes it will get some attention, it doesn't, and then is forgotten. Best of luck in getting this fixed!
---
I appreciate the write-up but I was just joking , it's always good to have those gaps for regen I know :)
---
This had custom animations too, which like, no otger Machinima ever had.
---
That looks great! I don't know what animation should be done for some classes, but I really like the concept.  
---
I play hunter myself, is it possible to make a "bow shooting" animation? I don't think a spinning bow would fit that well.
---
Also, what can I use this icon for? Again, that's really beautifully done, good job!
---
All I'm saying is if there's ONE rp-pvp server, it will do no harm to the population and i can almost guarantee that shit would be high/full on the regular even after the population goes down. But only if it's ONE server per region.
---
You can skip the worst part of it, which is Northern Stranglethorn, for levels 30-35. Alternative zones for those levels are Desolace, Thousand Needles and Arathi Basin.
---
Arathi Basin has very few non-Elite quests for Alliance, though. Most Alliance go through STV North because Arathi Basin has very little, and Desolace/Thousand Needles are far away.
---
Keep dreaming bud. I'll corpse camp the shit out of you if I ever find you in Classic.
---
And if you're playing a race that has 2 different casting animations it doesn't work as well. Works really well with stuff like Male Tauren
---
Gnome rogue using it can stealth as a tauren model
---
His thought is probably, having action bars, combat text, health screens, on top of the main game viewing error ruin looking at the pretty graphics of the game.
---
3 fps is harder to play with than 200ms ping. He's saying that you should suck it up and stop whining.
---
And my wang!
---
It's working fine.  This in and out shit didn't work in vanilla.  Your experience is based on the shit pirated realms that have nearly everything wrong.
---
I have a Troll Druid and a Night Elf Mage in retail. An Undead Paladin sounds awesome.
---
Outstanding move
---
People say this was bad but its literally the best machinima ever
---
From my dad's computer.
---
https://youtu.be/zqjXrJZ3kbc?t=354
---
start time is around there, i am at my office so its muted
---
Everyone should just speak English, duh!
---
You literally described opinions. Literally. 
---
Also why would I look up flavor of the month wow youtubers who change their onions and cash in on whatever in popular to make a decision on something.
---
If they plan on getting rid of layering ASAP I suspect they will need to provide a lot more servers than that if we're looking at around 3k per faction per realm.
---
But hey, having to login 2 hours before a raid hoping you will get past the 2k queue is part of vanilla wow experience :)
---
People like you are the best to repeatedly shit on in game cuz you can tell you actually get mad lmaooo
---
The idea that I could cost you a keyboard or monitor just through wow honestly puts a smile on my face 
---
See u in azeroth , make sure you bottle up your post-gank-tears I here "essence of noob" sells good early in vanilla
---
Those who have played Classic and private servers have said that Classic already has less bugs than private servers.
---
Why does this subreddit act like private servers are so correct and bug free?
---
That’s for pussies.
---
We would all be fucked
---
I can.  For me it’s realizing that the fun of this game is about the social interactions I create with friends who I don’t get to as often as I used to because we aren’t in college anymore or we aren’t in the same state anymore.  
---
If I’m not playing with my friends,  then what’s the point?  So I can reflect back later in life and think ‘man, remember that time I got that drop from AQ40 that made my heal spell heal for an additional 47?  How sweet was that?’
---
Nah, for me it’s about when I can play *with* friends.  Given how busy they are with similar responsibilities the time will be difficult to align, but it’ll be that much more precious when it does.
---
I won’t be chasing server first or anything of the sort.  I’ll be trying to setup a time a couple times a week where we get together for Scarlet Monastery, or RFK, or whatever it may be.  
---
My wife and doggos are my #1.  They bring me more joy than equipping a new belt or spending an additional talent point.  I love this game, don’t get me wrong.  But I feel like it’s manageable enough for me to ensure it doesn’t consume me.
---
I can't speak for the Germans or French, i have no idea if RP is popular over there or not. I imagine it is popular but I'm an NA player. All i'm saying is ONE NA RP-PVP would do no harm to population.
---
My suggestion is a hunter. Less gear dependency. Not a one button rotation. Little gear competition. Easy leveling and fun pet training mini mechanic.
---
No worries, thank you!
---
You have absolutely no basis for this. Stop spreading misinformation.
---
Sounds like you'd enjoy the Tauren Shaman main with an Undead Spriest alt.  The Shaman class fantasy and armor fit Tauren perfectly and they are very versatile levelers. 
---
This will allow you to heal on something other than the Undead Priest.   Maining shadow sounds tough in my opinion. Spriests are difficult to gear so being able to help with gold, materials, etc from your main will help things out.  You can also have that first wand ready for level 5 from an enchanter. Maybe make friends with a tailor along the way to help with that +shadow damage gear. 
---
I personally love undead priests - been leveling one on a server that shall not be named. One of my finalists for classic along with Orc Warlock - may end up making both if i can deal with both my characters in cloth.
---
The big kicker being avoiding playing human paladin :)
---
That's exactly what I said:
---
Use the beta for testing with regular players, and invite streamers on the last month to hype it up, or invite the streamers first then invite more people to balance the ones leaving, but not stretching it out like this, when people leave and there's less testing done
---

Jesus christ these negative nancy threads are so fucking annoying. Game isn't even out yet that they didn't even have to make and here we are bitching about something. If you dont like it, stop playing it, otherwise stop complaining until you actually experience it and its released.
---
THIS feels really similar to what I’ve been doing since I quit. (Same Story minus the family). I started in TBC and never had the chance to play vanilla so this is like an entirely new game to me and I’m super stoked.
---
Warrior would be great, Prot specifically for all the tanks out there.
---
That goes against everything that a Paladin is lol.
---
Ya no joke, people say STV is bad because of the pvp but for me the mobs and those camp nesingwary quests were the most frustrating part. It seemed like mobs would aggro you from across the fucking map.
---
The pvp was there but I dont think it was any worse than the other contested zones.
---
How you gonna farm Mara if you rushing to 60? Scepter ?
---
Are you suggesting if I am a gnome rogue and use deception orb I can live my dream of Tauren stomping noobs?
---
Oh man lol delete this bro I'm not trynna have this contested!! Hahaha
---
Oh man. Imagine the priest stun resist talent stacking with orc stun resist....
---
If multiple people are expressing why they changed their opinion on something, that's a fact.
---
I also stated earlier that you don't need to socialize as much because of things like LFD/LFR, because you just hit a button instead of talking in chat. There's also not a real community anymore, because you see random people from other servers. Those are facts as well.
---
Hmm sounds cool. But not really looking to heal end game :p
---
Yeah at 46 with scepter you aoe farm as a mage to (usually) 52, then go to DM E , but no Dire maul in phase 1 D:
---
Well I think the benefits out weigh the negatives.
---
do I really have to boil this down for you 
---
I linked a source to debunk the claim you made in the context of our discussion. it doesn't matter where the source comes from. it happened to be on the front page yesterday  
---
I don't follow tipsout, I don't care who he is.   
---
you're saying some really stupid shit
---
I played a mage during vanilla... although I was a real noob and it took me months to reach level 60 I don’t remember it being a grind or boring. I probably didn’t use a good rotation at that time but definitely used more than two spells.. :-P
---
Dungeons where fun as well and I did quite a lot of them! Yeah you sheep a lot, but that’s what was needed back then. These days CC is just non existent.
---
Late vanilla early tbc I leveled a hunter. The gameplay was something totally different. Having a pet and managing it is something you just don’t have with a mage and grants a new dimension to the game. Leveling was a bit smoother than on my mage as you had more room for error (pulling mobs and so on..) 
---
Although I didn’t raid with the hunter in vanilla, I mained it in tbc. The rotation was not that more spectacular than the one of the mage. And as a hunter you where required to lay traps all the time as a means of CC. 
---
Whatever you choose, both mage and hunter are two classes I look back on fondly. Both have a different gameplay but both have a solid responsibility/expectations in dungeons and raids.
---
I wouldn't mind if they added the bonus slots to the main backup if your account has an authenticator.
---
I demand a furry server! Everyone on there shall be required to RP a non-human animal of some kind. Why doesn't anyone else support this? There's tons of furries out there. I mean, *I* wouldn't play on that server, but they still deserve a server of their own, right? I bet I could get a petition of more than 1,500 people for it.
---
Wow, it's like there was only 6 RP-PVP servers to choose from per region versus literally hundreds of regular servers. Your argument makes no sense.
---
The shit talk was on point until you took it too seriously
---
hunter was easiest to level by far. one of the first classes i got to 60. they can be dynamic enough to keep you interested. not that gear dependent for leveling and very little downtime (if at all). you could take out elites with your pet and kiting. especially if you go beast mastery. great dps for dungeons and raids end game (if you learn to use your aimed shot rotation properly). good for PvP. only con might be getting into groups but hopefully you make friends along the way. especially if you're a good dps.
---
Was going to recommend priest until I read your full comments. It may very well be there are many dad gamers with similar amounts of free time and a more fun focus wrt raiding. If so, you might have a chance to raid as shadow. 
---
Re: mage, there are more buttons while leveling than retail and you always have options to challenge yourself this applies to pvp and less so for raiding and 5 mans. Raiding can be more monotonous (rotationally) but you may enjoy perfecting your timing/rotation/meter chasing. 
---
Hunter is an easy pick given your circumstance and though you’ll take some crap (huntard) it can be a rewarding class and you have a unique mini-game to keep your interest in pet farming. I didn’t raid back then as a hunter but I had a bunch of fun in pvp and general open world content.
---
RPPVP at launch is a must.
---
20k
---
Classic wow been available for years but the sheep only start to play because they are told to not because they fully enjoy the game and want to play out of passion. Its not gate keeping, its watching this community die and become the shit that everyone try to leave in the first place to go play vanilla on private servers.
---
I've never understood this logic. Priest / warrior would have the lowest barrier to entry to dungeons than any other class, you're a tank healer. If you were a shit tier rogue you may find your entire night consists of MAYBE getting into ONE dungeon group.
---
What, margaritas come in so many varieties even 'real' ones.
---
\*confused horde stare\*
---
&gt; "I get my opinions from second rate youtubers"
---
Which ones are saying this is an exploit?
---
Thanks for sharing the petition. Really happy to see that we are getting a lot of signatures because of this. Hopefully it will make Blizzard reconsider their stance on RPPvP. 😊
---
I'm going to be the first one to suggest you go Druid.  First of all they are very versatile, so you don't have to worry too much about having made the "wrong" choice.  They are excellent solo players, and if you want to tank dungeons and elite quests while your wife heals you got it going on!  If you decide you really like healing, you can easily swap into that role (and honestly, apart from PW:Shield, healing is pretty similar between the two classes).
---
You also have some great utility: You can innervate her, battle rez her if she dies, or off-heal in the event she is needed for HER utility such as Mind Control.  
---
Also, since you would be leveling as Feral, virtually none of your loot drops would overlap (as they would if you played Mage).
---
Just my two cents, good luck!
---
Because it ended prematurely, obviously.
---
&gt; That makes no sense. Benelux and UK has almost nothing culturally in  common with the Nordic countries. And those countries aren't even  northern Europe. They're central and western Europe. 
---
Dude, that depends on which source you use.  The UN says that the UK is northern Europe. And since when is Netherlands in central Europe? LOL. Have you been smoking something or what?
---
And besides, the French in Belgium and Luxemburg don't speak English that well, so they will join French servers if there is one. 
---
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern\_Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Europe)
---
The Benelux is always categorized as Western, not central Europe.
---
In the end a lot of countries will be in the English realms except: Russian, German, French, English and Spanish.
---
And the rest will be in the English realms as it always has been.
---
Well, if you think so, would you care to provide some arguments? All you are telling me is, that you ride on the "ret, prot-pala, moonkin, ele shaman, enhancement shaman" are terrible meme-specs train without knowing anything about any of those specs.
---
**Northern Europe**
---
Northern Europe is a general term for the geographical region in Europe that is roughly north of the southern coast of the Baltic Sea, which is about 54°N. Narrower definitions may be based on other geographical factors such as climate and ecology. A broader definition would include the area north of the Alps. Countries which are central-western (such as Belgium and Switzerland), central (such as Austria) or central-eastern (such as Hungary and Poland) are not usually considered part of either Northern or Southern Europe.
---
Historically, when Europe was dominated by the Roman Empire, everything not near the Mediterranean region was termed Northern Europe, including southern Germany, all of the Low Countries, and Austria.

It's wow lol, u would've never made it in mw2 dude

You bottle those tears up too, I'll buy em  in bulk! Love farming noobs
---
Annihilator Axe is a weapon Blizzard put in the game. How is that an exploit to use it? World buff stuff aside, that is an asinine statement.
---
Oh u right.
---
One possible wild card to profit from, at least on Horde side could also be wool cloth. From what I recall there aren't many that great places to farm it, you need it for the cloth turn ins, bandages and tailoring so with a bit of a lack in great farming spots and the few there are maybe being somewhat contested wool just might become a bit of a bottleneck and somewhat sought out at one point in server economy. If you're lucky, you might be able to bank on that. But it's a wild card, might pay off, might not.
---
Exaggerating the state of classic to get attention and feel important... username checks out
---
You're kind of projecting here aren't you? I never stated that I'm one to rage at a video game, nor is this the case. I just think gnomes are a shitty race. Wouldn't surprise me if you've got some anger issues yourself. 
---
Also, you're not going to shit on anybody bud. Gnometards like you usually get camped by my orcy boys until they log off.
---
Anyway, I do hope I see you in Azeroth mate. Can't wait to kill you and sit on your puny corpse
---
That would be great cuz I now I know not to pick Chromaggus horde
---
Well...username checks out I guess.
---
For me the plan is to start lbrs and brd as soon as I can to start getting pre raid gear and attuned. Chain running lbrs is decent money as well. Also, farming essences for robe of the archmage should drop a decent amount of elemental stones and essences that will be in demand at the start.
---
My point is if your rushing to 60 how are you going to obtain a scepter
---
You can go all the way, level it to 35 and have bank alt and 300 crafter
---
paladins can revive the dead. necromancers review the dead. ergo, paladins are necromancers.
---
English  it's structure is more closely related to Frisian than German. Even Dutch is more closely related to English than German.
---
Jesus you’re a fucking asshole. And you’re just as clueless and stupid as you’re saying he is. He’s actually the one who’s right here, go ahead, delete your comments so you don’t look more fucking stupid than you already do.
---
On RP servers, more like Netflix &amp; Chill.
---
No one is against it, they just think it's stupid to petition over something that so few people will use. Look through this thread for a prime example: 90% of people say, "I'm not going to play on it, but why shouldn't they have it?" It wouldn't be any more populated than any other type of realm. Again, if Blizzard does it: cool. If not: whatever. The people complaining about it can go ahead and complain, just like I can continue telling them they're stupid for asking for something so few people would actually use.
---
My point is if your rushing to 60 you won’t be able to obtain a scepter
---
I've never played a RP server, but man that's what I imagine it is: https://youtu.be/j_ekugPKqFw
---
Definitely need more eyes on this. Thanks for sharing it here.
---
To be fair, most wpvp is ganking and the ganker leaves when support arrives. People sticking around and building armies is memorable because it's rare.
---
It’s really good. If you liked SotN you’ll love bloodstained.
---
Yep. I don’t think the animation is quite as developed as races meant for being a rogue but it’s definitely there
---
Apparently, you don't know a lot, because if you think vanilla ret is terrible in pvp, you've either never played ret in pvp or were severly undergeared and underexperienced when you did. Which is reasonable, considering 13 years would put your start date close to the end of vanilla.
---
Hey! I can only really speak regarding hunter, since that's what I'm planning to main. It's a great class for leveling and gold-making, that makes some people actually prefer to have it as alts. It's a fairly easy rotation, but difficult to perfect, and it's a very fun class for PvP (there is going to be some downside if they don't change leeway mechanic).  
---
Priest sounds like a wrecking-ball for PvP and mage, even though there is really one PvE skill, sounds really fun to me, there is a large kit for PvP, great AoE potential, good farming and utility overall.  
---
IMO, any class can be a good experience if you have the right mindset, so hope you enjoy your time in Classic!
---
this is a joke right.....
---
came here to say this. for lore purposes it would be cool if all of the skills were renamed and reskinned for undead
---
You are indeed “boiling down” something for me, but it’s not the claim, the discussion or anything of the sort. It’s your character, and it’s wanting.
---
I'm not the one bitching nor am I the one having to carry shitters who actually think they contribute to the raid with 3 fps lul
---
&gt;I never stated that I'm one to rage at a video game
---
You didn't need to lmao 
---
Your "orcy boys" are shitcans lmaoo not to mention ugly as fuck
---
I love knowing that your blood is boiling after getting absolutely demolished by a character model the size of a cask of mead
---
30 MS i can't imagine that ping, I live in WI, and have never gotten better then 80
---
Murloc Rogue.
---
yeah the regular puntings gets old lol
---
It's not very difficult to obtain at 46
---
but they are adorable !
---
90% of people? You're generalizing quite a bit there. You also act as if everyone who plays WoW browses this subreddit.
---
Hi guys !
---
So I still can't make up my mind, so here's my situation and I'd like you to tell me what class fits me the most. 
---
I am very busy with my job and I don't have a lot of time to play (say 30min a day and way more on weekends). So I'd like something easy to level to keep up with my friends and that can find a place in raid easily. 
---
Thanks !
---
PS : I'm hesitating with wartank, mage and warlock.
---
What about using then instead of than?  J/K I couldn't help it.  ♥ ♥ ♥
---
lol, you're an idiot
---
They were reskinned night elves back then.
---
Think U missed a vowel. 
---
Also, mge obv.
---
Now THIS is a very smart idea.
---
I remember being on rp-pvp.com before there were official rp-pvp realms, RIP The Maelstrom....
---
 Shout out to The Black Flag Armada, Kul Tiras Marines and The Shadow Watch!
---
1.5 second global CDs. every thing should feel fine
---
What part of rushing to 60 excludes getting a scepter?
---
It's when you made it personal instead of your standard shit talking.
---
Classic wow is the game that made me not a gamer any more. After classic. Nothing was ever good enough. Every time I tried to pick up a new game it just felt like it was shit. So excited to have it back. Tooled around on a lot of private servers. Glad to not have to play with Europeans any more. Not that I have an issue with them. It's just the pissing matches in world chat got old. As much America's fault as theirs and, also the weird play times they keep were troublesome for me. To clarify I do understand it's not weird to them as they are in a very different time zone.
---
alright buddy
---
What do you farm in Mara?
---
&gt;lol, you're an idiot
---
And this is the guy who said he doesn't baby rage LMAO pog response really shows your calm, collect, and definitely not shit.
---
&gt; Raiding is such a small part of the game.
---
For some people. It was by far the largest part of the game for me and many others.
---
There is a max. I just don't know what it is.
---
It makes perfect sense because we're only getting a handful of PVP, PVE, and RP servers to choose from.
---
Probably 2 PVP, 2 PVE, 1 RP for EU and 1 of each for the two US coasts. That's it.
---
There's no room for RP-PVP.
---
Go full arms/fury spec instead, your survivability won't be an issue in end-game 5-mans either way.
---
TPS &gt; Survivability
---
Aoe grind the snakes (non elites) by using the scepter
---
You can't attack people in the starting area of the other faction. You'll have to go to contested zones like Redridge, Ashenvale or Duskwood.
---
&gt;They're both far better games than Vanilla wow.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Oh nice TIL.
---
Yeah the exp loss per hour doing that is HUGE though 
---
Like, HUGE
---
No, but I’ve got a few different 1-10 runs on Troll that I can put up!
---
There's 3 weapons with the exact same effect.  The Annihilator Axe is the only one that stacks with other armor reducing effects.  The other two don't.   So, it was either bugged in vanilla, and just not fixed, or it was not working properly on the pirated realms.
---
Nice try 2nd account.
---
Moron.
---
You sound like you're an edgy teenager, is this true? POGGERS IN THE CHAT
---
Urea these guys don't understand that thorns and ret aura along with a larger health pool and the fact that warriors and paladin have shit mitigation at these levels and drugs don't makes bears 1000 times better for aoe pulls
---
So we're twin Emperors effectively :D
---
What country still has conscription?
---
Of it's where I'm thinking, kinda between Winterspring and Felwood, these trolls are neutral for alliance and makes a wonderful place to farm, but friendly to horde.  Don't waste your time getting there if you're horde.
---
They were intentionally putting that many people in that layer.  If I am not mistaken at that point in the stress test they had minimized the layers to try and stress test as best as possible.  If I had to bet money I would say that a Blizzard rep specifically asked for him to set up an event like this for that purpose because they know he can get that type of thing going from his stream and followers.  At launch there will be more layers, but most likely also more people, so initial questing will be difficult but once everyone fans out to the different areas it should lighten the load and make for better gameplay.
---
“Opinion: statement of belief or feeling. It shows one's feelings about a subject. Solid opinions, while based on facts, are someone's views on a subject and not facts themselves.” ... “A fact is a statement that can be proven true.”
---
Fuck you Shoresy!!
---
There is basis for it.
---
Blizzard said EU would only be getting "several: realms.
---
Their not giving 20% of the playerbase a server in their own language, which suggest the entire playerbase isn't getting more than 5.
---
i think 'a lot' is a hyperbole. most EU players will stick to EU servers, i'm sure.
---
Huh interesting. I would lean towards it being bugged in private servers but I guess we'll see.
---
yeah would be cool but wont ever happen
---
sounds to me like hunter would be the best fit for you. i didn't play at 60 in vanilla, but i was pretty hardcore on a private server some time back. my main was a hunter, and i loved every moment of it. you're a beast in PvP, both BGs and wPvP. Great damage and utility. You're selfsustained with the ability to farm Mara/DM for gold. the skill-roof is crazy high, which really makes mastering the class feel rewarding and good. 
---
I'm gonna be rolling a hunter when classic launches. no doubt in my mind, and i'll gonna be loving every second of it. Hope to see you down in the trenches with me
---
Not all heroes wear capes
---
Lmao you've gotta be kidding
---
It's shit talking, the dude started off by calling everyone idiots
---
Either you're trolling or you're just extremely stupid.
---
Or you can't read, but seeing as you've replied to me numerous times I assume you can. Go try and read again
---
You can say exactly the same thing about holy priests and somehow no one cares
---
Least wanted? How so? Aren't they top DPS through most of classic?
---
We don't know that Blizzard is only aiming for 3k concurrent players per realm. That was only a limitation of technology at the time.
---
And they could keep Layering all the way until Phase 2.
---
I think you have 10 hours after the gates are opened to turn in the quests and obtain the mount. Dont know about the difficulty though. Was too hc for me atleast during vanilla.
---
If your plan is to experience all leveling has to offer(dungeons, elite quests, etc), it's a no brainer to go a warrior/insertclassthatcanhealhere.
---
Man, I don't think I've ever seen a more salty person on reddit haha
---
Does that mean you agree or disagree?

---
Edgy teenager payolas actually tyvm
---
Hey man, you can call me edgy all you like that won't change me doing a /cackle on your corpse bahahaha 
---
Well if its the case then BLizzard should give the option to players.  I don't care that another player have the new character models/animations if I have the game the way I want.
---
It's no different than players having addons that modify the interface.
---
It's faster when in a launch type scenario people proved this already on beta with layers 30 to 40 times where much faster in sm then in solo questing/grinding even with layering
---
Best. Day. Ever.
---
&gt;HorriblePerson6
---
*Questions*
---
By all means, completely blow over the facts i brought up about LFD, LFR, Phasing, not seeing similar faces on you realm like you use to back in the day.
---
Classic WoW isn't hard, raiding wise it's easy as hell compared to Mythic raiding in BFA. So you tell me, why do people prefer Classic if you don't think it's the social interaction and community despite people COMPLAINING over fucking layering and how it will break the game.
---
Having no ammo turns you in to a melee hunter. You never want that. Having someone in your dead zone turns you into melee hunter and....
---
How you overcome this is part of what separates a decent hunter from your garden variety huntard. So yeah, it’s a weakness that comes up regularly and you’ll need to learn to deal or reroll rogue.
---
You're an idiot
---
It's glory to the alliance, this Cringe Game of Thrones shit expansion is nerd made
---
So, a lot of people are posting misinformation here without much to back it up.
---
Dungeon grinding in a 5man party is faster than solo questing leveling for most classes.
---
A hunter with an optimized quest path, or an AoE grinding mage will level faster. An optimally questing warlock/druid is on the fence. 
---
Every other class will level faster with a fast 5 man party. It takes a lot of focus and skill to make it efficient and fast (Read: Nearly 0 downtime between pulls, clearing Deadmines in sub-30 minutes). The difficulty goes on slopes - each time you start a new dungeon it is hard, but as you level and get gear it gets easier until you start the next dungeon. 
---
It is also very repetitive - you would have to grind Deadmines for 3--4 hours, then stockades for 5-7 hours, then SM for a long time, Zul'farrak for 10-13 hours.  
---
The benefits are that it is somewhat mindless, you don't need to keep  track of quests and hearthstones so much - just be good at playing your class. You will be geared to the teeth the whole way so have a fairly easy time, and its more fun to play with friends whereas solo leveling is by yourself and you have to deal with competition the whole way up.
---
If vanilla and TBC were merged into one where the core was vanilla but had the class balance and raids of TBC it could shatter the gaming industry.
---
Few people get it partly because of difficulty but most due to the fact that the gates are usually rushed, you're competing against other guilds and dont have time to nurture more than one scepter holder per server.
---
Dude, you are trying way to hard
---
I think some people consider it a more 'realistic' way to rp in-game, but with the current playerbase I can't imagine that it won't devolve into griefing.
---
I like RP, but I dunno that I'd want to roll on an RP-PVP server. Now I can get ganked in-character? Lol.
---
It definitely doesn’t rhyme.
---
I guess you can’t regulate priests to one racial group (trolls) on the horde, so it makes more sense to leave it as the undead.
---
The only other realistic horde race to be a priest would be Tauren due to being extremely spiritual, but that’d just look funny.
---
Awesome, exactly the type of hypothetical content I was looking to inspire.
---
&gt; Probably 2 PVP, 2 PVE, 1 RP for EU and 1 of each for the two US coasts. That's it. 
---
???  
---
What are you even talking about? Are you saying there's only going to be 6 servers per region to choose from on the launch of Classic?
---
Atleast you'll be drinking together when you're oom all the time. :)
---
At least our king’s battlecry is genuine, your warchief just screamed it so her meatshields would get the fuck up.
---
I don't think you understand the cost and resources that goes into *completely remaking an MMO along with its game engine from the ground up*.
---
Hope you're still interested by 2030.
---
Wait what? They aren’t giving Oceania a server? We have so many on retail, we can’t just get one for classic???
---
This is something which excites me! I took a week of my vacation time this year to no life it. I am banking on a lot of people not having that week to go as hard so I can get ahead of the zerg and stay ahead. Although with the way layering is we may not have the massive mobs of people like we all anticipate!
---
It's not like either are really creative, nor do they rhyme.
---
POGGERINDACHATTUH is trying too hard for you? Sorry I'm a Payolas ! Fan *lil payo*
---
You're replying on 2 different threads and I'm trying hard ? Kek 
---
Don't get it twisted! You're my morning entertainment hehe if this is trying hard for you you have no idea what corpse camping really is then
---
This is simple Reddit banter , takes 0 energy. At least corpse camping I'll have to cast a few spells and then emote on you . Oh and then wait to watch where you Rez at ofc
---
There are no naming rules for rp anymore
---
Gl with that when there is 25 other people trying to kill those mobs
---
&gt; hitting 60 then grinding AV rep for gear then being in BGs most of my play time
---
AV is not going to be in the game for a while.  It's phase 3 with WSG, and BWL.
---
People wanting to exploit the system will take all the time they want to find a way to do it. People who just want to test the system to check if it's not broken won't take that much taime to test it blindly.
---
I want one rp server because so i can say to my victims : pve server that way
---
Dope!
---
im from argentina, and since there are no south american server, i need to play on constant +165ms all the time
---
This is a good/interesting point. I'm not against RP-PVP servers (I played on ED for a while and it was okay), but I think it's possible RP servers themselves won't be too popular for Classic. Most of the serious RPers are RPing characters not available in Classic and have little or no interest in starting over with Classic. I wonder how popular the RP realms will be... I haven't seen anyone here really talking about them...
---
I want to sign this but I am a dorf and don't understand technology.
---
Happy cake day!
---
Ah, good, less competition on my loot.
---
True, but once I'm mid 50s I don't really care about /played as much. I'll be capable of doing all the farming I'll have to do anyway, so if i hit 60 a day or two later but have a head start on gear and gold I'm ok with that. Plus my guild will be running groups so it's not like I have to spend time finding a pug or risk getting stuck in a bad group.
---
This is me, but since Nost shutdown :( 
---
Blizzard please
---
He's using zone map and you are using terrain map
---
Well then how come Alliance boys still say “For the Alliance?”
---
The source I base my info about Europe is the European list, eurovoc. Along with Cia.
---
The Un version is pretty bad and doesn't take into account cultural differences. Which is stated in its description. It's just for statistical analysis purposes.
---
Benelux is not always categorized at western. See the Cia classification, but they are correctly more like western as per the eurovoc definition, you are right about that.
---
But still. They're very different and not northern Europe. Which was my point.
---
They always get a lot of responses though. So funny riling up these pathetic people in this sub
---
For and Hor- do in fact, rhyme.
---
I was replaying WC3 and just finished RoC and started TFT yesterday. There’s a “Custom Campaign” selection  on the Campaign and Custom Games screen that has the part of Thrall meeting Vol’jin. It was a demo for WC3 and it takes place in between Thrall and the Horde leaving the Eastern Kingdoms and them landing on Kalimdor.
---
Mages drink water. I drink water. I'm a mage!
---
If you binge to 30 in the first 24 hours, you'll basically be alone the rest of the time. Layering solves the rest.
---
Fellow Emerald Dreamer. It is the best server and an original RP-PVP server.
---
Fair enough. Shaman is probably #1 in demand class so that is a good call.
---
Yeah fair enough 
---
I will likely do at least BRD and maybe another dungeon that doesn't fully require 60 but only if there's no other mages in the grp
---
I also think if I'm ahead by 40 that questing 50-60 won't be quite as bad as it would be if you're in the middle of the pack
---
You also call Venruki and Preach "flavor of the month" youtubers despite Preach probably playing WoW longer than you have and has multiple world firsts in PVE and has stuck with the game thick and thin. He's been here since the beginning, he isn't a "flavor of the month" wow youtuber. Really shows what you know about WoW if you think that of Preach.
---
Going to be farming basilisks in stv for epic mount.
---
Im a fan of new names. Would make searching for server specific videos more easy.
---
What about da exp
---
OPs map is just the individual zone maps stitched together.  the zone map for burning steppes doesn't show the real amount of inaccessible terrain to the east of it.
---
Four warlocks/hunters and a healer (or even 5 warlock/hunter) would not level even faster?
---
All of the Oceania playerbase isn't even half of the German playerbase and Germany isn't getting their own servers.
---
Be careful with all that salt, you might overdose if you're not careful
---
I think crossfire and dungeon fighter online are technically the two most succesful mmorpgs (and games really)
---
Its at the Bottom . I played it in vanilla and i played the last 3 years on Private Servers. Ret is the PVP specc in Vanilla , only thing better is a shadow priest
---
Least wanted in the sense that they are so easy to fill. But so are mages.
---
Almost there.
---
Yeah just like cat and battle rhyme.
---
Cat - Bat. It rhymes, duh.
---
I much prefer "Stand as one!" for the Alliance, though it's not like "For the Alliance" is too bad. Consider pro-choice and pro-life. They sound similar but represent very different things.
---
my side gig is while im on the computer. it is perfect for a grindy game like WoW! She is well aware I game a ton but I do it while making about 1500 dollars a month! 
---
Also she is abroad for the first month !
---
I feel like I've heard this sentence before.
---
Right, but isn't the whole dynamic on RP servers that people come up with their own character stories and only willingly interact with other players most of the time?  So it's a little different than regular PvE vs PvP.  If you are open to being ganked while roleplaying out in the world, you can make it possible and encounter other like-minded players.  The only thing you'd lose out on is the occasional unflagged character going by that you can't kill, who's probably engaged in his own roleplaying at that time anyway.
---
I guess what I'm saying is wouldn't it be easy for the RP-PVP fans to just make their own community on the regular RP servers and still get 96% of the same experience?
---
Link to this?
---
Their opinions are flavour of the month. Reading isn't hard.
---
Warlock spells are more expensive, which would be why you didn't have the gold ;)
---
Since they have no real connection with there own faction like we hordies have.
---
FOR HODOR
---
It's ok when I don't know how to respond I fall back onto "salty" too lol
---
1 character casting 5 frostbolts at once ≠ 5 characters casting 1 frostbolts at once
---
Sure you could argue it goes against the spirit of the game, but to say it's "hacking" and "cheating" is just retarded.
---
Gnome druid!!!! It makes no sense at all but they would be so cool!
---
But Germany plays on the EU servers which are not literally half the world away. You can fly one end of Europe to the other faster than you can fly Australia to USA. Why would they not allocate one server blade in the Sydney blizzard cage (which already exists, I work next to it) to allow Oceanic players a moderate ping?
---
Reading isn't hard? Well apparently it is for you because you ignore my points.
---
I'll gladly die for the horde! progress is progress, and your boy 'king' can bearly hold up a sword. He represents just how pathetic the alliance has become.
---
Sir I think you may wish to review the definition of a rhyme
---
You have linked Glacial Stone in many instances, at least on horde side where I looked, but named it Orcish War Sword.
---
Side note: I'm quite poitive that Glacial Stone is way better than Bullova. I have used Glacial Stone for a while on Beta and the proc is quite frequent. Certainly better than a 2dps increase on the Bullova.
---
I mean at 60 obviously. Your title specifies between level's 52-60.
---
NUH UH YOU HAVE TO HAVE FULL BIS AND PLAY 24/7 WITH A SHIT BUCKET IF YOU WANNA DO OUR ELITE RAIDS!  
---
lol the elitists in this sub seem to think classic was hard or something.  It wasn’t.  It was just painfully slow, grindy, and everything is locked behind playtime.  Play longer = better gear.
---
Literally no skill is involved.
---
The OGs remember the chaos in the main PS at the time when it was announced, hordes of horde players storming ironforge and Alliance and Horde all dancing naked in celebration together.
---
NERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRDS
---
ED was my home after Ravenholdt fell apart.
---
i think youre drastically overestimating the amount of coordinated people. I think of it more like herding sheep through gates :D
---
No that actually doesn’t rhyme. But for and hor do.
---
You forgot the server ceashing, if the game dont crash or run with mire than 10fps its not Vanilla expérience 🙃
---
don't do it on quest spots, and there's a group of you just out tag them.
---
It's quite obvious that you're salty, seeing the way you respond to people in this thread
---
\+1 Warlock
---
Do you have evidence to support your claim? Or are you just being delusional?
---
Why is this sub so full of potato posts?
---
You can’t just cut off letters and say words rhyme. You’re trolling
---
Yeah I thought that's pretty clear with the description , it meant how are you going to level from 52-60
---
And if I was asking about what you were gonna do at 60, why would I include the "52-" part?
---
Anyway, all good, this post is about mage exp from 52-60 and how to make up for the loss that is DM E aoe grinding
---
Literally anything but “For the Alliance” sounds so much better. For the Horde is the Horde’s ... back off and get some originality.
---
You sound like you lean more towards lock. You can roll a warr alt later and there is a what to play megathread, you should ask there
---
The increase shouldn't be compared with earlier expansions. Not sure why we would do that?
---
There were more players in WotLK than ever, so it was the most successful expansion (atleast in that regard). That's how I see it.
---
Blizz never lost subscribers during WotLK. It was a steady 11-12 million players all the way through.
---
Warriors are painful to level, Warlocks aren't. Warriors are ok in PvP, Warlocks are better. Warriors are ok in PvE (prot mainly), Warlock are better. The best classes for PvP are casters which plate won't help you. 
---
Warriors are boring as fuck, and they are almost always the most common class. Even the PServer I'm playing on right now (netherwing) is full of shitty "I want to dps, why can't I find a raid guild that wants me" type of autism. If you want to go prot, go warrior. If you don't I would say go Warlock.
---
Depends what you want to do.
---
2H melee weapons are only seriously used in PvP.
---
Imagine not wanting the Ruin talent.
---
It’s really about what you want to do while you level and in endgame. Groups for dungeons and raids always need a tank and a healer, so as a warrior you won’t have trouble finding groups. You can also go the dps route, but unless you’re really freaking good I think I recall a lot of people being against dps warriors in their groups. It’s fun though to be versatile with stances and end people with execution, especially in PVP.
---
Warlocks do mad dps using mainly dots and aoe. All groups need dps as well, but general it’s a saturated market, but that’s not a bad thing. Locks do sick nasty damage, have pets, and have that cool dark aspect to them that cannot be understated. You can also summon people, which is pretty cool. They’re fun for PVP and when you’re doing endgame content your job is to be a dps bad ass. 
---
If you’re talking endgame content it just depends on what you want to do. Warriors at least have the option to go down the path of being a bad ass tank or doing some dps, and as a lock you only have one choice there. But it’s a lot of fun either way, and some people hate being a tank.
---
He said loot council not DKP though
---
Add that RP-PvP servers were added quite late after launch with no way to transfer to them. Yeah, that data showing they aren't as popular toooootally says how unpopular they are...
---
This is mostly irrelevant because you will have to spend time leveling solo and you will be dps for that. At endgame you can spec full heal but by then you’ve already learned what is or is not compelling about healing for you.
---
Much of the progress comes in learn how to develop your skills which is something you don’t need a recount for, you can see it in real time. People pick up on the difference between a good healer and an inexperienced one really quickly and it shows up in the form of invites, friend requests and comments like “holy shit I can’t believe we lived”. 
---
It’s not like dps where if you get a pendulum at level 39 you are instantly god-tier. Gear for a healer is a big deal, but gear without skill has less impact imo.
---
He's saying they won't bother looking into him. Which they won't. The problem is multiboxing is allowed so nobody will even report him for any kind of abuse.
---
I have noticed this too for sure. I need a lot more room to work and you absolutely cannot make hamstring kiting efficent if you run through the mobs. 
---
However it is still possible and if you're smart and aware of your surroundings you should still be good. I was doing The rock elementals in badlands last night as well as some Ogres and theres a ton of mobs patrolling around those areas but I was still able to learn the roamers paths and kite just fine. Just takes a little more skill / awareness.
---
&gt;people
---
So... You. Lol
---
Like I said, when you have nothing left to respond with, just toss in the word "salty"
---
The more I talk to you the more convinced I am you *are* indeed that type of person I originally commented about that gets visibly angry when corpse camped
---
You're making me salivate with excitement for classic I literally can't wait to camp you and people like you ahh so stoked
---
Blizzard said EU would only be getting "several" realms and they're not giving 20% of their EU playerbase their own realm. That suggests no more than 5 realms for all of Europe. NA has near identical player population to Europe, suggesting the same. Layering is specifically meant to prevent realm mergers by overpopulating servers at launch.
---
Lol even if its 1v5 its still competition and if you think there isn't people avoiding quest spots to grind other then you 5 your wrong. It will be doable either way and eventually you will hit max level but to say things like dungeon exp sucks when it was by far the fastest from 30 to 40 on beta is just silly
---
Originality? It's not like it's a complex quote of several words. Using "for the" could be anything, so ehh on that.
---
It's a very long quest requiring a lot of raid timers per player.  When there are competing guilds for server firsts the window of opportunity shrinks greatly unless they work together even across faction to ensure multiple lords.  
---
Keep in mind, this quest has many items that can only drop for one person, some of those items are only dropped once per kill and not gauranteed to be picked up by the quest holder.  It might get picked up by anyone in the raid who would then have to trade to the quest keeper.  And it's of basic quality so the master looter won't even see it.  
---
I have done this quest, it's not a matter of you just picking it up and roaming the world.  You should go read about the chain.  It's called "The Scepter if the Shifting Sands" chain.  I will provide a link for you but have not read to verify its accuracy, and it's been many years.
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/The_Scepter_of_the_Shifting_Sands_quest_chain
---
Please keep in mind, while you might get this and begin the project, your guild must also agree that you will receive assistance to do these feats as well as be able to just perform the feats as a Guild.  
---
Good luck.
---
I say this completely unironically: they aren’t WoW.
---
That’s the catch that I am beginning to realize. Any game I get into eventually gets dull because I just want to be in Azeroth again grinding for loot and grabbing talent points.
---
And no game scratches the loot itch. I hate ARPGs like Diablo because the loot system is so broken.
---
Dwarf!
---
Pathetic people create them.
---
How much do you expect to earn with that recipe?  It doesn't seem worth it
---
Just FYI, there is no concrete information on how many procs are meant to interact. Private servers have inferred and/or made up much of it. In all honesty, the single most inaccurate thing on private servers is procs. The second most inaccurate is coefficients which, in most cases, is made up or derived from miscellaneous guesswork from elitistjerks.
---
So, I'd be curious to see how Blizzard responds to this. Most likely there isn't a bug - but most likely they won't provide information either, because the more they disclose, the more they help private servers.
---
So edgy, hope my dad doesn't see how fun e battle Royal epic gamer lolz I make
---
I prefer dynamic respawns because it disappears the instant it is no longer necessary, whereas layering depends on the judgment of Blizzard, whom I believe to be heavy-handed. I have been present at something like 6 private server launches. Blizzard seems to believe there is a need for some system in place lasting weeks if not months. I think it is more in the order of days, especially with dynamic respawns, and I do not want to rely on them. I also believe there are regions where layering will never be necessary, but they will be affected regardless  - this would not occur with dynamic respawns.
---
Those servers aren't owned by Blizzard, they're owned by AT&amp;T and get used regardless of whether Blizzard leases them or not.
---
And Blizzard considers anything under 200ms a good ping for WoW.
---
Step 1 - Play a Mage
---
Step 2 - Farm Essence of Air, lots of them.
---
Step 3 - Post on Auction House
---
Step 4 - Buy every Essence of Air with a lower price than yours.
---
While doing this AH-scouting stand on the IF bridge and offer people conjured water/food, you'd be surprised at the amount of tips you get.

Not sure if you actually think this is a good argument or if it’s a weird joke.

---
IIRC, this all usually results in only a handful of people on each server ever getting it?
---
I could be wrong, but I feel like overzealous pride and antagonizing other races has been problematic before.
---
Arms-Warrior / Enhancer-Shaman / Frost-Mage is the by far best combo as a 3 man group. You can just pull everything, never have trouble with mana and windfury proc everything to death. If you add 10 mobs, you can just cc two of them and freeze the others.
---
Mage... If u take dmg spamm sheep and food/water out of combat... 
---
This is the main rotation in pvp
---
Making sure you have enough ammo and food for your pet before heading out of town imo makes it that much more immersive and satisfying if you like the hunter fantasy.
---
I love hunters but one thing I just cannot get ove4 is why hunters wear chainmail after 40. Imo it just completely goes against the class fantasy of wearing animal hides and being at one with nature and seeing helmets and chainmail on hunters semi ruins it for me.
---
That being said, I mained a troll hunter in the PS i played for 6 months and it was a blast. Won't be my main this time, but deffo going to make a dwarf or maybe another troll hunter again.
---
There's a lot of class fantasy and cool stuff hunters have in vanilla, eyes of the beast one of the most popular one. If the class fantasy of being the master of the outdoors and wilderness appeals to you, you'll love it.
---
AT&amp;T doesn’t have its own Aussie servers, IBM hosts all the AT&amp;T stuff. Going to disregard your opinion because I know for a fact you’re wrong :)
---
Source: work for IBM. Play with AT&amp;T vyatta provisions most days.

No, Blizzard would likely not enforce any of the rules required for a RP server to work. You are better off starting a discord or subreddit for a large RP guild. That way you can /gkick or mute anyone that breaks the rp rules.
---
Exactly. Capital city flight paths have to be unlocked.
---
200?  I play on EU servers (Frankfurt) with 100 MS from USEast.
---
I've been playing on US servers from EU for years and on average I get 150ms and that is considering I have a horrendous internet connection. Probably someone with a decent one can get 100-125ms, which is more than enough for WoW Classic, since they designed many aspects of the game to be playable at 400ish ms back when it was released.
---
In judgement of wisdom it literally says spells and melee attacks. You get Mana back from frost bolt or channeled spells, wand hits or melee attacks. There's no reason the SoR itself shouldn't be proccing it
---
Some guy I was loosely friends with gave me the gold. He then asked for it back a week later. I jokingly said no and while typing the next message to say "ok, ill send you some now and some later etc". He had blocked me before i could even send it. So free mount for me
---
Orc paladin. I always wanted to be an orc paladin. Even now I still wish they'd let me
---
This is awesome man. Get ready for some streamer / YouTuber to be using these!
---
&gt; How did you get that number?

Math.

So not including the 6 bosses, the dungeon will grant 12,110xp for a group of 20s. Bosses give more bonus xp, i don't have it mathed out tho.
---
20 -&gt; 21 requires 23,200xp, so bosses not included, 52% of a level.
---
I really wanted to get in the beta as I am not playing anything else or want to play anything else atm. The bait n switch tactic of blizzard with the few invite waves was pretty evil and they really kept their word about having enough people in.    
---
I would still like to join in as the beta open the opportunity to explore more of the dungeon content. When you are leveling, you might be doing one or two along the way but the distance or the fact you soon outpaced lvl requirement leads you to skipping most of the m. So being stuck at 30 or 40 was really cool for that.     
---
I also ended up going on private to satisfy my crave and do enjoy it. I actually even slightly regret not doing it earlier as I play mostly to relearn the ropes and be more efficient in the leveling process for the release day. I feel though that I might reach a point when I would have had my share of wow and find that I don't necessarily have the time to dive in the actual release.
---
I want to play a hybrid class. I wanna do some casual raiding and kick ass in PvP without being too dependent on gear since I don't plan playing too much. Any recommendations?
---
Yet you brought up your opinions on these things not facts like he provided. Yet again. 
---
Saying something because you believe it to be true yet annecdotal is still opinion not fact.
---
Of course it doesn't make sense to you.  You are clueless...which is another reason your "guild" will be a total failure.  The gm is a meme spec player who doesn't understand the game.  If you do find 39 people to raid with they will be just as bad and clueless as you.  
---
You didn't answer my question about your weapon. Will you be using nightfall or something else?
---
The best feeling when you are a healer is when it is a really difficult fight that pushes everyone to the limit, and you somehow manage to keep everyone alive by pulling out every spell, trick and maneuver in the book. You're OOM, the DPS are OOM, the tank is just hanging in there, but somehow you keep everyone alive.
---
It makes up for all those times that some moron hunter or mage pulls aggro off the boss and gets KOed in 2 seconds, then posts in group chat that rage-inducing message:
---
"Heals?"
---
Priest + warlock is just crazy in Classic. PcE PvP, don't matter.  it's just constant kills. Does it matter that ganking duo is 10 levels higher.. nope. Kill them anyway. The combo felt so powerful it becomes boring.
---
Priest + Rogue, is a questing powerhouse.  Priest pulls and tanks, rogues just unloads on the enemy banks. Priest pulls another before first one dies.. just not stop killing.  When doing elites,  Priest just dots the mob and shields the rogue.
---
I didn't care for Priest + Hunter, priest basically just becomes a damage add for the hunter, and the kill pace means that you really only cast every other mob, just wand the rest of the time.
---
Priest + Pally was redundant,  Between the two nothing could could kill either of you, but the kill speed for the duo wasn't enough to offset the xp split.
---
Priest + mage was pretty fun,  However later on the mage wants to AE grind, but priest holy nova + shield is difficult to make a meaningful contribution without messing up mages work flow. May just be a practice thing.
---
Priest + warrior kinda sucks for the priest, first 20 levels or so your completely carrying the warrior, and it's a real drag on your xp.  After the warrior starts getting skills and gear it gets better, but basically you become a heal bot and it's all about the warrior maximizing rage.
---
Well Blizzard upper management thinks the entire thing is going to fail population wise. That's why they will lump all of EU together with no language based splits and Oceanic in with NA since it is deemed a smaller region that won't make the one server cut when the dust settles a few months down the road. Obviously they are wrong and should make at least 1 Oceanic 1 French and 1 German server, but they won't cuz top dogs are going by "you think you do but you don't" still. Altho retail server numbers don't really indicate healthy pops anyway since everything is sharded to shit and mixed together.
---
"facts"
---
Emerald Dream was only an RP server in name. On Lightninghoof damn near everyone RP'd, on Emerald Dream I never ran across other RPers.
---
It's awesome! Can i use it for my avatar on Discord?
---
Yeah, I originally said it was the same, but realized it was just a similar comparison, so I made sure to change that. 
---
It's hard to quantify how much of the same experience they'd get on an RP server. In truth, I believe most people interested in RP-PvP, are there more for the PvP than RP, making it more accurately a 'PvP-RP' server. PvP with RP seasoning. That would attract a very different group of players than a pure RP server.
---
Warriors are essential for group PvP. They deal huge amounts of dmg and MS heal debuff is insanely strong. Warriors basically decide who the focus target is.
---
Done talking to you, you have room temp IQ my friend. Good luck.
---
I don't understand what you time has to do with being a warrior if you both duo level.
---
You basically don't have to look for a group, you both can farm dungeons all day long.

I don't disagree with that logic, I'm just saying that in many cases - when it comes to vanilla - there's a difference between what makes sense and what actually happens.
---
I may be a noob but I've never seen how that makes sense. If you're in a hectic combat situation where you need to move and cast a spell on a particular target while moving, how do you target when you're using the mouse for moving? Tab becomes useless as soon as there's 2 targets or more so I don't really see how you can do without movement keys.

You know nothing, Jon Blow.
---
To be fair, I played on RP-PVP servers for the better part of a decade, and I didn't know they had any rules.
---
I’m not a roleplayer but I will fight for your right to be one. You guys are great!
---
Its unlikely to "help" as any new zone will probably have better quests and rewards which would make vanilla zones useless. Like the new starting areas in tbc for example
---
Honestly? Yes, please. 
---
When I played Everquest I would make people RP and join me in worship of my deity before I would dump every maxed out shaman buff I could on them. Even if you aren't 100% hardcore RP it adds a lot of flavor and fun to hostile and friendly player interactions.
---
I feel like Undead in org is bis for a bank alt
---
Emerald Dream is a horrible example of an server that did RPing.
---
Not really.  Nothing to stop Xfutaponyx from crashing your RP, and you’ll end up even bigger targets because ruining other people’s fun is what PvP servers are all about.
---
I remember there being a delay for auto shot from melee in Vanilla. You bypassed this by using a shot ability as soon as you could from getting out of melee IE: Serpent sing, arcane shot or more commonly concussive shot. 
---
This was, from I remember it being caused by a combination of Melee swing timer and bow shot timer.
---
Don't forget to layering on RP-PVP servers
---
Full 30 BiS gear with low level enchants is still gonna be better than what you're likely to run around with at 40, honestly, although of course nothing stand-out.
---
The reason that streamers kept running dungeons was mostly because you just don't want to be out in the world when every player on the server is 30 and trying to level in Stranglethorn Vale.
---
You may be able to achieve similar results as leveling solo if you assemble a dedicated group, perhaps even faster, but you sure as hell ain't approaching that speed with a PuG anyway. Even with a dedicated group, you probably have to do quite a lot of dungeons in one sitting to overcome the travel time to get there in the first place.
---
That might be why they aren’t doing them.
---
Warrior tank would be great if you are interesting in group play. Being able to login and find something to do within 5 minutes is a huge plus. 30 minutes isnt enough time to clear a dungeon but you have some flexibility if you wanted to knock out some group quests or elites while leveling solo. Also finding a healer is easy, group up and knock out 3x the amount of quests you would do solo with your limited timeplay.
---
Regarding leveling speeds and keeping up with friends....warriors are known to be on the slower end but imo dont let this detur, its your schedule that is preventing you from keeping up with those that have more time than you do. 
---
Warlock will be your best bet if you are concerned about falling behind. Warlocks are indeed much faster than warriors regarding exp rate per hour. 
---
You have some options my guy,
---
But 2h weapons don't go to anyone and I want to believe warriors generally get prior on the. So the important element of warr pvp, being weapon, is easily solved.
---
But again, the group play is great the solo play is shit! What do we do.
---
Was on german rp - pvp realm back than and it was awesome how horde and alliance lined up all the way up from the closed gates of Ahn'quiraj to Cenarion Hold,  standing on opposite sides of the road on their mounts, while waiting for the cepter carrier to arrive. He walked slowly all way towards the gong and peaple roared their mound while he passed them, saluted them or dismounted and knee towards him. Then the guild had a speach, thanking alliance and horde soldiers and motivating us to fight TOGETHER against the evil forces behind the gate. The gates opened and  it was awesome to have witnessed this as a lvl 36, who had a long run to silithus and died as first after mobs spawned lol
---
I've been tanking on retails since Wrath and never got to play Vanilla. I was looking at the consumables list for Prot Warriors on Wowhead and it was really daunting. It started to turn me off of the class since I just don't know if I'll have the time to farm all the jujus, potions, etc.. Is getting consumables as a tank in Classic really that difficult?
---
&gt; when you have nothing left to respond with, just toss in the word "salty"
---
Didn't you use that as one of your first insults towards me? So I could say the same thing about you then...
---
You're salty because I called gnome players idiots and you're basically just reinforcing the stereotype right now. I don't care how many edgy insults and remarks you make, I'm still going to think you're an idiot at the end of the day.
---
But by all means, keep going if you want. Let's see how much salt is left in this bitch
---
Yeah, while I don’t think we’ll get a clear and definitive answer from Blizzard about everything, it’s at least helpful to have them look at it and make sure it’s working the same way as their 1.12 client in house.
---
Ah. I mixed you up with the other guy who is planning on being a gm of a guild while playing enhancement. That must be why you are confused.
---
You said you wanted to main tank.  How long have you been raiding vanilla/classic?  Retail vanilla doesn't count.
---
I think his point is, if you quest, you'll gain less xp than pve servers because you'll get gank/camp
---
A Dwarf Paladin called Dwarif (ye, I didn’t really have a good imagination for names back then so I just put a ’i’ between thr ’r’ and ’f’ in ’Dwarf’ :p)
---
Explain to me how using a third party program to make 5 different characters cast an ability simultaneously by pressing one key isn’t cheating. You’re essentially playing 1 character, while you bot with 4 others. It’s cheating.
---
Contributing to classic raiding consists of mostly pressing 1 button.
---
If you wanted to make a point you should've appealed to PvP'ers.
---
A little off topic but has anyone in the beta checked to see if you can still loot the book through the back of the house without having to go inside?
---
US
---
Yeah I've been on a pserver while staying subscribed and just waiting for classic and there's definitely a strange lag that some of the Russian players just don't have. 
---
STV has been a shitshow for me.
---
Yikes, imaging thinking that was funny or insulting.
---
Yeah we have room for one more. US West. We plan on taking the first couple days off and then sticking mostly to nights and weekends.
---
[Change.org](https://Change.org).....
---
OOOF.
---
Yeah whatever dude, I'm just having fun
---
All these guy saying Ret was horrible in pvp in Vanilla clearly never played at a high level in vanilla or are just regurgitating garbage they've heard from other people.....
---
Ya ret is bad pve dps, but in pvp, played by someone who knows what they are doing, ret is one of the best classes out there. especially if itemized properly.
---
The spell is seal of righteousness.  It targets your character.  The additional damage is not a spell.
---
LMFAO crying about 200 ping, good Lord you tiny countries are adorable
---
Yup. Every dominant WSG team I've ever seen has been more or less constructed around 1-2 warriors.
---
Your Horde is so pathetic you need our help to put down your insane evil leaders. Twice now btw
---
Baby girl, that’s the global switch DC. I work there. It’s IBM. We don’t even have an AT&amp;T colo lmao
---
But link me more stuff from 2017.
---
Might be easier to convince people to flag themself in the rp server
---
Shadow Priest and Feral Druid. GG
---
You can do anything with this combo. Tank, Damage and in return you can innervate her. 
---
Or warrior is always a good idea. Because Druid is not for everyone.
---
You can tank and do dps.
---
I would have if it weren't for those meddling guards! Also love your machinima vids Grim!
---
I wouldn't consider them the best class in the game for damage either, but that doesn't make them weak by any means.
---
It's not like you're either the strongest or you're weak, they're a good all around class who don't excel at any one role, but are perfectly capable of performing any role given the right gear set.
---
People who have never played one have this weird mindset that they're weak or they can't do X, and it's just completely uninformed and ignorant.
---
Huh generally catch that but oh well no one is prefect.
---
you say "we all" as if there are more then 8 people interested in this high level nerdshit. RP servers are where the real next level virgin uptight 40 year old losers dwell, how many of those are left in WoW? Aren't they in their 50's now? 
---
Firebolt, Firebolt, Firebolt, ZZZZZAPPPPP, I got you you're dead, hey I got you fall down, you're dead I zapped and firebolted you you're dead.
---
Disgusting.
---
If you really wanted to, you could set loot threshold to uncommon and only let the designated people going for scarab lord roll need on the items. 
---
I occasionally did this in strat UD/Scholo as a healer when 4+ people were trying to loot scourgestones with argent dawn trinket and the melee just insta looted every single one.
---
Real and true
---
Yeah, basically it just comes down to raid lockouts and their limitation. No matter how much guilds try to collude, there’s always gonna be someone who doesn’t give a fuck and just starts the timer.
---
nope, in our house, I play healers wife plays tanks or dps.
---
Weren't there any delays in mailing stuff to other characters back in the days? I seem to remember something like that.
---
I like that Improvement part.
---
Oh come on, that’s just playful banter
---
YESSS!
---
A few artist I was discovering their whole discographies, such as: Tool, Beck, Gorillaz, Dream Theater/Liquid Tension Experiment, David Bowie, Cream, Kraftwerk, Infected Mushrooms Pendulum(starts to bleed into TBC w/ In Silico and Wrath w/ Immersion)
---
Specific songs:
---
Where It's At - Beck
---
Neon Lights - Kraftwerk
---
Funky Town - Lipps Inc
---
Behind the Mask - Yellow Magic Orchestra
---
Young Folks - Peter Bjorn and John(maybe TBC, reminds me of waiting outside Kara)
---
Breaking Me Down - Soil
---
What It's Like - Everlast (Unbreakable PvP video for these two)
---
Bang on the Drum All Day - Todd Rundgren (Ventillo harrasment videos)
---
I'm sure there's many more that aren't coming to me now, but these songs still always remind me of wow. Most remind me of grinding xp cause that's often when I'd have a playlist on.
---
Never noticed them
---
Plot twist: night elves are reskinned twin emps
---
Exactly. You get 7 ppm on average so do you want 7, 70% of fast weapon damage or 7, 70% of slow weapon damage price.
---
Not every zone is going to be covered with people, that's the whole point of layering. Plenty of viable less known aoe spots out there
---
&gt;when it was by far the fastest from 30 to 40 on beta is just silly
---
Source? or how long per level?
---
And me, I'm telling you that there's way enough people to have one german server but yet they don't want to open even one (and I'm not speaking of one RP server but any server at all) 
---
Considering there's something like 60 german server on retail and was also dozens during vanilla, I'm just wondering why they don't want to open one and my guess is they don't expect the game to be a big success after a few months and want to have the minimum number of server.
---
So it raise the question: do they think the game won't be successful and there won't be more than a 10-12 servers after a year so they want to limit the choice?
---
Doubt it would work. I mean, it's probably better nothing, getting the community on a single server but.. You'll have people looking at you asking "wtf you nerds are doing?". You'll see ridiculous names. All the usual things. Back when I played briefly on Rp-PvP realm, you got some of gawking at the nerds, but at least they still were decent about the names, dunno about current retail. Might be harder to organize some RP events too with the gawkers possibly. It's a compromise. I think you still can turn PvP flag on at RP-servers so it miiight be better to roll on one of those and try to organize that the opposing factions RP guilds that are interested in PvP will roll there too. Won't be perfect but you take what you get.
---
There was an RP-PVP server on the stress test
---
why did you type a slash and no changes as one word
---
Cool story bro. Blizzard still leases all their servers from AT&amp;T, regardless of who owns the plot of land.
---
That's a great point!
---
239 from Croatia
---
True Vanilla expirience!! #NoChanges
---
I hope you're joking.
---
RP servers were part of original World of Warcraft, and it seems many people want them to be part of this experience 15 years later.
---
In the case you're not joking, I hope that one day other people can have harmless fun without triggering you.
---
He's just raging because people don't agree with him
---
I tend to name my bank alts with a name that sounds nothing like my other characters.  For example, if I have Skribshunter and Skribswar and Skribslock, my bank alt would be Gruntfellow.  That way when I'm swindling my guildies or friends, they don't know its me.
---
The only rules I can think of is that on RP servers you have to have your name be RP acceptable and you are supposed to talk in character, but I don't think I've ever seen those rules enforced on retail unless somebody is getting reported for it.
---
A lot of us have been waiting for more than 5+ years.  2 months isnt that big of a deal
---
No?
---
Yeah but that’s WoD and BFA so we don’t talk about that...
---
Just remember to have a little back up plan of something to keep you entertained if you can't get through the queues quickly!
---
Nice try 3rd account.
---
Easy, play warlock. Warlocks are the best class and they can still tank, not even a question.
---
It's funny, the comment above it shows empathy and tolerance, and the furry strawman is the complete opposite.
---
"Even though it existed and people want it, it doesn't cater to my needs and thus shouldn't exist."
---
I bet your ass that guy's vehemently agains gay marriage and trans rights. Just the type.
---
And there is
---
I found it extra cute he was complaining about other casters as a mage.
---
i tried to play on a RP server back in vanilla and got temp banned after only a few hours. Basically i made it to Gold Shire and saw all the sex rp for the first time. I attempted to rp my characters reaction to it which was "What is wrong with you people" apparently that was not allowed in an RP server.
---
Honestly the best/most fun is probably doing a mix of world questing/aoe grinding/dungeons. 
---
Quests are great and if you only do dungeons you'll be doing like 2-5 quests only for each dungeon range. I'd probably recommend doing a handful of the fast quests in towns as a group and then rushing the dungeon over and over again until you're leveled up enough to go to the next zone and do some of their fast quests too as a group. 
---
Feels like you could do most of a zone's early quests as a group for a couple hours and get a level or two then grind the dungeon for the next 2-4 levels and rinse and repeat for every dungeon
---
You'll have to stop a lot more for mana breaks
---
No he’s actually absolutely right. Agility scales significantly better than raw strength when in low quantities. 
---
It takes significantly more strength to reduce your mob kill time by even one hit while it takes significantly less agility to do the same thing. 
---
This math has been proven in the warrior leveling workshops. 
---
The only reason this works though is because agility scales so much better at lower levels than any other stat.
---
Thanks.  I'll dive in after work.
---
You're the one doing mental gymnastics here bud.  1 character casting 5 spells simultaneously with 1 button cast is the same thing as multiboxing?  Lol
---
If Blizzard considered it cheating, they've had 15 years to come out and say it, yet they haven't, so deal with it princess.
---
I probably should have specified Schengen only.
---
Unless you get gear from the holidays
---
I mean ya locks only have dps specs but they have a few different specs that offer different types of gameplay.
---
due to DR on HK's it quickly becomes inefficient
---
There where groups doing under 1 hr 30 min per level on streams
---
Pretty much.  Though it can be used for lvling later on, you best have a mage buddy for drinks.
---
The worst thing about ammunition is losing one bag slot.
---
Same here with In Silico and TBC. Had it on all day funnily enough.
---
Join our 2k+ member gaming community!  Meet new friends!  Classic will be a big launch.  Join us and have some fun
---
Lol nobody wants RP pvp sorry op
---
I don't think it makes much difference tho, US is still an ocean away.
---
Spirit is amazing for leveling. It’s easily one of the best scaling stats and it compounds rather quickly. 
---
Do not underestimate spirit.
---
Wouldn’t it be a slant rhyme? For and Horde don’t straight rhyme, that would be Ford the Horde (which could be a good bumper sticker on your car). But it’s a slant rhyme. If you look at most rap songs, they’re slant rhymes. The Reeboks with the *straps*. Turn around and give that big booty a *slap*.
---
This is actually the reason I want to give classic WoW a try, I hope they run a sever for it.
---
right, and random DCs on a randomized timer, but no less then 2 healers per raid boss pull. Also log in queues mandatory
---
it's the name of an addon that auto completes/accepts quests :P
---
Well between those levels I believe most will be farming for their pre-raid BiS. By the time you're all decked out you should be 60 or close. Afterwards there isn't much one can do besides farming gold for their epic mounts. Farming tiny crimson whelplings for example.
---
He'll be the one going "out of town" but to play WoW instead of work!
---
Well I threw my history book in the garbage disposal so I’m inclined to agree.
---
Also yes there is layering but blizz doesn't want the world to feel empty so I would anticipate layers to be pretty populated as you play when devising a strategy to level as they where so far on beta.
---
Elemental shamans are incredibly fun in PvP. If left unchecked, the amount of damage output to the opposing team is just absurd. Youll have a blast, guaranteed. 
---
Regarding gear youll have to compete with clothies of course so that may take some time away from your PVP time into 5m dungeons. Unless you plan on using junk 1-59 leveling gear until you hit R10? Possible for sure but thats about two month of playing with weak output.
---
There is a dude on youtube who has done a ton of testing with end game gear/pvp (using private server data of course, but still noteworthy) called Executus Gaming (also many other classes/spec's, however I specifically remember enjoying his content regarding ele shaman potential at end game pvp). Not sure if he has any tests with shadowpriest but im just referencing this user so you have some resources to further your research.
---
Don't ya wanna have the genuine classic experience? ;)
---
i believe in pvp weapon skill is always counted as your level * 5 (aka full) so it wont matter in pvp
---
but if a mob disarms you then unarmed skill... kinda helps :D
---
Grinding Black Dragon Whelps in Redridge Mountains listening to Move Along by The All American Rejects. They were the first dragons I’d seen in the game I figured they HAD to be worth something. They were not. But I had fun.
---
https://itemization.info
---
But it's still probably wrong. I seriously doubt MC and Onyxia are going to only have patch 1.2 loot tables at launch. That means no T2, no loot from Majordomo at all, half the items missing from Ragnaros, and a bunch of other problems.
---
More likely is that MC and Onyxia will have patch 1.4 tables at launch, including the Priest and Hunter epic quests.
---
Like any good Classic/Vanilla tank! 3 Sunders and AFK.
---
Its ultimately going to come down to the speed at which the server completes the war effort,  as the gong does not appear until a few days afterwards.  At this point in time everything is already known and there will most certainly be 10+ people waiting to bring the gong the second it appears.  On the previous two big pservers that I am apparently not allowed to name,  it took about 4 weeks for the war effort to finish and there were around 30 Scarab Lords from each server.
---
having a spirit set is actually legit for warrior.  you can regen crazy amounts of hp out of combat
---
Username checks out
---
:(
---
The RP and RP-PVP community isn't 100% crossover. If there isn't an RP-PvP server, a large portion will not end up on an RP-PvE server, we will be designating a PvP server as the unofficial RP-PvP anyway. 
---
This still splits the RP community and creates a PvP server where those not into the whole RP thing might be annoyed that its there. It will also open RPers up to harassment from those who will see them as weird or whatever.
---
I looked around a bit and found people complaining in 2012 that the limit was only 50. So probably it was 50 in vanilla as well. Thanks for your write up by the way. Really useful.
---
&gt; You'll have to stop a lot more for mana breaks
---
Which wouldn't be an issue if your group was, say, a mage and a shadow priest, but with a pair of no-mana teammates that'll get annoying fast.
---
The only way they can fuck it up is if they allow the world buff exploit meta into classic.  That would destroy the game.
---
Haven't been able to play anything since Classic got announced, nothing sounds even a little interesting. I'm 30 and live with my girl friend, me and a buddy got our girl friends tickets for a cruise the week of launch.
---
Says the person playing a mmoRPG...
---
Croatia to UK is a pretty big difference.
---
The difference between Zagreb to London and London to Chicago is less than 40ms.
---
Yup. They will constantly be ready to continue, and he will likely be needing to constantly stop for mana.
---
I would personally level as enhancement, then respec at 60 or close to it.
---
Multibox without using a third party program, and I won’t call it cheating. Fair?
---
Good ol auctioneer.
---
&gt; Paladin dungeon t0.5 set
---
Check out the process involved in getting that set and you will probably second guess wanting it.
---
Druid is for herbalism
---
Our "boy king" destroyed one of your azerite "superweapons". On his own. With nothing but the sword he "can barely hold up".
---
What does this say about your Horde's capabilities, that they design "superweapons" that can be taken down by one guy who, according to you, isn't even skilled in combat?
---
So, if he represents what the Alliance has become...Far more powerful than the Horde could ever hope? Able to absent-mindedly destroy your greatest creations?
---
You've lost your way. Following a tyrant, just because...well, why exactly? Because she said some words and your peonheart bounced with joy upon hearing your dead-elf waifu lie to you again?
---
its crazy how much empathy you can feel for a robot, just because it looks VAGUELY human
---
ED was magic. Shoutout to Renascor.
---
Yeah this is not a pug strat.  You need a specific group comp to AoE farm effectively
---
Literally never heard of Crossfire, but I've heard of DFO, isn't that a 2D sidescroller instanced fighter game?
---
Pretty shitty of OP to screen record his YouTube video and upload it to Reddit. Could've simply posted the YouTube video and gave him direct credit and the views he deserves.
---
I think the reason is that it would be confusing. Hey, Boulderfist is offline. You have to ask which one if there’s two boulderfists.
---
Try not to play with people you won't be happy for winning the roll. If you can get a core group than even if you lose, it was never a waste.
---
came here to type this lol.. im not married but god damn would it be a dream to play WoW classic with wifey.. it'd be like going on an adventure with your wife.. i'd be lucky if my wife even played ANY games (in my culture, girls RARELY play games, so stupid)
---
That would certainly be fast, but I have my doubt they can retain that on live. They've spent a long time maxing out gear at level 30
---
Yes. That was my point. I dont understand why you are posting here now.
---
No you ripped the video and posted it directly to Reddit. I don't see you linking the YouTube video anywhere in these comments yet and even then, just post the video instead of ripping it man.
---
except they leave in all the exploits....
---
Your post history is pretty interesting. Do you wake up in the morning and think, "I can't wait to jump on Reddit and collect downvotes!" or something?
---
And when we work together, the leader says "For Azeroth" even though Azeroth is actually a human kingdom. "For x" or "For the y" is literally the extent of Blizzards writing compentency, it has nothing to do with horde v alliance. Also Thralls Horde is younger than the alliance so it would be the horde having copied the alliance.
---
I just read your comment above, and it's funny because In Silico immediately brings me back to questing in Netherstorm specifically. I can hear any song on that album and start seeing that low light purple landscape feeling like I'm so close to 70 lol
---
Does minor speed stack with aspect of the cheetah?
---
Www.sixtyupgrades.com

1. Make an account and character (holy paladin).

2. Choose your level

3. ???

4. Profit.

SM Cath is healer loot heaven.
---
There wasn't a single server where the gates opened and AQ40 was cleared on the same day. It was 3 months between AQ gates opening and the first C'Thun kill.
---
I mean sure but if your dungeon spamming up to 30 your gonna be pretty decked out in gear....
---
Will you fucking stop making useless petitions already ? This is so pathetic...
---
TBH, I wouldn't mind this. More [PVE] RP'ers on the realm could control the non RP'ers that RP-PVP servers attract by simply RP'ing more; being the majority population. I don't think as many events would be crashed as anticipated. I like this idea more than no RP-PVP :/
---
Go browse your trap subreddits my friend. Have fun.
---
oh damn thats actually terrifying 😆
---
Haha that’s cool that’s it’s so specific. I knew I wasn’t the only one that had these weird nostalgic moments with music and wow zones 😅
---
I literally just did the pen and paper math and came back to reply and saw you already had. Came to nearly the same conclusion, I just couldn't find the specific mob xp for that dungeon.
---
I recognized your name immediately, I plan on using your 1-10 with my group by the way, I'm a big fan of yours.
---
Come on, let them have this. The Horde's creative abilities are...well, just look at their architecture. They don't even know what 'art' or 'aesthetics' even means, and I doubt orcs, tauren and trolls can read at all. "Furr de Hurr" is the best they can do. Don't take this from them. You know what happens when Orcs get angry, and honestly, those internment camps were pretty damn expensive to maintain.
---
&gt;You're salty because I called gnome players idiots
---
Bahhaha imagine commenting a blanket generalization then replying to anyone who responds with "you're salty"
---
So, by that logic, all orc players like dildos up their asses. If you reply you're salty! Oh I win by default
---
Like the amount of self delusion required here is astounding
---
You really somehow believe you are the center of this bahaha I'm sorry if I am the first to inform you: **the world doesn't revolve around HorriblePerson6** 
---
*Pikachu face*
---
 Yes! If you can believe it ( although I doubt you can because then you wouldn't be making yourself look like a complete asshat) very few people you talk to on Reddit *actually* care about you, your thoughts, your opinions etc. 
---
I know, tough pill to swallow for you, but it's ok. I'm here for you bby.
---
 One day, I hope, you wake up and realize that your immediate response, or as you would put it:  "salt",  to my first comment clearly showed you took it personally likely because it rang true to some effect
---
If it wasn't clear in your original comment, it's clear by now, the only one who is actually angry here is **you**
---
I would be too if I was making fun of a clearly superior race OMEGALUL @orcs bahahha
---
I mean if you wanna get technical with it yeah
---
PvP flags being always on is more "real" and thus more RP friendly to some. It's not "realistic" that someone of the opposite faction can't attack me or vice versa just because of game mechanics.
---
Also, most RP servers don't have any RP going on outside of guild events that are pre-organized or a couple friends sitting at a bar trading whispers and emotes regarding their personal story. 
---
Having players that don't want to RP, but are respectful of it is perfectly fine. Many people just prefer an RP server because there are less XxEdgelordxX names running around and generally people are a bit more respectful of eachother.
---
I only know them by name because they're the highest grossing video games of all time with the largest concurrent players. korean games both, I think
---
I'm gonna be making one of each of these classes as well, probably will start with warrior. 
---
Warrior isn't for everyone though. If you want to play a warrior, you have to really want to play it for what it is otherwise you'll burn out quickly as the leveling is brutal. Endgame is great but you won't reach there if you don't generally enjoy it.
---
I actually enjoy the struggle of leveling a warrior, it plays into the fantasy that anyone can be a warrior but to be strong you have to train hard. I also like how they're non 'magical' and achieve things by skill of the blade and brute force. They are extremely gear dependant so being confident and knowledgable enough to do dungeons at a couple levels lower than other party members really pays off as you need good gear as soon as you can get them. They don't always have to be the leader of the group but generally you have to be able to lead and make decisions as you're the frontline in dungeons.
---
Spellcasters are awesome and I can't wait to make a warlock at some point, but there's nothing like the sound effect of your character shouting an aggressive noise as you crit and the noise of your enemy crying out in pain as you chunk their health.
---
&gt;salty
---
&gt;You're salty
---
&gt;Let's see how much salt you have left
---
Lmao 3 salts in one comment.. holy cow
---
Nothing they could do could be anywhere near as bad as the pirated realms with all the exploits.  DW tanking bullshit.
---
yeah, whats funny about that too is blizzard viewed SWG as their main competitor during development. they were worried theyd get crushed by SWG...
---
I just like 90degree angles
---
&lt;3
---
No, it was MoP. Imagine having so many corrupt leaders go mad you can't even recall which expansion had a facist muderous dictator and which expansions had you save the world.
---
I would take their rates with a hefty grain of salt. The spots and methods should be fine but quite a few are reliant on the AH which will shift the rate depending on server economy.
---
its only 200ms? wow, thats better than my entire run in vanilla
---
Fuck you Jonesy, tell your mom to top off the credit card she gave me so I can get some fuckin KFC. (Least I have chicken)
---
Isn't he a good guy?
---
Ok so Blackhand + Gul'dan was still an issue for the Horde back in the early days.
---
Umm...I lost you at the richest. Any rich ladies want to help my broke ass?
---
There's not really much +healing gear before level 50, only a few odd blues. So basically you'll just stack as much intellect as possible with random drops.
---
Ok sorry
---
Damn you’re right. In BC garrosh is just an emo boi though, and maybe putress was kind of a bad thing in WotLK. I try to pretend the game’s plot stops existing past that.
---
Can't you just RP on the other servers?
---
If there is no RP-PvP server, a PvP server will be chosen as the unofficial RP-PvP server. If that is your server, they will be all around you instead of on their own server. 
---
If you hate RP, you should be happy to have it farther away from you.
---
Incorrect. Confirmed on Beta / Stress. Humans start with SW, Gnorfs start with IF, etc.
---
Why the confusion? It's Gallow's End Tavern!
---
Not a bad place to make home. You're right between Undercity, Orgrimmar, STV, and Western Plaguelands.
---
Why do you have to make an account?
---
I agree it’s not close to the launch numbers, BUT it’s a pretty damn big sample size and with the law of large numbers I would bet that this number stays pretty true even with 1mill players.
---
I zipped all of my screenshots and fraps videos from beta, vanilla and tbc into one huge archive.  
---
Unfortunately I hade a defective ram and the entire archive got corrupted once I copied it to another drive. I lost everything. I am still salty about it.
---
Why 20%? Did they announce FR and DE servers?
---
It's a MASSIVE time sink unfortunately! Not to mention resist gear is really important as a tank.
---
Druid/Shaman.
---
&gt; Warriors are ok in PvE (prot mainly), Warlock are better
---
You wut mate?
---
I hope it happens. Do you know any Classic dev Twitter handles so we can spread the word?
---
True true. I think locks are the better pick, so if you’re coming out thinking I’m saying they’re not then I think I did a good job of sounding unbiased haha
---
Someone didn't put their brain in their head when they left their house today.
---
Maybe, but you won't have time for enchants/consumables and probably miss out sector of gear still from rng.
---
And there are a level gaps between dungeons so there'd be period of lull farming barely green mobs. Like still doing WC at 23 and sfk up to 30, SM armory till 44 etc
---
A couple strong pieces of fury gear are craftables, so you and her can farm the mats easily. Then some pieces are mail drops, and you can pick and choose your group to prevent competition.
---
I’m doing exactly what I did the first time around. Roll priest, farm MC with a guild until I get benediction/anathema... then tell them I’m going shadow and if they don’t like it, peace. Then go be a PvP god until I find someone who wants to bring a geared shadow priest to raids, and put some sex on the damage meters with mind flay. Alpha shit.
---
They announced there would be NO FR or DE servers and DE is 20% of the active EU playerbase and 30% of the EU characters ever created.
---
&gt; Tanking too actually has plenty of challenge.
---
Shield block on cooldown!
---
&gt;But considering classic will be heavily streamed, blogged and reported on for months after its release
---
Then what's the point of *not* saying what changes they made lol. Sounds like that makes your second scenario happen no matter what.
---
Lol. Alright then.
---
Well you should prepare by breaking up with your girlfriend/divorcing your wife, work a part time job or quit all together. Gain about 15 lbs so your pants no longer fit so you can play pant less and be prepared to be eating pizza and hot pockets all day
---
2H weapons generally go to hunters as stat-sticks
---
I mean lets say it's 4% of 1 million players after the population drops in a couple months, that's still 40,000 players we're talking about. That's more than enough for one server.
---
Thanks for that catch! I have updated the link to correctly open the Orcish War Sword in the DB. I agree that the Alliance have no need for level 30 vendor weapons in this list like the Bullova. The Glacial Stone is not available to the Horde, which is why their leveling lists include the Bullova. There are also other level 30ish vendor weapons available, but I personally favor the damage range and speed of the Bullova.
---
Fuck you Jonesy! Your mum liked one of my Instagram posts from 7 years ago, tell her I’ll wear the short shorts for her any time!
---
&gt; Blizz never lost subscribers during WotLK
---
That' because you're making a really bad assumption in that everyone who starts playing WoW never quit. During WotLK when the playerbase was juuuust barely increasing, we had as many players quitting as we had players joining. WotLK was the first expansion where the number of new players didn't eclipse the quitters totally, thus is either had less draw on new players or it had more incentive for old players to quit. 
---
I'm making the comparison between older expansion because that's literally what was done in the parent comment. If you don't think they should be compared with earlier expansions, why did you write "My argument has been that we could/should look at the old numbers when WoW had most active players"?
---
Man all these people with "Me and my wife planning on playing"... you lucky bastards lol
---
&gt; So thanks again - I've really enjoyed this discussion! Very refreshing  to be able to take a deep dive, even if we mostly agree, I think I've  learned quite a bit here! 
---
\+1 We could argue the details to death but it's obvious we agree largely that the situation was "fucky" (to use an academic word) from the start because we can both model in our minds a better starting point for that relationship. Absent from that story is the 2 lovers seeming to care about that healthy starting point, [Match.com](https://Match.com) is a far better place to go and give yourself some credit, that is a website where people's expectations are more in-line with reality and whatnot.
---
I do have a snipe to ask a philosophical question about :D.
---
&gt; However, I am not going to take food or water away from others simply  for my own pleasure, or stockpile resources to control them. This would  also be narcissistic, but in doing so, I am hurting someone else  unnecessarily, and this is wrong. 
---
Do you believe in a "duty to help"?
---
So the question loosely worded is, you are walking down the street and see a person drowning, you can expend close to zero (or even zero) time/energy/resources saving that person from certain death. Do you feel you have a duty to save them, or else be guilty of their death?
---
I think believing in "the duty to help" poses a contradiction, although it's kind of assumed in an unspoken social contract that we all would help each other.
---
Thanks for all the information I have some new interests to read up on, narcissism can be an "alpha" or "beta" tactic it seems like.
---
Why? Roleplaying is weird, just makes people uncomfortable.
---
Who needs to position amirite?
---
So you don't know how the CD will actually work but you already know that you can abuse it... interesting.  
---
What about if the CD is increasing for every layer switch you are doing so after two switches you have to wait for 15 min?  
---
You will not party up with friends every 2 min while questing.   
---
Maybe you should stop throwing around wild theories when there is not even an official explanation from Blizzards side.
---
Also Raid Times. With IRL stuff I cant exactly raid in the middle of the night the entire night long and then also get up early. I personally dont mind ping but it will suck trying to find a guild with raid times that will work. 
---
My hope was to go into Classic "blind" and just find a guild naturally like I always have, but it's starting to seem more and more like I need to play literally everything out beforehand to even have a decent experience. :/
---
The real vanilla experience is 3k ping, id be fine with 200
---
Yeah I've been sticking to a North American PVE server for that reason. Sure only a couple hundred people are on at a given time since the vanilla pserver scene revolves around like one project because of it's legacy, but it beats fighting over quest mobs and being constantly ganked by that zones twinks
---
5 servers for NA with what 10k people per server? You think only 50k people in NA will play this game ???
---
What was the amount of priests on horde during Vanilla? I want to say it was a VERY low amount due to most players wanting to pew pew dps.
---
Me too bro.
---
My guild imploded due to people being unwilling to gear for Uldir even though all our officers were on pretty much constantly helping people. I quit out of frustration.
---
Can't wait to get back to it.
---
If you succeed, please do post a stick or a psa sometime near the launch.
---
Best of luck.
---
Just assumed you had to. Maybe you don't
---
Shaman has big time mana issues, but the play style is more fun to me. Mage is more reliable, but less cool-feeling to me personally. Sham can also heal really well and DPS just fine in anything but a raid. Mage is just a DPS cannon. Both are great at pvp, with mage probably being slightly better
---
Yeah, Thems the goals but do you know off the top of your head any of those blues? 
---
I feel like any bit of mp5 and +healing is worth getting, for a far better return on the mana cost/heal ratio.
---
I feel the same way. I've been at the point lately when I play game, all I want to do is just stop so I can read up on classic, the mechanics for classes ive never even been interested in playing along with the class i plan to main.
---
I just can suck up enough info. I don't play many games anymore but I know when classic hits its gonna suck up all my free time, it'll be like being a kid again
---
Im saving the website to my computer no sense in risking or being part of the cause for his website going down.
---
Guess I just won this game then.
---
Nah the content is easy. Its vanilla lol
---
Do you have a source or evidence for this?
---
I think you mean advantage
---
I saw a funny wow classic video in a different subreddit, so I cross posted here, period. It’s not my job to do a fucking investigation into its source to appease neckbeards like you.
---
The best is drinking a noggenfogger and getting a super tiny gnome.
---
cassandra's grace
---
It can work just fine without layering.
---
For reference look at private servers, many which run with 10-14k players on a single server pretty easy.
---
The deflector has a special place in my heart...so that one.
---
Good points!
---
As many other people will tell you, unless you are really willing to play purely from the fun you g
---
Yeah I’m looking for some plus healing to make my spamming of flash of light even better, plus mp5. At 22 I can spam flash of light for over a minute but can only cast like 4-5 holy lights lol
---
Gnomes have escape artist which is fun to get out of traps and such.
---
Watch "make love not warcraft" it will teach you what you need to know
---
&gt; STVietnam, the main reason to play on a PvE server.
---
Well sure, for me perhaps. And you it sounds like.
---
But I have watched streams of people leveling on Private Servers through STV. They actually *LIKE THE DEATH* as much as we DISLIKE it.
---
You should check out a stream a few weeks after launch and watch. I wont play on a PvP server, but I will absolutely watch a stream while I level in peace and laugh at the absolute carnage.
---
Thanks, I’ll check it out!
---
Anything with a good set of int and spi.
---
I think most of us went that route.   I started in March or April , and was pretty addicted from the beginning (played most days after work)  and it took me 3 months to reach lvl 60.   I still was the 3rd or 4th warlock at 60 on the whole SERVER  (Horde)  , although I started 1 month late, the server launched in february)    that's how slow everybody was.  I got immediately recruited by what would end up as the leading horde raiding guild, because they were in MC and desperately needed warlocks for Garr.  I would always be a casual-serious raider, but  I am glad I stumbled upon raiding that way.  The next 2 years would become the best gaming experience of my life.  We had a brilliant time, fighting with 1-2 alliance guilds for every first boss kill and the aq40 quest.  We lost most by a few days or a week or so, but we did rang the gong eventually and that was a sweet victory.  In TBC the guild fell apart because the transition from 40 to 25 and 10  was causing too much trouble.
---
That fucking shield in ZG. We had ZG on farm and that fucking thing never dropped!
---
The Immovable Object is great once AV drops, but won’t be until like phase 3.
---
Pretty sure he's fucking with you
---
Dm, stockades, sm, rfd/uldaman, Mara, zg, st, brd for alliance.  Horde wc, sfk, rfk, sm, and then the same.  You can keep mobs yellow the whole way
---
Bugs? Eh yes? They're fixxing them quickly. 1/10 troll, go away
---
Hijacking this.
---
I'm going to be playing a paladin and my buddy is going to play either a rogue, or a mage. Which do you think would be better for him with my paladin teaming up with him?
---
Druids are widely considered one of the weakest classes. Kevin Jordan even talks about how being "jack of all trades" doesn't really work.
---
I played a druid to R11 and R12 on two different PS. It's playable sure. But the class has problems. A lot of problems. 
---
Look at raids comps for serious guilds. They barely take any druids for a reason. In PvP premades avoid them except for wsg weekend.
---
Agree with this. Just pay the 1g at a high level and respec. Ideally keep some gear in your bank for that day. Enhance with melee buddies sounds more fun anyways! You can just drop a couple totems and go to town.
---
No, that's concurrent players. I think Blizzard will release WoW Classic with 2 PVP, 2 PVE, and 1 RP servers for EU and 1 PVP, 1 PVE, and 1 RP servers for both US coasts at launch. With Layering, that will be sufficient. If the numbers don't have enough drop off by Phase 2 to remove Layering without massive queues, they'll launch a couple more servers and offer transfers.
---
Dynamic respawns in the first few zones for the initial zerg and turn off layering.
---
Ideally you're in a guild that provides some support to critical raid members like main tanks., But not every pull or fight is a full-consume fight. Yeah, it may seem daunting, but you won't (or shouldn't) have to spend every moment farming. Some people will and it's a way to stand out above another, but raiding is a community activity and requires players to help each other.
---
Holy shit dude, you have issues. Projecting all your problems onto me doesn't make you right, it just makes you look desperate and disturbed.
---
I recommend you go outside for a while and seek out a mental health professional in the future. Hopefully you'll be able to figure out your problems and become a mentally healthy person. I won't be replying to any of your future messages so don't bother to respond to me. I wish you the best of luck.
---
Aw, I don't think I'll be cut out for it then. I'll switch over to healing then. Thanks!
---
Christ man just admit you were wrong and leave. This is pathetic.
---
Boars to level 60 it is!
---
that’s not what i requested was it?
---
That is when you pack up your thing and move to another area return to it when you get a lead
---
60 servers? with 100 ppl each maybe, in the history of WoW there have only ever been 2 german servers with more than 1k online lolz.
---
Making a german server is not worth it and they'd have to merge it into another server soon after launch because german kids just don't keep playing hard games.
---
Just a heads up, all of you rolling Orcs isn't necessary to level together since all the starting zones are a short travel from one to the other (some longer than others but all are manageable)
---
Priest would be awesome too!
---
[https://youtu.be/GZNKugMdPFI?t=25](https://youtu.be/GZNKugMdPFI?t=25) ? They don't open gates in the video
---
the request was for a video of the gates and them clearing AQ40, when did I ever say it was all in the same motion?! lmao
---
Definitely looks legit, but once he pulled out the gun and shot it in the face it's pretty apparent lol.
---
Sheesh, to be a fly on a wall
---
It seems they are dead set against keeping it for long, they want it for the initial but want it gone before phase 2 hits. It is not a classic mechanic, so they don't want to keep it in, it's a temporary measure because of the start of classic wow, there's going to be a giant surge of people that is going to cause problems.
---
I’m not the one who posted it!!! Read the source you dumb shit!
---
I played frost mage and subtlety rogue.  I am a casual player.  For the most part, frost mage was easier, especially in PVE. You keep distance, hit them with skills that slow or freeze them in place and can blink when they get close.  Mage is way better for lots of mobs.  Regular PVE is a breeze. However, for elites, maybe I could take one down one on one.  Real struggle with single target elites. PVP was also a struggle for me.  I tried to hide and do as much damage as I can before inevitably being taken out.  You are a glass cannon.  However, overall I felt more useful in PVP and dungeons as I could damage multiple targets.  
---
Rogues are great when in stealth or coming out of stealth, but damage output drops precipitously.  I only made it to level 60 so far with Rogue.  Single target DPS is great. Can take an elite target down.  Great survive ability.  When things get crazy just vanish.  Pretty good for PVP, it is a ton of fun sneaking up on people.  I was also in a PVP server, so I spent most of my time stealthed.  This saved me so many times as I would see some overpowered Horde come in an kill everyone but me.  However, I didn’t feel like I did as much damage in dungeons and I wasn’t any good with more than 2 opponents.  Outside of stealth for too long and you are a liability.  Interestingly, I got the Goblin Jumper Cables.  Nothing cooler than surviving a wipe (which you can survive a lot) and trying to Rez the healer.  I did better in PVP with a Rogue, but as I am a casual player, I was never great in PVP anyway!
---
Mage was definitely easier.  But I really enjoy playing both.  If you are a PVP server, Rogues survive ability is great.  They both are really fun classes with totally different play styles.
---
I saw esfand pull this off to bait a counterspell
---
Possible, but you often get mocked for roleplaying on no-rp servers. It also takes away from the whole experience when you're roleplaying and no one else is.
---
I will join an Amsterdam realm, but I get about 58ms to New York from Amsterdam. (101ms is the highest I have seen to cheap networks with poor routing). Most other US locations ping at 100ms+ for me though.
---
IMO you should not be seeing 200 ping to NY from anywhere in the EU. Where are you located?
---
I don’t think that’s the one.
---
that's not DKP. he's using a point system to grade many many different factors other than 'you showed up to raid' to determine who is deserving of an actual piece of loot. spreadsheets that house all of these different variables (ie, past loot, attendance, effort, enchants, attunements) are all great ways to determine if any particular person should be eligible / up for discussion when loot council votes are going on. this is why LC has the upper hand on DKP in most situations. that is, implying no bias and no corrupt members on the LC
---
That's why they should have their own server. Let people enjoy what they enjoy.
---
Well, this is obviously my biased opinion :
---
Leveling wise priest is more fun, shammy is only fun 20% of the time if you get what I mean.
---
Mana issues on shammy gave me head aches throughout every aspect of the game, priest has mana issues but they're more manageable somehow.
---
Chain farming mobs solo is much faster on priest due to having almost no downtime, on shammy I find myself taking mana breaks every few mobs.
---
Healing wise priest is much more versatile and does more hps , as shammy in raids you'll be spamming chain heal most of the time with some down ranked HT every once in a while and having to refresh totems every 2 mins is the most annoying thing ever , melee players srsly tilt if you refresh their beloved WF totem a split second too late.
---
Dps wise you have more chances of raiding as shadow than any of the shammy dps specs.
---
Gearing wise at launch people will appreciate priests a lot in dungeons as you need the healing power, not to mention you can gear much faster than shammies , you only wear cloth too so you don't have to look like a clown.
---
I could go on but I think thats enough :p
---
Damn. That’s the stuff I’m talking bout! Ty!
---
Live to Win!
---
Well for priest as horde, you can only choose between Troll and Undead. For roleplay purposes it's probably gotta be Undead. If she wants to be a shadow priest Undead works really well for that aesthestic too. I believe the Undead are actually the pioneers of "shadow priests" in the wow universe, but i could be entirely wrong. The priest gear is pretty high-fantasy and looks great. You could view the models on Wowhead. I haven't talked much about hunters because i don't feel they are really a roleplay class. But you could definitely make it work.
---
Mecha cat form, and Mecha Boomkin.
---
When I think of horde character models and I don't really see any of them being appealing for a female, but if I had to pick one I'd probably say female troll priest? 
---
What are you playing as?
---
Yes they are, and warlocks are great at throwing dots on every target and spamming fear
---
Troll priest, the benediction quest line is amazing if you two will be raiding a little.
---
WoW isn’t really a roleplaying game. It’s like saying Overwatch should have raids. Just doesn’t make sense.
---
Oh shit... Someone knows I'm gay... Whatever will I do. 
---
It does make me laugh that you went through my profile in a desperate attempt to insult me and still failed. Pathetic.
---
Thats just insane. When we we're done back in the day we had 6 guilds capable of finishing the questlines and yet only one person with the mount.  
---
30 people managing to farm the fragments needed before the gates open is crazy
---
Hunter. Hunters tame many pets, have to feed them, level them, gain loyalty with them. Have to actually buy arrows, quivers, aspects and tracking. Soooo many role playing aspects associated with the class.    Aesthetic wise, Orc Females pull off most leather / mail gear with glorious bad assery. Troll females are more dainty if that's her thing. Tauren chicks ugly af in my opinion but she might think they're cute.
---
Opened it at 1498. After signing it was at 1501. We did it!
---
10/10 imo, look at all the responses

*waves torch frantically*
---
Back, get back I say.
---
Back into the cave from whence you came.
---
You prepare by downloading the client when available probably around the middle of August.  Then you log on when it launches, log in, and play the game.
---
Lol 
---
&gt;Projecting
---
Do you have ANYTHING to say besides calling gnomes idiots, calling me salty, and saying the word "projecting" 
---
Lmao it's like you just learned what it meant and you wanna show off that it's now in your vocabulary
---
I'm sorry but the clear-cut sign of 
---
Is bringing up the same things over and over again, idk like "salty" and idk "projecting" 
---
have you noticed me stumbling over and repeating myself ? Hmm , that's strange it seems to just be you. Weird. 
---
Must still be me projecting lmao
---
Thank you for wishing me the best of luck, although you will be the one who needs luck to get away from me bahahaha see u in azeroth snowflake
---
Could even do the starting zones solo n group up at barrens
---
I don't multibox, but I also don't care if people do.  If you want to put in the effort to make it work, more power to you.
---
You're just salty for no real reason.
---
If those Spanish speaking gamers, had Spanish servers in 2005 and currently in retail. You think they wouldn't fight for them in 2019, because that is their original authentic classic experience? 
---
Oh sweet summer child. Of course you don't see an issue, because your original experience is different.
---
Do International servers work? Of course they do. No one is asking to get rid of them.
---
Maybe not necessary but Orc isn't a bad choice for any class really.  Troll Shaman would get you the haste option for your spell unloads, but some people aren't a big fan of the Troll aesthetic (myself included).
---
Can only find a short part of the ninjack sucka tune on YouTube. Seems to have disappeared.
---
Maybe someone out there still has it?!
---
LMAO. I stopped at the brooms. So glad your comment made me go back.
---
1500 only fills half of one server. If demand for an RPPvP server is that low, chances are you aren't going to get one.
---
Classic's launch will be much, much bigger than BfA.  Mark my words on this.
---
Well yeah there's stuff like the Acid walkers ( [https://classicdb.ch/?item=9454](https://classicdb.ch/?item=9454) ) from gnomer and the craftable Dreamweave set ( [https://classicdb.ch/?item=10021](https://classicdb.ch/?item=10021) ) if it's vanilla and not tbc. But i dont think it makes that much of a difference at low levels to be worth spending extra effort trying to get specific items. After 45-50 might be another story.
---
perfectly acceptable to me!
---
Of healing starts to become useful at level 40 or so gear..even the greens are awesome.
---
It's not that hard to troll fanboys :P You shouldn't take too much credit.
---
😍 lol they could have little moonkin hatchling form too. It would be adorable for sure!
---
Nice try 4th account. Oh wait still the same account.
---
Haha. I was there and I'm explaining you how it's handled among those top guilds. It's not the clusterfuck you might think. 
---
But sure, what makes you feel like winning an argument, right? ;-) [Here is another example with comms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6zrQJquPbI).
---
Putress: Carpet bombed both horde and alliance forces with the preferred weapon of the scourge
---
members of the horde:  maybe putress was kind of a bad
---
I actually laughed until my abs hurt.
---
Massive multiplayer online role-playing game. That's all I'll say.
---
I think with the warrior/rogue and shaman make up it won’t be that bad. Drop totems &amp; drink. Let the two melee fools kill the mobs, heal them and move on.
---
Prot paladins are the best dungeon tanks in vanilla. They have great snap agro and have AOE damage. Warriors and Druids have no AOE. And rely on rage so initial snap is much slower.
---
True, but it's still funny though
---
Insult? I called you my friend and said have fun.
---
Features, not bugs
---
LOL nice
---
Although that's true, it's much more likely that you will find support too and fight back when factions are balanced.
---
How else are we going to have a fun southshore vs tarren mill other wise ? \^\^
---
Lol. 4 accounts? Wooa thats too much work.
---
Nelf tranny heaven
---
Do you heard about pen and paper RPG? or tabletop RPG? Adults play it too and they are better at it. Don't hate what you don't understand.
---
What is point in calling names because you don't like something?
---
Played on a number of very popular private servers, including one where it was roughly 14k on launch. With dynamic respawns, everyone was able to progress through decently. There were some pain points where there were waits for respawns, still less abusable than layering EVEN WITH A COOLDOWN.
---
What's the exact time.
---
OP you’re 5 minutes into your own thread and already being an asshole.
---
*cowers in fear before quickly scurrying back into the cave*
---
Muh bis don't even think about joining my raid unless you're rank 14 all flasks no scrubs 6k+ GS only
---
My first alt was chilling in the Thrallmar Inn at level 61 until just a few weeks ago!
---
"NO CHANGES! btw guys what are the best add-ons to improve my experience and make things easier?" 
---
Never understood these people.
---
Be nice you guys! Don't fight :[
---
There's almost no Mp5 gear below level 45. [The only stuff is PvP rewards and one drop from gnomer](https://classicdb.ch/?items&amp;filter=minrl=1;maxrl=45;MOD_D=5:1:20;). That stuff doesn't show up until the occasional quest reward/dungeon loot around level 50+.
---
For +Healing, [you've got more options](https://classicdb.ch/?items&amp;filter=MOD_D=7:1:99;#0+2+1), but you're gonna have to wear cloth. Again, not a ton until 50.
---
Yeah, bro. The thing is: everything you’ve said doesn’t matter. Layering is a very temporary solution that has 0 impact on completely new players and any committed player will see themselves through it, knowing the alternative is 6 hour ques.
---
its mostly a population thing so varies by server, but in general horde players tend to gank more. Its because alot of pvp oriented players pick horde because of the good racials, and the aesthetic attracts alot of that type.
---
Though, don't let this make you think the horde is better than the alliance in PvP in general. Horde in general only has the advantage in disorganized PvP - their racials give them an edge there. But in organized PvP, like premade battlegrounds or wpvp raids, alliance has a big advantage because of paladins. 
---
This actually applies across the board. Horde tend to function better in disorganized content, while alliance is better at organized content, all because of racials and paladins respectively. There are always outliers, but that's the general rule.
---
Thinking about saying “nice try 5th account”
---
And it will be glorious.
---
You know, this explains a lot.

You just play when it comes out. You don’t need to prepare or plan. Stop listening to anyone trying to turn gameplay into a job where You have to be efficient and plan out every step of the way.
---
If you're leveling a "bank alt" to get Moonkin form you're just leveling an alt at that point.
---
Where has blizzard said how many concurrent players will be supported on a server?
---
Layering should in theory mean no queues.   But can't know about the stability obvioualy
---
Why are warlocks so desireable for ally raids? What's the diffrence between Horde?
---
So rude
---
But how can you run from a Druid?
---
Because the small minority of people who want it are doing A LOT of talking

Undead shadow priest is one of the most flavorful class/racer/spec combos in the game.
---
Wow! Amazing. I'm stealing this for my desktop!
---
Can't switch to a better provider? 80 is not a good low :l
---
I suppose you could enter some of those dungeons earlier and just farm the first half, but trying to get to second half on later levels just means you would have to kill a lot of green packs.
---
Range on level is pretty large on many of those dungeons, just no way around it.
---
This is dope. Excellent work.

ok bud

I personally never played Vanilla WoW. I grew up pretty poor and there was no way I could go to my mom and tell her to pay for a video game with a monthly price, something that would have confused her as much as garnered hysterical laughing from her.
---
Didn't play official WoW until Cataclysm when I got my first part-time job in high school. Up until then, I played in private servers. I don't have a ton of love for Vanilla or nostalgia to it. However, having read so many player's experiences on this sub has really hyped my interest. Now in my late 20's with job and responsibilities, it's tough finding time to invest into WoW, but I still play super casually.
---
I'm really excited to see the game in a more paced manner as opposed to the quick fix live WoW currently is (not bashing, I love the game either way).
---
To the point I'm even considering some RP, something I've never had interest in. I look forward to seeing the game I love from the beginning that I missed out on. I hope to make new acquaintances and memories with some of you folks!
---
For me it's not that I don't mind the PvP but it never happens on fair terms. It's always attacking you while you're surrounded by mobs or it's two vs one or it's a random level 60 just trolling Redridge. 
---
Don't get me wrong I'll still level on PVP but it really makes me wonder why I do it.
---
Yeah nah
---
r/rimjob_steve
---
You have an awesome garbage disposal man. I accidentally turn my on with a plastic spoon in there and boom, lots of bad noises, whole thing starts on fire, it's a whole ordeal. How does something that is literally full of water catch on fire? Makes no sense.
---
Some people think only in extremes.  Either you are "taking your time" and reading every single quest and flavor text in the game while RP walking around your faction city talking to NPCs that don't talk back or you're hardcore rushing to 60 and playing 22 hours a day with an IV drip for nutrients and skipping all content while grinding in a corner of the zone until your eyes bleed.
---
That's a horrible way of thinking and it's infested everything including politics.  If you are conservative you're nazi scum that hates everyone other than white males and if you're liberal you're literally a socialist SJW who hates white males.
---
There's no reason a person can't do a little bit of both.  The extremist attitude prevents the free exchange of ideas and logical discussion by framing every issue as "me vs you".
---
I'm going to "rush" to 60 by focusing on solo questing while mixing in a few dungeons that I can get all the quests for.  I'll level some professions along the way for gold for my level 40 mount.  I plan on being 30 in the first week and 60 within two months.
---
Well, I wrote [this topic on](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c3b97c/with_10_buttons_or_less_your_macros_can_access/) how to write and use macros. I'm not in the beta, but these work in the modern client (which is what the beta uses). Wowpedia's list of macros commands and conditions is what I use.
---
If you both login to the account within a short duration of each other from separate ips you will be banned I lost an account to that in vanilla and their automated detection works. It was like somewhere around 10-16 hours of waiting if I remembered correctly could have changed by now or I could be wrong 24 hours would probably be safe from automated systems.
---
I’d love to see a neutral city - but not like Dalaran.
---
It’d be a goblin area - an ancient sand city - with old ruins - as large as ironforge.
---
But between the hours of 12pm and 5pm it should turn into a war zone. 
---
Alliance and horde both ride in to pillage their loot - and one massive jackpot loot at the ancient keep. 
---
Somewhat like gurubashi - but you’d have to complete checkpoints before unlocking the final loot.
---
Such as sacking the guard towers, armoury, ancient underground vaults.
---
Each point should give rewards - gold, chance at loot, special potions.  
---
No layering dodging - should be layer specific. 
---
Ye final throne room should require a blood sacrifice (obviously a goblin prank) of 100 souls.
---
So you must kill 100 people, collectively with everyone. 
---
For the the throne vault to open. 
---
Vault opens and it becomes a perma-death room.
---
Meaning, if you die, you die.
---
You cannot resurrect until the loot is collected - or you get a debuff and can’t enter the city until the event is over.
---
It’d be pretty exciting to see that final battle - the tension would be high - and those who played during the entire event may have potions to aid them.
---
The difference is that RP actually happens on the pve servers
---
I agree, but business models... adapt. Excuse my slight sense of distrust haha
---
There will be millions of people playing this game at launch, even after the servers die down a bit. You're telling me ONE RP-PVP server on NA can't have a decent sized population? You're out of your mind if you think otherwise.
---
Same (but no baby, insert many cats instead). The spousal unit and I have decided to roll PVE and I think I got most of my family on board (because we're all adults with real life responsibilities and limited game time). Sometimes wpvp is super fun but other times it's just frustrating. :P
---
# How to reduce gear competition in your server 101:
---
Ah.
---
That's very unfortunate for horde. Glacial Stone feels borderline insane and doesn't get talked about enough IMO. 
---
I have also tried it on my Ret Paladin and can confirm it also can proc off of seal of command procs as well as judgments. It pros so often it makes my jaw drop sometimes.
---
I am convincing my wife right now. Maybe it will work, she played vanilla a little. She like casual games but hey, few hours with my wife in Azeroth now and again - priceless!
---
All those 14 y-o Forsaken Rogues are almost 30 with kids and mortgage now. They won't have the time to camp you in STV all day.
---
This helped so much.. thank you 🙏🏼
---
I might be slightly biased, but generally I feel like most groups are organized by either the healer or the tank, which in most cases are more than happy to fill up the group with leather users. Not to mention that rogues are among the top dpsers when your group isn't doing mana breaks between every pull.
---
I like what you wrote in the runes.
---
Time to dust off the old repost:
---
Yeah, 1.12 was great, but it was only great because of the buildup. The ZG release, the war effort, world bosses, etc. Silithus went from empty to jam packed overnight when the quest hubs were released. It built community and a "history".
---
Azshara is still an underdeveloped zone in 1.12. As seen from explorers, Vanilla has areas where vertical progression can continue. Hyjal, Uldum, etc. **There is unused map terrory south of Un'Goro/east of AQ.** Hell, patch 1.16 could add an underground instance that could be harder than vanilla Naxx literally anywhere just by putting a portal into a rarely explored hillside or underneath Stromgarde Keep or the Thandol Span in Arathi, and it wouldn't ruin the rest of the Vanilla world. **Deadwind Pass might be a good place for it too.**
---
There are a lot of gameplay options for the devs. The constraint will be the lore. How you continue to develop "the game" itself without retconning all the TBC-to-present lore?**
---
You could re-create the "War Effort" by requiring the server to complete objectives first before unlocking the content. Imagine some fucking EPIC questline to restore the Thandol Span or build a tunnel out of UnGoro. It could be badass.
---
Almost didn't catch the text.
---
Hype train!
---
Cool thank you. I’m going to be wearing cloth from deadmines on lol.
---
My girlfriend and I rolled troll and she quit because trolls dont wear shoes and girls like shoes.
---
str+stam, int+stam, agi+stam, and high primary stat greens and blues will sell. AH those and DE everything else. If items don't sell after 2 listings, just DE them and move on.
---
It depends on the mats required and skill. Also how famous the crafter is.
---
lmao... here have an upvote
---
Mages have always synergized best with priests. People seem to be forgetting that warriors don't really like priests in classic, because PW:S prevents rage generation and priests haven't got the kind of offensive support warriors really want.
---
Warlocks are a bit more iffy due to a lack of mobility, and rogues are alright but will get absolutely annihilated by a well geared warrior even with healing. 
---
Mage has less PvE utility than a warrior however, in the sense that it can't fulfill a tank role - but if you meant to play a tank, you should remember that it's extremely difficult in classic to play more than one spec. Both the gearing and the recurring costs for talent swaps are huge downsides. Warriors that tank are not going to get priority on loot items until everyone else has had a go, because they'll be granted first go on any kind of tanking upgrade - in which there tends to be a lot less competition.
---
Oh well if you say so I guess I'm off to play a mage /s
---
The hype for games always skyrockets during the last 2-3 weeks prior to launch.
---
In the case of Classic, there was always a massive amount of hype, but I can assure that shit will hit the fan during August.
---
Please do warlock!!
---
If they give me a price I'll pay it, otherwise I usually do about 10g-20g depends on what it is
---
if you think telling people that enhancement shamans are useless in a raid "looks stupid" then you dont know what you are talking about.
---
as for easy content...i guess you never cleared the later raids...lol
---
Do you have a guide/video for mara grinding?  I watched a DM one for locks the other day. Looks interesting.
---
Wpvp is great when you are in the mood, but when you just want to do a couple of quests or work on your professions and get killed repeatedly by someone 10+ levels higher than you it just kills your fun.
---
Natalie Seline (Human bishop refugee from Stormwind then living in Lordaeron) was the first recorded/notable Shadow Priest. She started her studies right after the First War and went insane thanks to her blade, Xal'atath. Her followers went too deep into the darkness, and after her death, her books were locked away in Dalaran. The Forsaken religion, Cult of Forgotten Shadow, was borne out of the undead finding copies of her books underneath the ruins of Lordaeron.
---
There are more gankers on horde but alliance gankers are straight cancer, specially nelf male hunters specced into BM that is as cancerous as it can get.  
---
I usually play alliance btw and I say that because the gankers on horde usually take one area of the zone and that's that, they do it and done, Alliance players are vicious, they don't only take one area they take one full zone and stay there for a straight day at least that is if they don't get mad at someone for a random reason and straight corpse camp that poor hordie.
---
wtf is that UI lol
---
Absolutely, I am just going by what they are saying, and if they want classic to succeed where BFA has failed, they NEED to keep with what the community has been saying. (And it seems they have the ear on the community's feedback at least)
---
And the people who want classic and are willing to pay for it for the long haul, do not want layering. As such, need to cater to them if they want to be profitable.
---
It could be that people on the beta are playing the opposite of the faction they are planning to pick at launch so as to avoid getting burnt out quickly.
---
We’ll definitely make it well known.
---
I’m a mage and was doing some pvp during the stress test. Let me just say until we get blink you guys destroy us haha
---
I've been messaging this girl for 2 months now, literally every single day and she still hasn't responded. Don't give up hope guys, everything happens for a reason!
---
I only tip for rare recipes, cooldowns, and if they use a reagent.  Otherwise, I won't tip.
---
What scepter is this?
---
What do you mean by 20%? German servers alone are 30% of all retail EU WoW servers.
---
Shaman please!😀
---
&gt; Andwynn saying “For the Alliance” in the BFA trailer was the ultimate cringe for me regarding my stance on this debate.
---
mmm I guess, but he was pretty badass when he revived like his whole army.... Reminded me of the lich king raising a bunch of undead. So I guess I never noticed nor cared that he "Mimicked" the horde.
---
Has anyone ever given you grief for not tipping?
---
Awesome, thanks for the correction, is that bit of lore from one of the books or something?
---
Yeah, and that's what it'll devolve into quickly, I think. I was ganked way more times on pvp realms than I had fair-ish fight skirmishes with same-ish level folks, and I don't need to deal with that noise. Like you said, when we all had more time to play it wasn't as big of a deal, but spending my allotted "fun time" on being dead/corpse-running just ain't gonna do it for me this go-around.
---
Fellow Ravenholdt player here. I loved that server.
---
I agree.  Hunters are shit.  Don't play them!!!
---
They haven't. We know tech limits of the time required no more than 3.5k, but there's no telling that Blizzard plans to re-implement that.
---
Lol all his posts were deleted. Maybe you are on to something.
---
I tip nicely for a combine, but I don't have a set amount or a spreadsheet going. It's often in-the-moment, but it is dependent on a few factors for me, which might bring a higher tip:
---
Is this something they trained at level 5, or is it a recipe drop that's hard to get (world drop, raid drop)?  Did they meet me in the middle to combine? Are they a guildmate? Have we done business before? Are they easy to do business with?
---
i cant wait to hit level 60 and kill everyone in lakeshire
---
Biases are fine! Thanks for your opinion
---
Kind of pointless.  No guild is going to take more than like 3.
---
&gt;you only care about the statistical variance of the gold per hour 
---
How do you plan on calculating that? Statistical variance is a more complicated concept than what OP is talking about.
---
&gt; In the second example you are just comparing the expected amount of gold per hour. Neither of those rely on the chance of getting 1 drop within x amount of kills. 
---
You're leaving out the time constraint. One item can have a higher gph but have a lower expected return in a given window of time or kills.
---
They're 20% of the active EU playerbase.
---
Female dance is better.
---
I’m looking at enh shaman
---
now I ship Mathias shaw  x blood elf rouge
---
can you tell her to not roll hunter? she would dislike it
---
how am i being an asshole?
---
What makes a crafter famous? Is it based on how many rare recipes they have or something?
---
You would first need language servers and then split them up into RP servers. We are not even getting language servers. This is a lost cause.
---
I wouldn't jump off the tank train quite yet. There is a huge difference between Main Tanking and Off Tanking. A MT requires hours of time investment and shoulders the burden of the entire raid. IF you want to tank, you don't have to be the raid MT - Plenty of raids need several tanks for offtanking as well. If you want to be a raid Offtank, your time investment won't be much higher than healers or DPS, and you'll be able to tank dungeons as well.
---
I had a prot/tank warrior for my "main" alt, and I love the class/tanking in vanilla, and even tanked as MT through BWL with our alt raids, but would Offtank when needed in AQ/Naxx.
---
Are you set on "if I tank, I want to be the main tank of a 40 man raid" Or, would a simpler "I want to tank in a raid, even as an offtank" be acceptable.
---
:thinking:
---
That's rough buddy. My spouse works long days too (12+ like you do) and finding time to game even casually is going to be hard.
---
Don't forget fire shield from the Imp!
---
One mage insisted that I pay gold for his water.  He wanted near vendor price.  So, I told him to make like 12 stacks, which took him a long time.  Then after he tied to trade, I told him that I didn't want it, and that he could now give it away for free.
---
He could’ve logged out right?
---
That's actually a really going point about it being PVP-RP instead of RP-PVP.  I used to play on an RP-PVP server a bit and that was actually exactly my experience.  I see now why those servers would fill an important space.
---
Yup they sropped that I wanna say in WOTLK
---
Crusader enchant on a grey dagger ? :)
---
Remember Robin Williams, who was a Warcraft fan :( 
---
He was a great actor, I thought he was only good at jokes until I saw Good Will Hunting.
---
It's not like people got *nothing*. They got the gates to unlock, which afforded them a new raid, new experiences, and new gear.
---
But yes. People really did farm resources and turn them in for quests instead of selling them at the AH. Some people sold them on the AH so others would turn them in.
---
The quests also gave a small amount of rep, which was helpful. Rep gains in Vanilla were not as fast as rep gains in current retail. It took a long time to get your reps up, especially with another race's faction.
---
As a mage, if youre not a guilds, you wont be getting that food and water
---
&gt;For instance, a mage food/water, won't tip.
---
Kind of dickish imo, considering simply how long it takes to make that shit.  This is the reason I charge for these things, rather than let people tip.  Though generally water/food is enough of a PITA that I'll flat out refuse to do it.
---
What could be better than one corgi?? TWO CORGIS!
---
There's tons on YT I can link you one in a bit
---
Exactly what happened.
---
I thought you can't log out in combat though!
---
It's bits and pieces all over the place, some in the game, some in print.
---
I usually do 1g for ports food and water. Everything else I usually do about 10‰ of what the mat cost is. Rare enchants are hard earned people deserve to be rewarded for that.
---
Gizlock's Hypertech Buckler (lv 48) is probably the best shield until Malistar's - while I know that there are stronger offhand held items, this is the best shield.
---
Most important thing is to make sure you pick the right class for you.  For example if you think druids are cool but expect to get invited to raids as dps, you are not going to have a good time.
---
There's a ton of guides on youtube. I've probably watched 30+ different guides in preparation for classic because I too didn't start really playing until 2007 in TBC. I would recommend Madseasonshow, Kargoz and Defcamp and Melderon for different classic guides.
---
O love my little goofballs, but they are an assload of work when you live alone.
---
I feel another good contribution we can all do is regularly tweet or write letters to blizzard - concisely saying why we want/need RP-PvP for WoW Classic.
---
Maybe other adorable hugging that will last until rp-pvp servers or starvation.
---
I started to solo the elite black dragonkin in Burning Steppes for the scale, the leather and the better loot while mining thorium. Everything was new so every single hunter was dragonscale LW at the time (in the end they realised it was useless), i made a fortune and got my unarmored mount the same week i dinged 60. I still have the "old school mount achievement" to prove it.
---
Haha probably! This time around I plan to pay for only the skills I know I'll use. Like I won't be buying any pet skills except for voidwalker while leveling. And I'll probably ignore the curses except Agony until 60.
---
I think the Warlock epic mount costs like 300 or 400 gold so I am praying that I can save that much at least!  I had to have a sugar daddy help me with a loan back then and I spent a long time paying him back!
---
Prepare mentally. Arm yourself with a lot of patience. Brain usage in Classic is fundamental.
---
Join groups, start groups.
---
Make friends. Join a guild.
---
HAVE FUN !
---
Huh. I roll human cause I'm a filthy casual who hates grinding rep so 10% less time spent on it is legit the best racial in the game. Diff'rent strokes huh
---
Basically just good server reputation. I'd gladly tip more just because they didn't steal my mats.
---
There are bound to be a few well-known crafters on every server.
---
I guess you can also become famous if you have rare recipes.
---
No, it’s a reminder that min-maxer’s priorities are different from your own (assuming you aren’t one). It’s easy to get lost in the super-endgame min-max mindset, only to forget there’s hundreds of hours of leveling (months for the average person) beforehand, AND, you have to have few responsibilities or no significant social life to raid consistently (ie, actually be a min-maxer).
---
I am not paying you a gold to push a button. You are already the best farmer in the game, and healers suck at farming. If I have to pay the hybrid tax, then your broken as fuck PURE ass can make healers water.
---
Dwarf shammy all day
---
What the hell. So now, us english speakers have to deal with people who can barely communicate with us in a game that relies almost solely on communication. Yeah, really looking forward to that.
---
That last part is what has me rethinking what I am planning on doing. I have always played on PVP servers and had a ton of fun doing pvp with fair terms, people within 4 or so levels of me where either one of us could win based on skill, crits, cooldowns, etc. On the flip side I remember all of the times where I would be trying to level up and some lvl 60 undead rogue would just follow me around killing me every time that I started questing again spamming /lol each time. In those cases I was just not having fun and getting frustrated with the game while I am sure the rogue was having the time of his life being a douche. I am just not sure if the pros outweigh the cons anymore. Since leveling is so slow in classic you really need to make the right choice at the start, you don't want to sink a month into a character just to decide that you have had enough and start all over on a new server, leaving any guild and friends you made along the way.
---
Wow, you're so cool.
---
"My hearth was pounding" lmao love that
---
I have 8 cats, so I feel ya. I have help (I do all the feeding/cleaning but it's good to have someone else around to give attention to them too) but there are days I feel like I'm going insane with so many pets. Did you adopt your pair together or separately? Do they have special beds set up by where you game so they can keep you company? :D
---
Did you ever put it to the test?
---
thx
---
Yeahhh, giving the mage something is always a good gesture. I've never had a mage demand vendor price for water.
---
Keep in mind, as a casual player, you won't have the gold to swap specs of hybrids - so you are still going to be locked into a "dps/Tank/Healer" role. 
---
A Shadow priest may be your best bet, you are primarily DPS and can do well in PVP, but you'll be able to heal in dungeons if needed.
---
https://www.windowscentral.com/how-upgrade-32-bit-64-bit-version-windows-10
---
Well I'm going Alliance.
---
Haha, truth.
---
So your only arguement is "lol your wrong"
---
I explained why all specs are viable for different reasons, just pick the one that suits you, if you want to raid DPS pick a raid DPS spec, if you want to PvP, pick a PvP spec, don't expect every spec to be viable in every situation and have a tool for everything. Vanilla is not BFA.
---
This is what makes classes and specs interesting and fun.
---
&gt;Unleashing this Seal's energy will judge an enemy for 10 sec, granting attacks and spells used against the judged enemy a chance to restore 33 mana to the attacker.
---
Unless SoR isn't an attack OR a spell... it's a bug.
---
The problem is you being an undead SP and being passive. I would've killed you because I assumed it was preemptive, just like when you play gnome you have to attack every horde because for some reason ganking a gnome is 20x more pleasurable.
---
Stress test, which is currently done.
---
Oh I wouldn't mind being an off-tank at all. I just always found tanking to be the most interesting role and have been doing it for well over 10 years, so it felt right to keep it going in Classic. Sadly, my farming time just isn't what it used to be.
---
Im surprised the quality is as good as it is, I remember it being much worse
---
You log out outside of combat and hope the 20 seconds go by before they can kill you
---
To be honest  if aesthetics are an issue, I'd suggest you roll alliance and she play a human or NE priest.
---
Wait... You're trolling, gotcha
---
Dang that whole time? The 50s are just so much exp I usually end up bouncing a lot of different zones during 50-60 cuz I can never get more than 1-2 levels out of a single zone.
---
Most recently I did 52-60 in Dire Maul, so things definitely could've changed in terms of routes , but I usually needed to do Felwood, Ungoro,  Winterspring, WPL, EPL, Silithus, and Blasted Lands (not all of the quests in each, eventually of the quests got too few and far between, like 1-3 quests total in different areas, I  would just move on)
---
I like the idea of 10% mat cost. That's pretty much how I calculated tips in the past. 1g for mage spells is very generous of you! I'm sure you make a lot of mage friends haha
---
Till you die!
---
can you remove the top and bottom banners?
---
I guess people have different experiences on different servers, but Ret was seen as a total joke on my server (for raiding, and because it wasn't viable for raiding, you didn't see many of them at all which made it hard to judge in pvp).  I never remember any good Ret paladins that didn't have Hand of Rag, a Grandmarshall 2-hander, etc.  If we're talking about players that all have the very best gear, then sure Ret paladins can be great in pvp, but much like an arms warrior, if you don't have good gear, and more importantly a good weapon, you're going to suck.  A lot of pure dps classes are much less gear dependent.  I'm thinking private servers are a lot different than the true Vanilla experience, though without playing on a private server, I couldn't say for sure... or perhaps the past 15 years simply haven't been too kind on my memory.  If I'm wrong, I apologize for spreading false information.
---
If you bring someone all the mats for their recipe then all they’re doing is pushing a button. It’s basic supply and demand. You need it, they have it. They can set the price if you don’t have another source, that’s how things work.
---
I am not trolling.  I won't pay a mage for water.
---
A good hunter is always tipping 200% of the buying price (we are always loaded) 
---
Its nice to see poor peoples faces light up when i tip 300g on a 100g enchant
---
Same, was bashing my head against a wall back in the day just following zones and attacking lvl 24 mobs at 20 no knowing what the hell else to do

Ha, that’s what I’m trying to get around, I don’t want to commit then change later, I’m the worst kind of altoholic as it is and I’m gonna my damndest not to be this time.
---
Ahh thanks for reminding me about this. 
---
During my vanilla WoW days I used to listen to:
---
Iron Maiden:- especially loved listened to them while levelling through Felwood and Plague lands.
---
Within Temptation/Nightwish:- grouped these two together since they are quite similar sounding. Always enjoyed Azshara and Winterspring to these. Somehow those zones are more relaxing experience.
---
UNKLE:- lovely trip hop for those long grinding sessions or dungeons, especially Strat/Scholo.
---
The Prodigy:- always good choice for PVP. Could get through all their albums and still be in the same AV.
---
Funny how my tastes have changed so much. While I still appreciate different genres I mostly listen to techno/psytrance/house now. However I'll be making a long playlist of all these to enjoy classic in my own way.
---
People are stating how easy Ony, MC, ZG and BWL will be...
---
Why not have wotlk achievements and add encounter achievement? With new title, glamour item rewards, pets/mounts etc.
---
" kill onyxia and all her whelps "
---
" kill ragnoros in under x mins "
---
" kill hakkar while \[insert handicap here"
---
" NO deaths "
---
Achievents would have 0 negative impact on vanilla, nor would armoury. This emotional irrational " buh buh I'm desperate to re-live my youth 1:1 " at the cost of an enhanced classic mind boggles me.
---

You won't have to farm much as an Off-Tank. I had a full Prot alt that i would use for OTing in raids where my main didn't need the gear. I didn't have any time to farm, and since I was offtank, it wasn't really necessary. I could just sign on and shield slam away.
---
This is a great example of how terrible spell batching is. The windfury crits showing up a second after the proc
---
Could it be inferred that it should interact that same way as rogue's instant poisons? I won't if the light/wisdom procs in that circumstance.
---
I don't really get a sexual tension vibe, more of a "respect" vibe.
---
You've clearly never played a druid in vanilla, you need to count getting away alive as a win or you'll be a loser forever.
---
K.  Buy your own water then.  Quick tip though: don't be a dick when you're trying to rely on the charity of others.
---
it must be for the one in july as I wasn't invited to the one in june
---
Guys, I quit gaming 8 mins ago and I can't stop thinking about classic.  I watch 2-3 classic video a second.  I think about it ALL the time.  I LITERALLY CANNOT WAIT!
---
I leveled a prot pally to 60 in Vanilla via questing and AoE farming.  I mostly healed dungeons because A) People didn't want pally tanks and B) there was a lack of healers at the time.  I kept of a complete healing set of mostly cloth items I'd picked up here or there and even with my awful PvE healing skills and I didn't have an issue.  There's no good reason to chase healing gear while leveling.
---
That would be really sick.
---
Cries in Australian
---
Don't give up yet. They are still discussing the issue. New update 8 hours ago.
---
I certainly have not played a druid in Vanilla past level 10 :)
---
I am not going to play RP-PvP right off the bat simply because I’ll be too busy with my main toon on a regular PvP server, but eventually I’d like to join an RP-PvP server (and that’s the only type of RP I will do - no interest in PvE), so I support this.
---
Depends how hardcore you plan on going but in this situation, and with a casual approach, you could have one character you play when you are logged in solo, and one character you only play when both are signed in.
---
Yeah she will never be a Tauren, I’m pretty positive she’s gonna roll orc if she is to be a hunter, based on the comments here.  Ty for your input.  It is vastly appreciated
---
Everyone had it available to load, as I understood it - even though EU people couldn’t join it was still available to download.
---
Luckily, I've never had mats stolen from me but I always get a littlweanxious right before I confirm the trade haha. Can definitely see tipping a well known crafter a little more for peace of mind.
---
Because it only serves to make the inevitable happen faster....?
---
If a hacker wants to break into my google account: it will happen, no matter what.

But that doesnt mean I add my password and username to my mmo-champ forum signature...
---
Very few people will brute force their way blind into figuring out how layering works. Fewer still will be 50+ in time to take advantage of it. 
---
Many more will if the boundaries are documented and any reasonably intelligent person can thought experiment how to circumvent them.
---
Exploiters exist, we cant avoid the reality. But we can make the practice have a high barrier to entry. 
---
One guy on alliance on Arthas US knew how to hop outside the WSG map with the flag. One guy. If the mechanisms of layer hoping are obfuscated, a similarly low number of people will put in the effort to learn it themselves. 
---
Add in that Blizzard only has to keep layering going for a few months, and its fine. A month into the game, the layers will have people farming most valuable spots on most layers most times a day. Even if you know how to hop, youll more and more frequently come across picked flowers, mined thorium and dead mobs. 
---
Layer abuse is dangerous in the first month when the uber nerds hit 60 week 1 and by week 3 are PreBis. By 1 month, people who play 3 hours a night on weekdays and 6 a day on weekends will be around 100 hours in, so like 40-50--right around when the mobs and materials are end game.
---
I used to listen to Coldplay when doing AV back in LK and it remained.
---
get a second mage to double up that AoE dmg
---
I have faith in blizz to fix meleeway. Its still 2 months left, maybe decide upon a class next month for sure? To see if they fix it I mean.
---
Privileged mage sitting atop his table of privilege.
---
You don't really need to level restro.  Ele will let you heal fine and do DPS.
---
Living the Dream.
---
Except they paid money for that recipe.
---
Why would that help?
---
It's really not that much money in the grand scheme of things. Also building up some rep with an enchanter or two never hurts I've actually had an enchanter cover me when I forgot a mat because they remembered how well I tipped.
---
300g tip?? Please let me know which server you roll on! ;)
---
I’ll give you an upvote just because I don’t want any of you neck beards on my Pvp server.
---
That makes sense. 
---
It's strange though because after junes test the client went away on my launcher.
---
Was planning to play multiple caracther ,and focus on my main when im alone.
---
It only gets problematic if you get a 5 or more level gap between you and your friends. So it would need kind of a lot of different playtime.
---
Unless you really wanna rush your main to 60, nothing wrong leveling youre alt with your friends.  If they catch  at some point, just switch on your main to play with friends.
---
[Kargoz on YouTube](https://youtu.be/t_rHqqYnh18) did a nice video regarding this topic. Tl;Dr paladin + warlock is god tier. Infinite mana for the warlock due to mana tap + heals. Pally buffs on pet is fantastic (wisdom on imp, let's it spam fireballs all day with little mana issue). Lots of survival...fear, bubble, hp stone, pet tank, sacrifice void for shield, pally bubble.... Just need some random 3ed to summon. Etc
---
Don’t mages have to pay to learn to conjure water?
---
That's a move in the right direction imho and I don't say that because it *literally ticks one of my boxes* in OP :P  
---
It also shows that tweaks to the system are possible and happening, so push back from the players with reasoned arguments has a chance to help improve the system and minimize the downsides.  
---
I think it's too late in the release cycle to expect them to just scrap it and go with something else like some people are suggesting.
---
Kitten, Cub, and Hatchling forms.
---
Sure, I can agree with that, it’s more my own perception of it from years ago than it is something objective.
---
Same here.
---
Nothing ruins a levelling duo faster than one getting too far ahead and trying to play catch up.
---
I'll be rolling warlock my friend priest.  Warrior alt when she's not around.
---
Welcome to what US players have felt on priv servers the past years
---
No? I mentioned it because people always point it out. Shut the fuck up, I'm 10x the man you'll ever be. Move along
---
"Blizzard teams up with Amazon in an all new gaming environment. With Amazon Server, we transport a booster server in a van and park it down by the river, right in front of your house. And at no extra charge, it could stay there several days until it moves on to the next area in high demand!"
---
Please...  That cost 1g or something.
---
I like how your title stipulates hunters are bugged yet your post includes 3rd grade grammar, yet no supporting points for hunter bugs
---
Just because you guys have felt that for years on unofficial private servers does NOT mean that we should have to feel that on official servers that im actually paying for
---
I almost feel like it would be a solid #nochanges idea to implement a 100ms base ping for all players to be on a similar vanilla-like playing field
---
Mage is more self sufficient, warrior is great for groups and making friends
---
Back in the day I AOE grinded zombies at the farm in NW WPL. Fast spawn time, lots of them.

Best options for gold farming and wpvp for someone with limited time for raids. Not sure if we're going horde or alliance yet, but my main focus in classic will probably be gearing up twinks, so I'll need a good gold farmer and gurubashi arena contender to help my friends out.
---
Thinking mage might be the best option, played hunter vanilla-wotlk and just never really enjoyed their pvp style. Also considering druid or priest so I can do more than dps for dungeon/raids.
---
Live action animatrix 🤦‍♂️
---
I always found real life friends to be unreliable for leveling.
---
If you are all serious about this game you should level at your own pace and stick together at level 60 (if they make it to 60(
---
I'll be rushing to 40 to learn portals.
---
Depends how much time/gold you save. If a mage gives me 4 stacks of water that would probably cost a decent amount of gold to buy from a vendor so I’d tip like 50s. Teleports are the same. I’ll gladly pay 50s-1g if a mage instantly invites me and puts down a portal when I post in general. 
---
These are different than something like a transmute of a rare recipe because they cost the mage very little. Arcanite transmute is usually 5g whether it’s a guildee or not because it requires the person to level up alchemy and they are in high demand. Unless a warrior was trying to get a bunch of bars quickly for an epic then I’d prolly give it for free once or twice.
---
stop using big words at me im only in 3rd grade!!
---
don't think blizzard gonna budge for 1500 people, maybe 15k+ but not 1500.
---
I’m just saying lol it’s not about the ease of them doing it, it’s basic economics of supply and demand. I agree, they shouldn’t charge, or charge hardly anything, to just make some water. But when they have something you want, it’s up to them to dictate what it costs.
---
For me:
---
Step 1: find friends
---
Correct, but it wasn't a "we will let 1 person have this item" situation, it was "fuck, we accidentally left it in the game" type situation.
---
Thanks for this. I have been binging WoW vanilla machinima to pass the time.
---
For cooldowns, if I was providing the service I would strive to be aware of the opportunity cost.  For example, for mooncloth, it's a 4d CD and it costs 2 felcloth.  So in this case, the difference between market cost of 1 mooncloth and 2 felcloth (the expected profit were I to do it myself).  If you were to offer anything less than that, I would refuse because it makes less sense than if I were to buy 2 felcloth and do it myself, and just sell the resulting mooncloth.
---
You can apply the same logic to any other crafting cooldowns and draw the same conclusions.
---
As for rare patterns, that is going to be a little more mercurial.  Generally, you'll never find an opportunity for "tipping", rather they will upfront charge you for the service.  At that point it is the seller's market, and the cost will depend on how prolific the pattern is and how rare the materials are.
---
For character skills, you want to at least meet the reagent price.  If you are buying a portal from a mage, don't offer less than the cost of the reagent, and strive to offer more for their time.  Same thing for water/food, offer more than vendor costs for the food and then extra for the time it takes to craft (which is quite a lot of time in vanilla).
---
If don’t right it would be pretty stellar
---
It's not nice to call your fiancee a broad!
---
The trick is to *never shut up* about how excited you are for WoW.  My wife has vested interest in the game, but I still rant and rave to her about how excited I am every time I get the chance.  She is sick of hearing about it, and at this point she is downright excited for me to binge it for a week straight just to get it out of my system so she doesn't have to hear about it anymore.
---
Yes! 
---
Female trolls were so rare (women wow players in general were, so that might be a factor).  I am pretty sure my female troll priest was the only one on my server at the time! 
---
I remember being in BC beta before I saw another one as we ran by each other. We both stopped immediately and ogled each other, then we exchanged some tells about how we've never seen another female troll priest in raid gear before lol.
---
That was probably 12 years ago and for some odd reason I still remember her guild name!  My brain picks the most useless things to remember lol
---
Hahah. Why wouldn't they add them in. There's got to be people who want it.
---
Lmao I’m crying !
---
Shit post soon to be locked
---
I bet you demand free healthstones from random warlocks also.

Play a mage if it's such a big deal to you.

But if you’re starting at launch, there won’t be any 60s to follow you around trolling for a long time

mate you are a goon
---
Yeah I was so confused
---
Actually the last beta patch, had a ton of fixes for hunters so I hear?
---
Best $15 ever spent on gaming, IMO. I was a terrible altaholic with a huge /played time. Thank you Joana!
---
Spot on, my friends are casual players and I will slow me down in my own progress so I decided as you to lvl a special toon with them.
---
&gt; not all of us can go blowing the fire extinguisher directly into the flame lol

This made me chuckle
---
Holy damn those UIs. Cool stuff but.. Damn. True vanilla experience.
---
if you make a shaman purely as a bank alt, you can spec into ghost wolf so that it's insta-cast at lvl 20

if you're a druid you can spec into feral swiftness to get 30% run speed at lvl 20

Any time I hear a song from the Panic at the Disco record "A Fever You Cant Sweat Out" - for some reason back in 05 this record was on repeat anytime i'd be grinding
---
I hope blizz is looking into it because on the stress tests some of the damage was showing up after mobs were dead.
---
The strength ones?
---
So your strategy is to watch for sting, see how much it drains on the first tick, then dispel if it's max rank or what? Genuinely curious.
---
Lesser Magic Essence is a limited supply item though and typically will be bought out by the first person to visit the vendor since it sells for like 8s and can be turned into a wand and sold.
---
Until someone MC's you in BRM and you fall to your death instead .\_.
---
&gt; put some sex on the damage meters with mind flay. Alpha shit.
---
More like pipe dream shit.
---
lvl 35 Horde Druid with tailoring/ leatherworking or alchemy sounds like the perfect bank alt.
---
LOL! I oneshot every single rogue on the planet as ret reckoning, please do your homework son.
---
I think that's safe to infer.  Same as flametongue weapon.  Although I would argue if SoC can activate other procs, they need to roll back windfury to be able to activate other procs.
---
There is a fuck ton of guides and YouTube videos about this that go into insane detail. There's even a sticky in this subreddit for guides. Asking here is pretty much a waste of time. Use Google "wow classic shaman leveling" and maybe add specific keywords like ele etc. 
---
I would also recommend you check out the "Countdown to Classic" podcast. There is 2 or 3 that go into detail about each shaman spec and leveling. It's on Spotify. 
---
But to reiterate, the guides are out there just use Google, man.
---
till the light dies in your eyes
---
The best preparation is to go unprepared, that's the way you will have the most fun
---
Don't ruin it by watching hundreds of guides
---
As a Canadian that played private servers hosted in Europe, I forgot what it's like to play with low ping. I didn't mind playing with high ping either but I was a hunter.
---
Please, what you are doing has been done by weak people on the internet for years.
---
How's that finished talking to me going?
---
I tip based on time.
---
Each second is worth 1 silver 38 copper.
---
It's feels too artificial right now. Like you do something and know you'll have to wait to see the outcome.
---
I used to play WoW, whats the difference between today's and classic?
---
Exercise during flight paths is a great use of spare time.
---
Either that or porn.  It's really a coin toss.
---
I would’ve been pretty impressed with 280, then you went and added another zero
---
Need to be careful with enchanting grey items, many addons auto-sell them. Better off with unbound whites.
---
Oh makes sense, RIP to this then. Let's switch focus to the spell batching, hah!
---
So much this! If you're really committing to breaking the auction house, do it anonymously. 
---
When you're selling 20 stacks of something and also buying the only other 3 stacks on the AH to up the price, you don't want to do that on your main.
---
Shadow Priest please!
---
Fortunately anything other than human rogues will likely be bullied out of existence in Classic, so have no fear!
---
go warlock. fast and smooth leveling. Sought after in both PvP and PvE. An all around beast of a class.
---
Chat disable for 3 seconds.
---
Right. They basically created lag on a low ping server. It feels clunky and doesn’t play well.
---
That’s not rushing my dude, that’s just being efficient not rushing  but I guess we all have different opinions
---
That's dumb though because while your coordinating with your friends/guildmates to decide what server you're rolling on your name you want to reserve will probably be taken.
---
I mean, the advantage of a paladin is downloading and consuming massive amounts of pornography.
---
Nothing like pulling a mob, alt tabbing to porn, and being sure your character will eventually kill it.
---
He means very abundant
---
Leaving them in the dust because I will be insanely addicted. Maybe run them through a dungeon occasionally ;)
---
I play (well, played before I quit in BoD) with ~180ms and it's really not a big deal. Didn't stop me from doing anything in the game. Maybe if you're into high level PvP it might be a problem, but I don't have experience with that.
---
That's just the date they will allow names to be reserved. They should release the server list before that date.
---
Sure, it’s like watching DoTs and cleansing/healing
---
Yeah I'm taking the leisurely route too.  I plan on hitting every Horde and neutral quest hub in every zone, getting every dungeon quest and knocking them all out, and generally re-experiencing the world.
---
It isn't a race, it's a journey.
---
In organized pvp alliance get an extra dispeler in the form of pally, and they are god pvp healers unlike shaman, who's totems are easier to play around and who only has an offensive purge.  Horde warlocks and horde in general are going to feel the pain of alliance warlocks since their dispel saturation will be lower than alliance (more dots, more fears outside wotf).  Something to consider.
---
Love that game,  best game I have ever played
---
Last thing I want is to log in on Aug 12th to reserve my 3 names on a server only to find out that all my friends rolled on a different server.
---
Or I have to wait all day to coordinate with them what server we want to roll on and then end up losing our name reservation.
---
Feel better?
---
Just watch vids on YouTube for vanilla/classic. They'll be extremely more specific to the information you're looking for.
---
Time constraint does not effect the gold per hour. `gph = gpk * kph`
---
The expected gold per kill does not depend on the amount of kills, that would be the gambler's fallacy.
---
Damn dick mages asking to be compensated for thier time.
---
&gt; What stops EU players playing on US servers
---
The EU have their own servers. Why would they want to play on US ones?   
---
The problem for some EU people is not having a server officially in their own, non-English language.
---
Blizzard can do no wrong I see.
---
Their curses/soulstone/health stone/banish/strong dps in aq+nax. Alliance just has less.
---
Damn, didn't know. Thanks for adding that! In addition, you can macro your pet to attack totems
---
Run dungeons when they are not online and level professions. That way you can always be on the same quests and zones. Even if you get a few lvls ahead with the dungeons, you can still quest together and it'll just make it easier.
---
Another plus note for hunters, AV and multishot crits never get old
---
It wouldn't.  He thought there will be no EU servers at all.  He's confused.
---
This might actually be the correct behavior. While information on various procs is sketchy and much of private server behavior here is a guess, lets look at the intention.
---
Look at Seal of the Crusader. Increased attack speed traded for reduced damage. What on earth is the point of this? Well, as this person points out, paladins have a variety of Judgements that trigger on hit, like JoL, JoW, and even JoJ. Seal of the Crusader then finds a niche as a tool for increasing your proc rate. 
---
However, if SoR procs are meant to trigger seals, then what on earth is the point of SotC? The behavior observed in the OP actually makes sense as-is.
---
Oh well.
---
where can I find the rogue version?
---
First raid together and you'll be explaining the mechanics and calling shot? How do I not sign up?
---
Plot twist: twin emps skinned night elves
---
The fact that this needed to be explained instantly makes me lose hope for the quality of players in Classic.
---
Its far easier to RP on a PvP server than it is to PvP on an RP server.
---
There will be RP servers.  Just not RP-PvP servers at the start.  They will come later.
---
The only rule(s) for RP server now (which I doubt blizzard will change for classic) is naming.
---
yes i know that i will be able to abuse it because the system as a whole is flawed. even if the cd is 15 min after 2 switches ( wich it wont since that would be absolutly retarded ) then i can still ajust my burning steps lap to include as many rich thorium as i can within 15 min and then go to another layer.
---
There will be RP servers. That is a dedicated place for RP.
---
Yes you can use it!
---
Yeah that's true looking back I did jump around zones a lot at the very end. :) I can't wait
---
not if you don't want to grind.  ignore everyone who talks about alternate quest zones because there isn't a choice.  if you want to continuously quest you can't skip any zone post 20.  
---
joana's guides make this abundantly clear if you don't trust some random person who enjoys leveling.  he's constantly ping ponging around zones and doesn't even touch the 'level 40 zones' until 43-44.
---
I will post the Rogue version on my instagram tomorrow.

I have ADHD and I'd say hyperfixation is my Big Thing. Like it's a defining characteristic. I can't help but obsess over whatever my latest addiction is, whether it's a TV show or a video game or a new craft I picked up. I'll do shit on the fly like make a website for a TV show I'm loving a lot, or I'll buy a lot of fabric for quilting... It's bad. And by \*bad\* I mean, it's REALLY BAD. I've had obsessions last 10+ years, but I've also had a lot that lasted the span of mere months. The problem is that if I'm \*not\* hyperfixating on something, I get extremely depressed and feel devoid of all good things. I know my hyperfixations drive my spouse mad sometimes, but without something to obsess over, I'm bored, and boredom is ADHD's worst enemy.
---
(NOTE: I've done some reading in the past and found a lot of ADHD people deal with depression-like issues without their hyperfixations, especially if they also have anxiety, so that's food for thought.)
---
I've learned over the years that the best way for me to deal with my obsessions is to start forcing myself to REALLY consider what I'm doing before I do it. Stop, Think, Act. It sounds so stupid but I do so many impulsive things Just Because I Can that it's useful to at least force myself to consider it a step longer than usual. Do I \*really\* need 20 more skeins of yarn (even though it's really cool and it's on sale) when I have 200 sitting around unused? No—I do not. Should I buy a webcam so that I can stream the cats (CatCam™!!)? Well—probably not. What about playing WoW for 10 hours straight while neglecting to clean the litterboxes or do the dishes? Not every day!
---
These things aren't necessarily \*bad\* on their own but 1) I'm liable to do all of them within minutes of each other, and 2) oftentimes these things come at or with a cost that isn't money, like my health or marriage. 
---
(Frustration/irrational anger at being interrupted while obsessing/focusing is an ADHD thing, too. Obviously you can get like this and NOT have ADHD, but I've noticed I do this when I don't just straight up tune everything else out...and that is Very Bad.)
---
Thinking about long-term goals has helped me curb my behavior a bit (I say, even though I definitely just set up a webcam 'for the cats' lol). At the very least I'm thinking about things like cost (be it time, money, or emotional). Yeah, my husband isn't going to tell me that I can't play WoW, but if I'm on that computer every night from 2pm 'til 10pm and I never spend time with him or hang out with him, the cost is going to be our relationship, the state of the house, et cetera. See also: I made a commitment to my cats when I adopted them, so I need to make time and space for them, too: not just cleaning boxes and feeding them, but paying attention to them, too.

Discipline is a big factor in successfully managing obsessive behavior, too. I don't want to discredit this. You can 'bargain' with yourself all you want ("I'll quest for two hours and then do a load of laundry!") but if you're constantly breaking those deals you make "because it doesn't matter" then it won't help. Bettering yourself is a LOT of work.

And hey, not gonna lie, it's hard not to become consumed by something fun and engaging, at least for me. But since I found out I have ADHD I've been putting some serious effort into learning how to better live with it—for my sake, and everyone else in my house. I don't know if you have ADHD too, but I feel like normal people don't get so hyperfixated on a game or TV show or whatever that it's literally all-consuming, especially not to the extent that they legitimately fear it happening. I totally get it, so I wanted to add my two cents in case it helped you at all!
---
(Sorry if you weren't being super serious with this statement, but just in case... I also agree with u/delaurentism that the part that's the most fun is playing with friends, and it's easier for me to take it a bit slower if I don't feel the need to keep up with the Joneses/outpace the people I really want to enjoy the game with.)
---
lol! that is a good once. I mean in another country!
---
I see what you’re getting at, but it is not even remotely likely that they will completely cancel WoW classic.
---
Come on blizzard THE COMMUNITY wants this. Do right by us. Even just 1 server.
---
It's not a long video at all and the whole thing is funny. Savix has good taste in memes as well when he does these edits.

---
Don't think so, they said they'll give more info on server names when getting closer to release date, they'll definitely get them out earlier than that
---
How is it **very likely**?
---
This:
---
&gt;Considering the amount of bugs and other issues currently in the beta
---
Is not facts.
---
.....dumb or trolling?
---
Hmmmmm, maybe both?
---
RP-PvP, lawl
---
I will not make more weapons turn. Will be something new for all of them
---
Yes you can use it as an icon - Stay tuned for more
---
There is a contingent that plans on rolling on a PvP server and doing just this.
---
The real issue is the playerbase will instantly split without a RPPvP designated server. Not everyone will be ok with rolling on a straight PvP server, and not everyone who wants RPPvP will want to roll on a RP server.
---
If you want I can link you the discord for the Group that plans on rolling on a PvP server should no RPPvP get announced.
---
August 12th *is* closer to release date.
---
&gt;  they'll definitely get them out earlier than that
---
There's no evidence to support this.
---
I did the same with a news article about the launch of BC once, it was seriously 50% WOW IS DED comments even back then.
---
Yeah, hitting 40 feels really nice. But then you realize you have a ton of leveling to do to hit cap I would always just spend time world pvp'ing to take a break xD
---
"I think it will fail, so I will set it up to fail" great corporate thinking :c
---
Don't be stupid, they could absolutely do wrong by fucking up Classic once it's launched. 
---
But it's not even close to launch, and Id rather them focus on the game than holding everyones whiny hands.
---
Legion was pretty well finished. As much as an expansion could be, or even Vanilla was when it released. Granted, part of the reason that Legion was finished is because Blizz completely abandoned WoD.
---
Would be my honor !
---
Thanks man
---
It's really nice that you still have these old screenshots...wish I had mine!
---
Just beware of this place on the Moon Guard server. It’s... yeah.
---
Do the warrior with her so u don’t bleed out the eyes. Lock is such a easy solo class. The priest warrior combo is mint.
---
Wait for the Rogue one. the runes are even better there
---
No it fuckin isn't. The beta gave people the time of their lives. Bugged or not (and frankly compared to the original game you can cope with it) people will enjoy it, they wouldn't cancel it after all that work. They're on it.
---
My group came across a lot! Did you play Horde or Alliance? Played Horde for a lot of years, then switched to Alliance. The RP dwarves are the best dude. Clan Battlehammer had me laughing my ass off.
---
No, you'd rather go on reddit and attack subjective experiences as being objectively false.
---
Perfect. Just as we all expected and wanted.
---
Blizzard is not going to cancel Classic, they're not even going to postpone the release. Whatever bugs still in the game will either be fixed or not, none of them are gamebreaking.
---
Can I have whatever you're smoking? It seems awesome!
---
I get it, your acting like its really 2004 and being emo?
---
Awesome. My guild only farmed trash for BoEs. We never downed a single boss. Do you have a wipe count for the bosses you took pics with?
---
TROLL
---
How has there been two of these shitposts today already?
---
those are their words: " We’ll have more information on realm names closer to launch, but rest assured—you’ll have plenty of time to figure out your plans for realm domination!" giving the server names and types will not require any effort, they'll decide that much earlier, so they have no reason to keep it hidden so late

[Role Playing Naming Policy](https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/135764) 
---
Updated: 10 months ago 
---
Article ID: 135764  
---
Relevant Games:  World of Warcraft 
---
Role Play (RP) servers are intended to provide players with an added level of immersion in the game world. Names on RP servers must adhere to Blizzard's Code of Conduct, and also must avoid being disruptive to the world.
---
Examples of common unacceptable or disruptive RP names include (but are not limited to):
---
Non-medieval or non-fantasy names (For example: Slipnslide, Robotman, Technotron)
---
Names that reference well known people, characters, brands, places, or icons (For example: Britneyspears, Austinpowers, Mcdonalds, Georgewashington, Newyork)
---
Names that consist of multiple words (For example: Inyourface, Welovebeef, Howareyou, Sixtyseventy)
---
Blizzard reserves the right to assign a random name to any character violating our RP naming policy. 
---
For more severe or repeat violations, we may apply additional penalties to the account.
---
They probably will though, if you've played the beta yourself you should know that there's no hope for an august release this year
---
Yep, one of the best loved things about classic is having 1 enchanting skill yet being able to disenchant level 60 items. No required skill level. LOL. Its fantastic for bank alts.
---
The being said, I don't really think the rules need to be enforced for an RP community to thrive. They just need to know what servers the RP is happening on. Hell, those rules DEFINITELY are not enforced on Moon Guard and it still has the biggest RP community out there.
---
Because this same goofball made both posts.
---
Definitely mage since they're the most effective goldfarmers, with their aoe capabilities. They also perform well without gear, is s-tier in pvp and can leveled fast with aoe farming as well.
---
Wait, how does that work for people with laptops and moving around? Or like going to an internet cafe? I feel like it'd be hard for them to prove its account sharing as long as it's not like 15 seconds and multiple miles distance. If they're playing together it's feasible to think one person took their device to the others house, or there was another computer there. 
---
Not doubting you, just curious. I don't have the necessary friends to exploit this, so no worries there.
---
“You’ll be livin IN A VAN
---
DOWN BY THE RIVER”
---
Lmfao going straight to the 10x man proving the point, thanks for the laugh
---
Will ask for tip if a random person ask me water to quest. Because you are obviosly taking me some time to cast/regen. etc. I Think thats understandable.
---
But will NEVER ask for anything for ANY 5man instance / group quest.  I dont want my healer to skip a drink phase because he is saving up money. no fucking way.
---
And between most of my trip in zepplin or boat that im not going AFK, I will offer people to open trade for water, since im just standing there... some tips, some dont.  I dont care.
---
no.
---
Strike of the hydra is not BOE, it's BOP. It's a sword, not an axe, and I believe the drop rate is 20%. The shit axe you are thinking of is probably boahn's fang, the wailing caverns one. (ironically, as you argue for wailing caverns). 
---
The thing is, lots of modest chances, added up, are a much greater chance. If you want the algae fists, and tortoise armor, and the strike of the hydra, when you run blackfathom, your odds of getting none of those when you are the only one rolling (horde warrior) are .5*.5*0.8. = 0.2. You have an 80% chance to get a random drop of a blue that is better than what you have, in blackfathom deeps as a horde warrior. 
---
You also get the arctic buckler, which is both better itemized and just better than seedcloud, and shamans can't roll on it as it's a quest reward. 
---
You can make the argument that you should run vastly fewer dungeons than I do. I think that's right. And I do recommend running wailling caverns once, because the staff is very good and very tough to replace. 
---
But an 80% chance of getting a blue, plus the outlaw sabre/arctic buckler, and one of the blues is the best dps warrior sword you can realistically have for that level? I think doing blackfathom deeps at least once is well worth it as horde.
---
Yeah it would be funny to make one for each specc aswell as class
---
I assume the plot was meant to be during vanilla given Prestor being alive.
---
It's a good choice for grinding. Gives rep with Argent Dawn when you wear the Argent Dawn commission trinket. Did the rep grind back in the day. If I remember it correctly the way to do the grind for best effect was to do zero quests in WPL and instead just grind the zombies without turning in any of the rep items that drops. Reason being the zombies stop giving rep once you hit like honored or something. At that point you turn in all your rep items and can start doing the quests. Should get close to revered doing it this way. Then in order to get exalted you run strat and scholo for the last push.
---
Im not the screenshot taker ;) i dont know sorry.
---
Rest in peace Totalbiscuit. He started with World of Warcraft content.
---
Also we don't have anyway to confirm for example what the player retention is like.
---
If RP-PvP has the highest retention rate then it is far more valuable as a server type than other servers for example.
---
Pure Population numbers are garbage but rather retention rate is the most important factor.
---
Well it seems to make person retarded when you smoke so i suggest you to smoke something else.
---
Yeah, if youre in a group sharing is normal
---
I am burning a warrior to max. I will level my Druid alt to max with my wife. 2nd alt will be probably a dwarf priest which I will lvl solely with my crew. 
---
Warrior is my main. I am going to try and hit 60 on him in the first week. I don’t expect any of my crew to no life it like I will. I have the whole opening week off. I am planning on 18 hour days.
---
The Druid I should be able to catch my wife with. She is pretty casual. 
---
The Priest I will level with the boys when we all get our mains to max. Plan on leveling with them in dungeons the whole way. 
---
Depending on how quickly we get a raid team together. There are 10ish of us so we will have to recruit. With the 2nd alts it may be a while before we level them.
---
Absolutely, it won't be scrapped. But they know the issues and they know how damaging it can be if it doesn't work.
---
And as long as these little fixes keep coming in, and it's gone by Phase 2, I think we'll be just fine.
---
At base it's 400g worth of mats from the specific vendors + about 150-300g from auction house mats depending on server prices.
---
You can shave about 200-250g from the initial mats buy purchasing the service from another lock ( another lock needs to have bought them).
---
In full though epic mount quests for both locks and paladins aren't "free" at all, maybe about 100g/300g cheaper than an actual epic mount at most /least.
---
Gnome is the optimal race for allaince pve and pvp as mage, yes. The only noticeable downsides are dismounting in water, not being able to make some jumps as easily, and of course, looking like a twat
---
Rogues are extremely overplayed. And no their dps isnt best, warrior is by far in each raid. Rogues actually drop to 3rd/4th dps class in naxx. People will be running 2/3 times more warriors than rogues at any stage of the game. 
---
But mostly not that the rogues are bad, its more about their abundance.
---
14 days *is* closer to launch and *is* plenty of time to figure out your plans for realm domination. It's silly to speculate anything else since we know they'll have to release realm names by this time. That's their deadline, they have no reason to do it before.
---
That'd be great, thanks.
---
I used to craft a lot of NR gear, and Hide of the Wild on my leatherworker. If I'm sitting in org doing nothing, 15-25g was pretty standard, if I'm out in the world farming or doing something else, and you want me to come back, im going to be asking for a bit more. Hide of the Wild crafts usually got me 35-40 per craft, more if I needed to use my own deeprock salt.
---
I use it in HotS, it works fine
---
Yeah or wand.
---
It really depends where your priorities will lie.  Will you be 1v1'ing, dueling a lot?  Or wpvp?  Or are you going to be spending more time in BGs?  Dont forget to consider that soloqueue is probably going to resemble wpvp more unless you get lucky with decent teammates or an effective party distribution, whereas it'll be a different story in a premade group queuing together.
---
Can you explain the math to me? For example: 
---
Goblin Shipbuilder,	20,	4,	145,	1450,	406
---
I don't understand how these numbers fit together.
---
The real killer is double iceblock. PRetty much chew through every hunter option to save themselves then just live on the slows.
---
The karma farmer calling me a neckbeard. Ironic.
---
Gnorfs, lol defo gonna use that from now on
---
look at all those hunters! From what you read these days, you need to only bring 1 or 2 hunters per raid. Amazing they even killed the first boss!  /s
---
(play the class you want, have fun!)
---
Glad you enjoyed it! Be sure to upvote OP's post if possible!
---
Some reason tho, if you are tauren and go to org, you get TB automatically.  Orc or trolls that GY skip to TB get org automatically.
---
The whole point of Roleplay servers is to provide a roleplaying environment.
---
The effects of an RP-PvP server is that it allows you to further flesh out your character and dictate their actions in the open world not just in random roleplay encounters or arranged roleplay.
---
For example I could choose not to help the undead if i saw them in trouble on an RP-PvP server and if I did help someone I would have to be cautious about my AoE's etc because they could be affected.
---
There are many subtle things that RP-PvP brings and everyone has their own take.
---
Wonderful picture!!! Any chance for a highres version? :)
---
Jesus what have you been doing in the game, multiple NG+7's?
---
Rest in Peace Stix, best guild leader I ever knew.
---
There hasn't been any final words actually the most recent interview comment about them from a dev was that they were being considered in larger regions
---
Nesta troll NA and EU
---
CEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEB
---
Don't be stupid like I was back then and admit to account sharing. I never said it was a perm ban if you use your head and come up with a good story. You want to avoid downtime and automated temp ban is downtime that is avoidable and worth avoiding.
---
Yep, I guess it is still around!
---
Indeed! One would believe, and I can only fall back on my own experience and observations, that players invested in their character, and it's role in a community, would be easier to retain.
---
The starter areas will be packed for weeks easily.
---
&gt; I explained why all specs are viable for different reasons
---
No you didn't. You backpedaled like a madman, in some cases outright lied, and in some cases went full retard. "This spec is viable because some people somewhere have fun playing it" is not an argument.
---
So then what is the point of opening up name reservations at a specific time and giving the date in advance?
---
Only people who will benefit from that is solo players with no guild or friends and they can just pick a random server and start reserving their names.
---
Names will be gone in seconds of the server lists dropping. I don't use very popular names but on the Private server that opened up last saturday all my name's were taken immediately and I was there the instant the server launched.
---
That was a Private server with only 20k people.
---
No it only is the old alpha version of Ahn'Quiraj, not cut content
---
Watch as little videos as possible, you might feel forced to play a certain way, pick a certain class, take a certain route etc. just go in blind en enjoy the experience. The only tip I can give you is: have some restraint with the AH, buying gear upgrades during leveling adds up and you don´t really need it.
---
It´s nice to have enough money for a mount at 40.
---
I clicked so fast. Damn these clickbaiters. He got me.
---
ItS jUsT a BeTa BLizZaRd CaN dO No WroNg!!
---
Okay now explain your math that led you to this figure please!
---
Is there a chance you could do the druid one? :)
---
Not sure how much expierence you have in Vanilla or not but I can tell you for a fact that dungeon xp is minimal and grinding and questing is the fastest way to level easily. The benefit of dungeons is getting some nice gear and a break from grinding and questing (make sure you do the dungeon quests to make them not a waste of time) but generally it is not worth running the same dungeon more than once unless there is an item that you must have/will keep for several levels.
---
If I outlevel my friends, I’ll help them on dungeons/group quests when they need it. I’m sure they’ll do the same. I’m not going to farm their quests with them but I’ll certainly give them a hand with the capstone beast quests in stv (for example) or a run through uldaman if I’m a bit higher
---
Just ignore EveClassic - they are one of the resident RP-PvP troll and won't acknowledge any opinion but there own or rather facts as well are completely out of their mind.
---
Still stuck on that myself.
---
Thanks for the insight!
---
thanks for the clarification.
---
Yeah! And we even cleared Naxxramas with so many Hunters. :D
---
Yeah, the technology has really improved. I remember getting ~500 ping on an US CS 1.6 or early League of Legends servers.
---
The classic beta is hosted in the US and I literally never noticed it until I hovered over to check my ping and saw 130.
---
You are misunderstanding me. I meant "waiting 2-3 levels" in the sense that there was absolutely no sense of urgency on the quest. You are not waiting 3 levels for a purpose, I just meant "you have such a margin of safety you can have completed quests in your log for 3 levels and still get full exp for them". 
---
There are the same total number of quests, regardless of what order you do them in. Both strategies get all the quests. 
---
I would argue the person willing to do them at a higher level has more total quests as he can do more of the starting quests without deciding he is too overleveled. 
---
So both strategies need to grind or dungeon for the same total exp. By not doing your on level quests, you aren't forfeiting any exp, you are just DELAYING the exp. So it only really puts the grinding earlier. And I don't think most people are dinging 60 without doing any grinding at any point.
---
they know player are gonna rush on the creation, and picking the wrong server will only damage players' experience, so let's just say if they have an IQ higher than 50 you'll hear server news separately
---
Yeah, it was allowed cause it was a pug.
---
50g per hour is a pretty good metric for what most level 60 players can farm out.
---
That's roughly 1 silver 38 copper per second.
---
I was never under the impression that SoR procs etc. we’re supposed to trigger ‘on hit’ effects. I don’t know whether or not this was the case but I had never assumed that it was.
---
You say that, but I usually just cleanse when that happens too. I don't have the UI capabilities to tell whether my mage friend was hit with rank 1 or max rank of whatever, unless I can see the priest trying to proc BO.
---
“Burn, you wretched! BURN!”
---
That won't happen,
---
People would:
---
Cancel or never renew WoW Subscription
---
Stop buying any Activision/Blizzard release
---
Be angry and ask way too many refunds so that theit Customer Support would be "DoS"ed.
---
The Impact would be wayyyyy to big to handle.
---
Result another crash in on the market. So no, they will never do that.
---
Blizzard have a great potential to gain value on the market.
---
may not be on the beta, but I leveled on the stress tests, it's still a great experience and it feels smoother than a pserv, that's more than enough for a lot of people, believe it or not
---
Best advice Indeed!  take youre time! level youre profession!
---
Join one of these guild with a funny name advertising themselve as casual!
---
Do a lot of instance group, best way to make friends!
---
The game will take you for a ride! trust me!
---
Ahah, GG blizz
---
Repost eh?
---
Sadly your stats doesn't cover retention numbers which are a massive factor. Raw numbers are absolutely worthless given that Classic WoW's intake curve is massively different to Retail.
---
Classic starts high maybe increases for a month or so and then will likely bleed numbers. This is why server common retention rates are actually the most important - because server types that generally retain more people are actually better for money intake.
---
Wow!
---
Nice shot!
---
Spam much? Can we get a ban?
---
???
---
You literally don't know that. There hasnt been a single word spoken about them coming later. Why are you lying for no reason whatsoever?
---
yawn
---
Row 1 has the details
---
- There are 4 level 20 goblin shipbuilders
---
- a level 20 mob grants 145 xp when killed by a level 20 character
---
- killing all four is 1,450 base xp (145xp * 2.5 cause elite * 4)
---
- In a group of 5, that 1,450 is split between 5 players, with 40% group bonus - (1,450 * 1.4)/5 - for 406xp per player for killing all the level 20 goblin shipbuilders
---
I remember looting on the stress test was laggy as well, but it might have been because the servers were in NA or something
---
Same, bud. I'm not taking time off to play classic; I'll be able to do that for years. I'm taking time off to be a part of the madness that will be the launch. The queues, the complaints, the crashes, the bugs, the pvp.
---
Guess what? nobody cares.
---
the delay is blizzlike. the "proof" videos you posted are when using ranged shot on a different target after meleeing another. The ranged timer only restarts when melee attacking the same target. Single target melee weaving will only exist on private servers. Sorry :)
---
+1, I agree druid/priest would be fun. You'd have to walk from the Tauren starting zone and meet up somewhere right away, but no big deal.
---
You go feral, stay in cat for quests and she starts shadow. Pop into Bear to tank dungeons or harder quests. You get the leather gear, she gets the cloth. At 55ish, she goes Holy and you start collecting healing gear she doesn't need. At 60 you can tank some dungeons and you can put together a healing set for yourself. If you're raiding together you can have a great time as a resto drood while she's holy/disc. : )
---
I wish they did.
---
Sure, the raw numbers aren't useful, but the percentages are. There's no argument to be made that one region will have a larger playerbase return to Classic than another.
---
But it sounds like we agree. There cannot be individual language realms, there cannot be regional realms for Oceania, Latin America, or Brazil. And there definitely cannot be RP-PVP realms.
---
Hey! I'm not the OP of the art, but you could try messaging /u/Zydeq to see if thats possible!
---
I played Horde. For me it was night and day compared to Lightninghoof. Perhaps it has changed since then.
---
Yeah, you like getting in hour-long queues for mobs and waiting for quest items to spawn? Wtf is wrong with people these days, MUH NOSTALGIA I guess.
---
I don't THINK it was supposed to either, but this is definitely in the land of hazy for me. However, SoR procs are definetly triggering all kinds of effects on private servers. Much of the paladin dps research there has been built around using SoR procs + some pretty crazy weapon proc spell damage scaling coefficients to push higher numbers than one could get with pure attack power and Seal of Casino.
---
My friends and I plan to have all of us together at a house the first couple days to level up together and hangout. After it’ll probably be just be 2 of us together cause we have similar work schedules and it never works out waiting for everyone.
---
Weird how the game itself does not even follow their own RP rules lol, and the rules directly contradict the other rules they have...
---
&gt;Names that reference well known people, characters, brands, places, or icons (For example: Britneyspears, Austinpowers, Mcdonalds, Georgewashington, Newyork) 
---
The amount of references to all of those things is quite astounding...
---
* This bars any name shared by well know people in the medieval era, so every name in the medieval era, or fantasy medieval era
---
&gt;Non-medieval or non-fantasy names (For example: Slipnslide, Robotman, Technotron) 
---
In a world where the prefix mech, is used quite often...
---
* This bars any name that is not from the medieval era, or the fantasy medieval era, so at this point every name is against the rules no?
---
KING'S HONOR, FRIEND.
---
3 hours on 4 days a week. Filthy casuals
---
John stats said they made AQ so big that they had to cut it.
---
Every spec has maybe 5 core abilities and some cooldowns with very few if any overlapping abilities. Regardless of what you are playing, you usually have a couple builder abilities that lead to a big spender move or a proc of some sort.
---
 It's easier to balance when there isn't an overlying class identity and many core abilities given to the class as a whole, which can lead to certain specs being less than optimal and some being overpowered.
---
&gt; Non-medieval or non-fantasy names (For example: Slipnslide, Robotman, Technotron)
---
\*Stares silently at Mechagon*
---
Well it’s objectively worse less than vendor price because it disappears on logout, so it’d be kind of pointless if they charged the same other than some weird convenience cases.
---
&gt; I expect insane queues and almost unplayable starting zones
---
And this is why we have Layering.
---
New minor bugs would result a better Vanilla experience, even for hardcore people.
---
That is a good thing for Classic.
---
Please, so not fix all little stupid bugs that do not affect too much the experience of WoW Vanilla.
---
Also, I hope that Blizzard will add a bit of content to the game. Maybe, even, another expansion that would be similar to TBC, but maybe without Dungeon Finder and Flying Mounts.
---
They already have the the tools in place to create new worlds easily. Low effort for VERY high impact on the number/longevity of a subscriber to WoW.
---
In the history of WoW, only 2 German servers with 1k online? Oh my... You didn’t play Vanilla at isn’t it? 
---
And the French server in your opinion so I can laugh a bit more?
---
I have Protanomaly type color blindness and all I really want is the ability to change red text to a color that looks less dull to me.
---
See this is why you need to have a maxxed out rogue on each faction, just so you can grief scumbags like this as much as physically possible.
---
Warlock.
---
I need to disagree, as an RPer who has had to deal with both a realm that had a thriving RP community and one that was on a basically dead server. RPers normally get laughed at if non RPers are around. It would really boost up the animosity and I know I'd end up re-rolling on RP-PVE server just so I wouldn't have to deal with the trolls.
---
I'd like to roll a druid (tanking if I can find a guild that will take me, healing otherwise) but I'm having trouble deciding on profs.
---
If I go Ench/Herb, I'd at least get a bit of coin from the side-gig on Herbalism. Enchanting is expensive and tedious to level, but the benefits to having good enchants later in the game seem very good to me. Plus [Smoking Heart of the Mountain](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=15596/smoking-heart-of-the-mountain).I had Ench on a character in vanilla and remember that hawking in cities was just part of the gig. It's not a big money-maker, but I still find it fun.
---
OTOH, I feel like if I go with Herb/Alch, it will be much more practical for both raiding and moneymaking later in the game. Then again, there are gonna be a ton of people selling pots on the AH.
---
If I go Mining/Eng, I will have a ton of fun in PvP (which is an occasional pursuit but not my main goal) and be able to sell extra ore/gems when I get them.
---
What do you all think would work best for a Druid roll?
---
If you get 120 ping to France from the US you have an amazing internet connection(or are getting extremely lucky)
---
I totally agree. I think the announcement that Classic was coming out in THREE MONTHS was a bit long. They shouldve announced it 1.5 months out. 
---
For the first few weeks everyone was hyped about Classic and it's all I could talk to my coworkers about. But now I'm just sad that I still have to wait TWO MONTHS for it. I feel burnt out already. 
---
Hopefully I'll get hyped back up about two weeks before it releases but right now it just feels like a hopelessly long wait....
---
This exact thing happened when Warlords released too...

---
In the beginning my SO and I played as prot/holy paladin(me) and hunter(she).  
---
We were pretty much unstoppable.  
---
Needed an off tank for elite quests or when we found ourself in a pickle? No problem.  
---
Needed an extra DPS in those late night dungs or elite quests? Sure bringht forth the cat!  
---
Dying was never an issue with heals, bubbles, feign death and the like. Nor was farming with mass pulls, concecration, volley, traps, multishot etcetra.  
---
End game I tanked and she DPSed.
---
There is a good chance I'll do all of the classic wow classes
---
&gt; will be able to push ahead after everyone logs for the night.
---
servers go up at 12 GMT, servers go down at 12:30 GMT.  Servers go up again at 6:00 GMT until prime time east coast comes around again.  Lots of people play week nights from 8-11pm, enough to make queues on larger servers in BFA.
---
The issue is a lot of individuals that would roleplay if they were on a pvp server even if it was only a small amount (as a roleplay I do not believe in constantly forcing people to RP it can be pretty intensive)
---
For example my community will not roll RP-PvE but will roll PvP and we will just do our own RP there.
---
Some of us that have returned to WoW after becoming RPers later for example and have had bad encounters when talking or interacting with RP-PvE WoW  groups and leaders enough that we would rather drive the interaction on a PvP server where if you show your prowess in PvP etc people generally won't care about you RPing and leave you to your own devices or maybe even come and give it a go.
---
Except 99.99% of players aren't new or completely committed, they are in between.
---
&gt;knowing the alternative is 6 hour ques
---
This is such fucking bullshit I don't know how you peddle it with a clear conscience.
---
Let's be real here.  You're a Blizzard-can-do-no-wrong fanboy afraid of the queue boogieman, with no concept of what Classic should be and no concept of how small changes can have wide-ranging effects.
---
But like you said, we've both made up our minds.  I'm just surprised you aren't advocating for LFG and flying mounts too.
---
My level 80 WORLK DK along with my first character (70 Warlock) were right there, looking at me :)
---
But, I decided to start a Gnome Monk, for fun. hehe. Game has change sooo much! Level 29 for 7 hours of playtime... Yeah, 7 Hours, not 70 hours, like in Vanilla. hahaha ;)
---
RRREEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
I remember the spider wing being *somewhat* easy, but Patchwerk being a bitch and a half.
---
His point has nothing to do with nostalgia. It’s that the launch, which will inevitably be a shit show, is going to be a unique experience nonetheless. A unique experience that you’ll share with your fiends, and that those kinds of experiences are the ones we remember most fondly.
---
I kinda expect it to be a shitshow even with layering. It will alleviate it some sure but.. It'll still be ridiculous is my guess.
---
    Ping statistics for 24.105.62.129:

    Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
---

---
Looks amazing and all, but... the staff in the icon is red... :/
---
You do realise RP-PvP servers aren't the ones known as ERP servers right.
---
Unfortunately no. I mean, you can definitely get a larger amount of RP players, but you can't enforce the rules of an RP server.
---
Yeah, I agree with this. I do hope too that they reconsider launching RP-PvP servers, I'd like to play an army role in a PvP guild, or join a racial PvP guild. RP-PvP really expands the realms of possibilities.
---
Unarmed is used for fist weapons, not useless at all.
---
This is the problem with classic for me though, we could never stay on similar levels, one person always surges ahead and you never really play together.
---
It's 0.1 of a second dude.
---
Hey thanks for all your help guys n gals, I have classic future slightly more figured out now.   Good day to you all.
---
Thanks! I understand now. Thanks for the fast reply!
---
Also row one fails to show the x2.5 for elite and the 40% group bonus, so anyone looking at these numbers who don't know about those (Like I didn't until you explained it) will likely be confused too.
---
Yeah, that's a good point, I hadn't consider it. It brings even more immersion in.
---
"D A P EE BB!"
---
I'll drink to that!
---
Why should they rhyme?
---
I live near the east coast is probably why. I'd imagine someone out in Oregon wouldn't have the same luck connecting to a Western European server
---
&gt; "What is wrong with you **adventurers**"
---
There you go.
---
I'm in Schengen and I get 204.
---
We generally hold up and wait for the rest of the group at each dungeon every 8~10 levels.
---
I've been in three MMO launches (Rift, GW2 and WAR) they were all shitstorms. They were all great. Fortunately, for me, I'm in the Eastern US so Classic launches for me at 6pm. I can play all evening.
---
I was in high school when wow firat came out. Now I work for myself, so needless to say, I haven't scheduled any clients for the 3 weeks after classic launches 👍
---
You mean the same ping NA players played with on private servers?
---
It's going to be a shitshow and it's going to suck. Just because it's going to be a unique experience doesn't mean it's going to be fun.
---
Not really the greatest, but I know tanaris pirate quest gives some cloth boots with 11 intellect and 8 spell dmg + healing. Southsea mojo boots I think they’re called. Not sure if the quest will be out on release though.
---
Yeah but fire mage is not really possible for MC and BWL raiding - so i will go frost
---
Suffering is part of the game. Getting too much good stuff makes the good stuff boring. A game needs to make you suffer and overcome bad situations or you will not even enjoy reaping the rewards. Going the easy way is.. well, easy, and it's the first thing people do, naturally, but this is why games suck nowadays. We need to break that habit and accept the rage of getting destroyed repeatedly by this annoying night elf rogue, the boredom of walking through desolace/tanaris for the 6th time, slooooooooooowly... to fully enjoy killing a night elf rogue and getting that sweet sweet carrot trinket.
---
I wish it was alphabetical though, by class xD
---
See but the problem here is that you are assuming that a tank is always qualified to make that kind of call--plenty of idiot tanks who think they're on top of the ball start snowballing and run way too far ahead without giving the healer a moment to drink, and then presume that they know the healer's options best. They just assume "yeah he'll be able to heal this pull with that much mana" over and over again, giving added stress to the healer, and eventually overextend the run and wipe which will add **much** more time to the run than simply waiting on the healer to mana would have.
---
What's so hard about just giving the healer another 10-15 seconds that add up to what, 5 minutes added max to the run? Not to mention it makes it a lot less stressful and chill of a run overall.
---
The things that surprise people absolutely boggle me. Of course the hype is coming down, that’s what happens with anything that gets people hype. You’ve over saturated yourself with content in attempt to sedate your excitement and it’s worked. It’s not a good thing or a bad thing or even an unexpected thing. It’s a thing that happened that warrants as much emotional response as the sun rising. Are you going to post about that too?
---
You'll be fine, the archaic spell batching windows got you covered.

I played on an RP-PvP server and loved doing things like that. If there was cross faction interaction I'd have a hell of a time figuring out new games to play with enemy players lol.
---
When I had nothing better to do I'd follow someone around for a while and see how they react, if they panicked right away and didn't stop when I kept following them, I'd kill them, but if they were lower level than me, I'd stay unmounted and only use unarmed. If I lost track of them I'd stop pursuing, if I caught them I sometimes used CC or poisons depending on their behaviour to prolong their death.
---
If they panicked very briefly, then quickly calmed down, I'd let them live, but continue following them as long as I felt like to keep them on their toes. If they didn't panic at all, or better yet, tried to fight me despite having no way to win, they were a warrior and I'd let them live, /salute, and go about my business.
---
Glad to see your answer :)
---
The idea of a dodge-based build seems interesting, and while you were correct about very low information about how effective it may be, I want to say : why not :) You could even add more parry, because counterattack is one of the most energy-efficient skill there is.
---
Something like that ?
---

m8 you cannot top Tales of the Past 2 and The Illegal Danish
---
Nice! Yeah ghouls in wpl are for sure solid
---
Yayy :D
---
&gt;I can't see the appeal of only international servers altogether. The decision is a lose - lose situation for the community.
---
Because Europe and every country in Europe is made up of a multitude of different people who all speak a number of languages and with different cultures and quirks. If you sequester the French and the Germans, the rest of us will forget what Ashenfale sounds like with a French accent and what a golden shower is. Meanwhile your servers are going to be a baguette circlejerk with no one to tell you you're being weird.
---
Being exposed to people who are different from you is considered a healthy thing that builds perspective in most European nations that don't dub everything on TV.
---
Heck even some of us across the language barrier of the EU would settle for a mixed language RP-PvP server if that was the cost for us to get it.
---
As one of the 3 founders of a pretty big guild intending to roll RP-PvP with a surprising number of more active/proactive roleplayers. It would rather take our community to a RP-PvP server than a PvP server and drive roleplay on there where other players would possibly get frustrated by it.
---
#WillSettleForMixedLanguageRP-PvP-EU-Server
---
theres literally an undead paladin boss in naxxramas
---
His bug video is of him meleeing one target and shooting another.
---
I would keep low level weapons and armor/costume to fight lowbies. Nothing like being dressed as a lumberjack with a level 10 white quality axe and chasing gnomes.
---
So, I got them both as puppies. At first I only wanted 1, but then I wanted 2 (he needs a buddy right?) So they are exactly a year apart in age, turned 1 and 2 respectively in may. So when I get home, I usually let them out for bathroom, feed them, either let them play/wall them, make my dinner, let them play a little more, crate younger pup, play games for 1-2 hours (older one snuggles at a dog bed at my feet), take the younger one out and give them a short potty walk, let them chill for another hour or so, and bed time. Although I usually stay up a bit still. 
---
I can trust the older one for the most part. Little guy still occasionally poops in the house, so his crate turning has been a little longer than I would've liked.
---
Join a guild
---
Maelstrom was my first server I played on. It was an Rp-pvp server  and I have the best memories playing on it.
---
el thuzad?
---
Oh look its this guy again, for some reason he's posting in a sub of a game he hates. Makes perfect sense.
---
Hehe I don't mind being around them, that sounds fun! I'mma "role play" as a ganker.
---
I want to see EU fight for what server gets what language WW3 style.  Has to happen sooner or later.
---
Broo we have one person in our friend group that wants to go pally, everyone else wants horde , but they all seem to be bowing to him :(

I think it was just the artist that left it there and they must not have thought too much of it

TOS.
---
When did you play there? I was there for most of MoP and there were RPers all over the place. They tended to be out in the world rather than in major cities, though.
---
Forum populations aren't really a big factor a huge number of people won't read reddit or be on discord or other media.
---
If you haven't realised that then I'm a bit mythed.
---
Iss me, down by the moonlit shore.
---
I have found that to garner more success I need to take charge of groups. So I usually play healer or tank. That way I control at least 1 of the 3 important jobs (heals, tank, cc) in a 5 man. Then I pad the group with non loot competition classes with the appropriate cc. Most pug rogues are low dps morons so I tend to overlook their 'invite plz's. They also tend to stealth towards mobs pre-pull and do other stupid shit that makes the tank's job harder. Same goes for hunters.  Never underestimate other players' stupidity and laziness. Warlock in group? Congrats, now none of the other 3 douche-canoes are going to run to the instance. Just do yourself a favor and bring 2 mages and a lock or shadow priest for dps. (shadowpriest are always welcome in my groups, I've found them to be of a higher skill level than the average player)  Melee dps in greens are a waste of space and tend to be comprised of the lowest skill players.
---
I realize that all sounds harsh but thats just my experience from vanilla. If I don't take charge shit doesn't go smoothly so I employ a doctrine of discrimination.
---
I was SOOO prepared that in the end that OP tells the guy in game, that he’s also a guy, and OP just used the guy for gold
---
Suffering is not what makes games fun though, it's challenge. Waiting endlessly for mobs to spawn or walking through Desolace for hours is not challenging or fun... it's just boring.
---
Now I'm not saying Classic is not challenging, but the things you mentioned are definitely not the reasons why most people enjoy Classic.
---
&gt;International servers bother me quite a bit. We'll have inofficial ones anyway, you're just adding 20-30% confused players who'll have a hard time finding people who speak their language.
---
You are describing the reality of anyone in Europe that doesn't want to play WoW while speaking French/German/Spanish/Italian though. This problem is going to happen regardless as it always has, you were just privileged enough to be in the cool-language-club.
---
Penny Arcade covered what happens when you dont have an alt:
---
https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/12/31/a-being-of-indescribable-power
---
'04...i'm old
---
Paladins. Are. Support. Characters.
---
I loved the shit out of dark souls 1. I beat that one finally after some struggles.
---
I bought 2 and 3, and only played 3 some but damn that one is hard. I can't stay motivated to keep playing it lol.
---
They don't have to, but OP mentioned it.
---
Wow. Is. A. Game.
---
Enjoy. Getting. Farmed.
---
When sending a large amount of gold to your bank alt, you might be afraid of entering the wrong character name and losing all your gold.
---
Instead, on your bank alt, send a junk item COD to your main.  Then, if you enter the wrong character name, the worst that can happen is the other guy accidentally sends you some free gold.  (You should give it back though.)
---
you're talking about vanilla wow pve, the only stress is the grind, shortening that grind with good efficiency means less time grinding, i think waiting around for everyone to drink while you don't have to is more stressful that making good use of your time
---
I'm doing this run right now and i can tell you that the cooking quest and elixers quest both only grant 100 rep at level 8.
---
Or you just get into a layer where someone else already farmed all thorium and you are stucked for 15 min getting nothing. More layers also means more players so more people farming your stuff. You should stop judging about something you never saw in reality in its final version.
---
"partially fused with infinite" haha. Perfect.
---
You don't know anything about me.
---
If I get ganked by StabzYa im going to scream.
---
When did you play? Roleplay on Emerald Dream unfortunately became more and more limited to guilds as time went on and more non-roleplayers moved to it because they heard of the World PvP. 
---
From what I remember, I saw and joined a lot of roleplay in the open world in WotLK which is as early as I started playing on ED, but I think some people considered it on the decline even then. Quit during Cata and the last I played was during MoP, by then I don't remember there being many (visible) roleplayers left.
---
It's straight up just Agamand Mills
---
I don't condone ninja looting of course. It is just something that was always in the fabric of vanilla social interaction. A streamer doing it isn't any better or worse than some random dick back in the day, so I don't see a reason to focus on it.
---
The only expansions I remember being smooth were MoP and BFA
---
What you on about mate - we don't agree rather i've argued heavily against your type of individual that claim "Stats" which they literally have no other factors than current player numbers to be the correct answer.
---
There are a huge number of factors for why RP-PvP servers are generally smaller which sort of makes it hard to compare and get a valid or understandable reasoning - They were introduced later in the lifespan after RP-PvE servers had become established which leads to less global knowledge of the server as well as the initial drive.
---
It is well know that people generally choose the first thing in their list. Blizzard haven't given us the reasoning for their choice to avoid individual languages, there could be numerous factors for this.
---
You have tunnel visioned yourself into believing that there might only be a handful of servers. Likewise Blizzard might be suffering from the same sort of issue, neglecting that if the server size after phase 2 is a max of 3k and their concurrent players are higher than 20k come phase 2 and if they have only 5 servers then they are stuffed.
---
Perhaps with sharding that made it hard to find them :(
---
I feel blessed for that being the case.
---
1g port is the minimum.  The rune alone cost the mage 38s.  Every now and then I had people tip 2g though
---
I might be remembering wrong but Cata felt pretty smooth. I didn’t play WotLK at launch, came in about a month later.
---
Not to burst your bubble, but as the other commenter said, shadow priests really don’t do great dps in raids. They’re brought to buff the warlocks (you will legit only out-dps tanks assuming no1 dies early and the other dps know their rotation). Also, Anathema/Benedition most likely won’t be in until p2/p3 as they were added in patch 1.4 (or 1.5 I don’t remember). If that’s your plan, then by all means go for it, just don’t expect to get anathema early on.
---
You are not even a good troll.
---
You're missing out tbh, I'm a very important person.
---
&gt;&gt; You'll get the server list on August 12th 3PM PST.
---
&gt;&gt;  It's silly to speculate anything else since we know they'll have to release realm names by this time.
---
Dude doesn’t want to be wrong
---
Ah, this is a thing I never understood with Classic. Why do people fish for pvp kills? This guy keeps saying he's too greedy, but he won't get ANYTHING from the kill. Just honor, which isn't even a currency and is literally a useless number hidden somewhere in your character stats. What's the point? Can you convert honor somewhere, somehow? Am I missing something? I understand the appeal of PVP, don't get me wrong, but are there any rewards?
---
...i don't know think sobbing over a video game is something to be proud of.
---
During the last vanilla launch, which had national servers, I ended up on the Polish one. Rerolled on one that legit merged into the russian serverpool when that was added in wrath because it was so overwhelmingly russian. Your solution does absolutely nothing to prevent this.
---
I'm not saying that gold per kill depends on the amount of kills. I actually stated the opposite. 
---
We seem to be talking about different things. If you are trying to maximize your gold earned over a long period of time, then GPH is all that matters, yes.
---
If your objective is not to maximize your total gold, but rather, to make a certain amount of gold within a window of time - let's say, 100g for riding at 40 - then you don't necessarily go after the highest GPH. You want to be able to reliably make the money that you need before it becomes irrelevant, or in this case, before you're 50 and you've spent the last ten levels without a mount.
---
He is trying to get his petition to 1500. It doesn't mean it's all redditors.
---
I mentioned that because I remember for the longest time the devs wanted to add it but was messing with their code.
---
As a druid tank Ill be going herb and skinning. Once closer to 60, Ill farm all the leather I plan on using for crafted gear, so I don't need to buy it later. Store it all in the bank, then Ill drop skinning for enchanting, craft SHotM, then drop enchanting for either skinning again, or alchemy, not 100% sure on which, but leaning towards alch
---
You also get stuck in places other races don't too, I'm not sure if it's the jump height or what but i was watching perplexity play WSG and he got stuck chasing a druid who was able to wall jump when the gnome couldn't in the same exact spot
---
I don't play wow to be efficient, I play to have fun. And I really have some of the most fun running dungeons. It's not super efficient but I think it's a great way to get some xp if you are caught in the leveling Zerg. I almost always get something out of it. And for warriors blue gear is very helpful early on.
---
40+ people disagree mate
---
Verify to that.  Even logging into the 500k+ pop realms would have almost unplayable lag the first week during prime time hours.
---
You have revealed too many secrets. The Goldfarm Mafia will be paying you a visit shortly.
---
Yeah, that's kinda what I was thinking, what would your 2nd and 3rd choice be? Gonna have a few friends playing and I know everyone is at least considering mage lol
---
It is you
---
the gnomes having mech in their name isn't medieval, but it's absolutely within the fantasy realm of a race that has mechanical leanings.  Naming a gnome mech-something is within RP.  Naming a Tauren MechaStreisand would not be.
---
Flavor NPCs like Harris Pilton are easter eggs built into the game, not player names.
---
Well then don't assume shit.
---
Why are you more entitled to a specific name than anyone else?
---
I mean, I wish you luck in your petition, but why not just /pvp flag if you want to pvp in the open world? Based on the description it sounded like the world pvp would be in the vein of RP anyways, so why not allow people to flag as needed to take part instead of forcing a whole realm?  
---
Again before people get their pitchforks, I hope you guys get the RP-PvP realm you want, just curious why an RP-PvE realm is a deal breaker when you can simply flag as needed?
---
many people do not realize how deep this game is.  I am in my mid-50's and it really surprised me how well I took to the Souls series.  
---
You go through the game and at first it's hard.  Then after some time you just get better.  There is many levels of "better".   So then you play through and the experuience of beating it is just to much more than other games.
---
Then you start another character and do another class.   Then all of a sudden you are playing through multiple times becasue there is so many secrets and gear to get.  Then you gget into invading others games and of course helping others through their games.  There are games within games,  the game itself has some levels. Then you try builds.  You try PvP.   You hone your classes,  you go for all the achievements. Multiple NG's as well if you like.
---
I saw one guy on Steam who invaded me at 4400 hours,  I thought my 2800 was outlandish.  This game has many layers,  it's deep.  The mechanics of everything is just so well tuned.  Many directions to go,  all up to the player.  Best game ever.
---
But that isn’t what is written, you take the rules at face value not an interpretation.
---
Not an assumption, just post history. These are facts big boy.
---
Its ok everyone has there own opinion. I just hope i can take the community that me and my colleagues have worked on for the last few years to where we always had hoped that was RP-PvP.
---
We have tried to maintain and act far nicer than those that have a crying fit when a bug is in the beta etc by acting more like rational adults and haven't really found any sort of communication.
---
This is why us actually having at least developed a reputation in the community as well as having a presence in the moderating or founding of key websites and discords.
---
Like any server though its all down to the community that comes to a server and each is unique the type of the server just directs its initial focus and is then left to guilds and individuals.
---
I know if we roll PvP because Blizzard decide to neglect RP-PvP, I will be promoting RP on the PvP server as another event for players to do. If we roll RP-PvP I will spend my time focusing on covering and growing the weaker aspects of the server and preventing ERP from occuring in areas where minor's/children or new players are likely to be.
---
I am not mad enough to think i can crush it entirely. So you have to at least give a small section of the populace somewhere to go rather than persecuting them.
---
Look at that FPS man :D
---
Ahh just like vanilla
---
it's actually hilarious how pathetic these people are for being so fucking obsessed with a video game. "i cried" "can't wait to spend years doing nothing because classic has .5 contents but whatever because STANDING AROUND IN A CAPITAL CITY IN VANILLA WAS SOOOO MUCH BETTER THAN IT IS NOW"
---
Yeah. Theres no official record of it, but apparently Blizz stealth buffed reputation gains in the TBC pre-patch. Classic values are significantly lower than anticipated. I did some testing during the stress test and it's pretty bad. Pretty much changed my mind on rolling Alliance in Classic haha.
---
Not gonna lie, i'm ready for the shit show that is stranglethorn :p
---
It's a pretty big time investment difference though. Most bank alts are lvl 5 for disenchant.
---
* Getting a rogue to 10 is only 5 extra levels.
---
* Getting a hunter to 21 is 16 extra levels (for 2/2 Pathfinder) and the higher levels take exponentially longer.
---
Is time spent advertising and traveling (if they meet you) taken into account? I've never seen an enchanter with an hour long line.
---
MoP was only smooth if you consider getting stuck on the first quest for hours smooth.
---
Forget that, it's full steam ahead baby! Every level above them I get will increase the ABBAB exponentially. Always be berating and belittling!
---
It's actually pretty pathetic how many people say they cried or something, and reminded me how full of nerds/weebs the classic community is.
---
This video gets you level 5, and to the under city mailbox in under 30 minutes.
---
You will strategically die at spiders(preferably with sams remains in hand, i forgot but it was fine).
---
You will strategically die at stillwater lake to get to brill.
---
I mean its not the only thing the RP-PvP community have been doing we have been operating things in the background for ages.
---
The issue is becoming more apparent to us unless we act like wild animals then it seems blizzard will just ignore us. After all its what seems to get other issue groups noticed for some reason.
---
or i just geto a layer where noone farmed all the thorium and i get twice or 3x as much as i would normaly get. there wont be many players at 60 one week after release so the chances of anyone having picked the thorium are verry slim. the problem is that the system can be abused and the change is not changing that
---
Advertising, no. And if I find them, travel time doesn't count either.
---
I know that you aren’t a good person. Some might say, horrible.
---
Btw you might as well recommend hunters to become level 21 for 2/2 Pathfinding for 6% extra speed. https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19560/pathfinding
---
I have the same dilemma as you. Enchanting is a must have for the trinket but I hate leveling enchanting and it could be particularly tough on a fresh server. So there are two options I am considering to deal with this.   
---
Option 1 would be to just level with skinning and herb / mining for as much passive income while leveling as possible and then using that money at 60 to level enchanting for the trinket and then dropping that for either LW, Eng, or Alchemy. 
---
Option 2 would be to level skinning and enchanting while leveling and having tailoring and LW on an alt. I would send cloth and skins from my druid over to the alt who would then make greens for my druid to DE. This option sounds good because I can also make myself both tanking gear from LW and healing gear from tailoring and will still provide extra income.
---
Well maybe I should dig through your post history and make some kind of stupid assumption about what you may or may not like? Dumb kid.
---
Don't play it then?
---
You're being too theoretical. I understand that you're not ultimately forfeiting XP in the long run, but you still need to acquire XP to progress. If you decide to hold off delivering or just straight up not doing quests before they are lower level then you need to fill that temporary "void" of XP somehow.
---
I can't think of an easy way to explain it atm, and I can't be bothered to make charts etc, but there's an aspect of the practical implications of this you're not getting. It's not as simple as "they'll get the same amount of XP in the end".
---
That would be a really dumb way to do things since the layers have to share data with one another CONSTANTLY. Every time someone joins a group their info (literally everything about their character) gets sent over, not to mention layer collapsing.
---
They should, and likely are, on the same server to avoid these additional requests that really add up with a large amount of players. In which case, having 100k people join 1 server or 10k people join 10 layers doesn't make a difference at all.
---
This is not Classic WoW.
---
I reckon alot of new people will pick Alliance because it is prettier visually, also I think Horde will have alot more of «twitch.tv language» because of the many streamers being Horde.
---
Because sadly polish is gonna be a tiny minority, so the best solution for low-pop languages is to pick an english server, since it's the easiest language to deal with...
---
Just having fun bro relax! Haha XD just having some fun bud, take it easy there pal, just having fun.
---
She’s a horde at heart, I played ally in vanilla so We are gonna roll horde for sure.  You are very right though.  Those do look the best imo.
---
First things first, break up with your dog and put your wife up for adoption.
---
So just because I don't like the clusterfuck at launch I shouldn't play the game at all? Are you stupid?
---
Its not just the open world pvp but rather the air that it brings - you encounter a horde or alliance individual in trouble and you play your character well you look at their race and go my character would do x.
---
So I could choose to come to a "hostile" players aid and help them while not using AoE's.
---
Many of us feel that RP-PvP brings a different aspect to the community where you can grow yourselves in all directions. While not having to do the RP-PvE thing of putting your flag on and hoping someone doesn't take advantage to attack you with advantage.
---
In a few comments to others i've explained it in more detail.
---
This is extremely cool. I love how crisp it is, too! I'll have to check out your insta. :D
---
I like the way you think! There are so many monumental  structures that are simply enormous and unused.
---
Is there really a rush to get a bank alt?
---
I agree - just saying that it sucks and I know the pain.
---
Pretty sure that whole guild got banned for removing things from files to access cthuns room from the first boss.
---
One of the hunters in my vanilla guild was the son of some officers, and was allowed along on raids despite several issues. His bow would break on every. Single. Hunter call. Like clockwork you’d hear him mutter, “fuck” over vent, then see him running in to melee with the rogues. I don’t think he ever went a single Nef night without breaking his bow at least once. Oh, memories.
---
What a incredible nerf to hunters. GG
---
Fair enough, well said. Best of luck in getting Blizz to hear your side of things!
---
If your a guild banker, have a alt in each city or neutral AH location.
---
I'm having fun trolling the idiots in this sub, yes. That's what I was referring to.
---
No, but like I said, I don't plan on no lifing the game so when I hit 30-40 there will be a ton of 60s around. I want to take my time and relive the world without doing a mad dash to the endgame.
---
US players did on nearly every pserver
---
In Warcraft 2 the Elven Archer would say "For the Alliance." Whereas no horde unit until Warcraft 3 says "For the Horde."
---
The Horde is copying an Alliance battlecry, sorry.
---
alliance
---
Your best bet will be the Shaman Ele/Resto spec that allows you to heal competently in raids and still do some good damage in pvp
---
Have you ever though to yourself that maybe...you're the idiot?
---
Commit to finishing DS3 ,  you will not regret it!
---
Getting a level 5 bank alt can he boring, here is a efficient way to do it quickly to get you back on that grind to level 60. Level 5 let's you have a alt with enchanting
---
Not really, but if you're rushing anything else on main you want distractions handled fast.
---
Also it's fun to speed run random shit anyway.
---
Wow, thank you. I never thought about it like that. Everything makes sense now!
---
Yea an issue we are starting to run into now is if we actually start calling in bigger favours or start pulling out cards like we run X and Y etc.
---
We don't want to be seen as arseholes, we like to help improve the community and give people choice.
---
I was just offering an option. Cool it tough guy.
---
I mean I yell that every time I cast that spell on my shaman now.
---
Yeah, that's the issue for the launch
---
The zerg will Make mob farming hell
---
#nochanges, except for not having regional and rppvp servers
---
yeah i just ended my apprenticeship and he let me work after that for 4days fulltime. 
---
on the last day he just told me that as my apprenticeship ended i will be to expensive for him, so he needs to let me go. like "wtf dude"
---
I live in Northern California and the looting was laggy for me. My server ping was about 20ms
---
Im gonna enjoy reading the QQ posts on here while at work.
---
Reading through old threads and you had a good question that no one answered.  
---
Farm BGs while you level. Get that reputation maxed, because that Rep will allow you to buy the best PvP gear from the factions
---
This is my pvp video I made in vanilla... watching this always puts a smile on my face because how bad it is, and how bad I was.  Has a pretty epic moment at 3:50 though.
---
Seal of righteousness is a spell that targets the caster.  The effect is additional damage on melee attacks.  The damage from SoR is neither an attack nor a spell.
---
Seal of the crusader is a bit trickier.  Even though it says it's additional damage, it is treated as an extra attack.  Wording of abilities in vanilla was very inconsistent.  Improved accuracy in spell descriptions and consistency in wording is a change I could get behind.
---
Come at me bro.
---
God i loved that album
---
I spun around in the giant figure 8 helicopter mash for what felt like foreVER at MoP's launch. :')
---
On private servers I would always carry a stack of rune of portals, regardless of class. Maybe this sounds stingy but I’d ask mages If it’s cool if I toss them a rune for a port. Surprisingly, as long as I went to their location they usually didn’t mind doing this.
---
I'm not sure I follow you. Start calling in favours (Fellow Canadian?) for asking for an RP-PvP realm? or in regards to the question about unwritten rules to not grief?
---
do we know how many servers there will be?
---
You'll need a lot more than 1500, but have my vote
---
Wait did i just make a random account in my sleep and write this post?   
---
You're basically me, same age, working on my masters degree, full time job. And quite hypeeed...
---
What's next, you're blond and don't drink?
---
Some of ur values just seem off. I’ve never seen stuff like bruiseweed, liferoot, stranglekelp go for 50s an herb. Where’d u get ur data from?
---
Alternatively, you can use this video to be outside orgrimmar level 5 in about the same amount of time.
---
This is so true it’s funny
---
Know what?   Blizzard said:   
---
&gt; There will be RP servers. 
---
   
---
They also said they may make RP-PVP servers later.
---
Seal of Righteousness "grants additional holy damage on each attack." What about that says anything about being a spell or an attack?
---
You make an attack that does 20 damage. Seal of righteousness adds 5 damage. You do 25 damage with 1 attack.
---
God damn you Europeans are always so fucking miserable lmao
---
Nobodies against you getting the servers you want buddy, stop being a dickhead.
---
Don't feel bad! Patchwork was one of the guild shattering bosses in vanilla.
---
Just playing on a private server it really reminded me of how long the corpse runs are. When I die due to me taking on a large group or hard elite I know I messed up and was punished for it. Getting 1 shot while picking a flower then running back doesn't make me feel like I made a mistake and can learn from it, it just reminds me that people put there enjoy making lower level players frustrated. Now I am spending 10 minutes of my 1 hour session auto walking to my corpse. And if he does it again immediately? I will just spirit Rez and logout for the day.
---
Haha I know! I love the series, just with work and trying to cram all these games in before wow is so much pressure!
---
I gotta beat FF15, witcher 3, resident evil 4, they are billions, darkest dungeon, and I just got whitelisted on a good DayZ server, my favorite game Escape From Tarkov is getting a massive update sometime soon, and on top of this I play a lot of flight sims which are basically like school with all the studying you need to do with those lol...
---
It's too much! That's only some of the games I'm trying to keep up with right now.
---
I looked it up and the languages[ that have servers are among the most spoken ones](https://www.babbel.com/en/magazine/most-spoken-languages-europe/) - they're also all languages that are spoken in more than 1 country, making up a decent chunk of WoW's population I reckon.
---
Call it privilege or whatever you like, there's no advantages to splitting your playerbase on a singular server even more than necessary; hosting servers for some of the more spoken languages makes sense for multiple reasons that have been stated by me and many others in this chat, and you *could* (and probably should) expand on that - then again #nochanges is big so what do I know -  instead of pointing at the countries that are left out and talk about some sort of "cool-language-club" as if making it fair but worse made it better for anyone involved. It doesn't.
---
My 5cts regarding that.
---
Fair enough
---
Because of the title and rewards. The pvp blues you can get are pretty good and epic pvp is very good. Also it’s a war and most people when they see an enemy they want to fight them. World of WARcraft not World of friendcraft.
---
Mushrooms for Druids.
---
TStorm for shaman.
---
Cloth healing isn’t too expensive on the auction house, but especially leather (and mail and plate if it exists too, idk) is on the table if you’re a paladin, and that shit is DIRT cheap.
---
The shit talk between u/Phenotyx and yourself is why I enjoy PvP drama.
---
10% is my rule of thumb for anything I flip or craft, or post at material cost + 17% on the AH so my final margin is 10% after the AH takes its cut.
---
THIS WAIT IS KILLING ME
---
Lol just think its funny you're calling people idiots and children because you're baiting them into responding about something they enjoy, so of course they're going to defend it. What a expert troller you are, very adult and mature.
---
Iss me, Mario. 
---
...er.....
---
I only counted two Hunters? (I only recognize the t2 set)
---
Yeah... that was a wild ride for sure. I hope he's ok
---
I'm hoping they'll get server names out at least a few days before they open name reservations, to help guilds and players/friends coordinate where to roll when name reservations and character creation open up. :) If not, it'll be pretty disappointing; there are names I really want to try to get, so ideally I won't have to hem and haw over what realm to roll on when it opens up.
---
But also I really just want to know what names they chose. :')
---
You have to watch out for those dick mages.  Cock magic can be some scary stuff.
---
Literally nothing new here, this has already been talked about 1 trillion times by cancerous classic wow youtubers.
---
I subed. Got beta. Sube xpired. Beta continued. Score.
---
Hunters are doomed, go rogue. Trust me. Leeway, scatter-trap DR, and the laundry list of bugs are so gamebreaking that even the best hunters are rerolling.
---
Spell reflect and intercept were amazing.
---
🤣
---
I'd love to get Ion's quote's source if you happen to have it. Even still, you're claiming they're coming later when he said they **may** come. It's like saying Classic is going to get 1.13 and future content patches because (and this is true) one member of the team said its not impossible.
---
If you dungeon farm for xp, you'll be decked out from 20-60 as well though. So it's not really valid to say that it was quick for them due to BiS, but ignore that that will generally be the case for everyone else as well.
---
That's what I'm thinking, let them windfury everything while you rank 1 frost shock mobs.
---
Never claimed to be adult or mature. However, if people get baited by these stupid threads it's their own fault. Anyone with half a brain would instantly realize it's a troll.
---
If someone would mark which is which, I could do that
---
As someone who doesn't RP, but still loves the RP-PVP community to death, please Blizzard, please put in an RP-PVP server.
---
Thanks, I hate it
---
I want to bite it
---
I’d like to have that as well
---
Would have loved to this, HUGE class fantasy right here
---
Haha those movements xD I know what you mean though! I leveled an alt rogue with a friend and he shot us a pvp video. It was terrible, but felt awesome to watch all the same. Wish i still had it, and envy you yours. See you in classic!
---
Shadow Hold with a bonus instance at the end.  I would like to see Shadow Hold at Jaedenar in Felwood, which is currently outdoors, instanced and tuned for 5 man, then at the end there is a bonus instance you can enter if you complete X bonus objectives called Shadow Hold Grotto.   Each boss gains power from an extra large corrupted plant normally found in the over-world of Felwood.  
---
Normal Mode: You don't cleanse the corrupted plants and complete the dungeon normally.
---
Grotto Run: You cleanse the plants before fighting each boss using Cenarion Plant Salve and a number of each of the smaller cleansed plants, taking the corruption onto yourselves in the form of a debuff, and "Enraging" the boss adding a buff to the boss i.e. "Wrath of the Songflower" or a new mechanic to the fight perhaps.  Since you cant loot song flowers, it just takes salve to cleanse.  When you kill each boss the corruption on you and the flowers is lifted and you loot the flowers to remove your debuff, get some increased loot off cleansed flowers like you would from cleansing them normally and get a buff like:
---
"Bounty of the Songflower: Songflower Serenade's effects are doubled"(Getting this give you the normal buff as well)  
---
"Bounty of the Windblossom: Windblossom Berries now restore health and mana in half the time and are usable in combat"  (Perhaps add some sort of gauntlet type encounter to make use of this)
---
"Bounty of the Whipper Root: Whipper Root Tuber's healing effects are doubled and siphon life from nearby enemies." (Feeds into a gauntlet type encounter as well.) 
---
"Bounty of the Night Dragon: Not really sure what this one should be, maybe just a chance to proc night dragons breath when struck in combat(heals some health and mana) something for a tank? I dunno. 
---
Cleanse all four plants to get the 4 buffs for each flower.  Reach the entrance to the Grotto with all 4 buffs and you can enter it.  I would think the Grotto is just kind of a treasure room of sorts, with an assortment of high level herb and ore nodes, replacement salve for completing the dungeon, treasures to loot and gold the satyr had stockpiled, something along those lines. 
---
This is a VERY loose idea but I've always enjoyed DM:Tribute runs and this is just something that falls in line with that.
---
It's nice to have a written guide so I don't have to deal with the 30 second intros, slow talking, and suspiciously just over 10 minute timer.
---
Option 2 sounds excellent, frankly. I'm hoping to have a clothie alt, so that could be some good synergy.
---
Thanks for looking it over and giving some thought to this... I'm actually a little irritated at how much of my brainpower this is eating.
---
RP folks are better than reddit trolls
---
Yeah I rarely if ever actually participate in rp, but I love being around others who do. Just makes the game feel more alive to me
---
I'll translate and link to this post for our guild, this is awesome. Thanks a ton for this!
---
Legion had a pretty smooth launch as well. There wasn't even a server reset or any of that - right at midnight, a quest popped up for Khadgar and everyone started their artifact quest line.
---
I dabbled on pserver just to get reassociated with the basics, but otherwise I'm still ready for classic.
---
This is great advice, it will save you a ton of interruptions. No boss calling because your late. No girlfriend threatening to break up with you. Just solid advice.
---
Yeah. There may be some skillups/drops/reskills. Alch was a solid prof, and usually made some decent cash. GL with your druid!
---
Very common trick on bg9 back in vanilla as well. Obligatory ret pally LULW.
---
Mi gusta.
---
Please hear our cries Blizzard. Just one RP-PVP server &lt;3
---
&gt;Except you want to sell items through the chat. In this case, IF/Org is first choice.
---
Unlike in original Classic, Stormwind was the de facto capital on private servers. I expect this will remain true on Classic as well.
---
If you look at party frames there's about 5
---
I just don't think that temporary void exists. Prior to 20, I am leaving entire zones on the table. I get to 20, by skipping entire 5 level sections of zones (usually loch modan).
---
From 20 onwards, not only are you not skipping any quests, but you are coming in with more total quest experience. 
---
sure, grinding may be necessary (to be honest, I run so many dungeons and spend so much time in groups, I just don't know what the post 20 solo landscape is even like, in terms of how much grinding is needed), but I don't see how doing quests of lower levels requires any more grinding. In fact, it requires less.
---
As a shadow priest I loved having vampiric touch.  A DoT that regens mana for your whole party?! It was so nice feeling wanted lol
---
All the blizzard fail posts are gonna be good.
---
I had fun making the video for sure. Trying to do it quickly would be way betting than pacing through it slowly.
---
Shadowstep, typhoon, tree form, the warrior pounce.
---
The wording for spells in vanilla is ass. I had a similar question about Seal of Command a few weeks ago because I just wasn't sure if an extra attack was really what was meant to happen due to how badly worded the description is. The confusion behind these seals is totally understandable, hopefully someone on the team can clarify their intended outcomes.
---
That... was not really my point/question. I like battlegrounds and world pvp, I was just asking if there were any rewards because I keep seeing stuff like that. This dude talks about greed when there's literally nothing to be gained from it, from what I understand.. Now you just mentioned pvp blues and purples and that makes me even more curious. How is there pvp gear when you don't get any kind of currency from pvp? How does that work? You dont drop those off player corpses. Whut?
---
Keep in mind that she will be missing the toes of her shoes and fingers from her gloves, as well as knees from her pants if she goes this route.

As a dwarf player I just say "fuck those guys!"
---
Aww, they sound like good dogs. I'm sure the younger one will get the hang of it soon! It's also good they have each other for when you're not around; I think it helps a lot sometimes. I miss having a dog, but I just can't have one with the amount of cats I have right now. Maybe in a decade. :') 
---
Pet the puppers for me when you get home, will you? :D
---
They can solo it without engineering
---
You mean Intervene? Intercept was in vanilla.
---
Im the other way around. I love leveling and straight out grinding the same mobs for a couple of hours. At 60 though I tend to get bored quick.
---
I liked misdirection on my hunter. Had a lot of fun tagging my buddy in dungeons and surprise pulling onto him
---
Been there a while, Stress Test 2
---
Classic wow is an mmorpg, modern wow is an mmo action/adventure game dressed in rpg clothes.
---
&gt;I kinda expect it to be a shitshow even with layering.
---
I don't know how many people fit in 1 layer, but if its even 1000, you could just assume 500 on horde, 500 on alliance, which would be around ~150-200 people in each starter zone.
---
150-200 players is a **LOT**... unless they shard it to be much smaller (not saying they should or shouldn't).
---
That's in Vanilla.  It's health not mana regen.
---
My enthusiasm is diminished, yeah. On the other hand, vanilla is like an old jacket I've worn for years; part of the reason why it's comfortable is because it's familiar.  
---
I'm also looking forward to seeing small differences in how the server plays out. For instance, on private servers, especially the servers with accelerated xp rates, the rate of player-attrition for raiding guilds was quite high. You might lose \~3 people every month, which made it significantly harder to progress into naxx.
---
Thats 100% true. But I bet the pallies that suck it up and heal, even if it's only for raid nights, will get first dibs over the ones dedicated to playing ret. Just for being more helpful.
---
Favours in regards to people we know or reputations we have built up.
---
We have already asked and been on podcasts etc but we want to avoid being as aggressive as we could be.
---
I forgot about that leap!
---
You can multi-box. With one PC, but you need multiple singular accounts. That means if you want to box 2 toons, you are paying 2 subscriptions. And any additional is another sub you need to pay.
---
You cannot box off of one account, simply because as soon as on as you log in from one client, you are kicked from the other.
---
This is not against the TOS. Blizzard allows multi boxing **so long as your commands are not automated**. That would then fall into botting, which is against the TOS.
---
The most popular multi boxing software is [IsBoxer](http://isboxer.com/). Even if you dont use it, it has a lot of knowledge about getting into multi boxong.
---
F R O Z E N  W R A T H
---
Why is priest preferable to Paladin healbot? I would think the buffs, blessing of freedom for PvP, etc would outweigh the priest, as shields aren't insanely useful with a warrior cause it'll mess up their rage generation
---
Yeah, the kurzen camp caves are really good for grinding as alliance.  Horde have no reason to go in there except to kill people, and even then, I've never seen them go inside, just to the camp itself.
---
IIRC its preraid bis for warrior. Even if it isnt, it is an extremely good warrior weapon
---
High effort high return. Low effort low return class/spec for sure. A high end player as you mentioned, an example being Drakova on YouTube. Very informative info on pally
---
Don't they need to blow open a door?
---
AP is AP
---
Yes it was intentional, so it's not a bug, it's a balance change
---
Everything in moderation, my son. Like anything in life, if you over do it (which it appears that you have) then you will enjoy it less and take it granted. I, for example, haven't played a private server since 2016. As a result, my hype is huge!! Especially since I did not even obtain level 60 in 2016 due to life aggro. It has been since 2006 since I have been level 60.  
---
My recommendations:   
---
\-Do not play on launch if you are not excited. 
---
\-Hope for fresh server in the future and keep an eye out for those once you feel the itch again. This will build anticipation towards that fresh server release  
---
\-Talk to a therapist: 'I can't hit 60' is a real gaming disorder seen in impatient noobs, and you may need clinical treatment to get back on the horse and slay some players in Azeroth. 
---
Jokes aside though, good luck getting the itch back. I think I know exactly what you are talking about. It definitely helps if you have a friend you can LAN with, even if you are not playing together IMO. As an adult now, you get some beers and some cocaine, and grind out those levels while having a blast. GF aggro will be minimal since you did not go to a bar.
---
nope. We live in a state that has enforced Telcom monopolies. this is the only 100+meg provider in the area.
---
Thats account sharing, multi boxxing uses multiple separate accounts. Not against the TOS.
---
Done multiple pservers. Not feeling burned at all. I've always hated the levelling process, I hated it in vanilla too.
---
Once I'm done levelling though I enjoy the game a lot, always have. So to me it's just a slightly frustrating grind to 60 as normal and then the fun begins.
---
So there are 14 pvp ranks. Once you reach a certain rank you can buy the gear from a pvp vendor for gold. For example, the first rank you can receive gear is Sergeant and you can buy the Sergeants Cloak at lvl 30 which has a good amount of stamina on it compared to other lvl 30 items. Also, the different pvp factions have gear which can be bought after reaching certain reputation ranks. The Warsong gulch and Arathi pieces are bis for twinks or just world pvp in general. Take a trip to ClassicDB and look through the vendors.
---
I wouldn’t say burnt out. Just more of a been there done that feeling. It’s just another fresh to me. I never really took things that serious to feel that the official game would be SO much better than a private server. It’s still the same game lol, just some values are different.
---
this is assuming their game-hosting servers are the same as their character-data-hosting servers though.  I'd guess they wouldn't be but i have no idea!
---
Strength is ap for hunters in classic?
---
Yea
---
Hunter or lock since you have limited time. You can solo elites thanks to your pets.
---
No idea but I'd imagine all public raids will have 1 or 2 items reserved and everything free roll
---
&gt;But sure, whatever makes you feel like winning an argument, right?
---
Its not about winning an argument. There were no comms in the original clip, and thus no way to definitively say what was happening beyond assumptions and conjecture.
---
This clip was really cool, thanks for linking it.
---
\#ThanksLayering
---
No, that’s vampiric embrace. It doesn’t do any damage just heals from the damage you deal. Vampiric touch was addition to this, and came with TBC
---
Stop being toxic god damn lol
---
Cant fight in game yet, might as well fight psychologically.
---
Also lmao at people taking it seriously.
---
&gt; Pretty much all greens should be DE'd
---
That's pretty much untrue. One should consider vendor value of an item vs market value of disenchanted goods. DE may be actually money loss for plate armor and weapons, especially 2-handers.
---
In case of greens with desirable stats such as spell power you would rather auction them instead of DE.
---
Resto Druid Please!
---
Man, your bags are full!
---
Paladin shares loot with warrior, if the paladins wants dps gear.
---
I could be wrong, but I believe 1 strength is 1 attack power for hunters and rogues.
---
Yeah Cata was very smooth. Very unexciting though.
---
If there is a reason to chose a spec over all the others, then that spec is viable.
---
If that reason is purely just the fact that it's fun to play, it's a viable spec.
---
What else do you want the specs to do? A class that can heal obviously shouldn't do as much damage as a class that can't.
---
Currently in Vanilla the class balance is perfect. The reason to chose a warlock over a mage is not because it can do more damage but because it can provide utility that a mage can't and has a different playstyle. 
---
Mathematically balancing out the damage of all DPS specs is boring, they've tried to do that for 15 years and they couldn't, all we ended up with is 0 class identity.
---
You’re so tuff!!
---
Ah, that's right.  It's been a long time.
---
Good on you.  I too find myself missing the time when "finding a thing" was not viewed as a mechanic to be streamlined out of gaming.
---
Just yesterday I was in another online RPG where someone was whining "why does X item have to be hidden". I mean it's clearly so hard when the quest only automatically marks on your map the exact area to look. @_@
---
Leap of Faith
---
I never role played before in WoW but I’ll give ya a sign !
---
Understandable.
---
No doubt , it always gets even funnier for me personally when I know there's that one guy actually getting white knuckled about it lmao 
---
That's why corpse camping people that /spit are way more fun to camp than people who just /dance with you or something fun!
---
It's literally the 1st result if you google "Diablo UI".
---
I wish he was around and healthy enough to do more Classic Coverage with his hot takes. TB is missed
---
I only remember because I only played endgame during TBC lol. So as much as I’ll miss it, vanilla end game is going to be fresh to me
---
I think he was legitimately salty because of my name calling. Blocked him after my last message so I don't even know if he responded haha
---
I played WoW again recently..
---
The trial only. 
---
I went through all my old realms and just ran about classic territories. Mostly empty and not really much happening.
---
Then I went to goldshire in Argent Dawn RP. It was so packed with people just gathered wrong talking crap in groups. The in itself was far more packed than I ever ever seen.
---
So many conversations, and of course - with gold shire being goldshire. You had naked night elves dancing everywhere. 
---
Don’t get me wrong, I’m mostly a pvp realm player. However, what I’ve tried of rp realms in vanilla and now - they hold a very important part of WoW.
---
*inserts James Franco "first time?" meme*
---
Vanilla: I was 12-14, no job, no social life. Summer consisted of waking up, showering, eating, WoW til dinner, more WoW til 3am, sleep, repeat.
---
Classic: I'll be 26, I'm married, I work 45-50 hours a week. Gonna be hard but I'm sure tens of thousands are just like me so I don't think I'll fall too far behind.
---
&gt;4 hours
---
If it takes you 4 hours to get to level 10, you should probably practice leveling from 1-10 anyway.
---
My friends and I all plan on leveling separately, but are going to remain in the same level range. We're going to try to run each dungeon at least once just to spice it up a bit and for fun.
---
Nah those are definitely reasons why people enjoy classic.
---
I remember flying from Stormwind to Southshore and walking to Scarlet Monastery numerous times, and despite the frustration of such a long journey, it was worth it every single time.
---
I'd rather wait for the shitshow to calm down, and look forward to an amazing game, than have a super convenient launch and have to deal with a subpar layered game. But it's all about instant gratification now... People just want rewards now without any patience.
---
Yea but this is all for higher patches... it says 8.0.1... would this mod still work for classic? Sorry, I am a little mod illiterate.
---
Arcane blast. I started playing during wrath on 3.0.8. 
---
Arcane blast was like rogue combo points, only they stacked on you, instead of your target. You could also, by going down arcane but skipping netherwind presence, around level 73, get shatter (massive crit chance versus frozen targets), and spell power (50% crit damage). The spec had zero pvp utitiliy as you didn't have your core instant cast arcane spells.
---
What you did have, was the ability to frostbolt a mob, then  arcane blast it to death..... then blink on top of a completely different mob, and frost nova/acane missiles it, to basically one shot it. 
---
Between arcane missiles getting all the buffs from arcane blast stacks, plus the 12% damage bonus for snared and slowed targets (something about picking on the weak?), plus the shatter crits, plus the massive arcane crit damage bonus from spell power, you could just one shot mobs. 
---
I also really liked it because it didn't mess with other parts of the game. This was JUST something you did while leveling. You weren't trying to raid with this spec, or pvp without any of your instant cast abilties. And it was a lot of fun to play, because it was mana efficient enough you could keep it going with talented evocation, and it also had very tight timings. You could BARELY get off your combo before the arcane blast stacks wore off. 
---
Honestly, it probably wasn't as good as whatever the aoe mages were doing, but I didn't even know aoe grinding existed back then. I did love that spec though.
---
He's actually not salty. He thinks you got salty.
---
I would 100% roll on a rp pvp realm
---
Anything that moves players around is great for trolling.
---
He didn't just press a button. He played about 7 days to get to 60 so he could press that button for you.
---
Oh yeah good point, I’m was just imagining guild raids.
---
To get rid of the chaotic fun? Doesn't seem very logical.
---
Our biggest concern is that if they don't introduce RP-PvP at the start but introduce it later is that we won't reroll all our characters and likely wouldn't even consider free transfers as it would damage the server we would have to transfer out of.
---
We would consider it if it was in the first 4 or so days even completely rerolling characters etc though blizzard have said they are looking to allowing free transfers between servers initially.
---
If they launch them late im certain the communities won't be able to flourish as they would do at launch and am more than certain that those that claim they would troll rp-pvp serves won't because of the effort leveling takes in WoW Classic and thus wouldn't spend their launch time on those servers.
---
Am I dumb or isn't the client already available? At least I could switch to classic in the bnet launcher and download 5.8GB.
---
I did this non WoW related,  
---
Will I need to do this again? Because that might be a problem...  
---
I could get my wife from the shelter but I think my dog moved on with someone else...
---
I'm thinking of Maraudon, you're right
---
How? A paladin is a warrior that yields the Light out of their own vindication. The Light can be used by anyone who believes they deserve it, even in fact if they do not.

I think you'd really like elemental shaman since they Thrall is a shaman and they're even more bursty than chromie is on hots.
---
Thanks! You as well
---
It takes like 16 or so hours to get a hunter to 21, not the world's biggest deal.
---
I love stuff like this! very immersive, and enjoyable; Can't wait to see more of Gallow's journeys through Azeroth!
---
This is blatantly false.   You were just wrong.   
---
&gt; There hasnt been a single word spoken about them coming later.
---
I always thought spell reflect should have gone to prot paladins. Fit with the whole thorn and damage reflection thing they had going.
---
The release of ragefire server on EQ was an absolute shit show and it was an amazing thing I will never forget. Damn that was fun.
---
There was a website like willitworkforclassic.com (it's not that) used to check if retail mods would work for classic
---
Many servers called Deadmines VC. They even called it VC before Diremaul was released. 
---
This happened because early players, especially noobs, received the quest to kill Van Cleef before knowing what dungeons were and would look for groups for this by the name of the elite mob they needed to kill, just like they did for hogger. 
---
The name usually stuck and was continued to be used for the dungeon. As altaholic back in the day (with level 25ish characters many servers), I can say for sure that fewer servers called it DM than VC in any patch period in vanilla.
---
I just need blizz to let me in the beta :(
---
Warlocks cannot summon themselves so that’s bad news for the warlock
---
But that's not blizzlike. Leeway is a pvp mechanic buddy.
---
Til shadowpriests have a different class icin
---
My girlfriend won’t play with me, but when she sees how much time I’m going to spend on the game instead of her, she will probably change her mind
---
That's adult life when you both have full time jobs, unfortunately :|
---
Yeah well I'm not lol. Couldn't care less about fantasy races in a video game
---
Just take BFA warmode as an example, alliance all deactivated after a week and it was almost totally horde controlled.
---
Those points are completely optional i just put in whatever since it doesn't benefit in pve.
---
I really hope you can but I have not seen it tested no :D
---
Oh? This is not the actual classic wow servers that others are playing tho, is it? Do you have any info for me? Finding it hard to find some
---
My first 60 in vanilla was a rogue and this really dredged up a lot of memories about how much I hated playing that class. No disrespect at all to people who enjoy it, but the super cooldown heavy playstyle made dueling and battlegrounds incredibly frustrating for me.
---
&gt;The most unintentionally bad vanilla PVP video ever
---
What? This isn't Alexensual's right against a low level hunter. Clearly this is the second most unintentionally bad vanilla PvP video ever.
---
Lol same
---
I spend time on reddit because I hate 2min intros on YT
---
The addon that shows mob spawn locations on map is which one?
---
I don't feel burned out, but am I enjoying vanilla as much as I used to? No of course not. No matter what games do get worse and worse as you play them, there really nothing to counteract that, but I enjoyed the shit out of the pservers that it was completely worth it. Rather 5 years of enjoying vanilla than 1 year of really enjoying it.
---
The streamers are on the beta.
---
Pfquest
---
&gt; The prices are placement holders and just rough estimates and are by no stretch of the imagination the real values that will be on launch, economies change and bounce around, but this is about the average value, give or take some procentile in each direction.
---
Like I said at bottom, They are from old data and estimates because of new knowledge, they are not the real values, I would never know beforehand.
---
I always felt both Tree Form and Moonkin form kind of took the Druid-ness away.   
---
Druids are a shape shifting class. They should benefit from shape shifting. They added two forms that punish you for shifting out of them *ever*. They were glorified +Healing/+Spell Damage modifiers. That's fine, but it isn't really very Druid.    
---
Priest's fifth tier talent Spiritual Guidance actually has the same modifier as Tree Form (25% of Spirit to +Healing). The only major selling point of the form was the healing aura, and that's also what made it so punishing to ever shift out even for movement sensitive fights.    
---
Giving Resto Druids more shape shifting abilities is a **good** idea. The way they went about it however was weak.
---
I played on Vashj EU and quite early on it deserved the name Crashj, so I'm expecting the same this time around.
---
You can also tank adds and such as pally/druid, so you aren't stuck as warrior if you don't have the time investment for MT.
---
Yes, i figured as much. What is it i have downloaded tho? Thats the confusion &lt;3
---
Nose beers are the most essential part of this pep talk. We should be friends
---
The guy above just told you. That’s the stress test.
---
Thank you for the information it's been so long since I did it that I don't remember enough of the details!
---
I believe you can if you are outside of the instance.
---
I mean they tried, Eye for an eye lol.
---
It's not the beta servers, it's most likely going to be used for stress test 3 and open beta/launch.
---
I never said there would be, I'm sorry that the guide isn't to your liking.
---
There are only so many places people can farm decently, and like I said throughout the guide, these are not all the places, the guide would be too big and not fit within reddits allowed limits. (I had to remove the herb section and use a reply to not make reddit bug out at the  bottom for this very reason.)
---
Hopefully you can find something new somewhere else, have a nice day.
---
Thanks for responses guys appreciate it.
---
I'll also be playing Horde so most likely Undead.
---
yeah I was always the friend that wouldn't level if other people werent on then got left in the dust when they just went ham for days straight. Fun times X\_\_x  
---
Now I am looking forward to random group ups and meeting new people. I feel like old school wow really fascilitated this well. In other MMO's I dont get as many willing participants when im just out and about.
---
Ahh ty, i'll mostly be casual also. Rotation wise quite simple?
---
Maybe not queues but it will still be overcrowded chaos despite layering.
---
I've been doing 1-30 runs classes the last month. The two things I've surmised from doing this is;
---
Every class is fun and I will have fun regardless of which class I main.
---
I can play this game forever.
---
You will do less dps than a good tank.
---
Yeah mountain silversage will definetly be selling for more than goldthorn
---
Cheat death, cloak of shadows, and shadowstep made being a rogue really fun.
---
Judging by a lot of the comments here, most people didn't catch it lol
---
zero cheap shot sounds breaks the immersion  
---
but at least it doesn't trigger my PTSD
---
Good point :)
---
I really enjoyed bear-bombing as a druid and trying to see how close I could get to the ground before going back into flight form.
---
I also enjoyed jumping out of the water in swim form and transitioning mid-air into flight form.
---
I don't want flying, but I do like it.
---
I mean just do the usual 3 WPL spots until 60?
---
Your elemental prices are off, you using private server values? They used to go for 10g+ a piece and fluctuate depending on the market up to 20g.
---
Time required to tank as a Pld/Druid is twice as high to equal the results a warrior will have (consumable farming, level of gear required, etc). They absolutely can do it - just require far more time and gear to do so. If time is your limiting factor, rolling a Pld/Druid to tank is not the way to go, IMO.
---
I always took long breaks between pservers, like play 6 months..  1 year break, play some more, 2 year break...
---
A margarita is tequila cointreau and lime juice. /#nochanges
---
Yeah, but the cost is in the materials.  You won't make much crafting it.  The guys farming the arcane crystals (mining) will be rich.
---
Very helpful, thank you!
---
Cata was mostly smooth server wise. Plenty of people crying about certain quest like the clam quest that only 1 person could click on with a 1 minute spawn.
---
I'm gonna take my sweet-ass time. Level weaponskills, do all the quests, explore all the places. The goal is by the time I get to a potential bottleneck, the majority of powerlevellers will have moved on.
---
Armor For Sleep - What To Do When You Are Dead. Tirisfal Glades. No idea why I leveled so many alts that barely broke 30 (never could decide), but by God didni listen to this album every time I was here on repeat.
---
It's only a game.
---
In the beginning there was chaos, raw and uncontrollable chaos. Then the world slowy rise... :)
---
Ohhhh! You buy them through gold but unlock through ranks. Ok makes sense, thank you very much. Now I'm interested.
---
&gt;I don't even want people to have the option.
---
Well it's a shame you think this way.
---
Seems an awful bit selfish to refuse people choice, because of your idealistic perspective.
---
Doesn't he just want the SAME chance of a non-organized player to get his name? With no realm list before the name reservations, he cant compete with those players at an even ground at all. Oh no, so entitled! 
---
I swear to God, that word is being so overused (and abused) nowadays...
---
And then it will become nostalgia later.
---
Youre like the clive Palmer of wow.
---
Yup i could see the choices are hard then,  I play one game only at a time
---
Farmed for herbs and gold for weeks. Bought my mount as the servers crashed. Logged in and had the mount and all of my gold still.
---
Thanks for stopping by!
---
Maybe you beat bad warriors. Ret pallys are by far one of the easiest classes tp beat om duels unless they get insanely lucky woth their burst. Resetting the fight by breaking combat doesnt mean you lost the duel... ret pallys are so easy to kite and break combat with why wouldn't you do it?
---
In BGs, warriors shine even more because of their insane cleave dmg from SS and mortal strike.
---
The types of people who play on pservers for years are not capable of becoming burnt out. They have nothing else to do.
---
It was called VC before Diremaul was in the game too.
---
In fact I'd say more servers called it VC at that point in time. I used to love to level up alts to around 25ish, and had a huge number of the across multiple servers. It was because groups didn't understand dungeons completely at first, and would look for players for the dungeon quest to kill van cleef the same way they did for the quest to kill hogger. "lfg van cleef" This got shortened to VC and stuck.
---
Yeah, with no dynamic respawns though it will definitely be far less efficient than it is on say private servers, let alone compared to an instanced grind (no competing for others for the spots, no worrying about getting ganked mid pull -- neither of which may not be a huge issue depending on how layering is handled , but if thats the case it brings up other issues).
---
I just like seeing real names and playing with people who are there to experience living in this crazy world for a while rather than merely playing a game. But maybe that's the romantic in me speaking, lol.
---
I disagree. Patience can also be a challenge, and one that many people enjoy. Personally, Dark Souls is one of my favorite games because if you die at a boss you have to spend a few minutes running back. It's boring as shit, and they could easily take it out and have a respawn next to the boss, but it just makes it feel better when you beat the boss and know you don't have to do that run again. I think it contributes to the game. Plus, the shitshow suffering in Classic is only going to be for a short time, not a permanent game feature.
---
Oh my god I had completely forgot this but you are 101% correct.
---
Rp is dumb anyway. This isn't dnd.
---
Yeah, so what? Real time is being wasted
---
Circle of Healing. Man, I liked healing in Vanilla, but I loved my Holy Priest in TBC.
---
First of all, I didn't reply to you, nor ask your opinion. So I have no idea why you are sticking your nose in where its not wanted.
---
Secondly, if you even bothered to read the majority of the comments in this thread alone, most of the anti opinions are people who don't even consider an option, they just assume it would be auto on or permanent.
---
The main reason for layering is to overload servers with more people than a server should have, so that way when many people leave you won't be left with dead servers. If there are 7k people on a server and 3k people per layer, you're either going to be on a layer with 3k people or get lucky and get the 1k. If you are in the 3k layer, it's still going to be a shitshow. Starting zones being less populated is not really the reason or goal they have when they are using layering.
---
Glad someone else confirms this guy doesn't know what a rhyme is. And yeah, they are essentially placeholder statements until you get a cool one, because all they are saying is "go my team"!
---
Thanks for the guide:
---
I'll nitpick one thing.

These are resistant to frost on the beta unfortunately

Thank you
---
Am I wrong or wasn't there a 5 dungeon limit per like hour? I could have sworn something like that existed at some point.
---
People talk about the lush green jungles of Stranglethorn.
---
It’s actually always blueish and ethereal and there seems to be this whispering echo chick that’s always there.  She never accepts my party invites.
---
He could just be a bit thick
---
I don't know how you do it man. lol. I can't do it. The closest I can come to sticking to one game is probably gonna be Classic WoW. It's just such a good game to play when you don't feel like doing anything in particular.
---
I didn't say Priest is preferable to Paladin.  
---
I did say that if you've got an healbot and you're not going Warrior you're doing it wrong.
---
Can't do it through mobile app keeps throwing an error when I try to select state. I'll do it on my pc though, this is exactly the server I would like to join.
---
mean blatantly?
---
What you're talking about is challenging though, because on the way to the boss there's often dangerous enemies that can kill you and cause you to lose your souls, so it's not just a waiting game.
---
But yes, the shitshow is going to be temporary so it's not really a big deal.
---
Is ele/res generally better for leveling the enh/res? I'm only going to be leveling in a duo, so I was thinking about going end but definitely resto so I can help the warrior heal while he tanks the mobs
---
For once my crazy schedule is working in my favor. I work weekend 12s, Sat-Mon; I'm gonna' take a half day on the 26th to be ready for the 3pm launch then have the next four days off without having to spend any PTO at all.
---
Of course, I fully expect to be sitting in queue(s) and/or a glorified slide-reel Azeroth chatroom for the first few hours on Monday, but I welcome the chaos. Launch shenanigans are a unique event and I can't wait for 'em.
---
Wait, people actually played on RP-PVP servers?
---
**Symbiosis** as a **Druid** was the pinnacle of class design and flavour in MoP that also gave every other Class and Spec something fun for interacting with the Druid.
---
It was complex, unique, and offered new opportunities to other characters that changed how they play their character and how the approach encounters.
---
It was a shame Blizzard got rid of it so quickly because it was a pain to balance...
---
However in my opinion the retail game would have been in a much more compelling and exciting game if they continued to use the design philosophy that enabled **Symbiosis** to be created.
---
I mean, if they tune layering relatively aggressive for the first few days it will help with that too and they fill out the layers in a non-stupid way. Even then, the launch clusterfuck really is a part of experience. So I hope they don't tune it too aggressive but playable level of shitshow. Might be impossible to find the right balance but hey, who knows?
---
Have a plan b
---
In that regard i give you right .. its a i told you so .. still makes people look pretty dumb
---
Paladins in Wrath were in a much better place over all spec trees/roles. That being said I wouldn’t add them to Classic unless it was Classic Wrath. Hybrids in Classic were hybrids not 3 different classes like they were in Wrath. 
---
Most classes were pretty balanced in Wrath. Classes not being “balanced” was what made them special in Classic though.
---
Don't forget the elbows, spine, and hips.
---
She will also be missing shoes if she rolls a troll. I personally think the Horde models are way more interesting, but some people don't like how it affects how gear looks on some races.
---
&gt; ruining other people’s fun is what PvP servers are all about
---
kek
---
OP is doing both, friend's account.
---
My game didnt come with those folder thingies
---
My memory is a bit hazy.  Was the Patchwerk encounter the reason rolling ignites got nerfed?  I remember seeing videos of guilds stacking fire mages and building up ridiculous stacking ignite DoTs.  I could also be totally wrong though, it has happened before.
---
This
---
You have no idea how many layers each realm will have. They could aggressively Layer individuals and have over 1,000 Layers per realm on Launch day.
---
You went straight and took a "play time" comment and took it to me not taking care of my family. The only joke here is you little guy.
---

---
Unfortunately this playstyle only works in 1v1's.
---
It was called VC before Diremaul was in the game by many people. It was because groups didn't understand dungeons completely at first, and would look for players for the dungeon quest to kill van cleef the same way they did for the quest to kill hogger. "lfg van cleef", which got shortened to VC and usually stuck. 
---
That isn't to say it wasn't also called DM by many. It really depended not just what server you were on, but also when you leveled past 20 on it.
---
Bandaid fix to a problem that shouldn't exist in the first place because layer shouldn't be in the game at any capacity.
---
How long is the cool down? If I kill a mob do I have to wait like 5 minutes or more before I see my friend who invited me to do a quest now? 
---
If its less than 5 minutes then I don't really see how this stops layer hoping abuse because the cool down wont be long enough. Specially not in situations like the Gurubashi arena.
---
Also I'm not 100% sure on how this all works but it sounds like it might be awkward for mages selling portals. "Sorry I have the layer cool down so you are going to have to wait 10 minutes before I can portal you"
---
Ah, missed that bit. Sorry!
---
I think  blizz only restores characters lvl 10 and over, I heard it in a video or a stream. So if your character gets hacked or deleted, especially a bank alt with all that gold, bringing it to level 10 to be safe.
---
Remember the postage costs though, it doesn't seem a lot but if you literally mail everything it counts up.
---
Cant wait for mages to try to aoe farm in the zerg hahhahahahhaha losers
---
Isn't there a profession level requirement to disenchant higher level BoE?
---
In hindsight, I'm wondering if I shouldn't have gone with simple fisticuffs for the final death round. The idea of a namby little elf and a big, galunking cow whacking each other with a fish was just too good, though.
---
Bloodlust. I never played a Shaman in endgame (only twinks) but KNOWING on a Raid that you'll be suddenly doing shitload more DPS when boss is at certain % and then hearing the in-game sound for it when expected with its visual effect and the damage numbers coming in always felt just so cool.
---
Seems like your personal excitement relies on other people being hyped for it. Yeah, the beta is pretty much over.. so theres pretty much no streams / events happening. 
---
You are probably the type of person that will quit when streamers start playing other games because people arent interested in watching anymore.
---
Im fine with that.
---
Trouble with grinding is that your gear doesn't improve compared to questing, so while it's worth it for a few levels here and there, it slows down massively once your gear is dead and gone, unless you're a warlock who don't have any use for gear.

I just don't see how you are the one using the argument that there is no benefit to splitting your playerbase, then go on to argue the benefits of splitting off the French and German playerbases. Not to mention the fact that you're just glossing over the obvious fact that Turkish is breaking the mold of the most popular langauges being seperated, they equal the English speaking population - by the source you linked yourself the Ukranian population is also equal to the Spanish population yet Ukraine gets no special treatment.
---
I would also argue it totally doesn't matter which language has the biggest population of speakers. [this](https://worldofwarcraft.fandom.com/et/wiki/WoW_population_by_country) unfortunately doesn't link their source, but they claim it's official, as we can see there's three times the amount of players on German servers than on French, despite the difference in population size is tiny in comparison. According to [this](https://y4j7y8s9.ssl.hwcdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Newzoo.png) from this [article](https://esportsobserver.com/world-of-warcraft-esports/) the Germans also have the highest average playtime (well, had in 2017) and the Nordic countries, in particular, had a higher player density. Couple this with the linguistic compatibility of the Nordic countries there's a great argument for including them too, despite the lower population, maybe even instead of the French as a Nordic-grouped server. 
---
My point being that using only the population of speakers is way too simplistic if the goal really is to make sensible splits in the population. The russian one is a no-brainer though due to the massive population coupled with their different language and low percentage of English speakers.
---
holy FUCK dude, the Aetish quest. This is a legendary album.
---
Getting BIS is all but required though.
---
If your goal is to just get 60 ASAP you'll end up going back and doing these instances repeatedly anyways while level capped.
---
Salutations from Tarren Mill my friend!
---
Spoiler Alert!
---
Do you mean willitclassic ?
---
Who has fun being pathetic?
---
Something like that, but your ass is NOT finishing 5 whole dungeons in 1 hour. lmao
---
Trolling people with misdirection was so much fun. My friends learned to quickly get rid of it if they saw it before a pull.
---
There's only 5 million less Polish speakers than there are Spanish speakers. There's also just as many Ukranian speakers as there are French ones.
---
Yeah they havent done that at all. Rather they have changed the armor values etc like it is in the classic beta so it feels even more like it. Aswell making it easier since classic values are ezmod
---
But what about her pointy elbows?
---
Wow, great counter dude. You really got me there, damn.
---
Are you that sad that most of your posts are trying to get people to not play hunter, because you think it'll actually affect the in game population and you'll have an easier time gearing?
---
if you are leveling fast you don't experience dynamic respawns on pservers after lvl15 lol
---
Id argue RFC could be finished quick enough with a good enough group, but yes overall you are right haha.
---
Enhance is best.
---
Yeah for sure, agreed that the dungeons will be done at one point or another by anyone going for pre-Raid BiS but getting those pieces  can take many many runs, so saying "I'm gonna be BiS before I'm 60" may happen , and that would be sick, I just personally have never been lucky like that.
---
I'd rather get to 60 and then grind the dungeons, for the most part.
---
BRD isn't too tough after 56 so that's probably something I'll do before 60.
---
My friend and I are going rogue/priest, and I know he is very determined to level together, but I know I will want to do some solo leveling as well. We will probably stick together to around level 30-40 and then just go seperate ways until 60. The goals is to be somewhat synchronised so we can do dungeons together all the way to 60 though
---
As you can see he did a 89k pyroblast 🙈🤫
---
Just fucking remove it for characters or zones over level 20/30!
---
No problem. I want to say the theorycraft is that below 3.3 speed SoR can be higher dps.
---
Just play as a fire mage, warlock, druid, hunter, paladin, bleed rogue, shaman or priest, problem solved.
---
By magic user, I meant magic dmg, sorry for not specifying that they have frost resistance.
---
You're right bout RFC, with a good ass/lvl'd group you could potentially squeeze in 3-5 runs. Stockades too. But you'll out level those FAST.
---
This is what I hope and kind of expect to happen.
---
Whoops, did I tell them in trade that it was off cd...
---
Thank you, for thanking me.
---
You have such a way with words
---
&gt; Regardless of what you are playing, you usually have a couple builder abilities that lead to a big spender move or a proc of some sort. 
---
Yes, to core most specs are like this, but they don't play the same. the only similarities end at builder/spender
---
What do you mean? Are you referring to fresh Pservers? 
---
Cuz certain popular, established servers definitely have dynamic respawns going in many regions past lvl 15.
---
Stv, arathi, hillsbrad, ashenvale, tanaris just off the top of my head.
---
or "oh shit, i'm out of reagents"
---
I can hear the music in this image
---
Playing in 2005-2006 as a kid I despised leveling, I remember when BGs were introduced I was level 35 and basically just played WSG for a month straight.
---
But I flipped a switch when I got older and played on private servers, leveling is actually one of the best parts of the game now.
---
 The slow progression that you get to chip away at for weeks/months is actually a satisfying feeling. And discovering new questlines or areas that you never saw before is awesome. And each class in Vanilla is really unique. So far I've really enjoyed each class that I've taken to max and I'm planning on making a class I've never played for Classic.
---
Eh, Cata had a very unfortunate bug the first few hours that was really only noticable on PVP servers (though it would affect people on PvE servers that were flagged for PVP). The guards in Hyjal were a bit TOO vigilant and would attack you for even TARGETING the opposing faction if you were PVP flagged.
---
Playing on a PVP server at the time, the ground where you landed in Hyjal to start the zone was absolutely LITTERED with the skeletons of unfortunate players who only clicked players of the opposing faction and got absolutely swarmed by guards.
---
Layering hahahaahhaha
---
What is imbue chest: absorb? I have never even heard of it, and the [classicdb.ch entry](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=7855) has no comments and not really enough info to even confirm to me that this is an enchanting ability. 
---
Is this a relevant use of bruiseweed? Is that what drives the price?
---
cause no one wanted to play them
---
Then you aren't leveling fast enough buddy.
---
Don't think the mage spectator one will work, there should be elites in the stadiums.
---
There's also the king of them all, tribute runs for hunter and warlocks. 100g+ per hour in pure raw gold
---
as a rogue main. Shadowstep for sure.
---
No one has charm man, it's a one off use and incredibly difficult to farm in real retail woth decrease in mobs.
---
1v1, mage owns shadowpriest
---
Hey some of us have jobs and responsibilities and can't play 18 hours a day, my deepest apologies ttv lol
---
It is sooooo hard to tell !
---
First, Blizz fucked up the localization of the servers, so we could extrapolate that they either want Classic to fail, or that there's not so many people enqueued to play.
---
Second, which's kinda related to the first point, it could be completely unplayable due to unexpected success or bad will from blizzard.
---
At last, and I'm forecasting with no real time-travelling skill so please don't take it too seriously, Classic Wow being a game for exigent not easy-gaming people, we might see first-lookers casuals run away.
---
Anyway, "La lumière, pas oublier la lumière" (I'm French so I don't want to fuck up the translation)
---
In order to save perhaps a week of leveling during after work hours, you spend some 25 days /played to memorize questing routes, sounds like a fair deal?
---
I'm one of those who have practiced my leveling route, and remember like 90% of my route to 20 by memory alone.
---
Change.org petitions are the shortest way to get changes or clarifications.
---
Try just asking on Twitter.
---
Best comment in the thread
---
Looks good.
---
Why not red though :D ?
---
Killing the goblin, princess and the croco gives with avged drop rates 9 gold. You can easily do 5 of these per reset which equals 45g per hour.
---
There's no need to prepare, just play...
---
Getting a little off topic from the point of balance, but the classes have nothing that makes them stand out in my opinion. I havent played BfA, but i logged into all my toons and was horribly disappointed by their kits. 
---
Strictly my opinion, but this expansion has the least interesting playstyle for every spec I looked at out of any expansion. I would even rather play my vanilla ret paladin that pops a seal and autos everything down than what is currently in the game.
---
I'd say its more along the lines of... 
---
"we are shutting down in 2 months. Whats the point?"
---
Damn that's messed up.
---
but it is a mmorpg and it covers every part unlike pve,pvp and flat rp.
---
RP-PvP is the true mmorpg.
---
Honestly you're right and I now realize there's no point to this discussion. Neither of us knows the answer and we never will until they openly speak about it.
---
Is that the pig?
---
Show me a source that they didn't have the art assets.  Because every Private Server since they're existence has had them for a decade.
---
Art assets weren't something the Private servers made up unlike some of the data (spawn locations, armor values, etc).
---
I'll take that transfer whenever its an option, free or paid, if it doesnt become available until after Ive become invested in my character. Rp-pvp is easily the best way to play wow, but Im not going to not play and wait for it. And then when its available, a server transfer would hugely improve my play experience without sacrificing the character I'd built up. 
---
Really wish theyd take the no brainer "offer at least 1 of each server type" strategy but this is Activision Blizzard so common sense isnt very common.
---
Earth Shield 
---
Instant cast Circle of Healing
---
Loved those.
---
Yes PVE mage was really simple. Some variation of FB, flurry, icicles and blizzard/frozen orb (for large mobs).  Always try to use icy veins and have barrier on.  If they get close, freeze, come of cold and blink/shimmer are some of the options.  
---
Water elemental is useful in the beginning, takes the heat off of you.   Later on rune of power and ray of frost pretty much destroys most things.  With the right potions, I would do massive damage.  There is a nice balance of DOT and instant cast that you can figure out.  
---
PVP with Mage you have to change things up.  Not so easy.
---
&gt; guess I'm speaking more to the people rushing 60
---
You asked, I replied.
---
You didnt need a guild other than flair. Now... TBC bank alts, that's a different story, because the guild bank storage was dope.
---
I wish I had done this.  But nope I nolife grinded to General with no account sharing.  My sis just playerd her alt which was technically account sharing but I was gaining nothing from it.
---
i always found it a fun instance. the scenery is nice (not the satyr side). fighting bigass giants for the first time. it's also the first instance that starts giving out plate, as far as i recall. really enjoyed doing it as a warrior. i didn't think it took too long for the rewards.
---
And I think they're wrong about that no language-based EU servers as well.
---
This "I'm not getting mine so screw you too!" mentality isn't helping anyone.
---
I wouldn't say that it drives the price, but its a useful enchant for AoE grinding/tanking, pretty much like uther's strength
---
[Here](https://classicdb.ch/?item=11302) It basicly has a chance on hit to make you have an absorb shield, if a LOT of things are hitting you, then the enchant procs a lot more often.
---
The price of bruiseweed peaks at AQ40, the resistance to poison elixir are used in a couple of fights that stack poisons.
---
The troll's blood potions is also viable for when you want to grind, the amount of HP it restores during the entire duration is quite substantial. (I use these potions on something like a spirit geared warrior or rogue, no downtime at all during leveling.)
---
You can make 50g+ an hour doing the farm as a hunter. It can be done with very little gear just after hitting 60 for epic mount farming. You kill three bosses, not just Princess.
---
Heart/NS Druid. One spec to OT and heal in raids and do Pvp.
---
You bring up a good point. I often stick with certain classes the most and will probably give the others a try this time around. I play Priest, Warlock, and Shaman the least so maybe I should start with one of those this time. Playing a human for the umpteenth time just because I know the quests better and can level faster might be why I hate those starting areas now lol
---
&gt; If you have some sort of buff that increases your spell damage and cast a DoT on a target but then lose the buff, does the damage stay
---
Yes. The entire dot damage is calculated on cast.
---
Thought about it, but spamming frostbolt in pve would be ass.
---
That's awesome!  I'm also getting my wife to give it a shot.  I don't think she'll be as gung ho as yours is, but I think she'll give it an honest try.  
---
I just have a 2 month countdown to build her a computer though...
---
From 1 account to another yes. Mailing your own characters was instant
---
I would max out Imp. Succubus and take Imp. Imp over Fel Stamina.
---
And take 3/5 Suppression rather than 3/5 Imp. Drain Life.
---

---
Being a good troll is not about the number of downvotes, its about not making it 100% obvious that you are one.
---
The cost/benefit ratio of spending 57600 seconds to save 5 seconds mailbox travel time is insanely poor in my opinion. But it's just an opinion so let's agree to disagree.
---
I think none of us are looking forward to the Trump guilds though :/
---
The issue is that for me i've got a community that im running and its not just me that would be moving.
---
I've got to convince a whole community of people and over 90 of them actually completed our recent roster recall. Now those 90 people make contacts and friends on the server and then you have to convince those people.
---
Sadly, I've made a commitment to help lead the guild and the community we form together and can't just hang up my hat and sod off after everyones made friends if they add it miles late.
---
Exactly. I really love doing quests and watch my character development.
---
Leveling is part of the game. I belive some players (me include) started to feel that need of rushing into Max lvl was due to the increase of level in each expansion.
---
Just farm brd prison to 58.... Pretty quick
---
I like how this goes to show that you can clear naxx with other dps than only fury warrs, mages and a hunter. Also the amount of druids is quite impressive. Also no need to stack every single (world) buff available in the game. All these things make it easier, yes, but still much doable without.
---
"You are correct, but that doesn't make you right"
---
Its not even the process (which is time consuming and costly) it's the timing, if you plan on raiding you'll probably be wearing full t2 by the time the quests are even available.
---
This will get downvoted, but if you put a gun to my head or asked me to bet all my money, I would bet Classic is going to flop.  If you enjoy the leveling experience, cool, if you enjoy endgame...well...I will be interested to see how many people quit after being asked to do molten core for 3-4 months or whatever the phase is going to be.  MC is freaking awful braindead raiding.  Everyone will level, get a taste of nostalgia, and most people will quit, I don't think Classic is going to have staying power.
---
Fantastic! Thank you!
---
You could power all of the USA if you hooked up your big smart brain to a power line
---
&gt;he was getting like 1 hour 30 minute levels. It is n
---
Cdew and co had probably over 2x the relevant stats for their class you will have in normal leveling gear, and still only did it in 1.5 hours, when 1.5 hours is on the slow side of a good quest leveling route at that level.
---
I'm going to be rushing 60... You realize your version of life isn't the same one everyone else is living right?
---
Rushing , in my use of the word, means using all the time they are logged in into leveling until they are 60, not necessarily people who are playing as much as they possibly can.
---
Everyone who is going to be pushing like 5 days of real world time to 60 definitely would be under the "rushing" category, but rushing to 60 doesn't require you take 2 weeks off work and shit in a cup next to the PC and sleep 4 hours a day.
---
It's an average of 9g 5s 3c per run or 45g 25s 15c per hour. Completely uncontested.
---
So how does this work? It's a temporary enchantment, that enchanters put on... themselves? Where do they learn the recipe from? If I wanted to use bruiseweed for this purpose, what would I do?
---
Haha I was always amazed when feign death and Charlie stealth worked in the tram. Shouldn't a dead orc be kind of suspicious?
---
No, it's not been there a while, since the closed beta kicked off i have been checking daily and nothing, until a few days ago, i would guess this is for the EU open stress test.
---
Nice, haven't heard of this one.  You mean solo aoe farm it? 
---
Could you elaborate or point me in the direction of any relevant YouTube links ?
---
Because i will play frost mage
---
The reason you don't find much is there really isn't much and its not needed at all. Why bother tracking down gear you won't use at 60 and makes almost no difference anyway?
---
You’re still missing this incredibly simple point. All the post is pointing out is that sometimes in life, we look back at shitshows fondly. I mean come on, have you never looked back at a memory of a shitty teacher, or a shitty party with your friends and laughed, thinking you wouldn’t have had it any other way? (Assuming it was just a minor, and temporary blip on an otherwise long and rewarding journey)
---
Yeah well at this point I don't even care anymore. You're all too easy bait
---
That's not true obviously
---
I died again (which was my bad) after a 20mins walk of shame. Asked for a brez druid told me he was out of regent. Left the group immediately
---
If there's anyone here who understands why EU players are salty about that decision it's the RPvP crowd. We've been in the exact same boat for several months now. And yeah, it sucks.
---
That said? This bitter, spiteful "I'm not getting mine so screw you too!" mentality isn't helping anyone.
---
I don't live in the EU, so language-specific servers are a non-issue to me. I still hope you get 'em, though, because it's stupid not to. Just like I'd hope folks on your side o' the pond can also see the parallels here and hope we (and you) get an RPvP server even as you advocate for your own realms.
---
It's true, the layering on EQ Progression servers did feel quite elegant and practical.
---
Might not be that lucrative, as in, you can at least in theory get better g/hr in other ways, but as a hunter, I've understood it's relatively easy, safe. It's an instance so it's not contested, so you don't have to worry about other people on your farm route. No need to be concerned about PvP. So if you take these into account, it starts to become more appealing.
---
Nice. Thx
---
Any reasons why?  HP=more soul link uptime.  I get supression, but again this isn't for PvE at all.  I could do 5 mans with no spec, so who cares about supression.
---
Sure, if it's comical. But I don't see how the shitshow at launch is going to be funny in any way. There just going to be a shitload of people in a small area competing for the same resources.
---
I won’t need to buy a 40 mount so I want to invest a little in better healing gear, for fun
---
Yeah you really have no clue, you arent baiting anyone when you are this obvious.
---
I remember getting stuck on the spider boss that puts people to sleep.  Maexnus or something.  They then released a patch where you could have more than 1 of each hot on a guy at a time and that boss went down that week first try.
---
I'm not 100% sure about the enchant, but it should be available, the classic DB is not 100% accurate, its not "temporary" its a real enchant as far as I know.
---
Its one of the things the list has so I have to have had some idéa behind it when I made the list, for all I know it might just be a error of some sort.
---
Sorry for not being on any help, I cannot give you more info since there isn't any to be found online nor from my memory of the game.
---
I can hear this image. I'm a Horde loyalist but Lion's Pride Inn was always one of my favorite pieces of WoW's OST
---
Sure, they feel outclassed, but they're not unusable.
---
They're not even close to real estimates, though. Prices on actual vanilla were way lower. I'm not sure if it's TBC/WOTLK or private servers that are creeping in here, but either way those prices make no sense without massive gold inflation.
---
&gt; Strictly my opinion, but this expansion has the least interesting playstyle for every spec I looked at out of any expansion. I would even rather play my vanilla ret paladin that pops a seal and autos everything down than what is currently in the game. 
---
Now that doesn't make any sense.
---
If you compare it to MoP yes I agree, but anything prior Cata I think classes are actually better than they were, but because they got better from wrath and then went down hill again it just feels worse than if we went from classic straight to what we have now it would actually be better.
---
The technology hasn't really improved that mucch in 20 years. Maybe 10-15% faster with better routing. If you were getting 500 ping to a CS server EU -&gt; US something had gone very wrong, both in 1999 or 2019.
---
It's not "I'm not getting mine so screw you too". It's understanding Blizzard's decision and moving on with it.
---
That video is long lost, we were farming for rogue drops, yep. Not sure if it was Shadowcraft shoulders.
---
For a while there I thought you were talking about the pig in Elwyn Forest.
---
Have you even looked at the comments bro?
---
There is questie and it shows uncompleted quests
---
Yeah. Maexxna I think?
---
It really seemed like whenever they released a vanilla raid it was bugged and/or overtuned to hell, and in many cases it was impossible to progress for a month+. 
---
I'd still prefer that than the opposite, though, where it's easy as shit and everybody clears it in a week or two.
---
Love it, really great work
---
We will see what the prices are, these are MY estimates, so take it as you will, they make sense to me.
---
Enough people have been complaining about the gold prices instead of actually focusing on the guide itself, I've already said several times that they are estimates and they are not accurated by any stretch of the imagination.
---
Even if you were flagged, most people on PVE will avoid attacking you so they don't flag.
---
Just youtube brd mage solo farm. Its tough in the beginning but at 52/53 it should be easier. It works Best if You can complet the ghost key quest but functions without it. I plan to do this as soon as I finish the mage quest farm in theramore from 39/40 to 49.
---
Technically correct, the best kind of correct
---
Because your gameplay and approach to the world varies so drastically based on class... you either enjoy it and it feels right or it doesn't. Fuck everything else.
---
“Won a greed role”
---
“No luck involved “

Starts giving out plate? Uldaman, RFD, Zul'Farrak are all prior to Mara and give plate pieces.
---
I don't tip because I'm not American. Give me your price and I'll decide if it's fair or not.
---
This is probably the one area in WoW Classic that other layers can't prevent you from safety. There will be war on every layer
---
People actually need to sign the petition, not just upvote it, as of this comment, 2.6k upvotes and 1.7k have signed it... upvotes won’t get blizzard attention.
---
Which is a solid point, but it doesn't account for how much of an effect the 10 months between WoW's launch and the first RPvP servers being rolled out had. By the time that was an option many of us had long since settled on our established realms and weren't interested in leaving behind our character progress and, more importantly, the friends we'd made in order to switch to a more ideal server type.
---
Have you tried creating any help/harm macros that also switch you into the appropriate form prior to casting? On retail druid I use help\harm for a lot of my abilities but with classic it doesn't automatically cancel forms when using caster abilities. 
---
What would I need to put into my macro to cancel my form when I cast a healing ability (help) Would it just be something similar to this? 
---
    /cancelform [help, combat, noform:0]; [harm, combat, noform:1] Bear Form
---
    /cast [@mouseover,help,nodead,form:0] Rejuvenation;[@mouseover,harm,nodead] Swipe; [help,nodead,form:0] Rejuvenation; [harm,nodead] Swipe; [@player,form:0]Rejuvenation
---
I'm just stuck on how I could macro it in and I don't have beta to be able to test it otherwise.
---
The most notable are jumper cables and the teleport trinkets. Gadgetzan and Everlook
---
vampiric touch, dual wield + new stormstrike, bloodlust, maelstrom weapon, beacon of light, lifebloom
---
Except... gnomes will dismount in water before any other class due to their small size. Ha!
---
What do you do on hunter to get all that green?
---
Yeah, understandable. I am often frustrated at classicdb too. It seems wildly ungrateful on my part. Like "this is by miles the best tool I have seen, but it's not in every way perfect (for example, all food is not categorized as food, it's just in the general category "consumable").
---
The search for the fabled enchantment must continue, I guess. And I am completely on the running around while leveling with a full stack of elixirs train. Elixir of fortitude is SO good for a warrior. 120hp margin of safety while running private server dungeons? yes please.
---
Every class has a niche and if you aren’t going for world first it isn’t that important. If you have a group of friends and have a plan together, you will be able to play almost anything. I’d avoid try paladin though lololol
---
Nah, I'm kind of excited to flex on everyone with my average at best game knowledge. 
---
But I've played Horde my entire life, so my plan is rolling Alliance for the mix-up. But i quit once the classic announcement was made so I've had roughly a year break from classic.
---
I was curious how non-NA servers handled these sorts of things. So no tipping at all is common?
---
It’s going to be a mad rush to get names
---
That isn't a batching thing, it's a client thing. The popup numbers just appear whenever the client feels like showing them, the client itself is staggering them. If he had combat log open, you'd see them all appear there simultaneously.
---
Pretty much the whole shadow priest package from TBC was good. I hated most of holy and disc.
---
Feedback Appreciated!
---
I don’t, I’m going to level as a solo warrior and once they catch up at 60 or after I run out of vacation we’ll start playing together
---
Ah true, just the general consensus in this thread is that Warrior + Priest is the optimal combo including a warrior.
---
So much talk in this chain about how good and useful and even necessary imp gouge is and then the final 15/31/5 spec doesn't have it.
---
Fair point! Maybe I need to just suck it up and figure out a way to set up a second monitor haha. Thanks for the input and great site/tool man!
---
It's just strange to me, to have people seeing different things. They actually change the way thw characters stand. So you could be sitting behind an object thinking you are fully hidden, but your character model is visible to the other person. 
---
The whole point of government, laws, and even to a greater extent society itself, is to limit what other people can do based on idealistic perspectives.

Add in landslide, and herb for blindweed (1 stack per hour) and it’s easily 55G+ per hour

Goggles are generally pretty good for head slot, there are a few pre bis shields and trinkets as well, also of course guns. Most of the rest of the stuff is utility, bombs are okay as well

Then once again you are looking for a low variance high gph, which is not measured by the chance of having gotten a rare drop within a certain amount of kills. Yes the variance depends on the probability of the drop and it is value, but no it does not depend on how many kills you do.
---
People who are trying to be the very best, like no one ever was, are to be laughed at.  Classic is about playing Ocarina of Time again 15 years later, noticing how the graphics were bad, but the game was still a fun ride.  Enjoy the world and setting and ignore the try hards.
---
A note about try hards:  When it comes to progression raiding, the exciting part, the skillful part, is discovering a strategy to an unbeaten (or rarely defeated) encounter.  There are so many guides to all the raids, to all the gear, to everything, that being a try hard is really just someone else performing a choreographed strategy a decade after the play was written.  Cool, but not extraordinary.
---
You can gank him and his loyal flock of retards though.
---
Likewise!
---
Undead?
---
I played a WL through vanilla and BC.
---
SS are no big deal.  This and ammo are overblown like crazy IMO.
---
WotF is something to learn to work around, but saying "muh class sucks because I can't do anything if my enemy isn't completely out of control of their character for 10+ seconds" is kind of silly.  Go engineering if you want to PVP seriously and you'll be absolutely fine.
---
The debuff limit is only a problem if you want it to be.  There are many specs that work with the limit, and WLs have *utility* that other classes don't have that make them important to the raid. 
---
Rogues and mages *are* great, but I think people have also forgotten that *it's fucking hard to gear yourself no matter what* in classic.  If you're running in a guild, it's not a "loss" when your friend gets their tier set over you, it's a win for the guild, a win for the raid group, and a win for you because now you have 1 less person who needs that item in the future.  Celebrate success, not personal gain.
---
Every class has pros and cons.  You seem to only be focusing on the cons, so there will never be a right answer.  Well when that's the case, no matter what you pick it's going to be inferior - so i guess you should just pick the one that looks coolest.
---
Revivification and reanimation are very different.
---
uh, doesn't matter.  Just pick another class you want to main, you will be playing more than she will and you will not want to out level her on the duo.
---
At the end of the day this attitude is what means the most. Just doing what you want, and it's definitely something I'm gonna try to keep in mind in the next 2 months 🍻
---
They where all decked in gear they only got by running higher level dungeons and doing much higher level quests then they would normally do, so no the stats would still not be near what the lvl 30 twinks had.
---
This guy priests. It always grinds my gears when players give advice irrespective of gear level for priests, despite the fact the talents and stat weights changes based on how good your gear is. 
---
For instance i'd actually recommend taking mental strength over spiritual healing when you first get to 60 and are gearing up. That extra mana will usually help you way more in dungeons when you have worse gear.
---
If you like fun gadgets, it's worth it.
---
These are great shots, but they just remind me of how much I'm going to miss being able to transmog. Those armor sets start to look like uniforms.
---
If you are a tank, 100%.  If you are dps, then probably.  If your a healer, then meh.
---
Stop getting ahead of yourself. Most people don't make it to endgame where that stuff matters, no matter your class you will still get hundreds of hours worth of enjoyment from leveling and getting your pre-bis where no one cares about spec.
---
You could always not install a DPS addon, end game raiding is such a small percentage of vanilla wow, i don't get why people get so hung up on that.
---
Maybe because the final one doesn't need to keep leveling up ? Or because you want to have a proper dungeon/raid build ?
---
As a personal preference, I would keep improved gouge and improved sinister strike, because I don't only do pve :)
---
Bombs make a difference PVE too. Also having jumper cables and ports are nice. The question is what would you get instead and is it better? For the most part engineering is only good for the engineer. Other crafting professions are good for helping others. But end game yes having Engineering on you main is BIS. 
---
I plan on going Skinning/mining till 60. Then dropping Skinning at 60 for blacksmithing so I can make resist gear for my main who is a warrior. After I get my first alt to max a Druid. I will drop Mining for Engineering. As my Druid will be my Herb/Mining toon. Going to run a ground spawn tracking add on so I can swap between herb and mining easier.
---
ya because it's a dps boost for pve too
---
I'm not going to play Classic until RP-PvP servers are available. There is no point for me to spend my time in an environment idling around wasting what little time I have until they decide to release an RP-PvP server. Only for me to switch and lose all the time I spent on my characters elsewhere.
---
Until an RP-PvP server is released I'm not paying for Classic WoW.
---
You still need at least 4% spell hit for PVP and Fel Stamina is so little HP for your minions that it's not worth it. Take it if you think you'll NEVER use Imp, but I think it's a mistake.
---
Was. Server has fallen quite far (along with the rest of wow) from its glory days
---
&gt; Classic is about playing Ocarina of Time again 15 years later 
---
I love this analogy. Night elf Hunter named Légolás coming soon to your local Teldrassil.
---
Yeah you can spice it up a little with that if you can afford the time and you don't want to wait reset timers.
---
In fact, unlike most movies of its kind back in the day, this isn't even an actual machinima, but rather a 3D animation made in 3ds max using exported models. That, combined with the creator's talent for animation is most likely what made it stand out so much at the time.
---
But layering is being TESTED MANUALLY. The population on the beta server isnt high enough for the layering mechanic at all. Its all experimental and tweaks manually. Everything in your video could just be Blizzard testing stuff making it look bugged for players.
---
So, come with proof (that CANT exist) that layering screws shit up hard and ill bait.
---
Yes, sappers and dynamite are required raiding consumes in guilds that care about clearing content fast.
---
Thank you! It's my pleasure to help out.
---
yes, even if you dont pvp you should have engineering.  it is just as good for pve!
---
if you dont have engineering then you are a bad player...simple as that
---
sappers
---
Sorry no source, that's just the way how  I remember it. On the WoW main website there [was a big list of the servers progress,](https://web.archive.org/web/20060117061631/http://www.worldofwarcraft.com:80/wareffort/servers.html), and you had all the tiny servers at the bottom. They made very very slow progress the first month or so, and then after the big few guilds unlocked it, everyone started magically making good progress each day - so everyone had it unlocked within a couple of months.
---
I'm playing till I pass out.
---
Make friends and play warrior, problem solved w/ solo pvping.
---
They have versions for Wrath &amp; up... I wonder if the 3.3.5a version would work, it might be worth a shot :)
---
If it’s a client related issue then it would be happening in retail but it does not occur. The only difference in classic is the artificial 400ms spell batching.
---
Good post I’m planning to roll human and I want the saber tooth mount
---
Yeah I know right.   I played WoW for 10 years,  quit after getting a loyalty statue (just coincidence),  did pretty well raiding and really looking forward to Classic...for the second time.
---
and vital for raid vs raid pvp
---
Warlocks are BiS class - but I recommend you go horde unless you want a challenge and engi required. 
---
I played a warlock throughout Vanilla. Sometimes you forget to keep a stock of shards early on, but you learn quick. The only time I ever felt like Shards were a real issue was when I went Conflag spec for PvP. Otherwise if I ran out of shards I knew it was on me.
---
The debuff limit only matters in raiding which nerfs your DPS but you will be brought to raids anyway because you are a BiS class known as a Warlock. 
---
Beyond there are a TON for pros for warlock. Best 1v1 PvP, Amazing QoL (pet tank, free mount, Second best AoE), Capacity to CC up to 4 targets at once (if they are the right kind of target), age like wine.
---
Exactly what I’m going through lol. Like if I play any other class idk if I could invest like I would with pally
---
If there's *anyone* here who understands the frustration you folks in the EU are feeling it's the RPvP crowd. Because we've been in the exact same boat for several months now.
---
Here's hoping we both get our respective wishes. :)
---
Could a warlock do the hunter run you described?
---
Goblin Sapper Charges and dynamite are super strong in PVE as well.
---
Good luck to you! I'm hoping to do the same and without farming runecloth for months, haha!
---
My buddy and I aren't sure whether to go Alliance or Horde. I'm playing a Paladin or Shaman depending, and Ret looks like it could be interesting, but I've heard it's just the worst in Classic and trying to progress. I'm not looking to push anything besides maybe downing MC and Onyxia. Is there anything you can tell me about Ret?
---
Same here. She's never played a PC game before and has no clue what WoW even is but is willing to give it a shot with me. I tried to explain it to her and speaking the basics out loud made it sound incredibly insane and complicated. How does one introduce the game to someone who's never really played games before?
---
I appreciate the write up. I do however take issue with a number of things from your previous post with regards to the private server economy:
---
&gt;Shadow prot potions are used in naxx at the earliest
---
Shadow Protection potions are used by every player in the raid a minimum of once per attempt during Nefarian progress. Shadow Protection potion ingredients will jump significantly in price just prior to BWL.
---
&gt; Elemental protection potions early game wont sell, this is a private server phenomenon, the bosses are about 50% harder then they should be on private servers, they hit harder and have a lot more armor and other resistances, they're overtuned, on the real classic stuff like this in something like molten core isn't going to do anything, its going to be too easy so people wont buy it, and if they're struggling, the potions wont help regardless.
---
Your claim about the tuning numbers on private servers is exceptionally bold. I won't disagree or agree with it, but I challenge you to provide a substantiated source.
---
With regards to actually selling the potions, your analysis is completely incorrect regardless of the "tuning" of the bosses. With your logic, *all* potions, buff foods, world buffs, and other items eg. sappers etc. are completely useless because they're not necessary to do the content. And yet, a full BWL geared raid will still stack up Sulfuron Harbinger and use 15 Goblin Sappers at once. Why? It's faster and easier.
---
Good guilds won't just be trying to "clear" MC, they will be trying to *clear MC quickly*. This is an inevitability because the mindset around gaming in general has shifted to being hyper-focused on efficiency.
---
&gt;Lists a Mage AoE Farming guide, but in real classic its going to be a lot harder, aswell as the influx of players, you're not going to be able to do this reliably, the guide doesn't mention this at all, just gives you a sheet of locations, doesn't state PvE or PvP at all, on PvP you'll be spending most of your time in ghost form, a single rogue can ruin your entire day.
---
You think classic with 2.5k player "layers" will be worse than a private server with 8-12k player layers? On top of that, why does that even matter? It's simply presented as an option, and indeed it is a well known, well tested, and well aged option that has been leveraged by mages since 2004. It would be absurd to make no mention of it simply because you think there will be too much competition.
---
&gt; Dire maul tribute: in diremaul tribute runs (Which was not a thing in real classic.) the boss should be charging you, on private servers this is not the case, you will have to duo or trio to be able to do this
---
You are wrong. Dire Maul North tribute running was discovered by Hunters towards the tail end of vanilla proper and it is not a private server exclusive method. It's viability at lower gear levels remains to be seen, but it's still an original classic gold making method.
---
Warriors have pummel... Rogues big advantages are they can use their tier sets for dps and they can use daggers for MH. That will mean a raid with 12 warrior 6 rogues will gear up much faster than a raid with 18 warriors.
---
No. The only version of WoW that's ever able to be purchased is the latest expansion. Everything else is included with a subscription.
---
so consider the post is sitting at almost 2.7k upvotes and the change petition is only sitting at just under 1.7k, about a thousand of you fuckers don't actually care and are lazy.
---
There's no separate WoW base game anymore. All expansions up to (but excluding) the current are available within the subscription without additional purchase, so just buying the subscription gives you a "WoW: Legion" account. 
---
You don't need the latest expansion to play Classic.
---
Moon Guard had more roleplayers, especially on Alliance.
---
Every class has its upsides and downsides. Warlocks have to shard farm, Hunters have to store tons of ammo/food, but solo PvE/farming is also much easier on both with pets. Warriors are always wanted in groups, but also have a huge portion of their bags filled with offset gear. Both priest roles are amazing in PvP, they are top tier healers in PvE, but have to respec often if they want to be that good. 
---
(Also, alliance locks being useless is mostly a meme, WotF is not that insanely powerful since it doesn't work on death coil. It might be rough in lower leveled pvp hot zones like STV, but you don't have to quest there.)
---
For the "outclassed" thing, you have to realize that the entire game doesn't revolve around pulling the most DPS/HPS - Druid DPS sucks but guess what? A druid can Bres, Innervate, offheal, toss on different armor sets and fill other rolls - guess what rogues can't do? All of that. 
---
Ret/Enhance is outclassed by warriors as far as DPS goes, but can warriors resurrect or apply incredibly powerful buffs/totems? Nope.
---
Late game Hunters get completely out DPSd by mages/locks, but can Mages/Locks defrenzy? Kite bosses? Pet tank? Nope (and *not really* on the last 2).
---
TLDR: every class has its ups and downs. You have to personally weigh these in your decision.
---
I am having a hard time choosing between these three.  Plan to raid through naxx.  Don't care much about pve.
---
Elemental Shaman - Troll
---
Feral Tank Druid - Either
---
Spell dmg hunter - Dwarf or Troll
---
Ah thank you!
---
Some of these were taken in TBC, the mage has teleports to Shat and Silvermoon on their actionbars.
---
I was a human with the tiger mounts in vanilla. I went to Darkshore and quested there, then Ashenvale, etc. to get Darnassus rep and by the time I got to 60 I was nowhere near exalted. I don't think I was even revered at that point. I ended up turning in what felt like a million stacks of runecloth to finally get it.
---
You need a current subscription. No, you do not need a copy of the current WoW client to play, only Battle.net app. You’ll be able to download the WoW Classic Client as it becomes available.
---
It’s not “we’re screwed, screwed you” I’m just telling that this decision is giving us a hint that Blizzard want to open the minimum amount of server they can and/or they don’t have a lot of faith in the long term success
---
It's close but generally dwarf has an advantage in rogue mirrors.
---
Yes engineering is very op in classic.
---
My Ult is Bank Transact
---
Keep in mind these were taken in TBC, the mage has teleports to Shattrath and Silvermoon on their actionbars.
---
The amount of spam with this same title since stress test 2 would say otherwise.
---

---
Porn wins hands down.
---
Or came to laugh? You left that one out.
---
Being completely uncontested is probably the biggest one. 
---
Sometimes, you just don't want to deal with people stealing your ores/mobs/herbs/whatever or feel like pvping/getting ganked, so chilling by yourself and just grinding out gold is almost... relaxing.
---
... this is a stupid guide??
---
Literally every person I've spoken to here who wants an RPvP server has said, if that's not an option, they'll either be rolling regular PvP or simply not playing at all.
---
Splitting the RP community isn't really a factor here, as the PvP element of RPvP is truly that important to the people who want it.
---
Ohh man that music is awful.
---
[You should watch this :p](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3FIZlII1Ts)
---
i heard  thaton beta quests don't care about your level u can do grey quests and still get rep idk for sure tho
---
Yes, but what stress test. One thats already over, one thats coming up, do you have any info?
---
Back in the day? It will probably remain my personal top 1 forever.
---
And even more of us will quit eventually if they do nothing: so really what the majority wants will be the best business decision for then. Guess we'll see how that plays out towards the end of the cycle.
---
my level 61 gnome rogue, leveled 1-60 in vanilla and untouched since tbc launch, is:
---
* honored 5816/12000 darnasuss
---
* friendly 5730/6000 exodar
---
* honored 7763/12000 gnomeregan
---
* honored 8652/12000 ironforge
---
* revered 1167/21000 stormwind
---
no one was getting close to exalted from questing in vanilla.  rep numbers on pservers were always way higher than i remembered in vanilla
---
Because DMT is nerfed on pservers. What would you recommend Hunters farm if it isn't Mara runs?
---
But then, why did the numbers show up fine in Vanilla even though batching was present then.
---
There have been clips from the beta where damage numbers have shown up several seconds after the damage had been dealt due to the client delaying the damage popup for whatever reason.
---
Oh? Where do i go to find any info on this?
---
OK boss. Whatever you say.
---
So basically every single warrior in the game will be an engineer?
---
I never saw under 350-400ish ms when playing on US servers as an Aussie through Vanilla and BC
---
I do not want to be in a house that has caught on fire
---
True, grenades are also pretty useful for Cthun tentacles, razorgore/nef/ony adds. All of ZG
---
Oof, thats a difficult question. I'll get back to you a bit later when I've figured out something useful, as I can't come up with an answer on the spot!
---
The fact that you don't know about the UBRS kite, one of my all-time favorite things I can do to help my party?  I don't know, man.  Maybe writing this, especially for newbies to the class, wasn't the best idea.
---
I love comments like this. Truely the epitome of "play what you think is fun". Our 12 year old selves were just having a good time, messing around, having fun. Now around 30 we're minmaxing every decision in order to be the best. Sometimes we need a reminder to just have fun again and throw a single point in Monster Slaying in Survival just cuz that purple dragon is cool.
---
Definitely this. This was the main reason my spriest got to come on raids occasionally... LF mana battery
---
Where do I complain? I’m just telling that Blizzard doesn’t seem to have a lot of faith in the long term success of the game and want to open the minimum amount of server apparently and I’m laughing at that guy who said there was never more than 2 German server with 1k people online because it’s pure ignorance: during Vanilla there was dozens  of full servers both in German and French.
---
So stop being aggressive maybe?
---
Doesn't scale well with gear, isn't the best at any particular role, isn't at all viable for end-game DPS, has a niche popularity in one Battleground. Yeah, Druid just sucks.
---
Wow, that's crazy low! Did your gnome rogue level in teldrassil and kalimdor mainly? Or did they follow a traditional leveling path?
---
For my money the best looking horde females are tauren.  But some women are upset that Taurens are often called cows.
---
You can turn in quests when they are grey to you but you get a fraction of the reputation.
---
Server down for unexpected maintenance, someone has rear ended the server!
---
That's good information - appreciate it!
---
Crusader strike
---
missing out on the teldrassil rep is killer, man.
---
I mean light can only get so fast but there have been improvements to how much info is needed to transfer and how much is server side
---
It’s very tedious to level and is really reliant on auto attacks and rng for damage. Leveling is slow but you won’t die much. Ret paladins reslly don’t get taken in raids endgame
---
Arcanite and mooncloth should be pretty stable relatively quickly.  Mooncloth is mostly valuable for the cooldown, and Arcanite is about 50/50 the price of the arcane crystal and the cooldown.  The demand for them never really goes away until BC, so at best holding them will just match inflation, potentially lose relative value as more cooldown alts get leveled.  
---
Personally I prefer cash, because you can always invest in short term flipping, while hoarding commodities generally leaves you without a clear exit point.
---
At this point we don't know.
---
Private servers likely won't match classic's resource spawns/rates
---
We've had 15 years to learn about the in game economy so it won't match vanilla.
---
My best guess is that prices will likely be highest while everyone is getting their prebis as demand will be highest.
---
Oh damn, I forgot that wasn't in classic. I liked that a lot, fun to help your tank.
---
ok but were you aiming for any of those reps or did you just level to level?
---
That's good information - I wonder if the reputation values will [be the same](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c6a6rj/estimated_reputation_values_are_way_off/)?
---
I laughed.
---
He doesn't know about kiting Drakk.  I think that says it all.
---
most fury warrior in vanilla were threat capped all the time. Without a way to dump threat you constantly had to be aware.
---
info on what?
---
Its pretty simple, Druids trade power for versatility 
---
but they have a place
---
Is there a lot more in Teldrassil? I'm planning to do it again so maybe it's worth making the trek at level 1?
---
I kinda figured. It would probably only get leveled if it *needs* to for some enchanting related reason.
---
Ok, still something super wrong. I was in rural NSW on ADSL1 and I got about 280ms in vanilla and then 230ms in TBC with tunnel subscription service thing all the aussie arena players used.
---
I feel like I was a little mod crazy. I still do custom ui that looks similar to this day.
---
i remember queing for wsg at lvl 39 hitting level 40 getting my mount and running circles around the mountless peasants
---
I found grinding 5k for flying mount in bc much more cancer than 1k for classic. 
---
For your main it was mainly not spending gold and impulsive buying on the AH, even if you only make 33g a day, you got it within a month. And once you got a mage or hunter main with epic gear, you could easily make 40-80g per hour. Also buying gold and botting was already a thing, or you could simply let a fishing bot running the whole day. 
---
And by the time warlords of draenor / pandaria hit you could make millions with enough twinks / ah addons / automation...
---
You must be new.
---
Well, good thing i just did that.
---
Best troll
---
Or you could just eat savory deviate delight till the rng stops showing its hatred by making you a ninja.
---
Seems you are also a pleb in rl if you cant afford taking a few years off.
---
Earth shield is such a great spell... Too bad it's not a classic one
---
I mean I plan on rotating between a few characters to maximize rest boost. I'd much rather level up more slowly IRL but level up faster /played
---
Hype been dead for weeks. Cant watch streamers. Of course no beta. WoW classic summer...rip
---
Dude... it's SO hard.  I've tried to get my wife to play games w/ me in the past and it's been a real struggle.  
---
It's strange little things you'd never even think of.  Our first game on computer was a real learning experience.  It was a 3rd person game w/ standard wasd controls.  I explain how to move, what keys do what, and we play for a while.  She's... not good.  Then she starts complaining how her hand cramping. I look over, and she's literally holding each finger about an inch above the keys.  She doesn't do what I think any human would naturally do, rest her hands on the keys.  No, she's holding her hand in some kind of crazy "claw" pose an inch above the keyboard.  Jabbing down at the keyboard when she needs to change from D to A, or whatever.  
---
It was painful.  The best advice I can give you, is DON'T try to explain everything.  WoW does a really nice job of slowly warming you up to the game, and ramping up as it goes.  It's so easy to overwhelm my wife and ruin the experience.  I more focus on "This is going to be fun!" Instead of "You get all these powers, and at level 10 you get talents, talents come in trees, 3 threes! and they effect differnt powers, so you want to gear your character blahblahblabhablabhalbhalbh" 
---
It's hard because I'm exciting and I just want to gush... but I've learned that the slow approach works best for me.  
---
My wife pretty much only played Sonic and Mario growing up... 3D has been a real challenge.  "ok come this way."  "WHERE ARE YOU!?!"  "I'm 4 feet behind you"  *she walks backward 4 feet to see me instead of just turning around* 
---
BUT don't be afraid my friend, eventually she became.... ok.  She says her favorite game we played together is diablo 3, followed by The Old Republic.  So if she enjoy SW:TOR she can eventually figure out classic wow... I think.
---
burst of speed, I love it was possible for rogue to run almost as fast as flying mount.
---
The first two lines are what I added in to my normal retail help/harm macro but I feel like those wouldn't work. Thanks for the help, no one I know has beta to help me test stuff :(
---
The maraudon run can be done with a warlock, its abit slower. (And requires better gear and knowledge.)
---
Good at guarding in AB, Best flag carrier, good at backdooring AV.  So, they are pretty strong in all the BGs really.  
---
They scale quite well in gear as healers too.  
---
They're also one of 2 classes that can do 2 raid roles.  Tank and Heal.   Their dps isn't too bad on the pirated realms either.  We will have to see how accurate that is though.
---
I mean the parrot is BiS though ;P
---
Use some common sense chief. Can you access servers? No. That means it’s over. If you have access to a stress test, you have access to them all.
---
I read this for the dead, our lost friends and family.
---
I know right ?
---
It would be as ridiculous as a complaint by a guy called Tigole Bitties.
---
My ADHD and indecision, visualized

[Me reading the title](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/73701-princess-old-model.jpg)
---
No problem man, happy to help this figure out with you as we can both learn something from it if we succeed! Somewhere in this post a guy informed me over the /cancelform macro and we made it work in the beta. That stuff is really useful :)
---
I miss my crusader mining pick
---
Mostly good information here.
---
The best bit of advise is to avoid doing what everyone else is doing.
---
Unless you're trying to speed level then play how you want. The recommendations most are making are based on fastest time to reach 60, not actually playing the game.
---
I believe the term you are looking for is “Snapshotting”. This was removed in WoD I believe, I’ll be glad to have it back in Classic.
---
It’s in the Classic client. There was an entire settings tab under audio for setting up voice chat and hotkeys. It’s definitely in Classic WoW.
---
IMO the ideal profession choice for players is engineering + 1 gold making profession. But you need crafters too in your guild so that's why I think healers that don't PVP should get a gold making + crafting profession. Healers really don't need sappers since they are often not in range(casters are in melee range when they aoe), it can still be useful to be engi as healer but not as much as others. The those healers, you would want 1 alchemist with flasks, 1 enchanter, 1-2 blacksmith &amp; 1 LW, with 1 of the engineers(preferably caster that doesn't pvp) goes goblin engi for crafts.
---
sappers are king
---
But theres 2 months left until release
---
But there is still 1 month left
---
But there is still a week left
---
But it just released give them time
---
But next patch in a few weeks itll be fixed by then
---
Wait - are there mages that are expecting tips for water in a group? I'd boot that little shithead so fast if they tried that on me...
---
I thought that as well but I came [across comments](https://imgur.com/bu6zc3z) on this [item](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18820/talisman-of-ephemeral-power) that suggest at least for some snapshotting wasn't in vanilla.
---
I believe that's exactly what I was looking for. Thank you sir
---
Why DE greens instead of vendoring them?
---
Oh, yeah, that was GUILD banks ... that was TBC?
---
So in vanilla, all you can do is create a character and use it's normal bank?
---
Divine Storm from WotLK! My favorite rendition of Ret in the game...Along with Lava Burst with Ele shams. (WotLK was my favorite expansion, by far)
---
I had it as a gnome rogue in vanilla - it was ridiculous.
---
I want to play enh shaman, but I dont want to be relegated to nightfall duty for 3 years
---
Classic beta servers. What is what. Status, News on stress test. Things and stuff

if you dont get it and try to become a serious raider...you will end up getting it and then understand how right i am
---
Magnetic Fields, *69 love songs* on endless repeat was my go to for grinding. I still can't hear that album without thinking of killing endless yeti swarms.
---
That's an interesting discussion I'll keep an eye on, thanks for sharing.
---
I don't know the exact numbers because I don't know if we can trust any of the spreadsheets, but I'd guess lowball at least 3k?
---
Yes but spanish people still make only 2% of the playerbase, so you'd sit on less than 1% I believe... Probably not enough to fill up a server, that's where I'd understand not creating a dedicated server, sadly
---
Not really, Blizzard bans that shit quickly.
---
whats rogue rotation like?
---
Wow I hope I don't get someone purposefully deceitful like you in my guild.
---
Have you? You got like 3 people trolled. Better luck next time, kid.
---
Yeah, its only like 300g to get it to to the point of sapper chargers which are required for some fights in AQ (vicidus) and are defintly helpful in BWL and Naxx... i recall them being mantatory for a fight in naxx but my memory is failing me as to which ones...

Also, y'know, the filthy tusk-less pointy ears.
---
Elves are for eating, not allying with.

It's the sleeves for the discs.

Like many others have said, I'm planning on leveling one character to duo with and another for solo. My buddy and I are rolling Pally/Warlock and when he's not on I'll take a break from the Pally and play my mage alt. Mage could outlevel the pally/duo, but I still consider the Pally my main since that's what I played in classic and intend to do most endgame with.
---
Wouldn't the fixed spines make them stand a bit taller? That would slightly change PvP depending on which graphics you are using. If a guy is standing behind a rock etc.
---
Based on pservers:
---
Arcanite CD goes for 10-15g on launch due to high demand from warriors. Afterwards it drops pretty heavily down to 5-7gold.
---
Mooncloth CD was really cheap like 8-12gold, does rise a lot upward to ZG due to people stockpiling mooncloth for bloodvine.
---
But economy is hard to predict, it will be different from what it was on pservers, but also different from how it was in vanilla. Only time will really tell.

"Purchasing WoW" isn't really a thing anymore. Anyone can play retail up to level 20 with account restrictions without paying anything for an unlimited amount of time. At any time you can just purchase a month of game time and you immediately unlock "retail WoW" which includes all game content except for the latest expansion. When your game time expires you can continue playing any characters under level 20 with the free to play restrictions (with the exception that if they were already in a guild they can stay in that guild and chat in it) but any characters over 20 get locked out. If you happen to have enough gold on a single realm across all characters to purchase a WoW Token the game will prompt you and ask if you want to buy a token and immediately consume it to resume your subscription.
---
Anyway, tl;dr: No, you don't have to buy WoW to play Classic. Just give Blizzard $15 for a sub on August 27 (or August 13 if you want to reserve a name).
---
Yeah, playing hybrid classes, I'm fully aware that I'm a plate wearing priest in raids. I'm fine with doing anything, but I want to enjoy the class as a whole and I want to try to come up with some new stuff on my own.
---
Shaman seems to outclass Paladin a lot so I may just end up going that route, I enjoyed it a lot on the stress test.
---
I mean he was probably just lying to you caus its a waste of CD to brez someone who got themselves killed right after walking back again.
---
Cries in South American.
---
Since TBC I have been alliance because of my friends. From my perspective horde have always been extremely ganky. This is why I will be joining them for classic haha!
---
There are better guards in AB and there's no real need to backdoor in AV.
---
Solo target healing is: Paladin &gt; Priest &gt; Druid &gt; Shaman
---
Multi-target healing is: Shaman &gt; Priest &gt; Druid &gt; Paladin
---
So no, they're not great healers. Only their utility spells and buffs save.
---
Druid tanks in raids is a niche thing, no serious guild is ever going to bother. They'll have a Warrior MT (superior in every way) and just have a Fury DPS slap on tank gear whenever an OT is needed.
---
Their DPS is the worst of all classes, except maybe Paladin and Shaman. Shadow Priest gets to take credit for Shadow Weaving on all the Warlocks, so their DPS is much higher.
---
Awesome thank you!
---
correct
---
My wife doesnt play either. I always wanted a girlfriend who plays games with me but after some years with my wife i think its better that she doesnt play with me. I think its better to have your own hobby so you have sometimes abit of freedom / time for yourself or with your friends. I dont like to be 24/7 with my wife. Maybe its just me but im happy with my situation 😁
---
Engi 100% if you're a hunter. otherwise it's neglible. But it's one of the best professions DPS wise for sure.
---
Hey guy's, you don't need a sub to post here.

(Unless they changed it again?)

But we've been trying to push for this for quite sometime, in hopes of blizzard giving us a RP-PVP server. Best regards Pintero.
---
Can’t wait to try that new Murloc class, too bad the only race you can roll one on is Murloc. Shame it only has one ability too, the text macro that allows you to say “wrrrbbbblllg”. Definitely needs some kind of nerf, at least in PvP
---
there are tons of addons that let you pick the color
---
who gives a shit lol
---
I suspect they were buffed in 2.3, when they cut leveling time they may have buffed reputations so that you would get roughly the same amount by the time you hit 60.
---
&gt; Shadow Protection potions are used by every player in the raid a minimum of once per attempt during Nefarian progress. Shadow Protection potion ingredients will jump significantly in price just prior to BWL.
---
They are not, if you are in a serious hardcore guild then perhaps, but any normal guild or casual wouldn't do this, the amount of people doing that as a full raid is not going to be substantial, and again I said you could stockpile them, I'm not against people that want to do that and sell them accordingly, its just not something I would do, hence why it was MY opinion on the subject.
---
&gt; Your claim about the tuning numbers on private servers is exceptionally bold. I won't disagree or agree with it, but I challenge you to provide a substantiated source to back up your claim.
---
Nostalrius devs have confessed that they overtuned the numbers on purpose to make it harder, you simply have to google it.
---
&gt; With regards to actually selling the potions, your analysis is completely incorrect regardless of the "tuning" of the bosses. With your logic, all potions, buff foods, world buffs, and other optional items eg. sappers etc. are completely useless because they're not necessary to do the content. And yet, a full BWL geared raid will still stack up Sulfuron Harbinger and use 15 Goblin Sappers at once. Why? It's faster and easier.
---
I never said they're useless, I said most people wont be using them hence why you should focus your economy somewhere else.
---
Food is used everywhere, sapper charges are mostly for PvP climbers and rankers, world buffs are truly not needed and a waste of time, you could clear the raid without them, without spending the time getting them all, its only viable once raids are on farm and you're speedrunning ALL of them in a row, not for single raids that end afterwards.
---
&gt; Good guilds
---
Good guilds are not the norm, people are going to be new, private server people are going to shake in their boots when they find out all the changes to their precious world.
---
Only the good guild veterans are going to be ahead of the curve, those are the only people that spend gold accordingly on said consumeables.
---
People can sell whatever they want, I just dont recommend it, that's how opinions and guides work, just like you trying to correct me now, without any sort of evidence to back it up, except anecdotal evidence of your opinions. (Its called hypocrisy)
---
&gt; You think classic with 2.5k player "layers" will be worse than a private server with 8-12k player layers? On top of that, why does that even matter? It's simply presented as an option, and indeed it is a well known, well tested, and well aged option that has been leveraged by mages since 2004. It would be absurd to make no mention of it simply because you think there will be too much competition.
---
Layers are going to be removed after phase 1, that's all I have to say about that.
---
&gt; You are wrong. Dire Maul North tribute running was discovered by Hunters towards the tail end of vanilla proper and it is not a private server exclusive method. It's viability at lower gear levels remains to be seen, but it's still an original classic gold making method.
---
Then I will stand corrected if it is indeed correct, we will see in phase 2.
---
I wont respond to this again.
---
Every time my hype starts to come down, I see something on this sub that makes me completely reconsider my class choice.

---
&gt; Ten years from now, we'll be telling stories about opening day to our grandchildren.

Shit, I gotta get to breeding ASAP, like 15 years ago.
---
I dont understand this argument. "Your values explicitly stated in your post dont align with mine, so why are you worrying about it? Theres other parts to the game that I care about, and those should be your focus."
---
fan of knives. In all of classic I hated not being able to help AoE in diremaul, ony, bwl, etc. But when you could fan of knives and apply poison to the targets, that was a big change to rogue pve usefulness. I might not be as fun as cloak but it sure was satisfying to feel useful and to be able to stop pretending that blade fury was a decent aoe....
---
BF is amazing but 2 targets is hardly aoe in my book.
---
Not a spell, but haste affecting Mind Flay and the GCD is what made Shadow Priest fun.
---
I remember loving this one back in the day, but having watched it again a few weeks ago I kinda' hate it. Blood elf protag, because of course it's a fucking blood elf. Bunch of wuxia shit including blocking bullets with swords. At least the song's still pretty nifty, I suppose.

None of which is to say it's a poorly-made video, of course; quite the opposite, I'm just an ornery old^1 fantasy racist who hates the idea of elves in the Horde.

Are you done with killing mobs in the landscape just because you dinged 60? You're not going to kill EPL bats or Azshara Satyrs for income?
---
With this build, when exactly do you SS in dungeon/raid?
---
Always wanted to be a rotting bear carcass as a forsaken druid
---
Your icon will still be Red ;) -- Nice work tho
---
DPS isn’t everything my friend!
---
I got exalted in Vanilla without doing a bunch of cloth quests, but it is more trouble than it’s worth.  You have to basically do every quest at exactly (quest level = your level - 5), because at 6 levels and higher you take a higher and higher penalty on reputation gains, just like xp.
---
You have to do it like that because the goal is to maximize rep gains, which means still getting full rep gains for the other factions for the 10% spill over.  Of course, this means most of your time is spent running all over the damn planet because you aren’t doing quests zone by zone, you’re doing them level by level.  
---
Even then, I want to say I only managed with Thunder Bluff and Orgrimmar.
---
I got mixed feelings reading these comments. 
---
99% of people upvote this to help the community get a server, but in the end how many are actually gonna play this? What if it ends up as a tiny tiny population who got their serv by getting support here when it's not justified to have a dedicated server? 
---
I'm legit asking the question, cause I'm not sure this is justified considering it is mostly stories about a handful of players over 15 years that make people wanna defend this idea...
---
Nope. The optimal strat to get back to the boss is to literally run past the enemies, which is entirely do-able
---
I hope my guild has tons of people like you. The type of person who tells people that they have to play a certain way to progress, then gets triggered when we only agreed to it so we could get some sweet ass gear so that we can play the way that *we* want to. I’m karma for all the feral druids, Ret paladins, and enhancement shamans that people like you tell to kick rocks. Deal with it.
---
Look at a Visciduos speedkill in AQ40. Wait until the boss breaks into a bunch of little globs. Everyone stacks up and pops a goblin Sappers charge. Boom. The most obnoxious boss of vanilla dead.
---
I dont want to watch a whole video to explain the /camp difference.  Why cant you just write it?
---
they said they will have new names
---
Plus HoTs don't stack on a single target, and the mechanism for one HoT overwriting/extending another is "quirky" (broken).    
---
Meaning even if you did bring a Resto Druid for MotW, you'd only bring one total since the second or third has major diminishing returns. A 40 man raid might have exactly one Resto Druid and one Feral/OT Druid for Leader of the Pack.    
---
That gives you two combat Rez, two Innervates, Mark of the Wild, and Leader of the Pack.
---
Yeah you don´t really get to choose what you bring at that level. You run with the classes you have.
---
Yes, nobody has every thought of this name before.
---
This number is stupid, FR and DE are way bigger than that on their own.
---
That is something, thank you, but there is no overview or news place or anything? Welp.
---
Make me a healthstone and go back to spamming shadowbolt while you ride my buffs to mediocre DPS.
---
You chose some interesting builds.. good luck finding a guild to take you for those builds
---
Half of this sub in a nutshell

Shadow priests that can’t manage threat don’t do great DPS in raids* ftfy

You're tieing up my characters time when I could he headed somewhere else. 
---
Gl making and friends with that toxic entitled attitude.
---
And just to be clear, this is you asking for water outside of a group, not asking the party mage for water.
---
1-10 speedruns are utterly useless but still quite interesting, thanks!
---
Taking every available quest in teldrassil on the beta I got about 3000 Darnassus reputation just from the 1-10 area.
---
Pick Pocket farming is going to be garbage in Classic. The vendor values for a lot of the items, especially Rogue Diaries, is incredibly inflated on PServers.
---
Lol, oh man, how would we have ever known unless he told us? News flash: We all know druids suck. Nobody is surprised.
---
Playing a Druid is like getting 70% of a Rogue and Warriors kit. You have an answer to everything, but never the best answer to anything. Sometimes you feel like if you just rolled a different class, the situation you're in would be easier.
---
The point he makes about gear is a good one. It feels way better to gear up other classes. Each new piece just feels like your getting more out of it.
---
Any insight you can give? How was Paladin, Shaman, and Rogue? I leveled a shaman to 10 on the stress test and had a blast.
---
Yeah, you need tps and some heals to go with it
---
I think that's what hes assuming.  Everyone else knows its asking for water in a city from a random mages is what the topic was about.
---
They'll be releasing the names of the servers prior to release for organizational reasons so no sweat.
---
exactly, the vid showing the bug is with changing targets so its not working the same as in classic, if you find examples with a single target please post it, delay or not.
---
Normal experience has taught me that the tank isn't going to pull if healer is OOM or even below 50% mana the DPS on the other hand..... yeah the DPS.....
---

---
you had spam last week becuase a lot of new people got the client for the us open stress test, it was mentioned then that there would be a EU one.
---
The "spam" died down because nothing was happening until Tuesday this week where people again out of the blue were getting the client
---
So, again...this has not been there a while, it's a different thing and you are just lumping it all together because you are being lazy.
---
Nothing displays decadent wealth like the most expensive glowy enchant on a lvl 1 bank alt :D
---
Life of the average enhance shaman.
---
Protip: Roll as a Chad Elemental Shaman. You can safe spot and pick off alliance in BB with those scrub non-elite guards.  And also not get killed 1v1 at 40 with elemental mastery.
---
I actually logged in to test it a moment ago. As an example, the starting orc quest (the very first quest you do) gives you 50 rep. But if you do it on a higher level character, you get **5**. So, if you wait until a quest is grey, you get **10%** of the reputation value.
---
People still speed run Ocarina to this day. Who are you to tell people how to play Classic or what it is about?
---
So anyone who tries to play well or play better in raid this week than last week is to be laughed at? Do you think this game is only fun if noone tries? What are you even saying?
---
Nope
---
I am playing a shaman in classic. Really good in pvp and can at least heal in dungeons and raids pretty well. Unfortunately the dps specs are not really playable
---
Yep, just don't attack the guards directly.
---
Leeway works to the benefit of the Hunter as well. Trap/Shot DR sucks.
---
Check out Dr. Melderon’s videos to get an idea of the different specs and then think about what that would be like while leveling. 
---
The big thing is that it doesn’t matter what spec you play pre 40 they all have a similar play style. You want to be efficient with mana and front load your spells and auto attack a lot. You don’t want to be drinking if you still have hp. 
---
Once you get 40 you can choose to just lightning things down and drink a lot if you wish.
---
I'm prepping for it tomorrow. FFXIV Shadowbringers Early Access trying to log in at launch.
---
There really should NOT be any layers in STV, at all.
---
Sometimes the enchanting materials are worth more than the vendor price of a green item.
---
Green items will disenchant for X number of enchanting materials and what they yield is based on the level requirement of the item.
---
Example: Item A is level 21, when disenchanted, it will yield 1 - 3 dust.  Item A sells to vendor for 20 silver, but dust sells on the auction house for 10 silver each.  It is possible to get 30 silver value out of an item if you get 3 dust, but it can be a gamble.
---
This gets interesting when items get close to the top of their disenchant level, an item in the lower end that yields Strange Dust might yield only 1 - 2 dust, but an item on the higher end of the Strange Dust bracket can yield up to 5 dust when disenchanted.
---
You just have to do the math, if 5 dust sells for 50 silver and an item sells to vendor (or on the AH) for only 30 or 40 silver, it is best to disenchant it.
---
It is all part of playing the market using a bigger picture. You can often find green items to buy on the AH that can disenchant for double their price or more if you are lucky. Buy them, disenchant, and then sell the materials for profit.
---
I did this for a long while back in vanilla, and did quite well.
---
Back then in vanilla days , Saturday mornings through early afternoon were the best times to pick, as younger kids would just go hunt and then come back to town and dump everything on the AH without checking prices.
---
Just find a guild that will let you raid as shadow you obnoxious prick. I don't care if people raid as shadow. Take your victim complex elsewhere.
---
Ha! Yeah. I didn't realize SurveyMonkey put results behind a paywall. Someone else tried again using a different platform and got even more respondents. Here is that thread with results!

---
Seriously though I don't understand why they keep ignoring us, we early got enough people to have at least one realm with medium pop
---
I mean if warlock is your favorite, you're honestly lucky. In demand, probably won't be many, sick DPS, one of the few classes that can PvP and PvE viably in the same spec, etc. Warlock isnt a bad choice at all. Might be the best well rounded choice in terms of strength, demand, and population.
---
Alternatively, 
---
&gt;STVietnam, the main reason to play on a PvP server.
---
But I'm glad you can identify the fact you are not a pvp player and roll pve instead of crying endlessly that you don't enjoy the warzone on a pvp server.
---
According to your crappy logic, I should be able to run a bot then, right? It’s just a third party program that allows me to play a character without actually playing it. It’s not cheating because I’m paying for the sub and shit. Multiboxxing is no different than botting unless they’re individually controlling each character. Go ahead, convince me that it’s different. I’ll bet you can’t, and that’s why your only argument is “you’re salty.”
---
I do have vague memories about alot of skeletons in Hyjal!
---
Never said they were great healers or that they were the best anything except flag running.  I said they scaled well as a healer. 
---
&gt; , no serious guild is ever going to bother.
---
You have that backwards.  Every serious guild will have one, because they're like gear dumpsters.  You only invite 1-3 druids to raid, so there's plenty of druid gear laying around, and some items are itemized in such a way that only Feral druids would want it.   Also, it's a lot easier to gear 7 warrior tanks for 4 hoursemen than 8.  
---
&gt;  They'll have a Warrior MT 
---
The druids are Offtanks that can switch to heal, dps, and decursing.
---
&gt; Their DPS is the worst of all classes,
---
On the pirated realm, this isn't true for the early raids.  Realistically, you should be comparing them to offtanks anyways, since that's what they're primarily in the raid for.
---
&gt; Shadow Priest gets to take credit for Shadow Weaving on all the Warlocks, so their DPS is much higher.
---
Spriest don't need to dps to do that role, as I said.   Their personal dps is quite laughable, so it's almost pointless for them to even try.
---
Just read this and teared up
---
What is the story behind that name?
---
Back in the day I used to screenshot all of my trades right after we both press the trade button so I can prove later to the GM my stolen mats. Cringe.
---
Iv never been robbed though.
---
This is excellent use of Ed, Edd &amp; Eddy.
---
The addition of misdirection in BC nearly made me into the worst kind of hunter, got my patience back quickly though.
---
No need for name calling, it’s only a game.
---
I played almost all of vanilla, and I don't know a single person that was able to buy another race's mount simply by leveling in the other zones. If this was the case, we'd have seen way more undead riding raptors I think, as we had plenty of alts that leveled in those paths strictly because they liked the questing better.
---
You have to grind cloth - there's no two ways about it, since its unlikely you'll even be exalted with your own race's rep when you hit 60.
---
Can other classes do it too?
---
Technically I did that the first time WoW was released, but yeah. I'm a pleb now :'(

A bank alt in Thunder Bluff is the best location for a bank alt.

Facts.

When removing Russia (because they're getting their own realms), characters on German realms account for 27.84% of all characters ever created on EU realms. Similarly, all characters created on French realms account for 12.23%. [Source](https://realmpop.com/eu.html).
---
When looking at active characters, German realms account for 20.79% of the EU playerbase and French realms account for 6.66%. [Source](http://www.warcraftrealms.com/eu_realmstats.php).
---
Funnily enough, I was a tauren druid. Switched to BElf Paladin in TBC until cata where I stopped playing altogether. 
---
With all that said, only reason I was a Tauren druid to start with was because my friends were horde. In WC3 I was a Night Elf main, which is 100% where my loyalty to the race comes from.
---
I will take that as a compliment, ty.
---
I can't speak accurately for Mooncloth but I have a great deal of experience when it comes to Arcanite.
---
Arcanite is always a fairly lucrative source of income at any time of an expansion but there is a small bubble that happens around the time the first Lionheart Helm and Titanic Leggings plans are discovered.
---
During the window when those items are discovered the value of Arcanite will easily double in value, occasionally tripling or quadrupling depending how hardcore the playerbase of the server is at the time in regards to minmaxing there characters.
---
After these two innitial bubbles happen Arcanite with settle into a fairly average price serverwide, and as the demand goes down and supply goes up it eventually becomes sadly fairly cheap.
---
...did you not bother to read any of the blue posts? It covers stress test schedules, news about beta phases, etc.
---
You must play alliance
---
Well I'm definitely tired of playing a priest. All the buffing, drinking, paladins sniping heals, being main tank in battlegrounds.. Looking forwards to playing warlock again and yell at the tanks to do more threat hehe.
---
RP shouldn't exist without PVP.  It wouldn't at all make sense if you were to come across the enemy faction in your own territory and not have the option to oust 'em.
---
If you’re hoping to get ahead of the pack I wouldn’t say that’s useless at all.
---
Could be true for the same target.
---
However looking at the videos from vanilla, the current beta seems different for auto attacking 1 target then auto shotting an alternative one.
---
Your UI looks like some old lady's Internet Explorer with 25 addon toolbar viruses

i don't remember, but clearly looks like i focused EK over kalimdor.

---
Those guides are all based on private server data, which is using post-TBC reputation values (yes, even the vanilla private servers). The long and short of it is that in vanilla and Classic you get about 50% the reputation those guides say you should get.
---
And you're sure this person is EU because?
---
Extra Nexus Crystals for the real classes &gt; gear dumpsters.
---
Like 50% of the players will pve server.  Maybe more.
---
druids are great healers. they shine in that role.
---
Yeah, meaning next expansion takes place IN CLASSIC and players can “port” a retail character to some partially formed state where they do begin at endgame but are required to pass some somewhat lengthy timewalk / proving grounds like hybrid content in the place of the full classic 1-60 experience (maybe a 1 days 8 hours played type deal rather than the 4-6 days). Finally a boost that isn’t garbage and not a stupid macro transaction. 
---
Imagine that. Every retail player re represented as a classic character, even the new classes. A brand new expansion representing the older game aesthetic. No new level up bs. No garbage class and spec ruin. Just great content that is the next chapter in the story of gaming as seen through the eyes of the 2006 gameplay / co op vision. 
---
I’m gonna imagine it. With fury.

If they're worth a shit they will be.

Quest chain in Ashenvale gives you an item that turns you into a furbolg. You can choose not to complete the questand keep the item.

I had a chinese warlock dude run my hunter through a few times back in the day.

Man that was an interesting time. We could barely communicate but he was very friendly and would give me some of the shards since I could help him and sped things up a little. Was only 14-15 though, he was definitely carrying me.

Just because Retail WoW isn't the game YOU want to play, doesn't make it a failure. BFA has already turned over more revenue than Classic ever will.

This is some clean meme work

Was against the deathknight understudies who took like 2000% extra damage when razuvious died.

I’m going through the Beta completing nearly every single Alliance faction quest, including all Darnassus rep quests as well as quests that give spillover Darnassus rep, and I didn’t reach revered until level 33 (I’m level 35 now). Reaching exalted by 40 is not going to be possible.

Paladins are the best PvE healers in Naxx and provide the best buffs in the game for PvE. So I wouldn't say they are outclassed. Warriors are the best DPS in the game and the best tank in the game.
---
Warlocks don't do as much dps as a mage but provide a lot of utility and curses and by Naxx can be on par with mages.
---
You're actually a moron, wow.

Hey, so the game has been around for 15 years, Blizzard had a lengthy lawsuit (and won) against a company that had a bot (wowglider) back in the day, and it's very clear what their stance is on botting is.  In the same 15 years, thousands and thousands of people have multiboxed, and unless they were doing something else that a single player/single character would also be punished for, Blizzard has taken no action against them.
---
Here's a link with Blue posts regarding the matter since you can't get it through your dense skull that Blizzard is, and has been totally okay with multiboxing for a long time.

Paladin being boring to level is sort of true, but its way overblown. Its fun in a different way, but 1-20 is definitely not the best experience. I would say if you don't like the class aesthetic of being a holy knight, it won't be fue. Once you get Seal or Command it gets way way way way more fun. Its like a fun little slot machine.
---
You also never die ever, unless you're playing very recklessly. Your bubble is on a 5min CD and will give you enough to run away and reset. As you level the duration of the bubble gets longer and it just gets easier.
---
The bubble is the one thing I miss playing other classes. Paladin is also a very strong in its class aesthetic, you feel like a holy knight. Its awesome.
---
Shaman is great, but dropping totems can be a pain and some people hate having to do it. Earthbind kiting is straight broken. It costs essentially 0 mana, and its an aoe Hamstring. You essentially just take somewhere between 30-50% less damage against melee mobs.
---
Astral Recall and Reincarnation is amazing utility. No more GY runbacks. Hearthstones are a 60Minute CD. It cuts down on a lot of running around. 
---
Rogue is a lot of fun, but suffers from downtime like Warrior does. Lots of bandaging and eating. Can struggle sometimes against pulling an extra mob, especially early on. Later not so much when specced right. But they just straight murder mobs, its so satisfying to just destroy an enemy in a blink of an eye; compared to a Paladin or a Shaman anyway.
---
They have lots of ways to get out of bad situations as well with sprint, evasion, and most importantly vanish. Furthermore stealth is the best thing in the game in terms of solo play on a PvP server. 
---
There were so many times where I didn't get instagibbed by a passing skull player, or 3v1ed by a group around my level passing through.

---
&gt;   If you're running in a guild, it's not a "loss" when your friend gets  their tier set over you, it's a win for the guild, a win for the raid  group, and a win for you because now you have 1 less person who needs  that item in the future.  Celebrate success, not personal gain. 
---
This right here is the most crucial information.  Gear was so Limited in Vanilla that raiding entirely for your own personal satisfaction and improvement left alot of people super bitter and frustrated, typically not lasting long in any one guild after they received a piece of gear because they would know then next time they saw a drop that was to go to them could be weeks or months down the line.

They're at best 3rd and since HoTs don't stack, you never want more than one of them.

Interesting idea, but one hell of a stretch
---
I remember this being the coolest video to my 17 year old self. So cringy but awesome.
---
Well you said you were anti Horde(ing) 
---
for the hordeing!
---
That’s how I feel. An extension of all that was awesome in classic, minus the abandoning element that new levels and similar concepts brought. Just more game, new challenges, added depth as players got to make more choices in the rpg sense of their character’s place and skill in the society of players and enemies/bosses.
---
Nice work! 
---
Just a thought on the rogue section. It has been proven through the beta that private servers had a lot of values wrong when it comes to pick pocket farming. I.e rogue's diary doesn't sell for 45s each, but 2s 50c. The rate of lockboxes is much lower and the overall money value that mobs carry around is also lower.
---
Still, it's not a "bad" farm. But not nearly as lucrative as it was on pservers. I would take any gold per hour estimate from private server guides and at least half it.
---
I pull all the time when a healers below 50%. I tell them to keep drinking until I hit 50%.
---
No story really, I just found it to be funny in the moment with a vulgar name on a serious account.
---
1700 now. Damn. C'mon Blizz :(
---
It wrecks in pvp, but I am going to use it for raiding.  Show them all that it can be done.
---
So, Shadow Hunter Vosh'Gajin drops the gloves, and we'd also kill Voone to try for the Talisman of Evasion. We had a fast route memorized to go in, kill the bosses, and leave to reset. We did it over and over to get the gloves, which later could be upgraded to purple.
---
If you want to get ahead of the pack, you need to pick and choose your quests and get out of the newbie zone and start grinding as quickly as possible.
---
People would advertise wanting to sell/buy things like "your mats + 5g".
---
If you thought that was too much you'd ignore them or haggle.
---
The problem is telling a guild you're going to be a healer, heal the  quit when you get the gear. Just tell them you want to play shadow.
---
Ill test it om beta when I get home.
---
Oom
---
Paladins outclassed? They are one of the strongest healers, if not the strongest healer. They just need some good crit and they'll never go oom with quick heals that snipe everyone else. 
---
Druids are really good too but they are just really hard to pull off and they don't stack very well. 
---
Also don't look at the dps/hps meters of the top guilds if you're not gonna be in a top guild. A feral dps won't hold a candle to a rogue/warrior in a top guild, but in a mid-tier guild they absolutely can.
---
yeah the tank is rarely the issue
---
Obviously not for progression raiding, but I plan to spend a lot of time as a DPS spec. I have a Rogue on retail so I really want something different in Classic. I guess I really need to see what's unplayable for myself but I feel like I need to try. Lol
---
He grees, the A and the Disa combined for +1 plus -1 to sum up to 0.
---
You’ve convinced me.
---
You could play resto in raids and when you have the current tier on farm and have some gear you can switch to enhancement for PvP. It's the most boring PvE spec 99% of what you do is auto-attack.
---
Obviously elemental is far better for both PvP and PvE but if you really want to enh it's up to you. I just wouldn't recommend doing it in PvE if you want to do something more then right click a mob and go afk.
---
I’ve reported you both for your name calling (what, are we back in elementary school? Lol) and your encouragement of using cheats. Have a nice day.
---
Imagine it!!!
---
I have played Paladin since early 05. I have tanked since BC prepatch. I will be playing Warrior in Classic as I plan on tanking for my crew. Setting expectations for what you want to do in game is important. IMO
---
Hybrids are hybrids in Classic. If you expect to Tank or DPS as a hybrid expect to have to work 10 times as hard and still won’t be as good as your guild mates. But Druids/Paladins/Shamans are great as healers in Classic. Paladins at BWL level are the best HPS class in the game. We are starting with 1.12 talents/build. Hybrids had a massive overhaul in. 1.9 which made their healing output way better. 
---
No class is useless. Some shine more than others in different roles. Play what is fun for you. But know what your class is good at and what it isn’t good at. If you do that you will have a better more rewarding experience. 
---
The writing is on the wall now. We know what classes can and can’t do well. When vanilla was new we didn’t know what classes would get changed/buffed/nerfed. With Classic we know what we are getting. If they “balanced” classes the Classic community would lose their minds. 
---
End of the day, play what sounds fun but know where your class shines and where it doesn’t and set expectations accordingly.

Even though HoT's don't override, there are 40 raid members who could be needing rejuvs. I don't see the DR in having 2 at all, even though Classic isn't very AoE intensive.
---
Those people aren't using consumables to their full extent.   You can also downrank as necessary.   Fights aren't lasting 10 minutes like they used to.   
---
Besides, worst case scenario, it doesn't work in later raids, and I use my t2.5 to raid heal.
---
Stack spirit and don't waste mana on shocks, just melee with the others. 
---
Everything should be dying fast enough that he should only have to heal every couple of pulls and if he places totems properly he won't have to drop them every pull.
---
I’m either going Hunter, my 1st choice, or Mage. I would like to PVP and maybe raid, but sure how far I’ll get. I don’t want to be over reliant on others.
---
Id probably go Dwarf/Hunter with Skinning and Herbalism to level, and dropping Skinning for Engineering late game. Will level other secondary professions while I go. I do want to use guns, it seems like hunters have to switch to arrow based weapons late game. Is switching a big deal? And how hard would it be to find a raiding spot?
---
If Mage I’ll probably go Gnome, seems pretty cool with lots of utility, but I remember being really bored with them early game when I dabbled in the past. Prob frost spec, not sure on professions. What would be good professions? And is it really hard to gear mages?
---
I have 70-80 ms to US yarrharr servers. From Sweden.

I did (and still doing) it on a feral druid right after I dinged 60 (p-server tho, so not 100% sure if it will work in classic)
---
Princess is very very easy, it just takes a while.
---
The croc requires some proper bash timing to make sure the bleed falls off.
---
The goblin is annoying because of the fear, so clearing the snake pack and elemental patrol infront of him is a good idea.
---
Takes around 10 to 15 min, so slower then a hunter, but better gear could make it go faster.
---
Sure you could tank UBRS. But you'll be rage starved unless you do huge pulls and glue all the mobs to you.  Prot is not very good outside of raids in Vanilla.
---
it was faster even on pservers, nobody bothered though
---
It seems really silly for Blizzard to force RPers into a PVP zone. You would think after that incident with the funeral thing that they would know better.
---
So I won't be able to get it for my bank alt for like 8-9 months? Rip

Crusader strike in BC. As a pally venturing into outland I felt like a total baller not auto attacking every mob to death. Definitely would've been useful in vanilla. Shamans got stormstrike so I felt left out..
---
Lost one of my best friends during Wrath. He taught me how to tank on a Death Knight, and so much more. Rest in peace, Zinglish. Loktar Ogar!
---
You can tank UBRS in greens and quest blues.

Had so much fun in battlegrounds
---
Boom! Thank you. I’ll definitely be stockpiling as much as I can to take advantage of this. This should be a given, regardless of the differences in economy. Rare Recipe discovery pumping the price
---
Probably the scourge invasion event that preceded the release of Naxx
---
I feel like Blood Elves and Jewelcrafting just made Vanilla zones so much more fun. TBC really perfected Vanilla areas (Excluding rendering the Vanilla endgame gear less useful)
---
The fact that you could make lv 10 Rings was a nice touch.
---
And gems/sockets was great. Jewelcrafting implemented into the game nicely.
---
Let us know! This mod looks great
---
I just want blizzard to say they are giving it to us.
---
I loved Karazhan as shadow
---
Just play what you want, you shouldn't care so much what other people play/say.

Perfect. Thank you. Excellent response. 
---
I am interested in hoarding commodities, but only ones that will at least double my investments would be worth my time because of the reason you gave (lack of liquidity).
---
sure, 3rd best on alliance. 2nd best single target on horde. plus you're not hot'ing everyone. you have your healing assignments. dunno how it's gonna be in classic, but in vanilla finding a non shadow priest who was GOOD and had time to raid was difficult. i'd take a druid in a heartbeat. i just don't agree with a blanket term of they "suck".

Would keeping up two characters be especially difficult?
---
All I want in life is to be an orc warrior tank. But all my friends are going gnome/dwarf so I'm rolling a gnome mage in order to play with them
---
Pretty sure the elites are a pserver thing and last boss of tribute would charge in Vanilla.
---
My username is my character name, and I’m on an old RP server, my locks name was Inthecloset, which got flagged and I changed it to Srslystoned, which it has been for the last two years, no issues.
---
I think they only enforce the rules if other players report a name, there doesn’t seem to be any other explanation.
---
Sorry I thought I was being funny. I actually really like that some people try non-optimal specs just because that's what they want to play. I might end up doing that with my rogue too.
---
You take a druid when you have no other option. That is the definition of suck.
---
Thanks
---
Ret is a unique experience, your leveling experience with be slow and grueling as you find yourself slowing doing quests and if you ever do a dungeon at any level you will be immediately asked 'you a healer?'.
---
But aside from those facts and the fact that you will be healing in raids unless your guild is very open minded about hybrid's but Ret at max level can make you a scary force to be reckoned with.
---
ZG when it releases in Classic will be your's and every other Ret paladins best friend when it comes to gearing as it will be your, well not first, but at least best avenue to gearing up for Ret.
---
The place offer's enough Plate, Mail, Leather DPS gear one a 3 day reset that you can quickly pick and choose an entire set of gear in only a few weeks.
---
Also on a side note easily one of the best and most underlooked 2H weapons for Ret paladins comes from ZG.  Everyone and their mother wants Zin'rohk and don't get me wrong for a Ret paladin it is a great pickup, but it's not the best Weapon from the place for a ret paladin.
---
Halberd of Smiting is easily on of the best Ret weapons in the game largely due the the high damage proc chance ability that coupled with Seal of Command and could cause the weapons proc to proc Seal of Command which then had a chance to proc the weapons proc again meaning a damage spike capable of oneshoting cloth and leather opponents in PvP.
---
So would it be better to stockpile mooncloth until ZG, then start selling cooldowns? Or the other way around?
---
I’d place my bets on the dwarf priest having the overweight gf/“mediocre” life over anyone playing a female night elf or human any day. The sheer fact that they care more about aesthetics and enjoying their race instead of min maxing and getting super elitist over a video game is evidence enough. If you enjoy dwarves, or you are okay sacrificing aesthetics to play the game at a high level, fine, but no one rolls a night elf or human priest just to “accept mediocrity”—they do it because it looks a whole lot better and can be more enjoyable outside of the 3 or so encounters FW actually matters.
---
HoTs just aren't useful in practice in WoW vanilla healing. Priests/Pallys/Shamans put out a lot of spot/raid healing in 5 seconds. A HoT that only ticks twice in 6 seconds and need to tick for 9 seconds to get any sort of efficiency is very rarely worth casting.  
---
9 seconds is a very long time in a vanilla raid when you're talking about healing.
---
How dare you join a guild as a healer, heal for them, then leave the guild when you get sick of healing and they refuse to bring you as DPS!
---
Seriously... you think people shouldn’t be able to leave a guild that doesn’t want them? Lmao
---
Mage/paladin has good synergy for AoE farming.  Depending on what part of the game and how many mobs we are talking about, the paladin can tank the mobs while the mage blizzards/flimestrikes/arcane explosion. Or you can go for a kiting set up, where the paladin is there to keep things safe with heals, salvation/cleanse to keep the mage mobile.  Blessing of protection will allow the mage to keep casting while being immune to spell damage.
---
Depends if the guild made special efforts to gear the player, thinking he would stay.
---
ofc !
---
I mean they could release them today but you're still going to have 2 weeks at least, should be more than enough to decide on.
---
Almost all big streamers will be on US. The language barrier won't exist there. The player base will be noob friendly. I could go on but the point is made
---
Is your character a warrior ? - check, then it can.
---
But you have to consider that there is a lack of gold in the economy due to everyone buying epic mounts. There’s got to be a “Sweet Spot” between people getting Epic Mounts and rising inflation/supply.

There was a good amount up until recently If you knew the hotspots or had connections. Much of the RPPVP community I knew died with the removal of PvP realms.

The looks are part of the advantage, because not only did you kill someone, but you killed someone as a pink pigtailed gnome girl for added embarrassment.

I did not expect seeing the Emiya meme in /r/classicwow
---
Yeah# it's definitely a reactive approach to naming restrictions, rather than a proactive one. GMs won't change the names unless they are reported.
---
Taken in TBC by lvl 60 players?
---
Because you can farm 70g+ an hour there. And it’s very consisted and uncontested. It’s easy mode farming to get your 100% mount.
---
Because the batching wasn’t simulated and it was an actual limitation of the old server. The delay is from the large batch window not the client.
---
I'm also hoping for RP-PvP
---
if this happens, i'm rolling an UD rogue and roleplaying a 24 hrs a day redridge ganker
---
I agree. I would play on that server.
---
I rerolled my Human Rogue in the beta when the cap increased to 40 to check a Darnassus reputation leveling route.
---
I went to Teldrassil at level 6 and did all the quests that give Darnassus rep in Teldrassil/Darnassus, Darkshore, Ashenvale, the BFD instance quests, Stonetalon Mountain and the first few quests in Feralas.  I also did the Wool/Silk/Runecloth deliveries.
---
To my knowledge I only missed the Alchemy quest you mentioned, a rare spawn quest in Teldrassil (Blackmoss the Fetid) and the quest from the Wailing Caverns item drop.
---
I still have a couple quests in Feralas to do and there a few of them that unlock at 41+ so i can't do them in the beta at the current level cap.
---
Most of the quests give around 100 Darnassus rep. Some give 75, some give 150. There are also a few quests that give reputation to all human base factions (usually around 250).
---
At level 40 i am at 4828/21000 Revered with Darnassus.
---
So as you can see i think  it's quite doable to get Exalted with Darnassus by level 60 by doing a few Runecloth deliveries. Not sure how many would be needed but the quests still give quite a lot of reputation. Not as much as private servers which i believe are based on a TBC patch, but still doable.
---
If you really want a cat mount it think it's quite doable.
---
That only holds true if your hoard the gold and don't keep reinvesting it.
---
I suppose I should revise it to say value will be highest, not prices.
---
I remember the elites being there back in retail vanilla, was in one of the patch to break farming, but I'm not 100% sure on that.
---
DM tribute is still soloable with charge, see

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtdik-lF1ik
---
Orc Priest would be pretty cool. Maybe their racial spell would be something that improves the attack power of the target and called "Drums of War" or something.
---
Yeah those posts always seemed insane to me. There were even people planning to get the frostsabre at level 40 and I was just wondering how on earth it was ever possible to get that reputation. Even at level 60 I don't remember being more than halfway past revered and this was with the main rep of that faction (oggrimar for horde).
---
A lot of quests from NPCs unaffiliated will give reputation with the main faction. I don't see how it was ever possible to get that much Darnassus rep.
---
Surely I'm not the only weirdo that just listens to the music in-game.
---
I am sure they can, just wont be nearly as optimal.
---
oh dont worry we will have a warrior offtank spam wing clip lol 
---
but seriously I understand enhance is probably the worst raiding spec
---
Who drew this?
---
you can tank UBRS just fine as non prot. if you ARE going to be prot though, you definitely need to pickup 5/5 defiance for the threat gen. i'd get rid of anticipation and improved shield wall.
---
also, aren't they gonna make it 15 man ubrs? we'd run that with 2 tanks.
---
Atrocious.
---
Especially if you're tauren, going into that venture co. mine at all is a giant waste of time.
---
Ah, Stormscale. The only thing worse than the Horde to Alliance ratio is how many times you switched guilds.
---
Which makes sense, since not everything is gonna be in the name creation filter, especially where alt characters can be used to slip profanity into a name. But I remember friends back in the day (BC/LK) that got name flagged within 24hrs on to servers.
---
While I can guarantee you that every live server has ALWAYS had at least on mage named Raistlin, I high clearly breaks naming conventions (popular fantasy character names)
---
I...I am sorry for your experience. Please, if we can do anything for you just tell us.
---
How come ?
---
You could just play a priest or warrior, if it is bothering you.
---
But to be honest, your warlock issues will not bother you.

Barely anybody plays them, and it still feels like you aren't wanted in premades till wsg weekend rolls around. Then everybody is your best friend.

Extremely easy to get into a mediocre guild that likes to stack them. Hard to get into a top end guild that already filled their two slots.
---
I think anyone who has beaten Sekiro has had the phrase burned into their memory.

Looks good. But you need 2/5 supression until you get some gear with hit.

For druid I really like mass root, ursols vortex and wild growth.
---
I mean Moonguard is pretty much the king of RP I think, but it's just an RP realm. Not RPPVP

Most average guilds will need to learn and adapt new things in Naxx. Especially for 4HM and KT.

you saved it for a post that will get removed

smart stuff

&gt;The sexual tension between the two rogues was always palpable too.

on god the only thing that was missing was one pinning the other one down but other than that i agree, there's definitely something between them

This .. is satire, right?
---
Yup for pve that's it

Changing the type of tequila, triple-sec, and even how you get the limes/when they're juiced changes the flavour significantly.

&gt; 14 videos
---
Damn, that's rough
---
Because they're bad.   
---
HoTs on the MT have some limited use to offset incoming damage, regardless of efficiency. On other raid members they're still less efficient than Pallys/Shammys, since they don't scale with Crit at all, and didn't scale as well with +healing as later expansions (it was much more competitive between AoE healing and HoTs than in BC, let alone later).    
---
Keep in mind Rejuv Rank 11 isn't even available until AQ20. And even then you'll faced with a race between ticks and AoE heal spam from Shammys/Priests or even single target Pally.
---
I'll pass on Defiance for personal preference. Perhaps if I were unable to keep up with some group members' DPS, I would respec. I don't know much about UBRS, which is why I ask, but is it possible to solo-tank 15-man? Thanks for the new info.

Ha, are you me? I am trying to get through the endgame grind/optional super bosses before Three Houses comes out. It's the first time ever playing FFX since I didn't own a PS2 when it came out way back when. The Switch port is great.
---
Shameless self-bump
---
Did I miss the sarcasm?
---
You cannot hit exalted rep with Darna in Vanilla settings. You are in early to mid revered (don't have the numbers on me rn) and need to do morrowgrain quests, that's always been the case.
---
Rep gains were boosted with tbc.
---
It's still better than not doing it and landing in early honored though.
---
If you're refering to staysafe's vid, he did this on a broken pserv or tbc serv.
---
This is what I’m doing, was thinking warrior as my main solo character and warlock with my friend as priest but gonna do the opposite
---
Tribute 100% worked in retail, can be done in pre-raid gear. However there is a good chance it would be changed because Blizzard would break it before it ruins the economy.
---
Ahh yes, the days of the Federation vs. the crew during Wotlk pretty much started off because of a cross faction RP conflict! Good times indeed
---
I'd recommend watching some videos by [Skarm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmlcHhlDLVw)
---
Now THAT is really being desperate lol. What a piece of shit game that was and still is to this day.
---
 I have nightmares from playing it back in 2012. How could something that looked so good beforehand turn out to be such absolute garbage? The beta testers warned us, but we stubbornly told them they were lying/had no clue what they were talking about. Oh how wrong we were...
---
Or just play on any EU server that has English speakers.  And have better ping.
---
That simple, huh? How about MC/BWL?
---
So you pick a dungeon that's deep. You're never hitting the reset cap on Gnomeregan, for instance. But back to back SM runs you'd easily hit the cap if you were AoE'ing properly.
---
[My lvl 60 priest](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/character/eu/chromaggus/h%C3%B6glund/reputation). I must've done a ramparts run or something since I've got a TBC mace, but that's it.
---
I plan to raid Savage in Shadowbringers and play Classic casually. Hopefully it isn't too rough splitting time.
---
You can tank UBRS without a spec at all and in level 50 leveling gear.
---
They'll release them at least 2 weeks prior to launch. If you have a sub you'll be able to reserve names on up to three characters 2 weeks in advance.
---
If you still think thats not enough time, just tell your friends to all roll on the first server that starts with a K. Or an M. Or anything like that.
---
Don Julio's won't be available in phase 1, just fyi
---
Thank you, that was the intended effect!
---
You're thinking of &lt;Overrated&gt;.
---
Wonder if this is just a private vs live?  Would make sense if it was using TBC levels of rep values per quest.
---
Man, those rep gains for the mounts.  I was doing this all post hitting 60, because I did the grind to Rank 11 for the black mounts of each race.  Ended up buying rune cloth to finish up all the reputation on my gnome.  Might have to consider moving towards areas, as I am thinking of getting a robo-chicken or ram as a human.
---
I am sure you are Mr. Billy Bad Ass balls deep in pussy every night.
---
this is sexy!
---
My girl played a Druid back in the day and loved it. I played a mage and we were a good fit. Not only could she tank she could heal my squishy ass. I played her  Druid for a while just to see how it was. I though it was fun.
---
I'll be tanking dungeons with my Paladin, so I definitely won't be pulling incorrectly, since the healer AND I will be OOM :D
---
Oh boy I can’t wait to play on Draenor!
---
That's no problem, as I won't have the time to get this gear before AV is released, anyhow. Thanks for checking if I was aware
---
Come GTA rp, or Rust RP, or DayZ rp...
---
More than ready for MC? Really, just like that? I always thought it would be so much harder to get in.
---
Lucky for me there are a lot more non "serious" guilds than "serious" guilds.
---
I got back into FFXIV several months ago, and it kinda jump started a nostalgia trip that's taken me through a bunch of FF games. Played through Zodiac Age &amp; FFX for the first time, and replayed FF7 for like 4th or 5th time. I the middle of a fairly casual FFIX replay too, but that one hasn't been too consistent.
---
Shadowbringers launches tomorrow, but I will definitely be playing Fire Emblem Three Houses when that comes out and then try to squeeze in FFX-2 before Classic comes out.
---
We'll see how it all goes, lol.
---
I don’t recall elites, but I could also be wrong.
---
The video is cool, hopefully the pathing is the same. Looks pretty tough.
---
You must have been looking in the wrong places boss or something, RP was pretty prevalent on ED
---
You want 1 hunter for every melee group. You want no more than 2 druids for the entire raid.
---
Thanks. I've consumed just about all the content out there. I've seen many takes on BiS, but I wanted to see if my own personal preferences would also be able to make the cut, if barely. Have you any thoughts on that?
---
Regards
---
No kidding!
---
Now I have to wait until someone casts a spell then feign death.
---
None of this information is useful. 
---
"hey i'm on my way following spread sheets but dont know if its going to make it but i havent done it all the way yet so idk"
---
And by a plate wearing priest, you mean a cloth wearing priest that can technically equip plate but won’t because it tanks your stats :P
---
Oh yeah, true.
---

---
The explanation at the time when I asked was that Emerald Dream had the best ratio of horde to alliance for PVP (almost 50/50) which attracted many non-RPers.
---
No it is not lmao.  I don't think you have played vanilla in a long time if you think 1 hour 30 is slow for levels 30-40
---
This was true at the start of the beta. It was fixed later on.
---
There's a difference between you getting sick of healing and you joining with the intent to leave when you get gear, because they invest effort in helping gear you so they can have a geared healer to clear future content.
---
I bought mine just before TBC and was disappointed that Naxx was missing. Naxx guid would have been so interesting and none of my friends went Naxx.
---
https://imgur.com/a/ZDnjys9
---
Not really.  Level both at the same time to maximize rested, unless your group is rushing to 60 in like a week or something crazy.
---
It is because you can't replicate it on a fresh server, it's not possible at all.
---
Once you're in the server, it should be fine thanks to layering. I think the concern is initially logging in and connecting to a layer.
---
Alright, thanks for replying 😊
---
You're skipping a lot of threat generating talents which is a problem.
---
If you watched all the content out there the problems in this build should be self evident.
---
If you actually want to keep tailoring which I wouldn't recommend then yeah, stockpile a good amount of them and sell the CD's or just the cloth around ZG, usually a couple of weeks in advance is when they peak in price.
---
Seeing a paladin healer in pvp in extremely obnoxious, much more so than seeing a priest. This is my experience as a horde player on a priv server
---
Except it it isn't, I never said crappy all over the place leveler with no plan. But with a good questing route 1. 5 hour per level is decent, not high, some parts of my route have levels under an hour in that level range.
---
Does Naxx fly near TB sometimes??
---
Same here. Doesn't bother me in the slightest honestly.
---
Reputation was increased in patch 2.0.1 and not documented. Private server experience and reputation values are well known to be based off of post-TBC values. The experience itself was officially confirmed and fixed after a 3 day 9 hour speed run by a hunter named.... Varuk? I don't remember his name. Started with a V.  
---
They fixed the experience after that point.  
---
There has never been a solid address on private servers regarding reputation values and likely never will be because people will flip out that they can't get a Darnassus saber on their gnome by level 40.  
---
**You will not find any database from the past that shows proper reputation values.** It was simply not prioritized back then by anyone. The only thing you can find are comments. You can find comments based on 1.12 patch and earlier, but you can also find comments from patch 2.0.1 when the values change. They were made by a particularly thorough guy who was doing the Stormwind quests. Go dig around in Stormwind reputation comments and you'll probably find him in there.  
---
The strongest evidence I have that less reputation is correct is a [comment by a level 25 human](https://web.archive.org/web/20060312175336/http://www.thottbot.com/?ccb=1&amp;v=500276) priest on March 12, 2006 (pre-1.12) who started in Shadowglen at level 1 in pursuit of a Darnassus sabre.  
---
Lets do some rough math with his quote:  
---
Thott Quote | Pserver value, roughly | % of total | Quote values | % Reduction
---
---|----|----|----|----
---
"All of Darn/Teld" | 9080 | 38.01% | 4104.81 | 45.21%
---
"All of Darkshore" | 10635 | 44.52% | 4807.79 | 45.21%
---
"Almost all Ashenvale" mod | 4175 | 17.48% | 1887.40 | 45.21%
---
 | **23890** |  | **10800** | 
---
"Almost all Ashenvale" 2 | 9080 | | | 37.51%
---
I also reduced the total reputation he reported (12,000) by 10% to make up for the human racial, as you can see in the table showing 10800.  
---
I took his quote about "Almost all of Ashenvale" and modified it to be only quests up to level 25. But listed a calculation just for the hell of it that includes a simulation where he did every quest in Ashenvale at level 25 (highly doubt it but included it anyway)  
---
Private server players have historically had a very hard time swallowing any idea that their private server reputation values are wrong. And that's okay too. It's understandable that they have a hard time accepting it because they've been using the same reputation values on private servers for many years.  
---
The Darnassus quest guide you linked uses the Mangos project as its source, which is a private server database. I believe the original project was called AOWoW which all of this is based off of, but I could be very wrong about that as I'm not really a private server historian.
---
This is high quality.
---
Battleshout and demoshout won't hold AOE threat. Warriors excel with massive pulls because of their shield block. And can only hold AOE threat with thorns, shield spikes (even better with the engineering shield) and most importantly: engineering bombs. 
---
While leveling a druid is better at AOE (swipe plus maul tab targeting)
---
Same but opposite in my group. We all want to go Ally but one guy wants to go undead rogue and he's incessantly bitching
---
$$$$$$$
---
Same old shit, to a much dwindling audience. I follow him on Snapchat and there are daily "about to stream, guys" posts. He's getting grey, hair is really long, and he seems utterly sad tbh
---
I found this, IDK if it works tho.

[https://www.wowhead.com/forums&amp;topic=37438](https://www.wowhead.com/forums&amp;topic=37438)
---
I think people overestimate the Value of Epic Mounts in Vanilla.
---
Personal experience has proven that a large majority will settle pretty fast on simply staying with the level 40 mount for extended periods of time before even seriously considering the move to the Epic mount category.
---
Hell I have know druids and shaman to never purchase any mount training throughout the entirety of the time I played Vanilla, hell I was one of the Shaman that lived with Ghost wolf Speed from the time i bought that spell until the point my guild was raiding AQ40.
---
Do you really think they care? Or are you joshing?
---
It was a common thing mate. I used to play the ah aggressively. By out all low priced mats and put them up for my designated price. Some days it's all I would do.
---
Apart from the deleted ones this thread has been a treasure. Thank you.
---
I think the only realistic rules you have to worry about in Classic are:
---
1. Don't expect to raid as hybrid DPS or tank. 
---
2. Don't expect to Main Tank unless you're putting in a TON of time and dedication. 
---
Otherwise, pick what appeals to you - you'll find a raid spot, you'll have your niche, you won't be useless. None of the classes are so inconvenient or painful to play that you'll regret picking it.
---
Generally, if you didn't go out of your way to actively grief or bother RPers, they wouldn't go out of their way to report your name.
---
Haven't seen this mentioned yet, but Blackstone Ring.
---
Prebis for all physical DPS classes. Hunters will sometimes sell Princess runs where they keep all the loot and just give their tagalong buddy the ring if it drops.
---
Mop has some other cool spells too that got removed.
---
Mages basically get weavers ult from dota.
---
Well the only thing you said that is true is that it is slow and grindy.
---
Skill definitely plays a role in all games though. To say it doesn't is a silly thing to say. Skill is also a pretty broad definition. 
---
If you said "really adept quick twitch skill doesn't get you far in WoW compared to FPS" then yeah that is true. 
---
I was in a kinda average guild and I'll tell you we had players with more skill than others and the ones who didnt have the "move out of fire" skill really held most guilds back.
---
I have always assumed they handle sharding/layering by having separate VMs for each shard/layer and they all connect to a centralized server to handle things like group invites/social. Once you are transferred to a different layer/shard, its no different than initially loading into the world. Only difference is you already have the graphics rendered so its instant.
---
Good luck getting that gear on your wish list
---
Elemental protection potions are the crutch that bad guilds will use to down content with less than optimum raid comps or even missing players. I agree that pserver people go crazy with consumables like flasking the whole raid instead of just tanks for progression, and many guilds will be more casual/semi-casual on classic but low cost-high impact consumables like protection potions will definitely be used.
---
Anyway, outside of nitpicking estimated gold values and stuff, a lot of your lower level farming areas are great :) also: you can save all your thick and rugged leather on a banking toon for when the aq40 gates open to turn in and stack up scrolls/boe's to de with a level 5 banking toon for large brilliant shards.
---
That is awesome! What type of file is it?

nice run but i hate if people jump too much

Edit (1): Here is the link to the mod, but appears to be made for older versions. Waiting to hear and confirm if this works on classic.   [https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info9175-RothUIDiablo.html](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info9175-RothUIDiablo.html)
---
I would add Living Essence to the list of world farm materials, seeing how it's a crucial ingredient for Hide of the Wild, which every healer will probably look to get. 
---
Essence of Undeath and Essence of Fire are common drops in 5-mans, so don't farm those.
---
Check out this tool (not my work) for a basic idea of AH prices: https://www.wow-auctionhouse.com/
---
Rogues kept getting pushed in to "get out of everything" territory and it made it really annoying playing against them.
---
Like I'm fine with the stealth openers being able to kill me if done properly, but if they mess up or I get lucky they shouldn't be able to just opt out and re try.
---
Yank those points out of imp life drain and put them into suppression. You need spell hit for PvP too.
---
Retail has working mechanics.  So in BRD, some mobs will net you making your day very bad.
---
It was more a response to Legendaries that are no longer attainable, such as Atiesh and Black Bug Mount.
---
Zug, Zugg &amp; Zuggy.
---
The release of classic is the worst possible timing for me.
---
I work for a school district which starts September 3rd. The week of Aug 26th is crunch time. No way in hell my boss will let take PTO that week. I will likely be staying late most days to make sure everything is running smoothly. 
---
Why oh why couldn't it have been released July 29th. I could have taken two weeks off.
---
RP-PvP for the win! RP servers just feel lackluster and not immersive without the danger out in the world!
---
Help us Blizzard, you're our only hope!
---
Its actually fairly easy to understand, from a business standpoint.
---
The whole game starts fresh. Every server (even if just set up virtually) is empty at the beginning and a server "community" must be formed.
---
Casual, normal players are not per se interested in RP Servers when they start the game. RP players are an absolute minority in the game compared to all other folks, even tho they were very active in terms of community work (because of the whole RP stuff you know).
---
It also often comes with a bad vibe and prejudices if you have no idea what RP means in wow. (Not saying its justified, its just like that). "PVE" and "PVP" ralms do not have any of those "problems".
---
Some RP servers in the past had thriving communities that made more people join. Thats literally the only reason those RP realms got big- they just became popular at some point and a shit ton of non RP folks joined. We all know that for years blizzard ignored the downfall of the community and kept  nearly empty realms alive, so people would realmtransfer. Rarely was that free.
---
I still think Classic-Wow is a huge ass experiment for blizzard. Im still very sure 80% of the playerbase will leave in the first 3 months, because they realize how shit (read: slow, grindy, unflashy) classic actually is compared to modern wow. Blizzard knows this, its the risk they are willing to take, but they will not take the full risk they would with retail.
---
So why create RP-Realms in the first place if its for a super tiny community in a huge game experiment that could be nearly dead in one year? It is the exact same deal for all the languages people want realms for. This is not retail. This is retails experimental second cousin.
---
I mained a NEF Hunter BC - Cata, but I'm rolling Horde with some old friends come retail.
---
Not amusing
---
Right there with you. If I could retire in Classic/Vanilla Wow I would.
---
There is! it will also do energy for rogues, I believe.
---
Right, so more people per server = dead server. Gotcha
---
Druids and Paladins feel outclassed nearly entirely in PvE, and if healing/tanking isn't your business then warriors/priest nearly go out the window too. Only shamans I know very little about so I can't comment.
---
Paladins are the best healers in the game and Warriors are some of the best DPS (they aren't even as gear dependent as a lot of people say, even in MC they top meters).
---
This is the one thing I'm writing for: So many memories, to create a testament of when the four of us had such good fun. WoW was just a vessel in the end, but it was the proper one.
---
They're not even entirely correct post-TBC values, they're just generally wrong values. There's a whole bunch of breadcrumb quests that award good chunks of rep on private servers even though they never awarded more than 5-10 rep on retail, not even in TBC/WotLK.
---
What class is plank?
---
Yeah I am just calling bullshit on that.  Under an hour?  No fucking way
---
pre raid bis and atleast 15 pts in def tree
---
Definitely Troll.
---
This has nothing to do with classic
---
Nice job!
---
Cool story would read again

*Man* this is hard to read.

You should definitely move to Scotland if you’re not already there.
---
I remeber downloading something similar during tbc. Tbh it was so annoying. I dont know how yall play with all these crazy ui's
---
All you have to do is sleep less than your competition. You might be off to a slow start but if you just play more you will ding faster.  Nobody will be 60 in 1 sitting.
---
hi assmon
---
LULW
---
No he gunna sell it to some cheeto guy here
---
Thanks, thats really informative:)
---
doubt you can solo tank 15 man when everyone's in greens/blues. i bet a tryhard guild with good coordination could. would probably take forever with all the CC'ing and kiting. i'm trying to recollect what it was like 15 years ago lol. everything just hit very hard. especially the last boss's two guards. 
---
disclaimer: i have no idea if blizzard is going to make UBRS the fun 15 man event it used to be. the person with the UBRS key was very popular.
---
Just threaten any mount buyers IRL then they wont buy them EZ
---
Bald
---
Yes this^
---
Dip
---
For pve troll has a mini personal bloodlust and + bow skill. No racial is so big you CANT play what you like the aesthetic of though, since you gotta Starr at their back for days and days
---
This has nothing to do with classic wow and is also not funny
---
Priest was the most fun for me so far. Not the fastest leveler, but super efficient with no downtime. I like being able to buff random people passing by me. 
---
Whatever I roll its probably going to be a healer. I really enjoy being able to heal someone who's about to die out in the world. 
---
If I had to roll a DPS class though, it would 100% be a Rogue. Its so fun, stealth is an amazing tool on a PvP server. So many death runs saved from just not being seen by the enemy faction.
---
Hey Asmon, what addon are you using to track rares?
---
Hypothetically.
---
Good boi.
---
Should have erased/flattened the nose too.
---
Is the reset macro going to work in classic?  I saw on a stream the old reset macro wasn't working.
---
So I played vanilla as a hunter, and I've already decided I'll play that again.
---
It's been long enough that I don't remember much about professions! Initially on that character I had skinning/leather working. Some point after I reached 60, I dropped both for mining/engineering (I think eng for a trinket that provided fire resist, but I don't remember).
---
This time around, I'm not very interested in a crafting profession; leatherworking was not very useful for me late game, and I got a lot of green drops to supplement some blue dungeon drops while leveling. 
---
Does anybody have a recommendation besides mining/herbalism as a set of professions? I'm not dead set on them. I wish I remembered more about my time playing vanilla so I could make a more thoughtful post, but this is where I'm at with my memory. Thanks!
---
Wrong game buddy. :)
---
Bro, on vanilla launch there were quite a few german servers, at first they had a ton of players, after a few months most of them were ghost towns and really only frostwolf, aegwynn and blackhand had high online.

We live in a society.

FF 14 got 400 store items but hey FF 14 is great
---
I don't get it. Who is this?
---
Hmmmm that sounds bad :/ one of the nicest things about private servers is being able to log out and log in in like 1 second.
---
I guess since they sort of reverse engineered the game, its probably not as light on the computer as the original game was
---
I personally prefer a 12 button grid mouse. I use a Corsair Scimitar.
---
However, any mouse will do. Tons of players use only keyboard binds. I would at least get a mouse with two buttons on the side.

Good folks, I'll be making a tauren shaman 🤘
---
Trolls are hands down the best horde hunter race for PvE. That being said, if you're planning on doing any PvP at all, and you care about doing everything you can to win in BG's, WPvP &amp; duels, it's worth going Orc. The stun resist chance is huge, as it stacks with the base stun resist.
---
Razer naga if you’re set on needing to use a lot of mouse buttons, otherwise I use the Logitech g203. It’s cheap and has adjustable dpi.
---
A few years back i tried to get that but i would have had to download it from a shady website, instead of being simple and having it on the addon-website every other addon was on, so i didnt do it.
---
Hopefully its on a more respectable website this time around, i might give it a try then. It sure looks awesome,  those health  and mana numbers are very easy to see!
---
logitech g502 is my jam
---
7 buttons I think which for me is about right, nagas and the like have to many for me
---
He who must not be named
---
I don't really wanna play on a server with more than 5k people. It's though. Reputation goes out the window and noone knows anyone.
---
 Piercing howl and parry are both included in the PVE build lol, sure you lose some of those but you get 10 seconds less cooldown on intercept and also flurry. Rogues can't stunlock shit as combat and you have no burst against moving targets, good luck even touching a mage, druid or hunter without cold blood or prep.
---
/spit
---
Humans can't ride gnome mounts.
---
If we're using sub numbers, we pretty much have to count out all of Asia and Eastern Europe, which is fine.
---
BFA has ~1.5 million subs at best.
---
So that's 225k Classic players.
---
Ideal server population is 5k after tourists leave. With the minimum amount of Layering, you need 20k at launch.
---
That's ~11 realms.
---
2 PVP, 2 PVE, and 1 RP for Europe.
---
1 PVP, 1 PVE, and 1 RP for US West.
---
1 PVP, 1 PVE, and 1 RP for US East.
---
Everyone else gets nothing (since China and Russia aren't being counted here).

You've combined two of my favorite things.

Thank you so much 😂😂😂
---
Oh fuck. There’s going to be all sorts of stupid streamers ganking players just doing their quests. Back in my day, there wasn’t an audience for dicks like that.
---
I've looked through the code some and almost guarantee it will break in classic. There's no guards against loading content for class specific resources, such as holy power or modern soul shards and while I dont have the source in front of me at this moment, I would wager it will break.  
---
That said, the repo is very well structured and forking the project to update it for classic looks to be relatively easy to do and I plan on doing so. Unfortunately, I do not have beta access to begin work on that prior to August 26th. So, if someone beats me to it, great. If not, I'll try to make it publicly available some time in September.

&gt;I wont respond to this again.
---
If your objective is to provide the community a service then you should engage those who disagree with you by using cordial dialogue and supplying your own evidence, not plugging your ears.
---
&gt;They are not, if you are in a serious hardcore guild then perhaps, but any normal guild or casual wouldn't do this, the amount of people doing that as a full raid is not going to be substantial, and again I said you could stockpile them, I'm not against people that want to do that and sell them accordingly, its just not something I would do, hence why it was MY opinion on the subject.
---
You are moving the goalposts. Your claim: Shadow Protection potions are not used until Naxxramas. My counterpoint: they are used on Nefarian. Your opinion of "how" or "who" should use them is *entirely* guesswork and there is no reason to lay the foundation of a gold making guide on such guesswork.
---
Indeed, your own archival data disagrees with your opinion - notice the prices of Grave Moss and Elemental Fire?
---
&gt;Nostalrius devs have confessed that they overtuned the numbers on purpose to make it harder, you simply have to google it.
---
"Just google it" is not a counterpoint. You've made a claim, and failing/refusing to source it simply damages your credibility.
---
&gt;I never said they're useless, I said most people wont be using them hence why you should focus your economy somewhere else.
---
Ok, and what's your source? You realize that one of the most common criticisms leveraged at vanilla by retail players is the consumable culture, right? Vanilla is (in)famous for the need to chug protection potions, whipper root tubers, sagefish, and all other manner of consumables. Flasking for everything is the culture on retail, full consumable usage was the culture in vanilla back in the day and presently on private servers. You seem to think this will disappear because one Nostalrius supposedly (unsourced as of yet) claimed that they overtuned some bosses, while purposefully blinding yourself to other use cases of consumables such as raid comfort/speed?
---
&gt;Good guilds are not the norm, people are going to be new, private server people are going to shake in their boots when they find out all the changes to their precious world.
---
People coming into classic expecting classic as it was back in 2004, are going to unfortunately be terribly disappointed. Every iota about vanilla is mathed out extensively in community spreadsheets for every single aspect of the game. There is no more discovery to be done. I can tell you the pre-raid BIS and raid BIS items for every single Druid spec in every single patch, one by one, from 1.1 to 1.12 - including different mathematical weights to calculate "swap" items based on the content being done or other custom use cases. This was not possible in vanilla.
---
The culture in WoW has devolved into damage meters, spreadsheets, and raidlogs. Popular addons like BigWigs, DeadlyBossMods, Details, WeakAuras, and Skada have massive name recognition even amongst the most casual of WoW players. Those are all efficiency, optimization, and performance helping/measuring addons. You think those are going to disappear and not come along to classic, despite the fact that the AddOn API will be nearly identical?
---
All this is to say that yes, consumables and protection potions will be used by *all* guilds, from casual to professional. It is an inevitability. The only difference between those guilds will be the quantity of consumables used.
---
&gt;except anecdotal evidence of your opinions
---
The irony here is not lost on me.
---
&gt;Layers are going to be removed after phase 1, that's all I have to say about that.
---
In which case for the worst case scenario, there will be classic retail servers with 8-12k players. Presently AoE farming on private servers is viable with that number, so I suppose it must be a viable method.
---
I think it's very bold to assume 80% of the playerbase will leave in 3 months. I think it'll be much less than that.
---
Again, having ONE RP-PVP realm will not break them, and because it's one server, the population will not be an issue. I don't get why this is so hard to understand. 
---
If 1% of 1 million players play an RP-PVP server, that's 10,000 players. And i can see Classic WoW launching with at least 8 million. Obviously it will drop but again, the population won't be an issue if it's ONE server.

Many classes can reset duels. You have to reset a duel against a ret paladin because it's among the top 1v1 specs. This isn't something that's necessary against something like a warrior.
---
Of course you'd rather duel a ret paladin than a holy paladin as a warrior. A holy paladin with half decent gear can stay alive against a warrior indefinitely. 
---
A ret paladin can pull the same crap, just less impossible to kill, even with their pre-raid blues as long as they're plate. It's not like you need insane stats to spam rank 2 FoL while wearing plate lol. Shit, if the warrior has a sulfras or something, you can just put on your 1h/shield until you get pummeled. Every paladin's going to have a healing wep for raiding.
---
It gets more lopsided once the paladin gets in lawbringer or judgement. Good luck killing that 1v1. It's not like it gets any better when ret paladins get actual damage gear in AQ40 either.

One of the reasons I never liked the language barrier tbh. I get that some a-hole forsaken with common abused it (C'mon who thought giving the edgy race x-fac chat was a good idea?) but it completely severed anyone from having a verbal boxing match in the world if they wanted to.

Another potential issue is its dependence on oUF (unit frames library), which has stated that they will not be releasing a classic compatible version as a team. Beyond that, I'm not sure what incompatibilities their (oUF) codebase will have when run in the classic client, but there will likely need to be patches there as well.  
---
oUF isn't the only dependency and the patches required may continue to propagate through to other libraries that Roth\_UI depends on.
---
Perfectly honest shard farming and debuff limit doesn't hinder my want to play Warlock.  For me personally it was my first class I played in Wrath when I started and was my main in other expansions after that.  I'd say play what you enjoy playing honestly.

Works that way on private servers. I've had pretty good luck dealing with German players and guilds over the past 8 years. Russians and chinese though, how boy.

Yea I realized that 2 seconds after posting it lol
---
If you guys get your RP-PVP you better damn play on it too. Don't make it into a ghost town and beg for server transfers once you get to level 60
---
Except me. &gt;:D 
---
If  i saw anyone with an inappropriate name on my rp-server i would report them asap!
---
This is correct.  Even on Kronos the human mobs in the first area net you as well as others.
---
This is pretty much exactly right. We don't know how the whole leeway, and hit box thing will work out for tauren tho. It doesn't sound like it's going to be in favor of hunter at this point. Warstomp doesn't share DR with freezing trap like scatter does tho. Do I guess they get a bit of an advantage in that respect.
---
Hahaha I've been back and forth a few times, who is this?
---
1. During vanilla, all the way through TBC and most of WotLK, this minmaxing bullshit you are talking about very seriously in your OP was pretty much nonexistent. Race choice was almost entirely visual.
---
2. Go watch D&amp;T getting the world first KT kill and keep an eye out for the race/class combos you see. Note that the raid is not comprised entirely of human warriors and dwarf priests. In fact, the vast majority of the raid is not human warriors, dwarf priests, gnome mages, or any of this nonsense people peddle on this sub. People chose the race they liked back then.
---
3. "if healing/tanking isn't your business then warriors/priest nearly go out the window too". It sounds like you also have received some bad information. Warriors top the DPS charts and shadow priests are considered by many the BiS solo PvP choice.
---
Play warlock and choose the race that you think looks the coolest. Stop listening to dummies on this sub who only played vanilla on pservers.
---
Thank you very much sir.
---
&gt; I think it's very bold to assume 80% of the playerbase will leave in 3 months. I think it'll be much less than that.
---
Absolutely! I might be totally wrong here. But I am sure we will see a massive drop after a rather short time.
---
Because alone the fact that they have a different nameing policy for those RP realms means there needs to be another brench of the support team to deal with that, all those small extras add up and its simply a financial decision at the end.
---
Which when you think about it doesn't make sense. Why wouldn't you cover the weakest parts of your undead body.
---
Well they each will be for a while before each tier’s respective phases release
---
gamers rise up!!!
---
You're welcome!

I noticed it as well this vid. It'll tone it down haha

---
Sorry... I just right clicked by accident.
---
They are doing a service for you. There is value in said service.
---
The fact that they are pressing a single button a few times to do it does nothing to change the value of said service. 
---
Community and social interactions matter more now. While I certainly can't speak for the whole WoW classic community, if you're this entitled about something simple like mage water, then you're likely not a player I'd want in my groups or raids. You're likely to be similarly sketchy on other, also trivial and widely settled matters.

Particle  Gaming is a Semi-Hardcore guild presently recruiting all classes for  Classic W.o.W. We intend on raiding three to four nights a week and  creating two strings for PVP for those that are very serious and those  that want to be a little more casual with their competitive needs.  Whatever you want out of Classic, Particle Gaming can help you out! We  are seeking individuals that live in USA/CA and have Discord with a  working headset. Players of all experience levels and skill levels are  welcome to inquire. We don’t care if you have never played Classic or  haven’t touched W.o.W. since Classic. Either way, we can help you out!  Most of our core members have fond memories of playing Classic and  cannot wait to sink our teeth into it again! Leadership/Class Leader  roles are available, too!   If you might be interested shoot me a DM or  join our Discord!  [https://discord.gg/kSEgaeC](https://discord.gg/kSEgaeC)

\*\*We are having weekly meetings to help shape the guild, come join!\*\*

how viable is shadow priest? Its one of the class spec combos i'm considering a lot, next to mage warlock and druid. I plan on running a guild with friends, any info on PvP and PvE raiding and what not would be great
---
Awesome video. Wish there was other vids like this for the other 5 classes that I cant decide between.
---
What is the point of speed running when zones are empty. It is not realistic.
---
Oh boo hoo, go read that idiots other comments, he's a prick and dense to boot.  Gonna clean his piles of word spew up while you're at it?
---
More of this please
---
Orc all the way.  Troll PvE advantages are minimal and that sweet stun resist is ridiculous in PvP.  Better bow firing animation too.
---
Paladin
---
No one knows right now.  DM is not coming out with phase 1.
---
Makes sense.
---
I think that there is an additional scaling penalty applied to spells of such low rank than you learned them below level 20. So I think renew 3 (learned at level 20) would be better than renew 1. I don't have enough experience on a priest to know what the good uses for that are. One thing that comes to mind is: you can't put high level HoTs on low level characters, so sometimes if you're trying to rescue a low level character or powerlevel somebody or something, you'd have to downrank. Maybe you could spam low rank renews out on your raid or something. I am not sure.
---
Yet another person who does not understand the problem that layering is designed to address.
---
Warriors reset fights because its to their advantage to cast charge again. Its part of their kit. If a warr can reset fight to gap close again, he will bc its the smart thing to do. That doesnt mean its a hard matchup for him, since resetting the fight is easy vs a pally. You just go oom trying to heal thru MS and interrupt. Idk what you on about rets are bad. 
---
You said you could beat r14s w arcanite reaper didnt you? bs

---
Not really no.. That's from the warlock classic discord.
---
No need for being denser than bedrock, yet here you are.
---
i think the /castrandom still works for topping dps
---
What is there to abuse in the early zones anyways? Those shitty chests dropping 6 slot bags?
---
I know it isn't. But it's fun to do in my opinion. Currently I'm memorizing the 20-30 level range, so running 1-20 as fast a possible helps me prep characters for that as well :)
---
I assume if you play wow classic you logged on 24/7 so concurrent = total.
---
You linked a spec that has 17 points missing? They are supposed to be put in arms. And you take 1 point put of improved battle shout for piercing howl, it's not even 1% damage loss. Never seen a fury warrior not having it in my life, you just linked that cause it fits your argument better. And using late AQ 40 as an excuse doesnt make much sense since it will take 1 year + before we even get there and only 5% of the server population will have that gear.
---
Why stop there? How about each spec for every race that can play that class. You don't need any free time until August anyway, right?
---
oh man, i used one of these in TBC, it was horrible coded, lots of errors and HUD overlapping. Gonna go 100% base action bars this time.
---
I don't enjoy "world pvp" in any zone, because 9/10 times it's an unfair unavoidable gank.
---
While playing WoW?
---
I meant healing macros
---
I thought the answer was 42
---
Strength only gives melee attack power. Hunters get 2 ranged AP per agility.
---
Why I'm just sending messages to friends and past guildies to get them on the same server, even if we don't play directly, so we have the option to play together.

---
Yea I must be a retail player. Mmhmm. I can’t just be pointing out the flaw in your logic of not allowing the majority of players from entering an area reserved only for a select few like rogues, which of course you as a rogue will benefit. Yep it has to be that I’m a retail player. That way you don’t have to defend your blatant selfishness.
---
Isn't it obvious? I'm Corporal Gravious, your fellow Pharaoh of War. That is, until you betrayed us for &lt;Haven&gt; in the spring of 2006, 
---
and betrayed them for &lt;New Guild Name&gt; that autumn, 
---
and betrayed them for &lt;Project A&gt; early the following year, 
---
and betrayed them for &lt;Deus ex Machina&gt; a couple months later, 
---
and betrayed them for &lt;Protector of Vajayjay&gt; that summer,
---
and then went back to &lt;Deus ex Machina&gt; a couple months later,
---
and then betrayed them AGAIN for &lt;Reign of Darkness&gt; in the spring of 2008,
---
only to betray them for &lt;TehBoX&gt; a few months later,
---
and then returned to &lt;Reign of Darkness&gt; a year later,
---
just so you could betray them again with &lt;PillarOfAutumn&gt; in the winter of 2011,
---
which you betrayed 3 DAYS LATER with &lt;Team Really Short Bus&gt;,
---
whom you betrayed for &lt;Niche&gt; not two months later.
---
And there you remained, off and on, until you quit the game in November 2016.
---
Good call, since double D is healing Plank is probably a ret paladin, and they are as useful at dps’ing as planks
---
not all changes are equal, #mychanges are better than #yourchanges and maybe even #nochanges
---
Where is the third DPS?
---
Theres a pserver that uses tons of hidden areas and it's really cool, they also have 2v2 and 3v3 arenas in places like SM and and they make use of the Arena in Dire Maul etc.
---
No it was the scourge invasion
---
Not for rogues/hunters
---
&gt; Nobody will be 60 in 1 sitting 
---
I beg to differ. Among those trying to go for world first 60 there are going to be some extreme dudes. I suspect with all the practice from private servers and preparation( they will have people helping them, mailing consumables and items to them etc) hitting 60 can probably be done in just a little over 3 days played. 
---
 Many players are probably going to stay awake like 2 days and do nothing but play. 3 might be impossible I guess but doesn't matter when it comes to the question if they will log out. They will not. When it's time to sleep they will have another player use their account and play. Worlds first 60 will no doubt be the work of 2 or more players even though it will get talked about like it was just 1 since it's not allowed to share your account.
---
Why you just get your name on every server at that point. Or is it 3 characters only across all realms?
---
Was it a quest? An event? I just don’t remember ever seeing it there.
---
We have video evidence of you being able to kill the boss abusing pathing in DMN, so you could do the same with dogs and bugs, but I no idea how the drops are on real vanilla, the pserver bugs drops quite a decent amount which could be a mistake. We'll just have to see.
---
Exp gains have also been massively boosted, so
---
All I know is the Rogue stealthed behind them is picking the troll 100% of the time because Orc stun resist is OP.
---
We would be 100% ok with that. It's going to be a shit storm regardless.
---
which i'm sure they probably won't do!  it would be a bit silly to tell the world how your back end works haha
---
anyways.  gib persistant servers no layers D:
---
It was 2.0 pre BC patch, so we had 1 month Naxxramas with pre bc talents.
---
i've got jack johnson and tom o'leary here waitin fer ya
---
Lol im glad you know how to use warcraftrealms.com but if you were Gravious or actually knew me at all you'd know I'm still playing, just not that character :)
---
Same lol
---
I'm taking a week off work on launch to duo with my unemployed friend. I'll play warrior he'll play probably paladin he says. That will probably get me to 40 or so. By the time I go back to work and my friend out paces me, I'll be comfortable to grind out the last 20 solo questing and dungeoning after 54.
---
Depends if you plan on being a hard core raider in a top guild. Yea engineering could be a req.
---
Enlighten me, please.
---
It's from found here on wowhead but it's clearly missing a lot of information.
---
I could have swore this was just a rare later game recipe that's the successfor for minor and lesser absorb.  It does 5% proc absorb 50 damage.
---
Here's the link.  This link says it's temporary but I don't believe that to be true.
---
I think it was 2 bruiseweed + enchanting supplies to apply it.  It's almost lost in time though so little information.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=7855/imbue-chest-absorb
---
Idk man he's not out of line here you did just say you're going to give your guild an ultimatum *after* getting your Benediction staff, just seems deceitful and in bad taste.
---
The person you're responding to didn't say a word about your spec , only your attitude. You're basically saying you're gonna ninja a staff and ditch your guild lmao I mean idk man maybe try to find a guild that's ok with you playing shadow so you don't have to trick an entire group of people into thinking they have a priest heal r for their raids.
---
There was certainly discussion about it since they’d been in WC3. I had ‘Pandamonium’ reserved as a name since TBC cos I guessed Pandas would be the next new race.
---
The problem with sharding is that it's uncontrolled where layering is more solid with set amount of players per layer.
---
It can't be that hard to combine the two and make it so layering only exists for certain levels/zones, like you could put all lvl30+(or whatever level) in the same seperate layer and it would work no?
---
Well yeah, because that character's reputation is forever tarnished.
---
90s kids will remember this
---
But I still use the same name!!   
---
Who are you? Hahahah
---
I played number one for 30 mins thos games suck
---
You're overestimating how many people actually had decked out gear. I was in multiple pug groups (that I formed by messaging random people in the level range) that was easily able to AOE down GY/Arm and I dinged 30 like 2 days before the cap was raised and didn't have any "BiS 30" gear. It isn't as hard as you think it is.
---
There will be way more than a million players playing classic when it launches. My guess would be over 5 Mil easy. Yeah probably half of the people will bounce after 1-3 months but I see a large player base well into Phase 6.
---
Let’s boost my karma and hope that my karma gets boosted!

Mage suits my pvp and pve playstyle almost perfectly in vanilla
---
The only thing that's pulling me towards Hunter is the DM North farming would make life a breeze..
---
I've leveled and raided both Hunter and Mage in vanilla and I never had much luck AoEing BRD.. After 150+ runs I got a Warden Staff and a Hurricane
---
Risky post OP
---
&gt; Its like me linking a combat build without imp sprint or gouge
---
No it isn't. There isn't a DPS boosting alternative to taking Imp. Gouge or Imp. Sprint.
---
Hey check my reply to ZirzoR a little bit more info on what it is.
---
But it's clearly not fully documented on wowhead.  I think it was permanent enchant.  The successor to minor and lesser imbue.
---
5% proc absorb 50 damage.
---
The recipe can't just be 2 bruiseweed.  But maybe 2 bruiseweed + enchanting supplies.
---
Come on, Zirzor.  A little criticism never hurt anyone.
---
Why do people like you keep saying this fucking lie &gt;private server experience and reputation values are well known to be based off of post-TBC values.
---
THIS WAS FIXED OVER A YEAR AGO.
---
You must be new here, welcome to Reddit!
---
Why not? Rappers do it all the time.
---
You have been going ham with this theory. It may be right but it would be pretty sad to log into Classic and see 6 servers listed, LOL
---
Thanks for the work you did on this.
---
*sitting, waiting patiently for Altnob to get home*
---
That’s a trick they never teach you. 
---
Step 1: Work out, get fit. 
---
Step 2: Binge wow for a year to develop larger bones.
---
Step 3: Stop playing WoW. Resume working out, now with the enlarged bones.
---
Step 4: Become the biggest _and_ most ripped human alive. Bones the size of calves, and calves the size of calves (the bovine). 
---
Step 5: ???
---
Step 6: Profit
---
^^This person knows
---
I was considering hunter as a main alt in classic but that melee leeway mechanic is making me reconsider hard.
---
I did play hunter in real vanilla as a main and now ive decided i want a different experience... especially because of the leeway. If it stays that way its gonna be really bad, warriors able to  hamstring you from beyond your deadzone i think. And beyond their OWN deadzone... warriors have charge/intercept deadzone so it takes skill to be able to stay in that zone to avoid being melee hit and to not give the warrior a chance to charge.
---
This is especially true in PvP.... in old pvp videos you can see rogues being sneaky around the  deadzone of a warrior, and a hunter even, to get a restealth and another opener. Doesnt work on skilled players but most people are not going to be skilled, thats for sure. :P
---
Drid.
---
So you talk about THE FIRST WEEK?
---
You think THE FIRST WEEK will be a problem for wow classic?
---
What happens if you can farm twice as much for one week?
---
Congratulations on your extra 200g. No one cares about this 3 month later...
---
Keep realistic expectations. If you want to play something like an enhancement shaman, that’s fine... but you’ve also got to realize that it’s going to be hard to find a raid spot as one and your DPS will be really meh. As long as you’re being realistic about your goals, who gives a shit about the obstacles in your way? Now, if you’re trying to play something like a feral Druid with the intent of MTing your way all the way to the end of Naxx, you’re gonna have a really bad time. But I played a priest in classic and was able to raid as all three specs (disc - that spirit buff and DI hnnnnnngh, holy - dem heals, and shadow - look at me, I can do damage, make warlock DPS not suck and pull aggro all at the same time!) even though everyone basically said “anything not holy sucks” the whole time.
---
I remember during the Pre-Naxx event somone shouted that the Ziggaraut outside the city was descending. Had 200+ people out there just staring at it debating if it was moving slowly or not.
---
I would recommend asking in chat for a priest to group with you for say an hour. You’ll make friends and level much faster.
---
I did mining and sold everything on the AH as well as playing the AH. I got an epic mount a couple weeks after hitting 60.
---
That's what I figured.
---
Resisting a 5 combo point kidney shot is a feeling only rivaled by one-shotting a Gnome Mage who didn't refresh Ice Barrier.
---
Right, and I kind of alluded to that in my tl;dr. I'm kind of referring to sharding as a per zone thing and layering as the whole continent. But call it what you will, I think there is a real problem with having different layers/shards/whatevers of higher level zones and a real problem with not having it for lower level zones. I think that's where Blizzard should focus their efforts.
---
Orc for PVP, troll if you only like PVE. Orc if you do both.
---
Well this is the pre wotlk scourge invasion but its pretty much the same.
---

---
ill be testing the Torch of Retribution tonight to see if it procs SoR
---
Except for those pesky Druids
---
Thanks for the explanation!
---
I plan on having a second toon for leveling when he can't okay with me... Also I plan of leveling fishing and cooking a bunch so that I can make us food buffs ass well
---
Sorry, have mostly numbers in mind with rested XP in the mix as last time I leveled a char I played 3x a week so accumulated quite some. The levels under an hour are mostly ones were you have a log full on ding and fly through the level. 
---
However I am still not completely wrong. Just look at the numbers on Joana's old record run of [4 days 20 hours to 60](https://www.joanasworld.com/speedruns/), 30-31 53mins, 44-46 in 3:20, 52-53 1 hour. Most levels around 1 to 3 hours, and most of his recent improvements to the guide have smoothed out the 30-60 part quite a lot.
---
You won't be able to do that first room but arena farm should work. https://youtu.be/YldNvH4WpKI
---
Dude, are you like 12? There’s no originality in saying ”for the” in anything.
---
&gt; But I still use the same name!!
---
Yes, but only after your ultimate betrayal of going Horde!
---
SoR isnt an attack or a spell.
---
I controlled the enchanting market; I would buy up the mats and spike the cost, especially on the evening of raid resets.
---
I ended up making enough and basically liquidating all my assets when I had just enough because I was so sick of sitting in the AH in my spare time and relisting items.
---
I managed to get my epic ground mount before the reskins and still have my all black nightsaber, even though people can’t tell him apart from the ZG nightsaber usually, I feel pretty baller running around with it :)
---
dun dun dun
---
“The suspense is killing me... I hope it lasts”
---
I'm going to roll a warrior. Don't plan to pvp much since I have done a lot of that in classic( pvp grinded in the old honor system in retail classic). Still I will get engineering. Reason is I want to have all tools in the game available to me when I am tanking or dps:ing.
---
Nothing? Did I word something poorly that made you think I was afraid of low level exploiting?
---
Lmao oh my god dude are you alright?
---
But there are no queues because of layering...
---
I never have and I never will play a rogue. 
---
Druids have Moonglade entirely to themselves, such a place as I describe already exists. It doesn't affect anyone, it isn't favoritism, 
---
Christ sake it was just some random musing on my part. Selfishness? Holy shit are you a weird one.
---
This is the biggest fuck you honestly.
---
We want German servers. They ruined it at the last moment for us. I wom't start playing without a German server.
---
No no no, well written, it is just that many people’s greatest fear with sharding is shard jumping and exploiting chests. Afaik they also put on an internal cooldown for that!
---
So curious if you knew me from OG Stormscale or just trolling me?!
---
Lots of people will likely avoid STV as much as they can. That way they’ll be able to quest and actually level up instead of constantly walking back to their bodies.
---
Personally, I can’t wait to waste as much time as possible with the “pointless” world PvP. I’m so ready. The more the merrier.
---
One of the things I loved about the start of Cataclysm was the utter chaos of the leveling zones. A battlefield both for PvP and fighting over mobs.
---
Server population is going to drop dramatically after a few weeks, and even more after a few months. Layering allows them to pack an order of magnitude more players onto a single Realm so that when the population dies down they can collapse layers and the Realm still has a healthy population.
---
Without layering we will end up with 30 Realms at launch, only 2 of which have a healthy population after 2 months, and the other 28 need to be merged into each other so that there are enough people on them to run a raid. Underpopulated servers lead to even more people quitting since there are not enough people for groups. Then you have a big mess from the merges about losing realm identity and required name changes and even more people quit.
---
Warlocks are NOT bad on alliance. This is a fucking meme. Most classes that can pick undead don't even do it, because orc is a better alternative. Warlocks utterly shit on shamans, but gets demolished by the presence of paladins. You think fear resist is annoying? Try playing WSG with the entire enemy team pre fearwarded by a dwarf priest. Also there's no real reason to use succubus EVER, so don't worry about charm. Yes shard farming is annoying, that's part of the class. Debuff limit is nothing. You can't use CoA anyway, and with 16 debuffs your 1 SM/RUIN warlock should be able to use corrupt. Ignite is shit, so there you go, you don't even need to use dots.
---
Rogues and mages are great but they are not "viciously overplayed", they are vicously needed. A typical raid roster has 3 warlocks, but 5-6 mages and rogues. That's why there's more rogues/mages than warlocks. 
---
Druids and paladins outclassed in pve? Paladins are amazing healers wtf. Druids are weak early yes, and the problem with druids is that stacking them is inefficient because HoT's  don't stack. But you still want 1 or maybe 2, which is fine you are still massively useful as that one druid, it's just not a class you stack in raids unlike others. Yes ret paladin is shit, feral dps is still a bit in question, a thin line between viable and not, but ultimately these are healer classes, that's just how the game functions. Healers have the ability to do other stuff than heal, but just not in raids.
---
Dude. you really dont want to make assumptions based on beta balance. Check any bigger polls(&gt;20k) and theyre almost exactly 50/50 split
---
Yeah, it's not like we want to play in English servers either.
---
The names and voices and everything is nostalgic to us, but only if it's in German.
---
Like wtf Blizzard?
---
There's just no possible way 5 million happens. Blizzard has never had a single launch day that big in their history.
---
Night Elf mage. I think it would be really cool to have an underground night elf magic group sort of like the Slaughtered Lamb for warlock.
---
Nope, in vanilla level 1 enchanter could disenchant all
---
&gt; because once they've created a server they can't never ever delete it.
---
Well they can. They can do a merge which effectively deletes it. But that comes with its own problem.
---
20% is still big though...
---
I think my bank alt will be a Druid. Gonna Twink him out tho
---
I felt like he was ruined when they made him priesty instead of Paladin-y. Should have been the next Uther or Turalyon. It's like Blizzard publicly acknowledged that he was going to basically be a healing bitch in that cinematic.
---
You and me both
---
TBF, OP didn't specifically say during vanilla. Naxx was unchanged through TBC.
---
lol, I guess you aren't familiar with Moon Guard. There is a very specific reason Goldshire was filled with naked night elves https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWG9-UeBOwE
---
LIES! I AM GRAVIOUS!  
---
ALL ABOARD THE GRAVY TRAIN!!! CHOO CHOOOOOOOO!
---
ive only played pservers which attracts a different crowd but while leveling on alliance I definitely had a lot harder time dealing with wpvp. Also alliance low level zones are a lot easier to camp (redridge and duskwood) than horde leveling zones. I feel like horde attracts more of the pvpers because of the radials.
---
Too bad it would not be on the same faction, would be easier to transfer gold between the two (especially feeding the warrior if you start with the mage).
---
11 realms for the Western world is like 3x the sustainable Pserver population at any given time.
---
So you want either 5 hour log in queues or a bunch of dead server 2 weeks after launch? Where's your logic?
---
^^ truer words have it been spoken.
---
The original gear check boss.
---
I bet you get mad when your coworkers quit to go to a better job too. Look dude, I put in my hours (raiding), got my paycheck (DKP) and built my resume (getting gear) and then I put in my notice (telling them I’m not healing anymore) and left for greener pastures. Spare me your “NINJA LOOTER” shit because I bid on the item, the raid said “okay” and then they handed it to me. Guess how many people in that guild were as mad about it as the people posting in here? Not a single person, because *they* realized all of this shit. Not a single one of them, including the other priests in the guild, gave a shit because it’s just pixels.
---
Well I would say equally important.  There is an expression I think fits layering and the community of WoW, "leave well enough alone".
---
World record 1 to 60 is over 4 days.
---
So...you may beg to differ, but you'd still be wrong. You yourself said 3 days is "impossible ".
---
paladins channel the light through their bodies to empower their attacks, whereas priests just summon the light and direct it. Undead paladins that don't have the will of a titan (sir zelizek) would burn up in hours
---
Yes, 20% (Germans) is much bigger than 2.5% (RP-PVPers). So if the Germans aren't getting their own realm, there's no chance of RP-PVP.
---
I still wonder exactly how many ppl will stay on Classic. I’m excited, but idk if I’ll be as hardcore on it as I currently am on retail. Going to be hard to balance the two, for me at least
---
No but there are defensive talents to reduce farming downtime by 6,7%, getting you prepared for raids slightly faster. And also reduces your chance of dying incase you ever get aggro from trash.
---
Yeah, I can be autistic too.
---
Watching him being denied the WW axe is some of the best streaming I’ve seen. The contrast between salty Asmongold and laughing Venruki (my horde perspective) was just golden.
---
I'm right there with you! Married, 4 kids, transitioning to a new job in July. I'll be working rotating shifts though, so you can bet I'll be playing WoW while I swap between day/night shift.
---
I’ve never use the auction house much at all tbh, it just seems like such a difficult thing to control.
---
I agree :)
---
Ah. No idea whether the ping is tolerable all the way over there, I'm in Norway. Seeing as the beta is quite narrow, it's hard to test these things too before the launch itself. I guess I'll just have to pass. :-( Good luck finding another one.
---
I am a parent of two and work random hours each week and as such I wont be able to keep a 100% attendance, I imagine I can manage hold up 80% atleast. I need a class that is desirable enough to still be wanted, I played a priset during vanilla and really dont feel like going priset again even though that is probably my best choice. My first choice would be warrior as a main tank but thats obviously out of question. Second choice would be a mage, but there will be plenty of those.
---
My main problem is that I want to feel useful as I did as a priest. Druid, paladin and shamans are out as I dont like being just okay at what I do. Hunter seem kinda good, I just never really enjoyed pets, but they are useful enough and probably wont be super populated. 
---
The thing im worried about though is if I would be attractive to any decent guilds with an 80% attendance as a hunter. Ive been a GM in retail for the last 4-5 years and I know how annoying it can be with raiders that cant keep close to a 100% attendance, that being said though I know all about running a successive guild and know of the worst annoyances guild management face and how to avoid it. Do you think any class would fot me vetter than Hunter though? I kinda figured on Hunter as I wrote this post tbh.
---
I specifically referenced that: "I'm not sure if number-wise this would be enough to allow the same number of people logged in concurrently as Blizzard hopes to allow with layering though."  
---
My thought is if you sharded/layered the starting zones enough, you could still allow the 9000 or whatever people online concurrently, but I don't have access to average number of characters per zone or by level or anything like that.
---
Maybe if Blizzard could just force all level 25+ to layer 1 and if you're below 25 and you group with someone 25 or above you always join their layer. So that way there would technically be 3-5 Un'Goros, but you wouldn't be able to access them unless you went solo at 24 or below.
---
Yeah I've watched his first few videos - I will be for sure using this as I'm playing a human warrior with the same proffs

Lore wise yes, it is original. What you're describing is just semantics. Don't give me that "it's only 3 words" nonsense.

'For the Horde' has been used since literally the first war, before the events of ToD, let alone Warcraft III and WoW.

So yeah, it's been a 'Horde' thing since the year 1994.

Um... Wrath, Cata
---
i was one of those crazy vanillas who had a kodo as an orc on the day they released the cloth turnin quests.
---
i spent quite a long time trying to get rep and my research back then showed it was only possible for alliance to get rep with humans due to sume repeatable quest giving some low (10ish?) rep per turnin.
---
back then some gnome did that and made the wow news. other than that i never heared of someone accomplishing that feat prior to the cloth turnins.

---
Ha! I remember that UI from ages ago. I always thought I’d try it out some day, but never did. Maybe this time around.
---
Can promise you that 1 server on EU and one on us, and it will be 2 of the most populated servers In the game
---
Kiting raid bosses (to an extent) did occur. Its always after a tank dies, and the best example I can think of is Patchwerk. Once he enraged he'd proceed to one shot people, and the normal strat was to spread out as he got close to enrage so that he would spend as much time as possible between the 1 shots. Hunters and rogues had the best chance of living (at least slightly longer) with FD and evasion/vanish respectively.
---
We’re getting dungeons as they were in 1.12, like everything else. It will be 10man.
---
They one dude says "PALLYS HAVE BETTER BUFFS" Like bitch IDGAF about your stupid Buff, I want my Jamaican accent JA MON!
---
More straw grasping.
---
You are, of course, factually false, as it was introduced in Warcraft I: Orcs and Humans.
---
I agree, the people thinking there will be 50+ servers are crazy.
---
How do I avoid it? Just ignore it! Play what you believe will make you the happiest from level 1.
---
Remember, you're going to be playing your main a LOT, even just to make it to 60. My hunter (started in 1.3) took me a little bit over 15 days /played to level. 
---
Can you imagine playing a character for that long just to realize you only picked it because of external bias, and not because it's what you wanted to play?
---
The reputation values are still off mate. The experience values are believed to be correct now but the reputation is definitely off.
---
On almost every poll, RP PvP have been 3x as huge as regular RP. That was before they said they don't think they will have RP PvP at launch.
---
For my gnomes I normally go with typical irl names that begin with "n" and throw a silent "g" in front.
---
BUTTERED TOAST BUTTERED TOAST
---
I meant staying awake for 3 days straight. 
---
 I think you will be surprised at how much the old world record will be broken. Like I wrote private server practice and tons of preparation people have done will change the time by a lot. Also as I wrote whoever is in the running for the first 60 spot will have people helping them in various ways.
---
 My guess will be around 3 days 8 hours or something will be the time it took for the first 60.
---
this is actually amazing
---
I cannot voucher firsthand, but I do believe someone else made a post or comment about it technically being used by the Alliance before the Horde was a thing? So lorewise it might not even be their's if you are considering it a unique saying?
---
Thanks for the criticism Zirzor.  I took advantage of it and added some videos from 2006 to my guide.  You do realize people didn't exactly stream everything they did in video games and post it on youtube back then right? Twitch didn't even exist yet, so these videos were a pain to actually find, but they're there.  I kept the private server videos up as basically they're more in-depth and explain things rather than just be a hunter with heavy metal music in the background soloing a dire maul tribute run.  I look forward to seeing your own gold guide, and I hope to maybe learn something from it. 
---
Thanks again
---
Sin
---
Would at least be a sick looking toon.
---
Lol I mean reseting and getting to full health/mana. Kiting a paladin on a warrior is just going to let him regenerate mana. When were you planning on doing damage, next year?
---
Shit you'd lose with a r14 warrior against a level 58 paladin.
---
Haha well you tell me :D
---
I'm not as far as you yet. I went with the advanced sphere grid option and I'm going all over the place. Following Yuna's route with Auron since I thought he could be some sort of cool paladin. Oh boy I've never been so wrong. Basically Auron became my main healer and Yuna became my mage. 
---
Still enjoying the hell out of it, especially the story.
---
One hand down.
---
I'm not going to dignify the "get aggro" response. We're not picking talents for scrubs.
---
There's no argument to be made that 3% dodge is better than 1.5 seconds on Gouge for survival.
---
Nor is there an argument to be made that 2% parry is better for farming than a 30% cooldown reduction on Sprint and Evasion.
---
But sure, if you're playing on a PVE server and not farming mobs with any slows, take 2% parry over a guaranteed Escape Artist without any cast time. Your loss. 
---
It still doesn't have any effect on your raid damage, whereas taking Piercing Howl does.
---
Wait... guys I have an idea. Why not make every single server RP and RP-PVP?
---
Did you grind all the way to 40 doing dungeons? If so how much time did it cost you? Its just interesting to see this new meta of doing dungeons as a valid way to speed level when it was always considered bad. It's totally possible just player skill changed the story, just seems surprising.
---
I agree, but im a lazy bastard and the original version of kiting was on the verge of being too much work for my lazy ass.
---
Anyways I still plan to do it for elites and other tougher scenarios where the tactic is necessary.
---
+1
---
Kek
---
if they limit the number of layers per realm then you'll still get queues.  if there's unlimited layers there will literally only be 1 realm with players on it
---
Yes of course they can but they won't. Forcefully relocating people will never be something they will want to subject their customers to
---
I mean there is alot of nuance to a duel and we cant break down every situation but you kite ret pallys so you arent taking extra unnecessary dmg and you can abuse intercept. Its not like im doing more dmg standing still waiting for my swing timer. Seems like you dont know much about pther classes. Typucal brain dead ret player
---
 Literally never lose to ret so you can say what you want but doesnt make it true.
---
Ok if it's dkp fair enough
---
Just a heads up though there's a reason you've been getting so many negative responses: your original comment comes off as if you are going to raid under the guise of being a healer for your guild when you have ulterior motives , and the ultimatum at the end doesn't help
---
Its possible you were just trying to make a point, just saying it comes across rude and deceitful
---
And your point about the coworker, every response I've seen has made this clear: it's not about you leaving or not wanting to heal. It's the way you say you're going to do it
---
If a colleague came into my workplace and got trained , made the office comfortable with their role/contribution/presence, then they left after getting a letter of recommendation, the whole time they were saying they were gonna be there for the long haul, yeah that would sting a bit. I wouldn't wish poorly upon them , id be glad I no longer had to work with that person, I'd wish them the best and move on but I mean I definitely wouldn't be happy with the situation that person left us with.
---
My mom always used to say "sometimes, it's not about what you say. It's about how you say it"
---
Best way to move is holding right click and moving with arrows and mouse imo.
---
WotLK sold 2.8 million copies in the first 24 hours.
---
Cata sold 3.3 million copies in the first 24 hours.
---
BFA (the game you guys love to shit on), was Blizzard's largest launch day ever at 3.4 million copies in the first 24 hours.
---
So, nope. Do not pass Go. Do not collect $200.
---
This is hilarious but doesn't make me feel better about the situation hahaha. I feel like that's exactly how it'll go down. I'll take your advice and go the slow route (maybe level up an alt with her rather than holding my main back). I don't expect her to stick to it but at least we'll try.
---
I know the feeling. As an adult in my 30s with a FT job, g/f, responsibilities, other hobbies, etc. I'm kinda jealous of all the people who plan on 'No-Lifing' Classic. I wish i could do that, but it just isn't possible at this point in my life. I'm lucky if I'll be able to get on more than 1 night per week. It's going to take me forever to hit 60 lol.
---
Don't worry. No amount of people explaining what fun is to you will change your perspective of what fun is.
---
The good news is again you have the option to kill all ai boars in the world without interruption.
---
Play what you want.
---
All specs are technically viable.
---
Of course, technically you can eat soup with a fork, it just takes a long time.
---
&gt; What's up with the shot near thunder bluff? Was that a glitch or did Naxx just roam around to faraway places
---
They didn't quite have the model they had for the ones similar to Acherus and what not back then, but if they did. These Mini-naxx's would've most likely been the model of Acherus (and the other ones you seen throughout Wrath)
---
futility_jp's pro movement guide:

---
Right there with ya. My wife and I burned up our first two years together playing WotLK. We had a great time but I totally understand the "coma" aspect. We dabbled with Legion but Blizzard changed it enough from what we were used to that it didn't grab us. We are so far removed from the game now and have new distractions (aka kids) that the ability to play the way we would want to play isn't a possibility anymore so we aren't going to make the leap. It sure would be nice though.
---
more people per server = less people on other servers.
---
zug zug brother
---
Please do this to all classes. Please.
---
turtles resistant to frost is blizzlike
---
Anecdotal, but yes. 
---
My plan for my Human Priest at 1 is to trek over to Teldrassil and essentially start there like I was a level 1 Nelf. IIRC, questing there, then Darkshore etc you’ll have enough rep without turn-ins around 42 for a Saber. It also helps I’m choosing a class that is available to Nelfs (vs pally, etc) so I don’t have to worry about bouncing all over for training.
---
Wanna play together? Lol
---
Very nice!
---
Kick my feet, kick my feet
---
The guides are for getting the cross faction mounts at level 40 which is certainly not possible in classic.
---
Yeah, which is part of the reason I wanted to make this post. Even if you made it completely impossible to exploit it in any way, I think there is a real problem with splitting higher level zones and lower level zones at the same rate.
---
Like Jagger IMO
---
&gt; The main issue I had with TBC was giving Paladin/Shaman to both sides. I hated this. It was the first step towards this type of "balancing" that has led us to the current state of the game - no talant trees and homogenized classes/builds.
---
If I recall, and I probably don't Horde in BC ended up getting the better Retlol paladin, Alliance got a better tank oriented one. Seal of Blood vs Vengeance.
---
Exalted at 42? That seems really fast, is that from private server experience or vanilla? If that's true I'll definitely do the same, I'm going human warrior this time so training should be no problem.
---
So the idea would be to at least replace RP by RP-PvP I suppose? Would that be enough? Since the number of servers would stay the same, I mean, it's more possible than adding a server.
---
Boi
---
&gt; Yes reputation is off on pservers, we don't really have that much information about it. If you do, then go find it and they will be happy to fix it. That's how pserver works, it's based of information, provide it and the servers will fix it.
---
Pandaria had existing lore in Vanilla. There was evidence in the Swamp of Sorrows and a couple quests that mention Chen.
---
Plus, you're forgetting that time travel is now canon in Classic, so we could have Azeroth before The Sundering and a ton of other possibilities.
---
As far as I understand, there's a technical cap to how big a server can be (ie queues), so no there can't be 9k concurrent players on a single server without layers.
---
&gt;having your game be randomly interrupted is fun, guys!
---
Well okay.
---
&gt;private server experience and reputation values are well known to be based off of post-TBC values.
---
This is false.
---
It'll still cost 12c per item (or stack). The new mail UI is a little nicer, but doesn't change the cost.
---
Should I ever just vendor BoEs, or always DE/AH?
---
That's the most RP-PvE thing I've ever heard
---
i dont get how people can be #nochanges and not support RP realms.  they where a thing back in the day
---
If you think PvP is the interruption, then you don't enjoy it.
---
It’s honestly really frustrating to have to fight for the right to roll on my preferred server. I just want to enjoy my classic experience with rp and pvp blizzard.
---
Going to be a dampened experience if I have to settle for less on a normal pvp or rp server.
---
Definitely Troll FOR Pve**** Definitely Orc FOR Pvp**** here, i fixed it.
---
Yeah, that's a little too far away from the Org bank.
---
&gt; There's no reason the SoR itself shouldn't be proccing it
---
SoR did not proc JoW back in the day. No seal proced any judgement or any weapon effect or enchant for that matter. I remember this being a major point of consternation for us paladin mains.
---
Paladin output and sustainability is going to be a whole lot lower than people expect it to be and all the pserver players who are hyped for paladins are gonna be disappointed.
---
You don't move in Classic WoW. You sit in your chair until you've completed all content for all phases, or you die trying and Blizzard claims another news story for their mantle.
---
Holding rightclick.
---
A bit skewed because people don't have to buy classic, just have an active sub. But I'm not sure they have 5 million subs left.
---
Hah, it was actually fun to remind the tank that a couple times during the stress test (did deadmines with a group of level 15s since that was max level, we took down the first boss but wiped to Sneed).
---
I was already planning on a bank alt with tailoring. It sounds like druid is the way to go, especially if I'm going to level up to 35 for professions anyway.
---
This is inherently false. The Alliance originally consisted of just humans, high elves and dwarves, shortly followed by Gnomeregan (a brief mention in the ToD novelisation).
---
It was formed by King Terenas and Anduin Lothar out of sheer necessity, for the second great war, after Llanes assassination and Stormwind was burned to the ground in the first by the original Horde. 
---
But the Horde indisputably predates the Alliance. Blackhand was the Warchief for the first war. Orgrim Doomhammer the second.
---
Yes, but since you'll be doing both, choose Troll. Your PVP trinket already gets rid of stuns, which should be enough to escape that pesky rogue.
---
Been having solid success trading healthstones for food/water/elite mob help while leveling in beta. People that expect stuff for free are the worst.
---
I will definitely be having an alt on that server
---
Holy shit. I was in Renascor!
---
Yea, I’m the weird one. I respond to your comment with one of my own and then you call me a retail player (which I’m not btw), in an attempt to insult me then you play the victim. But I’m the weird one..
---
&gt;Bug report: paladin players who use lay on hands while trying to gank players were not properly feeling a sense of shame. This has been corrected and paladin players now correctly are fully aware of their disappointed fathers or embarrassed spouses.

---
Man it’s been so long, I can’t remember haha
---
so you think mage would synergize better?
---
Pandaria was mentioned in Warcraft 3 even.
---
Chen Stormstout was a hero there.
---
&gt; when it comes to vanilla - there's a difference between what makes sense and what actually happens
---
truer words have not often been spoken
---
This is my memory from 2005-06. I would absolutely not take it as fact. But I was pretty sure around 42ish if you started in Tel and did damn near every darn rep you could you’d have it just a bit past 40. The human racial for rep bonus also was a factor but I don’t remember it’s percentage off the top of my head.
---
If you do both it would be just dumb to choose Troll tbh... 25% stun resist+ the base stun resist is just too op in pvp and when a rogue can cc chain you forever you'll be happy to have an Orc.
---
wasn't a lot of that fixed in stress test? Fast spawn times and the respawn for weapons was insane.
---
I need this to be a comic series now
---
yeah but I mean, if you look at how many links existed between classic and somewhere like outland or northrend, they felt very much like a part of the world, and there loads of characters and even whole races with very strong links to these places.
---
there wasn't a single NPC from, or had even been to, pandaria until the expansion dropped, and besides mentions of one character in one tiny corner of the world, it's hard to say they were part of classic wow 
---
I know they were in warcraft 3, but there's a reason they were then completely ignored for the first 8 years of wow's lifespan
---
That’s for the heads up. Just been out of the game awhile and wanted to refresh my memory
---
[I've only got legion, sadly](https://i.imgur.com/mhtXZP1.jpg)
---
Seems against the grain, but I'm in agreement for food and water. If a mage is sitting there idle in town, they could have just premade stacks of water and food in idle time. There's no real loss for them to make it. 
---
Old guild mate in vanilla literally named his  mage "Freewater" and never charged people for food or water.
---
Probably. It's not worth disenchanting anything else with an alt.
---
Most blues are either BoP, or sell on the AH for far more than you would get from disenchanting them.
---
If your main has enchanting, you'll probably end up disenchanting a whole lot of soulbound blues that you don't want.
---
Noone is going to take a ret into a premade BG over a Mortal Strike Warrior EVER. They fulfill the same role as a warrior, but do a way worse job of it. And they go OOM. They are garbage.  
---
 When you know nothing about a class, it's better to keep silent.
---
This was done on an empty server where he is completely uncontested.  He is also a hunter which is by far the strongest solo leveler.  That is not a realistic depiction of a launch leveling experience for most people, which is why dungeon grinding becomes more appealing
---
&gt; Increased attack speed traded for reduced damage.
---
Reduced base weapon damage... But at the same time a whole lot more attack power. The end result is more DPS than just autoattack.
---
He should just play elemental.
---
Go with all cloth and hit% if he wants to raid, or just be a sane person and go Ele resto and heal in raids then put on mail sp gear to PvP with.
---
Even Hearthstone, a F2P game, didn't have more than 5 million players on launch day.
---
We should play for fun and be relaxed about it. Fun is addicting of course but another aspect is the addiction of "progress". We want to get a more powerful character, grind that rep, grind those raids over and over to get loot etc. Nothing wrong with that as long as you have a clear perspective. It shouldn't feel more important than it is. It is actually not important at all and soon you will stop caring even though it might not seem like it at the time. The decked out warrior you worked so hard on and spend nights gearing up instead of doing real life stuff will mean zero to you soon.
---
 What I mean is we invest time in a character and try gearing them up but eventually we WILL lose interest in the game. At that point all your "hard work" will mean nothing to you. You will be burned out on the game, stop playing and your character will be rotting away in an unused account. It's just how it goes. Important to remember that.
---
 Not a native English speaker but hopefully some of my ramblings were possible to understand.
---
Yeah, I never remember pickpocket being even close to great gold when i tried it back in the day. Anecdotal obviously, but it did surprise me when these pickpocket guides came out acting like youre gonna make this mad gold/hour doing it. Maybe there are just a few spots that are much more profitable? Or maybe there's gonna be some disappointed rogues come classic. Not sure.
---
Thanks. I appreciate these videos. What seems to be the best 1-20 route?
---
It’s quite obvious that I’m stating any elitism people are deriving from Classic should not affect how their play the game. Nice to know I hit a nerve.
---
What if they add caverns of time instances where you serve the infinite flight and prevent future expansions from happening?
---
BRD is good farming for rogues, but not because of picking pockets, because of Dark Iron ore.
---
Well kinda in a way. You’ll be able to enjoy the tier 1 as bis for phase 1. The tier 2 will take multiple phases to all be released and the tier 3 not until the last phase. So I don’t really see a problem
---
I have heard some guilds doing raiding every two weeks. So Monday night. Tuesday reset. Tuesday night so you get 2 of these sessions every month since content is very easy. I hope that helps choosing a class.
---
Gonna be fine on oce servers with layering unless we only get one server then will
---
Be kinda a shit show
---
At least MoP didn't give you flying before you'd hit max level and earned it. They got that right.
---
forgot ill test now
---
I heard that Macedin stole all the gold from one of his guilds and bought motorcycle mounts for him and his friends.
---
Poggerindachattuh!
---
it's from a mara quest that requires you to kill a few bosses. Once you have the scepter you can open a port from the outdoor Mara area into the last section of the dungeon with Princess in it.
---
Even with sharding?
---
Ah, so you actually saw this in game? Personally?
---
Fair enough, I thought it might just be that the databases are scraping irrelevant data, like for example, how you can get 63 spells in classicdb.ch if you search for "QA", as in "Quality Assurance". Sort of a "we were thinking about making this spell, but it never actually went live in this format."
---
we gotta kill deathwing before he causes the cataclysm and develops the LFR system
---
If you are planning to play fair a bit you could level both.
---
Nah that was Scylla, Triangle and Crimsonice
---
doesn't work
---
I'd be happy if they made lower level dungeons and expanded content for "twinking". Make all the PvP brackets into their own endgame. I'm not fond of creating new level 60 content unless the gear is just expanded rather than constant upgrades that force people to farm new stuff every month or three.
---
Everyone says Orc for PVP, but PVP is when the Troll racial can more realistically be used at a high percentage increase. Burst is good against every hero, and you have a lot of it combined with Rapid Fire. Stuns tend to be focused on melee classes, which hunters are already good against with kiting. 
---
Not saying stun resist isn't amazing, but every single race gets by with out it with their own strengths. If you are really serious about PVP you will have FAP's and LAP's too, which negate a lot of use of the Orc racial. So many fight factors and consumables will determine a fight before the racial does, and I think painting it as a pure black and white is a disservice when the comparison is much closer than people make it out to be.
---
PVP shadow is fun, very strong in small encounters.
---
PVE most of the raid usually run one for shadow weaving for warlock DPS. Shadow struggles with mana ..... thye have good damage but no way to recover mana.

---
Keep backpedal, but on a less useful key bind.
---
What's the point of changing your strafe key from Q and E to A and D?
---
Jenkins!
---
deadmines still took 3 hours even for a group of nerds like asmongold was running with.
---
Well two races share a start zone so expect them to be more popular
---
&gt; So you're supposed to rebind A and D to strafe and also get rid of backpedal. 
---
I wouldn't unbind backpedal key. I have played without backpedal binded in order to free up one more hotkey but it's not something I would recommend. Since we can bind a key with shift/ctrl and alt as a modifier there are so many possible keybinds. No need to free up backpedal. Backpedal has its uses sometimes and it feels more natural to have all directions binded in a wasd fashion or similar.
---
[I understood that reference](https://i.stack.imgur.com/nGMrD.gif)
---
The dankest timeline.
---
Which part? The **"experience"** part, the **"reputation values"** part of the **"post-TBC values"** part?
---
You then rebind Q and E to abilities.
---
Does it switcheroo for Druids?
---
lol I'd be down. Together we can be the last ones on the server to hit 60!
---
I think Engineering will be popular this way around because of PVP and Streamers. So I would definitely keep mining either for money or for your engineering. With mining herbalist becomes a bit awkward. So skinning it you want both gather, or Engineering if you want to have some funzies.
---
I just want them to add all of the cut content. That way it’s keeping with the spirit of classic. I think some additional raids and dungeons would provide a great opportunity for sets for different specs that don’t already have pve tier gear, and would be an easy way to provide horizontal progression that’s compelling. I’d also like to see pvp sets for all specializations added at some point, too, for similar reasons. 
---
Maybe even add specializations to all the crafting professions too (tailoring, alchemy, and enchanting), and of course new recipes for every profession could be available as drops to spice them up. 
---
But I’m not about new races, new continents, new talent trees, or flying mounts. Just flesh out Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor, and round out the loot for so every class has access to relevant gear for each of their specializations.
---
As a regular rper who likes rp-pvp and world pvp I’m going to be rolling on a pvp server. I’d rather be able to world pvp.
---
30c/item you are correct.
---
Never trust a Triangle
---
Yeah "Snapshotting" is the term used for this, and it was definitely present in MoP still.
---
I would play a certain private server that’s moving to TBC
---
I'm going to be tailoring + enchanting. I don't want tipping it's awkward, just pay me upfront for a service ! Non USA player.
---
They used to care. My friend had to rename his monk. Name was Puuping.

Both was fixed almost 2 years ago. Reputation is still off on many fronts yes, but it's not just "based on TBC".

U cant open a website and look at the 4 racials? Not hard to figure out...

Thing is, there are a looooot of people who would play classic WoW, but wouldn't play on a private server.

I said the same thing when they legalized weed in Canada last October. All the pot smokers were saying that nobody would buy it from the government, and everyone would continue buying it illegally. What happened? Most cities were sold out within hours of opening on day one. There continue to be supply issues. People also continue to buy from the black market.
---
The demand is already high. When a legal version is available, lots of people are down for it. WoW Classic will be just like legal weed in Canada.
---
I feel like if you don't log out in in over 72 hours. Blizz should log you out. For your own good lol.
---
You can smell the MS paint dry.
---
I mean, I have a wife, so most nights yeah.
---
I don't have experience with rogues, so I can't really compare- I just know that mage/pally is a good combo for aoe. Rogue/paladin would be okay in the same sense that any dps+paladin combo should work okay. 
---
Druid/rogue is a nifty combo for stealth opportunities if you don't mind competing for leather gear.
---
They level squish retail to 60 at next xp and it becomes retail vs classic: the battle for Warcraft?
---
Lol nobody wants it. Deal with it.
---
haha that is true lol
---
What if they just had diablo style door rooms like ‘manriks basement’
---
It took me 14 days /played doing exactly this on a warrior. Not efficient by any means, but it was fun and I hit 60 decked in full blues with 1/4 of my bis
---
So in my original reply I said experience was fixed, not sure what you're raging about on that one. How was reputation fixed?  
---
I'm 95% positive at this point you didn't even read my reply, so I'm not going to delve any further into each of your points, considering they've mostly all been addressed in my original reply.  
---
Cheers m8. Get laid, smoke some weed, go for a jog. Do something to de-rage dude.
---
That's a good advice, though I personally don't find S to be a particularly good keybind, then again I'm spoiled with a MMO mouse ;)
---
My roommate and I bought gold. No shame
---
Do the right thing Blizzard. Give us RP-PVP!
---
There are NPCs that swap arrows for bullets for free. From what I remember you will use all three Guns, Bows and Crossbows as you level and get gear.
---
Alliance hunter may have a bit of trouble since hunter used to be a popular class for Alliance. 
---
Mage leveling is VERY boring unless you AOE grind.... Even Raid DPS is without exaggeration frost bold spam in MC. 
---
If you go any cloth you HAVE to take tailoring as there is a BOP tailor chest that is BiS till like BWL  
---
Mages are easier to gear on Alliance since Alliance historically does not play mages or warlocks unlike Horde.
---
Had good times on "Das Syndikat". Hope i find my mates anywhere from "Der Schattenrat". I sadly left in week one or two of BC on the entrance to zangar marsh. I was dissapointed that this great world was left behind. 
---
Old raids - abbadoned. Farming evenings in BRD with RP and always new friends - gone. Open PvP in 60 zones - gone. Even Alterac wasn't a calm place anymore, where we did a lot of RP and had great battle nights. So much changed, that i felt sad and i realised, stepping through the dark portal was really feeling like leaving azeroth forever. Was sad for months.
---
 Came back later because of friends but damn, missed these times.
---
Glad you enjoyed it. That's how it felt.... just... even writing it up again brought back some memories.
---
I had the same feeling at pre-cata patch WotLK. Hadn't logged in for a week and saw it as a good time to leave. I am also worried about addiction, but I think that I will naturally move away from the game if it stops being enjoyable the same way I did last time, faster probably because I know what to look for. You're older now, more mature, you'll probably be the same.
---
How do you know a Druid is Canadian?
---
They only use [Rank 1 Rebirth](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17034/maple-seed).
---
The chat is the best.
---
"It smells like wipe"
---
"Marc, would you like some cheese with your whine?"
---
will WoW Classic really have all of the retail wow macro libraries?
---
this is like entering a cab with some fuel expecting a free ride.
---
Hahaha that would be so meta. If after naxx retail and vanilla somehow connected with each other and split the timelines. Too bad they already did a bunch of timeline nonsense in WoD
---
The biggest/best thing about RP realms is that they don’t have sharding/layering because it interferes with RP and community events. They are the only realms on retail to not have sharding
---
You are correct. Though I would argue if you enjoyed your time playing that character it wasn’t exactly wasted time.
---
Follow your bliss.
---
I played Horde on a pvp server in vanilla. I changed class at 40 and started again because I was so sick of being ganking and corpse camped, I went feral druid so I could stealth. That says a lot. I think both sides are as bad as the other.
---
I like the one that has more space devoted to dps meter than raid frames. Also, most people are left eye dominant, so clearly dps meter needs to go on that side, raid frames can go on the right.
---
Aint no dps needs to know how many people are alive, that shit is for healers.
---
uhm what? part of the point of layering is so there are no q times
---
No there would be at least 4 in NA. PvP pve pvp-streamer pve-streamer.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9LiqP5dovw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9LiqP5dovw)   
---
This?
---
Depends on what you want to do. If you want to raid it'll be tough since it'll feel like a job when you can't enjoy other aspects aside from farming and raiding. I couldn't hack it at least. 
---
PvP is slightly different, since you only need a few pieces of decent gear and you're good. One Naxx comes out that may change and obsolete you, but by then you'll no doubt have decent relationships enough that you can get geared up by progression guilds who have content on farm. Maybe choose your class based on which classes have the best drops from farmed raids (hunter?).
---
You can also be more greedy, such as charging people for tanking/healing their instance run and negotiating harder for dibs on gear so you spend less time farming and such. 
---
I'll be starting an ingame business like I did in original vanilla. I hit the gold cap twice over pretty damn quick and didn't have to farm for years. That didn't equate to spending less time on the game unfortunately, but it was more fun by far.
---
Really, the only thing you should know is use your mouse to turn, and always turn sideways and strafe rather than backpedaling. Also have all of your abilities bound to keys you can press while continuing to move and without taking your hand off your mouse. I use a razer naga with the 12 thumb buttons so it's kind of like cheating even though I only use 9 of them.
---
I leave backpedal because sometimes I use it when I'm not doing real content, like when I'm jumping around town or positioning myself for a screenshot.
---
Also because I'm lazy I leave A and D as turn so that if I'm autorunning a long distance while chatting I can turn without touching my mouse. You still strafe while holding down right mouse button, which is what I do.
---
This is what I mean: https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/c69693/the_first_use_of_the_phrase_for_the_horde_was_by/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

---
Unless you're in a guild group or using voice comms this will happen quite a lot. Ironically, only healers pay attention to party frames, so 9 out of 10 times the tank will not check to see if the healer is OOM and just keep pulling.
---
Another issue is that most players are in a bleeding hurry all the time, they want to get the dungeon completed as soon as possible. It's very rare to be in a group that actually takes their time when it's not absolutely necessary.
---
There are situations where you need S key to move backwards but generally that's just for tanks. Otherwise keybind everything, don't use keyboard to turn, only for strafing.
---
I still have keyboard turning bound just so I can eat with my right hand while auto moving and pressing one of the move keys to change direction but you might as well take turning off the binds.
---
Maybe the original artwork this background is taken from is more snow and blue, rather than ash and red.
---
And the specialization Arms I'd imagine gives the first impression that it specializes in big, badass weaponry. Frostmourne is definitely the most recognizable, famous/infamous weapon in the Warcraft universe.
---
I can sort of see how all of this made sense back when it was made.
---
Looking back I didn't realize this (played a Gnome myself in vanilla) and didn't realize this was lifted in WotLK, because I was going to say I swear I had a Paladin in Cata that rode one.  Good to know then, that's one less rep to grind.
---
For some reason i thought plank was the mob
---
lol ooga gang vs zug zug gang
---
He did have 100% accuracy on anybody we did ask, but the sample size was small. Basically edgy haircuts, or shaved heads are horde players. Barbershop/generic/normie haircuts were Alliance.
---
Are you trying to go for a no shield block build? Only reason I can think of for your extremely +def heavy picks and no points in improved shield block.
---
Like other people have said you can tank UBRS in any spec, but the one you linked has a lot of strange decisions and your gear list suggests you value defense waaaaaay too much. I'll make a detailed breakdown if you're interested. I don't want to come off preachy.
---
That doesn't sound like the polite thing to do eh? What kind of hoser would let his bud die like that. I'd be biffed. My gitch would be knotted all up. 
---
I'd take a loser loumosine to the nearest LC and get him a two four a Pil
---
Yes absolutely. I’m super excited. However, I just got married and the next thing on the list is babies. Which is great and all, but I gotta get to 60 and kill some dragons dangit!
---
What a sexslave
---
Thanks OP. I'm working on an animated music video right now (not WoW related) and have put in probably a couple hundred hours in so far. I'm maybe a little over halfway done. I work a full time job and have had to devote all my free time to it. I was thinking about taking the night off but this gave me the motivation to hit the computer.
---
Yes if it was fun and you didn't forsake real life stuff for it then it wasn't wasted. It was wasted however if you played despite not enjoying it because you felt you just had to have item or reputation x etc.
---
The uses of a single in-game quote from a mass produced orc unit does not constitute the "first time use" in terms of lore. It's silly talk.
---
The first Horde was the unifying of all the different orc clans and the whole 'For the Horde' thing was originally conceived by Ner'Zhul and later piggybacked by both Blackhand and Gul'Dan.
---
This was attested to by Garona's account of events as well.
---
The fucking beads of sweat get me every fucking time.
---
Yeah, that seems like the most balanced and tactical way to do it. Some people want every Cata zone introduced, and like 5 raid tiers. Thats just a little much for me, but if they keep it short and sweet, and supplemental to the original game, than sign me up.
---
do you ever use Q and E to strafe or just right-click + A + D?
---
Alternatively, be a good healer and never be oom.
---
Drink aggressively, always be close to the next pull as a pull is about to end so that you can drink until the last possible second and not have to worry about getting in range.
---
Ways to set up drink pulls:
---
Priest: PW:S + renew + spam drink hotkey and pray it goes off before combat
---
Shaman: stoneskin totem + magma totem
---
Paladin: blessing of sacrifice + eat and drink

Druid: regrowth + rejuv + spam drink hotkey

Indeed

I ran a test on the beta server after I read your post that may or may not help. I did the very first orc quest on an orc and received 50 reputation. I did the same quest on a level 36 mage and it gave **5**. So if you do a quest when it's grey to you, **you appear to get only 10% of the original reputation**.
---
way to pick the statement apart to ignore the point
---
Ooo controversial. 
---
Back pedalling is currently the most optimal way to kite or create distance when close vs melee. Due to the cataclysm melee attack range bonus atm in the game. That only triggers when both entities are moving or jumping besides backpedaling. 
---
Plus the additional swing lag compensation from Melee leeway with the server tick batching. 
---
Crazy I know, hopefully it’s fixed soon but it’s currently those two combined that make it possible to melee hit something from way to far a distance. 
---
Sources if interested is from North the mage/Ale(might be wrong spelling) and Taladril all highly informed turbo nerd beta testers.
---
Correct. It scales down. I didn't include this feature in my reply because it's not directly relevant to total rep values.
---
I did this. Can confirm
---
holy shit YEZ! thank you SO MUCH!
---
I recommend BAWLS
---
Shit I forgot about that tabard. hype
---
this guy fucks
---
Not trying to be a Mrs Sourpants but.. we're gonna play Classic a couple weeks or months in, when layering is going to be removed. Until then, it's a changed version of the game. 
---
Just saying to make sure people don't expect exactly the same game upon logging in, only to get disappointed when they notice something is quite off.
---
Legion was the best MMORPG Launch I've ever witnessed. Smooth, lagfree for the most part and few bugs.
---
Just play a warlock. Mages are trashy. You get 1 mage that rolling ignite wins the meter contest. The rest are just sitting there with thier soft little dicks waiting for thier turn.
---
While I agree no one will be 60 in 1 sitting, people will definitely try to account share to 60, probably taking 12 hour shifts.
---
Whether blizzard does anything about it, we'll see, because technically(even though staying up 6 days straight is physically impossible unless you're under extremely perfect circumstances) they can't prove it was more than 1 person if it's the same IP.
---
MoP actually got a lot of things right like the cinematic was epic, seeing Chen again, and emn, the warlock glyph that turned you into a half demon was pretty cool if a bit useless. Okay they didn't get much right..
---
I know what I want name my tauren warrior now
---
How did you turned off ui (for screen shot) in classic ? I thought they added this option in TBC ?
---
This sounds so good, if Blizzard changes their minds and adds RPPVP + EU region servers I'd consider playing an Alt there to experience some of these tales.
---
Apologies, I misread and thought maybe it was because he was level 25. I now understand that he was level 25 when he posted, but was level 1 when he started.
---
Ya it's definitely a lot better on PvP servers. Just taking a break from the shit Show. Especially in the phase 2 nightmare to end all nightmares
---
I don't. Will stop being a pally for the first time after 4 or maybe 5 years. Because ret is dogshit.
---
I'll just roll a mage.
---
I got so annoyed by the small movement that happened every time I hit S to cancel a spellcast that I bound S to a stopcast macro instead.
---
Spent like 39-42 farming black whelps.  Kept the pet.
---
Looking forward to grind red whelps this time around.
---
Is there...another princess? That's what I thought too.
---
ouga ouga ouga chakka!
---
But my original point was that the first use as a battlecry was reportedly made by the Alliance, not the Horde until Thrall used it. The United States of America being thus created and named is different from the first time someone chants "U.S.A! U.S.A!". I am not talking about whether 'The Alliance' or 'The Horde' was named.
---
I thought hunters already beat rogues most of the time
---
Yeah, it seems like when they focused on "people not disappearing when you go from Elwynn to Westfall" they didn't think about what it does to the game. Especially since when the levels will be bottom heavy, it will make the game completely empty for the top because they should not be layered.
---
I believe that was in the fabled "Stupider Mage Tricks", which was the follow up to the highly successful "Stupid Mage Tricks".  
---
Faxmonkey was amazing.
---
Very true, but if they were horde I'd probably just make the warrior :p
---
Literally took me under a minute to find. You needed to make a thread asking for help?  
---
Your google-fu is shit, brøther :p
---
That orc chix is hot tho
---
It is just me or old blood elven faces (pre model revamp) look somewhat more realistic the current ones?
---
No it only shows their sweet vanilla tears
---
If only we knew what the question was ...
---
It's not like they have to migrate every Classic server to TBC.  It's not an all or nothing.
---
No Rp-pvp server? They havnt even confirmed an oceanic server!
---
One of the earliest contested zones with a lot of quests for both factions, as well as a couple of niche gold farming spots, the fishing tournament, the arena
---
So DoubleD is undead, Eddy is a troll and Ed is an orc...what's Johnny? :d
---
I would say that’s very selfish of you, but really that statement is stupid in itself. Looking at the threads,discord’s and now a change petition for rp-pvp it’s obvious that it’s wanted.
---
It’s perfectly fine if you personally don’t want it but don’t be that person who tries to talk for others. It’s not a good look.

---
Yeah but are ass in pvp in comparison.
---
Ah you are correct. I’m thinking raw attack power bonuses (like dalrends) which gives it to both equally. My bad
---
He does have a point though, the high amount of low levels will create tons of layers and the low amount of high level players will be spread out way too much making the game seem dead for everyone that is ahead of the curve.
---
If there are 30000 players on a server that makes 10 layers, if 100 made it to 50+, you might have 10 on 1 layer 5 on another 30 on another etc, there might be a layer where there is only 1 level 50+ and he won't see anyone beside him.
---
If you have the starting funds it isn't that hard at all.
---
you do know what the RP in MMORPG means right?
---
Ah, Prairie People... 
---
32% of the land, 
---
18% of the people, 
---
11% of the job prospects, 
---
7% of the intelligence,
---
100% of the stereotypes.
---
The hardest part is the leveling, but it wouldn’t be so bad. Pick up 4 gathering professions and you’re totally set mount/ability wise.
---
Also as someone else said, keeping up the rested bonus on both is a nice benefit.
---
This reminds me of the time in vanilla I caught an alliance player in the wild and ganked her. Mind you I was getting yanked all the time by groups of the alliance so it was my time to bank. I ganked her killed her once and went about my business. This was in 1k needles salt flats. I shit you not maybe 5 minutes later her entire guild shows up, ganks corpses camps me, /spit /rude. I basically had to call it quits. I either ganked a GMs alt or a GMs wife to get that kind of over reaction.
---
There are rp pvp servers confirmed
---
1500 is an insignificant number

FINAL WARNING
---
I am next to line for the throne and a trained swordsman of Eqinox Ballderia in my larp kingdom. You have been warned.
---
Maybe once I hit 60 and I’ve got less things to do, I’ll dedicate some some to just undercutting people that want to control the economy of certain resources. Just for laughs
---
Paladins have blessings that you can put on specific classes.  Divine shield healing is very cluch along with bop if no interupts.  You have cleanse that removes a lot at a time, along with freedom.  You have blessing of sacrifice to self damage to remove polymorph / blind.  You are very tanky with a lengthy stun.  Block is very underrated. Auras you can change at will to give group increased resistances / armor.  Lay on hands.  There is more depending on which talent route you choose too.
---
If they redo TBC I agree with you and think it should be its own server.
---
Arenas. Need arenas.
---
Lmfao!! I wish I was working on my masters. Filthy blonde. Yes, no substances besides a Bang for work Haha
---
They did fix tons of stuff, but yes there are a lot more to go.
---
Just imagine how retarded people have to be that said there is no beta needed because Vanilla has already been made 15 years ago.
---
North, you are legend, man.  From your twitch stream, to your calls to the countdown podcast, (just finished listening to the one on leeway) and great videos like this, thanks for all your content.  Ive been really enjoying it and it’s great for the community.
---
There are SO MANY guides out there that are completely based on private servers. Hope that more guides come out based on the findings of beta players to replace these...
---
Spelladin dead before it even lived
---
I'm pretty concerned.
---
Same way man. I think that's the appeal for me at least. The feeling of being young again, but also way better at the game than I was lol.
---
Depending on the bug, severity and priority. They are getting fixed but I wouldn't expect constant client updates. I feel we will get one the final month with many updates and an eventual release candidate.
---
Yeah personally I'm more interested in "classic plus" than TBC

---
Fuck no
---
Personally I don’t give a shit about RP servers, that just isn’t for me, and the language severs not being seperated won’t effect me,
---
BUT, I just don’t see why not... Why can’t they give people 2 servers with RP-PVP, the only thing that changes is GM handling, right? And why aren’t there designated language realms? Who would want to play on a realm where they can’t speak to others? And if you speak several languages, can’t you choose what servers to play on-on retail?
---
I’ve been the first to advocate for the Classic team, I understand people’s distrust with them because of retail over the years, but they’ve been great. They’ve been open to communication with the fan base and they’ve been working their butts off to get us what we want.
---
I just don’t understand why they wouldn’t give people the basic foundation for playing their game.
---
Not really concerned at all
---
 [https://giphy.com/gifs/ByUDWjce12r3q](https://giphy.com/gifs/ByUDWjce12r3q)
---
The other side says that if there are seperate servers then the fan base would be even more divided between retail, classic, and the new tbc. So many people say that after a few years it’d make sense for it to progress into tbc, there doesn’t seem to be much to do after you clear nax
---
I am totaly agains all kinds of rushing through vanila content, but hey, if it is fun for you, why not.
---
If they push TBC on anything other than their own severs compartmentalizaed from Vanilla I'm out.
---
I farmed ungoro for rich thorium to get arcane crystals. Sold a loooot of arcane crystals.
---
Not really, the game was balanced around not being optimal.  The damage different is even less on trash monsters the 1-2% is bosses only.  Also weapon skill has zero effect in pvp.  So if you want to base the class you look at all the time on a very marginal dps increase on 3-4 hour a week content that is your choice.  If you choose to pick better pvp options that is also your choice.  Race doesn't matter in classic, it's a private server meme.
---
and said paladin being a creature of shadow magic in part will feel the agony of the light because the light is diametrically opposed to shadow. priests can tolerate the pain because it doesnt course through their being
---
To me that defeats the entire purpose of Classic. That said, I wouldn’t mind independent frozen servers of Vanilla, TBC and WoTLK. I think you’d have a healthy market and community for all three.

---
&gt;Priest: PW:S 
---
No. This isn't retail. Shield blocks rage generation as the tank isn't getting hit.
---
This is fucking gold, I need more Ed, Edd, and Eddy memes
---
They are fixing more than people realize. They don't announce it, they just push it out. Example: AOE leeway was fixed within 48 hours of discovery.
---
Also do note that bugs are fixed on a priority basis. Animations and other non-gameplay bugs will be at the bottom of the list due to not actually breaking the game.
---
You contradicted yourself in your own comment.
---
I got to I think the 8th boss in Uldir with a guild full of RL friends. Couldnt get farther and we got burnt out. It was fun though while it lasted. 
---
I didnt get to experience any of the end game content of vanilla, I hit like 50 ish as TBC came out. So that's a huge excitement for me.
---
Most people use their feet.
---
DUDE epic idea lmfao. They cant complain about that at all haha.
---
thanks, i hate it
---
No rep tabards, shared achievements, great art and music, good instances, good raid mechanics, treasures &gt; archaeology, pet battles (some people love it, others dont have to give a shit), scenarios, brawler's guild, improvements to secondary professions, dailies that actually give you shit.
---
But most importantly, MoP was by far the best leveling and questing experience of any expansion to-date.
---
I tried to play Nost, but once blizzard announced classic live servers it felt like a waste and I didn't want to continue:/ it was fun though. I'm so excited man!
---
I say just skip Cata and go straight to MoP. Yes please!
---
People will just leave and go back to pservers, just like before Classic was announced. And by your logic these people already divided the fan base, so I don't see any problem here.  
---
Millions of players are playing WoW, it's not like servers will be empty because of that.
---
The picture we have of the game may be several iterations behind what they are working with in the office every day. There may be MANY MANY more bugs that are fixed and we just dont know about them yet. I expect a lot of things to come together very shortly but also am a realist and know that there will still be some bugs on launch, wouldnt be a vanilla experience without them tho right?
---
same
---
A lot of people are interested in just classic with nothing else. I can see that getting boring once all the content has been cleared, so i'd at least like the option to transfer our characters to a new TBC server and continue from there.
---
1.13
---
I'd love to see a better story and more 40 man raids.  Not really interested in flying mounts either.  I'd rather be an underappreciated foot soldier for the horde instead of the hero of a bad story.
---
You may need to click things for targeting while moving or mouseover an object in the environment farther away for a tooltip, etc. You'll need a free mouse to do those things.
---
Yeah I heard that was kind of a big problem for a lot of people. I feel exactly the same way. No MMO has ever been able to come close and I've tried so many. I've tried single player games as well, but they're just not my style. Played a lot of LoL, but eventually the changes being made to that game were terrible as well. 
---
Just glad to jump back on the horse lol
---
Yes other ranged classes can. She is a kite fight. If you can deal ranged damage, then she can be soloed. So best: (note she can be done as melee but takes much longer)
---
* **Best:** hunter, druid
---
* **Good:** warlock
---
* **Possibly:** Mage, priest, shaman,
---
* **probably not:** Warrior, Rogue, paladin.
---
I have done it on hunter/druid and warlock. Priest should be able to do it and and not sure if shaman can. Not sure if Mage can even get to her (you'd have to kill a few packs along the way and sustain through it).
---
What are you talking about
---
Same! I mean, I played about 6 months of vanilla. Then TBC came out, so I never really got to FULLY experience its end game glory. So I'm so excited.
---
Not really concerned, no.
---
The same team that made Azurite UI. It feel good but I'm fine with the standard for now... Until I reroll.
---
Bombs make a difference PVE too. Also having jumper cables and ports are nice. The question is what would you get instead and is it better? For the most part engineering is only good for the engineer. Other crafting professions are good for helping others. But end game yes having Engineering on you main is BIS.
---
More of this plz! I feel a comic coming on!
---
Please make more of these! This is like the golden age of memes good.
---
Warcraft III is such a great game. The cutscenes and plot are absolutely tremendous. 
---
I really wish they would make a Warcraft IV as a prequel to WoW 2. But I highly doubt that will ever happen.
---
Not really sure to be honest man. As cliche as it sounds as I make a post about classic, but i was just spending entirely too much time playing. Realistically for no GOOD reason, other than the occasional enjoyment of games. Eventually all the games I had been playing turned into complete and unbearable garbage so I just quit. Then I tried to play other single player games and those just were not appealing at all. 
---
I know classic wow is a "waste" of my time, but Damnt I just wanna have some fun lol.
---
Hype is not a train... it is a river. It ebbs and flows.
---
The main thing is what 2 hand weapon you end up with.  In my experience, trying to play ret is INCREDIBLY gear/weapon dependent.  You're also probably going to have to go holy for raids because no halfway decent raiding guild is going to take a paladin for dps unless they've already got the raid you want to attend on farm.  All that being said, if you can manage a full set of t1 and a great 2 hander, you should be able to be decent in BGs.  At minimum, you'll need a weapon on par with Zin'Rokh to do decent damage.  Obsidian Edged Blade probably won't be good enough.
---
If Buttered Toast isn't their guild name...
---
Suck a fat dick, a couple thousand losers mean shit. Much like your existence and opinion all shit.
---
As you said, the vanilla balance has many flaws and it's up to each player to decide where their priorities lie. Some people value performance over fun, some people value PvP strenght over PvE efficiency... Nobody can really pick for you, it's up to you to weight all the pros and cons of each class but it's also important to tone down the wishful thinking and be realistic about the balance. 
---
Personally I've been a druid main for my entire retail WoW life and, while I picked the class back in 2005 expecting to be a tank in raids eventually, all my expectations fell flat and I was forced to respec and heal throughout all my vanilla raiding experience. I hated it and deeply regreted my class choice up until WotLK balance. Being a hybrid class with very niche usage outside of healing really sucks and I'm not going through that again come classic. If I want to tank and be a melee DPS on occasions, I'm going to play a Warrior. It may not be my favorite playstyle, but it's the best efficiency/fun ratio for me right now. Farming MCP for days as a feral druid to achieve average DPS at best is not good enough for me.
---
I know right? I could be wasting 2 months playing the game!
---
Wow didn't notice spirit tap. Does it work if your party kills a mob, or do you have to do the final hit?
---
Still worth if you cast your heals ooc as they won't generate threat and the shield will be broken in a few seconds. Also since the tank isn't stopping between pulls her should be aware of having a priest healer and end pulls with 50 or more rage.
---
Yeah, those missing trees make the game downright unplayable and should be the highest priority...
---
Just give me your account and password and I'll put up parental controls for you.
---
Idk but Raulf is def a Dwarf from the old country.
---
A bunch of servers on retail are empty already, and progressing into tbc would add content after nax. And It’s almost fact that bliz is recreating classic so they can shut down private servers and make more dubloons for their wallets
---
Wow is great game for side gigs. That's one of the reasons being a filthy causal is great haha.
---
Yeah by releasing TBC they would have to split the player community (again), doesn't sound like a good idea imo.
---
There are few alternatives for either faction at that level. Its long and narrow with a lot of shared quests and *a lot* of grinding.
---
Whats up with vanila and classic FOV? It is 100% different, I can feel it.
---
Yeah sorry, I misunderstood your comment. It seemed like you were referring to both experience and reputation. I don't know why you were so aggressive though. The comment you responded to covered all your points properly. They even said:
---
&gt;They fixed the experience after that point.
---
It's normal to be skeptical of any data private servers have as for all the things they have correct there's like 5 things they have wrong.
---
Lol I already dont sleep as it is. Might as well use that time wisely in azeroth ahhaha.
---
&gt;No rep tabards, shared achievements, great art and music, good instances, good raid mechanics, treasures &gt; archaeology, pet battles (some people love it, others dont have to give a shit), scenarios, brawler's guild, improvements to secondary professions, dailies that actually give you shit.
---
&gt;But most importantly, MoP was by far the best leveling and questing experience of any expansion to-date.
---
I completely forgot about scenarios, those were epic and the brawler's guild was pretty interesting too. A way to put some MMO back into the game. 
---
I do remember people were completely up in arms about pet battles as if it was the worst idea ever spawned from a human mind. I didn't enjoy it but it didn't make the game worse like LFD and LFR did. It's like the character viewer. I don't know if you remember but the ability to shift click items and view them on your character came in a patch during vanilla. And people went crazy over it, accusing Blizzard of wasting developer time on trivial things like the character viewer over fixing classes or adding more raids/dungeons. Could you imagine WoW without it?
---
Undead Paladins would be shadow paladins and have mechanically very similar abilities except they're shadow themed.
---
This is a Good Post, for once. Thanks for the tips.
---
I did the same about a month ago, was as amazing as I remember. Loved it!
---
I have 5 cats! I feel your pain. I could not handle 8 lmfao.
---
What I wouldn't give for a WC IV
---
I changed A, S, and D to abilities back in BC. I use Q and E to strafe with right-click. I always see people saying to change strafe to A and D and all my friends have done this, was just curious if there's a greater reason behind it.
---
The assumption would be that they would have TBC servers that are separate from Vanilla. I would also presume that they would let you copy your character data to TBC servers.
---
Yes! That's what I'm looking forward to. Just being casual and not having to log in every single day to do a certain "objective".
---
If you're trying to push ahead of the curve, your goal is to beat everyone to an area. I don't think that will make the server seem dead, just make you feel like you are moving faster than everyone.
---
You will still be able to spam LFG and find people for dungeons/group quests.
---
Also keep in mind that as you level you are likely going to be grouping with randoms the whole way up. With the assumption that people will be regularly joining groups, it's a pretty simple piece of logic to aggregate low populations to one layer.
---
Alright Captain Cranky, have at it lol.
---
I'm also debating between mage and hunter. I was dead set on hunter but the buggy pets on beta, shared diminishing returns on scatter shot and freezing trap, lack of Lupos shadow damage, and the leeway mechanic are serious nerfs from my time on private servers as a hunter.
---
I haven't mained a mage on vanilla before. What can I expect on a PvP server as Alliance? Will shamans own me? How will I do vs horde locks and priests?
---
Is tailoring really required for the robe of the archmage in a hardcore raiding guild? Is one item really that good when robe of winter night has the same spell damage?
---
How necessary is engineering for a mage on a hardcore raiding guild? What are the main benefits other than sapper charges? Seems like the aoe is already pretty strong.
---
Yep, imagine the feeling of watching this video a dozen years ago and realizing it was so much what I wanted to watch.
---
Then realizing there would be nothing like it again.
---
I thought this was a bug? Either way, you will be able to do all that. And there are videos online of mages solo pulling the elite crocodiles in ZG, I wouldn't worry too much about this.
---
This.
---
If you were a vanilla veteran, look back to that time and ask yourself if you then cared that Undeads would WotF your Fear as a Human Warlock, and that Gnomes would have 5%+ more Intellect (even if you didn't play back then, you can easily put youserlf in those shoes). 100% sure you didn't give a shit, and 100% sure you still had a blast playing back then.
---
Imagine that you go Undead Warlock based on that petty rationale, and try to imagine if being stuck with the Horde and a rotting corpse model will make up for not having to deal with a couple Undead dispelling your Fears once during your duels. Does it make up for sticking with the faction and race you truly like?
---
A lot of people are bringing the retail mentality with them to Classic, the same one that made every class feel so similar and the game a boring commodity fest. In retail, behind all the nonsense the devs spew about "class identity", your class choice barely matters because they strived so hard to please everyone the same. "Boohoo that guy's Fire Mage is doing 0.4% more DPS than my Destruction Warlock". "Let's all transfer factions because the Horde is doing 0.7% more overall DPS". You have every tool at your disposal, it's just a matter of diferent ability names and animations, but in the end it plays pretty much the same.
---
Classic is unfair, you want to play a hybrid class but you don't excel at any role, you want to play a Night Elf Rogue but Shadowmeld becomes nearly useless, you want to play Warlock on Alliance and the Undeads WotF your Fears. Guess what, killing that Undead will taste twice as sweet. Embrace the adversity, because it is what will keep players hooked to Classic compared to retail.
---
Lmfaoooo second person I seen on here sending the family on vacation. Wish I had that luxury lmfao!
---
There are tons of dead pandaren turtles all over azeroth though. Not actual npcs but similar at least.
---
What the hell, why was it removed?
---
Hahaha. I've been watching wow videos and last night she says "what? Are you gaming again or something?" 
---
Maybe in august! Hahah.
---
Suprisingly, undead female look pretty good, tho they have issues with arms and legs missing tissue, lol. And female shadow priest is such a sad consept - a priest who was abandoned by the Light. Awesome race/class combo.
---
Am I paranoid for thinking that blizzard are planning to layershard the shit out of classic so hard they’re not even confident of having enough people join their oversized RP-PVP layered clusterfuck?
---
Blizzard missed such an opportunity not releasing WC3: Remastered before WoW Classic.
---
Depends on your class, and also the phase.
---
Some classes just have access to instabced farming that far outstrios almost anything else you can do. Some classes have world AoE farming that usually doesn't have too much competition.
---
For classes that aren't the best solo farmers, and that can't sell runs then quests are amazing if you have them. They're obviously limited though and some quests are worth the time investment, others not so much. 
---
The short version is "it depends."
---
You're the first one I've seen who has actually said that people are rooting for a Classic &gt; TBC 'Evolve'. So no, I don't actually think that people want that.
---
Separate servers are good tho.
---
Yes if you have a geared 60 tank there's more freedom as they generate more rage, but while levelling tanking can be difficult.
---
But a level 60 priest most likely won't need tips, so it's only low levels using your advice.
---
Man, I did a 12 today and I do not enjoy that lmfao. I do pretty demanding manual labor though. Office work or something of the sort may not be AS terrible.
---
I'm going to deal with this by having so many Alts that I'll never reach endgame and therefor viability will not be an issue.
---
I use Q and E to strafe with W and right-click for movement. I was just curious if there's a greater reason behind changing strafe to A and D because I know a lot of people that have done this and always see it recommended.
---
that's what a re-bound A and D are for. Strafing
---
Retail is not a good example because it's bad period.
---
The one that gets me is the targeted strafing, its a fucking eyesore
---
Here's my 60 rogue from back in the day. Hasn't touched anything past classic.

Yeah, I only can or should I say am willing to play games while my kids are gone or asleep. So doesn't leave much time :/. I'm gonna be a casual though for sure.
---
I kicked hunters for doing this. Unless asked to pull it, you tank it.
---
Am I crazy? I thought only IF and Org had auctions houses?
---
Playing only 24 hours a day? Dude you're gonna get kicked even from the casual guilds.
---
Ok better than an RP loser. Go play D&amp;D.
---
&gt; a couple quests that mention Chen.
---
Chen's Empty Keg!
---
Because its just a link. Low effort
---
Evolve? No. But TBC stand alone servers? Hell yes. 
---
Think about it, even if the community “splits”...they will still have enough people to keep multiple servers of a given expansion up and healthy. If they can get a few hundred thousand people spread across their Classic suite of games, they win. That’s that many subs they potentially wouldn’t have otherwise, and the games are relatively low maintenance.
---
cant bring myself to care if everyone and their mom roll warrior
---
Also, IMO, one of if not the best time in  WoW to be a PvPer.
---
wrong orc color
---
Paladin's are just as desirable in the raid environment as a priest, correct? I do not mind a mind numbing experience when it comes to spells just as long as I can be an efficient healer.
---
I love D&amp;D, goblins are the best.
---
Same here. I work overtime every week, and spend nights and weekends(when im not working) with the family. I will be putting in some time on classic though, even if it's only an hour here and there Haha. 
---
I'm thinking about maining Horde first. Thinking Troll mage as a starter. Good solo ability, farm ability, and can make extra cash with portals ETC. You?
---
Got a long way to go before even considering this.  The question is after that initial wave of quitters, will the player population for classic ever start to increase again?  Lots of the design decisions are all based off of Blizz assuming it will just gradually decline.  If it actually grows the player base at some point, then we can think about what's next.
---
Amazing and well done guide my dude! But protip from doing Rogue farm myself...don't pickpocket-farm BRD. The mobs' resist rate is way too high, you'll have to vanish a lot, and either wait out it's CD or die. RFD and ZF were much more profitable farms (with RFD being 30-40g per hour depending on drops).
---
This incentivizes people wasting your time though lol
---
WoW is in its own category.
---
Same boat.. sucks!
---
It is kinda disappointing that if you play as a class that can heal, you WILL heal.  I love pally tanking.  I don’t just hate healing, but I don’t like being a paladin but wearing a robe.  I wish that pally had a taunt.  Just a taunt.  😇
---
To be fair, they had already farmed the hell out of the instance before they started doing that.  I guess they thought they had proved themselves.  Blizzard though otherwise.
---
Private servers had way more than 33k players playing and I'd assume a legitimate way to play Vanilla would be more popular than private servers.
---
I hereby suport this comment. This post made my mind break a little.
---
Engineering is must-have for PvE tanks.
---
When I played on pservers a few years ago the fee was 5g from Badlands to Orgrimmar... As a mage u could just sit there and people would spam you for portals during rain hours... https://imgur.com/EYcKxSU  I wonder if we will get crowds like that or if layering would kick in...
---
How would text make it higher effort? If the title intrigues you, just read the video description.
---
Just bind A and D to strafe and shift + A and D to turn
---
I preferred we skipped MoP instead. No please.
---
That is awesome!
---
Saved!
---
Holy shit thank you I've been looking for this!
---
Haha. Yeah dont do that! I always make it a point to finish any real life obligations I need to before gaming. Makes sure you have a good balance!
---
They don't know beforehand. And I can stop the timer whenever I want.
---
Thanks. I'll see what I can do.
---
Cool galery ! I think the first screenshot is from WotLK pre-patch though, when Necropolis appeared around all capital cities.
---
Yup. Still friends with Gigi on Facebook.
---
Man I'm glad to see I'm not the only one having these feelings about games lol. I guess some of us really are just growing up. 
---
Good thing WoW Classic is timeless hahahaha
---
As stated before, pretty much anything is viable. However the most efficient is to lvl as enh from 1-40 then 40-60 as ele since you get ele mastery then.
---
You need to kill. Early priest leveling is smite -&gt; sw:pain -&gt; wand to death. With wand mastery and spirit tap you can keep a pretty steady pace.
---
I prefer a tank that pulls when the healer is low on mana over a tank that waits til 100% to pull.
---
Bro that's insane lmfao!
---
I don't understand why people keep assuming Blizzard plans to cap realms at 3k. That was a technological limitation at the time, nothing more.
---
I really wouldn't say so. Maybe there are some outliers but you're usually just better off gathering/farming regents. Crafting can be a good money maker too, if you have all the patterns.
---
There's a vast difference between doing your daily heoric(before I quit, in WOTLK) and doing a dungeon in vanilla.
---
My daily? I'd chain pull, pull, aggro every mob, run to the next pack, aggro more, my brother was a hunter(why does that rhyme), he'd DPS everything down before I got to the next pack and repeat.
---
Literal 5min heroic dailies. Healer would bitch and complain but the gear difference made the dungeon a fucking joke, they'd barely hit me.
---
I'm looking forward to being a tank again.
---
I thought the Alliance war cry was "Not in the face!"
---
Let me rephrase then - someone who does a quick/good job and doesn't waste your time is being penalized, whereas someone naturally slower is making more for the same work
