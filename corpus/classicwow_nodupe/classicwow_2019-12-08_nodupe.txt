I’m not exactly sure what you’re talking about. If anything I’m underwhelmed. I play Horde and was looking for a server that was majority Alliance. It was just suggestions lol
---
---
---
Agreed.
---
Low quality, but I approve.
---
Mages do. Warlocks are a bit behind.
---
No, no data just anecdotal evidence from the type of threads that are generally whiney and the personalities of the alliance Reddit posters
---
Rogues, yes.
---

---
Warriors, no.
---
Assuming equal skill and optimal groups etc. Warrior is the best dps class in the game, from MC to Naxx.
---
The game is definitely not completely figured out. Look at each bis list from 4 different sources. Look at how to guides for ony threat. Look at how to guides for rag melee aoe mechanic.  Look at fury prot.
---
Let me remind you that Vanilla has undergone a very long testing session, starting with the "Friends &amp; Family" restricted Alpha, then the closed Alpha and all the beta phases.
---
This meant they tried all the possible pop caps and decided for 3k because the world felt full enough and the machines couldn't cope with more.
---
What you're saying is "what would have happened if, at that time, they went with 5k/6k?" (let's just assume that machine power wasn't an issue). The reply is the zerg-fest we probably have today and would have immediately reduced it to a more sensible number.
---
As a Herod refugee, me too
---
as a czech, we dont have the real life ones, so we hate the virtual ones instead
---
Because warriors are the most gear reliant and I've seen idiots 10 levels below 60 get into raids.
---
strange how you can only point out tich.
---
meanwhile the forums back then were on fire from alliance bitching about how long bg ques were. i wonder why?
---
and you sit there pretending you signed up for hardmode. the populations even today aren't as skewed as you clowns claim
---
[deleted]
---
Its dead. Gonna be the next flamelash
---
The vast majority of my guild played through wotlk. A lot of us would play it again.
---
I play horde on whitemane and the alliance there are very active.
---
The exits from Kargath are camped nearly 24/7 and ally’s will hold bottom of chain to BRD entrance quite often.
---
Roaming ally gank squads are everywhere just like horde. I farm solo and I get got every 10 minutes or so.
---
I’m fine with it, it is what it is. I was able to level to 60 by running dungeons, which you need to do anyways to get your BiS gear.
---
Seriously. The game was already there, they just had to make adjustments and get it in a better position for a re-release. People complain about companies re-releasing video games and movies as a cheap way of making money but when it comes to this game that logic goes right out the window.
---
&gt;&gt; No arena
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Basically the whole game for some, half the game for others
---
Presumably it is none of the game for people who are playing Classic, right? Given that it doesn't exist?
---
&gt; Easier to just play on a PvE server.
---
What do pvp versus pve servers have to do with arenas?
---
Ah yeah according to that “data” I’ve concluded most horde players are teens and or brain dead people but yea alliance is pretty whiny and weak but at least they aren’t apes
---
What trinket addon slot you use?
---
This would be silly. Literally all Blizzard needs to do is require the latest expansion in order to play Classic.
---
Undead rogue here. Can confirm that I specifically rolled this class to piss off plebs like the OP.
---
BTW your tears taste great, thank you.
---
You can always try a two hand fury build for battlegrounds and see how you like it.  Fury isn't superior to arms for PvP, but it does have some things going for it, and mobility is one of the big ones.  Improved Intercept combined with the four piece set bonus from warrior PvP gear means you can Intercept every 15 seconds, in addition to the occasional Charge when you're clear of combat. 
---
Death Wish provides 30 seconds of fear immunity.
---
Improved Berserker Rage isn't the strongest and it may be tough to squeeze in, but you can pop it for ten rage pretty frequently.  Ten rage is enough to Intercept if you get dragged into combat before you get a Charge off. 
---
You might be able to find a an in-between spec that's good enough for raiding and good enough for PvP.  WSG premades likely still need someone with mortal strike, but AV doesn't.
---
Ally’s deathball quite well on Whitemane, the death balls just don’t fight each other.
---
When do shamans get bloodlust?
---
Blizzard just needs to fix it obviously, its their product and their problem. If they don't people won't use their product. Simple.
---
[removed]
---
Because it all depends on many factors, which is why you need to actually learn the underlying reasons and mechanics behind the decisions for what is and isn’t best in slot, then make your decisions from there.
---
People who just read guide saying “this is best” will always be wondering why they aren’t doing as well as others.
---
It’s not all the time except when you’re trying to get to BRM unless you’re on a really, really bad server. Plus BGs are released on the 10th which will do a lot to help the current situation
---
How many rogues are typically in an AQ/Naxx Raid?
---
The pre raid bis stuff is only going for one stat - +healing. Completely misses out on everything else. It’s actually a pretty terrible collection of gear for anything besides sub 3 min raid fights haha. Make a lasher farming set - buy high int gear off the AH and get blue pieces like magiskull or ones that have int and stam as opposed to healing. Also it’s way easier if you just spec hybrid disc/holy and get the 10% more mana talent...MC is easy you don’t need to be full perfect holy spec for it.
---
Frostbolt was all I used to get to 60. I busted out Firebolt a couple of times but that was only on mobs that are immune to frost damage.
---
ty ♥
---
Afaik Pve servers are dominated by ally though, so this does seem expected to me
---
Yeah zerg the horde side even more when the server is ahorde heavy, have fun with the next reroll after 1-2months.
---
Incendius 10/10
---
Yeah I had a feeling this might be the case. I'll give it a whirl and see how it goes. Thanks guys.
---
There's a big difference between wpvp on a 50/50 server and wpvp on a 70/30 server. One is a fight, the other is slaughter.
---
karma whore
---
&gt;broken quests that just don't work because they're not scripted properly
---
Forsaken courier bugged out at Bloodfang. Waiting for server reset to get a quest done.  
---
&gt; un-blizzlike class mechanics  
---
have you seen druid bug list? LOL.
---
Was it cloudkeepers?
---
Get a Slavering Worg from SFK. It's the fastest wolf in the game, with an attack speed of 1.2.
---
I know, broken tooth is faster, but also way harder to get and way higher level.
---
The concept of raid DPS dictates that neither class should be in greens.
---
You also said you’re having a bad time . Which one is it ?
---
Lol I've singled handedly drove the price of arcane crystals down from 45g to 25g, thorium from 20s per to 10s per item, in a week of farming DM East without a bot. These bits definitely are screwing the economy.
---
you’re triggered
---
Just went this spec a few days ago.  So far not bad for healing ok for dps ok for pvp but I need more gear.  Can't wait to get a few more pieces
---
I have actually set-up shop there to sell fish and surprisingly it goes pretty well. But I'm on an RP server.
---
Short version: Hilmeth shit the game up trying to get himself a bigger bonus check, Long version below.  
---
So I started playing again June 2018 and the game was more or less functional, Then Hilmeth sold the company and a 1 year window started where the games performance within that year determined the bonus the sellers would be paid as a part of the sale. The player base threw a fit over selling the company to a Korean owner infamous for pay to win mechanics in its game Black Desert Online, but CCP staff Promised Eve would not be like that because they were in control. That lasted maybe 3-4 months and in the spring event introduced pay to open loot boxes were introduced, following that the alliance tournament was canceled on the grounds it costs money to run... Through this all player numbers continued the slow decline they have been on since 2016. It was then that hilmeth came to a brilliant conclusion, after taking zero interest in how the game works or is was designed to be played and after a few months pf noobing it up in a WH he decided that HE and HE alone was the one who could save Eve by taking control of what changes would be made, how they would be announced and how they would work.   
---
His opening move was to explain he wanted Eve to enter a "Chaos Era" where the game's mechanics would change quickly and with NO WARNING to players...  His first move was to remove local from the game in nullsec entirely, making it ridiculously easy for anyone to blindside someone trying PVE with next to no chance of them trying to avoid being ganked. This change was incompetently pulled off which resulted in local being completely broken for around a week and continuing to randomly break several times for several days at a time throughout the duration of this "Chaos Event" he called "blackout" *(It was later theorized by players that the only reason this event happened was that the chat servers were broken to begin with and CCP having no idea how to fix them in the first place simply wanted to remove them from the game to avoid the continuing embarrassment of their new cloud based chat servers continuing to fail randomly after having previously declared it fized several times)*
---
Players countered this idiotic change by having standing cap fleets ready to jump to PVErs who made sure to fit a cyno and literally every fucking thing they undocked. So Hilmeth's next amazing decision was to counter the prevalence  so called "super umbrellas" being used to defend PVE players by restricting regular Cyno's to combat recons and covert cynos to covert ships. Essentially forcing you to use very expensive, very squishy ships to bring in any caps you wanted to deploy.   
---
Through this all the player base is tanking spectacularly, losing in some months as many as 1,500-3,000 players  from the concurrent player count, and as the player count is tanking Hilmeth went on every podcast he can find willing to interview him to say that this is the kind of game eve should be, and that he wants the players to feel so nervous and paranoid while playing that they feel they need medication to cope with how unexpected the changes to the base game mechanics are....  
---
A few short months later with the player count down over 10,000 at peak week end times the removal of local is reversed but the cyno change stays.  
---
The game population slowly started to recover, but as of now they are lucky to hit 32,000 on peak time sunday, at the beginning of the year they were hitting as much as 36-37,000 at peak times on sunday.
---
South of revantusk village, in the water, is usually full of bots lvl 30-40 looting the cages and killing the mobs. U think the cages also drop a fishing pole that is good for alliance
---
ok
---
Re: your last bit, that’s just not true. The current pvp gear outclasses pve gear in some situations, and the weapons are already more or less the best in the game. 
---
I didn’t even play TBC fwiw, so I can’t comment on the specifics of itemization. I’m just not a fan of exclusionary stats. Why would you want your big bad ultra super legendary weapon of doom that you got from defeating a world-ending terror to be subpar in a brawl with another player because it doesn’t have any “pvp power”. 
---
I don’t care if there are two separate paths for progression, where you can get OP gear from pvping or you could get OP gear from pveing. We actually have that exact system right now in Classic, believe it or not. I just don’t want that gear to have different stat mechanics.
---
You'd have to wait for them to respawn (which can take a while in some of these areas), and hit DR after 4 kills. That sounds like an awful honor farm and doesn't really solve the bot problem as it just delays them slightly.
---
Plenty of people have been misled in this sub that normal servers are not the “real” game. That somehow they are an inferior player for wanting to play that server type. Now the people who were on the fence and listened to that horse crap advice are rerolling from PVP to Normal realms. Or trying to transfer away to a server where alliance isn’t being corpse camped 24/7. 
---
If the shoe was on the other foot the horde would be crying non stop about those same things. In fact if you look at this sub the horde are crying and whining too just about different things.
---
Well all I'm saying is that warrior scale better with gear than mages.
---
pretty sure she only breaths if someone is in the radius, only time i see it drop is when someone gets hit, when everyones in safezone, she just sits there
---
and you’re on here too getting into epic arguments while the talented horde play the game huh
---
&gt;I saw on a video someone had a paladin addon that showed the class icons of everyone in your party with a blessing icon next to it 
---
Probably Pallypower.
---
30 minutes is plenty of time for progress. You'll get a lot of shit done!
---
.... Wow u got us, we are literally all teens reliving a game we played when we were 3 years old
---
very bright comeback, you seem very intelligent
---
Stoneform unironically owns tho, two healer classes that can't be blinded, priests immune to viper sting, rogues that can now vanish serpent sting, counters devouring plague, allows bandaging vs warriors,  etc
---
I’ve done a LOT of leveling in retail with war mode (levels 20-100 around 5-6 toons), and the ganking is very, very minimal. I rarely feel the need to turn war mode off. And griefing has yet to happen to me (opposite faction corpse camping me).
---
I’ve been leveling alliance toons so it’s horde who has been very friendly. 
---
For the first 1-2 months of allied races, it was a little worse, especially in STV and Duskwood. In fact, there were times when I simply couldn’t enable war mode in those zones at all due to the griefing, but that is in the past in my experience.
---
It’s an add on called pally power.
---
6 plus or minus a few is common. You can bring a lot more of course, it just means the healers burn through mana more quickly.
---
Something like this: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/02305021302-55000105015012251
---
Points were shaved from DW spec and improved execute, and moved to improved Intercept, improved berserker rage, and improved overpower.   You could likely get away with raiding as DW with a minor hit to damage, and PvP with a two hander for burst damage.
---
Technically they can just make alliance alts (on second accounts) and send the materials over the Neutral AH and turn them in. If the entire server is Horde and there are no Alliance then they'll have to do this.
---
I'm taking a shit homie
---
Just reroll. I did it, and thousands of others have too. I can choose when I PVP now. People on normal/ RP still want to rank, plus BGs are right there. And if your not feeling it, your other toon will still be there. 
---
I was in your same boat, hated P2 and now am having as much fun as I was in p1
---
It was crazy luck. They dropped in week 1, 2, 3 and 7.
---
Scuba Cops just can't accept reality, but even worse, they can't admit the facts. FACT: They failed at being the best guild on Anathema, but they justified their failure by claiming to be "best NA guild." FACT: Scuba failed at being #1 NA guild on Lightbringer, and justified it by having poor recruitment FACT: Scuba failed yet again on Northdale, and blamed their failure on "not practicing on PTR," despite their OWN GUILDLEADER CREATING A PRIVATE NAXX REALM to practice on. Scuba Cops just need to accept that they're not the best. There's nothing wrong with being a B+ Player, but there is a huge problem with a B+ Player pretending to be an A+ Player.
---
Eve was NEVER without non-consensual PVP that was a myth perpetuated by the Wormhole crowd who wanted to be able to drop 100 Tier 3 cruisers on a cap, smoke it, and moon walk out before back up could arrive. What those changes did was turn anyone undocked in a PVE ship into a killmail waiting to happen with ZERO counter play available to the PVE pilot, and the player base numbers nose dived accordingly.
---
Okay, sorry to tarnish your sacred space
---
Are you living in the same universe as the rest of us?
---
No as in start a group and stay inside the dungeon only coming out to reset it.
---
Rolling pve does give you the option down the road. Rolling pvp locks you in to pvp in contested zones
---
GMs don't interfere with loot disputes, they've said it millions of times.
---
At least it's a cool armor set
---
Hey they're awesome for PVP but I wouldn't be caught dead wearing those in PVE. I'd honestly wear a pair of [Master's Leggings of Healing](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10252/masters-leggings) over [Salamander Scale Pants](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18875/salamander-scale-pants) and T2. IMO just stack up on as much bonus healing as humanly possible because you're already crazy mana efficient with rank 3 and rank 4 healing touch in PVE, you just need to worry about increasing output.
---
And I don't think your boomkin should wear those pants either.
---
What is the problem in firemaw? Ive seen posts that alliance is doing pretty well there even if its the lesser pop faction, its not as one sided as most servers
---
Pre raid blues are not the lowest level of gear lol
---
You're in the wrong, up until he told you baby rage and blocked you.
---
So you have the numbers advantage on the server and are the ones getting camped? Your guilds need to do a better job then. Not the Alliance’s fault in this case.
---
0/21/30 by far imo. Not reliant on pet and you will destroy melee classes. I'd recommend improved raptor strike (i think it's called vicious strikes or some shit) that gives you +30% raptor strike crits and use a slow 2h with high damage. Im using a green "massacre sword of the monkey" because i havent gotten barbarous blade yet, and raptor strike crits for 550-700 damage like 43% of the time. Add to that improved wingclip and concussive shot along with increased trap duration and deterrance/counterattack and you'll eat rogues and *most* warriors for breakfast 1v1. Also, don't forget to grab the 10% base health talent in survival and skip the +damage% for humanoids/beasts etc. because they are pointless for PvP. In general you want to max out all talents in the survival and MM trees (MM only up to scatter shot) that would be useful for PvP like immobilize procs, increased stam, increased range, ranged crit chance/damage, and parry chance etc, and skip the ones that only really shine in long raid/dungeon fights where 3% extra damage or less mana cost actually make a difference. Make sure to grab surefooted to easily reach the 5% PvP hit cap that also gives you 15% extra chance to resist stuns and immobilizing effects (basically a poor man's Hardiness) too, which gives more room for crit gear, unless you have full Giantstalker or something. This spec shines with better gear because of lightning reflexes, but my gear is relatively shit (zero raid pieces) and I still have 4184 hp and 12% crit (17% ranged) unbuffed. Sorry for the super long unorganized reply, just wrote what came into my head and probably still forgot a bunch of stuff.
---
Thank you for understanding
---
He asked why you think they're nerfed?
---
No, blame blizzard and their shitty logic.
---
If you really want that sense of danger on a PvE server you can flag yourself for PvP by right-clicking your portrait.
---
But yeah if you want to be Alliance go PvE
---
Pre raid blues is the lowest level of gear you're going to show up to any relevant raids in
---
lol
---
[Classic Warrior World PvP Clips With Live Commentary! 10 vs 60](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xF5cBhMzss).
---
Alliance BTW.
---
On the other side of the ball I die 6-14 times on primehours trying to get to DM E or BRM. At some point I feel like macro pvp stopped being additional content and became the *only* content in this current phase. PvE servers has at least the opportunity to choose if they want to do something else.
---
What are the UI elements you are using?
---
Other servers are on a direct path to Flamelash.
---
I mean I only bothered playing Retail because I knew Classic was coming. Just to fill in some time. If Classic fails or is discontinued after Phase 6 and we don't get BC/Wrath I wouldn't ever go back to Retail.
---
This, so much! It's the memories we make on the way.
---
That looks fair, my first 60 is alliance sulfaras and checks out. What’s up with that server with all horde lol?

I think most servers will be relatively fine. There of course will be some servers that open that shit very fast. But low pop servers that had like sub 300 level 60’s  on each faction  were able to open the gates in vanilla. I’m sure these mega pop servers will be fine. Flamelash probably totally fucked though and will need to wait blizzard intervention.
---
That's blastwave, not sapper charges.
---
Start leveling an alt on a PvE server now whilst waiting for BGs to be released. Even after the 10th, when you get frustrated from ganks and PvP on your PvP character, you can just log on to your PvE alt and chill.
---
You might find you naturally start playing one character more than the other, then you will have your answer.
---
Now, my issue is having to decide a class and race again for my alts, I had enough trouble the first time.... :)
---
To bad we have no time table on P3.
---
i am honored with gnomes as well also other dwarfs are not giving discount
---
Ah ok. Is that a common thing to do? Like will there be people outside in general chat trying to find groups for it?
---
can't get crystal vials from the 2 venders i mentioned
---
If you have better sources, I would love to see them.

all these alliance posts are gunna make me OD on sodium
---
Me too!! Hahaha I’m that lock in the top left
---
Yes yes I'm having fun, try to get a couple hours in a day.
---
Haha. I was set on female human holy paladin. When the name reserve came I ended up being a nelf druid tank 😂
---
What warrior dps is ever using their CD for shield wall wtf....
---
Also rogues are worse versions of warriors with a threat reduction.
---
I entirely agree with this statement.
---
And besides just knowing that it wouldn't have gone well, just look at Blizzards attempt in the moba genre. It speaks for itself.
---
It's a combination of the 3.  A bucket of bleach isn't a problem, adding ammonia to it, though, creates chlorine gas.
---
And I guess theres a 4th part to it; letting one side have disproportionate power all around the world.
---
That's simply not true. One of the server first clears of MCwas done with people in greens
---
Shoes just make your footsteps louder. Ultimate stealth character!
---
wep skill is not the same as hit.  It primarily increases the damage of *glancing blows* which would otherwise significantly reduce your auto attack damage.  Wep skill also *very slightly* reduces the chance of your attacks being blocked/dodged/parried/missed.
---
As for various gear setups, you can always empirically test your own results with a damage meter.
---
but seriously I wouldn't worry about it.  Your goal is going to be to replace all of it with raid gear, and MC is clearable in greens ...
---
So we're going to base them on cherry picked comments on a discord.
---
Nope, You are mistaking the alliance for yourself.
---
Ninja looters are a problem for everyone, not just your guild. You are basically enabling toxic behaviour, and making it qorse.fpr everyone.
---
Further more, this dude can't be trusted. He most likely will dip from the guild later on as soo  as he gets loot. 
---
Kick + name and shame in trade.
---
They'll either corpse walk or hang out inside BRD until a group forms and walk out the instance and walk in together.
---
I'm basing off [this](http://i.imgur.com/Yqos2sE.png). The majority of WotLK is more or less horizontal.
---
by the time I left the two of them were up to like 40 accounts a piece and those were just the scouts.
---
That's not how the burden of proof works. Let go of your confirmation bias for just one second.
---
Not much of a good server if they're contemplating leaving en masse to keep going either way

Let it be known that OP delivered and is a genuinely cool person.
---
&gt; since Getting into raids and schedules is a little hard for me. Any decent servers that are nice place to start for Alliance
---
In classic, it has been ridiculously easy to full clear with pugs.  I cant raid consistently and have still been gearing up with no problems.

You should either edit out the comms, or make them go over the music. Its kinda weird when i can barely hear people with the music.  But otherwise a great video!

Top brackets on my server were 320k for alliance and 255k for horde last week. 1 Day of BGs aint going to skew that.
---
Good news, all of the caster T0 gear is equally all absolute trash! 
---
No mage should wear any T0 if they have spell damage blues or frost wrath greens.  And yes, this is still true even if the spell damage or frost wrath gear is even level 40, because T0 really is that bad!
---
explain it further

I only have a few pieces of FR gear and rarely put them on as an off tank feral druid for my guild. It doesn't hurt to have them and if you ever become the main tank it will help more.
---
Cloudrunner took me probably 15-20 lbrs runs. There's also the slaghide gloves of the monkey and evasion necklace which I'm about 25 lbrs dry on still. Lbrs is a good place to run as a feral tank for these items. Also make sure to have a seal of ascension on you if you want to work towards an UBRS key
---
Collectively spoken : fuck off .
---
Sure go destroy ten horde per fight yourself and be overlord godally yourself.
---
Just like the honour farming culture on pvp server, a ton of diversity.
---
maybe like 10-15 hours if you are steamrolling with a premade.  way longer if you get stuck in turtle games.
---
Git gud.
---
You stated
---
&gt;WoW's PvP was far, far bigger in WotLK, Cata and MoP than it ever was before
---
There is clearly a burden of proof for you to support your claim. 
---
And burden of proof does not mean "I get to poke holes in your sources while refusing to provide any of my own".
---
First of all. Go fuck yourself, kid. I'm no rat. I'm an adult with a job and a family. I work 5-6 days a week 10.5hr days. I get maybe an hour or two at the end of the night to relax, and play the game with my friends and family. But people playing the Horde ruined it, not just for me, but for thousands of other grown people that don't have 6+ hours a day to play, we have lives. And it's not blizzard's fault it's like this, no one is forcing people to get raid groups to camp the flight path in redridge and grief people for hours. No one is forcing horde to camp the shops in IF and abuse the guard mechanic. These are all the actions of angsty little children who want to act like assholes and sociopaths and think there's no reaction or consequences to what they do and how they act. Which brings me to the question.
---
 If blizzard hasn't done anything, then please explain to me how come every day when login and sit in the queue you don't notice the box that says you get a free transfer. Do you and the thousands of other horde players not have the ability or the attention span to read it. Or is it that you just don't want to transfer? Pretty sure that's the actual reason, and a pretty clear window into the intent of the players. Nah, you horde people won't take the transfer, because you don't want shit to be fair, and that's the truth. So you kids can have it, I quit 2 weeks ago, i got better shit to do. I hope all the alliance players quit the game, and leave you guys to sit there staring at each other in whatever spot you picked to grief.
---
Selfaware wolves, how about maybe, JUST Maybe Horde attracts a certain type of toxic people, and the reason you dont see as much is because Alliance isn't as toxic.
---
every time i see a new "wow on unreal" footage I look and think "yeah looks cool for a picture" but would make the game way worse for me
---
Get a wand as early as you can and use it. It will be a large portion of your dps while levelling
---
I think 2% was about clearing naxx, not raiding it.
---
Why dont you use paid character transfer? Sure its paid but if you value your 3 months spent on leveling and want to keep playing just do it (instead of hoping on the crying train).
---
More of the fact that Earthshaker was close to 50/50 and will now be extremely lopsided with the entirety of alliance moving over that made up 30% of the population of Flamelash. You not only ruined one server, but possibly two.
---
The flair should be a crying baby with snot running down his nose.  Filter that shit right out.
---
Mages can be top because of ignite, but there will only be 1 or 2 mages above the warriors most likely and it will be random who it is because it's just rng who gets the first crit on the boss.
---
Warlocks, no. Warlocks get way better dps later on in aq and naxx but warriors get even better and faster.
---
you have to melee for yours to stay on
---
I'm basing it off the deliberate and inhumane griefing. Whatever happened to Mak'Gorah? The horde have none.
---

Working as intended then.
---
Having you being stubborn about "MAH PLAYSTYLE" makes any and I mean any good warrior/warlock dps have to manage their threat and that ruined their experience. You think your experience is more important that 10dps?
---
Are you ready for some idiot to walk into vaels room before everyone is ready?
---
Well that is a perfect scenario for a lock in the 29 bracket lol. Dot a warrior at absolute max distance and not be caught first. In that case you just run away and lure them in around a corner or ignore their weak dots and go for someone else... or keep running towards them because they’ll run out of room to run lmao. It’s naive to think a lock will be able to keep a warrior off them for 100% of the encounter. It just doesn’t work like that... and that gap being closed is all the time you need really.
---
Like I said, these things are easy be confident about on paper but it’s a different beast in game where things don’t go as planned, especially with engineering/alchemy pots. That’s the fun part about being in the  “trash” bracket for warrior. Being the underdog and doin work when people don’t expect it.
---
Ok that still doesn't change the fact that warriors scale with gear better than mages so I'm really not sure what you're trying to argue here.
---
Yup, this is pretty much my thoughts.  Horde queues will probably be 30m or so, plenty of time to camp out between queues.  I'm also suspecting that if they get the upper hand inside a BG, they will GY camp to farm HKs.
---
Totally irrelevant. There’s no line. The people who were actually stupid enough to grind honor via world PvP need to get used to the reality of this honor system. If they can’t continue grinding for one evening in order for all their work to not be invalidated then they should just stop grinding honor now because they will never survive ranks 11-14.
---
Pets in this game will follow targets through stealth with their npc ai, as long as you can manage to hit attack order before they vanish.
---
The only difference between outright kicking him and setting his DKP so low he won't ever be getting loot again is that if you don't kick he will now be a source of toxicity within the guild.
---
No, but blizzard could add faction-specific queues to make sure no server ever has too much of one faction
---
Flamelash EU became the First PvE PvP realm
---
I thought it might be interesting to gather some data to see how phase 2 has had an effect on people's enjoyment of the game
---
Because a website like wowclassicbis.com is made by *one person* and also because Classic WoW is...Weird.
---
Like, did you know that Slam, the ability that stops your autoattack swing, can actually be made to not do so with the macro
---
/stopattack
---
/Cast slam
---
/startattack
---
for *no* logical reason? Yeah, most people didn't either, it's a fairly new discovery.
---
Old games have *tons* of weird stuff in them. Just look at Melee and Dota.
---
Hell, it took people years to discover that Feral Druid was absolutely viable in 1.12 as a tank. Most thought TBC "saved feral" or sth, when it actually didn't add *that* much; most of it came in I believe 1.10 to 1.12.
---
Also people just love spreading their own opinion as gospel. I wouldn't release a guide for a class I have no idea about yet prior to release big Youtubers made half assed Class guides with wrong info or Private server bugs (sitting=guaranteed enrage comes to mind) because...They made views, I guess?
---
exactly, if he sticks around it will be to just do it again with a better loot table to steal from.

weird how this is not a prob for anyone on my server
---
DBM plays it
---
the more people I see complaining about classic wow the more I think of the quote "You think you do, but you don't"
---
I have a 60 druid and only need a few pieces of prebis healing gear left. What's the best way to tank the dungeons (I'm HotW/NS) and still get the healing gear I need? It has been pretty tough to find tanks lately when I play late at night.
---
Should I just tank and put the specific pieces on reserve? Not many people put items on res on my server which is PvE. You do this by turning on ML right before the boss right? 
---
The only other option is discuss before hand I'll be rolling on healing gear as tank and roll against the healer, but at this point I'd rather just tank and reserve the item and find a healer that doesn't need it. Thoughts from other hybrids in a similar situation?
---
So if my playstyle as dps is just blasting and I top the threat there is no problem right? Because its my playstyle
---
Thanks, I'll give it a try. I hesitated putting [nomod] in cause I thought it could be cumbersome. I've used [] instead of [notarget] which has allowed to me target myself when I don't have a target.
---
&gt; WITHOUT sacrificing a single bit of survivability. 
---
How much survivability do you actually think you're gaining? You doing worse threat and forcing the dps to wait makes fights take longer. Longer fights = more healer mana. More mana spent negates the increased survival. There's plenty of ways to gain more damage with a minimal survival loss. I'm a fury warrior, but I have a full set of plate gear with str/stam/+def and I frequently tank very smooth and fast dungeons runs because threat is a non-issue and I still have like 80% of your survival while doing 4-5 times more damage.
---
Limit the camping/wpvp to certain times/zones
---
Assumed you weren't capable of much, but that was actually surprisingly bad. GL next time!
---
I dunno, we want a boomy for crit buff
---
Also. I've seen you say this a lot so it should be cleared up. The only time there was free transfers for both sides, was at launch. Now there's no free transfer of of any pvp server unless you're horde. You cant even pay for a server transfer, I was on Fairbanks, I know I tried. And I would have paid the money cuz i got it. So No, the rats aren't scurrying away after p2 with transfers, they're just flat out quiting like I did.
---
Although yes everything is known about the game and all the rest of it, a lot of players, including myself came back to the game to relive some good old times and enjoy the game for what it was. There is a section of the playerbase who rightly or wrongly are coming at Classic wow with a completely different mentality, which is that of a min-max, everything must be optimal etc etc. Within that group is a sub group of people who will do anything they can to get max honor in a week, no matter how that damages other players experiences. Then some people just arse hats that enjoy griefing.
---
We are now in quite the situation where Alliance players want to just get out of PvP servers due to the griefing and the camping or transfering to PvP servers with high alliance populations.
---
This was a problem Blizzard should have seen coming and should definitly not had these huge max populations. Along with some world design back in the day which allowed FPs to be campled 24/7 and this poor mentality from some players, has put quite a downer on the whole experience.
---
We can't have nice things.
---
I've been alliance most my wow life. Currently raid with a horde guild tho. I miss my gnomie
---
The master of disaster PvP godmode bigballs everyone. Master of the tiny penis lord of the shit irl, beastmode of garbage attitude.
---
I can't even begin to touch upon how awesome this guy is he is clearly better than all of us. We must pray to the god to be as great as him despite him spamming Reddit with how bad his side are
---
He easily sweeps 5 rogues solo. He is a god, pleasured several men or women simultaneously a queen of Beastmode. All hail.
---
Any decent mage who isn’t arcane frost should never die to ony. Ice blocks drops aggrieved completely and you have two, I like to pop IB when she lands in P3 and it’s gg
---
I’m fucking crying
---
I’m alliance on that server.....
---
R.I.P. my friend 🤣🤣🤣
---
bet it's 50/50, since most alliance cba about pvp and just sit afk in   IF all day doing god knows what, at least get 15hk's a week:( all i ask for.
---
each pally has  to refresh their own judgement
---
Mages don't get any eagle's eye type spells. Shamans get one, but they and hunters are the only classes that do.
---
You can buy the ornate spyglass on the AH or get an engineer to make it for you, it's not bop and doesn't require engineering.
---
I signed up to this server with my vanilla experiences in mind. This wasn't gonna be like TBC where there's only blood elves and other horde around I thought. 
---
Maybe you felt informed, but can you truly speak for everyone on this subject? The average more casual player reminisce to vanilla and actually remembers how it was back then, but pserver culture has rotten through and now people farm easy targets for honour while waiting for bgs to come out. This period of time has been a shitshow for whoever isn't done with open world content in instances, gathering, farming, etc.
---
Yah basically.
---
I can tell you've never actually never used perception B4, cause you're idea of the ability is totally skewed. 
---
Wow really!? All the tryhards play gnome warrior!? All 10 of them??
---
Oh I forgot paladin was a racial ability, silly me.
---
This is what happens horde die once on their way to a dungeon for the first time in a week and have to complain about it, meanwhile going to BRM as alliance is 10 deaths
---
They’re the best mage class for pvp/pve. try hard will play gnome and try hards, need the honor to show everyone they’re tryhards.
---
Yeah I get constantly wrecked on here as horde. Incredibly unlucky timing I dinged 48 just as honor rolled out. Been slow going ever since.
---
Yeah if I still played that’s what I would do.I don’t get why people would want to be on pvp if they can’t level or whatever it is
---
Have you tried gittin gud
---
... Oh, I dunno, just your entire point that warriors need to be "well geared" to beat mages.
---
They don't, lol.
---
Update for anyone who cares, I farmer for another few hours this weekend with a friend and we got 4. They commonly drop no loot it would seem so if anyone does farm them at a low level  be persistent and don't just kill the elemental. Theres plenty of other mobs to kill to at least gain some money. Thanks for all the advice fella!
---
Blind is not a pot.......
---
Fuck me I hope you don't inflict yourself on a raid.
---
Kick. No question about it.
---
They obviously do not care about the guild or their guildmates. Fuck em.
---
&gt;Oh I forgot paladin was a racial ability, silly me.
---
No one is claiming it is my man.
---
What the fuck is VC lmao
---
As a first time WoW player when Classic released. UC is still confusing AF at first.
---
Warrior tanks should have 9% hit anyway, edgemasters aren't important at all for tanks.
---
My guild has been fairly similar. We've had one deep breath on the last like 5+ kills. Of course, I was the only one to die from it. She was about to go into p3 when it happened, so I started moving into my p3 position a little early and was nowhere near a safe spot :(
---
No, never go in against a sicillian when death is on the line!
---
Pff if it gives no honor who cares
---
How times have changed, no such thing as a gentleman’s duel anymore
---
Allies are the same scum trust me. I’m ally on an ally server(after I leaved a horde dominated server). Since I’m on an ally server I see allies corpse camping horde everywhere, some raid full of scumbags raiding og around the clock and there is no peace on like any tp. 
---
Rly you all suck hard being so selfish it hurts for some honor that didn’t count a bit, cause you only rank high enough in pvp if you no life ... like you all forgot there are other ppl behind the corpse you camp that just picked another faction. A few months ago we all were one big community that wanted back this beautiful game but seems like our community are just some selfish assoles, when they can.
---
Ninia looting is against TOS. They cant give you the item but they can punish a player for breaking TOS.
---
Clearly absolute bullshit , no one has this reaction out of nowhere and your random post to me shows you have a shitty shitty attitude.
---
Your guild is dead and it's your fault as leader.
---
It won't affect people like me whatsoever because i was smart enough to roll on a normal server, you've got your option, the game will be fine.
---
I wonder if the decisions after the Activision-Blizzard merger mid-Wrath had anything to do with that.
---
People who defend this faction imbalance are playing horde on PvP servers. Horde players has always had a history of always wanting to have the edge in everything from racials to numbers and they will do what they can to defend it until servers completely die.
---
Here you go my man:
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YXJpasqqodeq9B4jeUZDP9khFQf5QocyMby6moydJWk/htmlview
---
i had to explain this to my guild last week when half of the died to deep breath and then went "wtf was that" thanks to people pulling her out of phase 2 faster most of them had never seen it, a group of 5 of us out of the 20ish knew what it was and managed to get to safe spots and about 3-4 of the other 15-18 saw us run and followed, lots of questions on the run back of "what causes it and how do you stop it" only answer get he down faster to lower the chance and know where to stand if that doesn't happen
---
Theres 2 rets in my guild and it's kinda fucked but they dont get any loot. They are doing less damage than the tanks though. It's a shitty situation, if you are serious about trying to progress past MC it's going to be  hard to find a guild that will give rets any good loot. I've seen some decked out rets so not impossible,  just way harder than other classes.
---
So where should I go for warrior bis then?
---
i mean same story for horde in hillsbrad
---
Got spawn killed twice tonight by a 5 man alliance roaming squad as a level 56, can confirm the honor lies with the Alliance and that this sentiment is not in any way shape or form a biased sentiment at all.
---
No, you did nothing wrong, assuming you stopped dps as she landed. When she lands the tank has a finite amount of time to pick her up before the breaths the raid. Eating one warlock doesn’t really matter, breathing the whole raid does. If your really keen, stand on the other side of the cave.
---
Around 3-4.
---
What was the item? :o

---
I’ve got a 60 horde Druid on a PvP server and currently leveling an alliance warrior on a PvE server.  First time playing on a PvE server in my 15 years playing this game as I always thought I’d be missing a part of the game in the mind of my head some where if I didn’t go PvP.  Turns out I was wrong.  
---
I don’t dislike the PvP server and will definitely be playing both, just don’t miss ‘world PvP’ whatsoever on the PvE server and will likely only roll new chars on PvE servers going forward. 
---
If I want to engage in PvP I’ll just do it in Battlegrounds and then Arena for sure come TBC time.
---
What came first though, it seems like a circle. If gnomes are prone to getting ganked at low levels, it seems natural they would be more prone to gank once their higher level to reciprocate what happened to them previously, like revenge from getting ganked while leveling.
---
So was it horde that first started ganking gnomes that started this cycle?
---
Or was it high level gnomes being prone to ganking horde first?
---
I would guess it was the gnomes that started the war.
---
I would base this off the assumption, a player picks a gnome as a means to defeat larger enemies as a comically small character, which seems provoking.
---
No one likes losing to a small runt fuck gnome, so players pick it as a means to remind people of that fact.
---
Imo, the gnomes are just askin for it
---
Basically the reason Sargeras went on his crusade is because he was so afraid of the Void Lords and the powers they possess. He thought destroying the universe was a better option than letting the Void Lords corrupt it. They are the creators of the Old Gods we have faced on Azeroth.
---
If we don't stop the Void Lords, they will probably eventually corrupt the whole universe.
---
F
---
Lolol no. Blizzard has zero support for classic. Bots running around for weeks and you think reporting someone for /y messages does anything. Oh man, that’s a good one. It’s the wild Wild West in classic. I’ve had my main fishing with a bot for weeks every night and nobody cares.
---
I couldnt bring myself to delete my thrash blade.... there are many like it but this one is mine!
---
I legitimately dont believe that people are failing to clear rag in a guild run.
---
 Im just dropping by from /r/all but you're being incredibly cringy. Chill out.
---
The TBC arena meta would be fine, there is no clearly best comp.  WLD is probably the best overall comp but can be smashed by some of the cleave comps.  RMP is right behind WLD but with a much higher skill floor so there are tons of really bad RMPs that can't get anywhere, the best played RMPs in the world are 99% as good as the best WLDs.  Double healer warrior comps can do ok but are highly gear reliant and will never beat the good WLDs.  
---
But just about anything can push to gladiator when piloted by skilled players.  The arena meta was solidified back in TBC by Season 3 anyways, it will be no different than then.
---
I get full rage on 1 mob, then pull two, pop SS, spam cleave and they both usually die before SS ends.
---
It's actually laughable how imbalanced the servers are. https://ironforge.pro/servers?region=us&amp;filter=true

Exactly some dude though, I bet it would piss someone off if they got killed by a little gnome

---
Nice
---
Where so you kill bots for horde side? boting is thing i hate killed some but wanna hunt for .more
---
alliance spends all day whining on reddit instead of getting better
---
Class balance *is* important, it's nice to be actually useful as a prot paladin or elemental shaman, but if it was the only thing TBC did better you might have a point. Heroics, cool new spells (hello felguard!), getting rid of vanilla's garbage pvp system, sweet raids like Karazhan, awesome new zones, TBC was great. Now if they could implement it without shit like draenei and flying mounts that'd be ace.
---
Assuming it’s not dumb shit like standing in fire, witch is kinda hard to die a lot too; If your melee is dying every week it’s because your tank isn’t doing his job.
---
It’s not 2004, tanks need to generate good threat, that means a good rotation, hit cap’d and 305+ wep skill.
---
If your melee die from pulling agro your tank needs to step it up, your dps are doing their job well and the tank is letting them down.
---
&gt;B..both sides are the same!
---
You.
---
Yo OP i don’t know if i’m gonna take you up on this offer but I just wanted to say thank you for doing this. This is how you affect real change as an individual. And that applies to more than just WoW. Rock on.
---
My bad, there are exactly 100 that cleared KT before 2.0.1. Happy now?
---
Warrior DPS scales in a stupid way because not only do they do more damage as weapons/gar improves, but they resource goes up as they do more damage meaning they do more damage.
---
Mages CAN beat warriors because once they turn fire Ignite becomes a thing.  What happens is every time a fire mage crits with a fire spell, a percentage of the crit dmg is rolled into the debuff ignite.  Basically ignite keeps rolling the more crits thatcome in and the mages who crit first and started the ignire ends up getting credit for ALL the damage rolled into the ignite.  This mage can beat warriors, but that's because he is stealing other mage's damage.
---
In general though the only thing that can stop warriors from shredding everything is threat.  They have no natural threat reduction unlike mages or ability to drop threat like rogues.  This is where Salv vs Windfury is a big deal.  Windufry is cool to upssing DPS, but warriors don't really need more dps, they need threat reduction.
---
Its same one for sapper charges lol blizz reusing everything
---
Sounds like a shit show.  Locking servers has always been a poor idea.  Runescape’s open server system is much more refined.
---
It’s almost as if everyone has a different perspective and experience playing a video game. It’s almost as if both factions take the option to kill the other faction if they can get away with it. Crazy.

take him on a dungeon run and just let him be on passive and do nothing

Honestly, I appreciate the instructions. lol

True. I also put crusader on it so that helped but you have a point.

It’s a great spectator sport.
---
&gt; You can skip every raid when Naxx comes out. Every item in Naxx in almost every slot is better than in previous raids. There are some exceptions, but overall Naxx is greater all.
---
That's not what I mean with skipping. What I ment is like skip MC, BWL and AQ and go clear Naxx in blues. The bigger the jumps between tiers the harder skipping is because they are balanced around you having gear from previous tiers.
---
"The light, and how to swing it."

They were just putting the dire maul book into practice.

#REEEEE!!
---
homestead thts all i want xd
---
Why didn’t I think of that? Thanks!
---
karazhan
---
A tank had two jobs. You're doing one job. The worst job I would even argue. At least a tank with threat means they are at least putting damage out. A tank with no threat just debuffs mobs a bit lol
---
Horde dominated world PVP on Flamelash-EU and Alliance pulled out with free character transfer like spineless cowards.
---
/u/shittywatercolor is that you?
---
You can hold 700-800dps melee in pre raid gear as deep prot. More on alliance side.
---
Your right about taking threat pieces, but they should really only be doing that once melee are really pushing them.
---
They’ll only farm hk’s if they’re trying to troll. The honor you get from hk’s is minuscule compared to the honor you get from winning. Even with long ques the best thing to do efficiency wise would be end the game asap winning and re-que for another match.
---
&gt;You asked a specific question I responded to. I never defended shitty behavior.
---
You did, by putting the blame on blizzard.
---
&gt;If you feel the need to argue and there is no room for discussion, move on.
---
Same to you. Yet you're still here. So apparently you don't follow your own advice.
---
&gt;My point is you will not fix anything in those situations.
---
My point was not to fix anything, it was to point out how stupid your point is. How blizzard should fix the situation is another topic.
---
&gt;There is no point in trying to develop some online mind control that doesnt exist.
---
Nobody is talking about mind control, you're not even making sense.
---
This such specific great evidence lol. Seriously props lol. Dont really understand why others needed to downvote and get emotional about my comment. My point is still stands......
---
How do you figure?
---
You are in for a bad time. Blizzard said early 2020, which goes as far as march.
---
That's a wild assumption with no factual basis.
---
Can‘t you put master loot to epics only? That should prevent others from rolling on it :)
---
Come to Arcanite Reaper. It’s a PvP “west coast” (my friends and I are all east coast and it hasn’t affected us) server and it’s like 60/40 alliance/horde. Fairly balanced all things considered.
---
&gt;meanwhile the forums back then were on fire from alliance bitching about how long bg ques were.
---
I'm tempted to say something here... But you should see if you can solve this mystery for yourself. C'mon! C'mon! Can you do it?
---
&gt;and you sit there pretending you signed up for hardmode.
---
Alliance is obviously significantly harder than Horde on a PvP server. You said so yourself, that playing Alliance was "masochistic". The same way people say that playing Dark Souls or Ninja Gaiden is masochistic.
---
&gt;the populations even today aren't as skewed as you clowns claim
---
Well, the data disproves that, so OHWELL.
---
Glancing reduction is very important, but maybe the furies in your guild are just bad so it doesn’t matter.
---
More like zoned in and died to trash
---
Me not that kind of orc
---
You can, check settings.
---
&gt; Yeah totally this guy's attitude was really friendly in the replies here
---
 
---
   You're surprised that insulting someone results in unfriendly comment replies?
---
Not their game. Old blizzard game. I don’t even think any of the original team is still around. The company certainly isn’t still around.
---
Yeah you can never except the individual to martyr themselves, when their effect is so minimal, and no one is likely to join them. Putting the blame on the players is pointless, because they'll never change and  to some people it just gives them more pleasure seeing people become upset.
---
It's on higher institutions, in this case Blizzard, to change things. If people are incentivized to do something they will, and in this case it forces other people to do it as well, or risk getting no honour.
---
If battle grounds doesn't mostly fix the issue, then Blizzard is going to have to step in and do something about it.
---
You should play through all of the alliance and horde quests at least once. It's an amazing game. I prefer horde quests in classic, but the alliance does have some good moments 😁
---
You don't have to delete the 54 character. Just park it for a while.
---
Transfers have been closed for a few days now.
---
one thing to note is that AQ contributions auto-fill but at a much slower rate, so while it will *eventually* unlock on its own, the horde on that server have their new raid locked away alot longer than other servers
---
Because they are. Do you really think a video game faction defines people? There are serious alliance pvpers and they are camping the shit out of everyone they can for 4 kills to get their 120k honor every week, too. My server is slightly horde favored. All that does is make the alliance band together more instead of solo pvp. They're much bigger offenders when it comes to cheap and cheesy honor farming. I don't blame them, though, because that's how they have to do it. I killed a certain warrior 1v1 on my rogue today and laughed because it was literally the first time I'd ever seen him in the world without a hpally and resto druid pocket healing him. Dozens of encounters, and he'd literally never been alone. I don't blame him though. It's the most effective way to play warrior.
---
You got two accounts or your horde and ally on diff servers? cause you can have a horde an ally toon on one account on a pvp server
---
There's also the Elixir of Dream Vision, basically works as Warlock's Eye of Kilrogg
---
They had to find someway to weed out the weak.. 
---
Just kidding, even though I’m having fun, there are times for me to log off and enjoy something else, like you know real life
---
Are you referring to PvP healers? I think you are. In that case I’ll say: there is no fame for healers. They never get praise. The damage dealers, the killshots, the number of killing blows. That’s the stuff that gets the fame. And which stick to what this whole comment line is talking about, that mentality of kills = wins is part of the minmax mentality.
---
anecdote doesn't mean "didn't happen"
---
I mean, it seems like alliance is way more triggered than horde, seeing as almost every post on this subreddit is anti-horde. I haven't seen a single post reach the front page about the douchebag alliance players. And they do exist. My server has plenty. Obviously a server with 75% horde is going to have more dicks who are horde. But a 50/50 server will have an equal amount of dicks. 
---
It's factionism and it's not cool!
---
&gt;Theorycrafting is for the minmaxing, high level players.
---
Lol. Okay bud.
---
I mean in wotlk.. sure. However im not even sure how you would gear a prot paladin past dungeon gear. Stack int and abuse the shut out of blessing spam threat gen ?
---
If the pet is grabbing aggro, it's using Growl. Period. There's also the animation above the monster's head to watch out for. That said, hunter pets should be dismissed in dungeons. Their stupid AI has a tendency to pull extra packs of mobs that far outweighs any DPS they might bring to the party.
---
As for priests using Mind Blast, you can check your damage meter. And just like Growl it shows a very noticeable animation above the affected monster (and a loud sound effect that goes along with it).
---
Thought they were doing “battle groups” for BGs. If so I don’t think they are going to mix PvP and PvE servers. Unless you have a dev response that states that they are mixing PvP and PvE servers for BG queues?
---
you absolute legend!
---
If they end up totally shitting the bed we can always go back to pservers.  At least the CS and devs got things done there. Servers were stable too.
---
My mentality for dungeons has always been that you need if you want it, greed if you don't. 
---
You might be a healer, but you're not his long term healer.  He may be gearing up to be a healer himself, who knows. 
---
Main spec and off spec concepts have a place in a long term partnership setting, but in PUG mode with no loot rules specified in advance, he did nothing wrong. 
---
I really hate this idea that players are held accountable to unspoken etiquette, and especially hate the mentality that we're supposed to police each other.  
---
Sorry it happened, but I don't think anyone was in the wrong here.
---
&gt; forced faction balance
---
Not a thing you can really do.
---
&gt; remove 1hour to get gold from AH
---
Thats not going to happen, its still a thing on retail.
---
&gt;and remove 1 hour mail time between alts(same account mail)
---
Agree.
---
&gt; remove world buff CD
---
Would sure help some of the drama that has been happening on my server of late with guilds dropping heads out of turn. 
---
&gt; Make new raids worldbuff-less for the first month so you can feel real progression
---
Not going to happen
---
&gt; make felwood items like whipper and songflower be granted to anyone who starts looting
---
I'd appreciate some kind of anti-ninja, where only the cleanser can loot for a short period (5-10 seconds would do it) 
---
&gt; slightly increase raid difficulty by increasing damage/hp/armor, start strongly in MC then less and less boost and then a blizzlike naxx
---
Disagree strongly. #nochanges here. 
---
&gt; remove lag in pvp duh
---
Lets all move into the DC then. 
---
&gt; change batching to be 100ms instead of 400 to reflect better ping
---
Nope, the behavior of batching is important to classic combat in many situations. 
---
&gt; remove leeway
---
You don't want that.
---
it's something that you can say as horde to alliance
---
They are probably still sitting in TP watching the flightmaster trying to get their 15 hks for the week.
---
For real though. I rolled on a PVE server with my mate earlier in the week. Hit STV and a horde... waved at me.
---
You are insanely delusional for thinking a faction defines people.
---
There's roughly an equal amount of nice people and shitty people on both factions. I dont have a horse in this race. My main is horde because my friends rolled horde. After they quit I rolled alliance alt to experience both worlds.
---
I have not killed a single guy after phase 1.
---
People can spend their money to do whatever they want. Get over it.
---
It’s funny to see the shoe on the other foot after playing on Northdale, which was ridiculously Alliance dominated and nearly impossible for Horde to quest in contested areas. I haven’t played classic yet but I’m quite enjoying the tears here
---
A short description of instance one hand weapons is not really the link I was looking for, but thank you anyway.
---
yeah, MC was never difficult from a mechanics standpoint.  Or gear
---
You can just look at warcraftlogs if you want real data to compare. It clearly shows that spriest is statistically slightly worse than mages and locks if you look at parses, but where the difference really starts to show is in the 99th and max percentile. So basically if you're anything less than part of the top 1% guilds in the world, you're not even part of the debate of whether spriest would be a detriment to your raid. And even then... Spriest is not so far behind in the 99th percentile that they're likely to be in the "middle of the pack" on DPS meters if they put in the effort. And in those raids where people are doing big dick dps and going for speedruns, bossfights will also be so short that the spriest's main issue, mana management, won't ever actually be an issue.
---
But that's here in nerfed-to-the-ground MC with 1.12 talents and gear and all that jazz. When we reach later raids and the bossfights slow down to being several minutes long those spriests are gonna have a hard time keeping up because that's when their mana issues will really cripple them. They'll be popping several dark runes and chugging several mana pots per bossfight and that's an expensive habit. It can work, and probably will work for most people, but for hardcore guilds it just won't cut it.
---
Then again, hardcore guilds are also the types of people to stack over 20 brown rogues in groups with shamans just to clear things as fast as possible so you also have to ask yourself if that's the kind of raid environment you want to be part of. As a warlock if my only task was to put CoR on stuff and try to squeeze in a bit of DPS where I could, without SW or CoS or anything, then that would take away my willpower and fun. Likewise, I wouldn't force a priest to be SW/PI spec because it would gimp their personal performance to support others. We had a priest willingly respec to it recently because MC healing is a cakewalk and he was bored, but before that I've pined for a shadow priest to our officers for ages and they wouldn't budge. I honestly don't get it, but I have my SW/PI now so I'm a happy lock.
---
If you roll onto a server that sounds like trash, you're going to have a bad time.
---
The point isn't the higher DPS, the point is the higher TPS. The DPS players are often constrained by the tank's threat output. Higher TPS allows you to avoid losing aggro to high DPS, allow DPS to go all out, allowing you to kill the boss before healers run out of mana. If the tank gains greater TPS, then that means that the entire raid is free to do more DPS. That translates to way easier kills, which means faster progression.
---
Pop imbalances were definitely a thing in  vanilla. NoChanges meant exactly that.
---
I got lucky and monkey was the first drop i got from urok. Of the bear is close enough, its the armor that gives you the most anyways. If you don't want to farm LBRS to get the cloudrunner you could get the frostbite girdle from scholo which is pretty good too
---
As a fellow horde on AR, we'd love to welcome you, but for the sake of enjoyment for the both of you as first-timers, roll PVE or on another server. Alliance dominate this server and will take away your fun quickly.
---
AR is far from low pop, especially for ally. And classic WoW isnt the same experience as 2005 if you havent already figured from this sub.
---
Because you are wrong general gloves are bis.
---
Go farm water essence in Felwood and get a little exp too or fish them in Azshara
---
this was past their bedtime
---
Fucking lost it at the zombie shouting go to retail A+ mate
---
With the way ignite works you will have 1 mage at the top of meters literally every single time unless you left ignite fall off
---
Priest was an asshole for doing it without mentioning at the start of the run what his intent was. 
---
Due to the overabundance of healers and lack of tanks, I'll often tank instead of heal on my pally and druid. 
---
I'm still looking for piece x for my healing spec, but I'll tell the healer straight at the start that "I will need on x if it drops, if you're not ok with that, then that's fine and you can leave the group now", reserve the piece or invite a healer that can't use that piece(priests or druids if piece x is above their armor class)
---
Only 100 guilds cleared naxx in the whole of vanilla.
---
It helps a lot through the leveling process as well. since it makes it way easier for melee classes to kill higher level mobs it's far from inconsequential. 
---
You could easily argue you don't necessarily need any racial, but that doesn't mean they aren't extremely helpful at times.
---
+5 from axes is great as well I'd still say humans come out on top in that comparison since they get both maces and swords which gives you a much wider variety of options.
---
He must feel his trusty mount is worth less than One of the the 150+ slots he has :(
---
You mean raz
---
That's not a fair solution though. You would be punishing an entire server population for happening to be the dominant faction. I'd hate having to change faction or server because blizzard fucked up
---
The main purpose of cross-realm BGs is to reduce queue times. It would make no sense to keep them separate.
---
Tuberculosis.
---
Except unless you farm gold on alliance side, you´re going to have to sell the items for cheap though neutral AH.
---
Which opens it all to being sniped and stolen, which I can guarantee someones going to do.
---
Then you get to the part where that Alliance character has to actually make it to the turn in.
---
Considering the amount of pointless griefing just to fuck on other people going on, Im sure there will be some horde players who will find it extremely funny to just murder that Alliance character again and again and again.
---
How would you as a horde player prevent any of this ?
---
????
---
Probably one of the most intense opening sequences I've ever had the pleasure of watching. Loved those two movies.
---
priest perspective: total dick move, that guy is a ninja. spriest should only take healer gear that the actual healer doesn't need. dude's a dick and should be branded a ninja looter.
---
Sounds like a great and well thought out system.  Personally I stopped playing retail before the war more changes but it seems to me like they just removed pvp servers and made every server pve.  Terrible.
---
I wouldn't waste your time.  You'll just be camped at FPs and all the harbors will ally sits in SW and IF and not be able to get much done during prime time playing hours.   Alliance on Benediction don't really put up much fight, unless they're a raid headed somewhere.   The imbalance will only get worse as well as horde jump ship from dead servers.
---
Do you disagree with that? Half the people who post in fight club ask about high level techniques like HS queueing, Slam macro, or ask about tiny gear differences. Without fail their biggest problem is the basic rotation and CD timings. 
---
You just fix the simple things first and move on up, too many people focus on .5% differences when they could perform 30% better with the gear they already have.
---
More relevant to this actual discussion, I’ll remind you that TPS theorycrafting is only relevant when there’s actually a chance of the tank losing threat... that means single target 800 dps furies on horde, 1k or so on alli.
---
Worth in this case refers to having more value in regards to endgame progression due to the Classic loot system and time restraints of raid lockouts. You're throwing away weeks of raiding and potential gear progression as well as your currently achieved gear progression by rerolling which is something that would make anyone hesitant to reroll.
---
It never works for me P3 Ony. And it is 30% drop chance. I don't think that math works out to be 2 per run haha. You may not even get one during a reset period. And it isn't like there is anything to do while you're waiting for it to reset.  
---
I just don't think it is worth it. Speed runs sure. Not average guild runs. Bear will still be doing more threat than fury prot. Only way a warrior could beat a bear without MCP is DW.
---
I MT 100% of fights. MC and Ony.
---
How could this happen to meeeee 😢
---
Look at all of the alliance downvoting this because they don’t get it.
---
“Enough people can’t figure it out so we’ll just say it’s right for some reason I guess”
---
This is how the word “literally” has been used as “not literally”
---
Not surprising there are few horde there.
---
Lmao you´re in for a rude awakening after the first weeks rush is over.
---
Assuming horde will even have sub 10 minute ques after first few days.
---
I used to wave to every single horde on my og server, dreadmist eu. Most waved back. Some still killed me. Then the first 2 weeks were over and the camping started. Rerolled a week ago, after not playing for a month. Actually having fun now with a pally!
---
If you use that logic, then you shouldn't give any gear to the disc/weaving Priest either because his healing is sub-par compared to real healers.
---
In reality: good luck finding someone to actually play that spec if you're not going to give them loot. You have to reward that person to keep them motivated. The good news is the game isn't tuned that tightly that you need to maximize the benefit from every single upgrade for months on end in order to clear the content.
---
I just keep my old mount in a book.
---
What happened to flamelash?
---
So the answer is “no, I do not have a source and just hope they will mix PvP and PvE servers”
---
Here’s a counter: it makes no sense to mix PvE and PvP servers for BG queues since the PvP servers have had a chance to actually gain rank and PvE players haven’t, or at least have a much harder time doing so.
---
Well, there's a difference. I think Gehennas or other servers where you have bracket stacking is a great example. Maybe you had 270k cap for br1, now it would be hard for some people to hit without BG's. Add a day with BG's and now it could be between you having a day off, and having to farm BG's all day because blizzard is incompetent as fuck
---
Everyone's downvotes speak for themselves, you have really bad takes lol
---
jamflex bad
---
They all rolled classic.
---
What the fuck? Ally coordinates 320k caps? That's actually insanely high
---
No one cares about when the top guilds in the world will clear the raid content. The only thing that matters is when THEY or YOU will clear it which I absolutely doubt will be done in any type of fast. The top guild clearing it has absolutely no effect on you or any of us "average" raiders. My raid group clears Ragnaros in less than a minute every time and my guild has cleared Molten Core in less than 38 minutes. I doubt that we'll have an easy time with C'thun nonetheless.
---
Ya, and like I said I understand why some guilds do that stuff. But I am not under any delusions that the guild I am in will be clearing naxx anyway. Plus that is months away, we could give an item to a mage and they quit or move guilds. I just don't think its worth sweating a lot for 90% of the playerbase this early in the game.
---
Sure. But every player has things that they could do to mitigate their burden on others, so how far do you want to take that? 
---
Arguably, some classes bring worse things to the table than others. Should people not play those classes because it raises the burden on others?
---
This is what i talk about every day when it comes to BiS discussions.
---
Get ready for a classic “summer”!
---
QQ.
---
Fora  Healer they are pretty bad. They have absolutely no +Heal and the MP5 is kinda pointless since there are really no fights where you can go OOM unless you are low on Healers.
---
The person who gets aggro in p3 *is* the tank, doesn't matter what class they are.
---
Have you considered playing one of the thousands of PvP games out there where you can't obtain a massive, unfair advantage by twinking?
---
There are fighting games, MOBAs, real-time strategy games, turn-based strategy games, MMORPGs like Guild Wars 2, tons of them. If what you want to do is play a fun game against another person to pit your skill and knowledge against theirs there are lots of options besides 10-19 Warsong Gulch.
---
Of course maybe the only reason you want to twink is specifically so you can have a massive, unfair advantage in a PvP game and spoil the game for others so you can have a particularly selfish and pointless kind of fun. In which case maybe you should rethink your life and your priorities?
---
I am horde, I am griefed constantly by alliance.
---
Get off your high horse, this isn't a fraction issue, it is a population issue.
---
No changes. Get filtered
---
You clearly never heard of warrior vanish.
---
Hint: brez
---
Yeah sorta regretting it in hindsight, oh well
---
I know I was just saying that the population isn't always full on other servers all through the day
---
I agree but there's a snowballs chance queues are implemented.
---
Or just make all PvP zones, FFA for ungrouped memebrs a la Gurubashi.
---
How does being able to be attacked in a neutal city create a feeling of faction war lol? If it was any realistic you'd instantly become hated with the goblins for attacking in their neutral city, the only reason you can is because there was no sanctuarry system implemented in vanilla.
---
Also that has literally nothing to do with the state of retail and the feeling of "danger" in regards to PvP. You're scapegoating a random feature of the game when in reality the game changed philosophy altogether.
---
All these posts only prove that "you think you do but you dont" sentence, Vanilla is Vanilla fellow players with the good and the bad in it. Thing is it is 2019 or better almost 2020, players do not play like 2004, this is no longer a pristine world waiting to be discovered , it is a jungle where you are either hunter or prey.That is the climate of the usual PvP server in my humble opinion. Adapt or you will not have a good day fellow players.

Love your condescending tone towards something trying to help you, when you quite clearly didnt read a single post in the comment-chain and is extremely vague with your questioning. A bigger jerk is sadly not hard to found, doesnt make you less of one though.
---
At low spell power, while talented Fireball deals more damage than talented Frostbolt, it's the Frostbolt that has a higher damage per second.  
---
Several factor play into this, one being that since Frostbolt casts faster, you are able to get more off and thus have more crits (and Frost gets 100% crit bonus).  Also, many early raids have fire resistance. 
---
However, as mages gain spell power, Fire will gain traction.   For every 1 point of spell power, Fireball will gain 1 damage; but Frostbolt will only gain 0.81 damage.  The difference will allow Fireball to pull ahead, and become the prime dps spec in later phases.
---
Its probably not worth sweating about, you're right. I mentioned it in another comment but I am an endgame wow noob. I never raided really so I don't know all the different raids and their difficulty spikes. I guess I'm just making the point that I can see where people are apprehensive about gear going to a less cookie-cutter spec, but like I mentioned I am a big spriest fan. I have a druid alt. I fully support the "play how you want" style.
---
Same on Skeram.
---
Flame trash allies have no one to blame but themselves.
---
Don't mind him, the server was fine until phase 2 hit. Sorry you're stuck on there now. If you feel up for it, there's some people in my guild on earthshaker leveling again because they also were too late to transfer. I'm also leveling another alt, you could level along with us :)
---
Blizzard just did a mass ban of classic accounts in September 2019.
---
You got me there, it's actually decent; for now.
---
I stopped tanking cause toxic players fucking everything up and blaming tanks
---
what is the horde to alliance ratio?
---
Thanks.
---
I'm going to go ver a cinnamon roll right now.
---
i assume you stopped tanking in pugs, that argument has been itterated plenty in pve
---
They can just funnel the mats through the neutral AH. Also there are 10x more players per realm but the required mats amount didn't increase so it'll be open in no time.
---
remindme! 3 days
---
Aren't a bunch of Alliance jumping ship from Flamelash to Earthfury?
---
Yep.
---
For what it's worth I've been leveling as a Druid on Herod Alliance and I felt it was basically the same as P1 while below 48. Past 48 *some* zones were a huge pain. Tanaris was about the same, Gadgetzan itself being really fucking annoying though. Searing Gorge &amp; Burning Steppes were obviously huge pains, and if I didn't have the ability to stealth around to mobs I would've just skipped them. Un'Goro was worse solely due to that one quest to get tar from the mobs that are right next to the city, all but 1 or 2 of my deaths were while doing that quest. Feralas, Blasted Lands, Felwood all felt the exact same as they did in P1 in my experience. I was doing a kill quest yesterday in Felwood and there were 5 Horde there doing the same quest, and none of them attacked me. Most 48+ levelers leave each other alone I've noticed. I'm doing Winterspring then WPL/EPL next and I'd guess those will be pretty similar to the Gorge &amp; Steppes.
---
Human druid in travel form, wtf is this?
---
It depends on how #nochanges Blizzard is about the AQ40 gates.
---
OG vanilla, the gates simply never open unless you do it yourself.
---
In later patches, the gates always open after some time, so no servers are locked out of that content.
---
the primary reason there is a lack of tanks is simple; warriors get all the loot they want tanking their own dungeons. Tanks keep groups favorable to their loot needs, and once they are done, they're done. I could not imagine playing warrior and rolling for items like Cape of the Black Baron, or not res'ing 1 piece of Dal'Rends on my Rend runs. If you need to spec prot to tank dungeons, you have issues.
---
Paladins are super busted and make pve a breeze. Good paladins are worth gold in pvp. 
---
Allaince just full of bad players and crybabies.
---
We appreciate your service!
---
Seriously this mentality is so fucking bonkers. "Sit there and continue bearing and gritting your teeth over being literally farmed! Enjoy your nights being 60% corpserunning, being good little PvP boars to be fed to the Horde farming slaughter! What? You don't like that? How DARE you! You're going to ruin our server if you leave!!!"
---
Thanks for the info!
---
The majority of alliance players are absolute fairies and if their server isn’t perfectly 50/50 or in their favor they will mass transfer off, effectively ruining two servers. This is just the latest example
---
I disagree, leveling doesn't serve a purpose beyond being a gatekeeper to the actual game play.
---
As a dwarf I gank all horde on sight because I’ve never had an experience where horde leave me alone if they have a fighting chance.  As well I was ganked by max lvls while leveling so I pay it forward to any horde.  Let the circle of gank continue.
---
HonorSpy
---
I mean..
---
earthfury was a near 50-50 server.
---
Then they opened transfer on a bunch from faerlina, herod, stalagg and co.
---
two week later, earthfury is now ... 65-35 at best, cause no horde is gonna leave their horde-dominated server for no reasons.
---
Did transfer helps any server?
---
And trying to convince all the Horde players who are my friends that are the sole reason I play the game to also change is hard, you won't believe me but I've tried to change alliance I actually really like alliance but they've all put so much time in it's hard to just up jump and swap to the other side leaving it all behind
---
Why would you bring 6? Just bring less rogues and more warriors at that point.
---
Bunch of idiots started crying and a semi balanced server winded up a ghost town. But that’s allies for you.
---
hahahhahahahahah
---
Dont let the menethil harbor boat smack you in the ass on the way out.

And the dwarfen occupiers that are mining ore that RIGHTFULLY belongs to the Tauren has made genocide into a sport whenever they see something that aint fat, ugly and beardy.
---
I have seen several bots on both factions farming the hypogryphs in the southwest area of Feralas. They are always there B-lining it to out of sight mobs, killing/skinning, and vibing.
---
Hmmmmm, mmhmm.

What's a cyno?

Now this has always been an issue but if you attack someone. Then lose. Why do you call your buddies to them best them.

Lose with some respect.

Quality shitpost, take your upvote

People gloss over that.

Especially when you think about how gear-starved a 10 warrior raid is going to be.

5/95 isn't even that bad
---
&gt;Let me guess, you in the underpopulated faction on a unbalanced server?
---
I'm actually on one of the few relatively balanced servers.  
---
&gt;As soon as you find a target that yields honor you HAVE to kill it.
---
No you don't.
---
&gt;But the honor system removes this choice
---
No it didn't.

&gt;You seem to think it’s all mentally unstable psychopaths.

# #nochanges

but blizzard makes changes by not including it XDDDDDDDDDD
---
HAHA no this is my reddit account - antimage 
---
also who is this
---
The issue isn't even Classic having problems. If anyone expected Classic to be "perfect and bug free" they were only kidding themselves. It's people in this subreddit that are the problem. This place is toxic and has been maybe since it's inception. 
---
Every online game in existence has a community of people who sit around and complain about how shitty the devs are for ruining their good time. Classic WoW is no exception, the community just happens to be significantly larger than most single game communities, so the echo-chamber megaphone is a little louder than we're used to.
---
 Maybe people struggle to remember the tidal waves of complaints on the Vanilla Blizzard forums, it made /r/classicwow look like a kindergarten food fight.
---
It's a PVP server only thing. Horde typically have a bit of population lead over the Alliance on PVP servers as people tryharding about PVP want those racials. With the release of the honor system, things have taken a turn for the worse as the Classic servers have massive populations compared to Vanilla. Instead of having skirmishes between 1-5 people, you have people running around in roaming deathballs, which both sides have been doing. Anyone getting nostalgic about running solo and having small skirmishes in Vanilla is greeted by a group of 5+ people running a train on them.
---
With the Horde's population lead on these much larger Classic servers, that means there are a bunch of Horde death squads in these zones. This means Horde players will have an easier time dealing with Alliance camping a spot as all they have to do is inform the honor-hungry Horde deathballs where a bunch of Alliance are at. For Alliance it becomes a nightmare to get around in important areas like Blackrock Mountain or high-level quest zones as they're multiple groups running around. This is heightened by the fact that the major form of transport for Alliance (boats) are in contested zones with sparse NPCs hanging around. Meanwhile the Horde have their zeppelins in starting zones. Coupled with the fact that it's well known that the Horde have a population lead on their server means the Alliance don't want to stick around on that server. One of the worse parts about this is that you have a bunch of Horde hunting Alliance in their cities, which makes the sense of helplessness even greater. 
---
Once some people on the Alliance transfer off, even more people transfer off because the population disadvantage becomes even more severe. This is what happened with Flamelash. Horde had an advantage and it become significantly worse as time went on. Eventually an Alliance guild brought up the idea of transferring off the server and it caused every other Alliance to consider doing the same before the transfers were closed. It was basically a bank run on the Alliance population. My server recently has had a similar issue as two Alliance guilds have transferred off, mainly because they kept getting killed while farming consums for raids and because they felt they had no shot at world bosses.
---
It's super fucking annoying trying to level when I get ganked over and over.
---
At least I know I can go to searing gorge in peace. I GUESS.
---
You really should not be downranking while leveling. Your most mana efficent spell will allways be your highest rank. Use those ranks and use them in a way you don't overheal
---
What I'm talking about is, though.  It's quite literally textbook sociopathic behavior.
---
Dudes there like sooo many threads on this now but basically the alliance flocked in mass when offered free transfer and I mean it went from like 60% horde and 40 alliance to about 80% horde to 20 alliance and its not so much fun on a pvp server when that happens so my thinking was if the alliance all flocked to earth shaker and it was fairly even before then they'll need a few more horde to make it even and now my pvp server is fucked it seemed like a good choice
---
The big one for me is being able to take a boat in peace. No, not only the BB/Ratchet boat. *Any* boat. All boats were camped on my original server.
---
Your warriors probably just suck
---
Enjoy the BG queues.
---
&gt;You think getting rank 14 gear a month earlier is worthless?
---
Well for starters 99% of the honor grinders are never touching rank 14, but yes getting your rank 10/11/12/13/14 rewards a couple weeks earlier is worthless.
---
&gt;I'd be willing to guess a ton of people will give a fuck about getting there before anyone else.
---
If being first didn't mean griefing that would be fine.  It does, so if you're willing to grief for a month so you can get to whatever rank you're aiming for first you are a sociopath.
---
Hot take: People will always complain about unfair or fair advantages if they happen to lose.
---
Hi, /u/Fluid_Vehicle

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e7nyet/i_dont_think_anyone_is_going_to_beg_for_wpvp_for/).

Imagine thinking any one server is predominately more/less skilled than your own lmfao. If anyone who wrote those comments in the discord is here: you're a sad, pathetic person.
---
/who ironforge, 11 results
---
There’s no alliance, they all transfered. Many times there’s more horde in major cities than alliance. It’s a completely dead server.
---
If they do so I come make a Horde alt and camp it, to make them wait longer for being so rude to my ally mates.
---
"Takes me 5 deaths to make it through BRM"
---
-Me thinks- "I wish"
---
And find someone who is also flagged. Granted it’s not *impossible* for them to gain rank w/o BGs, just more annoying.
---
So you instead suggest forcing people to reroll instead and have nothing to show for all the effort and time they put into their man, while still leaving the server just as dead?  
---
What difference does having a bunch of unplayed 60s make to a server vs having none at all? Forcing someone to stay on the server doesn't mean you're forcing them to be an active member of the server. They'll reroll or quit if it's as bad as most pvp servers are right now.
---
That’s exactly what I said. Think you replied to the wrong person
---
How did you make your Titan Panel look like that?
---
"Give alliance blood elves"

       - Honestly best suggestion so far

When I started playing I used the name Kessel for an orc warrior for a long time only to find out that there's a draenei NPC on bloodmyst isle with the same name.

You seem to be misunderstanding faction queues.
---
Faction based queues would give each faction a maximum allowed population. There are a lot of implications here. The most important one being a forced 1:1 A:H ratio.
---
&gt;Who is to blame?
---
The people doing the corpsecamping.  Without question.
---
Pve you can opt into PvP. PvP your wife cannot opt of of pvp. You're making a huge mistake. Don't judge the PvP server based on early levels where literally no one gives a fuck and no one is even allowed to kill you. Low levels is the same as a pve server.
---
!remind me 365 days
---
If you want to be really safe try to get all your gear as early as possible (like 13 or 14 if ideally). A good way to do this is get run trhough dungeons but stand outsode the dungeon until the boss that drops an item is about to be killed then run in. This way you don't level too fast while fighting RNG for your BiS items. Then all you have to do is just level to 19 (which doesnt take long) and not worry about exp.
---
Also if for some reason you plan on WPvP with your twink, go explore the enemy zones ahwad of time as to eliminate the off chance of dinging 20 while WPvP.
---
Although at the end of the day if yoy accidentally dinged 20, you can always become a 29 twink!
---
Shamans can kill their own totems with a macro, but not other players.
---
Good one dude. Thanks for the thoughtful criticism.

What...? Recklessness + Execute make Warriors beat anyone in short fights. Hunters won't stand a chance dude

Wowhead guides are trash, stay away

Whenever I see this shit in pugs/dungeons/whatever, I always retort with something along the lines of "Wow, only ~100-200 players IN THE WORLD managed to down naxx40 and I'm lucky enough to run with 4 of them!? Aw shucks, how lucky am I?"
---
and then they die to something stupid that a toddler could avoid

&gt;You can't just expect everyone to stop doing that.

It's a sad reflection on the state of our race that you think we can't expect people to not be raging, vicious, sociopathic cunts.

I play like 5 hours a week, but got 2 accounts. It’s 30€ a months. I pay more for a day at the cinema with my wife, Even the Nikolaus present of my daughter was more expensive.
---
Ummm, so I've played both horde and alliance, as have most my friends. I've largely found that there isn't a meaningful difference between the "type of people" who picks one or the other.
---
When I made this post my thinking was more along the lines of social media and echo chambers. Figured there were 3 possible explanations: horde and alliance Reddit users are somehow fundamentally different, Reddit's algorhythm and likes system hides certain posts, or my own biases are clouding my judgement.
---
I looked at my feed for a couple of days and confirmed no Heartseeker posts come up. I further didn't think it was because there are just more horde heavy servers because the same 2 or 3 server names come up over and over. So it seems my balance plays a minor role (though it's clearly still there).
---
It seems to be that the community curates these Heartseeker posts out of people's feed, as in fact, my vision is quite good and I do not see the Heartseeker posts. Granted, I'm not on here that often, but I think that's super interesting. What does that say about public discourse? About Democratic governance? This is like some Noam Chomsky shit right here.
---
Google “19 hunter twink Classic” and you will get much more detailed info than from anyone posting here.
---
I was thinking about this today.  Phase 1 was the best PVP.  On your toes and watching the enemy out of the corner of your eye.  Sometimes even friendly encounters that can be very rewarding.  Now everything is just kill on site.  The PvP during Phase 1 was so much more complex and almost a social experiment.
---
I rolled my reply to this into my greater reply
---
Nine hours after posting i've handed out about 45 care packages.   I think I'm done for the evening and just want to enjoy a few beers and  playing the game.  Tomorrow I'll get back to sending stuff out.  Thanks  everyone and have fun out there!  Give the horde hell.
---
Taking a break for the night.
---
People just don’t like the responsibility of tanking. There are tons of warriors, but many of them only DPS. 
---
I don’t think PvP really has much to do with it, since the best PvP and 5 man dungeon spec are both arms warrior.
---
Yeah different with mage can make a heap more do EPL bats good drop table sell eyes they drop on ah they are getting close to a gold each and drop often
---
The main problem my guild has is no body helps anyone else get these pieces.... Rogue without dal tends or HoJ at this point..... guild has ony splits and mc on lockdown.
---
Play a druid and dont buy a mount until you get epic mount
---
There's gonna be another private server project that pops up at some point and wins back the hardcore playerbase from classic once classic is at/near the end of its life cycle.  The demand is there for a proper vanilla experience and classic has failed pretty badly at delivering it so far.
---
Exactly my thoughts. I just want that back, with the honor system still there in bg's
---
heartseeker
---
so you don't have to move when faction queues are added
---
Rank 13 will be FUCKING HARD for the next few months. But in about 3-4, maybe 6 months when the hardcore grinders have gotten r14, it is humanly possible if you can commit to the r11-r13 grind with a daily 6-7 hour pvp session.
---
The only complaining posts I see, come from Alliance.
---
I get the shared cooldown but it's not a long cooldown (6 seconds?) and the the triggers are different. Are you really missing that many OPs if you're using revenge?
---
20 min queue isnt that bad? idk..
---
Omfg I did the same thing in Mulgore.
---
Lol, post a log so we can see. Spoilers, you won't.
---
They're not terrible, but they are inferior to the hybrid specc and 30/0/21, yeh. Boomkin can still do quite well, the ability to be casting while also not afraid of rogues/getting zerged is pretty underrated.
---
*50+ ally gripe posts a day on frontpage*
---
'Horde so triggered rn lol'
---
To prove me right I'll get 20+ salty ally downvotes.
---
Bro its the game developers fault. Its their game. Not the players.
---
My server has a 60-40 ratio. I really hope it won’t change!
---
I still remember the big kerfuffle when world first brutallus had a ret pally lol
---
&gt; Lol the salt !!
---
The salt here is all from the butthurt twinkers who get emotional when people call them out as losers who get off on ruining the game for people who can't fight back. I had a 19 hunter twink in WotLK (although I didn't turn xp off in battlegrounds because I'm not a loser who wants to grief noobs forever), so I know from personal experience that (a) it's fun for the twinker and (b) it ruins the game for everyone else, is massively unfair, makes you a worse PvPer and makes you a worse person.
---
&gt; Same goes for freshly dinged 60 vs bis 60, it's not unfair it's just whoever put more time into getting a good char
---
You aren't fooling anyone.
---
The reason twinkers prey on the 19 bracket is that they know it has a constant influx of genuine levellers who play the game more or less normally and want to have some fun as a break from levelling. Those are the people they enjoy griefing.
---
I mean, look at the shit in this thread alone. "Get a 60 to clear dungeons for you except for the one boss that you want, so you only get xp from that one kill" - sure, that's something everyone does while levelling, that's totally cool and normal and anyone can do it.
---
Like I said, there are loads of other games if you want a fair fight. Or there's 60 PvP which is still unbalanced but much closer to a fair fight. But if you're so pathetic that the only PvP game you can enjoy is one where you've sunk dozens of hours into grinding a massively unfair advantage and you know you can go up against people who have not done that, own it instead of crying. Stand up proudly and say "I am emotionally incapable of playing fair PvP games, I'm going to make my own safe space where I win all the time with no skill and I can pick on beginners forever".
---
Important for threat, which is your #1 priority as a tank.
---
I can't answer that for you but reading Eve stories is fucking nuts. Last I heard there was some kind of alien fleet destroying everything in the game. I really should read up on what happened there because Eve players were losing their fucking minds because the new AI was costing them thousands of dollars.
---
:)
---
I mean...
---
alot of warrior also want to play with an extremely durable healers who can give them on-demand FAPs... especially knowing how unreliable totems are in group PvP with their very limited range and 5 HP...
---
And how would an UD Rogue send these to ally toons?
---
what ur doing is a waste of time and wont impact the server's demographic in any shape or form
---
&gt;His first move was to remove local from the game in nullsec entirely, making it ridiculously easy for anyone to blindside someone trying PVE with next to no chance of them trying to avoid being ganked.
---
I stopped playing eve years ago and I remember some players arguing for the removal of local to no end. So I can see where he got the idea from.
---
But sounds like it went about as well as one would expect.
---
No, you can dps up until she lands. Once phase 3 starts is when you want to stop dps. It's smart not to use any dots near the end of phase 2, but you can still blast her until she starts to land
---
Literally just a picture of the game manual.
---
Good content, OP.
---
Exactly this, the only reason horde gets all the shit is because it's the more popular race so the amount of people doing it on horde it always going to be higher, its pretty much unavoidable, the nice will always be nice and the douche bags will always be douche bags
---
I actually thought about this today. Was sitting in the discord for my server and it was amazing to see how regular people can become so toxic given the right circumstances. They almost saw the other faction as non-human or sub-human.
---
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*
---
What about the transporters? I'm gnomish and made my gadgetzan transporter, if I switch to goblin can i still use it?
---
those totem with 5 HP that can get wiped out by any hunter with a /pet attack macro? those totem with limited range ?
---
you'd trade on-demand FAP  + the most durable healer for those?
---
You want reddit to tell you to kick him so you dont feel like the bad guy but you already know the answer.
---
They kill npcs and there’s a good number of people who are pvp flagged because they hearthstoned/took a mage port/landed from a flight point from a pvp area
---
Fun Video! Since you asked in your description: Your bitrate is *very* low. Either you didn't record in a high bitrate, or you didn't render it in one.
---
Settings for bitrate for Nvidia Shadowplay are in the video settings for example. 1080p60fps should have like 25mb/s at least, 1080p30fps looks almost flawless with 16mb/s. Youtube compresses a bit, but that's your issue from what I can tell. Hope this helps!
---
This was actually how most player trading worked in another mmo, Ragnarok Online. You had to create a separate character and make it a Merchant class, and you could essentially turn yourself into a NPC vendor, selling whatever items you want for whatever price you want. It was pretty neat, until you set up shop and go afk for a few hours, only to later find out that you got disconnected shortly after you set up, and nothing sold.
---
if there's no hunter with a /pet attack macro killing all your totem and if people stay in the limited range of your totem...
---
horde racial are largely overhyped.... and stuff like escape artist under-hyped.
---
pallies are monster in group PvP ; most durable healer with on-demand FAPs? yes please.
---
Anyone have an updated accurate mage pvp preraid bis ?
---
Most spriests I've talked to have been very understanding that they're not good be top DPS, likely not gonna get the best caster loot before other casters, and they're just thankful to be able to raid as a spec they enjoy playing and still contribute meaningfully to the raid.
---
Plus with good planning you can easily find some good items to give to your spriest. Or maybe see if there's anything for pvp that otherwise gets neglected. A good loot council should be happy to oblige with requests like that.
---
imagine crying about pvp on a pvp server. I used cod because as example because someone who is suggesting turning a pvp server into pve is probably a child that plays cod and can relate.
---
Neat
---
My guild had an orc warrion named Garrosh in Vanilla through Wrath. They forced him to change it in wrath, but he just quit instead.
---
Hope they let you keep your name!
---
Get 150 FR for the mobs and stay away from Lava Reavers. They have a 360° physical cleave. 
---
Good luck!
---
TBH, what happened to flamelash EU reminds me a little bit of Haroumash(Spelling?) US.
---
Horde guild advertisies haorumash(spelling) as "the place to be for WPvP", Total war I think was their name.
---
...Well, everyone and their mother decides to roll horde to join total war for this amazing WPvP, and they end up just overpopping the alliance, I never played there...
---
But I imagine it was hell, just scaled down due to server caps.
---
Not even in the same league though. I’m in a hugely Alliance-centric server (not that it matters a whole lot any more), but I’ve *never* seen the bonus go below 15%, and it has been 25% for months.
---
Alliance would get together, camp a flight point to finish the stupid quest, and go back to non-war mode immediately. Meanwhile, my horde character can essentially do whatever with war mode on with almost total impunity, and I’ve never seen the bonus go above 10%.
---
The bonus has never been near enough to encourage a large enough volume of Alliance to wpvp to really expand beyond the scope of a flight point or two.
---
On pull: pop bloodrage, rage potion, spam sunder and heroic strike.
---
Once at 5 sunders, prio is as follows:
---
Keep 5 sunders up
---
Bloodthirst
---
Heroic strike (or cleave) spam
---
Sunder armor
---
Use death wish on cool down (assuming you don't need to save it for a fear).
---
its mainly just the death ray and battle chicken, the rest can be made by someone else but it may be cheaper to make your own net o matic, shrink ray etc
---
Thanks! Should I complain about the game to?!?
---
And a complete threat wipe*
---
for pure healing, they are not the best, but they are bis for decurse/cure poison fights. chromaggus comes to mind.
---
No one beats Warriors.
---
Maplestory had something like this too. You could set up stalls at the marketplace and have your own npc sells items for you.
---
Warlocks are shit dpsers through all content compared to rogues, Mages, and warriors. 
---
The thing is that generally there are only 2~4 warlocks in hardcore cores, while there are 5~8 mages, this means that Warlocks ends getting gear faster than mages, but even with more gear, they cannot compete with mages in terms of Dps.
---
Mages are the kings of DPS at Naxx, and the Dps war between Warrior x Mages, depends on the encounter and the strategy the guild uses on those encounters. 
---
Another thing that I’d like to point, is the fact that people think fire mages only do high Dps because of ignite being buffed by other fire mages on the group. That’s not true. On a full run, Ignite’s owner changes, so it evens out.
---
So if it works for herbs its will work for ore also. Iirc it will for for hearth stone also
---
Also Alliance are more likely to sit in their city because they're outnumbered
---
Anyone have an issue with their UI-hide button randomly reassigning to b, or flickering on an off.  I have to reset it every time it does it.
---
I keep wondering if it's an addon of some kind. I use ELVUI, titanbar, and a few others.
---
I always find bots on the coast of Tanaris between Steamwheedle Port and the pirate base, farming turtle scales
---
At least earthshaker (that took majority of flamelash population) is suprisingly very healthy on balance atm.
---
Some of the bigger guilds announced their departure to their rival guilds on flamelash and they followed us. I think it was 55:45 A:H ratio the day after transfers closed but alliance always has less people PvP so it evens out.
---
I was against leaving but now I'm all for it. Earthshaker feels much more balanced and I haven't seen 60's camping duskwood or other leveling zones like at flamelash. 
---
Only thing we get are the salty horde players from flamelash making alts to trash alliance worldchat. Luckily there's active moderation on world so you don't have to ignore them yourself :)
---
My server ( US-earthfury) used to be nearly 50-50.
---
then all the alliance on various servers got tired of their horde-dominated server, and Xferred here.
---
as a result, earthfury went from 50-50 to nearly 70-30 over the span of 2 week. Horde raid group barely venture beyond kargath and there's endless QQ in world chat about getting camped.
---
so yeah, I agree with the other guy ... not allowing the underdog faction to transfer away won't help their server, but atleast it won't ruin the destination server...
---
also kill the destination server.
---
Thats the joke. Its that people who are always complaining about something with PVP are on these really imbalanced servers, and when they complain about it there are those 20IQ subhumans saying its just pvp on a pvp server and to get good
---
I’m still confused why I need to wait a few minutes to rez after being ganked several times by the same people.
---
So a PvE server lol...
---
Ok so we get even teams, but instead of 9v9 its 100v100. The maps are the same size and theres the same number of control points. Do you think most people would enjoy that?
---
I'm playing a pink ponytail gnome warrior and charge at anything that moves.
---
I aint bitter, I got a big bag of popcorn to enjoy all these people on pvp servers getting fucked after months of being called a carebear.
---
1 also prevent them from ruining the balance on the destination server.
---
like how earthfury-US went from a near 50-50 server to a 70-30 alliance dominated server over the span of 2 week.
---
If they've all been in the very top bracket for the last 4 weeks, then maybe they will hit rank 14 in 2 more months, likely well after BWL releases.
---
Kirtonos 51/48 lets go bgsssss
---
I switched from a PvP server to a PvE server and theres been a very healthy supply of PvP. If theres not any PvP currently going on it's very easy to get a group to stir up the horde and get large scale battles popping off. The only difference has been ganking. You get to decide when you want to PvP.
---
All these people making 19 twinks need to realize that 9/10 of the enemies are also twinks. No noobstomping available.
---
If everyone is super, noone is
---
How dose one ninja loot items in a guild who knows what there doing? 
---
What kind of guild leader can’t kick someone for stealing end game gear everyone has been working on forever? I would literally /Gquit if my guild leader couldn’t make his own decision on weather to kick a ninja looter or not. 
---
The other half who didn’t vote to kick him just want to see him suffer for months witch he won’t do. 
---
Everyone feels so special when there’s a magic blacklist.... like saying blacklist will prevent all the trolls from fucking up your day lol.
---
No idea? Not my problem. I am on a PVE server and things are going great!
---
This isn't true, and is in fact impossible. Render distance is always done server side and must always be done server side, the game client (private servers just use old versions of the game client) is very restricted.
---
Just afk for 5 minutes and they will stop camping you
---
Sounds like you'd enjoy a PvE realm..
---
Is leveling warrior fun? Or fun at 60? I keep seeing that its an not enjoyable grind but I wouldn't mind trying tanking at some point.
---
BUT MYYYYY GUILD has a naughty list and it makes us feel BeTter!
---
they are not. was hoping for a lil extra gold after upgrading but alas reddit karma will suffice.
---
Not that much if you think about how most PvP players rolled horde and roleplayers, raiders etc. rolled alliance. The overall population might be the same but horde has substantially more people actively PvP.
---
Uh what? They started dropping in the very very end of the expansion for Cataclysm no? Of course it would drop by the end, specially after having so many players at once.
---
Meh, only UD rogues.
---
Probably because you gank all horde on sight...
---
because of overhyped racials.
---
alliance have the most durable healer with on-demand FAPs ( and nevermind the PvE utility) while shaman class fantasy can be shut down with a hunter /pet attack macro...
---
people are in for a rude awakening when facing organized BG group.
---
do u also take Heartseeker Hordies?
---
How is horde vs alliance on Incendius?
---
Thanks guys and gals! Just need enough gold to get my blue sapphires + a tip for the crafter and I'll have myself lionheart \^\_\^
---
considering how little PvP happened in P1...
---
i'd say most people don't care about the grief, they only care about honor.
---
&gt; OSRS
---
why would you use an obscure acronym like that and just expect me to know what youre talking about
---
A mans bond with his companion transcends our war, brother.
---
How is it griefing?
---
me too, low server caps are a terrible idea and faction queues are also a terrible idea
---
Swifty just moved to an alliance populated server....
---
If the famous streamers are starting to add to the imbalance then yes, it’s going to get wayyyy worse.
---
Found the hord spy.
---
My guild always has everyone spread far apart in P2, and Onyxia has not deep breath'd at all in over a month.
---
That's some ridiculous "totally random".
---
DKP usually has nothing to do with living vs dying, just attendance.
---
As a mage i'm guilty but at the same time i can swear i stopped dps and i even ice blocked and still got aggro somehow.  I mean a full iceblock, boss does a 180 and just 1 shots me...
---
It’s not
---
I rolled a 98 on the GS chest in an MC pug on my alt a few weeks ago. 
---
After celebrating, another hunter rolled 98.
---
I then proceeded to lose the re-roll.
---
I did this to a guildie at Ony for the T2 helm. He rolled a 98 and I followed him with a 99. I felt pretty bad about it but it's all good cause he got one the next week.
---
What PVE server did you roll on and how is it?
---
Ignorant Americans? Hey man, it's our language, if you dont like it go speak something else
---
Your arguments only really hold if youre prot/ fury prot. You can tank dungeons as any spec and arms is really good for 5 mans. 
---
The problems i see on my server is 
---
1. They think they cant tank as a dps spec
---
2.they do dont know the dungeon so they think they cant lead it.
---
3. They dont want the responsibility of tanking.
---
.
---
there is no such thing as honor trading in wpvp. not in vanilla, not in classic, not in retail. that's why there are diminishing returns that last 24 hours.
---
any sort of "trading" in rated BGs and arena is against the rules. in classic this probably extends to queue dodging, but who knows.
---
Afaik the slam thing has to do with spell batching and wasn't part of the original game. The heroic strike bug would've been a better example.
---
why are you gonna block me? tell me why or else i cant improve myself
---
Curious from people in this thread, what are some active alliance PVE realms to roll on?
---
So you think it's more efficient to just farm gold than the actual mats
---
Unpopular opinion: nothing is going to change. Horde are going to find out very quickly that BG ques take too long and go right back to killing 48-59 because it's easier. This game has been fucked since p2 and will stay fucked indefinitely.
---
lul i play on heartstriker GER and i am in a German Guild but i play on en client. Did you even look at the picture?
---
(They don't.)
---
Welche Gilde? :D
---
So then maybe lower server size. I could understand that as a suggestion. Removing honor for all world PVP just destroys the point of a PVP server and doesnt fix anything. Maybe check out a lower pop server.
---
Everyone around here keeps using it so I just figured most people knew. Old School RuneScape.
---
&gt; and then they die to something stupid that a toddler could avoid
---
You see, that mechanic is far beneath their paygrade.
---
Put them in Naxx, and they'll be amazing, you'll see! They're not trying very hard because it's easy. or, the game got lucky. Yeah, that's it.. the game got lucky!
---
Van cleef
---
You're missing /cast before the mod line
---
Yup that’s how it is on Faerlina. All boats are camped by horde and it’s controlled by separate horde guilds of streamers. Either Sodapoppin in Minithril harbor, Advertise when Asmongold is streaming but now seems to be in control of BRM lately, Cdew and others on other boats. &lt;DOGZ&gt; is very notorious too but they all seem to coordinate and decide who gets what boat. 
---
There’s only been a few times since Phase 2 I’ve gotten on the boat in Minithril to Theremore boat with nobody on.... Annnndddd I end up getting ganked in Theremore as soon as I land by a 20 man raid. 
---
The past week has gotten worse though. Now there seems to be a 20 man horde raid in the Ironforge Mystic Ward everytime I log on. Can’t go 5 mins of dueling at the Ironforge gates without a streamer squad (usually Sodapoppin) showing up to try and gank. It’s always the same damn horde players showing up too for one in Ironforge and another for Stormwind or whatever. So this is what leads me to believe they’re coordinating ganking turfs for who gets to farm honor points and where...
---
The horde don't know how to PvP on heartseeker then?
---
Yeah it actually concerns me that a psych major would bungle this so bad. 
---
Is Dylan Roof a not a sociopath? He didn’t murder his own group, just people without his skin color.
---
Now you might say, well he did murder his own group because he killed fellow humans.
---
To that I say: Alliance and Horde are overall in the same group of “fellow WoW players” and the factions are just sublets of that, the same way ethnicities are sublets of the human race. 
---
You need to go back to school Mr. Psych major
---
&gt;Lose with some respect.
---
It's becoming more and more apparent those days are gone. :(
---
&gt; staysafe said from the begging that phase 2 was going to be a shit show
---
Go watch old classicasts. He fought for p2 to happen and never thought it would be a shit show, when he did.
---
I think a lot of people are blaming Blizz for a problem the community created. This is a stark example of it. P2 would have included BGs if folks had let blizz roll it out the way they planned.
---
I’ll totally disagree that this was too early. Even on my smaller server everyone is basically 60, except for extreme casuals and alts. If we don’t get P3 content in a month or two the PvE only people will continue to drop out of boredom. Which they’re factually already doing...
---
&gt;/cast \[nomod:shift\] Siphon Life(Rank 4); 
---
&gt;
---
&gt;/Cast \[mod:shift\] Drain Soul(Rank 2)
---
Try those. If they work, add the soul management part back in. I just took it out for simplicity in troubleshooting.
---
my guild is a bloody mess in raids, we just stand around all over the place, let melee handle the whelps while mages get oneshot by the fireballs. Dont think 90% in the raid knows what a safe spot is. But we've been clearing phase 2 so fast there havent been any deep breaths so far.
---
All of this, doubly so when BGs drop.  Anyone going into a BG as a level 19 twink believing that they’re going to dominate because of there gear is in for a big surprise.  It’s a big chicken and the egg type thing, you need that type of gear because someone else got that type of gear to stand a chance against someone with that type of gear.
---
You may be picking up a little bit too much "tone" from a text message. I wasn't really reading much sarcasm in that.
---
He asks about a reliable "bis" list for warriors, and is answered with something specifically about pre-raid weapons for fury spec. It was a helpful answer for many, I'm sure, but unlikely to answer the questions he had.
---
@Okoisbbroko:
---
I generally trust Icyveins a little more than Wowhead, but when it comes to warrior gear there are a lot of situational factors involved. Weapon-wise, if you're not an orc or human, daggers are amazing because Mugger's Belt exists and doesn't make you sacrifice as many stats as Edgemaster's Handguards do. But if you get access to a really good weapon like Bonereaver's Edge or a Brutality Blade, those Edgemaster's are easily worth their item socket. A simple "bis" list doesn't convey that. Keep in mind a +5 weapon skill bonus is 3% hit and -20% damage penalty on glancing blows.
---
Because of the scarcity of loot in Classic, your choices and priorities are going to change dramatically based on what you get. An absolute BIS list would include Rank 14 and World Boss gear, which you are unlikely to ever attain. And if that BIS list includes other items that complement those gear "choices", then those items should be called into question as well.
---
To make it even more complicated; in classic, you have to make real tradeoffs between survivability, utility and DPS. Your DPS is effectively capped by how much threat output your tank has. Unlike vanilla, many tanks don't/shouldn't spec "deep prot" anymore because they cannot generate the threat needed to keep up with modern DPS.
---
So a modern tank will be dual wielding with some fury/prot spec, and your DPS should be exactly as high as it can be without overaggroing them. If you are consistently outaggroing your maintank, then Lionheart Helm suddenly isn't as glorious as a BIS list will tell you it is. That's something you have to discuss with your raid team, not with a know-it-all on Reddit or any other website.
---
You’re right, except for one thing -
---
A lot of people look up server balances before rolling, I did to find a relatively balanced one.
---
Some, likely a lot, of people looked up, saw Horde was at an advantage and rolled Horde because of it. It’s just a naked, raw advantage. It’s obvious Min/Max logic to do so.
---
And the more people do this, the more people then do this as well - it creates a positive feedback loop.
---
Who would even consider rolling the minority faction at a certain point? 
---
There’s some layer of horde that are different, and are seeking an unbalanced advantage. Likely it’s the same toxic people spamming go to retail, etc...
---
Yeah, the idea that horde are evil and alliance noble is dumb, but there is a real meta effect.
---
that not real transfer. just let u move from dead server to a less dead.
---
Respected the Makgora, rewarded for doing so by the cosmos.
---
Dude wtf are you talking about. I’m not defending /disparaging the honor drama going on right now. I’m literally trying to explain to this guy about why ppl are complaint about the release date of bg’. I don’t understand why that’s not clear from what I wrote. And u have mental issues you need to see a professional about. I don’t give a shit about honor. I’m literally a private.  Couldn’t care less.
---
Edit: I reread your comment. You really need to re read what I wrote cuz you are completely off the mark. Sound crazy dude.
---
I would farm gold, as you get to level 55-56 then you can start to farm them.  Unless you try and see that you can now at your level.  The competition is pretty fierce at level 60 it was hard for me to get the drops but had no problem with the mobs.  Good luck!
---
I mean it's a pvp server. So yes expect pvp. But it's very well balanced and Allies control BRM, EPL, and DM all the time.
---
Thank you! Yeah it’s easier to stick with swords in the short term, I think my late game spec will depend on what items I get to drop. Didn’t realize hemo was only swords pvp, makes sense. Daggers open with ambush most of the time right?
---
No, no they are not.
---
I loved doing this in UO!
---
Notice how all the bellyaching and complaining on this sub is about pvp servers? Roll on a pve server and have a fun time with none of that shit to worry about.
---
that thread aged perfectly...
---
Lacking empathy to your enemies does not make you a sociopath. Some serial killers are probably not sociopaths but it might depend how you define the word.
---
The game world enables me to play out scenario's as a character outside of myself.  I think you guys need to lighten up about people who get a kick out of playing a vicious character in a game. Maybe for some people it's deeper than that, but not for me, I am literally playing a character this way for fun because Real Life is the place where I get to take things so seriously.
---
Sorry for all the edits.
---
Didn’t you guys hear? 
---
You just gotta got gud...
---
&gt; Half of those comments are probably just banter though
---
I should hope so, since I know for a fact that Kor Kron, whose comments are prominently featured in the video are refugees themselves, from Firemaw.
---
Westfall. Been awesome.
---
As a horde player I actually agree, even tho I do enjoy world pvp (probably more then most players) I think they would have to make a change something like that to keep the game playable for everyone and not just the hardcore player base.
---
Benediction. Alliance. Near 50/50, very active and friendly.
---
Message Banksyalt with in game mail, I’ll hook you up with bags and a guild with people actively leveling. Even a few dungeon carries, etc...
---
So many times I've been tanking instead of healing cause there are no tanks available. Or the members just does not want to tank. Playing paladin and you clearly feel the lack of sustain in mana as the biggest problem. 
---
Anyhow, I roll need on healing gear, Even though I'm not specced for it, but it is what I gear towards but cannot always role as to get a party going. Usually I tell everyone before , sometimes I do forget, but have not got into this drama yet.
---
&gt; I'm doing my best to produce as much threat as possible WITHOUT sacrificing a single bit of survivability
---
Except when you spec into damage you increase your survivability because you kill things faster, reduce downtime, and increase your healers effective healing. If you go full deathbone, sword+shield and tell your dps to wait for 3+ sunders in a stratholme run, you're throwing away time for your group. You can do UD strat in 30 under 30 minutes with a ret pally, priest, arms+SS warrior and two randoms who just follow you around.
---
be careful you are talking mainly to boomers here who suck at the game
---
These people don't deserve cross-realm BGs. They should have to sleep in the bed they made.
---
What does he win?
---
Garr adds have lots of NR, so that shield isn't even that great there.
---
Definitely not a good idea. Free fac transfer for overpop was one of the biggest factors in faction imbalance.
---
Just respawn in the town, man. It's 5 feet from the graveyard.
---
Venture was one of the ally guilds who got to 60 real fast on Flamelash, and proceeded to camp the fucking bejesus out of anyone lower level than them.  
---
Me and my friends got ganked for hours on end by mostly Venture lads and thus they brought most of the Horde against them, ending in the Horde absolutely farming the shit out of the Alliance and Flamelash exploded.  
---
I am not saying that it was only Venture, there were some other ally guilds, but Venture was a name that popped up a lot. Keep in mind that most of that guild were from pservers.  
---
When they transferred to Earthshaker, I transferred after them as I will just gank the shit out of anyone with that name.  
---
I've had plenty of nice 1v1's against other ES'ers thus far, waved at some lowbies, helped them with quests, seems like a nice place.
---
thanks, i appreciate
---
see what you're doing blizzard?! 
---
ppl are killing innocent animals! and all because you didnt release tht blasted key ring! 
---
IF ONLY U WOULD RELEASE THAT THIS POOR BROWN KODO WOULD HAVE STILL BEEN aLiVe TODAY!
---
i hope you're happy now!
---
Omen of clarity is in the balance tree for a reason right? Melee Boomkin is the way they were meant to be played
---
Sure Kapp
---
g o T o RE T a IL
---
Paid transfers were hardly the thing that destroyed retail, stop being dramatic.
---
thank u this is very helpful
---
The padres trousers from DM are a million times better.
---
Manastorm leggings are pretty terrible for Druid’s since you want to stack + healing.
---
Also no idea why a moonkin would want them since MP5 is not good at all for DPS.
---
for my 5-box, I "roll" 3 times (main, 2/3, and 4/5)
---
Our guilds loot system isn't roll based, but functionally similar.
---
Dude its way too late to lower server size now. People dont wanna wake up to 2k queues again, but this time also having their 60 and their guild mates on that server
---
Vo-Illidan has been my main's name on retail since 2006 so I think I have you beat homie
---
This is extra funny to me because I literally just finished a paper about overfishing and no joke cited this exact same article.
---
Ulduar is my favorite dungeon of all time. I was totally on top of that during WotlK. I joined 2 or 3 timewalking groups for it, and it was a mess. I was happy to explain everything, but no one even cared. 5mans give better loot, so it was more like an activity for bored people than a real challenge.
---
\**looks at all the useless quest items I keep in my bank*\*
---
PvP happened on a PvP server. Who could've seen that coming huh? /s
---
I'm a gnome warrior, so i feel you.  A suggestion is to farm the Expert GoldMiner's Helm. It's really cheap on the AH sometimes, and it's basically a 15g Edgemasters.
---
Bungle this so badly*
---
Adverb form, not adjective. It’s HOW he bungled it.
---
1000g?? On my server I got them for 270. I can’t believe how different the prices on servers can be.
---
Yeah only option left is to change every ability to  a /hug while targeting opposing faction.
---
I forgot to include Revenge. Just use that every time it is up.
---
That's a good tactic coming from the horde perspective. Alliance move along because camping simply isn't efficient for farming honor. But being horde, you don't get to experience how bloodthirsty your faction often is in the same situation.
---
well...
---
its  **#nochanges** only when it convenient for us!
---
probably blizzard
---
Don't believe the hype just because it sounds good guys. 
---
I have 250 hours on this server and it is my only toon. Yes there is no IF and SW camping but you are going to get mercilessly ganked while questing by skulls just like every other server.
---
Do you get corpse camped? Yeah, sometimes. I've also had quite a few skulls not bother me, but I've had 3 times as many fuck me up for no reason.
---
If we truly contest choke points as people are saying, it sure as fuck isn't in areas you will see until you are 50+ 
---
Ask yourself a few questions, do you like being killed in Menethil Harbor? Do you like not being able to use the boat for 8 hours straight due to a full party camping on it all day long? Do you like dying to Horde camping the entrance to all instances like SM, RFD, Ulda and ZF as you grind through 30-50?
---
If you are good with those things, come on over to Benediction.
---
The praise I've been seeing for this server on reddit the last few days is honestly not a shared experience for most, so I would like to have what they are having.
---
&gt;cast \[nomod:shift\] Siphon Life(Rank 4);  
---
&gt;  
---
It worked!!! you are a legend tysm
---
Doesn't make you less of a prick.
---
Secret to warrior chill: be fury prot. Do whatever you want. Do dungeons just with guildies or if the price is right. Murder everything you see. Big parses when you raid.
---
Something something JOJO reference.
---
All classic PvE content can be cleared by 40-man full meme raids, if they tryhard with consumables, perfect their rotations and apply their brains to develop a working tactics.
---
Oh I have plenty of cringe in my inbox about “acktchewally they didn’t win any war by just killing own their server blah blah blah”
---
\^ I suppose I'd be mad if my mom was a fat meth ass mom that sucked nuts too :(
---
cause very few people like tanking.
---
we've been over this on retail. 15 years later, with 6 tanking classes and episode where some of them were so OP they could solo 3 players at once ( legion tanks)... still had a tanking shortage.
---
Classic just make the problem worse as there's a very limited amount of PvE'ing to do after your weekly raid... and they are still not desired for PvP.
---
Ditto
---
I’m on Benediction as alliance, Mannly is the name. Server feels very balanced, glad I lucked out with a good server.
---
Best thing that I saw on this was making the spirit healers a safe spot. That way you could take the rez and get out.
---
The town that's camped by 10+ horde at all times?
---
Guildie just paid 1800g for them on my server
---
Did blizz force you to roll on a PvP server? You got exactly what you asked for. 🤷‍♂️
---
Everyone who doesn't like pvp, please play on a PVE server instead. It's not that hard
---
I'm saying it's kind of a waste to spend money on res sickness when the graveyard is so close to the town. You can respawn inside a building and safely hearth if you have to. In my experience at least.
---
I mean the priest dire maul trinket is way better than briarwood reed and the book is only like 3g on my server. I also forgot to mention he had second wind as well, which is also better than reed. So yeah I’d have preferred for him to have spent the 3g to get the better healing item so I could’ve gotten my pre-bis.
---
PvE matters too to a lot of players
---
That’s not what “apparently” means?
---
This is extra sub money and Blizzard doesn’t care
---
tragedy of the commons
---
35
---
Is there a reason for it?
---
Almost all of the spell/item/upgrade/research icons in wc3 were reused in wow.

---
I'm playing horde on an alliance dominated server... I am also having fun... 
---
There are so many fucking cry babies on reddit that play alliance... It's nice to see someone playing alliance who is actually having fun, even though they are "technically" outnumbered...
---
My server was 58% alliance last I checked yesterday, 12/6...
---
Guess what... I still get my 100 HKs every day.
---
Cheers to you for not being a pansy.
---
This statement sums up the current state of social media.
---
“You think you do, but you don't” 🤷‍♂️
---
But do they IP ban? I’ve seen when people get banned, they still have access to their other account. And can’t they just use proxies to avoid that all together? Besides, yea it is their game and they can decide what they wanna do but can they really prove they’re using that account for those reasons?
---
Better racials
---
our MT got the second binding last week and is getting setup as well.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
we're very excited!
---
I see. Thanks
---
That's one of the many reasons I loved Star Wars Galaxies, you could set up a house and vendor npcs and make yourself a shop. Mine were never very elaborate but it there were many very nicely decorated ones that I came across.
---
Okay, I’m alliance on kirtonos. It’s a great server but I also wanted to try out a shaman on a server that isn’t overwhelmingly horde dominated. Incendius seems like a good choice... plus I have a lot of great names reserved there lol
---
The 10th but yes soon
---
Horde is not even the better choice unless you want to camp Menethil boat as a rogue 24/7. In a week this sub will be full of "OMG PALADINS ARE UNKILLABLE HEALERS WITH OP STUFF WTF BLIZZ PLZ NERF"
---
any lvl 60s in rattlegore that can help me with tremors of the earth, ill pay 3g to each person that can help me
---
Sounds dumb af
---
I’m thinking yes. I made a point to discover stone talon,, barren, Ashe vale, thousand needles (gadget for shimmering flats FP)
---
and he's part of the problem, people are mocking him *because he's part of the problem and whining about it*
---
If you can't be safe in your own capital city without 30 people acting as spooky death squads then you don't get to whine when those people stop turning up.
---
Doesn't matter if the system jerks you off while giving you a rimjob that'd make a porn star blush, if your actions are causing other players to leave then you don't get to whine on the official forums or act flummoxed when for an entire faction, the best option is not to play.
---
Desolace: in the water west of the village, bots are farming the traps for the gold farm
---
i think that's recently because last week riding into chillwind/lights hope I was met with 15-30 whorde that go into stealth right before my arrival lol.
---
Who cares if they are 60? Boohoo you're leveling and cant turn in quests. You knew damn well what could potentially happen rolling on a pvp server regardless of numbers. Even on a 50/50 split server (if there is one) you're still gonna have to worry about a random horde mob squad running through your questing area what if all the 60s are busy raiding? Will you cry in trade because noone wants to come help you?
---
Why else would you play nightelves?
---
On pservers warlocks did pretty well. Big problem was really threat gen and the inability to dump aggro.
---
As a mage I see this drop pretty much every run... every melee I talk to has pretty much never seen it
---
C L A S S I C
---
I've heard the same BS a couple weeks ago on Bloodseeker. Now Flamelash refugees have arrived, server is 55/45 in our favor and where are those "git gut" pro hordes? Hiding in friggin Orgrimmar, that's where they are.
---
Is the Bread Vendor in on this?   If not im not sure how collusion applies. Define Collusion :: noun
---
secret or illegal cooperation or conspiracy, especially in order to cheat or deceive others.
---
Ill tell you what though if that dirty bread vendor is colluding with the horde she needs to be fired!
---
Been playing on this server since release, am Horde, and like 20 alliance spent the day at the Undercity elevator while a gang of lvl 19 hunter twinks were teabagging my alt in Hillsbrad. It does not 'feel' very horde dominated at 60 and the alliance definitely have spunk, I think everyone would be happy if they got some more numbers.
---
A discord picture of said alliance chilling at UC
---
https://imgur.com/CKKk8Dx
---
Oh look, a grown ass man acting like a kid on stream. Sure haven’t seen that one before.
---
Why do these idiots always have the same personalities?
---
Blood elves were also busted with their racials and OP racial paladin seal.
---
For real.
---
This is inaccurate.
---
We'd bring at least 3 of our mates.
---
From reading their discord and the wow forum complaints I actually feel that horde are not at fault here. 
---
It honestly sounds like when classic first released, a few alliance guys got to 60 first and started griefing horde players. This started resentment from the horde which started a vicious cycle such that the server is in all out war by the time honor system lands with no mercy for greys or the honorless. I certainly feel there is a much more hostile attitude in the flamelash discord than for example my server (stonespine) despite alliance being 40:60 outnumbeter there as well.
---
Then a few days ago one of the big guilds started talks on transferring. Due to an oversight or something they didnt even try to keep it a secret, which caused a literal bank run by the alliance guilds who didnt want to stay on an outnumbered and very hostile server. One guild became two, two became four and four became every guild bar one, &lt;Everyday Heroes&gt;, who waited until 3 hours before the deadline before they realised that there was no point staying in a dead server and xferred off.
---
All this happened in a span of 2 days, so the people who were away were left behind and couldn't xfer. They've now created a guild called &lt;Leftovers&gt; and their guild chat is essentially alliance world chat.
---
This is all incredibly interesting to me and I feel like it could be a great study for sociologists. The server transfer run feels like the [green eyed dragon puzzle](http://mathpuzzlewiki.com/index.php/Green_eyed_dragons), where all the guilds know that they are outnumbered, and that they can transfer off, but it took the extra information of one guild saying they're thinking of transferring off to cause a huge panic that results in a dead server 3 days later.
---
Like I said, no one gives a fuck what your excuse is.
---
the thing is that with prebis you're pretty much already gated by threat, all some rag/ony weapons do for warriors is make them wait longer or pull aggro quicker
---
 there is no aggro reset
---
no? unless its 48 and above then yea, they give honor.
---
But they ARE the opposite faction lol
---
TBC is for sure going to happen. Only Classic+ shills will tell you otherwise.
---
2% extra hits plus 2% chance on every bloodthirst, ww, sunder, execute, etc.  Extra hits are extra rage = more damage.
---
You dont go arms for raids. You go fury for 2H aswell
---
Pally bis
---
We just sacrifice our gnome mage to her in Phase 1.  He runs in front of her breath.  That completely satisfies her for the rest of the raid.
---
Just make your sacrifices people.
---
Actually yes. pVE servers where full day 1
---
How do i collude with myself?   I can decide to maybe break the rules or cheat but the word your using does not apply to the situation your describing.    Now if its an alliance player who is chatting with the horde player and has agreed to keep the bread vendor busy then that would be collusion.
---
mqg and the troll racial? care to elaborate a bit more? thank you dude!
---
Her bread was always undercooked anyway! ta hell with her.

Max concurrent for one faction I've ever seen on any modern census addon is actually 3.5k, do you have a source for "many times 3k"? Also, the original WoW devs said the max concurrent population cap was 4k (you got a source for 3k?)
---
I think he's just memeing haha
---
And that's how you're should play an open world pvp game
---
Huh I think I might do this
---
If you RPed you could just make the expansions a crazy dream he had.
---
Fixed it for you:
---
1. Mage with ignite
---
2. Warrior
---
3. Warlock
---
4. Mage 
---
5. Rogue
---
Duality of a man
---
There is. It's called soulstone.
---
Lol at a pserver guild fucking themselves this badly
---
Sure, the point is to try something instead of crying on reddit. Most of my experiences with campers etc is they camp whatever they camping. You don’t need to get far to move on.
---
Yeah but Id prefer to stay arms so I don’t have to respec for pvp.
---
If you're horde, just get engineering and mining.  You'll likely sit in queues for a bit and mining + fishing will be things you can easily do to pass time when nobody wants to duel
---
Yeah, randomly tank wil get more threat because windfury. Another time, a couple DPS warriors randomly pull threat and die, because windfury.\\
---
Windfury is inconsistent and unreliable. And praying to RNGesus isn't really a strategy.
---
Bgs drop in a few days. Why cant you just get a life until then?
---
Why would you delete your old mount?
---
Of course. My hypothesis is that the two factions are just an arbitrary split of a homogenous group of gamers and as such we all behave the same (group-wise) independently on the faction we play. 
---
This means that any difference in play style comes down to other factors, such as: “are you part of the dominant (most populated) faction?”
---
I can probably be convinced that there might have been made a social difference in _how_ the gamers act after a segregation of 15 years. I wish it was possible to find research on this.
---
95% chance of TBC happening. 50% for LK depending how Classic and TBC hold up over the years.
---
I suspect TBC will be opt-in, so that players who wish to keep playing Classic can do so. But most servers will be dead by then, so Blizzard will probably merge all remaining Classic servers.
---
They will probably open up a handful of new Classic servers that follow the 6 phases, but interest in those will probably be quite low at that point.
---
Because there is a whole lot more disorganized pvp than there is organized. The portion of people who will benefit from the superior organized pvp potential of alliance is like the top 10% of players at best, 5% realistically, IMO. For duels and solo pvp and random pugs, yes, horde are better for sure, and that is 95% of all pvp.
---
So you would not allow ret pallies or boomkins then, according to your philosophy? Not saying anything is wrong with that, but it’s not casual friendly.
---
Yup. My guild makes all our warrs just do big dick damage and pull out a shield if they grab threat and run to the center
---
Add-ons and macros were even more OP during vanilla.
---
Vanilla was one of the first games for most people, the average PC was bad, the average internet, was bad. Servers were worse. The average player wasnt as good.
---
Link?
---
Noob here, why so many arcanite is needed for phase 3?
---
They may have been but add ons weren’t nearly as prevalent pre 1.6.
---
idk bro you tell me
---
Which is exactly what I told you to do...
---
You can send mats through the neutral AH, so they should be able to manage.
---
Im horde on incendius and there is no way were are dominate alliance controls dm and lhc all day ever day, roaming bands of alliance in most popular zones.  With this comment im starting to feel like like all these posts on faction balance arent truthful ... there is absolutely no way horde is dominant on this server id say its 60/40 for alliance pvp wise
---
No, but a certain type of person may be more likely to roll the faction with better pvp racials and transportation.

You’re trash

Yeah, that's what I said. Yikes

You think a mere 3 corpse runs is anywhere close to what the alliance deals with. Really telling of the people who spout "both sides are the same."

That’s how it’s been for the alliance since P2 was released, brm was camped by horde non-stop. It’s nice to see the tables turned.

Ally have high honour requirements for brackets, since there are more horde they can kill. (On horde dominated servers)

My opinion is pretty simple: if you don't want meme specs to roll on gear, don't invite them to the raid. If they come because you need them, they deserve to roll

I do this as well for my Gold farm. I honestly don’t see a lot of people doing it. But it’s nice to help avoid the death balls in WpVp
---
Feedback loop.
---
Anyone who was afraid to be outnumbered saw horde had a slight advantage and it just snowballed.
---
As a horde on Benediction, I wholeheartedly agree. Alliance stomped me hard at Light's Hope Chapel, then kargath, then WPL today and it felt like the kind of panicky fun good WPVP creates. We got back at em a bit later. It's always back and forth, never totally one-sided for long. 
---
Thx for keeping us balanced!

Uh, yeah. The legion client disabled a number of the functions available in vanilla. This is common knowledge.

---
&gt; just looking to do decently in MC, not necessarily blow people out the water, and satisfy my guildies
---
If that's your goal, you could almost walk into MC naked and still meet the goal. I'm being facetious, but my point is that a combat Rogue, even daggers, has no trouble being "good enough."
---
Your current gear is fine. Some quick notes:
---
- at 305 weapon skill you need 6% hit to be capped on yellow attacks. The next breakpoint i personally like hitting is 308, because of a massive reduction in glancing blow penalty. I believe it goes from 15% at 305 to 5% penalty at 308.
---
- 6% at 305 is for yellow hits. The hit cap on white hits is something like 24% while dual wielding. It's asinine and realistically unachievable. Don't worry about it. 
---
- At 300 weapon skill, yellow hit cap is 9%.
---
- Do not add weapon skill (ex: your +6 on Distracting Dagger) to your hit percentage. In terms of miss chance, it only lowers your hit% requirement. So the only hit percentage you should be adding are gear that specifically says "increased chance to hit" or whatever the verbiage is, as well as the talent "Precision." If you have 5/5 in Precision, which you should, then you have 11% hit, if I am understanding your gear correctly, and 311 dagger skill. 
---
- 6pc Shadowcraft is a good set bonus, certainly, but i personally choose to not rely on it. My reasoning is that you will most likely break the set bonus very quickly after entering MC. I have been raiding three weeks now and have 4 pieces of Nightslayer. For my own pre-raid gearing, i actually disregarded all pre-bis lists, and essentially made my own. Because DM was released before i started raiding, i made a build based around Distracting Dagger. I had 309 weapon skill, had around 7% hit, and fully raid buffed had like 34% crit. This was before i had any pieces from MC. I wasn't the highest Rogue on the damage meters, but I was usually 2nd or 3rd (we have 6 Rogues and the others had all been raiding for awhile when i joined the team, so they all had raid gear).
---
My only point with the above is don't worry about following someone's else's gear list. Think about your gearing, play with different sets, compare things, and come to a conclusion on your own.
---
Tell that to my fat G stack, i'm the king of rolls.
---
Alliance getting the horde worldbuffs to be precise. They are going out of hteir way to roll 40 horde priests to buff their raid.
---
I can also eat shit but I dont

I'm aware. If they had a choice they wouldn't be subservient to the orcs. The raving green genocidal maniac slavedrivers. Well, you know, besides goblins.

You should let them know that fire ward is a thing.

5 minutes? On my friend's server there's a warrior camping thorium point literally every waking hour since p2 launched. He got killed 3 times, logged off, went to work, came back, warrior was still there. Went to sleep, came back, still there. He was there the whole weekend too.

---
Yeah, and meanwhile alliance are getting 5 minutes in without getting ganked at best, and horde has the nerve to suggest things are equivalent.
---
And, they are going above and beyond to get on a level playing field buff wise. And look what happens when they do. They dominate.

I feel ya, ganked I’m that town for days by allied.
---
It has around 4000 alliance on at peak, so more than a vanilla server would have had in total; but all playing the same faction. Too packed for me, just doesn't feel right.
---
I mean classic is going that way it seems lol
---
Just create a disincentive to being horde to counter the incentive of a faction imbalance.
---
Cut off the top 3% of PvP ranks per 1% past 55% if pop. Why should a side with a 2:1 handicap even be able to have a High Warlord?

Toss on a % nerf to all drops and open cross faction transfers until 50/50. Would fix itself over night.
---
&gt; w8ing 
---
... **why?**
---
&gt;Horde typically have a bit of population lead over the Alliance on PVP servers
---
30-70% more players is not a bit. I've seen people here claiming that "40-60 is fairly balanced". Imagine if WSG was 10v15 and AB 15v22. That's your "a bit" of population lead.
---
I have mastered the subtle nuances of running around pillars in travel form until the enemy gives up in frustration and lets me freely heal my warrior. TBC was a deep and complex game that these noobs can't even begin to comprehend.
---
Buddy, you’re missing the point. You’re playing glorified turtles in time... It’s against computer AI...

You’re essentially a Super Mario Bro’s speed runner talking down from some high horse for whatever weird reason.
---
So making toxic ass comments like "Glancing reduction is very important, but maybe the furies in your guild are just bad so it doesn’t matter. " when it literally doesn't matter because the dungeon can still be cleared if ZERO people have any +weapon skill.
---
Not to mention, raids can only be cleared once a week, therefore a guild who clears in an hour vs 10 is making the exact same progress.
---
Get a grip you dingus.

When I was editing the video, my friends told me to make sure there are tons of zoom effects and dubstep or the younger watchers would get bored.

---
&gt; All these people making 19 twinks need to realize that 9/10 of the enemies are also twinks. No noobstomping available.
---
That was never, ever how it was in retail.
---
It might be that way in Classic, in which case (a) I will laugh my arse off and (b) the twinkers will almost all quit. Because we know the overwhelming majority are specifically doing it so they can have an unfair fight.
---
Speaking from experience, yes, it's about 10g an hour with a couple of other people (one being a bot) doing the same thing. It's how I got the remaining 20g for my priest's mount. I'm certain about the time as I used a couple of pots (1 hour each) so I didn't need to worry about air. This wasn't at maximum efficiency though as I took a break for a good 10-15 minutes at one point.
---
You don't need that much gear.
---
Premades are going to be smoking hordes in 3 minutes flat. (And will dodge all games against other premades.)

---
Cooperation actually isn't illegal. It's planning to cooperate outside of the game or via some other channel that becomes collusion and is illegal. 
---
For instance if you see someone of the opposing faction getting blocked from entering an instance by pvp, you can mind control them and help them in. Similarly you can help them in the open world (like to kill a devilsaur) and  it isn't against the ToS as long as you neither talked outside of the game nor used a translator in the game. It should be noted that using emotes (at least the ones that don't get translated to weird hand gestures) to communicate in game are 100% within the terms of service and you are allowed to use them to work with the opposite faction.
---
Everything you're saying is pretty much the opposite of what actually goes on.  I'm starting to believe you actually think what you are saying is true.  If you play on Skeram I am sorry you are not having a good time, but the majority of us are.  I am currently in the middle of farming the dumb horde in IF with 80 other people at 1am.  It's hilarious how bad they are.  If you are having issues plugging perhaps you should learn how to lead a group.  I have absolutely zero issues running any instance whenever I want.  Shit my alt plugged mc in like week 4 and killed rag.  There are also a few gdkp runs that happen every week that kill rag and ony.
---
Never
---
If you're talking about APES/NOPE that's funny because they've long acknowledged that Horde has the edge in premades. They just prefer the underdog faction which is also why they're Alliance now.
---
There's a guy who used to play with them on pservers in the subreddit discord (he's submitted screenshots as proof) who you can talk to.
---
Ehh. With how imbalanced Vanilla is and that there’s no nerfs coming I was pretty sure this situation was gonna happen. It has nothing to do with the community and entirely has everything to do with the way WoW handles PvP. The second horde gets a majority even if minor it will spin out of control due to the fact that Horde have a racial advantage and at that point, numbers advantage. So the people who don’t care to fight over everything (like those on retail who bitched and moaned about Sargeras and Illidan having to phase and fight other servers) will bitch and moan and leave once they become outnumbered. Because that’s not what they want. They either wanna be able to randomly join a gank squad, or decide while walking around they wanna fight someone. They don’t wanna go out into the world and have to expect a fight in every zone. So then only the PvP server efficianados are left. But their raid scene just got a hit. So it’s gonna be harder for them to get gear to keep up with the horde PvPers since as a faction less gear is being spawned. Then rep gets around and new recruits dry up. So then for gear and PvP it becomes the pvpers best option to jump to a more balanced server or one in their factions favor. Repeating it all over again. Till you get several Illidans. Phasing does alleviate this issue a lot. But on retail Horde racials were left unchecked for so long that everyone just ended up going Horde for hardcore everything. Kinda making it moot. And Vanilla wise, the only things stopping it from getting that bad are Paladins and that the Horde has no good looking Humanoid race like Blood Elves and Zandalari.
---
You should see the horde threads on heartseeker, salt mine
---
You're slow on the uptake, but I guess a lot of twinkers are probably people who really struggle to succeed in any other area of WoW.
---
I've been the guy with better gear. It's fun, for the guy with better gear. But it's bad for the game. And if you have the emotional maturity of a reasonably developed pre-schooler you can grasp the concept of "good for me but not good for everyone else". The fact that twinkers can't grasp it at all says a lot about them.
---
Yup same here but it's just too much now. Back in vanilla I was still young and had very little going on. 30 minutes of corpsewalking was no big deal but fast forward over a decade and I've got maybe 6-8 hours a week to play. It just wasnt feasible anymore, and it's a shame since I love the game. Maybe in 12 years when they do WoW Classic *Classic* they'll nail it.
---
20$ days this guy is using a scuffed DPS meter instead of looking at logs.
---
He’s not the problem. 
---
The problem is the shitheads corpse camping people 6+ times and calling out alliance locations in world to body farm level 50’s attempting to finish leveling. Not to mention blizzard devs for allowing transfers off for alliance to begin with.
---
Your numbers are way off. Warriors in the 99 percentile aren't even getting 900 dps. The median warrior does about 260.

Should have rolled pve to begin with
---
You are exactly the best type of WoW player. Thank you for your service, OP.
---
The pve servers do
---
I’m on a pretty low pop pve server and it’s fantastic. You see plenty of people running around the open world but every resource node isn’t camped and you can farm pretty effectively. 
---
Lots of pugs running dungeons, pug raids, etc. 
---
If anything, the pop feels like what it was in vanilla days. If the AH is anything to go by, my last auctioneer scan was for about 12000 auctions. 
---
For what’s it’s worth, I’m on remulos (oceanic)
---
You should do split raids then.
---
99% of the time the issue I see are DPS starting before tanks reach the boss. Not even “not waiting for a second for threat”, literally going absolutely nuts while they tank runs in. 
---
It’s so pointless and unnecessary yet I see it all the time. Literally 2 seconds is all that’s needed. Hell often not even that long... they still don’t wait.
---
Our tanks let them die then taunt them off the healers.
---
I think that was either BC or wrath, so theyll prob have to wait a while. 
---
Certainly no hope of getting 'first'
---
Lvl 43 rogues arent hanging in Everlook so your just spewing a bunch of stuff you havent been to. I mean wut.

Blablabla, both factions got good stuff and less good stuff, deal with it
---
Are we the baddies?
---
Likely just means you are burning her down in phase 2 fast enough that there just isn't a high chance of it happening.
---
Its more like contract assassinations
---
I hope they don't.  Reap what you sow.  Give the remaining alliance another chance to transfer off, tell them well ahead of time.
---
My guild takes forever to bring her down but in our 3 attempts a few days ago, she never deep breathed, and everyone was always spread out in the right areas.
---
With private servers fury tanks became a thing and their threat generation is thru the roof bananas. Threat became a non issues and all dps can go balls to the wall from first gcd and still not come close to pulling aggro. Private server tank Sceto for example will be double the next person on threat.
---
Gotta be a personality trait that rolls alliance.
---
If you just want the max rank, you can remove the “(rank X)”. 
---
Also, if you happen to do something before what you want iconed you can manually alter #showtooltip. 
---
A simple (and dumb) example:
---
#showtooltip [nomod] drain soul; life tap
---
/cast [nomod] life tap; drain soul
---
Good for multiple casts if you want to cast an instant spell before your main spell, like a warrior changing stance before casting his spell and want to see the icon of the actual spell and not stance.
---
Warrior was my first too and I didn't get the "this is so hard" until I rolled a warlock next. A lot of classes are faceroll but warr is challenging. I wouldn't necessary call it hard though.
---
That said when leveling a few good tips.
---
Try to get a blue weapon, the lower level ones have gotten pretty cheap now. Always have a health potion if you can afford it. Fear roar+bandage is another good trick. Always use demoar roar as your first skill after charging it will reduce the damage you take by 1/3-1/4. You can level fury or arms and still tank fine while your leveling just keep a 1h and shield just in case.
---
“ but quite clear that the priest is a selfish douchebag.”
---
Lol jumping to conclusions a bit? I understand your point is valid, but your last statement completely undermines that. This one sided anecdote from someone who lost out on loot is hardly enough information to determine that. At the end of the day if you join a pug and don’t set ground rules, you should have no expectations about random strangers on the internet.
---
We need more cake pictures, you might be able to fill that content void instead
---
Also, mechanics are easy when they're known. A significant portion of the difficulty in Vanilla was learning how the fights worked while they were murdering your raid.
---
Yeah, warrior is THE most gear dependent class. It could be frustrating at lower level.
---
There were plenty of PvP on Benediction in front of SM/ZF well before phase 2. And Menethil Harbor camping is a problem (naming and shaming Ouro and his buddies for camping the docks 8hrs this past Friday. Every time he gets killed he complains it's "spawn-camping" and "toxic" despite the Alliance groups moving on immediately) because having a major transport route located in contested territory with under-leveled guards is a fundamental design flaw and players shouldn't expect to do the guards' job on the docks 24/7. Alliance on almost every PvP server have this problem.
---
First 2 weeks of phase 2 on Benediction was awful, but lately it's beginning to improve. In 2 days the situation should become even better as BGs suck up a large chunk of PvP-oriented players.
---
You want to get Hit cap&gt;310 weapon skill&gt;Crit Cap&gt;more Hit%
---
Fights like Ragnaros, you will see a much larger DPS gain from using more hit% gear since the fight is 2-3 mins long
---
Fights that last 30 seconds to 1 minute you want more AP/Crit
---
60 rogue with 10% hit including talents, 310 weapon skill, your crit cap will be around 34.8%. Once you reach that, you can safely start stacking more hit%
---
It's nutty for pvp (I'm a mage, so take with grain of salt)
---
That was us.
---
Right now it’s Mc and ony. Eventually it will be all the raids bfa etc. my personal goal is to see as much content I can with my friends. Then if they quit we hit the brick wall in aq and naxx I’ll just have fun. That’s my endgame. All the other questions you asked aren’t relevant until the developer brings them up yes I have my personal oppinions but I’m not sure what I want is what they will do so I’ll enjoy what I do have available.

Horde seems to have more grit. Stop saying “toxic” because it doesn’t really mean anything and was essentially made up by people who write click bait articles. Here you go: 
---
Grit in psychology is a positive, non-cognitive trait based on an individual's perseverance of effort combined with the passion for a particular long-term goal or end state (a powerful motivation to achieve an objective). This perseverance of effort promotes the overcoming of obstacles or challenges that lie on the path to accomplishment and serves as a driving force in achievement realization. Distinct but commonly associated concepts within the field of psychology include "perseverance", "hardiness", "resilience", "ambition", "need for achievement" and "conscientiousness".
---
???
---
in vanilla you could dispell every single debuff in the 40 man raid with 1 button because addons like decursive auto targeted players
---
addon functionality was 10 times more broken than now
---
It might appear that way if you have a very simple mind and can’t process more than one factor at a time.
---
You chose alliance, you chose death.
---
That ain’t classic armor
---
I don't have anything like that, if you find something let me know. But I have Item Rack, which when I hover over my resist set, it will tell me what's missing from my inventory. Still annoying
---
These words are all relative to level of analysis, but my meaning is that people have in-groups and out-groups. Us and them. When the out-group is seen as an enemy, such as in times of war, what would be unimaginable to do to your in-group is suddenly acceptable - so long as it's done to the enemy. 
---
Whether you use empathy or another word to describe the bonds that keep you from doing this stuff to the in-group isn't super relevant. In psychology an inability to recognize these distinctions is usually termed sociopathy or psychopathy. It is correlated with certain brain activity where you fail to make emotional connections when watching the suffering of others.
---
My point is that's different than turning off those connections through out-grouping mechanisms.
---
Yeah threat becomes an issue but If you have a good dual wield fury/prot tank then it's doable, but otherwise yeah you might have to call for mages to stop casting for a few sec to drop it and start over. There's a lot of different strategies to increase/decrease your odds of keeping ignite up, so each raid will just have to find what works for them. But keeping one thicc ignite up for the whole bossfight is the best DPS overall, it's just hard to manage both the threat and the RNG.
---
Ive ran uldaman at least 15 times never saw anything but the ring from that guy lol.
---
Same as in Vanilla. How is this different?
---
That is why they converted most servers to PvE later.
---
those people are pussies and would prefer an easy mode leveling experience like a warlock or hunter. A warrior is way more challenging, but also way more rewarding. I'm level 53 and am having a blast.
---
SO much this. I regularly have people using health pots (not stones.) in duels. its amazing how much the community has changed, and if you dare speak out about it, you are triggered.. or some other catchy 2019 buzzword.
---
Impossible to answer tbh. Maybe everyone who wants to reign already has one. Maybe you can flip each one for 300g. Depends on the people on your server not reddit.
---
What you need is an orange mocha frappuccino!
---
There is merit, if you are just soloing, to instead maxing improved charge and deflection, then going back and respeccing later to pick it up. You really don't need to preserve rage stance swapping, and frankly, even in pvp, I don't think you stand a chance pre intercept in almost any fight anyways. 
---
That said, in dungeons, you will often get saddled with casters who blow their mana pool every fight, and then screw around picking herbs and looting mobs instead of manaing up again promptly and just doing that shit while you are in combat. It is almost impossible in rando pickup groups to keep any rage banked, at all, without anger management. It is very hard to tank when you have to go into every fight completely dry.
---
That said, if you are in a good melee only cleave group, imp charge is still in my opinion better than  anger management.

At level 36, you will start genuinely needing tactical mastery, as whirlwind is worth using, but just running around in berserker stance all the time is silly, as you take way more damage, and cannot charge. 
---
And of course, once you get intercept, you are completely unable to pvp without tactical mastery, as how the hell are you going to intercept and disarm and hamstring and so on if you can't swap stances and maintain some rage?
---
Also, if you’re dead inside a dungeon you don’t get XP. Just make sure you’re close enough to qualify for the loot when it drops.
---
Im a 60 ally on kurinnaxx. It is almost certainly horde dominated in wpvp, and probably around 55/45 in favor of the horde overall. But the alliance do a decent job of fighting back, especially recently. I wish you the best, but I promise you as someone who leveled 52-60 right at the start of phase 2, it is hard whether you are alliance or horde. Everyone wants that easy honor.
---
I wonder if there’s anything corporate can do to drive intender traffic.
---
My point is Blizzard doesn't treat their customers like sheep. So when people overcrowded servers, Blizzard asked them not to. When they overcrowded it anyway, Blizzard offered a transfer. Those who still decided to stay forfeited their right to expect any of their complaints about overpopulation to be taken seriously. What's your own server?
---
It took you 4 days for more bullshit?
---
Just a casual 7 hours of PvP grinding a day.
---
Fucking. lol.
---
yes because DPS warriors still routinely switch between battle stance and berserker stance. Tanks switch between all 3. Anytime there is switching, tactical mastery is useful. 
---
early on, you only benefit from it when tanking dungeons (charge in battle stance-&gt;defensive stance). Later, you would go charge -&gt; berserker stance (zerker rage, WW) --&gt; defensive stance so it becomes even more useful.
---
Heartseeker was  alright then Transfers happened...
---
i guess we'll never know LOL
---
&gt; What is with this sick fascination about how shitty things are?
---
Because it's cool and it's not happening to me? These types of events are amazing to read up on, like the big wars in Eve Online.
---
Is this a /s thread?
---
Uh it must have since you deleted the post?
---
I’ve found Bigglesworth to be somewhat balanced. Overall it’s like 43A/57H characters but still not awful compared to what I’m reading on here. 
---
I started a new toon when P2 launched though and just got it to 40 so my perspective could be skewed.
---
Maybe controversial, but I say 'dont be a pussy.' the hardest class I face in 1v1 pvp is a good druid. That could be you! Hit 60 and wreck people like me
---
It's kind of the beauty of classic. In a world of snowflake-gameplay and overprotected / pandered-to players, here's a game where you actually have impact enough on each others experiences that actual bad stuff can happen. Yeah it sucks, but that's what creates some of the best stories down the road.
---
I didn't add flair, bot did
---
You're going to feel real silly in like 6 years when you need to rebuy it for 8g to get an achievement.
---
Mail armor that has str/stm is best for leveling, followed by stm/spi and str/Spi. Spi is the secret to warr soloing without needing to sit a lot.
---
lmaooo u scared
---
Should have stayed deleted.
---
thanks man! I am trying to get it better so every bit helps. Thanks so much!
---
haha hey man, get on the Love Train
---
Why are you being a jerk?
---
There are going to be cross-realm BGs. So Horde's probably still gonna have a queue because of some other 30/70 server.
---
Ok thank you for your reply
---
if ur gnna horde, undead rogue is the answer
---
That's a new one.
---
Warrior should beat everyone else on small cleave as well, mages just pull ahead on Garr and Majordomo due to the abundance of targets.
---
Traitor; all horde grow up to be criminals.
---
The biggest tragedy of Classic is that it got taken over by tryhards.

---
I press x on that. Dungeon entrances were camped constantly even before p2, and pvp-ers still will famr honor while being in q-s(dont tell me that horde wont have a realy long q time)
---
Guilds will start transferring quickly when they realize they can no longer raid until they do.
---
You’re absolutely right - I remember the link achieve stuff and I agree that it is for the most part human nature.  What I’m suggesting is a server with addons disabled.  From my experience in classic thus far achievements arent a part of the game.  Both good and bad I suppose; achievements were fun to chase, but they were not a part of the game pre wotlk as far as my memory serves.  Of course it will just end up with ‘link [high-end eq] or no inv’ which is essentially the same thing, but having fought for excellent gear is different than what I’m suggesting
---
When fighting mobs higher level then you, you have a chance to do something called glancing blows. These are hits that do reduced damage. By getting "hit capped" which is 9% for 2h or sword+board warriors it makes you do the most damage when you do "glancing blows".
---
Its a stat you don't really have to worry about until your max level. Once your in your 50s you will start chasing gear with +hit %.
---
I hope that makes sense.
---
I’m not sure what the sick fascination is but make no mistake it IS fascinating. I’ve been playing since patch 1.5 and this event is totally unprecedented. There’s never been a point in wows entire history where an entire faction in near protest and disgust just flat out fucking up and left. It’s even more fascinating to speculate about if/what blizzard would do. In the past they’d do essentially nothing. It remains to be said if the same will happen today.
---
Thanks for that in depth reply. Sounds interesting.
---
He’s asking about PvP, not PvE. What you’re saying applies to PvE. Completely different stat priority for PvP. T0 is better for PvP in this discussion because stam.
---
Decursive was addressed during vanilla because the devs didn't like players trivializing a raid mechanic with an addon.
---
&gt;I wanted him to know death was coming just before I took his life
---
Yeah this is bullshit; all of this happened during vanilla. I've had multiple days of getting killed in Northern STV and then getting camped at the GY because it was so close.
---
The other side of the argument is somethings stay broken for years on end, because they are way too slow to even implement minor balance tweaks.
---
If you try to only level with dungeons your going to have a bad time. I would suggest going fury or arms. Those can still tank fine with sword+1h until your high 40s then you can respec to prot if you want.
---
If your set on going prot go 5 points shield spec&gt;3 pts anticipation&gt;2pt improved bloodrage&gt;1pt improved shield block that will get you to level 20.
---
Cruelity in the fury tree is a good skill to max (crits=more fury/damage)
---
And tactical mastery in arms is good as well for stance dancing in your late 20s-30s.
---
There isnt really any sudden power spike talents for warrior other then sweeping strikes at 40. So you can kind of play with all three trees some and if you get bored around 40 respec to arms and try 2h tanking.
---
You don't pay 15 bucks a month for Classic. You pay for retail.
---
5/7 photoshop skills!!
---
Im sure they conveniently utilized your misunderstanding of the loot rules to justify the priest rolling on the robe.
---
Ethically you can call em assholes, but from a technical standpoint, you made a mistake in assuming loot rules and reservations.
---
Except pre BfA retail servers were allready in dire state, where most competitive guilds were only on one sided PvP realms and wPvP was dead. Blizz tried to fix it with warmode without solving main issue for this problem faction disbalance due to Horde bias of supporting overpowered racials for 12 years.
---
Alliance have an easier time farming honor than horde does.
---
It's farming anything else that's the problem.
---
To be fair, there would probably be people trying to cheaply raise their honor by multiboxing two accounts and honor farming in this way. Can you imagine how fast you'd rack up honor kills with one of your (opposite faction) accounts just insta-rezzing, then getting killed, insta-rezzing, killed, over and over again for a few hours? Something to click the ressurect button continuously while your main just kills them extremely fast repeatedly.
---
I will say one thing though: It would certainly guarantee lots of multiboxers, and hence people getting at least two subs to WoW.
---
I agree. The key is a random drop off guards and mobs. Just because you picked it up doesn't mean it belongs to you. That is worse than me taking all locked chests because I'm a rogue and spent an hour getting 300lp 2 months ago.
---
I used to play World of Warcraft back in the day, I went to Guild Wars 2 when pandas came out and played almost exclusively World vs World there. We used to see this kind of behaviour all the time when certain servers would get beaten the top guilds would simply transfer. There came a point in the game when other guilds would simply follow them. This is exactly what happened in this situation. A group of guilds tried to run away and the other guilds followed them.
---
It is honestly no great Monumental event, the situation is simply weaker guilds wanted to transfer to a server where they thought they could become a dominant Force. However the dominant force from the existing server simply followed them to thrash them some more.
---
There are only two answers really, either band together, work on strategy relearn classes and communication, Recruit new players and fight back, or go to a PVE server.
---
Onyxia cannot be taunted.
---
Honestly fury/prot is a horrendous spec.  
---
The increased threat difference for the current phases compared to the quality of life gameplay you lose from not going deep/impale prot is simply not worth it in the slightest.
---
I have absolutely no issues tanking all non raid content as full blown fury myself holding threat vs my full raid geared guildmates.  
---
Honest opinion, any spec without TM is borderline unplayable.
---
They should all hang out in Darnassus. Horde would never look there.
---
If you’re only playing classic you’re paying for classic. 
---
But that’s arguing about literally nothing so I ask: why are you like this?
---
For levelling I gave up questing and farmed mobs in bumfuck nowhere Azshara and still got camped by hunters with pocket healers.
---
Phase two classic has been the most miserably unfun experience I've ever had gaming. I'm not going to pay money and spend my time roleplaying as a free honor quest mob for the constant roaming gangs of 60s.
---
Im glad you enjoyed it! It makes me happy to hear other people are happy about the thing I made.
---
One of our mages has lost azuresong mageblade twice with insane rolls.
---
First time he rolls 99 and gets beat by 100.
---
Second time he rolls 96, another mage rolls 96, then he loses the reroll.
---
Last wednesday he lost the trinket with a 92 roll to my 95 roll.
---
Poor dude.
---
Blood Elves make up 50% of the horde population on retail, just imagine what it would do to the classic servers.

Eve has been a thing since 2003, and it's always been a bit cut throat and hardcore as far as pvp is concerned.  You die in eve, and you lose the ship and anything in it's cargo.  People shoot you because they can, there's no real reward to pvp in eve, unless you're suicide ganking overpacked freighters.  The appeal to eve is that pvp losses have consequences and everything is essentially "world pvp".  The flipside is the pve activity in eve is for the most part incredibly dull (though there have been some recent changes that added a few more dynamic and challenging pve encounters).
---
Hilmar was not wrong when he said that, he's just gone about it some dumb ways and frankly its all too little too late.
---
You whisper anyone and if they block you, that is the message you see.
---
you can still sit enrage though, thanks to spell batching
---
But what about the specialization talents? 5 on two-handed weapons and 5 on either axe, mace or sword? If you go fury, you have 5 talent points on off-hand weapons but none on two-handed weapons. Would that affect your DPS output?
---
I've heard about people even in top guilds having fury prot tanks even in nax, its proven to be fairly good at holding aggro and putting out higher dps
---
You remember Vanilla wrong (or weren't paying as close attention back then) and have been playing incorrectly programmed private servers too long.
---
Private servers never felt correct to me. Classic does. Including the super obnoxious combat behaviors and things that look like bugs but are really the result of how the server processes events.
---
One thing that **always** happened in WoW from Vanilla until at least MoP and is one of the reasons I stopped playing arenas, is that in an effort to minimize events from other players to your client, it often won't update another player's position until they do something "important", like cast a spell. So you see their hands glow, then they appear to move while casting, then they stop and complete the cast. That's the **accurate** Vanilla behavior, but it's really disruptive to gameplay and looks like a really shitty bug. Most of your list are things like this.
---
Is it me or is this guy not even in the top 20 dps during that last boss fight?
---
The game itself has been on life support for years. There’s no real news there. 
---
World PvP has been “dead” since the burning crusade. And now y’all know why. Because aside from occasional voluntary events such as hillsbrad wars, world PvP has essentially always been completely irritated one sided griefing that has annoyed players. The moment players where given a choice as to whether or not they wanted to participate via flying mounts they almost always chose not to participate. And now all the naysayers who had this bizarre vanilla world PvP fantasy in their mind see exactly why.
---
I didnt even know this was a thing, very sad to see how much things have shifted towards minmax on absolutely everything.
---
Blizzard asked them not to?  There weren't enough servers at launch.  It was only after launch and after people had invested time that they opened more servers!
---
And most of the complaints I've seen aren't necessarily based on overpopulation in general, but that they handled the overpopulation transfers poorly by not faction gating them so that people on the 40% side of a server suddenly found themselves on the 20% side of the server.
---
You can't seriously think Blizzard didn't botch both the initial rollout and the recovery from that rollout.
---
Fury warr tank here
---
Berserker rage&gt;charge&gt;blood rage&gt;demo roar&gt;thunderclap&gt;sunder tab target+revenge.
---
Tactical mastery is a great talent.
---
Its very accurate on my server
---
&gt;However the dominant force from the existing server simply followed them to thrash them some more.
---
That didnt happen though, most horde didnt transfer off from what i understand
---
Why should a SS always be used on healers? Always? That is simply not true at all. Our healers don't die. Whats the point? Chances are if one healers dead, many/most/all are, and its a wipe. One soulstone on a healer isn't gonna change an ony for us (though we don't really wipe to ony aside from split 20 mans when people are off their game and we have literally 1 pve spec player cause pvp rankers)
---
If you're a healer you should consider your own play and why you would ever need a warlock SS on Ony, instead of appreciating/not appreciating what your top caster dps is doing for you lol
---
I'm a couple days late but I might take you up on this. I can't do a pvp server anymore lmao.
---
Nah, people wanted size increments even youtubers like t&amp;e got a chance to call the shit show that it was people asking for server sizes with arguments like "how is possible that blizzard wasn't ready for the amount of people that would join classic"
---
I had a fire mage with me the whole time, it was fun as hell
---
How about fucking no?
---
I wpuldnt spam shouts. You want to keep up battle shout and demo roar up on the enemies but I wouldn't use the rage to spam these over uour other abilities
---
On Mograinne horde camped like the last 20 meters of BRD entrance. Now they camp up too thorium point
---
Shadowcraft is better anyways, just avoid scholo at all costs lol
---
what if you get fireballed and then she fireballs some one else and then fireballs you a 2nd time before you can get healed?
---
I don’t know why but that made me laugh so hard. I love a good WoW name.
---
If they don't do it, 10 others will, which means they won't rank up
---
Stop blaming the players for a garbage system
---
Eh actually no, the shadowcraft 6 set is indeed prebis, but only the 6 set, the prebis for most damage would replace the chest and shoulders, with cadaverous and truestrike.
---
Almost every PvP server was already PvE due to player imbalance because everyone from smaller faction gradually left, leaving the entire server to have only one faction.
---
Sounds familiar?
---
Or maybe it's a game and I need my honor points to get that gear.
---
Pvp happened on a pvp realm so all the Allies quit the game/transfered to other realms
---
Are you saying it sucks being outnumbered in the world?  
---
Maybe you should just git gud since PvP happened on a PvP server or go to retail. 
---
Ain't it fun?
---
TrinketMenu is a separate addon if you meant that
---
I was never that guy
---
As another redditor said, she cannot be taunted.
---
My point is that you already have existing threat when you enter phase 3. Sure, attacking early may just make it even worse, but the damage might already be done if you don't know what you are doing in phase 1 and 2.
---
Like I said, if you do absolutely no dps in phase 3, you can still wipe your entire raid. What's more important is how to act if you actually *do* get aggro when she lands, i.e. position yourself correctly.
---
Don't blame blizzard for player behavior.
---
That sums up this sub
---
Horrendous spec, that every guild with the highest parses and fastest clears uses.
---
Equal skill as in pressing fireball for the entire fight while other slave mages keep scorch up?
---
They never fixed faction imbalances in Vanilla and many of those servers thrived back then and continued to thrive right up until cross realm zones were implemented, which nullified much of the effect of severe faction imbalance.
---
Does it suck to be on a really imbalanced server on the low side? Sure. But we literally have a historical record that contradicts the claim that it will hurt the long term viability of the game as a whole or even of the individual highly imbalanced servers.
---
The data just doesn't support it.
---
Is like them to eventually add the option to transfer to a tbc server. So people can play classic and gear out their characters and enjoy classic as their own pace to their own level of personal enjoyment but then if they want can move up to tbc. (And possibly other expansions too.)
---
Start in the era of what ever expan you want stay as long as you want with the ability to go forward but never back.
---
God bless
---
Doing split raids melee are required to hit her otherwise it lasts way too long. It's never really an issue if hunters/rogues drop aggro and have people ready to move.
---
Human rogue, all the fucking time.
---
"On Alliance Majority Servers" - You mean the whole **one** pvp server that's Alli-dominated? lol
---
You're not wrong. Doesn't matter which faction it is, people are assholes regardless of their avatars. But still, lol
---
That's my whole wow experience man.  Like what happens on other servers has absolutely no bearing on me at all.
---
How do you get ranks if you can't meet the 15 HK minimum because there is zero alliance?
---
Horde is not better for PvP. Horde racials may be better than alliance racials **for dueling**, however Paladins, Fear Ward, Escape Artist, Stoneform, etc actually make the alliance a better choice for group PvP content.
---
while i agree with most of what you say its your definition of game rules that are fundamentally wrong. 
---
The sole existence of rules is that everybody has the same chances. This of course is only true if everyone knows these rules at the start. the problem with wowclassic is, that blizz changed some of these rules and masked them at the beginning. i.e. 5 times the players than on vanilla servers. This was never communicated directly, no one knows any official numbers even today. 
---
So in letting ~5 times more player on a server, every percent of faction imbalance is 5times worse. Which blizz didnt address and was only visible when they unleashed the insanity with p2 when they released honor and canceled the layers at the same time.
---
Thats why pre p2 no one was complaining. Because as you said and everyone would of course agree that you sometimes get ganked and killed on a pvp server. Everyone knows that you get killed on pvp servers. But thats simply not the point. 
---
&gt;This is the game you choose to play. How you choose to play it is up to you, but how other people choose to play it is up to them.
---
The point is, that players on the losing faction cannot, and i repeat ,because thats the point your not getting, CANNOT play the game. 
---
Tell me how any rules in any game just tells one of two teams that they just cant play.
---
Wouldnt even call it effort. Frost mage to boomkin comparisons based on effort(in a case where the oomkin actually was doing everything right) would call for FAR more "effort" on their part to possibly come close to the mage, if even.
---
For that to be the case it doesn't matter whether the lack of Alliance comes from their own server or another.  They could have a 50% Alliance population and still have queue problems.
---
mind quickening gem, mage trinket dropped by vael, and troll racial both speed up cast time on your spells. this also applies when herbing, but not work for mining. with hand of ed its the same.
---
They ban in waves. They've been doing it this way for over a decade. There have been posts like these complaining that they don't address it for over a decade. And like clockwork, eventually the ban wave comes and wipes them all out.
---
Battlegrounds
---
This is so much better!
---
If it's 3 or less they don't even bother due to being druid.
---
Blizzard recently buffed the guards to be non-vanilla in neutral goblin cities to prevent safe-spotting. 
---
So they are open to making changes to those guards, perhaps they will be open to making guards stronger.
---
Will you hate me saying my 58 rogue got the chest twice 1. run? :D
---
Be on at 3 AM and 6 AM everyday and you will get it
---
This shit is hilarious. The game developers created a system. Then you have two different kinds of people who are painted in negative lights to each other. And the people are blaming each other instead of the people in charge of it all.
---
Reminds me of the real world.
---
This "why" is why we have fun.
---
Players always pleaded for convenience, and we got to bfa. 
---
This is classic. You can do all sorts of crazy shit. This is what classic players wanted.
---
Yes, on one server horde conquered alliance cities. So what? 
---
You want voluntary pvp? Roll on a pve server and don't bitch about needing solutions game already has.
---
You'd think that these chinese/russian scammers would actually ask someone who knows the english language to make a template for them, but nope.
---
I made two rotatiosn videos, 1 for leveling rotation, 1 for tankrotation /just use bloodthirst for shield slam if you are furyspec).
---
its on german, but you can just click to the conclusion.

Was dual wielding mandatory? As much as I do like the idea of at least dual wielding fist weapons, I'd rather wield a giant battleaxe, not be forced into having to carry two puny-sized hammers or two daggers like some rogue.
---
Only the party lead but everyone will get transported to the city once the bg ends.
---
It's not a spec you aspire to or "level up" into, it's a tool you have to use when your dps are pushing 800+ single target and shield slam and sunder can't keep up.  It's a very narrow and precise tool that is not very good outside of fully buffed and consumed raid tanking.  Deep prot is better at everything else, which is why everyone should start with it, and switch to fury only when their raid makes it necessary.
---
This comes up constantly, but no, mods were common during vanilla.  Perhaps you didn't use them, but they were common.  Removing mods isn't going to make it a "vanilla experience" because you are removing a part of vanilla to get there.
---
I've said this repeatedly and people still can't accept it.  The game they thought they remembered and wanted was never possible to recreate.  There is no magic fix, there is no amount of #nochanges blizzard could have done.  A "true" vanilla experience was never going to happen in any form of classic.  Even then, the "vanilla" experience people thought they wanted probably isn't even real.  stop mythologizing the game and understand why it was the way that it was and you could see why it will never be the same.
---
A little late but I was roaming around with a pvp group when honor first came out.  Some guy is bragging about how he's going to get R14 and he did it in vanilla.  Then we get into a big skirmish and he goes "sheep that resto druid".  RIP
---
Oh shit. I had accidentally put a set away before, and somehow didn't realize I could click it again to take it out. Thank you lmao
---
Transfers closed tho
---
Is there anything (Other than T1/2 or PVP legs) that, when paired with Giantstalker gloves (2% hit, 18 agility) exceeds Devilsaur in terms of DPS?
---
If the breakdown of stats isn't familiar, they are as follows:
---
Devilsaur set is 74AP, 2% hit and 2% crit.
---
Gloves alone are 2% hit, and 18 agility (which is 36AP for hunters). 
---
To match 74AP, the legs would need 19 agility - but this would fall short of getting a full extra 1% crit. So I figure that there's probably some value of crit between 19 - 34 agility where the ratio of crit - AP outweighs what Devilsaur gives.
---
Some player are really pathetic.
---
And saying dumb af doesn't sound dumb?
---
I played classic for 2 months and quit. I always want to play again because of how cool this is. Maybe even roll alliance for those sweet sweet BG queue times.
---
sure you did
---
Blizzard is shit like 10 years. If they didnt revive 15 years old game I would still make it a point to not play anything from them
---
&gt;Now, Zeppelins have guards, why the ship doesn't have them? I'm curious about it.
---
The absolutely 100% true reason is because vanilla was alliance biased and horde doing this kind of thing to alliance never really came up.  Beta and early vanilla certainly had alliance doing similar things to horde, so extra security was given to horde.  It wasn't seen as necessary for alliance so it was never put in.
---
Don't "plan" on going fury prot.  Level as arms, switch to deep prot when you start needing it for 5mans (late 50s), and pretend fury tanking doesn't exist until your dps are consistently pushing 800+ single target.
---
I think we found the snowflakeeee
---
I don't know who was saying that but I figured it would turn into what we see today.  The first night I went out as horde and we stomped pretty much everyone, I figured alliance would quit and things would just get worse.  I didn't really know it'd get this bad, but it was the only logical outcome.  
---
The million dollar question now is what's the q time going to be for horde bgs.  I am pretty sure it will be shorter in the short run than the long run (due to pve'ers grinding AV rep).  But when the dust settles, if that BG q is still pretty long, people will go around in their downtime and still honor farm which will be a huge problem.
---
It's not the only one pvp-server though.
---
It's shocking actually - yesterday we were doing an UBRS run, and I, a Warlock, made it clear to the priest and mage in the group that I was after the reed, and if they wanted it, they should say now.
---
Absolute silence.
---
I didn't like that, so I said that if no one said anything, I was going to reserve it.
---
So we went to the instance, were doing the run, got to Jed, and I asked the tank to put ML on for Jed. As soon as ML was turned on, the mage and priest got upset and claimed we were going to ninja the trinket - which didn't drop. I was dumbfounded.
---
The magical question is what's the horde q time going to be?  If it's long enough (who knows, maybe 10-15+ minutes), then horde will still probably try and get some honor by roaming around.
---
Not really fair. POP was like 40-60 and free transfers happened. Only 10% but I think it’s fair to say that free transfers for the minor faction led to an inevitable imbalance. Not the other way around. Being at a minor disadvantage led to a major imbalance which is the most occurring theme for a lot of servers (not just alliance which is probably what you see on reddit). Sucks but that’s what happens when the game company pretty much just wants people to go to retail. 
---
They could’ve done it so much better. With all the analytics and data from private servers. I think Blizzard wanted shit like this to happen. Completely avoidable imbalances and shit. It was all in the cards and the developers just ignore it, claiming that they were trying to keep it authentic. So dumb.
---
I know it's beside your point, but that APES guy jumps around like a 12 year old with too much Adderall
---
Don't be too sure about that. I work at another big video game company and our community people are watching reddit and other social media 24/7. Every week they send out a detailed report on reddit sentiment with a long list of hot topics. Furthermore, some of the higher ups seemingly don't do anything besides hanging out on reddit. Sometines they'll see an issue reported on reddit and demand it's fixed immediately, even though it might not make sense.
---
Support tickets on the other hand are likely to never be seen by anyone besides an underpaid guy in India. 
---
Anyway, depends on how things work at Blizzard, of course.

That's really ignoring the lack of catch-up mechanisms. Part of the complaints were that Alliance players simply could not run dungeons or raids without having to do an extraordinary amount of corpse-running. If they can't do instances, they can't get gear. If they can't get gear, then in addition to being outnumbered, they're also outgeared. In a game where gear makes up such a huge amount of player power, especially at max level, it's unreasonable to say the problem can be fixed by "banding together and working on strategy." (Also, recruiting new players doesn't really work either, since those new players aren't really worth that much until they hit level 60, and it's just as hard for folks to level up as it is for the current 60s to gear up.)

i agree about him being a smartass but just wanted to share that you can mail things like consumables to your alt and leave them in your alt's inbox. when you need them just press the "return" button in your mail and it's delivered back to your main instantly.
---
Over a hundred down votes for correcting "on accident". Feel bad for you man.
---
It's a strategy to keep other Horde from rolling on our server. Lately we've noticed that more Horde are joining the server, and we don't want to lose our 50/50 balance.
---
So you have never played wow or what? One-factioned pvp servers happened all the time and it was bound to repeat the same moment blizzard opened free transfers.
---
It was my DnD group and now they're all gone from WoW :(
---
I think you forgot to change your flair.
---
No conclusion jumping, I stand by it. I am setting some basic expectations even on pugs - but to be fair, I'm mostly doing guild / friends  runs. You do not have to agree with my statement, that's fine.
---
This is the worst part of phase 2.  NOBODY likes it.  The alliance obviously hate it because they are getting rolled.  But basically nobody on the horde finds it fun to spam instant casts praying to hit 1 alliance player while 5 other hordies are trying to tag it.
---
It's hilarious that they could make a system that everyone hates.  Phase 2/wpvp was a huge blow to the momentum of classic.  I think if they could go back in time almost everyone would agree that they should've just released bgs with honor.
---
Perhaps
---
I work 50 hours a week and just have enough time to raid.
---
Just got our first Rag kill tonight.
---
Not every guild plays 30 hours a week or more.
---
Thanks  breh
---
What happened in tbc ? Warriors started be a thing maybe around t5 ZA t6. Did they changed other classes or nerfed warriors ?
---
I wouldn’t necessarily always say it’s a desire to be on the stronger side, but the desire to not be on the weaker side. While that sounds like semantics, people are just as motivated by not losing as they are by winning. 
---
The end result is the same though, just a matter of how individuals behave.
---
No, a wave of tiny boneless magicians and small skeletons will wash over Azeroth with greater impact than the Cataclysm.
---
Just limit character transfer to the smallest faction and force the bigger one to be some what nice so they dont get flamelash 2.0.   You can argue that blizzard should do something, but I think its good for once to have consequences for being Dicks online.
---
Not for me. I'd rather not play at all than pve with no pvp end goal. It's so boring it hurts.
---
Its really just mob mentality.
---
200 IQ
---
Thanks for all the input so far guys. I've just woke up and am on my phone so can't reply to everyone, but here's a question I'd like to know the answer to...
---
Why not choose a Carrion Bird over an Owl?
---
How am i supposed to avoid being ganked while stealthed if lvl 60’s could easily still detect/see me?
---
Lol, if it was as flippant and mindless as you portray it to be then there wouldn't be such a strong divide between pvp and pve realms. The racials are a part of it, but that just reinforces my point. People who like PVP choose horde for the racials and because it's become a cultural norm and because their friends are there.
---
Whatever reason they choose it, they will succumb to the toxicity in more cases than not. And if you don't think it's toxic then you're kidding yourself. People can scream 'it's part of the game' all they want. But that doesn't change the fact that instagibbing anyone who lands on an FP, camping people for 5+ kills, zerging the menethil boat for days, etc is all extremely inefficient honor and the only reason they do it is because they think it's funny.
---
I have never heard of a boss dropping BoE epics other than what the loot table says. Hence you should be able to use this method as soon as you see the boss coming out of the gate.
---
I treat winning the role for the shackle key as winning the roll for the crate. 
---
This method can get messy though if someone were to save a key from a previous run. In that case I would have keyholders roll. Just my $0.02.
---
Maybe.'
---
But at this point its getting hard to give a shit.
---
You already destroyed one server. Don’t let it happen again. Be careful with this gift you’ve been given.
---
How the heck do you guys decide what class to play? Im so torn.
---
I never really played WoW before except for a brief stint in retail a year ago. And I really cant decide what class to pick. Im currently playing a Rogue because I would like to try out PVP, but at the same time, I would really like to play a Warrior, mage or Warlock. Atm Im torn between Rogue and Warrior.
---
How does one pick a class?
---
Now I want to go play turtles in time...
---
Tickets at the very least prove the company it's the client who pays (or maybe sometimes does some meaningful action as unsub). On reddit or twitter or elsewhere it's possible to create a lot of noise without any actual actions, you don't even need to be a Blizzard subscriber to shitpost here. They definitely take it into account.
---
Blizzard definitely had a proper feedback escalation procedure before, idk how do they handle it when they are part of Activision. Also their support wasn't outsorced but again, idk how do they do it now.
---
&gt; I played wow when it first came out up till wotlk. I am truly amazed at the level of toxicity that player bases have developed over the years.
---
&gt; At the risk of sounding old; back in my day killing people at the gy after they were corpse camped was outside of my anecdotal experience inside yours. Based on the level of complaints given around this topic it would appear to be outside the first standard deviation of experiences for most players who have also indicated playing over a similar time period. This phenomenon can then be considered to be abnormal behavior when comparing the current experience of world of warcraft to the experience remembered from over 15 years ago. It is possible that further anecdotes will be needed to quantify if this perceived abnormal experience lies outside 2nd and 3rd standard deviations of the norm. Care must be taken when sampling data from anecdotes and experiences drawn on memories that are now over 10 years old.
---
&gt; If anything this just makes the #nochanges crowd more laughable because most of the posts on here all touch on similar tones. Players have changed and games have to change with them.
---
I believe the former reads better, this is after all just a conversational forum.
---
Nobody cares about world first. Especially when a dozen guilds on every server will clear it on day 1.
---
Show me where in the tos you are not allowed to have multiple accounts and I will be with you on this, however since blizzard has already said owning multiple accounts is fine and they would have to go account by account checking since if they just mass banned anyone who had more then one account playing on the same ip they would ban couples and siblings and roommates that all play together.
---
And guess what blizzard is not going to waste its time or money doing that to stop something that has little to no impact on the game overall
---
Gtfo.  
---
How did you go with HOJ?
---
World pvp I n between w a larger ally ratio.
---
Thanks I will
---
It's so bad where these horde lose 1v1 or 2v2, come back with 3v2 lose, then come back with 5 or more people, uses a FAP then emotes as if he had just owned you. Players these days don't have honor or aren't familiar with a competitive PvP scene and don't realize that when they lose on a fair match, going back with 5 other horde and killing them doesn't mean your good. Battlegrounds will help the situation but arenas(if we go to TBC) will seperate the men from the kids in PvP. A true pvper will honor the 1v1, watch on the side and salute the winner regardless of faction. They will let you get back up, before mindlessly camping you. And most importantly acknowledge when they just aren't the better player. 
---
Pvper from Herod
---
Alright, do you have an opinion on the question I asked though?
---
Horde straight up winning flamelash it's the coolest thing I read all night. I Havent played for a month and I almost wanna re-sub as a alliance druid.
---
That's entirely on your ability to see past your own instinct to engage in tribalist bias.
---
The only thing I have in common with those people you hate, is the button I clicked when I started playing.
---
I picked horde because I picked alliance last time.
---
As far as we know yes. And since blizzard has thus far taken a relatively hands off approach toward mediating / preventing shit shows it seems like on PvP servers it’s going to play out exactly like it sounds like it will. Pve servers probably only take like 30-45 mins to get the letter on released. Maybe even less since that mob used to respawn fast af.
---
I'm not suggesting I have any answers. I'm just disgusted it was ever implemented(originally) . People actualy ticked off on it.
---
Two keys can drop during one run also.
---
It's gonna be wild on the big servers! Even the servers with big imbalance it'll be brutal for one faction..
---
Gonna be interesting for sure
---
Ehhh its a bit tricky mages as a whole will not beat them but whatever mage is getting the stacking fire debuff damg from every mage will.
---
Okay don't add battlegrounds to classic either because 0% of the playerbase plays them.
---
So which shadowcraft pieces are bis? Just any 6 set?
---
Every man for himself
---
To quote Varian when he's taunting in hots "no potions"
---
28 weeks later
---
I think the problem is your mace specialization talent does a stun instead of having a dps increase ability.
---
Not bad but it’s clearly horde dominated 90% of the time
---
Great spot to make trades
---
You had a choice not to be racist but oh well.
---
Sounds like a great guild name, bit too long though
---
Well, I dont know if I enjoy PvP. But I have played multiplayer all my life despising PvP (Because I never bothered to learn it and got killed by people way better than me). So I thought WoW classic would be the time where I would change things up and do everything I dont normally do but always wanted to try (PvP, socializing, actually playing the game for more than 10 hours).
---
But at the same time, I love tank classes and it always feel better (Imo) to be the one tanking the damage in games
---
You don’t need to be in protection stance all the time as a tank. 
---
You also don’t need to be using a shield all the time as a tank. 
---
Some people will yell at you and say that you’re tanking the wrong way, or you’re not a real tank, or you’re making everyone else’s job harder. That’s not true. 
---
Most of the difficulty of dungeons, especially earlier ones at level 26 comes from controlling the mobs, not taking damage, and the best way to control mobs is to do a lot of damage so they never stop attacking you. 
---
Stay in battle until you have some solid threat. If you’re in any danger of dying, switch to shield or defensive stance or both until the healer gets you stable. Tanking is insanely easy once you have threat. 
---
At 30 you get sweeping strikes if you’re arms (you should be arms) where tanking starts to become even easier. Charge in, blood rage, sweeping strikes and you have threat. Combine this with whirlwind at 38 and you won’t need to worry about it anymore. 
---
Have a mouseover macro for taunt and mocking blow so you can instantly pull mobs back if they break away from you. Use sunder armor on everything.
---
Anyone that was 50 during vanilla when honor patch landed could tell that this would end up this way, because they got already farmed hard back then as well, but not as organised as it was this time around. P2 depending if you were 60 already or not was the worst phase of OG vanilla by a lot.
---
That guild name of the one u flagged guy watching
---
Actually the most damage is with SC-6 plus devilsaur set
---
fucker did it nearly immediately after entering p2 the other night. that was a shock.
---
Once I logged in I had a pet that disappeared. When I logged he was full happy. Not in stable, I didn't abandon. Weird hunter thing I guess maybe.
---
Nah I like they way he made it sound like the other dude must go outside and take a shower there.
---
u will regret
---
&gt; I had a shaman solo tank a full UBRS run, he did just fine, even solo on Drak. Weak minded individuals like you are why people don't bother trying new things.
---
good point, I recently tanked a few bosses in MC and the clear time was nearly identical to a warrior. That guy is clearly stuck in his old ways.
---
Yep, but lots of them do.
---
1:12521, roughly.
---
&gt;  There's a best Threat set, a best mitigation set
---
this concept lasted through wrath until they normalized stats. People are really jumpy in instances, it really makes me want to wait to tank until late TBC. Probably one of the bigger sources of healer stress and my repair bill.
---
Great server! Horde side here. Fairly balanced I believe.
---
Unless you're running with geared rogues, you should be top dps for ony. You get to go all out on your dps in all three phases because you're the only class with complete threat wipe AND ranged damage.
---
That’s certainly possible but in the case of pve servers you just need to tag them faster. If you show up with a 40 man raid and the griefers show up with a 5 man griefing group then it becomes markedly easier to tag the mob in your favor. Which is why it’s not likely that there will be a rampant issue of people just trying to mob tag troll people.
---
On a PvP server however the mob exists in a relatively small hallway with numerous choke points on the path to him. This also happens to be inside black rock mountain. Most players (alliance) claim they can’t even get into BRM without corpse running like 7 times and being generally griefed into hell. So imagine how that’s going to be magnified when essentially an entire server needs access to this single mob in order to progress in the game. It’s gonna be a fuck show for atleast 24-48 hours on PvP servers specifically.
---
30 seconds. You should be un-PvP flagged for 30 seconds while you have rez sickness. That's more than enough time to hearth out. 
---
If it lasts too long, PvP raids will be able to spirit rez after a wipe, wait out the rez sickness collectively right outside an opposite faction major city, and run back in while everyone just watched it happen.
---
What these guys fail to explain is that u need to download the Battle net client only. I also made the mistake of downloading world of warcraft straight up! Then you can choose which game to download.
---
HS bug was only in wrath though correct? I didn't use it in TBC and was topping meters easily until we didn't progress past late t5
---
Yep. I got the SC first try at 57 in a mass guild attunement run. Not even going to try for the cadaverous.
---
Your comment still applies, people will cycle characters to farm honor on some servers. Thankfully, on mine (Smolderweb-US) this rarely happens. That being said, I was just at The Bulwark with my guild. A horde mage rezzed 8 times in a row with no res CD. After the 5th kill we just danced with him and cheered while he tried to port. Nonetheless, he was killed three more times by alliance running by.
---
&gt; I've seen videos of shaman tanks doing DM just fine so your probably just not running a shaman tank very effectively. They do fine for dungeons just that's the top end.
---
there's actually many shaman tanks doing raids lately with little to no problem. I'd say their top end is probably [Naxx](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=1150).
---
I camp it for kills all the time, it’s good honor
---
Isn't skarm on Fairbanks Horde?...
---
I camp it for honor all the time, it’s really good
---
heh
---
Nah bad idea.
---
Maybe you should mark this as humour, because fuck me, I had a laugh.
---
Math?
---
With the runner up being 6pc+Cadav Chest+Truestrike. It's really hard for any physical DPS to beat the raw stat block on Cadav chest.
---
Yes.
---
Yeah, for sure. Just stating what does the most dmg :)
---
Even though it makes the game really hard, this challenge is what makes it fun for me.
---
And the price of falling behind is nothing. A tabard? Woo.
---
People complain in retail about falling behind because if you dont do your dailies your neck level isn't high enough to use very powerful abilities. You literally become less powerful if you dont do your dailies.
---
In TBC, you lose access to a tabard.
---
Noone stayed on Flamelash KEKW
---
Well, can also just log into a server , and /join world and ask the playerbase I guess.
---
What else can you do, if Blizzard publicized their stats it would be much easier.
---
I decided very early on that I was going to play a tank warrior. I like tanking raids, and the class fantasy is great in my opinion, only second to a warlock. I also liked having the option to go fury for dps if I couldn't get a tank spot in a guild as dps warriors are quite sought-after. They're quite tough to level, but once you get there, and get some gear, it really pays off.
---
You think american english doesn't exist?

#ROFLMAO
---
People make a big deal about Horde racial abilities, but its not really that noticeable to me. I get my ass handed to me by Allies all the time. Sure, if everyone plays completely optimally and uses all their cool downs then Horde would probably come out on top/ get better value for their racials but realistically how often does everyone in a fight play optimally?
---
The more organized group with better gear and more numbers wins 90% of the time, doesn’t matter the faction.
---
TBC is classic but when classic finished college and pulled its life together
---
French RP-PvP server Conseil des Ombres was about 95% Horde / 5% Alliance when I left it back in 2010. It's still there, although in a somewhat better shape.
---
I think that the world first BWL clear won't even have time for the attunement. They'll just roll through UBRS.
---
Project Titan started as a new IP MMO.  It was eventually scrapped, and what was left was used to make Overwatch.  That's how I understand it.
---
For the people replying that don't get the reference. https://m.imgur.com/gallery/qW9JV

Holy shit I’m dying.
---
I use titanpanel and haven't had any problems
---
No it's not really that bad on any server, people just love to whine like little bitches on the internet
---
Funnily enough most alliance on my server did go to retail lol
---
Haha dude, this is beyond funny. You play on 3 servers and they are fine. Sounds to me like a person who lives i Germany  to say there is no world Hunger cos he went to Austria and Switzerland and the people were rich there. I explained with argumentation why the game is different now to what it was 15 years ago and why nit making relevant changes is bad for it.
---
You  only insult and act smug, making no arguments just chatting bla bla. Here is a site ironforge.pro check how many inbalanced servers there are and how they  are bleeding people  because  the game is unplayable at this point  if you are on the loosing side of a 40/60 ratio. Like Flamelash EU who has less than 100 active Alliance  players and a couple  of thousand hordes.
---
And last "no changes" if you don't realise how many changes Blizzard have implemented thus far - than sorry you are a true  simpleton and have never played Vanilla to begin with.  You just come on forums to chat shit and troll. And you  talk so much about retail - dude grow up. I don't  play it since 2012 but you  sound like you play it all the time but you  just suck and thus you  use it  as an insult. If you think there is wrong with someone for preferring  a different  version of massive online  game than something is really  wrong  with you. Get help.
---
&gt;Servers are dying
---
"ThIs Is GoOd FoR tHe GaMe"
---
We probably just witnessed a great statistical fluke where most of the alliance on that server were really bad, and the Horde capitalized.
---
They were having a lot of fun in Phase 1.  Most of them got to about 50. Half of them quit during the constant ganks of Phase 2 and the last few who hung on decided to quit after Phase 2's toxicity hit it's peak in the last two weeks with excessive corpse / GY camping. 
---
There nothing "bizarre" about being fed up with being unable to do anything on the character they've been working so hard to level, even in the face of Phase 2 animosity.
---
I've been playing DnD with these people for 2 years, I think I know them better than whatever assessment you're trying to push on them.
---
Or "Goof Troop"?
---
And on places like flamelash is what happens when only one side gets to have "fun" while the other suffers.
---
Everything in moderation, and humans are really shit at moderation.
---
Ok at this point I'm just genuinely curious. 
---
This is funny to you? You actually laughed at this..?
---
Lol right might as well just delete horde and alliance warlocks
---
Your UI offends me
---
There will be crossrealm BGs, so it seems silly? If there arent like 200 people getting ranked kills, you cant even get to rank 14. Also...how do you plan on farming pvp gear when theres not anyone to group with?
---
when BG's come out, you're going to be very disappointed.
---
Yes of course
---
The biggest things I switch stances for is 1. Overpower when I am in zerker stance.  2. Taunt when I am not in d-stance.  3. Whirlwind after I charge in or use sweepings.  4. Intercept after I charge or while I am tanking. 5. Any 30 min cooldowns.
---

haha lol i play wow im such a nerd

I like leveling my weapon skills.  There are like 16 of them for warriors.
---
Death roll &lt;3
---
was on my way to scarlet monastery, PVE server. saw a level 36 paladin flagged for PVP. level 60 tauren loser just kills him for literally no reason. why? why? lmao? if the dude had any honor, he definitely lost a bunch yeah? i just spammed /point /laugh at him.
---
They are tho. The other faction, and most of my faction to be fair, will never be anything more than above average NPCs. I don't care much for the feeling of NPCs.
---
&gt;being killed by keyboard turning PvErs is a legitimate problem in competitive pvp
---
Ah I see, you’re just bad. Maybe it was a problem in other expansions. Not the case in classic. 
---
Gear will only take you so far.
---
Sure you can, but few people see reason to have a 60% mount when you have a 100% mount.
---
have you never played a single player game?
---
Wasn't the AQ autofill something from 3.0 or something tho?
---
So, I actually did clear some of Naxx in vanilla and sometimes I tell my guild stories of back in the day of cthuns red Lazer or four horseman, Maxx, and all that jazz and then they ask me for the strategy and what to do on bosses. 
---
I tell them I haven't any idea - because 3 things1. I was not a raid leader or tank I was a hunter. I shot things. 2. I was young 3. Every single thing raids to today are so far superior than back then. 
---
We never killed Rag before submerge. It's so different now.
---
Im level 40, im still using way too much time finding the bat rider, going to the right district and finding the mailbox. A neat trick is to just watch where there is a lot of ppl clumped up :'D
---
My main is a female human mage and I have never been hit on. What you're talking about just doesn't seem to be a thing on my server.
---
Tanking isn’t hard mechanically, the challenge is all mental. Setting pace, keeping the group focused and diffusing arguments, navigating the dungeons without getting lost/remembering shortcuts, marking targets correctly, remembering which pulls are dangerous and how to do them, explaining mechanics to party members who don’t know them, coordinating CC assignments.... its a chore.
---
My best advice is to just Google a build guide and follow it, your talents are really the least impactful part pre-60. Its everything else you’ll want to practice, because if you don’t have these leadership skills down you’ll have a really rough time on BRD and beyond.
---
Go Arms until 55, then deep prop. Don’t mess around with weird Fury prot stuff until you’re geared and comfortable. Get weapon upgrades as early as possible, Whirlwind Axe at 32 ideally. (You will need help.) Keep well fed buff up, and use the slowest, highest damage 2Hander you can find, even if it claims to have lower dps. Your crits will be enormous and more tan make up the difference. Max out First Aid asap, and carry Stoneshield potions for emergencies. They are way underrated, especially in the Maraudon/Uldaman phase where you are still Arms but the game expects you to tank 10+ mobs like a prot warrior. Make friends with healers and quest with them, its massively harder alone.
---
Remember to have fun occasionally, and don’t listen to a word the bitchy AOE mages say. They’re mages, they can’t help it.
---
-A scarred first time warrior tank
---
Everyone is the comments: "REEEEEE this was such a huge secret!!!" Everyone knows this if you know how to use instances.
---
senpai~
---
Weapon skill does way more than just decreasing glancing damage it also decrease enemies chance to block, parry, and dodge with that added on to the straight hit % it ends up being a 3%higher hit chance for mobs your level and a +1.2% for mobs 3 levels higher. To a lesser extent it gives a minute bonus to crit. I have almost no down time leveling my rogue and I can easily kill mobs 3 levels higher still. Biggest hurdle for melee is hit chance since most your damage comes from white hits. You should be doing first aid which already eliminates most your downtime as a warrior or rogue.
---
That's just flat out not true. While all of this took place faction transfers were open. There's a good case to be made that this is Blizzard's fault: There were servers with an even worse balance that didn't die. When people don't have to reroll but can simply transfer this accelerates the process of Alliance leaving immensely.
---
Not sure on the economics of it, but my mate made a heap of gold disenchanting leather working gear and selling the enchanting mats. You just need to mail the items to a level 5 character with enchanting.
---
The best part is that listing enchanting mats on AH doesn’t cost a deposit fee and the higher level ones turn around quite quickly. You can disenchant any level of item even if your enchanting skill is literally 1.

I'm from Earthshaker. I'm alliance. It's about fucking time you got to feel how it is too.
---
&gt;and more nolife edgy kids chose horde.
---
Fixed.
---
that's a good tip, thanks
---
Honestly I blame the few people who just fuck around with super suboptimal shit and don't try at all. It isn't worth the risk of that person being inhibited from the class being bad to start, and if the guy playing it doesn't care? They really are a waste of space. I've never had an issue with hunters personally, but I have pretty much sworn off all druids because of how useless they are. You can fit a single hybrid in a 5 man, resto druid and prot pally is actually just a waste of time playing with. Add that to the fact that people never stop crying that warlocks tap to make the dungeon go faster.
---
Did you check the impact using the fight club spreadsheet ? With a Bis pre raid gear I only get a 1% dps increase compared with the rune of the guard captain.
---
The real fix for this would be not not award honor for killing someone who doesn't fight back. Its not honorable to kill someone who doesnt (or cant) fight back. Honor encourages you to kill even the ones normally not worth the effort. Take that away, and all you have left is people being dicks. This would fix both flightpath ganking and graveyard ganking up to a point. I mean (some, dare i say smarter) people make effort not to kill you when you're honorless target. Imagine if that tag never went away unless you attack back. No amount of sheeping or mind controlling would make it anymore beneficial for them.
---
From what I understood, most realms were fine before phase 2. There was the occasional skirmish with some bored people ganking here and there. But no one would really bother attacking you in towns and most of the time, they'd just kill you once or twice to get you off their farming spots. Though even then pure 1v1s were rare (most people only attack when you've pulled a mob or two or are at low health).
---
Warrior leveling shines with a partner who can heal (particularly a ret pal who can keep you both alive and join the fray) and you will be a lawnmower through the world.
---
Alone, without a killer weapon and fighting green mobs, it’s ass. You can barely squeak out fights against orange mobs through impeccable stance dancing and even then you’ll die with a few missed hits.
---
That said it’s incredibly rewarding. I got my warrior to 60 and have a hunter alt now and the difference is staggering. Hunter can get away with anything lol
---
Also, if you just want to tank anyway, you’ll have a good time. Warrior in dungeons is similarly a lawnmower because you have a full support suite with you at all times. Don’t even go prot til level 40 (for shield slam) or don’t go prot at all. I tank scholo/strat etc with an arms/fury build. 
---
Basically, whatever you do, make hella macros and get real comfy stance dancing. Your performance will increase dramatically when you’re utilizing the full suite of your abilities.
---
100%, also get your mount first.
---
Mats are yours, pattern rolled between who can craft it. /shrug
---
Lol I lolled too
---
Me as well please, this looks so awesome and Westfall is one of my favorite zones!
---
You can play the game without treating the opposite faction as nothing more than a resource to  grind.
---
Not to mention that Venture supported themselves by botting relentlessly. One of the most awful &amp; toxic guilds out there by far.
---
If you cant handle the rate then quit. Your momma raised a quitter not a farmer.
---
You dont need to be prot to tank dungeons though. Arms is all you need and arms is also the pvp spec, raiding is different I think, I wouldnt know as I dont raid tank, but for dungeons, you dont need to be prot and if you dont plan on tank raiding, dont go prot.  
---
  
---
The real reason there are few tanks is because tanking is the *most* stressful role in dungeons. Like you need to know the dungeon, before doing the dungeon and if you go slow you get yelled at, if you go fast, you wipe. If youre dps you can be like half paying attention and just autoattacking, people wont really be able to tell. healer is nothing short of comfy, you just look at bars, click the bar, click a heal and just mindlessly follow the group.  
---
It has nothing to do with being unable to pvp or what not, its just that its stressful. Most people who are playing the game want to chill and you know get some gear, why not do an easy dungeon and hope for the best? If youre a tank its pretty stressful, especially if some facet of the group is weak because you need to compensate for it.
---
What pserver do you play with FFA pvp?
---
Transfers are closed, so they can't. They rerolled? Well, there's an army of bloodthirsty lvl 60 Flamelash refugees running around looking for revenge. GL with their leveling.
---
could be wrong, but i don't really remember many dps warriors in my guild. did have ferals and enhancement shamans though and still rogues. could be due to the reduced # of raid slots
---
I want to transfer to a pve server.
---
If your going pve I would recommend Pyrewood Alliance
---
It's been about the same for us, until now.
---
you should have the right to do that i agree
---
&gt;Can't do thst in other games
---
Check out Eve Online, lol. That game literally runs on this shit.
---
What is the name of those shoulders? They are so cool!
---
You are one of the "I thought I did but I didn't" folks, more to follow. Well done proving Blizzard point on that.
---
I heard the same about Rainbow 6, For Honor, Counterstrike and a lot of other games.
---
I think gaming culture as a whole has gotten a lot more tryhard now that there's career posibilities. 
---
In the case of WoW, there's always been elitism and a lot of room for minmaxing, so I guess that amplifies it even more.
---
Z-Tribe
---
Maybe Mograine
---
Why people saying that horde plays horde because racial (because they are ugly race of course) yet 80% of Alliance Mages are Gnome Mages and lot of them Gnome because escape artist is one the best pvp racial?
---
&gt;transfers
---
Until they open paid transfers from PvP to PvE. Might want to pick up some activision stocks when they announce that one.
---
Great that must mean I can change from shaman to paladin too right ...
---
1st
---
Why?
---
it was really great with some of the bigger names in warcraft as bosses like kael and illidan
---
You wouldnt have got to the cache without the group, I always roll the pattern.
---
How do you spend 160g every raid in consumes and repairs in MC??
---
I came here to suggest ItemRack, but this separate bags solution coupled with IR seems to be the meta.
---
So, all casuals should just stop playing?
---
That's just not true.
---
Bruh it’s just people bullshitting and fucking around
---
Benediction alliance is very jam packed. I have a stream[here](https://m.twitch.tv/telusive/profile)  of a guild that rolls around in packs of 4-10 taking brm, chillwind, whatever. They’ll be on tomorrow if anyone is considering the switch.
---
You want STV regardless for the fishing hat
---
What is leather working gear?

“he’s cool”

*sees little gnome over yonder, casting frost bolt*
---
Boar is generally regarded as good because of charge.
---
You're absolutely right. The notion that there's somehow some fundamental difference between gamers based on whether they clicked red or blue on character select is absurd.
---
These crossfaction chats are prime comedy cemetery material and this thread just proves how fucking stupid the general community actualy is.
---
Congrats on the skill of outnumbering people. Takes real personal prowess to be more than one person
---
I am using auctioneer since day one. And i am doing a full scan almost every day. On peak times - like 1 month ago - there were always line 19k auctions. (Transcendence EU Alliance)
---
Now there are only around 10k. Do you think this means people are leaving, or is there another explanation (more pvp, less grinding, ...)?
---
Wait you don't get to keep your r14 and the gear once you hit it do you? I thought you had to constantly keep up the grind to keep it.
---
Skeram and Herod also have permanent horde presence in Ironforge not just one server. People want pvp they don't want constant griefing.
---
Come to earthfury, we need more alliance
---
That 1 hit is huge. It seems to me that you need some raid stuff to compensate for hit loss.
---
An entire generation of children have been taught that min/max is the ONLY proper way to do anything.

If you think it's bad now wait 20 years and see what happens when the fuckers become CEOs and Commander in Chief...

Will dying to an NPC in AV lower your durability by 10%?

In Vanilla, Alliance were the biggest faction by a big margin. As you mentioned, everyone wanted to look cool in their gear and humans by default looked really good in everything because all the gear was initially modeled around them. A major factor was that WoW launched off the heels of The Lord of the Rings films. A lot of players' first experience with Warcraft was with WoW and typical fantasy expectations, especially with LotR, caused tons of people to roll Alliance.
---
Which makes it balanced, no?
---
Hopefully not! gl
---
Honor is still split by all players who attack the target as if they were in the same raid.
---
It most likely died 4 minutes later for someone's quest
---
I think you took the title a little too literally
---
I've prolly mined about 50 rich thorium and not gotten an arcane crystal
---
It certainly was that way in TBC.  Primarily twink guild v twink guild.
---
The two most likely answers to this are: Blizzard want to maximise the amount of time any botters pay them subscription fees or GMs are so lazy/overworked they won't watch players with many bot reports for a couple of minutes.
---
It seems fanciful at best that botters the world over are all alerting each other the minute one of them gets banned for anything. Do people really think most people cheating in games are programmers rather than just people who look for and purchase prewritten software to do what they want?
---
I had this same issue in Vanilla where I explained the multiple ways you could tell the account was a bot, including part of their path involving getting stuck on a specific section of ground every time they looped round. Bot was there at least 4 weeks and I can't be sure they didn't give up due to me following them around tagging everything they attacked.
---
Lol, I can just tell you my experience with farming Robes of the Exalted. On my druid a few years ago, it took 17+ runs, (I think?) to get them to drop the first time around. And on my priest for Classic, I obviously wasn't gunning for them too hard, because I have better stuff through crafting, but it took about 7 runs. I got them as a bypass of farming Animated Chain Necklace, which dropped the same run. (Wow.) Anyhow, where this ties in is, when I was farming my pre BiS weapons for my priest, I had The Hammer of Grace drop in the first run. And of course, I had one of those people. A druid, who claimed "I'm going to use it for offspec.", after already having taken my +33 healing/+fire resist bracers which were actually a pretty insane upgrade for me. But whatever, right? He complained that I took 'his' weapon for about 30 minutes because he felt like him being offspec and wanting it warranted him a roll for it. People who roll need for offspec items are pure garbage, that much is true, but sadly people will always be on their side because it's not their loot they lost. However, if it did happen to them they would also complain. Just keep your head up and know that you're definitely not the only one who has felt the struggle of trying to get those robes.
---
That the point, no escape. Go retail with your friend no one will miss you.
---
Did they really win though? Alliance jumped the sinking ship and now Horde will have to sub new accounts to roll alliance in order to fulfill war efforts to unlock AQ.
---
It will change around lvl 30 when you get all 3 stances.
---
Well, as I said, I'm reaching decked out status. It's not something I have to deal with anymore, so I can't give you any clear answer to that!
---
But yes, being only in pre-bis, I would agree that truestrike should be used for a while longer.
---
Alliance do the same shit on servers they dominate. This isn't about players who pick horde, it's just what happens when everyone wants honor while supply is low and competition high.
---
Warriro becomes fun at 60 with some gear.
---
What kind of monster deletes their first mount?
---
I sent mine to a farm up state...
---
Vanilla player here, it definitely didn't happen all the time. Thanks for your input.
---
Pretty sure this is built into the interface. Check your settings.
---
Roll pve. don't roll mage. Else do what you want and don't overthink it too much.
---
I rerolled from horde on a 70/30 server to alliance on another 70/30 horde favored server. Best decision I ever made as a pvp player.
---
Well, the person I answered to was asking if the server were just gonna die and I just showed the current state, which is far from "wasting away".
---
That’s why raiders who need training wheels to deal with mechanics roll Alliance. FTFY.
---
asking around on the server is usually a good idea, but if you log on at the wrong time you'll run into weird people :D
---
I don't like this.  Why can't you just inch yourself away from the graveyard?  Eventually you get far enough away where they have to choose you or gy
---
Honestly comments like this make you sound like the worlds biggest dumbass.  You go around pretending like alliance don't take the same actions as horde players on servers which they have the majority.  Grow the fuck up you pretentious douche.
---
Haha, so they are stuffed progression-wise come phase 5 then?
---
You'll never convince the Alliance dominated reddit readers they are anything more than victims.   Even when they have the majority, they still find a way to be victims.
---
Pet loyalty. If it gets too low, they run off. Gotta feed and fight with the pet to get it to max level loyalty.
---
At lower levels, long afks will result in loyalty decreasing and faster depending on the loyalty.
---
Pickup Herb instead of BS. Huge demand and high prices for many herbs, even in low level zones. 
---
While you run around mining, you can also herb, and boost your income.
---
Bot is still a paying customer for Blizzard.
---
I don't mind you moving goalposts as long as you agree with your initial statement proven wrong.
---
Now I wonder how are you going to deal with the obvious and expected fact of PVP servers being dominated by Horde and PVE servers being dominated by Alliance? 
---
60/40 balance was expected for almost every PVP-server, imagine you open a transfer for the Horde from overpopulated to not overpopulated server, but the balance is bound to be messed up on one of them anyway.
---
It was people and the community who created the imbalance by literally wanting to play wpvp for the faction with better wpvp racials. Blizzard, obviously, won't police and restrict their choice.
---
Noggenfogger is probably one of the worst ones on EU, it's about 30 - 70. I'd say come here since we need more alliance, but on the other hand I think leveling here will be impossible. My 20 alt got ganked for hours in redridge last night.
---
But if you come to Noggen send me a PM and I'll give you guys some bags and stuff to get started.
---
Grob horde are a bunch of screeching moronic cats with 0 faction pride and will do nothing when the alliance raid.
---
Is Naxx very hard compared to MC and Ony?
---
"A lot of people"...you mean maybe 10% of people look that up.   I didn't look anything up before I rolled on my original server, I picked it because a streamer I liked was gonna play on it and I originally had a desire to try to play with him.   That never happened and I found another guild instead and we eventually transferred to another server.   
---
The vast majority of people pick their server on two things:  The servers name (does it sound cool) and what time zone it is in...thats about it.   Most people don't even know there are websites that have any data on the populations and assume most servers are fairly equal.
---
I'm honestly going to switch to a PVE server. There was a group of alliance sitting outside UC today killing people as they walked into UC. No one did anything for like 2 hours. Alliance gank everyone who walks near the bulwark or try to walk into tanaris. With out BGs its bullshit. I dont mind a fair fight but 4 60s sitting behind a tree waiting for you to walk into a contested zone and 60 is garbage
---
Yall really gotta quite blaming blizzard with the whole NO CHANGES movement that was super strong on here leading up to classic.  The players did this to themselves, they refuse to self regulate.  Turns out that guess what, classic was a fucking shitshow, but nobody knew how to really exploit it.  Not untill years later, so when classic came back, everyone just went balls to the wall and exposed it for the shitshow it is.    
---
PVP servers always had the potential to snowball like this, but your average player barely knew what BIS stood for let alone how to get it.  Now its all explained for them in easy to digetst bites.  The honor system, most people had no idea how it even worked....now everyone does, and turns out the best way to get honor is taking over entire zones and just murdering any red who dares to show up.  
---
Players raced to the bottom and its going to happen over and over again because guess what losing sucks.  So as soon as the migrants from one of the abandoned servers hit another one guess what happens, the pop swings wildly in the other direction, and the cycle continues.    
---
And before you bring up server pop being the problem, that is also a player self regulation problem.  NOBODY wants to play on any server except the numbah one server of epic leetness, even if you swear up and down you never would, you probably still want to, because this game is no longer about having fun, its about showing off.  
---
Players inability to self regulate for the health of the game is causing this problem.
---
no, these are four words.
---
I don't really understand why blizzard opened free transfer, why didnt they do free transfer for horde out and alliance in to balance it out?
---
Everywhere I see guilds having people with bindings.
---
We started clearing MC 2 weeks after the Apes and splitting it pretty early. We still didnt see one binding drop.
---
I guess this is normal and all the other people were just super lucky or are we that unlucky?
---
The irony of a misunderstood joke comment in a joke post is something rather special.
---
Hey kitty, you gave me a pretty good laugh the other day after the major migration, I had just spoken to someone how peaceful it was questing and being all semi afk suddenly you run straight over me with your kill squad. I didnt do anything because I was laughing, and I hope things will get better in the future. Kind regards, Cinq.
---
You ask about the empty shop.  You should ask why sylvanas felt the need to rebuild a perfectly good city just to make it spooky?
---
Zoned in and didnt have the damage to kill the first gargoyle in plague wing.
---
Classic WoW being released that the same time that places like Reddit and Discord exist has been pretty interesting to watch.
---
Honestly, the trick is to just play the game without spending time on them. Or at least don't assume that the shit that people spew on these boards is at all representative of what people in the real world think or do.
---
Yeah it's really cool getting raped by multiple Alliance in Earthshaker now that they have moved here and started fucking the server balance here. Blizzard never fails to disappoint, they managed to screw up yet again.
---
Proximity aggro at the edge of that floor
---
That means nothing
---
It's the flavour topic of the week - just as honor, streamers, layering and so on in the past. Ofc people will talk about a current situation - just as I'm sure next week will be all about BGs. I dont see a problem with this. What kind of posts are you expecting on this subreddit? Just ignore it 'til next big thing comes?
---
Whats funny is people don't realize that Paladin Freedom and Cleanse is 10x better than stun resist or wotf could ever hope to be.   Having 2 paladins spamming cleanse on your team makes them literally immune to CC.   Then add the fact you can't focus the Paladin because bubble and you have an invincible healer that removes all CC instantly.    Tell me, what racial compares to THAT?!   Zero.
---

Go do an instance with the pet on passive by your side. Will get loads of xp.

generaly speaking
---
ah that explains it...entire army charging at us and I had no idea how. Ofc vanish was on cd lol
---
Look I get your point and agree to a certain extent. I’d rather let that lvl 48 questing dude live than kill him for 10 honor. But at the same time what’s the point of a PvP realm if you feel sorry for killing people. Someone might argue that you should only fight other 60s, but what about 2v1-ing 60s? That isn’t fair either. But if I were to roam the world by myself looking for fair 1v1s, I’m bound to be demolished by groups. 
---
Is it fair to 1v1 a Warrior as a Mage? Is it fair to oneshot a half HP dude as a Rogue?
---
There isn’t really a definition of what is true PvP and what isn’t. Vanilla PvP is a messy shitshow that cannot be balanced or fair. It doesn’t help that Blizzard massively increased populations per realm AND failed to address faction imbalance.
---
Rules
---
    Content must relate to World of Warcraft: Classic
---
Yep they won it so hard they have no chance of opening AQ...ever
---
BGs are xrealm
---
What's worse is the pirated server shitlords that spread bad information
---
We are talking about allys here
---
Have you considered that they might've lied?
---
This guy fight clubs
---
If you're in horde territory you need to enable it once you do it lasts 5 minutes after leaving pvp combat I believe
---
Great post and I think the word you were looking for is masochistic.
---
To be fair it’s entirely the players fault.   Whether horde or alliance dominated, when they camp the opposing factions city and treat enemy players as nothing more than NPc’s then this happens.  
---
Blizzard made many posts asking players to swap servers due to caps and imbalance early on, and it was ignored by most because everyone was whining about dead servers.   Well, these people are on busy servers, but it’s only busy for 1 faction.   Is that what they wanted?   Probably not.
---
It was done for MC only. We didn’t do this for Ony because we know how it works. Even so, when she comes down for phase 3 the main tank just hits recklessness and a rage pot while everyone else halts on dps and we usually are just fine getting her back from all dps. So yes. I know how it works.
---
I think even if you use a very loose definition of sociopathy calling people who grief that is stupid.
---
This is a videogame in the end and alliance crybabies on this subreddit are insanely annoying. A guy on Mograine is ganking people questing there for like 3 weeks straight, but when he kills me I dont think he is a sociopath.
---
care to explane how that works
---
eve online, archage, hell any sandbox style mmo.
---
You are a crazy person.
---
Ye and almost all of my online friends were global elite in CS:GO and 2.2k arena in season 1
---
It's entirely possible but I doubt the majority rolled for that. 10% of that 60% could of rolled for racials and that would still leave the other 50% of people as just people who like Horde.
---
Not to mention Troll racials are hardly pvp spectacular and there are plenty of those.
---
Easy honor
---
On pve and rp servers alliance is dominant I believe.
---
Ok you're obviously a troll now.
---
My initial statement was that Blizzard botched the rollout.
---
You've all but confirmed this by admitting that they started faction gating them later on after it destroyed some servers.  (Or were they wrong to faction gate them, and they had it right initially?)  Either way, Blizzard fucked up.
---
Maybe because numbers tell it's true? When WoW Census addon worked 8-9 weeks ago we saw disbalance seeds on all PvP realms. Instead of addressing this issue limited creation of new characters on 60%+ domi acting faction Blizz just grabbed all cash they could to enchance their Q3 financial reports while Classic hype was high.
---
Now they are loosing Alliance subs and Horde subs on some PvP realms.
---
Right, so the issue isn't horde are over-powered, its that alliance don't organize.    Good, organized alliance players are basically unbeatable, there are no ways to defeat them if they have pocket paladins for every melee in the party.
---
I agree with everything except the part about staying in battle stance for threat. You 10% less damage in defensive stance, but you do 30% more threat so you pull out ahead in def stance. Only go to battle stance when you need an ability from thete, same for zerker stance.
---
ah yes it is thank you
---
From Flamelash-Horde: Sorry in advance for trying to kill you this week. I'm just trying to get to 15HKs to not lose the rank progress.
---
After that, I have no plan on fighting you guys because I appreciate it takes courage to stay here.
---
Hope to only fight you on BGs... Or if you guys attack first :P
---
Except TB is the best horde capital, and Darnassus is a spread out wasteland.
---
What servers where alliance have a majority? There’s literally one pvp server in eu where alliance has a majority.  You rolled the Zerg faction, deal with it.
---
It is not at all unprecedented. We had situations like this a lot in private servers. And we even had situations where servers even recovered from this.
---
We have been trying to warn everyone that a faction can indeed win the World of Warcraft. This time, *it‘s us elitists* that made the point the game is too cut-throat and unfair, but that was met the same way an entitled newbie might complain.
---
Ph2 was monumentally stupid. Most servers are smart enough to either throw in honor immediately: People have to sacrifice their leveling progress to kill a lot of enemies and inevitably fall behind to a point where they can only stay in Redridge. Or to have bgs in ASAP.
---
Heck, K3 implemented a way to join bgs from anywhere and instantly zone back to where they queued from. It damaged the server long-term.
---
Also, mods, you folks needed to do better. We could have really used a subreddit where our experiences from private servers are not criminalized and censored. Not like Reddit has that kind of direct influence on Activision but still left a very bad taste. It directly curated a community where us „pirate server“ players are judged and even insulted. It created quite a big divide in this community, where people are either judged as retail newbies or private server jerks.
---
Don‘t get me wrong, nothing could stop this echo chamber from escalating.
---
Probably right but doesn’t matter right now when horde have twice the numbers or more in every single encounter.
---
Yeah it's super fun. Probably the easiest class I leveled (hunter, pally, warrior).
---
Why do I say this? Because gear is never really an issue.
---
It's very easy to find groups as a tank, you can tank using 2H until late 40s, which means you'll be in dungeon gear through most of your journey.
---
And you get some insane gear from your quests. At 20 you can do a long quest chain to get a nice set. And at 30 you can do a short chain that awards a weapon equivalent to lvl40 weapons. (aside from dungeon drops)
---
You will need help from higher lvl players in your guild to finish your class quests. Any player above 40 can help sufficiently.
---
Warrior is only hard if you don't like grouping with people. I found leveling it easier than my hunter or paladin.
---
But what about if i wanna talk about the kombucha batch i got brewing atm.
---
Lol how is that karma
---
True, but when you are on BG in premades vs premades. In wPvP Horde doesn't need CC, they just zerg enemy resistance by mass AoE and direct instant casts of their 3v1 advantage.
---
You could say the same about any PvP game. Is smurfing in LoL or DOTA sociopathic? You are ruining the experience of 5 people for your own gain. If a CoD pro joins a random TDM and goes 50-2, is he sociopathic? I’d certainly hate dying to the same dudetimes 10 over.
---
The entire point of a PvP realm is to kill the other faction. We can all agree the game would be many times more enjoyable if factions were balance. But you cannot blame players for doing what they are incentivized to do. 
---
And before some idiot wants to ad hominem me, I’m playing on the outnumbered faction myself. Doesn’t mean I hold enemy players accountable for Blizzard’s lack of balancing the game.
---
Hate the fact that we're the only class that suffers from gear transitioning to pvp. For preraid bis we're in pretty much all leathers and DW which doesn't do shit in pvp only helps us die faster. Hate the fact that I cant roll on ANY T1 items in MC or ony since they are all for tanks. I sometimes regret rolling war because of the fact we work so hard to get into raids and the only payoff we get is to clear raids faster but doesn't offer any benefits to pvp unlike casters , rogues, hunters were they can benefit from everything
---
0 unless you are talking Geddon or Rag.
---
I don’t know private servers history. But I definitely listened to everything you guys had said, planned accordingly, and have not been caught off guard once during this entire classic experiment.
---
The best level xD
---
Paladins are better in pve than windfury though.  Windfury is more fun, sure, but you get better overall dps as a warrior with Bom, Bok and salv on you.
---
Honest noob question, why are there so much more horde players than alliance ones?
---
we will definitely attack :P
---
Those two things are the same.
---
And you dont need the quest to enter bwl. You need it only for using the orb.
---
Most guilds will go through ubrs to avoid the chaos outside. Either by splitruns or after another in a cleared ID.
---
Came here to say this.
---
Before your pet gains higher loyalty levels it loses happiness very fast. You don’t have to be AFK very long for it to abandon you.
---
I don’t think differently and I don’t play on the dominant faction. This is the problem with ad hominems. This is not an us vs them issue, although it’s easy to portray it that way and even easier to farm karma on reddit for saying horde bad alliance guud.
---
We've been raiding since the second week of Classic and have yet to see any bindings, Eye of Sulfuras, only 1 Perds from Rag and no other weapons, only a single Caut and Spell Power rings, and barely any weapons from Ony. Yet it seems like every other guild is already getting their alts that gear.
---
Fuckin' insane, man. Just don't get it.
---
Why would warmonger on a war be bad? Is hit just useless in classic?
---
Well, on the subset of players who were shouting "#nochanges the vanilla honour system was AWSUM!", agreed. I was saying way back when that the vanilla honour system was an atrocity which should never be repeated but I admit I didn't foresee an entire faction being wiped out.
---
It's really scary to think people like you have access to Internet and are that fucking dense lol.
---
What he means is that people nowadays takes advantage of all the shitty mechanics classic has to offer compared to 2004.
---
People are way more organised now than before. You have discord servers with 2k hordes from one server so it's so easy to organize attacks on shit.
---
Gloinador!
---
He didn't reply me after this sadly.
---
It won’t change? That’s just factually wrong. Even if only 10 per realm chose to queue WSG over roaming the world that invalidates your argument. In reality most people grinding honor atm will be in AV rushing the PvE bosses. Ofcourse there will be griefers, but the amount of them will be magnitudes smaller, which in turn constitutes a massive change for the outnumbered faction.
---
What were they saying?
---
So who is the salty one, the one who corpsecamped your friend? Also what were you doing while he was corpsecamped?
---
&gt; Meme is meme. Feral is meme because of what it takes. Viable, sure. Still meme xD
---
Feral is not a meme. Idk who told you that but they're seriously misinformed and havn't played since 2004. They're damn near optimal. Suggest watching this to know [exactly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQDIo6S7iA) what's the difference.
---
no one cares about the rules
---
Makes sense.
---
Pretty easy to find a spot. Just make sure you're a real offtank, not someone waiting to be a main tank.
---
Keep buffs and debuffs up 100% of the time and make sure to have to have a full tank set, a full FR set and a full DPS set. You're going to be filling each of these roles in the raid.
---
Rarely you'll find a guild that rejects a properly prepared offtank. Unless their roster is bloated with warriors.
---
P.S. Respect the loot order. You'll never be as important as the MT. It's annoying to always be 2nd priority (or 4th+), but it is what it is.
---
Also, being liked by the guild contributes highly to your status as OT going on to be a MT. Tank stuff for your guild. Help them. Join discord and chat with them. It helps a lot.
---
Personally I would have liked BGs from day one, just as something else to do besides levelling. But that's water under the bridge.
---
The price is the price, my man.
---
Predicting the whole p2 shitstorm and warning the community about it.
---
I need advise from Main Tanks that are already raiding in Classic. I am a Troll Tank Warrior. I am currently using Valor set (up to 6  equipment only)  with 5% hit chance (I read it is minimum for tanks).  
---
Is defense + rating really required as pre-raid gear?  I am planning to get Deathbone set (which is for paladin) and replace my valor set. But what i notice it lacks quite an amount of stats i would get from Valor Set (Strength, Agility, Stamina and Spirit)
---
I got completely baited into that
---
Never saw Onyxia DB in classic is she bugged or what (or are our locks dot the key)
---
And none of these uses actually correspond to its meaning in psychological terms, referring to PTSD. :/
---
Probably not one as braindead as WoW PvE.
---
&gt;**The Spirit Healer emits an aura 30 feet around her that unflags (even in a contested zone) anyone who also holds the Resurrection Sickness debuff. If you leave this aura, you unflag, if you attack, of course you unflag.**
---
You dare put some #CHANGES?!?!!
---
Jokes aside, this was telegraphed.
---
This subreddit is pure trash.
---
These posts are garbage.
---
So why did Blizzard try?
---
Just say it with me:
---
Blizzard fucked up. Come on.  You can take their dick out of your mouth for long enough to eek out those words  right?
---
here’s an example of a comment from about 10 months ago. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bc6xq6/comment/ekrspph?st=K3WWF5SS&amp;sh=7a6c4ed6
---
Openning up servers to pvp to pve stransfers would be cool. My mum has really enjoyed her pve server and is trying to convince me to play. 
---
Currently im rolling an ally alt so i can do what i want and play on the minority faction.
---
Waaait  a minute. You joined a PvP server in the hopes of ""fair"" gameplay in a game where hundreds of people are literally banding together to...pvp? ahahahaha you fucking dense motherfucker. Please gtfo back in your cave.
---
Yeah that didn't have anything to do with private servers though.
---
It was actually Nefarian that started the gank cycle. Thats why we fight him canonically.
---
Ha considering there are less dots in splits ,more dots might be true
---
The hunter who had both Horde and Alliance accounts. I was helping us finish a quest because I can't help him.
---
Not the only 'Eternal', I expect. Don't think there's a Rumstag there.
---
ESPECIALLY the character models. They're all so damn good. It's how I thought WoW's visuals would eventually evolve or how I'd think WoW 2 would look. It has an overall rougher look that I think is more fitting than the style Retail has.
---
You know the priest is the asshole here. I don’t even need to read the other comments. As a Druid who runs feral/resto HotW spec. I heal raids and tank 5-10 mans. But I consider resto my main spec because itemization for feral in raids is absolute shit. Since I’m decently geared in dungeon blues already, I tell every group I tank for that I’m only running for healing gear. If the healer is cool with it, then we roll against each other, if not, then they spend another 30 minutes or whatever searching for a tank. Rolling on gear that does not match what you’re in the dungeon for is always frowned upon. If they all told you to cry more then all those cunts are either friends, guildies or assholes and you got unlucky. That is not typical loot etiquette.
---
if you're unhappy, just cut your losses.
---
If classicwow plus was being considered, what 3 raids would you personally add and in what particular zone would you find them?
---
In horde, orcs and undeads are mainly dicks.
---
Funny enough how trolls are the less ''troll'' of the game.
---
Or any isekai anime really
---
Any good addos for reapplying Rockbiter/Flametounge/Windfury?
---
I played Shaman through TBC and WotLK, but i dont remember it being this tedius reapplying it every 5 min &gt;:(
---
I have Totemtimers, but it only shows the remaining time at my healthbar. There is not option for a warningen when it disappears.
---
And? When horde ruin that server I will have plenty more popcorn for that too.
---
It really isnt that crazy. You wanna play as the ”good guys” you pick ally. You wanna play as the ”strong underdog” you pick horde. Wanna play as sexy night elf you pick ally, and if you wanna max your pvp chances you pick horde etc. Theres more going on than simply choosing red or blue and while these factors doesnt really show a fundamental difference, you should see atleast some difference with a big enough player base.
---
Noggenfogger leaked some Alliance players during the first two transfers but has stabilized lately. World was in hard lockdown by Horde for few weeks and there's still plenty of them out in 50+ zones but it has calmed down a bit on lower level zones now and I even saw some Ally squad hold EPL FP for a good while few days ago.  
---
Hopefully the world situation improves with BGs as its still very hard to go around gathering endgame mats.
---
Since you are a troll with no weapon skill you need 9% hit for raiding in MC. Don't be afraid to equip mail to get hit, for example bloodmail boots is excellent.
---
Now you can get away with less than 9% if you are no the main tank as you'll have time to build threat.
---
That's why it's a paradox.
---
&gt;So why did Blizzard try?
---
What why lol? They don't have to fix faction disbalance at all: not their duty. Still, they have enabled BGs to be cross-faction so dominant faction on a server can have lesser queues, they have enabled auto AQ far effort completion etc., etc. 
---
&gt;Blizzard fucked up. Come on.
---
You thought you did, but you didn't, dude. I guess it sucks to be proven the hard way though.
---
thankfully, yeah. #nochanges would have made that horrible.
---
&gt; and im sure blizzard will help them
---
Honestly, I doubt this. But I wish you guys the best of luck. It's a shit situation and you're trying to make it work.
---
Depends on the coding of Flame Buffet for both classes.
---
You knew it from the start, PVE gear is tailored for tanks. You cant get offpieces thoug, 2h weapons, Onslaught girdle etc.
---
As a warrior, you either focus on PVP or PVE, doing both will get your wallet dry
---
You're not alone. We did a late night UBRS and the reed dropped. Warlock was the only caster dps there so we were all 'gz!' for him. But he didn't know about the item, didn't read it properly and dismissed it as a healer item. He greeded.
---
Thankfully I'd noticed in time and could need on my healer. Worked out pretty well for me! :P
---
I do the same to players with non rp names on an rp server
---
&gt; You clearly never heard of warrior vanish.
---
&gt; Hint: brez
---
or you can gnomish cloak on the combat pulses instead of loosing all buffs.
---
A full MC clear takes shorter than a bad BRD run
---
Am i on the only server where horde sucks?
---
Ony is a very failable boss to be honest
---
Try a different raid id
---
Good message. I'll try to respond to each major point.
---
1) The "no private server" rule was instituted before I joined. The purpose was to differentiate from r/wowservers. We maintained the rule on the basis that there already was a place for private servers. I personally think this is far down the list of major problems on the subreddit. I don't see us opening this up to private server discussion (beyond defunct servers) anytime soon.
---
2) We didn't link to Right Club for the same reason we didn't link to any website that is full of hate speech. We're not going to promote a place that is practically unmoderated. We're not saying all links have to confirm to our rules, but we also don't want to link to places that had unfiltered usage of the n-word or f-word.
---
3) Big news and announcements nearly *always* get upvoted to the top. There's no need to sticky what already reached the top of Hot, IMO.
---
4) We're actively discussing rearranging/removing the discussion/question-focused stickies and opening those up to be new text posts, while moving fluffier stuff to stickies or to specific days (e.g. Meme Monday or something).
---
The feedback is appreciated, sincerely.
---
&gt; A well played Fury Prot Warr with TF is able to outthreat any DPS warr single target. Ofcourse such a tank is a luxury, but I though we were talking best case scenarios.
---
A well played fury tank doesn't even need TF to outthreat dps. Leave TF for like a paladin or rogue raid tank who are literally able to do AQ thanks to it.
---
It's the no changes folks that are doing this stuff, or they are among them, it's why they wanted it this way.  They knew going in all the way to exploit things in game and wanted that advantage.
---
I'm a little confused by this question, I'm using ItemRack for the addon for my trinkets, helmet, boots, etc. If that's what you were asking for, if I didn't answer your question, lemme know and I'll try to give more info.
---
How am I supposed to keep mining on my current level? I always fall behind in the Mining Nodes I am able to farm since the ones on my level become green far too soon. Smelting is on a grey level so fast, that there are around 30 levels I need to make up by just mining.
---
Do I need to invest direct time to just mine and keep it on my level?
---
That's because they didn't put in the same effort. That's like complaining that CEO and janitor get paid differently even though they work for the same company and even so the same hours 
---
Nah, the "casuals" have complained that they want things differently, because they didn't want to pay with other people or pay for longer periods of time. 
---
The only thing more accessable that tbc have made was adding heroic dungeons. But even those were intended for raiders.
---
too\*
---
Pretty much this.
---
Pick any PvP server.
---
Youll get destroyed as any spec if you dont stock up on FAP
---
I'm horde on another balanced PvP server and everything has been fairly smooth. Sure there are times I have it hard but the ally generally has it hard in another area at the same time. Then after maybe an hour it will reverse when people move zones. 
---
My overall farming hasn't changed much outside of maybe 50% of the people who would have passed me up in phase 1 will now likely attack me. Then most of the time when I rez they are gone.
---
Overall the experience is basically as it was for me back in BC and WotLK. Once BG's are out I expect it to be pretty identical. With the bulk of PvP focused people in BG's and occasional world PvP. Also expecting that fewer people will attack me out in the world.
---
“Didn’t wanted”
---
Lol flametrash
---
I'm a gnome mage. Didn't gank a single time until mid 40 when I got ganked on chicken escort quest twice, by groups of horde. I play gnome mage not because I'm hardcore, but the opposite, it let's me slack as much as possible without dropping off as heavily as I would with another race.
---
I named my Priest Narina in vanilla. When they released BC they used my name for a bloodelf bowyer.
---
And tens or probably hundreds of thousands of people cleared Naxx by 2.3. Hell is your point?
---
Players a a little of the problem trying to Aoe cleave stuff when I’ve asked them not to repeatedly or pulling for me when I’m not ready(I prefer controlled pulls hence am do my own unless say a sheep is needed)
---
But the main reason I stopped my warrior was because I’ll gear to bis at 60. Then....nothing. Tank spots are gone for raids. Yes I can dps. But if I wanted to dps I’d rather play another class. Rolled a warrior as the premiere tank class. Ultimately just be wasting my time if I wanted to raid tank. 
---
I assume that’s partially why others won’t tank either. Why bother doing the work of you won’t be able to later?
---
Depends on what class he plays .
---
I can as a hunter, my mate can as a mage and I am pretty sure a warlock can do it as well.
---
Im healing MC with my pally as ret spec. Nobody noticed. Usually top 3 healer and last on overhealing
---
Jj Allen must be so happy right now,  a few months and they'll have destroyed classic and will be ready to sell his shadowland shit , perfect plan.
---
No I did not. What comment?
---
atleast he does not despawn anymore.
---
I feel like some of our fury wars sub in as filler OT’s occasionally as fury spec.
---
&gt; Depends on faction. Horde warriors will always be ontop with wind fury.
---
Depends on the armor values of future bosses, it might be more efficient to get Shadow Oil on weapons. Especially, since WF resets the swing timer.
---
I agree, p2 was a mistake from the start. I rolled pve first , got to 60, but I'm rerolling Ally on a pvp server to join friends... Exactly what I wanted to avoid, this whole shitshow, guess friendship is more important.
---
The racers will go through UBRS for the first run then they will attune their guild throughout the week in offhours.
---
Just getting into UBRS will be hard enough so unless they collude with the opposing faction or one faction wins BRM and has a priority list for guilds then attunement will be simply impossible on pvp servers.
---
Imagine being that dense lmao
---
Who Hurt you buddy?
---
They were growing in wrath, all the way up to cata launch, it was just that the last year of wotlk didn't see as big of a growth, as one can expect of the end of an expansion.
---
Some numbers :
---
Q4 08 to q4 09 saw no growth, but q4 09 to q4 10 saw a growth of 0.5million.
---
Then Cata released and they started dropping subs q1 11 saw a loss of 0.6 million, with a further loss of 0.3 million in q2.
---
At the end of 11, they had dropped down to 10.2 million, a loss of 1.8 million subs.

That’s how every word got it’s definition. Do you think the letters C A T, when arranged in them at order, automatically mean 🐈? That’s just what we all agreed that animal is called. Words themselves have 0 meaning outside the context we use them in.
---
What did you lvl first?
---
oh my wet boomer dreams
---
It's like all the English lit classes that are like "the author picked a blue wall because it symbolizes calmness and peace' when the author just picked a blue wall because he liked blue walls.
---
There's plenty of people with multiple subs these days I'm sure they'll be fine not to mention Blizzard has been ok with with some changes could see them implementing the later auto fill. Seems like someone's got sour grapes, why?
---
Ikr
---
Am I the only one who has always played both Horde AND Alliance? I always have toons on both factions.
---
Can I ask why you have auto attack in cater form? I see it a lot and wonder why people don't just tab attack etc.
---
Tons of old rules don't exist anymore, likely because they cut manpower to investigate and stop. Like this isn't even in the ToS anymore. 
---
My guild opened a ticket about the devilsaur mafia on launch. Both and ally guild and a horde guild working together to lock down ungoro and defend each other, GM said it was entirely within the current rules of the game.
---
You care about random people on the internet? The fuck? The other faction might as well be NPCs we are grinding, they just have slightly better AI.
---
I’m also a gnome mage + engi since I played private to figure thinks out and saw how op this setup is(BiS pve &amp; pvp). Also never attacked anyone till60, even if I don’t lost any 1v1 someone started with me(I’m not a pro usually stoned as fuck if I play, but gnome mage+ iron bomb&amp;gnomish trinkets on lvl 20 is crazy op).But we have chosen the pvp race and have to live with the hate our mates deserve(played horde on private and 90% of all ganks were done by gnomes).
---
&gt; Shaman single target threat is suprisingly decent.
---
&gt; 1 max rank sunder in def stance with defiance is 374 points of threat.
---
&gt; 1 max rank earth shock is 1062 points of threat.
---
&gt; Frontloading one of those and autoswinging with rockbiter works out quite fine.
---
Indeed. I linked an interesting write-up to Rukya above your comment that takes a look at the subject of shaman tanking and in raids no less!
---
I've literally witnessed what you claim to be impossible.   I don't have to tell myself anything.   Go play on heartseeker to make yourself feel better.
---
Exactly. And racials have cooldowns. Can't pop them every fight.
---
You got so close to understanding the concept of a joke, but you didn't make one
---
Well yes and no, the reward alliance got was capped to 20 kills so everyone just did that and moved on.
---
The Alliance shitfuckery was shorter each week.
---
We brought 120 over to earthshaker and I recognise many other guilds from flamelash there. They’re already starting to complain on the forums: https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/earthshaker-flamelash-2-0/111302
---
Should be an option to let them go free into the wild.
---
Then for someone to kill them and skin them ;)
---
Yeah, I understand that. Just adding to the "Chicken or the egg" part of the discussion.
---
It will also suck for every horde player that wants to raid aq. It will never open.
---
Could make a big icon in the middle of your screen for when it has less than 2 min duration.
---
There's an addon called SmartBuff. It can re-apply buffs to yourself and party members through the press of the scroll wheel on your mouse.
---
So this is why I get ganked by lvl 60s in Desolace.
---
and yet pserver players kept saying that p2 would be a disaster.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bc6xq6/the_argument_for_adding_wsg_in_phase_2/
---
i don't get how people can defend blizzard in that regard.
---
they basically did everything wrong they could from the very start.
---
Not having Imp. Shield block is going to hurt alot when it comes to tanking any of the raid bosses or mobs with the boss tab on it due to the fact that just having 1 point in it makes it so you block twice during its duration to keep the crushing blows off of the attack table. 
---
Defiance also is needed if your target is going to be one of the first kill targets later on in tiers, but if you are really the last OT on the list then it may not be required.
---
Back in the day, Arms warriors would go 31/5/15 to try and curb the need to respec for raids and pvp, with the main pvp loss being piercing howl and enrage, but gaining last stand. But what I've been hearing lately with fights being somewhat easy, you may get away with no talents in prot.
---
I miss the old page and forum.
---
There were a few ways you could have gone, added to it, scrolled on, or the third. You picked the third. No point going any further with this. Enjoy your day.
---
With both mining and herbalism it is normal that now and then you will have to gather in zones you outlevel to keep the profession on your current level.
---
Vanilla was very casual compared to the MMOs at the time
---
If it makes u feel better... alliance aint better when they dominate the server
---
yeah, the new age kids think that BIS was invented last week, yet they still use the collected knowledge from 15 years ago
---
No
---
Yeah it's better to trust this one page with skewed data than to look at the dozens of screenshots of Ironforge with 4 bank characters and nobody else.
---
We depth investigation abnormal account!
---
Lmao these comparisons, I couldnt ress at everlook with out dying in 5 seconds and after taking ress sickness it turns out the gy was camped by 5+ horde players just the same.
---
These guys have no idea what the game experience actually sucking means.
---
Well I don't know if they do but then atleast the people trying to get PvP ranks would be discouraged from doing that. And then just add a limit to how many dishonourable kills you can have on players within a limited time before you get an automatic suspension for griefing.
---
All they need is a rogue to get the mark of the outsider and fuck shit up.
---
yes, you could heal raids by spamming one button all night, and it would auto target whoever was low
---
was great in AV.
---
and Decursive removed one debuff automatically for each keypress, so whenever a boss put them out you just spammed the button until the raid was clean.
---
You pull them even at 60 if you get too close to the edge.
---
This is your opinion, in my experience most non raiding players were chasing T0 thinking it was the shit
---
Yes

BLIZZARD HIRE THIS MAN
---
I mostly play on one realm but yes, they probably do. It's about 60:40 population-wise, but every single high level area is Horde controlled save for short periods of time when Alliance guilds choose to take over, which is rare. If you fly to Eastern Plaguelands you'll get farmed every time. If you want to quest in Tanaris prepare to corpse run.
---
You might think I'm exaggerating, and that Alliance realistically holds these areas for 40% of the time or something, but no. They're always in Horde control.
---
We'll see what happens when BGs get released.
---
yeah but how do you get to 60 and keep up gearwise by raiding while hating pve? it's 80% preparing for pvp by doing boring shit vs 20% pvp
---
What’s the Warlock discord with the best information?
---
that analogy only works if you would get rewarded for every law you "break"
---
wow servers are all virtualised these days anyway, so it would have made no difference having 3 servers with 1/3 the pop.
---
they were just planning for a population crash
---
What you don't realise is Alliance do this to low level horde too.... We just don't moan about it like little bitches.
---
The number of players with good gear per server is now much higher than it was in vanilla. My guild has more raid groups than there were guilds clearing content back in my vanilla server
---
My server has more alliance than horde, but yet the alliance pvp pool is way way smaller than the horde pvp pool. go figure
---
You realize that site only picks up info from warcraft logs right?  So if you aren't logging, you aren't seen.
---
Oh, and respond to me with an insult one more time and I will report.

Dont blame blizzard for horde camping them so hard, they leave the server.

Stonespine is 20/80 and have much worse situation.

It swings to fast therefore having a low top end damage swing. Mortal strike/Whirlwind scales off weapon damage. There are much better weapons at this level range that hit much harder.

As an Alliance player from Razorgore EU, I salute you! Keep it up. Enjoy this super unique experience
---
Caring or not caring is another thing entirely. But saying other players in the game are not people is crazy.
---
Want to play PvE on a PvP server? Just choose Horde ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
I've had this issue occasionally myself. Not just in WoW. I'm not sure of the exact reason, but it's worth checking your mouse mat is clear of dirt and hair, which could confuse the mouse sensor.
---
There were a lot of completely one sided pvp servers back in vanilla so yes it has happened before, many times.
---
Warriors are only passable at 29 because of piercing howl. If you go 17/3/0 you will be useless af.
---
Dude Midir is a bro. Love that guy. Westfall is the best.
---
Someone using vegan as an insult.. lol
---
A bit foggy too.
---
They opened them for people to transfer to low pop servers.
---
fuck off
---
To be fair, if you can use engineering items and quest trinkets, badages etc, why can't I pot? People who cried about people using pots in duels while rocking stun grenades, rocket boots and net are sad.
---
Which, if you think about it, is also a plot point of WoW's story. The only reason the big bads were defeated was because the Alliance and Horde made each other strong.
---
The real winner here is C'thun.
---
And you get discouraged, and go to an instance next time instead.
---
&gt;Did they really win though?
---
Yes, they won on every level it is possible for them to win on.
---
 - Corpse camp and remove the ability for the enemy faction to play the game. ✓
---
 - Make them so sick of this that they take the first chance they get to run away from you. ✓
---
 - Follow them to the new realms leaving a dead corpse world behind you and laugh as all the horde who stayed get flamed even though most of them aren't PvP'ers or sweaty. ✓ 
---
In the mind of an anti-social man child that looks like the perfect outcome.
---
Old posts say AGM is only 550 exp so it should be fine.
---
&gt; I am truly amazed at the level of toxicity that player bases have developed over the years.
---
At the risk of sounding old; back in my day killing people at the gy after they were corpse camped just wasnt done.
---
Really? Pretty sure it happened in vanilla too. Rarely. And possibly it's probably is pretty rare now, but it's a popular thing to upvote and get outraged about. 
---
Literally never seen toxic Gy camping in Classic or heard about it from anyone I know personally or really seen it mentioned much in social media comments, but one dude makes a reddit thread and suddenly it's an epidemic? Maybe it is, but without some stats it's hard to get too worked up about it.
---
Horde will enjoy waiting 2-3h in queue just to get graveyard camped for 5 minutes by alliance premades. There will be even less alliance in open world to kill. There will be lots of crying about how paladins are OP. Bots that have been running around since launch will still not be banned. Did I miss anything?

they fucked up almost everything from the get go but it was pretty clear that they had zero clue about classic, the meta and player behaviour, despite there being informations for over a decade

how does your bank alt hold a mount
---
Well its very common on BIS lists so I'd say most people agree that its BIS
---
you know you can still get excited and emotional as an adult, right?
---
That was a monumentally whiny post that was also incredibly hard to read. Is the OP 14 years old?
---
Nope
---
Lol I am alliance on Benediction and I feel like horde have a huge majority even though I know it’s probably not true. Horde ALWAYS have black rock mountain on lockdown
---
Maybe because in reality its a pork-needle ;)
---
Increasing res timer makes this a pain.
---
Thanks dog, likewise
---
Valor set is not bad. Lots of stamina and armor. It's perfectly fine for a starting point.
---
That said, spirit is completely useless, strength has marginal benefit for a tank, and agility - while decent - is not that prevalent on the Valor set. The Deathbone set is in fact better for tanking than Valor.
---
Why’s that? I don’t know much about specific psychologists or their studies besides my shit tier 101 psych class.

Pathetic, your server is dead, you want pvp but in the end you just farm people as if they were mob for xp regardless, and all that matters is to keep your rank. You deserve to end alone on that server , this is very brave what the OP is doing but you don't deserve it, none at all. All of this is very unfair, you won't be accounted for your actions and get away with it. This is sad.
---
I have a aura of people around me in the guild that all went R14 in vanilla. When i thought/remember that was the most hardcore and timeinvestment there was.
---
I was a PVE'er, did most of naxx, that was less of a invenstment, more of a lack of skill at that time for us.
---
It's not that the Horde is more cruel than the alliance, it's just that the horde doesn't cry as much as the alliance about pvp on a pvp server.
---
I'm just salty, I have good days too. But I just want to be realistic about things to expect for new transfers.
---
I feel like it's a pretty balanced server. Though it sucks trying to land in Everlook any time of day as horde lol..
---
Iceblock doesn't drop threat the same way vanish and feign death do - if you are top of the threat meter, iceblock and then come out, if you are top of the threat, the mobs going to come straight back to you. All IB does is allow time for someone else to get above you on threat.
---
The video is not bad, nice play. But the combat text really sucks and makes it annoying to watch. Too many add-ons imho.
---
Not a slot to waste
---
What mechanic?
---
Or just whenever alliance has control. On Herod, which is 60/40ish favored for horde, Alliance controls BRM quite a lot of the time (due to Horde's total apathy and lack of organization, alliance ranking groups just turn it into a honor factory). And during those times it takes a lot of deaths to get to BRD. 
---
And yeah in both cases the reasons are the same. People want honor, and they're just following the incentive structure of the game in a competitive environment where being compassionate means you fall behind.
---
My pleasure.

If you ever come across an addon you think isn't working or installing as it should, feel free to PM me or open an issue on Github. It may be a problem with the addon host or it may be a problem with wowman. I can't test against all cases and rely on users to let me know if they're having problems.
---
Anyone else wish the vidoe ended with him jumping in front of the oncoming train in IF? 😂
---
whereas i highly doubt the people that have been claiming to have had naxx on farm actually did; its starting to make naxx seem like some sort of unobtainable, impossible to clear, raid. it mat have been hard 15 years ago but lets be real, classic wow isnt difficult. way more people are going to be clearing naxx than back in the day.
---
I agree that allowing free faction transfers could be part of a solution, but not the cheaper subscription.  Paying more to be in a dominant faction would be seen as "pay to win."
---
Compared to (most) MMOs classic wow is more "hardcore" in the sense that the game has very little hand holding and constant continuous rewards to make sure the player isn't bored (like retail)
---
If this happened on a relatively balanced server it *would* be hella cool.
---
One faction winning through sheer numbers isn't notable.
---
bg's come out on tuesday for you, and honor resets on wednesday. just let them live in peace if that's really all you want...
---
Yeah! Stay away don’t ruin it
---
100% this
---
Why notv Zandalar Tribe?
---
Someone please record themselves singing this
---
..but it's not really an impressive victory.  It would only be impressive if the server was balanced.
---
I had this issue but fixed it, cant remember how, just know that It's not a mouse issue.
---
Try enabling rawmouseinput, and rightclick WoW.exe and do the following;
---
Properties &gt; Compatibility &gt; Check "Disable fullscreen optimization"
---
Properties &gt; Compatibility &gt; "Change settings for DPI" (Or something like this" &gt; Then check the box furthest down
---
J and J together as one.
---
The only thing “broken” about the system is that once one person started abusing it, they all started abusing it. Everyone is ranked against each other, not some “fixed” system that forces them to kill “x” amount of players.
---
Imagine being so stupid you call X 60s v one 53 “pvp”
---
TBC fixed boomkins and really just balanced out the other classes. It's why it was probably the best expansion, it was basically vanilla but the classes worked the way they were supposed to.
---
I just mean if you get a bunch of procs early no one is holding threat.
---
&gt;the ones that stayed made a guild called &lt;leftovers&gt;
---
thats rad
---
No, it's the poorly designed terrible honor system.  Every private server player tried to warn everyone about how bad it was, then you have Blizzard just straight allow overloaded servers and terrible imbalance.
---
100% the fault of Blizzard.
---
But you don't lose all your equipped/backpacked gear when you are being killed and players of your own faction can't attack you as well.
---
Notes on bshout, this threat is split between mobs in cb with you, so if 1 mob would get 200 threat, 2 mobs would get 100 each.
---
The problem is how fast people can change who they view as the in group and the out group. It is so easy for someone to shrink their definition of the in group for their own benefit. Their faction, their guild, their party, their group of friends, themselves.
---
There is a reason why "love thine enemy" is such a controversial and profound idea.
---
Just remember, you signed up for this when choosing pvp server.
---
that's a good point. I think of it as: the mana is spent when the heal completes. you start regenning after you haven't spent any mana for 5s. so if you start a cast and then jump to cancel it in the middle, the mana is never spent and it doesn't interrupt your regen.
---
Thanks for adding to it.
---
Mighty big talk coming from a green skin. It’s only a matter of time before the humans and shortmans bring out their 400 man pally raids on your tent of a capital and burn it to the ground in holy fire.
---
Does that work for all horde or just undead?
---
It's not a bug, it's something you're doing.  Did you finish your hunter pet quests all the way?  You've got to tame the 3 different pets, none of which you get to keep.  When you follow the chain through to completion then you can tame a real pet.  
---
If you've done all that, then your pet is bailing on you while you're AFK due to happiness loss.  until you get your pet to loyalty level 2 or 3 I'd dismiss it before you go AFK.
---
Having many more people is not skill.
---
but most of these aren’t cool downs? why doubly everything instead of just cds?
---
Seems legit actually.

Click on LFM KJ and you'll see the same names.

nope

Real talk, I hate movies with running zombies.
---
Rooting for you flamelash alliance.
---
Sincerely,
---
Horde from other server.
---
You can 3man run DM easy 5 times per hour easily. It has 1-2 rich thorium in the end.
---
Is there anyone that has a macro guide for warriors for stance dancing? Weapon swaps, etc? Trying to optimize my playing style!
---
Isn't there a rule to avoid instant loss?
---
Benediction is my home and I love it
---
Except you cant control that. When you see a horde you want to kill, can you kill him as you please? No. So shut up.
---
Well, he became a meme and blizzard made him an npc
---
Allright, will keep an eye out. Cheers!
---
Again, great work!
---
The addon is called Guidelime. No idea what guide plugin he's using for it though.
---
Certainly not in 2 minutes, but pets randomly despawning and going away permanently is not a thing.  Was your pet set to aggressive by chance?
---
Nah I think if the tank doesn’t need anything from strat live - reserving first orb is fair
---
I had this drop three times in the same run. I was super exited the first time though.
---
I get the impression a lot of multiboxers think everyone cares far more about their progress than they really do.
---
As a horde on Flamelash i encourage you to keep playing, mainly because you invested so much time into your characters. Obviously it sucks that most of the allies left, but BG's will come out soon, and we (as horde) just have to have a principle about not killing Allies. Personally i only really grinded Honour the two first days of P2, and have now completely stopped attacking them.  
---
A new guild (&lt;Leftovers&gt;) have formed and are reestablishing the allies and i hope they do well.  
---
If you do come back, i will gladly help you out with anything you need.
---
Sounds like a bunch of babies to me tbh. Literally nothing keeping you guys from organizing and doing the same.
---
Lol, I hope that repeating this to yourself brings you some comfort as servers fall into 80-20 oblivion.
---
Literally 99% of the nochanges idiots came form the pirated server community.
---
Regarding PVE Fury Warriors
---
What are people's thoughts on how much minimum stamina to gear for?  I have been trying to keep minimum 4000-4500 HP unbuffed.  Some other furies in my guild are down at 3000-3500 and dying on the MC fire trash packs more often.
---
This may be even more important in BWL as the trash gets tougher.
---
My server dream dust or higher is the only thing that really nets good gold
---
Big false, it came from Asmongold and his twitch followers.  I've played on private servers for a long time, know lots of people.. most hate the honor system.
---
You need sub. For each account = each bot. = profit for Activision = goal accomplished
---
Yes. Depending on your class it can be worthwhile to wait until 20/30/40 for travel forms or a mount to catch back up. Not much point running around at 1x speed at level 39  to catch mining/herbing back up. Just wait till 40 and you'll save time in the long run.
---
I've really only noticed alliance bots. I'm on a PVE server. I've seen them farming wolves on the island where feathermoon stronghold is located. There's been multiple bots farming wolves in west hinterlands between the dwarf stronghold and the farthest west troll village and there's one that farms wolves and moonkin in western hinterlands south of the farthest west troll village. Tanaris south of Gedgetzan, multiple places there.
---
Honest question... Whatever server you’re on, would you prefer it to become another Flamelash-EU situation?
---
Many players are forced to a faction because of friends
---
You use either depending on what your newest one is until like early thirties. I don't think I got 5/5 imp frostbolt until 40 or so anyway
---
&gt; hope your warrior get a juicy sword spec proc, or your 3-minute mage get a big crit, and you'll have most of the honor from said target.
---
&gt; most of the honor from said target.
---
so did you read this at all or?
---
Just rolled there and made it to level 6. We'll be taking the server back in no time.
---
This is such good advice, just buying some cheap blues off the ah every few levels to keep your weapon damage ahead of the curve makes all the difference. Yesterday I killed a mob just a few levels lower than me before intercept stun even wore off. I was so afraid of leveling I warrior because of what people said but it's a piece of cake if you can stay geared
---
Go benediction
---
I have a buddy tank (warrior) who has made close to 5k gold in the past 2 weeks farming For eye of shadow(s) in winterspring out of the bottom, he has another DPS and a Healer join and he does this until they get 3, run back put on AH rinse and repeat, he has bought his Cloudkeepers legplates, Lionheart Plans, and a SHIT ton of consumes and is chilling with 2k atm. best way to get peeps is tell them we each get an eye and we put on AH, usually tho people split after they get their own Eye (reccomend going with guildies) hope this helps
---
y
---
Can someone please explain this to me? Do they pay money?
---
just as dumb as your username
---
This, literally. I literally have to go, farm alone, on the far side of the planet from anything horde wants, far away from their flight paths ... so that it isn't worth it for a 5 man gank squad to come all the way out there. xD
---
Luckily for me I do not have this issue because I never bought the mount. I just kept saving for the epic mount.
---
Why did they want to leave so bad?
---
I usually don’t kill people if not doing PvP but it really pisses me off when you run by, in my case an alliance, while they are fight mobs and leave them be only to have them come attack you 2 mins later after you pulled a mob or two or low health. Some people are just dicks.
---
is this a joke
---
I would prefer that the populations balance out, but it's easier said than done. People have already made relationships in their current factions and become entrenched. Anyone who is a shaman cannot play the same class on Alliance, same with Paladins, so things like faction change would leave behind certain players.
---
Most people don't want to level back to 60 as they will have made progress through end game content. Blizzard is releasing content at a rapid pace, which further dis-incentivizes rerolling as you will fall behind.
---
The faction imbalance is said and done. People like to say that it should have been handled at launch, but the solutions like not letting players make horde if there are too many is bad. Want to play with your friends, sorry their faction is too full. 
---
It would take a miracle to make the faction ratios more balanced. Hopefully the introduction of BGs makes the problems bearable. Honestly though, the problem is probably never going away (or at least in Classic's lifespan).
---
Ok boomer
---
Keep in mind that it is just a video game. Not to say that this phenomenon doesn't occur in real life(we've seen it in many wars and genocides), but in the end, the worst harm you can cause someone is preventing them from playing the game.
---
¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
So many shitheads are already starting their revisionist history of “it was everyone eeeeeeelse doing the bad! Not meeeeee! It was about States Rights!”
---
Not required? They literally give you 2,5% hit
---
Too soon.
---
So never go to ironforge and stormvind as alliance? Solid advice pal.
---
If that's where the ganks are. Yes.
---
I actually tell people about you pretty often. You're one of the best fury tanks I've run with in 5 mans.
---
Did you ever kill halfus wyrmbreaker? Raiders can do it, if you can't that's on you. Here's one interrupting before the cast bar even shoes up just for fun: https://youtu.be/N7-xPgXJbyQ
---
Don't know for sure, but I assume the usual problem on PVP servers:. Horde dominated and camping zones to farm HKs so alliance can barely play the game. Asmon is alliance isn't he?
---
I say let him leave. It will show what a shit show PVP servers have become if one of if not the most popular WoW streamer says fuck it (I despise the guy but can't deny his influence). 
---
Besides, while I do enjoy classic it's far from great. It really has shown the reason why the game evolved over time (even if they went too far) having seen the more primitive form.
---
You can't neglect to spend the required amount on the startup of a business then blame the consumer for not being happy with your half assed product.
---
They specifically chose to pack the players in like rats then offer solution of free character transfers knowing that people wouldn't want to leave the friends and guild they got in the first few weeks, so they get to keep the extremely high player count on each server, keeping server running costs at minimum. That's literally the only factor that makes their actions make sense. Communities don't benefit from overcrowding, the individual player does not benefit from overcrowding. Both of these things have the quality of time reduced by it.
---
By giving us the bullshit, undesirable option of character transfer, they are trying to act like they're giving us a solution while forcing us to do what they want.
---
Do people really care about the server name more than the quality of gameplay? I think not.
---
The best way at launch for the players and community would have been a surplus of servers and quick and decisive merging when populations grew too low. But that would have meant spending a bit more on running servers and since blizzard is a company run for the stockholder who simply doesn't appreciate the longevity of a well fostered community in an online game, they are never going to create that community. That fundamental lack of understanding by the people holding the keys to our enjoyment means that classic will never work. It's always going to let us down as long as the higher ups have to pander to the idea that you NEED to spend as little as possible in order to make money. That's not how communities work.
---
i hope everyone understands this man respecced probably to have a buddy take a screenshot for this reason &gt;.&gt; his chest is a bear tank chest piece same with the trinks
---
Or 15 hours! Or 25 hours!!
---
Not because you said it more will be true man, stop being so butthurt.
---
Classic is roughly 60-40 so the queues will be there, but nothing unreasonable unless u guys too scared to face us there, in which case you will be camped on all the servers until they become Flamelash-like.
---
Specially now that there ar eonly 2 BGs.
---
To be fair blizzard has changed how buff stacking has worked twice already in classic
---
kill them all. Beware of a big comeback
---
They have been doing it for years.  Go google it.
---
Do what you feel is right, to me playing ret seems right. I play on a pvp server currently farming pre raid bis and it's fun. Ppl give me shit but they are just ignorant. What matters is your ability to have fun with the specc you play.
---
Yeh, horde picked horde because they like the horde, not because of racials.
---
That's totally why in original vanilla, when people WERE picking only on what they like, we picked alliance en masse and horde was outnumbered, whereas now when guides keep mentioning racials, who is better at pvp and such, everyone picked horde.
---
If only they had the technology to add more realms to their virtual hosting.
---
Funnel mats through neutral AH and if the gates aren't open by a certain date the faction(s) that have not completed the requirement will have it start autofilling (happened in vanilla to low pop servers).
---
NOOOO YOU ARE CRAZY FOR NOT FEELING THE SAME WAY ABOUT VIDEOGAMES NOOOO
---
As some people have pointed out, aggro is often a more limiting factor than tankiness when leveling, so I would value the owl's higher damage over the carrion bird's increased armor.
---
&gt;when people WERE picking only on what they like
---
kk
---
but you just explained whats happening? 
---
Asmongoloid wants to quit because pvp too hard for him, if he quits then a ton of ally leaves because they have no life outside of watching his stream, so of course all the streamers who love their drama is now complaining about asmon leaving because it will ruin their server.
---
Interesting argument, I believe I have been defeated and concede to your superiority.
---
60-40 in favor of Horde is also very bad for Alliance.  
---
Horde players are more aggressive, so for "balanced" server it should be 60/40 in Alliance favor.
---
Nahh it wouldnt be a kodo then.
---
I played on a low pop tbc pserver and im pretty sure rdruid/warr killed the arena scene
---
30+ minute snoozefests just arent fun
---
From where? Where do you see \~1000 allies lvl 60 shifting to flamelash?
---
Hotkey your sets with wardrobe or similar and swap to stam gear on trash, since no one cares about trash dps anyway. Also put invincibility pots on your bar, works as a detaunt and temporary threat drop if you manage to pull threat on trash.
---
On bosses you should ofc wear your big boy gear and spend pot cd on rage. Make friends with or pay a healer to give you extra heals.
---
I mean, 10% might not sound like a lot, but it may be enough to amplify existing imbalances to an extent that causes issues.
---
That said, I think the main contributor to the current imbalance is the fact that horde racials tend to be better for PvP.
---
This is wishful thinking to the extreme. You're using "sociopath" in the sense of "Bad person" which is dumb.
---
And the idea that non-sociopaths feel empathy towards everyone they come across is just funny. That's not how that works. Lack of empathy towards anyone you think of as an enemy is normal human behaviour.
---
If you want someone to do really heinous shit to someone else, what you need to do is 1) convince them that the target is their enemy, and 2) come up with a reason for doing the heinous shit. Step 2 is sometimes entirely unnecessary. Sometimes it's just that there's stuff people already wanted to do to someone, but their empathy wouldn't let them, but without that constraint they'll just do it for fun.
---
Wow satisfies this quite nicely.
---
1) The other faction is the enemy. The game tells you this in plenty of ways.
---
2) List of reasons to do heinous shit to the other factions includes the following:
---
\*They are worth honor if you kill them. Honor gives you rewards.
---
\*They did thing X to them so it's fair to do it back.
---
\*They did the thing X not to them but to other members of their faction, so it's fair to do it back.
---

What are the best SOLO farming spots for warriors (open world or instance)?  Trying to earn gold for LH and Epic Mount. I’m okay making 20-30g an hour if that’s the best option for solo farming.
---
Thanks all! :)
---
Worst thing is hes completely right to correct it.
---
He's just playing the game as it is and complains because the way it is, is shit. Here my example: I also do everything to get honor, I didn't go to IF since I'm not a rogue and can't be arsed, but I will corpse camp, FP camp, and if I see someone with ress sickness I will take the free honor. That doesn't mean I like the state of the game. That doesn't mean I don't want balanced factions, nobody enjoys this wPvP shitshow, so we complain for blizzard to do something. These shitty things are directly encouraged in the game - this IS the game, but we don't want it to be that way. 
---
The core of this argument comes from the difference where you think the player is at fault, and I think player is not at fault at all.
---
Pretty Much on Herod it was mostly fine except searing gorge for some reason there were always and continue to be dick heads there.  It’s all these sweaty try hards who will inevitably never make rank 14.  I bet there will continue to be more and more angry posts as people can’t rank up in a few more weeks.
---
Do you want me to make outrageous claims like you and call it an  argument? cause where i'm from that's not what an argument is.
---
You set your hearthstone to places that are really close to world PvP.   As soon as the BG is over you hearth and find people to gank.
---
Nah, more like "it's purple so it's obviously better"
---
Hotw/ns my friend... only respec to balance spec and back when doing certain farms like mara or dm solo which make way more money than the respec cost if you at least do them a few hours before speccing back
---
Are you saying they should go out and farm their pre-bis whenever they want to switch spec? Having alternate gear in the bank isn't weird, not sure why this guy is being trashed on.
---
"Our language" 
---
England would like a word.
---
Who says the mount is dying? He's just releasing it.
---
BGs will always be more honor per hour in a good group.
---
It’s just a meme mate
---
I don't get this. How are all these people getting camped even to the graveyard? I've leveled both a 60 alliance and 60 horde during the honor farming (Alliance 55-60 and Horde 48-60) and didn't have any camping to the extent I see reddit post about. Yes I died dozens of times in a 30 minute span but not once was I graveyard camped.
---
I feel like this would only happen in specific zones like Thorium point so using my brain I wouldn't try to level there.
---
I’d seen the all scorch, all pyro, all dps Strat then assign one mage to keep up scorch and just watch for threat. 
---
You can chain thru your combustions to keep the ignite rolling that’s a fun one as well.
---
Asmon riled up Horde before Phase 2 by saying the Ally were going to run the server.
---
Horde guilds become super intense to fight back, and specifically going after Asmon and his guilds.
---
Asmon gets upset that the Horde is actually fighting back, and since he already maxxed geared all his chars super quickly by funneling gear to them doesn't feel like playing.
---
Asmon starts to play classic much less and goes back to retail, making the ally feel betrayed since he was a major cause of this war in the first place.
---
Salem witch trials make a bit more sense now, don't they?
---
Yeah, that's why i said to consider the eat/drink time, if a warrior would make up for the time lost while the warlock is drinking.
---
Recent stats show Alliance having the majority (at 60): https://wowclassicpopulation.com/overview?lastSeen=7&amp;minLevel=60
---
and even bigger majority for all level:
---
https://wowclassicpopulation.com/overview?lastSeen=7
---
But it is probably fair to say it's all about equal
---
Great to hear! I relate a lot to your story. I'm on Noggenfogger alliance eu since launch of classic and leveling in a slower pace (lvl 45 now). Population vice i think noggen is great, it's not too hard to find groups as alliance and I feel the spirit is nice. It's just tons of hordes where ever you go and feels like alliance is declining. Hope we can turn it around!
---
Cool story bro. You would be so behind in my raids.
---
Only because they didnt put the starup costs forward and give us enough servers to develop the communities we could have had.
---
But not believing in it they fulfilling that disbelief by tripping it up at the starting line.
---
Rolling ignites shouldn't be in this patch as far as I am aware.
---
Razorgore EU has a healthy and active PvP and PvE community on the Alliance side. We are outnumbered though (probably 40/60). I think it would be a great home for you guys
---
Skull flame won’t do nearly enough dps by itself to use for aoe farming, you need something else(consecrate/more reflect damage) or else your kills times will be awful
---
Hunter, by far. Mages have AoE grinding but this won't be nearly as useful while questing. A good Hunter can level and never stop to eat or drink.
---
Hunter is the king of solo leveling. Unless you play on a dead server then mage AoE grind is better.
---
Is farming elemental fire in Un Goro okay too? From my experience I don’t get ganked in Un Goro
---
Warriors have more downtime leveling than warlocks.
---
Rolling ignites are probably not in this patch cycle. The damage was also given by the last mage to crit. They take over the ignore cycle if you will.
---
I lost it at the Human Female behind the window saying ''Don't go! It's fake news! Stay and fight!''   
---
Basically me in a nutshell. Our Horde guild still going strong with a big coalition, much more room to grind and do World Bossses, alot more recruiting potential. I bet the people who transfered must feel stupid now, or regret their decision at least. Server is everything except dead, just got more room now with the tryhards gone.
---
I AM VERY SERIOUS.
---
Sort of reminds me, back in the day, of the riots that happened in Star Wars Galaxies when the devs nerfed group xp. It was, I can't remember, maybe a solid week or two of outrage and protest--both on-forum and in-game. Some news outlets even picked it up at the time. I remember thinking that it was both miserable but very exciting to see so many people cause a ruckus.
---
Of course, that was just ONE of SWG's many debacles...
---
ZT is already alliance favored
---
This is really bad advice. Defensive Stance increases all threat generation by 30% while lowering damage and damage taken by 10%. Yes you want to stance dance, but you want to be in Defensive Stance often.
---
But it doesn't calculate at all. Now the bug released and i have 2 HK but in reality ive killed maybe 40.
---
? They leave because they think they are being griefed inside their cities because they are pve players on a pvp server.
---
Pretty much what you already said. 
---
Swifty already left Faerlina and now Esfand and Asmongold are leaving. Asmongold is 100% leaving at the end of the month like he promised when he created the guild &lt;Faerlina Unchained&gt;. If it doesn’t bring enough people to level and play Alliance then he’s switching to PvE and/or going back to retail. There’s rumors StaySafe is leaving too. 
---
But yeah if they leave then there will be another exodus to whatever server those streamers go to because A) people won’t want to be on Faerlina if it’s so Horde dominated and B) people want to go where the playerbase goes and have that community around there. Nobody wants to feel left behind or in a server that feels like a ghost town. 
---
I’ve already given up on Faerlina and have alts on Heartseeker and been playing retail. But yeah if they leave I’ll be leaving too and I think it’s safe to say so will most of the Faerlina alliance population.
---
The virgin passer vs the chad reserver.
---
Its because they "gave up" on flamelash and now are considered weak

It's not that it's "widely refuted", but rather that it's a well-known piece of psychological knowledge. With so many minds being fully aware and well-versed in such a topic, there is bound to be a lot of variance of opinion.  
---
Some people see holes in the study that aren't exactly evident to others. This doesn't mean that the entire theory itself is entirely wrong. It just means that there are millions of brains, all of them combing the theory for any hole they can find, and then when that gets talked about, enough people are aware and knowledgeable about the theory that it has a good chance at sticking.  
---
I hear this same attack against Jungs work. Jung developed a great model for understanding psych. It works. But it's not perfect. But it's also not completely off-base.
---
do them with who?
---
No they leave because there id no chance in hell horde will let them level to 60 so they can pvp on  equal terms
---
You can flag yourself for PvP and turn it off with a 5 minute delay
---
I say druids zero downtime and move around map at good speed.
---
I agree, I mean I think you are making it bigger than what OP meant with the "sick fascination".   
---
But I agree that this isn't "really cool". Imagine being one of those few players. Blizzard will fix it, not the players. In the end it's a server the Horde basically owns and Alliance players left witih a handful toughing it out and forming one massive guild.  
---
The guild thing is probably the coolest part. The rest? Sucks. It will probably go down in WoW history, but I wouldn't say it will be anything special like the rest.
---
Inb4 this meme is executed

Yeah, and I read this about just about every mid-level psychological study that is taught through an education system.    
---
It's almost like psychologists are pompous assholes who all think they are the smartest of all their peers.
---
“Important incident in the history of wow” XD
---
Because your idea of RP is superior to others idea of RP. I exclusively play on RP servers since vanilla, and character names have NEVER been what the server is about. 
---
Some ppl just need to power trip, imo.
---
&gt;I hate myself for knowing this...
---
Why? You can know all that without watching asmon for hours. Also if you enjoy wow streams my guess is that it is one of the more entertaining one.
---
We all know it wont im just so frustrated this morning. Even at 8am roving deathballs everywhere
---
Psychology isn't a hard science. There are no objective correct/incorrects.
---
Correlation doesn't equal causation.  You are bright enough to know this if you set you bias aside.
---
Really depends on server economy and playstyle. If you're making money comfortably, then sure. If not, no.
---
Same with alliance on our boats, they are constantly outside undercity, camp Mojache, Everlook, and Kargaths choke point. Alliance dominate pvp
---
Are you seriously saying you are happy to be on a server which is 99/1 horde alliance? No wonder alliance had to bail on flametrash
---
Never ate so far on my warrior and did bandage less than 30 times. :D he's 28 now

Always? No. Should be used on tanks too. How many people have you killed with the ss “strategy?”

You've found your family, my fellow Tauren... and your lastname couldn't be more epic. Now rise, Proudstrider, and defend our mother nature as brothers.
---
I thought the BGS Are cross realm?
---
The point is that slaughtering people outside of your tribe is not anti-social or asocial behaviour. It's actually pretty normal.  
---
Not to mention that video game violence isn't comparable in any way to real life violence.

Yes, they are 60 too. What I saw was 0 and I know it's an estimate when you actually see anything.
---
Right, hence ALL servers.
---
Are there any dungeons I can solo for good gold though? SM Cath maybe?
---
I thought about rolling on some Horde dominated server as alliance to do some PvP. I might gonna create a shadow priest or similar in due time.

yeah bro just organize and you'll win that 3v7 for sure! actually braindead

Elemental fires go for about 4g each.

As long as the total ally players a cross these 5 serveres dont change then the Queue wont be affected at all? 
---
So if the Ally who escaped Flamelash is still in these 5 realm then the Queue wont be affected.
---
KITTY! we fought a couple of times in the world. Sad to see that you stayed behind. Good luck forward on flamelash
---
2 layers on only a couple servers like Faerlina, remember when they started displaying "Layered" in the server selection screen? There were almost no layers left by November 12.
---
Between ALL servers it is, plenty of data to support between Warcraft logs, realm pop sites and pvp rankings
---
Incendius is ally majority
---
Asmongold is a douche and he power geared all of his characters and realized he can’t beat the horde.. I say good riddance to him
---
If you want boosts it's best to have a full group, so a high level and 4 people of similar level suitable for dungeon. You'll get more exp per run and share the boost cost.
---
I thought it was.  Maybe I'm confusing it with Herod or Stalagg.  I've heard however that even on the ones that aren't like 5:1 Horde that the Horde usually have camped the ally areas to farm HKs.  So even if it's not dominated, the Horde are making it so Alliance can't really play.
---
I'm 100% sure people would use that to massively troll opposing players. The problematic thing would be healers who have the debuff - even though they have little mana, you still have to kill them if you don't want to heal other (non-rezz-sicked) players.
---
If that is true, then blizz could easily balance every pvp server by allowing the pve horde players to xfer to a pve server.
---
&gt;#nochanges would have made that horrible.
---
It hasn't been changed what are you talking about
---
It seems that one is with macro, the other not. I guess that for the sap it’s target enemy sap
---
For cheap shot might me a stop auto attack, etc...
---
Wow a post from a alliance in which they aren't the lady yelling at the cat.
---
What happened on flamelash?
---
Spot on. Alliance are officially the weaker faction, no question about it. Faced with a little diversity and population imbalance and they imploded themselves by running to greener pastures. If no one left in the beginning of all this it would have worked out fine. The alliance players did this to themselves on almost all large servers. 
---
Horde win, the end.
---
As he should. 
---
Well, if this is how I go down in the books I'm about it.
---
People can laugh at this as a joke and shit all they want, but at least this is a solution which isn't aimed at fucking one side over vs the other.  It is an incentive based solution which also minimizes the impact to the game itself.
---
Obviously it never happens because Blizzard isn't going to take an idea which is going to slash revenue, but it's an idea.

I've tweaked it quite a bit since yesterday morning. This was basically fresh installed.
---
No.  They didn’t.  Everyone LOVED the blood plague.  It was an awesome event that we knew would get fixed because it was a bug and it didn’t last long at all.  Maybe 3 days tops.  People were laughing all day in chats. 
---
This has been months and there is no way to fix it easily. Totally different situation.
---
[hurr durr the standing page existed in vanilla. here is me at R14](https://imgur.com/Oj0UqIq)
---
The horde ganked every guild on every zone and made them unable to get outside ironforge. Then the horde started to siege it with rogues and death squads roaming inside ironforge killing anyone pvp tagged and the flight masters so nobody could leave. Blizzard gave free char transfers from there to somewhere else and all the alliance left except 1 guild.
---
Now the horde has more people in IF and SW than thunderbluff
---
Wait people actually thought Horde players were sociopaths? If alliance has the dominating numbers then it would be them just being as bad.  
---
It's just gamers being gamers. We tbag, talk shit, do anythign we can to "show off" once you kill another player. Gamers love being toxic, or maybe everyone does. BUt you play any game? Toxicity is a thing.
---
It mabye have become better, I just know how it was before.. And that was a nightmare to watch hahaha. It was alot about some people-.. you mabye know them becuse they got a very bad reputation on the server and I dont enjoy to watch that.
---
At this point u guys don't need mains at auction house... Do U instead become nomadic moving hearth from inn to inn hoping the horde don't discover your new hubs? It's like a game of walking dead... Leave bank Alts unflagged and just move hearthstones to new locations
---
Dunno. I think it's just that Stonespine didn't have right people from the beginning.  
---
Still remember when 20+ Hordes just run from Gates of IF into Deeptram and 50+ Alliance players near bank didn't even try to interfere.
---
I rerolled to another server and the moment when I wrote in chat that I saw a Horde player in Redridge - i receive 5 whispers from people, asking is he attacking me and offering to login with their level 60 to help)
---
Yeah, a social experiment on how you can bring back a 15-year-old game but not the community which made that game great.  Despite all the #NoChanges whining and screaming, it turns out the community was the biggest change of all.

---
The graph shows that for the past six weeks the Horde numbers are between 150% and 200% that of the Alliance. That looks pretty one-sided to me.
---
Mining, at this moment, is probably the hardest gathering profession to level.  Servers have such high populations that it can be pretty rare to find nodes.  You can level to 150 or so just by smelting ores you buy off AH, and I recommend that if you have the money.  copper,tin,bronze,silver,iron,gold.  After that, you don't get any skills from smelting and you've got to do it the old fashioned way.
---
As a 60 I dropped alchemy/herbalism and leveled mining and it was the hardest time I've ever had leveling mining from 200 to 300.  I think you need 255 to mine small thorium veins, and 275 for rich thorium.  Getting to 255 is the hardest part because you have to just mine mithril even though it's green.  
---
There is a mine near the entrance of blasted lands, just turn left off the path up the hill.  Its a big mine-cavern with level 48ish mobs.  Unless someone just cleared it, it always has 3 or 4 mithril and small thorium ore spawns.  I highly recommend you park your character there and mine what you can whenever you can.  If you're level 50 or less there's going to be lots of killing to get to the nodes, so its a lot easier as a 60 to run past most of them mobs.  The thing about the cave is that it dependably has mithril and thorium to mine 80% of the time.
---
it would be a pretty lame come back story...Could you imagine watching idk the lotr or harry potter films in a binge so excited to see the main character overcome all the adversities all the trials and tribulations for it all to culminate in a draw?

the heroic strike "glitch" or whatever is absolutely stupid, and it makes an already super strong pve class even stronger and promotes shitty gameplay of hovering your heroic strike. But it is not a bug, it was in vanilla, whether or not it was intended to happen in vanilla I really don't know
---
You literally can’t walk around Ironforge without getting killed as soon as you leave the crowded areas.
---
Ohhhh
---
I transferred off incendius with my guild and I can't even find a ubrs group at peak times on our destination server
---
Faerlina is Alliance dominated, but you still crying.
---
All of this proves that a great number of people rolled in the wrong type of server.
---
You're blind then lmao
---
People that are 46 years old and live in their moms basement shares this opinion.
---
I ejoy mograine.
---
At least people share my opinion ;)
---
Gamers have become so much more toxic over the years. Just about anything I play if it involves PvP you'll have people Tbagging or doing some emote on your body.   
---
Dying in a GY \*shouldn't\* be an issue, you'd think at that point "That's enough" but yet the assholes find it funny to just keep camping the same player and then probably mock them when they log off.
---
likewise transferring off of a pvp server and NEVER being able to come back can suck if all the real problems you had with it disappear with BGs
---
Last I checked EF was about 60:40 A/H unless the site was wrong
---
Not that I'm aware of. If you have herbalism you can do herb runs in maraudon for 30 ghost mushrooms an hour
---
The HS bug was actually in from Day 1 and was only fixed in Cata when HS was removed IIRC.
---
Gnomes are the horde of the alliance
---
Nope. Set to defensive and i was in an inn. Not likely to get attacked there
---
Ahh thank you!
---
I'd bet Horde still camp the graves and flightmasters even then.
---
If it was still loyalty 1, it doesn't take long, more than 2 mins though.
---
Not really no, i see who ever won key as the guy who won chest
---
if you have multiple keys then you should roll for who gets to turn it in
---
150% is 60-40, which is what I've been saying all along and is the average on all servers.
---
Yea I don't really understand it either :(
---
For alliance - and even harder for horde now haha
---
Incendius is doing fine, don’t roll there if you’re trying to help out
---
Incorrect, it can drop any time but you just can't use it til 16 :)
---
My level 11 twink in the making has it in its bags
---
Our first MT got his Garr binding week 2! he did 5 raids with us getting full phase 1 bis then ends up breaking both of his legs IRL, quits the game because people joked about it on discord and now our OT is our MT with 0 bindings.
---
In original vanilla i had a friend who had two epic mounts. One day, he was on his 60% mount. 
---
Turns out he and his gf got in an argument and she deleted his epic mounts.
---
I know i wouldn’t. One of the worse xpacs and is carried by Arthas hype alone.
---
Alliance cities have better aesthetic for roleplay, so RP servers tend to swing that way when it comes to the faction split.
---
Good try horde at flamelash!
---
It's also pretty difficult when the West continue to destabilize their countries for profit like they've done for decades under their current paradigms and centuries before that under more overt ones.
---
Having popped in to see what the fuss is about this isn't faction specific.  Seems some of the Ali leaving the realm decided to make horde side spam bots with salty msgs for the horde left behind.  WoW just brings the gimp out in some people I guess
---
You are really worked up about this.  Why not take a break, visit with the family, go outside.
---
Your 'facts' are nothing but anecdotal evidence of your experience.  My experience is the exact opposite.  If you want to cry to Blizz, sit in Ironforge, and clog this subreddit with your negativity then do so.  It's your time to waste.
---
PS...if you don't see how insulting your are being you might have a reading comprehension problem.

#gobacktoretail

To be honest I was raiding in a guild that had server third on Naxx back then, but I couldn't dodge DB if my real life would depend on it. It got to a point where the raid lead would announce a DB by telling everyone to move away from me :(
---
Your boy punkrat is bein the Jesus Christ of classic wow. Or tryin to be. I hate that I know it too but goddamn is it entertaining.
---
This is why I  don't care for PvP servers. I don't have time to spend running to my corpse for hours.  
---
Things were different back then, but now I'm adult and there are hundreds of other games I can/want to play. I'll stick to PvE 100%. Battlegrounds are enough PvP for me.
---
&gt;yet they still use the collected knowledge from 15 years ago
---
You're lying to yourself if you believe that Classic and Vanilla had the same number of guilds with decked out gear. I'll wager more guilds have already cleared MC than ever did in all of Vanilla. That shit is speed run by newly dinged 60's. That NEVER happened. You're lying to yourself if you believe that Vanilla had this many well informed players. Completely utterly wrong if you were around back then. The information existed, but very few people were as knowledgeable back then as they are now. The _average_ players in Classic is 10 times more geared and 10 times more knowledgeable about the meta/game than in Vanilla.
---
Ah yes so the people who didn't do anything wrong should be punished for people mass leaving?
---
That sounds ideal, lol
---
I really think "won" is the wrong word.  
---
They always heavily outnumbered alliance, and that is what they "did" to win.
---
is blizztard shit posting now? xD
---
blizztard is 100% at fault, anyone with a functional brain couldve seen this coming.
---
i think the 2 factions call forth very specific breed of people
---
What I remember being one of the big problems was getting people to group up for it. It had a relatively high cost to be attuned that was made easier through rep with AD. My guild was raiding for a while and then got too small to do the 40 mans so we would band together with another guild or get pugs. But you couldn’t really get pugs for Naxx.
---
Edit: I meant we would get pugs for attempts at AQ40, BWL. We worked with the another guild for Naxx.
---
Ok Zoomer
---
The Horde won the war.
---
Ohhhh I know exactly which people you're talking about xD. Yeah they've been banned for a while now and the place is much much better. Honestly I'd say join and say hello! Everyone there is pretty friendly and it's also the place where we announce the server events and stuff
---
The thing is most of the heavy pvpers migrated to Earthshaker or other realms. This would just punish those who had little to do with the actual situation.
---
&gt; anime trope to summon an outsider to save them  
---
Bad News Bears is my favorite anime
---
Well, I'd use imp magma/fire nova totems as well.
---
Arugal is 65-35 or 60-40 at most, but Alliance control BRM like 90% of the time, because they have one guild of people that are willing to sit there farming HK pretty much morning till night. Getting into MC/BRD unless you bring a full raid+ usually requires 2-5 deaths every time.
---
And even when two full raid groups go into MC, the campers still kill a decent number just because of how many sappers and coordinated mages they have
---
I try to organize resistance on my server, but halfway through people start complaining about not getting honor and leave. Super frustrating since these aren't people puahing ranks anyway.
---
I think you mean demoshout
---
honestly, I think you're right. I'm really worried long-term for any "legacy" servers is blizzard keeps ignoring how powerful classes are in end-expansion patches and *also* using content that has been nerfed. 
---
I still believe tbc heroics *should* be difficult, but it's hard to say because I'm sure my pserver experience is coloring that opinion. I do know I had much more fun when servers had harder content.
---
by character count it's actually fairly accurate, by game account it is not unless you compare the 15 million peak to the number of accounts that were in vanillanaxx
---
Lol. “Unskilled gay vegans”
---
Never tank in battle zerker unless you need sweeping strike/thunderclap/serker rage/whirlwind.
---
It’s the only decent scene in what is an abysmal sequel to a fantastic film.

---
Alliance dominates wPvP on incendius, stop your crying.
---
Awesome video.
---
Welcome to the game theory. 
---
When it comes to the honor system, once a few people start abusing it, everyone else will be worse off. And since the system is non-cooperative, naturally, the only rational decision is to abuse the system too.
---
You CANNOT convince other players to stop, as you have no power over them.
---
So, yes, in a way you are "forced" to "farm" honor, since otherwise you will inevitably fall behind.
---
Both factions have to complete repeat quests before the AQ gates will open. The Horde's only hope at this point is that they can put the necessary turn-ins on the neutral AH at discount prices for the alliance to buy.
---
Threat, mitigation, cat, healer, and if you crazy oomkin, 5 sets :P but threat-cat are similar
---
Despite that is not that difficult to get gear. For all feral-related sets you can get pretty good gear from dungeons. Pure mitigation gear is vendor trash for the rest of the classes, and for damage/threat you may have some competition from rogues, but since you can tank and make your own groups with ease, you can avoid them.
---
Most difficult gear to get are necks and rings from raids (cause people usually give them to warriors) and bis healer gear, where you gonna compete with the rest of the healers. But even then some of those pieces are leather so you compete with pallies/shammies but not priests.
---
&gt; Some, likely a lot, of people looked up, saw Horde was at an advantage and rolled Horde because of it
---
The majority of people playing now rolled before day 0, so this can't possibly be true.
---
Thank you
---
I heard all the guilds left and everyone who stayed behind banded together. Cant say for certain though, as an NA player I cant even be a tourist
---
Still outnumbered quite a bit, but not as bad as some others.
---
2 rings, satyr bow and d.dagger and you got the necessary hit at least. If you go with DS, thats 2 hit on top. Or e.g. blackmist wrists and that strat head for another 2 hit. Its definitely not that bad.
---
Simulating with 1min in the bloodmoon sheet. 
---
Why its a thing? Because I got lucky in a rag fight and was top of the rogues with the worst gear of them thanks to a lot of procs. Its just a gamble.
---
Edit: Hell, even shadowpanther has this listed in his BiS set lists
---
Yeh people wonder why they are disliked but the entire first day or two was just constant spamming of stuff like “LOL this is Flamelash now we’re taking over! Lmao”.
---
I dont like the world pvp so I aint comming on those event... or I like if its a fair fight not 5v1 :P, I already have a 60 on ally side so I get some info from guild :)
---
Invuln pots are a good idea, i'll have to pick some of those up.
---
I still think Trash DPS is important since guilds are going for faster clears and warcraft logs shows the entire raid damage.
---
There was always a huge population issue on flamelash; not a "little" population imbalance. When the honor system kicked in an already horrible situation got unimaginable bad. It was inevitable.
---
A problem I noticed some time before honor was that horde never held back on the ganking when they realized they were in superior numbers. They had barely any retaliation to fear. Before that point if I left the horde alone they would mostly leave me alone. That is just one of the reasons why balance is important.
---
but in retail you have the whole cross faction thing and world pvp isnt really a thing. its kinda massively different you dont need the other faction in retail.
---
The game gives no honor for killing greys. I've been camped by 10+ 60's numerous times while leveling and it gives nothing to them.
---
Umm no, but points for effort.  This shit was way before that gen. Try the 70/80s
---
Yes, I've seen quite many of the posts you are referring to up to the point that it's annoying to read them even for me. And a good number of resulting spiteful backlash from Alliance, there's some real "faction identity" going on to put it mildly - but hey, I kind of get it too. 
---
Sad to see, but I think this is what the marvels of internet anonymity gets you. Meh.
---
I hated Barrens the first time around, but I've grown to like it quite a bit for some reason. Elwynn, westfall and duskwood are all awesome though, so it's a tough comparison..
---
This game needs better streamers than Asmon. But to be fair, I'm more interested in playing it myself than watching someone else do it.
---
You're not only wrong, you're stupid.
---
Get the shadowcraft 6pc instead, the set bonus makes it better than the "pre-BiS"!
---
Nope. Phase 2 usually lasts around a minute or so and we still don't get any deep breaths.
---
You can get almost +500 hp from enchants.  Don't forget head/leg.  +8 str enchants are much more expensive than +100 hp anyways.
---
that sounds so cool, good for you! I would transfer there if I could
---
Always fun to duel someone and they use grenades and a shadow reflector and they still lose. Just makes me realize how trash they are.
---
This should read more like an enlistment ad. Your king needs YOU.

This works in theory, but there are ways that better mages can hold the ignite more often than others, so it doesn't work in practice :)

---
Isn't that basically the ending of the Matrix?
---
I agree no one is sociopath and this behavior true both ally and horde, but from my personal experience horde playing more mindless, toxic. 
---
Im playing on Nogger ally side ( lvl 32 and 54) and playing on Razorgore horde (35 and 47). While leveling my ally chars i got constantly killed, camped, farmed before and after phase 2 even if I worth no honor. Many skull level player killed me on sight, spammed 'go retail'.
---
On the other hand while leveling my horde chars ally players left me alone most of the time. True they killed me many times but not on sight. I lived through many Camp Mojache raid where they havent even hit me, I seen many Gadgetzan massacre. I worth no honor so they not bothering me.
---
So yeah, from my experience theres a clear diffence.
---
How to make money from people’s nostalgia?  Been there done that

Yes, and I've met 5 different &lt;Death and Taxes&gt;'s all filled with original members.

I've been playing melee classes in WoW for a loooooooong time and have always disliked magic classes. So here i am in classic playing a Forsaken shadow priest, totally out of my comfort zone.
---
Never really encountered any Alliance in anger until this morning when some dude kept jumping me when i was questing, evidently waiting until i was low ish on mana...although i'm not sure being full mana would've made much difference.
---
Anyway, I'm only lvl 28 so don't have VE or Shadowform yet....how do i actually PvP in this thing?
---
It feels like as soon as something gets within melee range i'm screwed as they can just run behind me and really do anything about it as i need to be stood still, looking at my target to cast everything apart from SWP.
---
Sure i can fear them, but that only buys me 10-12 secs until they'll on me again then i have to wait 20 secs until i can fear again which seems like a painfully longtime and is the only ability i have atm to try and keep enemies at bay...unlike my mage where i feel much more in control with a pile of frost abilities, sheep and blink.
---
hi friend i have no idea who u are but thank you very much for the invitation to ur guild but i will have to decline for now good luck and have fun, bye!
---
A rogue can tank AQ with TF?
---
No, Arms is better for 5-man dungeon content even at 60
---
sure, sure.
---
But youre horde so you deserved it
---
October 3rd:
---
&gt; The last time a server in this region had more than three layers was the first week of September, and almost all realms reached two layers shortly after that. This includes high population realms such as Faerlina, which has had only two layers for three weeks now.
---
&gt; Tuesday, November 12 – All Realms to One Layer
---
&gt; With scheduled weekly maintenance beginning at 7:00 a.m. PST on Tuesday, all WoW Classic realms will be set to a single-layer. We expect some realms listed above to experience long queues after this step. We especially encourage players on Arugal , Faerlina , Herod , and Whitemane to use the Free Character Move service to avoid excessive queues.
---
Firstly, where's your source for "I know for a fact that it was at least 3 layers on Fairbanks"? From what Blizzard said, "almost all realms in the US region reached 2 layers after the first week of September", which was 2 whole months before they collapsed everyone down to 1 layer. Secondly, every previously "Layered" server had queues after they combined the layers on November 12th, and even [a few servers that had been forced to single-layer by then](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/layered-realms-update-oct-22/340582) (such as my own, Skeram). The excess population from combining servers went into queues to wait in line to play the game.
---
The real issue is that someone would need to do this in the first place.  DHKs are stupid.
---
Sneaky PVP update?
---
I did not get the memo, but now the dishonorable buff gets reapplied when the other faction attacks you and the yeti from wintersprings is not civilian anymore.
---
Is there any more updates added the last week?
---
*laughs in warlock*
---
It's a pvp server. You can't.
---
It is not, per the stats
---
Link to those dive guides?
---
That’s such a shit situation dam...it’s gonna take a lot to attempt to even rebuild the alliance on Flamelash
---
Because 1.12 had cross-realm battlegrounds and hadn't got LFR.
---
You obviously never played vanilla so keep your dumb opinion to yourself thx
---
Ok but that's just because we're in the digital era now. Information spreads much more quickly and efficiently. Back then you had to look at raw text files on GameFAQs. Now there's a dozen wikis with screenshots and video.
---
Bitching about this is like amazon tribes crying that civilization has guns. There's nothing you can do about it! Get with the times
---
"A bunch of them". Ignoring PvE servers there are 2 (could argue 3) lol. 
---
And they are in the fifties (like 55-58).
---
Now that just is not true. ”Unable to get outside Ironforge” lol how come Horde was equally unable to level in open world?
---
But did they? Did Blizzard? It certainly wouldn't appear so by their reactive approach vs. being proactive. That hindsights gotcha seeing clear but "everyone"  certainly did not know it would be like this.
---
And you would be wrong.
---
 Oh, I stopped playing WoW Classic like in October and I was on Flamelash. Now you just made me wanna go back to join you cuz FOR THE ALLIANCE!
---
I believe they are ffa. I'm ally and I have memories of hearing gladiator lossa say "shadowmeld" but I might have my wires crossed with mercenary battlegrounds.
---
4 of the right kind as well... please RNG
---
Your class has superior pvp racials. Which means you can never have a fair fight with an alliance player which means you need to pay your grief tax.
---
Obvious troll is obvious
---
&gt;your pretty little arse
---
Thank you...I needed that.
---
&gt; Why would you want your big bad ultra super legendary weapon of doom that you got from defeating a world-ending terror to be subpar in a brawl with another player because it doesn’t have any “pvp power”.  
---
Do you have a minute to talk about our lord and savior, Shadowmourne?
---
Taurens have superior PvP racials?
---
Deviate Delight is great server. We could use a few more horde but the balance isn’t that bad if you come here with a social attitude and enjoy pvp. Its like 60/40 maybe more for Ally
---
If its easy, more than 1% of warriors would achieve it.
---
Wow nice 1-9 keybinds and klicking half the stuff and backpaddling. I didnt see such bad gameplay forrealy long time, not gonna lie. You must be afraid of bgs because if you dont outnumbr them you are clearly going to lose playing like this
---
Right games change and people change with them. But the entire point of classic World of Warcraft was to revert changes made over the years and bring the game back to what it was. Not to cherry pick aspects of it and keep or make only "good" changes.
---
Every change blizzard has made they were able to justify in some way, internally or externally, and that lead to the degradation of the game to what retail currently is.
---
Mind of the common WoW gamer:
---
In PvP it is about pure zerg. You usually do not care about who was in bg with u because without you they would have lost anyway.
---
In PvE it is about the opposite. Without you it usually would have been way easier.
---
Oof  I ran it at 15 and didn't get it for some reason but could have been because my bags were full
---
I went to Bloodfang while the guild went to Earthshaker and it's so nice on a server that has less people. No roaming death squads rolling over everything 24/7 in the most random ass places. Just finding the right kind of guild is always a bitch.
---
you're right, I didn't see it that way, the horde won on flamelash. that's really cool to think about
---
remindme! 2 days
---
are people really still no changes for a worse experience?  we're 3 months in c'mon
---
Not really. Rank 14 is 0.01%, right? That means only the most active pvper will get that. With 320 people, is Ranks 11-13 even possible? Wouldn't 2nd place be placed in Rank 10? Or am I not understanding the rank system properly?
---
&gt;Siphon Life/DrainLife with Life Tap
---
all of which are a net negative in terms of overall hp/mana even with improved life tap factored in.  Nothing is for free and eventually you run out of resources.
---
Stamina and a 1min CD stun/interrupt
---
Sunk cost fallacy. Either you play and have fun or you don’t. How much time you’ve invested is a non factor. 
---
If playing on a PvP server is not fun for you, you have two options: quit and hope for paid server transfer in the future or re-roll. 
---
WoW as with everything in life is about the journey, not the destination. If your main were to magically have tier 3 best in slot everything, with the rank 14 title and have cleared all raids and dungeons, chances are you’d quit the game or re-roll in a matter of weeks, as you’d have done everything and met all your goals. The process is the fun part, not the end achievement.
---
We migrated to Skeram after migrating to Stalaag after abandoning Herod.
---
Complete fluke that im on the dominate side.
---
Druids are pretty fun in pvp, wouldnt reroll.
---
Keep in mind, your shapeshifts break roots, snare and polymorph effects - in most situations you can run away. Also most classes have cooldown on movement abilitys, druids not. Just try run away and get into cat stealth.
---
Next week the Battlegrounds open, so there will be less or no worldpvp. 
---
Keep the head up, last 10 levels are longest. 52 is a good level for Ungoro, wouldnt recommend Searing Gorge right now - but a BRD Questrun gives alot XP.
---
Honestly, I would like super long queue times. I prefer world PvP and that would give me more time to do it, but I am not getting my hopes up.
---
I need this translation
---
Blizz have done realm merges in the past.  They have made specific server and faction transfers.  They could for example offer a free 60 boost to Ali and not horde on that server, or also open that to horde on the realm that faction swap to Ali.  Free mount and gold to capped Ali chars?  Plenty of small boosts would add up fast  
---
Remember they are Neo here- they can change anything if they just set their mind to it.
---
The German server Heartstriker. Since the free transfers from others servers almost all the other alliance from other servers transferd there and the server now seems to be 75:25 in Alliance favour. 
---
And the funniest thing is, the Alliance there started doing what they fled from. They started ganking the Horde capital city because there was no one to kill in wpvp.
---
I think I’ve taken several screenshots around this location! It’s awesome.
---
You assume people would spread equally to all those 2k servers
---
Guess they just want you for the spell crit buff, so your gear wont matter that much early one ;)
---
EQ TLPs and P99 showed that people will be terrible first chance they get.
---
As a miner I used to just do perimeter laps in Ungoro and winterspring for thorium nodes.  There are probably better ways to make more gold per hour but this way takes very little effort and with a gatherer addon can get you a solid amount earned per session depending on your luck.
---
It's worth 140 base health at 60 and it's a 2 minute CD, so not as good as gnome int/escape artist or human spirit/perception/sword skill/(to an extent rep gains) or shadowmeld/+1% dodge
---
I mean... if it works, it works
---
Prob want one if you'll be tanking
---
Honestly, just get a mic bro
---
Advantages - you can really maximize rested XP! My warrior alt grinders from 26-40 all thru SM all rested just jumping in for 2-3 tunes once a weekend.
---
- you can level up more professions 
---
- you will learn more about a class by actually playing it, if your main is a hunter and you roll a mage next your gunna do really well VS hunters (in theory) because you are very familiar with their kit
---
- more loot!
---
I am an altoholic!
---
You've turned this into something that sounds pretty cool!
---
Fair enough, are dps warriors taken in raids or people prefer rogues and other classes for that role ?
---
Raid 2, yeah. As such our gear is a little lacking and we don’t consistently get a pre-submerge kill. Raid 1 pretty reliably finishes the fight inside 2 and a half minutes according to our logs
---
Truth is, nobody knows for sure.
---
I suspect there will be at least 1 person in each rank.
---
Yeah my guild has it on farm, only reason spots are opening is that they're starting a new group on a different day of the week that's more convenient for some people.
---
Its cool to be part of wow classic dramatic history especially after having made the correct choice of getting the fuck out.
---
It's pretty interesting, sadly some people are still in the salty phase about it. 
---
Posting how you got ganked by alliance right now is enough to get your posts down voted.
---
I guess downvotes are the closest most of the alliance on pvp servers can get to winning a pvp battle right now
---
Just get two accounts like a real addict.
---
You’re not the hero we deserve....you’re the hero we need. 
---
You miss the 320 person alliance deathball?
---
Yes. And just saying you are horde usually gets you downvoted and blamed for everything that happens.
---
The main reason to play an alt is to have something else to do in case you feel like you need some variation. In that case the class really just depends on your preference. Other reasons are bank space and professions. You can imagine how these tie in together. Another advantage to having a mage as an alt would be conjured water. But you will need a middle man to trade it to your alt. I do this with my gf.
---
&gt; Ashkandi for instance is already better than the r14 2H.
---
Not to mention, you need to have the literal highest rank in order to get the PVP weapon. Many players will never see that due to the time commitment alone, but how are you supposed to get to rank 14 without a raid weapon? Are you really expected to grind all the way to the top with a dungeon blue?
---
Good lucky Kitty. Hope it works out for you guys!
---
Also, fuck you. I will never forget the first time you ganked me.
---
Regards - Deadvard.
---
Yea it is..
---
The war is over. The good guys lost.
---
If anything, layering stopped flamelash situation from being more common.
---
If servers were smaller, we would see a lot more ones with a dead faction.
---
You just mindfucked every horde player in history.
---
And now every 1 else does too
---
The community has not changed significantly except for streamers existing
---
nerf it
---
Community was different yes. But blizzard has also screwed up literally everything with classic wow.
---
A chief with anything other than coffee or a phone in their hand, how novel.
---
I mean did you expect alliance players to post about getting ganked about alliance
---
Anyone who has played knows he's right. People were clueless about most mechanics. Dps and gearing was very bad.
---
Sick humble brag.
---
dropped 2 times in  1 run for us. rng is rng.
---
the bow! now that, I've not seen!
---
I asked a GM and they just cited the migration window as the only option. I guess we are stuck :)
---
Did you mean w8ing?
---
Yeah but that Warrior will lose a significant chunk of his DPS, whereas a Ret Paladin will lose very little, if any.
---
Don't pretend like any other class has an actually difficult rotation lol
---
Hey Kitty! Hope everything works out for you! Though I'm a bit sad you decided not to come along with the rest of us from Forged, it sounds like you've found a new type of gameplay you enjoy, and that's what the game is ultimately about isn't it? Having fun, while hopefully not ruining other people's fun.
---
-Alipheese
---
I'm guessing it's a driver issue with my card. AMD hasn't released a update for my card for this model since 2016. 
---
I went on my GFs computer and installed the game. And she just has an Intel Integrated GPU but still got the MSAA x2, x4, x8 options.
---
I noticed I could not force MSAA through the Radeon Settings/CCC either. It looks like it does not work with Blizzard games. I can do it with for other games though.
---
It sucks. Wish I could get MSAA. But I will get an FPS boost I guess. and FXAA is a little blurry, but does have it's charm for a fantasy game. It adds a little glow and blur.
---
Imagine blindly attacking random other players because they chose a faction side where their friends play.
---
Imagine thinking "horde" and "alliance" are some weird social constructs and not just two random sides in an online game.
---
Imagine not seeing the system is at fault but rather attacking random other people who love this game.
---
Wtf happened in this sub.
---
It depends on queue times.
---
If I have an hour+ queue time, then I will still be camping places in between games.
---
That's not the topic einstein.
---
What happened on flamelash stays on flamelash. :D
---
So edgy.
---
dont they want the op paladin healers +freedom?
---
Having the option and incentive seems better than just letting everything die.
---
Done for.
---
Buffing someone flags you. Taking the zeppelin from a contested zone flags you. Walking in from a contested zone flags.
---
There is a lot to complain about with wow.  This event wasn’t one of them.
---
I was there and my server was impacted.  
---
Were you online during the plague?
---
Kurinaxx is alliance dominated. I play there
---
People on here act like vanilla servers were all perfectly balanced and only organized balanced and even world pvp happened in vanilla.
---
Literally just Thanos
---
15x 60s left from what I saw in the Flamelash forums
---
Worth using for off-tanks on one-tank fights.
---
Warriors can farm anger with some invisible pots I thought? Maybe you need a healer... the kiting ledge trick works pretty well though. Definitely doable as a rogue.
---
A boomer would confuse reddit with a red knit hat tbh I don’t see it
---
Has changed since then
---
 You act like that wasn't the majority of leveling anyway.
---
at least he didn't put any effort it. tfw you spend over 30 minutes getting images and photoshopping just to have it deleted by some party pooper mod, even tho the post got 90% upvotes.
---
isnt most streamers horde as well and that made a lot of ppl gravitate towards it?
---
and that's being no changes to the point of having a worse game
---
if lfr is good, it should be in
---
if lfr is bad, xrealm bg should be out
---
Warrior and shaman. But warrior needs to have some solid weapons.
---
Don't you need both factions to access AQ?
---
5pc t1 doesn't do shit for your damage
---
Fresh bread for sale!
---
Flamelash is going to be the last server to get the AQ gates open lol
---
Same here, play with 2 other IRL friends. We just hit 48. We are in no rush and are enjoying the classic leveling experience. I played vanilla, and so far classic has been almost as fun as it was back then. We’ll never raid in classic and that’s ok with us. Maybe we’ll roll another character or maybe we’ll unsubscribe. Either way the last few months have been fun for us.
---
Its completely changed the game, if you cant recognize that I dont know what to tell you.
---
Just came back on at 9am Sunday morning to check this and I have over 40 messages.  I will have to scale back the package a bit; likely to 10 slot bags and 2g.  I will do my best to get to you all!  Diving in to these messages now....
---
The first people to get r14 will probs do it using OEB, few of them BRE or Spinal. But yeah for most it will just be short term placeholder for Ashkandi or TUB I assume.
---
No, it's like entering MC through BRD if you haven't done the Attunement quest.
---
Did you read anything I wrote after the first sentence?
---
Hes leveling a warrior by the end of phase 2, OP is obviously not in a min/max speed clear guild.  
---
Most likely he saw a few videos hyping it up on youtube, and in real practice this spec is not pleasant to play, it does ONE thing really well, hold single target threat at the expense of the quality of life provided by tactical mastery.
---
Unless you are a seasoned warrior in a very hardcore raid environment, with dps using sappers, full consumables and raids sprinting through content, which I doubt anyone asking for rotation advise and behind 2 phases content wise on reddit would be, fury/prot simply isn't worth it over depp prot or impale prot.
---
tried this but i found 1 mithril node in over an hour of running around...
---

Good call , thanks
---
Truth hurts.
---
VAN CLEEF DID NOTHING WRONG!
---
B-BUT, HORDE IS EVIL!!!!!!!!!!;;!!;!!!!!
---
wow i just need to find some members to join me then
---
It is a joke. 
---
I just find it funny how the faction with the majority of the players only seem to blame blizzard for people quitting after being farmed for honor for a month.
---
Then Dark Pact, passive regen or occasionally bandage.
---
Not worth it.... maybe my shit RNG but I’ve opened 1500+ and never seen a golden pearl... plenty of the other kind :(
---
Nope, where do you get that from?
---
Leaving the server is what killed it
---
not when there is 10 hours queue for 1 bg.
---
Curse those superior horde racials
---
As long as the Horde leaves you alone, you'll be fine.  I played for years on one private server that had 250 players on during peak times.  If you haven't done the small community thing before, it's a lot of fun. Basically what everyone does matters to everyone else. On a PVP server though, everything would depend on whether they keep nuking you.
---
It's not the gaming culture that promotes efficiency over everything else, it's the *Society*
---
Warriors will always be #1 on every meter until the end of classic, rogues will always be alittle behind
---
Westfall is Detroit of Stormwind.
---
We were doing MC on Wednesday when someone told us that the other big guilds just transferred and the rest of MC and Ony was a long, heated debate about what to do and where to go. At the start staying was still an option but the more guilds left in real time the more we felt staying was not an option anymore. We already took it up the ass literally everywhere all day all night and it was somehow gonna get 50x worse.
---
I don't see why people are upset with other players - blizzard has a system where you are rewarded for players kills. Do you think someone's just going to decide "Gee, I should not kill players and not maximize my chance at getting/staying ahead of the curve to get some of the best loot available."?
---
There's no in-game measurement of "will alliance stop playing", but there is one for "I've made HKs towards ranking" so they could even possibly weigh the two against each other.

---
1 guild vs the horde sounds pretty fuckin cool tbh. i'd consider re rolling to join if i played in the same region
---
Nothing like this ever happened though. It went from 70-30 to 99-1 in 3 days.
---
Why not just buy it for 400 then. Why pay him an extra 25 gold lol.
---
Sounds really punishing for mechanics that are out of your control if you die or not. Getting double hit by Raggy nuke twice and the healers didnt heal you in between? Well, sucks to be you because the system is there to punish you for someone elses misstake.  
---
I see the logic you are trying to apply, but personally I think it might backfire and Im glad im not part of it.
---
You'd get corpse camped at the fp in low level areas at 10am on a fucking Tuesday. It was no fun.
---
Ok makes sense!
---
Lol, the worst is that it might work because if some people weren't dumb enough they wouldn't dare trying , right ?
---
Lmao this is why wow will always have bad pvp.  They left because one siren had a massive advantage. Instead of rerolling to make it balanced the horde just stuck with EZ mode.
---
Can be the difference to get out another backstab or not, especially with thistle tea.
---
But sure, aint doing shit.
---
AQ gates ain't opening there.
---
You don't replace SC until you have 5+ pieces of t1+t2. And no you don't miss specials. With a proper combat spec you only need 1% hit to never miss a special which you have on rings and ranged at the very least. And thinking of it as PPM is wrong, PPM isn't a thing in classic. Sure it averages out to that but there is no internal cooldown. You can proc that shit 5 swings in a row and spike to 3k+ dps. The fights are so short it really doesn't matter what damage averages are, the potential is what gets good parses. We have 7 rogues all similarly geared and the person on top changes damn near every fight because of rng. I don't actually have 90% crit but on that one Domo parse I did because rng can be crazy in a 40sec fight.
---
Besides some people that spam SM from 30-40 ish, not really?
---
BuT You're not flagged for pvp in your city.
---
-some dumbass who doesnt understand why everyone's upset
---
Yup! By the time AQ is open for them, AQ will be cleared by everyone else.
---
Oh ! Yes, of course. Wintergrasp, not winterspring. My bad.
---
I still don't understand this argument.  If I were to pick solely based on PvP racials ( which I have done in the past ) I would pick alliance every time.  Alliance healers are amazing, Paladins are the best PvP healers and Fear Ward + Desperate Prayer + Stoneform make for amazingly durable priests.  Healers make or break most encounters, and when you can't burst down any healer it's always a tough fight.
---
But muh skills and muh faction
---
Even back in vanilla we had a saying "red = dead". No place was safe for low levels once you stepped into contested territory. The only difference is that everyone ranked up to 60 and cleared mc with nothing else to do now
---
This isn’t what puts fury ahead of the pack lol
---
Maybe off tank?
---
If this is the case. I bet people would 100-0 vote for racials being removed from the game because it wouldn’t change anything.
---
&gt; theres alot
---
No.
---
You won't have a problem getting into a raid as a fury warrior
---
Basically yes.
---
What sever?
---
premade bgs are a thing, they're the best way to rank, its not all zerg
---
o for the common gamer, sure i guesss
---
Or it shows how content needs to be released. Not releasing BGs was a mistake
---
Nothing stopping you. Just pick the server realm?!
---
I think this was inevitable. There's a misperception that PVP servers were dominant during the Nila. The actual breakout was more than 2/3 PVE vs. PVP. It's unfortunate, because it's so many people that didn't play during classic probably didn't realize how painful PVP servers can be. Vanilla is enough of a grind without dying 8 billion times.
---
Honestly I find it depressing
---
They prolly just plug everything into Google Translate. 
---
Speaking as a former Linguist, Google Translate sucks for anything more than a single word here or there. Actually awful for full sentences.
---
My guild was clearing ZA every week, but I don't think I ever saw a single Murmur kill.

You don't need reddit to realize your server is imbalanced lol
---
Flamelash EU
---
It's for your faction overall. So top .01 of 321 people would be obtainable. With anything the lower ranks might actually be skipped
---
Not really since you have a pet that can tank for you, once you're at 10% hp and 50% mana you can let your pet fully tank a mob and you kill it with Lifedrain only, do that 1-3 times and you are at 100/80 or something yet again
---
Balance PVE set?
---
You guys are actually so lucky, grand marshal will be a breeze now. You guys win!
---
The world first types will probably log off right in front of UBRS the. Ugly before I’d guess. At most one death to get in.
---
You know the AQ War Event will auto-complete after a set period of time?
---
Where did they go then?
---
Specifically for tanking I agree.  But they added a lot if very nice mechanics that improved a ton. 
---
Specifically the percentage heal from crits and the insane damage that Bear form did.
---
My brother and I played elemental shaman / feral 2v2 and the damage cat and bear form out out in TBC was almost broken lol
---
I know everyone says they got past 2k rating in TBC and Wrath,  but we used to stream on arenajunkies 🤷‍♂️
---
lmaooo
---
Thank you for your responses
---
I like to hop on and enjoy P99 from time to time.  But every time I start cracking out a little too hard on it, I end up reading the forums and realizing what a sad bunch of individuals actually compose the hardcore groups there.  I quickly re-evaluate my priorities and set it aside for a while.
---
Likewise (: I feel like there'll always be some holes here or there, but you're doing really well (:

Okay, I've leveled Gnomish Engineering all the way up. I've made all the things. What's the best way to incorporate them into my play style? i.e. helpful macros, itemrack, or whatever. Shaman - 30/0/21
---
AAP for classic works but if you venture off to do your own thing it won't update. Example: use AAP up until level 10, then you decide to do your own thing till 20, AAP will still be on level 10 quests and you have to go do them to get caught up to 20.
---
AAP is great if you just want to mindlessly level but I'd recommend using Questie in combination with dungeon runs for a more enjoyable experience.
---
Nothing stopping you. Just pick the EU realm?
---
Spam SM from 28-42 then Uld for a few levels. Next is ZF graveyard farming up until ST, maybe BRD, then dungeon the rest of the way for BIS. How a lot of people on my server did it before phase 2.
---
So why did you you stay?
---
sadist
---
buying a micro alone is so overkill rofl, just get whatever headset has a good price/value ratio and it'll have a decent to shitty mic attached.
---
And the servers are like 5x as populated so finding any place to quest is impossible.
---
All I was trying to do is point out how faction queues will not fix the issue the way people think it would. 
---
My solution would be to release battlegrounds, and remove honor gain next to flightmasters and inns.
---
Reduce server population if possible.
---
Of course, all solutions have drawbacks. My problem is faction queues just don't work the way people think they will.
---
but i want neither :(
---

---
Ah yes, definitely two random sides, with no differences
---
That's why almost every pvp server is 40A/60H because everyone went horde to play with their friends and no other reason :)
---
Do you seriously believe this nonsense? What an awful bad faith argument
---
If I'm a lock and want to buy a raptor do I need to purchase the riding skill as well or does my epic mount spell already grant me that and I just have to purchase the mount? (plus be exalted with troll faction) How much is this, 800g with discounts?
---
I too played Halo by not shooting at the enemy team
---
Yeah... the way they judge whether something is low effort or not baffles me every time.
---
With proper energy management in a prolonged fight your maximum doesn't mean anything as long as you don't cap, and you never should . It's why vigor is a shit talent for raiding. A larger energy pool is just for burst/control in pvp.
---
Kara is what got me hooked on WoW. I got so close to my raid group and I stuck with them until Cata. I have a real soft-spot for 10-man raiding because of that and I hate that it was always treated as the lesser format.
---
That's reddit for you. Never be serious here, it's all about funny remarks.
---
Meh those are just buff bots for the classes that do the killing. Paladins will be a lot easier w/o fear ward.
---
It eventually opens the other side
---
Yes but he brings a blessing and an aura and lay on hands and divine intervention and a shit warrior brings another battle shout...  most raiding guilds have one ret Paladin.
---
In 3 days we get AV. Park your ass in there and get the ring, 2h, shield and rank 8 for 4 pvp set items. All your problems will go away if you do this and you also get some nice stamina items from 5 mans and stamina enchants.
---
/run local items={[1520]=true,[9335]=true,[9333]=true,[9334]=true,[9332]=true,[1645]=true,[4599]=true}for b=0,4,1 do for s =1,32,1 do local id=select(10,GetContainerItemInfo(b,s)) if items[id] then PickupContainerItem(b,s) DeleteCursorItem() end end end 
---
Macro to delete useless shit like potteries, yw.
---
Nothing but rogues and druids stealthing through their own cities
---
So it's like heartseeker basically?
---
that paladin still provides aura, blessings and BoP + LoH cooldowns and 100% uptime of a seal.
---
Paladins get twice the proc chance due to SoR. Also Judgements can proc weapon procs. ATM most theorycrafting discords give paladins a slight edge for uptime. They also loose less personal DPS per character slot with nightfall then a warrior would. On Horde side I'd say warrior though due to orcs and windfury.
---
They're being salty and grasping for straws to complain about this. They've got a bunch of posts whining about it, they just look butthurt.
---
I'm a healer and dont use a mic. As long as you listen it will be fine
---
Whilst it's a car crash of Blizzard's own making, it's good to see you're making it work.
---
My first MMO was Star Wars Galaxies which had very little end game content.  PvP on Bloodfin was dominated by the Imperial's, so one of their best PvPers, the legendary Delz Nope switched faction to start a Rebel PvP guild with myself and some other Rebels.
---
We then went to war with the big Imperial guilds like TR and Dread, plus the lesser guilds like TMB.
---
I look back on that era fondly, the player generated narratives and drama are up there with my best MMO memories
---
CC /u/deltaxi65
---
&gt; the proc uptime will be very minimal between the two
---
Warrior has autoattacks + hamstring every 1.5 seconds
---
Paladin just has autoattacks. SoC does not proc "on hit" effects.
---
Jesus, I don't remember vanilla players being such snowflakes.
---
yes
---
Not on all serer Believe it or not some (while rare) are alliance heavy.
---
Earthfury for example got absolutely pounded by alliance transfers
---
well usualy theres the same people in IF whenever we have HS ready we come back and clean them, some of them are super desperate and they suicide for 1 man funneling some honor
---
Obvious troll is obvious.
---
Back then the builds and strategies were worked out from other guilds already, so it was basically just following instructions, and some were good while others sucked hard. And most of the time the difficulty wasn't about the mechanic itself, but coordinating enough people to follow their route. Things only changed slightly from AQ on when suddenly a majority of bosses had some hard enrage condition so DPS became an issue at last.
---
It's from the Darkshore Warfront which is majorly Night Elves vs Undead, so the Horde armor sets are Undead themed and the Alliance sets are Night Elf themed.
---
Can you expand more on this please? What happened there? I love reading about this
---
This sub is becoming eerily similiar to /r/2007scape
---
Hi lifelong ally here. I think its entirely blizzards fault. blaming players PAYING to play the game is insane and emotional. The echo chamber bullshit on this sub is on a whole other level.
---
Heal bot comes with a built in threat meter and imo is the easiest to set up. Has one click casting.
---
Eventually there's a mercy rule that opens it, but it's weeks.
---
Playing as the 20 on a 20/80 server is miserable to the point of not being worth playing. You can’t blame the players for transferring off.
---
horde bad
---
alliance good
---
I mean BEFORE the exodus.
---
Alliances keep saying that they left because the server was 80-20 when it was 60-40, on average with the rest.
---
You've answered your own question. Get that resistance gear. Also maybe get exalted with Argent Dawn. Otherwise, roll an alt, farm materials that will increase in value in the future, help guildies?
---
Can I transfer to Flamelash from other server? :)
---
Nah, I feel bad for the people who now can't play the game. I went rp PVE to avoid this shit show, we all knew was coming.
---
You need riding as well. But it costs only 20g. The mount cost 800g with discounts
---
Ah I see the horde symbol
---
The ogre forged hauberk is almost as good as the SGC. Don't bother getting something else because the gain is not really that big. It's better to focus on getting a better weapon or just farm gold for the Edgemaster's Handguards. They're insane and the biggest DPS boost you can get from any item that is currently in the game. I got them and its like getting a talent that gives you a flat out 12%  more dps. Amazing.
---
Been farming thousands of 61-62 elites...one of these days. Got 2 Alcors, Cloudkeepers, Skullflame, Sash of Mercy and Brain Hacker...need my Teebu
---
You're talking about tryharding a fight where my raid group splits into 20 mans and downs it. Beyond that, one of the biggest reasons you get brought as a lock is for raid recovery in the event of a wipe. There's no reason to ss yourself, if you die in ONY you're doing something very wrong. Or something unexpected happened and a wipe happens. With no SS the RL is going to be upset.
---
Most players don't play like that.
---
better than holding your font
---
WAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH
---
Riiiight.
---
Frankly, there are such alliance players on servers as well so i don't see the point in this.
---
Post a SS of the amount online please :)
---
Noticed and created an Alliance alt over here. Will do my part in helping.
---
40 60 is generous to balance. It’s 30 70 in alot
---
That's cute and all, but the domesticated brown kodo doesn't have the survival instinct and learned skills of its wild brothers. 
---
You've doomed it to a slow, sad death.
---
Ateish has a huge alliance pop
---
I payed 15$ every month to not shoot you filthy casual. Maybe if blizzard could turn a profit they would take responsibility for their product.   
---
To bad they would rather collect a check and say  i told you so to " You think you do, but you dont". While community division lets them get away with it.
---
https://www.wowdownrank.com/#
---
Even if you understand the maths behind it, talents and stuff can really impact what you should or should not downrank. Plug it in the tool and use accordingly.
---
I would advise getting a max rank Prayer of Healing - it's super good when all are low - and a lower rank as well (same idea but when you don't need THAT much healing).
---
Might lead to an earlier eviscerate that wouldn't have worked out elsewise.
---
I don't have it mapped out, but it especially secures that in the short burst fights I'm not wasting thistle tea energy because I'm not exactly at 0. We ain't in a perfect, non-mistake world too.
---
Nah
---
&gt;always look on the bright side of life
---
 always look on the bright side of death
---
&lt;3 still on my KOS
---
Pvp is encouraged yeh, but nothing encourages you to spend your day sitting at a Fp, killing everyone who comes in, for no honor.
---
You cant blame players for quiting the game after such experiences and you can blame blizzard for players toxic behavior. This goes beyond "honor farming"
---
I think most people on both sides would say blizz fucked up, first and foremost.
---
It was 55-45 before phase 2. So no it wasnt unbalanced from the start.
---
Fear -&gt; SWP -&gt; Mind Flay -&gt; Wand. Cast a shield on yourself when they get close.
---
Is an item that gives YOUR ENTIRE RAID GROUP an extra 15% spell damage worth using? Please tell me this isn't a real question
---
Great post! What's the AddOn called that gives all the loot / gold/h information?
---
The honor system didn't force people to camp low lvl characters tho...
---
It's both parties fault.
---
Weakaura script https://wago.io/OXlZupyKm
---
I think this is the same that Im using. Im on my phone atm.
---
Imagine starting an argument or statement with "imagine".
---
??? its only directly tied to auto grouping across realms
---
More like how many hours of time has his raid group spent recovering from a wipe because their rezzers have to fucking ghost walk back to the instance
---
Pretty much what I did. Had plenty of gear at 60.
---
I mean, people are exactly how I remember them from vanilla, except now we have Reddit to complain on, instead of just the Blizzard forums.
---
That's so sad lol
---
r/2007scape is a 10/10 this is nothing more than a 2/10 at best
---
Obviously not but if you cant see the difference in running around warmode on all the time vs for a specific purpose once a week. I dont know what to tell you.
---
there were changes and that's a fact.
---
Thank you dude, it's called FarmLog
---
People read that stuff? I just play and didn’t want to be a cow
---
Literally nobody even knew glancing blows were a thing in the beginning of the game, wotf was different and nobody could estimate how strong racials were. The simple fact that edgemaster's handguards used to sell for 10-15g and they sell for 400+ now means you are wrong. Or the fact that undead priests were widely thought to be the go-to race for shadow, even though we now know trolls are just as good if not better. Or that stoneskin was a very strong racial for rogues. These were not well-known things. 
---
Also those are facts. All you have to offer as a counter-argument is "well, everyone  just kinda changed their opinions". That's not an argument. That's you trying to argue so you can be an ass.
---
The ratio was close before phase 2. Alliance was just outnumbered in world pvp because they had way fewer pvp players.
---
Just like you can't blame the Horde for grinding honor.
---
A geared warrior shouldn't be beat unless the fight mechanics are brutal for melee 
---
Rogue is also very strong, and those 4 classes will be the bulk of the bigboi dps, but warr shouldn't ever be topped except by the ignite mage
---
Alliance have huge advantages since paly exist and we have better AV map.
---
I was talking about leveling mainly through dungeons. That's mostly what I did before phase 2 and more or less what i'm going to be doing on my alt now too.
---
Its like that if you play on a PVE server though :)
---
Same, but in all seriousness, at least on my server i find people almost exclusively find groups via lfg channel.
---
If I'm paying for gas for my humvee, that doesn't absolve me of responsibility for fucking up the environment.
---
I dont know.. but allies roaming everwhere and killing horde. So it cant be that bad. Cant do any quests at 50+ either
---
Yes you can. It's absolutely the gankers fault.
---
The !setdateformat command is not working. Please help! I type !setdateformat mm-dd-yyyy and this comes back "Invalid input, dateformat not updated."
---
Is this game worth picking up as someone who has not played World of Warcraft ever? I dont have a nostalgia factor for it. I have currently been playing it a bit, have a level 11 Night Elf Rogue. But between having a seriously hard time deciding what class/race/faction I want to commit to, and horror stories on here about the game being bad, way worse than it was back in 2004, people being more toxic, and PvP being toxic rather than a fun addition, I am heavily debating whether I should spend time on it.
---
And if I should, I still dont know what Faction/Class to play. In general I think I like Horde areas and stuff more, but I dont like any of the horde races, and playing a character I dont like looking at is somewhat unfun I think
---
Thank you! I completely agree.
---
It has, private server players every where.  Every gamer is a meta gamer. No one talks to u unless you sit at their 40 man lunch table.
---
Tyrande is amazing. Read the books, they're so good!
---
Ahh. I was mistaken then.
---
&gt;Compare that to the darkspear trolls,
---
Yes Jamaican jar jar binx, what a great race.
---
I literally just did. Stop paying shitty devs
---
US can't access EU servers
---
If you go oom after potting in a fight &gt; prio int. If you don't, prio +healing
---
Well that's dumb. You can't blame blizzard for people being merciless cunts and making the game unplayable for others.
---
Yeah but since ally isn’t raiding on the server and you can’t make alts on a PvP server ignore the other faction I don’t think anyone could buy them.
---
You can't expect the hord to organize a hunting season  just so the deer don't die out.
---
you're saying its not comparable because you're comparing parts that have nothing to do with eachother and parts that aren't relevant
---
LFR is xrealm groupfinder, not difficulty tiers and loot tables
---
VERY few people will want to commit to that.
---
this but unironically
---
So we should go back to queueing at the entrance of battleground? Because in classic we will queue from the capital and not from the entrance.
---
Isn't that the fascinating part though? That a game can do that to us?
---
The mobs don't survive long enough for siphon life to meet its break point.
---
A joke brah
---
"Lazy Faire" approach to game development.
---
Came here for the ERP jokes
---
In what possible way is it their fault?
---
The game is 15 years old and has numerous private servers to play on since then. There is literally nothing left about the Classic experience that is hidden to people, everything has been discovered and discussed for over a decade.
---
There was complete transparency about how the game would be released, the patch schedule to follow, and the subsequent effects that each patch would have.
---
The state of the game now is caused by the people playing it, whether for the better or for the worst.
---
And I’m playing Alliance now and did all the way back in a Vanilla. Nothing changed except people’s perceived entitlement.
---
There is literally one single pvp server where horde don’t drastically outnumber alliance
---
The genocide would have been more muted and drawn out if it was vanilla pop caps
---
It will all work itself out. People will transfer, reroll, quit, come back, etc. 
---
There’s probably a minor imbalance on most..10% or so, but the higher population numbers than vanilla exacerbate the number difference between factions. While a 10% difference in vanilla would only be 300 people, now it’s one thousand people..and that’s a big numbers imbalance. 
---
Blizzard could definitely implement a “no more character creation” for the faction with the advantage on realms with an imbalance. That would stop people from changing factions to avoid the imbalance. And probably help the balance process along faster too.
---
Flamelash is EU ? What kind of server is it? That's the kind of thing that would make me wanna level up there and struggle through to help at the same time for some fucked up anime reason
---
Annddd.. it would take less time to just kill the mob and drink/eat back to this point so it's not that great of an approach.  Not to mention your pet has its own hp/mana pool to deal with.
---
Many of us planned for this by rolling on PvE servers.
---
From someone who picked Flamelash at random on launch day this is all so fascinating. Prior to P2 there was no indication the realm was any different from others but now it feels like my server has some weird place in the history of classic. 
---
I'm also surprised at the dedication of alliance players to move en masse, there definitly used to be plenty of people. Normally when you see news of 'tons' of people transferring it isn't actually a large %, but this time it's very true.
---
What? Just download discord on your phone and use that for raids. Your phone is your mic
---
Yeah you can, the job of a dev is to study and mitigate unintended or detrimental behaviors
---
My friend went PvE and I was hesitant but it was the best decision ever. Everyone PvP’s at Southshore/Tarren Mill and grieving does not exist.
---
Brilliant work as usual mate - please do keep sharing your work.
---
if it’s not working just abandon and re-do it
---
"Amazing"?  Are you kidding?  I mean it's far from the worst, but amazing is hilarious.
---
Pretty sure back in vanilla the alliance outnumbered the horde and to help counter that, blizzard decided to release a “pretty” race for the horde to help balance faction population.
---
Probably because of the extremely short notice (2 days for EU and &lt;1 day for NA) on closing free transfers. It caused a stampede as people had to make the choice, and everyone chose to be safe than sorry.
---
I agree for the opposite reason, i dont want either.
---
For some reason people ignore the fact xrealm BGs do the same for PvP as LFR does for PvE. I hated BGs after 1.12
---
Yes, BG queues are bad for imbalanced servers, but single servers for BGs would have been the biggest reasons to keep the servers balanced. Being on the dominant side of a PvP server is horrible since your queues are terrible, now theres going to be no disincentive to be the only faction on a server.
---
You’ll be 60 by Tuesday!
---
This comment is incomprehensible.
---
You're comparing retail's war mode to classic P2, but beyond that I'm not sure what the point is.
---
I have no idea about paladins, but if it's anything like priest itemization you won't find a number. The best you can do is know what stat is prio and what is each stat weight in the ilvl calculation.
---
Yup.  I knew it was going to happen, I just thought I could beat p2 to 60.  I lost the game.  I re-rolled on a PvE realm and have been happy ever since.  My 4 other friends sadly quit when they hit 50 as they do not have time to re-roll.  These are guys who played back in Vanilla/TBC/WOTLK
---
&gt; So why did you do the dalies?
---
&gt; And if you didn't do the dalies... what is your point?
---
A benediction alliance who does [here](https://m.twitch.tv/telusive/profile)
---
It’s a meme lmao
---
&gt;anyone with a functional brain couldve seen this coming.
---
That's why those of us with functional brains rolled on PvE servers. This isn't blizzard's fault. You chose to roll on pvp servers despite having 15 years of data showing that "world pvp" is actually just gankfests.
---
It's called soft science for a reason.
---
Someone else on here said it best, the game didn't change but the people did. In hindsight it was naive to think players wouldn't have changed, and that's where the problems are stemming from.
---
It’s a great game but nothing compared to the game of life!!
---
It's blizzard's fault for not stopping them from using safespots.
---
Inb4 horde don’t understand jokes and wahhhh on you lmao
---
http://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=1VSxFOc6eFYyoF6X19SQEKd12CJriIdXl
---
Use Excel to make use of the macros
---
Because the humans totally haven't attempted it, oh wait they wanted to kill all the blood elfs and when the orcs left to get away from the fighting guess who followed them and started trying to kill them all, Don't want to pay the bill for fixing sormwind? just murder all the stonemasons.
---
I'm probably in the minority, but I actually get bored and hate doing the same dungeon more than 3 times unless i take a break for a while doing other stuff. I could never spam dungeons all the way to 60 because it would be mindnumbing imo. It's bad enough at 60 trying to get geared haha, then again some people love it. Just not my cup of tea
---
the complainers be pre complaining i see. honestly if you still have probs with wpvp after BGs, then you DEF shouldve rolled PvE.
---
Holy paladins using proper raid consumables and wearing pre-raid BiS gear or better should virtually never run out of mana even while spamming max rank flash of light. Wearing gear with the highest +healing possible while ignoring other stats will generally give the best results.
---
Absolutely. As I said: I didn't mean to claim TBC didn't make Feral more enjoyable and even better than it was in Vanilla's viable patches, but it absolutely is viable in Classic.
---
Hell, gear being more logical made *every* spec better that was in a bit of a weird state in TBC. Classic only has a handful of "+ap in shapeshift form" items and those only really begin to drop in...ZG and AQ I think? A bit late. TBC had those from the getgo which helps a ton, too!
---
Also feral actually got tier sets which were made for them, which is nice~
---
How is its blizzard's fault for how people act? The Horde spawn camps the alliance and then they all quit, but some how its blizzards fault
---
Sure, but the game of life needs stuff to do when there is no productive tasks left :#
---
Argent Dawn rep is a good one. On resistance gear I'm mostly just wondering what gear is worth getting (some gear might have a high probability of being replaced before you use it, some gear may not be worth the hit to dps, etc.)
---
Thank you. That was exactly my point. Guess I should have just said that, lol. 😆
---
Stopped being funny around the 50th post brah.
---
I rolled Tauren because they big and they slam peace pipes. Unironically seem like the chillest race in WoW.
---
Guidelime
---
What? Its the exact opposite, you want people you can count on more in PvP and in PvP, its doubled since you know who to watch out for on the opposing side.
---
If you want an in-game addon you can use guidelime together with this:
---
https://github.com/lukeknoot/classicwow-to-guidelime/releases
---
It’s the same classicwow guide.
---
To be perfectly honest if you went into this game believing everyone would behave exactly as they did 15 years ago, you sold yourself your own lies and clung onto them.
---
i raided nax,  i dont even remember if my guild cleared it or not ( i dont think i ever did personally but i wanna say my guild did) and i dont really remember shit  about it either. probably because i smoked massive amounts of weed while raiding ( and still do!)
---
upvote pls
---
It’s not a bad time to start the adventure! However I’d probably recommend playing on a normal or pve type server... leveling is much more fun (IMO) without having to worry about enemy players
---
because while they usually go for 400g, there wasn't one on the AH at the time.
---
Alliance hold AQ hostage until enough horde transfer.
---
I was on a low pop server for most of vanilla and AV was almost never down, like even at 3am.
---
This is so tempting
---
It’s so fucking weird. The clowns on this subreddit think people playing on different pretend teams are inherently different.
---
My friends begged me to come play on a pvp server with them because it's the "true classic experience". I gave them a "bye felicia" and I'm still playing on a pve server and they've all quit and one of them never even hit 60.
---
Some people like the idea of being the underdog faction on a server
---
Disagree. It's nurture, not nature.
---
Do I just copy and paste this directly I to a macro? Or do I need to take the parenthesis and quotes out?
---
Horde player here who wishes I could re roll alliance but don’t wanna lvl to 60 again!
---
If I could faction transfer I would
---
my old twink guild from vanilla is reforming and we still talk about a i think it was 2 hour WSG against another twink guild that we lost.  even then we still all agree it was one of the greatest games of WSG we have ever played.  it was 2 hours of balls to the wall try hard pvp.  it was exhausting and spectacular.
---
Westfall is already alliance dominated.  It's one of the most alliance dominated servers there are.  Some places say [60/40](https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?realm=4388_Westfall) some places say [75/25](https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community).
---
The alliance doesn't need to add to their ranks.  I play horde on that exact same server and any semblance of midgame is completely non existent.
---
I guess if you want another one sided server, go ahead and roll alliance there, but just like Flamelash good luck once AQ opens up.
---
But why not? It knows for durability purposes?
---
Bracket 1 is 0.2% I think.
---
Good job Kitty! I play horde on Flamelash and I sincerely wish you guys the best of luck!
---
Seal of righousnrss does proc effects. Get your facts straight. Thanks
---
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
---
Why? There is nothing there. At least You can port to darnassus for easy acces to northen kalindor.
---
I'm pretty sure it is mentioned a lot rofl, the situation isn't that bad on my lower pop 60/40 serv. I think some alliances left but tbh if they tried they would have done good.
---
Top kek
---
Perhaps next week. This week it seems everyone is going with "it's the Horde's fault!".
---
No you can't. People said they wanted vanilla wow, there was no faction caps in vanilla
---
twinks wont quit. twink vs twink is what we live for.
---
Hunter. Then Shaman, then Warrior. Now leveling a warlock.
---
Mal’ganis was my original server. Still have my first main there and multiple alts. I’ve been away for a while but it will always be home. I have very fond memories of playing on ganis! It was home to EJ and goon squad then aurora transferred around pacth 1.12ish. I guess GS is the only one still around.
---
uhhhhhh earthfury is alliance dominant but ok
---
I used WW Axe from mid-30s all the way until like 50 when I bought Executioner's Cleaver.
---
It's extremely good, especially combined with the 5% axe crit talent in Arms.
---
Because it takes more time farming gold than you save from using sapper charges.
---
For MC, all they are doing is padding the meter.
---
I'm kinda glad that Blizz never bothered updating the engine too much. IMO D2 looks far superior to D3, WC3 looks better than Heroes, SC2, and Reforged to me. Overwatch looks good but not incredible. A major update would've probably borked it up imo.
---
Most people seem to get offended by low but reasonable offers.
---
The pattern for Robe of the Archmage goes for 70-80g on my server. There's 3-4 on the AH all the time, they're clearly not flying off the shelves. I sent an offer to 5 people to buy it for 60g before one sold it to me. Three of them ignored me and kept putting up their auction for 80 (still not selling) and one flamed me. Lol. I got my robe though.
---
I am thinking that the people who would be desperate enough to sell items at a loss to unlock AQ would easily commit to like spending 2 months of subscription to make it happen.
---
1 spell crit = 6 mp5 = 12 int = 12 healing power
---
So 1 to 1. With some extra
---
But the Horde didn’t choose to goblin sapper the IF mailbox every 5 minutes - that’s something blizzard forced them to do. /s
---
If this was NA I'd come join this underdog guild for sure. 
---
True respect to you and everyone who stays and rallies to deal with the hand they were dealt. Regardless of outcome I am certain you will make more friends and memories out of this than if you'd hopped ship with the rest.
---
Dude you put it on the OT not a DPS warrior..
---
Creating Mega servers instead of matching the population sizes of the original WoW servers.  There would still be the ratio imbalance, but there would be enough space in the world for alliance players to at least do something somewhere.  Imagine 3 people in an elevator. Now imagine 30. Get it?
---
Retail is still pretty shit man, 8.3 looks like a step in the right direction at least.
---
Tellmewhen or weakauras
---
I’ll give you 10g to keep the gnomes crying.
---
Yeah, I get if he wants to hold firm. I've just seen him post it on the AH a few times now and thought he might be interested in selling it off AH at this point.
---
You’d be surprised how real money changes mindsets.
---
Paladin has seal which doppels your Proc chance.
---
Overall paladin is better. Especially he wants different stuff from loot then warriors and he brings more utility
---
I switched to Fury at 57 once I had some +hit gear and two decent weapons. It feels much smoother than Arms and has better rage generation. I'd say the DPS is much higher too.
---
Okay, can you name all the others not named heartseeker?
---
Which is a problem due to it being a megaserver which... is blizzard's fault. People dont ask for vanilla then go "oh but yeah lets have 10k people on them" they wanted vanilla server caps as well.
---
Get a early item you can equip and get the 25 agi ench + 8 ms on boots and you should be set.
---
You CAN blame blizzard for how they implemented these Mega servers, covering up the problem initially with layering, and then removing the layers only to discover...fuck there are too many damn people in this room.
---
Oh quit being so dramatic.
---
i guess forcing people to play the other faction enough to farm thousands of materials is almost a better victory than any other possibility 
---
people can rez when i kill them but they can never get the time back they spent levelling the other faction just so they can open gates
---
Ofc it is user collected data from warcraft logs, so it cannot be completely accurate. The aggregate numbers for each population is of course off, but the percentage split between horde and ally is quite accurate in the example i have seen
---
I still remember questing in ungoro with the original rain pouring down.
---
The server cap was around 16k in the first week. Several servers had 13-20k queue. Now the cap is around 6500 and only 1-2 realms have queue once or twice a week in eu eng, but only a couple of hundred people. So classic lost almost like 70% of it’s intitial population.
---
So you wanted regular servers with 4500 players cap? That would mean we would have needed 3.5 times more realms. I believe there are around 50 at eu so we would have needed like 175 realms instead of 50. Those 175 realms now would have 1400 players online. Except 5 real a would be still full and 170 realms would have less than 1000players online. 50 of them would have like less than 100 players.
---
Humans are extremely strong in arena though, perception is very good.
---
What are you tanking? Most OT duties can be handled by a fury warrior that slaps on a shield
---
Why isn't the hat red?
---
Well when I go to realm select there is no EU server tab. just US servers, Oceanic, and was it Latin American??
---
Spoken like a true UD Mage
---
Ah yes get better in PvP because I can’t beat a level 60 priest on my 32 paladin. You’re such a troll
---
Outed myself? Are you high? You’re using the n-word in your post history and speak negatively about people with color. Like I said, go back to the Donald and enjoy your little bubble.
---
I do sm cath and get about 30g an hour + boes of varying value
---
Bro it doesnt matter. The paladin does more damage with it. Even with running seal of a crusader causing the 40% attack speed. 
---
I rn nightfall with both an Enh sham and a ret. I've never seen a war run one and for good reasons. This is the one occasion in classic where a ret is better then a warrior. Just let it go.
---
So int is 1 to 1 with healing power.. interesting. TY...
---
It's definitely one of the drawbacks warriors have in Vanilla. We don't really get the gear progression other classes get to experience until AQ comes out. I guess that's the price we pay for being the best DPS class.
---
Why tho? That 40% can't basically play that game at all.
---
It just takes self control to change that, but who does that anymore?
---
If you’re really curious I am sure you can find a way. PIA VPN can give you an EU IP address if you want to play around with trying.
---
Vanilla isn't classic. The two are not the same. Classic will never replicate what vanilla was perfectly.
---
Blizzard locked factions at certain points in vanilla when there was huge imbalances, having it automated would have been fine. Especially during launch when these swings are most important.
---
US accounts can't play on EU servers, but there's nothing stopping anyone in the US from making an EU account. You'd have to pay 2 subs to run both accounts though, and they have separate friendlists and game ownership.
---
False. If you've been working on gearing up a character then it is a factor.
---
Your second sentence is what is happening, and when paid transfers DO come out because of Blizzard happily taking our money, the problem will flip to the other side of the coin because Horde dominated PvP servers will turn into Flamelash in a split second.
---
my estimation is about 407k people
---
But there were significantly smaller server caps, and no layering, both of which would have alleviated the current issue, and arguably would have altogether prevented it.
---
So yeah, Blizzard's fault. We asked for no changes, and Flamelash is like it is BECAUSE they made changes.
---
Always with a a side of jellybeans, raw
---
I played EVE for a time, I would say you vastly underestimate the amount that the hardcore player would spend on an MMO. Even with the whole WOW game tokens in retail, people are buying them with real money and selling them in order to legally buy in game currency. They only exist because people are willing to pay real world money for an in game advantage
---
Pagle, Atiesh, Westfall, Myzrael, Remulos, Bloodsail Buccaneers || Everlook, Pyrewood Village, Heartstriker, Hydraxian.. from ironforge website - not playing on any of those myself. Not sure which all are PvE since the website doesn't divulge that information, but disregard those that are.
---
I'm not sure either. I've been people stack resistance gear while others did a combination. It's hard to say how much you'll need until those raids actually come out?
---
I also vaguely remember some good epic gear that'll come out in later patches.
---
&gt; boomer roleplay
---
The fuck?
---
Your long lost brother I guess lol
---
That's why I rolled horde. I wanted to be a Night Elf, haha. If you read or watch all the guides they talk about it.
---
Thanks for adding to my point! Join the winning side &gt;:]
---
Maybe but I'm not that interested to go through that effort lol
---
Damn that sucks. But its worth the bank slots if you got the space to take the chance we are
---
yes im compairing them. in both cases concern was giving. which was disregarded by blizzard. and scoffed at by the horde player base which face it have always been bigger PvP meat heads.
---
however in both cases the alliance fought back by invalidated the system.
---
on retail by turning of WM which was a major feature of the expansion till blizzard literally had to bribe the alliance with a bigger bonus and extra loot weekly just to turn it on. and even that didn't fix it (it hasn't been under 20% since it inception.
---
as for classic the results are even more damning. because by leaving on mass they is literally no one to fight. BG's might aleviat the problem but thats no guarantee.
---
This tactic has worked before when blizzard added resources to AV.
---
because resources led to the kill balinda take icewing and stoneheard bunkers tactic. and because the horde start is closers to the middle than the alliance. horde always played for resources and always won. alliance promply boycotted AV on mass so the horde couldn't play. till blizzard was forced to move the horde start closer to the horde base.
---
TLDR: if alliance want blizzard or the horde to do something. the best option is not to fight them but to pick up the toy and go home.
---
SWG and Bloodfin in particular had a great community.  A trash talking bickering with your sibling community, but tight knit non the less.  Still funny to this day Fight took on and won all those guild wars vs much larger imp guilds, but ended losing to that little Coors/CxC guild and turning off the war.  Pretty sure Delz is still in denial about it, best part was Coors/CxC did the same thing to Fight that Fight pulled against the big imp guilds.  Deny them fights when they had numbers mercilessly wreck them when it was close to even.  I miss Bloodfin and I miss VoD.  The proximity of VoD and Mos VEA was one of the best and least talked about rivalries on the server.  Those VEA guys were awful and talked so much trash, but they always had their mercenary crew of CxC to carry them.  To this day I don't think anyone in VEA realizes CxC used them as cannon fodder.  At least Ars admitted when Fight moved in they were using us as meat shields.
---
What's fun is that he accumilated all those guilds, and fans and he is willing to leave them all behind. He isn't putting any actual effort and expects everything to be handled to him in a silver platter. He has no actual idea how to operate and manage a guild (let alone multiple guilds) and have high hopes of mods to act as GMs who will do the work for him. 
---
The worst case scenario is that all those streamers will spread like a pleague on various servers, give a bad experience to other people. Realise that it doesn't matter which server they are on will still get camped, and then leave Classic all together and go do pet battles and dress-up competitions in BFA.
---
If you're looking for a great Classic WoW video series, UberDanger's is fucking hilarious and really well edited. 
---
https://youtu.be/jrJap2Kx-qs
---
They despawn very quick. The point is to get them to eat the sacrifice.
---
Hunters provide the most consistent proc.
---
Cats that can power shift can compete with the non-warriors. I’d say a really good cat Druid is an average rogue in damage.
---
Just out of curiosity where do you get the numbers for this? Just want to check it out
---
I'm not getting killed, nor am I whining, I am on a slightly alliance favored server and play SL lock so dying in pvp is pretty rare for me, I was just passing by to comment on your braindead comment!
---
On some servers, like Heartseeker, this is actually the Alliance. But the Alliance players can’t grasp that fact. Why is it always the Alliance players crying? It’s as if most of these grown ass adults are still stuck in their edgy teenage years.
---
When people decide, "fuck that I don't want to put the time into rerolling" and unsub, Blizzard will cash grab using server transfers and people will move to PvE.  Then you'll be dead in the water trying to fight an empty population on the other faction. Enjoy that. Your mistake, you'll pay too. It's coming. Bank on it.  #flamelash
---
And when you have made all alliance players quit and have 3 hour BG queues that you lose cause you get such little practice in it'll be horde getting upset
---
Apparently (someone else commented) it’s account based. If your account is a US account you really can’t. But you could make an EU account. 
---
What I find funny is that I can play wherever the fuck I want (seemingly) with an EU account. 
---
/shrug
---
I know we can't really pick how gear is itemized, but based on these comparisons, are there any obvious conclusions regarding gear and "stat budget"? Like, since 1 crit is roughly 6 mp5, does 1% crit "cost" more or less than 6 mp5 on a piece of gear? Does it cost less or more than 12 healing or 12 int?
---
Again, I know this is almost entirely theoretical, but I think it'd be an interesting topic to discuss and might occasionally help in picking between sets of gear.
---
25% reduced honor per unique kill per day
---
Really only world bosses, but horde has actually been getting more of them despite the ratio. World pvp is still a thing, southshore and epl, and every time I've gone (5 or so times) it's been fairly even, the alliance have a few more but not an insane amount.
---
Sure thing.  Send a mail!
---
shiiiit that's crazy. jammy cunt lol, I'm jealous
---
Completely agree with you my Horde counterpart!
---
I highly. Highly suggest a PvE server my dude. Trust us, plz lol. For the sake of your wife and you gaming together.
---
As someone who obsessively researches things I can understand, but still surprised at how many people have no idea how the ranking system works or how hard it is to get ranks.  There was a guildie I was grouped with that said they want to hit R13 for the epic gear.  Right now they are getting R5-6 every week.  I said "that'll be tough to stay in bracket 13 for a while" and he didn't understand my comment and just ended up shrugging it off.
---
Cat druid rotation isn't difficult at all, but it's atleast one example of where someone will lose dps for going auto pilot.   
---
Not trying to argue though, just saying cat druid is lowkey kinda fun.
---
1 layer cap at launch was roughly equal to 3k (source: Ion), servers had 5+ layers per launch. Delayering resulted in lowering the concurrent cap for a server but each layer cap was slightly increased in size (source: bluepost) . Now when we have 1 layer per server concurrent online cap is 6-7k.  Most server have concurrent online around 3.5k anyway which is roughly equal to vanilla.  [https://wowclassicpopulation.com/activity](https://wowclassicpopulation.com/activity)
---
I kinda love your perspective on this whole thing and honestly you make it sound kinda fun, I almost want to try my hand on flamelash as Alliance and see if I can hack it. I rolled Horde just cause I liked the characters, lore and vibe much more and honestly when I originally played there was insanely more Alliance and I wanted to in a very small way provide some balance (not very social so never trolled the community or played on private servers so I did know the new horde trend). Fast forward to months later there is so many horde you cant do anything and everyone seems to think I personally am now in close dealings with satan for even having the audacity to be horde! 
---
Its a dope breath of fresh air to see someone actually being positive and trying to make it work with the hard hand they've been dealt, hope the Leftovers can beat back the horde mobs!
---
More consumables such as flasks and things that you may not be using for MC / Ony. Not that flasks are needed for BWL if your guild is fully MC / Ony geared, but it helps.
---
Ah okay, hopefully I'll be good enough to make the cut, MC and Ony did seem a bit too easy.
---
If you want to tank, you will almost certainly need a mic. Tanks often have to coordinate with each other, call out when to start and stop dps, and are also often leaders in raid (though not necessarily THE raid leader, they are often A leader).
---
If you are simply dpsing, then you should be fine as long as you can listen to discord. Only the more hardcore guilds would require you to be able to speak as a dps, but almost all raiding guilds would require your ability to listen.
---
And if cost is a concern, there are quite cheap mics (like, $25) that can tide you over for quite some time. Won't have perfect clarity, and not the most comfy to your ears, but they work, and just require a USB or mic slot.
---
hurr durr
---
&gt;Imagine thinking that people are good or bad based on ~~their team colours in a game~~ average observed behavior of the teams they chose
---
ftfy
---
&gt; Paladins: Meme-tanks. Can do alright in dungeons if played well and geared appropriately, and have some limited utility in aoe pulls due to snap aoe threat, but this is not worth bringing a prot paladin for.
---
If you think paladins are meme-tanks there's no convincing/discussing this further, you're clearly stuck in 2004.
---
I don't even feel like bringing up the topic of priests being able to raid tank.
---
you literally just made this exact thread but 75/25
---
Have you seen what the undead do they are clearly the baddies
---
You can start solo zf graveyard as early as 42 l, but i did on 44 - now I'm 53, still doing it. Will be there probably until 56 if its possible because i dont care about being slow, since it's a gold making alt only. 
---
At first it's incredible xp\h and even now on 53 its like 15% of lvl per run or something close to that, with ton of gold as well. And you don't need invis pots like you do in maraudon, just a win win to me. I'm not even sure if I'll make it to 60 tbh, since i probably don't need it heh. If i do ill just proceed with brd/lbrs cleaves.
---
why do i always see people bitching about one of the like 2 or 3 ally dominated servers in all of classic and everyone agrees with the complaint yet if anyone bitches about one of the MANY horde dominated servers everyone says "durrrr get good hehehehe ecksdee thats pvp server." isnt this server pve? who gives a shit if its imbalanced.
---
He's a piece of shit scammr tho. 900 gold from a guy and he's even banned from the Noggenfogger disc. Just a shady fuck.
---
Yep, viable and oh man the gold as well.
---
 *When Alexander saw the breadth of his domain, he wept for there were no more worlds to conquer*
---
Exactly. If the only thing you're going to use it for is talking to others on Discord for raid coordination, than the basic mic attached to a headset works just fine. You only need a dedicated microphone if you're a streamer, or record video where audio quality is very important.
---
Obviously statistics change over time, but my comment about alliance being the majority is *still* true as of writing this reply.
---
If you look at **recent** data (7 days old or newer), the percentages favor alliance. As I said in my previous post, it's probably fair to assume something closer to equality in terms of what you'd be exposed to in-game.
---
I am not sure why people want to believe that every server has alliance outnumbered, when data clearly shows that as untrue.
---
Horde: "What did it cost?"  
---
Their honor for the week "Everything."
---
Dont give away the secret man, we have a good balance here.
---
Yea sry first time posting and a massage told me it didnt work so i posted again
---
I am full blown fury DW 
---
And I can easily rank any dungeon and off tank MC. Just need gear
---
You must have played on some carebear RP server. People did this shit all the time back in vanilla on my pvp server.
---
There's a good chance that it'll be sped up with the rapidity in which they're doling out vanilla content. Still gonna suck though.
---
Lucifron is 81/19
---
He is making them up
---
&gt;since there are no real ways to find out 
---
My sweet summer child.
---
It's pretty balanced. I play horde and you usually do 3 corpse jumps to get to any instance.
---
Sounds like farming the server to death was worth it. Yikes.
---
Completely agree. I know a lot of people are #nOchAnGEs but the arena's of TBC were an excellent addition. If they could somehow balance the effort and rewards to keep battlegrounds relevant alongside arena, that'd be perfect, imo.
---
I guess it's only fair that hordies ruin the game and allys decide to ruin the sub with top posts being the same joke for a month.
---
My Druid got it on first run too but like 40 runs and still haven’t seen bone ring helm 🥺
---
Sure, tell me which server and I'll come up with something for you.
---
Not really sure how viable the lashers in dme are, since its just few packs with not great xp, probably better to just find aoe farming groups
---
I have never played on the server buddy
---
Imagine it's a meme, you dip
---
heh was expecting to hook in Brisc with that comment but nice to see someone else from Bloodfin.
---
&gt; A trash talking bickering with your sibling community, but tight knit non the less. 
---
Things definitely got pretty heated and looking back some of my behaviour on the forums crossed the line.
---
I don't remember Coors/CxC, might have been after I left with TR for Lineage 2.  I do remember a similar story though, a bunch of FIGHT were stood around on Naboo unflagged with a bunch of Imperials.  I think it was Kain who wasn't with us and decided to accept a bunch of guild wars without telling us, and we promptly got wiped and camped for ages.
---
On ND pvt server last year was my first MMO for 12 years, had a few people from Bloodfin message me to say hi.
---
&gt; Good to know man, thank you for the knowledge upgrade!
---
It's too bad this knowledge is completely false. Shaman tanks are in a super good place in TBC. The fact, that shamans are on the Alliance is a huge thing for shaman tanking, defensive-wise. The implementation of gems and their ability to compensate in lacking areas is godly. Hunters get Misdirection, etc... I suggest listening to people who are more verified/acknowledged by the community for knowing their field. Although, there isn't a guide for TBC sham tanking, I suggest starting with the ClassicWoW guide [version for](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=1150) shaman tanking.
---
It was a good call. Whenever I play Horde I roll Blood Elf. Undead and goblins aren’t too bad either, but I just can’t do the troll, the cow or the Orc. Silvermoon City is one of my favorite places in the game too.
---
It's real nice to know, I have a lvl51 alt there that I have been looking to play in a couple months, was afraid server would be "dead" by then, guess it won't be /cheer
---
Was joking cause you have to kill like 1-2 trash mobs on the way to the arena and the little dudes that come out of the door before the boss as well
---
This ganking issue was in Vanilla since day 1. 
---
It's almost 2 decades old. Blinders to vanilla's critical faults caused this as much as Blizzard's apathy. gankers always existed
---
its pretty clear why pvp servers were removed in retail. thankfully blizz has no reason to listen to you shitheads for classic.
---
I don't think he was expecting people to self select into 50-50 servers.
---
"Self regulate" just means "don't exploit the random size advantage you have to turn a victory into a corpse-camp humiliation and griefing".
---
The true night elf experience
---
Which hordie is it? A bunch have hand of rag and a bunch are douchey (although some are pretty cool).
---
Are the hordes there sitting all day just to snipe the occasional passerby? I'm really interested to know their motivation, there's no way they can actually rank in this way, especially in a group.
---
&gt; Because that's the exception not the rule. Far more servers are horde dominated.
---
That just isn't true. I mean you can at least read, can't you? https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community
---
It's not the Horde's fault majority of the Alliance players suck at PvP or only want to PvP when it benefits them. This is also an issue on Retail not just in PvP but for Raids as well. **The fact is Alliance just attracts the worst of the worst players.**
---
You need to look at loyalty bar near pet icon. Not in you character menu. Cause in character menu is always green.
---
Thier is a difference between eating a spoonful of horse radish and a whole jar of it
---
I somewhat agree that PvE gear shouldn't be BIS in PvP, but it also shouldn't be completely useless as it was in BC (with the exception of weapons).
---
Also their Rep Bonus in TBC saves an astonishing amount of time.
---
WHAT!? this has to be sarcasm. EVERY POST IS ABOUT THE HORDE.
---
"We are getting Ganked."
---
"Horde own if"
---
"Watch this gif of horde owning me"
---
"Here's a pic of me running with 100 horde chasing me"
---
A massive amount of people *did* want bigger server caps because of queue times (a lot of people didn't realize that this could affect gameplay and thought it was compatible with "no changes").
---
I think that superior organization and communication is a bigger factor than large severs. Communities in WoW classic are a lot bigger than they were in vanilla, and not because of server caps.
---
why is your best buddy thinking about bread for sale
---
80% of EU realms are way unbalanced, with 75% Horde supremacy. The Spanish PvP realm is no different than Lucifron.
---
So you expect me to believe a class that relies on janky mechanics, farming and enchanting throw away weapons, and a lvl 40 helmet for the entire game isnt meme af? Hilarious
---
&gt; So classic lost almost like 70% of it’s intitial population.
---
Or it still has the same population but people aren't logged in 24/7 like they were the first few weeks.
---
Queues are based on concurrent players, not total population.
---
Hunters or druids.
---
&gt; who gives a shit if its imbalanced.
---
The players on the imbalanced  end. . .
---
Isn't UberDanger the guy who fucks 15 year old girls "because it's legal in his country" and gets all his youtuber friends to up vote his reddit threads? I can't separate art from the artist lol, that guy is a fucking creep
---
It is shitty and thats why it is as removed eventually. Because blizzard realized it breeds toxic behavior rather then encourage friendly competition. But that is more the players fault, for being what they are. Toxic self centered assholes.
---
Even the best of intentions can't save you from the players who doesn't give a fuck.
---
Right ? They have server transfer options but don’t use them. They stay on a PvP server where they know there’s is a faction imbalance and they knew phase 2 was going to be hell, having honor but no BGs. No idea what they expected
---
They don’t. They just buy another account.
---
No top tier raiding guild has a ret paladin. Any raiding guild that does is doing so knowing they are taking a handicap, and they are fine with that for whatever reason.
---
I won't knock anybody who brings along a ret paladin to a raid. That's up to them, and what I think on the matter is irrelevant.
---
But don't try to convince people that a ret paladin is a worthwhile addition to a raid group attempting to optimize itself. It simply isn't. Any potential benefit that a ret paladin would bring could be brought by a holy paladin, who would also contribute top tier tank healing.
---
Don't get me wrong, I love paladins. I mained one in vanilla and through Cata. But I am not so blinded by my love of the class to not see the unfortunate flaws in it in classic.
---
Bank it til ya get more. 6 piece sc/2 devilsaur out performs non sc pre-BiS with 1-2 random raid epics

As a horde on Flamelash, good job Kitty! Reading these replys about people creating allys on the realm is fantastic! It’s a shame almost everyone left, but it’s awesome you’re making something out of it - atleast you’re the #1 alliance guild on Flamelash! I will definitely help all of you in the wild if you’re ever struggling with mobs! Not all undead rogues are baddies. :)
---
Sure, but statistically and historically, it's the horde that's been the dicks, and most PvP servers had and kept the Horde majority from the start.
---
Lmao, it's hilarious to blame every individual for faction imbalance and thus indirectly for you getting ganked. That's possibly the least sensible place to seek the guilt. If you are gonna think like that there are a million things you could point as being the cause.
---
Besides that, faction imbalance is very clearly not the cause of the problem. There is plenty of servers where alliance is bigger and the situation isn't all that different. Horde just seem to do it more.
---
Also, even if horde have more players, those of them not participating in this gankfest still don't make a difference in the outcome of wpvp balance. It just doesnt make sense
---
&gt;to say that anyone who contributes in any way is totally without any culpability is ridiculous.
---
No it is not. If someone says "man I hate the Lakers" and then someone hears that and has a mental illness and for some reason takes that person's words as their reason to go commit a shooting at a basketball game, nobody would say he carries the blame. Technically he still contributed.
---
You could also say that people who live in tribes in the amazon contribute to climate change because they breathe out carbondioxide. Would you say they are to blame as well?
---
To act as if anyone who contributes to something in any way carries guild is just stupid.
---
Ive been leveling a dual wield warrior on the side. Most dungeons I can top dps meter which validates my choice of weapons. However, im unsure what I should be looking for in an off hand weapon. Stat stick, super fast, mace?  Please help.
---
&gt; Does faction population affect anything on pve server?
---
AQ progression, a pretty major thing.
---
There was way more Alliance than Horde on many servers. Everything the Horde is accused of now is the classic playbook for the Alliance back then. 
---
Rose colored glasses and all
---
I’m only one of those, but I’m friends with a lot of gay vegans
---
It does not mean people are leaving. It might, but it just as likely could be that people are raid logging leveling alts, taking some time off for the holidays, or are PvPing instead of farming.
---
Multiple accounts.
---
Take a break for a month and come back. No need to get frustrated.
---
What I'm advocating is the opposite of conservatism, but okeeyyyy yeetboi.
---
Indepth discussion for any game is suprisingly lacking online. I played a fuckton of competitive games and found out that forums for them are worthless like 99% of the time unless you are new. I heard the class discords are decent, but havent tried it myself.
---
He's a thief who should work on his strained Danglish.
---
&gt; I do wish there were more horde, but in the end, the imbalance doesn't matter.
---
It will once AQ progression starts.

---
I hope the horde guys keep doing god's work
---
What the fuck are you talking about?
---
The economy is fine and our server is not "absolute chaos" all the time.
---
I think they’re raiding with multiple groups soon with all these members. Join!
---
And I bet they're the ones min/maxing, wanting 40 players in MC and Onyxia and absolutely no Boomkins or Ret Pallies forgetting that we're actually playing patch 1.12 and not early Vanilla 2004!!! Often confusing viable and optimal because they don't know what either of those words mean.
---
Horde will still camp alliance because they'll have longer queues.
---
There's a metric ton of Alli death balls and Alli camping the sewers in uc.
---
It was one of the best business decisions. It's just there's so many weebs playing this game that they can't resist playing Blood Elves.
---
I can't stand them and the fact that we had to wait until BFA to get a different Horde Paladin race was criminal.
---
Nobody does. Reality never matches up to  rose tinted nostalgia
---
He's just respecting the 1v1, you dying is not on him.  
---
    
---
He's right, you ARE a clown :p
---
I will be lvl 55 by the time AV comes out. Is it possible to level with the repeatable quests in AV (to farm rep while leveling)?
---
I picked horde because I couldn't convince my irl friends to go alliance. I still kind of wish I were a paladin, but I love my troll priest all the same. That is to say, I agree choice faction doesn't really say much about players.
---
Ahh, thank you, good to know. My Warrior is 52 and this technique works well so far leveling, but I am obviously not well geared yet. 
---
Cheers!
---
That’s how it’s implemented in TBC. There’s a LFG pane where you list your group and what instance you’re looking to do. It’s a simple matchmaker where the players do the matching, but it’s also global so you don’t have to be in a major city, like you do with trade chat.
---
It isn’t cross-realm though. Just another reason why many consider TBC to be the best iteration of old WoW before they started designing the game around mass appeal vs building communities.
---
 Except it isnt, like the other guy said. There has been quite a few private servers where the faction imbalanced caused the server to pretty much die off.
---
First by Alliance not being able to play and then horde running out of things to do since bg ques were 20+ minutes.
---
Kitty doesnt sound like a kings name.. a queen maybe? 
---
Queen of the Alliance needs YOU! 
---
*Long live the queen!*
---
Tfw you get released into depressing desolace instead of the rolling hills of Mulgore
---
The problem is how much better Horde racials were in vanilla.
---
Playing Alliance means intentionally being weaker.
---
Because it isn’t Blizzards fault that a level 60 kills all the Alliance in redridge until they get chased off. 
---
It’s the toxic, rampant, “You’re not allowed to play my game” mentality.
---
Alliance players comforting each other over reddit. *
---
Are you sure? 
---
What kind of gear, enchants and potions were you using when you tested this?
---
You seriously underestimate how easy it is to farm BGs with a premade even if it consits of keyboard turners. Random groups are always worse. The occasional premade you face and possibly lose doesn't mean anything because you will win at least 70% of all BGs.
---
You do realize that site is just as inaccurate as every other, right?
---
got full necrophile set twice, epic robe from Ras, and seen various other items before I got my wand.. total runs was 60+ in Scholo
---

---
Shit like this is how Flamelash happened
---
People are more efficient and aware more like thanks to the internet and just availability of knowledge in general. The average WoW player now is way better than 15 years ago thanks to widespread access of information and tactics, and this creates this Min/Max culture that's currently plaguing classic. I honestly believe even if we had the same population caps we'd still have the current incessant ganking issues, just to a smaller level, as opposed to almost every single zone. From all accounts of friends who've played during vanilla it was never like this not because people couldn't, but because they didn't know that they should(or shouldn't)
---
I still get triggered thinking about what SOE did to our community. The closest thing I've found since has been in EVE.
---
I guess you haven't realized that most of the major problems we're dealing with now are the direct result of changes?
---
Overpopulation = constant camping of the minority faction = minority faction fleeing via free transfers (another change) = completely broken WPvP.
---
All of this could've been avoided with smaller servers and no free transfers.
---
Imagine being the only rogue with like 100 hk’s a week and getting grand marshal.
---
Pacifists should get the fuck off PvP servers, they are a complete waste of space.
---
I wasn't even the aggressor this time, I was 5 levels lower than my opponent, and I didn't even have full HP or my warlock pet up.
---
I was attacked, and he stood right next to me and watched me get slaughtered.
---
I hate people like that, and there is a shitton of them on the alliance, unfortunately.
---
This is the answer
---
Thank you!
---
What? Just go resto balance get cenarion and have one set. Or hotw resto and get cenarion. Will work for pvp/pve and whatever. Very few druids go full tank/dps in late game for raid or pvp. If they do then they still wont need all the sets you are listing thats insane lol
---
EVE was set up entirely to allow for that style of gameplay to actually function. Not to mention people aren't stuck on rails based on what race they rolled at the beginning; you can change sides.
---
Thanks!!
---
Paladin auras are not significant outside of resist auras, and those are easily provided by holy paladins, since holy paladins are tank healers and tanks are the ones most likely to require the extra resistance. BoP is indeed useful, but again, could be provided by a holy paladin. LoH is very situational, and for those few situations where it helps a lot (I remember a strat for Patchwerk involving LoH on the tank to provide the 30% bonus armor for 2 min, which greatly eased the burden on healers) a holy paladin can provide it.
---
The one point I will grat you is 100% uptime on judgment debuffs. But the problem here is that those debuffs are of limited use. Crusader only buffs holy damage, and so while it's very useful for a ret paladin, that's it. Nobody raids as a smite priest. Light is of some limited benefit in healing melee, but sadly the amount of healing it provides is not sufficient for the healers to be able to not heal melee for fights that require it. At best, with god-like healers, it might slightly reduce how much they have to heal. Wisdom, I'll grant, is pretty nice for long fights (of which only Onyxia really qualifies), but again, its not really required for anything, and if there were a fight where healers or dps were having mana issues, a holy paladin could step up and keep the judgement up on the boss.
---
Paladins are a really cool class, and I love them, but in classic, two of their three specs are severely crippled. TBC fixes a lot of this, and while I understand the #nochanges crowd, I do kinda wish that paladins had a few things from their TBC kit to help in these areas they are lacking.
---
Nah. When time comes horde can organize and put all resources required for basically free in bulks at neutral AH, then set a truce of no aggression until gates are open. This way ally will have free path to deliver the resources. Plus a few can create alts and proceed this way as the deliver boie.
---

---
PvP you want Broken Tooth which you get from the Badlands in the late 30s. I think the best PvP attack speed pet early on is The Rake in Mulgore iirc. For leveling it doesn’t matter too much. I like having something tanky for questing like a boar, a turtle, or a gorilla and then like a cat or wolf for dungeons. I think cats do more damage but the Furious Howl buff from wolves is pretty nice. All just up to preference though, play around with them, but don’t get too attached to them besides maybe one because there are only 3 pet slots you can have and I find myself constantly changing between one or two of them. Petopia is my bible for anything related to hunter pets, I would definitely recommend reading through whatever you’re interested in there. 
---
Enchants while leveling aren’t too needed unless you just want to have them. Run speed on boots is nice but while traveling you’ll have cheetah on anyways until you get your mount. Definitely still worth considering though. 
---
Also, big tip, being way more ammo then you think you need to. You probably won’t find a sweet spot until you’ve been questing for a bit and go straight into a dungeon and run out of ammo and look like an idiot (at least, that’s what happened to me in WC). It’s kind of hard to gauge how much you need when you first start. 
---
And just aside from that, keep pet on passive ALWAYS, growl off for dungeons, dismiss before jumping ledges. And if you’re in a group try not to mess up or at least be apologetic. The huntard image has improved since vanilla but it still exists and people will seem to judge your mistakes harder than other classes.
---
Hunter followed by druids are the fastest levelers. Mages can be quick if you know what your doing but a lot of time spent drink. Hunters it’s almost auto pilot and can take down elite mobs and mob a lot higher level. Druids it can be tricky to down elites for quest. There is a reason so many good farmers are hunters.
---
"Thanks @ all the people I annoyed for help" sums up wow classic pretty well
---
You would have got me sooner if I wasn't on a fleet right now, lol.
---
So your single guiding moral principle is FOMO.  Got it.
---
That's the issue though, People do like PvP in small skirmishes like it was before P2 and you don't get that experience in PvE servers.
---
What's going on right now is Zerging and that's a failure on Blizzards part by over populating servers. Maybe it wouldn't of been so bad if they kept phasing to separate people till it died down.
---
I can understand you here. I sometimes message people from their AH listing. It works on occasion.
---
Thank you for mentioning this. SoR does proc effects, not SoC. Since SoR gives 2 chances for a proc per melee, does this mean that it would be better than Seal of the Crusader, as that's only a 40% increase in attack speed?
---
corehound belts for palas+druids
---
I leveled from 28 to 60 in dungeons aside from a few levels between sm and zf and zf and brd it seems like a really popular path
---
&gt;site is just as inaccurate as every other
---
And why do you think so?
---
Thanks thats at least Something to go on
---
No system in the game forces you to make the game unplayable.
---
Fucking christ 90% of the people doing this shit arent even going to come anywhere close to rank 13 or 14, they just shit on their server due to being idiots.
---
Just to be clear, the honor anyone earned doing this is a fucking pittance compared to what even shitty premades will grind out from bgs.
---
Massacring your server does not mean you actually have a chance at the higher ranks.
---
I mean yeah, PvP servers are mained by horde, have you seen those orc and undead racials? Crazy stuff
---
It WOULD’VE been exactly like this on private servers too—if the population hadn’t been mostly balanced like it was. Population balance ensures that neither faction can have too many people doing stuff like this, because the other faction is large enough that they’ll eventually stop the camper. 
---
Like the other guy said (and you disregarded), look at servers where Alliance is the majority. They do the same shit.
---
The ? Was who is better at doing quest hunter are faster leveling of course not better at quest overall
---
OP obviously
---
sorry for necro-posting but i gotta ask you
---
Been raiding with a dif class for a while and am considering leveling either a rogue or a shadow priest ONLY for pvp, particularly BGs
---
An important aspect is, I dont intent to gear that alt beyond blue pvp set, no raids beyond the occasional pug
---
Which one can I pull it off the best? casual fun times
---
No problem. I'll admit, I had the same thoughts as you leveling up. So here's a tip about fury warriors: get the hit cap (6% with 305 weapon skill) and then stack crit. Because it's that crit that gives you flurry uptime, which not only gives you more damage, but also more rage, which means more damage (and also more flurry uptime when those abilities crit). This is the cycle of warrior dps that allows them to dominate so hard.
---
Also, consumables, raid buffs, and world buffs have a dramatic effect on your crit %. I consider myself decently geared (not top tier, but well enough), and in berserker stance I have 28% crit. But then you add in 2 elemental sharpening stones (2% crit each), a mongoose elixir (2% crit and 25 agility, which is 1.25% crit before kings), mark of the wild and blessing of kings (which varies based on gear, but I've found it gives me roughly 2-3% crit from the agility), and leader of the pack (5%) and all of that gives you 12% crit, just from consumables and buffs. That puts me at 40% crit. If you add in world buffs, I start pushing into the high 40s, which means I'm past the crit softcap. That's why flurry uptime is not a big deal. You don't have to worry about world buffs (I applaud those who do, I just don't have the time/energy for it) and you still will have near 100% uptime.
---
Is there a website that is up to date that I can check out to see faction and class distribution on servers?
---
I'm trying to finish leveling on Skeram as Horde and the Alliance regularly control EPL/WPL, UnGoro, and contest Thorium Point/Kargath pass/BRM frequently.  It's def imbalanced in favor of Horde but the Alliance are far from helpless.
---
*On certain servers
---
&gt;"warrior [tied for 2nd best at leveling]"
---
I see you've never leveled a Warrior before.
---
They're the absolute worst. Your damage is crap and you have to eat/bandage every other mob. Even with a equal-level blue weapon, things are still pretty rough compared to other classes.
---
Tauren could be Paladins as of cata iirc
---
So crit and mp5 are sustain stats they help you heal for longer periods of time. Healing power makes those heals more powerful, but keep in mind the spell coefficient. Int increases crit and mana pool. Not alot of int is available on good pieces of gear. And the current content doesnt require alot of long fights
---
If theoretically 2 pieces of gear has the same total weight when all said and done. I'd go with the one with more int. If int isnt a factor go with the one with more healing power. Crit &gt; mp5 if equal
---
Int &gt;/= healing power &gt;&gt; spellcrit &gt; mp5
---
Then you didn't play on high pop servers in vanilla because shit like this happened all the time.
---
Yeah no shit you don't. I'm just replying to the guy 'who posted on reddit' and said people still there were ignorant. He's literally just stroking his own ego there.
---
TRUE
---
Lol and get stream sniped all day every day.  Level 11 forever.
---
I've played on Tichondrius since Vanilla. I certainly did want world PvP. Which is exactly what you got before P2. PvP on a PvP server has NEVER been like this before ever. It was fine before P2 because phasing was still a thing if they kept phasing till P2 died down it would of been fine.
---
P2 is not a good representation of what World PvP is like 99% of the time thru out WoWs history.
---
Yeah this data is super old
---
Just bring back the wintergrasp buff from WOTLK.
---
If a faction is out numbered in a zone they turn into a raid boss. Problem solved.
---
Maybe not zone wide because this could cause problems with stealth abuse. 
---
So maybe something more dynamic, like proximity and player ratio discrepancies.  
---
This would avoid a lesser pop faction rogue from having a huge zone wide buff to use against a solo player. 
---
This buff would only work in contested territories, and for the faction that controls that territory.
---
do you not agree?
---
I farmed ur mom for weeks nerd
---
You’re gonna tell me that servers went 95-5 in population differences because of rampant ganking in Vanilla, where there were more Horde in IF than TB?
---
Wait... You cheated? Isn't it kinda ironic when you're saying how kind he was when you deceived him? Lol
---
Was running a wailing caverns run on my alt character until I got this whisper from a blizzard administrator GM.
---
PS. Arugal realm
---
Why? Elaborate please. All you do on a hunter is melee and spam wing clip, which is the exact same as a warrior melee + spam hamstring.
---
There aren't.
---
The argument isn't that change is always good, it's that creating the perfect restoration of the past is impossible and so focusing on that is a mistake.
---
I'd like to know too.
---
Everytime i did haggling with a serious offer through mail , ive logged with the item codded to my pleasure . If you are patient and offer a decent price and take time to write a adequate message , it cant be refused unless the seller doesn't really want to sell afterall.
---
&gt;bro it doesn't matter
---
&gt;bro just let it go
---
&gt;"I'm right just stop arguing"
---
Ret mains, everyone.
---
Would love to see the "statistics" that show horde are usually dicks, sounds like it's a very scientific study!
---
Whoever you are you sound like most of your kills are worth 10 honor and you probably suck at the game
---
Hunters are actually faster when it comes speed run to 60. It doesn’t take much skill either compared to a Druid in hard fights doing elite quest solo. Hunters get aspect of the cheetah to which gives speed boost pre 40 mount. Druid’s you’ll have to spec into their run increase. They can easily take down higher level elites than their level for elite quest no need to find groups waiting as where druids won’t have the dps needed and will have switch out of cat or bear form to get a heal off multi times which you’ll take a lot of dmg and higher chance you’ll die. Feign death on hunters saves them GY run better than Druid’s swiftness skill since it doesn’t work well when you have some kind of slow. I mean hunters basically have a personal tank with them certain pets can take a lot of damage it’s just you see a lot of hunters go with a pet that does more dps instead of one with high defense. So on average it’s definitely hunters but Druid’s are most likely second I would say
---
lets spam them with some swear word emails and passwords
---
Wonder if there was at least someone with 80IQ from those RetailWoW developers on innitial brainstorming on how to solve the lauch. Really noone pointed out or thought about faction specific ques/caps?  
---
And for anyone sayin it is not possible to implement and so on, fu\*\* that logic. That was the reason you get free transfer balance without faction specific because it was unable to implement. Few weeks later? Faction spec transfers.   
---
Just stop believeing that Blizzard is handling Classic well, of course they don t and it is just money making product. 
---
Luckily there is not a single word about fixing the most gamebreaking bugs so we can "abuse" them for our own fun, or for 5hours turtle WSG? Can t wait to be banned for spacebar by this indie company.
---
Downvote as much as you want, just recall the facts and impact on actual gameplay for you in long term. It will never be vanilla, just classic with retailers : )
---
In numbers it is, in practice it's not because the Olympus mouth breathers can't actually play the game.
---
No, I just don't like to have my so called "team" stand there and jerk off to me getting pummeled.
---
When I see my team struggles I always try to rush to their aid and help them out.
---
Players didn't change.  The difference is server caps and queues more than anything else.
---
I made a comment saying how bs phase 2 looked from a new player and everyone ripped into me saying nothing will change and to suck it up, that it didnt come to early and you shouldnt have rolled  pvp if you werent gonna take it seriously blah blah. Truth is, the best thing about this game is the community and the open world feeling. The pvp just makes the game feel real and alive. If you pit everyone against each other at all times you literally just made the game all about that one aspect. I dont mind pvp but I also dont have time to be good at pvp and regardless even if ur an elite player you still get shit heads who farm you for honor and noone wants to be ganked 24/7. I know a lot of you guys want the original classic wow but this pvp system is hella broken IMO and i’ve quit playing until it calms down.
---
Nah, months are just longer weeks.
---
I personally have been doing sm runs lvling a buddy and get 20-30g an hour depending on what bosses drop. Most efficient thing is just clearing all of the cathedral and skipping trash in the courtyard. 
---
And I’ve been running around epl farming bats and the glade areas(evil bat eyes sell for 65s each on the ah on my server, people getting ready for dark moon faire) I’m also a miner/herbalist so even finding the occasional node brings in some extra cash.
---
“You should put effort into helping me even though you have no obligation to because I’m losing my 1v1!!!”
---
Good argument.
---
of course it is sweetie
---
Lmfao at this post. One person’s anecdote is clearly enough evidence to counter the hundreds of alliance players who say the contrary. Not to mention that there is always a chance that you’re playing in the outlier server.
---
Even with that, it's still less proc chances than a warrior.
---
2 proc chances every 3.6 seconds VS 3 proc chances every 3.6 seconds for a warrior.
---
YOU get your facts straight. Thanks.
---
The private server thing is because there was no other server option for alliance. Therefore pops were almost identical so horde couldn't get away with this bullshit on imbalanced servers.
---
&gt; or do a paid server transfer
---
a what?
---
Because the game rewards them for being shitty.  Is that hard to understand? 
---
And that was made worse by blizzards insane server size decision at the start of classic.
---
This is 100% the fault of the secs.  They could have taken many steps within nochanges to fix it.  They didn't and the only decisions they made made it worse.
---
You haven't taken into account the community has been changed itself. Mechanics of the game since p2 hit was extremely similar to vanilla without any crucial changes.
---
Nah, I just want a team to actually back me up. Not stand there and jerk off to the sight of me getting my ass kicked.
---
and even if it was 2v1, he still wouldn't have aided me because "I didn't die, did I?".
---
Is that why it was an Alliance guild who was world first in MC and Ony? Probably in BWL too soon enough.
---
Why do they even want to open the AQ gates? There's a bunch of zerg bugs and aliens and sphinxes and all kinds of death inside there. Better keep it locked up haha
---
You’re misunderstanding his point.  If a raid is trying to kill a world boss, they want the other players to stay dead after they killed them so they can focus on the boss.  Res timers allow them some extra time to secure a kill before the opposite faction can respawn.
---
I’m at 3300 unbuffed and haven’t died to trash in weeks. For the packs after Garr some of our melee sit out on the two fire mobs but if you stay out of the fire that drops after they die and pay any attention to your health so you can just back off and bandage if you take any damage you should be fine.
---
....way too committed.
---
Misguided revenvge? 
---
HAHAHAHA! 
---
I'm joining every PVP raid to make Benediction-Horde's life miserable and return the favor. Camp you all for hours and make the game unplayable till you all are forced to quit and we have Gnome Rogues being the new Undead Rogues.
---
And English/German 😉🤘🏼
---
Yeah plenty of PvP action on my server (Ashkandi), it just doesn’t happen in the middle of questing or farming etc.
---
You know, you’ve got a good point. I still don’t think that this is Blizzards fault, but maybe people in general are just shit. I’m used to dying to Horde all the time so I’m probably just jaded at this point
---
Now, forgive me, I am only using my memory, not looking it up. But is this because both faction's war effort needs to be completed before the gates can be opened?
---
Flamelash started as a 60/40 server, even in October/November it was 60/40. Blizz fucked up by allowing alliance to transfer off and create this mess.
---
I think this could have easily been avoided with smaller server pops and faction queues. Blizzard was so concerned with the long-term health of classic that they sacrificed its short-term health.
---
Great English there at the beginning...
---
I have no clue what do you mean, if you aren't flagged for pvp, they cannot touch you. I mean, you are playing on PVE server like a person like you absolutely should have been playing, right?
---
Of course not. You should get stomped into the ground. It's an RPG. The stompees are motivated by the stompers to invest their time and become more powerful.
---
If you didn't get to stomp those players who are weaker than you (retail), there'd be no point in investing time in your character.
---
I say this as an alliance who has 3x60's and a 40 on a 70/30 horde dominated server.
---
Link? Last metrics i saw placed ally at around 55/45
---
For about two days after the first Wrath content update patch Ret Paladins were absolute *gods.* Blizzard hotfixed them due to extreme outcry in the forums. They were nearly unkillable. We had a Belf Paladin running around Westfall on our PvE server, destroying *everything,* and it took a small raid party to take him down a couple times. Even then he demolished them solo.
---
They had finally gotten the love they lacked in Vanilla, but it was fleeting, lol.
---
Where in my post did I say Horde in classic had better PvE racials
---
Shouldn’t that be achieved by graveyard placement then? Not to mention that is an incredibly small part of the games content.
---
Agreed. If a pre-raid BiS or better geared holy paladin is raid buffed and using proper consumables they can spam max rank flash of light constantly even if they ignore every other stat but +healing. If you're interested in diving deeper into the math you can play around with this healing [spreadsheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mG8IlEdbUGukRWfZdWxth42zcsyN1OoD/view?usp=sharing) I made.
---
The alliance needs 10,000 purple lotus!
---
Worst part here is if they continue to do so, it means someone still is baited.
---
Nah bro, this is Reddit. If you're not exaggerating to the point of basically straight up lying, you aren't doing it right. My server has had multiple points of data pointing to a close 55/45 Horde favor, but you still get Alliance complaining that Horde must be 80/20. Forget the 20-30 Alliance that are stationed outside BRD multiple times a day. The full raid group in Hillsbrad. The half a dozen Alliance roaming Un'Goro. The 4 stealthed rogues sitting just outside Kargath. The 10 Alliance sitting at the Bulwark. Nah, none of those count. 
---
Horde is DEFINITELY more organized on my server, but it has to do with leadership in the major guilds, not some vast faction imbalance.
---
Well, if we ever get Classic-TBC, I might see it. As I said, I cannot comment on shamans, as I play alliance. When I did play TBC, there were a few shaman that toyed with tanking in 5-mans, but it was never taken seriously, so I have no experience to draw upon.
---
He said he also plays a Warrior.
---
Ok bye
---
If this was available I’d straight up transfer to low pop, level, and then pay to go home.
---
You're not though, lol. By sheer playtime maybe but you're clearly deluding yourself into thinking you're a total vegetable. You've obviously read a lot of guides and stuff about the inner workings of the game. Hence, not a noob.
---
That’s stupid, I’m on a horde dominated server and all the alliance can do is camp questing areas, yeah I don’t care they kill me but I think it’s stupid that they get honor for killing someone 10 levels lower than them.. that makes 0 sense
---
Wait....isn't that like, what defines it.... Am I getting wooshed? I hate getting wooshed....
---
Idk what that sub is but it sounds more lit than all these boring-ass text posts about how the game should be different
---
Sure the Honor system is the same as Vanilla the population being so high per server wasn't and thats the crucial point. In Vanilla you could escape the ganking, in Classic it's not possible because of over population which was being curved by phasing which Blizzard removed at a terrible time.
---
Too bad.
---
It was in the game until Cataclysm prepatch.
---
Can't lose something you don't have.
---
&gt; small vocal minority who decided to finally turn warmode off
---
wut
---
You lose less raid dps from having a hunter go nightfall compared to an OT using it instead of just fury dpsing.
---
I’m almost tempted to make a character on Flamelash and rp looking for the survivors. Wouldn’t /who for anyone, would just come across a member of the surviving guild naturally and join them. The idea of not knowing if a city or town will be safe or infested with a group of horde is kind of interesting for RP purposes. 
---
In a weird way, PVP made just another PVP server into arguably one of the best servers for RP.
---
&gt;the population being so high per server
---
What's your server?
---
This really doesn’t deserve downvotes. Fury/Prot offers almost nothing over Fury/Arms when it comes to dungeons, AND it loses Tactical Mastery: basically no access to intercept, mocking blow and WW.
---
Lol fair enough! If I feel this way, I doubt im the only one though. Just my two sense. In no way do I not want you guys to keep having fun. Just not a game for me anymore. Cheers
---
No they didn't, because blizz didn't allow free transfer off servers unless there was a queue
---
Try playing around with making your own WeakAuras. Very rewarding once you get the hang of it.
---
His reading comprehension definitely matches the quality of his opinions
---
God just the name “Camelot Unchained” is so cringe to me. The name alone tells you the designers choices are questionable and the game will suck. I’d love a new MMO similar to WoW though.
---
&gt; Classic needs to follow OSRS and have a in-game poll system. That way the community can decide the direction of the game. 
---
That's called retail.
---
No he isn't. He just calls people out.
---
1. Both of your servers had a free transfer option so it was a choice either to move or to play on bigger realm. Looks like you have done yours.
---
2. Regardless of your choice, Skeram recent concurrent online is 3.3k peak weekend, 4.5k peak wednesday (raid time = raiding in MC, not affecting open world much). Vanilla concurrent cap was 3-3.5k, so I hardly can call it "being so high".
---
Sulfuras concurrent online is steadily below 4k, around 3.5-3.8k at peaks which, again, is more equal to vanilla high/full populated server.
---
Rogues have more going on then 1 button spam. You have to constantly manage and make decisions based off your combo points and energy pooling. Keeping SnD up weaving autos/SS or Bacstabs and when possible throwing an eviscerate in there. Everything is more basic in classic but mages have legit easy mode.
---
Ironforge.pro
---
Olympus finally hosting a PvP event for their members - amazing to see the guild turning things around.
---
Fuck man tell me about it.  People can be such trash sometimes (all the time, at least on the internet)
---
Because it's the same as it was in vanilla. There are a lot of nonsensical things in vanilla from current player mentality standpoint, this is one of them.
---
&gt;lissen, lissen. listen to me.
---
Adding arena to classic would be interesting; but it would have some truly terrible balance.
---
Anyone know for certain what the exalted av mount costs? I’ve tried googling around and using old wowhead comments but I’ve heard both 640g and 560g.
---
OH should be fast I would say and your MH should be the highest dos of the 2 weapons at choice
---
Deine :P
---
Call it whatever you want, still cunts out there
---
If you think being capable of tanking in MC means that you can be a raid tank, then you are grossly mistaken.
---
If you wish, I can go into detail the downsides of paladin tanks, but judging on your attitude and your unwillingness to provide logical arguments and evidence in favor of your position, I somehow doubt that my arguments would serve any purpose to you.
---
But just in case there are those who are interested, there are 4 things paladins suffer from that hinders their ability to raid tank. First is single-target threat generation. With the discovery of the GBoK spam for threat, this has largely been solved, however, as dps get more geared in future raids, we'll see if this threat generation continues to be sufficient. My guess is that it won't be, but I do not know, so it's just a guess.
---
Second is damage mitigation. In order to not take a critical hit, you either need to have 102.4% avoidance/block or 440 defense or higher. 440 Defense is achievable by a paladin, but it requires significant gear sacrifices to do so, meaning you sacrifice either stamina (which makes healing you easier), threat (again, unsure if this will be an issue), or longevity (the third flaw that we'll get to soon). To become immune to crushing blows (150% damage attacks), you would need that 102.4% avoidance/block. This is achievable by paladins eventually (either with BWL and ZG gear, or in AQ, I'm not sure) but falls into the same problems as with 440 defense, but to a higher degree, since reaching 102.4% is much harder than reaching 440 defense. This is due to Paladin's holy shield only providing 30% block chance, versus the 75% block chance that warriors get. Druids get around this by having larger health pools and significantly higher armor, so they end up just "eating" the crits and crushes. In late AQ40 and naxx, druids start to fall off, as warriors begin to approach the armor cap as well, negating druid's primary advantage (not saying they aren't viable, just that this advantage decreases over time). So this problem can be overcome, but it requires significant effort on the paladin's part, and on a raid's part in willingness to funnel significant amounts of gear to the paladin, and it does not come without a significant cost.
---
Third is longevity. Prot paladins are limited by their mana pool, and while they have tools to help combat this (mana pots, demonic/dark runes, seal/judgment of wisdom, mp5 and int gear), many of these tools decrease their ability to either generate threat or take damage. As with the other issues, gear that becomes available as time goes on helps with this issue, but they will never have the complete freedom from their resource pool that warriors and druids enjoy.
---
Finally, there is the one issue for which there is no work around: the lack of a taunt. Fortunately, there are only a few fights in Classic that strictly require a taunt, so with sufficient threat generation, a paladin can get around this for all but a handful of fights. But outside of necessity, taunt is very handy in covering up mistakes made by the raid team, be it an unexpected tank death, a dps not watching threat enough, or a tank having an unfortunate string of parry/dodges. 
---
The core issue of a paladin tank comes down to the fact that they just need too many different stats. They need stamina to have a large enough health pool to not give healers an aneurysm every time they take a big hit. They need both caster stats (spell power/crit) and melee stats (attack power/crit) in order to maximize their threat generation. Typically focusing on one is sufficient, but their threat will never equal a warrior's due to this unfortunate double-dipping that paladin abilities do. They need both avoidance/block and stam/armor, while a warrior/druid can just focus on the latter (and don't get me started on the avoidance vs effective health debate, effective health is much better vs a single boss, period).
---
**TL;DR:** CAN a paladin tank in raids? Yes, with enough work and skill. But they are virtually never better than a warrior or druid and take significantly more work just to obtain a minimum level of functionality.
---
I like to put five points in Shield Specialisation, the extra rage is nice if you use a shield. Regardless, nah you don't need to.
---
Smaller servers wouldn't eliminate the problem, but it could reduce it. The design doesn't dictate player behavior, it just skews it to scale.
---
Now, yes lol
---
I'm glad that people finally came to their senses and aren't recommending AOE grinding for leveling like they were before classic came out. I remembered it being a massive pain in the ass to solo level with it, and it still is. AOE grinding is great if you manage to pull it off, but if you fuck it up, you will get no XP and be forced to do a corpse run. If you are solo leveling as a mage it is way more efficient to fight 2-3 mobs at once.
---
Anyway the class you are looking for is hunter. Just have to remember to buy them arrows.
---
Do note that the revered av axe is a slight upgrade/sidegrade to deep woods(more dps and has stats but no wrath proc)
---
There’s no honour, xp, coin, loot, etc etc ..... what exactly is the incentive to gank lowbies until they’re chased off ? 
---
As far as I can tell blizzard haven’t incentivised that kind of behaviour, that’s just an excuse for people to be dicks, be it alliance or horde.
---
Trying very very hard he is.
---
Its not 50/50, Im on the server. Its not as bad as the youtube videos though, I managed to tag along with a UBRS raid to BRD yesterday and it was great. As soon as you go to BRD its just horde dominated. It is not 50/50 by any means, but could be worse.
---
I'm sure now they are lmao. I quit weeks ago now along with a lot of other people.
---
Stop making excuses for Blizzard man. Nobody wants to abandon a server and risk playing on a dead server.
---
Yikes.
---
Oh most definitely. I think it would still be fun, but the top would definitely be dominated by a few combinations that simply would have no counter.
---
So thats a no from you then lol.
---
All the people in this thread saying it will be fun to level on a 7:93 ratio server, when the server was already unplayable at 35:65 ratio, hence why the alliance left in the first place lol.
---
Either people is not thinking this through or we have more masochists playing classic than I thought.
---
When you need to tell the group about the next pull while the dps is trying to murder everything, typing fast becomes mandatory
---
I’m an alliance player on a mostly balanced server, and I can guarantee you (from personal experience) that both factions do the same shit. The difference is that once one group gets too disruptive, another group forms up to stop them. This is more difficult to do on a server that’s heavily skewed in favor of one faction or the other.
---
Aye also heard about that, definitely seem like a right bunch of twats if you pardon my french.
---
Dude the stats from the get go on my server were 70-30 horde good job
---
We are going to go in circles on this one if you do not understand the word "consequences". 
---
   This arguement when it comes to difficulty has less to do with the content itself being harder or easier, and more to do with the fact that in vanilla there isnt different types of MC, or Naxx, its either you beat it or you didnt. Classic has no system in place that supports two versions of mc.
---
    Now here is the consequence part. Mc not having two versions of mc means that when you add lfr there needs to be new rewards. So again for the 3rd time the new rewards either will be some version of titanforging which means reducing stats on the same existing item in the game, or adding new lesser ones. The reason why its neccesary for new rewards is because you are killing the necessity for guilds in vanilla which is the core social hub/aspect of this version of WoW.
---
  Again its very simple to see that xrealms has a similar function but the consequences are not comparable. Its not simple to turn on lfr, you have so many other rippling effects from it.
---
Being on a server where im the last of my kind and 3000 people at all times wanna kill me actually sounds like an amazing I Am Legend scenario
---
What kind of message does it send to your guild if you allow a ninja to stay?
---
What kind of guild do you want to run?
---
What kind of behavior do you want to set as the acceptable standard in your guild?
---
What kind of players do you want to attract and retain?
---
You know the answer.  Be a leader, and make the right call.
---
I remember that patch. God, it was so much fun to be a ret paladin then. I was normally a tankadin, but I respecced ret for that small, glorious time. IIRC, it was around that time that Shield of Righteousness (the paladin shield slam) was overtuned as well. I remember being in an AV once and crit with my Shield of Righteous ness for 120k. Yes, 120,000. It was bonkers, and they had to tune that down as well. But it was a lot of fun actually being effective in pvp as a tank while it lasted lol.
---
You can't eat your cake and have it though. Either your server is populated, or it's dead. Right now both of servers are equal to vanilla in terms of concurrent online. If you can't handle wpvp, should have rolled PVE from the start, there were a lot of warnings it would happen.
---
Not true if you spec into improved life drain as well as imp life tap (at higher levels this becomes efficient)
---
I'm so tired of this kind of brainless fucking comment. I wanted to fucking play Alliance on a PvP server like the old days. Why is that my fault? Fuck you. 
---
It wasn't like how it is now because of a couple key things Blizzard did/didn't do. Primarily megaservers and not trying to manage faction balance because Horde objectively has the better racials and travel hubs. Ganking is totally fine and part of the game. Having so many fucking people in your faction that you can literally lock down *all* major FPs and cross continent travel is not ok and only made possible by the stupid high server caps that Blizzard decided to implement.
---
In Vanilla you could always find some more out of the way places to level past 45 as there were numerous options and the opposing faction couldn't hope to control all of them effectively. But now they can because of the much higher server pops.
---
We all know the fast typing comes from the shit talking in between pulls/kills.
---
I dunno. I'm horde on ZT and my experience doesn't sound like what you described.
---
As he said before he did plan on playing on a pve server but went against his own judgement and rolled with all the other streamers and he regrets it. It's not surprising he's losing interest in the game when he's clearly not enjoying it.
---
I think you should be okay. A lot of Naxx bosses require more effort out of tanks, kiting, and raid composition, but if you're a happy-go-lucky DPS then there are only one or two important things to focus on per boss. Those things can easily murder you or wipe the raid, though. That being said, it'll be a lot of fun.
---
Gotta level those bandaids.
---
This is his only content. The words Asmongold, Estefand, or Olympus are in every video of his.
---
Battlegrounds are coming out this week, and you're going to die.  A lot.  Who cares?  Play a ton of AV, work on your PvP skills, see what works, what doesn't.  
---
Grind some AV rep while you die a lot and work out your setups for PVP.   Work on those team skills, and those class vs class matchups.   Snag a Don Julio's Band.  Grab an Unstoppable Force, unless you already have a better two hander.   Rank up.   Add in some PvP armor pieces.  
---
Once your AV grind is finished and you have a couple more PvP items, start working on the WSG rep.   Keep going till you have the Silverwing bracers and leggings.  
---
Yes, it's a long journey.  Yes, it's going to be a painful start.   But you're going to be happy with where you end up.
---
People are the ones that haven't changed. 
---
no changes was always a moronic battle cry. Lessons from previous mistakes should have been rectified and some of the new mistakes that were made should have never happened. 
---
This game should have launched with faction balance in mind. From the moment name reservations opened the imbalance existed ans Blizzard ignored it. 
---
Then the game launched and queues were miserable. This was a perfect chance to implement a solution that fixed queues and re-balance the factions. Do it while everyone was low level still and would be mostly unaffected by potential re-rolls. Blizzard ignored it. 
---
Then the honor system hits and Blizzard finally tries to address the problem but it was too little too late. 
---
Now they have to consider something that didn't exist in vanilla. Faction transfers and they have to do it with the factions have glaring differences in Shamans and Paladins. Which means it will never happen. If a Shaman goes alliance presumably they become a Paladin... ok that gear swap is doable but what if a plate wearing Paladin goes Horde? It's a cluster fuck that they won bother with. 
---
The world's are damaged beyond fixing now. It could have been prevented but no effort was made. This is what we are left with.
---
28% more horde *raiding* than alliance. The census addon has level 60s at dead even, and last 7 days is even alliance favoured. 
---
This is why faction balance is meaningless. You have what is effectively a 50/50 server, almost as balanced as you could ever ask for. 
---
But one faction is a bit more hardcore, and this translates into significant levels of domination in world PvP. More players geared up, more players looking to farm honour, more players interested in PvP in general, etc. 
---
So a 50:50 server feels like it’s dominated by one faction, because it *is*. Then the other faction’s players start to leave because getting destroyed over and over isn’t fun. Then things get really, really bad as the weaker faction now *also* becomes the minority faction by a large margin. 
---
This is the path that all PvP servers with more than a few thousand players will inevitably walk.
---
Well, maybe if you'd have chosen PVE server from the start like you should, you wouldn't be so salty. wPVP seems to be too hard for the retail kid.
---
I'm looking for 2 different addons.
---
1) An addon that will show the flight time for flight paths.  Preferably with a timer that displays and counts down while you're flying.
---
2) An addon that will show every recipe for a profession and highlights which ones you have or are missing.
---
Preferably addons that are on the Twitch downloader as well.
---
I had that staff in actual vanilla, it’s such a beauty
---
Black Lotuses. Other than mats, I'd have the guild enchanter be working on Timbermaw rep to snag the +15 agi to weapon enchant from them. There are a few other things, but that's all I can think of off the top of my head.
---
I'm quite sad. I do not have much arcanite saved up for Thunderfury, and while we only have 1 binding, only a few people in the guild have expressed any interest in helping farm up those bars.
---
Weak sauce. The first part was suspicious but we are seeing only a minute of what occurred. 
---
And the part with Yoni talking about getting the solo kill down by the river isn't proof of win trading. She could have just wanted to 1v1 the person and was confident about the outcome. As she should be. How many people are really capable of soloing someone who PvPs all the damn time on an Undead mage with all the Engineering doodads?
---
Imagine imagining Lmfao like really
---
The exalted rewards are very good for warriors keep in mind. And the rep grind isn’t backbreaking. Don julios band the unstoppable force and the immovable object are all very good.
---
This is huge
---
Wpvp was never like this on retail. Again, you're clueless.
---
Imagine shilling Classic WoW and then needing boosts, handsouts and cheating to get anywhere
---
In Jamica. Getting married in 3.5 hours.
---
Shadowcraft is better until you pick up any tier gear that isn’t pants or hands. 
---
Well, it may still be better but it fucking sucks not putting on an epic
---
Biased perception, there are far fewer alliances it's just the only alliance you see are people who want to grind honor and are generally better pvpers.
---
Our healers have actually been doing that a bit, in order to help us clear faster. They are using itemrack to swap form a "mp5" set, which they use on trash, and a "healing" set, which they use on bosses. It's had a great effect so far, and I'm quite please they came up with it without any input on my end.
---
I somewhat agree, but that's for another time.
---
The **Leader of the Pack** buff is 3% to each party member. It was buffed in TBC to 5%
---
[This](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/255/630/d68.jpg)  is how I learned to type fast. Imagine everyone trying to sell stuff without the AH
---
Sounds like addons
---
The census addon is looney toons. It's a pity that people cite it.
---
lol wut?
---
The server pop cap IS a change. If there was no change this issue would be way more manageable and there wouldn't be 1/8 the complaining. It was never this bad in vanilla because it _couldn't get this bad_.
---
Good job proving them....right?
---
Some booster justice is badly needed.
---
This is exactly why it's too hard for you despite the fact it was obvious to be like this and there were warnings about that even on this sub.
---
Not true at all.. these threads always have tons of heavily upvoted horde circlejerking.
---
Travel form is not a talent
---
&lt;Left Behind&gt;
---
Flurry axe.
---
Nothing will happen to them, but im glad this is being brought forward. We are essentially paying $15 / month for the LULZ with minimal oversight by Blizzard. They just want us to get fed up with these "old systems" and play Shadowlands when it launches.
---
Ultimate karma: report his fat ass.
---
What materials needs to be collected?
---
Go back to retail
---
Same, I do most of my epic trading outside AH because cuts are brutal. He was the only person I've seen spaz out like that
---
The horde posts on this sub are better than /r/cringetopia
---
So much 2nd hand embarrassment.. always curious to imagine the world through the eyes of the socially inept.
---
I got 3 accounts running, dual boxing the lock/paladin atm and single playing mage/hunter
---
Get your pitchforks...
---
Wotlk
---
That’s such bullshit. Any PvP server with a majority will have that one side being the dicks. Nobody wants to play gnomes or dwarves, the two good racials on the alliance side. That’s why you get horde dominated PvP servers. Also the horde leveling experience is better due to them having more questing hubs. Get off your high horse with your “statistically” bullshit.
---
I got 3 accounts running, dual boxing the lock/paladin atm and single playing mage/hunter.
---
So I'll just enter with paladin and hunter.
---
Do you actually think there isn’t a relatively similar percentage of the horde population doing the same thing? Or do you believe that alliance players are just superior for some reason across hundreds of thousands of players?
---
I love how this guys content have to be about asmongold even if he is not even there.
---
And? You're acting as if i said otherwise. I had fun doing World PvP up until P2 when PHASING was a thing that should of never been removed until BGs. I quit at P2 and don't care to play anymore because it was handled badly, life moves on. I don't care enough to move to a PvE server and only PvE.
---
Two cents*
---
You are under the impression that you can always replace a ret paladin with a holy paladin. That's simply not the case at the moment. Most guilds struggle to get enough healers with BGs out there will be quite a few going full premade PvP too. I could fill another raid with all the mage and warriors begging for raid spots but we have to frequently make hard decisions on the blessing front when there are only 2-3 paladins available.
---
We're trying to get more and especially with more 20man content coming this will be tricky. You won't bring 4 holy paladins to heal ZG/AQ20 for example and even if you do how do you bring 8 holy paladins to BWL/MC/AQ40 then?
---
Hell even right now we do MC with 30+ people and then split the raid up in two raids for Ony. 
---
Ret paladins are also still capable healers. Even with zero points in holy a ret has almost the full healing capability of the holy he only lacks Illumination and that is only required for fights that take longer then 2 minutes. So your ret paladins can be a realiable switcher who does dps on trash and bosses that don't need that much healing.
---
Don't get me wrong. If you're in a guild where a missing class/skill is trained by eager guildmates within one to two weeks and you are fully dedicated to PvE raiding first and foremost I agree with you. Ret and Prot are suboptimal there and there will be only rarely a reason to bring one. 
---
But a guild that just organizes raids to save guildmates the bother of joining PUG and squezze the ID for loot? No issue there.
---
You aren’t getting clapped in wpvp because of racials, you’re getting clapped because there are far more hardcore horde players interested in the endgame. 
---
Look at the number of raiders on horde vs alliance. Look at the number of characters on the alliance vs horde at all levels. It’s clear that a large chunk of alliance players on faerlina enjoy levelling more than raiding compared to horde, and horde players are going to be way more likely to want to go out to farm honour. 
---
You aren’t losing in PvP because of racials. That’s a loser mentality.
---
Same. 
---
When I played vanilla I didn’t know you could learn cooking or first aid, or got to raid because the community was noob hostile, nowadays people are much nicer and it’s easier to learn stuff
---
not shown in message: the 3 to 1 server population
---
Classic's population numbers are vastly higher than Vanilla. This is changed in a fundamental way. At least when it was layered the #nochanges philosophy was proven to have been correct because the experience vaguely resembled Vanilla and was really, really fun, if a bit anonymous in the everchanging sea of strangers.
---
"funny"
---
you wanted to be on the faction outnumbering alliance 2 or 3 to 1? you wanted stronger pvp racials? easier world travel? safer towns?
---
Yeah and then the undead leader rips a whole in the sky releasing death to the world so ??
---
Number of logged raid kills doesn’t mean number of active players. It’s a pity that you think like that.
---
People miss how different the game felt when most were figuring things out for themselves rather than using guides and min-maxing. 
---
For example people used to be highly-represented at every level bracket because the average player was taking close to 20 days played rather than 10 or less to level up.
---
Truth.  I'm no better, been playing this game hard with the best of them.. but lately I've been cutting back.  This game is unhealthy and has some terrible systems.. and frankly the more posts I read here the more I'm reminded that MMOs are chock full of socially stunted douchebags.
---
Technically bannable but highly doubtful anything will come from this. Win trading has been around since Vanilla and I rarely heard of bans for it, just strongly worded emails telling them to stop.
---
I feel this way too. I leveled 50-60 in gorshak’s prison cell, because being worth honor points is enough motivation to be camped out of questing. I do love PvP, but not when it’s the only aspect of the game!
---
They probably would, and if the horde left because they couldnt play the game it would be the alliance's fault it happened.
---
Wait who’s vermin
---
&gt; hypocritical 
---
Don't think you know what that means. Let me guess, Alliance?
---
I cant see what's the point of transfering to 1 megaserver to another. 
---
Your first sentence is stupid. So you can play the game
---
I'm sure. That's why my level 52 Paladin on my second account hasn't noticed a difference
---
Except in this case, the fish picked the pond they were going in and knew it had pvp in it.
---
Wasn’t that the joke?  (Honestly asking...I’ve got a 28 alliance on Earthfury and so far it hasn’t been that bad, but I have no idea how bad high lvl areas are...I do hear it’s not too bad for either faction)
---
&gt; But is this because both faction's war effort needs to be completed before the gates can be opened?
---
Correct.
---
So salty, so delicious XD
---
As a pally that like to tank/dps/heal max level dungeons I feel this hard
---
Keep crying.
---
maybe you can sell BOEs for the bars if people don't want to farm
---
Dude. You can use the goblin mortar grenades while still in animal forms.
---
Ideally you would get 2 weapons with the exact same speed. Flurry (which normally has 3 charges) will affect 4 swings if your weapons always swing at the exact same time.
---
This is not possible or practical most of the time though. It's not worth using a worse weapon just for this reason. Do it when you can, but if not, use the best weapon available to you.
---
Cross realm bgs have been confirmed.
---
What is win trading?
---
Sounds like PvP happened on a PvP server.
---
Because Horde "pvpers" are so shit at the game they literally can't win without Horde racials?
---
I actually went there just to dance with the few alliance left. Kinda fun.
---
There is a vanilla movie of 2 pallys doing the same. They pull boss out of house and kill him on the stairs of front door. Dunno if that still works, or what the benefitt is with adds, if any. GL on future tries! Well done💪🏻
---
Git good, svn bad
---
The census addon recently said that Whitemane was 70A/30H at level 55+. I[ronforge.pro](https://ironforge.pro) is not perfect but its numbers are within proximity of accurate since it's based on active players and not whether or not someone has recently gathered a pinch of data on a given faction.
---
This is how I always felt. I was kind of floored to come back from the beginning of Cata to MoP only to find that quite a few of the dungeons may as well have not existed out in the world lol 
---
The theme park dungeon shit was also when wotlk hit a low point for me. Some of the chain questlines that led you into dungeons and followed you out of them to other side were my favorites in the game. 
---
Post-LFG it just wasn't the same once it really hit full swing.
---
Source? Lol
---
It was more balanced before the alliance migrations from skeram and stalagg
---
No gear required for hunter better gear just gives you faster kills
---
$15
---
It's when two teams collaborate to trade wins for honor farming, or in the case of Arena and/or Rated Battlegrounds on retail, for higher rating.
---
Because layers removal resulted in concurrent online server cap decrease, duh. As I said, you have no clue how layering works but whatever.
---
&gt;I'm quite sad. I do not have much arcanite saved up for Thunderfury, and while we only have 1 binding, only a few people in the guild have expressed any interest in helping farm up those bars.
---
I also bet that the interest will rise as people see other guilds with TF and clearing more easily
---
Yes, get mad at someone cause they are not playing how you want them to play.
---
that doesn't make any sense at all.
---
xrealm raiding does not mean you need multiple versions of raids and multiple versions of rewards.  it's literally just expanding the player pool you can play with.
---
people will still raid with guilds because it's much more efficient and safe than raiding with randoms.
---
if xrealm raids kills pve guilds, than xrealm battlegrounds kills pvp guilds.  they're 2 sides of the same coin.
---
Exactly what I was thinking, lol
---
hopefully blizzard takes away all  of the honour earned, and maybe a ban too
---
Idk how foolish you must be to claim ive never leveled a warrior after I described the positives and negatives of warrior. You must have fell for the reddit meme of "hurr warrior is so bad guyz lol!" No. Warrior is amazing. Your downtime is very minimal since you only need to worry about your hp, so you can just bandage up. If youre bandaging up or eating after every mob you are fucking up something fierce.
---
you have previous about complaining about layering, and now you want it back?
---
this sub will really fucking complain about anything lmao even after given every opportunity to solve the problem.
---
another serial complainer who should just be ignored
---
Sounds like you chose the wrong faction xD
---

&gt;here's my take on the event, So there are other people who are probably, I'm not saying they are doing it, but they are probably doing the same thing we do so it doesnt matter. I have evidence that other people are doing it, how can you not realize this. You are fucking stupid for making these accusation against us, you dont even have proof that its us. Everyone is doing it, I don't see you harassing other player who are clearly doing it. You're just obsessed with us!
---
Generally in premade vs premade 1 will always afk out anyway. 
---
It is a waste of time to spend an hour going back and forth with another premade when you can win against pugs in 5 mins.
---
It's been a very long time, but I don't think it's going to be possible to level in AV.  It could be possible to grind mobs in the yeti cave - if you're getting decent XP from the kills - which I don't think you will.

---
Unskilled gay vegans, I laughed more than I care to admit.
---
...are you people on the spectrum or something? I swear the autists are on a roll in this thread today.
---
What you said doesn't even make sense. Why would I go back to retail if I'm enjoying pvp in classic? I'm not the one complaining here. I've never once complained about pvp in classic.
---
Are you just saying things that you read on the internet somewhere? Brick, do you really love lamp, or are you just saying it?
---
That's a fair point. I was disregarding the impact of the staged releases.
---
I think there's a very strong argument that delaying the release of WSG is not a "major change" and that the delay is consistent with a "no changes" philosophy, but I don't support "no changes," so I don't really want to dig myself into that discussion.
---
It was more of a severe issue on asian servers. The idea of a "pretty" race on horde side made a much bigger impact for faction ratios than it did in the west

I remember having cancer but that doesn’t make it a good story
---
Came here to say this, I just put +9 int on my Lok'Delar because its the only thing logical right now for a hunters 2hander.
---
I am ready for classic unprepared.
---
My point was that while it may be imbalanced on certain servers, I guarantee you alliance is doing the same shit on other servers/in other areas. So some horde could be getting facerolled daily while leveling and then he sees these memes that try to make it seem as if his experience isn’t legitimate, he’s going to complain that the alliance is the issue because they are for him. Everyone’s experience is valid. 
---
This horde bad alliance good meme is just getting old.
---
Hopefully blizz allows server transfers though to help alleviate the really imbalanced servers though.

If you make more herbing in WPL, go do that. Contrary to what content creators on YouTube will tell you, the gph is not that high no matter what you do in BRD.
---
Recent data looks even more embarrassing for the Alliance players https://wowpop.appspot.com/
---
If you fall for that one you don't really deserve to have nice things.
---
I played Vanilla on one of the original 6 pvp servers, and it was Horde dominated.  And I play classic on Smolderweb, which is also horde dominated but also fairly even compared to most classic pvp servers.
---
The changes blizzard already made in population density along with the generally greater min/maxing going on lead *directly* to the experience being not even comparable. 
---
Blaiming the no changes people for a problem that was directly caused by massive changes is just bizzare.  It literally directly validates them.
---
0/31/20 (Fury/Prot) is the best spec for threat if you can afford to dual wield.   
---
10/5/36 (Full Prot) is the best spec for threat if you would otherwise die.  
---
17/3/31 (Impale Prot) is the best spec if you have a high amount of crit and need to wear a shield (i.e. world buffs + plate crit gear + shield).  
---
17/34/0 (Full Fury) is the best spec if you are an off-tank and have a few seconds to establish an aggro lead.
---
You shut the fuck up.  Literally every alliance in the game has quit.  
---
EVERY.  SINGLE.  ONE.  
---
There are swarms of horde rogues oneshotting all the poor level 1s as they spawn into the game.  The servers are all so heavily horde dominated that even the elementals in MC have stopped spawning.  The whole of Azeroth is just one barren wasteland with marauding gangs of horde psychos fighting over the last of the fuel and water.  Literally every sound effect in the game has been replaced with the undead cackle and all the textures have been replaced with low-poly thrall face.  Even the chat doesn't work any more.  All text in the game has been replaced with  g o T o RE T a IL.  
---
The alliance cant even respawn any more.  All the spirit healers have been killed too and are being corpse camped by dancing Taurens.
---
it also massively depends on fight duration, amount of dispells vs heals and previous amount of crit. 
---
It's very hard to make a clearcut formula or designate a absolute BIS.
---
ATM you can basically say that +heal &gt;all given enough consumables and raidbuffs. 
---
Now why don't I run around in mostly green "of healing"? Because I don't want to pay 200g in consumables for every MC run to do 30% more healing then a paladin in full T1.
---
Collusion is not the correct word mate..
---
?
---
 Im a fucking mage
---
Youre not talking about xrealm raiding. You legit have used the term lfr from the title of the post and in every comment. 
---
Your points are all bad dude, like you cant stick with something you are moving from a half thought out point to the next. There isnt any solid reasoning besides convience to add lfr. Other than that you ruin so many other facets. Xrealm BGS are so entirely different.
---
Sure but the major thing is that since questing has you running from quest giver, to x location (where its not always about killing y mobs) and back to the quest giver, what becomes equally important as how quick you can kill is mobility. So this gives an edge to mage, druid, hunter, and shaman because they have extra mobility.
---
Well, if they get it done in 10 years they might rename it to Camelot Undressed and it will be some kind of weird MMO/VR-Porn game.
---
I mean, if you are camped 2:1 (flamelash was 33/66 which is 2:1) moving to a 60/40 server in horde favor (which xfers off flamelash was) might make it 50/50. 60/40 and, ideally, 50/50, are a marked improvement from 33/66 or greater. 
---
It doesn't make you a coward to want even ground on a video game. Thinking so makes you a moron however.
---
I don't know who that is, but I also don't follow much of the 'popular kids.'
---
Depends. If you're an ally warlock or priest, ~70% of the players you face have an ez button that largely nullifies your CC.
---
There were definitely a non negligible percentage of people upset about it.
---
i understand the consequences to xrealm, diluted community.  that's it.  the pros are faster queue times.
---
same pros and cons for pvp as they are for pve.
---
you're inventing cons by saying they need to add difficulties and rewards when they don't.  that's not a con.
---
What most people don't mention to is wpvp is only fun if you are a rogue or mage. I'm a holy priest. I can't kill anyone in the game so whenever I'm in the world it's just GG.
---
Leaving my 60 horde behind to start fresh on the alliance side of Flamelash. As one brothers!

Coming from an alliance player . Got it
---
Thanks for this! I’ll probably do SM Cathedral then because 20-30g an hour is fine with me really.
---
“Doppels” lol
---
16 is a few yes, when you're talking about 40 people. You might find a guild willing to take you along to MC/Ony as an arms warrior but I wouldn't count on it. And come phase 3 the likelyhood of you being able to stay arms and have a raid spot is almost 0. Yes MS is a low priority debuff. But if you're knocking off corruption/deep wounds/garrote/rupture for a debuff that literally does nothing you're still lowering your overall raid dps.
---
Thanks! :) I’ll try it out and see how it goes
---
NO CHANGES KEk
---
Yep, dwarf Paladin.
---
Even to, it took about 28 raid lockouts before TBC was released btw...
---
Yeah I only got a Night Watch sword after 10 runs and sold it for 15g.
---
Now they know that you know they know. Game on.
---
&gt;Right games change and people change with them.
---
And while you can re-release the game as it was 15 years ago, *you* just can't return to that version of yourself from 15 years ago. This was always going to be a big issue for Classic.
---
And one thing Classic changed, and which subsequently changed the way we approach the game compared to 15 years ago, was that we *knew what content was coming to the game*. This change alone, which is something Blizzard was never able to control, already changed the game beyond imagination.
---
"#nochanges" was always a contradiction in itself, considering that knowing which content would release as well as the complete analysis and knowledge we had from doing this content before already changed the essence of the game.
---
so I don't think your warrior needs to gear for 6% hit, namely he isn't fighting ?? mobs in a 5 man.
---
https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Attack-table
---
Have your melee use free action potions for that trash.
---
It's easy. Everything is Hunter equipment. So just give it all to them.
---
Too serious. Play the game.
---
Explain?
---
&gt;Nochanges
---
You mean vastly increasing the population cap which leaves minority factions with nowhere to go and nowhere to hide?  That kind of "no charge"?
---
Literally asked for it though so Asmon just quelled the drama. I don’t even like him that much to take his side automatically, this is just stupid.
---
Streamers are pos
---
Can you explain what we are looking at for those waiting on the coffee to kick in?
---
It's just a poorly designed mechanic. In modern gaming, you need to plan for min maxing. Games like lol require you to play your best to reach the top, because you will face better and better opponents, and get rewards proportionally.
---
The honor system rewards simple win efficiency, with zero regards to whom you just beat. That's not competitive
---
From my experience, people seemed to be *far* more annoyed by long queues than layering. A not insignificant number of people even appreciated the temporary solution layering provided.
---
We might have to agree to disagree because I don't think we'll be able to get any meaningful numbers on that.
---
Why would Asmon get banned?
---
Humans have increased spirit and increased rep gains bruh.  That means you're smiling while your litany of diplomatic homies watch you get your face smashed in.
---
Not as bad as ele shaman and shadow priest raid gear. Also fury warriors should have prio on things a couple weps, so perd blade, core hound, brutalityB, viskag, Deathbringer, blastershot. Also quick strike ring, strikers mark, onslaught girdle, flameguard gauntlets, wristguards, etc. Yea it sucks not getting tier and competing with rogues for a lot of these, but the more you raid with a steady guild, the easier it will be to obtain since others have it already. If youre in a PUG... goodluck
---
What were you thinking not prioritizing your guilds good and unsullied name?
---
Hur dur
---
Of course, and Asmond/Esfand will of course keep crying about Advertise "stream sniping" like the children they are.
---
This what you get when you base your entire life and career around a video game. You turn into a roach like Asmondgold.
---
I second this.  Make a dynamic icon group and add the stuff you WANT to see by name.
---
I don't actually think using the translator is against ToS either, considering I see lots of horde and alliance using it to talk shit.   
---
I've even seen them use it to convince either side to back down from a fight. I mean, in those cases I would say it's completely innocent.
---
If he's found to be win trading then he would be banned. That's all. I don't care either way, just throwing out some logic.

2: Dont really have one here, but AtlasLoot does have a crafting section, although I have found it to be a little incomplete
---
This is the mentality ruining video games in general.
---
I'm whatever. But the boats man. Fucking boats.
---
I think Rogue is rather lackluster, and should be better/funnier at lvl 29.
---
You won’t get poison until level 20, you’ll lack evasion, vanish,  Ambush (only relegated to backstab) and sprint.
---
Same with drood i think, you’ll lack the feline swiftness, dash etc.
---
Priest or hunter will atleast be strong, even though they will also lack abilities.
---
But they’ll be so strong in other senses instead (Pw:shield is strong, as is the wand).
---
Pets are super strong, as are you, and you get multishot at 18 etc.
---
The guy crying about the hostile streamsnipers, and yet he is getting carried and supported by the friendly stream snipers 24/7.  He is also extremly toxic in-game, and a huge ninja looter. So no empathy for him getting camped in game.
---
He is an entertaining streamer tho
---
After this Spy addon update I cannot see the window that showed the enemy players closeby anymore ? Did they remove it or I'm missing some setting ?
---
All this drama is cracking me up.  Asmon and Esfand have their heads so far up their asses.
---
It was full. It was a green smiley face. I made sure of that after the 1st disappeared
---
My guild is currently full :( but wanted to warn you about &lt;ssd pug&gt; and &lt;UNBRIDLED ANIMUS&gt;. Both are incredibly bad, with a weird number of blatantly racist players, and both are known for ninja-ing loot (e.g., Ironfoe, skullflame, and Quel). Good luck!
---
One sided pvp yes.  Population levels high enough to control all of Azeroth 24/7 no.
---
How is it on the rp server? Do a lot of people rp?
---
It's definitely a personal preference choice, but I never found myself using the thing.  World Enlarger isn't a trinket and just sits in your bags so at least got used on cooldown.  The mortar never got any use because I always have a reflector on, PvP trinket, Tidal charm, Glimmering Mithril Insignia, AGM etc.
---
Some people use mortars all the time which is good, but I just never did.
---
I mean it's not just modern gamers we did the exact same thing in vanilla 15 years ago.
---
1 person would accept the queue to see if it was a premade.  If it was no one else would accept and we would requeue without that person (since they would have deserter) for another game which would hopefully be against a pug.
---
This way only 1 person gets a deserter debuff not the entire group.  The vast majority of honor farming groups did this trough all of vanilla.
---
Blame Blizzard for designing a system that only rewards honor farming not skill.
---
Reckful is/was an oldschool multi glad rogue, someone who achieved e-fame via skill rather than by having a messy room.
---
A guild built up around a guy whose ENTIRE life is WoW is also a shit stain on the community?
---
Noooooooooooooo. Say it ain't so!
---
He went to Anathema.
---
Why stick around in a guild where the officers are cheating at the expense of their loyal members who actually pvp and rank?
---
That won't work.
---
Regardless, you can't design a game about what exploits people *might* do.

Maybe throw a bit a music on the video. With all due respect, content honestly wasn't very exciting.. and the sounds of the keyboard clicks wasn't either. Looks like you gave the first rogue a good run though, awesome deathcoil. Keep at it!

Just deleting it in general makes me kinda mad.

It's a joke, not a dick, don't take it so hard. You said "turn off warmode", something found in retail, not classic.

So what

The guild name is resist - which happens when you try to sheep a druid who is in animal form.
---
A spell ret takes 5pc t2, uses nf with 40% uptime and can be your 5th blessing, allowing your raid to have everything including BoSanc
---
Anyone who puts NF on anything but a ret paladin is doing a huge disservice to their overall raid dps. A spelladin that tries can do 600+ dps right now. That's currently around 95th percentile warriors on certain fights.
---
Putting NF on another spec limits their own dps, which you'll have to calculate if the potential loss of hunter dps is less than the dps nf brings. A ret doesnt have to worry about that calculation.
---
People don't realize that he community is the exact same. They can't see that the only difference is that they are the whiners this time around
---
You think asmon has enough followers who would cancel enough accounts to upset shareholders? Cmon man..
---
Oh wow streamers are cancer? Who would have thought...
---
Imo, ssd is actually the worse of the two. They take close to 3-4 hours to clear MC and the chat is just people saying the N words and bashing Jews. Especially, Poofacemcgee and Regilol (the two guild leaders). For example Regilol got a temporary ban because his name used to be Regginlol (read it backwards)
---
Flurry OH sims higher than duel DB
---
We have Music in The background on our Discord coms, might be greedy US company who blocks it 🤔
---
Asmon hasn’t streamed in over 4 days. 
---
Apparently he’s in some type of damage control after the backlash he received from using his position to de-platform a smaller streamer. 
---
It’s natural he’s going to be defensive.
---
In other news, water is wet.
---
That would be a bad plan from Blizzard. Like the only way I remain subscribed to the game is if classic remains good, because I don't think retail has any replayability what so ever.
---
But If I can play classic 90%, I might even give shadowlands a shot and play it for the first few weeks of launch, or whenever a patch hit to see the story/raid.
---
I think fucking up classic goes against blizzard own best interest tbh, since classic appeals to an almost entirely different market, as classic and retail wow are such different games at this point.
---
you'll see what the top guilds do soon, it won't involve nightfall.
---
Depends on your class but your class specific discord might have a lot more of that kind of discussion
---
It's cheating. That was a big deal in vanilla.
---
&gt;Ironforge.pro is not perfect but it is reasonable to expect that its numbers are within proximity of accurate
---
Why is that reasonable to expect? 
---
On retail with a very even faction balance overall, we see massive disparities.
---
For example, Horde players make up ~53% of level 120s, but ~68% of players with a logged mythic kill in the current tier, and the difference in things like Heroic achievements are still largely in favor of Horde.
---
The disparity is literally more than 5 times what you'd expect to see based on numbers of capped characters. 
---
&gt;since it's based on active players and not whether or not someone has recently gathered a pinch of data on a given faction.
---
It's not though, it's based on raiders which make up a small fraction of the playerbase. Most level 60s have not been in the Molten Core. 
---
Like let's say that you have 500 horde and 500 alliance. If 10% of each faction raids, that's 50:50. 
---
But let's say that while 10% of Alliance players raid, 11% of Horde players raid. Pretty reasonable, right? That's 55:50, or a 52:48 split. 
---
Let's say that 12% of Horde players raid. That's 60:50, or 54.5:45.5. 
---
The disparity that you see right now could simply be explained by 10% of Alliance players raiding and 13% of Horde players raiding. Does that really seem that crazy to you?
---
I cleared the Black Temple in Vanilla and had Twin Glaives too.
---
Nvm that's main guild and main players fuck them and those scum ban them but wait for evidence against anyone else.
---
Thank you both for the heads up! Will be sure to stay away from them!
---
You.. do know that BFA was the largest purchase of an expansion ever right? It's the bulk cost and the fact it still has more players than classic.
---
we can theorycraft until the item is out, but nightfall won't be a big part of any of the top raids.
---
In the context of wow: people aren't corpse camping because people labeled them as sociopaths, they are doing so because of the reinforcers involved for doing so. This same issue applies to role engulfment as a whole, where it provides an overly convuluted and mentalistic explanation for something we can explain just by looking at the environment.
---
Zimbardos experiment in particular is garbage simply because of how poorly he controlled for extraneous factors. The guards basically knew what the experiment was about and Zimbardo heavily interacted with them, just as an example, which makes the way they acted of little value.
---
This.  I wish it would just focus on the zone you're in.
---
echoing other sentiments here. if your wife is not looking to PVP, playing on a pvp server will make her quit the game as will be forced to engage in pvp combat every time she is out in the world from lvl 20 on.
---
Underrated comment. They could care less about asmongold as a corporation. Large shareholders don’t even know his name, nor care.
---
it's just hilarious that they actually have more horde characters contributing than alliance
---
Red and blue all the way.
---
RIP. 
---
Side note, how do you activate your “9,” “0,” and “-“ abilities? The ones real far away from WASD.
---
Lmao. A ret with JUST SoR has a 40% uptime and you can reach 47ish with some insane deal twisting. JoC also procs it so you're looking at SoR and JoC. A warrior spamming hamstring is going to be rage starved.
---
Your warrior also brings nothing but hamstring and if it is your OT will be extremely rage starved when swapping and establishing his agro.
---
Ret pally has the most uptime on NF atm without sacrificing personal dps.
---
Anyone who joined the guild under the pretense that they weren't the base level of a massive pyramid deserves what they get.
---
Run dungeons til you're 60.  Questing doesn't make sense with world pvp.

"Will be  an important incident in the history in WoW"

---
Yeah no, in the grand scheme all things WoW, Flamelash means nothing and in a few months, no one will remember or care. All because a select community on Reddit couldn't stop complaining or memeing about it doesn't mean it was the latest breaking news everywhere else.

Then threatening to give up because someone killed you 40v40

Hey on the plus side, after the horde are done monkeystomping each and every one of you every fucking day they'll stop attacking you because you stop giving honor!

---
But I can point out that this issue is entirely the making of Blizzard and the "#NOCHANGES!" crowd.
---
The former should have anticipated the issue of cramming 14,000 people into a world designed and planned for 3,000 at best. The later one was constantly shouting the #nochanges nonsense, but this release had two major changes already. We *knew when and what content releases* and that we had thousands of websites *with precise information about the game*.
---
Both already changed how the game would develop, feel, be played and pan out, but none of them seemed to admit that.
---
&gt; still has more players than classic.
---
Well now you're just making things up.
---
Have you seen a gnome? Disgusting little devils.
---
Let me guess, you were distracting people off the ledge?
---
I'm not saying the concept of DHKs are stupid but DHKs as they currently are implemented are stupid.  I don't know how you could advocate for them.
---
You could come up with plenty of ways like you suggested that would make them better, and actually promote better wpvp, which the current DHKs do not do whatsoever
---
It says "Immune."
---
Who designed and deployed the system that is causing and *rewarding* this behaviour...?
---
Blizzard choose to go ahead with six times the intended population size for the world *and* to keep this system in place for authenticity.
---
I love how these streamers hyped up classic then when it's released it's a shitshow and none of them did anything aside from taking handouts and complaining 
---
the whole classic duel with tips, horde only no prize announced and rules changing every minute. not sure how msi is even comfortable putting their logo on there anymore. 
---
asmon fucked up from the beginning, its like he didnt even wanna stream or play the game. if you havent noticed he does it exactly 8 hours starting early and tries to keep it 5 days a week. It's a job that he hates now. half the time hes in retail or watching youtube and talking about dark souls 2. all that hype for nothing.
---
shockedpikachuface
---
&lt;--- Number of people surprised by this.
---
Asmon is a piece of shit? Who knew.
---
Sir, we "REEE" with the fury of a thousand mating taurens
---
What if someone (like me) doesn't want to pay/grind for both?
---
Stop posting about this garbage, youre literally making it worse by supporting this bs
---
Lots of people zoned into Naxx, and now claim they raided it.  Based on the way Naxx is set up, you can get a couple bosses deep in each wing before you really get to the hard stuff.  People who did this can say "I raided Naxx in vanilla" and be telling the honest truth.  
---
I can tell you that when TBC rolled out, there was only 1 horde guild that had killed any boss in Naxx on Dragonmaw, and that was &lt;Hellmonkey&gt;.  "raiding naxx" and clearing naxx are two very different things.
---
you got kicked for the ultimatum, not ousting the cheater
---
"i played classic alot its not that good"
---
As much crit and agi as possible while staying hit cap at 9%. Agi &gt; attack power unless it’s a considerable amount of AP. 1 agi = 2AP and some %crit. Something around those lines. A quick google might find some info.
---
&gt;  Thats all classic wow is: just gaming with your friends.
---
If you have enough friends/friends of friends, the only thing more people bring is the chances at more stuff on the AH/maybe some pugs for dungeons if someones not feeling up to it/can't play.
---
..Basically, kind of like retail.
---
do you guys even know that wow was considered "casual" when it came out? Because in mmos before wow you would lose your gear when you died.
---
So stop crying
---
They DO go to Japan in the third movie...hmmm you may be on to something
---
I'd kicked you to.
---
You talk to much.
---
Aayyee Westfall represent! I agree. My friends rolled this server, and so I begrudgingly accepted even thought I wanted to roll pvp. Damn I am sooo glad they chose it. I've had a blast on classic so far, found a cool group of people in my new guild after all my friends inevitably stopped playing in their 40's. The people on this server are great. There's a good population, the pvp is plentiful, and I can level at whatever pace I want and still find people to run instances with because no one has to corpse hop to dungeons. Definitely a 200 IQ move by my buddies.
---
A roach. Hahaha. &lt;3
---
Why would i blame blizzard for it?  They fixed this issue decades ago.  But #nOcHaNGeS crowd forced their hand.
---
"a shitty human did shitty human things for attention and it worked because of this idiot posting"
---
I tried it and honestly my guild did not need it.  We just were not putting out enough dps to justify using it but my gm wants me to.  I spec out of fury prot after raid day and into deep
---
Prot for the rest of the week. It’s a better spec for 5mans and even pvp imo.
---
I got bored multiboxing my mages and priest so I actually joined up on this server too a while back. Have had a blast.
---
I used this.
---
\#showtooltip
---
/cast [target=mouseover][] Taunt
---
This version of the macro will taunt your current target if you have no mouseover target. I believe the other one posted in this thread works only on mouseovers, so if this is more your style then go ahead.
---
your right hand??   ???????????????? 
---
if you have one
---
not for horde, and for alliance it will be a snowball and the servers will die. the alliance needs a min. number of people participating each week.
---
Why ban Asmongold, was it it him u saw in the video? Or similar video of him doing wintrading aswell?
---
Well thats because, from what I remember, all servers at the start had long queues. Plenty of people had issues with layering though because of what it did to the economy and how you could use it to escape from pvp situations. But layering, much like megaservers, shouldnt have been a thing to begin with. The only reason they exist is because Blizzard refused to admit they were wrong.
---
welcome to the internet and life on earth, during war the enemy is dehumanized so soldiers dont hesitate when to kill them
---
But here's the thing, there are still plenty of Horde here.
---
Fucking ouch dude.
---
have you ever thought of PvPing just to pvp? jesus christ you people are insane how is a premade vs another premade not competitive?
---
That'll depend on the individual OT, too. If they have crap for dps gear or are prot spec, then the raid isn't losing much damage.
---
He’s not. I’m glad everyone keeps jerking off over a spreadsheet that’s wrong. 
---
There’s a reason none of the rogues topping meters on warcraft logs were using 6 piece shadowcraft and all used the prepaid bis lists until acquiring mc gear. 
---
Pickup some pieces of shadowcraft for PvP if you don’t have the nightslayer/blood fang yet but do not use 6 piece shadowcraft in pve because some YouTube video or spreadsheet with no evidence behind it tells you it’s the best.
---
There's nothing wrong with the mechanics. It's meant to match teams together to play a game. 
---
We're shifting blame away from individuals with zero self restraint from abusing the mechanic to blizzard who's trying to provide an enjoyable pvp experience. 
---
Sure, blizzard can (did) iterate on the match making to fix this. Eventually, those same people will find a way to abuse the new system/other systems.
---
What if efforts put towards blaming blizzard for implementing an easily abused mechanic, we put those efforts towards reporting/flaming the players taking advantage of the mechanic?
---
Only fix might be to remove those players from this aspect of the game?
---
I'm actually a carebear and barely fight people in the world, so a PVE server is probably more my style. I just find PVP servers to be more immersive, so I always go with them. Thanks for the suggest though!
---
try /spy show, you probably had a setting that hid it.
---
Except if you actually look at the flaws, you would see you couldn't make any meaningful conclusions from his data. 
---
Yea, there are issues with a number of studies in psychology, and you see heavy disagreement because psychologists follow different paradigms, but the problems with Zimbardo's research are universally agreed upon across paradigms.
---
r/woosh
---
There's both.  Discord more active than the reddit I think.
---
I love this so much. Good luck in hardcore survival mode!
---
&gt; The game gives no honor for killing greys. I've been camped by 10+ 60's numerous times while leveling and it gives nothing to them.
---
They're most likely ganking you the same reason anyone'd gank a grey, You might call for help and it'll be them that'll give them their honor.
---
Except this is a PVE server, so it's not like they're getting corpse camped or have to corpse hop places. They can level in peace and engage in pvp to their hearts content.
---
It’s not worth bringing a rent pally.
---
It isn't getting worse. It's the same exact text for several years now.
---
He did what now? Got any clips/links? Im out of the loop on this topic.
---
Why wouldn't you, they're rad.
---
EsfatTV; If i say "right" after every sentence maybe people will actually think im right
---
I don't need a spreadsheet.  It's really easy.  8/8 beaststalker is BiS because it looks the coolest.  Rhok'delar and Lok'delar because they're a status symbol.  There you go - a BiS list that is pretty much as valid as all of the others, because gear is extremely situational.
---
fyi, it's 44 guilds before the bc patch, not 44 guilds in all of vanilla. Swapping people in nad out every week and different comps, expect about 2500 people to have done naxx pre bc patch. After bc patch but before bc it became cleared by a LOT more guilds so there's that too. There's a LOT more people that did Naxx than you think. Hell this list is WOEFULLY incomplete, as I can tell you surreal also completed it on alleria and is not on the list. It still has way more than you suspected did it. After the bc patch they mostly didn't seem to record much of anything which is when the majority of kt kills actually happened. This was self submitted data only, and most guilds didn't use it, so this list while being WOEFULLY incomplete supports blizz's numbers far better and also blows out of the water the 'tiny numbers' people throw around.

Calling someone out in a battleground and they say "stop talking and just play". Bro I got mad typing skills here
---
Can't poise yourself against someone in a position of power and expect immediate action because of what's right or wrong. There's channels to follow, just like in the real world. You think disgruntled employees are willing to up and quit/leave because someone else on the team is doing x/y/z? Sometimes, but hopefully they have a backup plan for their initial inquiry or they might be out of a job AND have no positive recourse for their actions while x/y/z keeps on keeping on.
---
Yeah but listen. Ok. So like, here's the thing, alright?

Because MRP cost me like 20s and it’s more fun.

How are your dps getting to the boss before the tank?
---
The 'best' PvP gear is generally a mix of raiding gear and PvP gear, and you'll need R14 which is more of a time investment than any raid.
---
I was really baked the other night and used my second account to invite my alt. Smh
---
Thank you, do you also have any dual wield tank gear recommendations or should I just use bis pre raid tank gear?
---
This is wrong, it should be a gnome instead.
---
BGs mostly went down with randos anyways.
---
Also LFR was a major stepping stone in in the way leading up to retail.

Its not like he can summon an army of like 500 people almost instantly to protect him , right?

Generally you want it on all your warrior tanks and possible a ret paladin(for fights where all your tanks are busy with a mob).

Basically, asmoon kicked a dude because he said cheating is wrong and he didnt want to be part of a guild full of honor cheating scumbags.
---
Warriors might be fast, but do they have the stamina of paladins?
---
RIP
---
pour out some liquor for your dead naga 🍻
---
Yeah as if Mcconnell would object to anything Asmon or Esfand do.
---
I'll refer you to Pilav's video on the subject. All Classic streamers are cancer. And especially the *nicest* of them.
---
Didn't Asmon say that he was quitting Classic and going back to Retail? Or am I mistaken?
---
I honestly thought Esfand was probably one of the coolest streamers before classic released, but he's really come off as the biggest tool out of everyone in the crew after all the drama he's flung himself into.
---
Ret paladin has lower uptime than spelladin or an offtank spamming hamstring. If you don't have an offtank with it who isn't tanking or a spelladin, the ret pally should have theirs on. The answer is to craft multiple really. FYI, the ret pally loses even more dps using righteousness instead of command too, why a spelladin would be a better choice as they use righteousness by default :)
---
On my server, if I get involved, I die, a lot.  Something about a healing priest that makes it okay to corpse camp me until my flag turns off.  No threat to you, why don't we just fuck him over?
---
SOME? Hahahhahahahahhahahahahahaha
---
Why post a thread about it?
---
Is there anyting like that going on Firemaw? I have fled from Flamelash to Firemaw recently.
---
hahaha so how come these grown people with their 2 hours a night of game time and infinite wisdom.... rolled on a pvp server.... how come the horde (paying subscriber) isnt allowed to partake in the experience that he signed up for and accepting the conditions of the pvp server? man grown people sound like real fucken idiots these days.
---
So release him into a GRAVEYARD!? He'll starve! At least the bank takes care of them like the stable master!
---
Wait you mean you can’t just use other people’s work for free?
---
thank you, yeah i thought about pulling him out aswell but thats kinda exploitish in my opinnion
---
You clearly have never played on any kind of competitive vanilla server.
---
Reputations for new enchants.  Not just timbermaw, iirc.
---
It’s a non-insignificant factor though. This widens the gap that is already present.
---
I’m on a server 60% horde but alliance have ruled every single place on the map since phase 2 I can’t walk anywhere most of my guilds quit and I’m done with the game
---
As a horde player is there anyway I can help the brotherhood?
---
i think he was wearing the 6% hit for the bosses that are lvl 61+
---
he would often change parts of his gear during the run
---
Get Them Ban From Twitch, And Blizzard. ASAP.
---
And Now plz stop be a CryBABY , And assume it.

Nothing is stopping this from happening on a pve server.

looks like the problem solved itself tbh
---
nah, blaming the devs for being pro-horde dumbfucks to the point they blatantly ignored a huge and growing problem that was inevitably going to screw over the PVP servers when horde were 60/40 to 70/30, or worse, favored on the faction balance due to OP racials and shit
---
It does self-correct a little though, if you grt a shitty repuation, it gets expoentially harder to rank as you get higher.
---
cheat
---
/CHēt/
---
verb
---
gerund or present participle: cheating
---
*act dishonestly or unfairly in order to gain an advantage, especially in a game or examination.*
---
Cheating does not just mean "hack the game" as most use it. Cheating includes collusion with the opponent to guarantee your victory, which is what they're doing in this case.
---
Nah, just like kiting Drakkisath🤓
---
Yes, widening an **an already existing gap**, means, by definition, is not what **puts it ahead**.
---
This is actually the horde's fault.

I’m having fun. Tens of thousands of people playing at all hours of every day.
---
This sub is just a dramafest.
---
there are more people browsing /r/wow than /r/classicwow. 
---
that's sad
---
&gt;  The average WoW player now is way better than 15 years ago thanks to widespread access of information and tactics, and this creates this Min/Max culture that's currently plaguing classic.
---
Also not just that, but retail wow's content across the years after og-vanilla, have been harder with more interesting mechanics, making even a retailer pretty good once they figure out that for the majority of classic.. the hardest mechanic is not pulling too much mobs as an undergeared anything.

If they do faction swaps, they'll probably have a preset of gear that shaman/pally get if/when they swap. Weapons might be able to be straight swapped though.
---
Oh you’re another one of those people trying to make the game look like its dead right
---
ya pretty much same
---
Lmfao I’m not debating the fucking word I’m just asking what they’re doing
---
How has no one said mage? It was literally the world first level 60.
---
When you skip the gear grind, the gold grind and even the level grind, what else is there to do in Classic?
---
Streamers can't enjoy Classic because they get everything for free. They get priority on loot and get boosted with instant dungeons. They're basically playing Retail.
---
Nixxiom spoke about his experience and how he didn't enjoy Classic as a streamer. He disliked it so much that he started a new character off stream and that's when he started to enjoy Classic.
---
One of my friends picked that realm at launch and we all hopped on it with 2 other friends. I stopped playing at lvl 32 which took me almost a month, the other friend of mine leveled up to 60 recently (he can play on weekends due to his job). Now he is forced to make a new toon on another realm, what server do you guys recommend him to play alliance on ? (we were formerly horde players on flamelash, I might be playing again on another realm as soon as my money and time will let me do so)
---
Noooo I'm really curious!! Blocked in my country
---
It’s a level 60 hunter farming...must be a bot.

Cheating.
---
I'm not advocating for [ironforge.pro](https://ironforge.pro), for some of the reasons that you cite. It's not accurate but it has numbers based on *something*. Main point is that [https://wowclassicpopulation.com/](https://wowclassicpopulation.com/) is looney toons. Again: it recently said that Whitemane 55+ was 70% Alliance. The person I initially replied to thinks Faerlina is Alliance dominated.
---
As Kind Thoeden once pondered: "What can men do against such reckless ~~hate~~ naivete?
---
Completely unrealistic
---
He should be running into IF
---
You mean the guy that can talk for 30 minutes and say nothing at the same time?
---
"omg asmon kicked me from the guild" 
---
also you "I dont want to be in this guild anymore" 
---
People are going to cheat and no matter how against it you are, it will never stop. Swallow a little bit of realism and quit being so dramatic.
---
I really have missed the dry and desolate version of Thousand Needles from the old days. Such a gorgeous and atmospheric place to travel through.
---
Tell that to &lt;Apes&gt;
---
Where the fuck else are you going to get 408K people to go? Powermods control Reddit and if you don't play along, they destroy you from the inside.
---
This is happening on every server. On my server (fairbanks) it's no secret. I don't want to name any names, but there's a few players who are always in the top 20 standings every week. The first week honor came out I saw them around BRM literally all the time, which is expected.
---
But the last few weeks I've seen them less and less. Yet their honor totals each week are going up. I thought this was weird so I added a few of them and started to see them in weird zones like dun morogh (not IF), tanaris, etc. What's even more interesting is they're always in these zones together at the same time. 
---
One day in particular I saw one of these guys in the morning around BRM and he had like 16 kills for the day. Then he left and was in dun morogh for a few hours, came back and had like 120 kills. The next day he got 26k honor for the day with lesst than 300 kills. 
---
So something isn't right here. I've also heard rumors of a discord server where they plan these things with alliance and kill trade.
---
Low quality
---
I guess😇 always wanted to try, though, after watching that movie
---
&gt;but idk
---
yeah, we know
---
Lmao every salty person is horde. Obviously some people thought it was funny since it’s at the top of the sub with 2.2k upvotes. What are you on about?
---
Rogues do have evasion and ambush at 19( not saying they aren't lackluster)
---
I was defining the word and explaining how what they were doing was cheating. 
---
Dont know who pissed your cereal this morning, yeesh.
---
How do you find out server balance?
---
I guess😇 always wanted to try it, though
---
It’s kinda boring but I usually chill in discord or listen to music when I do it. But then again there’s not many farms that aren’t boring.
---
Who wonders, Asmongold was even considering doing that himself:  
---
[https://youtu.be/GRtBJta9ins?t=520](https://youtu.be/GRtBJta9ins?t=520)
---
It's never too late, there's always something going on.
---
should i equip devilsaur set or devilsaur gauntlets and giantstalker leggins ?
---
Roll alliance.
---
The one parsing 80 on luci because he popped adrenaline rush on magmadar to pad stats?
---
What about him?
---
Realistically though yes you can still parse well with shadowcraft. 
---
Now stop with your anecdotal evidence and compare it to a statistical majority.
---
&gt;Or you know... the shitloads of PVE players that are loving life and enjoying classic wow immensely. 
---
&gt;And will be participating in battlegrounds. 
---
Hell yeah!
---
Best decision I made in Classic was to roll on a PvE server.
---
Got 3 characters (2 horde 1 alliance) and enjoying all immensely.
---
Can't wait for BGs!
---
&gt; Black Friday at Walmart in the 90s
---
Was it worse in the 90s?
---
&gt;cheating is always going to happen, just stop speaking out against it
---
Found the cheater.
---
No, Horde on Kromcrush
---
I can't believe this! If I was you I'd be really upset by this over zealous censorship and demand my money back from Reddit immediately!
---
Just watch Asmongold talking about win trading and that he will do it if it wasn't against ToS ;)  
---
Mirror?
---
I completely agree, I dislike getting stuck on doorways all the time too.
---
Andddddd here is the problem folks.
---
He is referring to Advertise, who did a video on it.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXJ4RQFCVbg&amp;t=1003s
---
All of us saying these streamer servers will be full of toxicity and drama and should be avoided at all costs were downvoted into oblivion in the leadup to launch. We were told we were overreacting, that they're just a few people and it won't make a difference, that we should just shut up and stop causing panic.
---
Feeling pretty smug about all this right now. These servers are dumpster fires thanks to these "personalities"
---
Gates weren't automatically opened until 3.0.
---
And the automatic percentage you *might* get a day - if I remember correctly - wasn't much more than like 0.5% a day. Worst case scenario is that you'd still be waiting for half a year.
---
Placing the burden on the players is bad game design. This is Blizzards problem. They caused it, they need to fix it.
---
A small server with an alliance bend, good for him. Most of these guys should have rolled PVE but at least he made a real decision and stuck with it. I expect Asmon to flip flop between Retail and Faerlina/Classic and never fully make a decision about classic and his future in it.
---
&gt;They Will probably justify it like that.
---
Wouldn't that make it a valid reason for removing the post?
---
&gt;However this is still stupid as a large majority of the community liked it
---
Fair enough, but a lot of the community likes streamer drama and other streamer crap, yet that's against the rules and gets removed too.
---
Doesn't that server still have a que?
---
&gt; An army of asmon fan boys is never going to sway the tide of anything. They could outnumber the horde 3 to 1 and it wouldn't matter, the skill level is just too low.
---
That and sappers exist. It doesn't matter if there's fifty more people, they're most likely going to be clumped tightly, so a small group with enough sappers to kill most people will be enough.
---
Remember the video of when Apes went into BRM the first time? Didn't matter if they were outnumbered.
---
What do you want them to do? Revamp the honor system completely? Redo how servers are distributed? Add cross realm? Layers? These types of changes all made it into retail and contributed to the death by 1000 cuts that happened to it.
---
Perhaps "You think you want it, but you don't" is more true than people want to admit. If you want a game that evolved with the playerbase there is always retail or a dozen other MMOs
---
Damn those greedy US companies!
---
I don't think he likes Classic as much as he thought he would.
---
Nixxiom spoke on how bad the Classic streamer experience is. So bad that he quit and started a new off stream character. Now he finally enjoys the game.
---
And for as long as they are not punished and people let them get away with it it will continue and spiral out of control.
---
That's true as well.
---
Not going to out them on Reddit haha, I think they're doing pretty well now and I've seen several of their members geared out. Just took them longer to get going than I was hoping for.
---
It’s better man. Same in the old days. I know very few people who enjoyed pvp servers. There was always a lot of hype but in the end the only people who liked it were organized pvp guilds. Eventually everyone either made peace and stopped fighting or just sat in IF and got summoned to raids. 
---
Of course there were more manners back then, people often wouldn’t interfere with raid teams.
---
Its tribalism
---
Reddit Mods are always the most pathetic power hungry people, it doesn't matter what community it is.
---
I love the through-lines in a lot of the human zones pointing towards Onyxia pulling the strings all along.
---
I'm honestly amazed Herod ever has an Alliance problem, it's home to one of the bigger Multiboxer guilds on Horde side (I was going to roll there but a 4hr queue kept me away lol)
---
True. I think it's just an early part of understanding, sometimes, though (maybe hope instead of think)
---
As a speculator, leftovers is a great name. You don't even know if half of your guild is Greek and as amazing as the story of 300 is, it is biased and loved more by Greek people than anyone else. If leftovers ever becomes the top guild in any raid, it will be absolutely epic. Anyways hope the horde are happy now, the last month of entertainment must've been worth it for having a permanent pve server now.
---
Haha, yeah.. got one of these myself.. they wanted me to go to a website named Battle-armory.com or something like that..
---
Reddit moderators are the exact type of people I'd expect to be Horde players camping in Ironforge.
---
you rolled on a streamer server and joined a streamer guild. their job is to create content, ergo do anything within the tos. if i had a guy complaining about my job and how i do it (when im doing it well), i would kick you too
---
Well pretty much no one in my guild is on this sub so... I feel like we overvalue this subs impact
---
You are free to make your own subreddit.
---
They’re all super whiny for the most part... Venruki is the only one I can stand that is pretty big.
---
"Quelled the drama" that's an interesting way to say protected a cheater being called out for cheating.
---
Hey, there was a friendo offering what you're looking for on Benediction for free. Lemme find the link and ill update this. Good Luck :D
---
Imagine watching somebody else play a video game AND donate money to them lmao
---
Is there a us server equivalent close to flamelash? I wanna roll on a severely underdog realm for the lulz
---
stop whining please, alliance noob.
---
If you have a gaming mouse, many of them have like 12 buttons on the side mapped to the top row on keyboard
---
&gt; I say let him leave. It will show what a shit show PVP servers have become if one of if not the most popular WoW streamer says fuck it (I despise the guy but can't deny his influence) and goes back to retail.
---
tbh, he should've never rolled pvp. I remember ages ago he used to say he's not that great at PvP, and even admitting it on stream a few times. I think because all the other streamers went PvP, he did too. kind of like a form of peer pressure. of "oh shit, they're all going there.. I guess I have to."
---
We’ve had a great lvl60-scene for long but now with the influx of players there is alot more ppl also doing the 30-55 lvl dungeons. So again there are calls for ”SM cleave”-groups etc. Feels nice and ppl lvling alts are happy. All new guilds mostly haven’t made any noice but prices for alot of mats/items have gone down so try might be more ambitious farmers
---
I mean you always use adrenaline rush when you can...
---
I provided a log (someone linked it in the rogue discord). Everyone in the rogue discord believes 6 PC sc is better. Shadowpanther.net says 6 PC is better. 
---
So I ask you to provide evidence that the other bis gear is better. I don't know where to find this statistical majority you speak of.
---
that's classic for you.
---
Why would you pass on gear you need? Never understood that mentality.
---
...but they made changes... hence our current situation...
---
&gt; I'm not advocating for ironforge.pro, for some of the reasons that you cite. It's not accurate but it has numbers based on something. 
---
No, you very clearly said that the Horde have 28% more characters than Alliance. Those are your words.
---
If you're going to say that the addons are 'looney toons,' you'd be saying 'well we don't know and we *can't* know and any number anyone gives you can be thrown out.' 
---
You said that it's 28%, and then you doubled down and said that 
---
&gt; Ironforge.pro is not perfect but its numbers are within proximity of accurate
---
So yes, you absolutely put a TON of stock into these numbers.
---
Like if you want to talk about the methods that they use, that's fine.
---
But when I point out that it could simply be a 3% disparity in raiding population, rather than talking about that and admitting that maybe your assumptions are wrong, you try to steer the subject away.
---
The subject was Faerlina being alliance dominated. 
---
You said that no, in fact it's 28% in favor of the Horde.
---
Now you're not standing by that. And you're calling *other* people naive? Come on, dude.
---
&gt; Except this is a PVE server, 
---
Population size absolutely can determine leveling speed as I mentioned before.  There is practically zero midlevel dungeoneering going on right now.  It's either RFC or max level stuff in LFG.
---
But I'm not starting all over again. Plus, my IRL friends play on the same realm as me and we have a dope guild we're in. The game would be perfect if it weren't for all the Horde fucks that exploit the game and get away with cheap ass kills and gank squads.
---
Mcconnell is funny though.
---
Well that is like saying everyone complaining here are free to make their own private server or join a pve server. That haven't stopped half the community
---
Wtf u talking bout
---
&gt;Ok, so the thing that happened. Like, people did things, right? And we did the same thing or similar. But we didn't do anything, right? No one was doing anything, but we have proof, alright? And, you know, it is what it is. Like, we wanna do this but we also don't, right? And we have proof on everybody else doing it. Like, no one is doing anything so just chill guys, alright? So that's the thing, ok?
---
Let  me guess, you're a dick to people online.
---
I think its more that Blizzard doesn't want to pay more CS to investigate these issues.
---
They want to automate CS as much as possible to reduce costs and you can't automate wintrading investigations.
---
Blizzard can't change mentality of the community and that's what made things went the way it happened.
---
You wanna use DPS plate gear.
---
Ah, the clue scroll PvP posting. Got it
---
Go to retail
---
But they already *made a change*. They increased the server population fivefold. That in itself was already a big game-changer that made some of the previous systems redundant and dangerous. They have already redone the servers, so making a horror scenario out of "redo how servers are distributed?!" is completely pointless.
---
*Something* has to give. And always shouting "#NO CHANGES GO BACK TO RETAIL!" won't solve any of the problems this HK farming is causing. The #NoChanges train left the station when Blizzard decided that servers could hold six times the population of old. 
---
And nobody is talking about copying retail. What I expect Blizzard to do is to propose a solution *that fits Classic*.
---
Thanks for listening to us and adding a hardcore option to the game, Blizz. Feels great being able to play wow with a higher difficulty option.
---
That's not what I mean. I mean accepting the queue and having a pre-arranged agreement with the opposing team on who to let win. Winning or losing fast in 5 minute games is better honor per hour than having a slow AB game that is 3/2 bases or a turtling WSG game.
---
Im confused do u still want to rank in a guild that is actively making it harder for you. I'm rank 6 and standing 140 but what would I be if there weren't cheaters in Olympus?
---
&gt;There really isn't much discussion at all.
---
A lot of it is, it just gets buried under memes and streamer drama.  
---
&gt;The only thing I have seen coming up again and again the last couple of weeks are unbalanced server discussions which was also encouraged by the meme they removed?
---
If this is the only thing you see come up, I think you might selectively be choosing posts that align with what you want to see.
---
There's plenty more discussions, the newest post on /r/classicwow right now is about a Guild Master asking for advice to who he should have given a hand of Rag to.

Yeah, we should just like, sit here and post uh...random screenshots from Tanaris or something with captions "so beautiful" and 8000 more threads on how they fucked up X component of the game and people trying to recruit  alliance refugees to their server. 
---
The rule has nothing to do with this. There are  no less than 5 other "low effort memes" like this on the front page right now with hundreds and thousands of upvotes. If you want a sub without any memes, fine. It's the arbitrary nature of their deletion that makes it annoying when [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e7gled/be_right_there/) is cool to be #1 post on the sub but OP's isn't for...no real discernible reason. Be consistent with the rule or don't have it all.

I did arms til 57 and the respec was excellent qol. Pug healers are unreliable af, access to 10% extra armor, better shield use, and the amazing ability last stand were huge

Admittedly SS is extremely OP for aoe threat. I could certainly see 5 mans being easier in a Arms/Defiance  build. Personally I've rather liked Improved Revenge, it and 8sec taunt cd is non trivial

Lol I get that but every other post on this sub is Alliance complaining about Horde in WPVP. It's pretty tiresome, although I appreciate the meme.
---
Songs are Hey Ya with Outkast and some random song ive never heard. These companies 😑 no Ads, also their Music gets heard by more and still block it? Can't be smart
---
Where the heck is Flamelash? It’s not popping up as a server!?
---
The honor system should be disabled outside of battlegrounds. The PVP servers were fine before phase 2, and they're ruined by the system that forces people to go out and shit up the servers. If honor points were only awarded from battlegrounds, then the PVP servers would go back to the way they were before phase 2. Organic ganking would return and things would go back to the way they were.
---
I can’t speak for everyone but back in vanilla, my team PVPed for rank as a means to and end for the good gear; we had all of our fun raiding.
---
This sub is just an echo chamber of negitivity. The vast, vast majority of the playerbase is just enjoying the game and has probably never even heard of this sub.
---
I haven't played since 3 weeks after launch but keep it up
---
Only person who needs to talk is the raid leader. His communication is key, everybody else just needs to listen. If he delegates a lot of his role (healing assignments, tank assignments, banish roles) to others they should be able to communicate as well (not necessarily with a mic but it helps).  Tanks don’t need to communicate but it does help a lot.
---
I was liking his content but stopped supporting him after all the vile political stuff put in his videos as cheap jokes
---
I would argue that Madseasonshow isn't cancer at all.
---
Is this on Blaumeux? I recognize the name eternal because they always bring a raid group whenever you fuck with one of their members Lmfaooo.
---
I stopped using it in Darkshore and then tried to use it again around level 30, ended up having to message one of the creators on their discord and he had me go pick up some random quest and then Reinstall the add-on.
---
So like it can be fixed but if you're gonna use it then you need to follow it to a T.

Happy manic monday everyone! Got a question for what's the optimal levelling zone for a level 30 night elf hunter? :)
---
being kicked for cheating....duh?
---
I think he's explaining it from the mentality of the super serious rank 14 planning players. If they want to get r14 as soon as possible, they "have" to do it, to not fall behind other groups that do it. I'm not planning to do it, but i acknowledge that it is effective, and "necessary" for them.
---
I said quester, not aoe grinders.
---
Cool, tyvm for the info
---
Low-effort post. Should be removed.
---
I don't really see anyone questioning whether you should have stayed.  It's just that you gave an ultimatum that you didn't want to be part of the guild of they didn't kick the other dude.  What did you realistically expect the outcome of that to be?
---
Payo and Pilav are my fav, hilarious too

I might be wrong, but i don’t think the charge interupts?

What a loser, who gives a shit if people are win trading? There’s no rules about cross faction collusion.

Krogue was acting like win trading is gonna create some massive disparity in the ranking system lol
---
Literally nobody on Faerlina is gonna give a shit. Hell, every guild is doing some form of cross faction collusion. The only thing on people’s minds in Faerlina is what to do about the horde outnumbering Alliance and how to get people out of Ironforge.

No one saying they do but your title makes it seem like you got randomly kicked for pointing out cheaters but you just pointed them out then literally asked to be kicked.  It's just funny.
---
Who wants to go the distance ?

Yeah, it is silly, but at the same time, i cannot fault them for drawing a harsh line in the sand and just not doing any balance changes at all, because if they make 1 balance change, then people would want other balance changes.

it still wastes a slot though. having one or a dozen bank alts doesn't change that.

I'm on possibly the most balanced server, and you can usually find a few alliance stealthies (including hunters, fucking shadowmeld...) hiding near the tower killing zep jumpers. Most of the time nobody stops them, which is extremely sad. Imagine the horde not wanting to PVP when it's right there in their front yard. Laziness? Afraid? I can't explain it.
---
He obviously likes asmon to be in his guild, or even roll on his server for that matter. He knows how asmon is, hes a piece of shit... Thus he did zero good by joining his guild knowing full well how it was going to be, then getting all bent out of shape because what was obviously going to happen, happened.

I would take that graph with a grain of salt towards the end dip, as you can see it doesn't have many data points logged for the horde. But it seems like a decently balanced server, where ther are a shitton of member on both factions, so its not a 30/70 nightmare.
---
Yep our mt switched because we have 2 fury warriors and a rogue who have 99% parses for the tier. He hates it and is only doing it to hold threat on them. He goes full consumes and world buff every raid with 3 dedicated healers to keep him up. Like you said, it's a tool not a goal
---
Most casual hardcore guilds would be better served speed running with a dedicated feral popping crowd pummelers rn. More utility and honestly safer due to the health pool and armor capping
---
Good story. I always played horde since 2005, so i won't reroll alliance.
---
I played on northdale last year, and the server was alliance dominated, thus i can feel the pain for alliance in classic.
---
I think thé only culprit is blizzard with layers and overpopulation unveiled when P2 hit.
---
And yet nothing I said was wrong
---
God I’m glad the other comments already shat all over this post
---
Its definitely a faction imbalance. But Heartseeker is defiantely in the minority, most servers are horde heavy.

As 60 rogue you can pickpocket RFD and kill most of the bosses and make 30-50g an hour depending on drops.

I went full prot at 52 as on my server overland questing died with honor system and I can only level in dungeons. It is fantastic and I am glad I did so. I think you’re correct, most people don’t need fury with current content. I’m now at 58 and best place to level is final 5 mans, tough to keep up agro with higher geared level 60 DPS but think I’d rather use more explosives as I’m an engineer. This seems better than respec to impale/prot since I don’t think I’ve got the gear to support that yet.
---
Hand of Rag is not a Shaman or a Paladin or a Warrior weapon, it's a "*whoever has the most free time to farm the massive amount of gold needed to craft it*" weapon.
---
Forgot the part where it has 3ppm which is 15 seconds per minute. That is about 3,5% damage buff per caster.
---
Quickest way to lose 140 pounds.  
---
Or 240 depending on what you’re into.
---
Yeh lol, Revenge of the WoW-Nerds.
---
Wow man. Excellent response. Kind of expected you to just call me names, haha. Appreciate the thoughtful challenge.
---
So I agree, but with a twist.
---
On Heartseeker (my server) this behavior started well before honor came out. Getting into BRM was a 3 rez trip before honor was released. So if it's incentivized, it's intrinsically so, and honor just builds in that.
---
So what makes it intrinsically rewarding? To me that's where role engulfment comes in. Role engulfment just helps explain why it is intrinsically rewarding. I think there are other factors at play, but it's like reflected glory when watching "your" sports team. Though I absolutely agree with you on Zimbardo's "experiment" (it's really more of a case study), I think it showed something powerful: just how easy it is to trigger these conditions through even fictitious circumstances. And I do believe we're seeing the same phenomenon here, and that it has nothing to do with the character of alliance or horde players individually. 
---
That's my argument. I don't think Zimbardo's experiment needs to have a ton of rigor to support that argument.
---
You must be fun at parties
---
In knew I'd never want to do fury prot once I had TM. Its so critical for flowing as a warrior

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_prison_experiment
---
Imagine theres a small comparison here
---
This is why I dont take reddit seriously. Someone can stub their toe at home and call for genocide
---
**Stanford prison experiment**
---
The Stanford prison experiment (SPE) was a social psychology experiment that attempted to investigate the psychological effects of perceived power, focusing on the struggle between prisoners and prison officers. It was conducted at Stanford University on the days of August 14–20, 1971, by a research group led by psychology professor Philip Zimbardo using college students. In the study, volunteers were assigned to be either "guards" or "prisoners" given their personality traits, in a mock prison, with Zimbardo himself serving as the superintendent. Several "prisoners" left mid-experiment, and the whole experiment was abandoned after six days.

I got one and messaged it back cause I’m not stupid and it logged off right after haha. Reported it. Hopefully they get them haha
---
IMO: Hand of rag is a pvp weapon. Shaman enhancement is fucking garbage meme spec. However I do think whoever gets it should actually PAY FOR IT. Not the guild. Guild has way more important stuff to do than pay for peoples pvp gear that's ridicules. So yeah give it whoever actually wants to pay for it, and at that point it's probably only one or two guys.
---
That could be a possibilty , im often thinking that since the average age of players who wanted classic is somehow not the future customers , that in the end Classic was just a gift.They will cash out and do the minimum of labor salary to just keep it up until the end.And i hope i am wrong lol
---
It actually does matter.
---
The choice is picking a class with the best racials. Being very resistant to stuns and immune to CCs means you have an advantage.
---
Not most players who pick undead did it because they wanted to have the pvp advantage, but the ones who want pvp advantage picked undead or orc, and that's why most bad people are horde. It could just as well have been alliance races with those racial abilities, and it would be the other way around.
---
The irony is how triggered you are by the reports and subsequent comments. ;)
---
The problem is not the time it takes, the problem is you have to play the same day every week if u wanna play with decent people
---
It was.
---
Whoa there, so did you not see that whole part where I said
---
&gt;Doesn't matter if the system jerks you off while giving you a rimjob that'd make a porn star blush, if your actions are causing other players to leave then you don't get to whine on the official forums or act flummoxed when for an entire faction, the best option is not to play.
---
Maybe... Maybe I think both are at fault? But maybe I also think that you turning someones playing experience into a permanent spectral adventure and refusing to accept your role in it makes you a fucking idiot. 
---
&gt;corpse camp, FP camp, and if I see someone with ress sickness I will take the free honor.

I think you’re definitely correct.  Just placing the graveyard an adequate distance away should fix that problem.
---
Is Stonespine that bad? I'm Horde and get steamrolled by groups of 5-10 alliance all the time. Seen plenty of ally out in the wild too. Out of interest I just used /who and there was 1 Rogue each in SW and IF and no other horde players
---
Ahh, I see. thanks for the clarification. So yeah, based on that, it would make sense to, ideally, craft multiple and adapt as the current boss fight demands.
---
Obviously those aren't real alliance players, just Horde mains that re-rolled onto another sever.
---
Definitely.
---
This.
---
If you’re already 60 that’s one thing. But a huge portion of the population isn’t yet, and getting camped constantly while you’re just trying to level up is not fun.
---
I lived it on Skeram as Alliance. Transferred to Earthfury and it’s 10x better because the population is relatively even. The threat of a massive war between Horde and Alliance is usually enough in most questing zones to keep things from getting completely out of hand, and allows for you to quest in relative peace. Most PvP is pretty even and takes place in 1v1 matchups. I can stomach that even if I’m on the losing end. It’s getting ganked and then camped by 3-5 Horde players that is particularly obnoxious and stupid.
---
Edit: getting downvoted just for sharing my experience? Are Horde players really this blind to the problem they’re perpetuating? Pretty fuckin pathetic to be honest
---
&gt; Chatting with guildies for half an hour while sitting next to auction isn't the same effort.

Not what we're talking about. Nice attempt to derail though.

You don't. It's fucking garbage don't fucking do it.
---
RFD: DE'ing 3 boss loot is like 30-50g per hour way more than pickpocket and no deaths. Also you can clear this in like 30 mins then go afk for 30 or play alt.
---
Mara: You can just run from orange to purple (or opposite) and collecting the 6 ghost mushrooms per run. Easily 30g per hour and again you can finish it in like 35-40 mins and go afk

---
MAKE GAME DIFFERENT
---
There's a difference between not taking a joke and being tired of seeing the same joke repeated for 2 years straight but with a slightly different "twist"
---
&gt; There is a difference between making deliberate changes to the core gameplay (ie: redo honor system, layers, etc) and allowing servers to be hold more players due to technology simply being better.
---
When you design a game to be played by 16 players at a time, and then you send 50 players on that same field, then you've just changed the game in a major, unpredictable fashion.
---
&gt; I fail to see how higher server population caps has impacted the game in a way that making a change to the honor system would. 
---
You have more consecutive players online on a high/full server, and by having more available players, you suddenly create the situation to easily block all flight-paths and capital cities. If 100 people want to farm HK in a 40 man raid, you can lock down possibly two cities. If you have 400 people who want to do the same, you now have to accommodate *ten* raids.
---
This creates major issues as the game wasn't designed to handle 500 active people farming for HK. Not with the connections, population numbers and computer hardware of 2004.
---
&gt; Proposing solutions that "fit" is **exactly** how we got to modern retail. Just because one change has been let through, doesn't mean more should follow. Just further proves my point of how the slippery slope comes into play. 
---
Yes, we get it. You people are the conservatives of the WoW universe. If we suddenly turned a cloak from green to blue, it would collapse the entire WoW and would lead to retail because of *insert Chinese proverb here*.
---
The fact is that if something creates an unplayable environment for a good portion of the players, it needs to be addressed.
---
&gt; We adjust the honor system, then in a few months we get people who are level 35 right now complaining they can't do MC when they hit 60, so now we drop in a system that makes it easier to find players to raid with (LFR? Cross realm? etc) and these small changes add up over time and get rid of the core essence of why people wanted Classic in the first place. 
---
Which absolutely *nobody* is proposing. I am so bloody tired of these arguments essentially always turning into this nonsense of a "who can one-up this suggestion?!" content.
---
It's like those political conversations when someone proposes to increase social payments by 2% and someone else goes: "SURE! WHAT'S NEXT?! WE GIVE EVERY POOR PERSON A FREE FERRARI?!" It's absolutely ridiculous.
---
&gt; You have a subset of the population enjoying the game as is, you have another subset that wants something to change. 
---
I will re-iterate this: if you have fun with having a largely difficult or unplayable game, then that's fine by me. But I'd argue that *everyone* who left the server disagrees with this assessment. And I'm sorry, but the "we need to listen to EVERYONE" card simply doesn't apply when you have a few hundred people enjoying this, but so many people abandoning unbalanced servers.
---
Even back in vanilla, unbalances like this were never fun. Glorifying them now is just nonsense.
---
LOK’TAR
---
Remember, you can always keep yourself permaflagged if that's your choice. Certainly adds a fair amount of risk, and you avoid the roaming death balls that are so common on pvp servers, because nobody expects people to be flagged just for the hell of it, but you would still run the risk of 1-2 players stumbling across you. Running into dungeons might be challenging, but if you're quick enough, people likely won't notice, so it's an unknown level of risk.
---
You’re right about the first part but players were not using “only pve” gear in top end arena aside from rogues, and they only got away with it because of cheat death. And even then they would still  generally use a couple of resilience pieces.
---
Fury does really well in dungeons for me. Arms does well enough.

Well faction based pvp isn’t a problem like your comment seemed to imply. It’s awesome.

I've had Warmode on all the time. I'm horde yet I'm pretty sure the servers have always had more alliance players but they usually have it off. I never saw horde gank squads. Just people playing mostly solo and some small skirmishes with 2-3 man horde teams killing alliance. The moment they started giving alliance free high ilvl gear for having warmode on alliance were running everywhere in 20-40 man raids killing everything. Horde started to turn warmode off because there was no point in keeping it on as it would be impossible to play without forming full raids and you aren't rewarded for doing it anyway. It died down eventually.
---
Alliance players are all good and can’t do anything wrong! 
---
The Horde asked for it!
---
I just joined Classic so I haven’t been there for long, but I have seen quite some people RP already.
---
In retail I changed to a RP server 8 years ago and haven’t regretted it one minute. Real friendly people all around and the coolest RP thing I have seen was a Company of about 15 Tauren players marching through Ashenvale in formation, mounts matching armor and all. It makes it all much more immersive.

To be fair, AQ will be cleared pretty quick. Or not. Who am I to say.

I'm interested in rolling an alliance alt on a horde dominated server and fighting against overwhelming odds. Preferably a US EST server that is not Kirtonos (where my main is). Any server recommendations?
---
Im a shadowpriest and you dont need both at all, go gnomish, you can buy sapper charges and rocket boots / helmet. The only thing you cant have as gnomish is the dragonling thingie and some other useless stuff. But then again its not that expensive to level up engineering.
---
Uh news flash but this is happening in literally every guild with more than 10 people. Doesn't matter how honorable or respectful you think they are. Just like it happened 15 years ago.
---

I just started 10 days ago and am having a blast. Our server is super busy except for during the middle of the night.
---
Spot on retort! You're right. No one in any conversation is ever allowed to bring up anecdotes from years of experience in a community. Everything must be a peer reviewed, rigorous scientific study with causal relationships to make any form of assertion in a casual conversation.
---
These stereotypes (undead rogues being dicks, etc.) aren't conjured from thin air. They're based from literally millions of peoples experience in these communities. If you want to discredit those millions of experiences cause it doesn't have 50 peer reviewed citations, hey that's on you my man. But this is just how people talk. Normal people in normal conversations share experiences and anecdotes without needing to APA format their posts.
---
You miss on a lot of items if you dont go gnomish, because the items are BOP and not BOE. Specially Gnomish Death Ray
---
I would like to make an alt primarily to heal. I thought shaman would be a good choice as I love things like chain heal aesthetically, they're in high demand, the totem stuff is pretty cool, ghost wolf will help with leveling speed, they'll be good in PvP and every guild from most casual to most hardcore wants a good amount of you in their raid throughout all content. There's just one problem: I'm at 16 now and I don't like leveling it. I don't really know what it is. But perhaps it will get more fun later? At what level would you say "if you don't enjoy it now, you're might as well quit because it's not going to get better"? (For example, on a Druid I would advice someone to at least level until you have cat form and extra movement speed talent before you give up on it)

hahahahahha stop standing up to asmon. u cant beat him

I mean these are actually "pvp happened on a pvp server"....
---
Any competent warrior will not want hand of rag, there are many weapons in BWL that outclass it for PVE
---
Who really needs screenshots?
---
I can confirm the first one at least, but HS canceling is tedious at best, and it makes a swingtimer addon almost mandatory (you should really be playing with one anyway).  Once you get the hang of it, though, it's a powerful tool.
---
Hard to know Mcconnell is doing an act when I've never seen him not in that persona.  
---
At least he's consistent. Consistently annoying. Doesn't try to hide it. Doesn't try to deny it. The moment I hear him on stream, he acts exactly how I'd expect him to.
---
The fact that Blizz could have saved players from their own short-sightedness and greed is not the same as it's their fault.
---
That's like saying that if everyone throws trash on the street it's the city's fault for not cleaning fast enough.

It's honestly not that hard not to camp grey lowbies.

Can yall take it easy with the drama kool aid

I can have a beer at 7am in my street and no one will question it. Also full front nudity at any time of the day or night on any media and religion is not on our currency. You'd give me $5,000,000 to move to the US, I'd rather stay unemployed in mum basement where I have the best healthcare and free education just like the 7 generations before me and only orange moron without a valid passport could think it's not sustainable.

#Warning headphone users!

I instantly closed the video after that lovely intro. Quality blaring siren, thanks much.

This isn't classic, obviously. Why is this here?

Yea but you should have your gaming mouse binded to your numpad numbers so you can use the normal easily reachable numbers as their own keybinds
---
u can have ur mudhut back in 2 days

Are you alliance on razorgore? Because as a horde there it feels like we are always more

\#nochanges
---
🦀🦀🦀BLIZZARD WONT RESPOND TO THIS POST🦀🦀🦀
---
My points is they’re both dudes who are famous on the internet for being annoying assholes 24/7 and both claim that they’re acting.
---
Dude my house is older than your country, get invaded and ransacked a thousand time and then we can talk on comon grounds about war and freedom.
---
I mean you can just run with a decent pug that oneshots all bosses
---
Yep, stalagg alliance reporting here and it’s fine, just requires a little mental fortitude and cleverness.
---
The furthest i go without a gaming mouse is number 5 and the number 5 is for something that i rarely need
---
You want the list chronologically or alphabetically?
---
Not sure its exactly the game's fault. Seems to me that certain faction, races and classes attract certain people. Like the silver haired nelf hunter and undead rogue stereotype. I've played TBC, WOTLK and nowadays classic, and it always seemed to me that horde really took pride in their faction and personally identified with it, yelling/typing LOK'TAR OGAR and meaning it, while on the other hand i've literally never heard anyone do a Salama ashal'anore/ For the alliance or anything similar unironically
---
I think it's dubbed to avoid copyright
---
Our freedom kind of prevents that invasion and ransacking thing from being a prevalent part of our history.
---
I mean I posted frequently on the retail wow reddit before classic.  I raided in a top 50 world guild and frequently offered hardcore raiding advice, but it was almost met with some type of hostility.  It has been clear for a loooooong time the average redditor is a very casual wow player.  It was before classic, so why would it change?  There is even a competitive wow subreddit created because of this, and those are still filled with people barely scratching top 1000 world.
---
Both good servers, Mograine is a big server, Firemaw a tiny bit bigger
---
Both are also fairly balanced, I have nothing but good experiences on Mograine myself
---
hahaha that's awesome
---
Populations and imbalances aren't really the issue. Is the mindset of the players. If people weren't so toxic and had the NEED to relentlessly camp people for no reason (honor isn't a reason, this isn't good honor), there wouldn't be that much of an issue.
---
You can gouge then restealth and the combo points stay up to build up 5 before a fight.
---
Literally saw an adverstise clp on it again this weekend so it's still there on classic.
---
Yes. There are toxic people on both sides. Maybe its luck mostly and population
---

---
Dude he is straight up wrong. This is how I guarantee my lasher farming stays under 1 hour total on a pvp server. Once you "rez" in the DM:E door you will log reset to the DM:E door. This is how I lasher farm.
---
Blizzard will not ban them because they are paying their monthly subscription. At most it will get probably a slap on the wrist but nothing more.
---
Unfortunately this is the reality and it hurts me to see what people are doing to this game and to what extends one is willing to go just to get some digital currency, but hey what do I know, for some people maybe this game is the only thing that is left in their life.
---
Whatever you say.
---
I am not saying that faction based PvP is bad, that was not the intention of my comment. Just that without guidance it does not work. With guidance I mean things such as faction balance enforcement(as you said) which they should have done from the start.
---
I should have been more specific with my original comment.
---
Yes, the only items that are locked out are the gnomish transporter. But I believe you only take gnomish to 260 then you drop it. 
---
You just have to get the BoP items like gnomish death ray.
---
I found a bunch of these online and at a local thrift store.  They are cool just for nostalgia purposes.
---
&gt; EDIT WELP ASMON GKICKED ME:
---
&gt; https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e7xr61/asmon_gkicks_for_standing_against_honor_cheaters/
---
Lol cheating and what not isn't cool but holy fuck is the shit you said in g chat cringe as hell.
---
Like imagine actually caring about any of this to the point where you're whining in g chat and putting in ultimatums.
---
I don't get what you're talking about. None of that is in the pictures.
---
You picked the wrong server bruh
---
I agree. Sulfuras is not a Thunderfury, that will massively help your Guild in future Raids, so everyone tries to help out.
---
Sulfuras is a PvP Weapon and should always go to the person who is farming mats for it.
---
I see what you mean then. It’s totally true. What a missed opportunity. Thankful to be on a balanced PvP server
---
Hand of Rag does not help a guild in PvE, it is quickly outclassed and is wasted on a warrior, it is nothing but a spectacle weapon and something to have made by your guild. At least shaman or paladins can get some use out of it 
---
wasted
---
It won’t. Horde will likely have 15-20 minute queues, at least at the start. Alliance will be instant.
---
Where do you think they will spend that time farming? And now the Alliance that actually like fighting are no longer in the world.
---
Horde bad

---
I logged in just to send you a message of encouragement.  People are always going to complain about loot, because in their mind they are entitled to it. Fuck those guys. 
---
Your guild did what needed to be done. The person was with you grinding for the guild from day one, or at least super early on? Pay day for them.
---
I stepped down from the leadership team in my guild cause I couldnt take all the crying over loot.. even if there was a point system in place. You did the right thing. Keep being fair and loyal to the guild and the salt lickers will have to suckle on their tears.
---
What you should have done differently is not get hit by Wrath of Rag. How is that even possible?
---
Who the f cares? Get your lives together, guys.
---
I’ve got TSM but it only shows recipes I have.
---
I quit because of Blizzard bending the knee to China, but holy fuck, my last few weeks grinding through Stranglethorn was hell. My server was 30/70 and STV was a joke. Anyone who spends their time camping Nesingwary Camp will die alone.
---
It is fascinating. Also Mal’ganis to my memory has been horde dominant since like fucking 2007 and has survived fine. And I feel like I’m blanking on the name, blood something or burning the other was definitely extremely horde dominated in vanilla and by the time wotlk rolled around it was about even.
---
Point is it’s atleast slightly different when ques are cross realm and there’s 500,000- 1 mil to pull from. The only reason to play classic is to get hot loot to fuck bitches up in anyway.
---
There's a pretty extensive catalog you can find online if you were actually curious. This type of question just comes off lazy and intentionally ignorant. 
---
Specifically, I genuinely don't believe you're completely clueless to at least *some* of the reasons.
---
Gotcha. Must’ve read it wrong thanks!
---
&gt; They almost saw the other faction as non-human or sub-human. 
---
That would be implying that they are human to begin with
---
I did kinda word it oddly xd
---
&gt;I'm joining every PVP raid to make Benediction-Horde's life miserable and return the favor. Camp you all for hours and make the game unplayable till you all are forced to quit and we have Gnome Rogues being the new Undead Rogues.
---
Are you kidding? Da Boys - Honor farming ? You didn't do anything to us? 
---
# LOL - ACTUAL LOL
---
Oh there's blood in the water and Alliance is getting it. Logging into Benediction now to support the culling.
---
Cull the herd ... uh, Horde.
---
I wasn't exactly in a position to make it rain gold on freshies. I didn't even have a 60 at the time, let alone an epic mount.
---
Regardless, the main point is the same. Make it rain on level 1s.
---
You all are just looking for reasons to shit on Asmongold, aren't you?
---
People have other shit to do
---
I was more referring to the more modern (alternate) version of the meaning about someone getting upset by something, although the fact that my second situation happens enough there probably is some psychological explanation there.
---
No that's just what happens when you play classic for a long time.
---
His main char didn't get items funneled to him (barring the obvious MT stuff) and gold (which doesn't matter). But there's flat out little to nothing to do in classic once you get your gear unless *you* decide you want to do something. Even I've hit that wall, and I certainly don't get shit funneled to me.
---
Maybe put some time into researching servers before launch / before you start the game, and you prob wouldn't have that problem.
---
Should, but not really
---
No thanks. People camping FPs, graveyard camping questers, forcing corpse runs to do instances, and camping boats don't deserve to stroke their fragile egos anymore.
---
Doing loot council in MC is a big mistake. It's faceroll content for most bosses.
---

---
I play on stalagg
---
You honestly can't see at all how stupid this sounds?
---
&gt;At best he can get 3 full raid teams.
---
So it works pretty well rofl. You can pretty much stomp whatever you want with 3 raids.
---
Alliance are fewer but are doing pretty fine no? I play horde on skullflame and pvp never seems like an alliance-slaughter to me. But that could only be my perspective.
---
Not true at all but I appreciate your concern lol
---
The only bans I heard of were when 3 arena teams colluded to have exactly the same top ranking.
---
1 of the teams had a player which was a GM. Only 2 teams were banned, can you guess which?
---
If it wasn't streamed live tho, and people just recorded the race instead.
---
Dude don't  talk if you don't  know. He was doing  special shamless runs which were the idea of the chat and everyone who was in the raid was aware of this. The point is to entertain people. Not to play  like a normal person would....
---
If the margin of success is Chinese people buying pretty rainbow ponies to ride on in a virtual world than it’s a fairly low bar. But to each it’s own.
---
Gnome is the best
---
Piranha vs guppies in a huge body of water is a ridiculously bad analogy in every way.
---
Standing in front of the Org bank for hour stretches, going back and forth between mounted and unmounted, isn't "shit to do".
---
Thanks for the reply. I understand you get it for free if you're exalted. But what I mean is, if I decided to just stay at revered, can I just pay the fee and not have to get exalted? Also do you have a source?
---
WOW the warrior even had OEB?   Yah, you fucked that shaman hard....  All because you wanted him to stay resto.   And your warrior is prob MS spec, instead of Fury.
---
So, instead of giving the item to your shaman that is doing the thankless job of healing, you gave it to the DPS spec warrior that already has a good 2h.
---
&gt;We need you to carry us, so we don't want to tempt you with a pvp/farming weapon.  Just heal us, and go fuck yourself.
---
Imagine starting a sentence with imagine unironically
---
As an alliance player on another horde dominated server let me explain this.
---
The Horde control all the important level 60 areas.  BRM, Theramore, Menethil, the boats, and all the FP's.  They also generally hold the FP's in EPL, WPL, and frequently Winterspring.  They have generally hundreds in BRM and most of a 40 man raid in the other locations all at once.
---
Alliance wants to get kills too.  So how do we get them?  We hunt the 50-59 range.  We find all the leveling zones where there aren't raid groups camping, but there are HK's to be had.  Felwood, Winterspring quest areas, EPL and WPL outside the hubs, Stonard, etc.  In those areas we can run around in groups of 5-10 and kill leveling Horde and the occasional 60 that wanders into us.  Bad news for leveling characters, but is really just another symptom of the shit show that's going on everywhere valuable.
---
It's one of the most imbalanced servers?
---
I think your problems could have been mitigated without respeccing, tbh. Better shield usage, wearing more plate, etc. are all options for arms as well. You don’t need imp revenge, imp taunt, last stand, toughness, etc for 5-10 man dungeons. 2h arms is undeniably bis for dungeon content even at level 60.
---
Can't have toons of both factions on PVP servers.
---
yo socketpuppet
---
It's pretty easy to get 250 eng or whatever. Not a grind or expensive. Getting to 300 is the hard part.
---
When I say at best, it doesn't mean "all the time", it means "every once in a while". His normal comp is about raid and a half against several different raids, all out there ready to attack him specifically. Regardless of how many people he had to protect him, he always died, it's not because he's shitty, it's because he's focused.
---
No, it's actually his voice. It's a bit exaggerated as you can imagine but it's not extremely exaggerated. He's definitely playing a shtick but his actual voice isn't far from that.
---
 I really enjoy/appreciate with Advertise is doing but his voice makes me want to eat glass.
---
&gt; No that's just what happens when you play classic for a long time.
---
He's been playing for less than 4 months dude lol. 
---
&gt; His main char didn't get items funneled to him (barring the obvious MT stuff) and gold (which doesn't matter)
---
Is this a typo? He verifiably *did* get loot and gold funneled to him. There were numerous top level posts on this very sub showing twitch clips of his viewers lining up to funnel gold to him to get his 60% and then 100% mount respectively, with thousands of gold leftover to buy BiS BoE's the moment he hit 60.
---
Your mentality shows exactly why you're bored, by the way. None of that "matters", it's all a race to the end and everything besides that doesn't matter. That's exactly why you, and he, is bored. The game isn't a race to "finish", it's a marathon hike to enjoy the sights throughout. The fun is spending months taking your time. When you rush past that, whether through poopsocking it or getting it funneled, there's nothing left.
---
I wouldn't, which is why I don't WPvP.

---
Even in general, if you see two people going 1v1 out in the world and it's close- dont jump in and fuck it up. Especially if you're like 10 levels higher.
---
It's perfectly fair to wax the guy at 10% health if he beats your faction's representative but God damn it sucks so bad to have a great fight with someone and then have a 60 just step in and take you out.
---
I'm 53, but my whole journey there I've refused to jump in a fair 1v1 between alliance and horde because those fights are the real test of which side should inherit azeroth. As soon as a 3rd participant or more are involved then all bets are off and do whatever but I truly believe interrupting a 1v1 in progress for free honor is the true dishonorable kill. My alliance kin, if they are of equal power, deserve to fall if they can't handle an enemy of equal strength. I will happily avenge their death and res them after the fact but I respect my enemy too much to rob them of the same
---
Profit is the main metric they look at.

Was why they got so scared about angering China over Hong Kong.

Ah thanks for the clarification, my apologies.

It is exactly what you said. Just go in blind try it out :)
---
Talk to people when you are ingame if you need help or tips. Mostly if you act like a normal human being people will embrace you and welcome you in to the family :)
---
Of course it is. There is no monitary gain for anybody, so why would it be against the TOS?
---
Enable them.

what do you mean? you cant 1v20? get better at the game
---
Alright, just wanted to be sure! thanks!
---
If everyone is doing it and blizzard doesn’t take action then you better catch up.
---
Pay for a full year or work the AH on retail to convert the gold to game time. My wife signs on maybe 2 times a week and pays for both our subscriptions that way.
---
&gt; shutting down new account creating char on a server fraction that has gotten to high compared to the other fraction and reopened when the numbers were closer together.
---
That would mean people couldn't play with their friends, which for many would mean simply not subscribing at all.
---
What does "toxic" mean besides "I don't like this"?
---
Edit: I ask this all the time and there has never been a response from the person using the term.  It's like "toxic" is just something people mindlessly throw out there as a condemnation, but it doesn't mean shit.
---
Ah yes, "We depth account investigation.... "

Didn’t the first guild clear MC like 4 days after classic was released?

that's not a necro. THIS is a necro.

&gt;*I literally couldn't give less of a shit about Asmongold and his pack of wankers*

But go on, please. Tell me more about how you don't care, have zero knowledge over something posted with great frequency (daily), yet, still need some details on the topic.
---
"*I literally couldn't give less of a shit* but I'd also like someone to take the time and post examples of the topic I literally couldn't give less of a shit about. I'm also going out of my way to tell everyone I literally couldn't give a shit by continuing to post on the topic. Remember, I literally couldn't give a shit."
---
Nah, I am offtank for my guild. The reason I'm fury prot is to have the survivability of prot + close to the dps potential of a fury. There is no point brining 2 prot warriors.

Haha I feel the holy priest pain. I can only go out and PvP if I'm with my buddies. Just got benediction though, so at least that's an excuse to start a shadow set.

Alliance can’t even kill Horde in their city with help from guards this is somehow the Horde’s fault.
---
Dual wield is not much stronger for Warriors. Bonereaver's Edge on a Fury Warrior is extremely strong.
---
I literally was but ok
---
What's the point?
---
Battleborn is a dead game. I can't even find 4 other people to play a BOT match with.
---
Classic is far from dead.
---
Getting to BRM to do an instance is not any fun. But world pvp have normalized some. We got some good pvp groups going. But once horde gathers there is no match
---
The graveyard is right there and this will add 15 minutes tops to your run. Alliance deal with 45-60 minutes to do ANYTHING. Horde can change continents safely, alliance cannot. Everyone but one of my friend group have stopped playing (alliance)
---
[streamer benefits](https://streamable.com/s3vs2)

My point is arms is not a raidspec. you may call it a dps spec, but it is an offspec, and it is equal to your healers comming as DPS spec and your tank as offspec also.

I play on whitemane and I never hear anything about the population balance.  Is there somewhere where I can look at info or is this all just mouth to ear stats

How could you charge someone for a res anyway?  After you res them what's to stop then from just not paying and telling you to fuck off?
---
I saw that the other day and wondered why someone had a character doing that. I just chalked you to someone looking to get someone to chuckle. But this also seems like something Horde would do.
---
Hunter for questing.
---
Mage for aoe grinding.
---
He has nothing else. His channel relies on the words Asmongold and Estefand. He is dying for content with Asmon not really playing classic these days.
---
For most classes 100hp is best, but I pref the 8agi on my rogue since I play more for assassin than being able to actually take a beating. I'd prolly go 100hp on every single other class for pvp

Honor is competitive with your faction, so long as everyone else is struggling just as much to get HKs it balanced out.

I mean it has nothing to do with the fact that he's the guild leader and every single monkey in olympus will do whatever he asks in a split second because &lt;3 daddy asmon please notice me sempai.
---
Lol I dont think you understand how to farm honor. HoRdE CoNtRoL EvErYtHiNg. So take a 3-5man group and kill every solo farmer in siluthus, ungaro, winterspring ect 5 times you get 20-100 honor per kill. Compared to the 100 horde getting 1 honor per kill sitting in BRM. Your 10 man attacking Kargath gets 20 kills before the 60 horde wake up and whip you we each get 4 honor per kill. Compared to your 250+ from 20 kills. 
---
Why do you think horde go to IF and SW the only place you have groups of alliance that act like a group of horde and make it easy to farm without having to deal with another 30+ horde stealing kill tags and cutting honor by 90%
---

Already looked there, it doesn't say whether it's a one time fee or not.

devilsaur set is better until you get the giantstalker gloves as far as I recall
---
Wow! Just when I thought Retail Infants couldn't pollute the game any further.
---
As a warlock, this sounds like a shit strategy.
---
Its not hard to wait 60 seconds before you start spamming SB's in P1, and its also not hard and far less likely to wipe the raid waiting a short while for the tank to build agro in p3.
---
You should lose dkp for thinking this is a usable strategy
---
Which servers were allowed to transfer to here?
---
But only 1 server is that way and most are horde dominated. I don’t want anyone to be screwed but horde on horde favored servers act like they have it as bad, and they don’t, even on the most alliance favored server because horde at least have zeppelins while alliance have to flag to travel anywhere
---
This is why I rolled pvp, to contest for resources and farm spots vs opposite faction
---
I'm not trying to justify anything he's done wrong, but Asmon has some of the most useful non-bullshit WoW guides out there, granted he stopped doing it many years ago.
---
cant have it both ways, keep on complaining
---
Why would that be an issue? We play classic, and the servers will stay on classic.
---
Offer &amp; Demand. If you don't want to pay 3g, don't. Not sure why people always feel the need to argue over free market. Just say no thanks and move on.
---
I got one of the BREs though so I'm fine till aq40 haha
---
See I’m confused about this. I can still equip mine after dropping engineering but I haven’t tried to hit anyone with it
---
Most enraging for someone who is terminally online and cares far too much about it, or most enraging for normal people?

All fine and true, but then he shouldn't say statistically? Anecdotally, seemingly, from my experience, the expression i've gotten, etc.

This is happening on a ton of servers ATM. The rep grind is fucking absurd and its ruining classic. The bald man and the spazzes on faerlina make easy targets, but there is an underlying issue that rep grinding is a terrible system
---
get good
---
Definitely the biggest WoW streamer back then along with Mitch Jones and stuff but back then "big" streamers weren't getting like, 20-30k viewers a stream it was more like maybe 5k I wanna say? Probably basically what Asmongold is now but back then in terms of popularity I wanna say.
---
But also two completely different people in terms of stream content. Reckful was one of the best players in the world probably when he played (at least one of the best rogues/warriors) and Asmongold is a drama filled, shit player who gets carried lol.
---
the alliance on heartseeker are like the people of terminus from the walking dead.
---
they originally started out peaceful and helpful, but they were tortured endlessly and mercilessly by horde, without the possibility of fighting back, due to the server imbalance on certain servers like stalagg and skeram.  eventually, they realized the true nature of humanity, and it twisted them into hideous beasts.  so when they were finally able to recover and regroup on heartseeker, they exploited their new faction dominance in the way they were taught ruthlessly by the horde over months, but even more fanatically.  the horde on this new server not being the same actual players as their old server is irrelevant.  all horde everywhere are the same foul wretched monsters on their old server constantly ganking them 10 on 1 when they were just trying to harmlessly turn in quests at nesingwarys.
---
someone has to pay for that prolonged injustice.  in this case, everyone.
---
I play both factions. What are you on about?
---
Even if I'll use the gear for raiding too?
---
Comparing MC to AQ is laughable. 
---
It'll get cleared on the first day by people who have spent a decade on pservers, but the comparison is nonsense.
---
Grobbulus
---
There is nothing wrong with using a term in a casual way. Anyone with a modicum of good faith interpretation knows he was not claiming literal statistical study validity. It's just a term describing probability offhandedly. It just seems like a silly thing to harp on.
---
this. however the instruction audio is played at a different rate to how we fight - im assuming its timed, but never looked into it. We wait for tank to build 9k threat before we start in p1.
---
Same. We started on Faerlina and transferred onto Heartseeker when they opened up transfers, the only problem was we were Horde. Easily 80/20 balance by the time they closed transfers if not even worse than that
---
Keep leftovers, make a new guild called Spartans that operates as the alliance’s most elite PvP squad
---
Depends on your class and what you want to do really. Pve guilds dont usually cater to your pvp dreams so a hardcore guild will always expect you to do your best enchant wise.
---
 Since your a hunter, 2x 8 agi is 32 ap and thats even disregarding the crit you get, it's deff not a small amount.
---
If you were alliance that 16 agi becomes almost 18 with kings 100 hp stays 100 hp. Thats something to keep in mind too =)
---
Just a heads up why each person gets 1 is they are unique so you can only have one in youre inventory or on you at one time and ignore the dog demons they dont drop the item youre looking for only the succubus and the big dude demon (dont remember name)
---
That’s not how that works
---
Maybe Blizz should’ve started with more servers and realized that free transfers are going to make faction imbalance even worse than it already was and we all probably wouldn’t have that problem

I’m on about you claiming something isn’t funny when enough people clearly did find it funny enough for it to be the top post from the sub today.
---
Think that's the cheapest, unless you buy a 6 month subscription then you save some monthly.
---
Maybe you were. But it would have been an outlier to the overwhelmingly accepted opinion that streamer servers are bad and they should be avoided held by this subreddit.
---
You make it seem like you were persecuted and now you are proven right. When in reality, no one ever doubted this outcome.
---
Are there any good mage AOE Farming spots for a horde player? Currently level 22
---
K
---
Points in thread still valid?
---
Confirmed from this post: Horde support Brexit
---
Dodge chance from 8 to 6 percent as well i believe
---
Well if you really want to look at the root cause of the problem on Heartseeker it does originate from Horde players. There is an overabundance of Horde on all the other PvP servers so Heartseeker became the Alliance refugee server. If there wasn't so much Horde on the other PvP servers, Heartseeker would not have ended up like this.
---
You are lucky. I am lv 45 and here the dungeons i did
---
Deadmine 2 Times
---
Stockade 1 Time
---
SM GY 1 Time
---
SM Lib 2 Time
---
That it. I have been asking for uldaman over 100 time and i finaly dropped all my quest there.
---
Now that you're on the receiving end it sucks, doesn't it? Isn't it fun?
---
When it was us you all said: "git gud".
---
So ... "Git gud." Be sure to cry in this bucket so I have your tears to regen my mana.
---
Oh.
---
And this all tones down after the 10th when BGs go live. Man, you horde all look big and bad but you're snowflakes at the core. Can't deal with what we dealt with for weeks ... for a few days.... geez. Quit whining.
---
I dont think its gonna be peaceful PvE server. Kitty&lt;Leftovers&gt; and his buddies were already ganging at Felwood today
---
Just stopped to say: Wow, you have an incredible style.
---
For real this is better than most animated shows out there in terms of how polished it looks.
---
I've seen your stuff posted a few times now! Thanks for sharing with everyone!
---
Do higher ranks of Revenge generate more threat?  (Not including the threat from the upgraded damage).
---
For real lol
---
It's less than a day's pay for most people.
---
I didn't say that shit at all.
---
So if all horde are the same as the worst of us, you're all like asmongold?
---
Its not an opinion it is sort of a fact. We were fighting a horde streamer the other day, usually we got wiped as a group of 10 because - obviously - we were always outnumbered, but we still got more honor than them, even though we only killed 4-6 of them and they wiped us.
---
This is brilliant, thank you for your work to make our server a better place. If you wouldn't mind sending me a PM with your info in-game, I could see if any guildmates might be interested in contributing to your efforts. For a cause as good as this I see no issue for some of us to mail in a few of these "care packages" for your distribution.
---
Wouldn’t leave you alone for a whole TWO minutes??? You poor thing... now imagine getting camped the entire 3-4 hours you’re logged in. Including flight master AND major cities. Oh, and that’s every time you log in.
---
That’s hilarious. Look at Heartseeker MC clears on warcraftlogs. There are nearly 100 alliance guilds that have cleared MC, while horde struggles to get to 20. We are INSANELY outnumbered, and the server is slowly dying due to flight paths in every 50+ zone being camped. This makes horde raid log, and thus makes alliance even more bloodthirsty, making for more horde to stop logging in. 
---
When my guild met up in org to do MC over the weekend, there were maybe a dozen other horde around the bank/AH area at 7:30pm server time. With a whole alliance raid just sitting at the flight tower, ready and waiting for anyone who thinks they can simply fly to their capitol city. 
---
It’s not anything but 80/20 or 75/25. It’s hilariously imbalanced.
---
I read that in his voice. Shudder.
---
Can anyone help a brotha out understanding what’s happening? How are they cheating and what is win trading?
---
Who the fuck wants to spend 10 hrs in MC. My guild has been clearing in 2.5 hr and it feels like it takes too long and we make too many mistakes
---
Lmfao if you were “win trading” world PvP kills than you are 100% a fucking peasant.
---
For two minutes is a figure of speech, what you experienced there is exactly my experience as horde when levelling my alt
---
No, I try my best to help people out. I log in with nothing to do because I know people need help in dungeons
---
It's only strong in slacking guilds. If people who have -armor abilities do their job all trash and all bosses have next to no armor the 2nd GCD (you need to apply two sunders, two faeries etc. when fighting giants and such).
---
OEB and Spinal Reaper are both good PvE weapons (SR for orcs due to +axes, on a tauren it's as bad as BRE). BRE and Sulfuras are 95% PvP weapons and will be quickly replaced in PvE raiding.
---
If they aren't offtanking then their job is to dps. If they are fury or fury prot they can do a bunch of damage.
---
But......live to win...
---
Same, someone can get plenty of these things in no time with a little aoe. They do vendor for a decent amount tho so it’s not bad.
---
If you like to pvp 100 hp always
---
There are four items you can you to min max your raid, they aren't necessary by any means..but can certainly help parses. Nerfing two peoples dps to bump the raid is very worth.
---
The Nightfall
---
The Anhilator (I know, I can't brain today)
---
The ARP crystals from un goro (blue/red I think?)
---
The Headmasters Charge on a spriest to buff the locks a bit more. (Stacks with AI and last I used it on a classic sandbox you can swap while retaining the buff)
---
If i had an asshole tank of just stop healing them, I'll find another one.
---
Because it happened to me a couple times means it was just as bad on both sides. Jesus do you hear yourself? Your faction literally had all the major cities and open world on lockdown making it impossible for an entire faction to enjoy the game. Can't believe I actually read this shit post. Enjoy the pve server you've created for yourself
---
Hustle the $15.
---
Just quit the game. We don't need players that constantly cry about the state of pvp on a pvp server. Leave if it's so bad.
---
Maybe your experience differs, but in my experience at least, Skeram and C'Thun are usually the two hardest. Guilds who could get up to twin emps could usually get him the same night if they'd prepared for it but there can be so much chaos on Skeram with polymorphs and interrupts that it's hard to keep under control for non-hardcore guilds.
---
The biggest change was done by blizzard, drastically increasing the server size. The blame solely rests on them for this issue.
---
I have never encountered an asshole tank in classic.  Bad tanks?  Sure.  Undergeared?  That too.  Needing to learn the dungeon?  Definitely.  But I have not seen one ninja drops or be an asshole.  I do not consider selling tanking services in general as an asshole move if the server economy decides to support such options.
---
The shaman would stay resto anyways as the DPS would still be shitty as enhancement shaman. The warrior will keep using OEB in PvE. OEB &gt; Sulfuras in PvE.
---
Both the shaman and the warrior will be using different specs and weapons than Sulfuras.
---
Just yesterday I was thinking back to when I had the actual CD and box for WoW Vanilla. It was so cool to me seeing that art. And exploring the world with my night elf druid was magical. Such amazing nostalgia. Good thing the game still holds up today.
---
Nah, I disagree with that very black and white view. Plenty of shitheads got a transfer out before they closed, and plenty of decent normal players are left being 'punished'. I hope there's transfers at some point, because there's a lot of good people who have a dead server now. If only there was a way to distinguish between the good and the bad.
---
Imagine getting R14 because there are only 71 level 60 and only 5 do pvp...
---
I find all of the button clicking services hilarious as well— so I tried an experiment in Kargath where everyone groups for PvP the other day. Tried to sell thorns and MOTW (jokingly/mockingly) for about 3 minutes and left. I think they got the point 😂.
---
The tone change from first to second sentence gave me whiplash
---
Spending the same amount of time whispering someone asking for money then it would to Rez them.

Some people really can’t make money it’s sad.
---
Will BGs be on Tuesday for EU? or on Wednesday Reset
---
Lol that is pretty funny. Who the tf cares about some jokes. Also, just quit guild instead of game. Idgaf about most of my guildies
---
Don't bother posting on this subreddit. It's alliance dominated
---
I see you in several comment chains acting smug like you know something others don't. Not explaining what it is or why something won't be used just makes you seem like a smug arsehole. No offense intended.
---
True that.
---
&gt; (who cares)
---
This who cares is literally my point.
---
The fact you think it's an insignificant thing is precisely why you are incapable of getting why this is a bad thing. The journey of farming for the gold for your epic mount *is part of the journey.* It's part of the fun, the experience. It's a hurdle to jump over that takes many normal people days or even weeks or months. 
---
He skipped all of that experience. MMO's, and RPG's in general, rely on bonding experiences with your character to keep you around. You need to go through the blood, sweat, and tears to earn where you get for you to have that attachment to your character. When you skip all of that, even for something as 'minor' as a mount, that still cheapens the entire experience and you won't have as much desire to stay or play.
---
That's cool. On my server horde can't be fucked anymore and Alliance tend to control WPL/EPL while horde control BRM. Winterspring appears to be at anyone's discretion.
---
Pickpocketing is fine, but I’ve found the real gold comes from the relic coffers boxes. In addition to the bags of coins and deeds, you’ll get chances at greens and blues. I was able to pay for my epic from the transmute undeath to water recipe that dropped. Just make sure you’re not paying too much for the keys on the AH and it’s a solid way to kill time and make some $$$
---
can sometimes get annual cards for like 90€ on eBay if you look out for them
---
Faction imbalance is the problem, I dont think anyone has ever disputed that. That being said though, most PVP realms (in EU all but one, and im not even sure about the one) are horde dominant, so most people will just attribute this behaviour to horde.
---
Play on a private server just know that there are no guarantees on private servers
---
He will not just take it off as soon as BWL hits; he will not wear Sulfuras to begin with, because OEB is *better* than Sulfuras in PvE.
---
Cant wait for y’all to cry about the aq gates not opening
---
&gt; Found the cheater.
---
I play retail.
---
Playing on Yojamba 40-60 horde favoured. As I horde I can not go to Winterspring or Un’Goro without getting corpse camped at flight master for a solid 30 minutes. 
---
So please all you ally keep on crying how horde makes the game toxic. But believe me after getting out of my corpse runs I will kill every single low level alliance that I come across.
---
Not sure, I know with Windfury it’s different
---
Daaaaum
---
i think i dont understand how assist works
---
Ok, let's say self reinforcing. All I mean by intrinsic motivation is that it's provides positive reinforcement in its own right (without the need for things like honor or gear). Pick whatever word you think represents that.
---
To the Zimbardo bit, I don't think that's the problem with my conclusion - I actually think that's the support of my conclusion. Why would you "act" that way towards your classmates? Why would anyone want to act that way at all? If there wasn't a mix of a) some latent desire to do so that was kept in check by social circumstances, and/or b) an incentive or cue coming from the environment. No one acts that way towards their classmates normally. So why was it ok here?
---
That's the question his study asks. He puts forward a hypothesis (role engulfment), but he hardly rules out all alternatives with scientific rigor. Even if the assumption is that Zimbardo primed that behavior (he seems to have), why did they do it? It clearly didn't take that much encouragement. Not as much as society would expect, anyway. That says something in itself.
---
Which is why I find the study informative as I consider questions like WoW dynamics.

I don't get it.
---
Get the chest from UBRS way better imo.
---
It will be cleared on day 1 by people even if they never played on public private servers *if* they put in enough effort and practice on their own vanilla ptr server.
---
And obviously MC is nothing compared to AQ in terms of boss difficulty, but getting server first MC is more than just clearing the raid, it's about being faster than everone else at leveling and getting the reputation/fire resist beforehand as well.
---
Who cares if it's an act or not.
---
Note this doesn't matter when your crit is very high
---
That's not an excuse for people thinking the problem is horde, which is the case for 90% of posts on here about the issue.
---
Anyone tagged as horde gets immediately shot down for having an opinion. They might be on a pve server, might be on a balanced server, alliance dominated, they might not take part in world pvp, doesnt matter, soon as the horde crest shows next to your comment theres 10 responses  telling you to pipe down.
---
Agi -&gt; crit ratio is super bad for hunters actually. The ap is nice, though. I think it's 50 agi = 1 crit for them. 29 for rogues, 20 for warriors.
---
So it makes it look like he makes sense maybe? Because none of what he said means anything to me.
---
I don't really care about Asmongold, but I did watch his stream once or twice to see what the fuss was all about.
---
What a whiner.  Every time he dies in PvP he cries about stream sniping, and then shits on his own guild for not protecting him, or healing him enough, or not targeting the right players.
---
There is literally something you can do to deter effectiv stream sniping.  Just insert a 30 second delay, and run a discord server that you have a mod curate for in game communication.
---
No, it's everybody else's fault when anything bad happens, and it is always him when ever things go right.
---
How about washing your nails?
---
Probably shouldn’t be playing wow at all if $15 is too much to spare tbh
---
so far they leave some of our levelers, and go ham on lvl 60s (majority of them, minority passes us, /waves and so on) but there have been situations where horde kill levelers and /cry on them, just because they need 15 kills
---
A shaman with HOR and prebis in MC could put up respectable numbers.  He might not top the meters, but who gives a shit.  Having a good weapon is good for a resto shaman to farm with and pvp with.
---
The warrior should be dw any fucking way.
---
Try wiggling the key a little. Always helps with my front door.
---
22 you’re barely able to aoe farm. Maybe southern barrens (geomancers), or Hillsbrad farm with a partner (should hopefully be easier after BGs open)
---
And on the other side Warlocks are suiciding themselves for that one extra Shadowbolt. I pity the healers.
---
-Former Shaman healer.
---
I'm not sure the timing either, but he reminds me to looks for whelps. I usually start casting rank 8 frostbolts once everyone is positioned and that does well for threat until p1 ends.
---
Yeah and then imagine how many people hate asmongold. Propably chasing him around with 5 raids.
---
A quick look at WCL shows it.
---
https://wowclassicpopulation.com/activity?dateFrom=2019-12-01&amp;realm=4732_Heartseeker shows it.
---
Ant other census site has the same.
---
Give PvE a try man, seriously a great time. Come join us on Ashkandi, lots of world PvP as well. I used to be a PvP only kinda guy, but with PvE you can world pvp or just quest whenever you want. Almost as if you get complete freedom in a game you pay money for.
---
So this is more of a long game but... cough up the first initial 15 bucks.
---
Play retail and farm a bunch of gold to buy play time that way and you can essentially play for free at that point.
---
The guy indirectly asked a question, I answered
---
Unless the duel is fair, ie same class, spec, and gear score, you do what you have to do to gain an edge.

 Do you know who is the mayor of Tel Aviv? I bet you don't since you don't give a shit about this topic which is quite alright however if we were discussing a topic that relates to him I'm sure you'd want to be in the loop. So no I don't read about streamers or watch them and what I do know come from thread titles in this sub. It's like you can't comprehend someone not caring enough about a topic to have indepth knowledge of it from the get go. Now you are obviously very upset about it so no need to answer, you got enough problems of your own as we can all see very very clearly.

&gt;The journey of farming for the gold for your epic mount is part of the journey. It's part of the fun, the experience. It's a hurdle to jump over that takes many normal people days or even weeks or months.

For you. Not everyone sees it as a meaningful part of the experience nor the fun.
---
&gt;rely on bonding experiences with your character to keep you around.
---
That is definitely ONE of the things that can be used to keep SOME people interested. Not all. Some want to be the best or the strongest. Some want to beat the hardest part of the game while skipping through all of the "boring" stuff.
---
I'm with you.  I always thought it was pretty obvious when he plays up or down to a situation because it makes for more "interesting" content.  It's not that he's playing a completely different character like Doc or some shit, rather he just extremely exagerrates his own personality.  And now that exagerration has got him into trouble by pissing off the Horde on the server.

I mainly move with my mouse and have my hand set at the 1-4. I figure the 1-4 spells are the ones I use the most with 5-7 being spells I use not as often. 8 and on are ones I don’t use nearly as much such as buffs or long duration/cool down. I am by no means a competitive WOW gamer. Played this growing up and once classic came back I got back in. Hits me right in the nostalgia.

Arena is FFA in the sense that you can see HvH and AvA bouts. You can't, however pair a Dwarf with an Orc as a team for Arena.

I play horde on kurrinaxx and i think its 60/40 in favor of horde but its great as far as pvp and pve environment

Rob people and play till the cops catch you.

Farm on retail to buy subscrip
---
That’s one of the dumbest reddit names I’ve ever seen
---
Got a little excited when I read the Earthfury part, Im on Bigglesworth and its pretty horde heavy and is just all around is not fun to log in. I might do bgs here and there but the rest is pretty uninteresting now. I have a free server hop but I think its to Earthshaker not Earthfury may have to check again. 
---
Literally just went to level alts on Retail for Shadowlands/8.3, "go to retail" etc and then play other more enjoyable games in the meanwhile.
---
Good stuff. Yeah mouse movement makes a lot of sense also. I kinda alternate between the two while playing etc. cool to hear everyone’s styles and that’s basically what I was trying to figure out.
---
As someone who was on Flamelash from day one, a select few Ally guilds were hitting 60 fairly long before Horde, most notably a guild called Venture.  
---
These 'people', and I use that term very loosely, are remnants of rejects from the pserver guild APES and another pserver guild. They were basically kicked out for being complete assholes.  
---
What they did was starting to systematically gank the shit out of every lowbie Horde on the server for hours upon hours on end. My lvl 30 shaman was stuck in STV for 6 hours trying to get anywhere without being MC'd in the wrong direction or just oneshot.  
---
This, as most would suspect, pissed off Horde to no end and once most Horde had hit 60, they just farmed the Allies into the ground for what a select few guilds set off. They now successfully unleashed a rabid beast unto the world.  
---
Venture was the first guild to transfer off of the server pretty much and headed to Earthshaker. I followed them, partly to avoid a dead server but mostly to corpsecamp the shit out of anyone wearing the Venture name.  
---
From what I've heard thus far, the Ally side on Earthshaker are shunning them and Horde are camping them and rightfully so, as they're just a bunch of complete twats if you pardon my french.  
---
I am not saying that they're the only reason, and I agree that eye for an eye will make the whole world blind..  
---
But when you act like that, trying to assume that there won't be any repercussions is delusional. Venture know exactly what they did, on top of doing a ton of botting on the side. They and a select few other guilds definitely exacerbated the issue beyond belief.  
---
Sincerely, a Flamelash refugee on a lowbie shaman.
---
People are leveling alts, so you'll have plenty of people to play with even at low levels.
---
This is what I used to run in battlegrounds hard to kill with last stand and such
---
The alliance dont dominate lol. Horde camp every zone daily. Only the same few alliance groups out everyday. And when they die once they all leave the zone. Ive been wpvping consistently since p2 hit. As far as I know most bigger ally guilds transferred off the realm weeks ago. Most bigger horde guilds have a heavy emphasis on pvp as the main goal with raiding as a means to an end.
---
Or buy it on kinguin sometimes you can find 30day for 10 euro. Or farm gold on retail.
---
No one that knew anything though it would take months.  The debate was if its possible week 1 or if it'll wait till week 2.
---
Layering and the Raid XP error in dungeons helped make it not only week 1 but even earlier in the week.  Without those things it still would have been done week 1 but closer to the wire.
---
Anyone claiming it would take a month would have been retardedly oblivious to Pserver experiences and thus their opinion would have been irrelevant.
---
Is that the Redrum Inc from The Venture Co?
---
Horde 2h fury is actually really good. With slam and proper hamstring spam you can easily go 800-1000DPS. 
---
But this requires Spinal Reaper as orc or OEB as any race. BRE (with good players applying -armor abilities accordingly), HoR, Ashkandi later on are all PvP weapons only.
---
HoR should be up for grabs and a reward for being faithful to the guild.
---
Feels good knowing horde players gonna have to spend money on another acc for subscription and then also know the feeling of getting ganked playing ally all day and getting your corpse camped for hours 😂
---
You got a solid point here.
---
I forgot to mention I’m on a RP server if that makes a difference?
---
Alliance does the same shit on Ally favored servers
---
It's one because most pvp servers are dominated by horde.
---
The problem is imbalance. Horde players are not "worse" than alliance.
---
Thank you! :)

Fucking hell the elitism. Please shush. You get hit by things too. So does everybody. Stop pretending you don't because you are desperate to put somebody down to make yourself feel better.
---
Theyre pretty comparable. I dont understand how they arent. 
---
Theyre both disgusting toxic assholes, the only difference is that asmongold just happens to be entertaining.
---
Well your offtanks probably arent prot to begin with. They're either fury or arms, depending on whether they perform sexual favors for the gm/officers.
---
0/34/17 is pretty standard. Or 31/3/17 if you're one of those people who get away with raiding as arms.
---
Nah check my comment history, there's plenty of people blaming horde and calling me names.
---
Ah yes, all................two of those servers.
---
I'm not an expert warrior, but strength is better than a marginal benefit - it directly increases your threat generation by damage, as well as increasing your chance to parry, which increases your threat and mitigation.
---
Serious question. How do you run dungeons on a dead server. Isn’t it impossible?
---
It was a blizzard site.  But we won't have that this time around just like we don't have the pvp ranking ladder.
---
So does that mean you're all using flask of the titans?
---
&gt; For you. Not everyone sees it as a meaningful part of the experience nor the fun.
---
And yet mysteriously, all those people who don't see it as a meaningful part are telling me about how bored they are and how non-compelled they are to play the game anymore.
---
Odd.
---
You don't get to see what the ratio is when you pick a faction.
---
Sure, if he violates the ToS but notice he doesn't appear in this video. 
---
Being in the same guild doesn't make him responsible for other players' behaviour.
---
How is banning ~15 people a lot of money to blizzard.
---
The word is DEFINITELY
---
Dude, how hard can it be to realize that the problem is the system and not players? There is no inherent psychological attribute to Horde players.
---
Same thing on Stalagg  as alliance man. Theres always 3-4 group of horde camping the house in IF
---
so out of thousands of people online, you get ganked and blame the few dozen afking in IF, the worst part is people like you are so delusional you actually think that horde dont have the same afking either. Its always someone else's fault......
---
You said;
---
&gt; Anyone willing to ally with the undead is also the baddie
---
I said;
---
&gt; The Alliance ally with the undead on dozens of occassions.
---
Therefore by your own logic the Alliance are also the baddies.
---
MaYBe iF thEY oRgaNise GrOuPs oF tHEir OwN.
---
Yes dude, when the balance is so fucked that Ironforge is now a Horde city , you just need to organise more...
---
Only let them transfer out if their honor was below X on the 1st of December, for example. Or, better yet, if their Honor/HK ratio was above X. The people with thousands of HKs but with little honor are the ones who basically caused this.
---
u mad bro?
---
Toxic is when someones being an asshole for no reason. They could be ninja looting, talking shit and throwing insults, they could do more these are just the examples off the top of my head
---
If you're premade you're not just PVPing to pvp, cus you want ranks. Badly designed system makes it so that you are forced to go afk if you want to actually get the gear.
---
multibox bad
---
Roll an alliance rogue on Flamelash, become an assassin.  
---
I've had the same idea.

---
we had a 81 people online peak today, and now we have 40+ people online at 23:00 server time :)
---
Show me a post of yours from 2-3 weeks ago defending us when we were the receiving end.
---
Sucks when its happening to you. Doesn't it.
---
BGS come out in a couple days. Deal with it. We dealt with it for weeks.
---
Now you know how it felt to us.
---
&gt; Comparing MC to AQ is laughable.
---
People legitimately pretending that WOW is remotely challenging is laughable
---
"THIS time it's gonna be REAL hard! I'm not lying like I did the last several times"
---
I know right! Playing on 40-60 horde favoured server and while yes generally speaking there are more horde out in the world, as a horde player we can not access winterspring or un’goro since the flight masters are getting camped by ally 24/7. 
---
Then they have the audacity to cry how horde players are toxic. 
---
I’m not complaining I know it’s part of the game. It’s just rich to complain when you do the same thing that you complain about.
---
Tbf, with the amount of Alliance posts whining about horde on this sub it's more the other way around.
---
I mean, horde players on larger realms are part of the reason there IS this problem on Heartseeker in the first place...given their actions on these larger servers, and their utter refusal to transfer. Considering the smaller size of Heartseeker it would only take a small number of horde transfers to fix the faction imbalance but the vast, vast majority won't even entertain the thought. They even try to dissuade others on discord/forums/reddit.
---
One day, they may play on a server on the losing side, and understand their misbehaviour.
---
Because it's not the players' job to guard transport nodes. Same reason Menethil Harbor is being harrassed 24/7 by Horde rogues.
---
Ahh loot comp! I could see if the leader is already a tank warrior who knows the game well would not want another warrior so that player could hog the warrior loot. See i tanked in mara and would let all warriors welcome to need with me on the blackstone ring doing princess runs bc i would be a huge dick only doing princess runs for myself not letting other classic who would need it to join.
---
R1G Rolls 2 (1-1854)
---
What's the rendition of that meme called? Makes me chuckle every time I see it.
---
well usually we just let people find groups on themselves, and some of them do find groups for dungeons, other times our lvl 60s boost them through dungeons or help them with lets say attunements, or just basically bodyguard.
---
Get out of the chat, Mom.
---
to get r14 we will have to work super hard, not sure if we will be able to, but time will tell.
---
Classic's biggest problem was the idea of vanilla which has propagated for years.  Hell I even remember DURING vanilla how much people bitched BGs killed world pvp!  In BC people bitched about how arenas and shit are worse the the honor.  Well maybe arenas were shit, but the honor system was trash too.  For years I listened to people talk about how great vanilla pvp was, or how great world pvp was.  I played during vanilla.  I never experienced this great pvp halcyon all these other people experienced.  It existed.  I remember ganking people from time to time, I remember being ganked.  I remember TM/SS wars, and I also remember those getting boring fast and moving on.
---
People remembered the specific fun times they had, and forgot the parts they didn't like.  They forgot the parts they avoided.  The game they were expecting, wasn't something that even really existed.  For better or worse, classic is a relatively good representation of what vanilla was as a game.  The primary differences involve how the players behave in general.  This is why people are pointing to ANYTHING they can blame because in their mind vanilla was glorious and perfect.  If classic isn't glorious and wonderful, it's because classic was ruined by Blizzrd..
---
Wouldn't this classify as mutual aid?
---
Yh that could be the case too. The warrior tank could actually be fury spec but it's his only easy ticket to get dungeons and loot up.
---
This reply is toxic.
---
They reap what they sow. The jokes basically on them how long before they’re crying that they’re on a dead server.
---
18 whole times? That must be so hard for you rogues.
---
Sure but you have to play horde or you'll get griefed so hard you'll struggle making it to 60.
---
They aren't playing for excitement all the time? Could be playing for the sense of progression, to be social while doing something else or to relax.. there are lots of ways to play classic, that's why it was so popular in the first place.
---
Imagine giving someone an ultimatum and then being surprised when they decide you are worth less then one of the main raiders.
---
People are the same, doesn’t matter if blue or red lol. Everyone mad when I kill level 48+ characters but if I let them live, and a 60 shows up, be sure they are the first to join the fight. It just goes both ways.
---
What is the best fury warrior spell rotation for max dps at lvl 60?
---
Dude, feel the room. It’s called „sarcasm“
---
Maybe there’s more Horde players because no one wants to be a part of your shitty faction :(
---
Did you just make that up?
---
This. Horde are the Warcraft badguys and want to look like the goodguys on Reddit. This is an all immigrated alliance-tired-of-the-shit-server.
---
I use ~ for interrupt and my 5 dismounts me, my 1 is purge w/ startattack, numpad + is lightning shield, numpad - and * are ghost wolf/mount. Got grounding/tremor on my extra mouse buttons. What do you think I should change/add? Been meaning to bind my potions and bandages, haven't found a comfy place for them. Also thank you for watching !
---
Pretty good.
---
Some random tips.
---
Against casters you should stay in Berserk stance (pummel, b Rage). Vs. Melee stay in Battle, for overpower. Stance dance for intercept/disarm. For wpvp you don't really need improved hamstring, you should spend talents in improved charge+2h damage instead. Don't forget to shoot your ranged weapon whilst immobilised (frost nova etc. ). Use Fear Shout to interrupt spellcasting, bandage in meantime, get ready to charge when combat ends. As fast as stats, prioritise Stamina, Crit, Str in that order.  There's usually better way to spend Rage than on Whirlwind. When charging in a bigger group of enemies you should use Thunder clap to tap as many as u can. (I. e. receive honor when enemies die), this applies when you are playing solo.
---
Blizzard has never explicitly stated the respawn timers.  From my experience, the respawn was around 3-6 days after being killed.  There is an issue where a server restart would usually set a new timer which within about 18 hours.  This is all based on my experience and not meant to be definitive.
---
"Toxic" *probably* means *me?*
---
Oh. Ok.
---
I suspect every serious raider in &lt;ONSLAUGHT&gt; has at least one extra alt account (and possibly two or more), even before considering AQ. Definitely not a big deal for most of them.
---
Thanks
---
I honestly find that very difficult to believe - have you been to WPL, EPL, Searing Gorge, BRM, Burning Steppes, Menethil, Southshore or Dire Maul? All of these places are either camped 24/7 by horde ganksquads or subject to very frequent raids. Only place I've seen alliance roaming is WPL but for maybe an hour at a time before horde organise an undercity-based raid. 
---
You must have been travelling somewhere very unusual to be picked off by alliance, because Stonespine feels like it's 70-80% horde (judging from the alliance population in the major cities compared with the server population)
---
Stonespine is by no means equivalent to Flamelash but complaining about being killed by alliance when you can /who and fill the 50 player list for horde in the Burning Steppes is really ignoring the elephant in the room...
---
It always matters. You can't get 100% Flurry uptime unless you actually have 100% crit. Even at 99% crit, there is a chance (however small) that you can get multiple swings in a row that don't crit and lose your Flurry.
---
Horde:  blame the devs or git gud lmao
---
Also Horde:  They do it too!
---
Edit
---
Devs:  If only you guys had the free wil to play the way you want. Sorry we forced you to murder an entire server.
---
I’ll be pretty surprised if Faerlina is noticeably affected even if all the streamers and their entourage leave. It’s a pretty busy server.
---
Money is probably the least sad part of what I meant when I said "too committed".
---
I think Alex Jones is significantly more well-known than Asmongold, given that he ends up in the actual (i.e. real-world) news on a fairly regular basis. 
---
Well done on your extensive knowledge of people who play WoW all day on webcam, though, I'm sure it'll take you far.
---
I think you should change the name of this subreddit to r/alliancecrycave, time to leave this sub it was good but now is full of "alliance good horde bad"
---
I mean,  what do you expect when you're at war? I've been ganked like a thousand times by now.  I think the pvp server world pvp is really immersive considering you're part of the frontline of 2 nations at war.  If peeps don't like it just don't play on a pvp server?
---
How do you get corpse camped in a major city, just unflag.
---
Pool size is irrelevant outside of extremely small or large outliers when it comes to imbalance.
---
Neither of which the current classic wow population is.
---
If theres 1 mil of players and the stats are 55-45, that still leave 50k horde players forced to wait until a bg ends to join into a new one
---
Toxic is like doing all the troll things but being an even bigger dick about it.
---
Why is that? Are alliance players that toxic?
---
40% uptime on 4ppm because SoR +JoC doubles the proc rate.
---
Putting it on an OT isn't the best either, they contribute less than a ret paladin on sheer personal dps numbers + utility. Let your OT keep their role as the OT and pick up adds, give your ret something to do.
---
Hunter/warrior have similar uptime on NF as ret, but ret doubles proc chances because of SoR while losing the least out of the 3 for personal dps. It's easy math dude.
---
Ret paladins do more than 150 dps, but no idea why you're arguing when logs exist. A spelladin will easily do 800+ dps with NF once they get 5pc T2, scrolls (increases uptime btw), the HoJ interaction with start/stop attack to give you 3x attacks instead of 2x attacks.
---
BTW, I play holy in raid, so memeing on how I'm just a ret paladin justifying my spot is kind of useless.
---
The easiest way to determine who NF is best on is to look at uptime, personal dps loss, and raid-wide dps gain. If your hunter goes from 800 dps to 100 dps (theoretically), your casters need to get 700 dps benefit from NF. If your spell-ret loses 50 dps because they can't use MCP and goes from 600-550 dps, your hunter is not losing out on 700 dps, and your casters can easily make up the 50 dps difference from the spell-ret.
---
Arguing that a ret can't be in your raid... all raids can be completed with 39 people instead of 40. There is no downside to having that last spot as a ret paladin.
---
Asmongold isn't anywhere in the video.
---
Even in the burning crusade c’thun still remained a slightly challenging fight at 70. We cleared it a few times with a group of 20-30ish, but it wasn’t a pushover like the rest of the dungeon.
---
Don't believe everything Punkrat and others tell you dude. If it seems you do more gold herbing by all means go herb. 
---
Tip: Farmlog add-on helps with that so you know exactly how much your farm was worth.
---
Warriors ARE the top DPS class in the game...  
---
At level 60 when they actually have the gear. At every other stage of the game before they start getting their raid gear, hit cap, etc..., their DPS is, unfortunately, almost always going to be lower than that of a Mage, who even without spellpower, has high base damage.  
---
The math isn't exact on this (not even close), but think of Warrior DPS as like Y = X + 1.75Z + 10 (where X is their level, and Z is a variable based on their gear), and Mage DPS as like Y = 1.75X + Z + 50. The difference here, is that whereas Mage scale very well with levels, Warriors scale much better with gear, and because gear keeps getting better, especially in to BWL, AQ, etc..., Warriors outstrip Mages when that time comes.
---
Man this sounds so fun. I’m in Faerlina right now and I had a dedicated raid group but rolling an alt on Bene seems like a great idea. Definitely will keep the server in mind
---
As mind numbingly stupid these posts are theres always one guy in comments that out does the post.
---
The guilds in question will just be using alt accounts and won’t need to transfer anywhere. The only belly up status move would be Blizzard changing the items required for turn ins, which they seemed very against during their AMA pre-release.
---
Nice video, nice thumbnail, I dig it 👏
---
I see office i upvote
---
Faction imbalance is the primary reason for this, however weighing that horde have the best racials for PVP the majority of the time its horde doing this sort of stuff.
---
Farm gold in BFA and use WoW Tokens
---
DW fury, get plate and don't tank in leather, go for crit. Do lots of damage.
---
For clarification, the heroic strike bug in raid isn’t really a factor.
---
Warriors have tons of rage in MC and especially on boss fights. Those heroic strikes you queue and would cancel, should be going through due to having to rage dump.
---
It’s not as game breaking as people make it out to be.
---
With other people I will disrespectfully disagree but saying that you're unable to quest at 50 as a horde on Stonespine is complete bullshit, unless you mean on account of all the other hundreds of horde players already having killed all the mobs...
---
On Skeram? It’s nowhere near as active as Horde, but it’s absolutely not dead.
---
AB
---
Gold is totally worthless. I'm sitting on nearly 1k extra and have no need for it and still loving to play.
---
Yes, ressing someone also takes time, wheres the difference?
---
Simply the phase. Update atlas regulary because its showing wrong numbers sometimes because things tend to get released earlier
---
why are the alliance so under populated?
---
If you’re talking about bindings you shouldn’t encourage having backpeddle bound on an easy key press, that shits novice as.
---
I've raided with people like you. It's about 75% you guys cause her to turn and fire breath the entire raid.
---
Sorry for not answer your question But is BG’s coming 10th for EU too or do We need to wait on 11th?
---
Theres a post on the front page right now with alliance camping Ogrimmar. Get some fucking perspective guys. This isnt horde problem, this is a server balance problem.
---
Try to convince the burial services that they charged 15$ more than they should.
---
Srsly now, try to focus on more important things if  you can't afford 15$. I hope things get better.
---
Gotta love boomers taking pictures of their screen with their phone instead of doing a screenshot
---
So it just means "being mean", but that wasn't threatening enough, so the feelings-police had to invent a new word to chastise people with?
---
Just to add a couple points to this. If you really want to push the GPH into something decent you need a TON of vault keys. Which will cost between 25s-40s/ea and time gathering those keys (spamming for COD's, watching AH, etc)
---
And depending on how you play, you will almost always need to respec to get the most out of the runs.
---
Also. /u/esoterikk you can still kill plugger (the guy you sell too in the bar) in just about any spec.
---
How to do it:
---
- Buy 4 beers from plugger (you should only ever need to spend this money once)
---
- Go to the wall next to plugger, right before the thorium brotherhood enclave area. There's a table right there.
---
- Throw beers at the wall one at a time. Wait each time for one of the patrons around plugger to walk over and drink it. These are safe to kill at that point.
---
- Once all patrons around plugger are dead. Pickpocket him for the key and then start a fight. 
---
- You will now run into the corner where the thorium brotherhood guy is. Pop your cooldowns here. Everytime he does his shadow bolt(?) or incinerate, run around the corner and LOS him. They won't hit you that way, and it also gives you a second to bandage if you need the small boost.
---
- Once plugger is dead, loot him and grab the beers from the table next to him so you don't have to buy them again! 
---
- Once done immediately go to the back door where phalanx stands in front of and open the door with the key you pickpocketed off of plugger. 
---
You can get an extra 4-6g a run easily doing this from the plugger drops + the extra loot from the 4 patrons. And with a little practice it's very fast.
---
If you do the window skip before Angerforge instead of turning the wheel the door to the exit won't be closed and you can make your escape that way. You just need to drop down next to the fire elementals after you open the door in the back of the bar. Which will also give you extra easy pickpockets from the groups of 5 in from that huge hallway.
---
It will be really bad for both sides if he leaves. A lot of horse players don’t realize that.
---
Yeah, that's why I was saying that making alt accounts is their best option. Posting it to the cross-faction AH for cheap and hoping that the Ally turn it in would be a bad move.
---
&gt; Edit: I ask this all the time and there has never been a response from the person using the term. It's like "toxic" is just something people mindlessly throw out there as a condemnation, but it doesn't mean shit.
---
Because you're trolling. Go google it, you're presumably a capable individual with knowledge of urban dictionary.
---
BRE is fine on a fury warrior using Thrash and Mirahs, but with Dal’Rends and brutality and viskag it gets heavily out dps’d. The proc is overshadowed by the fact that you’ll have a whole raid who will lower the bosses armor to 0 in the first place.
---
Well, its possible.. but why dont you go and find out yourself? You'll get killed very often from allies.
---
how dare you be against the hive mind opinion on multiboxing, oof
---
10
---
The alternative to ressing someone is corpsewalking.
---
Im not saying you should charge for ressing, just saying its wierd everyone loses their minds about asking money for a ress when you assume its normal to pay a mage for watef
---
WSG so I can fight in the middle. I just want to fight some horde in roughly equal numbers and not 8v1.
---
Ab is most fun for me. I hate pve av and 3cap premade wsg
---
Yeah I remember the first boss in BWL. That was another world, pure chaos. If anyone was failing in your group you instantly noticed.
---
Heartseeker opened up for transfers with only horde dominated servers as source servers.  The fact that a ton of alliance left their servers (and thus made the source server even more imbalanced) should tell you all you need to know about these guys.  
---
Spoiler, they weren't looking for a balanced server.
---
One of his guild's officers was
---
&gt;Maybe they just want a 1v1?
---
I've yet to see that happen in wpvp. If people want 1v1s they can go duel outside of IF or something.
---
&gt;Don‘t try to carebear everyone and also don’t expect to get carebeared by everybody that runs by casually.
---
But I picked PvP server to wpvp. And I do expect my team to help out if I am being murdered right in front of them, just imagine you are doing a quest and then the guy next to you just get fucked completley by a rogue. 
---
In almost all situations aiding the player getting shit on is the rational thing to do, otherwise you will be next.
---
Thinking about rerolling on Mirage Raceway (Eu - PvE) since the fractions seems to be better balanced than on my main realm (Nethergarde Keep ,Eu - PvE, 70:30 ratio Alliance favored) and according to ironforge,pro it has \~1000 more active players. Yeah I know, fraction balance doesn't seem to be important for PvE servers since there is little world PvP, but I'd like to see more than 1 Horde player amid dozens of alliance players while questing/grinding.
---
Would that be worth it though?
---
Lol
---
Don't. All the guides and such are based off private servers where the gold per hour from pickpocketing was *way* higher. Pickpocketing is a nice thing to do as you level/play to get extra gold and level lockpicking but if you think you'll make serious gold from it you're wrong.
---
Having herbalism or mining will net you far more, as will basically any other gold farm. Team up with a druid and do tributes or whatever else.
---
If you absolutely must do those runs, combine it with coffer runs as well and you'll make.. "some" gold. It won't be great but it is decent enough if you're on a PvP server and don't want to do an open world farm.
---
Good. Needs more close ups of biceps imo
---
Yeah.. I'd be surprised if 2% of players zoned into a raid in vanilla..
---
Top Top guilds are going to use 25 or so warriors and punch through raids that way.
---
My guild isn’t a top guild, we are extremely laid back, but we optimize where we can. For example, giving people who can use it a Nightfall to raid with to Boise raid damage.
---
&gt; You also usually build 2-3 per guild so the uptime is around 45 seconds every minute.
---
When the person that wields it is a net negative then multiplying makes it worse. But it is propably a plus since pservers seem to like the weapon.
---
I'm Horde Incendius, and it's definitely a Horde favored server, last number I saw was 58/42. Easy way to tell is that Tuesday BRM is completely Horde controlled, to the point that I've been wondering if Alli just stopped raiding on Tuesdays. 
---
But what the Alli lack in numbers they make up for in tenacity and motivation, the fact they've run EPL, DM entrance, etc many times lately makes me believe that the Horde had more of the casual fanbase (myself included honestly) and if you're Horde out in the world, you better be partied up 5+ because the Alliance are and they're hunting.
---
yeah i get that from my blessings
---
With wf it’s even with DW if you play right. I’m the top dps in my guild with Arc reaper and only 2 purples...
---
Been raidlogging since 3rd week of September. Don’t see that changing anytime in the next year.
---
Damn you fucking go off on people in football threads eh?
---
You'd be surprised the number of them who don't level lockpicking. 
---
That said as a long time rogue once keyrings are out I'll be getting them all. Higher level locks like strath/scholo/etc all have a chance to fail even with 300 lockpicking so it's worth having the keys.
---
Yes, in a game... played on the internet... what?
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_that_proves_the_rule
---
This would only be unpopular because most of this sub was too stupid to realize this would happen
---
**Exception that proves the rule**
---
"The exception that proves the rule" (sometimes "the exception proves the rule") is a saying whose meaning is contested. Henry Watson Fowler's Modern English Usage identifies five ways in which the phrase has been used,  and each use makes some sort of reference to the role that a particular case or event takes in relation to a more general rule.
---
Two original meanings of the phrase are usually cited. The first, preferred by Fowler, is that the presence of an exception applying to a specific case establishes ("proves") that a general rule exists.
---
I would except there's only a handful of flight paths I can even go to as alliance without getting instantly killed
---
If you're serious about needing a definition, toxic is more than just being mean or abusive.  Its being those things to the point that it starts to have lasting effects on those around you and the community. 
---
An example is myself playing sports.  I get very competetive and have a low tolerance for bad players.  I had to actively step away because of my behaviour making it not fun for my teammates.  The toxicity seeps into the other players and they stop having fun and dont want to play anymore.  Just being mean once or twice wont have that effect.
---
Ok, you've proven me wrong, and that's why I asked.
---
Sorry.
---
There's a decent person on Horde. If I knew your IGN I'd add to my nicelist on the addons I use.
---
Yea asmongold is definition of scumbag. Tuned into his stream as he was doing onyxia and when it got to looting the bag, he calls for rolls and as rolls are still coming in, he loots it to himself and then tries to play it off like a mistake. Like buddy I know you look stupid as shit but you ain't that stupid.
---
Because it tends to be hordies predictably dismissing people and telling them to shut up and coming out with the "you chose to roll on a PvP" server and "reroll on a PvE" server responses. 
---
It tends to be this way because those players haven't had their game ruined because they are on the dominant faction and lack empathy with others.
---
You're kind of missing the point. It's not that fury/prot isn't good, it's that it lacks tactical mastery and exchanges lower survivability and aoe threat for greater sustained single target threat. Its opener threat on pull is worse if you dont have very high rage already.
---
It does one thing well, and that's keeping single target threat against extreme dps. Absent extreme dps from your raid, there is no upsides to it.
---
Statistically it's actually pretty decent assuming you like taladrils lists. That said it's not noticeably better than something like Vigilance Charm
---
Not getting the Neck is a huge mistake though, it's so insanely good for threat and you'll wear it consistently for a long time
---
10million dollars of irrelevant (his net worth) and has been brought up in relation to the white house.
---
I find it interesting.  Originally I thought the game would spike in popularity, then people would leave, turned off by the grind.  I was surprised that everyone seemed compelled by it, and it resonated with large group of my friends.  I assumed that nostalgia would be the main draw, but then people liked the change of pace and immersion the game presented.
---
I know quite a few people that didn't make it to 60, I think they got frustrated with their classes and didn't feel like the investment in an alt was worth their time.  Or they got ganked too many times.
---
Then phase 2 came out, and their fate was sealed.  People killing time leveling alts, or those that hadn't hit 60 were immediately turned off.  They've played since launch on PvP servers, and were disgusted with the corpse camping.  The few remaining people left with a clear disdain for classic that I'm sure they won't be back.
---
Blizzard is trying to stretch out this content far too long, it needs to be accelerated dramatically to maintain interest.
---
a couple alts to level 35 (and eventually 60) really opens up the world of grindcraft,
---
why buy things when you can make it in house from the ground up? worked for the steel barons
---
&gt; Probably shouldn’t be playing wow at all if $15 is too much to spare tbh
---
If you play EU as US, you save .70 cents. It might not be a lot, but it can add up.
---
Non mmo Mouse user here, I only used 1-4 keys on my paladin, 2 side buttons on my death adder and clicked everything else. Raided serious as ret in mists and legion, got a few 100's on logs and almost always over 95. My brother is a mouse user aswell and we are always in the top dps on logs for our classes and gear. I know you didn't mean it in a bad way and just curious just answering you from my perspective.

I like how you want the individual in a computer game to think about the greater good of a server? How is that not the job of the developers lol?
---
What would you suggest? stop all world pvp? How about the people who only play the game for world pvp? Its hardly their fault blizzards server caps scewed up the experience.
---
I’ll throw in my experience being on Faerlina and in Olympus. I never joined the guild to play with Asmon. I’ve been a fan but I just wanted a large community to be a part of. Like others have said, Asmon made some big claims before p2 that we were going to run the server and not allow horde to play the game. It did not go that way. This turned into him being camped constantly on stream and him saying that his stream was no longer fun for him or his viewers. The horde have a slight majority on the server but most often control important alliance flight points. We do fight back and win about half of the time but once the horde see our Olympus guild tag, it turns into getting camped by hunting parties. Asmon doesn’t lead Olympus at all. When he is on off stream, he’s in one of the few pvp groups we have in the guild or he’s with another streamer. Olympus does have people who want to pvp but most do not participate. Now asmon wants to move to a pve server which will cause a lot of people to move with him and could cripple the alliance. The horde don’t realize how bad this is for both sides and this could cause the server to be on the verge of dying. 
---
The whole server is full of stupid drama and a lot of people stopped playing hoping that BG’s will fix it. Olympus merged all of their guilds and condensed them into two max level guilds and a leveling guild. None of which are full. We see about 130 people online during peak hours. Swifty also left the server already. If other streamers leave, the server will essentially become pve for horde.
---
People instantly responding with hostility and mocking when someone voices displeasure with a video game, or trying to dismiss them and telling them to shut up aren't nice people either.
---
Meanwhile at Camp Mojache bridge...
---
Wasnt this only introduced in wotlk?
---
How can you get a morph?
---
Lol, blame horde for leaving your og server, then doing the exact thing to the horde on Heartseeker that made you leave. 
---
I don't mind the alliance for the most part, the only time I get really tilted is when 9+ Ally are camping the quintessence spawn on Tuesday.
---
There's quite a few of us. All of our assholes are camping searing gorge.
---
That one guy alone in winterspring you're corpse camping out of revenge? He's probably only ever taken honorable fights, and despite being camped over and over again, knows that he'd just be continuing the cycle by seeking revenge by taking it out on other people *but he's got your name and will take it out on you*.
---
So make sure you also write down the names of people you corpse camped and see if they do it to you later.
---
They might not be random horde, they might be your previous victims.
---
Is it bad I don't even remember the name of my guild in destromath? I can recall CSM but not my own guild...
---
I remember our guild was pushing naxx, I remember 4H but thats about it.
---
How is he being a toxic douche?
---
And yes, all world pvpers are sociopaths, got it!
---
Or just play on an PvE server. Would deeply recommend PvE for the ability to play at your own terms.
---
Its no surprise the wow subs are mostly alliance players. We leave the subs just like alliance players leave servers. Not fun to get dogpiled
---
With Severance and Might of Menethil being around, pretty much no warrior would go for Ashbringer.  
---
On top of that, as previously said, absolute majority of warriors making it to 4H and downing them were dual wield.
---
Well for most of us, reallife sucks and has no meaning so WoW is a substitute for it.
---
You’re the only one who looks foolish here. Dude asked a question and you got triggered lmao.
---
I belive people just can't accept that they were bad at the game a few years ago, or that idk, almost 20 year old mechanics are not the cutting edge of raiding nowdays... The skill ceiling is just completly different, and just a hint classic does not require the best players.
---
You are probably right... it just seem to me that theres alot of allies running around and ganking. I haven't played as alliance, so i dont know how bad it really is.
---
Believe what you want.
---
      
---
I've been killed in alliance raids on camp mojache and kargath. Tanaris seemed pretty even in terms of which side was ganking. Actually died multiple times there today including inside the Gadget walls from ally 60s blasting people. Died several times to an ally lvl 60 gank group in searing gorge yesterday.
---
       
---
Not disputing you have been hammered by horde as well but its definitely not one sided from my point of view
---
yeah, if you play high mythic+ regularly right now then classic is a piss take in terms of comparable difficulty. The average curve has been almost always higher with every expansion save few exceptions, purely from an objective level.
---
How does picking a race that gives you a pvp advantage make you a "bad person"?
---
Actually useful to not messup the AI when tanking.
---
I didn't literally mean 100.
---
Av, when the lotus starts to bloom you know its been a while
---
Good to know, thank you! :)
---
Is his name Killerduki?
---
Orange to purple is practically always 6 shrooms, though it will usually take 35-40 mins depending on how fast you are. Collected a few hundred shrooms and have not been able to break 6 minutes even with skull/stopwatch/sprint
---
You still get travel form at lvl 20 and its more powerfull than cheetah , also you finish feline swiftness talents at lvl 21 or 22
---
Yeah, very high pop PvP server
---
no, most normal people play both or alliance mainly.  it's the diehard horde that sustain the 'faction war'
---
Can druids shift while sheeped to get out of it or can they only shift during the poly cast?
---
But this isn’t Horde camping Alliance cities! It won’t get upvotes!
---
^ idiot. Just find a balanced server...
---
It grows on you
---
That’s why i said on an easy press, but realistically everything you can do with strafe while tanking.
---
Because you are toxic. You just proved his point. You are throwing a tantrum and then choosing to take it out on people who did nothing to you to make yourself feel better.
---
I disagree. Or do I? I don't really know.
---
You're just too generous
---
Really bizarre how people are always calling a weird racist reddit athiest toxic huh
---
Just a shocking mystery
---
I'll never not watch this entire video.
---
Why are you being so defensive?
---
Only post worth reading in this thread
---
It's 15 dollars a month with no upfront cost. Not exactly breaking the bank to have 2 accounts.
---
No you havent, you're lying.
---
You know how I know you're being untruthful? That enchant isn't available yet. Stop bullshitting.
---
Wrong. You can absolutely shift out of sheep. Assuming you have the mana to do so.
---
No, what's the story?
---
As a slightly controversial aside, WoW would be a much better  game without the PTR. I'd rather new content was buggy, unbalanced and likely to be patched if only it was new, unknown and exciting.
---
I mean.. 15% spell damage when fire mages start rolling hard and warlocks start scaling is massive.
---
You don't need to make fake articles, real articles are starting to come out.
---
https://www.latlmes.com/tech/blizzard-ent-shares-concerns-over-faction-imbalance-in-its-world-of-warcraft-reboot-1
---
I think that's part of it. They remember it being difficult for *them*, and they assume the game is easier now just because they're better at it. So they think all these retail kids are gonna have a breakdown when they have to play the brutal retail they remember. In reality they just google a build and rotation and off they go.
---
The other side is that a lot of people learned a ton about the game since vanilla and were telling themselves that, this time, *they* were gonna be the pro that everyone looked up to. But everyone else got better at the game too. So if you're comparing yourself to others, it's just really frustrating, because it seems like you haven't made progress.
---
Lmao my bad I play alliance on classic I'm sure I remember there being a zep up there at some point
---
So alliance are incessant, neurotic whiners?
---
Hunter is only good on horde thanks to berserking.
---
Best combo is.
---
Nightfall on ret AND off Tank.
---
Ofttank also twist annihilatior into the mix with one other dd
---
Being an asshole or an idiot is not exclusive to Horde or Alliance.
---
This is not news.
---
You should thank them. Maybe they'll install plumbing in their newly acquired cities.
---
I don’t Rez a lot of people, it’s 10 sec cast, 1400 mana and then you have to drink again, also a lot of cunts don’t thank you for Rez, I driveby heal people pulling mobs tho maybe I should charge to cure diseases off people in plaguelands.
---
Kill alliance players :) they are assassins of SI:7 sent to bring van cleefs head to the lapdogs of the monarchy.
---
Or you know..... some people play the game the way they want to? I play for the gear, and to be better than others. Take your sob storie home. It's a videogame. I dont need more "friends", im doing fine IRL. So i can play this video game the way i want. Stop projecting like humanity is lost cuase they honor trade in a video game. And i would rather have a thunderfury than not. Cause you know, its a game. And i play it to get stuff.
---
I’ve literally never been hit by it, it’s one of the easiest mechanics in MMO history
---
Yeah there's usually 3-5 rogues stealthing around UC courtyard, usually with a bait mage right around them to try to get 2-3 Horde to PVP flag themselves so the Rogues can clean up. It's become so commonplace that it's kind of stopped working, rarely see any corpses there anymore because everyone just runs past the bait knowing what's going to happen.
---
I dunno, but now I know something about you.
---
Ptsd as a horde warlock on broodlord lashlayer and drakes triggered
---
Sounds like you need to take some personal responsibility lil buddy
---
You say no affiliation for asmongold reacts when in reality, if he isn’t being copy striked he is probably in an agreement with Asmon himself.
---
Fuming because your print screen button broke and you had to do a manual "screenshot" which makes you look like a computer imbecile?
---
The golden ratio imo is
---
Ofttank and ret paladin nightfall
---
Offtank twisting annihilator
---
1 dd with annihilator
---
11 days played time, AOE farmed dungeons from L30 seemed to take forever but you make alot of gold doing it.
---
Yes you're right.  Sorry about that.
---
He was probably just so mad that he smash his keyboard and could only take a picture with his phone
---
Have you ever heard of Ultima Online? If you allow players to perform this type of behavior through game mechanics, they will do it. This has been shown repeatedly in MMORPG history.
---
At least we dont lack reading comprehension.
---
np :^)
---
There’s no right answer to this, neither side can make an argument to appease the other. People need to come to terms with the fact that WPVP isn’t about fair fights, it’s about farming honor. As long as you’re worth honor, you’re getting killed. 
---
It seems the alliance on most servers aren’t as PvP-inclined as horde players and have started quitting in troves because of it. I’d be interested to see if there is a connection between current “streaming culture” and people no-lifing the game. I know at least 10-15 people who manage to play classic for up to 10 hours a day, everyday and I don’t understand how. 
---
I’m still having a lot of fun, but have come to realize that 50-60 will take me a good amount of time.
---
see my other videos intros, plenty of close ups and flexes
---
I want some rewards from all three of them, but I must admit that I like AV best. Not only are there stuff to do for those of us that aren't pvp gods, but also my lack of pvp skills feels like less of a burden in a 40 man group than in a 10 or 15 one.
---
&gt; Nothing like this ever happened though. It went from 70-30 to 99-1 in 3 days.
---
This exact thing happened to my server in retail wrath.  Server was overpop, around 60/40 ratio and had big queues just after wrath launch.  2-3 weeks in they put up free transfers.  A few days later 3 of the biggest alliance guilds transferred, and that caused a cascade whereby 90% of alliance left within 2 days.  
---
And we weren't the only server this happened to in retail.
---
What happened here was nothing new I'm afraid.  Blizzard doesn't give a shit.
---
Won't the elemental invasion help lower them or at least keep them steady?
---
Whoa, *racist*?
---
That doesn't seem like much, really.
---
Oh look another horde player.
---
Listen mate, i played on pvp servers in vanilla and it was nothing like the shitshow we have today
---
And SW is even worse because less ally are there
---
I mean... Imma go make me a Flamelash ally character now (Horde Priest on Earthshaker).
---
Rightouness for a 100% increase (3.6=1.8 for 1 hit) / crusader =3.6*0.6= 2.16.
---
This means righttouness is better by 0.36sec or 20% over crusader
---
What else you need to do is:
---
You switch to command rank X (depending mana) and judge it on cooldown.
---
Command judge can also Proc nightfall.
---
Rightouness judgement can't proc nightfalll
---
I'm just glad I am not the kind of person into nostalgia, that shit rots your fucking brain lol
---
Maybe, but you need air elementals all the time to do that
---
With the way they've handled other things, I'd be really surprised if the devs didn't interfere and speed things up.
---
Assuming people are “just shit” is an equally stupid conclusion for you to jump to.
---
Scroll down is Switch between Battle/Def. Key C is for Berserk. I use scroll up for Sunder.
---
get this low life outta here
---
It's just nostalgia and cognitive dissonance my friend. Nothing more, for the most part at least.
---
Every time you get ganked, the alliance has been killed 30 times.
---
It's because you take photos of your phone.
---
On my wotlk server, we were pugging the heroic ICC gunship boss. The 3rd bis caster trinket  dropped. I think it was called Muradin's Spyglass. A boomkin and I both rolled the same number (need before greed) and I was awarded the item.
---
Some people in voice chat said "Wait, you both rolled the same number. I think the game awarded ScuffedHypebeast the trinket because he clicked need first. Maybe you guys should roll again." No one contradicted that statement.
---
It was my first time coming across this issue and I didn't want to seem like a dick or a ninja, so I agreed to reroll and the boomkin won. I then looked it up, told the boomkin the guys were wrong. She proposed a third roll, which I lost again lol.
---
I saw that trinket drop a couple more times, but I never won it.
---
No, just the ability to actually have a discussion. Which is why you are resorting to predictable, ad-nauseum, copy paste responses to try and discredit someone instead.
---
Also you took that incredibly personally it seems.
---
I thought about transfering from Patchwerk, because we have way too much Horde.
---
I bind zooming to alt+ms wheel  up/down.
---
"The biggest challenges of WoW are not and have never been the mechanics. Least not in PvE."
---
So you'd say mechanics are the biggest challenge of... PvP?
---
Asmon has said multiple times he doesn't but that could be part of their deal if it exists. But even still, that just goes to show how well they're playing the game. Because the reacts channel is estimated to make about 100k a month on ad revenue.
---
Roach that probably earned more money in 3 months than you will in 20 years. Dude is an entertainer. Why are people still not understanding this? Every comment you make on topics like this puts money in their pockets. Im fine with that, but somehow all the haters dont seem to understand this concept.
---
And soon there were no alliance left on any servers...
---
I helped a warlock buddy get to field marshal in high school in 2006.  Win trading was 100% a thing in battlegrounds because 2 hour stalemates were a waste of both teams’ time.  If you ever encountered another GM group, your leader would hop out of ventrilo (joining another one to discuss with opposing team leader), and come back and say it was a win or loss.  Either way, no one fought at objectives, and a Druid from either side would 3-cap in 5 minutes to end it.
---
If Blizzard banned for win trading in vanilla, every single HWL/GM that I know of would have been banned.
---
Tbf most naxx raiders also knew jack shit about the game. I’ve seen a number of, for example, Sapphiron kills where the raid’s dps average was like 300.
---
Your average MC pug in Classic is roughly on par with that. People back then had no idea how to optimize, even retail LFR is more demanding in that regard.
---
Exactly, same with OSRS. i used to love chilling and watching Tv while grinding some stupid skill or whatnot. It is enjoyable because I know I'm going to use those resources later for something engaging
---
Did you just steal this video and post it to your twelve sub channel?
---
People are bitching because it isn't fun to be a target to be slaughtered every time they walk out of a capital.  To have to openly fight horde sitting in your capital isn't fun.  Yes these people rolled on a pvp server, but it's still a game and games are supposed to be fun.  By and large the complaints aren't "PvP is too hard" or "Horde Racials are OP".  The complaints are "Please for the love of god just let me play the game".
---
Yes these people rolled on a pvp server and pvp happened, but they do also deserve to get to play the game.
---
I feel so sad for the players that are experiencing this on either side. Its a unique experience for sure yes, but will make most people less likely to play. 
---
I wonder If there is anything blizzard can do anymore to fix these servers.
---
Merge servers which a 80/20 and a 20/80 server? Wonder If that would Make a massive queue.
---
I never said Asmon wasn't an asshole, I'm not a huge fan myself, but in my opinion he isn't comparable to Ice Poseidon.
---
Just watch his podcast stuff, he spergs on twitch because thats what gets the views.
---
Yep, I get these on 2 different computers and I see streamers have this all the time
---
Anything that emits a lot of light seems to cause this problem.
---
&gt;Most warriors were dual wield?
---
Yeah but 2H is best for PvP and is viable in PvE.
---
Gotta be honest, I'm not entirely sure. Though I think you get reflagged every time you participate in any kind of PvP (possibly including getting killed).
---
Is that a sword? Or is he just happy to see him?
---
wait for Naxx when you need 8 geared and specced Tank for the 4-Ponies boss
---
Ye and Im sure you killed me in Felwood today with your hunter buddy :D
---
Either coffer keys or kill bosses. Pure PP is trash. Either way its very boring.
---
I wanna buy a PC (just the tower) to run wow on better settings. Just want smoother/ nicer playing. Anybody got an idea of one I could get? Not trying to break the bank. Literally just want to play wow classic on it. Thanks!
---
MCCONNELL I KNOW YOU ARE READING THIS  
---
STREAM PLEASE
---
THANKS
---
OP probably wasn't even born when vanilla was out.
---
So I work in IT and security/dealing with scams is a pretty big part of my job. A lot of people mock these kinds of scams and how they could be done so much better, but it's basically done on purpose or at a minimum they know it doesn't matter. 
---
See if you or I get a message like that.. we ignore the person who sent it. But if we get a full on legit looking message from blizzard? We pay attention... right up until they ask us for our password or our credit card number and *then* we're out. That wastes the scammers time, whereas the initial contact messages are automated and they only have to pay attention when someone responds. Even ones that are just sending you to a URL... why waste time and bandwidth on people who aren't going to be fooled?
---
Basically if you're gullible enough to fall for the scam at all then you're going to be fooled by super obvious fake messages as well... so why make something more legit? The more legitimate something looks the more serious Blizzard/whoever will take it and they don't want that.
---
You have to avoid pvp for 5 minutes otherwise the timer resets. Hearth in from a contested territory? Good luck completely avoiding pvp for that time unless you can stealth.
---
No flasks. Do get fully buffed, onyxia and dm buffs
---
You know what really grinds my gears?
---
Me as a level 30 in STV getting camped by 4+ level 60 horde day after day and then when I ask for help in local, some one will always reply "if you don't like PvP, maybe you shouldn't have rolled on a PvP server."
---
Nothing like a hundred loads of all natural ironforgians
---
Fuck the horde
---
If you had done your research, you could have avoided this, though. Why didn’t you do your research? Lil buddy
---
wouldn't say they got mad. it's a talk shit, get hit situation.
---
Useful on thaddius, any if have any OTs not spec'd into fury. Its literally not worth it.
---
Thats fine by me ill stick to the casual crowd, dont have time to research fun
---
You haven’t really refuted anything yourself. So far it’s just you say and he say. How bout some links to these supposedly downvoted into oblivion posts you had?
---
I just don’t know what class to make lol
---
Do you understand contested zones and 5 minute rule?
---
this community sounds really awesome...once finals are over i might think about rolling alliance here
---
OFC it's a faction balance problem and not exclusively Horde. But the faction balance is Horde favored on the overwhelming majority of the servers.
---
You do realize that the amount of people actually interested in PvP back in the day wasn't a lot.
---
More than likely most of those guilds were on PvE servers and more than likely they didn't do much hardcore BG grinding.
---
Secondly, it has -25 stam. That's not what you want for PvP as a warrior, since you're already basically rooted in place permanently.
---
Vast majority of them went to Pallies as no warrior wanted it.
---
Anathema
---
Wow can’t believe I never thought of this smh
---
Who gives a shit? Tired of thread content getting hijacked by you weeaboos that actually care about this shit
---
...eugh... You mean those dull as dirt races to the end boss?
---
obvious troll.
---
&gt; what do you mean? you cant 1v20? get better at the game
---
You can't 1v20 as a holy priest? Retail is that way! &lt;------&gt; 
---
*/s*
---
Ah! The ol’ “He’s not toxic because I like him” defense
---
AV.
---
WSG doesn't have duration and will be filled with premades.
---
except the mobs die almost instantly, and if you want it up with any consistency you need to throw away a full DPS slot to use this. On Thaddius where damage is so extremely multiplicative, its certainly useful. Maybe Blizz puts on a higher proc rate and it becomes worth it. Sure, if you're spec'd prot and not the main tank (for some reason?) a nightfall is a better use of your attacks than using a better DPS weapon. If you really want to have a hunter spam r1 wing clip on every boss, that's fine.
---
Should use Travel Form to break out of it, costs less mana
---
Meh
---
no.
---
Hey man, we don’t currently have a guild no. We’ll probably just end up making one ourselves! You’re more than welcome to join us!
---
We play weird hours and like I said we’re pretty casual but there most weekends. Come run some dungeons with us (once we’re high enough for Deadmines) and see what you think!
---
I’m Argybargy in game, drop me a line anytime!
---
It will be interesting watching the babies come to the realization that alliance are equally toxic and ganky. You can't escape people who get off on upsetting other people until you go pve.
---
No. :)
---
Yes. You get unflagged after 5 minutes of no PvP in a friendly zone.
---
Since you took time out of your clearly busy day to comment, I'd say you "give a shit" ;)
---
Not to sound like a dick, but you want us to watch you talk about someone else's content? why?
---
Uberdanger is the real Classic experience.
---
Patchwerk Horde here, I think some alliance guilds panic transferred on the last day. Already regret rolling Horde, I like to actually be on the smaller faction, probably gonna reroll alliance on Venoxis.
---
You need to stay 5 minutes ALIVE to unflag
---
EDIT: I'm wrong, ignore my comment
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/PvP_flag
---
Its only anecdotal but I know a guy exactly like that par the screaming.
---
He just ganks people 12-14 hours every day and honestly doesnt see anything strange about it.
---
The regular potions of fire resistance help for the fire pack pulls
---
Huh! TIL. Thanks!
---
theyre both so different but if i have to choose then wsg
---
"You guys have no reason to complain, whinge or whine about it as you chose the chance of constant PvP without end yourself."
---
Incorrect. It was Blizzards job to set the game up so that it feels good to play and they failed. Yes you rolled on a PvP server, problem is getting corpse camped at a flight path by 10 people isn't PvP. It's just a complete waste of fucking time. People signed up for a PvP game, not one that does little other than completely waste lots of their time.
---
Your dismissal is as asinine as telling me that I should stop complaining about the meal I just paid for because "you wanted to go out for food and that's what you got so you have no reason to complain, you could have stayed in and cooked yourself". 
---
Yes but I wanted good food and instead I got a plate of garbage and I've every right to complain about this because the restaurant fucked up my food that I paid money for. 
---
Why are you lot so obsessed with silencing and dismissing people just because you aren't personally having your game ruined? Get some fucking empathy you jerks.
---
"I loathe streamers"
---
also
---
"tell me all about the streamers please"
---
Pathetic.
---
We're clearly talking about Vanilla though. The guy I replied to specifically had it in his post
---
You're to stupid to have this conversation with if you think that's the only way to compare people
---
if thats true then just stay dead for 5min instead cause that works
---
You want some lotion for those shoulders? You are really reaching.
---
Without any Alliance to gank maybe the Horde will get up to shower once in a while, maybe even go outside
---
Asmon let's it's slide as a form of free promotion for himself since lots of viewers of those channels are non-subscribers or don't watch on Twitch, but if they enjoy the content it pulls enough people in to start watching him live that it benefits him still. a very symbiotic relationship, between him and those channels. I'm pretty sure catdany is in his guild and maybe assertonsin too.
---
Yeah I don't get how people think advertise getting banned on twitch wasn't obvious since he clearly breaks the TOS of targeting and harassing streamers OR EVEN talking about other streamers which is also against tos.Probably why asmon doesn't even deal with advertise anymore. He hasn't watched a video on his stream since he got banned because he can't.
---
Everyone is moaning about classic wow now. 😂
---
Have you considered that perhaps the honor system is garbage and was removed for a reason. If you want to succeed then cheap, fast honor farming is the method of success. Modern games use MMR systems for a reason where win rate against equal or better ranked opponents is what determines your rank.
---
I wasn’t talking specifically about pvp. Frequently class abilities are just too strong or new trinkets are not tried out. It is mostly evident in m+. A lot of this is found in ptr but not changed until it hits retail for a bit. Those usually get patched at least.
---
Armor clipping is something has plagued certain classes and heritage armor sets that will probably never be fixed.
---
Oh i get why people are pissy, I really didn't mean irrelevant to the world, just to the topic discussed which is asmon being a persona and not the real whatever his real name is.
---
Good for you, barely playing the game. We are twinning!
---
Definitely me, part of the reason I'm still leveling an alt is for tbc/wotlk
---
WSG and AB.
---
AV is fun for the first few hours but becomes boring outside of that. I think a lot of people are sick of the Zerg raids as well.
---
WoW just doesn’t really work with mass scale pvp.
---
Really though i’m looking forward to pug vs pug games. So much of my private server pvp experience was ruined due to queue dodging and having 90% of games being a 1 sided shitfest.
---
Why would you call me a racist? Because I called out an actual racist?
---
If its 8v1 in a BG its going to be your team's fault.  Speaking as an Alliance player.
---
Cross-realm BGs ruined WoW.  Having to look for a premade and not be an ass hole in that group to stay in it, creates a more positive and engaged community.
---
You can be an ass hole in a dungeon regardless of whether it’s LFR or not. The majority of players will simply be jumping into pve for fun and pre-bis grind. And while it is fun to see players you know in dungeons, it’s really not necessary for most people. They just want to kill stuff and get gear. And if LFR means we can get into dungeons faster, then the majority of people will want that.
---
No need, plenty of video footage of Asmon whining and banning people that call him out on getting carried.  Also a video of Esfand having horde follow him around and helping him pvp.  Its all out in the open.  People have been banned for less in vanilla.
---
No it's what happens because there really isn't that much content if you play 8 hours every day.All you can really do is farm gold and pvp.
---
the school shooter music turned me off
---
My screen i guess... Turns out randomly pressing print screen can get weird...
---
I was actually. If you look far enough into my post history you would be able to see that I was in my early 20’s during vanilla and no, I didn’t play vanilla. I started at the beginning of BC.
---
Lol i never have to crawl my way in brm. I solo camp brm and searing gorge along with dozens of other horde. The alliance literally only have the same core pvpers day after day. Who literally pvp in groups of 7-10. Who get smashed by all the solo pvpers in the zone.
---
how about now?

Simple game theory baby. Take some free online classes from MIT [https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/economics/14-126-game-theory-spring-2016/](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/economics/14-126-game-theory-spring-2016/)

Go roll pve nerd boi

This looks accurate:

I got lots of empathy and i am absolutely savoring your frustration and savory, salty tears right now. If i may request, could you please post some whine for me to wash it down with?

We run three tanks, one is a bear.  We’d just rather sacrifice 50-100 dps keeping our Nightfall on our two Retribution Paladins. They embrace being a support DPS and aren’t against being cleansers and Nightfall carriers during raids. It’s not like they aren’t going to get the 2handers for other content, but their doing their part to support.
---
On a PvP server, having PvP force upon you IS playing the game. That is the entire point of PvP servers. 
---
You don’t like that, PvE servers exist.
---
"Simple mechanics" is a relative term. Either way, simple or complex, mechanics are still the hardest part of PvE for both novice and skilled players alike. Learning and executing boss mechanics is pretty much the entire game as far as PvE goes.
---
“There will never be anybody pvping on a pve server” I’m on a pve server and there’s a ton of world pvp 24/7
---
This is why I went PvE realm route...BG's where going to implemented..I'll do my PvP in there.  
---
I rather level in peace.
---
Blizzard: does nothing to keep 50/50 balance on it's servers
---
Blizzard: adds rewards for treating opposite faction players as mobs
---
Blizzard: while fixing queues gives free transfers to both factions on servers with already shit balance
---
Players: we need honor
---
Idiots: look how could you blame blizzard here!
---
Blizzard actually hired GMs in Vanilla. Everything is automated these days so good luck getting them banned.
---
Asmongoloid and his people up to shady stuff? Nah, you can’t be serious.
---
Fury tanks are easily far better than any Ret.
---
Thankgod im on transcendence feels pretty healthy populationwise
---
People who stayed on flamelash i take my hat off. To those who left i frown upon, you ruined it. Iam horde and an ally is KOS target, but you dont need to leave server.
---
Away RP some battle formations in IF.
---
If I didn’t have YouTube or Netflix during my daily Azshara/winter spring/felwood rounds I’d probably  go insane slightly faster than I currently am.
---
Pipe dream.
---
stream your 8 hour AQ raids for me, sounds awesome.
---
I wish I was creative enough to make this up.
---
Some great nostalgic clip right there. Even the music reminds me of 2005
---
&gt; I've invested 17 days into my character and I'm not starting again from scratch. 
---
That's your option - level to 60 again, which if you play regularly will not take more than 3 or 4 weeks at the most. Once you hit 60 again, it shouldn't be a big deal to start gearing up again, assuming you are in an active guild. Classic has always been a social game and our progress depends a lot on what your guild is doing.
---
No, and its happened more than once to me and my group.
---
And you're a moron who is comparing someone who was accused of being involved with pedophilia and a bunch of other illegal shit to a fucking WoW player who talks shit in a video game and triggers idiots like you on Reddit.
---
I bet you're seething that you have to work 9-5 while Asmongold can sit on his ass, talk shit in a 15 year old game and rake in 6 digits per month.
---
Imagine paying for 2 accts just because you drove off the opposing faction from the server lmao.
---
Yeah, you were complaining that no-one ever answers you, so I made up an answer. You're welcome.
---
Exactly this. I’m just mentally warn out after braking a dungeon.
---
So what are you saying?  They should be banned?  But wont because its automated?  Or they don't cheat so shouldn't be banned?  Make up you mind.
---
PvP is either gnome or dwarf.  PvE is Human.
---
If those are your only two options and you mainly PvP, gnome hands down.
---
The guilds aren't really the issue, it's the people themselves.
---
Im so desperete im paying 12€ a month to only make reseting my Mararuns more easily.
---
I'm not surprised a bigot would lie.
---
Perhaps you should stop being so close minded, you'll be happier if you open your mind up a bit, but I don't expect someone like you who is a self proclaimed racist to do that. I think your bigotry has you too hard.
---
And reroll pve cause you clearly suck at pvp. You wouldn't be crying like an 8 year old child about getting killed in pvp otherwise.
---
Maybe you should just reroll. Far from ideal, but you'll be better in the long run.
---
You're not 14 and you still act like this? Oof baboof.
---
Tuesday eu.  We’d na is how I understood it.
---
No there's something inherently different about horde players that makes them bad and alliance good
---
War + Sham can 2 man very easy
---
I think he knew what was going to happen but wanted to see if Asmon would passively or actively support the guild member accused of win-trading. Getting kicked means he gets to shout from the rooftops that Asmon is not only allowing it to happen, but encouraging and cultivating it by gkicking anyone who complains or calls the cheaters exactly what they are.
---
Lol the longest part of AQ is traversing the dungeon. Even doubling time to kill every boss would add maybe 10% time on the raid.
---
He’s talking out of his ass
---
People don't really understand because of 1.12 items and this "bug" making crit cap nonexistent that we're doing as much damage as people were doing in AQ/Naxx during actual vanilla. Could say it's arguably more because of consumables/world buff and raid comp minmaxing.
---
In general, the cost of premade over self built has gone way down. Depending on how much you spend on parts, it's also a good investment to have it built for you as failure to part installation is generally covered by the builder (microcenter is a close store to me. They break the part installing, you get a new one)
---
Ok, this all very solid stuff, especially the stat and stances. Thanks for it.
---
"Taken over", stop flagging in your own capitals lol.
