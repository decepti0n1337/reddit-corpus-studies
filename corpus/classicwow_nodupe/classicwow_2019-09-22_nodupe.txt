I'm a level 43 warrior looking to do some mob grinding for a level or two while watching Netflix and I was wondering if there are any level appropriate mobs with semi decent drops I could smash out for a while
---
Got mine recently as well!

Worth.
---
I don't think it's a bug, I just think that the party is being asked to commit. Are we all in the room or are we all out?
---
But all of the BFA players told me Classic is "just nostalgia" and everyone will quit? How could this be happening???
---
Also Kaydee, without the spying on people near you part. Just the kills
---
like myself, but not in dungeons out in the world to level. and yeah, the only other mages i saw doing this with me were chinese though there were plenty of english written guides that i used to find the spots.
---
WPVP like God intended.
---
IIRC, Northrend *was* on the old map.
---
In this [map](https://external-preview.redd.it/dSgVpe7vbdLGMGcSrVPZE82rPKKhCNpsIxB4WWwnMrI.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=4f33f645f4eaf212f3c27ce04a00ab4ba5ddf5d0) I'm pretty sure the series of small islands north of Lordaeron were supposed to be Northrend as those stayed on the map until WoTLK and then replaced by the Northrend we know today.
---
But, I'm picking on you. Not the rest of the thread. Why do you use reddit? To post shitty memes until someone recognizes it and gives you an e-highfive?
---
When you have add-ons, I agree. Using the vanilla interface makes targeting multiple people for healing a pain.

---
i be nothing but a common troll, mon. me thank you for understanding de commoner's aches and burdens.
---
I’ve played both sides, and generally I do prefer Alliance - but I do love Mulgore and Thunder Bluff. The Tauren definitely get the coolest starting zone in my opinion.
---
Killed 100 Bears - seemingly only 10% actually have a heart. 
---
Wolves - half of them toothless...
---
Is that Bobby Shmurda?
---
Thank you. It's annoying when groups pull too fast, but if I need the extra time, I'll plan for that towards the end of a combat encounter and type /oom so everyone knows I need a short break before the next pull. Otherwise I'll just start chugging and join in once heals are actually needed.
---
Why me
---
Cleave was originally used to describe splash damage with minimal loss of single target dps, i.e abilities such as Cleave, whirlwind, blade flurry, multishot ect.
---
Yes!  Absolute savagery.
---
It's weird, I've noticed the exact same thing as a 45 priest. But then again very few DPS seem interested in CC or targeting the same mob, so that might be the reason.
---
Not trying to be a dick here but your dps would be much higher and you would be much more effective dotting multiple targets
---
Didnt the TCG mounts then get duped in WoD?
---
Nah, every leveling priest spec goes wand spec. Also disc priests get 20% threat reduction.
---
&gt; In reality he just PvPed, but avoided NPCs getting aggroed via a bug.
---
Which is actionable by blizzard since vanilla, and here we are.
---
Ha! That’s nothing. You know where warriors keep their armies? UP THEIR SLEEVIES!
---
I'm in a guild you fucking idiot. 10 year olds aren't 60 2 weeks into the game, neither are 40 year old drunks. Imagine calling people who aren't bad at the game elitist because they don't want to spend 2 hours doing a single emp run.
---
Doesn't look like it does. Only has the icon on the character pane.
---
I SAID THAT I HAD A PARTY TO ATTEND THAT DAY!
---
I Got It!
---
Wow, it definitely seems like you solved my problem. Replacing 'Attack' with '16' for the tooltip works perfectly. And now I know there's a dev head icon in the game. Here I was going insane trying to delete it! Lol  
---
Thank you!
---
tbf due to cross-realm sharding, most retail realms have a far lower pop than classic servers.
---
It's phase 1 there's literally no honor yet.
---
This is dumb and you should feel bad.
---
Imagine being this much of a sweaty neckbeard that you care this much about how someone else is playing WoW. Fucking omegalul.
---
Hunters can use most weapons tho
---
Is the spellcleave rush meta here to stay? The community feels awkward and hostile towards players who want to play Classic without the rush. I'm starting to feel that I'm just not welcome in the game and can't make any friends.
---
it is, but if you miss it doesnt say Evade which is almost always a pathing bug
---
As someone who ganks way lower players. It's not my fault you wanted to be an ugly Horde should have rolled the right faction.
---
Yeah hunters love daggers
---
Dang I guess all those times I’ve been camped by high level horde they were just false flag alliance players....
---
The guy in the icon is still working at blizzard today
---
This video has such an old video game montage feel, I like it
---
Found the retail zoomer.
---
I feel like people shouldn't be shamed for getting help from others in an mmo.
---
Prove it though
---
To be fair, I don't think I've ever seen cleave as an ability that hits more than 2 targets (barring an 'upgraded' Cleave ability that might hit 3.)
---
Whirlwind, Flurry or Rampage are typically the terms I've heard for AE melee attacks.
---
This is not how it goes with skilled opponents bud
---
To agree with your hunch, playing with your friends is a lot more fun in my opinion. By choosing the opposite faction you will literally never get to play with them. You can always work to find a good guild and make other friends but one of my favorite things playing classic back in the day was playing with my friends. I went alliance for friends with this release even though I’ve always been horde and thoroughly enjoying it
---
Can be seen at 14:06 in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV8E_GGFrjg) when the player turns around
---
The problem with this is due to the Succubus' invisibility. I was able to resolve this by turning it off when questing. 
---
I reported the bug to Blizzard already, but haven't gotten a response back yet.
---
Guild spammers sure, but goldsellers are already breaking the rules so one would imagine they'll just put in the extra effort of either unprotecting the function or automating their spam without using the Lua API.
---
ElvUI
---
Just was reminded of those MoC bombs at the Alb gates. Good times
---
You have that confused. Dishonorable kills are only in relation to killing non-guard NPCs. 
---
You can kill low level noobs all day long. 
---
The only real incentive to not kill people lower level than you is that they don't give you any honor. 
---
Heck, losing pvp ranks from dishonorable kills isn't going to be that big of a factor for players anyway. Getting a high pvp rank isn't something you casually do. You have to spend literally weeks of non-stop pvp grinding to get high ranks in pvp.  
---
The players that are going for high rank pvp are going to be sticking to battlegrounds, not wpvp.
---
I've been AOE grouping more often since I'm a frosty boi and hit scarlet monastery. 
---
But good to know! Thanks for taking the time to explain that!
---
Any good totem addons? Preferably on the twitch app?
---
Battlegrounds are going to be cross realm.
---
Same.
---
All I see here is a mage upset that someone is messing up their AoE pull.
---
It's the retail mentality. As a mage, fuck those people. Let me CC in peace, people!
---
No one can really make this decision for you.
---
Are these close, personal friends? Are they likely to play the game beyond the first few months? If either of those answers is "no," maybe you should consider doing what you prefer.
---
Get a hunter to 10 or 20
---
It's just the dynamic respawns. Sometimes it seems to work overtime.
---
Lore isn't changed, it's just some various minor graphical modifications like skeletons are skinned as zombies.
---
Depictions of undead is not a problem, it's skeletons specifically.
---
Games were always more fun before YouTube guides and being able to google everything. 
---
That's what made diablo 2 so amazing. Nobody really knew the metas and just did what they wanted to do.
---
Yea good thing sharding happened. Who wants to wait in queue to wait in line to play a game.
---
Your comments are objectively wrong.  A single large heal hits for 1000+ for several hundred mana.  A group heal hits for 300 per party member for 700+ mana.  The entire concept of aggro and tanking is to maximize dps and survivability.
---
something added in phase 3. its instanced pvp
---
People have been using it in the context I've said in retail for years.
---
Even casters in pro events use the term cleave for just any aoe/mass dmg pull.
---
Its not worth it. Nor is enchanting unless you get MC/AQ enchants.
---
The real fyi post here.
---
Viable? Sure. Will you be any where close to comparable dps other rogues/mages/warriors? Not even close. Even with chugging consumables you will go oom so fast in raids without using rank 1 shocks for Elemental Devastation procs etc. As dps you are more useful as a mobile totem for melee groups. You can do it but you may not enjoy if it you wanna be doing comparable dps.
---
100%
---
As a hunter, you can use feign death to control your threat.  I recommend getting a threat meter until you get a feel for it.    
---
One of the hunter's in my guild actually pulls for me, and then feigns death.  That way i can charge the mobs to get rage, without risking aggroing a nearby pack.  If you communicate with the tank, he will appreciate this and if he's aware of the plan, can easily pick up threat if the feign fails.
---
What’s phase 3?
---
he was also a asshole
---
You must be a cool guy :D
---
As a survival hunter, my power fantasy is literally being a Green Arrow-like superhero
---
JuSt Do CoMpEtItIvE dPs AnD dOnT gImP yOuR gRoUp
---
See? It works both ways.
---
What does it mean?
---
Northrend in WC3 was pretty massive, no way those small islands could represent it.
---
Someone is jealous
---
You're a Millenial, not a Boomer.
---
i let the healer get to 20-30% as a tank so that if things go south we have the OH SHIT mana
---
I agree.
---
The only time I really want the tank / group to wait "20 seconds" is right before a boss, after I've rebuffed everyone.
---
Otherwise, going when I'm at 50% mana or around there is perfectly acceptable.
---
Largest part of no druid dps in vanilla was before the talent trees were sorted, think it was 1.8? Feral and balance specs were not worth it before 1.8.
---
Now thats class
---
If you go with your friend as a tank I always communicated that. Now he knows me after 10 Stratholme runs and our timer gets faster and faster.
---
We fill up with guild people or randoms.
---
Casters don't need ammo pouches or bags. Wands don't gain AP only spell power AFAIK
---
I'm more impressed with how you earned *thirty six* hundred experience right as Justin is talking about how Lothar killed *thirty six* orcs with his bare hands.
---
Wow.
---
[deleted]
---
But he's different, he swears! He'll be top dps ret, you'll see!
---
You mean subjectively. Objectively it's right.
---
They might sound good or their music is fun to hear. But none of them is/were able to write lyrics like mf doom or Aesop rock or sage Francis or mos def or basically everyone above the Shakespeare line.
---
It was bug back in vanilla for a little  bit but that has since been fixed. It does not work.
---
The problem is the old world probably isn't as big as it should be
---
they just want the opportunity to kill someone but re butthurt when it happens back to them.
---
Needlessly going above and beyond to make alliance suffer... your doing gods work. Keep it up!
---
ITT bunch of whiners I'm with you OP, this is a bullshit carebear ban that you shouldnt have got
---
Actions! Have! Consequences!
---
do you use Blessing of salv on people? Cause I throw that on and with consencrate I usually don't lose aggro
---
Can someone explain the 5 second rule in practical purposes?
---
What I mean is that I understand the definition of it but should I be worrying about it at lvl 30 rn? How should it effect my normal healing rotation as a shadow priest?
---
Paladin had zero mana when he started this. Would have been stuck doing nothing but auto attacks for awhile. Instead he started CCing letting his regain half his manapool.
---
I get why people want to do it, mages and to a lesser extent locks are crazy in dungeons. I was doing a lbrs today as a 60 Hunter with a 60 rogue and 55 mage and many pulls the mage did 2-3x our damage. I can imagine 3-4 mages melt through a dungeon effortlessly
---
Ganking green levels. You deserved that lmao
---
Yes, it happened a few days ago.
---
You do realize there is more than one build that is good for pvp right? there is resto build, Resto-Balance, Full boomkin (great if you have high crit chance to obliterate people with a max tier cast starfall if it crits) a resto/balance/feral hybrid that is basically "i annoy you" build, and a full feral with dipping into balance for omen and resto for furor build.
---
That's like saying the only pvp build for paladins is holy, or that the only thing druids do in pvp is carry the flag, or that if you are not a frost mage you will suck in pvp.
---
Grats man.
---
*cries quietly in mid 30s warrior*
---
I’d be robbed within minutes if I did this. Lol
---
Looks pretty nice, though!
---
It's like those drawings of the solar system. If it were to scale, the image would be about 129000 x 124000 resolution.
---
Yes if you name them normal instead of pve then you have the psychological advantage
---
I'd argue that, funnily enough, tanaris is probably more barren then the barrens
---
As someone who used to to tank back in the day, I was so excited to get this buff back. It really is a game changer.
---
It's ok, there's no honor in anything, PvP patch hasn't been introduced yet :\*D
---
every contested area has this 30-70 ratio, that gets worse at peak times when the kids come online. Stv is stv, desolace is in kalimdor, hillsbrad is the best but there are not enough quests...it gets boring after a while, so i respecced into prot paladin and ive been sitting in sm like every other person
---
I, for one, eagerly await the resurgence of CN PvP movies
---
Well, we care. This term is stupid and meaningless.
---
BIS tracker shows he drop rate on your bis items
---
Thanks for this,    
---
  
---
Good response and it mostly does make sense. However, just because I’ve read so much online indicating using another move in other situations and had the same experience myself (though I admit I could be fooling myself), I’d like to ask you about some or those other situations. Some of the same ones we were mentioning earlier. Just to get your opinion.  
---
So against cloth wearing or low health mobs, I regularly finish them off in much less than 9 seconds. If I’m opening combat with any move I can get one point and then immediately put it into SnD. So this will probably take 1-2 sec on avg. I guess what I’m getting at is that when the battle is over in 5-7 seconds, is the overall increased white damage going to finish the battle more quickly for me than say, a 3-5 point eviscerate?  
---
And then again, against plate wearers or heavy armor mobs. SnD is likely to be up for full duration, but white damage is reduced because of the armor, where as garrote or rupture will do normal damage right?  
---
So just through my own practice and also reading wowhead, icy veins, it seems like unlike against normal mobs which are best dealt with a normal rotation but increased attack speed, maybe SnD isn’t best for the other types.
---
This would be considered more frequently than edge cases. There are a lot of mobs out there that fit this criteria.  
---
Also - the reason I use SnD in dungeons is that I know I can always have it up for full duration, which again is in question for mobs while leveling.
---
im totally with you, nothing is more annoying than pussytanks.
---
If it is a wipe, run your ass back in.
---
Do NOT sit on your butt, make the group sit there waiting for you, and then say "lol preist runs in &amp; rezzes for wipes".
---
Don't be that jerk. If everyone's dead, everyone runs.
---
When people release they usually blank out and auto run into dungeon. Which is why I specified dont run back in! Better to not releae at all so it doesnt happen
---
Proof of this being true?
---
I'm pretty sure the GM I talked to would have mentioned this if so. 
---
They basically said that you're shit out of luck and noting more than a toy for the horde to play with until the get bored mind controlling you. 
---
We told him to try to unstuck but was unable to do so in combat. Couldn't get a summon either.
---
The free transfers were from high pop realms, and were to specific realms, so you don't really get a choice.
---
Spellcleave does have a ring to it tho haha
---
What the hell does sharding have to do with this? Also, why did you say sharding when sharding is retail only?
---
&gt; makes me wonder why I bother
---
Because it's a massive help to your tank's sanity to have at least one DPS who isn't proactively stupid.
---
Whats wrong with you bro,its his first wow mmo experience....let him enjoy it
---
Mana draining mage here, all great fun, but then stop constant, asking me for more water, especially at level 21/31/41/51, I gave you 3 stacks, which should be more than sufficient for the dungeon. And no, you do not need Arcane Intellect immediatly when it runs out at a random trash pull. 
---
99% of a dungeon is me drinking. Not even the fun type of drinking. I’m getting water poisoning. People seem to expect AoE damage at 10% mana. I will finish my drink or see me wanding the whole pack. Yes, my Evocation is on cooldown, yes, all my mana crystals are used, yes, I brought mana potions and yes, one full drink of 30 seconds will not fill my mana bar. Stop draining your mage. It’s not just the healer that needs mana.
---
Yeah wipe and a single death is different. Agreed dont just sit if it's a wipe
---
Just the mere concept of this question makes me question irl in general.
---
That actually seems really slow, no?
---
I'm a rogue who was farming alone in stv last night and from 35-38 took me about 2-2.5 hours?
---
[removed]
---
From what I understand it didn’t work in vanilla, but did work on some PS’s but doesn’t work in Classic. However, I’ve equiped ammo just in case.
---
Two things you gotta understand: Stat itemization is wonky in vanilla, and relatively speaking, 1% crit will give you more dps than an additional 10 ap. 
---
[You can find the presumed BiS sets for Warriors here,](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YXJpasqqodeq9B4jeUZDP9khFQf5QocyMby6moydJWk/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;sle=true#) with the caveat that the alternatives are there to give you options for if you can't pick up the actual BiS stuff. Only the wrists, belt, boots, and hat are actually plate, with the gloves, shoulders, and pants all being leather.
---
Woah this is hilarious
---
Yeah for Druid it does need to be a little careful but that's why it's important to befriend good healers so you always have some good ones to ask :D
---
Did it actually ever exist in vanilla? I thought it was just a private server thing.
---
20k?
---
honestly grow up world pvp is part of the game and no level 60 is "spawn camping you call day long" because they'll get bored. Sometimes you'll wait for a npc to respawn like you wait for quest mobs to spawn. You're making mountains out of mole hills.
---
And honestly it'll just make it that much sweeter when you level up and can go take vengeance on the opposing faction.
---
TBC is better then Vanilla tho O:
---
You keep saying things as if they are a proven fact.
---
Going full feral with omen and furor and having the 50% wep speed is more than viable for pve and for world pvp.
---
You don't have to spam shifts roots dots and hots if you don't want to.
---
Hybrid lets you play in many ways.
---
I am not sure if you are a troll or just mentally handicapped, but I am leaning towards a combination of both.
---
/blocked.
---
as a mage i’ve encountered this as well, some people just like to carry grudges against certain classes for whatever reason lmao. big /shrug
---
Yup its levels 11-30 WHO THOUGHT THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA!
---
why does it matter? how is it acting strange to not be upset over sonething completely meaningless
---
Group healing is more difficult and less mana efficient.
---
You could call it future predicted market value I guess
---
Druid forms don't use weapons for attack damage, they are basically just stat sticks. With the said, the BiS for feral druids is a weapon in Gnomer that has a use effect, but it also only has 3 charges before it's useless.
---
So feral druids looking to be competitive in raiding guilds have to grind this mace.
---
Or they can switch to resto...
---
 
---
**No** **Comments** **Yet**
---
Hoes mad
---
Ah my bad I misread it as don’t run back. Usually it takes them so long to run back that, unless it’s a full wipe, the healer gets there in time anyways. But yeah definitely don’t run in :)
---
This doesn't seem suspect at all.
---
And who knows, maybe the rando you enlist won't run off with all of your bread.
---
It’s a transliteration, like Beijing and Shanghai are in English. They are just English sounds that mimic what the Chinese words sound like.
---
Capt said it all. There is no gold being created. We are just trading.
---
He’s not obviously.
---
Yeah pre 1.12 but not sure exactly  when.

If they're being a real shithead they get an intervention
---
Generally speaking, the 5 second rule effects all casters equally. Now, to maximize your efficiency and lack of downtime, the idea is to cease mana usage if the enemy will die within 5 seconds. All this means to you, or any other class gaining MP5, is that your mana will start generating right when the mob dies and as you move on to the next mob. If you're playing solo, this habit may reduce how often you need to slurp mage nectar to start the next mob. If you're playing in a dungeon scenario, this may speed up the experience if you have mana to burn between mobs 1 &amp; 2 versus having everyone sit and wait on the healer (no one waits on the DPS, realistically). 
---
I tried to keep it very generalized but I think it covers the big picture.
---
Why is that?
---
This is me thanking you later.
---
What are you trying to say?
---
You won't be able to do it in-game. Has to be from the official blizzard website. And I'm positive it works.
---
Getting to 60 as a warrior solo
---
Whatever delusion makes you feel better mang. This is my new main, because my prior 4 or 5 got YEET'd from various subreddits.
---
what is your point? im not going to answer that because it has nothing to do with what i was pointing out.
---
Yeah and those people were stupid as hell.
---
Do you mean 31/15/5 or am I missing something? What would you pick up in sub besides opportunity?
---
yeah, in the ship, which is inaccessible standing from the exploit spot...
---
Why aren't you supposed to be lynching lowbies?
---
As a healer if you run to the tank you’re likely to get stunned or something too so not always the best approach.
---
Theres still a ton of people under level 10 you'll have plenty of people to level with. Probably for a long time!
---
Warlock Hunter or Priest for someone who sucks at pvp but wants to git gud?
---
I actually bought tons of runecloth for 1.2 on AH and sold most of it for 1.4+ while leveling. The profits aren't great considering the cut and deposit fees, but it was very easy to do and I was doing these on a second account while my main was in flight or on a long ride. I don't plan to do any turnins though since I'm already NE and it would be foolish to get a horse or a ram instead.
---
The area around 30-45 seems so goddam bad.
---
Every Warrior "Tank" turns up with that bloody axe and thinks he can do shit.
---
The results are usually like that
---
1. Warrior loses threat because he is not as good as he thought he is.
---
2. Mobs spread out and start attacking the others (usually Mages and Warlocks)
---
3. The healer can clean the mess up and keep everyone alive instead of just having to focus on the Tank
---
4. Smug ass Two-Handed Tank says: See? It is not that bad! 
---
Yeah, It sure is not bad from YOUR perspective, you are the spinning idiot that does not seem to care about anything but your own DPS.
---
It must be nice not to be depressed and to enjoy something like this.
---
Are you kidding me. It is one of the best looking epics in the game. Armored horse with red eyes.
---
Unpaid labor? Hell yea
---
ah, looks like I got it elsewhere, but it’ll show up and update under twitch once you’ve loaded it.

---
which would have been inaccessible from the exploit spot...and there's nothing 'again' about that point
---
Yeah, like when an undead lady gives you a kitten to throw into an infected moonwell. Was so sure it was going to explode.
---
Going into each fight with 10% mana the whole dungeon is just asking to be wiped sooner or later. We’re not all pros playing with a pro team that doesn’t make any mistakes. Putting yourself at 10% mana just puts your whole squad into the brink of death no matter how good you are. 
---
Yes I love a good pace, It’s crucial, but on average a team wipes at least once a dungeon... because tank can’t wait 5 more seconds for a little extra mana.... I would totally agree with you if everyone playing Warcraft was competent but there not so yea... I usually have to waste multiple mana pots of my own just cause people think it’s faster to fight a mob with auto attacks..... ITS NOT! It goes both ways and some people don’t see that they just want to go fast fast fast.
---
pretty funny you mean
---
You also rip all sorts of aggro unless your tank is very good. Multi-dotting is a lot trickier than retail
---
why not, the Party is still ruling and censorship never ends
---
I think they just get down-voted instead.

---
HURR RETAIL BAD
---
You can get flagged for PvP for doing anything that helps someone that is already flagged like buffing.
---
I'll tell Shaw about this maybe we can utilize this information at our advantage against the horde
---
Not at all. Tbf english is not my native language
---
Gotch. So what percentage of that 50 is poisons? Because even if the dmg isn’t reduced from armor, if it’s only a small percentage I’m wondering if that increase beats the full garrote/rupture damage.

Also for the clothies - I’ve come to the same conclusion that some eviscerate damage is usually wasted. But isn’t the goal to simply end the fight asap? Maybe I’m a little more relaxed and not chaining mobs as hard as I could, but I usually have my energy fully restored by the time the next battle begins anyways, and often have a hard time pulling SnD from mob to mob unless I’m really not taking any damage.   
---
Also - this is completely personal so not part of my argument. But I find that mob chaining to be a little frenetic for my own playstyle, which is another reason I go with evis/rup over SnD.
---
What is it with sadistic assholes always being Horde? Well played regardless.
---
Ebola cleave
---
Maybe I’m just a horde fanboy but I think west fall is so ugly and the barrens has its charm
---
And then read the other comments of ppl saying they have to give the chains away.  Believe me, not worth even close to 300g bud.
---
God I fucking hate orc racial. Had a tank war that kept using it at like 50% health tanking 3-5 moba in sfk. Real fun spamming Max rank healing wave and ooming instantly
---
Yep
---
WoW is literally a race war.
---
Only a Hunter or a Mage AoE group can really kite trash mobs. Which is a viable strategy, but it lowers their DPS for basically no justifiable reason.
---
It's a spec that is far more focused around control than it is straight damage. It's definitely not as straight forward as an assassination combat spec, but imo you feel less like a budget fury warrior when you're playing subtelty.
---
Nope, those small islands are referenced in some books hidden around Vanilla, they are called the Dragon Isles 
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Dragon_Isles
---
Northrend was not featured on the Vanilla map because in lore it was supposed to be much further North than the map went. It was moved a tad closer and they expanded the map for WotLK
---
Consider Restorative Potion for dots, and, most importantly, consider shadow reflecting engie trinket
---
They really don't care I called Microsoft and they gave me a free windows 10 pro key.
---
Yea gj. You're now officially one of the normie hordie
---
Since when do people just not put places on maps where they don't need to go even though they know of their existence?  
---
A real life world map drawn by me would look pretty small and barren. But that's okay. There's no need for me to go anywhere else.
---
That's a chain. A cleave is typically an ability or spell that hits 2-5 targets or cone attacks.
---
I relate to that guy. Its so anyoing being a rogue seeing loads of grps looking for dps... but only spellcleavers. Its really gotten out of hand...
---
Just watch greekgodx, you'll laugh.
---
You can pick up a harvesting profession and sell mats, farm grays,  felcloth, pickpockets, or specific drops like crusader enchant or lvl 19 twink items.
---
Whats up with skeletons and China? Why are skeletons in particular a taboo over there?
---
You generally want to be killing green mobs as a warrior. I think Basilisks in STV and spiders in and around the caves of Dustwallow should be green for you and have greys that vendor for a decent amount
---
ROFL
---
This is totally dependent on your server's economy. On my server I vendor them.
---
The saving grace is that shaman is such a fun class to play
---
thanks!
---
This. This is just gameplay, the EK and Kalimdor are big fucking continents, the game is not build to scale. In one of the older books for example it took Rhonin like 3 weeks to get to Soutshore from Dalaran. And no, it wasn't because of the gankers.
---
Point is you don’t need to exploit to become rich in this game.
---
Great video man,lots of us from back in the days,but this time in classic going more casual:)
---
I think xaryu plays with his camera zoomed in pretty far.
---
I "tanked" a couple SM runs with two locks that were several levels higher than me. I didn't even bother trying to keep aggro. I just clumped the mobs up in the tidiest ball I could before they nuked everything.
---
Not really worried about raids, just UBRS/Scholo/Strath for the most part.
---
This, it’s disrespectful to get involved in a 1v1. If I were in your shoes I would want the rogue to leave us alone.
---
You guys go outside? I haven’t seen the sun since classic launched
---
I main a Forsaken. I assume she couldn't resist the cronsche.
---
I love with chinese people and even they can admit their culture approaches video games in a different way. Sorry but we arent all the same and acknowledging differences isnt racism.
---
The TOS we can't fault him for. Who the fuck reads the TOS?
---
It was always like that on high pop realms, blizz don't have a "min buyout per item" sorting option - ya gotta make such yourself with an addon then!
---
You can heal it.... Just not fast enough.
---
typicall horde shit
---
I'm pretty sure you want a gorilla for aoe threat. 
---
I've seen hunters use turtles or bears too. I think one of the birds has screech which does decent threat.
---
Even with max weapon skill it be like that.
---
Attack, dodge, overpower, miss.
---
So Staff of Jordan, for example can't drop from something from BlackRock Depths, right?
---
There's nothing more to say
---
When I get to a high enough level I’ll be all over that trinket. Right now I’m level 35 so I’m using superior healing potion or greater healing potion.  
---
Yeah I go to bandage almost every time and then immediately lose it from the dot, then have to hit the potion. I just keep forgetting that it’s broken by dots.
---
Gets you out of one, but another can be applied quickly.
---
Probably gorilla or owl/bat/carrion bird.
---
i wanna understand everyone and their "classic feel" addiction, but some some of the class balance in this game lmao
---
Well it took us a few year to discover America so...
---
i've been wanting to try something similar, by novaing some1 at lava.
---
Rogue can make a lot of money via pickpocketing runs. I’ve heard the BRD pickpocketing is nerfed but regardless it’s good money. Warrior isn’t great for farming as it lacks survivability solo and much aoe. but both classes can be used to farm.
---
that said, you should definitely try to get used to the AH. vendoring can make you good money but you will lose out on a lot by avoiding the AH for BOEs and such. I think there’s some level of misunderstanding too, you will not have to be flipping things on the AH all day to make money using it. For example I usually just send anything worth listing to a bank alt and list it at the beginning/end of a day. Look into addons like auctioneer to make using the AH easier for you.
---
Frame missing: me walking 10 steps to the general goods vendor to sell it.
---
Nah its trolling like a dumbass. You know what dumbasses get? A foot in the ass, also sounds like you need one too, dumbass.
---
Right.
---
"You guys didnt have a 1v1 of same lvl with same gear and same fps/ping, didnt handshake and count down from 10 before starting your world pvp so it's not true world pvp smh"
---
wow.gamepedia suggests those small islands are *not* the dragon isles, though. They're the [Northern Islands.](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Northern_islands)
---
I get this sentiment but that's when:
---
The tank is actually not taking a lot of damage. I'm not gonna get too deep into the reasons as there's been a huge amount of hatred the last time I posted this. But you're saying this, because it's far more likely that your tanks are doing a good job of mitigating incoming damage, and/or the group that you're in is a good one where they're doing likewise.
---
I promise you that if you ran in some of the recent groups of late that I've been in, that you'll be singing a *very* different tune. Even here in Uldaman, I'm seeing tanks who charge headlong into groups and simply use dps rotations to bring them down, who say "lol if I go shield then I'm lowest on the meters".
---
Yes, yes indeed. And these same charming individuals pull the next mob *immediately* after having killed the last group. You will not have recovered even 500 mana before he's already taking pretty hefty damage as he's surrounded, and there's nary a demoralizing shout in sight, never mind a thunderclap debuff on the mobs.
---
Hey listen, I get it. You're probably saying this is an extreme edge case, and really everyone by now knows what they're doing. After all we've all had 15 years to accumulate knowledge of this game and surely we're all on the same level, right?
---
Unfortunately I'm still seeing the same tired cliches and stereotypes of 15 years ago continue to ring true and happen. Hunters who roll on Int gear over their caster brethren(I can always hear you guys going "hunters use int as one of their stats, and an upgrade is an upgrade even if it's cloth, I don't care what you say"). I'm not going to bother arguing with those of you who insist up and down that the **only way** for warriors to keep aggro is to use a 2H weapon. And that there's no reason to 1h+shield before BRD. yeah yeah yeah I've heard it all before.
---
But hey listen. When all the conditions are ideal. When the group is reasonably geared, evenly levelled for the instance at hand, everyone knows what they're doing and is reasonably co-ordinated, then sure, by all means - speed the run up. The group will just organically speed the run up when really there's no danger.
---
All I'm saying is, not all of us are in guilds where we always have the right people at the right time for the right roles. Very often there will be PUG groups, and in PUG groups conditions are very often less than ideal.
---
So many angry alliance in the comments.
---
My rate is $250 an hour for my genius 1 month experience with wow classic
---
IMO it's warriors that are like this with gear and weapons. It doesn't matter if it's your classes' pre-raid bis, *it's really good for fury/tanking/being afk in ironforge*.
---
True, but you need to minimise MB's as well. Mages keep telling me to pull a shitton of stuff so they can AOE, but then I have to wait on them drinking between every fight. And the poor healers, man... No one cares about them.
---
Just to clarify, by restorative potion I meant THE restorative potion. It's a consumable item that dispels curses and magics
---
How's your ad rep?
---
My friend plays rogue and pick pockets a lot. Hes got mount money at 30.
---
It depends on what you do. I'm 39 on warrior and I have 40g. Definatly not getting mount, but I have all my profs at at least 200. Hoping I get lucky at 60 with BS recipes for my money though.
---
I wouldn't worry about it.
---
You are a sad violent little person.
---
I saw a warrior fighting a mob. It would have been a close fight. He was half hp and the mob was full. He had a mobs corpse next to them so figured he pulled 2 by accident. I threw MoTW on him as well as thorns. A quick rejuv and regrow and I went tostealth a mob. He charged at it and took itfrom me.
---
Sent him a /spit that's for sure
---
It looks like a lot of people don't recognize what it means. AoE makes sense because it means what it says. You won't know what spellcleave is unless you hear someone else using it.
---
This is your brain on white cultural imperialism
---
Boo keh chee (you’re welcome)
---
If the warrior is losing aggro to DPS, it's probably because DPS went a bit too soon or didn't focus well. That's likely not on the tank. But if you all survive a botched pull, then you're plenty leveled anyway, so you should be pushing the pace and not wasting your time with sword and board.
---
Thunderclap isn't good because you can't use it in Defensive Stance, not because it only hits 4 mobs. It's also meh because of the target limit, but the target limit doesn't matter as much as the lack of a way to make it generate more threat, since its damage is relatively low compared to everything else you have. Max rank Thunderclap is only 103 damage, which is easily met at level 36 with any 2h and hitting whirlwind. 
---
Battle/demo are your only real tools from the class. After those are used, you start changing targets, hitting each one with a revenge or sunder before moving to the next. If you have a 31-point talent, use it as well.
---
Not it.
---
you cant multiply with layers, only divide.
---
That’s like saying you can’t fault him for signing a contract and who the fuck reads a contract? Lol. Just because you don’t care what the TOS has to say does not mean you are exempt from the rules it states when you agree to it
---
Very situationally dependent.  Hunter kiting as a form of quasi CC and taking little damage, sure.  Mage unloads on the pull and is now taking hits for half his health pool, no.  
---
With rare exception, if you gain aggro and it isn't on on purpose, just run to the tank and let him/her peel it off of you.
---
zug zug
---
Nope just not a pussy, maybe get off reddit and experience the real world.
---
Yeah the quest info is honestly the best part.
---
That’s what you get for playing a fucking annoying ass gnome
---
Literally that.
---
To add to that, in Feralas there's a marker for the map you need to steal from some Gnolls
---
Every American is an oppressor and an imperialist, black or white
---
What spec are you?
---
I am salty too, not to his extent where I take it out on random mages. I got summoned to SM on like day 4 for a "farm run" and was quickly replaced after the run. Was my dps low? No I just didnt have a light blue name.
---
Also been flamed for asking to join a BRD group that wasnt advertised as mages only. Tried to explain politely that I could aoe solid as a hunter and was put on the ignore.
---
It's not listed as a patch change at any point on the ammo pouch or wand page on WoWpedia.
---
I swear I recall seeing it at some point too, but that may be false memory.
---
Nope, the 4 small land masses above the line are the Dragon Isles 
---
The Broken Isles were supposed to be too small to portray on the world map. They were only made bigger for Legion. In the RTS games there was just the Tomb of Sargeras, the ruins of Suramar (definitely no protective bubble, just ruins), and some scattered islands like the Broken shore and maybe parts of Azsuna. The Northern 60% of the continent was added later, and then the whole thing was scaled up to be continental sized instead of just small islands
---
In terms of language common usage becomes correct usage. That's literally how language works.
---
Alliance camped my body for 2 hours the other day. Scummy people on both sides. Just have a laugh man.
---
What is MP5?
---
You go to Northrend in Reign of Chaos too. It's the end of the first human mission, when Arthas gets Frostmourne
---
Brazil
---
I'm fairly certain that the two small ones on the southern part of the first map are Zandalar and Kul'Tiras.
---
The map has just gotten updated over time. The small islands up north are Northrend and the Broken Shore as well im pretty sure.
---
"I'm so proud we 3v1 that guy and won!"
---
Last less time
---
Guards seem pretty bad everywhere except gadgetzan and booty bay
---
i was in a alliance town and a horde mage just blasts me THROUGH the elite 60 npc and he just stands there and lets me die
---
USELESS
---
I have to think that part of this is the people in those groups thinking ahead to raids even though that is not what they are in currently. If they take a ret to BRD and the ret gets the Savage Gladiator's chest and the Hand of Justice (which of course would be great for them), will it benefit that person if down the road they are playing as holy in a raid. Alternatively, they could have waited for a warrior to join, who could have gotten those same pieces that the ret got, and in addition to being great for leveling with are now being worn by a warrior that is topping the MC damage meter. Not saying that is easy for a ret to swallow, but something that the rest of the group may be thinking.
---
Do we have concrete evidence of that? You can easily accept a party invite using combat. That would put you on their layer.
---
Yikes.
---
That one group had someone with three functioning brain cells who knew to dps the mines. They have ~200 health, and they don't detonate early, but several can be dropped at once. Any dps that is at an appropriate level for the dungeon should be able to kill a land mine on their own inside that 10s window.
---
The best way to handle it is to stress how important it is to kill the mines. Kill them yourself if you have to, it'll be easier for you to heal whoever's left alive through the mob dps than to outheal the absurd dps of those mines.
---
Its fun to watch if you are a fan of the Warcraft series. Wish the wouldve done the story of Arthas and the scourge instead though.
---
A lot of healers will panic and stop drinking to start healing early. Then because they didn't drink they actually have mana problems and you wipe or take deaths.
---
Definitely not but if you get scammed Blizz won't do anything about it
---
They are literally interchangeable. The vast majority of people spamming these groups use the term spell cleave. Get over it.
---
You're not meant to stay in that zone all that time. 11-30 you should be bouncing around the barrens, stonetalon and ashenvale.
---
These are getting old.
---
mods delete this
---
Yeah but which addon shows the vendor price?
---
They were the first that started discriminating against MAIL WEARERS so fuck them and fuck those pesky idiotic aoe noob groups.
---
If you can build the rage quickly enough and can stand being in berserkers stance for a sec, charge -&gt; bloodrage -&gt; sweeping strikes -&gt; whirlwind (&amp;berserker rage) is a great opener
---
Just put each on a new line
---
/ use big mana some
---
/ use smaller mana stone 
---
Etc
---
Game will use first available
---
Spellcleave is a group composition, AOE is area of effect damage
---
Thanks :) I did know that but maybe some others did not. So useful!
---
Daring today, aren't we?
---
 Also as a rogue, offer to pick lock boxes in town for other players. Have gotten several 50s tips for 30 seconds of my time.
---
Yes, please. As your tank, I want you to be comfortable as the healer. #1 priority. That means I'll wait for you to have significant mana before I pull, unless you say otherwise.
---
&gt; What should I do to be able to acquire a mount at 40? I need some kind of strategy, it seems to me that questing and AH aren't enough to make money at the moment;
---
Actually, they are. If I had ignored my professions and sought out the biggest money quests, I would have easily had my mount at level 40 on my warrior.
---
I suggest picking up an addon to tell you the vendor price of quest rewards so you know which ones to grab, but as a general rule of thumb: 2h weapons, then 1h weapons, then biggest slot, then tier of armor. For example, a cloth chest will generally vendor for more than leather gloves, and so you should take the chest as your quest reward to maximize profits.
---
I was wondering that myself..  isn’t this a monumental achievement of crafting
---
I love when people come in trying to act superior and get it wrong. The term came from TBC arena not wrath.
---
Please stop ruining my immersion. Back in 2004 we didn't have these other land masses on the map, and when I play Classic, in my brain it is 2004.
---
If the best day you've ever experienced is drowning someone in WoW then your life is dull as shit. There really isn't any debate.
---
Wow thats pretty damn dark, and funny as hell :D
---
Different instructions from the game on how to render 2 different things example being you can move the character around not the background environment
---
Personally I really loved the horde garrison because it was nice to have the original horde aesthetic that I fell in love with back.
---
After they abandoned the bone, hide and wood in wrath and cata in favor of steel and brick it just never felt the same.
---
Even after spending so much more time in new org, coming back to true org in classic felt like nothing had ever changed and it had always been bone and hide as far as the eye can see/
---
So tired of these posts after a nooby had a bad dungeon run and pretends theres a retard in the group every single time
---
You seem to know your stuff so I don’t want to correct you but I watched a video by Kargoz (I think)that spoke about DPM and Holy Fire was the worst, with smite being the best until mid 40’s where mind flay picks up. He normally does a lot of research and uses other people to help, are you sure you’re correct? Again I’m not correcting you so much as trying to find out the right one because I’m lvling a priest myself at the moment.
---
While we're at it, can someone let me know who's on first?
---
I have experienced the real world. Punching people for making jokes doesnt get you far in life. Being a violent asshole is a good way to end up in prison.
---
Then why tf do we have so many Chinese guilds on Faerlina lmao
---
Strange. I didn’t even see any other alliance near me. Thanks for the info
---
Yeah, I'm 58 on my rogue and haven't seen any. They are on lock down right now. 
---
Someone tried to sell me the gloves for 300g...pass
---
They literally make business contracts with  the elementals
---
I think its fucking disgusting the amount of people who think this is an ok normal thing to do. The guy was making a joke, it hurt literally nobody.
---
Sounds like some goblin bullshit lol
---
Ah ok. Then I misses it completely. 
---
Thanks
---
which is like, 50g as a level 14.
---
or maybe i just have poor money management skills.
---
Yes, I understand that, but so does screech. But I feel that giving it claw just means it will use screech less
---
Your graphics in general look way nicer than mine but most obviously the lighting effects- am I missing something? I have my setting all high.
---
To be fair, rejecting you for being the warlock is just as legit as you rejecting someone else for being a rogue or hunter.
---
I did this today on my rogue finally. Laughed for a good couple minutes.
---
Plot twist they’re all of the other faction.
---
Fucking lava runs in BRD, so much time wasted.
---
Yes.
---
&gt;"You guys didnt have a 1v1 of same lvl with same gear and same fps/ping, didnt handshake and count down from 10 before starting your world pvp so it's not true world pvp smh"
---
A 60 killing a 15 in redridge is world pvp. It's not anything to brag about tho. In the same way, it's completely valid to point out that it was 3v1 and they're kind of bragging about it.
---
There is a difference between making a joke and being an obnoxious dumbass to get people upset. You sound like someone that got an award for last place growing up and it shows.
---
You saved your kitty!
---
It is very cute and thanks for posting.
---
People are stuck in 2005. The easiest dungeons I had while leveling up (and even BRD Emp) were without a dedicated tank entirely. 1 healer and 4 dps is just faster and smoother. No mobs hit hard enough to justify sitting on your hands for 10 seconds every pull while the tank gains threat.
---
Your comment is pure trash
---
Why was this downvoted? The guy refuses to bring certain classes. Fuck grouping with that moron.
---
Its not a term for aoe, its a term for split dmg with casters. It emerged in arena pvp.
---
Groups like Warlock+Balance Druid+Healer is called "spell cleave" because you dps multiple targets (cleave) with spellcasters.
---
From there more novice people with less understanding of the term has started using it as a general name for just having multiple casters use aoe in any situation. 
---
People could just say "aoe farm" and it would basically mean the same thing as most people mean with "spell cleave" these days.
---
&gt;ironic
---
I don't think that word means what you think it means
---
Hunter concussion shot, paladin stun and fear seem to hit me 90% of the time even though I’m 60 and they’re 30 or so
---
I died at "we need some milk". My wife just watched in confusion. Well done.
---
I was never trying to force a "one-size-fits-all" playstyle on anyone. I just don't like seeing misinformation spread because of how one person plays. Sometimes the sub-optimal thing is much more fun and I enjoy that too. But it's important for new rogues to understand just how good SnD is every situation. 
---
I think Eviscerate is naturally a more "satisfying" finisher and so I get it when people skip SnD in favor of it. It's just not mathematically, over hundreds/thousands of mobs, the "best" thing. 
---
As far as the numbers go, you have to remember it's not concretely 50%, I was using that metric as a basis for my argument. But I would say that poisons are probably a rogue's least impactful damage source; something like 5-10% maybe, if you have optimal weapons (fast OH for more procs). 
---
One final point is that the choice between Evis/SnD can also depend on your weapons. If your weapons aren't up to date, then Evis increases in value because it deals a set amount of damage. STILL, SnD will probably be more damage-per-resources, just not to such a large degree. 
---
If your weapons ARE up to date, then Evis loses value to SnD because the increased weapon DPS doesn't factor into its damage, but it DOES factor into SnD.
---
I happen to be a mage but I'm only running normal groups and never really had trouble. And I see tons of other classes around, not really that many mages since they're spamming presumably. 
---
Considering how many people are playing it's probably harder to find people than it should but it doesn't feel harder than normal. It always boils down to waiting for a tank in a grp of 4 and spellcleave doesn't even use tanks.
---
So really quick, run into the building with Qia for me and when you get in there, look right and left of the doorway. There are literally 2 guards in the building. Now go ahead and stand on the ledge or anywhere that isn't the specific spot that doesn't trigger guard aggro and try to attack someone. Notice how the guards immediately attack you? But somehow when you stand in JUST the right spot, the guards don't attack? Man, almost like it's a safe spot similar to how the guards don't attack you when you're on top of gadgetzan's dome. 
---
If you think that camping the spot in Qia isn't against the rules, you're probably one of the people doing it. You can keep doing it, but anytime I see it, I record it and submit a ticket with the linked video.
---
Definitely subscribing. Thanks for the laugh!
---
I agree. Once I got to level 28 or so on my paladin I just started healing full clears of SM. It was pretty fun being severely under leveled but still pulling it off. Mograine is still ?? haha
---
I know, we got annihilated! Hopefully this gets some attention quickly.
---
Well the game isn't really to scale. If it was to Scale it would probably take about the time to traverse from one end of Eastern Kingdoms to the others, just by going through the Elevynn Forest.
---
It's legitimately okay to use Hamstring spam over Heroic Strike spam. It does a small amount of damage, but it is 1) instant 2) has a low cool down 3) has a low enough cost that it is better rage to damage ratio 4) can proc overpower and other abilities 5) doesn't eat a white attack.
---
There is a reason it got the nickname spamstring. ;)
---
All three.
---
GJ
---
There is no why nor what but just.
---
In my FFXI days, we called it a Mana Burn.
---
&gt;they love pvp and stuff like that, idk why tbh
---
Probably because of the culture of "win at any cost" which is ingrained into them since childhood. Competitive games with p2w microtransactions are king in china. It probably scratches that "win at any cost" itch pretty well, especially since if you dump in more money than the next guy you can be king of the mudcastle.
---
Five curses and spite live in each gnome
---
This truth can't be ignored
---
The best way to get rid of a gnome
---
Is to throw that gnome overboard\~
---
Respeccing to Elemental at 40 is apparently really good. I don't plan on doing it, but you'd DPS goes up by a lot once you get Elemental Mastery. I'd say you should be able to get a decent dungeon group as elemental. Especially if you start the group. If you start the group they can't really complain about your choice in spec. :)
---
Agree.
---
I mean, its a rare long instance where i have to drink (once ive got some buffs other up), but unless some serious shit is going down everyone will be able to survive the forst 10 seconss of a a pull.
---
Me too, actually. Even though I'm night elf. But the first "big adventure" I get is the Aquatic Form quest. I need to get to Westfall to do it. Ironforge is defintely the coolest city.
---
Try "/equipslot 16 weapon name"
---
I asked for proof of the exploits even being possible mate. Not at all doubting that they would if they could because literally all cultures have been abusing layering where poaaible. Now do you have evidence or not?
---
Reddit is the dumbest of all of them.  People here just try to sound smart.  
---
I'll take raging ESLs over some guy writing an authoritative essay on something he's clueless about.
---
Bloomoo (Blaumeux) is fantastic. Pretty even faction balance, usually high pop but never any queue times. I've loved it and recommended people to join and they have loved it so far.
---
Yes

2h axes personally and work towards sweeping strikes and you have a class quest at lvl 30 might want to look that one up. I personally have a macro to switch to shield and sword and cast defensive stance, and a 2h battle stance macro. You should get ravenger from scarlet armory. And keep a button to switch to that weapon whenever you want to aoe (even lategame). It’s helpful to have a friend help you with your whirlwind axe quest, at like lvl 32 you can begin farming the materials for it. Another secret to limiting downtime is saving 5-6 bag slots for gear with high spirit, and whenever you get a piece of gear that has higher spirit you replace an old piece. Then create macros to swap between your fighting gear, and this spirit set, it’s very easy to do and you aren’t replacing gear every level. When you do this you no longer need to buy food ever again, just make sure the macros are up to date. I am level 46 and my spirit set gives me 130 spirit, I heal so fast, I can swap gear on my mount to heal, and if I need to heal faster I just bandage. It’s helpful to have high stamina on your spirit gear as well so you don’t lose health when you swap gear. 
---
Also, you either face tank mobs with demo shout, or you hamstring them, run away, and try to match auto attacks 1-1 with the mobs, it’s a learned talent but if you can hamstring you can get away from most mobs about to kill you. SAVE money though you don’t want to be mountless Larry at 44. You only need rank 1 shield bash, rank 1 revenge, rank 1 thunderclap until later etc. GL
---
You took the words right out of my mouth.
---
Wish you had a lock eh?
---
Half of tanking is having balls the size of the ZF temple.  If you fuck up, so be it, your balls are still giant.
---
You are the tank, and you are the best damn person in the dungeon.  It doesn't matter what anyone else says or does.  You are an impenetrable wall of manliness and you'll be damned if you're gonna let somebody else slow YOU down.
---
no i have 100g as a warrior at 40 because i vendor stuff and dont buy unnecessary spells
---
I was doing 35k xp/h farming mobs in Eastern Plaguelands and leveled from 58 to 60 only farming trash mobs while camping Black Lotus spawn spots. Disc/Holy spec with Spirit tap so I could just keep pulling mobs one by one. I swear I could out dps most classes with Smite spam
---
You do realise that you can turn a goat into a sheep as well in this game, right?
---
Now that's magic
---
Just kill the mines or backup. They don't have much health
---
Top PvP guild...
---
You do realize the mages you see in the world aren't spellcleaving...
---
They might consider it after being corpsecamped tho.
---
Uh, false. You lose health, first a little, then more and more until you die.
---
GL gathering up all the mobs to AoE down without a tank.
---
I played all vanilla, all tbc, all wrath and never received a boe world drop epic. Yes I am very salty.
---
Darkfall would like a word
---
Mages and sometimes warlocks
---
I’ll take “Things that didn’t happen for $1000, Alex”
---
Yeah mate ...I love classic beyond description but honestly wish I could play it with new graphics. Only new character models would suffice :p but nevertheless having classic again is a great already :) maybe blizzard gives the option as a feature if enough players demand, who knows.
---
Appreciated and understood :)
---
Play however you want to play.
---
Unfortunately there are people out there who like to pass judgement on other people because it makes them feel good, but that’s humanity unfortunately.  Try not to let the haters bring you down, there’s a lot of them in WoW, whether it be classic or retail.  
---
There’s an argument to be made that once you hit cap in either retail or classic, then it’s all about the loot.  But who cares how you get there, if you have fun leveling, and taking your time and exploring, etc, go for it.  The dungeons can be completed with green geared people as long as people know what they’re doing.
---
Arena kids needed to name their 3s comps something edgy, now it's spread back to vanilla PVE.
---
What's the quest tracker addon you're using that shows more quests on the right?
---
Indeed, still spans 20 levels though.
---
I can think of two words from the early 40s that would trigger a lot of people. Imagine that. Just two words.
---
Filthy Horde scum
---
Dude, replaying the the Tarren Mill quest Elixir of Agony is so strange now. The finale of the quest is taking a barrel into the room with prisoners of poison so that they can be exterminated... and that's it. Nothing else. If that wasn't a Gestapo simulator there at the end I don't know what is.
---
Do you not read blue posts on WoW Classic? They literally announced they were hotfixing layer exploits in raids and supposedly punishing those who abused it. It's something a lot of guilds abused early on to get through MC as quickly as they did.
---
Yes ! This also! How did I miss that?
---
This isn't a brag at all, it's just funny
---
I would be mad if my parents fucked me over so bad and shat on every Christmas and birthday to make them so meaningless to me that I'd be able to drown someone in WoW and say "damn, best day ever".
---
Luckily I had a normal childhood.
---
Stranglethorn creates this.
---
You can turn on raid frames and turn on pets
---
Lol @ the morons in this thread thinking the purpose of this post is to brag
---
Again, at what point am I talking about the other guy? I'm talking about China. Stop straw man arguing me.
---
found the gnome
---
actually not a problem in most dungeons, and quite more effective.
---
Sure, and they don't post their stupid video so they're cool.  We don't need every asmon video posted here is my point.  Go defend your boy elsewhere.
---
And? What's your point, my original comment addressed the Chinese guild who literally exploited their way to a hand of sulfuras in 1 week.
---
You playing inside Blackrock mountain
---
I’mnot very good, but holding threat on lock dots is not hard. Your shadow bolt crits, however... that’s a harsh one.
---
Yeah, you still sound really mad tho
---
Blink only costs mana though.
---
They use the term spell cleave for horde at least because with shamans there's also a melee cleave composition.
---
Body pull a group then rotate novas to keep them in place? Although I agree I'd rather have a proper tank to pick up stragglers.
---
In the name of the Light! Exorcise this thing!
---
It kinda gave me hope people younger than 18 actually play wow. I hopw ot's that and not a bunch of immature adults.
---
My main gripe has been the edgelords though. (ofc the nice people outweigh the negativity)
---
Yes , good point.
---
I used to be a depressive person so I'll reply seriously in case you're not joking. I hope things get better for you, I can only speak for my experiences and I found that trying new things  help a ton! Whether it's playing a whole new genre of games (like an mmo for me), or trying a new place to eat that you never had before.

Dwarves are my absolute favorite race in any game and it always makes me a little sad when people call them ugly. 
---
But your comment makes sense, especially given the stats I was looking at the other day, showing Dwarves as the least played Alliance race.
---
No commands from me, I just use the wow classic app to start it up. Sure I have to log in when I'm there, but I don't have to go through and select classic from the battle.net app. Find the WoW app in your computer and put in on your desktop/dock
---
Warrior tank here.
---
This post really embodies what I've been trying to explain to every group at the beginning of each dungeon. Some do it at first and then get impatient, starts pulling more and whatnot - I... WE tanks need time to build up threat and can't do shit about it without much rage that we get from the mobs... Sorry not trying to repeat you, got out on a tangent.
---
Here the other night in Uldaman I got told that "Only noobs use CC" due to me marking every pull with at least a skull (otherwise it's wack-a-mole playing threat catch-up), got told to "Full sunder stacks" the mobs and "Wow nice tanking" for each wipe due to not being able to keep aggro because either
---
1. Dps or healer pulled with their wands
---
2. DoTing them up before I even got to the mobs 
---
It's already a...challenge...with all of the above but when you start lecturing me on how to tank without understanding why - I just lost it
---
Nope, no more
---
Started explaining why said thing is very very hard to pull off and that I'd leave if this continues on
---
Usually I just focus on the task at hand and don't speak much during the dungeon but this had me going 
---
Oh the backlash
---
"Is it the time of the month?" - From the healer
---
"Omg dude just learn to tank" - Dps
---
"Are you for real?" - Dps
---
No comments from the last dps
---
Was I in the wrong here? Do keep in mind that  everybody was in a good mood at the beginning and I always try to have patience and understanding of not everyone knowing how things work which is why I'm willing to explain in a calm, polite manner at the beginning where most go "All right" / "Gotcha"
---
Woah! That's 0.71667 Yetis per minute!
---
No, you start taking damage but it takes a few seconds from when you run out of breath before you die. Just happened to me 2 days ago.
---
Yay
---
Even after hotfix the queues were massive before.   
---
Not many people used free transfers as the realms where you can transfer to are pretty much ghost towns. And I mean real GHOST TOWNS - on Dragonfang EU right now there are SIX level 60 players online on the realm, while Shazzrah EU(realm with open free transfer to said Dragonfang) has couple hundred level 60 players online right now.   
---
And again they greatly reduced numbers of layers. Less layers + smaller queues = massive decrease of playerbase as server cap shrank and so did queues.
---
Nice! 3v1 and he has to pay Rep costs...
---
So proud of you...
---
...
---
Classes with bad effective time per kill get more benefit from running quests than classes that kill quickly. While it's quite optimal for a mage to aoe farm mobs with a low quest drop rate, doing so on a solo warrior is significantly more questionable.
---
This actually came up for me with natural materials in feralas. Terrible drop rate from mobs that are good to AoE farm and my mage friend laughed and said he loved that quest.
---
Destination wrecked! Nice work
---
How do you get numbers and % on your hp/mp bars?
---
AYE.
---
Lol imagine caring this much about some shit like this and defending it.
---
Your edit is racist and also untrue. You're just parroting what you heard elsewhere.
---
Shadow priest should kite it just fine. With improved SWP it can make it a little easier. Dot, run, fire off a mind blast every now and then and run in circles. You got this 🤟
---
Stop washing everything racist. It's literally part of chinese culture to cheat as much as possible. These are facts.
---
I started a new shaman after getting 30 on my lock cuz I didiny like my shamans race now I have a 34 shaman and a 20 shaman and a 30 lock lmao
---
I see what you did there.
---
Can you not log into a different character?
---
Well, griefing is even punished by Blizzard so I don't quite agree with your approach. I agree that killing other side ia ok. but not griefing.
---
&gt; There is no point to use this vernacular. It's so stupid and pointless.
---
It's literally the name of a specific comp and conveys more information than just "AoE." I don't understand why people are salty about this.
---
I tried to do this to several horde. They were all undead though, so fuck my life.
---
Totally agree with this. I’ll position myself in LoS, and let the tank take a little damage.
---
I tell every group that unless they are the healer, if they pull aggro on a mob, especially if I have marked for a focused kill order, they get to be the tank for that mob, I will not even try to taunt off them.
---
YoUrE jUsT nOt CuT oUt FoR pVp, Go RoLl PvE ScRuB
---
Keep the strawman arguments up, has nothing to do with being salty or toxic. Sorry if you're so easily offended that facts bother you.
---
"Unless you farm for tons of consumables" doesn't count when everyone really should be. Being honest, ret is terrible for raiding. Pve paladins should be holy at 60.
---
Ret is the best leveling spec for paladins, not close. If you're not completely chaining dungeons all the way up, you should be ret. You can still heal dungeons by switching out to int and heal gear.
---
Regeneration:  I'm regenerating 5 health per second and there's nothing you can do about it.
---
Even then, would they really be dicks in that situation if all they're doing is trying to build a specific composition?
---
Dude's just salty there's a group type he doesn't get invited to, so he has to take it out on randoms because their class has its own meta
---
If my button lights up I press it. That's my pvp guideline
---
&gt; I mean that even after the hotfix the queues were massive compared to queues that we have now.
---
No, they weren't.  With the exception of a few PvP servers, queues were non-existent. [Oh look at all these **dead** server](https://imgur.com/a/ZLvUCcx)
---
&gt;As for new servers, you used them to explain lower number of players on big realms
---
No, I didn't.  I explicitly stated that they had to open up new servers to allow transfers, not that it caused lower players (which honestly speaks volumes to your logical thought process, that I have taken the stance that people aren't leaving the game and that there are low volumes of people, two completely contrary positions)
---
Look man, it's pretty clear you're just here to hear yourself speak so I'll let you have the last word you so desperately need to feel you won.  It will go unread.
---
AoE and spellcleave aren't the same thing though. You can run a lot of different AoE comps that aren't spellcleave.
---
I’m not missing them. Just under 30% of US pvp servers are more than 50% alliance. [Here, see for yourself.](https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community) Not sure 30% qualifies as none? Yes, most are. But not all as you implied.
---
Edit: you are not the OP I was responding to. You said nearly. The original guy said *all*.
---
hey man,
---
the room at the end of BRD where you need to light the torches to open to door has constant respawns, theyre non elites, easy to kill. All you need is a warlock to eye pull, some sort of tank, and 2 mages + heals. The warlock does nothing except send eyes into the room to continously pull packs. If he knows what he's doing he'll pull from deep in the room giving mana drinkers enough time to be ready by the time the next mobs get there. 100k+ per hour is easily attainable with a decent group which does equate to a level every couple of hours. You don't even have to leave the spot as they respawn so fast, you're getting terrible xp per kill like 16-20 but as you're killing so many of them at a time it's efficient. If the guy you're replying to was torch farming he was killing way more than 530+ mobs every two hours more like 10,000.
---
Whilst there was no need for him to call people terrible, if you want to stand in the same spot and do the same action over and over again it is good xp. It's boring as shit but I did it for a couple of levels.
---
You don't need to clear the dungeon either, you can just lava run to the end
---
Auctionator is probably the simplest out of the trio of auctioneer/TSM/auctionator in my opinion.
---
Just do a full scan every so often(sub 10 secs on my PC) and the only way it "intrudes" on your gameplay is it will tell you what an item vendors for and what it sells for on average at auction.
---
It's just the nature of dungeons, they've always been a pain to group up for. I'm a mage and get spammed with spellcleave invites but I have no interest in spamming dungeons for exp.
---
So it's not because you're a rogue, nobody cares I'm a mage when I look for a group, because I'm not looking for spellcleave. Dps is easy to find and any will do in your average dungeon run.
---
Iirc theyre just blackmailing the enslaved elementals?  Drilling the earth as an earth totem, burning non renewable resources for fire totem, etc.
---
Key words being "in dungeons". Do you have trouble reading? There either is or isnt proof of layering in RAIDS. We are talking about layering in RAIDS not dungeons. Take your buzzwords elsewhere dude. Your lack of reading comprehension skills doesnt mean I am gaslighting you. All I want is for someone to provide actual evidence of layering in raids, or admit these guys probably just got lucky.
---
Maybe if I drown a guy in WoW I'll get to feel how it's like to be alive!!! I mean, I did get to fall in love and experience my first kiss and birth a child and meaningless shit like that. But if I could only drown someone in WoW then I'd get to TRULY live!
---
They are useful to help optimise your rotation when learning the class plus it's just fun to see how much damage you do.
---
I had a couple gold at level 14.
---
Maybe I just got lucky.
---
I'm guessing you where doing this on Mograine today?  Yeah, you're on my KOS list, buddy :P
---
*ready steady go plays in the distance*
---
Well thanks for noticing!
---
So post a fact that chinese used layering (in raid) for that. I will wait.
---
Because I was busy hanging out with my fellow druids in Ashenvale
---
What even is this post?  Explain yourself.
---
Hunters can get locks pretty regularly.
---
Except most never did that, they flooded battlegrounds and made them unplayable for lowbies.  Twinks were a terrible thing in the game, and they get butthurt when called out for that.  Low skill for easy kills.  I pray one of the "quality of life" things they leave in the game are keeping twinks in their own corner to troll it out.
---
Reading is hard.
---
Fair enough. If it’s happening I expect videos will surface once they’ve been banned. Time will tell I guess.
---
You're absolutely insane. There are posts on this very subreddit admitting to layer exploiting MC and some guilds ending up with multiple bindings and eyes.
---
Clearly you don't read this sub very often because anyone who checked it out earlier in the week saw nothing but posts about raid and dungeon exploits via layers.
---
My PC was so bad during Ulduar that i had to go through the gauntlet on Thorim, to the annoyance of my raid leader. My rig simply couldn't handle all the adds in the main room.
---
I was told that China only wanted mobile games with tons of purchases.
---
The map makers wanted their own personal vacation spot, so they erased them from the original map and just put a giant “storm thing” to deter travelers
---
But I’m new to healing so I just gotta learn to heal before I can confidently heal with little mana
---
what? Just because League is eaiser to get into doesn't easier to master. It's extremly hard to master.
---
- Best regards a diamond league player since season 3.
---
My favorite os always the guy thay even when you tell them there is an issue they ignore you.
---
I was tanking an sm run and told our priest that if he bubbles me (it had happened already i wasnt just saying it like some douche at the start) i cant get rage.
---
Asked a second time. The second time i was met with "just deal with it" 
---
I started clicking off the buff every time he put it on me, but damn, people like that suck.
---
The best part is that different writers took each dungeon and you get their perspective of the meta and the quirks of the dungeon. Very good bedtime reading.
---
I may get dvoted to hell here, but I really enjoyed updated Org when it came out.  It felt so different from everything else in the game, and super end-of-the-world barbaric
---
you could make simple graphic that will show you some tell that its safe to swap stances when u have less than 25 rage. 
---
trigger one would be less or equal 25 rage
---
trigger two if u r in stance you want to swap from (so the graphic wont show when you r in correct stance and dont want to swap)
---
maybe the second trigger could be replaced with load setup, dont know right now, im not on my pc,  check if there is stance setting in load tab
---
Wut?
---
Idk what you’re smoking but Night Elf is easily the worst starting area for alliance
---
Did the same, it's recommended to get to around level 30 as ret but if you want to level quickly that means dungeon farming, the best way to do that is respec to prot, for you're level you'll want to go to Scarlet Monestary till 40ish
---
It's just easier to get groups as a tank than dps specially if you're going solo. Eventually tho you will have to respect again into holy around low to mid 50s but, that's just if you want. Otherwise if you plan to just keep questing then 100% stay ret  Casue of you think that's slow is NOTHING compare to other pally specs trying to quest.
---
Yeah you already said that up above. It was already explained that it's an expression to you and shouldn't be taken literally, but you'd rather spew your shit then whip out an ounce of common sense.
---
If you're so starving to debate someone find something more important than semantics smh.
---
Please help me make a macro. I am a troll priest and I want a macro to go berserking into flash heal. I tried making a macro but it only casts berserking and not flash heal.
---
Alright thanks
---
Yes. \*laughs in herbalism\*
---
No Boolean operators needed. Just search for &lt;class&gt; &lt;level range&gt; for what you need and spam. I usually get tank/or heals within 5 min.
---
Yeah that’s what I’ve been doing. I just didn’t know when to make the leap into full holy. 
---
Also, does it matter if the +int gear is cloth/leather at late game?
---
Again stop with the straw man arguments. I stated chinese cheat and that it's in their very nature.

Regarding the question on what professions you will be using - please change this to not require two answers. I am only levelling and intend to use enchanting, I don't plan on using another. If I fill in my answer with a profession I don't plan to use it will skewer your results.

I cannot even skip the question.

What part was a bad rate? Had 1/1 in Hinterlands, maybe 1/2 for the 'rare thing', rest 1/1  
---
Ninjaedit: genuine question,  not bragging

And maybe if you took a hyperbole reply to a hyperbole comment as being completely sincere you'd be the fucking moron. Which you did. Which means you are. Grats.

Hello, fellow Kromcrusher! I was out grazing in Mulgore and couldn't be there for the slaughter, but know that my spirit was with you.
---
Take mara for example though - last boss can hit pretty hard and you want her dead. She is 51 so ideally the dps should be a level where you dont get as many glancing blows and misses, as it means death
---
Shouldn't have toxic players in your guild lol there's a guild in my server called Arcis and now if I see anyone in the guild that wants help I explain why and decline

Just kill them. Problem solved

/Golfclap
---
It was painful for me as a pvper to watch you click on your spells.
---
Can you breakdown the video ? Or are you just looking for views ? My rule is as long as your not a high level ganking in a lower level zone with people clearly questing; let the pvp happen.
---
So you are just racist? I get it now.
---
I've never seen that new map because I haven't touched retail since MOP and it uPSETSME
---
have u tryed it without the [] arguments? just feed on first line and name of that food on second (with / commands) and without ;
---
A 'Elixir of Agony' series would be nice
---
It’s most likely because they share global cooldown. Keep pressing it. 
---
You can probably look up a blood fury macro to learn how to write one for zerking otherwise.
---
All warriors need to do is let me get out of combat for a splut second so I can start a drink, I'll already be as far forward as I can be. Just don't pull the next pack when the last guy is at 10%, then I'm losing 60% mana so we can go 1 second faster.
---
Oh and he was tanking btw.
---
Camping rooftops to ignore guards is ban worth. See blue post on front page with game master whicper
---
Is healing as ret with +int gear still good enough for SM and on? I plan on doing each dungeon about once or twice
---
Have you had your daily soylent ration?
---
Is there a trick to healing AOE heavy groups as a priest? I can do very well in most groups but as soon as I hit a group that is heavy AOE that pulls 5-6 at a time, it’s a zoo. I just don’t seem to have the mana when it’s three people getting smashed at once. Is it me? Should the tank be holding threat better(the 2H Warrior seems to be where this issue arises most for me)? It’s even worse because usually after two heals, I’m getting smacked and my heals are being pushed back(I’m essentially having to fade on CD).
---
Only if you're the ninja
---
Because of all the articles the last few weeks about "CLASSIC IS KILLING RETAIL" "CLASSIC POPULATION DROPS DRAMATICALLY"
---
all based on census data, so they stopped it
---
I think it was there to show true Forsaken intentions. From very beginning.
---
Hes not wrong
---
Yeah I had a 20 shaman I deleted for my mages name then remade him with a different race, that I actually regret. Wish I woulda just kept my original shaman with the name and race I wanted.
---
Now I’m just thinking of what I wanna do at 60 and how much time I’ll have. I really like the afk-ability of locks for world combat and shamans just feel like it’s gonna be so much to manage.  I know locks have a lot of stuff to worry about in PvP too; but I feel like I can still manage to have an impact on lock with way less effort.
---
My buddy is a warrior though so I know he’s gonna be pissed when I tell him I don’t want to be his pocket WF/heals.
---
I leveled as sub too, ambush spec, and respecced combat for thrash blade so I could set myself up to solo bosses. 
---
But sub leveling is really underestimated.  I spent slightly more time per mob waiting on gouge timers, but I took a lot less damage per mob.
---
I'm pretty sure I was actually faster as sub.
---
Those aren't the same thing. If I say LFM AoE I'll get a bunch of druids and shamans whispering me, and that doesn't work for the comp.
---
Dude there are TOTAL 121 players online on the Horde side on Dragonfang right now. What are we even talking about.
---
Get friends, alliance scum
---
That's hardcore man
---
The 100+ thousand dollars you are going to spend on diapers, food, school supplies, clothes. Ect. Ect. Over the next 18 years +college could be spent buying runs through naxx for T3 gear.
---
You only really need to go down the Ret tree until you get Seal of Command. That'll pretty much carry you leveling wise.
---
I'd recommend doing some form of Holy hybrid spec because it really is the best possible use of your character. That isn't to say you CAN'T do other things, but healing will be the easiest.
---
Like Fsr\_osrs said. This is a bannable action. They are camping the Orgrimmar rooftop where they are completely safe from the city guards. This was decided already back in 2005 to be a bannable offense.
---
Isn't respawning technically undying?
---
ah yes as opposed to a mad dash for the item and taking just as long if not longer
---
It's trivial with voidwalker or eye of kilrogg.
---
Equip slow AF 2hander, Charge, Blood Rage, Sweeping Strikes, Berserker Stance, Berserker Rage, Whirlwind. Swap to Sword and Board and continue like normal.
---
Let DPS start after the whirlwind never any issues. Berserker has a threat reduction modifier, but when you're smacking 4 dudes with a fat double damage whirlwind it really doesn't matter.
---
For real, I'm classified depressed (or have been in the past), and my grandma on my dad's side as well as my uncle on that side both killed themselves so I worry about my own mental state often. Upbeat music is insanely productive in improving my mood.

then you can do that
---
I think I've seen Sunder Armor used in 20% of my dungeon groups. It's safer to assume the tanks aren't playing as smart as you think you are as DPS.
---
Apparently the alliance on my server doesn't think so...
---
Nice.
---
Under interface there’s a toggle between numeric, %, and both.
---
You can make a test account and jump on a retail server. Shouldn't be much different in terms of ping.
---
Sub numbers throughout BFA have been in free fall. Retail has not been good.
---
no such thing here... almost no crime.
---
Excuse you, dwarves have *some resistances*? No friend, dwarves have Stoneform! It grants immunity to bleeds, diseases, and poisons. It can clear debuffs so you can bandage, it can break blind, and it even grants 10% armor to make one a little tankier for its duration. For me, it's on par with escape artist.
---
It's good to switch. I'd make a macro to do the stance-dancing (Battle Stance, Charge, Berserker Stance).
---
na yo
---
Or lvl 10 can't tell

Wtf are people talking about with clickers ? Wtf does that even mean

Jesus christ this is just sad.
---
Loving these. They're really making me want to re horde, well not this quest in particular but previous ones.
---
Are you actually this bad at comprehending hyperbole, or just bored and being a dick for fun?
---
Epic, not purple you language swine xdd
---
It takes one look at your comments to figure out they are all literal. Dont try the "I was just acting retarded" bit now.
---
This didn't stop gold spammers. I still get invites.
---
nice
---
I'd make an orc shaman but.... trolls get Raptors for free... quite a conundrum.
---
Imagine being this mad over using an expression you didnt understand.
---
Lol yes they did make a bad call
---
That's more than fine. A lot of the time the AOE starts as soon as my first white hit at low level.
---
Only thing that I ever saw mentioned was Esfand's MC run which is directly addressed by Blizzard. I too would like to see this Raid exploit posts.
---
I've been on both sides of the faction. It's an alliance thing. 
---
I'm all for killing the guy questing near you once or twice. 
---
Body camping a solo player as a full group for 30+ minutes is childish.
---
On herod they're going for about 1.2g each
---
Can confirm allies always let me finish my mob, eat and mana up and create pots before bowing and letting me get the first hit 
---
/s
---
Yeah, or lying
---
Did you just ignore the link to proof you are wrong?
---
Fuck. Me. Dead.
---
While they are raiding and you are farming their consumables right? ;)
---
Playing devil’s advocate? Raids are much less frequent and it’s far more obvious a ban-able offense.  On one hand you’re ignoring trash that would take [some trivial time to kill] and maybe a 5x/hr restriction. On the other hand you’re bypassing a 1x/week lockout on end game content.
---
But again, you have a point.
---
I can remember cursing the game when the boat would despawn and dump everyone off in the middle of the ocean to die. Invisible islands... makes sense now... I don't miss the boat rides, I do miss that time when boats got soooo bad that they had mage NPCs that would teleport you to the other dock. I was sad when they fixed boats.
---
Some people see it as a waste of time until phase 2 so there could be that, I’m playing 100% for the pvp but I tend to skip by a lot of kills at the moment because yeah it’s fun but it just slows down my leveling at the moment and doesn’t offer any reward quite yet
---
They don't work. You can't determine layer based off /who......
---
Why are you spreading blatantly false info. Takes all of 2 minutes to check this out.
---
Do your own legwork if you don’t like my source pal.
---
when I was leveling my warrior, I really appreciated staying in battle stance because I took the imp overpower talent
---
Brotastic.
---
Well played
---
I got 12 levels in SM without a tank, it isn't hard.
---
[OP wondering where all the tanks are.](https://media.giphy.com/media/hEc4k5pN17GZq/giphy.gif)
---
No, I didn’t. It uses the same census data that I’m talking about except doesn’t include my two filters which significantly alter the results.
---
Tell me why you think sub level 5 (thousands of level 1 characters) and inactive characters (not played for 14 days) should count if you want an accurate depiction of server population. I’ll wait.
---
fake news
---
Levels that close don’t really matter. And it looked like the other mage started casting first, although we don’t know the whole story.
---
I assume it’s based off the idiotic practice of calling anything that’s a comp “-cleave.” While some of these were actual cleave comps, what is referred to as spellcleave is definitely not cleave, which already had a place in the vernacular meaning spells and abilities that would target multiple enemies but not just an area of effect ability. Like a multi shot or the ability “Cleave” would be cleave, but Blizzard, Rain of Fire, Flamestrike would be AoEs.
---
I did this solo with sap on accident in STV. Was going for a clam shell or a herb and sapped an alliance warrior to get it. As I'm swimming back up I notice him taking damage and he died right before the top. Now I try to sap every underwater alliance I see.
---
Thats the tanks/dps fault. Tank should have aggro. Dps have crowd control.
---
Yes I am! The LFG channel looks active enough, and tons of alliance in open world so I can actually finish quests now :) and there were still alot of people on and playing even though I was up late playing at 2am
---
I’ve always been on both sides and yes it is a both sides kind of thing.
---
Macbook?
---
Auctionator
---
Your gear breaks when mobs hit you
---
Haha didn’t even notice
---
Here’s an equally useful anecdote. 
---
I’ve been on both sides of the faction. It’a both factions thing.
---
In my experience. You cannot get someone with granny strats branded into their heads to accept anything else over text chat.
---
They will not understand until you can speak it into them with your actual voice.
---
Text is not interactive enough.
---
Thx
---
Reckbomb paladins don’t work In classic. Just level as deep Ret it’s the best way.
---
Sounds like bad luck or weird server. On Mograine EU everything feels very laid back.
---
na yo what?
---
Back in the day I let my brother play My final fantasy 10 game and he overwrote my file with 40 hours of gameplay with his 20 minute career. I was so furious I never let him touch it again until I was 40+ hours back into it and he did the same thing. I beat the crap out of him and got grounded.
---
I’ve played with sassa, he’s a know it all dick that underperforms. Good for you calling him out
---
Ok so they can do this as long as they want until they get warned. So in other words they aren't getting banned
---
I’m sorry you fail to see the humor in drowning someone in the desert.
---
Wtf how is it so fast for you? It took me a minute to scan Silk Cloth. A full scan should take around an hour.
---
&gt;(tank and I were level 13.)
---
I assume you were doing RFC? You were pretty underleveled for that, especially if you were full clearing.
---
Try again with WC at level 18-20 and see how it works then. Remember to make every part of your heal count. Don't finish a cast of your 325 heal to clean up 200 points of damage.
---
It's because you turned your back on the light. No one resists healing, do what's right.
---
The return on investment is being able to craft two all-game (until naxx? Or really all-game?) Bis items. Big boy items. You could also go axesmithing and get nightfall and annihilator, both of which cutting edge raiding guilds will need multiple.
---
He does in New Orleans?
---
&gt;I'm finding that alot of my tanks aren't actually comprehending the statement though.
---
I thought that was implied, sorry.
---
Use both.
---
You should try drugs my man
---
Drowning someone in the desert. That’s pretty funny.
---
Lot of asshurt allies in the comments.
---
Try reading that again
---
Oh my God. I cannot wait for Arathi Basin.
---
Does anyone knows the macro for switching to a different spell on the same slot? 
---
So let's say Power Word: Shield is on 5. When pressed SHIFT it switches to Shadow Word: Pain and I can cast the shield with SHIFT+5. Would be appreciated a lot if anyone this this macro. :)
---
I never understood names like this. Who would want to be in a guild named that.... Horde weirdos apparently
---
exactly
---
today 200 hundred alliance took over gadgetzan and camped horde for an hour. then camped the graveyard when they rez sicked.
---
Feels good putting animals in their place.
---
Woosh

Chain heal :)
---
Phase 3, phase 2 is world pvp and phase 3 adds wsg/av.
---
I saw them at redridge and killed some of them but didnt know they are going to stormwind.
---
front stabbing is not a thing in classic bruh. Just did a UBRS run and I, a dagger rogue, out did the sword combat rogue in dps. Not by much tbh.
---
Point is daggers are fine, you just have to work more at getting dps.
---
You saying diamond is in the 50th percentile tells me I shouldn't discuss with you. Ignorant and false stats posting, not worth the time.
---
What?
---
[Good try dude!! Too bad nobody is going to fall for that excuse](https://imgur.com/gallery/5ZjKcmU)

Even if you're telling the truth that's a pretty retarded way to respond to a hyperbole and this phrase specifically
---
I tried rooting a warrior under water in stv but I think my rank1 wasn’t enough haha. Almost though.
---
Yah but it costs more to play on the Chinese servers because of tariffs.
---
How do i even install addons?
---
As much as people may hate to hear this and I’ll probably be downvoted, everyone rolling a sub-optimal spec should absolutely have known what they were getting into. This is a 15 year old game and that means most of it has been figured out by players. Can Ret Paladins and Enhance Shamans do good damage? Absolutely. Are they better than Warriors/Rogues/Mages, definitely not. This doesn’t mean your spec isn’t viable, but it does mean it will be harder to find players willing to give you the chance.
---
Every class/spec has it’s downsides. If you are playing a spec like Balance or Elemental Shaman or whatever, it is important to understand the consequence is it will always be harder to find a group. I honestly can only recommend these specs if you have a group of friends who will play with you despite this. If you do not have a good guild or group of friends to play with, I highly recommend a class or spec that won’t discourage others from playing with you.
---
This doesn’t matter to everyone, as many players have a guild who will take them, or don’t care about raiding. And by all means play what you want. But understand that the further you go into end game content, the greater the desire to bring “the best specs” will become. Even to raiders who are not min-maxing, taking sub-optimal specs just sounds like it will slow down the raid or make it harder. Even causal raiders probably do not want to spend more time on an MC run than they have to. Raid composition is a big part of that.
---
It is my belief that most guilds will bring a few players with specs like Enhance or Ret. But these spots will probably be limited and thus it will be hard to be “that guy”. Not to mention gear will probably come your way last. It is absolutely doable to clear naxx on any spec, but finding the group that takes you is going to be the bigger Challenge.
---
That 62s is looking pretty good right about now...
---
literally just alt f4 they cant mind control a disconnect lol
---
what u think he did with those skulls tho forrealtho
---
i thought that was the whole point of flash heal. that its less efficient but you can get it off quick in an emergency
---
Or put the points into another tree.
---
Stealth is not that important while leveling especially when you’re killing beasts that poison
---
/r/natureismetal
---
As a member of the alliance, I support this use of gnomes.
---
I don't understand. Spellcleave doesn't use a tank or healers aside from priests. That should leave a ton of people looking for groups who aren't mages/warlocks/priests. It should be easier not harder to form a group.
---
r/unethicallifeprotips

Yeah that is certainly valid but I just reckon there is would be something out there. I hope I'm not wrong and these guys just got lucky but in also open to the possibility. Unlike the other guy I was talking with.

I love how these threads are always full of people who think their class is the best

Well, I toyally agree with him.

People enjoy drugs so if you do them until you die you wont waste any more time ever. Its a fool-proof plan really

Dicks aren't that bad tbh

Now the real grind begins lol
---
I dunno if a reddit for a revival of a 15 year old MMO really counts as "in the wild". If anything, this is maybe the second most likely place you'll find former DAoC players.
---
I'm sure it was mostly my fault, but "hold agro better" is not constructive. I've since realized sunder armor is the agro skill. I was relying on mocking blow which not even working.

It uses the same census data that I’m talking about except doesn’t include my two filters which significantly alter the results.

Tell me why you think sub level 5 (thousands of level 1 characters) and inactive characters (not played for 14 days) should count if you want an accurate depiction of server population.

How is it being a dick to turn down someone from a group when you're specifically asking for other classes?
---
Going to the badlands today and had to go thru loch Modan it’s super nice
---
Dunno, i just use the full scan button. Probably the fact my PC has an i7-8700k with ~100Mb internet. If i'd hazard a guess the speed is likely a combination of CPU+internet speed mostly.
---
My server only has around ~20k auctions at the moment though(atiesh) so i don't know what it's like on a super full pop realm like faerlina or herod.
---
You either specify you want that piece of loot or your the ninja when putting on master looter and everybody will likely leave when you do that.
---
The new territory gets smaller and smaller each expansion.
---
nope, incendius. There have been a lot of these from what I've heard.

What realm you on, I’ll put it on my to do list
---
Drowning is actually multiple ticks of damage.
---
My thought was, more attacks, more chance to crit, more threat generated.
---
I'm using boar atm with Charge + Bite. Plan to swap to Wind Serp at 41. Boar struggles and misses constantly
---
As a former DotA2 players who believe that game is better than LoL. I declare that the Dota2 player base is just as pathetic as LoL's
---
Your main problem is that this loot system does not have a home. In a casual guild the main spec &gt;  off spec /roll system is better since it always feels fair. What prevents someone from ranking an item #1, getting that item  then ranking their #2 item as the new #1? This would mean someone could easily get priority over another player for every piece of loot for weeks. 
---
Example: 2 mages in a guild that start MC from day 1 together. Both look at thier BIS list online and end up with the same ranking for thier wish lists. Mage 1 gets thier #1 item the first day. Next raid lockout the #2 item is now #1. It stops and they get priority over the other mage since thier list still has it at #2. Repeat. If you don't allow people to update thier lists then your tiered system becomes more of a round  Robin where player 1 gets a piece and can't get more loot until everyone else gets loot etc.
---
In a hardcore guild this is just unusable since loot decisions should be made based on needs of the raid team. Keep in mind that the progression loot council is always the superior loot system for guilds that care about progress rather than how many purples a given individual  has.
---
So. I am a warlock and couldn't tell you what a spellcleave group is.  I just dot and drain life. Guess I missed the meta train.
---
Technically
---
All in favor to rename blessing of salvation into curse of nobuffs?

If youre lucky enough to get lionheart helm, stronghold gauntlets or titanic legplates plans you will will make bank.
---
get mining and skinning vendor skin sell ore on ah easily will have over 1g by level 14
---
There is also one from Durotar. This is why Gromgol is such a great hearthstone position. Allows you to travel to Undercity and OG real fast as well as access to Booty Bay and Badlands.
---
Done during vanilla as well.
---
https://youtu.be/KbZxtgsMej8?t=74
---
I don't get it. The rogues, warriors, hunters, shamans, paladins and druids could just form groups with one another. There are multiple options for tanks, healers, and dps in those classes.
---
56? .... close enough.
---
Holy shit. This is some golden age early 2000s shit with current decade memes mixed in. I was waiting for the extremely loud screaming kid in there somewhere. This is fantastic.
---
I have a mage named 'Squirt'.  Obviously for mage water jokes.
---
But I've also wanted to make a guild called &lt;Till It Hurts&gt;.
---
Globe makers circa 1490 would like a word.
---
Good point! I think it was silly for them to let us recover on a PVP server and clearly it turned out to be a waste of time for them not killing us.
---
Depends on the time of day you're playing and your server time, normally the sun isn't that low.
---
Flash is horribly mana inefficient and should be used only in clutch situations.  Heal/Greater Heal is the go to.
---
I... Didn't even say any of that... lol...
---
A whole bag though? What is the size of the bag?
---
Highly depends on how much spellpower you have as spells scale differently.
---
Generally speaking: Longer casts are better with low spell power, shorter casts are better with more spell power.
---
(mana efficiency, which is the most important)
---
For example at level 40 greater heal is more efficient than heal unless you have more than 50 spell power.
---
Also note that in classic int does NOT give you spell power. Only MaxMana and Spell crit. Spell power is the green text below which reads something like "increases damaging (and healing) done by magical spells by XY"
---
Add those up. Apply spell coefficient (can find those online) and check the heal/mana. 
---
Excel helps.
---
And another example:
---
Even with very little spell power, rank 1 Renew becomes the most efficient spell you can use.
---
Rank 1 Renew heals for 50 over time with a cost of 30 mana. It has a spell power coefficient of 1.0. I have 150 spell power.
---
Now Rank 1 Renew heals for 50+150*1.0= 200 over time with a cost of 30 mana.
---
Lmao get over yourself
---
Still better than my sister (28) I always cry when I see her play. She moves with arrow keys and uses a touchpad to click on spells.

Oh look, it’s this post again

ty this gave me the idea to change the soundfile for undead characters to the cod zombie sfx

Calling people you don't understand "weirdos" is another variant of social ineptitude.
---
Am I supposed to download an addon to enjoy using the auction house?
---
I go to buy something like wool cloth and the first page or two is just stacks of it with a one copper bid and a whatever silver buyout. The buyout isn’t the cheapest option for that stack size out of all the wool on the auction house, it just appears first because the bid is for one copper. 
---
The next few pages are just individual pieces of wool that aren’t very convenient to buy when you need a lot of it.
---
Wrong question. You should ask yourself how to utilize the 5 second rule to the maximum. Personally I mainly use Renew and Heal (+PWS for DPS) most of the time so I can just cast everything at once and go back into mana reg + wand mode.  
---
But to be fair I'm only lvl36, drunk and don't remember highlevel strats from Vanilla.
---
You ain’t lying! So many plot twists! I was on the edge of my seat.
---
I saw moose meat trying to solo this elite but kept getting gang banged by a 5 man running around in searing gorge. Thanks for helping a brotha out
---
/cast [mod:shift] Shadow Word; Power Word: Shield

---
Hots are pretty trash in classic. Healing touch all the way.

---
Fantastic! Echeyakee sold me. I have no idea what limitations online comics might have, but if it's possible to have background music to it.... Would be huge! Er like Sahalé - Magharibi for Darkspear trolls.
---
Ahh ok yeah, my server has about 1k on Silk Cloth alone. It probably is the internet that is lacking for me.
---
Ah, well, that's different. When you said main tank, I assumed raids, so my bad. 
---
I can't speak to UBRS, but you should be fine to tank any 5-man stuff at level 60.
---
There is zero chance of it being bannable. And it's a pretty basic qol thing really. Not using it is a big loss.
---
Christ. Not every guild is going to minmax this much. There's really no point in minmaxing in classic. And with normal progression, and not playing several years on a private server and getting all geared up, everyone will be shit. I was feral in vanilla. Always top 5 dps. Didn't even have the crowd pummeler because this sort of minmaxing wasn't a thing. Did have r13 gear and aq mace. The reason was because not every person in our 40 man raids had t2. It kind of takes time to get everyone geared up.
---
dps is boring though so I'm gonna go resto this time.
---
No, still shows as "out of date" but it detects that it is running on classic and displays correct auction times and deposit values
---
r/woooosh
---
Awesome! Thank you. :) How would that look with rank 1 for example btw?
---
And I guess its: /cast \[mod:shift\] Shadow Word: Pain; Pain Power Word: Shield

I'm just saying the more mobs you kill, you have more rng opportunities. Grinding vs. questing.

You should be.
---
&gt; me and a friend tried to get a group together for uldaman because we wanted too complete them all, and not a single person wanted to come. so we ended up duoing it
---
Try not playing on a dead realm, or at 5 AM. On my realm there's always groups running for any dungeon in the game. Takes like 5 minutes to put together a group for Uldaman. Also, what's wrong with leveling up in dungeons?
---
&gt; every single thing that blizz added was added because people are lazy, even those in classic are lazy as shit. they want the easiest and fastest option for everything.
---
Wanting to make the most out of your time and level up as fast as possible is "lazy" to you? I feel like that's the opposite of lazy.
---
Crazy to think about the fact that The Lord of the Rings came out 3 years before World of Warcraft was released... To me it feels like World of Warcraft is older, but it isn't.
---
It's more than fine.
---
The only thing I'd like from full resto is mana tide. Sham drinks a lot, and mana tide could save a wipe or just be used to pull faster.
---
I feel that would be insulting to my tank, to underestimate them like that. I can usually feel it out by seeing what the tank is doing. 
---
There's situations where you can't afford to cleave because of circumstances but I think that's a part of the game - figuring out when you cam afford to do what without pulling aggro. And yeah, it's really frustrating to lose aggro as a tank because your dps is impatient so I try to watch out for that.
---
Also D: what do they use instead then? Just heroic strike? Still generates extra threat at least I guess.
---
Something like
---
`#showtooltip`
---
`/cast [mod:ctrl] Rejuvenation`
---
`/cast [nomod] Rejuvenation(Rank 6)`
---
By leaving out the rank, it will cast the highest rank possible on that target. Which means if you try to heal a lower level, it will automatically downrank instead of giving "target is too low level" error.
---
class gating is a part of vanilla which is why i will continue to state that vanilla is absolute garbage it just has good FEATURES. IE no lfg, no lfr, no cross realm, no instanced zones, no layers (ohwait not yet). the content is all super easy, the gear pacing is shit, the class imbalance and choice is a joke... honestly the only reason im glad classic is even a thing is because it might lead to 1: a BC server (where the game actually became a good game) and 2: they might scale back some of the features from retail and make retail a good game again. seriously if we just had the same game state/class design mentality as pre LFG WoTLK retail would take the gaming world by fire with how good a game it would be.
---
The keyring is supposed to be added in Phase 2.

---
Love the SIMaAM reference! There are a couple of points I disagree with though.
---
The game itself didn’t change; the elite meta has. This is strange because usually it’s a change in the game that brings a shift in the meta, but whatever. The elite players are doing some things that were really hard to pull off in classic. And that’s cool. The problem is that not everyone is an elite player, yet these problem players hold hold everyone to that elite standard, even if they themselves aren’t able to play to that level. They’re the ones in a dungeon playing as if the other four party members are NPCs in a single player game. It’s a very selfish way of playing, and will end up getting everyone else tilted.
---
Also, you mention a tank that takes 30 minutes between pulls, which is hyperbole (and this is fine), but you’re comparing that hyperbole to a real situation, which comes off as disingenuous. The truth is, I’d much rather the dungeon run take 10 minutes more overall from careful pulling, than spending that much time or more with wiping and corpse runs. 
---
I’m fine with the idea of people putting together speed runs, aoe clears, cleave runs, whatever - as long as that’s what the group is advertised as. What sucks is having someone join a group and then they impose their xp per hour benchmark on the party. That needs to stop. Now.
---
Interesting I never knew that. It always looked so similar to the W3 broken isles rendition to me and the location was the same.

You learn it by speccing into it in the holy tree.  Once you do that you will be able to train the other levels.

Why do people give away the good spots lol it’s contested enough.
---
it's a talent, dont you have google?
---
I do this as well, but I have one thing I do differently. When I have a mage or 2 in the group I will use CoE instead of CoA with corruption, idk if it's better or not, but it seems like a good use for CoE and I haven't caused a wipe with it yet so there's that.
---
Everything is "justified" by TOS
---
The benefit of being a hybrid (at least in Classic) is that you can take on any role without too much of an investment for most of the game.
---
A Ret Paladin can heal or tank just fine provided you keep alternate gear sets, which you said you do.

So if it tickles your fancy, go for it. :)

See other comments about it. It's kind of a weird word that few people used for a long time and it got to be used more in the last little while, just as an alternative to the typical usage of cleave referring to melee-centric, multi-target dps.
---
Tanks and healers dint need tanking and healing geese to tank and heal. 
---
Of course you're fine getting leveling gear.
---
What would happen, if you and a buddy who are both priests dueled each other, then an enemy of the opposing faction comes along? You could mind control them, then the guy becomes your pet, then the person you're dueling could also mind control them, thus keeping them 100% under your guys control. Would that be how it works? Or is there something I'm not taking into consideration?

"Masochistic" is the one you were looking for, and *leader of the pack* is the shit

Damn, you right

Sounds like a hunter

If you train skills at a faction you are Honoured with (usually your home faction), you get a 10% discount. So it will only be 4g50s

why even xp farm at 53ish+, farm your gear at this point while getting xp
---
You’ll have an honor shield by your portrait.

Doubt it, it's trivial for a modified client to bypass hardware event requirements for the spammers. Not to mention there would still be plenty of targets in the global chat channels that you can pull user lists from. This one was definitely intended to stop census addons.
---
Why kill innocent players? The game is about finishing quests!
---
&gt; Previous guy is wrong. It's called a sequence macro.
---
Thanks for the downvote. Now kindly enlighten us all with your macro that casts four totems (or any other spell on the GCD) in a single hardware event.
---
Jesus+
---
Yeah, I have something similar (cat on V, travel/aquatic on T, bear on G since my Q,E,R,F are taken up by heals) I just have the stance bar with the default keys on there anyways.
---
Cat had the highest dps and therefore the most threat.
---
*snap*
---
yep, this one's going in my cringe compilation
---
Ele does not have nearly the aoe dmg of a mage. 
---
You have a big burst with totem off cd and then ticking on magma. 
---
But a mage pressing ae will destroy you on the meters.
---
Those islands are mentioned many times and were always part of the lore. It's a game design choice, you don't really want to have a map full of unvisitable locations.
---
There’s a guild on my server called &lt;Dead Gnome Society&gt; he’ll fit right in

You've been replying to everyone in this comment chain and I'm pretty sure you believe you aren't in the wrong here for being a fucking moron.
---
This must be the best day of your life.
---
Agreed i had 90 yesterday, im down to 27
---
Lmao people were actually waiting in ques to play then waiting in these lines that I would imagine took hours just to get one quest done. Yeah I think your missing something here. This is more sad then it is wholesome. It’s a game, and the funniest thing is I guarantee the majority of these people spent all day being a complete dick to every real person around them and then they do this to make them selfs feel better about their horrible personality. The people that participated in this are basically mindless sheep. Staring at a virtual que to then stare at a second virtual que of a line for hours on end.
---
I think we all need to remember we are all 15 years older now as well, we coordinate, we think differently. We quest and fight differently, and how many of us have modded the shit out of our game for QOL, which many of us didnt do in vanilla ?
---
How was it not due to layering? There's proof you can forcibly respawn dungeons using layers, a raid is no different than a dungeon. You can even 10 man raid dungeons if you want.
---
If u scan it with another addon, yes.
---
"Go For The Throat"
---
What sense does that make?

“But gently”

I got excited at the end when I realized Feign fooled them and I could have a pacifism party with the priest, but was too far gone... XD
---
Scanning for silk cloth means it looks through all those pages one by one, a full scan is a dump the add-on gets from the server, basically like a document with the entire AH, so that usually only takes a few seconds. They added that years ago so the server wouldn't be spammed with page requests.
---
How does this affect other zones?  The glowy green on Feralas and Ashenvale are pretty cool.
---
Awesome!
---
I've farmed all of the wood/minerals/sinews. Killed a solid 50+ creatures and I'm only 20/40 for the metal shards.
---
I think you got lucky. And no worries, I was just getting into a debate with party members about gearing so I got distracted.

Do they allow gold spammers? Western gold spammers should infest their servers...

Ive had my oozling for a week now and yeah, it does not turn your character green, only hope is to submit a bug report ingame, been getting my friends to submit reports as well

typical alliance comment
---
If we're talking about OP I'm thinking dime bag.
---
If thats the case then it speaks more to your ability than to the class. If you were playing any other DPS class, I would expect you to outdamage your paladin.
---
I mean jokerd just rolled a mage just went 1-60 in 17hrs. Super effective and not hard
---
!remindme 7 hours
---
To be fair, northrend was on wc3
---
damn that’s a lot of bots
---
Agreed, always have a dwarf in the works. Like the Nelf start area too.
---
I remember seeing them recruiting when I was leveling in the barrens lol just hit 42 yesterday, if you are in that range let me know
---
Yes, because everyone will immediately be decked out in t2. That's how it works. This isn't about class, this is about gear. And yes, when everyone's decked out in the best of the best - druids won't be able to outdps them. So, not for a while. And so what? There's 40 people in a raid. 15 people could be afk and you could still do it. Why be such a tryhard minmaxer?
---
That's horde for you.
---
For attention on reddit mainly
---
You're doing God's work.
---
Im elemental shaman and I like to heals in dungeons whenever I can but lets say that theres a group looking for 1 dps to go to a dungeon and i ask for invite as an elemental shaman? Do you think ill get accepted?
---
Side note, but I really hope the Pandaren get to return to that turtle someday.
---
Blizzard literally confirmed that case was not about layering. They also only ever mentioned layering exploits in relation to dungeons. Not a single shred of evidence has been shown that proves you could layer exploit raids. So yes dungeons and raids are different. If you can provide proof that it was or is possible to layer in a raid please go ahead because I would like to see it. Otherwise get your facts straight or dont reply again.
---
I see, thank you

Is that a recent meta? :D I did that on a pserver on my warrior because threat was a bigger problem than hp outside some bossfights.
---
And I mean going prot isn't really a thing when leveling unless you're doing something very specific. Tanking as a warrior just means defensive stance and a shield when necessary.
---
I'll never forget the rogue that ninja my gun in WotLK

I had about 2g by level 14.

Sunken Temple thematically and aesthetically is a cool dungeon. It had some really cool puzzles and encounters for a dungeon I classic especially. Very ambitious. Shame it's just no hard to navigate and filled with so much goddamn tedious trash... Yet even a nearly fill clear isn't enough to get the requisite quest items on one quest. 
---
Plus itmmthe whole thing just frustrated people, especially if you ever wipe and have to get back in. Hell, getting in is a pain too. 
---
Sorry for the rant, just went through this beast today for the first time in so many years. Love and hate it.
---
Who is the tank?
---
jesus
---
Benediction 4 lyfe
---
Yeah dude, spellcleave is just the fastest way to clear a lot of the dungeons in classic. It ends up being a shit show 90% of the time, but it keeps things interesting
---
I saw someone being a douche so I stepped in. You saw someone having fun. There's a huge difference.
---
This happens alot in retail goldshire
---
So because those people are idiots we can't say spellcleave anymore?  It's a short word to describe a specific comp, because generic phrases like "aoe farm" don't convey the full meaning.  
---
What exactly is the problem?
---
As an alliance player I aprove this.
---
Most underrated comment!
---
Dan.
---
Fucking. 
---
Schneider.
---
a coordinated group can do it super easy by staggering novas as new mobs reach the already novad mobs.
---
This is exactly the kind of stuff that makes me jump out of my seat screaming LOKTARRRR OGARRRRRRR
---
FORR THE HORDEEEEE
---
That's extremely far from a universally shared view. Regardless of how you feel, enough proportion of people naturally sniff unfairness and will balk. The game allows you to not share or help, but it comes at a social cost. Deal with it.
---
No you are literally using it the exact same way. The word hasnt magically changed definition over time.
---
Some did. Honestly, it would go a long way to explaining how I got an x-51 Nether Rocket for 60K in a world after garrison inflation.
---
My fear is random tbh. Usually the first one is the majority of the duration but subsequent fears are always noticeably shorter.
---
Thank you! Finally someone with common sense.
---
It's like your racism somehow counteracts other people's racism.
---
Generally not a bad strategy. Heal group to max and wait for your mana to regenerate.
---
However PWS is very very inefficient and should only be used if it allows you to wait an extra 6+ seconds before healing (depends on the amount of spirit of course). It also scales very bad with spell power so it gets even worse with better gear.
---
Lmao, I just maxed it out!
---
Honestly it’s a really fun start. As a lock you have to learn how to use the eye effectively to pull, position your char properly to Funnel the mobs to one side and the mages have to coordinate novas, pre blizzards and aoe. 
---
With a new group it’s rough at first but after a while you start really working well together with everyone and get better and faster.
---
More fun than questing imo. I’d do it even if it was a bit slower.
---
Whats the difference of an item that says damaging and healing effects + number to an item that says a particular school of magic like shadow or frost.
---
Pretty sure that’s a South Park reference
---
Call Blizzard.  Sometimes they have to unlock it for you.  Also, due to a holy nova class action lawsuit, you are entitled to 3 free months of game time and a unique spirit rez pet.
---
He's probably the priest and doesn't want any locks/mages stealing his cloth drops
---
Great post, and something I've always thought about. The game has so much nuance it's realer than real
---
So is my comment
---
popular opinion is suprisingly not a great indicator of how good or bad something is.
---
lets not forget the current american president was voted in by the majority.
---
 im not saying bfa is bad or good. but most of the complaints people have towards retail arnt bfa specific (atleast when talking about why classic is better)
---
theyre shit introduced during tbc/wrath or cataclysm lol
---
use vent instead
---
 #showtooltip
---
/castsequence reset=5 Strength of Earth Totem, Windfury Totem, Mana Spring Totem, Searing Totem
---
There you go. Mix and match the totems you want. Change the reset value to a number of seconds you want it to take before the macro returns to three first totem in the sequence you want. He didn't ask for them to cast simultaneously, he asked for a macro that would cast all of them. This does that. 
---
Before anyone asks, yes, you can use this to perform your entire rotation on a single button.
---
That "showtooltip" is supposed to have a hashtag in front of it, but the formatting causes it to bold.
---
As a fellow alliance rogue on incendius, congratulations bud!
---
&gt;I don’t think I’d want to group with you.
---
And I don't think I'd want to group with you either, if you think you're entitled to the loot I receive from leveling my profession. 
---
Why don't you go ask tailors if they'll craft you free clothes with their mats? Why don't you pester engineers about giving you an equal share of their ore?
---
It's the hypocrisy that makes me upset. And if the loot in those chests is "soooo worthless", then why do people care so much about rogues taking it?
---
He's rich
---
I see a priest/mage, probably dispelled it lol
---
Never trust the Horde.
---
Draw distance is probably set to low.
---
It can be done with every spec but why bother. It’s easier with pure specs and all strangers are the same so a healing priest is better than a damage priest.
---
It's bannable if guards can't get there. Then it's considered terrain exploiting.
---
Thanks dude!
---
I was in a group with a guy in a guild named RKellys Lemonade Stand
---
Or boomkin
---
Found the turner
---
Stats and Agro my friend
---
He’s a rogue
---
Well I think the hard part is finding someone who wants this exact tranfer out of all the available servers
---
I would look at the recipes available and see what peaks your interest. As a general rule, most useful things engineers can make can only be used by the engineer himself or another engineer.
---
Haha yea I was like no way.. no way they think he’s dead.
---
The repair guy gonna pay HIM  to repair his shit
---
Was just thinking how cool it'd be to get an (optional) visual revamp for Classic, kind of like how they've been doing for older games such as Spyro and Crash Bandicoot. Would be cool to see the old world in modern WoW's visual style, with updated armor sets and all!
---
&gt;you just have the last button press to open it
---
And yet, it's a button that is unavailable to every other class except rogues - and even then, only rogues who have taken the time to level their profession to the point where they can open it.
---
You still haven't addressed the double-standard. Why is it that people don't bother miners to crack nodes for them, or that herbalists harvest herbs for them?
---
God this one pisses me off to no end had a tank use it one dungeon.
---
I think technically Booty Bay isn't indoors, mounts are just banned there. That's why the icon shows up.
---
just cloak of shadows lul
---
Warrior and shaman aren’t spellcleave
---
Doesn't look like it'd have classic version?

https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/auctionator/files

Yeah thanks. I'll have to try an delete it.

It is mirrored, here's a screenshot I took when I climbed up there while leveling. [https://i.imgur.com/jJ3gWiz.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/jJ3gWiz.jpg)

auctionator will list all grouped by price and makes it a lot easier to see cost per unit and make informed decisions
---
These easily could have happened to me with the 6 horde I turned my back to fishing on the southern coast in STV. But the horde at the least will let a man fish (or they feel bad that alliance are fleeing our server in droves)
---
people have literally mastered this already lol
---
in SM you mostly use a locks eye of killrog and the priests barrier to allow for risk free pulls (you can pull a very large portion of SM cath at a time with this)
---
then ZF, varies between people. but alot of em just go 4 mages and 1 priest, then each mage takes turns mounting up and aggroing the mobs between them and GY. using block to bunch em together. then cone of cold + arcane explosion as the main dmg. with 1 mage spamming imp blizzard. (this isnt the only variation, but it is the most consistent one i ran into).
---
tbh its super easy to play classic without a tank lol
---
Ahhh ok thanks, this makes sense then.
---
Next expansion leaked?
---
Damn, that's a bummer.  Was hoping I could get the rare shield I won but didn't receive.  Would have equipped it on the spot but I was a level low.  By time I levelled and checked my bags (not full) it was nowhere to be found.
---
What’s the add on for the bag organization?
---
You can't even explain the difference between spell cleave and aoe so don't talk about obvious. And besides the term was created specifically to differentiate it from aoe so when people start using them interchangeably it's obviously going to lead to confusion.
---
***POWER FANTASY***
---
They Eye pull large portions of SM so that a bunch of trash runs to the mages instead of needing someone to run in and take damage from 30 mobs.
---
we knew they were there but everytime we tried landing a level 120 would hit us for 100 million so we just avoid them
---
I was in a queue of 8500 and the server kicked everyone off.  It put me in.  Therefore I can tell you at least 8500.  I would guess at least 10k-15k
---
Snake trap used to be able to flag people for PVP. Not sure if that is still a thing...
---
Just being in combat slowly loses dura, too

Hell yeah!

Good ol' Maeioptteh, keeping the loch where it should be.
---
WHO HURT YOU?!
---
I did 1 normal run of ZF after a full day of 1 priest + 4 mages speed runs. I had forgotten how long zf takes to do the traditional way Haha. It was pretty painful, to say the least.
---
One thing you can try is to form the group yourself and do 1 priest, 3 mages, and you. That is really the only way other classes can get into pug zf zombies. I saw a rogue doing that, I left the group, but thought to myself "I'm going to use that technique on my next toon too".
---
Yes I know, I meant Pandaria itself.
---
I found a few errors in my spreadsheet as well, but they were small in nature.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/formulas-spell-coefficients-classic-wow
---
This website lists the spell power coefficient of Renew as 1.0.
---
We tested it yesterday too, with 150 spell power it healed for ~165 (6 ticks *27.5). That's not 200, but a lot closer than your number.
---
Is it buggy or is wowhead wrong?
---
Also, about the 45 heal per 30 mana vs. 50 heal. Wowhead says 45, ingame tooltip (english) says 50 heal per 30 mana. Something is wrong here.
---
I just tried it ingame. 0 gear i get somewhere between 65-67 overall. After I removed my +Renew talent this comes out at ~57, but with 25.75 spell power due to talents. 
---
Looks like your 45 is a lot closer to the truth than the tooltip.
---
One of my favorite kills was an equal level rogue that was also training lock picking in the water in Desolace. I realized he hadn’t gone up for air in a while so I snuck up and sapped him...sits full duration, sap him again and it immediately breaks from a damage tick. He scrambles towards the surface but doesn’t make it. And I never unstealthed.
---
Lorewise, Kultiras should be 5 times smaller too. And btoken isles ofc, those should be, well, ISLES, as in not just two buta whole archipelago
---
Thanks for reply.
---
If you’ve got time to have multiple 40’s but still haven’t chosen the class you want to main you’re probably just playing for the sake of playing - a habit. In which case it doesn’t matter what class you choose , you lose interest at 40 because the game isn’t holding your interest past 40
---
If you're bad at pvp, like myself.
---
That 5 second immunity is useless lol.
---
I know it's late but as a shaman I made a simple target/earth shock macro. I got shit to do.
---
not to be rude but its 'piques' :)
---
This post makes me happy.  Death to the alliance!  For The Horde!
---
Sadly rogues just don't bring anything to the table in group pve. The few times I've had a rogue in a party they did great DPS but offered no utility other than looting all the locked chests without asking for rolls.
---
I walked around IC for hours trying to figure out how to get out my first time. So much so that I memorized the place and still have no issues in there to this day..lol.
---
Well you're somewhat in luck....Logitech announced the G604 wireless not long ago...Not quite as many buttons as the 603 but it does have 6 side buttons .... 15 total "control" buttons... Looks very comfortable as well.
---
Praetorian pauldrons of the monkey till I get my truestrike
---
Yup. If I see master looter turned on in an instance I auto hearth. 
---
State your intentions beforehand otherwise you are a ninja.
---
Clear all quests in Badlands/Swamp of Sorrows/Dustwallow Marsh.
---
Level up your cooking/fishing to 300.
---
Find a mob route to farm vendor trash for your mount.
---
Repeatedly clear SM/RFD until you get all the best rares from these places for your character.
---
You need objectives, that's how you move forward, in WoW and irl.
---
Can someone explain what I just watched?
---
Phone recording screen too
---
Doubt the gnome agrees. "Yay I get to sit here and watch myself drown, take the repair hit, and hope they don't feel like camping me. Hilarious.".
---
So many people don't seem to get about world PvP that something can be allowed yet still be a dick move.
---
As one does.
---
Not really necessary. Dungeons don't become remotely difficult to heal until around the late 40s early 50s, so they can be healed in enhancement. I do recommend a good healing addon to make it easier though. Vuhdo is my favorite, but HealBot tends to be a lot more user friendly. 
---
That said, Resto Shaman with a dagger and shield and using Flametongue is a reasonable way to farm and it has way more survivability, it's just going to be much slower. So it's kind of a pick your poison situation.
---
this makes me hate the human race
---
You can cancel the spin tho
---
We sure got you good in the Stormwind Keep though, you didn't manage to kill Bolvar. I got a mild heart attack when you all ressed at the same time though. Good fun!
---
Not an issue. You can quest in any way you want and in any zone that fits your level
---
IMAGINE typing on a world of warcraft forum, making fun of someone else's life LOL
---
Bahaha
---
You belong in his guild.
---
Ayyy! Will do! I'd be down to add you as a bnet friend regardless
---
There was recently a post showing parses for MC and Shaman DPS was decidedly at the bottom. Even Paladins beat us. Mana is just too much of a barrier in raids. That said, dps shamans can still find raid slots. There's plenty of need for totems since they apply group wide and not raid wide and no raid can run all resto shamans. Enhancement shamans also make really solid Nightfallers since Warriors usually want to be using other/better weapons for max numbers, and forcing a hunter to stand in melee and spam Raptor Strike is troll af.
---
I decided that I won’t be placing talents in any weapon specilaizations since you change weapons so often. I would feel like those 5 points would be wasted if you were to get a mace or sword. 
---
Instead, I put 3 in improved hamstring, imp charge and some extra in parry. Either way is fine.
---
I mean, does 3v1 matter when you MC anyway?
---
stay mad ally scum
---
Ahhh I feel that. My dream is to get back to Midtown. I went to Tech for 3 years and love it down there
---
Blacksmithing doesn't offer bind on pickup recipes like tailoring does. It's easy to get what you need by paying for it.
---
Imo pick mining and skinning. Save your bars by bank alt and swap out skinning when you're ready/can afford to train engineering later on (50+ level range is when you should).
---
There was a full on raid of horde locking out Hillsbrad Foothills on my server yesterday. I ran through and saw them killing every single alliance they could find, no matter the level.
---
I mean cool I guess, 25v1 doesn't really seem fun to me but you do you.
---
A nice 300g to help you towards that epic mount, gz!
---
No problem dude.
---
And because of that, I know when we're awake
---
There's a social setting in the interface options.
---
Not sure if that's the one you're talking about, but the /who function got removed. Breaks addons like census and other addons used for guild recrutment
---
I miss the old days...but I enjoy life now that I'm doing things OTHER than WoW...
---
Fuck yeah! For the horde!
---
You didn't recognise the former poster's obvious hyperbole, and now you're being an asshole about it.
---
Assholes are, as I said, another variant of socially inept people. A way more grating one, imo.
---
I rocked this item called The Shoveler on my warrior from level 32-38 that was also a literal shovel lol.
---
An Alliance lvl ?? killed my lvl 21 Undead Mage today while looting a bear that I killed.  Have you no honor?
---
Had the same experience when i healed dungeons
---
The only meta rogue is a part of is the unwanted. Rogues are a pretty allround trash class, unfortunately.
---
They might take you for your utility, but elemental shamans offer very poor sustained dps for dungeons.
---
Just be upfront about what you play and hope for the best. Going as a healer is going to make it much easier to get a group.
---
The most concrete thing is a quest in deepholm from a goblin shaman where you kill his fire elemental to get his heart. As the fire elemental dies it yells "this was not in my contract".
---
You would be better off DPSing without the mace...
---
Because its fuckin classic dude. You take all the bugs and optimizations they weren't able to fix.
---
obviously people used the layering bug to kill rag several times, but before the ban hammer they sold off the ingots. Their account lost the goldbut all the BOE items sold from the layering abuse are still in the game.
---
This.
---
I’m also sick as fuck of Horde fearing me off boats in Booty Bay and Ratchet.
---
idk im healing now and did in vanilla, it feels like everyones better now.  i dont think i ever fully did gnomer until TBC and Uldaman was so bad people would just leave after the first wipe assuming the group would be a wipe parade.  the big thing is everyone knowing about threat.
---
&gt; or they feel bad that alliance are fleeing our server in droves)
---
Probably this bit. They don't want their server turning into just a glorified PvE server.
---
Yep. Circle of life. For every dick head horde skull that Hanks me I farm their lowbies. Bonus points for farming camps that they need. They indeed forced my hand.
---
Aha. Cowards you are? Interesting.
---
Try Rag. Bonereavers is way better for warriors.
---
1s is alot to a lvl 14.
---
Shadow Word(Rank 1) I believe, otherwise it casts the highest rank you have.
---
Horde mongrels
---
And they're damn near all PVP. 
---
We ended up getting it resolved this morning and this was the issue!
---
Blood elves are a "gnome" race? I don't see the resemblance.
---
The annoying race everyone goes out of their way to kill.
---
Girls on horde? Nah. Purely dudes named Kyle pounding monster energy drinks. Real chads roll gnomes.
---
Firemaw is one of the fullest servers.  Even if half the guilds that had an ingot drop didn't immediately put it up for sale there would most likely still be enough to make the hammer + buy the pattern (as evidenced by the fact is fucking happened).  
---
Not all success was cheated to obtain, you potato.
---
You're getting boo'ed but you're right. Pandering to the carebears and crying babies is what ruined WoW.
---
As long as you've finished your pet taming quests, you're fine.
---
There's a difference though. Hunters only gain Dps from the stats whereas melee characters gain a majority of their Dps from the damage of the weapon itself(far greater upgrade) that's why it's frowned with certain items
---
Edit: example being a melee rolling need over a hunter on a gun or bow. It's just a dick move.
---
I’m an alli on a horde heavy server. 
---
I always /wave or help the horde when I see them, I’ll give them a chance... trying to be the change I wanna see
---
That’s  hard when you’re dancing with a troll
---
And two undead rogues unstealth to rape you, standing still, dancing.
---
But it’s a pvp server so whatever I signed up for it... I just don’t get it
---
Not really. The only people who knew about pandaria weren’t really going to tell people about it.
---
Like why would Zul tell the horde or alliance of pandaria. And why would Thrall tell anyone besides his closest friends, one of which already knows (Voljin).
---
&gt; It can be done with every spec
---
 Full stop.
---
Always kill gnome mages and ask questions later
---
Thank you ^_^
---
I don’t brag about shit in world pvp. Nobody really should. Nonetheless, this isn’t world PVP, this is world fuckery-trolling. This is genius.
---
He admitted he had more money so he must be abusing layering what part of this dont you get? 
---
People are dumb.
---
This is the kind of crap that sets me off. Yesterday I got ganked in STV by a skull priest (I’m a 40 hunter) yeah I was half health killing a mob but ok whatevs. It’s a PvP server. 
---
A few minutes later I see the priest and send in my pet and pop all cool downs. Clearly I ain’t winning the fight but I’m trying and I need to send a message. 
---
But who do I see riding past? Another skull warrior. He dismounts and joins in. I die in 2 seconds. 
---
I’m on Stalagg. The most imbalanced server. Horde can suck my BALLS
---
Comparing a class profession to a primary profession makes no sense at all
---
issa joke
---
I have them maxed, maxxed? idk spelling but yeah I have them turned all the way up
---
You're wrong by default and no matter how hard you argue it doesn't change that.
---
Jesus Christ that's fucking dark
---
There’s some god damn honor in this. Spending time to keep this guy in the ocean while landing MCs over and over. Dedication, on top of it
---
The cataclysm caused those islands to rise from the depths. Duh.
---
How likely is it that OP is Slavsquatch?
---
I’d give it an 80
---
Nice x13!
---
Okay it’s gonna go against everything you hear ppl say, but as a 55 hunter hear me out. It’s Boar, or maybe even wind serpent. 
---
A normal mob in the world is gonna take you 10-20s to kill, so the dps of a cat won’t shine. 
---
Tbh even though a boar in theory has -20% dps than a cat, their burst opener is so big that you don’t have to worry about aggro, and their dps won’t matter cause the fight is over in 20s. 
---
The problem with cat is that they have claw, which non stop, constantly empties out the focus bar, meaning a car will almost never cast a 2nd growl, they just claw. A boar or wind serpent, will always cast a growl off cd, meaning they hold the best aggro.
---
Not bear cause they only have bite, no charge. Not turtle or wtv cause the same reason. Owl/vulture are quite tanky cause of screech, but once again they will spam claw.
---
Some people will say, well just use cat, and cast the claw yourself, and if growl is used on cd, the aggro will be good and dps higher. True... but when you quest and mindless grind, how many people are gonna mange the focus bar that well lol.
---
What's the mini map addon?
---
Does that include your life story?
---
How many incendosaurs did they have to kill?
---
How many Dark Iron nodes?
---
How many UBRS runs?
---
Insane that it was done this quickly.
---
That’s not retail bad, that’s true. There’s really no reason to visit it. We had a reason in legion (Order Halls) but in BFA only collectors would go to anything besides Orgrimmar/Stormwind and Kultiras/Zandalar/Naz
---
In legion I could see what you mean but I think in BFA there is a very good, consistent art style between the continents. The problem is all the expansions before it make it seem like a patchwork mess of styles. Taken alone I think it is very nice and I’d want to hear specifically what you think is scattershot
---
For active healing PWS is trash. However if it allows you to mana reg a few seconds longer it gains value.
---
That is if you actively try to maximize mana regen. With enough spirit, a shield that lets you regen one or two more ticks before healing becomes worth it. At least in dungeons.
---
This of course is dependent on your spirit value. Lower spirit means less mana regen during PWS so it is worse.
---
&gt;it’s three people getting smashed at once.
---
Your dps are dipshits, to put it mildly. Tanks take a fair while to get aggro, and in aoe it's very hard for them to hold at all. If you're going to be doing AoE pulls, either your DPS need to blender the mobs so fast healing isn't an issue (melee cleave) or they need to kite them as mages with slows.
---
It's not your job to be a zoo keeper. If aoe groups can't kill fast enough or take care of themselves, that's on them. Tanks in vanilla can't handle aoe aggro at all.
---
I refuse to heal aoe groups, I don't need those years taken off my life.
---
Yeah me to. But from my memory I believe it was nessecary att the time to counter incoming dmg-&gt;oom + aggro for tanks... and really for dps too.
---
But I realise that 10 years does have a certain amount of experience behind it. My dmg on my hunter these days att lvl 10 is probably comparable to my dmg att lvl 18-22 back in the day.
---
I'm really glad you didn't record the video with your phone
---
There’s always a catch to the world first stuff.
---
Seems like certain archetypes of players make for a proper ganker. I’ve noticed gnome mages are the alliance equivalent.
---
This post has been removed for the following reasons:
---
Hire me
---
Sure it was 3v1 but just let the kiddies that are new to this game have their fun trying out their classes skills!
---
Where is that?
---
I don't get it..?
---
Called vendorprice
---
I would definitely laugh if I was gangbanged by higher lvls with them taking turns at drowning me.
---
I can def seem them doing it in one of the phases as a bonus, It's free money for blizzard and everyone wants them.
---
Most of the time they just speak and act *as their character would*, rather than as a human player piloting their character. It's a thing for us where, by not breaking the 4th wall, the game *feels* more like a really interactive RPG rather than an online multiplayer game where you're acutely aware of every "xxlordbonerhitlerxx" spamming all the main chat channels with awful meme or trolling crap. That's not to say that stuff doesn't happen, but RP realms are specifically set aside for us types so we have places we know people will try to abide by these standards and thus create a more immersive world. 
---
The alternative would be no RP realms at all with all of the RP'ers constantly whining about other people's names and behaviors. It'd be a ticketing nightmare for Blizzard and would probably royally piss off RP and non-RP players alike.
---
Personally I don't typically do specific events but I do interact with other players and even NPC's as I imagine my character would, as well as use a lot of emotes and whatnot for flavor. I find it fun, but it's not for everyone so I appreciate having space set aside to accommodate this style of play. If you haven't tried RP on an RP realm yet you should really give it a go. Just stay out of Goldshire and avoid the weird ERP'ers.
---
All items in your bag
---
War at lvl 60 can farm DME with a healer. Sell the drops, mine the ores and DE for shards. Easy money.
---
I think go to levelling is arms prot
---
Yup everything in your bags 25%
---
Ah, okay.
---
&gt; But Ironforge is easily the coolest city in WoW.
---
I dunno. With that big damn smelter right in the middle, it seems to me like it'd be pretty damn hot.
---
He got the item he wanted and left without saying a word.
---
Hit the nail on the head.
---
&gt; I’ve noticed gnome ~~mages~~ are the alliance equivalent.    
---
      
---
I agree
---
Usually buffing an ally or using an AOE ability are what get you flagged unintentionally.
---
Didn't the Alliance have some strongholds left in Northrend after the 3rd war?
---
Let’s sheep someone who’s frozen with 2 others beating on him rather than blink the hell out...
---
"All our cities are made of spikes and skulls..."
---
Those fuckers give a 5 minute curse that stuns you for 5 seconds at random, no diminishing return. I will never, ever do that quest again.

SexyMap
---
That's it, I'm rolling a rogue.
---
i didn't say anything about outnumbered toons ganking or doing anything else, i said you guys (aka alliance) are GENERALLY outnumbered, meaning in GENERAL there are more horde than alliance on that server.  See about that refund
---
&gt;"Only one class has this skill. But it's not a class skill. It's placed in a different UI tab."
---
You're really grasping at straws mate and I'm pretty sure you know it.
---
Do whatever you want, but expect people in pugs to question your behaviour publicly. And if you display the same behaviour in guild runs, expect your guild members to talk about you in whispers. 
---
At the end of the day, do what you want. But accept the consequences. People remember how you behave. Server reputation matters in Classic.
---
Satyrs in azshara are also good.
---
RPPVP, no. Most people run on those for the community and PvP aspect of them. People do RP, but out of my 14 days played I've seen maybe 5 cases of actual RP in the world.
---
RPPVE is another story. Those are full of RP constantly and the atmosphere is completely different.
---
What about the mithril dragon
---
I don't think you can cast mind control on someone who is mind controlled.
---
they also make faulty electronics
---
Clearly two bears giving a high five
---
Yes they do, builds are posted all the time. Lmao.
---
they will never have a PVP--&gt;PVE or PVE--&gt;PVP transfers
---
It's a secondary profession that requires no decision to keep. Primary professions get special treatment because there is an opportunity cost associated with them. That's not the case for secondary profs.
---
Mages have to expend mana to create food/water and have to buy reagents to make portals at 20s a pop. Warlocks have to keep soul shards in their bags to SS the healer, generate health stones,  and cast summons. Some skills require basic maintenance. For rogues, that's lockpicking. Use your skills to benefit your party. You're 100% replaceable.
---
Haha, what ever do you mean, can't you be more stealthy whilst sprinting than trying to be quiet?!
---
FWIW though it's not the speed that bothers me so much (although I do miss it) as the long cool down without talents and lack of Subterfuge I think when everything has DoTs. Just after playing with them for so long not having them is... Awkward.
---
Oh and Faerie Fire being a thing. Wouldn't believe how happy I was the day that was removed from baseline and made much shorter duration.
---
&gt; in a single hardware event.
---
I generally play horde, but not this time. Your comment still doesn’t make any sense because you said “you guys” so it doesn’t mean you yourself are an alliance toon? Is that your point?
---
They're not patched in yet, give them a break
---
I cant understand just how low people are, like how the fuck is anyone sub 40-50 rn, its just incompetence
---
Tell that to the tanks and healers that thank me for constantly interrupting mobs. A well played Rogue is far from trash. Most people just suck at it and blow all thier energy on SS spam.
---
To add to this. Personally I think Duskwood is by far the best zone in the game. I rolled alliance in classic because of duskwood.
---
The horde also has it way easier in Felwood too with a flight pass in the middle of the map, Alliance gets one in a corner away from all the quests and it doesn't even have quests.
---
I used to do the same with my druid, teach people to respect nature's power.
---
Disclaimer I am not super familiar with most of the pets, found this interesting though
---
&gt;Not sure if anyone else posted about this (long threads), but the Battle Chicken/Mechanical Dragonlings can detect stealth very easily if you take the time to level up your engineering early
---
It's the same both ways. I've mained Horde for 15 years on a PvP server, I've never been attacked by less than 2 at a time unless they were much higher level than me.
---
I'm going Alliance in Classic to get that experience for once and it's exactly the same.
---
I roll with anyone else that has mining. You should roll on locked chest. Rogue will get a skill up from opening and winning roll takes contents.
---
You should also remember to respect active RP. If you go into an Inn and two people are sitting at a table drinking and having an RP conversation in /say, don't go over there and jump up and down on them or teabag them or spam them with stupid emotes, etc. Same goes for big events going down. It's just generally considered courteous to stay out of the way and not interfere or disrupt active RP if you're not going to participate.

This brings joy to my little Horde heart
---
Survival is one of the specs I've had fun with in retail
---
I get it. I was you when I played vanilla. I was the elitest that wanted to make the run as easy as possible. But now? Now I want the "fuck it" factor. I love seeing what a hodgepodge group can pull off.  Gimmie a druid tank, a fury war, a shaman healer and whatever you want and find out what's possible.  
---
And in the end it still gets pulled off; outside of expectation.
---
Is that how you use a semi colon? I'm never sure with that shit.
---
Dude get a fucking life man, reading your comments makes me sad for you.
---
Imagine being this mad over a videogame
---
Report him, he'll get a ban for that kind of thing
---
I kept a kid sapped and stunned underwater until he drowned the other day. I felt a tiny bit bad about it.
---
Oh I am very nice player typically, but a person can only be killed/camped indiscriminately so many times before some sort of revenge becomes inevitable.
---
What happened to clever use of game mechanics.  Literally what they would say to almost any "cheating" back in the day.
---
Professions are available to all players and lockpicking isn't? Why does this even need explaining?
---
Rogues bring literally zero utility to a group. And if a rogue acts selfish like OP and denies the group one of the few plusses of bringing a rogue, then there's even less reason to bring him.
---
Yeah but druids have AoE, hunters have AoE, yet they're not invited. Spellcleave tells you they want locks/mages.
---
I vow to kill every orc I see tonight to avenge my fellow short legged friend
---
To be fair you can use the fp in azshara to get to the north east of ashenvale.
---
fuck multi boxers
---
It will probably happen at some point. However transfers from pve to pvocwill most likely not happpen.
---
Riposte procs. 
---
Chooses to sinister twice for 40 energy each over a disarm 10 energy 150% wep dmg.
---
Im upset now
---
Is this like the xbit version of mind control.
---
"I heard you like mind control, so I have you some mind control while you're mind controlling"
---
Lol
---
Do you wonder that every time you see a high lvl kill a low lvl mob or critter?
---
So... A chapter from the Witcher books.
---
Also likely a salty rogue that he can't solo elites but hunters can and they aren't invited either.
---
Petition to call carries goldcleave
---
It starts with small animals.
---
Then they work their way up
---
You’re a Druid. Don’t you usually just run unless you have friends to heal?
---
Heal, and bounce around renew along with it to improve MP regen.
---
Flash heal is innefficient and is for oh shit moments.
---
I am an evil Orcish Warlock...but am I really?
---
Because when I get ganked, I just realize that I am better than these savages because I actually help them when they are weak and in trouble. I once even helped an entire group of them doing elites in Wetlands for 20 minutes.
---
The only difference is that whenever I enter Blackrock Mountain I make it a point to annihilate every Alliance I see - or die trying. I would do it to my fellow Horde too if I could, because there is no place for the weak in that mountain.
---
Good work brother.
---
Death coil fear dots and ur dead. The only thing I enjoy more than killing lvl 60 ally is going to duskwood and closing areas of the map from questing.
---
Totally get it, just one of the things that was vanilla.
---
You mean besides the ones that Arthas daddy dicked?
---
What abilities would you recommend on this cat? My cat I have only had growl but he is a snow leopard.
---
jesus christ i was joking about the diploma thing but i'm starting wonder.  Just stop, you have comprehension problems, and i mean this very sincerely: i hope you can get help with that.
---
Who the hell is doing that at level 25 lol
---
Wait you have imp blizz but also maxed frostbite? Why? Freezing mobs when you're aoeing messes up the aoeing.
---
I have something like that on my rage bar. It's green &lt; 25 rage and red &gt; 25 rage to remind me. However if I swap quickly enough or crit just before I do I miss how much I just wasted.
---
"I'm tired of them just adding new continents every expansion" - Magellan, probably.
---
All fun if ya do it 1v1. Why it this so highly voted? Oh, gnome... Carry on
---
Rogue here. I feel the exact same way you do. At the end of the day people are just fuckin greedy and they want to con you out of your shit. There is no argument you can make that somehow creates a world where it makes sense to roll on locked chests and not mining or herb nodes beyond "I don't mind watching the miner loot 3 white ore, but when I see the rogue loot a blue I want it."
---
However, 9 times out of 10 it's trash anyway so I just share them because the social connections are worth more then the handful of silver. However I loot the chest and trade the green and if someone wants to put it on I give it to them regardless of what they rolled.
---
These kids prolly intend to do some school shooting in the future. It’s time to call the FBI on this one boys
---
Kk thanks :)
---
hahaha guess you also abused layering
---
We just mind controlled a hunter in Tanaris for attacking us, and we made him auto his pet to death, then made him walk away in shame.
---
We got a few reports on this post... but I see nothing wrong here. Just wanted y'all to know.
---
Carry on.
---
Yes exactly like you use it (such as "street cred"). Which I, a millenial, learned from my boomer parents.
---
Ah yes, you mean the books of course? There was also an animated movie. But I was talking about the The Lord of the Rings movie(s) by Peter Jackson. 😉
---
&gt; It should be obvious if the group you've selected is an "AOE FARM" group or not from the beginning
---
You underestimate the ignorance of some players, I've had groups where the *only* caster besides the healer demands I pull half the instance so he can spellcleave. It's important to communicate your intentions under no uncertain terms, assuming anything is a mistake. As for using AoE abilities in general, I in no way said I forbid their use, in fact in many situations in a "normal" dungeon run I'd expect it.
---
Mother fucker makin all us ally look bad report this exploiting bitch i may get 5v1d but im not gona exploit to get yous back ill wait till you pull a mob
---
Total dick move and I love it.

It comes down to kill or be killed, we get scared they’ll get the jump on our friendliness.
---
Fear leads to hate, hate leads to anger, anger leads to the dark side.
---
Fast forward two hours ... I killed them all. Not just the men but the women and children too. I hate gnomes.
---
Prevents dismount as well.
---
They're level 60 dungeons for sure unless everyone knows thier shit down pat.
---
Tip: there is a pet with 7 hours spawn time (Broken Tooth) that is BiS for hunters, kill it when they start taming it or damage it, mind control the hordie and autoattack it to death.
---
Nice try, thief.
---
Mooncloth and arcane xmute alts are good passive way to make some gold yes
---
You keep trying to insult me instead of addressing the discussion at hand, I just emailed a Zimbabwe goblin my bank info so don’t worry about me friend, I’m set for life. I really don’t understand what you were trying to say in your OP. Are you projecting your own insecurities mentioning degrees? Is that like a level 60 skill?
---
No it doesn't. It helps with CC and the free crit chance boost is just a plus. Plenty of times I'd have whole packs frozen just from blizzard alone. Which can go right into a flame strike/coc and then just nova again for another crit spam.
---
Shatt should've been split with one half ally/horde. The way they did TOC should've been the end of ally vs horde going forward.
---
Cata is what happens when they ran out of lore to mine and had to write their own stuff. It didn't work out well.
---
I am an Alliance player and I allow this.
---
You should have it off auto-cast and just cast manually if needed on messy pulls. Can take some pressure off the tank.
---
Heh, see? "You said words you're clearly really upset over this!".
---
Whatever you want to tell yourself mate, hope it helps.
---
This is f'in awesome!
---
Shamans can be pretty bad too. Source: Am a shaman.
---
Do whatever keeps the game interesting for you. It aint gonna be dying anytime soon. You have a couple years to play around.
---
Actually that last one wasn't meant as an insult, i'm genuinely concerned.  there has yet to be a discussion, you have completely changed what i said in your head.
---
While I'm at it...a Degree and a Diploma are not the same thing.  i appreciate you proving my point
---
That's some seriously fucked up sh- oh wait it's a warlock. Carry on!
---
Ikr, next level stuff here.
---
Yeah, time flies... But what a great trilogy that is, I mean, I doubt it will ever be topped.
---
This dude must be in a guild by himself.
---
Lmao as if it was just horse doing that. 
---
The amount of times I’ve been gang banged by alliance while questing... it’s a pvp realm what do you expect
---
Would it be stupid to jettison engineering/mining at level 43 rogue to go for skinning/LW? I'm only in the low 100's for both and just haven't been motivated to do either. Way behind on the curve, probably should have gotten it ages ago, but sunk cost and all that...heard engineering was *the* PvP profession but. I feel like I should be making my own gear and shit.
---
&gt; And so what? There's 40 people in a raid. 15 people could be afk and you could still do it. Why be such a tryhard minmaxer?
---
Tell that to the guy saying feral pulls "insane numbers".
---
That is entirely dependent on how much water you breath in.
---
Lol what a loser
---
Well... the biggest suspension of disbelief within the currently established lore of the fiction haha

---
Pvp to pve were possible, it's just the reverse that they won't do.
---
I thought it was still good even with that exploit not working.
---
I'm getting crazy utility out of this, you will probably deserve thanks in advance for hundreds or thousands of hours of assistance i'll end up getting from it
---
Any plans to do a horde version some day?
---
Dash, bite, claw, prowl and of course growl. 
---
Google Petopia classic for all your hunter pet needs :)
---
Edit: cower is also a must!
---
Major exploit being used in dungeons yes. But there has been no evidence or confirmation that it ever happened in raids. If you are privy to information that literally nobody else has seen please, go ahead and provide it.
---
Definitely Claw for damage. dash is useful in PvP. And Bite is up for debate but is a nice opener
---
The horde doesn’t concern itself with the weak alliance races opinions. /spit
---
I like this. I’ve been using my battle chicken to kill horde. If they defeat it I cheer them and then chase after them until their demise.
---
STV feels the most like an actual place to me. Pirates, jungle, chaos, Vietnam.
---
Ok thanks!
---
This is why at level 26 I rerolled to a pve server and haven't looked back. I thought I'd be fine on a pvp realm, but no. As soon as I stepped into the first contested zone (Hillsbrad as horde) it was constant ganks by higher level alliance, you couldn't even leave Tarren mill. And the worst part is there's no honor system, so its pointless too. Simply people being dicks.
---
That or die an honorless death.
---
This. This so much is how you tank. Thunder clapping and the stance dancing is extra stuff that doesn’t generate threat or rage. 
---
Hang in there man don’t worry about douchey mages. I’m a new mage btw it’s super lit
---
Not really. Witcher is a book of fiction. This is a bunch of real life cave dwellers getting their rocks off.
---
You're kind of an entitled dick aren't ya?
---
If he was L7, his hearth probably isn't set anywhere.
---
does getting pocket healed as a horde warrior even compare to alliance? are pallies noticably stronger when it comes to healing/pocketing warriors in pvp?
---
Better start playing a class and not a specc then.
---
No kidding. But what makes it slightly better is his username. Obviously the "Thrall" is meant for the WoW warchief, but in the books the Iron Islanders frequently took thralls from their raids. So you could look at "Thrall_So_Hard" as saying "raiding and killing and capturing so hard". 
---
For the record, almost all of the Iron Islanders are massive pieces of shit. I despise 99% of them, but goddamn do I love reading about them.
---
The same people saying everything must be locked to the exact same specs are the same exploiting every aspect in ways not in classic.  There's no spirit, just hypocrites.
---
Heh, you can always tell the people who are in denial over this stuff. Can't just admit you get off on being a dick to people, can you buddy?
---
Because classic WoW didn't have discord, and they're mad that their "no changes" philosophy has been infringed.
---

---
Yeuh!

SFK to 27 then quest in hillsbrad &gt; RFK a few times &gt; thousand needles
---
I see a lot of comments coming at this from a PvE perspective, and it seems like general consensus is to use regular Heal.  Downrank to save mana.  PvP wise I'd go with flash heal to minimize time to get silenced.
---
If this is what other druids do, I finally get why no one seems to know how to properly fight a druid. No practice. We're discount rogues that can heal ourselves, and spam moonfire if you try to run with low health.  
---
And my friends don't heal me, I heal them.
---
Not only is u/NotALockNessMonster 100% replaceable. He's a rogue, one of the classes who bring LEAST utility to a group. I don't think I have EVER seen "LF1M rogue".
---
And if a rogue acts selfish like OP and denies the group one of the few plusses of bringing a rogue, then there's even less reason to bring him.
---
On the weapon master, check the second option instead of the train me one, the one that says what can other weapon masters teach me or whatever.  He'll tell you what each weapon master in each major city teaches.
---
I let the Alliance mostly in peace or might even help them because I am from the future of Azeroth and I have seen things you people wouldn't believe... Horde ships on fire off the shores of Zandalar... I watched Fel beams glitter in the dark near the Antoran Wastes. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to die.
---
I remember so many tanks using it for SM carries or farms
---
Adibags
---
Yeah thats also a good choice
---
Why not go for improved cleave?
---
For the horde!

That's so evil...

Don't need to be the best. Remember a group with level. 50 something toons downed the hardest encounters available now within 6 days of launch.
---
This advice forgets the time value of money. It's worth more now than later. Especially if you actually have a need for something (i.e. mount) now.
---
Strange post here.
---
**HOW ARE YA????**
---
or are we?! yeah no were not :(
---
Holy shit man. It's a game based around racial conflict. Surprise surprise.
---
Edit to add, how is this different from corpse camping in any meaningful way? You've played the game right?
---
ive posted this already on this sub but warlocks and other classes need to stop treating those bis items as realistic.  see them as a bonus.  there are other options that sim nearly as good that are much easier to get

---
it cant happen with layering and probably wont happen since blizzard has no reason to ignore the xfaction collusion like sketchy pserver admins.
---
Their poop is easy to clean up.  We can do this all night bro.  End the hate.
---
Sorry I was too thick to see the trolling at first. My bad.  
---
Though Trolls in WoW seem to be nice peeps. Tauren a pretty honorable as well.
---
Unless pvp server.
---
Something something streamer man bad
---
with layers we have seen about 15-20k per server concurrent. whatever that means in active players per full realm. 
---
30-50k maybe?
---
&gt; do you stop to roll for herbs and mining nodes? 
---
actually yes
---
&gt; Do you offer up your cloth stacks for rolls
---
No, that would be dumb. Cloth stacks don't offer level ups by picking them up and you also can't get epics/rares from picking up cloth.
---
&gt;  put in the hard work to level up my lockpicking to be able to pick these chests!
---
And you can solo clear the dungeon to get to that chest too I suppose, these other 4 guys are just leechers.
---
I use NugEnergy, NugRunning, and one more thing... Nug related. They're amazing.
---
Yes, but there's no reason to get prebis gear. The pve content out now isn't that difficult.
---
Just found out there's a druid flight form skill where you become a bird. Does it exist in wow classic?
---
Grow the fuck up if you get angry enough at someone for something like this that you want to beat them up.  Maybe you're the one that needs their ass kicked.
---
Baddies
---
Texan?
---
Yes! Iceblock and blast wave. I swear I was the only mage running this spec in vanilla. Watching you blast this combo brought back so many memories.
---
&gt; "beyond the wall" in GoT
---
Lich King &gt; Night King
---
Sindragosa &gt; Viserion
---
Oh shit prot warrior plus hunter ? Take me back
---
That I can agree with. I mean I don't do much PvP but I'm so casual I don't even know what brm is. But I get the allure of PvP.
---
Your using adibags right? How did you get the columns so flush with the border? With my adibags there's a massive area on the right where no items will populate.
---
It’s not hard to have alts parked on layers and jump between them. There’s already a discord for our server for top horde and alliance guild to work together to drive out competition. 
---
No offence but you’re very naive if you think it isn’t happening. Just curious about any good drama stories etc.
---
If you want to make them future proof, just add a lot of islands and continents even if you never use them in the end.
---
This is so pure and amusing. I love it.
---
Hunter I take it. Your handle supports my claim.
---
Says the gnome.
---
Its okay youre back on track now!
---
Will the demand for tanks persist well into the later raid tiers/game phases? Even if there are a lot of warriors? I've got a warrior and a paladin to 30, the idea was stick with the paladin for an easy in to raiding with my limited time. But there are other concerns like the required time invested to be raid ready at a semi-serious level as a tank vs a healer.
---
tldr tank or healer for and easy in to raiding all the way up to aq40
---
Wait, is that Tailoring on the right action bar?
---
Can you also hop on a zep or boat back to barrens/tirisfal for the free resurrection from loading screen?
---
What does that mean?
---
This reminds me of when I quested off of the shore in South Western Arathi Highlands.
---
There was this dwarf warrior who dared to take my quest objectives, so I just rooted him underwater till he drowned. 
---
Before the last coupe of ticks I let him swim upwards to give him some hope of surviving, just to root him a couple of cm beneath the water surface.
---
I fly to ogrimmar and do tricks on the corner until I find a mage willing to give me 4 stacks of water.
---
Thanks for the detailed answer. I've always loved boars :D
---
Dunno if  this is a retarded question or no: What if I just disable "claw" from the cat/dog pet? Is that now on equal plains with boar or no?
---
Does the boar charge create alot of threat?
---
How come that’s impossible?
---
What Horde? Not the horde I've been playing around the last 20 or so levels.
---
I actually have had Horde in STV of all places do what OP posted for me and I for them, but since then it's 99% killed by ?? with no provocation and I've had to juke more Soulfire than I can count from bad locks.
---
Lol I wouldn't have an idea
---
I played an Undead priest in Vanilla... this was by far my favorite way to kill people.
---
I hate that shit too. Ran an RFD last night.  Mage Aoe every single pull..even single target pulls. So fucking annoying trying to hold threat when your dps does not understand single target.
---
An hunter
---
Gnomes have the best pvp racial for melee so most of the try hards will be gnome
---
Are you selling them for 1s59 per stack?
---
How do you know that?
---
Glad to see you’re taking classic seriously with that ugly and cluttered UI lol
---
Kinda, healers in my server are starting to become a rare resource at L50. Class distribution changes quite a bit based on what tier.
---
Let me see if I can follow the logic. He doesn't like that there are spell cleave groups. He's running a normal group and instead of using it has a chance to educate a potential AoEer on the joys of playing the game the way we all have nostalgia for, he excludes you, and thus increases the likelihood you'll either join or form another AoE group.
---
He sure showed you. He showed you all.
---
Trolls, goblins
---
The FP is right there if you are doing the north eastern quests, there aren't mobs between Ashenvale and the fp.
---
Old Turtles Never Die is a Taiwanese guild.
---
You guys are losers.
---
UI is obnoxious. Talk about destroying immersion. Retail is bleeding
---
Maybe your gear is a little outdated for your level
---
Why don’t you put your energy towards teaching people how to play at your level instead of flaming everyone that’s worse than you. Prolly take 5 mins to explain to your group how’d you like things to go.  Or just shut up and stop grouping with scrubs
---
Hurry man stop doggin your mates
---
&gt;Is it likely that they will open up regular server transfer in the near future, 
---
They will but probably not for awhile.
---
It's from an addon called "BetterFont".  Not sure what the font is actually called.
---
good if uncontested (never on high pop)
---
Blackstone Ring on the Rogue means he maybe gets to do a bit more DPS in raid, Blackstone Ring on the tank means the whole raid gets to do a bit more DPS
---
In Ashenvale I fear chain drowned a orange levelled rouge who chased me out to sea... I was a warlock....
---
They're the first to write these kinds of posts yet routinely zerg players 11 to 1 on retail on a daily basis.
---
I’m with you. I’m a mage and I think spellcleave is dumb. I wish it was nerfed.
---
Not 100% sure about China, but my guess is that it's similar to Korea where gaming all about competition. It's why multiplayer games like LoL or DOTA or so much bigger there than singleplayer.
---
in warcraft three in an expansion where you play as rexxar their is a panda they travels with him
---
Holy shit I got that today too! I put it up for 200g no idea if that's even in the ballpark
---
Sounds like when my ex was mad at me, I would log back into my character to find them 2 sec away from death while drowning...
---
I attacked an  ally out of instinct to find them waving while my spells connected. I immediately stopped and let them wail back while I typed out the /sorry and sat there till they got it. Waved back, ate food, and helped them finish their quest lol
---
Karl’s better
---
This is incredible lmfao
---
This is tagged as humor lol. I'm not trying to brag about getting a kill I just thought it was funny how it went down. Sorry my video upset you ROFL!
---
Must kill every gnome on site. Idk why
---
Exactly my feeling on it. I don't mind sneaking partial drinks if there's a mage who has given me plenty of water, but if it's my water that costs x silver per stack of 5, I'm not doing it like that.
---
&gt;dude was out trying to start shit with the knowledge that if anyone acts out against him, he can play the victim.
---
Speculative bullshit.  Trying to start shit?  Probably trying to just have a simple laugh, because even I wouldn't expect someone to take something so trivial so seriously.  It's a goddamn movie about a videogame.  You're making it seem like he was up in everybody's face being aggressive.  You need to grow up and not get bothered by little shit.
---
&gt; I put in the hard work to level up my lockpicking to be able to pick these chests!
---
hahahahahaha
---
Lolol, for reals though.
---
Basically it was earning things on pve servers easier and then transferring to pvp server to reap the benefits without struggle the pvp community really didn't like.
---
Tips for leveling zone at lvl 30? Done in Hillsbrad :)
---
It will require some effort on their part at the very least. The author/maintainer of CensusPlus has said that the add-ons being used by scammers have ripped several chunks of code directly from CensusPlus, even leaving the comments intact.
---
Chinese people live in the US too lol. I used to play on Illidan for retail and there were so many Chinese the chat was unusable without the block Chinese add on
---
/laugh
---
Anyone who rolls troll is usually about that 💨🍃 life. So yeah we are chill for good reason.
---
I think you are just misreading their comments. Its always from people who enjoyed MoP.
---
Exactly.
---
Gnomeregan will not forget this.
---
No I’m not, and it’s not always people who enjoyed MoP. You should actually read the threads.
---
Its different because the intent was to drown the “victim,” which takes a little effort so the real question is what kind of “people” are actually in that dark headspace; cave dwellers. Also, corpse camping has no sweet loot or any real benefits. It’s just something assholes do because it brings them joy.
---
Amazing post brilliant post.
---
Had this earlier and didn't know why it was happening, in particular there's one pull near the end with 4 dwarves that just wrecked us, we eventually had tank tank 2 whilst I off tanked one far away and a warlock pet held the fourth in place (we had no actual cc in our group), really frustrating :/
---
I was thinking this too, it would be pretty funny to be an American gold farmer on a Chinese server
---
thanks
---
Anything and everything. There is no limit.
---
The Thousand Needles elevator post was enough to convince me. Look out, Biggles, Tingler the rogue is coming for you.
---
99% gold farmers.
---
I have. Its people who liked MoP saying MoP was underappreciated.
---
This is some war crime shit right here.
---
Yours too bb, no one one cares about your sad PvP realm story.
---
Yeah those addons we were using in 2006 are totally "retail". The hell are you on about? At least talk about his giant text box instead.
---
I just open it for the skill up and take the moneys at the very least.
---
Wow what are the odds. This dropped for me too in tanaris. I am a warrior as well so i will be selling it
---
shamans give warriors windfury. that is pretty big game for arms warriors
---
Evidently not because your saying not a single person wishes they were there for MoP and that they didn’t skip it.
---
yeah the current president won the electoral vote not the popular vote
---
Someone in the discord literally said “if you can google it and find an answer then don’t ask it in here” 
---
Like wtf get bent loser, some new players may not even know what to google, ya know?
---
PvE.
---
I mc allies off of booty bay boat.
---
iirc AoE spells in general were nerfed in TBC?
---
Changed from "Does x damage to everything in area" to "Does x damage split among everything in area" and I think there was an upper limit on how many targets they hit? It's been so long and my memory is a little faded haha
---
Same, it’s great when people don’t rush straight in and go mongo
---
That's a great point
---
Alternatively you can corner the market for 18 and 16 slot bags. 18 slots use 12 mooncloth while the 16 slotter uses 1.
---
Also the herb bag but who makes those.
---
horde hinterlands is probably the best zone in the game
---
Why the Barrens? I am lvl 26 horde so am getting into Stonevale mountains and Asheville and loving them way more. Barrens is so boring to walk through and just dead feeling
---
Waow thanks a lot. Really helps.
---
You bubble, I shield slam&gt;War stomp. It's 50/50. As I said it depends on procs. I see you casting and shield bash, can't cast holy for 6 seconds.
---
Stun is also not guaranteed vs Prot Get +15% resist.
---
Son of Satan is a good read
---
Oh no! Not the repair hit /s
---
We chose to play PVP for a reason. The potential for this stuff to happen makes it more fun.
---
You're special.
---
Probably boring but I like the “chill hip hop beats for studying” or something like that. Nothing too crazy or loud.
---
You can find it on YouTube and Spotify
---
Try feeding it some food.
---
Looking at it is giving me anxiety
---
You don't need the roots from it for cc if you're doing things right and the random freezing can mess up the grouping. It's just wasted talents. I should clarify that I'm talking about solo aoe farming.
---
Or maybe blizzard was ahead of their time on some [Simpsons shit](https://imgur.com/gallery/LLlhtjG) and we been saying it all these years🤔
---
On the horde side we just write a macro for tab+attack and spam that in a circle around where the mob will spawn. We tend to group up as much as possible too. It looks like we are dancing by twitching a bunch. We call it a circle-jerk.
---
Check classic petopia for all the info you need.
---
Desolace is a pretty good zone. I usually bounce between South shore highlands and desolace
---
It's too bad they won't live. But then again, who does?

This is a pvp game. Something is wrong with you
---
Smart man. When I was leveling I respecced into ele at like 40+ just so i could use int gear most of the time only keeping my +healing spells items in my bags.
---
You can try northern stv and desolace.
---
In-game music, on loop

Not boring at all. I dig it my friend. Thanks for the suggestion :)

I wish i knew what server you played on so I could corpse camp you.

Pro tip for mount money, a stack of Bronze Bars is worth about 29s to you, therefore the mats to make it are worth 29s a stack to break even, you can find copper and tin ore/bar for much less than this and turn them into rough bronze leggings, which vendor for close to 10s each and you make 3 of them (plus 2 bars left) per stack. I made a lot of my mount money with this flip.
---
YES! Let’s goooooo
---
I would advise against this one.  The thing is, if you click it multiple times, it will be spammy.  It will occur every time.  There is no randomization.  It will still say it if you get interrupted, then your enemies will taunt you.
---
There are sites to view this guide also in case you do not have the guide.
---
Yeah but this was just 1 moment of them killing an alliance in a humorous way. They've probably all been ganked by a night elf rogue 10+ times. Cant blame them for finding some joy in this.
---
They can use will of the forsaken to help escape too if it’s potentially possible
---
I see what you did there ;D
---
The toprated comment with 3 upvotes of which one is from you? Lmao dumbfuck, cope harder with the fact that you are blatant scum. Keep stealing from others loser.
---
It's dead and I have no clue where the body is
---
Dire maul wasn't out so I'd be surprised if it said VC
---
Can comfirm. Fuck shamans. Obv a priest..
---
warriors can use everything apart from wands though soooooo
---
Too*
---
I am strongly considering the same. But then again, windfury.....
---
No one gets permabanned for safespotting lmao
---
I'm playing on Venoxis. Perhaps because its a german realm you dont have multiple time zones. Say you play on an american westcoast one, you may have asian players, east coast ones. Therefore the timezones mix and when people stop playing, others start. German realms at the break of day are dead. I talk about 3 people in Burning Steppes dead.
---
Could you paste me the boar link and elite boar link? I've played wow for like less than a year total I don't know how to navigate that site.
---
What grouping would it mess up? Only time you wouldn't take frostbite is if you are trying to solo aoe farm, while in dungeons it's worth having. Even spamming frostbolt on single targets  while also having winters chill leads to some hard hitting single target dps.
---
I just love the instant karma, lol
---
I got my hunter all the way to 58 and I sorta regret it. FD and ice trap do not work in pvp like they do on p servers. Blizz has many more bugs.
---
World of hordecraft

---
Today I'm grinding to sed non satiata
---
Oh yea, alliance is totally peaceful and never kills horde at all...
---
&gt; i get alot of ppl dont like certain parts of retail, but ppl blow it out of proportion.
---
No they don't.
---
Uh no. You guys are so misinformed. You can have 1 server with 30k people or 1 server with 10 layers of 3k people. Its not going to change if you have 1 or 10. 
---
Just think of it logicially, how does a layer affect a servers capacity? A server has said capacity. How do you think a layer added to the server is going to change its capacity. all the layer does is help people quest and not make it so crowded.
---
I absolutely remember this being a thing back in vanilla as well, sub-60s being upset about being booted for a 60.
---
I think basically it comes down to: It's entitled to think you deserve the spot if the group wants more efficiency/strength instead, but it's also rude of the group to kick with no explanation.
---
It's a gnome, he probably loved every second of it.
---
I know if you change professions you lose your level, but if you have recipes you learned in alchemy, if you go alchemy again are they still there?
---
You should gnome rcy. Well done.
---
Justify 50 quid?
---
How poor are you? I work, and 50 dollars a month is equal to a month gym membership. It's nothing.
---
I feel ya, Enhance playstyle is also very chill in the world. Kill times start getting very slow though at 45+ with enhance, ele goes much harder.
---
Thunder Bluff is actually pleasant. And the orcs are just working with their local building materials.
---
Undercity though... yeah, they have some issues.

you need to buy raptor riding dont you ... going to get venomraptor is going to suck

Lol so true

---
I tanked a full sm run at 36/37 and we brought along a 27/28ish druid.  He's feral but he put on heal gear and healed for us.  Had a pally to help off heal but we cleared it with just one wipe because I forgot a room and he came out of stealth too soon and pulled it.  He said everything was skulls too him so I feel pretty accomplished finishing that run.  Even got the shield although I was 2 levels too low to use it.
---
Oh, my bad, yeah. I’m just looking to take my time at getting geared before jumping into raiding. I’m pretty sure my guild has a set tanking core, but I want to try my hand at old school tanking since I was primarily DPS back in Vanilla.
---
its also against the TOS.
---
Ok
---
Hi, any idea why my macro does not work? it keeps casting "Chatiment".
---
/castsequence reset=10/target Châtiment; Attaque mentale; Mot de l'ombre : Douleur
---
They're not. They're perfoming much needed pesticide.
---
He’s entered The Bulk
---
What
---
Also the less mana I blow each pull, the nicer I'm being to my healer. Single target dots + wand is fine DPS for any pull of 3 or fewer targets.
---
ok
---
Rofl. Happens to both sides.
---
Anyone know any good macros for warlock? Like one for your pet attacking or attacking the same time you cast your first ability with you, also any other QoL macros.
---
Sorry, I'm not the slow one. Apparently not one argument given why its shitty has been provided.
---
Please go see a doctor
---
How would a warrior fight them?
---
Not just swamp of sorrow, a lot of coasts in the game have them.  Most notably Darkshore
---
I just did strat UD as a healer 10 minutes after hitting 60 in questing greens/blues, rests of the group had similar gear. We cleared it in a little over an hour with no wipes. You do not need pre bis to do it lol
---
Yeah... no. Maybe some idiots did, you're an idiot so you probably surrounded yourself with idiots too and think that being idiots is normal, or you've just taken a grand stand on this topic like your life depends on it. Either way you're being an idiot, you're full of shit. 
---
The only time sm - ruin was recommended if you literally had no gear. Like you just hit 60 and you have full green lvl 30 items. That is the only time it's "close" in dps output to ds-ruin. From the moment you picked up your first t1s ds-ruin was miles ahead. Based on that, I can only deduct that you're both an idiot, and never amounted to anything in this game, but yet you have a very wide opinion on variety of topics you know nothing about. Fuck off bottom dwelling NOOB.
---
read it again.
---
"Not surprising, that people are defending this guy NOT being able to gank... .... lmao the current state of video games."
---
Is it not in a video game?
---
I was reading a guide that suggested using straight left/right instead of turn left/right.
---
I tried it out and can't seem to get the hang of it. Is it a popular thing to change or do most people stick with the defaults? I'd be willing to learn the muscle memory if I know it actually is well recommended.
---
I was talking about solo aoeing. It was my bad I jumped into the thread thinking about the wrong thing.
---
Well, what it is then? News? A tutorial?
---
Gnomes are garbage
---
I'm a healer and I like if there is some tempo. If I have good water is absolutely ok as soon as I am drinking. only thing that pisses me off is when they instantly pull the next pack so you are forced to drink where you are standing (usually a little bit behind) and then you are stuck drinking without line of sight. Just let me run to the front start drinking and we can instantly move on but if you don't give me out of combat time to do this I am stuck far away and everything gets very stressful.
---
No, I'm actually mimicking him, because he said "I'm going to beat your five characters with my one character".
---
I'm explaining why he can't do that to most multiboxers. That's my entire point.
---
It's not gatekeeping.  The feature is written right there in the name PVP server.
---
or maybe you need to grow up? exactly what you commented is just as much speculative bullshit as what i said so go ahead and fuck off if you dont have any actual points to make.
---
Is getting consecrate most important for pally tanking?
---
Gentlemen we are dealing with someone here who has absolutely no life.     
---
 How do you kill that which has no life?
---
Ahh give him a break, he's just trying to get that authentic Classic experience
---
&gt;If valve made StarCraft2 it would still be absolutely massive, but where is it now? It's such a cult status game, what a shame.
---
I'm not sure if this would necessarily be the case. Artifact turned out to be one of the biggest game flops in 2018, which went rather underreported because bigger flops such as Fallout 76 and ATLAS also happened around that time. Also, TF2 is barely updated these days, and Half-Life fans are probably comatose at this point, as the wait for Half-Life 3 gets longer and longer.
---
Is it pedantry to not want my kid to say "yeet"? Because to the rest of us English users he sound's like a fucking idiot and that's not cool.
---
Anyone that cries pedantic on the internet is just mad they were corrected by someone smarter than them. Kid's hear words and just say them without ever giving it a second though. Older folk with a firm grasp on the English language reserve the right to regard them quizzically and tell them they're doing it. That's what's happening here. 
---
Sorry you don't like being corrected.
---
Oh no the poor ganked gnome!
---
People play PvP for a reason and that's for shit like this to happen. World PvP is 90% ganks and abuse and everyone knows it.
---
Their time is more valuable than auto attacking you for no xp for 5 minutes.
---
and ...? You're still feared and have 5 corruptions and 5 agony's on you?
---
The salt mine is in full production
---
I want to as I live in Taiwan but I can’t login to the China battlenet. Do I have to pay again?
---
You really just need to locate GY and Lib, the other two have clearly labeled doors
---
Dungeons that your able to effectively spellcleave that I've tried, stockades, rfd, gnomer, all of SM, and zf. I've been doing it quite a bit since I've already quested to 60 on a warrior before. Now I'm soloing Mara and getting ready for brd spellcleave which is the fastest way to 60 just spamming the torch runs. It's pretty good and a lot of people are mad about it for some reason??
---
There's competition?
---
For guild messages, yea. That's why I'm getting the login message. I used to also get the logoff message, but that stopped yesterday, and I can't figure out why.
---
Dude if you've ever played wow you know that 80% of world pvp is people being dicks. But because someone was creative suddenly they're evil. It's not that deep.
---
whats a good addon that will show debuffs and stuff like that over a monsters head? tired of looking up
---
Where should I be heading to farm mageweave as well as questing? Level 40 and rocking it in dustwallow.
---
Well do you plan on doing world pvp at 60? And how much do you like playing your toon? Personally i was on a pvp server since vanilla and its just a cycle of being ganked and then retaliating on other people later on cuz it was done to me. Thats why im on a normal server in classic and its alot nicer. As far as what you should play try different things out! Theres no rush so just find what you enjoy.
---
Cry hordie trash
---
There’s a Gnome Mage quickly making themselves a name in my server, camping places like Tarren Mill while being lvl 60 and killing everyone on sight. 
---
Halsey of Bigglesworth, if you’re reading this... fuck you
---
I wish I had your confidence.
---
Sane people choose servers designated for something they have no desire in which to participate.  Fuck off.  You're something else.
---
what gives more exp at 40 RFD or SM Cath?
---
Breathtaking
---
I’d hardly call corpse camping PVP, more like player vs no chance in hell. Gained notoriety because it is generally a high level, or a bunch of high level characters, slaughtering lowbies or under-geared players. Was rampant in vanilla.
---
Is nobody on this sub capable of reading the flair of the post?
---
Dwarf hunters have been the biggest bunch of fuckwads while I've been leveling on rattlegore. Good job.
---
Someone get this man the Sword of A Thousand Truths.
---
I'm just making a point. You met a terrible multiboxer, who used classes that you counter with one single aoe spell.
---
Now compare this to a rogue who is forced into melee literally every fight.
---
You sound like a bitch. Roll on PVE and let it ride boss
---
Stalagg?
---
Does servers having 10x the pop or more of vanilla not factor in?
---
There is a quest where you talk to the hunter trainer in a capital city. Completing that quest should give you your revive pet skill. I did the same thing OP did.
---
Impose your way. I play how I want to and if someone complains I listen if It's understandable. Otherwise they follow my rythm.
---
&gt; So many people don't seem to get about world PvP that something can be allowed yet still be a dick move.
---
What does changing classes remedy exactly? If you enjoy playing a druid, then you should keep playing a druid. If you're wanting something different, then by all means, but I don't see what changing classes is going to do for you if the issue isn't disliking the class you're playing. It's not like druids are just good for pvp.
---
But I refuted it by providing a different example using *your* logic. I think you need to ask yourself that question.
---
So let's give an easy number of say 30% of your fighting while solo is melee compared to 100%. Sad.
---
It most likely ran away from lack of feeding.
---
Also would like to know about the mageweaves so bumping!
---
You mean I'd be able to remove any post I don't like and call it low effort?
---
Where do I sign?

I’m new to wow and started as a human warrior but didn’t like the class. Ended up going night elf Druid and it was a real bitch to get started.... there was almost nobody around to help with quests. I ended up traveling to SW and did my early game leveling in Goldshire instead.
---
Night elf area is dead as fuck and the quests are too hard to solo (for me atleast)

I'm a Gnome myself and I find this hilarious. Mostly because... 5 Curses and Spite live in each Gnome, this truth can't be ignored! / The best way to get rid of a Gnome is throw that Gnome overboard!

It's the laugh at the end, they know how much it makes you rage on the other side of the screen.

awesome , great work!

Checked into it, AQ and DM were out when the dungeon guide was made, but it didn't show abbreviations. But I found a pdf of the original official guide, and it states abbreviations for dungeons. VC was for Deadmines, no DM mentioned at all

You can also right click the portraits and select "unlock" so you can move them around, I think you can do that without addons?
---
FARM MY GOLD MINIONS!!!!
---
The difference is you have 5 people doing every quest at any given time in goldshire. Super easy to invite randoms and hammer out quests
---
Not really, spriest can do comparable damage on 3-4 targets and also off heal and passively heal with vampiric. Plus singletarget damage is pretty much spriest forte until everyone starts scaling with tier.
---
The big plus for twinks and people doing it (at least that was my reason) is that you can deck them out with equip and enchants once and after you have done this there is nothing you have to do to be on the cutting edge. The state of itemization is locked and easily achievable so you can treat a round of warning gulch like a quick counter strike game. You don't feel like you need to have invest time in the game anymore just to keep on an even playing field for what you actually want to do (PvP). Also at a certain state you encounter mostly or nearly exclusively only twinks as enemy's too, so it's not just like you are killing noobs.
---
The minus is that the game is unbalanced and many classes have not access to core abilities.
---
I can't answer, but in terms of looking up I have a few UI addons that let you move the panels around on the screen.
---
I have my target right above my toolbars and myself below that; works out real well as it keeps everything kn the mid part of the screeen near the aftion
---
Was your account less than 12 hours old or so? Blizz will set your account as starter for some hours when signing up, during that time you will keep dropping in the queue and won't be able to get transfer to load up, can take up to 12 hours or so to be set as a regular account.
---
From the official guide...
---
Someone obviously never played vanilla. Only played when LFG was a thing so you never knew the abbreviations.
---
ok wow thanks my eyes have been really struggling last few weeks and i thought it's just from playing too much wow. But turning off this glow fixed it immediately.  
---
Felt like i was looking through someone else's glasses, really straining to focus
---
mods favor the horde here so this makes sense
---
Hahaha really? Trying to wrap my head around that one!
---
You should really get help for your problems.
---
And all mobs lose aggro... and they'll usually turn and start attacking the other player. I think the bubble should have the one hour CD, not LoH.
---
I had a hunter acting shifty around me when I was leveling in Desolace (sea part no doubt) so I kept fearing him and he kept swimming deeper.  Eventually he drowned.
---
Mining all this salt is hilarious
---
This is all too real guys. It is actually getting worse. I caught my son in a 5-Mage group yesterday. All of them, just cleaving away.  Don’t think it can’t happen to you or your loved ones.
---
Yep. They had some bullshit excuses as to why they wouldn’t reward me the loot I won. Good old blizzard.
---
No you lose everything when you override a profession.
---
If your argument that taking mining is a "primary profession" because it locks you out of one of your profession slots, then lockpicking is even MORE restrictive because it locks you out of any other class.
---
If any dps starts with an aoe ability. (Very common) I don’t care what you’re using. There’s little chance you’ll hold more then 1 mobs Agro with zero rage. If there’s a skull and YOURE not waiting for AT LEAST a second or two you’re doing it wrong not the tank. This isn’t retail.
---
"had" in the strongest past tense sense. They had a pretty grumpy King of Lordaeron come through.
---
Honestly I wouldn't worry about it to much, I do the exact same thing and I play an orc warlock. I very rarely if ever go out of my way to attack alliance because I have the same mentality. I don't necessarily think it's bad really, I just choose when I want to PvP and when I don't. If you want to reroll because you don't like PvP with the chosen class then that's really a different story, perhaps you may like rogue if your used to stealth in cat form.
---
One of the first things I changed, and I haven't played in ages before classic, it just felt super unnatural to turn instead of strafe on WASD. Get in the habit of holding RMB when you move.
---
I have no idea which it was personally, but it was a former employee and I would think if people were farming gold for money there would be way more and it would be a more noticeable presence than it is
---
Nothing wrong with that. You got to experience two mmo universes!
---
I play on Chinese server. Its almost impossible to avoid a queue in the evening on most servers. When I go to the Internet cafes it's like 1/3 LOL 1/3 classic and 1/3 pubg players
---
they are in warcraft 3.
---
“It ain’t much but it’s mine”
---
It really is something special seeing all these people get so butthurt over this
---
Nope they're gone.
---
Is this a hate crime
---
I mean there's those groups, but there are also a lot of others that don't care as long as you're able to fulfill your role in the group.
---
How bad is hemo while leveling? I would love to change to hemo/preparation at 40 but o is the dps/rotation?
---
So you admit to having a small penis. Nice.
---
What's the advantage?

---
Lol you monsters
---
I decided that I may not raid at 60. I’m going to live in south shore and make sure none of the horde alts make it to 60! They are as dishonorable as they come so karma is gonna be a real bitch...
---
Yeah pretty much spot on.
---
Though Razorgore was more or less coordination for the MC'er and the tanks kiting shit than anything else.
---
Vael actually was pretty simple once people learned to DPS and run out of the raid with the bomb. (remember we were ALL terrible back then)
---
Nefs actually really easy once people know what's going on. Remember the adds affinity is set once per lockout and doesn't change after the first pull... so a proper strat can be formed!
---
You're not a healer or stupid.  Why bother drinking if you're only going to hit 30% per sit?  If you're good enough to go at 30%, than you can hit 100%, do several pulls, then cap up.  Not everyone has mage drinks, and if you don't, you waste your healers drinks which can add up quickly.  Basically, you're a fraud or you have a mage 100% supplying.  Not always the case.
---
Don't do this to your healers or you're a bad player.  If they are oom, wait for heaven's sake.
---
Go to searing gorge and kill the dark iron slave workers etc there. They’re in the middle of the map in the caves
---
I'm on arcanite reaper horde and its dead realm. There's hardly anyone lfg
---
That's a level 58-60 dungeon sir
---
The nicer you are to the healer the lower your dps is and the slower the fight gets and more heals on tank needed and more opportunities to fuck up. No one asks you to use all cds on small pulls, but holding back your dps for nothing is kinda stupid especially in dungeons before lvl50. 
---
I could heal 2 locks with hellfire plus tank as shadow priest, id rather mobs die faster so I can heal less. 
---
Don't spam lifetap instead of drinking tho, fuck that.
---
True. If I'm the only one in the group with a key to scholo I master loot everything to myself
---
Just because you don't like it doesn't mean it has no meaning.
---
A video game with an intense rivalry between two factions none the less.
---
Pulls more than 2 mobs... dps open on seperate mobs... taunt one... resisted. 2dps still tanking mobs for 10s while taunt comes off cd.
---
Can you help me find that video? I am trying to find it to show my brother but not having any luck finding it
---
The thing that bothers me most about this is he just drained a huge chunk of your mana and then gives you a solid 30 seconds of regen for no reason.
---
All he had to do was attack right away and you were likely done for.
---
Engineering is more fun and the bombs are great for 5mans. Blacksmithing has better hyperlategame if you get the recipes
---
Yeah, the higher up in dungeon content you go the more the difficulty nudges you towards the tank and spank method.
---
It's ok. In my original comment I mentioned grouping, just a misunderstanding. I was just trying to explain best i could without coming off as being an asshole.
---
Duskwood can work too
---
I'm actually just really concerned about where our turtle friend went. :(
---
You confuse people who can aoe and people who think your group can handle bigger pulls.
---
Spam SM cath runs with him
---
Lmao
---
“It’s not gatekeeping” said every gatekeeper ever.
---
Only time I've mind controlled people off the boat is when they dotted players much lower than them. It's a low blow, but should be expected on a pvp server. Go below deck or LOS priests if you're afraid.
---
god damn horde
---
Not a bug.... It's working exactly as intended and how it was in classic. you can freeze ice trap consistently if you know what your doing.
---
Freeze icetrap warriors or rogues that gank me all the time.
---
I don't know if your definition of bragging is narrower than most, but they are obviously bragging about having the idea, and the audacity to do it. And they think it's funny, their friends think it's funny, so they are also bragging about their level of humour aswell.
---
It's virtual high fives between "bros". Unless you're claiming everyone, including the gnome player, think it's funny?
---
Ohhhh. Thanks.
---
Does anyone have a list of good "turn your brain off and grind" spots? I'm a level 41 warrior so I'd prefer to kill things a few levels below me.
---
Bonus if they drop greys often enough that I can make a decent amount of gold over the course of grinding for hours. Currently at 75g of the 90 I need for my mount.
---
What does it matter? Dungeons pre-60 are a joke. Fury warriors pick up a shield, Feral Druids slap on some healer gear, literally any 3 other players walk in too...
---
Yay the dungeon is cleared.
---
Make a separate character to level and keep busy. Play your "Mains" only when both of you are on. Level the other char to your heart's content.
---
They're great in raids. The Gnomish Battle Chicken and the Arcanite Dragonling at least.
---
But generally certain things don't lend well to 1 stacks like cloth. Who ever only needs one cloth? It's good to stack in a few amounts, stack of 5, 10, 20.
---
Hate to tell you it's not new, people are people wherever you go whatever you do, and some of them are awful. This has been the case though out human history. We also tend to focus on the bad more than the good. I will say people have found new ways to be awful as time passes.
---
Just get used to how tank handles damage from first few pulls, then you know how much time you probably have to drink.
---
It probably rebelled from lack of loyalty.
---
Also mend pet does not change to revive when your pet dies. It's a unique spell all on its own. It will look like a hand with green around it.
---
If you don't have the spell revive pet then check your trainer, put pretty sure you get it from your quest
---
All that work... just to buy the ugliest raptor :(
---
Well... Architecturally speaking their city is placed in the former tombs of Arthas royal line, catacombs and sewers. Would have enjoyed more skulls like sewers of France or catacombs of Rome feel. Walls with murky flowers in remberance to dead family members who fell too the Scourge sort of Vietnam War memorial style.
---
I unsubbed because of all the bugs the hunter class has and how badly they have handled layering.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bwlfdu/the_definitive_hunter_bug_compilation_sheet/
---
Really is sad, you get a better vanilla experience on pserver's than what Blizzard can do officially...
---
Dragonlings have saved my ass a handful of times in both pvp and pve. I would say they are very good, especially when leveling.
---
All these people saying it's over the line, but if it's red it's dead and if it's a gnome then play with your food.
---
Can we be careful with the generalizations here? There are some packs where a tank will absolutely die in less than 10 seconds if they don't receive a heal.
---
It’s a shame to see how toxic Mages have become. Used to be nice little gnomes that dished out free food and booze and zapped away quietly. Now they’re these raging man-baby monsters
---
Imagine being this triggered by people playing a video game.
---
Shimmering flats will always have a special place in my heart. So many hours spent PvPing there.
---
You guys are so good gathering as a raid group gank on players that are 20 levels below you.
---
That was amazing.
---
In the future my dude, you can record sound from wow without having other sounds get in the way. Download razer surround. Then open wow. Select wows device to be the razer surround device. You'll still be able to hear game volume. Then in your recording software tell it also to record the razer surround device. If you've done it correctly your clips will have just wow sound, no discord, youtube, etc.
---
Oh man wasn't aware master looter was a red flag like that. So it's only really for raids huh?
---
This is cool in a way, you really have to communicate and trust people.

---
Good, alliance scum.
---
It's a little lower and you won't have blade flurry or adrenaline rush. Same general strat, open, quick SnD, hemo, etc. You'll have better openers, and will be very survivable with prep.
---
But if it's more fun for you, try it out. If you're not 60 yet, you're not rushing that much. Take your time and enjoy the leveling process. There's fun in variety.
---
Imagine being triggered by my comment xD
---
The point isn't that you will stop before reaching max mana. Instead it is that a priest that knows what they are doing can drink until the warrior is 30-50% hp (and the priest will have 100% Mana by then) and cast a single greater heal.
---
While leveling Mana efficiency is all about the five second rule.
---
Plus if you smart you'll be using the bad mage water or some of the cheap lower lvl water you have to keep yourself topped off between pulls and almost never need a full expensive drink.
---
PS. Time is money friend. While you sit in a 30m dungeon for 1-2 hours I'll be running another or questing and making more silver than the low cost of some water.
---
I like playing batman in pvp. I will sit in stealth and wait for horde to try and gank then I kill them.. If I'm just passing by and see a horde about to die to an npc I'll usually save them bow and be on my way. Maybe it'll save the next guy they run into. I love world pvp but I don't see the fun in killing someone I know I can destroy unless they are being a turd. Don't let people give you shit. Play a class that makes you happy. My wife plays the druid and loves it. (unless your a boomkin then God have mercy on your soul.. Kidding lol)
---
Can confirm that freezing trap doesn’t reflect to hunter in classic, but I was immune to it and avoided the cc. Can’t comment on how it was in vanilla
---
Go up there?
---
Correct, that's Questie. Probably needs an update to look like that
---
Is this racism?
---
Just remember not to go stealing any nice Paladin hammers once you’ve learned it
---
Hot damn!
---
A lot of people find efficiency fun, can't really blame them.
---
Neither of us are :D But perhaps the spirit...
---
I just went through this, am a 36 mage who is trying to AOE as much as possible.
---
28-32 is a huge wall IMO. Everything feels so slow. Just gotta push through, I recommend questing to 35. The 30-35 aoe grinding spots are not that great.
---
I just hit murlocs in Dustwallow and it feels good again to AOE
---
Your UI is phenomenal.
---
Oh God yes! I had to roll PvP because open world PvP has the opportunity to create memorable stories like this. 
---
I understand I will get shafted sometimes, but other times I will fight off a 2v1 gank, or a long staredown with an enemy, waiting to see who will crack first under the tension. It's so worth it. 
---
You cant just do that in battlegrounds
---
Hey now, it’s called Jarate.
---
I know many of the same people that cry here for not getting invited in these groups also refuse to invite people like me who play balance druid or other "trash tier" spec. Double standards all the way.
---
\&gt;  The problems have just been given a megaphone due to right wing radicalization 
---
I was on board until this. You're missing the point: left == right and they both use the same crap. There is a Third Position.
---
Basically the orcs have no world to go back to, the Horde is working to put an end to factions affiliated with the Burning Legion and The Lich King and the various imperialist trolls, and the Grimtotem tauren certainly can't be trusted (but the Bloodhoof clan has barely united the tauren at this point, so Magara Grimtotem has her seat among the elders of Thunder Bluff for now)
---
The tauren and Darkspear trolls have taken the orcs under their wing to reintroduce them to shamanism, which has helped them understand that harmony with the elements is a strength they always had. Having no home to return to, they made one in the unsettled country of Durotar, displacing no indigenous people to do so. I don't know if you've been, but it's not verdant land at all, hardly suitable for pig farming, hence the need to utilize the forests of Ashenvale nearby for timber, which the Kaldorei oppose (yet they offer no alternative, why? Elven superiority complexes is as good a guess as any)
---
The Forsaken are just trying to rebuild their homeland and return to something like normalcy with this new life they've been given. They attempted to join the Alliance first, as all their ordinary citizens were humans in the Alliance (as was Sylvanas a high elf ranger general in the Alliance), and still have living family members in the Alliance. They'd love nothing more than to have peaceful family reunions, but the Alliance rejected them. Only the empathetic tauren, of all races, took pity on them
---
No, you're pathetic and pedantic. At least the other guy can admit to being a pedant.
---
I feel like there are so many terrible rogues out there right now. I was in ST. today killing raptors and a 42 human rogue opened up on me. 
---
I'm level 31 and I destroyed him .  11 level difference. All I saw was a skull but apparently this guy's been running around killing lowbies and getting chased by their friends all day.
---
Literally the only difference is how they look
---
Take it a step further and unbind back pedalling.
---
Which just so happens to be spikes and skulls

not all of us ;/

make me wish i started on the same server as my dad hes more PvE im more PvP tho
---
Welcome to any RPG/MMO ever made.
---
As a paladin, you’ll only be considered as a healer at end game. Retribution is a notoriously bad Damage class so there’s not much to look forward to there. 
---
If healing isn’t for you, then realistically the thing you have to look forward to is rerolling
---
PFFFFT SURE BUDDY
---
I said nicer, not easy. I’m still gunna life tap a couple of times a pull. 4 dots costs me like 30% of my mana
---
Report all those sickos. It doesn't belong in WoW
---
Serious question, do you mind being the puller/healer bodyguard?
---
God damn, I've neve been more proud of the Horde.
---
They could probably patch something to fix this, but then it wouldn't be Classic anymore I guess...
---
The salt in this thread, enough to make a gordon ramsey burger
---
&gt;Groups reserving HOJ, Dal Rends, righteous orbs etc? That’s crazy. If you run a dungeon you should roll against others for the item you want. That’s how that shit works.
---
That type of behaviour very much existed in vanilla according to my friends who've been playing since then.
---
Overall I do feel MMOs have become more elitist since vanilla. Classic has clawed back a good chunk of it, but the general attitude still exists.
---
The key is making MMOs that are social, where elitism gets pushback due to needing people more than needing good people.
---
the equivalent of what? every single horde class? as a gnome mage im usually happily on my way to the next quest until i get ganked, by literally every single class besides mage. as the great lil john once said, "dont start no shit wont be no shit". i kill every horde on sight now because im so fucking tired of being 2/3/4/5v1 or ?? or during combat. the horde started it, they are gonna have to deal with the fallout now
---
don't see what could be fun about running around spamming arcane explosion ad nauseam
---
Alliance sucks
---
Exceptions to the rule
---
At least I'm not an idiot and a sensitive baby, if we're slinging insults. Good argument/counter-point though. You really presented your evidence and drilled it home.
---
Best comment on the thread.
---
I'm playing a rogue, and I only level with a warlock friend whos voidwalker is always tanking. Would it be more viable to play a backstab spec with this? I also want to spec for world pvp fun. Currently lvl 19.
---
What cast bar addon is that?
---
Wtf, are you guys related to Satan?
---
Mage here. When I pull aggro I move to tank to allow tank to grab aggro back easier, not to affect healing in any way. It’s basically me helping tank take control back bc I screwed up.
---
It’s absolutely fine. I’m deep Ret and always heal in dungeons. You need to make sure you have a full separate outfit of cloth / leather / whatever gear that has lots of +int or +healing to put on for dungeons. Take a look on the AH - there’s quite a lot of cheap cloth gear with good stats at your level. Get an intellect elixir to guzzle at start of dungeon too
---
Probably.  Using terrain to make yourself unattackable while being able to attack is not fair, and Blizzard doesn't have a "if its in the game, its in the game" philosophy.  They can and will temp ban you for breaking the rules even if the software doesn't enforce them.
---
Right now, yes. After later phases there is a ton to do. Think of this in terms of when the game came out. It's a simple game which will soon have much more to do. You might also be frustrated with the class you picked. If you are leveling Ret, it can be VERY simple. But other classes are much more intricate. That could be something to look forward to. Don't forget to train new abilities at your trainer. I hope this helps.
---
Slow down and read the quests, they are very interesting and will place purpose as to why you are running around doing this and that.
---
The gameplay loop is gonna consist of killing and killing.  So if you aren't feeling the gameplay I don't know what to tell you.
---
Doing dungeons and hanging out with people is a blast, becoming friends and having great conversations while "grinding" makes it a great social experience.
---
Getting a mount @ 40 is a great achievement since at that level gold isn't super easy to come by plus the time invested shows that you earned it.  So ride it proudly, people notice it trust me.   :)
---
Grinding over and over for experience and loot is the core gameplay loop in every RPG.  Diablo, Wow, Path of Exile, Elder Scrolls, ect.    
---
Anyways, hopefully you find a "groove" that you enjoy.  But if you aren't feeling the game then consider not playing it.  Not every game is gonna appeal to every gamer unfortunately.  Hope that helps.   :)
---
Hey, I hope this doesn't break any rules. I do not condone bots or any form of cheating and I hope no one goes out of their way to harass any individual in this video. This is to show that bots potentially do exist in Classic and Blizzard should keep an eye out.
---
Likely doable as another class but unless it's rogue you're gonna need to pack a bunch of invisibility potions! haha
---
game is riddled with bugs. we’ll see more and more surfacing soon as people settle in.
---
There is an undead mage on Incendius with over 70k gold. He was not banned after the layering exploit bans went out. Idk how they do it man, it seems so fishy to me
---
make macros for all of your abilities and put in /cancelaura power word sheild so it will just remove it every time they put it on you
---
Haven’t encountered any toxicity at all really. All my dungeon runs have been with super patient, cooperative crews. But as a hunter I’d never be invited to those spellcleave groups anyway and feel fine about that.
---
Starcraft as a esport did not fumble lmao, it was way bigger than anything early 2010s, mobas are just easier to watch and get into in general so they overtook starcraft, to say sc2 fumbled esports wise is a fucking massive disrepect to the impact it had and the views it got
---
They can't fix it, this is Classic. The only thing that can be fixed is things that aren't properly Classic to make them the way they were.
---
All gnomes are KOS
---
Someone asks this in every single post

A distributed denial-of-service attack.

You have to wonder at the mentality of the people who would do such a thing. He only gets to play a few hours on the weekend, and the people DDOS him.

Because they didn't have them 15 years ago.

The people who played vanilla should know from experience that there is no "right way". I'm pretty sure it's just a bunch of kids who bought into the hype too strongly.

Take note futher mucker!
---
Reminds me of a survival hunter i saw once named Beargrylls

As opposed to killing one at a time while still spamming one ability?
---
we can thank Faxmonkey for this.
---
This is one of the few things I wish they'd changed.
---
Swamp of sorrows jaguars. They drop grey stuff that sell for a lot to vendors. Even better if u have skinning for hides.
---
I’m wondering if it’s just lack of nostalgia for me, I’ve definitely had some fun but I just feel like there’s no real ‘reason’ to keep leveling, no huge spike or achievements from what I’ve seen
---
I'm sword spec combat but I keep a dagger in my bags for Ambush+weapon swap opener. And you can still garrote otherwise.
---
I mean there are wands with strength too.
---
Well other people don't have to deal with WoW players nearly as much as WoW players.
---
Not everything has to be a super fair even fight all the time, sometimes people just like to have fun. It's fine. PVE servers if you're scared
---
Yeah, this guy has no clue how to play a lock. [This is how you play a lock!](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/BewitchedDisfiguredImago-mobile.mp4)

Far right radicalization is MUCH more of a problem online then left wing radicalization. Go spend 10 minutes on /pol/ and then go ahead and find me a leftie equivalent.

The both sides shit is really dumb m8

Thats when you gather up your friends after being humiliated like this and gank them back ofc. Or cry to yourself. :)
---
Please donate to my yeti conservation fund, we are losing one every minute and we need to stop this before its too late.
---
Pretty sure thats per item
---
This is what I’m thinking too, plus I don’t have the nostalgia element so for me it’s been fun but there’s no reason to keep leveling past 30 especially when endgame raids are done by people below max level within days of release
---
oh it is absolutely worth the effort. Alone in the outdoor world if nobody is around to fuck with you, it is *by far* faster than any other method of experience gain period.
---
Hi! I am a foreigner living in China and playing on China servers. I seriously want to be able to play with other English speakers. Can someone connect me to a guild of English speakers on China servers plz
---
The item stuff is true. But that was discussed right as the group formed. If you didn't like it you found another group. There's plenty of time &amp; plenty of people so don't worry about not running a dungeon tonight.
---
God, seeing this makes me want to roll a rogue.
---
I  got alt-o-holic-ism.
---
Leveled a hunter to 11, then switched to priest and got that to 16, then switched to druid and got that to 27, now I want to level rogue &gt;_&gt;
---
Maybe I should just stick with druid, druid can still do good cat form damage in pvp I think. idk, I like druid because of the utility it brings (also the passive speed boost is fuckin sweet)
---
Who knows what servers will look like even 3 months from now, things could change fast!  Hang in there!
---
oGlow
---
D&amp;D
---
Probably no one would even know what character he was trying to portray.
---
Gratz!
---
Tarren Mill was such a nightmare when I first hit 20. There was a constant wall of alliance standing just out of range of the guards. I ended up going to the barrens instead. Now theres always some level 40+ players hanging around to protect the lower level players.
---
I just wanted to comment because I fucking LOVE your name! That's such an amazing song by my favorite band!
---
As a rogue with herbalism I have no idea what it costs.
---
Silverpine Forest is the best zone. It is a haunted forest, you have Greymane rebels stranded outside and fighting for their lives, Sons of Arugal stalking the woods, and undead trying to secure the land. All the homes are falling apart, too, with Scourge running about.
---
It's also a prominent WarCraft 3 zone where Tyrande made an alliance with Kael'thas on the basis they're elves.
---
You are good mate. World PvP is not necessarily ganking everybody and their mama. It is about being able to.
---
I have PvP'ed for years and I thoroughly enjoy it. However, just like you, when I see another player questing or struggling, I won't go after them. Granted, if it happens to me, I'll go out of my way to corpse camp the enemy.
---
Class-wise, it's up to you whether playing a druid tickles your fancy. Happy hunting!

They won't change something until naxx is out I guess

as opposed to some vague, one word edgy name like &lt;Ascension&gt; or &lt;Omen&gt;?
---
Not sure what kind of abacus you are using where I am drinking for an hour and a half in a 30 min dungeon.
---
Waiting an extra 10 seconds so I don't have to waste money seems like a small concession for my group to make considering I am healing.
---
thanks, fixed
---
Man, I think back to vanilla healing and wanting to end it all.
---
uh you okay dude?
---
TBH Hidden Enemies is still one of my favorite quest chains, I can't help but do it on every new character I make.
---
No it's cool my girlfriend is fucking pissed lol
---
She will survive
---
Incredible
---
I heard they're planning on a second movie, even though it kinda flopped- because the Chinese ratings were so good?
---
Hey I am a foreigner living in China and playing on Chinese servers because of better ping. Do you know how Chinese are playing on USA servers with good ping? Or is this all Chinese living in China. Ideally I want to play with other English speakers.
---
Not everything. There's a series of quests in darkshore where they're puzzled with the appaerance of beast with pandaren shrines on them.
---
In his defense, his verbage implies you'll be the one healing your friends, not that you'll have friends to heal you.
---
Hey bro no offense but even if you'd spent all that time on 1 char you'd barely be level 25.
---
It's not like you can just do 4*13=52 and claim you'd be 52. Levelling is heavily weighted towards the top end: i.e. 44 is only halfway to 60.
---
Just making sure those gnomes are good and hydrated
---
I'll always say it, for every occasional toxic/unpleasent interaction think that the game doesn't prevent that activity. But for those rare events, think of all the good ones that happen. The game isn't enforcing that behaviour either.
---
I feel it makes interactions more genuine.
---
I’m on Benediction which is pretty 50/50 and it’s still a horde camp fest
---
Lol, literally
---
Dude, water is expensive! Unless we have a mage if I start drinking you're on your own til I finish lol.
---
Aside from Duskwood: Stranglethorn Vale.
---
All the literary references like the Hemingway hunting quests or Colonel Kurzen/Joseph Conrad/Heart of Darkness-stuff are truely brilliant.
---
FOR THE HORDE!
---
Imagine caring this much ab fake internet points lmao
---
How do I do the "xxx is curious what you are up to"
---
Here's how i play:
---
poly pull, kill incoming with rotation of scorch for clearcasting, when clearcasting triggers i cast arcane missiles then go back to scorch. With this rotation i have pretty much no downtime.
---
Having to think about poly timer while scorch-fishing clearcasts for which you have about 0,5 seconds to react to is a lot more fun and engaging, let me tell you
---
Lmao oops
---
Sounds like a warlock who was invited into a spellcleave group, doesn't know exactly how it works but can see it is quite fast and now expects it dspite knowing nothing.
---
Any caster doing spellcleave should know what a regular comp runs like too and adjust their playstyle.
---
I think it depends on the pull. There are plenty of times where if I sit and you pull 2-3 you'll be 100% fine by the time the drink is done. But if I just sit and you run into an entire room plus a boss, I really don't have time to drink before you'd be dead.
---
IMO it all depends on the pull.
---
Oh my god this would be fucking LIT
---
Warlock tank my dude! won't work on every boss, but some of them
---
I always see alliance players complaining about this stuff, but they do it to horde players too. I think allys just whine more.
---
Qin Ruo would be a good transliteration, like the Saurfang one.
---
Music? I just have Netflix on the other monitor. Currently rewatching Star Trek TNG
---
If the gnome didn't find that death funny, he shouldn't be playing on a pvp server.  He's going to experience many more world pvp deaths with considerably less humor involved.
---
People really out here psychoanalyzing some horde killing an alliance lmao
---
Try healbot. Takes all the effort you "should" be spending to macro up your spells automatically for you and includes the incoming heals on the frames. You will need to extract the addon folder and drop the version suffix from the folder name for it to work. Gl
---
Pally tanks are missing too many important tanking abilities, sadly. Also too mana hungry for available gear. 
---
It works to a point (no need to be optimal in vanilla) but eventually the specs just broken.
---
Bear tanks work, if you want to go against the current. Easier to level than warriors, too.
---
We are talking about aoe inside instance.
---
Oh yeah they are.  In TBC, my husband used to play paratrooper paladin and drop from his flying mount and bubble on the way down to kill alliance players.
---
Are you sure you aren't the kid?
---
GNOME LIVES MATTER
---
You're asking for proof layering in dungeons and raids was being exploited? There was a whole kerfluffle about it just a few days ago.
---
Ok then, I zucchini.
---
&gt; any macro to hit so **I don't have to do each Totem individually?**
---
Not sure how you arrived at one by one in four separate presses from  "not individually".
---
I asked a mage in IF if he could make food around lvl 30. His response was "Not for free"...
---
I just right click it off lo
---
Lol O4
---
If the first message that i receive is "Hey, why you bot?" i would ignore you too ;)
---
I think the reason is that SOMETIMES the chest is already unlocked and you don't need a rogue to open. So you roll on it. But every once in a while it is and its viewed as an unfortunate exception, not the rule. And the group is hoping the rogue can help smooth the locked chest hiccup out of the way. There is never an herb or ore that anyone BUT herbalists and miners can acquire in the wild. Those are always and COMPLETELY exclusive, which is why no one rolls on them.
---
Not saying its right or wrong, just helping with understanding.
---
War criminals
---
If its only taking 10 seconds, why wouldn't you have the tank pull? It takes more than 10 seconds for their hp to be low enough that you should be casting a heal.
---
To me it was more the fact that he blocked me after. Just seemed really bizarre ^^
---
Typical horde behavior.
---
I’ve experienced the exact opposite happening, I’ve been stuck in STV for over a week cause every time I try and do anything I get murdered by a skulled horde or about 7 of them gang banging me
---
Good mod
---
its funny coz i called out some alliance people for crying about getting ganked by a horde.. dude its a pvp server it happens and just so you know hordes do camp at lakeshire too and camps lvl 20+ alliance..
---
And rivers of blood of our enemies.
---
...That just happened to be there.
---
I /fart on everyone because I’m a dwarf named Farrt. Should’ve been Farty.
---
Well. I'm not hyperventilating from laughing at this and sleep deprivation while I'm supposed to be getting ready to sleep. So thanks.
---
Make sure no one dies. Healing in a nutshell.
---
Ehhh. Anytime alliance has EVER been red, I get attacked. The times I’m not, it’s because solo alliance near my level. K. Cool. Numerous in a pack? Doesn’t happen often, but most times, they gank me. I’ve been in a pack too. “Hey there’s a “blank” lvl ‘dadada’, should we get em?
---
Like I do and don’t wanna.... I’m still open to do it though. PvP and all. Plus they didn’t wave... Fuck it. On the way to BFD. Goodnight sweet prince....
---
Still not a MC/environment death. Plus, just the once...
---
&gt; You're asking for proof layering in dungeons and raids was being exploited? 
---
I am asking for proof of layering being used in raids not in dungeons. 
---
&gt; There was a whole kerfluffle about it just a few days ago.
---
This was about dungeons. The only raid bug shown was not a layering issue and could not be recreated consistently.
---
Rogue is great due to being able to start fights whenever you want
---
Please refrain from doing so in The Barrens
---
I’ve yet to encounter anything like that. I did see someone in chat early on reserving DM gear and he got roasted to hell and back for it. I’m also running as a healer, so if/when I do start encountering the worst of them, it’s not hard to dip out and find another group quick. Let them sit and spam chat for another twenty minutes.
---
Yes that makes sense but I still found it funny lol
---
which addon is that for your group ui? :) blizz frames are really buggy!
---
Yea second this.   I walk by green and grey horde all day, horde do not extend even remotely the same courtesy when I'm green/grey to them.  But eh it's a pvp server!
---
If you like to support others a dwarf priest should always be a welcome addition to pvp groups. Heal and spam Fear Ward. Other players are happy to do the dirty work.
---
That's different from the classic db data.1
---
Those people are dreaming for now. There's too many gold sinks like epic mount, level 60 gear, professions and what have you. Then there is also the fact that BGs aren't released so people wont spend that much gold on something thats useless for several months. 
---
150-250g now would be a good sell. Holding it a few months and +500g is realistic.
---
BUT WHAT DOES IT SAY ABOUT SOCIETY?!?!?
---
Because I never played much Horde until Classic, I am more familiar with Alliance perspective. 
---
I like Darkshore a lot. Apart from me being a sucker for night elves, Darkshore quests are basically dealing with the aftermath of the War of Ancients. The idea of something happened 10,000 years ago still leave heavy scars even on the far side of the world is simply much too appealing. Some of the quests also show the communication with other races, mostly dwarves. The long quest chain which asks you to kill a highborne mage/warlock/shadow priest is a fine example of both (as you get in touch with two human paladins during the process). 
---
Edit: deleted the part about Duskwood.
---
I can tell from from how they "need" all of them
---
I don't believe that..
---
holy shit lol
---
I instantly assume you'd be terrible at it. It's a stupid term, I get it. But people use it to differentiate the comp, and I mean, I'm fine with that. It's not super simple to do, though. So instantly assuming anyone using that term is a terrible player is a stupid thing to say.
---
It’s likely a numbers thing, since it’s horde dominant on almost every pvp. Alliance tend not to try and stir shit up while the horde know they’ve got friends to cry to.
---
You can grab multiple enemies quick off the bat, but every second the battle lasts, the worse you'll do, especially with the primary target, even if you salv your team.  You have no taunts, and when you run out of mana, you can't provide anything.  
---
It's also slow. You need to spend a lot of time drinking between pulls.  Healers can drink between pulls because the tank can grab a new pack and take a few hits before the healer needs to stop drinking.  When the tank needs to drink, you're putting the group on hold.
---
It's fun, it's neat, I wish it worked better, but it doesn't.  That's not to say you cannot pull it off, but it will probably take a lot more effort, gear, consumables, and tricks to make it work compared to your average warrior or bear.
---
Nice! Looks like that it a big accomplishment for you guys. Congrats.
---
Get at new keyboard, your capslock botton is clearly broken.
---
GRATZ!!!
---
(haters gonna hate)
---
But you’re also seemingly ignoring the fact that YOU almighty rogue didn’t make it to that locked chest past x guards and bosses all by yourself. Why should everyone else in your group volunteer their labor of leveling up and honing their class to get the group through a dungeon to where a chest exists just so you get all the loot from the chest? How freakin selfish do you have to be to see yourself as the only one who has put in any effort here and the only one who did any work deserving of the contents of said chest.
---
Congratulations!
---
You sound like someone who should be playing on a pve server
---
&gt;waste 300g on a level 40 purple or level, hit 60 and grab deflector
---
🤔
---
Seems pretty cut and dry to me... Blizzard owns the game and sets the rules. Blizzard says it's not okay, therefore it's not okay.
---
There is no argument to be had otherwise really, and if someone doesn't like it, they're free to unsub. The rules have been like this since at least 2005 and I'm fairly certain that blizzard has weighed the risk of lost subs from gankers versus the lost subs from the ganked and has decided to side with the ganked.
---
Furthermore, in almost all cases of mild to moderate infringement blizzard gives a warning first, so if you choose to continue the behaviour that got you warned, don't come and bitch about your ban.
---
That shield's effect enabled aoe dungeon farming for paladins. It's insanely good. Look up some old vanilla Hobbs videos for proof. This shield is how paladins make tons of gold. Grab a mage buddy and you two will be raking in the gold.
---
At least Arthas didn't die like a bitch
---
As long you don't use your phone to record your screen I think you're good!
---
Just say you're a leper gnome and none will be the wiser.
---
8 year olds ? That's how most people act. That's how all of us act to a varying extent. We generalize and we put things in boxes, that's how our brain handles information. That dude's an extreme case but let's be real, we all do it.
---
This is not what he is looking for at all
---
That UI is straight out of 2006, bitch please.
---
You can tank dungeons fine, raids are gonna be harder
---
The VW is not really going to be able to hold aggro against you, but that doesn't mean that it is necessarily a bad idea. Just one or two backstabs against most mobs with a second person is a kill.
---
Time is money friend.
---
I hate the people stayin around in the middle of it
---
Was doing that same quest earlier today and a warrior charged me (a druid) while underwater to get the clam I was opening. Me, being a squishy druid, panicked into aquatic form and start trying to get away with him chasing me down. Then I get the idea to just root him and let him drown. As I'm casting Entangling Roots he drowns by himself lol Guess he forgot to get air while rushing for that clam.
---
Ah, one of the morons
---
Get a group go up there and ROFL Stomp them who cares if guards cant get their you can.
---
Lol i was in the group of 5
---
OP,  you're a fool if you sell that shield.

---
Doing the light's work! 
---
-friendly neighborhood dwarf
---
For sure! Your attitude is great and I’m having a blast so far, so not hitting the panic button! Thank you!
---
They should be allowed to roll. Hell, tanks on 60 roll on whatever they like and no one will say anything to that tank because his ms could very well be dps but he is just tanking now. 
---
I guess if they want a tank who only takes tank gear they should sit there for an eternity in LFG trying to find a tank who doesn't care about PVP, epic mount, or anything involving gold really.
---
Also, if not otherwise stated need is need. It'd be nice of you to pass on that OS piece gor someone elses MS but it cannot be expected in PuG's.
---
There was a hunter named gogo on blackwing lair US who did his farming in the same spot. I killed a horde who was attacking him once, and he gave me 200 gold and a buncha runecloth.
---
Hope he's doing well, wherever he is.
---
triple dot everything, pull everything, drain tank while jerking it to your 250dps yessssssssssss
---
Yes after killing you, the creatures will start pounding your bags and stomping on them out of spite.
---
Help your guild members, get profs to max with all the good recipes, level your alts.
---
Most importantly have gold ready for the later phases. You'll save a lot of pain in the long run if you can get the farming done now in the "baby phase" instead of trying to farm gold when you're running MC/Ony/BWL/AQ40 once a week + ZG/AQ20 twice a week.
---
This is why all zugs are kill on sight.
---
for spellcleave groups, is the improved blizzard + permafrost necessary or as long as 1 mage has the talents its fine?
---
No, your example is completely different scenario you fucking moron.
---
As someone who comes to WoW from competitive games, the blatant unfairness is just shocking. It’s not *bad*, but it is certainly different.
---
Terrible
---
Multiboxer
---
These words are interchangeable
---
No that’s reasonable.
---
Often the best talents are near the end of the tree.
---
Ice barrier for example is great.
---
Yeah they are both denying players from their group.  Same action but different reasons.
---
got more on that photo? that guy looks so aggrieved. i'm guessing justifiably.
---
image search just shows sites with an image of two paragraphs about it.
---
e.g. https://me.me/i/chinese-league-of-legends-player-nam-xian-recently-got-beaten-837886
---
Haha. I love this game. I spent an hour the other day mind controlling filthy horde off the boats. It's so much more fun than doing WQ. At one point this dude got so mad he got a party of 5 to try and kill me. I just /spit and logged off. He must be so mad. 😂
---
All spell cleave is aoe, but not all aoe is spell cleave
---
I don't remember, is safespotting allowed in Classic, or is it only a violation on private servers?
---
And we wonder why people say Horde are the bad guys
---
You’ve got something wrong with you dude.  Let it go.  You already outed yourself as moron, we get it.
---
It just bugs me the havent updated the lore of the starting zones since Cat. Make a forsaken and go to solverpine and you'll see Sylvanas get her ass chewed out by Hellscream. Then take a 5 minute walk into Sylvanas' room in Undercity and suddenly she's Warchief.
---
Your "other nodes" argument isn't false, it's just flaccid.
---
Gatherers **do not have a right** to harvest nodes with impunity, they only get to do so **at the generosity of the group** due to the nodes not being very valuable.  This generosity is not extended to rogues because chests have something potentially much more valuable.
---
Do people roll for gathering nodes not in their profession? Not generally, but that's because people don't want to waste the bag space or time rolling on 1-3 random herbs/ore.  If the group stated beforehand "Hey, we'll be rolling for profession mats this run" I'd be fine with giving up the herb.  But it doesn't happen because they're not valuable enough, so it has become status quo to let gatherers gather.
---
Now if you saw instances with spawns of black lotus, there would definitely be some rolling by the whole group, *because they're valuable.*   Just like chests usually have something somewhat valuable in them.  Chests cross the threshold from waste-of-space to something-good-maybe-great.
---
What addons allows you to see what hes casting?
---
Now you can start playing the game.
---
No bug.
---
Theres a hill that you can jump off of to get ontop of some rooftops in darlshire.
---
&gt; I've literally been running everywhere between cities. 
---
No one, mage or not, does this. People fly between cities. 
---
I also never got any sense of accomplishment or return from flying back to SW or IF, prior to getting teleports.
---
I'm playing a lock now and it probably just means I won't be able to quest in Kalimdor. As a mage, I can do that since I can just set my hearth in Gadgetzan or wherever and teleport back to SW if I need to. As a warlock, it'd take me half an hour just to make it to Stormwind.
---
Report, ez ban.  10 min of fun to just get banned. Cool guy.
---
Level alt, farm more gold, go gank people your level, go gank people not your level, collect consumables and materials you expect to need in future raids but not in current content.
---
What about my post implied condescension? Was it the tone you read it in? That’s on you, dude.
---
Bahahahahaha
---
The difference is that ''spellcleave'' is actively looking for locks or mages. There are plenty of locks and mages out there that don't even do these kind of runs. So disallowing them doesn't make any sense at all tbh.
---
Rank 3 isn’t too hard.
---
You must have 10 kills each week to get any kind of progression (if you miss this you will decay - but not too significant at the low ranks).
---
Complete guess but 5 battlegrounds each week for 4 weeks will probably get you there.
---
Level 35 is the minimum level you need to max out professions so even if you abandon this char as your main it'll still be worth keeping this one for regular transmutes etc.
---
This guy Spiritz
---
Now, China being China, I would not be surprised if they were bots.
---
It isn't too an abstract a concept. Very funny, though, you missed the point.
---
 "we want this item so no competitor please" its ok. the second part that's what make it elitist."without us, you're not gonna find group, so we let you dps for us, but no loot, remember"
---
Enjoy retail till update with other phase is up? + alt lvling
---
I didnt mean major cities but all cities. Some zones i wasnt aware of flight points. I was just stuck in exploration mode.
---
Man, we’re the best!
---
dang... It was a nice little exploit.  shame they fixed it.
---
This happened to me three times with three different people today. I now advertise when I join a party all BoE gear will be needed on by everyone. From there, it may be traded.
---
And yet other explanations are unlikely, compared to the most possible one, that he got invited to another layer and disappeared.
---
Level an alt (maybe consider opposite faction to experience their quests if you never did them before), grind out professions or reputations, try get barons mount or other faction mounts for bragging rights.
---
this is bad but i've seen wayyyyyyyyy worse in the private server forums/reddits over the years, and even a guy in my guild a few years ago had way worse.
---
he has his bags open so it makes it look a bit worse than it is (of course, it is still pretty bad)
---
My guy
---
In fifteen years you were never attacked by a single player? Really?
---
This. Literally all the kiddos are rolling horde, just by looking at these comments for 2 minutes you already know. Glad i rolled ally this time around tbh.
---
You rat faced bastard
---
Crap I thought I edited that comment from my phone but I apparently failed.  Is fixed now!
---
I totally remembered it backwards; it was indeed the PvP rank [I gave up on](https://i.imgur.com/GAC51q4.png). :D

(Hey rank 9 wasn't *too* shabby though ...)

EDIT: I submit my [proud af moonfire vael kill](https://i.imgur.com/sQ29hhe.jpg) and [runfast set + sexy feral Naxx chest](https://i.imgur.com/hLcReVQ.jpg) as "proof" that I was actually there and am just a bit forgetful. :D
---
As a druid on a pvp server 
---
You're meant to respect the druid code 
---
Meaning dont kill other druids in the world unless you have too.
---
Priest or warrior? My friend group already has one of each but what is more useful? Is it better to have an extra tank or healer more?
---
Westfall
---
In game.
---
Best music
---
This is exactly why *everyone* should be rolling need on rare/epic BOE’s
---
:c
---
I forget if /say worked, since it's common language, orcish, etc, but I know the emotes worked for sure since we had a few occasions were I'd be MCing a priest from the other side to tell their GM to get on mIRC over world raid bosses and such.
---
Underrated comment
---
Oh man, this really is a blast from the past. I remember that spot
---
Lumberjack cleave
---
It's supposed to be brown and depressing which is what makes its quest and zone story so interesting. Most of the horde zones minus the eastern kingdoms are brown and depressing they just have more spikes.
---
Priest.
---
Really hard not to group with them when they have nearly every 60... They literally wont party with you unless you join their guild. Which means everyone that wants to raid HAS to join their guild.
---
RIP my sweet RP realm.
---
Is sword specialisation not worth speccing? None of the rogue leveling guides  seems to have it.
---
A rivalry sure. But at a time of relative peace lorewise. As Thrall himself says when you start the Onyxia quest line. Still it makes sense that some skirmishes and fights break out naturally.
---
*Laughs In AOE*

Make love, not Warcraft. That made my day for real

It's generally acknowledged that you can "see" the contours of the band of stars that we're in, depending on where you are.

How long is the cooldown?
---
I hate horde, but I hate gnomes even more. Good job, horde scum. Youre one of the good ones
---
Is there an addon for tracking people who have ganked you so that in the future you can get revenge?
---
no zeppelin nearby though :/
---
Can also do 4 mage and priest
---
Mages can’t dispel in vanilla. Spell steal wasn’t introduced until TBC
---
Also wet.
---
That's incredibly dark. I love it.
---
Are RP'rs the only people who post on reddit?
---
I have not laughed that hard at a video from a game in a very long time.  For once I'm slightly disappointed I'm not alliance.
---
I bet there is. Burnouts are always eager to sink their energy into drama.
---
No shit? Is this for real?
---
What's the addon called that makes the nameplates the class color?
---
You clearly just have a shitty sense of humour :)
---
Don't stand there. I gotta run through to go to sm
---
The green stuff is supposed to be blood?
---
Good
---
Doesn't take into account that higher level quests give more xp and you got mount. You can't just look at total xp LOL
---
Heck yeah! That guy killed me in Stonetalon today not an hour an a half ago! Probably mad that he got drowned lol.
---
You dont care about your pet's health? Someone call PETA

Fuck the wailing caverns. I have PTSD because of it...

Love your art though OP!

They can. It only works for some debuffs though.
---
Hoping to sell it this week.
---
I don't see what the issue is.  Noone is forcing the guy to stream and stream sniping is not against TOS.
---
Pandaria is surrounded by Mist, nobody can find it except the giant Turtle with playable pandas.
---
The Broken Isles are basically that, a crappy bunch of islands housing a city that thinks the outside world is destroyed and doesn't lower it's barriers, some small primitive Tauren tribes, angry primitive Vrykrul, marshes and ruins, and the tomb of sargeras + broken shore that were thought destroyed (actually just sunk). No reason to go there, until the Legion fucked it all up.
---
Kul'tiras are not part of the Alliance and have cut ties with the mainland, and also dislike the horde obviously, so they just sit tight not allowing many people in.
---
Zandalar is full of evil Trolls with one of the fiercest naval forces in the world, so they are avoided.
---
Combined with the fact these landmasses are far smaller than the world map shows, there's just limited reasons to approach any of these islands. They are still there.
---
Lore-wise, kul tiras is already known(rexxar campaign takes place in there for certain chapters) and zuldazar wasnt known because it was hidden by magic or something.
---
It's not efficient at all. Healing every1 one by one means you'll be casting all time and interrupting your mana reg all the time.
---
By the time you get in front of the que you could have grinded 2 levels lol
---
The weirdest part about Badlands is how important it is to Dwarf lore, at least Ulda, and there's no town there. You have to walk down from Loch and there's like 5 quests spread out all over the zone. And then you see Horde with a full on town in the zone lol.
---
I wasn't pretending, I thought u were talking about the other screenshot...
---
anyway refer back to
---
&gt; this a screenshot of him standing in that spot over bodies, not a screenshot of him fighting from that position, which he denies ever doing.
---
cuz I don't see how that argues against the point at all
---
What server? Feels like it’s happening to Stalagg also
---
Priest, but rolling one just for that reason seems like a really bad idea
---
I always assumed it was Chinese living in the US that prefer to use their native language. Unfortunately I don’t think you can get around the ping issue

The guy said he wanted to make sure it's not an AOE-farming group. He didn't say the casters weren't allowed to AOE at all.
---
That chat message though
---
You are not obligated to play the game with anyone that ruins your enjoyment of it.
---
Nah dog, it’s all about those faux Latin names.
---
But really, who cares if you’re having fun with it? Back in BC I was in a guild called &lt;Fat Kids Lag In Real Life&gt;, which I, a fat kid, thought was hilarious.
---
Sounds like they were all in Discord together. I feel like this kinda stuff tends to happen when its 4 people in dicord and one random player.
---
What is this, a screenshot for ants?
---
During leveling, generally there are better uses for the talent points, especially if you get a really nice weapon that isn't a sword.
---
It really shines at 60 when you're doing bosses that live longer and gives chances for it to proc.
---
Thanks for all the responses. I see a fair few regarding the UI, it's not usually that zoomed in, I just did it for the last 5 or so mobs till ding, though still probably more clustered than most but works for me. I see people asking why everything is so big and the simple answer is have beyond poor vision so any smaller and I need to lean in and focus a lot harder than glancing and getting info when required. UI without bags open  [https://imgur.com/a/9sdCjTJ](https://imgur.com/a/9sdCjTJ). Same with chat box, with such a large font I only see a few posts so this allows me to see a lot more. Anyway off to AoE farm I go :)
---
Seems not. Couldn’t find any complain topics or links to “uncensored version”.
---
Your post feels like by a cupcake that can't tell a difference between pvp in game and real life.
---
Yeah, does highly depend on demon out versus the class your fighting.
---
Yeah. I did a double take on my way to the auction house when I saw it.  Just stood there staring at it for a minute before chasing after the Warlock trying to get a screenshot.
---
Live to win by Paul Stanley on an endless loop.

yup creepy as shit

WOW LEVEL 59 PURPLE WORSE THEN LEVEL 63 BLUE HOLY SHIT THANKS FOR THE INCITE
---
People love to throw around that bullshit term now. Blacklisted... lol. You.have to really gain a real reputation to actually get blacklisted. And if these guys are blacklisting you from thier guild... seems like a positive outcome for you. Never have to deal with them again.
---
That sounds amazing. Thank you!
---
That default Sexymap border.
---
&gt;aoe farming as a tank
---
There's plenty better ways to make money
---
No, he's right. I skipped MoP and thought the expansion was a mistake. Then one day when leveling an alt I gave it a shot.. loved the zones and the lore. 
---
I regret missing out on it and many people even in my classic guild feel the same way. Also Monk is now my main on retail after not bothering to even try it for years.
---
I love it.

Fuck gnomes.

Is this a troll post?

Horde Scum! You will pay!
---
Same for me today but in Undercity.
---
It literally is a chunk of Winterspring pasted outside Naxx.
---
I was going to say farming runecloth is a legit strategy to get 1000g for epic mount, and then I noticed you were an orc.
---
I love how glowy and fiery fires look on Classic.
---
On retail, fires don't really glow like this and nothing really stands out, apart from the over-done, glorified Azerite necklace effects.
---
Guess I better answer every single person or the tin foil hat-wearing ex-hall monitors will report me.
---
Sounds like every single 60 horde I’ve seen on that server. They perma camp everything.
---
What genre?
---
Trying to see the tanks POV. I still have ravager in my bag at 47 and use it on cleave dungeons. Since then I've gotten several upgrades that I've needed on and use while soloing.
---
[https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Bonebiter](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Bonebiter) The weapon and stats!

Yes and you then you take the boat from "harbor"
---
Orc blood, but don't tell the orcs.
---
Which armor pieces are those?
---
You say that like this isn't EDM.
---
But yeah I think he wanted something more specific
---
If it’s a guild run then obviously it would go to him, if you’re just pugging it well you gotta compete with everyone else who’s bis it is
---
I have the shitty vision too so I'm right there with you man. I'd suggest for a UI, keep testing things. I've literally got hours upon hours of /played time on alts and my main because I've been testing out different UIs. Some I liked the features but overall were just too terrible, and some I enjoyed the overall experience but minor details bugged the hell out of my anxiety.
---
You’re a complete tool. Not only for being horde but for taking all that gear from other people just to delete it.
---
Shame!
---
I just sit and drink and say Pull when im drinking, it's like yelling GET to a dog they always charge in :D
---
Elemental mage is just basically a hybrid frost and fire spec, uses the slows, ice block, and utility from frost but the big damage from fire
---
Gruesome experimentation on human civilians that we keep in barebone cages? We got that! Come and see Undercity!
---
We even got a tauren lady overseeing the whole thing without batting an eye, which has always struck me as really really stupid.
---
the first cleave teams did that but it quickly just became an insult to say the comp was low skilled/zerg group.
---
Actual tactics... do explain.
---
forgot to mention that Alliance only correct
---
!remindme 18 hours
---
I mean it sounds like something they wouldn't allow
---
Heh, GLAD I COULD HELP
---
I’ll let you know once you inbox where it is lol
---
If Gnomes are not there to be murdered, then why be there Gnomes?
---
&gt; What next? Do we wait for 1 minute before hitting on bosses and 30 seconds on each pull?
---
Ok well this does confirm you actually have no idea what you're doing. Yes you absolutely wait to start DPSing until the tank has aggro. The tank is supposed to hold aggro, but he has to build it, he doesn't have a magic aggro button that he presses everytime he sees a mob.
---
This isn't retail
---
Need to sit on a Dwarf's shoulders!

Hes right though, sooooo many posts that just links to some kind of crap video with asmon

I got killed by a warrior AT The same level as me once and I died unbelievabily fast. In The combat log it showed i took severe hits from arcane blast, however there was NO mage in sight and it even stated that The warrior dealt The arcane blast damage, really confusing. Layering glitch perhaps?
---
Thanks for the input!

Same

PvPs in classic are very rock paper scissors, so it's really hard to give a "best" because different classes counter different opponents. With that in mind, here's a super quick rundown:
---
- Hunters are wPvP gods, but notoriously hard to play properly. A good hunter doesn't have many wPvP counters, but a bad one will have a terrible time. If you're willing to put the time into thoroughly learning every nuance and mechanic, hunter is probably the best in the game if we're talking strictly wPvP.  
---
- Mages are very good and very versatile. Great damage, good slows, good cc, polymorph is fucking ridiculous and blink is a godsend with it's ability to get you out of a stun. They shred melees and don't have anything that really hard counters them. Even the bad matchups feel playable. Main issue is that you actually have quite a few bad 1v1 matchups for a class that's still considered so good at PvP. Ele/resto shaman, shadow priest, warlock, hunter and druid are all favored vs you in strict 1v1s. That said, a fully fair 1v1 never really happens in wPvP. Most of the time one player is catching out another, and in this case mages are extremely strong with how many slows and ccs they bring.
---
- Warlock is fantastic in 1v1 duels. It's comfortably one of the best 1v1 classes in WoW, second only to shadow priest. Worst matchups are hunter and rogue; everything else I'd say you're favored vs, and even rogue is very beatable with engineering and good gear. Biggest problem is your lack of mobility or escape. choosing good engagements and avoiding bad ones is a crucial part of wPvP, and something warlock sucks at doing. To me that prevents warlock from truly being considered a top tier wPvPer, even if his actual 1v1 fighting ability is insane.
---
- Shadow priest is by far the best class in the game at 1v1 duels. Literally the only thing favored vs you is ele / resto shaman. Problems are the exact same as warlock. No mobility or escape, so no luxury of being able to choose your fights or escape bad situations. Also shadow priest isn't that good at group content, so unless you're williing to respec you're going to have a bad time getting invited to high level groups
---
+1 want to know
---
Name checks out
---
Very well might not be nearly as viable.
---
A new low pop server is probably going to have way more casuals who won't care to pay 300-400g for 2 preBiS pieces and will instead opt for cheaper alternatives by just running some dungeons.
---
 [https://imgur.com/0VwtdEe](https://imgur.com/0VwtdEe)  I'm talking about this right here,where you can see the bodies in the bottom right corner right next to the roof exploit, there is literally a PILE of bones there... How can you miss that?
---
11/10
---
The only time I am using flash heal is in extended fights where the group is out of mana.
---
A lesser heal is about 95 mana and a greater heal (heal) is about 140ish, a flash heal is around 125 and is between both on healing power.
---
What that means in English is for an extra regen tick you heal more then a lesser heal so if timed right you can keep flash healing the same as a paladin, the downside is that you are going to pull a lot of threat, really quickly and don't wear heavy armor.
---
You will be able to keep healing but mana management, threat control, personal risk assessment and finally when can you throw in other spell judgment calls are going to escalate very quickly.
---
A good way to keep this manageable is to save it for 10 - 25% hp allies / dire situations.
---
-cheers
---
At least he’s an attention seeking tool. 
---
God forbid none of us knew he deleted his character due to the lack of self control
---
I hate alliance hinterlands. You get to this really big dwarven settlement that is wildhammer keep and most of the buildings are just empty with some having npcs in there that won't even talk to you. It's just useless. I wanna be buddies with the gryphon tamers and help them gather meat or something. But no, there are like 5 quests in total and that's it.
---
Did they patch that at some point? I had two characters at rank 11+ back then and I remember riding the raptor with my tauren shaman and kodo/raptor with my undead rogue..
---
Hmm. I know layering has done some weird stuff. My friend was taking a bunch of damage out of nowhere while we going somewhere on mount, nothing showed on the combat log. Tried tab targeting and couldn't lock onto anything. 
---
We just assumed it was something like player changing layers attacked (based on literally nothing but our guesses )
---
Pandaria was behind mists, the other I Don’t know
---
Well, it’s a good enough talent that you should take it, but it’s isn’t essential if everyone moves on time.
---
Wow, thank you so much! Very helpful
---
Love it, making me wanting to level my hunter more, especially because I feel like this trick will work less post phase 1 because they would have likely not fallen for it as easily. They might have seen that there was no  + honor from killing you in phase 2+ and come back and finished you off.
---
The princess is in another mountain.
---
&gt;those are bodies, not people he's fighting.
---
Really? The guy admits to camping there for an hour and that's the hair you try to split???
---
It is 20 runecloth per 50 rep, so if you are 0/3000 Neutral, it will take 60 (thru Neutral)+ 120 (Friendly) + 240 (Honored) + 420 (Revered) stacks.
---
It took me roughly 650 stacks as a Gnome who only quested in Darkshore to get Exalted with Darnassus.
---

This is the spec in question.

He must've thrown a flash bomb to fear pet. These can be bought on the AH and are usable for non-engineers. Crafted with engineering tho.

Frost is also awesome in that pretty much every talent is worth getting. Hard to go wrong with frost
---
Jesus christ, I'm disturbed and aroused at the same time
---
Well, either it's a Fury Warr, in which case it is just as much pre-raid BiS as it is for a Rogue, or it's a Prot Warr, in which case... it's also at least just as much pre-raid BiS as it is for a Rogue. What do?
---
I also feel like if they even minded being killed they'd say something instead of just typing up all that jibrish in /say and /shout.
---
Naxx?
---
&gt; What the "cool kids" call AoE groups
---
It's a term for a PvP comp that's been around since Wrath. Where you been my dude?
---
I meant blackrock mountain, but obviously there are way more places that are amazing for world pvp. 
---
PvE in classic is not really challenging enough for me to see anyone who has played the game before be entertained by it solely
---
at best a temp ban, probably a GM warning
---
Do you prefer EU or NA?
---
I play from Thailand on us servers and my ping is perfect. Not once has it been an issue. I’ve even played off of mobile data. Just depends on your provider I guess. My bnet was created in the us, I’m sure they have an faq on how to change it.
---
Gotta say he looks like a warlock... They have underwater breathing .... How did he die
---
Look at the username. Red pill and 88. It's a troll.
---
This is the game telling you to go prot 😂 Gz on both man! Skullflame is like a 100g epic right? Also Pre raid BIS for prot paladins
---
There may be no single right one but there are multiple wrong ones. Rogues pulling while the whole group does a mana break is one of them.
---
What inventory addon is that?
---
When you get 8/8 T2.
---
Wow my server actually gets posted about and i happen to be away for the weekend! As alliance this feels like seeing your house has been broken in to on the news!
---
I'm sure i would have made a massive difference being there as a mighty level 24....
---
It was just used as a term for teams that zerged you down with pure pressure and damage with melees.
---
It just always had a warrior in it, hence the name.
---
Rogue warrior druid was a melee cleave comp in tbc and it didnt do too much cleaving.
---
Thats just what it was called.
---
&gt;On the horde side we just write a macro for tab+attack and spam that
---
/target [mob name]
---
/startattack
---
the coast too. most mobs drop shells.
---
It's not that he left, it's how. I would like to still be staring at his lifeless body obviously
---
And it's your cake day!!
---
welcome to classic
---
He's saying they aren't subject to glancing blows. Which is a hit on a mob that does significantly reduced damage. If you're on a melee character and attack something 4-5 levels higher than you and see you are hitting for like 10 damage instead of 100. That's not armor, that's your blows glancing off them.
---
STV is mob dense.
---
Does the Horde have this with TB and ORG?  That is an unusually cheap flight, I imagine it might be the same.
---
Hey guys, Hobbs here.
---
I love Westfall. Reminds me of autumn for some reason
---
Yeah.. the quest where you poison a Tauren girl definitely shocked me. I didn't even know the quest existed.
---
Wands are not part of your weapons so you need either a main hand with an offhand or a staff, the wand is equipped to the right of the offhand.
---
You may have responsibility in real life... but you have a duty to azeroth.
---
He's a troll, this shield is good
---
It's possible that he accepted the invite while dead and it changed layers when he popped up, which would be why my swp did not affect him.
---
Not to scale.
---
Surely that's just an artistic representation and not actually a map that anyone would use for anything
---
The question was literally "Will there be a keyring in classic"
---
I was hoping you were going to end it with being mauled to death by plague bears.
---
Watch it, that's all I'm going to say.
---
&gt;The guy refuses to bring certain classes. 
---
Literally every aoe farm group does this too. I'm more surprised people aren't more triggered by that than this.
---
There's a world pvp addon to keep track of enemy players you have encountered and let you know when they are nearby. Sorry, forgot the name.
---
This confuses me lol Im sorry. So, I have to get a "mainhand" in order to hold something with my offhand?
---
Fury Warriors roll on a lot of DPS gear that isn’t plate
---
It’s almost a mandatory thing to do, you want to have Q and E free for abilities. Turn with the mouse
---
I linked wow through steam on my pc and downloaded steam link on my mobile.
---
Do these posts with name and server for people to ignore this scum.
---
The last few words of that are hilarious in a diff context LOL
---
If you're a mage and they were flagged, your AoE may have hit them which caused you to flag into PVP.
---
Tried to google resistance and got this https://classic-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Resistance.  
---
Doesn’t look easy, I think at lvl 60, every 50 resist gives a 15% chance to resist a spell (eg fear). If the spell deals dmg,  resistance will give a chance to (partially) reduce dmg. There is a chart that shows how much.
---
Im just telling you the origins of the word.
---
It came from melee cleaves which often just did incidental cleave dmg, but usually just mowed someome down from pressure.
---
Then came the popularity of double caster comps in wrath, and people started calling them wizard cleaves, caster cleaves and spellcleaves.
---
"Cleave" just became synonymus with stacking the same type of classes together.
---
Spellcleaves were usually about cc and burst not cleaving.
---
Gnomes are the scum of the earth. Sorry if you rolled one. You should re roll.
---
Burn In hell you fuckwit
---
Serves you well for helping out horde
---
You can basically just /target the rarespawns. No need to do crazy stuff like this.
---
Dps pulling long backs are my noes

I was trying to remember the famous mage from way back when but couldn't remember his name the past few weeks. Thanks for that flashback.
---
Or locks just asking for heal when they spirit tap , while healer is drinking. If healer can drink, so can you.
---
You can only get sulfuron ingots from golemagg, what else would he claim they layer exploited
---
I love my auctionator, don’t get me wrong. But I normally do a full scan before I sell stuff, and when I try to sell individual items (take thick leather for example), it has to scan the pages of thick leather again before I can sell. This often takes just as long as a full auction house scan. Is there any way to fix this or make it faster? It’s a serious pain.
---
whatever. keep wasting your life on shit tier tanks.
---
I hope you are not part of the problem. You are not denying rage from tank when they need it the most(on pull) by throwing PWS on them, do you?
---
Amen!
---
The add on is called "Spy"
---
He might have used a health potion or healthstone
---
Bear grylls would be proud
---
But then I have to play a Human to be a warlock and play with friends. I can barely stand humans in real life, let alone my game.
---
I think its glorious having them all now relevant once again.
---
Zalgradis 3 
---
In retail they changed all the classes so much in such a short amount of time i did not even recognize them anymore.
---
What if I told you that Azeroth is real life because it’s played in real life. We’re real people in a real world playing a real game. Other real people play and need our help. 
---

Quest like this make you remember to chill and take your time.
---
This is not Retail.
---
I'd rather the stamina tbh... More valuable in open world, PvP and aoe farming,
---
*looks at WF totem, BL, and chain heal*
---
Oh sorry, you were saying something?
---
Buyers have a tendency to buy things on the front page and avoid the last page (if there are 10+ pages especially). Overload the first few pages with junk, and buyers will be too frustrated to move to the last page for the cheap items, is my guess
---
What you have to do as a healer is sit down and drink. 
---
Then stay there until you're actually needed. You can't panic because someone's in combat and you aren't doing anything, because that wipes you.
---
I feel like too many people over the years have taken *that* guy's side over the years, and they rarely ever realize they did anything wrong.
---
If the tank is over half and you stop drinking while in combat, what wiped you was having a twitchy priest, not your tank pulling too quickly.
---
These are the people you can't reason with in text chat. The ones who have no idea what they did and the favor of the party.
---
Ruthless. I like it. Red is dead. This is war, you pansies.
---
Some people get really upset if you don't rp in /say. But usually it's not a big deal. You don't have to roleplay if you dont want to.
---
Selfish people with anonymity they can hide behind. I know it’s just a game, but it’s still disappointing that people are willing to cheat and lie over it.
---
Is way different than the first season. Took my 3 tries to finally sit down and watch season 2 but I loved it in the end. I honestly don’t know how the 3rd season will be but it’s definitely worth it to watch all of it. One of my favorite shows in the last 5 years.
---
As it always should of been.
---
I pray blizzard doesnt destroy it once again.
---
lol, what a casual
---
Thanks I'll look into it
---
also some people never grow up and unlearn their childish tendencies.
---
you can get spirit tap by killing the mob, after it kills the person
---
Why fly at all when you can run for free
---
I like Thunderbluff, but I don't enjoy how it's all spread out over three levels (and then the separate rises for classes and such). The tightly packed place is nice, but what I've always found strangely warming are the players fishing in the little pond just as you take the elevator up.

No you do not. But an off-hand by itself do not offer a lot of stats which is why you'd want to pair it with a mainhand weapon.
---
You have your two hands and a ranged weapon. 
---
Like a hunter can have a 2h sword and a bow. 
---
You can have a staff and pull out the wand still.
---
Well last 5 levels can and should be spent doing brd runs. Good group can outperform quests and zero tanks happen. Plus you get pre his gear.
---
Gold is a huge upgrade early on. More so than a piece of equipment. Everyone should be needing on BoE. It's an "upgrade" to your professions. They should be viewed as a big bag of gold not an actual item. You don't need them while leveling.
---
Somewhat untrue of classic. In classic you are all that's left because all the true heroes are out fighting the war.
---
&gt; I’d say at least a full pre BiS to do on your healer and tank
---
this is total overkill you can literally do it in greens if you dont suck
---
The ideal team is 3 frost mages, 1 warlock, and a priest. The warlock uses eye of kilrogg to pull mobs (the priest puts a shield on the eye).  
---
then the mages take turns using frost nova to root the mobs (so no one gets touched)  
---
All the dps aoe the rooted mobs. By the time everything is dead, everyone is usually out of mana so the warlock needs to pull lots of enemies at once to make it efficient.
---
I think he meant Antarctic tactics
---
If you didn't want to be ganked roll on a pve server or STFU.
---
I don't bitch when some rogue stun locks me. I get even beat their ass.
---
Sometimes you roll the dice and you win and some times ya lose.
---
If youbdidbread something then you would see that blizz is axtively working in fixing all of the hunter bugs and they already improved fd +freezetrap combo. They are still working on the fact that your pet pulses you back in conbat the moment u use fd. But overall im happy that player with your attitutde cancelled their sub
---
Serious answer: i saw a chinese twitch stream where the abominations had the normal models, with guts spilling out everywhere etc. So maybe they have the normal version?
---
Notable guild names I’ve seen on my server:
---
&lt;K Redacted K&gt; (I reported this one because... well it felt like it shouldn’t really be allowed)
---
&lt;General Supplies&gt;
---
&lt;Booty&gt; (actually the top raiding guild here)
---
&lt;We Thought We Did&gt;
---
&lt;15 Year Coma&gt;
---
&lt;You Think You Do&gt;
---
And then there’s all the various forms of “Make Azeroth Great Again” and such
---
Why run for free when you can swim for hours
---
Kultiras and zandalar are known actually,  just never went there until now. There are kultiran and zandalari in classic!
---
It's fun going back with current lore/ game knowledge and trying to see shit that was mentioned.  My friends said there's a quest that mentions azerite but it's obviously not the azerite we know, but i gotta fact check that
---
This advice is fine if your tank or whoever is pulling one pack at a time and is specced properly or at least trying to tank, otherwise 10% not gonna cut it
---
Did it at level 30. Warrior is all about teamwork, so I believe if you have friends ready to spend 2-3 hours to help you, than you are a good warrior.
---
Some pack of mobs are pretty much identical, like in Gnomeregan. So as a tank I measure our dps ability to clear it. If dps is taking too much aggro, AoE everything making it hard for me to maintain threat and for healer constantly healing em I always wait for healers full mana. Also I am only using marks in 3+ mobs situation, so if dps assist on my target I know healer will have time to drink to full even when combat had started, without need to heal overzealous squishy dps.
---
Well the Horde quests rather than having a big overarching conspiracy in the background has a theme of living in a hostile where something always wants to kill you no matter what the zone is. Either old enemies, rising evil, Alliance, or just the local wildlife, you always have to fight to live.
---
You can tank well every dungeon. So you are fine up to 60+ shit.  Once you are 60 you can farm holy and switch to holy becoming insane healer.
---
You get tame pet q and only after that you can get the revive pet quest
---
Is it just zone dependent instead of starting at 10? I've only ever played on PvP servers and I've never seen a higher level player that could attack me first if I'm under level 10.
---
He said, in modern English, without a shred of self-awareness.
---
Totalt true, im not saying it's the worst. I'm just saying it's not going to be the top 2 dps class when you have the same gear at 60. I still want every class to be able to play as it would be more fun. :)
---
Hey these schekles don’t come easy. That being said I have a few lvl 10s 5 gold today and it made my day almost as much as it made theirs
---
Oh my God, just look at all this beautiful....emptiness. With its....grass, and its.....um.....tree (singular)?
---
Is there an addon that shows me how much longer my debuffs/effects are on a target? I think I once had one that either showed a number ticking down, or a golden border around the icon that got shorter and shorter over time. My searches have only given me results about casting bars, which I don't care about-
---
This bow eats arrows like crazy. Also Hunters usually want high damage range rangeds for those juicy aimed crits. Cg tho.. I'm sure you'll find  some memer that would want to buy it.
---
YOU MADMAN! Their reproduction rate is so high they would overrun the planet as a big furry tide without the non-stop culling of their numbers!!!
---
I think I saw your gauntlets for sale on the AH
---
*is a mountain
---
I don't know whether it's an exploit, it was posted in the macro section of the Shaman Discord, I don't know how it works just that it does, I have been using it myself no issue.
---
I think 1-2g but I always mix up the various pearls
---
Can't choose between Verant Keeper's Aim, Megashot Rifle and Guttbuster! Which one is better?
---
Man, at lower levels water is a huge expense especially if you are only getting benefit from like half of it.
---
Playing from the top of Dreadmist Peak
---
Wands have their own slot.  In addition to the wand slot you can use one of the following: staff OR main hand and off hand.  If you want to use your offhand you need a sword or dagger to go in your main hand in addition to the wand.
---
There are rules against just sharing anything though. Ah well, what a sub.
---
Should be zone dependent, i could be wrong, but ive also never taken my less than level 10 self into contested areas always been 10+before making the run from darn to if/sw or opposite. And horde side i dint think ive been under 15 before a contested zone.
---
Yeah this is 2005 ui taking up 90% of the screen type of shit
---
Uhh how many 5-10 man raids are there???
---
Okay
---
If you want to play on a PvP server, you have to reroll.  Players on PvE realms cannot transfer to PvP servers.  You would only be eligible to transfer to a different PvE server.
---
I mean wf versus clothies did they even have a chance to begin with‽ Hahaha 
---
Lok'tar ogar paladin.
---
People joke that all the Blizzard staff play frost mage so its OP and never gets nerfed. My personal favorite class in not only WoW but basically any game that i can play a frost mage.
---
I think his point is skipping all the clearing to quick check for that rare you're farming. I only see this as a good solution if you're hunting for a specific drop on one of those bois, otherwise you're better off just clearing for easy money. Unless /target for some reason works at the beginning of the instance that far away
---
Yes. I hope they have ragnail and then eat a bag of ready salted crisps
---
We’ve always known they were there, the only place that doesn’t have numerous lore references to it in Vanilla and the Warcraft games is maybe Pandaria. They just weren’t added to the map until they were placed you could visit.
---
Probably /curious while targeting someone.
---
I didn’t say raids?
---
Is this one of those weird anti videogame ads? Instead of GTA causes violence its WoW breaks your dick?
---
You can level as pure Retribution and heal in dungeons until Sunken Temple, where it starts to get trickier. Make sure to keep any intellect gear you come across (doesn't matter which armor type it is).
---
I’ve found all types. Some ppl only want spellcleave, other refuse it. And then there’s the folks who don’t care, they just want to group up and kick some elite butt
---
We put the *caring* back in Apolocaring ~
---
You're telling me more people play gnomes than dwarves? How is that possible
---
Livin' the dream. :D But yeah, I wouldn't want to drop "hey, I'm going to take stupid risks and lose health like a DPS!" on a PUG healer. They're usually amazing and don't deserve that.
---
A lot of the times on big pulls I’ll just target the highest health mob and put the pet on it with auto growl. Takes some heat off the tank
---
I actually don't mind this at all. We're all different.
---
I've only done one ZF run using this composition, but I recall the strategic components being: what to pull, how to pull it, and where to choke point the mobs to minimize risk.
---
We were able to get to the graveyard area of ZF in 3 pulls, then we cleared the graves in 3 pulls, and mounted up to reset and repeat.
---
But I did, and you replied to me. So..
---
I would think anywhere from 25-60g sounds historically accurate.
---
enjoy your repair bill
---
Dunno about the last few nights as I haven't been able to play. Before that though, those zones were a pain in the ass to level in. Especially Badlands with that rock quest so close to the horde town.
---
Reserving shit was in the game always. The only real solution to it is being a tank or healer and just shitting on such groups.
---
dont like it, dont roll on a pvp server
---
It won't, it's so raw and untainted by today's standards if that makes sense 
---
Compare it to the Hobbit (which I can't stand to rewatch) the difference is night and day 
---
Lord of the rings is high fantasy, with acting, animation and a fleshed out world which put modern films to shame 
---
Hobbit is an action adventure film ruined by too much cgi and behind the scenes magic to the point where the film has lost its beauty, most of the scenes were shot in front of green screens. It completely takes away from the film.
---
Everything is going too Hollywood for me, there's very few genres left which are still honest and true to what films should be.
---
2 gold you say?
---
It's taken from a streamer called Naowh, almost identical
---
no need to roll on a pvp server either
---
Someone's jelly
---
Works as rogue's energy. With a bit slower regen timer.
---
You dot shit and fear them... The least honorable  way to defeat your opponent.
---
"best" is hard to say. What do you wanna do? Make the most money possible or make some gear for yourself to use? Are you going to buy mats or farm yourself etc etc
---
If you want to raid, find a guild. Don’t pug lul
---
Sure, but even looking at "serious" maps from the time period,some are so distorted that even with a modern map of the same area set beside it, you'd have to squint to see the similarities.  For example, this map of [Italy and Sicily](https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/peutinger-table-map-Rome2sicily.jpg) from the 13th century.
---
Somebody tell me if I'm wrong but I'm 80% sure that weapon isn't a big one for twinks, so it's not going to see an exponential explosion of value in the next phases when BGs come out and people have money to fund alts. That said, it hasn't even been a month yet and the economies are still taking shape as most people continue to level.
---
Have you checked the AH on your server for a price on it?
---
Because breaking /who is less intrusive on a lot of other legitimate addons, such as boss mods that whisper someone(haven’t seen any that do since wotlk though) or ones that send message to someone you buff(think innervate)
---
Uh, how manic do you think I am about "accusing" others of pedantry if you think it'll somehow impact my life as a whole?
---
Get some perspective man, based on this and your previous post you could seriously use it.
---
No Classic +. This is the same modern Blizzard that fucked up wow, they haven't gone back in time or anything.
---
I put armor upgrades on my spellbars. I think I was level 8 or so before I found out how to equip armor properly.
---
Bind it to the mouse wheel and you are good to go
---
That's what I was thinking. Preempt it
---
Had something similiar like this happen, except it was the Evocator's Blade from BFD, not that good of a BoE but we called them out on it since they had a much better weapon with the staff from Deadmines.
---
They needed on everything they could "use" even if they didn't need it.
---
:'c
---
I am a leveling warrior, and you don’t need em lmao. Just stick to one set and you’ll be perfectly fine. Carry around an old shield to use shield wall etc. Don’t piss off the group for it.
---
If the mines detonate, your group is done.  
---
Options are:  
---
Use crowd control (mages can turn a guy into a sheep)  
---
Kill the mines (melee dps work best but all dps should be aware of them, I think a message saying the agent has planted a mine pops up)  
---
When the mine drops, have everyone (including tank a mobs) back towards a safe area so the mine hits no one.   
---
Good luck, this dungeon brings more nighthmares than playing monopoly and expecting people to play nicely.
---
3v1, classic horde right here
---
No you need to level your professions. You don't need an item you will replace in 4 levels. Need is subjective, not just more stats. You should always roll need so you don't get ninjad. If everyone rolls need than their is no difference except it can't be stolen by one player. If someone really needs it for BiS later in the game that is different. But from 1 - 52 everyone should be rolling need. No need to downvote just because you disagree.
---
Dude this guy was 1 of 2 gms in a guild I was in and left
---
Cause half of our fellow horde are wallowing in the meme echo chamber the barrens has become arguing with each other.
---
Song? I always forget this.
---
But there are no hunters here...
---
On the other hand if you get good mages it can be real fast.
---
Did a Stratholme living once where the mages told me "get multiple packs, but just tank the ranged mobs, well take care of the rest" 
---
Man it was smooth.
---
God, that fucking thing.
---
-- an orc's opinion.
---
I can’t believe in a fantasy game people actually reported this post 😂
---
2h tank everything!

Right through! TC and shouts are your friend!

It makes life hard for your healer. Just go buy a cheap sword and board. Will make life a lot easier

Pretty sure Aimed Shot is normalised in classic so weapon speed doesn't matter for the numbers. Slower weapons work better with the pve rotation, but this is godly in 49 twink pvp. It is also BiS for Viscidus in AQ.
---
Art team good, upvotes to the left.
---
Ok but that's not what the tank post or the healer post were talking about. I'm not trying to say every player is a special snowflake. Some players do bad things. That's just not what this is about.
---
This is the guy that was kicked from Olympus 4 for ninja from a dude from Olympus 3? Or something?
---
Untill around level 55, both tank and a healer will be most likely in their DPS spec, and what makes them tank and healer is their gear. So put on your int dress, grab a +healing mace and you are good to go.
---
.... I did that just last night, why can't it happen in PvE servers? Just because I can't attack you doesn't mean I can't sit there watching you die /cheer ing the mob and /clap ing you, but instead I helped kill the elite and we both continued on our way.
---
Earthmother guide you, friend :)

Heartseeker is dope. We need more horde! Alliance definitely outnumber us here.

just like 90% of the complaints from boomers here

It's also name catacombs in France

Took a year t level a warrior to 60. Didn’t know first aid was a thing
---
It's true.  Even undead have different models that don't show bones.  One of the devs on the countdown to classic podcast mentioned it.
---
Unless they're undead mages
---
Hell, you seen out in front of org? Got a bunch of our own guys just beating on each other night and day out there.
---
I would avoid respecting until 55+. I always found that levelling as a heal spec for even one day to be unbearable.   
---
You can play it by ear, keep running dungeons as shadow, and if you find healing too difficult/ impossible, you’ll know to respec.
---
Darkshore is the fastest zone to like 18. It goes by super quick and the quests are all packed together.
---
Meanwhile I'm leveling blacksmithing turning 50g into 1g
---
Pandaria and maybe Zandalar were hidden by magic. Kul'Tiras, Broken Isles, and Northrend were already known about and mentioned before.
---
They weren't on the travel map because they weren't travel destinations for anyone on the mainlands. You either weren't welcome to travel there (Kul'Tiras, Zandalar), had no reason to travel there (Broken Isles), or you wanted to stay the hell away (Northrend).
---
What add on shows class icons in chat?
---
I made a NE Druid on a friends account just to try out WoW, liked it, then went and bought the game.  For my first character though, I settled on a Human Warlock.  I noticed this spell in the general tab of my spellbook that the Druid didn’t have, called Perception.  I read the tooltip and figured humans must NEED this spell because they have a lot of stealth enemies in their areas.  I became somewhat paranoid about it and spent the first 8 levels or so spamming it whenever it was off cool down.  Finally, having not found a single stealthy mob, I gave up, lol!
---
You playing a warlock is ultra cringe.
---
I was in a group yesterday (as DPS) that wiped six times in RFC. Everyone was of level, had the sort of gear you should expect going into RFC, and pretty much knew what they were doing - except the rogue who kept ninja pulling and got his ass kicked.
---
Finished the instance with a tank and healer and two hunters. There was marking and offtanking and honestly it was everything I wanted out of classic. People massively underestimate those later trash packs in RFC, they've strained every single group I've taken in there, bar none.
---
TSA makes wands do more damage.
---
Horde scum
---
Phase 2 is when all layering is removed. My only guess is that happens when all the hype starts to die down (another 2 months my guess)
---
And my playgroup has gotten exactly 0 purples and exactly 1 blue.   Just luck of the draw.
---
If your greater heal is 3 seconds by the time you're in ZF then you're specced wrong
---
T R I G G E R E D
---
The Link questline that starts in Ungoro.  And the entire instance of Uldaman.
---
How do you do that on a druid? Root them under water?
---
Beast lore is your bread and butter for this. Check petopia for what rank you can tame, head out without your pet and tame the pet with the required skill. Use it a few times and it will pop up in your chat bar that you've learner th skill. 
---
Abandon the skill giving pet and train yours.

Why the fuck do people keep parroting the bullshit "win at any cost" or "cheating culture" about China as if it is mainstream? Stop parroting shit you heard on Reddit.

Horde travel early on is easy as fuck. The only zone you actually gotta hoof it too is Hillsbrad and that’s still easy. TB sucks but is quick. Alliance has to haul ass through plenty of hostile zones just to get to certain instances. It’s a big pain in the ass. Horde doesn’t have as nice of capitals, but as far as questing/travel, they have it better by far.
---
That's some turbo selection bias right there. I've never seen a Lamborghini irl, Lamborghinis must not exist!

Nah, there are absolutely asshole DPS who will die over and over and just not care, or blame everyone else but them.

It works for ubrs at least.

when that 2h fury needed (and ofc won) the leather shoulders from RFD in front ofme, the druid tank... grrr. plot twist: he was in Herod shoulders :/

Nice

Just a guess, but depending on if the Warrior was Alliance and around level 30 using a two-hand- it could have been lucky procs from this:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=2000/archeus
---
Only thing I can think of that specifically would do arcane blast damage on a warrior, but there is probably something else.
---
Within 3 or 4 levels of me? I truly can't remember a time.

Tanks and healers are not the problem.
---
Dps are.

I was relatively quick to lvl 60 and had 300 skinning. Decided to give devilsaurs a shot.

Flew to un’goro, rose to a devilsaur and got it to 50% before a rogue ganked me and took the Dino. Noped our of the zone after 5 min.

Its an amazing feeling. I remember my first back in vanilla time. I was outside booty bay. On that beach. Probably questing. I was not yet level 60 but I can’t have been very far away. And this wonderful 1 handed sword dropped for me. I can’t remember it’s name. But I enquired a lot around and actually ended up selling it for quite a pretty penny. I remember selling it with trade and not using the AH. 
---
Second epic was the skullflame shield and that was so cool I ended up equipping it.

The epics after that is all a blur.....just like most girls after my two first;)

I didnt know that but can say this seems accurate, definitely seemed like different people piloting the same toon at times
---
i was a dwarf hunter named Snidely back then
---
Others said lvls, but no it doesn’t matter that you’re a warlock. Some healers can get into groups being under leveled a little.
---
It's going for 300g because it's a purple.

&gt;Can't get Deflector to drop

that's not how spell cleave works

Someones video game pals left him for WoW

i mean there's plenty of posts on twitter/reddit about it, some probability when some people have 4 of the same epics pre 60 huh.

Why do you have china town in us cities?

Oh god. The 20 minute run from SS to sm was so painful as alliance,

Those people who haven't played EverQuest will not understand the horrors of taking aggro off the tank.

Except that those globes were not made by the cosmic gods who can see entire planet in their palm
---
If you’re horde and don’t mind going underwater, there’s a repeatable quest to turn in fish at shadowprey village. I think it generates -10g/h but you’ll want to make sure you have a supply of underwater breathing pots.
---
I suppose the convenience of a non-commitment agreement is part of what your AH Fees buy you.
---
Most of the times a tank goes slow the real problems are the dps.
---
Rarely need on shields, will probably need on 1H and 2H dependong on group make-up. If people get pissed that others need on uogrades tp their primary gear in 5-mans - esp with no communications - then sorry, but that's on them.
---
If I'm in the group as DPS, tank says they really want a 1H or shield, sure, be my guest.
---
I hate the horde so much...so so much.

OmniCC + ClassicAuraDurations are the ones generally recommended in my experience

"Spite" should be larger.....

Reminds me of waiting outside Ramparts and jumping people to their doom, only you have to watch this guys air and heath depleat over 30 seconds(?) Or more.
---
That adds a certain discomfort for people to think about.
---
There are only 5 ranged weapons any hunter in the game (I'm talking entire game naxx inc) should be using. Carapace Spine xbow or AV bow(20% drop or quest), rhokdelar(50% drop), chromag xbow, kelthuzad xbow. If a hunter rolls on anything else theyre an idiot.
---
You mean the bots are real there too
---
This is so false, most purple world drops are shit and aren’t worth much more than their vendor price. Don’t stare yourself blind on the color if the item is useless.
---
I had to read that about 5 times before realising you meant you **gave** them 5 gold. I was just thinking how you had a few level 10s that acquired 5g on them and I'm not even at 5g on my level 26.
---
That's fine. As someone who dislikes idiots and often being an Officer in Guilds/Orgs I'd like you to screen those moments and just mention it to the leader/officer in the guild. Especially a 3-stack could potentially be a rl group that acts against the intentions of their guild. I had to yeet groups of people quite often. And most of the time, if one of them was completely fine and nice he/she is the one who stays.
---
Doesn't spy only work when someone is in visual range? Since /who doesn't tell you how close someone is, I doubt it would use /who, but I'm not sure.
---
now you can get spirit tap AND give someone the gift of repairs
---
Some auctions do have something similar if it doesn’t reach a certain minimum bid.
---
Yes, it costs mana to summon them, and yes, they use a global cooldown. 
---
The thing is, while you're leveling or soloing, you're generally not using all four totem slots in every single fight.
---
(All the below opinions are in regards to solo content, things change a lot in groups)
---
In low levels, searing totem can be really nice, but the damage drops off a lot in higher levels and you eventually phase it out of your rotation. This is the only totem that at any point entered my regular solo rotation.
---
Fire Nova totem is great in aoe situations, but you shouldn't be pulling multiple enemies with any kind of regularity, that's an emergency thing.
---
Grounding totem is nice for when an enemy is spellcasting and your interrupt is on cooldown, but that's a situational use, not a "drop this every fight" use.
---
The buffing totems like strength of earth and grace of air aren't worth the mana to drop in every fight, I'd only use those while going up against an elite or otherwise particularly difficult enemy.
---
The restorative totems Mana spring and healing stream aren't really worth your time solo. The amount of healing you get from healing stream is pitiful and Mana tide means you have to stay in one place for a good long while just to break even.
---
The cure poison and cure disease totems are situationally useful against enemies that poison or disease you a lot, and there are enemies that will do it multiple times in a fight. Otherwise it's better to just use the regular cure poison/cure disease spells.
---
If you're on a PVP server then you may get some use out of frost resist and fire resist totems against mages, but how often do you face an even-level enemy in a fair fight anyway, most world pvp you face while leveling is getting ganked anyway.
---
Any totems I didn't mention are of little to no use while leveling.
---
So, most totems are only situationally useful while levelling, only one ever achieved "drop this on every solo pull" status for me, and that tapered off at higher levels. You're not gonna be hitting four buttons to set up for every fight, if that's what you're concerned about.
---
Some shamans will set up their four totems in a safe spot where no enemies will pat and pull mobs to it, but I found this slower and more tedious than just going in with 0-1 totems in most fights.
---
group up guys. 2 player parties need double the amount of quest items, but at least triple their killspeed.
---
And oftentimes people stay in groups until everyone is done, which speeds it up dramatically towards the end because the one left who needs the quest can then loot every corpse for it.
---
What's with all the PVP realms!?
---
Get baron's mount
---
If somebody reading this has the digital edition of Vol. 3, they should be able to post the full resolution map; unfortunately I only have the physical version (and im not sure where it is).
---
[I did find this hi-res scan of a map from Vol. 1, though.](http://i.imgur.com/4oQoylR.jpg) Hope that helps.
---
"I'm new, I'm sick of all these groups having a go at me for needing in weapons, this has higher dps so it's an upgrade right?" (was faster and had lower base dmg tho)
---
I then also explained he should focus casters as I noticed he kept focusing on the melee, got a bit offended "since I don't know anything what do I do here?"
---
Ooooof I always make that mistake on my phone when sleeps. Thanks for pointing it out, fixed it
---
My GM back in the year (Vanilla) used to do this with a guildie and would tell me about it in BC. I totally forgot about that until now. Thanks for memories. I wish he still played (he may) but we didn't have or use FB back then and lost contact. Widestripe, (Garithos) if you read this, contact me! :-)
---
How ? I tried to find that option but via chat bubble settings i couldnt find it
---
what kind of weird resolution are you running
---
Or make the"block chat channel invite" a default on option. Which also completely stops it entirely, unless you opt into it for some reason.
---
Well, you do lose your deposit.  
---
What I wish is for them to set an (account wide) item limit, about 100 would be great.
---
There shouldn't be 15 pages of singles all at 1 copper bid xxx gold buyout.
---
Flight is 50c between the two.
---
What you are looking for is "Classic Aura Durations" it shows a grey layer on effects on targets that reduces clockwise to show the duration just like the global cooldown animation.
---
&gt;didn’t know
---
Oh, I bed he did
---
Very nice spreadsheet, will be using this, thanks.
---
Man, I'm loving the style of all of these. Thank you so much! I think I need to get those books.
---
I also recommend the twin colossals in Feralas  :D
---
You need to tame a pet with a damaging attack. Depending in your level you can catch different beasts. Try and get one with claw.
---
No pls don't
---
Blizzard said the amount of Layers is not set the same on all servers and going down constantly. No number possible no matter what the others coommented.
---
My eyes
---
I know this is off topic, but how do I add my horde flair to my name? I tried checking the sidebar and I can't figure it out.
---
I love that classic is bringing back cheesy video edits with cheesy music.
---
Imma do a proper PvP video like in ye olde days when I get to 60!
---
Also awesome job on the video, entertained myself quite a bit!
---
You're telling me that "exterminate all fauna in the Barrens" isn't a compelling narrative?
---
I think in lore they know they are there but they just give 0 fucks (they only didnt know of Pandaria)
---
It's possible it's not a default for classic, I'm using ElvUI but most chat Addons will have the same option I'd imagine. Usually just right click the header (general / combat) and go to settings from there and on the right there is usually a tick box for class colours in the chat channel.
---
Well it's inconvenient for the bidder as well. If you bid on mats, for example, you won't buyout other mats "just to be sure". So it's time consuming for me, as a costume... Oh... I see what you did there blizzard
---
I knew of the ones where we poison human captives, but not a fellow Horde member. Where is that one?
---
Yeah like lore-wise it makes zero sense at all. Badlands is firmly within Alliance territory but has no friendly town.
---
It’d be like Stonetalon Mountains having a good deal of Horde quests but no town, and you have to basically operate the zone from Crossroads. But Alliance randomly has a town there.
---
So the one that really wants to use it as an upgrade will never get it. Greed is not without reason the gold icon.
---
You sure? Rhonin's a chinese PVP realm.
---
No worries, I know it happens because I wrote "have" instead of "gave" myself when replying to you, ha!
---
Yeah sorry if i wasn't clearer,  i don't need a damage meter that shows healing done etc, i need the visual to show incoming healing on my healing frames.
---
I suggest reading this Shaman Tank guide https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=1150
---
Stay in dps spec, it isnt crucial to be in heal spec until over 50, i dont know untill which lvl you can succed, but friend lvl 32 paladin heals sm in retribution spec without problem
---
Depends. I don’t remember what the stats are for the leather shoulders in RFD, but agility is actually a really good stat for warriors. I was saying it was dumb of him to take away such a big upgrade for you when he has a very good upgrade just one dungeon later.
---
So is [this](https://i.imgur.com/EqEDYUG.png) what we're doing now? We delete our threads when they don't get traction and repost them over and over again?  
---
    
---
What was wrong with the other thread? Did you not get enough karma out of it, or were you hoping to go viral and become an internet sensation?
---
Same here I'm just confused.
---
It's comically bad advice. "You must first acquire your pre-raid BiS for Strath in order to acquire your pre-raid BiS from Strath"
---
Didnt get it....
---
Haha gotta have the old music that was used too, and have notepad to type what you wanna say 😂
---
Absolutely savage, and you are proud of it.
---
While I sympathise with the Forsaken, them working on the plague as early as in classic (which I somehow missed during my first play through) shows their intentions to not be all peaceful.
---
I haven’t played all the healer classes, but I would think that all of them will be able to heal dungeons while being specced for leveling up until at least the 45-50 level range. Someone please correct me if I’m wrong.
---
interesting, i've only ever seen alliance doing the greifing
---
Chat channel also had an auto block option though? And they could have just protected chat channel invites from add-ons if they really wanted to stop it? How often does a player get a legit chat channel invite after all? Just making the auto block chat channel a default would have stopped most, if not all, the spamming. 
---
Why break /who and stop all these other add-ons when they had other, less intrusive options.
---
Z-Perl Unit Frames
---
Players very fine players, on both sides.

In BRD, ice block pulling is much more efficient since the eye would die instantly from the nets.

He's a scary boi

Absolute ridiculous amounts of salt in this comment section

that, i fucking love it!

I don't think I can even explain it

Wrong!!! The helmet has crit. The shoulder has no crit. In this scenario the leather is actually an upgrade. Despite that I think he shoulda waited til ZF tho
---
People replying to you are a special breed, probably the same kind that attacks someone for wearing the wrong costume haha...Although I wager they've never been in a fight.
---
Like how low does someone's self esteem have to be to find themselves having to physically defend themselves from such "harassment".
---
I'm acually saddened by the amount agreeing to him being beaten up here, seeing as these are the classic forums where I expect we are mostly adults with adult lives.
---
Haha petition for blizzard to do it
---
please do something about that ui, it hurts my eyes.
---
What are some handy things to keep in mind when starting a guild? I feel Gehennas is in need of another non-scandinavian guild
---
I thought the /sit macro forcing crits didn't work in classic?
---
Okay i kinda figured. Also because Mages are like the 2nd or 3rd best class to lvl so I think mobs are a little easier for us.
---
I’m not sure you know common sense. Blizzards TOS isn’t against the law in your country. They’re not “hacking” anything when you gave them permissions, via the TOS you accepted. Not going to go back and forth over an oddly simple concept you cannot possibly begin to even understand.
---
Thank you mate I'm glad you liked it
---
God forbid people have fun right.
---
As a druid, all caster leather is mine.
---
Only shamans occasionally want it. But 80% of them seem to be enhancement anyways
---
Appreciate it &lt;3
---
While leveling, you can absolutely heal dungeons as a priest, druid, paladin, or shaman without going into those classes' respective heal specs. Nearly every healer you see in a leveling dungeon is healing in a dps spec, no need to respec every time you want to run a dungeon, that would be financially unfeasible.
---
People leveling as Enh shamans and Ret paladins and feral druids will want to keep a separate set of healing gear if they want to heal in dungeons beyond level 40 or so because their solo dps gear is all melee stats and after that level it gets pretty dang hrd to heal without some int for a bigger mana pool and ideally some spellpower/healing power as well. Ele shamans, shadow priests, and balance druids can heal perfectly fine in their dps gear until 60.
---
At 60, you do pretty much need to be a healing spec to heal, especially in raids. Healers have a hard time earning money the usual ways because their farming ability is limited and respeccing costs so much, so either they farm so much in dps mode to make up for respec costs, or they find other sources of income, like herbalism and alchemy, or fishing and cooking.
---
If someone wearing the wrong costume and yelling out some kingdom of said costume is enough to want you to punch someone, you need to re-evaluate your priorities man. Maybe get out more.
---
Okay like how though? You'd have to be underwater for such a long time and after the first two times why didnt he just log off.
---
Thank you so much!
---
you can turn off the chat you know?
---
Oh if you mean endgame pve then yeah it’s not super competitive. As a smite priest, you can do high burst damage but youll go oom just spamming smite. Many raids don’t like to bring shadow priests due to the debut limit, so if you can’t a casual group who doesn’t mind nonstandard specs, you can make it work. They work best with high crit and a paladin aura that boosts holy damage. 
---
If you mean leveling/questing, you’ll be fine but you’ll hit a slowdown at around 45-50.  It can still work.
---
I was on Mankrik today. Was that the raid that was streaming then got utterly annihilated?
---
Probably plays a gnome mage too
---
fucking scum, this isnt post worthy
---
Or I’ll need on whatever I feel like I need

Modern times call for modern solutions.

They also have 1.7 billion people who live there....lol

Is Demacia some sort of nerd rage trigger word? I'm not understand people's views here AT ALL.
---
For someone so obsessed and miserable you should have taken time to read the loading screens.
---
You’re suppose to take things in moderation, even World of Warcraft.
---
For graphics, yes, I also agree it looks nice, but we should also keep in mind year we’re in. Every game right now looks sick, crazy details, amazing visuals etc... but it’s 2019 and for 2019 standards, I am truly not sure how great wow looks compared to other games. Just my opinion tho.
---
Piss off everyone and become that guy. Or don’t. I don’t care, play the game you want. Just don’t be surprised when people think you’re a dick.
---
I 100% dont remember it to, but could be misremembering 
---
Do you have any proof?
---
Do people really get this worked up to drop dungeon over a 10 gold blue that will be replaced in 7 levels?
---
Yep.
---
Stay in swim form then stealth up as Cat when you see people doing the underwater collection quests. 
---
Then pop out of stealth cat (have the Hydrocane equipped for preference) and root them. 
---
Reapply roots as necessary and watch them slowly drown without being able to do a single thing about it.
---
Haha can imagine it now
---
You're cruel
---
But that's rogue...
---
Also, do you choke on the bag itself? All the dicks inside it at once? Or is just choking on one of the bagged dicks ok? Maybe I need to choke on each individually?
---
You're a rogue, you're only purpose is to unlock chests, every other class out damages you.
---
In my next video I'll do it just for you, thanks for supporting mate
---
The thing I don't like about silverpine is the long run when you die, in pyrewood, the wall, Ambermill etc.
---
But I guess on balance not as long as some barren runs
---
No well I thought sharding was something else. Sorry I’m new to wow :P
---
It's not what I care about. It's about unstated fact that for 11 years of wow I have NEVER encountered that kind of toxicity, therefore, it made me wonder...
---
Will do :)
---
The same as in vanilla
---
Or just FD. Or wingclip -&gt;conc shot kite and shoot. Meele weapons are stat stick for us Hunters, and thats that
---
Lol, imagine being so entitled that getting declined for a group for the first time ever and you just bitch on reddit and try and ruin their reputation over it. Grow up, everyone gets declined. He's a retard for declining you for a quest, you're a retard for whining about it, link your name so people can avoid playing with your frail ego.
---
The Blizzard Authenticator app is so small that it won’t even put a dent in your phone storage (for iPhone it’s 43kb).
---
Just get it, last thing you probably want is getting hacked because you’re worried about storage space.
---
How’s it dickish though? If I plan on using something, then I “need it” more than you.
---
Are these the same goons as in eve online and everywhere else?
---
It still applies. Skill hardly translates to experience gain. It is almost entirely a time factor. As for how you used that time, the term “hardcore” is applied. You rushed to max.
---
HA! I love Peggel so dumb but so amazing for those long runs.
---
Wow, both sides look bad in this.  Why would you post this here?
---
I've always liked editing so just combined it with memes, I used to do this with Fortnite but figured it could work with WoW
---
Everyone needs money. BoEs are just money. In a random pug with no loot rules I would need a high end BoE and then can trade later if there is legitimate need, but most of the time it is better to sell, unless it is pre-raid bis.
---
Sadly it's a player-moderated channel, so I very much doubt Blizzard will step in. I guess one can hope. I personally haven't steppee into world chat for that reason. I just use LFG.
---
Whenever I see a group with a warrior who won't tank I cringe.
---
Can someone ELI5 layering?
---
WOW COOL POST
---
Thank you bro
---
Thanks for the contribution to the conversation!
---
i would never inv a priest for dps pre 60. idk why anyone would.
---
So what would you call the comps?
---
Spellaoe and Meleeaoe?
---
not being able to play dwarf is the only bad thing about being horde
---
Jokes on him, there's a 60 human rogue standing behind him with deception on, they all about to get slaughtered
---
This line is starting to be the new -200iq universal response to pretty much anything
---
Seems some are sensitive to such a post, might try posting it there.
---
To put things into perspective, my guild has two lvl 60s right now, and we don’t plan on doing MC until Dec.
---
I’m spending all my free time playing WoW and I’m only lvl 47, and I think I have no life. I’m a higher level than most of my guildies who are in their 30s and early 40s.
---
So just imagine how even less of a life the no-lifers have who have been raiding for the past two weeks already, they must be playing 16 plus hours every day since launch. If they’re willing to min-max their life, they won’t think twice about min-maxing their raid.
---
Also is there actually a way to check your server's progress? Like to see if someone has taken server first or not?
---
Druid is pretty good for wPvP.  Virtually impossible for anyone to kill you if you don’t want to be killed.
---
Other strong options are rogues and hunters as both can engage on their terms and have a significant advantage when doing so.
---
Warlocks and shadowpriests, despite being the best 1v1 classes, are actually pretty frustrating in wPvP because they’re slow and anyone who doesn’t want to fight you can literally just out-run you.
---
The calculations for miss chance is:
---
5 + ((Defense Skill - Weapon Skill) x 0.1)
---
7 + ((DS - WS - 10) x 0.4)
---
The second one is used if the difference between DS and WS is more than 10, so if you have 300 WS against raid bosses with 315 DS, it will use that and have 9% miss chance.
---
Having 305 WS gives you 6% miss chance because it'll use the first equation, while having 315 WS gives you the base 5% miss chance because DS and WS is equal.

It made sense with the overall Bloodelf theme being their inherent addiction to magic which also causes a hunger for power. The starting questline goes into several times just how easy it is to slip into a state of no return.  
---
It may have been ungraceful for that reason.
---
you really post this here? How old are you? 5?
---
You produce 10% more threat in Defensive stance, and your 1H should attack alot faster than 2H so you generate alot more threat and more rage.
---
As an alliance player I generally think Horde have an upper hand in most world pvp do to having better placed towns and flight paths. However Alliance quest from lvl 30-40 in hillsbrad and horde quest from a much lower level.  Fights are never going to be fair there.  I tended to not engage horde until a troll ass mage tried sheeping me while I was walking by.  Lol like I'd let you get away with that.  Then I killed everyone near him....
---
I must resist for my skull lacks the superman hardness of Asmongold's.

I also live in Japan and get 200 ping.

That is very playable.

Gotta love when some peice of shit person gives themselves the 3 day ban.

100% agree.  It's like they tell time by the number of shards dropping from the sky instead of by a clock.
---
lvl41 priest now considering making dreamweave and shadoweave set. Not having any reagents though. Is it worth to buy them from the AH?
---
Fuck you. Shit like this is why my server is devoid of Alliance. They all are leaving.
---
No
---
Yeah GL banning the Chinese, they're on their own servers for a reason
---
Same with some mates of mine. They're like "Rag is already down? Is classic dying?" and "I hate dungeons because cleave groups!" I'm like chill out dude. Let them play the way they want. You don't have to abide by their way if you don't want to. Play it your way! Get a regular group together for dungeons! Some people just can't understand that others might want to do things differently, and that it's ok that they do. You just do you.
---
Yooo didnt know priests could Buff/Renew enemies with MC, thats sick.
---
Cleave comps were much easier than comps that relied on heavy CD use and proper CC. Of course you still needed to be high skill to get to a high rating using cleave setups, but they were much lower skill ceiling.
---
We did the same thing [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw4V0PAxI24&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw4V0PAxI24&amp;feature=youtu.be)
---
dazzling longsword will probably cost you more in listing fees over time than what it will get you
---
because role players are the only ones who are this nice to echother everyone else is posting pics of completed raids or complaining about getting ganked/ganking
---
I was in a bid war with someone last night, heavy hides with starting bid 1c, ofc i am going to bid. Then he rereleased them with proper bid. I am not mad or angry, i would do the same if i had put such a low bid on something. It is only normal.
---
The jealousy is real
---
From my experience playing with these cool kids doing "AoE groups" I think these people often are better than the average players playing "normal" comps.
---
This is wool cloth, not silk
---
Woaaw, that's interesting as fuck thanks dude good read.
---
The one where you gather 4 vials of water in azshara to try and 'cure' the sick tauren. Forgot the name. It's in the apothecary room though with the other apothecary quests
---
This isn't a dungeon finder issue though. This is a player base issue.
---
I can easily just go resto and join any group i want.
---
It’s young jefe homes
---
Because its hilarious
---
Sounds like impatient people that aren’t used to/doesn’t like the slow and controlled tactic. They need instant gratification so they can move on the next thing and check it off their list. I wonder what game(s) they’re coming from?
---
Sfk has a ton of boe blues that people need for twinks, which will be huge once BGs come out.

Hobbs ran scarlet monastery.
---
This is a sad reality tho.  I'm starting a mage alt, and know how bad it's going to be.  I know because I tank as my main and am just so fed up with about 85% of the mages in my groups...and it makes me not want to inv them.  Hard on the ones who are so great to work with.  :(
---
Sometimes I wonder if I’m on the wrong side.. horde seem to have a lot more fun
---
doubt it
---
Yes, they all the same "happiness" meter values, as far as I'm concerned. Be aware that the level of food you provide your pet with decides how much happiness they get. For example, a level 35 food item gives more than a level 25 food item, and if your pet is 30 levels+ higher than the food item, it won't eat it at all!
---
As a long time Dorf player who has been coerced into playing horde with people new to WoW in classic because horde is "cooler"... Yeah. Their zones were better. Waaay better. 
---
Kill my giant tauren ass.
---
If the pug has agreed on this, everything's fine. Do it in a random pug when nothing was said before, and people won't be very happy with you. So piece of advice, just tell people at the beginning and everyone's happy.
---
Not really. Hybrids are viable in other specs too, they're just not as good as other classes so most people don't think it will work with a shaman dps etc.
---
I have a 60 on a diff account.  Was averaging 50k/hr through stocks getting 65k-70k in SM atm.
---
There's a lot of angry people on Reddit who are extremely petty and jealous of just about anything anyone does
---
The spec is called beast-MASTER, not beast friend, right?
---
Venom raptor in ungoro isn't available in classic
---
Probably not. Paladins have ways to become invincible and heal themselves. Would be super tricky with a warrior.
---
Unless they are a paladin.

BoFreedom bitches!

This isn’t retail

What's a warlocks role in spell cleave groups? Eye of killrog pull and hellfire?
---
I’ve been making pretty solid gold doing zombie runs

yeah exactly lmao

Meridian 59*
---
Yeah, for a prot pally aoe grinding shield, that thing is second only to a Drillborer Disk, and that one's quite a way down the road for a fresh 60 and also engineer only.
---
You absolutely do not need pre bis in anyway. Nothing about it is hard.
---
Not yet, but I will be if it's necessary.
---
Alright! Thank you so much.
---
 This time around I rolled a Human for classic. Warrior. I used to not read quest back in the day cause I was really young and didn’t know what I was doing. It was my first MMO. (Eventually I bought the books). But this time I’ve read every single quest I’ve come across. Every. The human zones were super intriguing to me. From Elwynn to Duskwood. You get a real sense of what each of the states under stormwind are going through. And my my.... I didn’t realize how much Stormwind has neglected their subjects. Super cool storyline though. You get caught up in the politics too. Loved it. 
---
 But to be honest, anything with the elves is top tier in my opinion.
---
Downvoting cause i dont need people jackin them black lotus from me heh
---
Yup
---
Separate the eggs, beat the gnomes.
---
Warriors roll on everything they can get their hands on. It's worse than Hunters honestly.
---
At least Hunters have the stigma of being lootwhores. So most try and act right. Warriors just outright roll on everything for both tank and DPS.
---
Thank you! I’ll check it out.
---
ITT: jealousy and anger
---
That is a big brain mage tbh.  Carrying that around on the off chance he needs it.
---
What are the necessary steps to remedy it?
---
As a mage myself i dont even like aoe groups
---
Yeah it’s pretty bullshit. In later expansions these things got normalized but in classic it’s extremely obvious there was a heavy Horde bias at Blizz when they made the game.
---
I still much prefer classic to anything Cata and beyond. But it’s little things like the placement of towns like Kargath and Grom’Gol that get to me. Just a *little* too convenient.
---
People that actually have credentials and expertise don't go around telling everyone how much credit and experience they have.
---
Thank you for your kind words. When I read a comment 'I will have sex with your gf', I wanted to delete this post. Because it broke my heart. I wrote down a true story in hopes that no one else ends up like me. But too many were joking and mocking.
---
I feel I definitely no-lifed it. That is why I am level 54. I must now snap back to reality to take care of myself.
---
Wait for pallies. Anything tanking, healing or dps is usable by them, With a few weapon exceptions
---
With the layering? That's not unreasonable. I'll be a lot more interested in city raids in phase 2.
---
Why doesn't it say that you looted it in chat? Could someone be lying on the internet??
---
keep an eye on the ones posted and advertise in /2 from time to time, when prices seem to go down sell asap, when prices go up wait how high it goes
---
Outnumbered 3 to 1 sounds about right
---
I think it is a DF issue since it would completely resolve this problem by eliminating any prejudice anyone might have against your class/spec. You won't HAVE to go resto anymore to join groups and can go as dps if you wanted to without anyone objecting. And the best part is that the people who still want to "spell cleave" can still do that by doing the exact same thing they're doing right now, recruiting in trade chat.
---
Maybe cause it's a game and you can do dungeons without having ONLY the absolute best dps in your group? Why would you block people access for being priest dps? What are you 14?
---
A mighty level 21 warrior, a protector of the King's lands.  
---
Post yours!
---
Because cleave is mostly weapon damage and the talent only improves the very small flat damage bonus.
---
Yup, as I said it's not about survivability but threat. Anything above 30% DR is easy to heal with standard pulls.
---
First week of classic I got kicked from a group because the Druid tank didn’t want me (shaman) rolling on the fang set.  I’ve been soured on druids ever since.  I know full well it’s petty and I try to give druids the benefit of the doubt but I’m still wary.
---
warriors are a nightmare (fear immune) and shadowpriests are really hard too
---
WTH is tsa?

The aquatic form bit is wrong. You always unshifted if you jumped out the water. Obviously Tauren coming out of form simply near the top sucks though.

EU Laws prevent programs from sniffing processes of any other users that the program is running on. The only exception specifically stated are anti-virus tools. The ToS of Blizzard can not circumvent this. And obviously they don't otherwise this fishing thing would have been blocked a decade ago.
---
I know that it's difficult to accept when someone else is in the right but before you do make any claims like this, better inform yourself (by reading the relevant sections of the law/ToS) about what is and isn't allowed.
---
In general, most Laws are VERY consumer friendly

I don't have to go resto either. There are groups that don't mind hybrid dps specs because they know that content is easy enough.

The issue is that people don't see further than dps meters.

I only have to resto if I want to be able to join pretty much any group.

Spriest damage is viable, you're right. As long as you let them drink 30s between every single pull. Oh, and your tank needs to be really good, too, because spriest threat is off the charts.

Yup, that's the only other option! No chance they're both lame/weird and other options exist. Good comment.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but spamming sunder is great because it gives enemies more chances to dodge and thus proc overpower

Much love, my dude. Take your girl out on a date. Have fun outside the game. Azeroth will be there when you get back.

Ive played a fuck ton of OSRS, and i kinda expect thats where the game is going eventually. I really hope they dont adjust the leveling grind but i do expect to see additional content added slowly. Like if OSRS had never added content it would be dead af. But they do add content and sometimes its dumb and op but sometimes its legit and improves the game

I wasn't Implying that I had experienced or suffered, I played the damn game the way everyone I know did. I'm not forcing anything on anyone, in fact, Im advocating that players actually have *more* freedoms, not fewer. 
---
Point of fact, It has happened to me. I dont play ranged classes, I've only ever mained melee classes in Vanilla, and so I never had the means to even return fire. Instead, I climbed the nearby terrain, or I took cover. I adapted, I fought back, as you should if you made the conscious decision to play on a *PVP* server.
---
If you want a safe place, you shouldve rolled on a PVE server, OR alternatively go stand in a faction controlled zone for 30mins and let yourself deflag for PVP. 
---
Also, that counter argument is a complete non-sequitur. Not locking your door/the act of larceny is a thing we want to avoid because we risk losing something. This is a Game. You dont even lose Item durability upon PVP death.

This is the same sub where, literally 5 days ago, we had a top-voted post outraged that blizzard had somehow gimped the Warlock's ability to grief in cities by making the Infernal non-hostile. Hypocrites thy name is, and always will be, Redditors.

ok then why do they have chinese style buildings on top of them?

You can also clear dungeons with 4 people instead of 5. Why make your life harder to accommodate meme specs when you can just pick a meta spec.

This amazes me too.  The slowing point for runs is almost always healer mana.  Sheep = less incoming damage.  Healer saves mana, and it more than makes up for the (tiny) amount of extra time that the 1 less mob being aoe'd gains.
---
I mean if your running a 3+ aoe group, fine.  But for a 1 mage group sheep is probably the biggest single time saver that could be happening.
---
If you get 11 points into resto to increase the range on totems you don't have to move/recast them that much. Also even without talents they are pretty cheap. A lot of totems are like AoE cooldowns anyways that you don't use constantly. Tremor, poison cleanse and mana Tide have their uses at specific times and you just know when to use them.
---
10g is still a big deal for most of the people playing.

I generally don’t bother with these things. Particularly when it’s not a reward for me to use it.

In swtor you actually get 100 credits for using it monthly. Still I don’t use it there.

I don't necessarily use burner phones. I just happen to be a clutz and break my phone sometimes. I try not to, but they make these things so delicate now. When I have to have an authenticator app tied to the phone instead of texting, it makes it a hassle to get back in.

What do people get out of open world pvp in WoW? Especially in 2+VS 1? I never really understood.

Combat sword spec is the best raiding spec for rogues

But fury warrior is the best duel wielding class in the game...just not bound to using just swords

Did that on my other character, but it's impossible to level that way.

i feel bad that all the effort this guy put into this video, he gets 23 upvotes after 12 hours.

You just end up working them in to your playstyle as and when you need them. Eventually you work out what does and doesn't work for you. For levelling, totem use isn't huge (I probably overuse mine by using them for nearly every mob). For dungeons, you can drop a couple by pull or in an area that will benefit you for multiple pulls. For raids, you'll often just keep your 4 'main' totems up as much as possible. For the fairly low mana cost and a global cooldown, it's not hugely time consuming to drop them. It just becomes automatic after a bit.
---
It's more interesting in PvP though, as you're constantly having to juggle buffs and utility depending on what you're fighting. It's a really large toolkit and takes a bit of effort to get the most out of, but you can do a lot with it if you utilize it properly.
---
Just have a mage range pull.  Skilled mages make warriors pretty obsolete in spell cleaves.  Especially skilled AND coordinated mages

That feel when you're in a group and the warrior asks why he'd put points into tactical mastery, the priest who came to heal only uses vampiric embrace, the warlock taps to 1 while mobs beat him to death, and the mage is using an un-improved rank 1 blizzard from 20 levels ago but he said he was a frost mage.

There's an abyss where the feels used to be. It's SM pug groups on a Saturday morning.

Well that guy can go fuck himself, as a priest basically 100% of my water comes from random mages in dungeons
---
It is different because raids like MC and Onyxia have unique raid IDs. If you 10-man a dungeon, it does not create a unique raid ID for that instance even though you are in a raid group. One is a raid instance, the other is a raid group. These are mechanically very distinct things.

You have ZERO idea what you're talking about.

Significantly less xp for someone outside the party helping kill a mob?  I throw an areow at something on my rogue if I happen across someone significantly lower than me to help them mill their current target.  Does that mean I shouldn't be?
---
Would have been funnier if he was playing a human, but still made me laugh
---
Yeah, I kind of knew it coming in but the biggest difference for me right now is the population disparity.  There are almost always way more horde than alliance and when you are leveling in a place such as Badlands and you don't have a fo or quest hub area and the horde does it kind feels like shit.  
---
Also having to deal with the constant 3v1s when questing in the contested zones probably wouldn't feel as bad if there was a safe location near by but there never is.  However for the horde there towns are so conviently placed.
---
pretty sure we got a nerfed version of vanilla
---
Bruh claw is a focus dump, it’s very good. Not many pets have a burst and a focus dump
---
What kind of weirdo doesn’t understand a joke?
---
If you are ally on a server with 70% horde for the way some quest are designed just forget about exping in those zones, arathi is a good example. I have been trying to do some low level stgv quest for a couple of days but is just impossible, you get stuck at the graveyard and have to quit the char. That's why I think this is not the usual pvp or the one I remember from the old days. But if people have fun this way I guess im the only one that doesnt like to stare at a black and white graveyard all day long.
---
About what? I’m not that sure about how classic is working right now so there could be a system like retail where you can try a character thill lvl 20,
---
I can't take you seriously if you think LFG is good. It trivializes an iconic part of the game, now just press a few buttons and do whatever.

Weird r/ihavesex at the end there but ok

Spoken like a Stalagg Horde player. Imagine being outnumbered 3 to 1 [every day on the server](http://wowpop.appspot.com/realms/stalagg/20). I, thankfully, am already 54 so I can just dungeon to 60 but I've had three real life friends that played vanilla, as well as a group of people from retail that came over to join up with a guildie, all quit off the server due to shit like this. Take a look at all of the numbers in the link - it appears bad initially, but only gets worse. Particularly, look at how we have more characters listed inactive at an raw/absolute level even though we're outnumbered 70% to 30%; we have more inactive even though they have considerably over twice as many players. That, along with the fact that the free transfer destination server is already alliance heavy even though its source is horde dominant, signifies just how many alliance are getting camped off of Stalagg. Ironically, this will only lead to the server becoming a horde pve server in the long run, so the horde are actually killing our server's long term health much like they're killing azeroth to exploit it for their own gain lul. 
---
In all seriousness, it only compounds on itself because now you have people like me, who wouldn't transfer except for the sake of having a healthy server in later phases, that are going to transfer to a low pop server (heartseeker) or reroll on a good pvp server where the alliance is less-outnumbered (still outnumbered a bit ideally).
---
So yeah, when you're outnumbered 3 to 1 on a constant basis due to server faction imbalance, have been ganked constantly across the world, and then something like this happens to waste even more of your time? It's a dick move for sure - regular pvp, fine, but kill him quickly and move on with your damn lives otherwise you're only harming your server health in the long run.
---
Maybe he was smoking three and accidentally choked on one
---
wouldnt using text formatting be growing up
---
Fastest would be to rush to 60 as current spec, then respec and start running the 50-60 dungeons as prot for your bis gear. 
---
Or you can respec at 56 or so, run lots of BRD, and get very comfortable with prot by 60.
---
Do not sell this, you can use it to make a awesome farm spec for paladins and this one makes it even more OP
---
Edit: love the ui!
---
People are so damned trigger-happy nowadays to ignore others, it's unbelievable. You hurt yourself in your own game if you ignore so many people
---
Oh and it's before they made him pink!
---
My macro (which I can't post because I'm on holidays without my PC) is similar except it also includes a mouse over check so I can cast it on people without targeting them and an mod:alt for selfcast.
---
If they have the mob tagged they get xp as if they killed it alone. If you're in a party with them killing mobs however then they get reduced xp.
---
Smite spam is good DPS, but makes your mana pool look like warrior's.
---
he spent the whole thread adamantly refusing he ever camped in that spot...
---
Ive been called a poly addict as a mage. That felt really good.
---
Is it easy to find a raid spot as a druid ? I heard that most raid have only 1 or 2 spot for them.
---
Nice one. Enjoy him til level 37. 😝
---
I cannot even imagine how horrifying must be for someone to gasp for air while getting the clam... damn clamn owners, not washing those clams
---
Yesterday i did a quest that turns in orgrimmar bank and i dinged 57, still some people gratzed me.
---
In hindsight, I should've saved that quest to ding 60. I doubt i will have another opportunity like that.
---
actually its because we regen health at a much faster pace than mana thanks to Demon Armour that has passive health regen, so if we do that in between pulls you often find that where close to topped up for the next one. Also food is easier for a warlock to make than water.
---
One point in improved blizzard?
---
What the fuck even
---
Why not create thaat level 1 on arcanite reaper right away?
---
I see the pile of bodies. there's still nothing to show he actually fought from that position, and he claims otherwise.
---
it was 10% dmg reduction, not 10% more threat from defensive stance correct, the actual amount of bonus threat was not stated in the tooltip.
---
The thing is that these lockboxes contain items and there’s many many clusters of lockboxes in the world that you can open to level LP without stealing green/blue items from your dungeon groups.
---
So if you disable claw, your cars initial burst will suffer. And holding aggro for 20s, is all about that burst opener. 
---
My ref is to try the pets out. In the end you always want a cat wolf and boar/serpent
---
there was entire guilds banned for abusing it in raid. Grizzly had their entire 40 man core banned for 30 days lol.
---
You misunderstood. I'm specifically saying don't let it get to you and just have fun.
---
To clarify for raids and dungeons, you'll likely be totem twisting. Keep 3 totems up, drop windfury, swap it to something else (grace of air usually), then 8 seconds later windfury and then GoA again. Repeat.
---
Whoa, huge spoiler there.
---
Interesting.
---
I played on an RP-PVP realm in Vanilla and there were ganks but so much amazing world PVP.
---
Now I play on an RP-PVE server and it feels, well, weird?  
---
The first times I ran into Alliance there was a rush and all the "ooh, are we fighting or just waving hellos? What's it going to be?" until I realised it doesn't matter.  
---
None of it matters.  
---
There's Alliance, especially Night Elves, running through Barrens at all times and it's just a thing.  
---
I run into Alliance anywhere and it's less than running into a mob because at least I can interact with a mob.  
---
Best I've been able to do is help out some Alliance every now and then by killing a mob they're fighting if it looks bad.  
---
But even that tastes like ah, since it's the *only* way to interact, not like on a PVP-realm where doing good deeds was your own choice. It felt good.
---
But yea, having your description I can see why you wouldn't enjoy it. I don't think I'd enjoy it either.  
---
But it doesn't reflect my own experience almost at all.
---
I can relate to this guy. You mages and warlock are dicks - pulling everything like it’s all yours.
---
Yeah exactly, but they still put 2 a stack to get max profits
---
&gt; if Microsoft will wise up and put a stop to it
---
No, thy won't. Making sure that Windows (even pirated) is on every single kitchen sink in the world is more important and gets them more money in the end.
---
What add on to you for the auction house price and the disenchantment material?
---
I wouldn't worry about it too much, they're not the ones who play your character.
---
I'm a rogue too. Tell them if they need,they can roll need on them. As a rogue you have priority just like a int cloth user have a priority over a int cloth equipment. Ask them to link the keys to the chat. I doubt they will have it. If they have it, they should roll need as do you.
---
Good.

Going to quote myself from another comment:

That's what I already expected, hey, good for you that you can customize your UI in a way that you can play this game effectively! And grats on 60!

Over on Pagle I was wandering around and ended up checking in on Humar and I be damned if he was up and I was still like 6 or 8 bars from 23 and I freaked out and started grinding on everything close by and never letting Humar leave my sight.
---
A lower level orc hunter came through, level 18 or 19 I think, and stopped and watched me and got sorta close to Humar and I did the friendly wave as I got semi in front of him but not too close... and he left toward Ratchet and I kept at my grind, I was really close now to hitting 23 and then I saw it! Two horde, a undead priest and tauren shaman level 25 and 26 came into view and headed right towards Humar and me ...  they came right close to Humar and I stood there less than half a bar from 23 and I waved at them and then backed away slowly and kept killing everything close by and that lower level hunter came back and stood with them ... they were talking and saying stuff but never attacked Humar and eventually went towards Ratchet and I dinged 23 and like you, he resisted my freeze trap and almost killed me as I completed the tame.
---
That orc hunter came into view and waved, he had been hidden close by in the hills I assume and watching me.
---
I was so surprised and grateful to those friendly horde players for letting me tame Humar.
---
&gt;Grasps at straws, views post histories for ammunition.

I want to make an alt for world pvp.(basically a semi-twink that i park in crowded area). What class and lvl would be best for this? I was thinking either a lvl 49 warrior or a lvl 29 rogue. I also like that idea of lvl 29 ret paladin, but in world pvp everyone can disengage from fighting you.

No, choosing a class locks you out of any other class.  This literally makes no sense at all.  Being able to conjure food and water didn’t lock me out of being another class, it was me choosing mage at the log in screen that did.  Conjuring food and water is a benefit I can bring to the party because I chose a mage, just like unlocking chests in dungeons is a benefit you can bring to the party because you chose rogue.  Unless you’re a selfish prick and believe you deserve it all.
---
No then your cat will have a very weak opener. Yes it will growl twice but do you really wait 10s b4 attacking? 
---
You can try it for yourself with a dps meter, how much dps a boar and cat does, it’s identical in a 20s duration. Cat shines if the fight is longer and longer, then it’s 20% more dmg will edge out

If it’s dual swords you’re after, play a human combat rogue. You get + 5 racial skills in swords, +5% hit chance from talents, + an additional 5 skill in swords from talents and a 5% chance to proc an additional attack from a sword swing. All of this on top of the racial makes for an incredibly strong solo levelling experience and top dps throughout all content. For the Horde variety like

myself, it’s a tie between Orc and Troll where racials are concerned.

The easiest way to find dungeon groups is to join the ones that are looking to complete the quests. They'll usually accept anybody.

Also I've lvled a couple mages to 20 on live just cause its free. BLINK FOR LIFE!!!!
---
Imo Alliance has better low level zones and quests and the raids are relatively easy to get to (except AQ), but Horde has it easier with dungeons and the races have way more useful pvp abilities and they dominate stv and tanaris
---
How does that not make sense? The majority of the slow effect comes from that first point, and this obviously isn't some aoe grinding build.

Pretty sure this is against the Moonglade Convention of Basic Rights

Ow shoot, i compared my EXP to wowhead classic on 2/3 quests. Guess i just hit a bad train of mislisted exp. Good to know

I joined a few months before classic released and there was so many annoying or elitists there I just left and didn't come back.
---
Tanking is more like everyone saying "Imagine having no threat, keeping no aggro, doing low dps and still taking damage OMEGALUL". Basically everytime...

It most definitely should be. The overwhelmingly majority of raids struggle to even get 40 members in the first place.

Well, If you weren't petty and abusive like some kid I may have taken you seriously. But ever since that "90% were DS" comment and insults from your first answer but especially this one I know what you're about and you're not a good influence on this community. I know DS has a place but will probably never specc it because the reasons listed. You shouldn't get your panties in a twist if I argument for sm ruin but you do you. It's sad one can't have a decent discussion without you acting out. I sure as hell had success in the game, but nice try trying to put me down. Get a clue and have some respect is my advice, better than you looking this petty.

A "grand" total of 33 realms worldwide for name reserve...and today, we have what? 42 EU realms, 32 NA realms, 4 OCE and 65 Chinese. 
---
143 Classic WoW realms. More than 4 times of what Blizzard thought it will be enough. Most of them Medium and High pop, which basically means between 30k to 40k players per realm. Easily today, 3 weeks after launch, there are like 4-5 million Classic players, which clearly put the launch numbers at over 6 million players.
---
Even with the low 4 million players figure, Classic WoW is bigger than BfA, FFXIV and ESO...combined.
---
Classic WoW will be the biggest MMORPG on the market for a very long time, because I cannot see it going under 2 million players until Naxx.
---
And when TBC and Classic+ server options will be announced, it will bounce back to 5-6 million players or even much more.
---
China or not, Blizzard hit the jackpot with Classic. I hope that they are smart enough to understand that Classic game design philosophy is what brings steady, long term profits and millions of players that will play a true MMORPG as long as it is not infested by stupid class balance crap, flying mounts, pets, cosmetics, cash shop, dungeon and raid finders, titanforging casino, patch gear reset, t-mog and other such short-term money boosts at the expense of losing 90% of the player base.
---
Why wouldnt you just play on australian servers?
---
I saw an undead guy on my server with the same name for his voidwalker. I was gushing to my guild about it but I didn’t screen it unfortunately =\ best name ever
---
To get a different race’s mount, you must first be exalted with the respective faction.
---
That's thousand needles
---
I'm also annoyed by people not inviting you to dungeons because you're not outlvling the zone by being the last boss' level
---
Just Claw, Growl, Great Stamina, and resistances.
---
&gt; Anytime alliance has EVER been red, I get attacked.
---
This can't be true.
---
I’m on that server - horde.
---
It is. 
---
1) play around on [this link] (http://wowpop.appspot.com/realms/stalagg/20) - you can adjust the level and also the number of inactive vs active players etc. This shows a MASSIVE horde population (more than one would expect, even - 70% horde to 30% alliance). However, unfortunately, the alliance have more characters at every level bracket I saw listed as inactive (not seen for 14 days) than the horde have listed as inactive. So, even with the massive population difference, we have more characters that haven't logged in for 14 days (even at higher level brackets). I personally had three real life friends that played vanilla with me quit already.
---
2) Heartseeker (our free server transfer destination) is 51% alliance. While that's not very biased and is low pop, given the source server's population imbalance, we can discern that a higher percentage of alliance are transferring off because they're getting camped out of every zone in the world.
---
So were you tilted?
---
Wait. If we kill thannos in that realm will he be dead in the other realm. Or is it 2 different time streams
---
I pretty much nolife'd my way to 60, and then decided to enjoy other aspects of life. It's sort of annoying to be a weekend away from the game when there's so much to do, but at the same time I most always realise how relaxing and enjoyable stuff outside the game can be. I definitely felt a little tired of my warrior as I neared 60, and took a break from playing that character for 5 to 6 days, and I don't wanna put myself in that situation again.
---
The biggest guild in the game is an Alliance guild (Olympus) known for only PvPing when they outnumber you.
---
I always tell tanks not to worry about my mana unless I tell them I need to drink.
---
Prot is definitely the easier tank, in terms of keeping up threat anyway. Or maybe I've just played with terrible arms warriors, but a single warlock dot and gone was their aggro.
---
I would have killed you too if I knew you were going to make this post
---
I'll usually give my healer friend 6 stacks of water, everyone else gets 2-3, more if I'm feeling generous.
---
Hey guys, i think you can do it as other classes, but you might need to be able to kill some packs of trash
---
so, you are the kind of guy who uses words like "lul" omegalul" lulw"?
---
Hahaha bad english, sorry. 😁😁
---
Burn him! Skin him alive!
---
Dun Garok is the place to be lol!
---
I was flying through the Barrens when this conversation occurred. Didn’t screenshot unto I landed in 1k Needles.
---
no is not possible
---
Is the hit chance for finishing moves from combo points lower than the point builders?
---
Revenge!
---
For the alliance
---
I mean, bear druid is a tank, so no?
---
It makes me sad that the incredibly lame mechanic of dishonorable kills will probably put an end to all of these awesome, cool city raids.
---
doesnt show up for me, works anyway
---
My demon hunter has Garrosh and Sylvannas in the warchief tent. I like to imagine everyone is Org is awkwardly pretending they can't see him.
---
Authenticator worth getting 100% been using it for 7 years, and switched to 5 new phones hassle free.
---
This post is full of so many great ideas!
---
It's probably due to some pservers having each spawn point only spawn one mob type.
---
I get far more better crits with Carapace Spine Crossbow than what I got with Riphook so I'm pretty sure it depends on weapon damage range. Can post some screens as a proof when I get home from work. Should still have the Riphook in my bank.
---
I didnt know I needed a Warcraft anime series until now.
---
Basically what you already did
---
Looks like something like Titanpanel. It shows you what you have to do until your next level. Top is mob kills, quest turn ins, Dungeons, don't know what the alliance symbol is for but probably cloth turn ins?, 31% is your current xp and the last is the time you need if you keep going at this pase.
---
you should play the original mission. there's probably going to be a lot of ret-conning in reforged.
---
it's from a creator that is used to having a face to a smartphone.  Everything impacted towards the center for the focus.  It's zoomer\_cyber.evolution
---
They were in as an obscure easter egg in Warcraft 3 and then later featured as a hero in the expansion pack. 
---
I really don't think China as a market was even on their radar back in 2002. Blizzard was a much different company back then. Also, some of their depictions of Pandarians were considered to be offensive because artwork featured them in Japanese clothing.
---
They did  make some changes to appease the Chinese market, though, in Mists of Pandaria. Chen's eyes, for example, were changed from green because green eyes are seen as a bad thing over there. Then there's the removal of skeletons/exposed bone, etc.
---
It feels like cheating because it is cheating.
---
I think priest is totally great for solo content, and as you start to make more friends, you can do some healing too! Make sure you look up a guide though (check icy-veins for instance). I didn't know priests needed a wand when I started Classic and BOY was that a game changer in solo content.
---
Also, priests have Stam buff that you can toss out to random passerbyers, you can cast a quick heal on an adventurer in trouble, you can fear off packs with Psychic Scream long enough to heal a stranger and save the day! 
---
The best part of classic is that we all need each other and I've found being a priest is a great way to break the ice and participate in a community that's always in need of fortitude and heals. Be friendly and people will love you. And you'll love WoW all the more!
---
Only if your name is Semenseagal
---
Not joking, love every other element of classic apart from no dung finder
---
&gt; I have responsibility in real life.
---
Only if you want to.
---
Hey man, thanks for sharing. Getting addicted can be pretty bad but recognizing you are addicted is great. Good job recognizing cause now you can make improvements and adjust to having such a great game to play after work, and after all responsibilities have been taken care of. Real life comes first man and believe me, it actually feels even better playing when you have completed everything that needed done for the day. I didn't no life it but I could have gotten there if I wasn't careful. I myself am slowly progressing every day or two when I have time to play but it is still a blast. Everyone should take note and do a life check and make sure they aren't addicted and if they are hopefully they can realize through your post and the experience of many others like them. Best of luck man!
---
That's unfortunately not been my experience, but I would appreciate any tips that make it so.  I was under the impression that Nightfin Soup would be a good source, though it and everything else seems to be just barely above vendor price on the AH.
---
A few days ago someone put 20 iridescent pearls into the AH 5 copper below vendor price. Best day of my life.
---
Yes gnome racials great for this
---
I am completely fine with tanking every dungeon and UBRS in a cookie cutter DW fury spec.
---
Brings me back to the Eyes of the Beast days in Northshire Abbey
---
they can’t donate to him irl so they donate gold?
---
Imagine a hunter rolling on ravager for some over a warrior or shaman, yea I’ll take that wand
---
This guy’s alliance.
---
I hope he doesn't lose that character anytime soon
---
Gotta do what you gotta do
---
Dps  build brotha
---
there is a quick fix version of msbt on wow interface.
---
Also, for an overpower trigger, why not just use weakauras? you can probably find a readymade string on wago.io to import into wa, saving yourself time.
---
I've seen full warrior setups that track swing, procs, sunders, etc. for wa that end up replacing multiple mods
---
Well I dunno really. Imo I am not making fiends by using lfg chat. Maybe because I don’t want new friends. I am a deep friend guy. I only want really close friends I can talk about life with. Everyone else is just random ppl that one can have friendly conversations with. But I don’t want friends in wow cause friendships comes with deep commitments for me. 
---
I like to fiddle with the current classic system. Set up a group, travel to the instance. Say a few nice words in chat and go about it. Granted I never start groups myself but I am more than happy about answering the call from others. 
---
The only thing I find boring and cumbersome is the ghost walk from a graveyard 2 sones away to get back to the instance. That is 100% unnecessary and I hate it. 
---
But in summary. I don’t need dungeon finder in classic. In retail I love it, but retail is a different game. Way more fast paced.
---
D saur mafioso tryna burn dirty money
---
Especially at end game, dps warriors will absolutely roll on leather and mail. very few of their dps bis are plate
---
honestly, FLEXED on.
---
So basically.. make the game easier for you?
---
Do /join LookingForGroup and search there
---
How did you find the population of the server? I need to know thunderfurries population.
---
You guys really need to get a life
---
/1 yes but also /join lfg and /join lookingforgroup
---
Square shaped minimalistic maps are the way to go!
---
Have you ever considered not rolling on your off-spec over somebody rolling on it for main-spec?
---
They are always automatically set to the very starting zone for every race (the area you zone into when you first make a fresh char).
---
Lmao you think people care about likes compared to money? Ever heard of 'can this video get 1 million dislikes'? the only way I see anyone thinking that is that themselves care more about social media than income while being oblivious and assumptive of the world around them
---
In the /join lookingforgroup channel?
---
Killing gnomes is supposed to be creative
---
He did a bunch initially in Stockades while waiting for me and others. I know he did outside of Deadmines as well.
---
I'd say plan your questing eith a decent amount of humanoids nearby. He would pickpocket during our downtime a lot. It's all relevent.
---
Ngl I thought all the UI comments were hilarious but at the end of the day ur the one playing with it, as long as it works for you there's nothing wrong with it. You do you homie, grats on dinging
---
Counterspell is not a dispel
---
Flight paths don't get cheaper with Reputation levels, right?
---
30-40k per realm? A lot of EU realms are way less than that. Probably half of them. There are a select few with a monstrous population.
---
Bots do exist. I know because.. you know.. I know 😉
---
She felt weird after drinking from a pool near the naga beach in aszhara
---
Summons if somebody leaves, provided healthstones, some groups will have the voidwalker round up mobs to start a pull if they aren't running a tank. Other than that hellfire or rain of fire.
---
I use ElvUI just for the map.
---
I was just about to ask the same thing. Mend pet and revive pet have seats been separate abilities.
---
It is literally in the name of the item.
---
Fall damage, drowning damage, everything
---
Do you have mana problems while healing or all the time?
---
i´ve been denied plenty as a 56 rogue usually they just ignore me when i ask for an invite im also on a server where mages are the most popular class on alliance
---
Okay. Is hit calculated the same way on lower levels as in level 60? So a level 50 have 5% chance to miss a level 50 mob.
---
Happy cake day
---
Did I ever say I'm stealing people's main spec gear for my off-spec? Not to mention that a lot of tanks are main spec dps.
---
Started a new undead char this morning on the same server. Compared to release week the starting zone is calm like a graveyard.
---
Isn’t that how we do it? I remember Preach making an off-handed comment a while back about Taunt being a crutch. I’m lvl 35 and tanked most dungeons and seem to do alright without taunt 80% of the time. I use it when I lose aggro, not to build it! 
---
I’m still learning Warrior but zero wipes or issues yet.
---
http://wowpop.appspot.com/realms/thunderfury/20
---
Here is the link to Thunderfury for above level 20 - you can adjust the level bracket on the right. Looks like 15k active Horde vs 11.3k active Alliance above level 20.
---
What does a free kill get you?
---
What? He did whatever the fuck he wanted instead of level to 60 asap?! He should stick to Fortnite and leave Classic to the real gamerz like us. \s
---
I had the same thing happen!  It was when I decided no more pub mages if I have a choice...and when I chose to roll a mage alt who's gonna be a good ol' sheepin mage.
---
It is wrong, warriors gain 1 attack power from agi, and 2 from str
---
Fuck the alliance
---
And tbh its fine to report bots. Using a bot so bad, they dont deserve it. The fun part of botting is when people cant se the difference between a bot or an player.
---
I have been leveling as a holy/disc priest. I'm level 48.
---
You are both an excelent dungeon healer and a very efficient soloer (slow but very steady). Just make sure you grab the 5 points in shadow tree that give you extra spirit on kill, stack spirit, grab a good wand, unload your best spells early in the fight and wand the target for the remaining of the fight so you start to regen mana.
---
That’s Oki but why does someone want to donate to someone? Is he poor? Does he need money to buy food? I simply don’t understand donations to anything else than pure welfare for poor ppl. 
---
Maybe it’s me being European and donations is not a thing here. For charity to help unfortunate souls but outside of that....why?
---
Nameplate addon?
---
i thing the best way how to figure this out is put into a test your dmg. find out, if you loose dmg with lost rage and stance swaping right away (after overpower into berserk) or while staying too long in “wrong” stance and spendong all rage that would be lost otherwise. 
---
ideal slution would be waiting after using any ability. you have time before your next swing anyway so after OP wait that 3 seconds and if you would have too much rage, pres heroic strike and swap after melee hit.
---
Every auction addon has a plugin that shows this and more. If you want JUST vendor price, then addon called "vendor price" is for you. But you probably want either TSM of auctioneer anyways, as standard AH interface has always sucked balls
---
I'm trying to have my Earth Shock macro work on target when I push the key, and on shift, to mouse-over and rank 1 for interrupts. I have this:
---
    #showtooltip Earth Shock
---
    /cast [@target, harm,] Earth Shock; [@mouseover, harm,][@target, harm,][mod:shift] Earth Shock(Rank 1)
---
But the mod part isn't working... what do I need to change?
---
Alright, cool. The original point of this entire subsection though was that whoever started calling AoE cleave is an idiot. In Vanilla and TBC at the very least, cleave and AoE were two separate terms that meant two separate fucking things that were important to distinguish from one another. No one is asking you to change the way you talk, but the natural evolution of the conversation brought us here, which brought us to some dickweed calling someone pedantic. Now here you come 10 hours later to give your pedantic 3 cents. How fun is this?
---
You to cannibalize for full effect
---
Hmm. You could try assembling the map again group fear or get down to 1 mob and cc it. Open chest then restart quest loot key from dead mob and try it. Just thinking aloud.
---
As a priest should i take tailoring or alchemy? Having herbalism as a first profession.
---
You didn't really understand...i am talking about aoe packs that pretty much you have to aoe
---
i think its more you\`r social skills that have decreased.  
---
I\`m having a blast, making tons of friend, trolling people, laughing, making my own groups.
---
For the Horde.
---
That said drink is expensive if you pull early I need to drink again next pull wasting my money and your time.
---
What are the rewards for getting exalted with The Steamwheedle Cartel?
---
pvp problems have pvp solutions
---
make the game easier for casual players not just neckbeards
---
Well yes, but no. If the zep doesn't drop him when it teleports, and if he did run all the way to a tirisfal/barrens GY and spirit rezzed there, it would teleport him BACK to the original one he was placed at when he died (the one in STV).
---
sounds like a pve player to me
---
I believe TSM have already set up classic realms data, check it again
---
yeah that's just unfortunate though
---
Never to late. Especially with several million people playing at any given time.
---
New alts, new players, old players taking it easy. You will run into everyone. A few asshats along the way, but most people are more calm on a game like this because instant gratification is rare in wow outside pvp... Not as rare as other mmorpgs like EverQuest. But rare enough it takes the pressure off
---
Your the one agreeing with him. On top of that making a blanket statement about rape apologists..
---
Believe it or not, your hands are about as dirty as the rest of the people in this thread. Stop trying to be morally superior - your obviously an asshole too.
---
Its probably one of the closest realms to being balanced
---
Taking pot shots at people from atop those buildings (when in a place where guards can't reach them) is a punishable offense. Report them.
---
I found it easier as prot but maybe that is just me.  I liked having imp revenge/concussion and shorter taunt CD.  It didnt help that my 2hander was terrible so 2-hand arms tanking was impractical.
---
Yeah. Submit a bug report maybe? Or get someone else on the quest to spawn the chest and you snipe it
---
Questing as alliance is actually cancerous which makes most people dungeon grind making the world even more horde dominant.  Peak hours is quite a miserable experience.
---
Maybe not even prot specced.
---
I know, know. You dont *need* to be prot specced, but it makes everything more achievable.
---
Slightly off topic; how is King B? I got lucky and Brokentooth randomly spawned in front of me (wasn't looking for him) so I've been using him for a while but im lvl42 at the moment and want to know if its worth swapping to King B next level?
---
i almost uninstalled this fkin game cause tanking is like taking care of children.
---
I literally just did that -.-
---
Saw a mage in IF with it yesterday, damn the glow was insane
---
Paladins are the worst class to gank. Unless I can drain his mana, shit takes ages. They can't kill me, but I can't kill them in reasonable timeframe either unless they get locked on holy when low or something.
---
I too don't breath when i am rushing that clam
---
Yeah this goes both ways idiot.
---
+30sp on a level one dagger and minornrun speed on boots were things i gave between alts back in the day
---
Don't worry bro I'll look after your girl. Where you at?
---
The guy ####nz has been posting that shit daily, they started as a zerg guild but now have some decent people. Too many for my taste, but good for people that want to be in large guilds.
---
Dont you know? Acquire Truefaith from strat *live* in order to attempt strat ud!
---
I did a Felwood quest which sent me to the shaman south of Ratchet.
---
Yeah no shit.
---
So I've been told by others aswell. I just got unlucky.
---
It's funny because my warlock is level 60 and I still haven't gotten her a voidwalker.  
---
or a succubus.  
---
or a felhunter.  
---
So I wonder what their names are. Maybe I'll get lucky and get Thannos even though I hate Marvel movies.
---
Pet happiness goes down a lot more when it dies.
---
As a feral DPS, I see BoS more as a damage tool. I don’t *want* to get aggro. I want to be able to unload my burst and hit five combo points as soon as possible to get maximum value out of combo point spenders. I don’t want the enemies to turn around and focus on me either as I want to Shred. Blessing of Salvation allows me more room to deal damage.
---
&gt;But I saw some people say that if you are a newbie there is no reason to play the classic
---
they were wrong a lot of people who are new are enjoying it
---
&gt; I wonder if the community is helpful 
---
some people are helpful. some people are not helpful.
---
Yes, but we really could do without overly automated boss encounter addons. I honestly think the reason why retail bosses have so many mechanics, that it becomes impossible to track visually, is because of these addons, they're almost mandatory. I'm wiliing to bet no-one can do a current retail mythic raid without dbm, bigwigs, weakauras and other such addons...
---
Hey man, I’m kinda in the opposite boat, took a few short breaks from wow to deal with real life stuff and I feel super behind (level 34). Seeing your post made me happy I found a balance with life/classic, and reminded me not to push it with nolifing just to catch up. I appreciate it greatly.
---
Prat only shows my level. Any idea how to change it to show  everyone elses
---
Hunters are the one class mages struggle with pre 60. If I as warrior could have something apart from rather pricy FAPs to take a dump on frost mages, I would stock up on it!
---
Takk the Leaper is special.  Don't remember if ti was dash or a baseline 40% speed increase.  He was nerfed some patch, and the ability was removed.  I believe that was after 1.12 but not entirely sure
---
Happy cd. Those enchants have nothing to do with the prof. They are from a quest
---
In 60 levels you're in for a treat!
---
Melee DPS druid's BiS weapon item drops in gnomer dungeon and only has 3 uses.
---
How the fuck did you level without a VW
---
&gt; Believe it or not, your hands are about as dirty as the rest of the people in this thread. Stop trying to be morally superior - your obviously an asshole too.
---
Want to try and justify any of that?
---
I solo them at 55 with shit gear
---
I get that it sucks, but my experience in vanilla where there were a lot of hardcore ganking, i remember being corpsecamped a lot. It spawned a lot of cool interactions with the other side. Notorious gankers were chased down, I think you kinda need the dicks to make it interesting, for me it created great memories, infuriating for sure. 
---
I'm using an addon atm called VanasKOS which lets me put people that gank me or I find interesing in world pvp on a list, so I can chase them down later. I mean we all see it different, I enjoy that part of it, creates competition and notoreity, like a couple of days ago a warrior and his friends killed me a couple of times, got him on the list then fucked him up solo, felt great :)
---
Only pvp servers
---
wtf it's not 1 month classic launched, of course you can get into it, I hit 28 yesterday lol and a bunch of people teamed up with me randomly all the time sicne we were doing the same quests.
---
Havent tried it but maybe have your whole wow game and localized addon folder installed on an external drive that you play off of
---
I think it's usually something like mb swp mf shield (as they get to me so I still take no damage) mf mb
---
You're saying I should cut out that final mb and just wand so I can regen mana sooner? 
---
The cycle you suggested would probably only get the mobs I'm killing to around 50% HP, so I'm doing half the damage with only swp and wand?
---
Download the Twitch App start a scan on the Laptop then login in on the pc and Download all your addons
---
Have you tried putting the mod part of the macro first?
---
Yeah.One thing they didn't have tho is layering abuse which is huge in farming
---
If you frostbolt spam a 54-55 elite as a level 53 you will die. Period. 
---
But yes, normally frostbolt spam is how a mage does pve
---
Amazing
---
Im not playing for the nostalgia at all, I've made multiple characters on private servers over the years and now soon I am maxed on classic just because its an amazing game. Give it a try.
---
Lvl 60 AND an epic AND cake day? Wow
---
“We”
---
As a representative of the Council of Internet Neckbeards (standards and quality division) - I'm going to have to insist that you use the print screen function on your computer. This is just a warning. Further infractions will result in deductions of good boy points and even suspension of tendie priveliges.
---
He probally exploited the layers on vendors who only stock 1 item and resold them on ah. Just like 70% of the people who are riding epic mounts did
---
Yeah this 100% for sure did not happen. As a 15 year hunter veteran myself, I've been through my fair share of mind controls and your pet is 100% tied to your status regardless. It is impossible for you to attack it, mind control or not.
---
I do the same, home pc and a on the go laptop i take with me. Just simply redownload each addon and extract into your addon folders. The addons dont take long at all to download as you probably know. &amp; just tweak your settings. Sometimes you find new settings and change up your ui differently on 1 pc to another.
---
If you have trouble questing as a druid, I can understand why you didn't like the warrior.
---
You need to copy your wtf file from your main comp to your laptop to the same directory (basically replace the folder)
---

Check your privilege.

My apologies sir. I will improve next time
---
Did you get level 60?
---
What did it cost
---
OP: Everything
---
Well people are getting banned for ganking from roofs so people are getting paranoid.
---
That's f**ked up. 🤣
---
Grats x2!  I made it all the way to 60 without a single BoE blue or purple dropping.  Not even while grouped up.
---
There is no api to fetch ah prices.
---
Worth noting that spirit doesn't equal regen for shamans. You get nothing from sprit unless outside the 5 sec.
---
So int is much more valuable really, alongside bonus healing. Mp5 can be good but depends on encounter times heavily.
---
It’s never existed anywhere except private servers.
---
I feel like I've been playing too much and I'm level 25.
---
How much do you need the cash you can earn from it now? Once you get more gold from it while seling, all other stuff you will need will be more expensive aswell.
---
Well, I'm in process of leveling a hunter up to 35 to do just that. It is pays off long term
---
I agree that spellcleave zoomers are bad for the game and themselves but if they want to play it that way so be it. About reserving items. If you have limited time to play you have 2 realistic options to get gear with a reasonable amount of runs. First method is reserving items. People who want the same item wont join but people who have nothing may join since there is only 1 item that they cannot get but there is plenty more. Second method is getting a guild or friends and farm it until everyone has the stuff they want or need, this takes more time than reserving it but you could have a dungeon ready the moment you can start playing. Third method is going with randoms and i dont know about you but i dont really want to farm rend for weeks before getting the shit i need. Reserving stuff that sell good money on ah is a tactic used by geared people. They get money that motivates them to run the place and dps get gear since there is 1-2 people less needing gear.
---
Which is cheaper than a sub...
---
Just play a rogue
---
^^ The only useful answer
---
I neglect real world stuff for classic as well. It's this sense that i want to experience classic and i fear that it may die tomorrow and cant experience it like it should be. Like playerbase drops to 0 or something and im not 60 and raided. That's why i neglect real world responsabilities.
---
I'm leveling as a shadow priest. Great for solo/leveling and you can easily heal all dungeons. You only need to change talents to heal for raids
---
“I can’t cast that yet.”
---
If you cast a heal and it drew aggro, then the tank wasn't doing his job, or you spammed too much healing.

Im a 44 Warrior, with 5 points in Axe specialization. I just got «the Rockpounder» from uldaman and im wondering if i should use that instead of «Bonebiter», which im using now. The rockpunder has better dmg and speed, but im concerned about the crit i loose
---
I would insta kick any paladin who needs on tank gear over a warrior, no questions asked. Go pop on your dress like the heal bitch your are.
---
Nah, just flipping and disenchanting.
---
Quick daggers with fiery weapon would be one way to greatly reduce the time needed to lvl. Once you hit 30, just pay a mage to boost you through SM til 40 or so. After that you're better off paying for a lvl 60 group to spellcleave you through ZF / BRD until they can cleave you through LBRS. At which point you'll be 60 in notime.
---
Horde guys know how to have fun. Alliance general chat is usually someone whining they got killed in STV.
---
The best we get is people are at least willing to bully Undead Rogues from time to time.
---
Ah gatekeeping fun in wow classic.
---
He pretended to be one of the mobs and the enemy attacked him.
---
10 hours of "Live to win!" Only way to REALLY grind
---
i still dont have vw at 60, its threat generation and damage is shit.
---
I've tried talking, people don't want to talk. They just want to speed run through the dungeon and then leave.

&gt;Would highly recommend doing this to anybody who doesn't mind shelling out money for enchants

The troll is killing humans NPCs for his quest and runs into a played dressed up and moves identical to those one NPCs, with also a very similar name the troll and mistakes him for one.

Frontstabbing is just misinformation being spread on purpose for some reason. It didn't work 14 years ago and it doesn't work now.
---
Lol, I like how I get downvotes whenever I say something nice about classic on its own subreddit.
---
&gt;to minimalise leveling speed
---
There's a way to turn walkspeed instead of usual run speed.
---
Fight bare-handed and naked.
---
Don't use abilities.
---
Don't even need gold to *minimalise* leveling *speed*.
---
I've tried something similar but didn't work. haven't tried with the whole folder yet tho, will try later. Thanks!

What tv series are you talking about?

This is how you get John Wick'd
---
Maybe in 5 man dungeons but you know thats not the only content Classic has to offer?

Im doing well in raids.

Swords are just easier solo because you don't have to be behind the target. Daggers can still be done, play how you wish.

No I literally called out a specific group of people. A group of people who happen to be awful. 
---
&gt; Even if you don’t see it, your just as bad of a person as the rest of us
---
Tell me how when I advocated no violence, called nobody names and only attacked a group of horrible people? You aren't making any sense.
---
I respect when a horde players clears the area for a quest mob and dont steal his kill, that is the different mindset
---
I often see that guy on Auberdine ! I was kinda triggered by the spelling of his name though.
---
Yea they're from Dire Maul, but no, they can only give 8 of a stat, 16 if it's both head and legs. Or 100 HP.
---
You don't need totems up for every fight, in fact while levelling you will just use Searing Totem for mob grinding because its cheap, in dungeons you can actually use your full range of totems for boss fights although they wont make a massive difference until you unlock Windfury Totem which is a big boost to your groups melee damage output. (pvp is different, you will be using totems as tools such as earthbind to slow foes, grounding to block a spell, tremor to counter warlocks etc etc)
---
If you just want to purely play melee i recommend trying rogue or warr instead, shaman actually requires you to play as a hybrid and use your full range of spells to heal/support your team as needed (again pvp is different, you can just go full on lone wolf dps in battlegrounds when phase 3 comes)
---
Congratulations, you must feel very proud of this grand achievement. 3v1, very brave.
---
This is exactly why I didn't go PvP server. Because I knew there would be pussy ass neckbeards like this targeting a player and harassing them. Looks like Classic world PvP is even more toxic than private servers, and private servers were bad.
---
Europe does suck doesnt it
---
You think AoE is so simple compared to your standard rotation lol
---
how much exp do you get for exploring a capital city? also want to do this at 60
---
I actually thought the slow building of the Quillboar storyline was really really cool, one of my favorite narratives in the game. You got a lot of character from them as this group of pathetic, bitter angry bois being pushed out and driven to desperate measures (The alliance with the Scourge) because they're fighting a battle they can't hope to win against the combined power of the growing Horde.
---
It's a seriously awesome foil for the Horde that kind of holds a mirror up to them. The Quillboar are weak and losing ground, but they're no weaker than any one component member of the Horde. They're not facing extinction because they're particularly weak, they've just failed where the Horde has wildly succeeded in forging bonds with other races and putting petty disputes aside to secure a future for themselves and each other. And now they're trying to make up ground in that arena, by getting in bed with the worst partner possible because they've alienated everyone else with their backwards, warlike ways, in a rapidly changing Kalimdor where the dominance of the Horde shows that such a tribal, shortsighted lifestyle can't sustain itself anymore. The Horde represents progress in a new world dominated by more sophisticated geopolitical alliances, and the Quillboar show what happens when you choose to fight the future in the name of the past.
---
Basically the Quillboar are like the Tauren, or the Trolls, gone wrong. A cornered, desperate people on the ropes who lash out instead of reach out. The premise of the Horde is an unlikely crew of motley rejects who defy the impulses of nature to join hands instead of attempt to destroy each other. The quillboar are built up as the primary antagonists of the Horde in the early part of the game because they represent a perfect counterpoint to that philosophy: A group of prideful, spiteful isolationists that stick zealously to their old ways even though it's leading them down a path of destruction against an army they can't possibly hope to beat, because that army succeeded where the Quillboar are choosing to fail. They cling to the past and because of it they're going to get rolled over by the fearsome power of unity and friendship that the Horde represents.
---
God I fucking love the Horde. The whole premise of their storyline is just so, so good.
---
You are the ones who get raped in 1v1 world pvp then call the whole guild to mind control 1 low lvl character? U really deserve a /clap losers
---
I can’t justify paying that a month for one game. I’m not poor just logical 
---
Why pay 5x for the same thing just to go with all the hassle of setting up and dealing with this. 
---
Ps. You get gym for like 15 here
---
Thats really dark and I love it
---
That is only fitting
---
The Horde has no honor.

Try different chars and stick with the one you enjoy most

When I read Stat stick, my hunter senses are tingling. Can I use that mace to boost my Attacks peed of my gun?
---
It does
---
Has anybody tried this yet? I'd like to know too.  
---
If I abort the quest, put the rod in my bank, re-take the quest (providing me with another rod) and finish it, will the rod in my bank still be there?
---
I'm fine at understanding hyperboles unlike most people in this chain. I don't however understand your comment saying that I'd be jealous. Of what?
---
If you wanted a shit insult kind of reply why didn't you just go with "someone's on their period" or something? Why with me being jealous of someone admitting their life is so empty of meaning that killing someone in a game tops the list? And yes, it's all hyperbole, I know. But at least use something that would make sense given the context.

Agreed, and I went rogue knowing fully well that there's plenty of pure dps available. The thing that just gets under my skin is when the group refuses me because of my class yet they're still there looking 30-40mins later. And they don't even advertise themselves as xp farm groups, just a clear for quests etc.
---
Ashbringer is one of the most balanced servers on a faction basis according to this.
---
http://wowpop.appspot.com/realms/ashbringer/30
---
Desolace needs more love. Competing centaur tribes that you bounce affiliation with. Alliance outpost on the fringes. Demons, undead, naga, Burning Blade, goblin quests. Lead up to mauradon. 
---
A lot of things to do with a number of different races. Variety of quest lines. It gets a bad rap for how mundane it looks and feels, but the actual questing there I always found fun.
---
Because Mage is nowhere near as miserable as Shadow in PvE content. You have no burst damage, no AoE, CC is limited to undead, and most importantly unless you have a huge pile of runes and mana pots, you'll drink after every mob or play the wand game.     
---
You're not only subjecting yourself to that insanity, but also drastically slowing down your group.     
---
I was rank 13 in vanilla as shadow, but PvEing in this spec is a fucking joke.
---
2 skimming knives with life steal on a rogue. Speed boost to boots. 100hp to chest/head/legs with agm trinkets if you can get a high lvl to help. Super ez lvling from there to about mid 30s/40s when you can get SM weapons and also put life stealing/crusader on and still rampage from there on out.
---
Keep in mind that according to Blizz even current Low pop realms are higher pop than Vanilla High/Full (source needed, I'm too lazy to Google-fu, I need my Sunday morning coffee :) )
---
I've been in both worlds with both efficient and horrible aoe groups and the same in regular non aoe groups. 
---
If you have a good aoe group, you kinda never want to go back. It's not mindless, you have to pull alot, but very carefully, cause if you pull too much you wipe. It also requires some kiting depending on if you have a tank or not.
---
Regular groups pulling one pack at a time feels super slow and boring after being in a good aoe group. That said I've been in many runs without aoe that has been very pleasant, but that's more because of the players and our talks in between fights.
---
Then he must mean Tauren!

Use questie. It will show everything. Almost everything. Also, you can use youtube to do your quests if the quest stretches through other regions like Shaman's Call of Water quest(cancerous quest).

Classic and retail are all on the same account. Just get the authenticator its easy to use and you rarely have to enter it unless youre using a lot of different pcs.

You can left click on a target to.. target it instead for attacking it :)

---
yes
---
Take the top row for example, you don't need to see Holy and Flash Lights at all sice they don't have a cooldown and has as much range as your other support abilities. Even if you're low on mana, you're still spamming them, so it's not like there's a need to see them. At the very least you can combine all of the Holy Lights into a single macro. This is just a waste of space
---
worth 10g to disenchant! Nice! Get those mats man!
---
Wait.... people being adults and having real lives means a game failed?
---
What that bag addon?
---
Weeeeell I’m sorry to be that guy but these people who dungeonspam their first Classic character to 60 are very likely the same people who immediately finish all the content in every single retail expansion and then complain about the game having no content, until the next opportunity to skip and rush through all of the damn content again.
---
But you’re right man, gatekeeping sucks and of course you should enjoy the game however you like, but there’s SO MUCH to experience beyond running SM 47 times in a row.
---
I'd agree, even yet - having said warlock DoT the sucker then induce the victim with such intense fear that he will run amok wildly without any control over his body.. It's some dark shit alright.
---
Yep.  I enjoy battlegrounds, and even the occasional fair fight in the open world.  But shit like this and being chain killed while trying to turn in a quest is exactly why I rolled on a normal server.
---
I ain't got time for that shit.
---
Lol, I never thought about checking his flair. Interesting that the quest names are all the same though.

---
if you only buy the essential skills and vendor/AH responsibly you should easily be sitting on 90g by the time you hit 40.
---
Right, but people are picking Horde for PvP because of the strong racials on top of the easier access to most zones for leveling. Not saying that the alliance racials aren't good, but for PvP horde clearly have an advantage. Once the server pop comes out one way or the other, then the swapping starts happening but initial picks are usually down to those 2 things. Easier access to zones for leveling and stronger PvP racials. On a PvE server, I'd be willing to bet more are favored for Alliance or a closer 50/50 split.
---
best I can do, 33g
---
Oh yeah, I guess if you organize your spells like this it makes sense, I just throw all my attack spells on one bar, heal spells on the other, so there are some with or without CD and it wouldn't make sense for me to hide.
---
I get it's also just something that would take time getting used to.

Thanks.
---
I wouldn’t. You’re doing way less dps than a mage or warlock and you’re rolling for the exact same pieces as the priest breaking his back healing while you sit back with one dot, one shadow dps move, and a channel. 
---
It’s not fair and I never invite dps priests. Heal like the rest of us.
---
If you know what spells are and you know what cleave is then I have no idea how you couldn't figure it out.

What's the point though? At 55 you can already start farming BiS and xp doesn't really mean shit

---
Well, from my understanding the patch we play on have the changes that make it so for example every cat does the same effective DPS. BUT, there's still some differences in attackspeed. So, Brokentooth does the exact same damage as Bangalash, but in terms of PvP etc brokentooth is better at doing spell knockback on casters.
---
Same boat, kalimdor is a wasteland
---
I pretty much exclusively listened to System of A Down from 40-60 in vanilla, now when I hear that music all I think of is runnign around Un-Goro Crater on my mage doing quests

Yeah, I thought this was a joke. I'm kind of still convinced it must be. LFG is moving too fast to read on my server.

Yeah there are more than one build but those you mention are fucking terrible.

Mana spring totem rank 2 gives 6 mana every 2 seconds. The talent tree states it increases your mana spring totem effects by 15%. So.... (6 x 0.15) + 6 = 6.9..... clearly rounded up to 7. Seems to be fine to me bro.

I went shadow up until lvl 52 then I respeced holy. I was actually planning on maining shadow until I saw how useless I were in dungeons. I hoped it would be better at lvl 50, but it didn't. I don't care for playing a dps spec doing barley any more damage than tanks while going completely oom.
---
I do regret not continuing a little more with shadow though as now I basically strictly level in dungeons as questing in holy spec is awful compared to shadow.
---
"for the horde!" more like fuck the alliance
---
There was ICE HUD that did this... but I’m not sure if there is a classic version or not.
---
Daggers with fire enchant if you have a rogue.
---
Yo OP, good job fuck that guy, but jesus that mouseclicking. You straight up threw a grenade from your bag/inventory :p
---
Yep, you can but don't know if there is such a low level area where you can do that.
---
The closest areas with Horde-looking members would be Ashenvale but the quests for the logging camp aren't in the game yet. Actually, these's some orcs on the path down towards Wetlands, those could work. You'd need about lvl 20 though.
---
So true
---
I agree it is possible in many different situations. Maybe the healer is high lvl, maybe the tank, maybe he has nice gear/high armor from farming dungeons, maybe the pulls are small and far between. It depends really.
---
But if you wanna go fast and you dont vastly out-lvl the content you should have a shield imo.
---
u sure about that?

I'm pretty sure you get flagged when you enter an enemy starting zone as well, like Tirisfal Glades or Durotar, no?
---
And this is only the stuff outside of combat.
---
I wont say you cant use it but pls stop opening with earth shock.
---
can you hold the multi-shot for 5 seconds?
---
no frost nova doesn't stop you from gaining aggro.
---
As they said, it's your mana gained per 5 seconds. MP5 means your character will generate mana every 5 seconds if it's not being used for spellcasting (with the exception of some items and talents of course), which is why the 5 second rule exists. The Spirit stat ups how much mana is gained for each 5-second tick. 
---
Most Priests actually prioritize the spirit stat, and along with the Spirit Tap talent, can actually utilize this system to go through entire dungeons with little very little (or zero) stops to chug drinks. Of course Spirit Tap requires you to get the final hit to proc, though.
---
I always found it interesting that the tank is almost always the unofficial leader in a dungeon.
---
It kinda makes sense due to them setting the pace, but it's often assumed that they do things navigate and know all the encounters.
---
Yikes...That's pretty cringe. I'm so glad I gank grey Horde and get them to reroll.
---
This is low-key a great way to think about things. What is life, anyway? Anything we do is considered a 'waste of time', because time passes regardless of what you do/did/didn't do etc. Whether you spent 10 hours sleeping, 10 hours working, or 10 hours grinding gold. It's 10 hour dedicated to *something*.
---
And if you start quantifying and comparing all those *somethings* against each other, you will end up falling victim to time itself, which has no master. Just do whatever, live out your life. Maybe do other things after you respawn. Big deal.
---
How many tanks there are that chain pull when the healer has no mana... Tanks aren't all good.
---
Should've specified, hamstring on humanoids bc they run and if you switch stance to use intercept you lose most or all of your rage depending on spec.
---
Do low level quest (grey) give reputation ? Or is there a malus ?
---
But be warned that you'll get shit from the warrior or rogue the second their wf buff fades while doing dungeos.
---
"_ ran away in fear!"
---
Scooby doo cleave was my bread and butter.
---
Gold comes from people killing mobs, ultimately, so the longer the game goes, the more inflated the economy will be. If you wait, it will sell for more money. However, you might need that gold now, so it might be worth it to just sell it now
---
&gt;The epics after that is all a blur.....just like most girls after my two first;)
---
*what*
---
Balance is key.
---
You have to take your gear off to pickpocket without combat
---
Try writing "/console xpBarText 1" without the quotation marks in chat
---
I am going to keep this set for a very long time, just so I can afk around in it because of all the time it took me to get it. Classic is long and time consuming but it is worth it!
---
Others said the same, rekt noob
---
the hell does that have to do with retail...retal-itus lmfao plz lets be real here. bad players being bad thats all.
---
anyway if you were a priest healer you could of faded/feared (if possible) or shielded yourself so your heal doesnt get stopped or shield/renew to the tank. then flash yourself or him. dps could of helped too with mage nova/coc so many things could of been done.
---
A hunter can never attack his own pet.

So again: https://youtu.be/CUb8oOoU0Bk

You realize that Blizzard has every right to change their policies? And that they did just that around Cataclysm. Back then, you didn't get banned. Now, Blizz does ban you if you spend hours ganking lowbies from a place where guards can't reach you. That' how it is, you can go ahead and cry about it, but, well, practically anyone that isn't a worthless ganking asshole is glad they changed their stance on this.
---
He probay got invited to a party on another layer.
---
Yeah, it will. Once BG's are able to be ground there will be a much higher demand for it. A lot fewer people are stockpiling *anything* than you think are actually doing so.
---
Everything.
---
If we're talking super short term fights, I agree boar is probably the best contender for most threat because that charge opener is good out of the gate. However, if OP is spending long enough to apply multiple stings like he says, then it's likely not a super short duration fight, as those stings tick for a while.
---
Do I wait 10s before attacking with a cat? Of course not! Can I go balls-to-the-wall immediately after attacking with a boar? Of course not either lol. Don't get me wrong, I love the boar charge, but it seems like your grasping at straws here. Half of your statements were contradictory and most of them complaining about how they only spam claw; 90% of those statements are fixed by disabling or unlearning it.
---
That boar sure is sweet for grinding green/yellow mobs though, and allows you to just leave Cheetah on constantly cos the charge prevents you getting hit and dazed initially!
---
First thing I did in classic was disable the error speech
---
Honestly I consider mana management part of the skillset of a good healer.  Knowing when to cast, when to let the mp5 kick in, what abilities to use and how to use them to use the least mana possible while gaining as much as possible, including drinking tactically between pulls.
---
Train your weapon skill, I was confused by this as well lol. Your crit is only your max potential at max skill

Abusing pathing to avoid guards has always been bannable.

I love how you call me misinformed and appeal to logic.
---
How about you explain why server queues dropped 4-6k across several servers the very day they said they were increasing the amount of layers on each server?
---
How about you explain how layering fixes the issue of tourists it was specifically implemented to fix if it doesn't increase server population?
---
But to answer your question server caps is not a physical limit, it's one blizzard decided upon before vanilla originally released that blizzard decided to stick with for classic. By doing layering they can keep the appearance of that server cap while at the same time having huge populations without making it impossible to quest.
---
Haha yeah was starting to notice that now :)
---
I was killed multiple times by 5man horde parties in Alterac. And it wasn't just in the ruins of Alterac, they were actually looking for people to kill.
---
No hard feelings, just saying it's like this on both sides :)
---
Then it doesn't solve the issue it was created to solve, so what's the point?
---
Do low level quest (grey) give reputation ? If so, is there a malus ?
---
Is it ”too late” to start a guild? Gehennas has a huge amount of Swedish guilds, to the point where an English social one is hard to find. I plan on trying to make one myself, but I’m afraid a fresh one will be hard to get going now that a decent amount of guilds are already establishes.
---
Thanks in advance!
---
Dustwallow, desolace, swamps of sorrow. Unfortunately they're all a bit out of the way, but that's what ya got, there's Badlands too I suppose
---
That doesn't make it not slang.
---
Can do princess quest at thrall for BRD chain
---
Honestly I was in the same boat but theres some really good storytelling in MOP thats pretty self contained. Loved alot of the Loremaster Cho stuff.
---
People are tanking and clearing this phase as paladins.  It's not common but it is doable. Lots of consumes needed. But taunt and Mana aren't much of a problem. Fights aren't lasting long enough to go oom.  And  many bosses are taunt immune anyway. 
---
Private servers really didn't do them any favors but as it stands paladins are in an ok place this time around. 
---
Alot of their old issues where poor tanking talents in the early patched of the game where in 1.12 alot of changes where made to try and help.  
---
A warrior will often be better for your MT bit paladins can still OT and even MT in some situations
---
Well yeah. 1.12 is from 2006. Prepping for TBC
---
Typically when a less experienced healer is frequently oom flash heal spam is the culprit. Ive advised a number of priests to wait until 50-60% tank hp before doing heal + renew. Healing around the 5 second rule is key on a priest.  
---
Combat meters really help identify similar problems.  
---
PS: don’t PW:S warriors/druids before a pull. Rage gain is stunted and snap threat becomes an issue. (Source: Warrior)
---
Congrats!
---
I've got a question about the rarity of item highlight in your character tab, is that an addon or some interface option? The items doesnt glow in my inventory at all, thanks.
---
Once it dawned on me that playing on the faction that dominates is basically playing safe, I became grateful to be on the other side. I am Alliance on Herod. Being outnumbered makes the world dangerous like it supposed to be.
---
Nah.
---
This is the classic subreddit lol
---
Oh thanks so much
---
You mmmmiiiight need an addon for that. I use XpBarNone

I love you too!

Priests have levitate too right?
---
it's useful at max when you're horde with windfury and you've got more rage than you know what to do with.
---
Up to level 40, get high rage from a mob, then charge to the next, put up Rend, stack sunder armour to 5 and use Overpower on proc. All while keeping Battle and Demo shout up.
---
Turn off your sound or get another chest piece
---
This is the perfect visual of how flying ruined WoW.
---
Honestly I have enjoyed the rivalry as most of my WoW experience has come from Wrath to BfA. I saw the steady decline of faction pride and it was sad. But Classic is a whole new beast for me.
---
Lol didn't realize they was such thing ! Need to do that haha.
---
There's a chance trolls could in Dun Morogh but the skin color might be off
---
Loser.
---
Hmm if that's true then why does King B have a unique passive called Cobra Reflexes increasing his attack power, why not just let him have a set attack speed like every other mob in the mob in the game? (also cobra reflexes actually cost some of his Training Points, so if it really doesn't provide any benefit then hes actually the weakest cat in the game)
---
Awesome 😆

Hi, /u/doeda

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d7p1ul/the_amount_of_people_who_are_level_30_and_have_no/). 
---
Then you didn't do close to all the quests available from leveling. Doing everything at the recommended level takes you to ~ 12k/21k Darnassus, which leaves you with about 165 stacks of Runecloth turn ins.
---
all of the theory crafting and spreadsheets focused on warlock leveling, beta, watching other warlocks level and pull threat off their voidwalker.
---
it is actually amazing how bad voidwalker treat is.
---
It's been a while for me since I played a Pally, so forgive me if my memory fails. Ret aura gives extra damage as Holy to all party members where as sanctity is only useful to the paladin itself. Making Ret aura more favourable as it helps the whole party get more damage rather than just the pally.
---
1 - much easier to code the way they have it
---
2 - this make carebear feel safe
---
&gt; You're wasting an opportunity sitting on them
---
When they'll only go up in price that you can sell them? Lol
---
Eh, this is not something I would personally ever do, and I've been the victim of it a few times, but I still think banning people for this is a lot more lame than people doing it in the first place.
---
Yeah I have no problem with large guilds. Guilds advertising blatant lies though? Kinda sad. I'm sure if pressed they would be like "Just a prank bro" but come on.
---
Oh i didnt know ubrs was a pre 60 dungeon.
---
Its an addon. Idk which one OP has but i use deja character stats. It does this too and lets you see more detailed stats about your character

Twitch emotes.
---
Wow your worldview is dark. If you have something you want to protect write a prenup. Other than that, try to open your horizon, to live, to be happy.
---
Idk what a malus is, but if I recall right grey quests give either no reputation or an extremely high reduction %
---
Combat rogue is what you want to play.
---
This is also my first Wow playthrough. Theres plenty of rogue 1-60 overview guides on youtube that will make your life easier.
---
At lvl 35 currently im enjoying it, i do pretty damn good DPS
---
Congratulations mate!
---
I've managed to reach lvl 24 without cooking anything. I've just read about poisons and looks like I'm a bit fucked.
---
How do I learn it fast enough? I guess I'll have to go farm low level mobs that drop low-level meat first?
---
In my honest opinion i think the best healer that can also solo level without respeccing is shaman. Since they are a hybrid class their dps isn't too and their healing isn't too but with most specs you can always do decently with both....as a heal spec shaman the stats that you will use (int, spirit, etc) will still benifit elemental abilities....so without respeccing you can still do a few grinds and quest (tho not optimal)
---
This is my reasoning why I chose shaman....I know this isn't flawless logic but this is my opinion.
---
I gotchu fam. I was a mage in vanilla and have gone priest simply because the current meta annoys me. These dungeons were designed to be run suboptimal lol, if you cant beat it without spellcleave youve got other problems.
---
I was there. They just barely got into the keep. They tried to get to Ironforge through the Tram tunnels, but that's a big mistake, since in Classic, IF is where all the Alliance high lvls hang out.
---
I get that, which is why I was very skeptical lol. I didn't know how to check progress by server though, so thank you for that tidbit. Have an upvote.
---
It’s never over.
---
He doesn't even go so far as "Just a prank bro" he just ignores the challenges and keeps on going with the #1 nonsense.
---
Exactly why I was skeptical.
---
Ah, I use ExtendedCharacterStats, might reroll then, ty.
---
&gt; Either way, raids can't be layered
---
Anymore, they definitely could be for a while.
---
Very selfish way to see it.
---
Yes I was this staff that I will keep for few runs of this dungeon while the dude that would used the staff for half dozen levels can go suck an egg.
---
Uhh... you're really the type to defend this, aren't you? There's plenty of research out there for you if you lack the common sense. Not my responsibility to teach as it is for you to learn.
---
Is there a list somewhere for what each slot maxes out at?
---
I know.  I much prefer when someone in the party just keeps marking the next pack, and I, as a bear, can feel like the party’s big dumb mean pet.
---
Korgah killin' that sht
---
I tried finding myself in the pick, but I spent most of this raid ghost walking, so I get why I wouldn't be in it.
---
Funny
---
Who pulled that is goat name im my server.
---
Anyways take care of yourself and be careful.
---
Oh man I wish. This was on the Judgement-EU realm. It's incredibly dead. There's rarely a 60 dungeon running and there's not enough players around to do two UBRS runs at the same time. I've had 100 Thorium Bars listed for the lowest price on the AH the last 24 hours and not a single one has sold. I'm still the lowest listing. 
---
Yeah. This is sad.
---
Tonnes of mages and quite a few warlocks too.
---
Not including druid, paladin would probably be the least played.
---
no you dont ;-)
---
Why comment if you are clueless? Limited supply items were never affected by layers
---
Succubhs is sooo much better for leveling lol
---
how big would a scale map have to be if we defined say, pluto as 1 pixel.
---
I sense weakness
---
It damages anyone that strikes the party member with Ret aura. If the Pala is alone as a retri build, Sanctity is better for him, but otherwise Ret aura does more damage in a party setting, as it damages all targets that say strike the tank.
---
This calls for war*craft*! Gnome sayin'?
---
I was honestly trying to figure out if OP somehow took the picture upside down
---
Man the hunter memes are so much stronger than I imagined. Yes hunters sometimes roll on str weapons at level 30 and yes, sometimes forget to turn off growl.
---
However, when you ask me to jump off a cliff to skip trash and I explain my pets gonna pull them running through. Please don't get mad when exactly that happens.
---
While I agree somwhat,"The difference between a king and a pretender is a king doesn't have to tell his subjects he is a king", credentials and expertise are good for recruiting.
---
Okiedokelie, thank you kindly. Also I'm leveling as a frost mage on Winseeker If anyone wants to be my friend! :)
---
You can get the early levels of cooking pretty hecking fast if you pair it with fishing.  
---
https://www.wow-professions.com/classic/fishing-and-cooking-leveling-guide-classic-wow
---
I’m still holding out for a phone version of classic. If you look at the game order and chaos on the App Store it is achievable, but only if your spell rotation is about three spells.
---
can't say i had that issue after using a succubus from 20-60.
---
succubus is alright but I prefer fear juggiling with imps, felhunter is garbage for levelling tho.
---
I have never heard about cooking being required for poisons, are you sure you need cooking?
---
Buffing people also generates threat, so Battle Shout is also good for aggro as long as your whole party is in range.

I am thanks , gl bitching about everything

I remember vaguely about weapon speeds above a certain number (for slow weapons) were "normalized". As in 3.60 is actually 3.30 but displayed as 3.60 anyway. Is this true? Does anyone know anything about this? 
---
And how fast is too fast for a leveling ret paladin?
---
Lol shaman.

is ok bb ily

Lol this is evil

Moderate a horde-only cirklejerk of low effort memes, zero informational value and repetitive dick-wagging dressed up as content...for free?

No thank you.

I mean, that super engaging chat though!
---
Only use heroic strike when you have excess rage to dump. Otherwise don't use it.
---
Are you seriously that dense to not realize lvl 60s would just camp starter zones all day?
---
scout is a pvp title
---
Is using a dagger and an offhand a bad idea for a lock? Im guessing staff and wand are my best options.
---
When I played a shaman I found everything exciting and fun except totems. I wished they didn’t have then and had something else. Just personal preference.
---
Pssh that’s only in the future
---
If you kill a mob while they have it tagged out of partt they get EXP based on the % of the health they did in damage.  I believe this is only if the level gap is extremely high though.
---
Most people aren't doing multiple runs.

Not really, he's giving people a chance that don't fit in the air farming meta. He's a saint.
---
As another rogue youre... wrong. Like 100% wrong. When i am doing dungeons a locked chest is the same as a normal chest. I could see maybe arguing that the rogue could roll out of like 110 or something, but just straight up taking the chest? Lmao no. Just no x1000

That's not what normalisation means. For instant attacks (such as Sinister Strike or Mortal Strike), weapons slower than 1.7/3.3 (depending on weapon type) will gain less of a benefit of attack power, while weapons faster than 1.7/3.3 will gain more of a benefit of attack power. It doesn't make the weapon swing faster.
---
Think ill just go resto at 60
---
All these alliance players complaining, if this shit was the other way around alliance players would be fine with it and then horde players would complain. It's some stupid bullshit and hypocritical. In the end who cares if it's alliance or horde it's funny nonetheless

This is an evil joke right

actually, super easy, barely an inconvenience.

Wont be up where others are in a week, bit might be there where they are now in a few weeks :) if you habe the passion it can work

Nice! Will be excited to check this out later. Thanks for sharing!
---
Its a little bit off topic but for the first time in my wow time I play hunter and holy shit I love this class! It‘s so much fun to have a little owl friend by your side and leveling is super easy. Perfect for my limited time
---
The tank.
---
nope 28. i'm just well aware of the fact that anyone below lvl 60 thinking priest dps is worth playing is bad and im not going to intentionally invite bad players to my groups. there is plenty of other groups out there lol go cry to them.
---
That's kinda sad and not a smart move. Either new recruits accept what he says at face value and will likely find themselves disappointed later, or they didn't even care about his claims in the first place and in that case, why even make them? It just gains his guild some infamy for no reason.
---
Also. Mankrikks wife 😭😭😭
---
who hurt you?
---
that is your opinion, the fact is that ravager is best for aoeing down mobs as a hunter, volley is dogshit for that and you want to run in put down explo trap anyway. Hunters are better at proccing ravager than enh shamans, paladins and even warriors if they dont have rage to spam hamstring
---
Pussy.
---
Scout is the first pvp title horde gets.
---
I managed to snag two of these as a Shadow Priest (it's not unique), one for 50g and the other for 35g.
---
Some guildies say it wasn't worth it, but I'm quite pleased with the purchase. I won't be raiding much, if at all, and will be doing plenty of PvP when it's in, so the spell power + stamina is nice. Good caster rings are hard to find in the early phases.
---
In stats, it's almost identical to the WSG Honored ring, which is a Level 58 blue.

Farming alt or carry farm runs with a tank duo.

You should try the Bael'Dun digsite in Mulgore.

Heard about this while in IF. Someone posted "they're on the way to IF on the tram."  Never saw anyone though - presume that they ran into the traditional higher level pop of IF
---
Hello HSC english

I love classic and all that and I absolutely hate retail but wtf is "go back to retail' for an insult? I hate classic gameplay compared to retail and it's so easy it's dumb. And look at mc and ony and even bwl.
---
&gt; in their level range
---
not that I agree with him
---
Classic damage and health values are 100% consistent with 1.12 - proven by both the community and Blizzard.
---
I guess the bigger problem here is that the community is now realising that a lot of Vanilla’s difficulty only existed in patches pre-1.12.
---
We didn’t get a nerfed version of Vanilla, but we *did* get the easiest version that existed. Kind of a tough situation since while those earlier patches were tougher, they also had some pants-on-head retarded stuff going on.
---
I was bothered by the dialogue in season 1, does it get any better in season 2? Hearing "fuck" every couple lines got tiresome real fast. I hope they at least throw in some other swears.
---
I was going to do this, I even got offered but I declined. I was more worried about getting banned. I remember back in the day TBC that a few got banned for tagging mobs.
---
You just never know about blizzard
---
60. Later even.
---
typical trash alliance player crying about some stupid shit no one cares about. play a meta class or deal with the fact that no one wants to play with you. you don't get to have your cake and eat it too.
---
Agreed, but the guy is actually a pretty decent and nice guy. That guild does have pretty good people, so while I don't agree with the recruitment technique he did do a good job getting quality people.
---
when did blizzard patch in the ability to drink in the middle of pulls?
---
I mean I know they're twitch emotes, I just don't know where lulw comes from.  I guess it's because I watch twitch and don't use chat much, but I don't understand why anyone would type OMEGALUL outside of twitch instead of just lol.  At least lol and rofl were shorter and felt less awkward than "hahaha" and "*laughs*" when they became popular.  
---
I also don't really get why anyone who talks about this sort of thing gets a bunch of hate every time.  People are really strange when it comes to speaking about internet culture.

I just bought 5/6 of the set for 14g all together...

Sure it’ll take a day or two to get back, but it really pulled me out of a rut at lvl 35.

This is how I felt with the Fordrings in WPL, getting the bis healer ring.

As a Druid, I could stealth and watch the carnage from the shadows, while the hordies farming Crusader enchants passed by and wondered who triggered the quest and left.
---
Id kick anybody needing offspec over other people mainspec anytime
---
It can work *if* the dps let you get aggro first. Charge in and pop sweeping strikes. Swap to zerker and pop zerker rage, then whirlwind. WW procs SS so you end up with a huge chunk of threat going out all at once. Start rage dumping with cleave and whirlwind until everything is dead.

thank you! I’m new to WoW with the relaunch of Classic so I’m trying to find my way through everything.
---
There's plenty of people to go around though. If I put the 20% absolute mongoloids I come across on my server on ignore, there's still 80% of the server left that I can interact with.
---
I used the word that came to mind, since I didn't understand what I was told in january well before classic was released.
---
My question now though is simply do I just never use a weapon that is  less than 3.3?
---
I wanted to dabble in some aoe groups on my mage, is there any faq or videos that show the strategy in SM?
---
Rogues: After applying a poison to a weapon is it possible to remove it? Example being I applied poison before realising there was a Shaman in the group and so I gimped myself for proccing Windfury. (Right clicking didn’t work)
---
Go back to your buildings made of mud and shit livestock.
---
Should I buy the game even if I have never played it ?
---
Freest 1 silver of your life
---
Want to know that as well
---
Well since you didn’t put any classes in. The entire group is at fault. Healer needs to wait for tank to get aoe threat or will pull mobs off, in this event if you are a priest you have fade, if on cd fear as a last resort.
---
If Druid root it, Paladin stun it(should also be by the tank anyway in most dungeons) or bubble if need be. Shaman has slows and roots.
---
If it’s a warrior tank and your a priest and you shielded him at the start of the pull entirely your fault. They already have poor snap threat and pain is rage for them which shield negates.
---
Can’t be a paladin as consecration is a threat whore.
---
If it’s a Druid tank on an aoe pack a they should have hots up for threat.
---

I made a bit of g making iron grenades. 
---
Mats cost was like 7-8s on my server and the average u get is over 14s from the craft.
---
Honestly going with 1.12 was the lesser evil. Give the most feature complete version of classic with as many of the more *questionable* design choices tended to. No matter which route they take for classic going forward I hope they at least bring us up to TBC. TBC was a more refined version of classic while still retaining the classic design philosophy.

What's heal bot?

I'm only level 19, playing as a holy priest and I just do dungeons and watch Netflix. I don't really pay any attention lol

What I want to know is what kind of mental gymnastics you had to go thru to not think 10 minutes is a handicap. I’ve run some dungeons 20x + to get gear for myself and friends 20x10 = over three hours total — and 10 minutes is an EXTREMELY generous time guesstimate to say the least. A group with sub 60s could easily make a difference of an hour depending on gear, not to mention how some bosses you basically need to be 60 to do with ease (looking at you balthazaar and rivendare)

Why the fuck is the XP bar so close to the center of the screen? This UI is disgusting and you should be ashamed.

That's up to you, noone here can tell you if you'll like it or not. But if you're worried about being new, worry not, that are plenty of people playing that never played WoW before.
---
on the flipside, being impatient often ends up wasting more time than it saves. Yes, you can keep drinking while they fight and only get up when heals are \*needed\*, but if that occurs early, or the pull goes bad or somebody pulls more than needed or whatever, you suddenly do not have the spare mana to deal with it and you wipe.  
---
and wipes waste far more time than just drinking for a bit after engages. and if you have a friendly neighbourhood mage, you can afford to just tap your drink for 5-10 seconds to keep filling up when you got a moment, as you arent wasting multiple golds on drinks and feel the need to drink the whole thing.  
---
you really need to know your group to play on the edge like this. with randoms, far better to just play it safe.
---
The duskwood quests are amazing. Stalvan, Mor'Ladim, Jitters' journal. I also enjoy Solomon's courier quests that have you running around asking everybody for help. I like the chain after stockades with the gnome and his robot, and I liked the Missing Diplomat, though the ending is a bit disappointing.
---
Flamelash! We need more Hordes to slain!
---
I had this same issue with every nameplate add-on I tried except NeatPlates. No idea why.
---
do say what class you play
---
Do you mean 60% horde at least, or 40% Alliance at least?
---
Camo and Imp Ambush
---
By dps upgrade you mean more agi/str. Or you hit people with your daggers as a hunter?
---
People not even realizing how dumb what they say is, take an example from this guy.
---
How is Heartseeker? Seeing more and more people vanish off my friends list every day and people left on Stalagg are talking about making the jump. I would hate to do it because Stalagg is in a bad spiral but I have been seriously impaired gaining xp. I can’t imagine what farming raid mats is going to be like.
---
That really is unnecessary unless doing some weird skip
---
In  the case of Antu'sul, the adds are not cc-able.
---
Nah man, lifetapping down to 5% as a warlock then walking up to mobs with cleave. That warlock had a deathwish all along. Bit sad WoW rarely makes use of insta-death when players fail at mechanics. Which would otherwise highlight the tards.
---
As I understood them, server scanning addons were not limited to a single layer. Presumably the 15k is server-wide.
---
You know you can just dismiss the per before jumping down right?
---
Nope I play classic. I’m just some dumbass sheep like so many people that had to play on a full server.
---
“Hunter your pet god dammit” 
---
As a level 60 hunter this hits the hardest. I swear the pets in classic just have a mind of their own.
---
every time horde are outside the instance waiting to kill you
---
felhunter isnt that bad  for spell lock if in a heavy caster area + being able to dispel shit off yourself is g r e a t. actually a life saver in strat if you have a druid healer and non paladin tank.
---
it has slightly higher mana regen than a succubus, but the auto attack is a bit less.
---
i was so damn happy to get rid of an imp at level 20. succubus auto attack does more damage than an imp firebolt and cost no mana and lash of pain isn't that hard on mana with a 12s cd.
---
The thing is, we killed the boss and just the tank and I died.  Admittedly, I got a little pissed off when the mage was informing me of my spell called "reincarnated."  I shouldn't have taken in so personally, but this dude was just being very condescending.
---
Though they just want Mobile-Games? Wasn't that the reason why Diablo on Mobile was announced?
---
U dont need to spec healer till raid phass, leveling as shadow is faster and u can do heals in dungeon without any problem.
---
Clearly superior horde
---
I mean dismiss pet is a thing.
---
Same lol, feel like I play way too much and only level 38.
---
Another classic example of the Alliance losing a 1v1 and having to call for backup.
---
I'd probably cone of cold it or something to grab aggro as a mage.
---
I get it as at least 60/40 horde/ally, that is the more unbalanced the better (in favor of his faction ofc).

Tbh healbot is an overcomplicated healing mod, but it stacks the group/raids healthbars all next to eachother with visual cues for debuffs, dots, incoming damage, buffs and the like. Lets you keybind just for when you click on those health bars like Shift+RMB for Renew or CTRL+SHIFT+MMB for Shield. 
---
Its pretty easymode.
---
Ty I will buy it tomorrow :)
---
I really like this gnomes name. Dreadlocks is just hilarious and clever honestly, he knows how to name a character
---
I'm a shaman.  I think I did mistime the heal a bit.  But then this mage just went off on me, being quite condescending.  I got a bit defensive, well, more than a bit defensive.  I agree with you, I should have not added to the argument.  It's not worth it.

Yeah I will buy the monthly sub  :)

Yeah. It's not feasible to respec every time you run a dungeon - the usual pattern is to level with one spec and then repsec for raids.

I've never played on pservers, so I wouldn't know what you did there.
---
I followed them on the train, but they got fewer and fewer. Either they ported or layering kicked in.
---
Mana regen items are simply useless with warrior and rogue.
---
Good god no, that would be terrible.
---
Ig my god and a very good one at that. This is VERY VERY expensive in AH if i remember correctly
---
One day you'll get it

Didn't you know the Mercator projection style of map is different than how it actually looks on the globe?
---
Hillsbrad was extremely bad my 2nd time going through.  There was a level 60 alliance rogue named Jòhn.  Was using some addon that sounded like some borderline cheat shit.  Would alert him anytime an enemy (non-NPC) around him would do an action nearby, and tell him the class and an approximate level.  It was like a radar for enemy players.
---
I know this because he told us plainly, with the alt spy he had standing on the mail box in Tarren Mill named "Johnspy".  The same alt spy he used to spy on our general chat so anytime we directed some of our own level 60's to go kill this dude who was griefing and camping people half his level, he'd simply see the callout in general chat on his alt, and move his main somewhere else to grief.
---
Let's just say what quests should haven taken 2 hours, took 5-6 hours because of this asshat.
---
&gt; and then the first raid tier we actually just have to fight some far less significant person, like...idk, Garithos comes back. 
---
garrosh becomes a bad guy earlier than cata/MoP you mean(and is still underwhelming)
---
&gt; We would have gotten Icecrown Citadel, except Arthas gets killed by Vaneesa VanCleef (still a child) in a side quest. 
---
no has to be someone who is significant but has nothing to do with Arthas story.
---
should also be well loved. i'm guessing the best comparison would be more green jesus out of nowhere just ending him with no build up.
---
The story? Doesn't the game start at level 100 there?
---
Playing dual wield warrior, or warrior in general, is a bit like the barbarian from the Diablo franchise.  You smash, slash, and bash.
---
Combat rogue also has a good spot in raids, and they’re a little easier to level up than a warrior; especially if this is your first toon in classic.
---
Sorry, I guess that was a bit misleading.
---
I've read that the quest that unlocks poisons also gives rogues the recipe for thistle tea, which needs cooking leveled to 60.
---
Is there any news on how the battlegrounds launch is going to be? Are they going to have cross realm and battle master que with it?
---
Yes, because repeatedly getting one shotted by a group of horde 10 levels higher than you is fun. Also repair costs.
---
imagine tanking lmao  
---
have fun running around like headless chicken trying to grab aggro with no rage :^)
---
A certified hood classic too.
---
I’ll add him to my KOS list &lt;3
---
If I was a healer I'd do the same.  But since I'm not a healer I'd be left with nothing else other than to kick the asshole.
---
Congrats!  That shield is pretty incredible.
---
most causal players in China are still playing the censored version game, only some few know this simple hack

He obviously didn’t think much of him. This happens a lot.

You know it's a PVE server.
---
You don't want that either, you think you do.  But you don't.
---
Hey guys Hobbs here today we're in Scarlet Monastary.
---
Yeah those three islands from BFA and Legion are totally to scale.
---
Can't believe this shit didn't get taken down.
---
You can also spam hamstring to fish for dodges to proc overpower, or use it to proc windfury when you’re other skills are on CD
---
I like that outlook :)
---
not necessarily, a elemental mage can also be built to be more frost damage heavy, it just depends on what you want to do.

Ok so this is a very different kind of question. 
---
So I want to learn Spanish. I do have several years of formal education but I’m far from fluent. Are there any wow realms (I can access because I’m in NA) where I can literally throw myself into the world of Warcraft and have to force myself to learn? Hoping for good advice thank you. I’m also very open to other suggestions.
---
Says the guy who didn't get it...
---
Based on the criteria you have it sounds like a warrior might be a good fit. 
---
1. You have to roles in dungeons covered and will be highly sought after in both dungeons and raids. 
---
2. Other players might be able to give more input on this point but from what I know a well geared warrior can absolutely shred in PvP and are far from helpless.
---
3. So this is probably the biggest drawback to a warrior but they are painfully slow to level. However seeing as this will be your second character, maybe the change of pace will be nice for you if you want to take a break from your Shaman and try and work on something else for bit. Think of it as a "project" alt if you will, one that should definitley be worth the investment.
---
I don't want it SUPER unbalanced, just your standard unbalanced. lol
---
Only when there's a hunter in the group pulling and taunting every thing. But I don't group with hunters so not a problem lol
---
The game literally went to shit in retail because because people like you wanted to go against the grain.  Playing on PVP servers and crying about PVP is just one example.
---
If you're going to play on a PVP server, actually PVP.  Faction warfare IS part of the game design.  It's not the way I want you to play.  It's the way Blizzard designed the game.
---
Gatekeeping is just a buzzword you soft shelled pussies created to cry.  Grow the fuck up.
---
It's getting a mixed response. Haha. I can see both sides to be honest. Used to prefer quicker deaths, no less satisfying.
---
This does take dedication.
---
Fuck weapons. Use your fists like a real warrior.
---
Shockingly accurate.
---
Spamming arcane explosion and cone of cold is even more dps.
---
It refers to a group of casters using AOE to clear the dungeon instead of the typical tank/3DPS/healer format. That is its meaning. It literally has a meaning.
---
People are so salty about not getting in spellcleave groups they're actually taking it out on the *word* lmao. This is the weirdest shit I've ever seen.
---
Yes and yes
---
&gt; Witch hunts are unhealthy and can actually be dangerous.
---
The guy I responded to wasn't witch hunting anyone.

---
i am going to guess the rogue in the picture had something to do with cc to stop the lock from reapplying
---
It has a chance to be dodged and costs less rage than sunder armor. Basically just another tool to try and proc overpower,
---
When it comes to online advice, people tend to over-exaggerate - so I was hoping for some moderate advice. I am enjoying my time as a Fire Mage a lot, but I've heard that some raids like Molton Core cannot be played as Fire Spec due to fire resistance. Is it true that it's simply not viable
---
He could do that without being an ass.
---
yeah i respecd disc right around 48 so i could heal dungeons and get pre-raid BiS gear instead of questing. of course i still have some key talents like spirit tap for soloing but essentially i made a build that would do well in world pvp, dungeons, and solo questing.
---

Yeah, it was the later adds, with 6k hp elites.
---
I had a Warrior need 3 swords in a row in SFK. Like, fucking hell dude, I want my disenchant fodder, stop needing....
---
In classic what does druid naturally lend itself to?
---
Yeah, but none are on average, quite as shit as Hunters.  They're called Huntards for a reason.
---
1. For horde you are left with warrior (dps/tank), druid(dps/tank/heals), or priest(dps/heals). While you can dps with all three classes and tank with druid the chances are that you will be stuck with a different role. Warrior - tank, druid - heals generally, and priest - heals. At the end of the day your first criteria definitely limits your choices. I would personally either roll a dps class or a tank class since shammys usually heal in raids.
---
Your dps was the problem here. The healer shouldn’t be getting hit period.
---
Limited supply items are not affected by layers, it just resupplied at that exact time
---
Hamstring a mob, as you do you auto it. Amost every mob will have aprox 2x the swing speed as you if you’re using a proper slow weapon. Anyways you can manipulate yourself out of their hitbox and weave in and out when your swings are ready to drastically lower your downtime.
---
Leeway makes this extremely annoying in practice though.
---
Warriors can break sap with zerker rage. Surprised this worked.
---
I think it's a good mix up.
---
You have Horde territory, and you have Alliance territory, and then you have simply contested areas.
---
Horde can't initiate in Alliance zones, giving Alliance the advantage.
---
Allicance can't initiate in Horde zones, giving Horde the advantage.
---
Contested zones anyone can initiate.
---
I think it's good to have a mix of areas, where you can feel safe, or where you are always in danger.
---
You should able to, it is never bad tell your dungeon group in advance. As a warrior tank, I sometimes roll on daggers, it almost never an issue to ask
---
Why would you want to dispel it?
---
I saw a guy in trade chat selling water so I stood next to him giving away free, better water for an hour. Mages are already inviting a lot of scorn from the Classic community because there are tonnes of us and aoe farming is obnoxious.
---
So you're saying I was just lucky that the moment I got transferred layer the recipe just happened to respawn?
---
Back in vanilla, I used throwing weapons as a warrior. Still think it's the best for ranged pulls.
---
If you’re healing the dungeon, far as I’m concerned you’re entitled to cloth healing gear 👍
---
Rerolls?
---
this is why i roll with a consecration paladin as my tank. he can hold AoE aggro. warrior can't do that.
---
There's an advantage in being outnumbered when Battle Grounds get introduced (if you're into this) the other faction will have to wait for YOU to queue in order to play BGs. So, no queues for the underdogs which is fun and when BGs start world pvp kind of calms down.
---
Get gud shity warrior
---
Yes. It wasn’t even the same recipe I don’t know why you are shocked
---
Just look up a pre raid bis list and roll on that. You don’t wanna be the guy rolling on pieces that are an upgrade for you but actual pre-raid BiS for others.
---
That my guild, we’ve been laughing about it. Can’t believe it got so many upvotes and comments though. Seriously funny. 
---
Dread is famous now. A rising star.
---
Any players, ESPECIALLY GNOMES, and other little people of course, that would like to join &lt;Devilish Intentions&gt; on the Golemagg server, throw me (Ishmalara - Priest Class Leader for DI) a /whisper and I’ll invite you along.
---
May I ask whar bag add on that is, I love the separate headings helps my ocd so had!
---
Yes, its fine but bust lead your party know before the dungeon starts.
---
My point exactly.
---
You sound to be the rare exception.  Doing early dungeons (pre-40) with Hunters, it's like they're all of the like mind "I melee, range, and wear leather, therefore I am entitled to need all melee, range, and leather".
---
Maybe they asked for a mage cause of food/int buff. Its not always about pure dps
---
Ah I see, thank you for that. Then yeah, I'd just go with retri to be honest as Sanctity will be near useless in groups.
---
When?
---
Cleared Naxx as a holy paladin by using downranked flash of lights the whole way through. Holy light was only needed if the tank was getting spike damage annihilated by the bosses... rarely happens once they’re sufficiently geared up.
---
5 hours? Pffft... Rookie numbers. I've been camping Broken Tooth almost for a day /played. It has succesfully been tamed 3 times in front of my grey, dead body.
---
Anyone know the addon that makes all green blue and purple colored items in iventory have colored margins?
---
Being mean to po' lil gnome. Come on now, this IS MEAN xD
---
THEY'RE COMING OUT OF THE WALLS!
---
I know this is fake but 10/10 none the less
---
There are a lot of mobs and bosses with high fire resistance if not outright immunity, so you'd be gimping yourself quite severely.
---
Shift click their name.
---
Wtf is this weeb shit?
---
I would love to see an alternate history. The thing that I enjoy with Classic is that is challenging, rewarding and social. If they keep this core gameplay intact and serve it with a new timeline for us to discover, I would be all-in.

You can. Blizz made it a feature in classic.
---
Ctrl-s
---
You sound like a hunter. Some weird aggression thinking they should taunt. Bizarre.
---
I'm okay with all hybrids but a ret-pally is a waste of spot in any raid. The only time you'd invite one is because they are your friend or something and they want to enjoy being ret and the content is easy (which it is).
---
Shadow Priests are normal in an raiding guild (one shadow priest) I can't remember why one is allowed. Feral Druids are "okay" and Protection Paladin is not bad in 5 mans but once you hit 60 and start raiding; switch to Holy.
---
Holy Paladins are SO good in raids the other builds just CANNOT compare to how much they add to the table in terms of NECESSARY buffs, EXCELLENT healing capabilities and Blessing of Salvation which the Hordes envy us for.
---
Fun fact, Bucklers in game are a remnants of Alpha/Beta in which there was Shields and Bucklers, of which I think rogues and hunters could equip the bucklers. But by launch the made them all shields and gave them the same type of stats
---
Is there a way to set it up so I can click my frames and still move my camera?  Like click thru frames or whatever?  I have zperl and can’t get it to work if that helps
---
Ah ok. I am not sure of the exact levels but yeah that's right. 60 should be really easy though.
---
Why do you waste your time on things like this? What do you get out of it?
---
dont know about players doing mindcontrol but thats not true, i just farmed like 20 felcloth in felwood and sometimes the tricksters mindcontrol you, i killed my own pet twice today due to this.
---
You should try... uhh, videogames... i mean, with that logic in mind. The thing about drugs is, they're not just bad for wasting someone's time.

All of the dragons in BWL are immune to fire, so that’s half of them. 
---
Geddon, Golemagg, and Rag are also immune to fire in MC. Lots of trash is also immune to fire. 
---
You can be fire when it’s on farm, considering that MC is easy.. but you won’t be able to use fire spells for lots of it.
---
huh
---
You cant use fire magic on fire elementals, theycare immune.

And not only that, but lets be honest, the extra top end and not to mention weapon dps is going to help out a warrior (or any physical dealing character except druids) WAY more than lets say 4-12stamina, 4-12 spirit and 4-12 intellect is going to help out a caster.
---
Casters just scale with level and ranks of spell naturally, whilst melee phys dealers need better weapons. What does it help to get a new heroic strike rank if you're already hitting like a wet noodle?
---
They are talking about the movies
---
So it’s basically good old fashion brown nosing?
---
The only reason to keep a gnome alive is so you can kill him later.
---
Story: I fought 3 mobs to get to a chest, and started looting it. A warrior just ran up to me the same time I was gonna loot it and told me to "die".
---
thats exactly what my dungeon groups are gonna be sayin
---
This is the full explanation of why dungeons became loot hallways in the burning crusade.
---
I really don’t get your point. You roll for what is an upgrade at that point, nobody is passing on drops because there exists a better weapon you might be able to get elsewhere. Of course you’re not rolling on Emberstone Staff if you have Smite’s Hammer, but of course you are rolling on Emberstone Staff if you only have a 14DPS weapon (unless you are dumb). Sure, the warrior doesn’t use the intellect, but then the mage is not using the high damage of the weapon which is a much higher waste.
---
Hunters get aggressive when anyone brings up not taunting with their pets.
---
Yea girls are humans. Thank god for that. Otherwise I think I would have been in trouble;)
---
I played all of retail and just noticed this option when starting classic. Changed my life
---
Unpopular? Then I am unpopular, too. I beg tanks to pull until my mana bar cries, and I assure them I will speak up if I need a mana break. A good tank will start pulling when my mana bar is about 75-80% full.
---
The only downside is that this makes for some spicy pulls if we get a patrol or aggro or whtever. Zero margin for error.
---
&gt; questing in retail was dull and monotonous.
---
Definitely, and the pain of getting ganked adds to the spice of the game and makes it more interesting, keeps you sharp, etc.  It makes for a different experience and I admit walking into Stranglethorn Vale on a PvE server feels different but since I've decided I just don't want to gank other people, it feels stupid to play a game where I'm just an easy target for assholes who have more time than me to play to be able to pick on.  I'm not saying choosing a pvp server is an invalid choice, I'm just explaining why it's the wrong choice for me.
---
/u/title2imagebot
---
As much as I hate to admit it, this is my story as well. I okay 3-4 hours an evening after work and then no-life it on weekends. So.. How much time does this leave for me and my wife? Well, I said, she plays the game, so that's okay right? If we're leveling together, that's quality time, right?
---
Wrong. Time spent physically together is totally different than online together. So when i went to have sex, she kinda felt like a stranger and it made me nervous. And when I get nervous...
---
Being Alliance on a PvP server just means you better level with someone..all the fucking time.
---
Personally I find holy light better while leveling as I can do a big heal then go melee the mobs a bit while getting some spirit regen. FoL while more efficient means you are casting far more often.
---
Fuck that give his exact name and server. Racist idiots deserve to be shunned.
---
Will try. Thanks !
---
There are addons (Necrosis for example) that can delete shards automatically and allow you to set a certain number of shards to keep. There are macros that can do the same thing too.
---
hahahahaha best gameplay video I've seen on this subreddit
---
Amazing nobody mentions Eastern Plaguelands! The Darrowshire questline is probably the most sad and touching questline in the game.
---
I usually tell the tanks in my dungeon runs that growl will be on for their benefit.  In most of the groups I have been in, the tanks have REAL difficulty holding aggro, so my pet is acting as an off tank.  Works way better then having it off and watching the mobs ping pong from one party member to another.  Haven't seen any tanks argue against it.
---
Lmao “dopeheads”.
---
I never thought of it that way, but very true! Great way of thinking about it. Appreciate it!
---
You’re right about that one lol
---
The pserver bit is just cause I didn't play back in vanilla. I didn't follow any pserver meta, it was an approach I made up cause it seemed the best.
---
I had a similar thing happen to me yesterday.
---
I had the map assembled and went to the location of the flag but when I got there I saw 4 mobs around it and the chest, and no way to interact with the flag. I also saw no corpse around so I assumed whoever was trying to do the quest must've given up or spirit res'd so I thought I'd try to clear out the mobs in order to try and summon them myself. I killed all of them but to my surprise when I looted them one of them gave me the key which also set the quest requirement as (Complete) so I tried opening the chest and after it opened it popped the quest complete message but I couldn't click on the complete quest button nor did I get any loot from the chest. 
---
After a second the chest closed and disappeared and I was stuck with the key in my inventory and no way to interact with the flag, same as you. Couldn't even discard the key as it auto-removes the quest so the only way to maybe get it to work is ask a GM to remove the key for you and try to interact with the flag again, otherwise you have to go and get the 3 map parts again.
---
I fail to see how this would be bannable. They're not using any exploits, only coordinating with class skills to push the limits of xp gain. All of this was possible in classic, people just weren't aware and coordinated.
---
I guess because it takes quite some time to conjure enough if you just got the ability level.
---
Still dumb to try to charge for it in a group, tho.
---
Put it away in your Bank and check once in a while. Worth waiting.
---
That's such a dated slur too. Is he over 40?
---
Well geared hunters can do well. Also rogues, warriors and priests.
---
&gt;Its a mind control, dumbass. The other two were just an audience.
---
Someone later claimed to be in the group and said:
---
&gt;The approximate chain of controls was:
---
&gt;Charge, Concussive Blow
---
&gt;Mind Control
---
&gt;Sap
---
&gt;Intimidating Shout
---
&gt;Mind Control (into underwater frost trap)
---
&gt;Frost Trap procs
---
&gt;Second Frost Trap 
---
&gt;&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt;And then he died. Best day ever.
---
So, saying the other two were just an audience....... This must be a Rocky Horror Picture Show audience for all the participating they're doing.
---
I'm a hunter and when I did BFD someone told me I was literally the best hunter they've ever played with because I dismissed my pet before jumping in the water.
---
A paladin is harassing new players because he can't do anything worthwhile against enemies on his own level.
---
Read my comment below, apparently you can't snipe the chest as it doesn't give you any loot and if you're on the quest the key will be stuck in your inventory forcing you to abandon the quest and get new map parts
---
I use eu account :)
---
RFC, WC, RFK, RFD, SM AND SFK are in Horde zones. (SFK, RFK and RFD are close to contested  zones).
---
Stockades, Deadmines, BFD, Gnomeregan.. that's it? 
---
Okay, you have a point.
---
I rolled Horde, but that shit annoys me to no end. Lowbie zone camping, boat camping, etc. Why do it? Is it really that fun? Is it fun for people in real life to go play basketball against like a 6th grader to feel superior? Just really makes no sense to me because I can’t see the fun in doing something that provides absolutely zero challenge
---
As Jeffblizzerd once said: "enjoy ur ban bich"
---
leveling is always the fastest, everything becomes more valuable the closer you are to 60.
---
I thought the exact same. Pleasantly incorrect haha.
---
Chat font size 24, UI taking up 80% of your screen, recount numbers 3x the default font size, wtf is wrong with you?  Get a normal UI
---
Looking to start on some farming. Besides not having to swap accounts, is there any benefit to having one gathering profession, and one profession using said gathering?
---
Otherwise I'm thinking of just making an alt with something like herbalism and skinning, and selling raw/sending to another char.
---
Why do you care what class I play? Genuine question.
---
Is this commonly agreed or up for discussion amongst healers? Like if am in a position to tell my Priest not to do it is it because he's new and learning or because he's part of a branch of healing philosophy (eg 2H vs shield tanking philosophies when it comes to warriors)?
---
Thanks friend!
---
Thats a decent weapon for a druid so you might want to equip
---
Chances are at least someone in the group will know what to do, and they can help you out. Just let them know you are new and you're still learning. Most people seem to be more than happy to take it a bit slower and offer advice. Plus you have to start somewhere lol.
---
Wisp form wants a word with you:)
---
Eating right doesn't take that much time. It doesn't require chopping vegies for hours on end. Just buy frozen vegs or even canned vegs. Those are done in no time and are frankly quite good and contain almost as much nutrition as the fresh stuff.  Any tomato sauce, canned tomatoes, tomato concentrate is great for sauce. Pasta for carbs and make sure you get some protein too, even canned fish supplies that, else those frozen beef patties are good, just make sure they're real meat and not with sawdust or god knows what added. Eggs are great too. 
---
Ok, that's food outta the way, now for sport: try the old 5BX program. It's gone out of fashion because noones figured out how to make money out of it, but it requires about 4 sqm of floor space and the ability to count:  [http://fit450.com/HTML/5BX\_chart2.html](http://fit450.com/HTML/5BX_chart2.html) 
---
Tips from an old single dood gamer, 58 yo, a bit of a game addict, but nevertheless in decent shape. Cheers!
---
"a group"
---
I dont like the unhonorable ness of the thing and dont think its deserved a sliver. Then i saw the gnome in the title
---
Ffs the lengths a neckbeard will go to grief is a astounding.
---
I am sitting down and moving to stand up right as the mob swings. Requires some skill, but is reliable.
---
As a rogue, my way of not grabbing aggro too early is to pickpocket all the mobs while they're banishing on the tank. Then I start dps.
---
That's true, but then it isn't about spellcleave anymore.
---
I agree somewhat. I keep my pet on passive in all dungeons, never have growl on unless I’m questing outside,  don’t send it running in into packs of mobs in an instance, dismiss it before jumping down ledges, and heal it when I can but I swear the AI for hunter pets is broken.
---
So I've been wondering when I've been leveling my Warrior. Does higher up ranks of lets say Revenge and Sunder generate MORE threath than lower ranks/rank 1? Cus Ive been going about tryiung to save money, and tanking skills, OP, TClap and shit like that are usually what doesn't get upgraded.
---
It's funny how you think  +5int is a bigger upgrade than something that upgrades all my abilities and  white attacks. XD
---
Now you'll be Soken more damage.
---
Horde or alliance?
---
Link attached - there’s a bunch of implication in the choice of words, but no promises. 
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=294498/no-armory-profile-page-support-at-wow-classic-launch
---
Well that response was far more than my comment deserved.  I think I need to go redo the Barrens quests now and pay more attention.
---
Most people on the internet are from urban centers where you can’t do this
---
The rest of America has no issues with crime
---
America, like most places, has violent crime condense into very small areas. 
---
Something like 99% of Chicago murders are from one small area in Chicago that’s a few blocks
---
I'm not sure, but based on these other comments it looks like "Scout" is a title.
---
These are amazing
---
Yeah, I just figured I'd type what I did for the normies.
---
Oh my. Just got flash backs of redcap groups on mid!
---
I don’t wanna sound like a douchebag but I WISH all tanks were like you (or the comment section). So far it has always been the party’s job to babysit the tank because all of them were terrible.
---
Zf, Mara
---
Roll dps or healer? I think I'd enjoy either but part of me wants to play that support role in PvP/PvE. Although, at the same time, I'm guildless and not playing with friends so it doesn't necessarily seem like the smartest choice.
---
Resto
---
Can you not wear classes? I have to when i play games, otherwise everything is the worst and gives me headaches .. and also your UI wouldn't look .. like that.
---
And you need to import settings. Using auctionator and replacing tsmdata with atrvalue works. Getall scan thru button in ah
---
Lmao I'm on windseeker (horde) And I'm actually curious if there will ever be 40 level 60s on the server and if its worth leveling.
---
Well I actually do have a burn...
---
This. I see wow as a vehicle with which to have fun times with other players. Nobody would question my use of time if I said I spent all evening out with friends. What's the difference?
---
How do you advertise for LFG? I haven't seen anyone say "/2 Tank/Healer LFG x" yet but that's exactly what Druids can do. And at L20 it's literally all roles.
---
THEY DO IT FOR FREE
---
pallypower works fine
---
Hey. Just checking in again. Can you send me the name of someone in that guild?
---
I mean, selling the water is a legitimate way of doing it, I would rather pay 1g for 6 stacks of mage water than spend like 5-6g for vendor water of the same quality, when I just want to go and grind mobs.
---
Selling it when in a dungeon group, however, is stupid.
---
You mean druid
---
There’s another dip around 45 where ravenger starts to fall off and your back to autoattack and afk.
---
It's not the true authentic Vanilla experience if your UI isn't cluttered to buggery.
---
That being said, his inventory and mouseover text are the main sources of clutter here. It wouldn't matter so much in a combat situation.
---
I blew through that level range so fast and got better gear
---
At what lvl should I try to lock pick cath as a rogue?
---
Yes yes yes!
---
It looks like "Prototype" from 1001fonts. (I use it myself :) )
---
Strangely, the lowered graphics add to my immersion. My PC can play retail on max settings, but I just prefer the vanilla look.
---
I'm a main druid, mages have no chance during leveling. As a feral powershift the freeze/slow as well as immune to poly. No mage has managed to kill me yet tbh.
---
I don't care what class you play.
---
Almost fucking burned my balls with my tea right now man, this is hilarious
---
Ohh ok thanks.
---
I'm not disagreeing with your sentiment, a great 2h should prolly go to someone who is actually a melee class, but it's every 10ish seconds, and you do a raptor strike and a melee auto attack each full rotation. So in a 5 minute fight you melee swing, give or take a few, 64 times, not 10.
---
I disagree, the gloves match the boots
---
Reasonable advice in a game subreddit? Incredible.
---
I usually hate these questions, because 99% of the time the answer will be yes, because it's being asked in the game's subreddit, instead of a more neutral area.
---
It used to annoy me at first but that's because I didn't understand the pet could actually tank the damage.  Now I love having the growl off-tank as it means one less mob to worry about and he helps boost my battle-shout too.
---
Dammit you just made me so glad I rolled a warrior.
---
Love when I'm watching the healers Mana and decide to give them a minute, then I see a frost Nova and cone of cold followed by a blizzard... Why can't you hold aggro???
---
Druid is your answer you could even tank if you wanted
---
I've heard from a guildie that rank 3 heal is the lowest rank heal spell that scales 1:1 with spell power. Currently my rank 3 heal costs 250ish mana and is healing for 700 with +110ish Spell power. 
---
I try to only use greater heal if i see a ton of dmg incomg, prayer of healing if i get value from the heal on 3 or more party members and flash heal and pw:s only in oh shit moments. I only use renew as a way to buy time between heals for extra mana regen. 
---
As an added tidbit im finding (lvl 45 priest) my greater heal is causing enough threat that if i cast it on the tank without overhealing and get a full value cast itll actually pull aggro. Heal is roughly as mana effecient and i seem to have a lot less threat problems. 
---
Also macros telling your teamates you're under attack are handy.
---
Because of this post, I've know seen an influx of this on my server
---
As someone who has played pretty extensively on both factions, the most noticeable difference to me has always been the different zones you're relegated to and access to certain things. I think the Horde definitely has it better as far as the early dungeons go, with having RFC, SFK, WC, RFK/RFD, and SM located very conveniently for them. Alliance gets, what, VC? I tend to really miss alliance areas like Westfall, Duskwood, Redrige, etc. when I'm on Horde though.
---
The biggest differences to me has always just been the 'vibes' of the different factions, so nothing to really do with gameplay. After playing alliance for years and finally rolling Horde, it was like stepping into a different universe as I explored the capital cities after having been so used to Alliance. 
---
Honestly, everyone who has some sort of faction loyalty should drop it at least once to just experience the other side. You haven't fully experienced the game otherwise, imho.
---
Ah ok thanx
---
Hey guys.
---
I played on an RP server with my healer friend for a week just to get the feel of the game and get an idea of what class I want to roll for PVP. We're switching to a PVP server today and I'm loving warrior, however, I wan't to be able to 1v1 as well as group pvp. Is this possible with warrior? I heard they're not so good at duelling. If this is true, I'd love to know which classes can thrive in both formats.
---
Any help appreciated.
---
Can you still talk to the other faction using MC?
---
People who want it link for it, then it goes to one who can realisticly farm the materials needed to grab it.   
---
In this case, it was only 2 warriors that wanted it, and one was way richer than the other.
---
Noob here, where is this skeleton?
---
Not a clue, but I know it maxes almost everything out, so I end up with issues in places with too many players. Gotta turn that doooown.
---
i think im playing mage wrong
---
Much better than I expected the pathing used to give me anxiety like oh shit where's he going!... I honestly wasn't sure I'd run dungeons on my hunter but it's been fun now if only there were gear...
---
Other than leveling it at the same time, so you dont have to buy mats from the AH not really. Sometimes you can make stuff that benfits your level... sometimes.
---
Cruel and silly but eh... Doesn't feel nice when you're on the other end of the stick now, does it?
---
You can also buy game time, if you don't want to start a subscription.
---
Mining and skinning are the two most reliable ways to make money. You can skin the majority of things you fight in this game. I just had skinning and leather working, never tried to make money from the LW, sold tons of leather on the market and to vendors. I farmed the hell out of duskwood because the worgen drop money/items and can be skinned. I had 97g when I hit 40, bought the riding skill and mount right away. Had spending money still.
---
With all elitists and toxic people I immediately stop talking. It is just a waste of time, they won't change for anything. Just crack on and find other people.
---
Yeah 60-40 is already super unbalanced lol
---
Long time Shaman here. I really agree with everyone /u/parsleymagnet said. Most totems are situational but if used correctly they can have a major impact. Negating Pyro Blast with Grounding Totem is a really, really cool feeling, especially if the mage doesn't know what's happening. They get all panicky as you Purge their Frost Armor and proceed to completely dismantle them.
---
I swear I heard a little voice coming from somewhere.
---
Do the human NPC’s here not attack alliance characters? Just curious.
---
As a druid. You main spells are downranked healing touch (usually half your highest rank so if your highest rank is 6, use 3). And then regrowth for an emergency heal. 
---
Use your max rank healing touch with Nature's Swiftness. 
---
Rejuvenation isn't really a great spell other than when you really need to spread some healing around quickly. But it heals slowly and is very expensive because instant cast spells get so little benefit of your spell power compared to slower cast spells.
---
Your right that it can be hard not to jump up though. Particularly when your main heal is so slow to cast.
---
That was Chen, and he is from the wandering isle. The Pandaren of the wandering isle know that they had a homeland, but had not been there in centuries prior to Mists of Pandaria.
---
Great, thanks! I’ve played DPS classes, (Hunter, Rogue, etc)  throughout WoW for years and years and I decided it’s time to switch things up in Classic. I’ll be sure to do this in the future until I get more tanking experience.
---
Thank you for the response, mate. Looks like I'll have to go frost, not a big deal mind you since I reckon I can mix in some fire talents. By the way, is 'Rag' Ragnaros?
---
Can confirm. As a Gnome Mage, this is true, we are the undead rogues of the Alliance. Difference is, we also survive sneak attacks.
---
To be fair though, our sneak up isn’t as nasty as a Rogue’s so that pays off for it.
---
Intersting, I didn't know they had switched to a normal subscription model in China. How long ago was that? Did they do it because the tastes of Chinese consumers had changed?
---
Is the "pay by hour" model not popular anymore?
---
It prevents rage generation which is an issue for my low level warrior.
---
Oooh shit I never consider this so far I have always had a mage in my group.. well damn
---
Bro you are not underleveled at 13 for ragefire chasm, the highest level mob is 16. The worst arguable worst thing is that some classes get a nice ability at 14.
---
What add-on are you using that makes chat names to class colors like that? :)
---
On the RP server has a 70/30 alliance horde split on the whole nearly every PvP server has more horde than alliance according to the numbers.
---
Leveling a rogue makes me understand why my hunter has such an easy time leveling.
---
That's the problem.
---
I really appreciate it a lot. Thank you.
---
Install a parental lock software to your pc and make it so that its behind a password that only your gf knows. 
---
Im guessing you are the type of person who is competetive as hell and you get easily addicted to all sorts of stuff and take everything way too seriously? Im saying this because that’s how im wired for sure and let me tell you that this freaking game is kryptonite for a person like that, so take it easy and install that parental lock that only allows you to play for a few hours a day.
---
You could level it on anther character though, but I take it there are some level requirements to unlocking things like journeyman and expert?
---
You should be just fine. I’ve seen lots of posts where people are running it on MacBooks older than that, and even on MacBook Airs. You may have to turn the settings down, but.... that just makes the experience more authentic, you know?
---
Rogue with two swords are kick ass tbh. More fun than the warrior  imo. I found slower swords kill much quicker. Tried daggers but you miss so much it wasn't worth it.
---
I'll play this list to my one viewer today! Lol :)
---
Any new pc has to be authed, when you switched pcs it may ask you again but its literally hitting "accept" button on your phones notification. Can do it when its locked even.
---
And tremor
---
Maybe you can learn me a thing or two. I'm a 43 priest, and I only use Heal unless there's a bit of aoe, in which case I wait for most people to be missing 350 odd health and then I prayer of healing. If it's just a couple people missing a bit of health I throw a renew. But I never use shield, I find by far the least efficient. Am I using it wrong?
---
First 40 was a priest, then a rogue, now it’s hunter!
---
PW:S is not really Mana efficient. I use it mostly in emergency or when I know a big damage spike is incoming
---
looks like rating buster
---
a majority of the playerbase that isn't terrible does have my mentality. if you want to play a shit tier meme spec go ahead have fun, but don't expect good players to give a shit about you. enjoy playing your shit spec with shit players and stop crying about it. if you want your dungeon to take 3 hours instead of 1 then be my guest. my mentality is exactly how i like to play the game. you are crying about my mentality because i don't want to play with you. how fucking pathetic lmao.
---
Had a similar thing as a priest healer. Warrior got feared/lost agroo and princess came to me. First swing was a double hit 1 shottting me (2 separate "melee hit for X" in log)
---
Did a run yesterday as a Druid healer. I said before we entered that I would buff everyone before we started and would need to drink. Mage had very nicely made water and traded me before the rest of the group arrived. I put paw and thorns on everyone and before I could hit the water hotkey, the hunter started pulling. I don’t think the tank had threat more than half the run. I was having to spot heal the whole group because the damage wasn’t consistent. When the run was over I walked away for a few hours because I was just you wound up about it.
---
This is intended behavior, many mobs in the game have Thrash, princess is one of them.
---
Back in the day I remember mages advertising the highest water from Dire Maul and making a lot of money. With that and portals, mages used to be able to make a lot off of TIPS, not outright selling.
---
Lmao my MacBook is beasting classic pretty well and I think it’s the 2015 retina and I have the setting on 5.
---
Unfortunately the void walker is almost useless. It seems to do less aggro than a hunter pet.
---
Woaw!

Loatheb would be the one. Official Latin-American server.

I am a Rogue. Just open it and roll for it. It's no big deal. Team spirit man.
---
Really not nice of them to not open just 4 more realms.
---
Covert demoralisation of the enemy. All is fair in love and Warcraft.
---
Its because youre bad at the game.
---
Upvote for truth
---
Totem twisting, bleh. Was not a fan of that in vanilla.
---
you'll find a lot of things in classic are"unfair.". games didn't used to have high amounts of hyperbalance due to people complaining online.
---
noone claimed you couldn't use defensive stance with a 2h.
---
As long as you mention that you're new to tanking, you should be fine. With the exception of the jackasses that you always stumble across on the internet, I've never really seen any issues with inexperienced tanks as long as the group knows what to expect.
---
They do at honored.
---
I think the priest mind controlled you as well into thinking you actually helped in this.
---
Deep wounds is a low priority debuff and wont push off important debuffs, if warriors couldn't spec impale their spec would be sooo much worse.
---
it's cool but I wish it wasn't staged :D
---
Yes this is correct, phase 1 won't have any bearing on your honor in phase 2.
---
If you have the urge to camp some quest NPCs or low-level towns, now's your chance before dishonorable kills are implemented :)
---
Jesus this UI is a disaster
---
Sounds like someone who fell for it
---
Mithril and thorium are your best bets, also dark iron if you later on run brd will be in the spotlight for this phase since its used for crafting
---
Life before death, strength before weakness, journey before destination.
---
Same that staff was stout. Also spirit is a great warrior stat for solo leveling.
---
Had a guy in my group one time try and sell water and he refused..so you can imagine the chat for the rest of the dungeon.
---
Then.
---
When we got out it spilled over and continued for half hour in trade chat.
---
Was the first time I've ever seen someone charge for mage water in a dungeon....and I started playing back in like 06.
---
sometimes when i am eating it’s useful to have the option to sue the mouse to click spells.

Which is it?! I’m confused about what I’m supposed to be doing!
---
there's always that one kid
---
From what I've read it's not particularly efficient higher up, but I'm only level 26, and I have two points in the disc trait that increases the shield. It just absorbs the full hp of a clothy so I put it on our dumb mages in the groups lol. Other than that I press a lot of lesser heal at the moment, stockades damage is pretty low. 🙃
---
I used to post on the old original WoW forums. A lot. And I would occasionally make threads asking people what their servers were really like.  Did they like their server? Then I would collect the responses into a single alphabetical text file and put a "Y" next to servers that people generally said "Yes" to, and a "N" if they didn't.
---
Nostalgia aside. This is what people, who responded, were saying about their servers back in 2008. The #numbers are just notation about the order in which I collected the information. Response #7 was posted long before response #143. The information was gathered over a one month period.
---
Not true in the slightest. I have tanked everything up to cathedral (at 38 am 42 now) with a 2 handed as arms. Parry talents, stance dancing, thunder clapping, sweeping strikes....it’s amazing. Threat is non issue. Face tanking 2-4 mobs with a 2 handed generally means I can cleave on almost every single weapon swing. Not even using sunder. I generally not bringing casters though because they can’t keep it in their pants for the time it takes to use 3 global sand have cemented threat. 
---
Charge&gt;bloodrage while on the way&gt;thunderclap into sweeping strikes&gt;zerker&gt;whirlwind&gt;defensive&gt;demo and battle shout&gt;battle&gt;thunderclap&gt;zerker and WW again&gt;rinse and repeat.
---
In RFD the party leader asked me to put on a shield after 4-5 consecutive pulls because the healer needed to drink (half mana). I obliged and halfway through the first pack the healer told me to put my 2 handed back on because he missed the damage I was doing and wanted something to instead of sit on their hands.
---
Watch your healers mana, if they are struggling work it out, it’s at THEIR discretion imo. Dps don’t get a say in how you tank as long as you hold aggro and the healer doesn’t let you die.
---
Why do I have to pay the blacksmith supplies guy to repair my armor when I'm a master armorsmith?
---
Reminds me of [this famous Ogre Magi surprise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mT-sSDOMmvM) in Dota 1.
---
This! Reason why I never roll a tank. I dont know my way around dungeons lol
---
I'm not painting you as anything. The point I'm making is that in a dungeon or any group content rolling need over a melee on a melee weapon is a dick move and is simply no different than if a melee rolls need on a ranged weapon over a hunter. Both are frowned upon.
---
It’s objectively bad. It stops rage generation. Fact. Rage is needed for warrior abilities. Fact.  If they can’t use their abilities they can’t tank as effectively, and that’s bad for the group.
---
Manawise you can heal more for less off of flash, it just takes longer with more casts so mana regen takes more time to reactivate.
---
Considering a paladins mana regen is only heal crits, mp5, blessing of wisdom and wacking dudes with seal or judgement of wisdom, the hindered regen is noticeable.
---
You going to source this info because thats not how rogue stats worked in vanilla.
---
Gnomergan can be accesed from booty bay by horde, just in case..
---
Agreed. And in the case of warriors they usually have two main specs.
---
Rofl. I just had a Warr rolling need on BoE shoulders WORSE than the ones he was wearing, and then he won the ones from boss, too. People are so greedy it messes with their brains. It's why I always inspect them when they roll need! (:
---
I'm sorry but as someone who has studied the entertainment industry for wanting to be a part of it, they are just giving donations so he keeps doing what he does. It's the same reason movies get money, people aren't "schmoozing" the actors and directors with buying tickets. They are paying to see the movies.
---
The difference being twitch is free, but everyone knows that if they don't donate, his stream will collapse. So people who want it to continue will donate so it does.
---
Note I'm not a fan of him, I just understand this industry well enough to not have a biased opinion.
---
Do you even know what layering is Matt, cause you don't seem to know they already dealt with the abusers.
---
This cracked me up
---
hamstring can proc deep wounds and that is based on weapon damage, also can be dodged for overpower. cheap cost, way better than dumping that rage on a rend or heroic shit.
---
Id say mage. With aoe grinding, Outlevel everyone
---
So i am an idiot i picked a west coast server, and now that i am almost lvl 25 on 2 characters finding groups is getting hard because it is still early on the left coast. Do you think i should just quit now and restart on an eastern server or keep grinding and hold out hope that we can transfer
---
Arthas was going to rule over Lordaeron from the Capital after completely taking over the continent IIRC, but had to rush to Northrend instead when Kel’Thuzad got weakened
---
Priorities.
---
shadow priests could be brought for shadow weaving (15% shadow damage+ on boss) but a healer priest can handle this by weaving in low rank shadow abilities, as is the case in our guild.
---
I know the disadvantages of growl, I also have an alt tank, but the advantages outweigh them currently.  The amount of times my ape saved runs because everything went to shit is quite significant.  At the current time people are playing Classic very different then it was played back in vanilla.  Everyone is pulling a lot faster with way less cc, so shit gets messy way more often.  The healers and tanks and the dps also seem to be quite inexperienced, when it comes to managing a basic pull.  If I didn't growl on my pet for at least one mob, I would see that bastard smashing the healers face in or some rando dps.  I think tanks need to get their priorities straightened out in classic, because you cant play it like retail.  In retail growl is 100% an annoyance because it is not needed, and its only a hindrance.  In classic, if you have a competent hunter, growl is an asset to be used.
---
How the fuck is shadow priest a meme spec, wtf are you on about? Are MM hunters a meme spec? They're not meta, sure but meme specs? I'm playing hunter and holy priest and i'm having a great time finding dungeons in both cases, i've grouped with shadow priests as dps and they did good, the dungeons were over, no wipes, everyone had fun. that's what the game is about. If you think the different between a shadow priest dps and a lock, are 2 hours worth of extra dungeon you should unintall the game right now and go back to Fortnite cause i can assure you, the problem most likely lies on you, not them.
---
We're not talking about retri palas or boomkins, even though i'd take those with me as well cause it's just dungeons, whoe the fuck cares? If you're trying to be a tryharder taking only meta classes in your groups thinking you'll be world first, you've already lost that race. In the end you won't be first at anything and you'll only be known as a douche that's barring others from playing what they enjoy. You're not a pro buddy, stop trying to act like one lol.
---
Wondering about this too
---
Thanks homie

Fucking beautiful. Thanks for that laugh, mate.

---
Preciate it!!
---
Resto is a waste:  Not even elite quests are hard enough to require a dedicated healer, while an Arms + Feral combo can shred anything before it has a chance to kill either of them.  And the Feral can pop out of cat form, throw a heal onto the warrior, and regen all its mana while DPSing in cat form.
---
At some point people are going to have to understand that toxic goes both ways lol. Complaining like OP for example lol
---
Imagine almost dying to a level 7
---
Blackrock Spire is closer to alliance supported areas, and is as far away as could possibly be from any horde hubs. Which is main end game
---
You’re 33% more addicted than me
---
Another thing to consider is that your non-stop playing early on will impact your enjoyment of the game long-term. IMHO, wow is much more enjoyable when the rest of your life is healthy as well. All things in moderation!
---
What’s that bag addon that automatically groups?
---
They don’t. I know at one point you could even heal them as alliance. Not sure if that’s true in classic.

The speed of your attacks is not going to change how much threat or rage you generate generally. A big juicy hit from a 2 handed weapon is a huge chunk of threat. And tanking with a 2 handed is still tanking. They will/should be sitting in defensive stance for threat and damage mitigation, and dancing out for thunderclap/whirlwind/mocking blow/pummel/etc.
---
Came here to say this xd
---
Yeah I agree.
---
You have to drop and relevel it. Then choose the opposite quest when you're high enough
---
Depends on your server and the prices.  On mine leather is worth vender price and that's it.  Same with most herbalism mats.
---
I'm not sure how mining mats are doing right now.
---
I remember doing this but with a pet. I’d tame a boar or something in the area, name it something similar and make it walk around like a mob. Lots of fun.
---
its so easy you didnt even hit 60 i bet huh
---
LOL this is why when I get a whisper after I join a group, I say my pet is on passive.
---
https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/look.php?id=wolfskinarctic
---
Yeah but we can argue all day about instances in contested zones. I don't think it's particularly valid since BRS is the main end game so there will be tonnes of players from both factions there.
---
A bigger epeen
---
From what I understand, you have to drop and relearn eng again. Get it to 250 or w/e, then go to Tanaris and learn Goblin eng from a book in a hut in the NE.
---
Hey thanks for that! I now realize that because I don't have retail installed it doesn't show up, which makes absolute sense. Not sure why I thought it would.
---
What do you mean  you have run out of ammo??
---
That guy is very dedicated griefer, 
---
I suppose that from all lategame things you could do he was really in to griefing, doesn't Ewen need to great gear.
---
Aim in life - making people not want to play the mmorpg that you like to play you are playing. Very wierd. 
---
 You need to intagret anti spy to spy on him
---
It is intended for a lot of mobs. This has also been the case in vanilla.
---
Killing the other faction is great. But this is just silly. Kill them and move on.
---
the thing is IRL I can use body language and facial expressions to call someone a dumbass without saying the words.  online I have to call them a dumbass
---
I like thinking about the temple of doom and rogues just do that to kidneys
---
Lol..... Even if you've never heard the word before, context clues make it pretty obvious
---
Believe this is intended behavior where the mob is storing attacks due to being kited. By the time it reaches the target, these attacks are then released.
---
I'm so confused by this post.
---
Even better than the original, he's got two Infinity Gauntlets.
---
Press eac + exit game
---
It do be like that sometimes!
---
No, that's a rogue. Geez.
---
they need glasses
---
You guys are lucky. The Alliance is stuck with the dagger eared bastards. They should just stay in that tree of theirs.
---
I will always pull at least one mob with Mind Blast and thats why I use shield beforehand, even in LBRS I can handle damage from one mob and considering I am also healing with vamp it is fine. If tank can't handle threat on just shadow word pain then yeah, tank is pretty bad. 
---
You know you can take spirit tap in dungeons and abuse it pretty easily, so in dungeons spriest is just fine and I drink as much as mages and healers. 
---
Main issue is pulls beyond 6-7 targets, I use up my mana to just Dot everything and then running on fumes but dps is still there if party can kill most before Dot ran out. I can do 300-400 dps depending on how much mana was left after I finished doting.
---
And doing 250 dps on boss is pretty easy.  When I get more gear with SPD and mp5 + second wind I can spec into more mind blasts which is more damage.
---
I will fall off hard later when everyone gets useful tier and I get only healing gear from raids.
---
I'm levelling a holy priest. Would you consider that a easy class to level? Wanna know if I'm part of the ez to level gang
---
/r/OldSchoolCool
---
The warlock pets seem equally idiotic sometimes, especially the voidwalker.  If it’s a choice between gliding 5 feet back to me, or taking off in a loop through some mobs just to zig zag back to me...I know which one he’ll choose.
---
i used it to find my kitchen
---
Deadscvm got wooshed rofl
---
I struggled as a dps spec hybrid between vanilla and WotLK and I have no desire to do it again so it's either rogue or holy paladin this time.
---
Paladins are dangerous as fuck in Classic. Rets are lethal. Not only do they have high damage you have to kill them 3 times.
---
It's great if there's a damage spike and I'm about to die. Just don't throw it on me when I engage.
---
I'd say as long as he didn't camp his body for an hour, it's fair for PvP. 
---
Troll being unobservant to not notice the difference between a player and an NPC paid the price.
---
I like the idea of using it for overpower procs. About Rend though, I specced into imp rend and it seems very useful. I use it no. Every mob. Might change at higher levels though.
---
Alliance :-/
---
That's probably the best reason to play a Pala I can think of ;)
---
haha!
---
I am 60 lol. It's been out for what, 3 weeks? It's the only game I play and I love it.
---
Project much?
---
Maybe a pve server would be more your speed
---
Hahaha
---
He deserved it, I guess
---
because you are not a master repairer it is easy to create magic armor, it is not trainable to learn how to remove magic DAMAGE, plus the game needs a cash sink to keep the economy stable
---
I wasn't even trying to gank him, I just wanted to hit him once for being rude. &gt;.&gt;
---
Believe it or not, Hurricane is BiS until 60 for BM, and simply the best BoW to have for this specific spec. While is fast, I never had any issues with arrows. This baby right here pairs super well with Broken Tooth for PvP, and PvE in many cases. Sometimes It'll proc like 6 times in a row, and save your arrows.
---
When it procs with improved Hawk Eye and rapid fire, the attack speed is 0.8, and basically tears apart any casters, and it does really amazing dmg.
---
If you're BM, you want thing for you, believe me.
---
Maybe I'm crazy but the [Frostmane Trolls in Dun Morough](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/6073-frostmane-troll-original-graphics.jpg) don't "look exactly the same" as [player-controlled trolls](https://phaseblade.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/tro.jpg).
---
But I guess the OP doesn't really look anything like a [Kul Tiras Sailors either](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/65760-kul-tiras-sailor.jpg) so it would probably work on at least a few alliance.
---
Haha, brilliant! Think I recall seeing this happening near Tanaris post cata. Same  model I guess.
---
Quit already
---
You are a terrible person, I love it! Know what I'm doing tonight...
---
This is how priests roll
---
i love that sound
---
I know exactly why it's happening. Just annoying.
---
Tbh as a healer, most of my bad dungeon runs are because of the tank
---
I was thinking about this yesterday. I personally expected the gsme to mostly be played by people who played the game 15 years ago, the majority I assumed would have grown up and matured a fair bit.
---
I didn't expect there to be so many players acting like brats. I dont know if they're new younger players or if they're the same people who behaved like idiots over a decade ago.
---
I mean particularly gnome mages, on golemagg anyway. 80% I've played with come in the group, ignore any dialogue on tactic and just want to aoe everything. Pull everything meaning arms tanks (me) leveling are constantly rage starved, so cant hold any agro. 
---
The whole experience is messy, someone always dies, constantly stopping for 2 minute mana breaks, and they are under some impression they're elite players. 
---
I find that a little toxic and is ruining classic dungeon  experiences for me. I'd rather get ganked in STV tbh. Or I make groups with no gnome mages.
---
Looking forward to them getting bored and going back to fortnight ot whatever
---
Or, you know, just right click the chat and turn on class colors in settings.
---
Nah hunter does that better than lock
---
he has what? 3 guilds? There's no background check to get invited, you can't be this naive.
---
Awesome
---
I really like those. You are quite talented OP. Keep posting those please.
---
&gt;By the way, you only have 30 days to activate Windows.
---
*laughs in 14 month old unactivated windows*
---
Lol you must play on stalagg! I saw that same person and I loved their sales pitch
---
It’s pretty clear to everyone here who’s ignorant man, don’t worry.
---
I think the "silver" one is the closest to white.  In most lighting it looks completely white.  All the available options at the moment are rare spawns however.  You'll need some luck and patience to catch one until AV comes out. 
---
Personally, I caught Timber in Dun Morogh as my first and current pet.

Don’t go goblin, you can use most of the goblin explosives with just engineering, gnomish has all the fun trinkets.
---
Indeed i do.
---
lvl 10 could bring his lvl 60 healer friend ?? Your suggestion, or critisism, is the non-anal, non-man-on-man kind of gay
---
Lock AOEs just as I’m about to pull, gets aggro off every mob and died, “wtf” and leaves
---
Work on finding the sweet spot for how many dots you can apply to a mob in an instance. I imagine you are doing your questing rotation and mobs are dying before all the dots expire. In some cases I might only apply a corruption and start shadow bolting or wanding depending which is stronger and how my mana is doing.
---
Also, don’t always think that the one dot you apply will be the same one a few levels from now. Corruption may be your best bang for your buck right now but you may get a new rank of CoA soon. Essentially, just experiment with your rotation constantly to find a good spot.
---
related note: if you have a good tank, try to fully dot up the secondary targets and follow back up with your main target to maximize dps. You’ll have to work with your tank to figure out a good time to start dotting the other mobs.
---
if you're horde dreadforge retaliator should be your raid weapon.
---
Here let me help. What server did you play on in Classic?  Find your server and see if 
---
 a. anyone even bothered to comment
---
 b. Did the comment(s) generally like or dislike the server
---
 c. Compare the historical facts to what people are calling "nostalgia"
---
Is this a bannable offense?
---
Who uses world chat anymore. Figured everyone was banned
---
Not saying that you're wrong, not saying you're right... But if you came into my party with that attitude and those manners, I'd kick you out regardless of your needs and greeds.
---
There's no need to be an ass
---
I never played WoW with my dad, but this just brought memories back of playing Asheron’s Call with him and my brothers back in the day. Love it.
---
Which is a shame, swashbuckler rogues are great.
---
Fair enough!
---
Depends which class you are honestly.
---
Beast Master Hunter? Easy mode.   
---
Druid? Might not kill him but he sure as hell ain't killing you.    
---
Mage? Who OOMs first.
---
Warrior? Rogue? Go take a nap.
---
These posts have been the highlight of this subreddit this week
---
if only it were that cheap on my server
---
How can it be growing when it's past launch day?
---
warcraft had panda heroes way before kung fu panda was even announced.
---
Yes, harassment of players -- and going far out of your way to do so.
---
Stuff like this makes me glad I stuck with PvE
---
Where are you finding the newest Sexy Map at? Curseforge isn't finding any results for me and for some reason it's gone glitchy so I'm trying to find the Classic version again to re-install it.
---
Pretty sure I'd buy that from him. And I'm a priest.
---
The problem is they run behind their target for some reason. So I only send when it's clearly engaged. Last run though I was targeted on the wrong guy and one of the group members made passive aggressive remarks the rest of the way. It was a mistake and I apologized:(
---
He's actually a demon in disguise...
---
Hahaha haha haha hahaha sex number. So funny
---
Found the person who just wants to play an undead elf.
---
At this level, I stuck to CoA and Corruption (2-3 adds), shadowbolt a couple times, then wand. If it was a boss, DoTs, shadowbolt spam, Life Tap when needed, repeat.
---
I main a warlock, but I don't heavily focus on maximizing my DPS, more so just having fun :)
---
Unfortunately, it's not. Druids are poor PvP healers in Classic because burst is so high that your HoTs are noticeably inferior to priest or paladin healing. Since your damage is generally lacklustre, the only role you have left is FCing or defending objectives and that doesn't interest me.
---
But that it is how you are supposed to use taunt... It doesn't do literally anything if used on a mob that has aggroed you already
---
This. Currently in Ashenvale and it is full of parties of horde, whilst trying to get a group of alliance to fight back is difficult.
---
A live devilsaur? This is clearly photoshopped.
---
A bluepost from 2005 says otherwise. Nice anecdotal evidence you have there. What we know and have proof of is blizzard in 2005 saying that its not allowed
---
The entire alliance should just re roll.
---
No i dont mind at all it just seems silly. If the groups would just set an order for nova rotation then they dont need a tank IMO. Ill take the free exp though and free fast clears.
---
Carbonite has never been able to do that, as the herb/ores/beasts from those show skills are POI's on the minimap display and the data for them inaccessible. 
---
The closest you can come to it, is using the minimap merge option and then playing with display at scale options so the map and minimap become like one, overlaying the nodes on the minimap into what your seeing on the map.
---
leveling without a vw is piss easy once you have fear
---
I use Twitch app for years now
---
No one is crying but you.
---
Telling someone else how to play the game and then repeatedly insulting them makes *you* look like a ‘soft shelled pussy’.
---
I think the person that clearly needs to grow up is you.
---
Yeah but most seem to be hunters
---
I call second
---
Noob days were the best days now we sip mage piss when we thirstay
---
Worst comment on the thread.
---
i can judge whoever i want and think whatever i want, my previous comment stands
---
Hahahahahahahahahahahhhahahahahahahaha
---
This is why you reserve items
---
They are totally viable in 1v1, you just have to learn how to play the class. Also knowing your enemies’ abilities help. 
---
Naturally there are worse (freeze mage) or better (rogue) matchups in 1v1, but everyone has those. Even the hardest matchups can be won, just practice. 
---
I used to play warrior back in the day and had a lot of experience with warrior PvP. In Classic I rerolled mage as my 1st to 60 and I totally blow. Honestly, just don’t get discouraged, you will learn the little things with time.
---
Alliance have paladins that can reduce threat that party members generate by a significant amount (higher then the Horde shaman totem).  This makes it easier for Alliance members to go full balls on dps, specifically warlocks.  While the horde warlocks more then likely will pull aggro with just a nightfall proc or one shadowbolt crit.
---
Saving the memories is why I'm recording our gameplay. I wish I had been recording for years, for all the games we've played together.
---
Tank charges mage to keep aggro, priest charges mage for heals and hunter charges mage to not FD on top of him
---
Seal fate backstab is probably pretty good.
---
Maybe you can convince your raid leader that hemo is worth it, if you have a lot of other melee dps
---
The latter. Keep it simple and remember that you'll get most of the gold for your first mount in the L30-40 bracket.
---
What game are you playing where warlocks get three debuff slots each?
---
There is a good farming spot for melee south of the FP at aery peaks. Trolls at 40-42 that you can solo pull or group pull at your convenience. And no patrols.
---
I haven't really run into a problem with mana yet while healing &lt;lvl50 dungeons, it just feels better to have a shield on the tank when there are bigger pulls.
---
Yah I want to know this too lol
---
Brewfest is up right now.
---
Good. Fuck the horde.
---
I would give my left kidney to have those kinds of moments recorded. Good job, pops.
---
Its a level 28 Instance. Its not lbrs.
---
Plus threat goes to the healer every time it absorbs a hit and that's specifically what the tank is trying to avoid once he wades in there.
---
yes and the best character to do it is a druid. fast leveling and the moonglade tp at any time for the moonwell is super handy.
---
These are pure gold
---
Yes, I started to do this but so far it didn't really work, I had Priests that needed 4 items from a dungeon refusing to give up on one of them and get the rest guaranteed and leaving. I also had Priests getting to the dungeon locations without answering my messages for reservation so far to ENTER the dungeon without saying a single word trying to ninja loot or whatever. I had Priests getting OFFENDED by me asking what loot they needed (???) and calling me names in general
---
These guys just seem to think they're entitled to any piece of gear it's remotely viable to their class even though they have no intention to ever use other specs or there are people with more necessity and priority in the party (like shadow damage for warlocks or spell crit for mages)
---
alternatively, you could be horde in a horde dominated server, or vice versa with alliance, and watch every single layer being overfarmed and somehow *wish* you could PvP against your same faction just so you can complete random drop quests in under an hour.
---
All of my hunters end in tard
---
You have to remember, and this is especially true if you have two warriors and the tank doesn't have the most powerful battleshout, there is fuck all aoe threat generation. If you "just only a dot" the wrong mob, there's still a skull to gain initial aggro on AND the secondaries and onward that the healer are immediately tugging at.
---
Boooo
---
My orc warrior is 3 bubbles away from 40, he’s got 23 gold. Honestly if it weren’t for wheeling and dealing on my auction house alt I would’ve never made it. Granted green iron armor, especially the shoulders are always a great item for fellow warriors leveling up, I’m not sure what the profit margins on but may be worth looking into.
---
Swedish Windmill Cleave
---
for the first root, they can just keep re-casting it and escape artist has a 1 minute cooldown root does not have a CD
---
Both of you suck at this game
---
No, I hadn't finished the people's militia quests yet. I want aware of them until someone mentioned them in the dungeon
---
I’ll look before I leap, well, quite literally in WC.
---
When Phase 2 hits and prices quadrouple or more because folks can't abuse layering to gather, you'll be glad you kept your gathering profs :P
---
Your first  mistake was being an asmon follower
---
It sounds like a great outlet for someone to channel their racism into something more socially acceptable. You’re at war with the alliance but that doesn’t mean that genocide is somehow ok.

---
1.12 had the most content. It doesn't matter if 1.12 is slightly easier. Where blizzard takes the game from here is anyone's guess.
---
Druid missed a trick not calling himself Drufasa.
---
Okay nice, so phase in eg 2 months and phase 3 in like 7 months? Just hit 60 so then i know i can relax a bit and have no need to hardcore grind.
---
Only level 54? You're not even no lifing it. Get back to me when you lose your job/gf.
---
doesn't help that all the horde races have top tier racials for PvP, it's not even a contest.
---
meanwhile night elves can get to their corpse 50% faster.
---
Well you don't say please every time the tank tanks and the healer heals. Making food and water is part of what a mage does for the party.
---
There’s a bit more to it than that. I don’t remember all the specific coefficients off the top of my head but...
---
Threat is going to be a combination of the ability AND raw damage done. A lower rank ability may have the same baseline threat generation, but that’s only a piece of it. If you are not doing raw damage or generating enough rage you’re going to struggle to hold threat.
---
Generally speaking especially while leveling threat is hard enough to build and manage that lower rank abilities are going to gimp you even more. It might not be totally noticeable from rank 1 to rank 2 but over time it will get harder and harder.
---
On an unrelated note, a friend of mine wants to play a Balance druid (he’s just level 20 now)  and while I have advised him he might be better off rolling Feral in the future, he says he really likes the spec and he enjoys it.
---
Is he going to struggle finding dungeon groups and such? He likely won’t do raids, but would like to run the occasional dungeon.
---
you think alliance players dont do the same? lol
---
I do this all the time. Leveling as feral, but keeping a decent set of int/spirit gear to do both. I'm lvl 22 and have yet to wait more than 5 minutes for a group.
---
This class stereo type shit is old. I constantly get blamed for any aggroing because I'm a Hunter and mustv pulled. Its a huge joke if I even want to roll on anything that isn't mail, or a melee weapon. Because hunters don't use melee weapons right? People barely want hunters in their groups because of hunters being "HuNtARdZ", and they don't even know what hunters bring. 
---
I've had a few groups amazed at what a good hunter can actually do with traps and kiting/DPS, but I honestly don't think it was because I'm *that* much better than the average hunter. I think it's because nobody even invites hunters because of this stigma that they suck, take all the loot, and are retarded. 
---
 I've played every class in the game for extensive time -- Hunter is by far the highest skill ceiling with the most things to worry about. Dismissing pet even on small little jumps, remembering growl when u go from quest to dungeon quest to dungeon, strategizing traps BEFORE the pull because you can't in combat and FD gets resisted a lot while leveling, controlling your pet, always having ammo and food, auto shot clipping, shoot any totems that drop or any runners, etc.
---
Don't blame an entire class based on a bunch of morons. I've had so many elitist entitled mages who absolutely SUCK, but I'm not banning them from my groups because of a handful of them.
---
Are you implying bosses don't die in 30 seconds so boomkin actually does competitive DPS
---
Yeah dungeons are most of the fun of classic and they've become a wrath rush fest
---
Afaik in longer fights and if you're specced towards it but basically don't bother with it at least for now.
---
 Brewfest wasn't added until BC, but Hallows End and Winter Veil should make an appearance.
---
How is the OP complaining?
---
My most difficult matchup was when tanking the final boss in Gnomeregan, and the lock started DPS:ing at the same time that I engaged. Was a right battle trying to hold aggro, basically bounced him between us
---
Hey you get gnomer too, but so does horde.
---
How do I buy some
---
I use it as a safety.  it's instant cast and can soak up a good bit of damage.  if a dps pulls threat off a tank I'll pop a shield on them and go back to paying attention to tank.  if the tank is taking more damage than I'm healing over time I'll use PWS to catch up.
---
As a paladin tank, when I pull I truly enjoy the opening moves of: mages frostnova cone of cold. Hunters multi shot, priest mind blast. Everyone picking their own targets to dps /S
---
KEEP THAT SHIELD FOR AOE PROT GRINDING!
---
it is like.. basically BIS for paladin gold making.  seal of light + consecrate + that shield + shield spike + whatever points in prot you invest and you will easily AOE farm.
---
In daoc my guild called it pee bay. I called it pee bee ay oh ee.
---
Level 32 human paladin with a levelling question. So far I have been following [this guide](https://www.wowisclassic.com/en/class-guide/paladin/leveling-1-60/#talents) for levelling. And now I am 32, I am at the point where he recommends respeccing for 3/5 reckoning.
---
I was thinking of doing this, but apparently the `/sit` macro doesn't work, so you can't exploit the original bug where you could force reckoning to stack.
---
I'm in two minds about whether to respec at all. Can any pallies recommend a good spec for levelling? Is reckoning worth the respec without the `/sit` bug?
---
its definitely more noobfriendly
---
This was beautiful
---
Ok cool. I wanted to ask as we always look for Tank/Mage to complete our group because the comp will work either way ( as long as the tank/mage know their stuff) and saw the tank has to play a lot differently than a normal comp.
---
Wait wtf, my voidwalker’s name is Thannos too lmao. I’ll take a screenshot when I can log on
---
This. I had maybe 30g going into 30. 75g+ by 40.
---
Yeah fuck people playing the game the way they want to
---
do you happen to have the spec that snutz used in this tournament? I really like his spec and want to use it.
---
If he's in a guild with competent players everyone has solid gear and decent mechanics so he'll get shat on if he' not combat.
---
So iirc there's some book you can read somewhere that will let you switch without dropping, but it's like a clickable book out in the world, not an inventory book
---
As a tank, I keep the dungeon map &amp; a guide on my second screen precisely because of that. If I get to be the de-facto leader, I'm gonna be a good one!
---
ily too
---
Gotta run Deadmines again then to get his head now that you’ve done the prerequisite quests.
---
There is what's called a soft crit cap. This is mostly looked at in raiding for melee dps, it's around 40-45% depending on some factors.
---
Leave growl off unless there are adds and the mage is clueless. The have pet pick up the adds, drag to tank, turn off growl. Of course the mage and lock will aoe cast and get aggro before the tank does
---
As warlock should i put dots on every single mob or only the one that tank is focusing on?
---
But when the synergy works together... thats pretty sweet.
---
He’s a gnome! He was asking for it!
---
Hardest healer to kill. Insane utility. Go for it.
---
This. The connected flight paths are optimized to minimize flight time. EG flying from SW to searing gorge by way of burning steppes is more expensive than by IF, but it's a shorter flight therefor if you know the burning steppes FP it will send you that way.
---
IMO : 
---
Leveling: Horde has some of the better questzones especially in the mid 40's. Feralas and especially hinterlands is way better on horde than ally. Overall horde just seems to have a better time questing. STV is always way better although very grindy for horde. 
---
Transport: Horde has really good world transportation with orc -&gt; UC -&gt; Grom. You can get quite close to anything here, EXCEPT blackrock mountain. This is where hearthstone to kargath comes it at max level. This hearth spot is effing amazing. You have mages 24-7 making ports to all cities, food and water, and you can get to raid and ubrs/brd/lbrs really quickly.  For ally they have really easy access to BRM too, but they have a hard time getting to south kalimdoor and even things like winterspring. Which is where a gadget transporter helps a fuck ton if you have gnomish engi. They also uniquely have this barrier between lowlvls, where you have to go through wetlands. Though with playing the game well you can skip this with spirit resses.  
---
Dungeons: Horde usually have more dungeons available than horde. RFK and RFD is hardly ever done as ally
---
End game stuff: 
---
PVE: Ally has paladins, horde has shamans. Paladins buffs reduces threat by 30%, increases mana regen, gives 10% stats, and some flat attack power. This is given to all raid members, with 1 buff per paladin. Shamans on the other hand can give windfury which is a rough 10-15% dps increase, a str buff and mana regen. As you can see this is mostly strong for melee, so melee groups on horde are really nice in dungeons. But paladin here can give threat reduction to select members making tanking a lot easier especially with caster groups. Paladins also have friendly dispell which shaman does not. This is nice for a few dungeons. 
---
Raids: The meta between ally and horde are a bit different here. Horde is often seen as the risky yolo faction in raids, this is because the tank usually has to wear less tank gear in order to maintain aggro, and the warriors on horde side do crazy dps. So lots of overaggro and tanks dying, but when done right its crazy. Fear is also a mechanic on a lot of bosses, and getting the tank feared for long is a death sentence. Ally has fear ward which puts a buff up that makes the target immune. This is easy and strong way to prevent tanks from getting feared, but it doens't help the rogues out much. On horde you have tremor totem, which removes fears in a 3? second interval. This means fears can be quite risky as everyone has to take the fear and then get it removed, but again when done optimally it helps the rogues out a ton. Paladins are great tank healers, they can do a crazy amount of single target healing for minutes on end without ooming. Shamans often are busy putting down totems, but when they get to work they can do amazing raid heal especially on those melees with chain heal. Some bosses with posions and disases are massively easier on horde too, because shaman totems instantly removes poison and disease from the entire group.
---
PVP:
---
Horde has some really nice racials for solo PVP, but I think the gnome and dwarfs are quite underrated. Lots of mages and warriors especially pref gnome over orc/UD, and experienced hunters all seem to absolutely love NE hunter due to the invis. Shamans are really strong as elemental, they are like a tanky burst caster that can heal. Their weakness is mobility and being reliant on cast timers. Mages and especially warlocks does quite well against them. Enhancement is a bit of a meme, too rng reliant with no enough reward. Paladins are amazing pvp healers. They really are, freedom and sacrifice is amazing abilities, and being able to go invincible while spamming heals? that's just OP. 
---
In BG's horde usually is considered advantagous on WSG due to shaman dispells on the enemy flag carrier, and ally being favored in AB due to better teamfightning abilities especially small fights on LM, and better anchoring by the NE hunters. But it changes around a lot whats considered best so don't trust me.  In pugs usually horde seems to do better from my experience. I think that's because they have more pvpers and usually not all in premades. Ally seems to dominate premades typically. 
---
In 40vs 40 ally owns, paladin giving BoP on mages is stupidly strong.
---
You have a seriously twisted few of reality due to selective memory. Do you genuinely think that people that click priest are just simply more likely to ninja items from you?
---
Great job driving OP's point home.
---
What an ass answer. You bring up those problems up so they can be fixed. If you are gonna be an idiot about it, just delete your account.
---
Ah yes, where a coordinated 8man could murder 100 people not paying attention afk outside a keep.
---
True but bias always originates from somewhere
---
S02 WW tried to replicate what S01 did but it was not able to, still a fun watch but S01 is still miles better.
---
Luckily it’s not really a thing on my server. I solokilled two devilsaurs at ~49 and got the skin from both
---
If that's true then that's quite interesting.
---
i mean that could be easily fixed by allowing transfers on the caveat that you do not take your inventory or bank with you, only what is equipped.
---
alternatively, make your entire inventory soulbound on transfer.
---
Look up builds that use CHT
---
Omg now I want to do this in mass invite guilds until I get kicked
---
To be fair every time I've ran with a member of this Guild it has been a great experience.
---
I play on ultra and have the FX glow off and my nights aren't this dark.  :(

Is there something you did to make the lighting like that?  I saw some sky box edits but never tried any.

Ok bye

Sure buddy

Awesome! Thank you!! Exactly what I was wondering.
---
As someone who didnt do BoA - what happened with sylvanas, darnassus and UC?
---
No, not in classic
---
Some of us Horde on Skarem are carebears though. I helped an Alliance do that annoying escort quest in SoS the other day. But I have noticed a pretty smooth ride so far pvp wise. STV and Arathi gave me some issues with packs of Alliance KoSing Horde but otherwise it's been pretty safe feeling as a Horde.
---
this is the equivalent of people saying fortnite is dead despite it having millions of players
---
Currently lvl 40 mage, is there anything to look forward to before level 60? Was mainly motivated to grind for the mount and frost barrier but now I kind of lost motivation to keep grinding.
---
Harvest festival was just last week in Classic.
---
1. No
---
2. No
---
3. Windfury, it proccs during spins, but the damage occurs after you stop spinning.
---
This is an ability called Thrash, which is basically a windfury proc. You can see on this DB that slavering ghouls has it.

Yes!

Thatll be the alliance. Us horde are much more polite . Until we kill you.
---
&gt;My dmg on my hunter these days att lvl 10 is probably comparable to my dmg att lvl 18-22 back in the day.
---
This is a pretty huge difference between vanilla and classic. Everyone (mostly) knows their stat priorities and their spells so you don't see any (or a severely reduced amount) of people running around with gear inappropriate for their class or being dumb (eg meleeing and spamming raptor strike as hunters)
---
Dafuq did I just witness
---
Well, it's also about efficiency. I have 2 characters already, same playtime on both, one is soon 60, one is 37.
---
Well it's hard to make the UI nice and playable on lower resolutions.
---
Try playing on old(er) 14-15 inch laptop and then post your UI.

---
Yes. Player versus Player implies no level of fairness or “moral code” be sustained by the players. You made that up yourself and for some reason think other people should live by your standards. If you don’t like pvp servers transfer off, but don’t try to shame people for killing members of the opposite faction.
---
I agree with your sentiment but in this case they are both the same level...
---
Pretending to be a Kul Tiras Sailor... (little do they know I have DRAGON CLAWS!)
---
Well-formulated argument. Back to qu'ran school with you.
---
So the runecloth was just to donate to the faction for rep discount?
---
And also I’m 100% sure you are exaggerating
---
Toxic wtf
---
Suspension for what?
---
That addon your talking abouy thats "cheating" is 100% needed if your playing on a pvp server.
---
Its called Spy download it theres no reason not to.
---
What would he be doing wrong in terms of TOS tho? I don’t condone it either, but I’m less sure of that.
---
“Should play this, so you don’t have to play the game” is what I’m hearing
---
will do loser.
---
They can already do that, buddy. But it doesn't happen, and this is just another poorly thought-out contrarian argument.
---
It really isn't though.
---
Reckoning holy is one of the better pvp specs. Probably the best for solo and pugs.
---
It comes with the territory. And it sounds like you're having a terrible time by the way you're talking so maybe you should really go roll on that rp server.
---
My experience so far is to let tank build agro for a bit, then drop dots on the target of the tank. After that spread dots to other enemies, and wand down the target of the tank. Maintain all dots on other enemies. If you happen to pull agro, switch targets and run the mob to the tank.
---
Both shadow weaving *and* shadow form increase wand damage if the wand deals shadow damage.
---
Our guild was the first through MC back in the day. Hunters were the pullers and set the pace. People who know their job are critical to completion and it does not matter the class you can have idiots. Same for dismissing an entire class due to idiots.
---
If you are unable to seperate the idiots from the class, the problem is you. That said, there sure are alot of idiots who play hunter and refuse to learn how to group
---
And in everyone else’s books it’s hunters
---
The first thing was a dick move, denouce him for all.  
---
Portal thing - always get ur reagent money first.
---
Water - sorry but you're supposed to hand him a stack at the start of the dung, every time.
---
The BIS chest - AFAIK, If it's BOE, it's fair game unless you already had dibs and arranged the group, and notified everyone.  Then you screenshot the agreement (in case they bitch to a GM), set master loot before the boss.
---
Don’t really know. It has been the subscription model since Aug 2016. I had stopped playing by then.
---
So I really want to do this but I can't find a scout oglub in wowhead and I never played much alliance, so I don't even recall the quest. Could you help? Also what's a no-no server lol
---
Good, death to the alliance
---
Priest here. Put them on your ignore list and don't be afraid to tell them to fuck off. There are so many healers right now because everyone thinks it's easier to get a group as a healer. Just find someone else.
---
If you put the cloth up with 1 copper bid but a higher buyout I think that sometimes people will buy it out by mistake because it show up first in the auction listings. Even though it isn't the cheapest.
---
Holup
---
Where is your frostbolt?
---
Also, 
---
if it’s read, it’s dead
---
IIRC sunder threat goes up with each rank. Revenge has a threat modified built in based off the damage done. You want highest ranks of each whenever tanking.
---
For the horde!!!
---
Mirror?
---
That sounds rather cheap. Angwe didn't have to depend on stuff like that and he terrorized menethil harbor for 9 hours. Every. Day. for 3 straight months.
---
Meanwhile, I made over 100g by level 36 for my mount with leatherworking.
---
Im not. Im posting the shared experience of my guild. Feel free to lvl up a alliance alt to see it yourself.
---
That would be amazing! what's the link to your stream?
---

I feel like this is way more interesting. Over and over? Yeah, that sucks. But at least you can sort of tell a story with this. If you get clapped you just die and forget about it
---
Looks like "Deceivelol" will be receiving a layering ban due to this image 👍
---
Please heal me, most groups are prejudiced against us poor Pala tanks
---
You seem a bit unstable mate. Everything ok?
---
I don't mind these dungeons being in Horde areas, but I do mind that they're also immune to PvP unless they decide to engage in the dirty PvP they're afforded because of this archaic carebear feature.
---
I honestly have not laughed so hard in months.
---
I was no expecting that at all.
---
It was perfect timing right when he said ot the devilsaur popped on screen.
---
As a hunter, I can tell you that most of the warriors can't keep agro on a pack of  mobs even if I wait for a while for him to build agro.
---
I am a hunter spe faint death according to details, since that's the skill I use the most
---
Shit you out here drinking fuji water?
---
A group of skulls waiting for you every where you go... LOL . The exaggeration drips from that statement
---
If you haven't tanked in vanilla give it a shot in classic. Especially at the lower levels getting threat on everything is like trying to start a fire without any tools. 
---
As a warrior you hit one thing and you have a little threat on it, the priests HoT ticks and suddenly all 4 enemies have just a tiny bit of threat on him so you taunt, chant target, sunder, change target, another auto attack, shout again and just barely get some threat on all 4 mobs but it's been a whole 3 seconds. Then your auto attack misses and you don't have the rage built up to do anything and taunt is on cooldown so another 6 seconds pass without any way to generate threat other than your occasional auto attacks.
---
You've taken some damage so the healer drops a more serious heal on you and peels one of the guys back off you so you chase after him to get your taunt off only to have it resisted.
---
That's just you and a healer worth of threat  to manage - now add when the healer is dumb enough to run away out of taunt range, the rogue keeps critting so high that it takes you two-three sunders to get their attention back and the warlock is turning the floor is lava and damaging all four enemies in the time it takes you to auto attack one.
---
And after all that - add the fact that yeah, some of us are just terrible :P
---
Ooh, that is actually perfect. The exact same colour as my old plushie  :D
---
TL;DR is:
---
WC1: orcs appear out of nowhere and wreck Stormwind’s shit, survivors flee north to Lordaeron
---
WC2: Orgrim takes over as War Chief and is sick of Gul’dan’s shit. Orcs march north all the way into Lordaeron and Quel’thalas, until Gul’dan pulls a fast one on Orgrim. This splits the orc forces causing them to lose ground, while Gul’dan runs off to the Broken Isles and gets eaten by a demon. The Horde gets pushed all the way back to the Dark Portal. There’s some shenanigans with red dragons and proto-death knights as well
---
WC2.5: Humans go Beyond the Dark Portal™ to close the Dark Portal, get stuck
---
WC3: DEMONS and ZOMBIES and PURPLE ELVES and GREEN ~~JESUS~~ MOSES
---
WC3.5: one part “jaded cop comes out of retirement for one last case,” one part “goth kid and emo kid try to out edge each other,” one part “cowboy walks into town, solves everyone’s problems, then walks into the sunset”
---
Thinking of making an alt hunter, got any general tips based on all the stuff you just said?
---
As higher ranks do more damage they also generate more threat.
---
I see. So considering Sunder Armor does no damage, it's prolly okay to keep it at rank 1 (or whatever low rank I stopped at) since it doesn't do any raw damage anyway? I guess the only thing "gimping" me whilst leveling in that regard would be Revenge, as it does some extra damage. BUT, I'd have to admit, I have so little rage anyways, it's not like I realistically can revenge more than maybe the two last mobs of a pack OR the boss (but at that point I usually find it more important to just keep Shield Block up to save healer mana and demo shout up)
---
I guess another question that is interesting if you know the answer too would be if higher ranks of demo shout give more aggro? Or does shouts just give a base aggro?
---
Shitty troll, not sure how people fell for your low quality bait
---
I healed back in vanilla, and all of BC. A healers mana is important, but I honestly feel like some healers, and even some tanks put their roll on a pedestal, and use that status to be a bit bossy, even when not necessary.
---
Under decent conditions, healing is not that hard, nor that intensive on the mana. If the tank is under geared, or just sucks, it can be extremely mana intensive. However, if the healer is healing correctly, everyone is doing what they are meant to do, and has appropriate gear, its really not that big a deal.
---
The real issue is the cost of drink. If you have a mage in teh part, wasting a drink or two on hasty pulls is, once again, not a real issue.
---
Horde: this is obviously fake or staged
---
Yes, you cant really hold aggro with just ret aura and auto attack...
---
Whenever I see "LFM tank OR healer and gtg" I assume there's a druid in the group.
---
Fucking casuals.
---
Can you imagine existing in real life and wanting some people to go to prison despite you relying on lots of people? Outrageous!
---
My guess would be the sense of community and working together to further a bigger goal.  Maybe they literally only play warcraft to follow that streamer.  Its the same reason a guild alchemist may be donating tons of flasks instead of selling them for profit, it may never directly benefit them but they are now a cog in a bigger machine and aiding in the success of that machine.
---
Main Horde/spend most time on there, alt Alliance when bored
---
Just remember one thing, you're going to be faced with the long term negative impact of what you're trying to escape. But guess what, it'll be worse, because you won't even have the luxury of quick bg ques. The servers connected to heartseeker have been outlined as horde dominant, alliance are flocking in droves to heartseeker. Only an idiot would go to heartseeker if they were horde. Have fun with your 15/85 or worse split, and most likely a dead server. Being the dominant faction sounds good, but it's terrible.
---
You can do it with weak auras
---
I played horde for years and years, then switched and played alliance for years.
---
I have amazing memories on horde which I'm rediscovering with classic, but ultimately I've grown to love alliance.
---
At least, when Draenei come out.  Classic obviously has no Draenei so I'm horde again.
---
I’m completely new to WOW and honestly I don’t know what to do or why I’m doing anything. I get that I’m supposed to do quests but is that it? Is this game just “Go here, kill this, bring back this” then rinse and repeat? Is there anything to look forward to? I need some motivation
---
Yeah some people are just dick heads.
---
Just finished a full Maraudon run, this really hit home
---
Hey! Sometimes we bitch about other tanks too!
---
I’ve been playing since 2007 and pretty much only play Horde. I once got an alliance to lvl 25ish a long time ago but other than that I just stick to Horde.
---
Most of your explaination goes on about things that is completely besides the point of leveling. Who cares if combat is bad at devilsaurs?! You are leveling for fucks sake.
---
Show me some dps comparasions in dungeons and how fast you can grind in sub versus combat.
---
Also yes combat blows in pvp. But you are a rogue. You just run away hop layer and keep owning mobs.
---
My guild just kicks people who have been away since the first couple of days. Too unlikely that they will return if they quit at, say, level 7 on day 2.
---
Just looks fake if you got hundreds of people in your guild, but most are below level 10 and not been on for weeks.
---
Make it a gag like the hat in Scary Movie 3
---
Is it fair for a holy paladin to roll on plate dps gear that was an instant upgrade for my warrior?
---
Please keep doing this warrior series haha I love these so much. Healers and warriors really are the mom and dad of dungeon groups. The kids all wanna have fun and be wild but mom needs a nap and dad has to entertain the kids in the meantime ha.
---
Nope, you need to be exalted to be able to buy a mount from another race at all
---
You will need to use the general chat or the lookingforgroup chat
---
I like the color red better than blue.
---
That ok bye thing, man. Amazing thing
---
Stonespine actually
---
I take it you enjoy getting spawncamped, I guess that's another kind of fun.
---
Are you trying to MC an NPC? I believe the different spell ranks can charm targets up to a certain level.
---
If you don't have 14 slot bags you need help. When you run a dungeon you don't get 40+ slots of trash. And if you have a problem carrying in dungeons bring a vendor bot. 
---
And since you clearly don't know about the mana tick regen, I'll be nice and let you know about it (despite your passive aggressiveness)...
---
Mana regens every 2 seconds if you haven't casted within the last 5 seconds. When your Mana regens ticks, drink water right before it while running. You will regen mana at the rate of drinking without stopping to actually drink. You have to time it right, but you can drink while running without stopping and no downtime. You just have to drink one water for every Mana regen (once every 2 seconds)
---
Congrats, you just learned something new while being a dick on the internet.
---
Nah. It comes from the crisp mountain springs of winterspring
---
My bad didn't specify, I have seen people MC players of the opposite faction so I tried to do that. Maybe they were too high level, I have to check that out.
---
I hear flametongue works while whirlwinding.
---
No you can't get more than 1 weapon buff. It will prioritize the one you applied rather than the one from totem.
---
Neither, rockbiter is the best buff to give yourself. Although windfury is a close second and a hella lot more fun.
---
Mainly horde.  I went alliance once in retail to get the achievement for having a horde and alliance toon at max level.  It’s still the only alliance toon I have.
---
But I dont think corpse camping falls into that category. I think the TOS meant specifically for the people you play with, not against. Like, griefing your group would be TOS
---
I think its very apparent that corpse camping does not fall into any of those categories and if it did Blizzard wouldve stated it more clearly as corpse camping is very, very common
---
Not World Enlarger
---
The spy plugin is fine but second account for cross faction communication is a big no-no unless I'm mistaken.
---
Oh you’re horde. That’s why. Come play alliance. We have more fun.
---
Lvl25 is like 1/8 of leveling to 60. Change now.
---
You have to re level it but you keep all the gnomish eng you already learned
---
You can honestly make good money in copper/tin /bronze. Early zones have a billion nodes and nothing to kill you, too.
---
Eeh even though I'd never charge for water in a dungeon it can be a bit of a hassle when you've got 3 casters and conjure water makes 2 for like 15% of your mana.
---
We are level 40 plus he’s spec into the holy tree.
---
I had a healer that pulled all the time recently. She (at least it was a female char) was also a druid, so it wasn't like I had the exact same range spell or anything.
---
It's a good panic button. Buys time when unexpected things happen. If you can manage without it that's probably best.
---
I want to know if my fear won’t land on an immune target. Any Addons for that?
---
Also can buffs on an enemy be seen?
---
So if a world drop with max + healing spells or whatever, one of your BiS gear drops I can NEED it too? Even though I have ZERO gain from that beside selling it on the auction house for money and it's a infinitely more valuable item for you? If this is really how you think GOD you have a flawed mentality about this game
---
Eh, every time I read those types of posts they just come off as a person crying because either they don't understand the game, or because everyone else isn't playing exactly how THEY want. Usually the case with tank posts because they always read like they're a screaming 2 year old.
---
What I seem to notice in dungeon groups that always seems to be the problem is tanks that don't mark shit (seriously, hot key that shit), or use an atypical marking scheme instead of 💀&gt;X&gt;CC marks and expecting everyone to target of target instead of marking every single thing is stupid as hell and doesn't work if you're rotating threat like you're supposed to, just mark them. Doesn't actually rotate through targets so healers will consistently pull aggro like nothing since this isn't retail. Uses Taunt like it's retail without realizing that it just sets you at the top of threat +1 so if you use it on a target they already have threat on it's a TPS loss and an important CD loss. Don't wait for CC or don't understand CC like Sap. Don't follow the creed of "you yank it, you tank it" for bad DPS and would rather run after that 1 target while the other adds kill the rest of the group because he's doing 0 TPS to them. And probably the most annoying, never burning their CDs until basically the absolute last second and most likely just wasting them or popping them on a pull that's realistically going to wipe you anyways. 
---
As much as DPS get the most Flak from tanks and healers it seems like most of the dumb shit they do is minimal compared to tanks. Usually it's just them not understanding they have a threat reduction ability that exists for a reason, not getting taught the lesson of "you yank it, you tank it" from the tank to stop doing dumb shit by getting a hefty repair bill, or the tank not understanding that some classes can kite shit and chasing after them instead of letting them. 
---
Healers usually just get pissy when people over pull, but just start drinking asap and ideally somewhat far from the next mob so if stupid people pull and die just let them. Fastest way to make them learn to wait for you. And stop throwing shields on a rage based tank when they pull, if they don't take actual damage they don't get nearly as much rage.
---
&gt; o iirc there's some book you can read somewhere that will let you switch without dropping, but it's like a clickable book out in the world, not an inventory book
---
the ones that matter i guess then.
---
This
---
ah yes: mage/hunter/lock vs. warrior/rogue ?
---
Mountain lion in Alterac has it
---
Like yeah but also nah engineering helm ftw
---
Ha ha! I hope you stayed and rezzed him after he died.
---
Your constant exaggerations aren't doing you any favours tbh.
---
As a warrior, the second I join a group and see a priest healer and mage I instantly feel a wave a tranquility. When I see 2 hunters and a warlock. My anxiety shifts up a gear.
---
So basically living in Australia simulator.
---
Couldn’t help but read this as a joke. Even in 2008 we tried and would help others figure the game out with us. Just saying ‘go into the group and be bad until they notice’ is so dumb
---
I had a guy demand a tip from me in an instance, which if funny because I usually tip in instances just because I appreciate the water, but if you demand it when I'm healing I ain't gonna do shit.
---
What a stupid, illogical comment.
---
That does seem weird yes.
---
No doubt!
---
Back in the day ore sold for more than bars cause it lvls mining.
---
Interesting, can't really imagine what differs, maybe they are more direct or something?
---
There's so many things wrong with that statement I don't even know where to start :D
---
Man that UI is killing me, nice vid tho 😂
---
So he's a full time healer basically? Then it's not really fair.
---
You have every right to call him greedy, if you DO NOT HAVE archmage robe and he did that shit then yes, he’s a prick. I highly suggest if you run STRAT with this same priest ( unlikely ) and the pattern for truthful vestments ( priest pre bis chest ) you simply tell that greedy prick “but bro... ITS MONEY FOR ALL OF US” and need that shit. Fuck him. I don’t get people. If a mage DOES NOT HAVE robe of the archmage and he gets the pattern to craft it ITS BOP AFTER CREATION meaning it cannot... let me say it again CANNOT be sold on the AH therefore it’s just for you to get your pre bis robe and NOT to make money off. Sorry for the rant/acting like a asshole but I completely understand your frustration. It’s no different then being a priest and someone doing the same shit to your pattern truthful vestments. He was greedy and you’re correct for calling him out on that.
---
When levelling my hunter paladins were the one class i actually feared in pvp. Hand of freedom, a fuck ton of melee damage, and hoj. Cant kite that
---
This has generally been my experience as well.
---
It seems to be classic wow with a retail attitude.
---
Basically make sure to remember growl off, dismiss pet even for a small jump, get comfortable with your traps, and download an auto shot timer addon so u can maximize DPS with aimed shot and not clip autos. 
---
You'll want to probably have a few macros to start off too. At the very basic level I'd say one for sending pet/Hunters mark, and then one to return pet. Probably the Feign death and trap too
---
Fair enough.
---
It likely has no ICD, so can procc off itself.
---
You should probably have given it more of a chance. Legion was great!
---
Doing this for a week is fine. Doing this as a lifestyle i obviously toxic for your body. Just make sure to go back to a normal schedule soon, and you should recover in no time! :)
---
Don't worry too much about DPS numbers at that level, most classes don't have full access to talent builds and abilities. Focus on keeping a few dots active (1 or 2) and wanding down foes, and not pulling agro off the tank. Work on crazy big damage numbers more at higher levels :)
---
Warlocks roll is to cast eye, wait for it to be shielded and then run and aggro as many mobs as you possibly can while the mages wait behind a corner to slow/kill them all.
---
you dont get it till level 24, the mountain lions in hillsbrad
---
Thanks for making the imbalance worse! Stalagg now has a more tight knit alliance community, and I wouldnt have it any other way. If you are playing Horde on Stalagg you are playing on easy mode - and thats a fact.
---
I haven’t reached the plaguelands yet, but as I recall, these guys attack fast don’t they? And Thrash is instant so maybe it was proccing more often.
---
You’ve seen the people hitting 60 and all the people with alts in the 20s/30s right? I can’t help feeling a bit behind at this point haha.
---
I mean I don’t know, maybe this sub doesn’t really represent the average player, but I’m still playing a lot and wish I could have played more tbh. But it’s also one of my favorite games of all time. Back in 2005 I pulled 12 hour days without thinking about it, it was just such a good time (and still is!) - though battlegrounds did eat up some of that so I’m really looking forward to when those drop.
---
please fix this game breaking bug
---
Is shit like this the reason Alliance gank me relentlessly while I’m just trying to quest?
---
OP is a shaman, they also have water breathing
---
I played originally in Wrath as Alliance. Right now I'm trying Horde. It doesnt feel right. Thinking of swapping back over.
---
You just said you’re not serious so do whatever you want lol
---
Just tried that and I can say I absolutely hate the font and style of that FCT.
---
@OP hit me up if you find a more minimalist addon that provides showing heals over friendly parties head.
---
That's actually what it's been like for me, and I don't even recall episodes from before hitting 60 I'm basing my posts from experience of just the past days and I'm not exaggerating
---
ehhhhh
---
Never bring a hunter to group. Avg/shitty dps, pet pulls, needs on everything
---
He's a shaman.
---
Lol, you and the tank should have abandoned them mid pull!
---
Did you actually try looking at the settings? You can change the style and font.
---
Or you know, that isnt a default option in classic.
---
shamans have the ability too
---
Old Skullcrusher player here myself. Never thought I would see anyone from that server again.
---
Wow lol
---
He doesn't even need fish scales to use his!  Trifling gnome.  His arrogance was his undoing!
---
Your jaw is poking out :(
---
I would just vendor all your skinning. That's why I went skinning with my main. Just to vendor while I'm leveling. Extra cash.
---
Warrior getting intellect buff? [Yes please](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwmeH6Rnj2E)
---
I can't speak for other classes but as priest I have had absolutely zero issues healing anything up to BRD so far as full shadow/disc. Until you reach the absolute endgame dungeons you should be fine if you're healing with dps talents.
---
Yes. You have to go tame a pet with the rank you need. Every. Single. Time.
---
Shield is insta damage mitigation. I save it for Squishies during a bad pull when someone pulls aggro off the tank. 
---
Or for myself. It's great in that is instant, and prevents cast disruption, so a mage can keep channeling his spelling while tank regains aggro. 
---
But yeah primary tank only precast gheal and keep up renew. If you are falling behind, don't be afraid to pop pws on the tank because that usually means they are entering pot drinking territory, which means you're being outdamaged. 
---
Until you hit late game don't bother downranking. Lesser heal will go away soon. Your primary healing nuke is greater heal, or heal depending on burst. 
---
Renew is efficient as all hell. Flash heal is not efficient but it's quick. 
---
Prayer of healing is very very efficient but it generates a lot of aggro and the heal volume is spread out, so your tank may be more vulnerable. 
---
Holy Nova, just no. 
---
Get a meter, and watch your over healing. That's the best way to figure out to how keep the tank up and learn healing cadences and mana management. 
---
My rotation is usually I wand until tank hits like a 800hp deficit (at lvl 41) then cast a gheal, follow immediately by a renew. Then I wand. In theory if your group is pulling properly that's all you'll need as it'll take a while for tank to build up that much damage and then mobs will start dying. 
---
That should get you some mana back  try to snipe low hp mobs for spirit tap, it'll help you keep the pace up without having to drink.
---
Do literally whatever you want.  I play on a pvp server and usually don’t start shit.  If you want to kill people while they are at low hp and questing, go for it.  If you would rather /wave at someone and go about your business, that is fine too.  There is no current in game benefit to killing the opposite faction other than fun, so if you have more fun being nice or questing, it is not “wrong” to play like that.
---
The mags refusing to pass water and food as well as the hunters pet, even worse the hunter not removing a taunt ability on the pet.
---
Honestly feel like i’m a parent in a dungeon
---
It is generally accepted in the community that for BoE epic drops in pugs everyone needs, because it's impossible to actually know if someone really do need it or they've just needed on the last 10 drops to sell them. 
---
That's not unique to recipes and is why people do guild runs for those things.
---
Considering your other exaggerated comments in this thread, I don't think you understand what bias means and how it's clouding your judgement.
---
Yeah, pretty much.  Higher level mobs have access to higher level abilities, and the only way to learn them yourself is to tame them.  So if you've got a favorite pet, stable it, run and tame the mob you want, kill a few things for the ability, then abandon that pet and get your main from the stable.
---
Good man. My heals cost mana aswell so I should get a tip
---
You might have to message a GM
---
What does leveling ability have to do with dungeoning/raiding?
---
Yeah kill his cat and his dog!
---
Then go farther... away.
---
YEAH WE DID and it was glorious
---
Might want to try the neutral AH - A troll player on horde side might want this for PvP BM. Would go nicely with bow specialization
---
Yeah he said he needs it for leveling. He took the gear and then hearthstoned backed to storm wind and just left.
---
ofc you can. if the item is not bop its basically like gold dropping. he sells your archmage pattern to get his truefaith pattern and you sell his truefaith pattern to get your archmage robe, no problem here.
---
Usual moderation policies as all in game chats - no racism, sexism pretty much.
---
Mik’s floating combat text does but I think even the default in game will if you check the right boxes.
---
sounds like a very clear ninja lmao
---
Lol, this has happened to me a few times in my life.  First time was with Castlevania:SotN.  Little brother saved over my file.  Some years later, my friend saved over my Metal Gear Solid file literally the day I got the Patriot gun.  Then my sister saved over my pokemon crystal game that had some mail pieces from a friend that had passed away when we were kids.  I'm not a lucky man with save files.
---
You can literally change every single thing possible about MSBT. Put a little effort into it.
---
Remindme! 2 days
---
Alliance get DM. VC isn't a thing unless you refer to MC as R (for Ragnaros), BWL as N (for Nefarian) etc. There is no need for this needless, incorrect term.
---
Get a threat meter of some kind. Actually really important for Classic
---
He’s also looks to be using Prat to answer your question
---
I can't seem to find it, where under settings is it? I might be blind.
---
\&gt;Literally drowning in the ocean
---
Yes, but it's probably available on the AH.
---
Ive never played a mage, but i would hate people who just open trade without saying anything. I always send a polite message when asking for water. Also people who expect portals without at least fronting the silver cost? This would infuriate me. Maybe its a good thing i dont play a mage...
---
Thought you were in a desert
---
Realized you stayed underwater to watch him drown
---
^ this. With honor system about to roll out - hunters might start looking for this bow to roll on people with BM.
---
You saying "play on PvE" suggests you can't read that well. I am complaining about there being a nonsensical PvP block on a PvP server that can only be lifted by one side. I can do nothing to pre-empt ganks from unflagged players and no, this doesn't make the game better or more fun, but yes, it is a vanilla feature so of course it is treated as sacrilegious to say anything bad about it.
---
This dude should have made his warlock a gnome for the increased intelligence, because he certainly needs it.
---
There are often 2 versions of apps now. Look at the right side of the add on page to see different versions. 
---
It also took me several downloads to learn this
---
Ah, I see skull-tricking has escaped RuneScape.
---
Nothing. Which was my point.
---
Leveling a hunter is easy. Endgame hunter is hard. Arguably the hardest dps to play in dungeons.
---
So we have players levelling an easy class, suddenly playing the hardest dps class at endgame.
---
A lot of hunters can't handle that.
---
Good job lads, sincerely, a dwarf
---
Just checking the ability on wowhead. There is no    global cd for the ability and presumably no icd as well, so he most likely got very unlucky with the procs.
---
https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24962-MikScrollingBattleTextClassicquickfix.html
---
I saw them recruiting in silverpine.  Non stop spamming.  I'm 43 now.
---
did you miss the G-word?
---
Yeah but this combat log is fucking insane tho
---
it doesn't. and it barely takes damage anyway because your spells generate really high threat. either immolate, shadowbolt, more than 2 dots, and the mob will aggro to you anyway.
---
Its not cheap to buy Water, even at lower levels it adds up. 
---
I have a mage and will always give water but it only takes a tiny tip for me to be happy, throw the mage 10% of what you would have paid the vendor, usually this is a few silver.
---
Level 35 water costs 20s/5, at level 40 I conjure 2, it gets better as you level but people don't know how long it can take, at one point I was level 40 at the AH, a guy pm'd me out of the blue asking for water and I stopped what I was doing and summoned 40 water for him, he watched me summon this shit 2 at a time, I even had to drink. 
---
After I spent 2 minutes summoning him water I trade him, he accepts and runs away. It's fine because I didn't ask for silver, but it wouldn't hurt for him to throw in a few silver toward my mount fund, after all by giving him 40 water I saved him 1g60s. That's an extreme situation but I find I will get whispers no matter where I am and I will almost always take the time to give away water. I never charge, but its nice when I get a small tip for my trouble.
---
That said anyone who tries to charge in a dungeon is a fuckwit and needs to think hard about why they are playing this game.
---
That's bullsh\*t on a whole other level... I don't work that way and I'm sad you think like this
---
Imagine having to wear metal armour and carry a shield. A real man takes all damage on his flesh. The scars prove you can't be killed.
---
RTZS!
---
I don't like the aesthetic, but ElvUI and TukUI are about as minimalist as they come unless you add crazy shit. Anyone complaining about your UI being cluttered makes no sense. Unless they are playing the game like it's retail, and very badly using only 5-10 skills, I don't see how they could get it down any smaller. There are a fuckton of icons in general, and you have everything to about scale except a slightly bigger compass and health/mana frame. The latter of which is very helpful for tracking your resources.
---
Do you mean your hps? I just use details so i never even looked if healbot does that.
---
I thought he also used a cross faction alt?
---
How is that ironic at all
---
I might be stupid aswell. What did he do that was so stupid?
---
Nono, you see, you play this so you can play the REAL game... Peggle.
---
Healed sm library at level 28 last night and it was a great experience, always oom but that challenge was a rush.
---
He did. To hear the complaints and troll his victims.
---
That's cool n all, but try and leave a split second gap so that you drop combat.
---
U r bad at game
---
Literally the same, hit 40 last night and it’s hard to get back into it.
---
The fuck does that even mean
---
In BFD, as we entered the big temple room, my pet (on passive) clipped through a wall and aggroed half of the room on its own, all while I was issuing the return command. Only once it had aggroed the enough did it finally listen. My buddy was in discord like "Wtf youre supposed to be one of the good ones"
---
"I have never felt so powerless in my life"
---
They do give rep, but it doesnt seem to be as much. I've done quite a few quests that have fallen into the grey zone and either the rep rewards just happened to be low for those quests or you get a smaller percentage.
---
I noticed i was getting 55 rep for a lot of them, when usually iirc its 110, so i would guess it is halved.
---
While i'm definite about you getting some rep, the specific numbers above should be taken with a pinch of salt :)
---
That trolls an idiot then lol
---
Bag space isn't free, especially early on and with a massive number of quest items.
---
Killed azeroth? You mustve not been playing during tbc
---
I couldn’t seem to find it anywhere in the default blizz settings. I’ll check out miks though. Thanks!
---
Maybe it'll help to think of it as, "you need to level in real life too".
---
There's a site called Fitocracy that helped me back in college when I was deep in that Wowcrack addiction. It makes working out in real life like a game. Lifts and runs give you exp and it tells you what level you are. Pretty cool little trick to get you going.
---
As for your relationship, grind that gf rep bro! It's hard enough in this world to find a genuine connection and a person who has your back. None of us should take those people for granted.
---
My friend and I were farming some mobs for a drop. This hunter strolls in and asks for an invite, but he can't ask the party leader(my friend) because he has him muted or squelched(whatever terminology). Apparently this guy was trying to get a BRD group together, my friend was the first person he invited to the party. My friend was one of the first to arrive at BRD and was waiting for the rest to arrive. This guy then messages my friend and tells him the run has become a 'guild run', and then proceeds to kick  and mute/squelch my friend.
---
I'm in the same boat. My alcohol spending dropped to next to nothing. I've been cooking at home nightly instead of eating out. All in all, classic wow has made me wealthier and healthier all at the same time.
---
That is the case. Spy actually is quite unreliable. Still useful but not like op.
---
Yay Bloodsail Buccaneers guilds!
---
That's fair though.
---
But refusing to give your healer water when you're doing a dungeon is a free kick from me.
---
I'm newer to wow, but yeah... that does sound like a shitty thing to do...
---
Make sure no one dies but the warlock who doesn’t want to eat/drink. Healing in a nutshell.

You're welcome! Creating the right balance takes a while, but once you do you'll wonder why it ever seemed difficult. Personally I've always seen games as positive and they've actually helped me over some difficult times, but we all tend to underestimate the effect that gaming has on our lives, thinking "well hey, it's just a game!". But in reality modern online games are actually life-styles. This means that we have to structure the rest of our lives around the game. I hope I don't come across as preachy, but the top two priorities are eating right and keeping in shape. The rest doesn't really matter, including games and gf's, and if you're taking care of yourself then it becomes clear that everything else is secondary, yet paradoxically the secondary stuff will actually work out better. Take care of your body and your body'll take care of you!
---
There's also add ons telling you when you're targeted by another faction player without telling you where he is on the minimap (except stealth ofc), much prefer this, It's like a "warning" button, puts you into paranoia and that's all.

Furry Warriors, Rouges... I mean JFC.
---
I understand that and I'm not interested in doing damage, but I don't want to be a heal bot. I want to survive and help my team and be a pain in the ass for the horde to deal with
---
Eh, I’d say it’s a little in bad taste. Don’t invite someone if you don’t plan on keeping them around. Regardless of guild first or not. I got invited to a group for Mara yesterday, made my way over from blastedlands and as soon as I got to the start of the entrance and wanted help clearing in they kicked me for a tank that was closer and wouldn’t have to clear to. Just a  complete waste of time for me.  This isn’t quite the same because I wasn’t kicked for a guild member but pretty well the same end result. Feels bad. Don’t do it. You invite someone keep them around unless they are just really really bad, and even then offer them a reason as to why they are being removed and replaced.
---
I actually take autocast off lash of pain. The damage isn't worth it if you can constantly dark pack your succubus. But that's if you're leveling as affliction.
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
I swear people play with those group side portraits turned off or something. Yesterday we had a tank that complained he didn't get any heal. Even though he'd just run off as soon as all the ones aggroed on him were dead, but there was still one mob left on the healer. So I had to save the healer while the tank was on a new group further on yelling about getting heals.
---
He also tried to claim he did more DPS than me, but my damage meter said I did more than 2x his. Oh, and I was dumb for getting Strength over Agility for my cat. Just, ugh...
---
You sound like you think you’re the only smart person in the group. I
---
Not like this though. Just another activity that is only fun for the person winning.
---
Showing your names is not wise.
---
Not really.
---
The time it took you to farm this equals the time it takes to make this gear useless wgile continue leveling. Besides the tabard it seems like a double loss.
---
I think that is a small minoroty. Most people condemn this behavior but also think the demacia guy is an idiot and laughing at him putting himself in that situation.
---
They see me trollin' they hatin'
---
Shitty to do for sure, but what did you expect to get out of messaging him other than an argument?
---
Is it my time to shine?!
---
That sounds nice. Do you know if there is any plate healing gear at 60?
---
Strictly speaking, literally everything other than the actual BiS items is pre-BiS
---
I, too, have been shaman-curious. I experimented. It was just a phase. But ooh, those crazy shamalamadingdong nights me and this shaman spent on top of 1kN...
---
Just looked it up and it seems miks doesn’t have a classic version yet :/
---
&gt;Classic is long and time consuming
---
Especially if u farm vanity low lvl sets while still beeing low lvl.
---
I’m a current cancer patient. Looking for other cancer survivors or patients that may want group up or form a guild. Seems like a nice way to connect with others and have fun. When I google “wow classic cancer”, I don’t find what I’m looking for... 
---
Anyways, I’m a newb. I don’t know where I can look for that kind of community. Any suggestions?
---
Not from Alliance
---
I say it depends on what dungeon cuz some are easy to get to other not so much but could've easily said hey man thinking it may be a guild run before wasting anyone's time.
---
For Horde it's one of the guys in the lock trainer area in Org.  Sells a book I think.
---
Does anyone know of a website or something where I can find quests in other areas to unlock quests for leveling areas?
---
Like the 2 quests from UC that send you to felwood and ungoro to kill slimes
---
I was just explaining to him why my party didn't want him in it.
---
As a tank my “favourite” party member is the guy who rushes in at the exact MICRO second that you pull, starts his full damage rotation before I get any sunders on the mob, pulls aggro, I no longer generate rage because the mob is not hitting me, use taunt, but he’s already dead, then he says “noob tank”.
---
He drowned which is stupid in and of itself, but he also has a spell which allows underwater breathing he could have cast on himself.
---
I feel the same. I'm so scared I'm gonna miss out on something.. not sure what.
---
You look like the Canadian flag.
---
Mages have been the most irritating for me, tbh. I hand out healthstones at the start of a dungeon but I have never once been given water without asking, which often takes several requests. I try to nicely ask for food + water because I am a warlock and about 10% of them actually give me food. 
---
Their brains have also been poisoned by the AoE meta that took them to 60, because every single one will AoE at all times. 2 mobs? Blizzard. Really need to take down a priority target asap? Blizzard. Pull is nothing but magic immune skeletons from scholo? You better believe that's a blizzard, even on the third time we've done it. And despite all the AoE spam I have yet to see one on top of the meters for anything except BRD prison/arena AoE runs.
---
Yeah man good mages in a run are a godsend. Honestly same with hunters. A good Hunter will drop ice trap, pull the adds, get em frozen, fd, send pet to offtank and keep aggro off the priest kiting the bad Pat pull around. Giving the group time to finish the original group. 
---
He can easily buy a minute or more with Frost and ice traps on a pat. 
---
I always try to keep the boars healed up at e they are amazing offtanks. 
---
Mages l too like we said earlier. Blink awareness with Frost Nova and coc is Paramount and isn't easy and is so so so so awesome to see work when a mage is good
---
what mob in desolace dropped this?
---
Surely you must understand how it's highly doubtful that "literally" every single priest rolls on offspec against mainspecs.
---
How many dungeons in a row did this happen?
---
No, nobody is getting banned for this.
---
Ah ty.
---
Yeah. Mages must do their job while other are buffing. Charge people if you want in the city or random whisp requests but in Vanilla, your fellow dungeon players are your BROS. 
---
Don't give me (tank) food. You're nice little gnome but if I dont ask you it means I'm already OK or that I'll run dungeons all day and have a healer. Optimize your water conjuring. Always have some for healers, other casters and yourself. Food is for people that will ask for it to keep it into their questing. No one needs food in dungeons.
---
If it can make some of you win time.
---
Im not convinced this screenshot isnt from 2005.
---
Thanks. I guess you can’t DL it from twitch client.
---
There's definitely better visuals out there for that, considering you can't fight yetis while you're flying in the air
---
I guess I can kinda see that point.
---
You want the higher level Sunders because it increases your white hit damage, therefore threat.
---
I'm a mage and yea, it's part of what we do? No problems getting water from me. I'll even make some in the field if you ask nicely.
---
They swash and they buckle. And they buckle with bucklers.
---
Most warlock curses are instant cast...
---
Oh, a warlock killing a hunter...there’s a shocker
---
You think rewarding people for intentionally wearing bad gear so they can roll on boes is a good idea?
---
Checked your ah?
---
Sometimes they hit once, or twice, and thats fine. But then there's this tower of hits that show up on my screen in a single blow and some of them crit too. I'm using Ice Armor so they shouldn't be getting more than 1 hit in per second.
---
I'm not kidding when I say that I've been constantly hit 5-6x times in a single blow, it's very obvious when there's a single guy chasing you and then 6 "Absorbs" pop up on the screen.
---
She really does have *awful* feet
---
lol you really think blizz would ban people for rage whispering? people have been doing this for a looong time
---
Check the link I posted in the other comment reply for the classic version of MSBT
---
It was BRD, quick to get to if you can get past the Horde. The horde can make it take awhile though.
---
10/10 material
---
Editing 11/10
---
Apparently im a lonely person
---
It's due to the development and proliferation of social media as WoW came out before Facebook/MySpace and Twitter etc etc.
---
Back in the day (original WoW release 2004?) there was no social media and very little online discord so we would just attribute it to an "individual" being a dumbass or asshole then go on about our day (after kicking/ignoring them).  Since no one could broadcast their opinions and theories about a particular gaming group it never got the exposure like it does now to warrant that behavior as a concern or trend in a game or other culture.
---
In turn the most offended or vocal players never had the ability to broadcast their views on offenses or injustices so they could not bring these issues to light whether they were valid or not.  They would just be labeled as complainers and be ignored.
---
In this type of pre-social media setting these outlier interactions were forgotten if the majority of the time you just simply had fun and therefore the game and culture was just fun.
---
Wether then or now is a more accurate depiction of the gaming culture I have no clue.  All I know is both then and now I've been having fun with this MMORPG.
---
The thing is irl someone can smack  you in the mouth for doing so.
---
Nice lol
---
Will do, thanks a million!
---
Middle of the pack I think mate.
---
No doubt and as I recall from back then, these guys attack really fast and the ability can proc off of itself. So imagine getting constantly procced, which is what we are seeing.
---
It could end up being a bug.
---
that's sexymap? i neeeeed
---
I think people use the term “dead” too loosely. None of the classic servers are “dead” .. they all have a healthy population. Some just more than others. 
---
I play on Anathema. It’s a server that came out I think just a week after classic first launched or a little less. I picked it because I didn’t immediately start playing with classic launched because I was on the fence, but the nostalgia and memories hit me, I resubbed. I picked that server because I was literally getting a fresh start on a fresh server and I got in and reserved every name I wanted. Perfect. 
---
It’s a smaller server, but very tight knit and lots of people. Plenty of guilds recruiting. I haven’t had any trouble finding groups and getting things accomplished.. and this is supposed to be one of the smallest servers. 
---
I think people can perceive a realm to be “dead” if they don’t see a constant endless scrolling of LFG and Trade chat text. Personally I prefer low/medium servers because it’s more community feel. I feel like that massive populated servers it’s more of a numbers game. 
---
Even back in retail I was always on more medium based servers and accomplished everything on those I could achieve by playing on a full server.
---
This level span is also was created the infamous barrens chat. People were there for soooooo long
---
That poor keyboard turner. RIP
---
i dont have that addon. 
---
what happen is when i entered SM , some horde feared me as i entered loading screen and that caused my game to bug out and i fell under map
---
Thrash does seem bugged and mobs are queuing up charges of their auto attacks. Bunch of threads on the bug report forums about it.
---
Ughhh when a mage gets pissy about summoning FREE FOOD AND WATER I literally wish I could log in to their account and delete their mage so they can play a different class. lmao what if the healer just stops healing you because they don't want to use the mana
---
You need to learn how to sentence.
---
Pretty sure the Monk Order Hall is on the Turtle
---
She's not deleted and I cycled through everybody to save the names, I logged into her to take that screenshot of her rep panel thing.  She just wasn't showing up (either in a search or on my "view all your WoW characters.")
---
I might just not have logged into her since they did whatever last armory overhaul, though.
---
We had our tank ragequit the other day because the mage refused to stop AoEing and pulling aggro.  We were not a cleave group...  Then he's trolling the warrior and calling him trash.
---
I play Incendius as well, and have en countered this guy before so without further adieu another short story about this player: 
---
A friend and I were doing the Troll kill-quests in STV a week ago and we walk up to the mob (Quest boss) we needed being killed by this guy. We say in chat 'Invite' as the creature is nearing half HP.  Nothing. 'Invite'. Nothing. 10 seconds pass and the creature is killed without us getting credit. 
---
I was annoyed.
---
There is one more quest mob that we need (and he needs). Still hasn't invited us, so I bust out the handy dandy /tar Fire Blast macro and instant tag it when it spawns. He starts begging in chat for an invite and saying he couldn't invite fast enough etc. I tell him he needs to invite faster in the future and cave because I feel bad for this pathetic little rogue. I invite him, We kill the quest mob.
---
Before he leaves he says "LOL I didn't invite you on purpose get fuckedddd" 
---
Do yourself a favor and Ignore this guy if you're on Incendius-Horde as well...
---
I sort of like that if you reverse some of the letters you get "bashswuckler" which is honestly no less nonsensical than the original term
---
Like warm knife through butter. I would be the same running on LVL 47 with LVL 23 gear
---
Obvious troll
---
Yea i have a druid that is closer in level, was thinking maybe to use it. Its more for the nights when somebody doesnt show up haha.
---
I don't really like to heal, so I don't keep an extra set of gear around this time. I'm levelling with my Priest brother, though, so whatever group we're in will always have a better healer anyway.  
---
I seem to end up tanking a whole lot though, even though I go for DPS talents and skills. Most gear seem to work well enough for both.
---
Yeah, I think it can be quite profitable. I will keep them for pvp though :) can’t ever have enough of them. I got roughly 1.5k now, but the price will probably increase once pvp starts becoming more mainstream
---
60 warlock here, who respecced a ton while leveling on a pvp server.
---
Honestly, just go dark pact. It's decent in pvp and makes the pve stuff so, so, so much easier and more convenient. SM/Ruin is pointless since you don't get ruin until 60 so you might as well just pick up dark pact. Soul link is just godawful for anything other than 1v1ing people.
---
Your call which tree to go down after dark pact. Either are fine. The instant summon and extra stam in demo are nice, but the faster shadowbolts and shadowburn in destro are excellent as well.
---
I’m a level 40 warlock and I prefer the drain tanking build with succubus as pet. The sustain is unreal
---
It technically does matter what you feed them, but this is my strat:
---
Buy meat/fish that is equal to my level and feed the same stuff to him. Easiest way and most efficient.

There are actually people who think like this.
---
Right now they're 50-100g on my server, last I checked.  I got one too and am waiting a while before listing it though.
---
How dare they have fun playing a game!
---
Yea, that’s a dick move.  You should feel bad
---
You just confused me even more. The server I'm playing "Classic" on ain't even on the list.
---
Go to fade and turn down the transparency. It will go away.
---
It can make a good amount of money, it’s got a pretty low drop chance (0.01% iirc) and a lot of people love the dragonling pets. There aren’t many little follower pets in classic so they all sell pretty well. Definitely check out your AH and see how much they’re going for there, as different servers have different economies
---
Alright, I was missing options, 
---
ended up pretty much disabling everything because it was useless screen clutter with shitty fonts. 
---
Didn't do what OP was looking for (Simply showing heal values over friendly targets in the same manner damage is displayed)
---
Its a fine addon on its own, but its absolutely not helpful at all in this regard.  Yes it can show outgoing heals but its just a scrolling side wheel of it, which I find annoying.
---
The higher ur pet lvl is the better the food must be. U cant feed Them low lvl food at a certain lvl distance
---
That's insane, that means if I were to camp a rare mob I could just let this addon run and idk watch Netflix meanwhile and it would give me a warning sound when the mob is around? :O
---
It's a shitty thing to do to kick someone out of the group just to invite someone else.
---
Blackrock Depths
---
Not in Classic- only in retail.
---
I had one say that, then get mad when I gave him advice on where to go.
---
This is only true if you have a lot of +healing power.
---
At lower levels it is better to let your tank dip low then use your max rank heal to top them completely, then you can wait for 5 seconds to let your regen kick in.
---
Spamming down ranked heals will not allow you to make use of the 5SR
---
Oh fuck I still remember the launch of GS in WotLK and what an absolute shit hole it made the game. Just a bunch of God awful players trying to cling to an arbitrary number to pretend they were good. Watch so many absolutely shit players try and pretend they were good because of it, was always hilarious to absolutely decimate their DPS with a comparable or lower GS  (favorite was my retadin doing 15k DPS against the group leader, a other retadin, with identical gear only pulling 5 fucking K...) but Holy shit it made pugging anything to try and gear into an absolute shit show ...
---
Without a doubt, that's a crappy thing to do.
---
btw I remember something about lv 8 twinks being a thing
---
I play tank and played original but as Priest.
---
Can tell you that yes, tanking will make everyone follow you, especially since I remember things partly. But Sunken Temple or BRD, I've been straight with people "Guys, I need to watch the map or some Wowhead page" cause I didn't bother watching 15 years ago on a healer. No shame, they wait. They're the first really maze like dungeons, people already lived nightmares there for some or are seeing that It's not really a nice straight place. Sunken temple has 4 choices just after entrance and BRD like 6 if you dont use the key, dont worry that's when people will either follow or take lead. 
---
When someone knows fine, I prefer it I follow and try to print stuff into my brain, but like a lot I got to do it myself to learn. Pretty straightforward on it though and never had people quit. We clean at our pace. But we clean and loot and complete quests.
---
A sickening sight. And you brought a disgusting orc with you? The Forsaken have truly fallen from grace.
---
Place your toon in rested area for quicker gain of bonus xp, if you play on weekends only you will get 75% of a level as rested xp
---
I think you’re very unlucky with the procs. The ability can procs itself. So imagine:
---
1) it hits you once. Procs x2
---
2) on the procs it procs again x2.
---
Total hit: 5.
---
Well It used to work with plus healing and spellpower gear, they patched that out later like the ZG patch I think.  Can anyone confirm if it works in classic?
---
That is such an over generalization of something... this is how racism works. Youre too emotional over one thing. It isnt the class, guy.
---
What realm do you play on or are you looking to play on? I'm not a cancer patient, but I'll help put how I can :)
---
So odd...he didn't sac his pet. He didn't water breathe himself...oof...big oof
---
Ah bugger
---
You only do raptor strike tho, not raptor + meele auto attack. I was off on numbers, I pulled them from my ass 😂 
---
But that require you to stand on minimum range the whole boss fight and use mana on the raptor strike instead of standing at range and do an auto shot instead. And if the boss moves abit you suddenly get a dps loss if you need to move out of the deadzone. 
---
To each their own I guess, I dont say I am right and you are wrong, but it sure is easier to just stand at range and do a perfect rotation from there.  I’m gonna grab dual wielding and stand afar 😊
---
Had something similar happen to my druid healer the other night. Warrior couldn't hold threat and the hunters kept pulling too.
---
I spent that entire raid keeping mobs off the healer who inevitably got healing aggro having to heal the tank AND that dumbass hunter. Of course... the tank refused to get the mobs off the healer. Yay frost mage, I guess.
---
Go for the drain tanking build, it's super good for PvE and it's perfectly fine for WPvP. Even if you want to WPvP, you will spend your vast majority of leveling killing mobs, not players.
---
You need 35 for 300
---
Playing on the low side of an imbalanced server doesn't make you good, it just makes you dumb or blizzard bad at balancing servers.
---
So you click shit and not know how much mana your spells cost? If so they yeah you need them but otherwise why have them visible if you have no reason to look at them? That's just distraction from the things happening in game. All you need is to see your big cooldoxns
---
I was tossing and turning in my sleep all last night over it :( /s
---
A week or so ago my buddy hit like 44 or something on his shaman and needed zf. I was 50 at the time in my Warrior and was like "don't worry dude i got you." So we group up and i say in general chat "LF3M DPS ZF we have mallet"
---
There was a wall of pink in my chat box in seconds. Didn't have to post again. 
---
As well a lot of times I'll be questing and just have people whisper me asking if i want to tank their dungeon for them. Sometimes if i need the dungeon or they have a summon I'll say yes but one time they wanted me to go all the way to maraudon and i was questing in swamp i was like yeah no.
---
Wait aren't bracers on your wrists not legs?
---
Depends on how big of a pack you pull, and if your tank is using a two-hander or not.
---
so I can be Yoshikgage Kira
---
This is dumb.
---
i doubt anyone would refuse someone for their spec in an outdoors elite quest
---
This exact same thing happens to me daily
---
Leveling as a Shaman/Warrior combo. Paladins are the only dangerous class we have come across.
---
&gt;Are there liars, cheats, and thieves who play Classic?  Of course there are.  Is there an unusual concentration of liars, cheats, and thieves in our Classic community?  No, there is not.
---
I'm not contending that "toxic" players do not exist in our community.  I'm saying that they're everywhere.
---
Tell that to the caged human female!
---
To be fair ZF was nerfed alot though in 1.12. And 1.6 to 1.11 saw class rebalancing so thats why classes do more damage. Heres the changes to ZF from the patch notes
---
The respawn of the 2 Troll/1 Basilisk patrollers should now be 2 hours.
---
Reduced the damage dealt by the Sul'lithuz Abomination and Sul'lithuz Sandcrawler.
---
Zul'Farrak Dead Heroes are no longer elites.
---
Theka the Martyr will now only remain immune to physical damage for 30 seconds before reverting to normal.
---
Antu'sul's Sul'lithuz Broodlings now only hatch 4 at a time and are significantly weaker.
---
Witch Doctor Zum'rah will no longer call as many Zul'Farrak Zombies to his aid when aggroed.
---
Weegli Blastfuse now has slightly more hit points.
---
Antu'sul's Warden no longer attempts to knock adventurers into Antu'sul's lair.
---
Sandfury Cretins who engage the party during the pyramid event are no longer able to cast shadow bolt.
---
On what basis is it that you get to determine what is or isn't fun for others?
---
Yep, I definitely stance dance better than the first time around! I try to open with that and throw in berserker rage for more rage when hit like you said. But don't stay in berserker the whole time unless the healer can handle the 10% more dmg taken. I normally rest in battle stance and thunder clap /cleave while ww is on cd.
---
Well, normally that's what I'd do if it was just me and the mobs. What actually happens is that I charge in, maybe get a thunder clap off so the healer doesn't take the side ads with their hots and then promptly lose everything to rain of fire and blizzard and queue up some yakety sax. XD
---
I have not seen this random bar at all until I reached level 60 I have turned off all addons and tried each one nothing is working how can i fix this pleaseee
---
Any abiliy that hits more than 2 targets is considered "cleave". It has been used in the same context since the release of arenas in TBC.
---
cleave | American Dictionary
---
to cut or break into two or more parts

The action rarely happens in the bottom 5% of my screen, so I guess it doesn't distract much there.
---
That would make a ton of sense. Thank you.
---
You can be a turtle in the game??
---
&gt; use taunt, but he’s already dead
---
See that's we call a "[self-limiting condition](https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/self-limiting+condition)"
---
Yeah, that's so much more complex than doing ZF in 3 pulls in 8 minutes, where a single mistake ruins everyones exp/hour.
---
Go into one, once, and go "spam AE". Stream it perhaps.
---
Dismissing before jumping ledges, I learned this the hard way ._.
---
Warrior is fine arms all the way till raiding. Carry a sword and board for dungeons and your healer will love you. You can 2h tank but man will your healer's mana be crying.
---
hahaha I did that quest the other week and said "wait a minute, I thought they were on our side"
---
When I can only do 2 at a time only casters are getting water and food. It just takes too much time. I also try and stock up while waiting for the group to gather. I have to admit one change I wouldn't mind is mage tables coming back.
---
Don't get this guy's hope up. I love seal fate more than anything but its raid dps is an absolute joke compared to combat.
---
Hemo I find extremely questionable. It has unbelievably trash dps by itself, the hemo debuff doesn't add very much, and it takes a valuable debuff slot.
---
I mained rogue in vanilla and went rogue on private servers but this time I decided to choose warlock because as much as I love rogue, you really need to be combat for raiding which I can't stand.
---
Uhhh life tap
---
Prolly this.
---
Ah I missed the part where these were two different occurrences. Nah for sure wouldn't be doing him any favors after he shafted your friend, you're in the right here
---
life tap bruh
---
Could you MC someone and attack goblin city guards? Must have to click at war first in reputation.
---
I'd prefer to make a "nice" profit instead of 2 to 3 copper.
---
I got the exact same 3 pieces on my priest in the same dungeon. One run too! 
---
Enjoy the gravestone scepter when you get it.
---
I'm not saying people haven't been friendly to me. I generally buff everyone I see and my food/water will always be free so I've found other players to be nice enough. I'm just saying mages in general have gained a somewhat negative reputation, we don't need to be trying to charge for food/water and make it worse.
---
Why don't you stop gatekeeping jokes?
---
as someone whose never played warlock before, I never would've thought to do either of those things
---
I'm going to rock you, like a Hurricane.  Yeahhhh 😎!
---
"The kids" are trying to bring back clout?
---
Clout had it's time, it's over. Leave it alone.
---
The mage did start the fight... If they were gear gimped, probably shouldn't have picked the fight.
---
It was very satisfying to watch haha
---
Not talking about totem twisting, maybe you're fighting 1 mob and don't wanna waste your mana to kill it 2 secs faster or maybe you're just back drinking, or tank pulled the adds out of range of the totem you just placed. Someone will say wf regardless when their buff fades and I really find it infuriating.
---
I care about neither your drops nor your dings tbh
---
Don’t bring no changes up every time Blizzard makes a bad choice.  The servers on startup were a mess.  I’m still upset I reserved my name and had to reroll in a new server due to huge queue times.  
---
Blizzard could have done a hundred things to make the launch run more smoothly, but they are arrogant and didn’t take the launch seriously.  And now we deal with the consequences.
---
Don’t worry it’s not like others from the Alliance didn’t *already* follow like the dogs they are
---
Idk what lvl you are but in BRD Rogue can solo clear torch room (notoriously difficult part) so the party can just run through to the next area after the Braziers are all lit by stealthed rogue.
---
Makes rogues highly sought after for full clear BRD
---
So made the mistake of overleveling from my group. Now looking for an alt to play with them to fill whatever role is needed. So my choices are druid, priest or warrior. On any given night idk who will and wont show up. But recently its been the tank. Any advice?
---
Imagine being too stupid to get the joke lmao
---
You think you do, but you don't.
---
What's that got to do with bringing up nochanges?
---
U.S.A lol worst exemple
---
You want it for that aq boss
---
Funny, as a healer, i'm more often than not in the leader role.
---
dream team
---
That’s not the fault of the dummies selling under vendor price.  That’s the fault of the dummies flooding the market by farming those things that people don’t want right now.
---
If something is sitting under vendor price on the AH doesn’t it logically follow there are better things to farm?
---
Dick move.
---
I promise I'm nowhere near this melodramatic in game :P
---
I started drawing the character as this edgelord meme and it took off so I have to ~~karmawhore~~ give the people what they want!
---
He probably read a guide that says don't buy water breathing
---
The macro messed up on formatting cause of reddit, check my other comments for a link to shaman discord where the full macro is.
---
Ow yer that makes sense 😅
---
I'm finding a lot of information on normalization as it has been explained, and pretty much nothing on weapons with an attack speed of 3.6 not having an attack speed of 3.6...so...no, i guess?
---
I'm gonna specc resto at 60 for raiding anyway, so i don't mind it that much. I prefer tanking now though, as long as the group isn't retarded. I guess it's preference. I'm mostly just trying to get the most xp out of the few hours i have available, and then i can't be picky
---
Thats your mount right there! 🎉
---
I used to play on Taiwan servers for sc2 from the us it was aight. As long as you play on a us West server I think you will be ok lag wise on wow.
---
Having played around it for a bit I cannot find any errors or questions.
---
Use this one guys!
---
I have skinning and herbalism on my main.  I have an alt too, does it make sense to take leatherworking and alchemy on my alt, and just feed materials to him?
---
🤔 ima test that out soon as i get home
---
Do you have any proof of that? Raid ids work differently than instances.
---
Relationships come and go, epics are soulbound !!!
---
Its not rep bar issue, I had same shit coming up when I dinged, dont know how to get rid of it
---
The background music was atrocious
---
You can be an adult and still act like a child.  :P
---
That said, I’ve always found both factions to have a mix of people.  Seems like a matter of perspective.
---
Kinda lazy for the devs to just say "you can't do that" instead of just fixing the problem. As long as they don't make me accept some list of rules before playing, I would say it's fair game no matter how toxic it is
---
How?
---
To me it's worth a BiS gear to YOU it's only worth money. By your logic it's ok for me to roll on your gear because I can sell it. Bloodmail Boots? It's worth 3g to me though. Sacred Charge? But dude that's worth 6g to me. Second Wind? Sorry. So for you it's okay for me to go around with this mentality?
---
heh yeah they're the best :) Except ..for tauren on a Baron's horse though, hard to beat that one :P
---
It's bad unless you're healing a Paladin tank or the tank is about to die. Anyone who uses it regularly simply doesn't know it stops Rage generation. Tell them.
---
I understand his mistake here. I left around the same time because of cataclysm. I got my main up to 85 and quit. It just wasn’t the same game anymore. It felt empty. They are easy to mix up because I stopped caring in that general frame of time. 
---
When I look back at that time, I consider myself really leaving during WOTLK because that was the last time I really hardcore played the game.
---
Looks like an honest mistake, but the sentiment holds true. I am also addicted to classic because it’s the game I loved, remembered, and began with.
---
Warlocks dont have to buy a 90g mount though, i cant see why wouldn't get all their talents
---
Hey, at least you actually get the 15 minute class-wide buffs. They shouldn't even be in this game at this point in the timeline. Raiding with nothing but 5 min single-target buffs sounds like hell. 
---
I suspect that's why paladins are so overpowered in raids. Blizzard may have initially balanced them under the assumption that they'd just be spending all of their time casting buffs.
---
The acquatic form thing is very. Annoying as you can't actually use the form to see where your going other than using minimap.
---
I seeeee.
---
Prot pally bis item. There is a paladin on Venoxis who is fuckin spamming the chat and wants to buy it desperately. I wish you could sell it to him so annoying.
---
Yup theres a lot here, but some of this is just vanilla.
---
Lolz get me a picture quickly please hahaha need that
---
This is accurate lol
---
It’s ok, part of being a child is learning how to behave.  It gets easier when you’re a grown up.
---
Some of the best recipes for alchemy need rep grind and the ability to go into Scholomance to use the special alchemy tables in there. Not sure about leatherworking, but if you do alchemy you'll be limited to the lower profit options.
---
Also note, you need to get your alts to L35 to max a profession on them.
---
That would depend on your experiences. 
---
I'm saying you can only speak for yourself.
---
You write "The speed of your attacks is not going to change how much threat or rage you generate generally. "
---
How on earth do you explain this?
---
You are toxic, you don’t do that to someone.
---
Coon: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ethnic_slurs#C
---
You need to find a priest that’ll run SmGy with you. Don’t do the whole dungeon just got up to the 2nd chest &amp; see if there’s a possible respawn. After that go reset instance &amp; keep that up. After your bags are full you should have anywhere from 15 to 18g to go vendor plus some possible blue boes to put up on the AH.
---
I just advertise as a tank, and I refuse to do anything but tank. Sometimes this means I have to start the group myself, but I'm fine with that. Hit 50 last night and I spend half my playtime tanking dungeons.
---
Whenever someone asks me to heal, I tell them I vendor all int/spirit quest rewards I get because bears don't need mana.
---
We? Sounds like the priest killed the gnome
---
Maybe you shouldn't roll on a PvP server if you don't want to be on a world with you know world PvP... Or just play a lame ass warlock who dots and fears everyone and runs away.
---
Bashswucklers neither swash nor buckle, but instead bash swucklers.
---
You generate rage on white weapon hits?
---
yes, no taunt. you have to be careful with pulls, drop consecration and wait for a tick or two before doing dropping mage AoE so you don't overtake the consecration aggro. alternatively having a dps warrior who can taunt or a druid who can pop in bear to deal with stragglers can be nice while not saccing a slot.
---
holy damage autoattack or holy shock can help "taunt" a pulled mob back. also improve blizzard slow/root gives the pally time to react to pulled mobs or step back for a second and channel a heal himself you're just farming as 2 rather than a full group with a priest.
---
also can just put protection bubble on one who drew aggro to reset it. can still cast with that one.
---
warriors are just the better tanks in general. but nothing can hold aoe aggro like consecration (and... blessing of salvation...)
---
ret aura also means the pally aggro keeps generating more aggro. add thorns and bam.
---
If you keep buying the gems that are below vendor price you will be able to list your gems for a higher price.  
---
If there's demand for the item it will sell and you can control the market for it. If there's no demand your items won't sell.  
---
If there are too many people trying to sell and no one actually buying then perhaps you are over valuing the items.
---
Good on you for realising early. Since I’ve tried wow again I’ve come to the conclusion it is simply not something you can play if you have actually important things to do. It takes up way too much time and focus
---
Are you sure you still need them 1.12?
---
Because you said Blizzard could have done something smart, but #nochanges.  You’re shifting blame to the community for things the community never asked for.  It’s a straw man.  It’s a statement in bad faith
---
Update bartender, the exp bar gets greyed out at lvl 60
---
Looks like he spoke truth.
---
Well dont most classes have that kind of specs?
---
With dps who don’t let you build threat before raining hellfire upon the mobs, 2h tanking is the way to go. Charge -&gt; swing -&gt; sweeping strikes -&gt; berserker stance -&gt; berserker rage -&gt; whirlwind -&gt; equip shield + 1h and use def stance. Fuck sunders on random mobs with this method mostly, just do more dps in def stance. 
---
If you lose aggro on a mob and taunt is on cd, your dps won’t immediately die, so just spend the time gaining higher threat on the rest of the pack.
---
Not trying to be rude or anything but just form your own groups. That's what I do as a Dps it doesn't take long unless your on a low pop
---
Didnt he say he saps the hunter...?
---
One of our officers is shadow and he is doing quite well. We won’t invite another shadow to the guild though. And I think he will fall behind later on
---
Man you're missing the point entirely and that's now what we're discussing.
---
That's why you pull fast now in retail so people can't talk shit. The moment cross realm became a thing speed running became the norm.
---
i think you're mistaken. angwe did the same spy account thing back in vanilla and got away with it. In one of the screenshots iirc he talks to a gm and asked if what he was doing with the spy account was allowed and they said yes.
---
I dunno, mmo launches personally will always be the best time to play (bugs and server issues aside). It might be over a decade old but the communities built in these few months are why I believe people play Classic. You ask anyone why they stopped playing WoW, it didn't come down to the content being bad, the majority will say it was because their community finnaly died off and they had no friends left from their original leveling/gear grinding experience.
---
This just triggered my WoWPTSD
---
They certainly forget their book pets. I always ask for Fire Shield if I see Imp out for threat gen as a tank and had some "I didn't buy it".
---
So cool
---
I think you meant to say "Ah heh ooo ihh oww ayy!"
---
I killed a jet black rare spawn wolf named snarler in Feralas the other day.
---
I'd like a series of the mage vendor
---
There definitely is, not on top of my head tho. Check classic.wowhead.com for it.
---
Yeah but had you played warlock you would know these things by this level
---
You have motivated me to take it easy as well; going to the gym!
---
Not surprised by a comment like that tbh. Some of the biggest losers who play wow all the time make these stupid jokes, which may ironically even be the reason they don’t have a girlfriend or never even had sex
---
Healer at 30% mana (not drinking): Gogo!  
---
Also healer at 30% mana: I'm oom, why are you pulling??
---
Can i change the colour on my shapeshifted druid? Or change the apperance in any way?
---
Or he missed/parried/dodged. I can’t tell you how many times people have attacked before I even touched a mob. Btw one thunderclap is not enough to dump into mobs.
---
While you're there you can easily farm the Viscous Fallout for the very useful Hydrocane. Just know that it has a 13% drop rate, so you're going to be owning a ton of Acidic Walkers.
---
I’m guessing it was tigerstrike mantle
---
Don't think the problem is so much shadow being bad dps but the low debuff limit. Raids only likely to take one if any to buff the warlock damage.
---
You want to attack faster, preferable 1.5 atkspeed or less in order to generate the most amount of rage SO THEN you can spam sunder armor on several targets, not run around rage starved with 2H....
---
Like, I dont remember rage cost for all abilities.
---
But sunder is cheap. Other stuff you do with 2H is not cheap as far as I know.
---
Sunder makes your teammates do more dmg.
---
I'm not buying these gems, as I've already said I'm trying to sell them and how can a reagent be "over valued" by wanting to sell it more than the vendor price?
---
A good tank is a good raid/dungeon leader.
---
Undead (as in the mob type) mostly is immune to fear effects. Outside of that in pvp it’s determined by buffs on your target. You can make a weak aura that tells you if the target has free action potion, berserker rage or whatever abilities you want to track.
---
eh the party chat and post dungeon trade chat made it worth it tbh.
---
That UI haha
---
Yeah - that wouldnt be the same thing. You arent stopping anyone with your logic. So... no he isnt naive.
---
Another thing I like to do to save mana is use Judgement of Light when healing dungeons; done multiple pulls in a row without needing to drink and I don't even have Seal of Wisdom yet.
---
That's true, my bad. But the classic community hates cross-server things, and that's the solution they chose to help prevent faction imbalance in retail.
---
I was super hyped, had everything ready, but then real life came and as a result, I haven't even been able to log in and play any of my characters since launch day. 
---
All my friends simply went on and said "screw waiting, we're playing" and went on to level without me. It's still a couple days until I'll be able to play. Unfortunately, everybody's already in late 30s-mid 40s, so… ;)
---
Don't worry, you're not that far behind, if at all.
---
&gt; /run if GetUnitName("target")==nil then TargetNearestEnemy() end
---
&gt; /run if not IsCurrentAction(60) then UseAction(60) end
---
&gt; /cast Riposte
---
&gt; /cast Sinister Strike
---
Do you have to change anything in here to make it work or just keep everything the same?
---
A proper BRD farm with no tank is 140k exp an hour, at that rate the Hunter starts having issues finding mobs that spawned fast enough.
---
Are drops determined after the mob dies or when it spawns?
---
I raided a shadow priest all the way through TBC, but I was the only one in the guild. You can do it you'll just need to spend time finding the right guild.
---
Please enlighten me since I will be a holy priest on 60
---
A super casual guild should be fine with whatever spec you want. But yeah, Combat is best - you need good gear (C'thun) for Seal Fate to become competitive.
---
Yup. Rolled a lock for the first time, using water breathing pvp shenanigans regularly since about level 25.
---
I'm about to become lvl 40 together with my friend. We've got 20 gold each. 
---
I've been looking at some gold farming methods but none of them would work with 2 people I think, or am I wrong?
---
We level together so our xp should stay somewhat the same. What would be a good way to farm gold as 2 lvl 40's working together?
---
Go back to retail noooooob
---
Can’t get camped by Horde if you are Horde. Got it?
---
As a paladin from original vanilla as said before blessing of light on your tank and using down ranked flash of light is your best friend. Holy light is great if it's going to crit ie divine favor but other than that it's going to total your mana pool
---
But that dominant faction issue already exists on Stalagg, Skeram, Kirtonos, Herod. Those 4 are already 65/35 or worse per the census data before it broke.
---
You're assuming that enough ally are going to flock to Heartseerk to make it 15/85? No server has ever gotten that bad, and you already have Horde holding tight on the servers they already overwhelm.
---
If 150-200 horde moved from each of those four realms above, every single realm would be better off from a faction balance perspective.
---
"Although roadtripgod has a nice ring to it.."
---
Does this macro auto attack for me also? I have a macro where it will auto attack if I dont have enough energy for sinister strike.. will this also auto attack if not enough energy and use riposte if I parry a target? Will it do all 3?
---
Riposte/SS

This sub is significantly more hardcore than the average.  I mean, you could say that about most subreddit.
---
Nice, actual karma.
---
The dedicated internet audience figured out the S1 twist super early.  Season 2 they tried to subvert expectations and the show went off the rails.  It’s intentionally confusing. 
---
I hope they go back to their roots in S3
---
Yeah people got sucked into the "I know what to do I did it before so this time I can do it faster and better and right and first!" (always with the firsts) in order to what? Impress some people because some person is the first on the server to have a different faction fast mount? Do your thing. Enjoy it. Personally I am doing all the quests i can and experiencing all i missed from before trying to level fast and raid and pvp. It's amazing. Still level 28 and don't gaf.
---
You're a little dumb aren't you?
---
Wtf are you smoking
---
But.. he's a warlock?
---
He can't use water breathing too! and he dosen't even need mats for it!
---
Inviting someone to BRD, letting them travel all the way there, and then kicking them is a dick move.  
---
So yes, you were toxic.
---
They run behind the enemy (like everyone hitting the mob in melee except the tank should be doing)  because if you are attacking an enemy in melee from the front you have a chance to be parried. 
---
Not only does this make you hit less, reducing your dps, it also causes the tank to take more damage, because whenever any unit (pc or npc) parries an attack, their next auto attack happens faster. 
---
In pvp, attacking from behind also negates dodge chance. Mobs can dodge attacks from behind, however. 
---
Long story short, always melee from behind unless you're tanking.
---
When I played vanilla back in the day I had a battleground twink 29 warrior and he was a monster.  The issue with rogues at that level is they're just sort of slow and require you to be making poisons and everything. Whereas a twink geared warrior can pretty much one shot anything of the same level.
---
The amount of red level rogues I've nuked attests to this. Granted, most of them were plain bad or just begginers, but thinking a green level priest is an easy snack is a corpse run awarding mistake.
---
Literally the only dungeon that is in a horde safe zone is RFC, whereas alliance has stockade and gnomeregan in safe zones.
---
Only the newbie zone is setup to be safe on pvp servers.
---
Now if we're talking a normal server then every zone is safe unless you flag yourself.
---
So this is my first time playing wow and I am priest. Do priest not get brought to dungeons? Or is that just for shadow priest? I play on horde on my server and haven't tried any dungeons or anything like that.
---
Demon Armor health regen, health stones, and first aid makes this a non issue.
---
I always tell my healers don't worry about healing me when I'm life tapping. If they do it afterwards then that's on them but still appreciated.
---
What do you have a tiny display or something? There's plenty of room
---
The books are expensive and buying the highest rank teaches all previous ranks.
---
No, that's not my logic, because those items are BOP, so to the person who needs them they're something else than money, that is not the case for boe items (or in this case a recipe).
---
The only reason you don't have said pattern yet is because of money, you could just buy it if you wanted to, but you don't because you value money.
---
Submitted. Thanks!
---
Wow, I haven't seen a genuine epic fail like this in a long time.
---
Yeah that's why I'm playing a lot until I feel OK on the server. Hitting 60 soon (almost 57), grinding through dungeons as a prot, having tons of fun, but I know that when I'm logged on I won't log off. I usually take a 1 to 2h break in the middle of a session though, eating and catching up on Netflix, stuff like that. Therefore I do everything I must do in the morning (like work or exercise).
---
Gonna slow down at 60 and probably afk IF waiting for friends whisp or guild calls while I live my life.
---
But well I have good conditions. Works at home, no girl atm and no childrens. I'm sure I wouldn't play as much having the latter 2.
---
It's bm if they have something on reserve and don't state in when advertising for the group or when you join the group but otherwise that shit was going on all the time
---
I'm with ya man there's no reason for it to be hidden unless your display is obnoxiously small.
---
Druids are very fun to play once you get to hear and cat form.  You can also heal and or tank regardless of your spec while leveling which is good to take into consideration
---
There is a teleportation pad.
---
Why are you cherry picking everything? You find the most senseless things to argue. Ppl are letting you know ur view is of the minority. There are plenty of rogues, though. So keep supply and demand in mind. Your immaturity wont get u far.
---
So there is usually a shadow priest in a raid  only 1 just to support the warlocks. The debuff limit is why there isn't more. Mana is an issue as shadow in raids the fights just take too long. Now in 5 mans and pvp that is another matter they do melt  mobs. If you like shadow stay shadow you will always have a spot in raids and pvp. However a good player will use or can use all 3 specs of there talent trees. I think this is why pure dps classes are Popular I play a warrior and im always ready to tank or dps. You picked up the priest one of the best classes in all of vanilla use all 3 specs gear out a shadow, disc and holy gear be flexible stick with it and bask in the glory of the light! Until someone pisses you off then melt them with shadow.
---
Cheers
---
SM is in horde territory as well.
---
Good learn me, you from m8.
---
Assuming that it behaves like WF then there is a 20% chance.
---
I would open a ticket and see. My guess is they’re gonna come back with working as intended, but it would at least have it looked at.
---
Cool you beat a bad warlock.
---
I wish you were on skeram so I could camp you on my 60 lock.
---
I'm pretty sure dual wielding warriors is a thing because of the amount of rage they have access too not only for dual wielding for the looks?
---
Love this. 
---
Shout out to the conscientious DPSers that take the time to understand threat mechanics and the value of patience. Smaller pulls done quick is a hell of a lot faster than repeated corpse runs.
---
Except... you’re spending a shit ton of your time playing a video game instead of achieving something in real life
---
Do they not have green nameplates?  How did they not know it was a real person?
---
I think this is linked to the skin colour/hair/features you picked on character creation...so you can’t change unless Bliz introduce appearance change in the future
---
The stats is going for are bad. It’s like all int gear with a lot of healing power. There are a lot of pieces with less int and more spirit/mp5 that are better. The gloves for example are horrendous. There are like 5 pieces better than that.
---
General chat particularly barrens and all trade chat is worse many fold like bullshit for no reason shit.
---
I play on Herod Soo theres alot.
---
I made it, thx for the help
---
Just save my comment and let's talk in phase 3.
---
I tend to almost exclusively use Flash of Light due to mana and occasionally use Holy light only when I need the big heal and can wait the 2.5 seconds but not the 3 from 2 Flash of Lights.   
---
Also the more you cast the more you get out of +healing gear so the more of that you have the better Flash would become (or so I believe).   
---
Of course Holy Light would also be the only spell you should use for Illumination 99% of the time since the mana cost is a non-factor and the crit will mean more on Holy Light.  
---
This is my experience so far with Classic and is all feelscraft stuff and some simple checks of heal/mana from the FoL and HL spells. I've been duo leveling with a warrior and have done many dungeons, the logic above has applied for me since I got FoL up to level 48 where I am now.
---
This is exactly it. I quite literally just say “Druid (any role) LFG [dungeon]”
---
They don't get it. These are the people that ruined retail wow.
---
Could work well as rogue tanks tbh. More focused on avoidance than taking hits. Spiky, but lower dtps than other tanks. Man this would be so cool.
---
Because coarse gorilla hair vendors for 60s per stack of 10 and the mob levels range from 32-43 so there's a lot of flexibility &amp; opportunity. The DR on the gorilla hair is also much higher than other vendor items, between 19 &amp; 49%
---
nah buddy pal dudd pee pee, my point is a lvl 10 could bring his 60 friend and wreck havoc in a starter zone (because according to you it should be a contested area among same levels). they can't do that now (unless the opposite faction attacks first). your comments are weird :S
---
If you're a priest healer you're welcome to all dungeons :p but honestly play what feels right for you
---
I raid as shadow and currently have full BIS gear. Albeit there are no other shadow priests in our group.
---
5 mans are alright. If you know what you’re doing then you’ll keep up in dps on trash. On bosses you’ll usually top or come close to it.
---
The issue with raiding is that you don’t actually dps much. You get your shadow stacks out but you can’t have dots on the boss, so no mind flay and no SWP. So you’ll mind blast and wand spam, or mind blast and heal.
---
Alternatively there’s a smite spec you can go for raids where you go deep disc and light shadow. It deals more damage than shadow in raids and offers more utility.
---
You're absolutely right, in fact..I started my rogue at TBC, was looking at the talent yesterday and prep is missing, Mutilate &amp; shadow step as well, 41/20, 44/17 or 17/44
---
So far 34/12/5
---
will up my Feral Druid for now :D
---
Now imagine if he was a hunter and his pet was named jelly beans.
---
How. How how how. I’m 36 and trying drain tanking and I’m oom after 3 mobs
---
Retail players don't get it.
---
I hide ALL my bars in combat and check range with target frame by giving it 50% opacity while out of range.
---
All this time I thought a coon was just short for raccoon. If I heard someone say what you guys are referring to as racist I would have assumed they were talking about a dirty raccoon. I guess that's on me though for not being aware of it being a racist thing /shrug. Kind of feel bad for raccoons getting lumped into this
---
Quartz.
---
Shadow was pretty decent in TBC  though wasn't it?
---
I think mana burn in form is just part of it.  Mana regenerates in form.  It makes sense that it could burn in form too.
---
Absolutely right! The internet, being nearly consequence free allows people to show their true self (and many do in big way).
---
"Good people do the right thing even when nobody's looking." The internet and games like wow really put this to the test.
---
Dwarves are the least played race, according to these stats.
---

Is it ported though? I'm still using RingMenu which is the same but only allows for one ring/keybind.
---
It's label is Chilledtauren. The link wasn't working for me on mobile so I searched for it. I'll be listening to it at work today and later when I'm playing my Tauren!
---
How did you get the dps meter to work?
---
And you consider yourself a good warlock? Careful your plans could go downhill like that guy  :)

dude you can't be serious :D
---
Keep into account there's a limit to how much you can level your professions depending on your level so you'll have to level your alt if you want to raise your profession level cap.  Also, the high level items to gather are in dangerous areas and will require you to have a high level character.
---
Having a gathering and crafting profession has the benefit of being able to gather the materials for your recipes.  Alchemy and herbalism go well together because you can gather the ingredients for your potions effectively reducing their cost to almost nothing. 
---
One thing to keep in mind is that crafting professions are expensive to level and gathering professions cost nothing.  For this reason, when starting out, most experienced players will pick up two gathering classes like mining and skinning to make some easy money early game then switch to two crafting professions later in the game when gold is more readily available.  
---
One thing to consider is that crafting professions in WoW aren't like other MMO crafting systems. There are tons of other players crafting the same recipes as you so don't expect to make much gold while leveling your profession.  Making money with professions is more based on obtaining rare recipes later in the game and cornering a market to produce those items.
---
In the end the most important thing is to find what you enjoy doing the most and just go for it.

I crank contrast up and slightly turn brightness down, so far in pleased with the result

There's a difference between player vs player and player vs defenseless newbie. Bit like kicking a puppy, isn't it?

Did you even read the chat?

Fukkinhel this is me, first time druid tank, BC just launched, Wailing Caverns.

&gt; Hunter or Warlock (can't remember) I know a shortcut, this jump here!
---
&gt; Me: Hang on, where are you?
---
[everyone on group chat: "dang that's a difficult jump!]

&gt; Me: [shammy]! Hol' up! I can see you! Where is the jump/shortcut?

[shammy jumps a couple of times]

[group chat - all 4] the fuck is the tank?

The gnome is red, and now it's dead. Looks like pvp to me.
---
That's super wholesome.
---
Does that mean you are masquerading on here then? Because that’s not directed at you, but at the OP from back in the day. And if your the same person why are you pretending not to be ? Kinda weird.
---
that is how it works, but it isn't true vanilla sadly, truly vanilla the mob tagger got all the exp.
---
It was recently made compatible with classic
---
wts no server with no layers. But low pop advantage
---
Big brain time.
---
As a mage, honestly I agree with this, I don't expect a "thanks" for just doin what i'm supposed to do, but to be honest it is just courtesy and you should always say "thanks". BUT STOP HAVING A FULL INVENTORY, WE HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED THE DUNGEON
---
I was never mad, it seems like Karma justice for me.
---
Some of his own medicine? But you're the one who did the asshole move to begin with.
---
Lol *Little Miss Sunshine* except in WoW
---
That's because it's raid BIS..... You don't use max spells you use low level spells that cost virtually no mana. Since you have tons of +healing your low level spells will heal for a lot and is very very very mana efficient.
---
BIS lists only applies to raid fighting. 5 man instances are different, PVP is different.
---
But BIS lists are 100% accurate for raiding.
---
The cvar for this was disabled in classic. As far as I know this isn't possible.
---
Yeah but its k
---
Thank you guys,   
---
it was first ever raid on Stormwind as a guild we manage to group up like 120 people not all 60 !  
---
There is my stream which shows everything if you'd like to see under my channel - [http://www.twitch.tv/denatherion](http://www.twitch.tv/denatherion),

yeah I tried that for a bit. wasn't worth it though, ended up disabling Carbonite.
---
Maybe in PvE, but in PvP, I don't want to run up to them unstealthed! :P
---
Is this on Blaumeux? I'm pretty sure I ran with a group and killed Smokeyjones several times because he was corpse camping lower levels
---
They're really easy. Concussive, Aspect of the Cheetah, and keep them at range.
---
Hard part is killing them before you either run out of room, aggro a mob, or aggro another player.
---
I never said I would report them, I'm just stating that it is against blizzard policy to be a little bitch and pay an extra $15 a month to  whisper the person who ganked you on a pvp server.
---
These people need thicker skin and less soy in their diet.
---
No.  
---
Edit: The current system is fair and you want the opposite of that.
---
That's not at all what my post was about. I'm not complaining that they left it in the game, I'm just curious from a programming standpoint *how* the checks for "is character outdoors" aren't the same.
---
Maybe people are just blindly using their AH addon to undercut the competition without realizing they set a price that was too low.
---
What addon is showing the enemies cast bar? I’ve tried two so far that haven’t worked
---
I believe the addon is called OGlow, just adds rarity borders
---
Big help thank you!
---
I've never even heard that expression before classic wow  
---
Funny thing is, usually spells don't cleave in games, the term used most of the time is 'splash' damage which means aoe centered around the intended target, but its just aoe spell damage anyway.  
---
though... spellcleave sounds cool. I like it
---
This... scares me a little as someone who’s planning on tanking, haha.
---
Captain... Storm ahead!
---
Sail around it... Says every captain ever :D
---
It's cool if you think I'm toxic. However, for the record I didn't do what you are saying I did. Take a look at the post again.
---
This other guy did though, and then he called me toxic because I refused to invite him to my party for doing exactly what you said is a dick move.
---
I've played on and off since classic but I've always wondered how do rare drops and world drops work?
---
Do certain mobs have better drop tables? If so, as a hunter in classic I'd love to farm them. Also, if they do have drop tables is there a place I can look at them?
---
Taren Mill. You poison some beer and give it to captured farmers.
---
Beware the living.
---
Not trying to be dickish. But I'm having a blast on a full server. All that matters is what you think . Not what others say. :)
---
So is the answer that maybe the macro system is using a later game's version of "is outdoors" and when you actually cast the spell it's doing a different check?
---
I was also thinking maybe the explanation is that the first check that the macro/tooltip uses is a client-side check and when it actually attempts to cast the spell the server uses a different check and says "no you aren't actually outdoors."
---
I loled... thx
---
&gt; I'm not buying these gems, as I've already said I'm trying to sell them 
---
Buy them and flip them at the vendor. It wont be a big profit but it will still be a net gain if you can buy them for less than what you can sell them to a vendor for. It all adds up. It will also get the low prices off the AH and may allow you to list your items higher (or people will keep listing them low allowing you to buy and sell giving you a profit for very little work).  
---
&gt; how can a reagent be "over valued" by wanting to sell it more than the vendor price? 
---
(for the most part) supply and demand will dedicate the market value of items. Perhaps there is an over supply of what ever it is you're trying to sell.  
---
There are LOTS of people leveling at the moment which means there's a lot of people trying to flip items for whatever they can get and the particular market/item you're trying to sell could be flooded. In which case you hold and list again when the demand goes up again (if it ever does) or you cut your losses and move onto items where the market isn't so flooded and competitive.
---
I hit 60 2 days ago after having a 6 day break while i was on holidays.. How do you guys even manage to 'no life' the game and then not be 60 right now? Btw i dont feel like i playd way too much haha :D
---
Western Plaguelands
---
On launch I had almost 5g in profit by lv 15 or so from simply buying auctions and selling them to vendors.
---
So many people posting below vendor value... so many 2-4c profits but multiply that by hundreds of auctions...
---
Extremely well. Blizzard are a bunch of geniuses.
---
Thanks a lot! :)
---
So I’m doing ZF zombie runs and people have started doing a trick where all the zombies run to the podium instead of attacking the person who opens the graves. Is this bug abusing / exploitation and will I be banned?
---
ok either
---
1. Don't play on a pvp server
---
2. free transfer to a server where there are more alliance
---
3. team up with friends or randoms to complete quests in safety
---
4. level in a different zone
---
5. find some people to do a dungeon with
---
many options. Arguing for a change to the games systems so there can be less player interaction in your multiplayer online game is silly.  STV is a notorious pvp hotspot. It's also almost always horde favoured. I quested through there and killed and got killed countless times. slowed down my leveling like nothing else and I loved it. Probably spent hours of in game time running back to my body. But there are Plently of other places to quest that arn't STV.  
---
WoW classic is a big world and its scary place especially when you're a low level. It forces you to find other people so you can get through it. I think its one of its greatest strengths - something retail currently lacks.
---
The what now?
---
"Players have evolved and the game has not. Everyone in Classic will be good at PvP."
---
Shadow won't be accepted into most raids because most hardcore players view it as borderline a meme spec. Once raiders get more casual, you're looking at 1 spot per guild and your main value will be in buffing other locks in the guild, if there's even a significant amount there. 
---
If you can be that 1 guy, it works great. If not, being mage #345 has its own perils.
---
Yes.   Come work for us at Apple / Foxcomm in China.  No minimum age limit required.
---
No that's not what it means. This isn't Wall Street where we have professional brokers who are evaluating the the worth of assets, we're talking about a video game where it's very easy for people to low ball or undersell purely due to lack of understanding. Also you don't seem to realise how damaging this is to the player economy where if people can't profit appropriately, sellers won't participate when they can just save time and sell to vendors. Ultimately this harms the market for buyers too. I'm seeing a lot of assumptions being made here such as "if people are selling low then the item must be in low demand" when this isn't necessarily the case.
---
Yes I don't understand why people do this. Just get to max or near max then worry about stupid sets. I'm 53 and it's slowing down so I dont care too much about leveling anymore
---
Yeah, I’ve been surprised at how far they run while feared and they almost never change directon
---
This is great advice, much appreciated. I guess I’ve really been playing a Druid more as I would a mage, which is clearly wrong.
---
which addon is this for the map?
---
&gt;No.  
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Edit: The current system is fair and you want the opposite of that.
---
For the sake of improving game balance, I would be willing to sacrifice the fairness.
---
That being said, how would you describe my suggestion as unfair?
---
I don’t think he missed the point at all. Why are you trying to sell something that is so abundant? Adapt.
---
Just last night, I went over with my orc hunter to tame Humar and there was a nelf hunter there already waiting, who was clearing the area and seemed to be waiting for Humar. So I helped her finish clearing the area, then I wished her good luck, emoted /cry, watched her tame Humar, and gave her a /cheer.
---
I can always go back today.
---
I have a bank alt I mail BOEs to and play AH on, Ive Done Fairly decent somewhere between 11-14 gold at the moment. And somewhere around 30g on the warrior himself, I just need a hustle spot to farm up some gold/boe drops as well as mining modes worth some loot. I’m around 130mining
---
Why am I laughing at this so hard?
---
Hand of freedom beats all your cc, then the stun you from range so you cant run, then they kill you in 3 seconds.
---
Don't do what? What do you think I did that was toxic?
---

---

Protection Paladin* FTFY
---
That's a reckoning stacked paladin going off.
---
People are convinced this doesnt work in classic. But because of spell batching it still does. You just have to figure it out ;).
---
Went into a group of 5 horde and performed my macro to make all 5 crit me and I one shot a priest hahaha
---
My experience as a mage (back in vanilla/TBC) was that it's infinitely easier to just have people open up a trade window, throw in a stack of water and click trade at the start of a dungeon than look at the group chat, see who wrote that they wanted water, find them, click trade, and hope they're actually paying attention and aren't just charging ahead.
---
Mages should be expecting to give out water to casters during dungeons, just like rogues are expected to open locked chests, warlocks are expected to give out health/soulstones, and so on. And considering 99% of the time you're going to stand around waiting, you can just spend that waiting time making water instead of doing nothing and wait with making water until you enter the dungeon.
---
That's not how a line works.
---
As a hunter who has full and quite good control of his pet, with passive, attack, and even growl keybound, the hate on hunters is aggravating. I understand it's earned, and all I can really do is be a good example and try to grow a good reputation for myself. But man it's like, a 4 mob fight suddenly became a 10 mob fight and no one knows who pulled the extras? Almost always the blame defaults to the hunter. 
---
New hunters: play it safe when you're with a group. I actually just dismissed my pet for a good portion of a recent run, because someone kept pulling adds, and I didn't need the suspicion! Very rarely will someone complain about you not having a pet in a close-quarters dungeon like SM, and if they do you can explain. But they will complain along with the whole group if your pet brings the roof down on everyone.
---
Everyone else just try to keep an open mind that every hunter might not be a derp. If you're jumping onto the big gear in gnomer, or frankly jumping off of any thing in any instance, go ahead and remind the hunter to dismiss his pet first so it doesn't run down and pull 40 mobs. If someone does that to me I welcome the chance to say yep for sure and show that I know what I'm doing. Unless they're a dick about it. 
---
p.s. pull those mobs off the healer with distracting shot, and slowly we will change our tarnished reputation.
---
I think a lot of people are making the same mistake.. Thanks though.
---
You know how people say "they laughed so hard" and they probably just smickered or something?
---
I definitely laughed really hard. That was comedy gold.
---
Some people are quick to anger and can't fucking read. They don't seem to understand how wow chat works either. Almost need to edit the post and explain by spoon feeding the story. It's ok OP I got it.
---
Nah, the evilest thing is mind controlling a gnome so that he stays underwater until he drowns
---
I agree you don't owe em shit.
---
 But... Imo it's the decent thing to do, to keep them on even though your friend comes online.
---
I’m not
---
Are their mages that are actually stingy with water just to be a dick?
---
I thought it was pretty shitty, it felt good to give him a taste of his own medicine.
---
How would a warrior using a shield hold better aggro than one using 2h? The 2h gives you more damage, and thus more aggro. You might take more damage but if he can't hold aggro with a 2h there's 0% he could hold aggro with a sword and shield (for multi mob packs at least)
---
What's the add-on that tells you the market price and the disenchant price??
---
Whole server, each layer had around 3-5k players.
---
I get your point, and it’s silly.  You cannot control how many buyers there are for your gems.  The problem isn’t that sellers are listing them too low, it’s that nobody wants to buy them.  The way to look at it is that the vendor price is too high and the best thing to do now is buy and exploit the inefficiency in the market.
---
I think this is a good write-up by the dude here. I'd say I've had a pretty similar experience leveling up (40 now) -- that's solo anwyay. Yesterday, however, I ran my first dungeon (BFD) with a bunch of other melees (2 rogues, 1 warr, the priest was the 5th) so was the first time I was running WF (the warrior didn't fail to ask me for it a few times before we'd even started!). And, well, I knew going in that I'd have to drop WF often in instances, as a Shaman, and, well I can say that that was true for my first instance experience with WF. So, I tried to drop WF for pretty much every pack, but when out of mana (totems don't cost that much though), of course I didn't feel bad not dropping it (since it's especially the warrior/tank's job to wait for mana for those who use mana), or, if he was making no effort to pull a pack to where I'd last placed (several) totems, including WF, I wouldn't even bother dropping WF then. But, since it was 3 melee DPS (including the 2h wielding tank), I did make an effort to WF as much as I could (within reason -- \~85-90% of packs). Ultimately, for me at least, and I think this is true in general, you want to drop more of your totems the longer you think you'll stay in one spot. And, for tanks, I think it's really nice if they can pull (back) into your totems (within reason, not asking to do the whole instance from the same spot!!). Everyone benefits, including them, since I won't make as many totems (like str/stoneskin) if they don't make any effort to pull back into totems. It's a lot how I pictured, but there are differences in style/play, and, of course, like true good MMORPGs, things also depend on the others you're playing with/in a group with. What's nice though, now, in the later levels, is that people are starting to request shammies for their groups (I guess just cuz of WF), and while I know they might want to "use" me, I knew this going in, and it's also a reason I rolled shaman, as I wanted to be "wanted". I just don't take everything lying down...! :)
---
I've enjoyed the class so far, and only just got chain healing... should be lots more fun to be had... (unironically)! Oh yeah, and last thing I was gonna say, from my prior experience (in Vanilla), every class has buttons/actions they make at (almost) every pull -- for priests e.g. it's SWP, Shield, etc. -- it's like a rotation... I just feel totems (mainly from solo experience) kinda just feels like that "rotation" that WoW Classic/Vanilla has. Looking forward to seeing how raiding goes, though I don't think it'll be that different. Anyway, sorry for long post, just my honest thoughts. Hope they help! gl and hf!
---
A whole lot of these are not actually bugs, rendering the post pretty much useless because there is no evidence backing any of the real ones up.
---
Yes, there is some funky business with feral auras not re-applying after a quick re-shift, yes energy ticks and furor keeping you in combat are weird.
---
Other than that most of this is just vanilla behavior.
---
&gt;Do certain mobs have better drop tables?
---
All mob types have their own loot tables.
---
&gt;If so, as a hunter in classic I'd love to farm them. Also, if they do have drop tables is there a place I can look at them?
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/
---
Find the item and look at the "Dropped by" tab
---
I'm breaking the line for better gameplay. That's the point. It could be argued I'm just making two lined, each faction dependent.
---
My thoughts exactly, especially when the person this guy kicked was the first one in the party and had already arrived at the instance.
---
I was just quoting a meme
---
Idk I'd feel the same way. So many aoe farm groups
---
Two sex number!!  It's a 120/180
---
Some of you need to learn how wow chat works. OP is not the one who kicked for a guildie.
---
You were kiting? Thrash only bugs like this when you kite. It stacks like a reckoning bomb
---
&gt;My guess was right of you being Alliance. XD
---
Yep. If I was really biased I would of just said Alliance should get high priority in ques no matter what.
---
Seems about right. You have time to get some gear, just enjoy the madness in p2 world pvp, later in p3 you’ll have new raid content plus BGs. If you can find an aspect you enjoy, I’m sure you will not be bored. At least I know I won’t be.
---
hah true, I justify it with the kodo's silence though instead of the horse's super-loud summoning noises. But ..you are right :P Hadn't thought about that :P
---
weehoo! :)
---
Curse of Tongues, Immolate, Corruption, Searing pain x20, they are now dead
---
Do you have a source for the Sunder one? I have seen in the tooltip that Revenge does MORE dmg for each rank up, so I have assumed it gives more threat, but honestly it hasn't seemed THAT needed, as I dont have much rage to use revenge anyways, except for when it's a boss or something. And if that's the case, I find it more useful to use my rage on something else honestly.
---
My favorite low tanking times were in SM. Ret aura, thorns, blessing of sanctuary, holy shield, and the best shield spike money could buy. Mmmmmmmmm
---
&gt;If you hate ques so much why don't you go play on a realm that doesn't have one? There are several, but those are probably dead realms to you because they don't have ques? Well I'm sorry that you have chosen this path, but shouting at clouds doesn't change the fact that lines work.
---
I'm never affected by ques. I just think this would improve the game as a whole. I experienced one on release date and really that was it.
---
Lost one to retail, rest of us are still leveling very slowly.
---
Having two accounts is not against ToS, as far as I'm aware. Cross-faction collaboration is, but no one should care about so-called "rage accounts"
---
The energy tick issues happen to rogues too. What is supposed to be 20 energy per tick is often 19 or 21, very annoying.
---
lmao what kind of dumb-ass response is this.
---
Went to Best Buy the second my 2011 was discovered to no longer be able to play wow. Bought a 2018 expecting it to play the game way better but sadly anything above 3 kills the fps and causes the fan to go sicko mode...Thanks Apple.
---
&gt;No one needs food in dungeons
---
Thanks for the name, any other add ons you might suggest?
---
Now keep in mind guys, this is the initial release and some features are still being worked upon. On the other side, its developer managed to complete the port in something like a week, pretty impressive! I'm already using it as my main UI.
---
Which is a #nochanges bug I'm in favor of keeping btw. Melee kiting/ape farming being harder is ok with me and its consistent
---
I was considering to do some stealth runs as feral druid, but since i am no blacksmith or engineer i can't picklock chests.
---
Which dungeons might be more fitting for me? at the moment i am 48 but i can even accept suggestions for level 60. so far running wailing caverns for deviate scales sounds best.
---
I never invited someone to a group and then kicked them when they arrived for a guild member, so no harm done friend.
---
There isnt always time, and im not complaining about making water. Im complaining about people not waiting while we make it.
---
Plus as we are leveling our water can sometimes make 2 at a time
---
Your still biased and showing your colors little lion, you just dont realize it
---
Thanks!
---
This stuff is great, keep it up meng
---
As a fellow Warrior, you're so so right. I log on thinking I can tank dungeons for hours and then if I meet the wrong group it's "ohh I think I'm too busy after this to run it *again*... thanks."
---
I try to keep pace so people aren't bored, but there's always someone in the group who has mana and suddenly doesn't want to wait for the others and goes off to pull something...
---
This doesn't exist in classic.
---
Windfury possibly..
---
Some mobs have abilities you wouldnt expect.
---
What is the add on that shows the price when not at a store?
---
Back in vanilla I farmed Tyrs hand in eastern plaguelands. 
---
You will be killing elite mobs. Great farming spot for boes as well
---
So I had my bags open and pressed ctrl and a gray quality belt started flashing with an orange barrier. What does this mean? I had other grays that didn't react in my bags at the same time.
---
in many ways, I wish I still was 32. Especially if it was my first playthrough of vanilla. Such a magical experience, really :) Hope you'll make loads of good friends and have some fun dungeon-runs up until 60!
---
This is such a silly mentality.
---
Chaaaaaaaaaarrrrrllliiiieeeeeeeeee!
---
I’m a 38 priest with about 35g. When I hit 40, should I stop to grind mount money or just keep questing for it?
---
Some tanking questions.
---
As a 60 Prot Tank what is the best strategy to pull and hold aggro on groups of mobs 6 or more?
---
I have no issue keeping aggro on packs of 3 targets but most of the high level dungeons contain large packs of 6 or more and I'm having a hell of a time keeping aggro on all of them.
---
So far here is where I am.  I'll pop Beserker Rage, Charge in if I can, into Thunderclap, hop into defensive stance, demo shout, blood rage, battle shout then start sundering targets.  But by the time I can sunder enough targets the mage or healer has already pulled aggro.
---
My other issue is targeting mobs in large packs.  I usually tab target because clicking the right mob can be a nightmare sometimes.  Are there any addons or macros that can help with this?
---
Finally are there any macros or add-ons that can help with marking targets or tell you what is they best order in which to kill them in aside from kill the casters first?
---
Thanks so much for any advice, it's hard to find this info on Google and I just want to stop sucking, lol. Tanking is hard.
---
By giving one side an edge on the other?  
---
That would improve the game as a whole?
---
What kind of logic is that?
---
Your enemies have green nameplates?????
---
This is a good idea, you can tell because all the horde flairs seething.
---
Same thing happened to me yesterday. I made my way to SM (30 alliance mage)
---
And i get booted as I arrive.
---
&gt;By giving one side an edge on the other?  
---
&gt;That would improve the game as a whole?
---
&gt;What kind of logic is that?
---
I explained the logic above. Want me to show you the comment?
---
It's on the character creation screen on first login
---
Does look kind of like the monster from Insidious.
---
Still here. Group of us came back from our TBC/WoTLK days and rerolled as Alliance. We’re ranging from lvls 25-35. But it could be broken up soon as most of them are Destiny 2 players now waiting for the next xpac.
---
I also have a level 30 Horde that I want to focus on should the group disband again.
---
Why would I group with you, so I can hear your amazing boasting about how much dps you do with your phat lootz. Like I care, it's not like anything is super difficult at this level of the game. I'd rather play with a weaker player than an asshole, but once again that is just my opinion.
---
But it's not funny because it's 3v1. You can kill people all sorts of ways 3v1.
---
Questie for sure, it shows all of your quest objectives on the map/minimap. I’m not at my computer so I don’t know the names exactly but: there’s one that shows how much items vendor for and another one that will automatically sell gray items when you visit a vendor. I also use one called Titan Panel which puts a small bar at the top of your screen that shows different things like how many xp/hr you’re getting, how long until you’ll level at that rate, how much bag space is free, and the amount of rest exp accumulated in logged out alts
---
Verbal harassment is against, while not ban worthy, you can get a permanent global mute on your account across platform.
---
Is there a way to key bind marking X on a mob? It’s tedious right clicking the enemy then finding the X mark icon.
---
Bro dont talk about alterac swiss like that.
---
Paying for an extra account is ok,
---
Verbally harassing players is not.
---
Our levels have diverged a lot. A bunch in 40s, some of us high 20s and some still under 20
---
I am probably incorrect but I think it may have to do with the built in time it takes the client to get messages to and from the server. The communication is slower (bunches more actions in x timespan before sending) than it is in retail and allows for this to be a thing.
---
SUF allows you to see Target of Target of Target. We must go deeper (but don't forget water breathing)
---
I'm trying to remember, but doesn't this bow actually have some usefulness in Aq once it gets released? I recall that frost damage being nice in there for something
---
Look up Dive's drain tank guide for a leveling build. It should answer most of your questions.
---
Nice ty for spreading the link on reddit, maby u are the gold seller
---
No matter what happens in a Pug run, it’s always the hunter.
---
You assholes lmao
---
Being a spiteful, maladjusted piece of shit, mostly.
---
Eh I guess we'll see. Every time I've been on a new server the same thing has happened, don't see why this will be any different.
---
Kind of a douchy response
---
&gt;Your still biased and showing your colors little lion, you just dont realize it
---
It is biased towards Alliance on my server absolutely. That's why the system has to be based on server populations and not faction. It would benefit horde or alliance depending on the situation.
---
Well, if you're with a warrior you have no good escape options so that makes sense. 
---
As a shaman alone the only way a Paladin kills you is if you're not paying attention to your health/mana.   
---
They simply have no counter to Ghost Wolf, if you know their HoJ is up the correct way to bolt is Grounding Totem+GW. If your health is high but mana is low, you don't even need the totem, just wait out the stun while the Paladin gets off one *maybe* two autoattacks.
---
That is shitty. I suggest you do what my friend did, make note of the name and don't group with them anymore.
---
Because naxx isnt out yet.. also its a tank sword.
---
Ye.. this was cool 1 month ago mate. We see a new dude post this every other day.
---
Hand of Freedom does nothing against a Freezing Trap, and once you're 20 yards away and sporting the Aspect of the Cheetah there's literally nothing the Paladin can do. 
---
At that point the Paladin can't even kill your pet if you're a Beastmaster (30% speed increase, armour and stam out the wazzoo.)
---
Few of them stopped playing, but most are around level 45-50. Myself and one other no-lifed it and have been hit 60 in about 2.5 weeks.
---
Overall a very high retention rate.
---
There is keybinding options for it in the keybinds menu, I set mine to numpad numbers.
---
You find some pretty fukn stupid questions on Reddit.
---
I’m picturing a weeb in joker makeup typing this.
---
Heal or gtfo
---
If items aren't selling in the AH for BELOW what you can get from the vendor then people aren't playing the AH properly.  
---
That's EASY money for only a few mins work.
---
You can thank them for abandoning Vulcan so they could continue putting more effort into Metal/Swift meanwhile OSX uses way more resources than it should.
---
Clearly a teenaged boy
---
And:  
---
"STOP RUNNING" when the heal get the agro and flee far away from the tank.  
---
Just did Deadmines, the heal died that way on the tauren boss, the war dps took the agro, I told the failing druid tank to pass heal middle combat, and the war to keep the agro. Other mistake I saw is pulling too many mobs, people not being autonomous to sheep/stun. Retake agro when the tank has take too much damage and need a break. Using all your mana to heal everyone full life on trash (when they can regen on found. I have shortkey for skull symbol, to give people a common focus, specially on unexpected situations. Dying once full team is around 20min lost running and waiting. Speed runner says making dungeon is worth it, but only if you pass it first time, with a good team. But anyway, some people are new to the game, and we cannot blame them for that.
---
Blizzard doesn’t consider exploited items BOUGHT on the AH to be unfair and thus wont be removed.
---
Either people dumping their goods to avoid removal (shifting gold/items) or they sold the exploited items for RMT knowing their account would be banned(get some money at least, right?).
---
We would have no idea, blizzard wouldn’t know or punish the “poor innocent guild buying the items” and Viola! World first!!111
---
Use your raid icons and ignore people taking threat on a single mob, unless its the healer. Your rogue or your hunter can handle tanking a single mob if theyre focusing the wrong thing. 
---
I've done PUGs for every single dungeon starting at the lowest possible level range as tank and only had a problem with i think 3 groups out of over 50, which I just left after telling them they need to calm down or we wont finish. The only other time I ever had to leave before completing the dungeon was a "dps" warrior 6 levels up on me telling me to hold aggro or I get kicked, as he charges into a pack of 10 mobs for the 18th time that run. I just dropped and let him deal with it.
---
When keeping it real goes wrong.
---
Hey man, great post! Quick note from your friendly wow-playing English teacher: I believe you mean the symbolism of the horde racials, because an allegory is something else entirely. It’s always great to see someone having fun with literary analysis! Keep writing! :)
---
Once again this is a topic covered extensibely since Day 1.
---
If you kite mobs thrash stacks like a reckoning proc.
---
Pray tell, for that looks metal AF
---
&gt;PvP with ppl in your level range in these zones
---
Which has nothing at all do with a player's faction, the number of accounts they have, or anything besides their social conduct. So yeah, obviously you can be punished for inappropriate communication, just like any other worthwhile game. That wasn't what you said though, you were saying specifically that it's bannable to make another account and rage.
---
I bought it last week and I’ve never played wow before. It’s definitely one of the best games I’ve ever played! Make sure you download a quest helper addon called “questie” because the game doesn’t help you where and what to do with your quests
---
Why type "lmaoo" after the game title
---
What is so funny you're laughing your ass off off about saying a games name
---
It would work either way, but yes right now this suggestion would be biased against the horde. Only balanced servers would truly be unaffected.
---
Lol fair, it's one less thing for you to think about. I feel like after the first engagement tanks mentally rank the group in order of most likely to cause a wipe and play the rest of the dungeon based on that.
---
I also have found that a lot of dps do not understand sub roles. If you have a hunter, his other job is CCing beasts and kiting runners. If you have a rogue, his other job is to 1v1 the caster and interrupt it enough to bring it to the tank or to kick/gouge/blindlock the most immediately threatening non-tanked mob. There are more nuanced actions to be taking in fights than just dps when you are a dps.
---
He had to skip buying Blink to afford his epic mount.
---
Was expecting this to be on my Westfall server
---
How is that relevant to the utility of rogues in group pve content? Caster cleave wasn't mentioned in the comment I replied to.
---
Classic only has 1 appearance per race. The whole multicolour druid form thing wasn't added until Cataclysm.
---
Just stash all of your Swiftthistle, Briarthorn, Stranglekelp, and Blackmouth Oil. When phase 2 drops you will never have enough of any of them.
---
Thanks man, some people can't read apparently.
---
Ret paladin does literally 1/6 the dps of a mage while contributing nothing a holy paladin can't. Why would you ever bring one?
---
We're talking about level 5-10, often completely new to WoW players here. You could easily fool them with just being close enough.
---
It works like magic, so thank you.
---
I do want to ask, however, what are the chances it is possible to edit the Energy Bar itself, to switch to your Mana bar when you go out of Cat Form?
---
and if I may stretch this question/request - how remotely delusional am I when I ask if it's anywhere possible to be able to see my Mana while I am in cat form?
---
are those 2 possible? if so, be the gods that you are to us mortals and show us the light!
---
It matters when I’m camping you
---
The game has been out for three weeks.
---
You can raid it once a week.
---
No one was raiding it week one, likely barely any guilds downing for ingots by week two...
---
So you have what... 15 or so guilds running it maybe by week two, probably not.
---
and then its a 30% drop rate.
---
**X** to Doubt
---
SOMEONE exploited for those ingots. Maybe not the guild in question, but whoever sold them.

Anyone have a macro for switching from a two hander to a shield for a shield bash, then back to a two hander?
---
Bro u seen any swucklers around here I'm on the hunt
---
assuming the fight starts at max range while levelling in the open world
---
It's the same for any other language client, chat is basically direct, while clicking an item link makes a request to the server which returns the info based on your client language
---
Sure, but even if the shaman gets it without missing a beat that still buys you time to start casting Fear / Howl of Terror while they waste a gcd on Purge while all your dots tick. There's also the possibility where Demon Armor might eat the Purge instead of sac.
---
Maybe, but it'd be the only tool available to him with a void. Void does no damage, but as well sac and hope it absorbs an attack or two, or maybe even a windfury, before the shaman sees it and purges. As opposed to letting it do, y'know, nothing
---
Just buy out the cheap crap under vendor value. Eventually the supply on the AH will drop because you're profiting off everybody's ignorance, price goes up and you get to sell at your desired price.
---
lmao ok so we have a new argument here  
---
its not against blizzard policy to be a "little bitch"  
---
its not against blizzard policy to pay an extra $15 a month either  
---
but you're saying it *is* against policy to have a second account specifically to harass other players? please cite this
---
And never even feared the first fight
---
This thread is retarded.
---
Yeah this happened to me back in retail Vanilla real hard. And then again in TBC.
---
It was kind of interesting how the only times I "came up for air" was when I was raid-logging and getting bored. Honestly I think having the expansions released was what helped me get over my addiction, no lie. When Wrath came out I was like "ugh, gear reset *again*?! no thanks..."
---
Currently I'm just glad I do most of my work in the Spring/Summer and a bit in the Fall. Now after beign away for work for a couple weeks I actually can sit down and play like the old days. Send help..
---
Go watch the "[Pure Pwnage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yb5CINrC5E)e" episodes where he gets into WoW, it's pretty amusing cause he plays the classic videogamer who thinks MMOs are lame... and gets thoroughly addicted real quick.
---
That was something that popped up on a Blizzard twitter account. It was deleted and nothing has been said since. Probably either a hoax or something they were considering but decided not to do.
---
Stupid people don't get to change the definition of a word. Definitions are set. 
---
A dictionary may update an informal usage due to a large amount of stupid people using a word incorrectly (e.g. "literally"),  but that will never change the true definition.
---
With Unhonorable kills ? :[
---
It gives you more white hit too
---
Lmaoo implies embarrassment about an extremely popular game
---
Also why call it wow classic before establishing they know what world of Warcraft is
---
They were both the most popular games in the world at their peak.
---
once you get to that point sure, but then the paladin will just run behind los and kill your pet and if you recall your pet heal or mount and just not bother with it. Also in an open world sense if a paladin runs up on you while mounted you dont get to have that ranged advantage from the start.
---
You might care when my group is the one doing the world raid bosses and you cant get an invite because no one wants to play with you :(
---
May the Eternal Sun shine upon you!
---
They did that on purpose, do people still not realize this?
---
Swifty?
---
Oh, well maybe don't do that.
---
Smite spec in raiding? Sounds cool
---
10 yards != max range. 10 yards is near deadzone. You've got other problems if you think that's anywhere near max range. They also can't Freedom out of Freezing Trap if they do engage at close range.
---
You have a ton of tools to beat a Pally. You just don't know to use them.
---
you keep making alts like a crazy person until eventually one gets farther ahead than the rest and you decide thats your main. at least thats my strategy
---
u/vredditdownloader
---
Look! It's the guy raging in the screenshot!
---
Definately feral like everyone else said. I'm playing a feral druid myself and I have no problem healing in any dungeon. I usually just throw both my HoTs on the tank after a couple seconds then go into cat and help dps, I can pop out at anytime and heal if need be but except for boss fights with adds or double pulls I've never really had to use more than my 2 HoTs to heal. Or I just use dungeons as a good time to level my weapon skills since I never use my weapon playing solo. 
---
Plus you have the option of trading aggro through both of you using taunt which can be helpful sometimes.
---
That's sucks but it's also the reality of the way grouping works.
---
Fantastic!
---
Don't worry, after you hit 40 gold become easier to make.  I usually have another 100g a couple days after spending it all on my mount.  
---
Just keep questing and run a few dungeons and save all your gold from now on and try to sell your green Bind on Equip items on the AH and you'll each have your 90G for your mount in no time.  Even if you sell your greens on the AH for twice the vendor price you'll be doubling your money from them.  
---
You can always just grind on humanoids which drop silver, greens and cloth that you can vendor.  My advice is to continue questing and if you come across an area with a lot of humanoids around your level and not many other players just put on some music and kill them for a couple hours.  
---
With 2 people you have to split the rewards but you should be able to kill them more than twice as fast so it's actually more profitable if you can find the mobs.  
---
You guys might also actually have a lot of fun trying to grind out the lower dungeons.  Lots of mobs and no competition.  Start with DM and then work you way up.  
---
Good luck and congrats on 40!

Warlocks in a nutshell, I've yet to meet a smart one lol

---
&gt; Especially when it's a melee vs a mage
---
Warrior shouldn't even touch a mage
---
Druids back in vanilla could prevent being mana burned by going into forms, it was a popular strat for ages when hunter/druid 2v2 arena teams were popular in BC or Wrath as well.
---
Nobody cares about LFD and LFR on retail, it's an infinitely small part of the game that you're done with very quickly unless you're the most casual player to have ever casualed.
---
All actual content (M+ especially) happens through the LFG system where you form groups manually and have to go to the instance. 
---
The only difference between it and classic is that you can form groups cross server, and instead of spamming a chat channel you put up an ad in the LFG tool, people apply and you invite them, manually. It's really all the same if we're being honest.
---
There absolutely **are** advantages to the cross-server system: It exponentially increases the number of cool people you can play with, while in the classic system you are stuck with just your server and all the potential idiots on it. I can also get a group for a dungeon at any hour on retail, while if I'm playing early or late on Classic, I won't, especially not on some servers.
---
Yeah. I've got a mental note of idiots going. 
---
But I've met way more nice people than bad ones so far !
---
Going to miss being whispered by a person’s alt after a satisfying gank of their main! On private servers (Nost/LH, at least) you could have both factions on PvP so it was more common.
---
This made me so unreasonably happy to watch him win that roll. Congrats to him!
---
No. The economy is not global. Each servers has its own economy.
---
Nope I stand corrected. I guess it was directed at you the whole time then. Your whole post here makes it seem like your not the one who originally made that post back in the day. None of your wording hints your the same person or that was your post and opinion. If you hadn’t taken personal offence to my comment I would have never made the connection your the same person, now that I know you are the same person just makes the way you posted this seem even more weird. Take ownership of your past post if your wanting to bring it to light again. The only reason I can see you not taking ownership is because it was a trash post to begin with. It was then, it is now. You have some good points and advise in there but the way you want to utilize that advice overall is just counter productive to the results your trying to get.
---
"261MB of addon usage" Holllyyyy fuuuuuuuuuuuck!!
---
I don't care about what is fair or not, I just don't have time for that crap anymore. That, and not some sense of injustice, is why I rolled pve when my main in vanilla was pvp.
---
That wasn't added until a few expansions later. Each form only has one look based on race.
---
The devs want you to branch out and explore
---
I opened a ticket about this issue, had replies from different GM's who confirmed the same things.
---
As of right now, you cannot switch specialization by any method. Even if you were to drop engineering, it won't work and you'll be stuck with gnomish. 
---
They said when the bug is fixed, the book will be available to change specialization. No ETA sadly though.
---
Same here bro. People at work have said I’ve been real crabby the last few weeks. Slept 8 hours last night and felt amazing. Realize I’ve been nickle and diming myself on sleep and it’s been adding up to make me a monster.
---
Comments on protection paladin pvp snippet with paladin pve dps stats.

You sir are not classic attuned
---
Oh that sucks. Thanks for answering.
---
Keep questing. You’ll get greens and such as well as quest rewards. I’m at 39, and at 38 I was at about 35-40g and already up to 60g
---
Might not get it right at 40 ding, but maybe shortly after
---
Then why have BoE's in dungeons?
---
Have you personnally tried it? That's what i wanted to do but a GM told me i wouldn't be able to switch even if i fully dropped eng.

Lowest is 32.
---
How the hell did you make it there and how long did it take you?!
---
Price varies in each server. If you can’t find the exact ring in ah, you can search for similar items. For example if your ring add 5 agility, you can see if there’s same level ring add 5 stamina or so on,
---
Transferred from Kirtonos to Heartseeker yesterday.
---
My thoughts after one day:
---
* I can actually quest again
---
* Finding groups isn't an issue
---
* HUGE amount of level 60s on the servers, bringing their raiding guilds.
---
* Theres still horde for world pvp, but not nearly as dominant as before.
---
* I'm enjoying the game again.
---
This server is actually giving me the authentic classic experience. The people I see in one zone, are the same people I see in the next. Ironforge and SW are abundant with people, trade/general/world is abundant with chatter. I don't regret transferring here in any way, shape, or form.
---
No, from an UBRS I just did with my guild. I'm not the guy who took the screenshot.
---
Actually, it makes sense as it was to help you move through the world and explore new level appropriate content.
---
If you go for Target of Target of Target of Target of Target of Target, it always ends up on some guy named Kevinbacon.
---
It only took 3 horde to kill a gnome?  That must be some kind of record
---
Clearly the definitions of words have changed over time, no? Do I have to provide examples, or is this obvious enough that we can agree on it? Weird that this is getting argued with so much, internet people are so weird.
---
Whose to say I'm not achieving things? Maybe I'm just better at obtaining  my achievements during my non game time than you are.
---
Level as shadow and change to holy at 60. Will make your life 100x easier and you can still heal with a shadow spec.
---
Hey us alliance stalagg players need more players on our side. Feel free :)
---
Hah! Nice! Honestly I’ve been playing classic on my laptop (surface book, I think it’s a 14 inch screen or something) and have been enjoying it just fine. I can’t stand playing retail on small screen, but it feels right for classic.
---
nice! glad you managed to find it :D
---
You would hope that's why, but knowing the people in this sub, I wouldn't be surprised if they don't see anything wrong with it.
---
I transfered from Whitemane to Arcanite Reaper and it was such a good choice. The queue times were just miserable. What drives me crazy is that people are still saying it's a dead server, when we are at medium pop and the server always feels alive. Everyday we get more people, and the server is feeling really solid.
---
Thanks for the post, it's time to stop the server transfer hate!!
---
Maybe in 6 months when people start to invest lots of gold into fun stuff. Rn they are 50g on my realm
---
This is the kind of me me me attitude that winds up ruining the community for everyone. Telling others you should have priority on expensive items is shitty greedy behavior. Congratulations, you made some gold. But you may have just burned a potential friendship in the process. If you want a single player RPG loot simulator, why don't you go play retail?
---
I vaguely remember you saying something about faction imbalance which is going to happen as long as people can make choices.  That's going to happen.  One side is more broken for x or all my friends play x.  That's not going to stop as long as people have free will, but I still don't understand the logic of destroying a queuing system in favor of in your case the Alliance when the current system we have is 100% fair to both sides.
---
Trash mobs easily have room for 3 on bosses you don't immolate.
---
I always give greens that are not really worth selling in the AH to random players that group up with me or just pass by. It really helps a lot when leveling and it costs me basically nothing.
---
A lot of people are like this in PvE servers. Carebear boysssss!
---
Yeah if you’re going to inconvenience me by having me make you water then I expect a tip, but really even like 15 silver at lvl 60 is fine. Just a little something. If we’re in a dungeon, you’re not inconveniencing me anymore by having me make you water. I’d much rather have my healer have a shit ton of mage water and be willing to do small drinks whenever he wants without worrying about money to speed up the group. That shit is on the house
---
That made me smile, very clever haha
---
Was gonna say, Im using it so its out there somewhere
---
Well, I tend to take leadership in dungeon, playing heal mostly as priest, and a bit dps as rogue. This is mostly because I am an experienced player, and if no one take leadership, some stuff tend to go wrong.  
---
\- You need someone to say the strategy to anyone that might have forgotten it (or discovering it).  
---
\- You need someone able to chose a correct team (class, level, armor type).  
---
\- You need someone to mark enemies with a skull to focus dps on one at once.  
---
\- You need someone to kick people when they fail (or are too desync in questing parties).  
---
I think that leadership is not necessary in all case. A group of experienced player does not need leadership. (well the game force you to have a leader, but I am talking more generally). Orchestra have a leader, that allow people to be sync. But it exist a very good orchestra without a leader (aka conductorless).
---
I am not a pala, so, no.
---
I'm typing on a phone, with Swype. Didn't even realize that "an" snuck in there!
---
Nah. Prefer to play only holy
---
Why is she worth paying for? Does she drop bis loot?
---
I spent 40g total, chest and boots were incredibly expensive. But I feel like it's worth it because I'm going to keep the set to chill in when I am 60 and afkin in SW.
---
The spy addon adding fine it is having a second account to coordinate cross faction that is against ToS. You aren't allowed to use any means for cross faction coordination whether that's multiple accounts or having friends using out of game methods. That's one reason why the devilsaur mafia thing that people complained about on pservers wont happen on classic. 
---
If you have the chat logs you can report them and they'll get a nice suspension for their efforts.
---
The mobs  at that area are alliance flagged, so they just dont attack you.
---
Don't blame others for your own shortcomings!
---
That's it, so honestly holding onto it wouldn't be a bad move. In fact, I might snag one now on the cheap so I can avoid getting one at 100+ when it drops
---
They're beasts in PvP. Struggle a bit in PvE with mana and Threat. Especailly in early dungeons, the Shadow Priests who aren't careful to snipe the Spirit Tap procs from mobs are always OOM. I find I wait for them more than any other class when they don't know how to use the 5sr and wait for threat or drink a bit when convenient.
---
For Raids, with the 16 debuff limit, you'll likely see one in a raid. But probably no more than one - Mages are in much more demand. And once a raid gets one they usually don't recruit another dedicated ShPriest unless that first one quits. Shadow Priests are not in their groove yet in Classic, especially not in PvE. They're akin to Enh Shaman where a few dedicated people can make them work pretty well, but that's an Outlier - they're somewhat niche specs, and require a bit more attention than other classes. So yea, to answer your question: you will be having a hard(er) time playing classic as Shadow.
---
There is a difference between definitions that change over time for a valid reason, and ones that are simply misused so often that people want them to change to something that directly contradicts the actual definition.
---
Well I'm assuming it's a standard issue Horde or Alliance map. Both have several settlements and capitol cities on the two continents shown, but nothing to do with any other places on the map.
---
Arrogance? Maybe they pay cartographers to make basic maps of the important Horde and Alliance areas with nothing but rough geographical boundaries (zones) and capitol cities marked on them, since you do the rest by exploring.
---
I had a guy whisper that I could help dps if I was bored, because I was standing around throwing a heal every 10 seconds.
---
I didn't really want to tell him that 75% of my brain was focused on youtube while healing :\^)
---
then you got the chance to set a price for that level of ring 😂
---
I do not understand why the fuck people don't manage their quest log. Do they just pickup every single quest they see without thinking about where it wants you to go?
---
They scale very well with new expansion releases.
---
What was your grind spot 37-40
---
I’ve become rather fond of:
---
Two war, two hunt, priest
---
War tank + dps war + two hunters with two pets. 
---
As long as two rules are followed, its the best (like having 4 and 1/2 dps instead of 3):
---
* Focus the skull (PL must be diligent on marking the next target in the group)
---
* **Let the tank get sunders out for threat** before you go ham with deeps
---
Herod probably is okay in terms of balance,I wouldn't mind playing there(all I hate is the name),but one thing is being dangerous and some imbalance,another is having one faction be 75-80% of the server.
---
And I write those % based on how many ppl transferred last days,after wowhead
---
&gt;Here we go again with that preferential treatment.  Asking for a pie in the sky fix to a problem that doesn't exist.
---
How many times do you need to hear this old man? The entire point is giving one side preferential treatment.
---
And people wonder why I stopped tanking after BC.
---
Gotta hit up moongaurd for that
---
oof, i wonder if there is a more lightweight approach for that. Im not that into weak auras.
---
Oh, you're from Yojamba! Saw you tell trade chat and then start selling the shield after, congrats mate
---
Rogue engineer on the horde side. Go to ally start area with sheep critters. Bring out explosive sheep. Walk a bit. Lowbie attacks it cause hey weapons skills. 
---
Boom
---
And you let her play alliance... parents these days smh
---
That’s one busy Ui!
---
If I remember correctly you earn it, and at low levels it is a bit of a grind
---
Joker by Vortexgear and the mousepad is from Pecham, I got it because its thr same width as the desk (30 inches)
---
Flame shock, earthbind, poison cleanse, searing, and kite.
---
Because we all find something different that is fun for us. Sure I could get Max level fast but I would be burnt out. Instead I have almost max level professions, a set that I am enjoying and while doing the dungeon for that set I met two new friends a warrior and a priest who I have been having a really good time with.
---
When you get to 20, compare the mana cost to the healed amount and see for yourself! You'll notice that not only FoL does more for less, it's a shorter cast time too!
---
She wanted a night elf because of the flips
---
In short people suck. lvling a warrior as Arms is the most sane way, and those people sometimes don't keep a shield on them till the 30s. 
---
What pisses me off is a warrior using a 2h that doesn't use defensive stance for the threat generation
---
What adddon shows peoples class?
---
Quick question, what addon are you using for your backpack?
---
Take care man, do whatever feels best for you. Hope you will feel better soon.
---
It wasn't that bad in TBC. I remember on Nihilum videos Muqq was quite high on dps meters - often in top5-7, while on their first Illidan kill he was top3 even I think.
---
There's a few guilds on arugal oce, both horde and alliance working together to control the leather.  Both guilds are rich af, They're both horrible guilds to be in though and I think alot of the members abused the layering exploits and were banned
---
Use ur fire totems and shocks. Fakecast (cast a spell and cancel it to bait a kick) after that cast heals and continue to attack them with shocks and totems. I think using the right totems will win you the battle. Poison remove+frost shock(or fire shock so he can’t vanish)+armor totem/earthbind for example would be good versus a rogue
---
A Druid can’t really kick you. So just place ur totems and keep ur self alive while ur shocks and fire totems do the rest. 
---
Edit: never played shaman. Maybe  I’m wrong but this is how I would do it.
---
You Don’t want a lock in spellcleave. You’d much rather have another mage. Lock is one of the least shitty replacements for a mage in it tho
---
I'm tanking every dungeon with 2H (zul'farak by now) and most of the time I can hold agro quite well.
---
People start attacking way to early to play s&amp;b. I can't build enough rage to even stand a chance against good dds.
---
The Darkest Dungeon narration made this 11/10
---
As a main mage, I will pump out the water day and night however give me a minute to mana up before the first pull.  Never fails I'm at zero mana and tank goes charging in so I just drink while they fight and then I get bitched at for low dps
---
Don't sound too thrilled about WC3 and 3.5 like they are plot cop outs
---
I absolutely wanted to play a Druid this time around, but it's *killing* me I couldn't play a Dwarf.
---
I agree, but I think that both cases happen and result in the change of words' definitions.
---
Renew is also very mana inefficient for the healing it provides
---
He also named himself Kultiras which is the type of mobs in the area "Kultiras Sailor" etc.  So the troll rounds the corner see Kultiras and the guy dressed like an enemy NPC and then initiates and flags for pvp combat.
---
For leveling go shadow and you'll have no problem healing dungeons as shadow well up into the later levels of the game
---
Haha that's the name of my voidwalker in retail. It's pretty cool.
---
Frekavichk 100%, they think they are brave to stay and don't realize that the layers are going to be removed,and how much will change after that,constant ganking/city raids which they won't be able to fight,always 4-6 more horde in leveling zones per 1 alliance .
---
People think that seeing horde right now is going to be same amount always,even though evem now it's always more of them with layers on.
---
*Mace Windu voice* Not. Yet.
---
What professions should I pick leveling with a Warlock?
---
Is it a good idea to pick Tailoring and maybe Enchanting to mage bags and gear or should I just go double gathering?
---
&gt;has a gf
---
NORMIES OUT!
---
gnomes are the worst
---
Nah I really just got lazy with the descriptions. They’re actually the more plot and lore heavy games. The first two, especially the first, are pretty lore sparse and have been heavily retconned since.
---
Most of the lore from the first and second wars comes from the novelizations. Rise of the Horde, Tides of Darkness, Lord of the Clans, the Last Guardian, etc.
---
I had one experience with shadow priest in SM cath. He actually did very well and those were some of the fastest runs I’ve had. I do agree though, the biggest obstacle would just be getting people to take you over mages/warlocks even though shadow priests seem like great dps.
---
Is it common for everyone to need on this item although they aren't a mage?
---
Which isn't how a line works.
---
I don’t think I bought ANYTHING off the AH in vanilla till I hit 30. I didn’t know it existed.
---
My warlock was in just random gear that “looked cool” to 13 year old me.
---
&gt;People are so salty about not getting in spellcleave groups
---
Really dude? How did you come up to **this**? Holy crap
---
I use Salvation to tell people that they're bad in managing their threat and I'm gonna do that for them now.
---
Good players don't need it and a good group clears stuff way faster with might/wisdom or kings rather than salvation.
---
Gnomes are my brothers too! I give your character a rating of 15 tin nodes
---
1. You don't need WoW Census to scan dead realms. Just create a character on this realm and /who 1-10, 11-20 ect.   
---
2. The realm was Dragonfang where I checked the exact realm population, but on other realms it was similar - like there were less than ten level 60 characters online on each of these new realms.   
---
3. Doesn't matter. At the very same time on Shazzrah realm there were more shamans at level 1-20 online than the entire population of said Dragonfang.
---
So that if the enemy is a keyboard turner/asleep at the keyboard, they lose auto attacks or spells (since neither can happen if you're not facing the opponent)
---
Maybe they want to wear the gear when it's still effective for their level.
---
and this is why I always run a dungeon on DPS for doing it as tank.  People expect you to know the path.
---
Everyone has different thresholds I guess.
---
But I'd agree, you can ding 60 in two weeks by just enjoying the journey and going at a relaxed pace. Being 54 now doesn't flag as nolifing.
---
It didn't get bad until my late 20s/early 30s, then the toxicity ramped up.
---
Phasing=layering? I don’t get t sorry
---
I think it's a great idea. Faction balance helps keep the servers healthy. I don't think it will ever happen though. Imagine all the horde outrage. They would rather be the dominant faction and not have to worry about numbers in PvP.
---
How is what he wrote relates to retail?
---
I don't understand not far evolved people which would tell anyone to do that,when what they say don't relate to "liking"retail in any way,which is btw mostly imbalanced server with 1 population over another
---
Arguably one of the best quotes ever.
---
Are people really complaining about this?
---
Ive been tanking dual weild.....
---
It's one of the dungeons where you could quickly reach last boss.
---
Wow congrats! I did around 60 arena runs and saw the boss 2 times
---
Trifiling gnome! Your arrogance will be your undoing
---
Uhm, hehe..... Nooo? ':)

Any way to make it better? I know people would add ram back in the day would something like that still be doable?
---
I think it’s called bagnon
---
Who cares?
---
Oh some addons like auctioneer can help you to do that, I don’t use addons suggested price bc I always check market price, but this maybe a good time to consider it.
---
6% if your skill is &gt;= 305
---
The other day I was running Cath. We were 
---
mopping up mobs outside of the giant last room and as we finished off a pull I noticed my bear wasn't anywhere in sight. After checking to see she wasn't dead, I spotted her- cheerfully bounding her way *out of the room full of fucking mobs and the last boss.* 
---
I swear to God the look on my face must have been priceless. The petrifying fear I felt then was indescribable. 
---
A few immensely slow seconds later, no mobs followed her out. Nobody else noticed, or if they did, they didn't say anything. 
---
She got dismissed for the rest of the instance.
---
I'm pretty sure my guild goes with rolls if you need it.   
---
Even then, I'm a mage, and with most of the DPS being mage, it'll take a long time for me to get raid BIS. But oh well, it is what it is.
---
If you're going to be pedantic at least speak properly yourself.
---
"Learn how to construct sentences."  Not "learn how to sentence." .... When you learn how to something the something has to be an action/verb not a noun
---
"Learn how to sentence" implies that sentence is a verb.  The only time sentence is a verb is when you are "sentencing" aka sending someone to jail or dolling out some other kind of punishment.
---
You clearly don't mean that they need to learn how to dish out punishment given the context.  So please learn how to use the word sentence appropriately before you correct someone else who did not construct sentences properly.
---
She drops Blackstone Ring which is BIS for all physical DPS before raids.
---
"swords and trinket reserved"
---
Or a paladin if you're alliance.
---
You will have better chances with DKP. But once a week attendance probably won't get you very far in the guild. If they let you in, it would be secondary priority, and then you will probably be bidding on items against people with more dkp than you all the time.
---
Haha true.
---
Google "Jame's Alliance Leveling Guide"
---
That's Bagnon
---
Piss off, asshole.
---
A ring she can drop is BiS for a number of classes I believe.
---
You picked basically the absolute worst spec to solo lvl on a pvp server.  The gankings will never end.
---
How do you know it’s not bugged?  You sound so absolute in your answer. I’ve seen this behaviour with Princess from Mara as well where she stacks her attacks to insta-kill you next time she reaches you.
---
Seems weird the ability would work this particilar way when no other physical abilities stack up like that.
---
I'm not sure if I do it for the same reasons, but my three reasons are for fun, to try and end up behind them at the end of a spellcast so their spell doesnt fire, or to run behind them so they have to keep turning as well and maybe I'll get extra auto attacks off that they don't
---
&gt;Which isn't how a line works.
---
It isn't how you want the line to work. And that is perfectly fine. The majority reading this probably don't want to be affected by it even if it does improve the game.
---
 Think of it this way. Why do clubs let girls cut to the front of the line?
---
Must say I agree with you. We are social animals, but we still have rules and systems to exclude people we don't like or agree with, right? Our society depends on people, but it also depends on excluding certain people.
---
Yeah its 8, I had to go to a lot of different areas to gain minor amounts of xp so I could have pulled this off.
---
We need a 7 Wonders of Classic Azeroth. 
---
I found a few lists, but I say we make our own!!
---
1. Loch Modan dam  
---
2. Twin Colossals  
---
3. Deep Run Tram  
---
4. Karazhan  
---
5. The Dark Portal  
---
6. Temple of Ahn'Qiraj  
---
7. Sunken Temple
---
Don’t put thorns on anyone but tank.
---
Your wife
---
Holy shot that’s some roided up calves there! Especially the ones on the left
---
Yeah but it saves me a lot of cast time and let's me get into mp5 earlier. 
---
You're right I think for non end game stuff where I don't have bis and +heal yet which scales 1:1 from the bonuses
---
Qui-gon would be proud
---
Aren't battlegrounds going to be cross realm?
---
I mean, they allow multiboxing, so I don't see why they wouldn't allow it. More subs = more subs. *shrug*
---
Hahaha,well then there are a lot of "idiots" from Horde which transferred,because they don't want to be on server where there is few alliance per them.
---
Tf are those idiotic numbers come from?
---
Right now it's around 58-42% population split there,whatever amount of people transfer Stalag is always going to be overly horde dominated,and people with brains don't wanna play on very imbalanced server.
---
Most likely a dead server cannot be dead with active and balanced population it is now.
---
Good luck trying to excuse your staying with 0 brainwork arguments .
---
Any must-have addons for a new player? 
---
I already have questie, energy tick indicator and castbar.
---
I sold a plus five str ring for 1.2g but a 2 int and spirit only got 35s. Unsure if just me but meant I could get more from the all one stat over mixed stat
---
&gt;does it make sense to take leatherworking and alchemy on my alt, and just feed materials to him?  
---
Quite the opposite - crafting professions should be on your main, and gathering - on alt.
---
Incredible in pvp when you stack with slam, but you generally don't use it in PvE it's more effective to stack sunder armor or slam spam
---
But you could just level via quests/dungeon spams and outlevel it just doesn't seem worth it to me.
---
Look at Mr. Radiant over here.
---
I haven't met a mage who won't provide water. They make it out of thin air after all.
---
It has about two, and the droprate is atrocious. BGs aren’t for a while and from experience I can tell you twink gear ain’t worth shit right now.
---
Relevance to classic wow?
---
Back in the day I made a Druid.
---
He was super fun to play! I could do all sorts of things - stealth, cast spells, heal myself, yes survivability! I could even turn into a Bear or other things to fill in other roles, it was sooo fun! I leveled up and up and up grinding slowly and enjoying the scenery and the naive fresh hope everyone emanated. Even on our PvP server, it seemed like everyone had a RP name and would roleplay with one another all the time. I'd jump in and help someone questing and loved buffing people and casting a HoT on the run, or Rooting an enemy from someone running away. I was having a blast! Then I got into the 40's and that entire ten levels just draaaagged. Then I sort of lost interest in the game and quit.
---
Flash foward a couple months and I go to a buddies apartment. He and his roomie play. Both of them play Priests. I tell him about how I lost interest playing with my Druid, how he couldn't really kill stuff that quickly and I never made it to 60 and the game seemed fun but was kinda slowpaced. He told me "make a Mage, they kill stuff faster... Fire does a lot of damage."
---
So I resubbed and made an Undead Fire Mage. I was in love. Stuck with it until the end of TBC. At one point I chose to make a Warrior because I noticed they were always in demand for dungeons ... but mostly because they never ran out of resources. I had lost interest in playing my Mage kind of because of the amount of times in PvP I would run oom and die to lesser opponents, oh and and having my buffs dispelled was rotten - so I went with an undispellable, potentially endless damage class. Tried Rogue but I didn't enjoy how little cleave abilities they had and I missed the sound of Deep Wounds and the fun of Charge/Intercepting.
---
And that's how I chose a Warrior!
---
I’m a mage too. I’m currently thinking that I won’t join a guild unless they run DKP.
---
Because the rank 10 PvP gear is all the post-buff itemisation, that might be a decent stop-gap solution once phase 2 drops. Much faster to get to rank 10 than to get Netherwind from 1 MC run per week and it’s not that much worse.
---
I'm finding Elvui to be extremely worthwhile after spending a little time learning how to tweak it. I now have a perfect UI for my tastes and it's got tons of other addons' features all in one place. Very nice if you just learn how to use it.
---
have u tried to run wow classic in wine? because vm have 3d too
---
Sucks DM isn't out so we can get our epic mount.. Might just bite the bullet and save up the 1k rather than wait till phase 2
---
2950 execute? Nice
---
If you know what quests to unlock - classic.wowhead.com have all quest chains.
---
Save your gold.  Wand vs spell damage will depend.  A new level of a spell tends to be a power spike.  A new wand tends to be a power spike.
---
Try a different zone like on eastern kingdom see if it’s barrens that’s the problem.
---
you should always have a shield and a one hander  available (and keep up that weapon skill) but on a lot of trash pulls keeping aggro is the priority, and sweeping strikes plus whirlwind with a 2h helps a lot. and when fighting a caster mob, ac and block arent helping.
---
for warriors in their 40s without a decent shield, theres a badlands quest (at least for Alliance, although it might be a goblin) with a 1400ac shield reward. not bad considering the shield from cathedral is 1500.
---
For gold I guess. It's best in slot for a mage so they wanna make money selling it (or if in a pug possibly get it for a guildmate)
---
That is one weird-looking Tauren.
---
Gz!
---
Oh I don't think it would happen either, for the reasons listed. It would piss off A LOT of people for the sake of a better game. 
---
The only issue I have with the idea that I find worthy comes from the No changes crowd. This wouldn't be a vanilla experience.
---
That being said neither was layering and that got shoved in, so might as well as make a fun post on the topic.
---
40 minute YouTube video incoming.
---
You do know that you can’t run it more than once a week, right? So the entire guild is in the same position there.
---
It’s tough out there for s priest but if that is YOUR class, keep at it. World of logs had the following when I looked at class dps in raiding MC:
---
Mage: 318 dps from 1,946 parses. 
---
Rogue: 297 dps from 1,213 parses. 
---
Hunter: 288 dps from 857 parses. 
---
Warlock: 277 dps from 994 parses. 
---
Warrior: 276 dps from 1,570 parses. 
---
Priest: 254 dps from 76 parses. 
---
Druid: 154 dps from 51 parses. 
---
Paladin: 123 dps from 10 parses. 
---
Shaman: 117 dps from 18 parses. 
---
Huge cliff AFTER priest dps. Still trying to figure out how 10 ret found a spot.
---
As a caster, a wand is crucial for DPS so keep it updated ! 
---
There’s a happy median there to be found for maximum DPS and grinding ability. Bubble dot wand.
---
He knows what you did last summer
---
My Auctioneer mod doesn’t give me a “suggested” action and looks quite different...
---
I mained a lock vanilla just hit I think 20 when aq started the event. Anyway it was always random to my memory.
---
Just better make damn sure you don't accidentally get rid of anything more valuable for the next two weeks after using it :P
---
You won't always clear it in one night.
---
Me and my friend did a duo run of SM Graveyard as a Paladin and Warrior at 36-37
---
Good raw gold from trash
---
Almost always an unlocked chest for guaranteed items
---
Have one person loot everything and vendor it all and split the money
---
Just remember to take it slow and you'll be fine, it's great gold/exp
---
Those aren’t good dds.
---
Druid: “Just give me loot/xp and I’ll do shit for you”
---
From my experience so far, people aren’t dropping hundreds of gold on epics just yet. 300g may have been what it went for in vanilla, but so soon after launch you can’t expect to get that.
---
Look out Azeroth!  Crappy writing and endless plotholes coming your way!
---
The screaming kid is the lifetapping warlock who requests heals. I let one die from self-inflicted wounds and he tried giving me shit for it but the tank would have none of that :D
---
Classic+ for sure, just look at osrs and how well the game turned out to be years later, just let the players have a vote on what's happening next and this might just be perfect, but we'll see
---
https://youtu.be/ec_n2YTdA24
---
I really Hope wow is still going on 15 years so I can play with my son
---
True but again, I’m in the same position as everyone else. I can join multiple runs per week, I’m just restricted to one clear per week.
---
So just the same thing that many do in osrs?
---
/tm 7
---
I was gonna give you advice until the alliance part at the end :p 
---
Jk, but in regards to leveling your wands and spells should be used pretty much in conjunction with each other. Everyone’s rotation is slightly different but at level 16 my current is:
---
PW Shield, touch of weakness (if the enemy is gonna come attack me melee) SW Pain, mindblast, couple smites and then wand to finish off providing whatever I’m killing is around my level 
---
The wand is great for letting your mana recharge while you finish off the targets, but I definitely still incorporate my spells as well 
---
Hope this helps! 
---
Oh and as long as you keep up with using the wand as you level, no need to upgrade frequently! You can do it every 10 levels of so probably and still be okay
---
Thats how it is when a class is the Main tank and one of the best DPS.
---
Maybe they're Tauren 😂
---
Just pick one you want. They get significantly more fun after level 20+
---

I know how thrash worked in Vanilla. Why should I not be sure about it? As I stated, if it is bugged it's been so since Vanilla because it worked just like this.
---
Dumb idea.
---
Omg, thanks.  You just saved me a lot of money
---
Thats really scummy. I get it outside of dungeons. The mage takes some time for me to conjure water, so I give him some money. But in a dungeon? We're trying to pull the same string here. I help you and you help me.
---
This is why there are so few tanks in pretty much any mmo which uses the typical tank/ healer/ dps combo. The tank not only sets the pace, but as the first one heading into engagements, they should know the basics of map layout and enemy engagement strategy. This need is *generally* only filled with "leader" type personalities due to the rest of the party naturally having no choice but to follow along.
---
And all you had to do was realise that I was telling you this "evidence" isn't real evidence, I wasn't arguing that because this video isn't proof of anything, then the opposite of what it shows must be true.
---
Learn some reading comprehension, please.
---
Probably not that long. From ratchet, it's probably like 5-10mins walk
---
Indeed.
---
Funny, I thought the same thing. Except I thought leveling my tongue was fast compared to my pally lol
---
This is amazing!
---
Learn to love the stay command, it's probably the most powerful tool to not be a "huntard", pet pathing is retarded, if you just keep in on follow it will take the strangest fucking turns and pull half the dungeon sometimes (I've legit had my pet run 30+ yards away), however for some reason if you set it to stay and tell it to come back to you it will run in a straight line and avoid all of that.
---
Also as /u/par337 mentioned you need to be very aware of your pet when you're taking small jumps as it might path through a bunch of shit and pull, in that situation you basically have 3 options:
---
* You can dismiss pet, this is the easiest, but should be your final resort as it costs happiness (and by extension money)
---
* You can eyes of the best to control your pet to take the jump, then set it to stay then do the jump yourself, this should be your default until you get more knowledge of the dungeons.
---
* My personal favorite (which granted doesn't work for all cases, but is the superior option), set your pet to stay before you reach the point, such that when you take the jump it gets unsummoned due to range, then simply resummon it after the jump.
---
Edit: forgot to mention, learn to understand how multi-shot works, when you can use it and when you can't, you will fuck up with it sometimes while you learn, but try to identify when it's "okay" to do that fuck up so you can figure it out, most if it comes down to experience with it, however I can give you the hint that in terms of targeting, it's not a cone as the animation would often suggest, it's a chain lightning, i.e. it selects 1 target, then the closests target to that, then the closest target to that that hasn't been hit.
---
For a more in depth explanation you can watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcIibe7kZIo
---
Yeah which is completely fine, I make tips from opening lockboxes or doing transmutes. But if you're in an instance, part of your roles as a mage is to provide food and water to the party. It's a feature of the class.
---
Imagine coming across a locked chest and me telling the group it was x amount or I wouldn't open it. Or if I just opened it up and took the contents because only I could do so? I'd be kicked so damn fast, and rightly so.

On a small pull when you nabbed a spirit tap, 30% is fine. On a big pull, it's really tough

I Think Firemaw is pretty even on the factions, atleast it feels That Way, it is High pop tho, so there Will be queue time on the peak hours, so If you only Can play at peak hours, i wouldn’t recommend Firemaw
---
This is fucking hilarious
---
6% as long as your using bows as troll. 6% using gun as dwarf. Every other race with range weapons it’s like 8.7% so you just call it 9%.
---
alot of times u just don't need the shield, and the extra damage+threat you gain from a 2hander is more useful. but all warrior tanks should have a shield and sword macro ready to pop the instant things get hairy
---
He's the same guy that remembered spamming demo shout to tank.
---
So let's consider the facts that:
---
A) Shazzrah has 5x the server pop that Dragonfang does
---
B) The time of day 100% matters as to who will be on
---
C) Blizzard is not tricking you into switching servers but rather offering you a different experience.
---
OP's point wasn't to say "X" Low/Medium pop server will play and feel exactly like "Y" High/Full pop server, but the the difference is minimal at best.
---
It's prime time right now in the US, with over 200+ people buzzing in SW and another 200+ in IF. There's about 200+ 60's on, as well... all while being considered a low/medium pop server. It's not trying to compare itself to Herod, Faerlina, or Stalagg... servers with 60,000+ players... but it is FAR from a dead server.
---
If playing on super high pop servers where faction imbalance dictates how and when you can play the game, power to ya. That's not how all people wish to play, and that's why these transfers are great.
---
You stated you can only do one night a week initially before you deleted it.
---
what a depressing comment
---
What level are you atm?
---
I got venomstrike on my first run! Had no idea it even dropped from the raid, and used that bow up until level 33
---
It's just going to get worse when the honor system is implemented, it'll be even harder for lowbies to level
---
Funny to see the community so quick to complain that Classic WoW has the unvarnished faults of early WoW that were mitigated over time.
---
Are you already in defensive stance for this macro or would you want this to be a macro regardless of what stance you’re in?
---
I’m not very good at wow tanking (yet) but you can make a macro that applies the target marker when you press a skill (like your charge skill) . I always like to say to my peeps “ please always try to attack the lowest hp mob!”
---
Make sure you get 5 points in the wand damage talent.
---
People *should* tip you for water out in the world. Pay people for their time​, it's only fair. But yeah not giving out water in an instance is a quick way to being kicked IMO.
---
Shadow word pain is #1. Instant cast instant damage.
---
Wand is #2.
---
So your issue is about deterring horde from your PvP server. 
---
If you don't like that, play on a pve server. Rather than push to punish players who gank you.
---
No need to put someone on ignore though. Just say “ no I would rather have X. Hope you find another group “. No need to be elitist and rude about it.
---
Gotta stance dance in and out of defensive with berserker for those sweet sweet whirlwinds.
---
I really like EPL.
---
You do realize that having an internship in your resume is going to get you a job much faster than not having one. Id much rather do an internship for a great company and not get paid than not doing an internship. Like it is night or day differences because having those connections are key to finding jobs. On top of that it's not hard to find paid internships. Most non paid internships count as a school credit so it's considered a class extension.
---
Not worth it, just keep the talents and begin leveling down the tree you want, those talents won’t make a big difference and you’re gonna respec again at 40 anyways so mine as well save it so your respec is cheaper then.
---
Yeah, you're right, I forgot about those two, and tremor. There are so many totems it's easy to forget some of them!
---
This thread is paramount. Up until release it was full of people saying that they were eager to end up like you're describing.
---
Thanks for this shot of reality.
---
We discussed the group loot thing after this run, and we all now agree with what you're saying about why.
---
Lol you think you can read a guide and be prepped to raid heal in 2 hours
---
Sorry can't help!
---
Did OP “twink out” this level 7? OP is a paladin - not the best class against mages, so how was he sure he would get the kill and not simply did to Horde? 
---
Just curious 😋
---
NEVER TRUST AN ELF
---
Idk it’s rather fun to wander into zones that I shouldn’t be just to see the reactions of people who are passing by. I ended up going to the place south of loch Modan and danced with 2 horde guys for a bit as a level 17 paladin lol
---
Shadow word pain has to tick before the mob is tagged.
---
vs Shaman it's all about the succubus or felhunter.
---
Maybe we'll have Classic World of Warcraft Classic :-D
---
I keep re-watching the start because the walking back and forth thing the NPC's are doing was so well done

The middle class in china has more than 100 million more people than the entire population of the US. But I kind of understand what you mean, poverty in china is not really the same as poverty in the EU for example.

Not but I do need 1K at 60.

thats genetics :D i train my calves so hard but doesnt have them :D
---
Happens to me as well, I don’t think it’s a fluke. I think something with leeway makes enemies with windfury mechanics ”store” attacks in an unnatural way. 
---
If this is vanilla-like i don’t know but I heard Shamans also could store wind-furu proccs somehow.
---
You and shittywatercolor should link
---
wow, thank you so much for this thoughtful post, I really appreciate it. So I might just end up staying warrior I made a dwarf so hopefully that will stick. I also really did enjoy the shaman still kinda on the fence about that.
---
Without this drama wow would be bland.
---
I agree with the other person saying that’s usually the DPS just caring about big dick numbers. I would start the beginning of the dungeon by telling your party to focus skull, then x, etc. And keep reminding them if they don’t do it, or stop doing it. You can be nice about it “hey guys please focus skill” 
---
And the macro is really easy /tm &lt;1-8&gt;
---
[this](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20752516452)has the list in one of the comments with the marker number and lists some addons that I’ve never used
---
This is my first time playing WoW, and I started off with a tank. I duo with a DPS buddy, and so far everyone else we have done dugeons with have been very nice and accepting of my sub-par tanking and clumsily trying to take aggro from 5 enemies at once.
---
&gt;So your issue is about deterring horde from your PvP server. 
---
&gt;If you don't like that, play on a pve server. Rather than push to punish players who gank you.
---
My issue is with ratios of factions. The closer to 1:1 the better. I would argue it provides more PVP, so those against it should be the ones leaving for PVE.
---
Would you ever accidentally level up? Or does killing players not grant xp?
---
From how I look at it you're gravely misunderstanding the ability.
---
Look at it like an instant cast ability that adds a buff to the mob granting extra swings once it uses melee. The buff stacks. It has no range because it applies to the caster, not the target.
---
I remember your other video! You do great
---
I hope you came in through the secret entrance
---
sanctity aura helps the ret pally. retribution helps the tank keep aggro if threat is an issue, and devotion helps if they need more mitigation. sanc is fine for soloing of course.
---
Google is your friend.  Exposing yourself on this subreddit thinking there would be help was a good meme.
---
I believe the only way to get rid of that delay is to manually command your imp to attack your target (c-1). I have it remapped to one of my mouse buttons to make it easier.
---
Did you just loot it?
---
Well there is wowhead, icy-veins, google, old vanilla clips, basically any information is available and he "NEEDS" it from here. I am curious on which realm he plays..
---
Warlock. Rogue. Rogue. Not a single Hunter. Why must you turn Reddit into a house of lies?!?!
---
You get this gear ***from*** relevant dungeons spams. There is no reason why spamming SM when you are of the current level would ever be a bad thing.
---
Smart !  but if you got someone to clear the whole dungeon why can't he help you kill the boss
---
If you're so sure go prove them wrong instead of quibbling.
---
And FYI saying "go check" isn't proving shit.
---
It was online-only for achievements and multiplayer, not for single player campaign and other single player modes.
---
IMO the differences between BW and SC2 were significant enough that I would call both games very unlike from each other, both from a balance perspective(we won't talk about that here), and sheer mechanics requirement perspective. Nothing special but my highest rank attained in SC2 was diamond in 1v1.
---
I don't know if the Smash comparison is apt. Personally my opinions on the SC2 launch are different and dare I say controversial. Sure everyone can point the finger and go, oh oh it should have F2P from the start, oh oh oh "you had to play 3 times for the full game" even though Wings of Liberty and Heart of the Swarm put together contained *more* single player content than Starcraft and Brood War expansions put together(and yes people, you had to "pay twice to get the full game" even for BW).
---
But anyways yes, Legacy of the Void going F2P was 6-7 years too late. I would have been in full support of the campaign being something you pay for, but the multiplayer really should have been F2P. The playerbase would have been enormous.
---
Regarding KESPA, I see both sides here. I do feel Blizzard isn't wrong in that they wanted to exert more control over the game *they created*. Yes that's being a little Apple of them, but KESPA isn't in the clear here either, by suddenly sabotaging SC2's release by pressuring the Korean government to suddenly ban sales of the game due to violent content(get outta here guys).
---
So no, I don't think SC2 by any means was perfect - it's not - and there are many, many reasons why I stopped playing it entirely. That's a story for another day.
---
needs a fingerless glove meter
---
Ya, I feel its the barrens and just how spread out everything is. (plus I really don't want to do my totem quest xD) But I think i'm going to go warrior on ally just cause it seems like everyone that's ally is somehow nicer lol. Only down side Is there's not a level 15 dungeon on ally lol
---
Holding up the bar (partly) with your hands may put strain on your wrists - in which case these would both protect your joints AND increase your Strength. Valid selling points.
---
Wand
---
You are a troll, you will use 6% until you replace your Leaf. I’m not sure if trolls get a bonus to crossbows as well, but the one off chromaggus might replace the leaf. 
---
Then you have to balance stats between how much better the gun or cross bow is vs how much hit you have to add etc. 
---
6 for now because you will use a bow. Then once you get a gun or cross bow that’s better you will have to be at like 8.7 so 9.
---
There's legitimate strategy in doing it...
---
Oh right, Purge gets a second rank doesn't it? Forgot those little details as a horde lock.
---
In our guild we now just say "invite me please" and people know that it means please can someone swap layer, this one has 400 people camping the same quest mobs
---
Here you go, before you embarrass yourself any further.
---
&gt;**Evidence**  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;The available body of facts **or** \[***information indicating***\] **whether a belief or proposition is true or valid.**
---
Evidence isn't this magical thing that proves everything with timestamps... Like does this REALLY need explaing to you? Have you never heard of the word being used in a real situatuion before? Why do you need somebody to explain this to you. It's rather sad.
---
You are **WRONG.**
---
Is there an add-on that marks rare spawns on your map? Kinda annoying having to keep tabbing out to look at a janky website to see them, so was wondering whether anyone's made a simple add-on with toggleable rare spawn markers on the map?
---
If you already have the entire experience memorized, yes.
---
please share, this is why i asked the question
---
Funny to back to this comment now that we know that a lock is almost necessary
---
Shadow doesn’t really outperform Holy for DPS or mana efficiency until mid 30s and early 40s. Most of your leveling is wanding anyway.
---
Do you have a horde recommended one?
---
&gt;:D
---
use purge and earth bind totem and you're good
---
Omg you quoted Rorschach, i love you
---
Embrace the shaman tank
---
Drownt him bubs!
---
He probably didn't buy it to save money lul
---
Ya, I had a warlock back in the day only got him to 47 but he defiantly got better once I got past that 20 mark.
---
Looks nice. How do you get that Font for everything? Scrolled a little and seen the Font was Prototype from 1001 fonts. How do you apply that to WoW though?
---
Booty Bay guards sleep on News year's day, due to the heavy drinking.
---
Do the quest for the gravestone scepter wand. You can get the quest at 18 I think, requires you do BFD but it is an amazing wand. I’m still using it at level 34
---
I have some [Viagra] if you want some
---
Just curious-why?
---
There's a ton of DPSers. If I'm whspered by a Mage, a Shadow Priest, a Boomkin and a Ret Paladin (ooof), why would I ever *not* take the Mage? 
---
You may blame Blizzard for their trash-tier design in this version of the game, it's not the players who are at fault that like even 2 Shadow Priests are worth less than 1 Mage. 
---
At level 60 especially I would actually feel like I'm doing a disservice to the other people in my party by inviting these hugely underperforming DPS specs, when there's stuff like Mages, Warlocks and Rogues lining up to join instead. 
---
Also, **personally**, I would find it hugely frustrating to play one of these specs where, no matter how good I am, no matter how hard I try, I will always be worse than even an average player of the good specs. 
---
I don't know why some people find these specs so fun - like is spamming Mind Flay and Mind Blast really any different from spamming Frostbolt? Maybe for some it is, I don't know. 
---
As for the elitist part, whatever. You can look at it another way too: When you're playing one of these specs you're not being a team player, everyone else's run has to be longer and less smooth because you want to play a meme spec. How's that not elitist? 
---
But whatever, I blame Blizzard.
---
Was that Rian Johnson?!
---
Thought this too, turns out noggenfogger does the exact same thing though.
---
The best way to hold threat is to have the most dps. I am a rogue in &lt;ONSLAUGHT&gt; and every war we have at 60 swaps between 2h and S&amp;B tanking depending on the fight. The amount of armor you gain at low levels is negligible so using a 2h makes more sense. 
---
With a 2h, You need less hit, you have higher rage generation and deal more damage. It is absolutely worth the armor loss
---
That was the Time i Unfollowed him. People gave him silver and He complained about it that he only takes Gold. 
---
In
---
Great suggestions, also could include thandol span, statue at booty bay and the gates of uldum
---
It doesnt work anymore because people know how this stuff works but back in the day our group would MC horde in AB and DI them.  Most of the time theyd stand there confused for 10 minutes because they didn't know you could click off buffs.
---
Right?  OMG warrior why aren't you in defensive stance 100% of the time?
---
Uh because I can't hold aggro with revenge procs only.
---
I recommend you set it to passive and have a very accessible hotkey that you use to command it to attack (I use a side mouse button)
---
Jump down in Maraudon. Uh oh, another pack of slimes. Uh oh, another swamp thing. Uh oh, Warlock doesn't even know this is their fault.
---
Ok I was wondering the same thing. Never heard of spell cleave. But it's just aoe? Lol who came up with that nonsense?
---
Golem runs are also great for everyone. Caster bis belt, healing and DPS bis trinkets.
---
If he had asked nicely and kept a civil tone, he would have gotten some tips, yet he is crying out loud as if someone needs to do it.. 1000% NOOB..
---
I dont know the drop chance but doesnt seem to rare.
---
You can keep arms up to 40 no worries man, imho it is even better this way. The problems starts around 55 really when you have to kill undead a on mass but around 55 you can spec prot.
---
Umm I would double check your math. Raid bosses have 315 defense, troll hunters have max 305 weapon skill.
---
Easy fix for this is to make a macro that consolidates pet attack with maybe curse of agony or corruption or w/e you’d like to open with, probably the longest duration dot that you have.
---
fast 1hander and shield 2hand tanking makes healers life hell and dps aswell don't @ me
---
You have to micro the attack command, there is no "attack when I attack" for pets that is automatic.  That said... 
---
You can create a macro that will have them attack when you do an action, for example
---
    /petattack
---
    /cast Corruption
---
Personally i micro attack, because it gives me more control (I dont always want it attacking the target I am casting on).  I bound pet attack to shift-scroll wheel up, and follow to shift-scroll wheel down.  Some people do without shift, but I like having my camera control so I use shift.  Those keybinds make controlling your pet really simple.
---
Someone made an aoe dungeon grinding guide and referred to groups of 3-4 mages a warlock and a priest as spellcleave, so now every twat who’s watched one YouTube video is playing mage thinking they can just aoe everything with no regards for their actual role in the group
---
Okay, few things here. 
---
First, mages and dps for that matter are a dime a dozen. If you want to stand out. Get BiS gear asap, know the fights, know your role. Read, watch, learn. 
---
Second, you're talking about giving yourself priority on gear that may or may not drop in a run. If it does, chances are you are competing against 9 other mages, if not more. Not realistic. 
---
Third, guilds running raids will always give preference to members on anything required through the dkp system this is why it was made. It highlights who has contributed and given the most to the guild. Minus what has already been received, to give a numeric value to say, this person deserves this item this time. 
---
Fourth, guilds with MC on farm will charge you more than 100g for raid BiS. If you can find that, which I doubt, I dunno how much it will cost. 
---
I feel like you haven't played vanilla. It's different to retail where raid and items were dumbed down and made easier to get. 
---
Vanilla was about finding the guild that suited your raid times. Forming a bond with them by attunement, gearing pre raid, preparing for raid, and then working and learning the raid. You can't just walk in there and expect to be carried and just get an item every time. 
---
It took months for our main tank (every tank drop auto went to him) to get fully geared. Let alone dps classes and so forth. 
---
My biggest advice is, realise this is a marathon. Find a guild that suits you, go from there. In the end, it may not be your cup of tea at all. Vanilla is hard work. Retail is a shadow of it, and perhaps people now understand why old school players hated what wow became. 
---
It's not about the gear. It's about the experience. Believe it or not, when TBC came out. Those items we spent months grinding for were replaced with the first green item from a quest reward.

Horde are apes with keyboards.

There is a way its a big ass macro, its on the shaman discord under addons and macros.
---
Makes sense lol...dont think this sham has it in vid.. 46 skill right?
---
Maybe I just worded it wrong. I had decided before release that I'd nolife my way to 60, and then relax. Obviously the game truly begins at level 60, but I always felt like I could just do it at my own pace. Which is to this day very much true. I don't have to stay 'ahead if the curve' so to speak.
---
I appreciate your concern, but you can rest easy. This is sort or similar to starting excercising. It might be really difficult to actually begin, but when you actually get to it, you realise it is not that bad and gets you feeling good after. In the end this is all about me allocating my free time, not all of my time. I still accomplish my real life obligations outside the game. I was just trying to point out that maybe doing something as small as going out for a walk is not such a bad idea, because it just might make you feel better, and you can continue gaming after with newfound energy.
---
P.S. This is from a 'hardcore player' POV who might put aside (in reasonsble terms) their other hobbies or obligations for a given timeframe to get further in the game early. And this is equally much targeted at my fellow hardcore players.

For real...that's the 1st thing to do
---
If your server has low faction population transferring off ruins the server further. Get your homies to play on your server and fix the population issues. 
---
Complaining about an issue and then leaving the server is like me saying don’t kill people and being a mass murderer, it’s hypocritical
---
Playing a warock at level 47 atm - money goes to proffesions atm
---
Heartseeker certainly isnt balanced, its alliance dominated. I see 1 horde for every 10 alliance. Certainly not as imbalanced as stalagg, but the pessimistic part of me feels like all the alliance will gravitate towards heartseeker and horde will go to earthfury.

played wow classic back when it was just wow. was thinking about trying this re-release but haven't yet- so maybe my memory sucks it was a long time ago.
---
I played feral druid for a long time though, and I fail to understand the 'looking at you feral druid' thing.
---
do you mean as a tank or DPS?
---
guilds could argue that a protection warrior beats a bear I guess.
---
but for dps i'd argue that feral was/is the most challenging rotation in the whole game, so it sucked in most people's hands. but played by somebody appropriately geared and practiced with the class? nobody's out DPSing them. nobody. doubly so if your guild has a fury warrior
---
And for some reason they're  on Whitemane
---
it's good to have hobbies but when it starts to be seen as better than real life i think that might be a red flag. also "going cold turkey" and then installing it the very next day... might be nothing but man i feel like a lot of this subreddit/thread is normalizing some unhealthy behavior (not you, just from reading in general.)

This makes sense...if you know the class you're fighting you can exploit their weaknesses

Wait we can character transfer to another server? I haven't played in a coupled days due to IrL things

Do you have bag addons?  Its probably that.

I’d fill it full of the phrases that Opposite factions can read and have it set to chirp them in pvp hahahaha

Can't disengage when you needlessly blow Sprint and Vanish before you even engage seriously.    No Gouge or Evasion used.  Wasted Blind when he only had to wait one more second to re-stealth OOC.  This was a really bad Rogue.

Hahahaha kattfan!
---
As someone who plays Fairbanks, this makes me happy.
---
It used to be like a .05% drop rate back in vanilla-wotlk but now it’s pretty high.
---
they were just on another layer.
---
if youre healing a dungeon, you just turn off shadow form and cast heals. you dont need to be specced for healing to do fine early on.
---
the issues people are discussing are mostly at 60.
---
Why not?  They get the gold they want, and the other person either gets it cheap or if they want to try to squeeze the rest of the profit out of the item they can relist it 7-10 times until it sells.
---
The way you type is really channeling some davie504.
---
The main problems are mana and lack of proper tanking mail gear, so you will take much more damage.
---
ehhh....can't tell if you're being serious.
---
Wait what

Grind the baskilisks and mobs northwest of the Abyssal Sands in tanaris. Good gold too

 "its fun, but mana is rough".

that about sums it up.

Just hit 56 yesterday and my pets are starting to be useful.  Other than bloodpact for dungeons, and the skills that only have 1 rank my pets have been doing shit.  Thankfully the only thing my voidwalket needs is sac.  Saved me about 10g i figured in the long run.
---
On a pvp server Felhunter is great for leveling, it's a great pvp pet when you inevitably are forced into world pvp.
---
Easy. Download clique and healbot then let the game play itself.
---
Their shoot animation with bows is nice too

These are amazing. Thank you.
---
haha ok, yeah i misunderstood. apologies for the confusion, this subreddit just worries me sometimes lol
---
I played on a popular private wotlk server a few years ago.  While progressing through ICC25, I would bring flasks and potions for everyone.  Tanks would get 2 Flasks of Stoneblood and a stack of Indestructible Potions.  Caster DPS would get 2 Flasks of the Frost Wyrm and a stack of Potions of Wild Magic.  Melee DPS and Hunters would get 2 Flasks of Endless Rage and a stack of Potions of Speed.  Healers would get 2 Flask of the Frost Wyrm or 2 Flask of Pure Mojo and a stack of Runic Mana Potions.  I always brought enough to hand out all of this TWICE.  3-4 times a week.  That shit is a beast to farm.
---
I was whispered by a healer last night saying I was the best warrior they’ve played with because I tank with a sword and shield.
---
Truly the bar is set low.
---
Yeah not having an epic mount until p2 and it costing mana and being counter spellable is not even an option.  Sadly i will probably piggy back on other guild locks runs and still get it for the looks.
---
Or not wasted Sprint and Vanish.
---
LoFi hip hop mix - beats to murder horde scum to
---
I laughed so hard at this omg
---
It's always better to be safe than sorry. You shouldn't be apologizing, my friend.
---
Yeah this game will do that to you.
---
I still am playing but I've been really intermittent lately. Just living life, hop on a few times here and there. It's the journey, not the destination.
---
Drain tanking is not the “best” spec by any means. VW multidotting gives more survivability in situations where mobs swarm you and in pvp.
---
The ring she drops is a 1% hit ring and for all phys classes its the best you can get going into raids.
---
As for people charging, warlocks and hunters at lvl 60 can solo princess, however people still do run princess normally.

To skip to a "princess run", you need to get attuned, which is getting the quest to kill the last boss in each purple and orange starting wings, then killing celebras the cursed and turning the quest in for the mara scepter.  Once you have the scepter, on subsequent runs you can create a portal (using the scepter) that leads to the waterfall after celebras, which skips a huge chunk of the dungeon.  Some groups will go straight to princess, but you can pick up a few bosses on the way like tinkerer (who has a nice 1% spell crit sword for warlocks and mages).
---
But the charging for runs is just when you solo it, since warlocks can solo princess for gold, so you can bring along someone who wants a shot at the ring, and then just sell it to them if it drops and make some extra cash that way.

What stats are required that mail gear isn't providing? (I'm not saying you're wrong, I just want to deep dive and see what I can theorycraft)

&gt;I have yet to see a shadow priest in any dungeon. Didn't even see one in the couple MC raids that I did, even though having 1 there is fine. 
---
As a shadow priest, I'm pretty sure this is because most of us just go heals in leveling dungeons for the easy groups. Though I did get in a lock, mage, spriest spell cleave group in SM once. Multi-dots on mobs plus shadow weave to boost me and the lock on the boss fights was awesome. 
---
As far as I'm concerned, play your meme specs and just have fun with it. I'll be going holy/disc once I hit 60 but only until I get Benediction/anathema then I'll be running full shadow for pvp and PvE. I also intend to make my hunter a surv/BM meme melee hunter.
---
Wined, dined, and

Extremely cursed
---
Seems bugged to me. I saw the Princess instantly delete our healer once with what seemed like 6 attacks at once.
---
Agreed, made a rough grind in STV much better seeing Auralea recruiting.
---
I've played horde and alliance on PvP servers previously, hence why I moved to pve alliance (I don't dig PvP when questing). It's never a fair fight regardless of the ratio. 
---
It honestly just sounds like a hollow attempt to make things a fair fight. 
---
It never will be. Everytime I've been ganked, regardless of ratio, faction or what have you. It's either me v multiple enemies or a ??  
---
You need to be patient for PvP to release or re roll pve.
---
Punishing horde for being ganked unfairly isn't realistic or something blizzard would consider. 
---
Why would they pay an equal price each month or receive a lesser product. Pretty sure someone in America could probably highlight a legal precedent to why blizzard won't do that.
---
Fear then instant dots while you run with them because lord knows they are beelining it out of range.  As they run back (assuming melee) immo and refear.
---
I assumed this would be smoothish because everyone playing has played before.. turns out theirs are quite a bit of new new people too.
---
&gt;So since we're straw manning here. Let's say we go to McDonald's and I'm in front of you and my order is like 10 items and your order is a large drink.  Do you get to go ahead of me because your order is smaller?  No, you don't.  Why is the concept of a line so hard for you to grasp without you finding someway to weasel preferential treatment into it?
---
&gt;I'm done arguing with you.
---
You do realize I would get my drink before you....even in most drive throughs they would have you pull ahead and wait to keep the line moving. It's a bad analogy to use. But I accept your concession either way, thanks for the talk.
---
&lt;It burns when I PvP&gt; was always my favorite
---
shut up grandma
---
...are you talking about random strangers, or in dungeons?
---
If strangers do so, tell them no, but sometimes you're forced to do it when you have a mage in a dungeon because you've asked them 20 times and they haven't responded, so I'll keep opening trade until you give me water
---
And that was the last we saw of old Jones

Warrior life is tough, but offers a lot of fun gameplay options in regards to stance dancing!

I was in a group yesterday - my rl pal is a priest he's healing we found a hunter, rogue, shaman.  First 3 pull - I mark and charge.  This is the sequence I get off a clap and switch to d stance hit blood rage and get off a sunder on skull - hunter opens up with multi shot and pulls aggro on all but the one I have sundered, he then proceeds to fd right next to heals so I switch targets to get them off taunt one switch to battle and mocking blow the 2nd meanwhile the shaman earthshocks the original skull and I lose Aggro there I turn back and get off 2 Saunders and skull dies then we finish off the other 2.  I explain I need to get some aggro before everyone goes ham and please don't aoe unless I establish aggro on all move first. 2nd pull exact same thing.  healer friend says in group please don't aoe and fd on me - shaman says this tank sucks literally can't keep aggro on anything....we didn't even respond just left the group and went to do some quests...how do you get to 45+ and never learn the basics of how taunt in a group works...it made me irrationally angry and I needed someone to tell me I wasn't crazy or just horrendous at tanking and your post resonated with me.  If the rules are followed it's so smooth.
---
These don't mean more anymore because of layers unfortunately. Man those layers were a bad idea.
---
funny as shit.
---
I rolled on a low pop server (Anathema) and I’m kind of regretting it because it seems dead. At level 35 now. Is it stupid to re-roll elsewhere or should I just continue on?
---
Yep!
---
Literally happened last night
---
Yeah that's it lol. Warriors LOVE SM. Plus 30-40 questing can be annoying, constantly bouncing around zones chasing xp
---
Maybe the destination will scare you far too much ;) it has 7000 teeth and only speaks Arabic
---
at 60 if you respec to heal for raids then again to dps the rest of the week, thats 100 gold a week. 
---
generally if you are raid healing in a guild youd probably spend off nights doing things like dungeon runs with guildies, or farming duo with a dps spec whos happy to have you along.
---
basically, level and heal 5 mans as dps spec, then when youve settled in with a group when close to 60, youre ready to go full time heal spec.
---
It was, just to see if i can kill her solo :), she doesnt drop anything worthwhile and shes not needed for a quest.

I kinda no-lifed it the first week or two before having a similar revelation.  Take a break for a day or two, find enjoyment in IRL activities for a little bit.  
---
Your toon will be there when you come back and you'll probably enjoy playing more when it no longer feels like an obligation rather than a leisure activity.
---
Heartseeker's already at medium, not sure how it could be classified as dead. I'm still competing for quest spawns/nodes here

This is actually hilarious being that alliance has salvation. Could probably have a shadow priest tank with decent results.

So you'll get a taste of what you want at least, but it will never be a permanent thing.

Earthshaker is not dead by any means. Just because you dont have to contest with alot of players for every quest does not mean its dead. I played on earthshaker and its a much more enjoyable time for me than on the full pops
---
Like the huntard I had in my group yesterday. Had to specifically tell him to stop going after the other mob. Their answer... "Okay I'll take growl off too."  I just sat in my chair raging like WTF WHY IS IT EVEN ON!!!!??????
---
Not that guy, but I started at 9yo, I was mostly grinding with rested exp on many alts, highest Ive got in vanilla was like 47 with my tauren warrior
---
Until you get to higher levels right now you won't make too much off the auction houses on stuff. Everyone is still low levels and no one is buying stuff because they are saving up for their mounts.
---
Shift and mousewheel. You can bind shift and mouse down to recall it. This will save your ass many times over.
---
Isn't it the first pvp rank, so you only need to kill a few alliance for it? I remember having it on all my characters by just doing normal stuff while leveling.
---
So I just hit 54... I've yet to set foot in Burning Steppes, WPL, EPL, or Winterspring.
---
Will the quests in these zones be enough to get me to 60 or am I going to have to do some grinding?
---
Horde have it so easy for levelling areas and dungeon accessibility. Alliance have .... paladins? That's about it.
---
This dude drawing three pictures that are funny, but still look like hammered ass, and he's already making a patreon.

azshara. The nagas southeast are nice, the bloodelves are nice if you have interupt, satyrs are decent gold and drops demonic runes, and if you just want fast exp AND don't care about timbermaw rep, you can slay timbermaw shamans there for really easy kills.
---
Your a fucking legend, thank you for making me laugh!
---
I’m glad you’re having a good experience. I’ve grouped up with so many people and almost all of them have been really cool.
---
Really glad to see some real, positive comments on here. Saw this post last night and a bunch of trolls commenting about how Azeroth needs you.
---
It's like damn guys, yeah it's a fun game and we're all excited. But it's not worth sacrificing or degrading parts of your actual life for..
---
I'm in the same boat as you OP, feel like I'm playing a bit too much (level 38 warrior), and should probably be exercising more and doing more romantic stuff for my GF. Your post is inspiring me to take a step back and focus on that!
---
Thanks brother! Always remember, accepting and recognizing when you have made a mistake or broke an internal boundary is always the first step in upgrading your life! Try not to give yourself too much grief and just focus on doing the right thing that will benefit you the most!
---
Edit: grammar
---
That was it, unfortunately it is dead, and has been for a while. Have a gold for helping me out.
---
It's common practice for the entire party to roll need on epic BoEs to deter ninjas. Seems weird to me, but that's what I've always seen players do.
---
To add, healbot is an ancient addon (doesn't mean that it's bad, just been around for a long time) and all that functionality can be achieved other ways as well nowadays. Elvui+clique has been my go-to for the past expansion and ahalf and it's working great in classic. VuhDo also is a thing but I can't remember if it has a classic version yet.
---
I'm going to guess you're the Priest, and this seems great because even if all 3 split DPS in the most idiotic way you know the Hunters left taunt on their pets and the DPS Warrior is just whirlwinding all day so basically mobs are never coming near you.
---
Wrong. 30

Thanks for ruining my money maker bro.

You need the +defense, for being uncrittable and taking less damage in general. This i think is your main problem, and i am talking for raid taniking, in dungeons you are pretty much there ( the few trinkets, rings, backs and tanking weapons would do the job).
---
Goes to show how many Retailers are adopting not only 1.12 and Classic, but this whole mindless, lazy mentality.
---
It would behoove Blizzard not to make things any more time consuming because a big chunk of their playerbase just can't handle it.  But as a tank, i don't do AoE groups either.
---
What's that term?  Go back to Retail.  Haha.
---
There's a blood elf camp in Azshara that I used to grind at back in vanilla, it's in the north central part of the zone on a hill.  They drop good runecloth and vendorables.  My first world epic dropped there.  If you get bored of them, there are satyr camps nearby who drop felcloth - which will probably sell pretty well on AH too.   I'm only 41 now, but I plan on spending a couple levels there grinding since I missed that zone so much.
---
No need to buy them. if you're leveling, dps harder the shit ain't that hard to kill.
---
It's not a feasible, fair or realistic solution.
---
It's a knee jerk reaction to being ganked. That's the only reason players ever complain about ratios. 
---
The solution is in your hands. Learn to live with it, or re roll to a pve server or server with the 1:1 ratio you're looking for.
---
Buy the cheap black lotus and save them for a while and make money
---
Goood &gt;:)
---
If you've played wow for years, you should already know the basics of tanking just from observing your tank during your dungeon runs. Mainly it's about navigation, target priority (marking and/or CC), holding threat levels and keeping your healer alive.
---
Holy shit. It was probably a joke. Get that sand outta your vagina.
---
I didn't rush, I enjoyed every dungeon at least a couple of times but I didn't farm them for maximum experience. I did only the zones I enjoyed the most.
---
Skill can make a huge difference, time matters a lot but so does skill. I quested on a good route and effectively killed mobs by maximizing my cd's and my resources. That takes skills and it really shows in difference of leveling speed. My mate, a warrior who grinded dungeons with cleaves (fastest possible leveling) toon 9 days and 22 hours to reach 60. I reached 60 in 6 days and 20 hours. I didn't read quest (neither did he) because I already know most but if I read the quests I did it on fly paths. 
---
There is nothing hardcore about my leveling, it wasn't the fastest possible path to take, I didn't abuse layers and I certainly didn't take to exploits like most early 60s did with their raid group dungeon grinding.
---
Everything you said in this comment was just wrong again.
---
Edit: love the downvotes from lowbie plebs who obviously know nothing and got salty because I'm 60 without as much time spent in game.
---
Thanks, that's actually where I'm at right now. Blood elves are nice but there's usually people there for the quest. I've been killing nagas and timbermaw, guess I'll just continue here.

if the hunter gets in combat first and doesn't allow the warr to do their out of combat charge, it should be a free win for the hunter

&gt; rogue, dps war, feral druid, tank, heal
---
Nah as a healer, heavy melee groups usually 100% suck. But not because of DPS. It's because the 4 melee usually don't give a FUCK about priest mana. They think, "Well, everyone's over 80% health, let's PULL PULL PULL!!!!" All along as a priest, I am SPAMMING my expensive lvl 45 water and drinking literally 1/3 of it because now the tank is below 40% health and I have to heal, even though I barely have 40% mana. So I ended up spamming water between every single pull and use over 60 to 80 water per instance because the tank/melee dps can't wait 15 fucking seconds for me to drink. 
---
Also usually in these groups no one is using CC and everyone just takes massive damage.
---
Man that happens way to often, people kill my pet, laugh at me and walk away.You know how freaking much food I go through because of shit like that.
---
That was my thought about the "must be outdoors error." When he complains about druids not being able to shift in certain places that seem like they would be outdoors but are actually not. Vanilla had a lot of areas like this, where you'd think "oh this isn't outdoors? I guess if you say so." 
---
The game is literally coded for those areas to not be outdoors and not being able to use mounts either only furthers that point. Not a bug.
---
I always love it when someone who loses starts trashtalking the winner and calling them shit at the game. They are just admiting that they are worse than shit at the game ^^

I did it a week ago.

Relearn Engi to 200+, go to the book which you can find in Tanaris north of Steamwheedle port, click on it and choose Goblin engi
---
Wow, thanks!
---
That healer stuff is so stupid. If it needs a pocket healer it weak. Every class is strong with a pocket healer
---
bro the idea that someone should have world of warcraft removed from them because they said an angry sentence is just silly, you could just laugh at them
---
Thanks for explaining. So this guy went to the trouble to name himself after an NPC just to be able to do this to the Horde? Dedication level 100!
---
Probably because people these days are the annoying a-holes that like to pick fights with other people for little to no reason other than feelings over a video game. Imagine if this was your parents, grand parents, or a little sibling playing and they were subject to this kind of harassment. Would you be okay with that, or would you be a \*snitch\* for reporting them for shitty behavior?
---
It's not about being a snitch. It's about creating a better environment for people to play in. No one wants to get on a game to unwind and have fun, just to receive harassment and possibly feel like crap about it after.
---
Why are you not wearing a chest piece? I smell a phony, a big fat phony.
---
A geared warrior with a pocket healer is a force to be reckoned with, sure, one on one other classes can deal with them fine, as with all classes

Enhancement is absolute crap in my book. For everything too. Leveling, PVP and raiding. Your pretty much shoehorned into restoration.
---
I'm pretty sure this will reach Blizzard and they will cancel battlegrounds altogether. Thank you for posting.
---
generally when a new retail expansion comes out, buying it gives you a level boost sufficient to start one character on that content. 
---
in any case, leveling in retail is absurdly fast. for the most part, unless you travel very far, mobs are scaled to your exact level no matter the zone, and quests are everywhere.
---
It's a bit ridiculous to expect people have a vendor price addon. There's thousands of players that have never played this game before. A small amount are probably honest mistakes, but let's face it, better vendor addons aren't widespread.
---
ClassicAuraDurations
---
and
---
ClassicCastbars (or something like that, it adds cast bars of enemies)
---
Healers who prefer a smooth run over a fast run certainly hate 2h tanking. If threat was ever such a concern I'd rather take a bear druid over a warrior who should have LFG'ed as DPS.
---
Hey I’m around the level to be able to do ZF. You’re telling me I can get 100k XP an hour in there?
---
My first instinct is that it was a bot
---
I love this camp, however I think it's associated with a quest because there's always people coming by. If this wasn't the case I'd spend the next few levels here. Satyr camps could be good though, I'm going to give it a shot, thanks!
---
Great editing. I was actually beginning to wonder if it was an add-on for a second! Which I now want.
---
I can do this all day.
---
Who drops necklace of galisea , didnt find any information on this blue world item ?
---
Exactly this. When people get frustrated or annoyed it’s because they assume someone knows better and is playing stupid. If you just tell everyone upfront that you’re new/inexperienced then more often than not people will be very helpful and more patient.
---
If you see a priest, run.
---
If you pull packs/mobs one  by one you don't even need a healer 
---
Stupid statements in a vacuum :)
---
I don’t know what that means? We headed back for a second run after repairing and clearing bag space, that is when I took the screenshot. I couldn’t ‘wear it’ because it covered my level when I moused over :(
---
There is literally no way to differentiate doing this "exploit" and legitimate circle strafing in pvp.
---
You're perfectly clear.  If you can stab, stab.  Front, back, from above, from below, doesn't matter.

Hell I executed a player through wall once, that was hilarious.

It was 6 days and 20 hours or so by the time I reached 60. I had the least amount of time played among my friends. Meaning they had 7-9 days played at least before reaching 60 or are still leveling.

Poor guy. Known as the worst lock

May his name live on in infamy

Met this guy in the Barrens. I asked if we could quest togheter, to speed things up. Then we went and did all sorts of things togheter while chatting in Discord, having a blast. He's still the only guy I added to my friend list. He was way more efficient than me, so in the end I was meddling around at lvl 43, while he was raiding Molten Core, but we still chatted. Then I log on and see this. He left his Battletag so we could keep in touch. THE FEELS, MAN!
---
Good luck lmao
---
I never started on classic, but I heard tell it was a pain in the ass at times so I decided to use the log long wait for release to do my research.

This happens to me as well sometimes. Try typing /reload that usually fixes things up for me.
---
True that squats and deadlifts are complex moves that target multiple muscle groups, but they have minor benefits to the wrist flexors. You should supplement those with targeted isolation moves.  640 lbs squat.  Yes I lift.  Also it was a joke and observation.
---
Carry around potions to heal, free action pots as well to ignore the snaring and stuns. I find most of the time the opposing faction won’t mess with you as long as you’re both questing. However, it will happen and finding someone to quest with will better your odds of this not happening as much. Also, avoiding some zones that are overpopulated with enemy faction is ideal. Start doing dungeons if it becomes too much in the open world. Can’t get ganked in dungeons by enemy players.
---
Best advice for you:  
---
1) Downrank Power Word: Shield to Rank 3 (this is the most mana efficient and scaling is 2-1 healing power)  
---
2) Always pre-bubble warrior/druid tanks  
---
3) Make sure you are keeping renew on the tanks with 100% uptime  
---
4) Prayer of healing is your best friend and make sure you are using often  
---
5) Most important one possibly -&gt; Make sure you get the codex for improved inner fire as it lets you share the buff with one player (this should be used on the offtank to make sure you aren't messing with main tanks rage)
---
Make sure you are stacking intellect for spell crits.
---
Warriors are uniquely good with a healer. More so than any class.
---
If you're like me, you will be a good ways into 58 by the time you finish all basic in-zone quests. By this, I'm not including the travel-the-world quests or obviously any dungeon quests. If you don't feel like grinding mobs or doing dungeons (which is a good way to get a head start on endgame loot), there are more obscure chains that have good xp rewards. In particular, I highly recommend the quests in Moonglade that send you to Silithus.
---
What class are you? It's like that dungeon grinding is better.
---
Ugh, there's no fullscreen option on that streamable, and I can't see what's being said at all. Is there a fullscreen option that I'm missing?

Yeah but then you have to use a gun. Not worth.

Congrats Amulek.
---
It is Auctioneer! I disabled some of the other stuff it comes with but ya its super helpful when trying to grind that gold for you 40 mount
---
I experience this loads on Dreadmist EU. It seems to be more common in peak times and usually just within maybe the first hour of play.
---
Sorry though, I have no idea why it happens or how to fix it!
---
I never asked for a reason. Nor do I care. Nor do I think that's even good reasoning
---
People are allowed to play the game however they want. If that validates (vindicates) someone's anger, then maybe that someone needs to ask why anyone should care if he's angry. And also...  spellcleave existing isnt making you level slower. 
---
I only commented here because it's getting annoying seeing people justify their dislike of spellcleave with asinine excuses. And when I saw someone saying it was easy and not complex or engaging, I couldn't help myself
---
Blockadblock.com???? Lol fuck off
---
This reminds me of yesterday were there was a guy level 40 running through Darkshore completely naked and, challenging people 24 and below to a fight 25 and over he would put on his shit and smack down the other guy

Make sure you log out or exit the client before you are kicked when the server restarts, or if you're ever configuring your ui, you can exit the game and log back in to save the settings incase the game crashes.

Don't worry you won't lose your spot in the queue.

That's actually much much worse haha

This has been one of my greatest struggles in wow. Getting people to realize that when I say "I'm a noob" that I'm being serious. Lol 
---
My character is a level 31 mage and all the dungeons are new to me (as is everything else). Someone was spamming yell chat in scarlet monastery asking me for conjured water. I'm like "sure, how do I give it to you?"

The dozen responses were everything under the sun, except how to actually open the trade window. (Which I learned how to do later on lol).

You dont need a guide dude, vanilla is soooo easy even a monkey can finish all content, we killed ragnaros on our first night after farming enough trash to get the water for the runes, we killed him almost before the first dive and we are in green/blue gear.
---
Vanilla is easier than LFR, you dont need tanks at all in dungeons... Just go to the raid and spam some heals, like on golemag the dog tanks might get beaten a bit so here you can spam harder.
---
Classic is a joke, trust me you dont need a guide.
---
I’ve been dual boxing a holy paladin and a frost mage in dungeons for probably about 70% of my leveling experience.  Both are 42 now.
---
As both a dps and a healer, it is astounding to me the number of horrible dps that have no concept for how bad they are.  They almost never actually have top dps.  They spend too much time managing their agro.

To be sure, tanks are occasionally the problem, where no amount of time would get us enough threat.  But most often, it’s dps that time their attacks too early, too aggressively.  It blows through mana on the healer,  forces unnecessary defensive cds of their own, and generally just stresses everyone else out, probably me most of all.
---
Yeah, this is precisely why I don’t listen to guides that say “skip training x, y, and z” skills. So far I have used every single type of “tracking” as a hunter and have also used both, eagle eye and eyes of the beast.
---
Even disengage - the most useless ability because of feign death - is learned before feign death and can be used to drop aggro if need be.
---
The lock isn't a replacement for a mage it's a replacement for a tank depending on the dungeon. Locks are basically there to use Eye of Kilrogg then afk while the mages mash that blizzard key. Safer to use that than to have a proper tank or have a mage do it.
---
Who opens with fire blast ahahaha
---
I'm starting to get a hang of the game. I've decided finally to mainly dps on my human mage. I liked warlock but the two races j tried it on I ended up not liking the zones/animations for (horde zones were awful and I hate gnomes). So I might heal on a priest but for now my journey will be on my almost level 23 mage. 
---
I've learned through my own gameplay and also read that enchanting sucks to level as you level because you decon all your greens for dust instead of selling to get gold. It's TRUE. My enchanting is level 70, and at 22 (and 9/10ths) I have about 4 gold. I could transfer my other 5 gold from my alts to my main now that I know I'm maining her, but is this bad? Am I on track? Should I cut my losses and drop enchanting for a pure gold craft like skinning until I hit 60 when I relearn enchanting? Or is it okay to keep, and since I'm a mage I can make up for it aoe farming or something later on?
---
Edit to clarify: my other craft is tailoring. Also around 70 something just getting into wool. And the reason I'm concerned about gold is of course mounts since I'm not a warlock.
---
&gt;It's not a feasible, fair or realistic solution.
---
&gt;It's a knee jerk reaction to being ganked. That's the only reason players ever complain about ratios. 
---
&gt;The solution is in your hands. Learn to live with it, or re roll to a pve server or server with the 1:1 ratio you're looking for.
---
Listen, if you have nothing constructive to add to continue the debate, I don't know what else to say. Putting words in my mouth and ignoring the argument is pointless. You would be better off yelling at yourself in a mirror. I have presented my arguments. Address them or move on.
---
Did you auction it or keep it to get a good start if you suddenly decide to take up tanking?
---
Paladin tanking is truly a meme in the grand scheme of things. If you get a thunderfury it will carry you into sub par relevance, but your conscience should weigh heavy you took it from a warrior that could've legitimately raised your raids threat ceiling.
---
Also pretty sure attacks can’t be parried when you’re behind your target. For the classes that can parry.
---
I kited the forsaken courier away from the guards and killed her separately. I don't know if someone else took out the guards after that, but she respawned a few minutes later while I was doing the escort.
---
Hamstring, try to kite for a bit to get your bearings,if they're melee I find that disarming people can really catch them off guard; it forces them on the defensive, disrupting the plan they had and potentially makes THEM panic while shutting down their momentum.
---
I had a paladin gank me while I was low and surrounded by ogres and I barely trounced him by hamstringing him, intercepting away, bandaging, disarming, and popping retaliation [90% of low levels will attack into your retaliation while disarmed, but if your health is up for it you can disarm then retaliate. Effectively buying like a 15 second period where they're not attacking you]
---
If they're a caster. Uh. Try not to get jumped by casters.
---
In most cases you wont get away and might as well fight, your only "real" escapes are: imp hamstring proc and mount off, or fear and mount off
---
BM also picks up Aimed Shot.  It is garbage all around.
---
I'd suggest playing a shaman to max level, lots of things sound viable in theory, but once you experience it you'll see why it's not. Early dungeons aren't a problem, but once you get to around SM cath/arms it's a significant downgrade compared to warr/feral (not sure about paladin). 
---
You really can't generate acceptable threat on multiple mobs, if you ES on cd you will oom, if you rely on chain lightning you will oom (it's over 500 mana), lightning shield has a limit on how fast it can proc and again if you keep reapplying it you'll quickly find yourself oom. On top of threat issues you don't have active mitigation like a warrior and you don't have superior health/armor like a feral druid.
---
Healing stream heals 15 per 2s at 60, investing 5 talent points is basically an extra 3-4 health per 2s. Similarly Stoneskin reduces 30 damage at 60, 2 talents is only giving you an extra 6 damage reduction, if you're determined to do it I'd reallocate those points. They are nice background buffs, but you can get them from a shaman healer or even dps, so they're not really a selling point.
---
If you had an entire group dedicated to the idea with the right strategy (let you pull, generate threat by self healing, tab ES and then dps single target only) it would be possible I'm sure to clear strath/brs etc, but that's indicative of the ease of the dungeons, not effectiveness compared to real tank specs.
---
Its not useless while leveling. Int buff every low lvl warrior you see please.
---
I just dinged 60 as Tauren Shaman today. And I regret my choice a bit. I think I should of started with a hunter/mage for that easy farming. Then switch to Shaman later.
---
Windfury/Enhancement are like playing the slot machines. Once every 10 mobs you'll get lucky and get a windfury crit that almost one shots it. Rest of the time you're pretty useless. Even for leveling I couldn't wait to respec into elemental.
---
Elemental is like being a mage except you do nature damage which so many mobs are resistant/immune against, you don't have a reliable slow (earthbind is incredibly unreliable in my book) you can't make your own water. You do have heals but you'll be so mana starved you'll want to be keeping that mana for damage spells.
---
Restoration is good but let's be honest Holy Paladins have a way better healing tree. With the talent that gives you mana back on crit, you just never go OOM compared to a shaman. The only thing Shaman have over paladin is WF and Chain heal. But in general I'd still take a paladin over a shaman almost any day.
---
High pop is definitely preferable, but has it's own caveats.
---
I'm really enjoying the high density almost everywhere I go.
---
Grats! Thats our BiS DPS chest, right? 
---
Super lucky snag, thats awesome!
---
So I’m level 44 as a mage and got my mount and all my spells up to date, I did ulda last night and wondering where I should ponder next? ZF?
---
&gt;Always kill gnome ~~mages and ask questions later~~
---
its fine. however doing quests for your home faction until you get honored will get you 10% off your mount at 40. you get spillover from other allied factions so you can probably still get honored, its just something to keep in mind.
---
you guys will probably go to westfall to quest, and at some the remaining quests will be higher level than you.at that point you might both go back to elf lands to do darkshore and knock out some quests there before returning to finish westfall. loch modan in dwarf lands is also a good option.
---
I’ve been noticing the same. Even if you’re a pretty experienced tank the first time you (re) run an instance usually is a little painful (or at least it has been for me; who hasn’t played the game in about 10 years. The two things that usually I’ve forgotten that have sucked is forgetting the mechanics of trash pull (These mobs do hex so target them first etc) and forgetting where pats are so that you don’t pull extra. After the first run it all comes rushing back and goes way smoother.
---
I usually announce in those cases that I haven’t run the instance in 10 years so I’m going to pull like a grandma and it seems to make people a bit more understanding
---

*tank keeps losing aggro*

---

---
I'm glad it's not just me though! Thanks for taking the time to reply.
---
If I find a fix I'll PM you asap.
---
Take it easy, you're already so far ahead than most of the community.
---
I don't think the solution is "take a break" just go slower, play a little less, maybe go online and some random stuff that it's not leveling, I think that if you reduce your objectives for the night you can have a less addicted play night
---
You probably shouldn’t be prioritizing agi anyway.  If you get a bit of either, it’s not going to be a bad thing.  And it’s probably hard to get too much of either of them.
---
Double check on that item name please, it seems it's not in any database and that's quite strange.
---
Just come to Mograine, hardly any queues and a healthy balance(slightly leaning towards alliance in total, but more highlvl hordies)

this is like continuing to drink milk thats gone bad rather than throwing it out. if its that bad why use it?
---
Got fucked by a guy looking exactly like chaos druids, his name was Fake Druid lool
---
How much do the respec costs go up by each time, and how much is the first one?
---
I think this depends entirely on your class and goals. Sure if you're a hunter with questie add on and following a guide, sure you can hit 60 with 5.5 days played after 2-3 weeks. 
---
If you're a slower leveling class and you're just questing without a ton of add ons it's totally reasonable to have 8 days played and be level 55 after 3 weeks. 
---
All depends on your abilities and priorities. Totally reasonable to have played more and be lower level based on that.
---
Oh god, I haven't done ZF on classic yet, but I was cringing watching that because I knew full well what was about to happen.
---
It is a Sign! GET BACK TO WOW RIGHT NOW!!!
---
But you have seen him
---
And here I am with 3 lvl 20 1 level 10 and 1 level 13 because vanilla is a new experience for me and i had to find the right class
---
I’ve been noticing that a ton lately - ZF at 44 for me was really difficult but ZF at 46 onwards is total cheese mode. It’s amazing the difference only two levels can make.

Did you do quest chain where you need to run between Sentinel Hill, Lareshire and Stormwind?

Thx for the correction
---
So because you don't like what I have to say, or agree with the offer of an alternative solution, which you can enact right now. You don't want to hear it. 
---
I've presented mine in the same sense. Just because you don't agree with them, doesn't mean they're not accurate. 
---
I've addressed them by showing an example, to which you didn't respond to (should I say ignore in your words to be just as dramatic?) as you know there is no justification from what you want to do. And offered viable solutions to the core of the problem, which ultimately is...you don't like being ganked. 
---
If you seriously think negatively affecting the majority of players just because they gank alliance is a better solution than you avoiding the server altogether and finding one that suits your special needs more adequately, then you are the one needing to have a long discussion in the mirror.
---
What class are you?
---
Thank you for the tips and video!
---
Wow.  Folks are using sniper adding religiously on Pagle.  You are lucky.  As long as your server pop doesn’t crater.
---
You do realize BM spec needs fastest ranged weapon possible? How exactly this is "garbage". Until phase 2 you won't see a better weapon (for a BM that is), and even then can be used.
---
Today I paired with another Hunter who's lvl 60, me 53 with this bow. The dude was scratching his head was bugging me with questions why I was doing more dmg than him in the dungeon (on most encounters)
---
Please don't comment on something you have no clue about it. Also the dmg from BM tree comes from procs, not from Aimed Shot. Aimed is filler, not main dmg. Improved Hawk + Fast weapon like hurricane, do you know how much dmg increase is this? You have like 60% up time hawk.
---
Sometimes hawk will proc like 4-5-6 times in a row making your attacks to 1.07 speed, you crit like crazy + the additional dmg. 
---
No clue, right?
---

I completly agree the nameplate thing was not okay it should not show things out of line of sight for example, however I also think the 20y are very outdated. I am however specificly taking about terrain fog, not npc or players.
---
&gt; Ask a GM.
---
how do I actually do this? is it in game?
---
To each their own buddy. I for one welcomed Classic WoW to ruin my already shitty life. Gotta have something in my life that doesn't talk shit, doesn't make me do things above my pay grade, accepts anything that is done or said to it and is 100% consistent. I LOVE Classic WoW.
---
For most people nolifing means nothing but job and wow. Obviously you can spend even more time if you don't have to go to work 10 hours a day.
---
Damn that sucks. Sad day
---
I'd like to add to this a bit. I played shadow priest in vanilla until I ultimately switched to healing spec for end game raiding. I am currently a 52 shadow priest and it's still a lot of fun.
---
Raiding as a shadow priest can be tough to get a spot, and you're basically there to give the warlocks 15% more shadow damage. It can add up to a lot of extra damage for the raid, but you'll only have 1 in the raid at most due to the debuff limit.
---
As far as 5 mans go, I think they are highly overlooked for their usefulness in utility. I rarely do top dps in a 5 man because I hold off on a lot of mind blasts, due to how much threat it causes and I'd rather not pull stuff off of the tank every single pull by spamming it for high dps. Even with the lack of mind blast spams, the dps is not bad at all, I'll typically throw in 1 mind blast after I set my dot, vampiric embrace, and a mind flay. Pop fade if you dot more than one target, or pull agro. As far as their overall utility, I think it outweighs the lack of "OMG TOP DEEPS LAWL!". Vampiric Embrace on average gives me around 50% of what the healer is doing. I think it is *great* for a sustained healing over time. Think of it as being similar to having a renew on every single party member and pet in the group every pull. It is quite a good filler and takes a lot of pressure off of the healer and allows for fairly big pulls. They also have emergency shields you can toss out at any time, absorbing quite a bit of damage and allowing the healer to bring someone up that was about to die. I can't tell you how many times I've saved us from a wipe due to tossing shields out when things get really bad. Shadow priests are also good at removing party debuffs while the healer places their focus on healing. Think of all the stuns and frog hexing that goes on in ZF. Another *highly* overlooked ability that way more priests should use is mind soothe. I have people asking me all the time what spell I just cast on an incoming pat that prevented them from getting within agro range while we are fighting another pack of mobs. That is a little sad to hear, as every priest should be using this ability. It's 70 mana, 40 yard range, and allows you to practically stand right on top of a humanoid before it pulls agro. You can have it on as many targets as you want. They are also great CC on undead, with basically taking the roll of a mage sheeping with shackle undead. Don't forget the 5 second silence. The constantly slowing of mindflay will prevent a mob from running away and grabbing his buddies.
---
All in all, I think they are very good for 5 mans with the amount of utility they provide. It can make runs go very smooth. Just time your Spirit Tap procs and the group will be going at a very nice pace. Also, you can heal a 5 man just fine as the primary healer and shouldn't have any problems finding a group taking the healing role. Don't really need to say much in PVP. They are very strong in PVP, especially 1v1. I do find solo questing quite boring, but I've mostly been questing with a frost mage and that is going pretty great.
---
If you like shadow priest, then play shadow priest and have fun. If you are having a hard time getting invites into a dungeon, start your own groups. You will fill up a group in no time, because people want to run dungeons.
---
How much defense are we talking pre raid bis?
---
Warriors are meat grinders. Much like meat grinders IRL, they're very immobile and have to be fed the meat that they grind. Nobody feeding it and it does nothing, but with proper maintenance and support your meat grinder will shine.
---
Maybe they believe it was naga because they didn't had contact with pandaren yet and that was the best explanation at the Moment, that's kinda how science works
---
Love it. My gorilla is named DomTop
---
Also stop rolling on gear with mostly spirit out from under your healers, since you spend 90% of the time tapping and 10% of the time taking aggro and getting 1shot, never letting the 5 second rule hit.
---
so what professions should I grab for my dwarf warrior? Mining and BS? or engi.
---
When I go stealth, can people see my mechanical squirrel?  I think so because I have been ganked a few times with it out but when I dismiss it then hide I don’t get found.
---
What if you used down ranked spells to avoid the mana issues?
---
I’ve not even made a hunter in classic yet, but I’m doing research cuz im planning on making one as an alt soon.

How are people being idiots. This is just a name used for a comp. Being so worked up over something like this seems more idiotic to me than using a term to describe something. There are a bunch of classes that also have AoE but they aren't specifically spell-cleave classes with respect to the dungeon side of things. Who cares what it was called back then and what it's called now. People like you who take things like this too seriously and want to cause conflict will just cause more and more of a divide in a game that's been a refreshing experience compared to other modern games today. 
---
Just relax. People aren't being idiots, and if they are what do you gain by calling them out on it?

holy shit i am dumb. I thought for sure you needed the previous ranks. I've been buying all ranks of all books when "catching up" on X spell from my non-void walker pets.

Although it's also sort of unintuitive that you don't need to do it, when players need to do it.

That does not render the post useless. There is no way to know for sure whether or not something is a bug right now. Not every time.

I have a lvl 35 shaman with enhancement spec.

Since its almost time to transition to elemental at 40 (maybe 43-45), I would like to know what I should be doing right now to ensure a smooth transition, where should I level/ which dungeons should I do. 
---
I know mail gear with int is a lil bit rare here, but I dont even know where to start since i'm a new player (played vanilla back in 2006 but I was a kid and cant remember shit). I did a couple of SM arms runs today and couldn't find anything.

15 hks will earn you rank 1 (Scout/Private depending on faction) and I don't believe you can decay back to unranked unless you gain like... Zero honor for a long period of time.

Priests are literally the best healers in classic by a mile.

I did this in real classic a lot.  Undead ftw.  I also vividly remember this dwarf hunter that would constantly harass me in shimmering flats.  He got fed to the silithids in the pit to the south west.  So many have fallen to their doom in 1k needles.  I'm am a horrible person.
---
It's not an instantaneous ascension to godliness when a warrior dings 60.  They are gear dependent, and the skill cap is extremely high.  A geared warrior being run by a better than average player is going to be able to give most classes fits.  There are some classes though, that never really have to worry much about them - like mage.
---
Yeah they can.
---
This needs to go to /r/all. Holy shit that's funny.
---
What I like about leveling fishing as a warrior is you're frequently just sitting on a gallon of health potions and just one can seriously turn a fight around
---
I just got dc’d too. Can’t seem to get back on at the moment

Was that a drop? Or did you earn enough gold from the grind to buy that bad boy?
---
Lots of good advice here, but I wanted to add that when getting in close on a lock or priest, make sure you’re in berserker stance so you can break the panic fear with Berserker Rage.
---
Kinda off subject.  Unpopular opinion but generally speaking wow (even in classic) has some very shallow storytelling. The highlights for me are the references honestly. I prefer to just think of it like a DnD game and craft my own world view. The maps and art style are gorgeous and can immerse you in that kind of thought process.

magic
---
&gt;So because you don't like what I have to say, or agree with the offer of an alternative solution, which you can enact right now. You don't want to hear it. 
---
I don't want to hear anything that doesn't address the argument I put forth. I could care less about the ganking topic and it really wasn't even on my mind when making this post. If you want to talk about 1:1 faction ratios and why not having them is better I am all ears.
---
&gt;I've presented mine in the same sense. Just because you don't agree with them, doesn't mean they're not accurate. 
---
So provide some reasoning as to why it is accurate, rather than attacking me with some outlandish claim that I just don't like being ganked.
---
&gt;I've addressed them by showing an example, to which you didn't respond to as you know there is no justification from what you want to do. And offered viable solutions to the core of the problem, which ultimately is...you don't like being ganked. 
---
Like here. I will address counter points to my argument rather than run off on some ganking discussion you want to have.
---
&gt;If you seriously think negatively affecting the majority of players just because they gank alliance is a better solution than you avoiding the server altogether and finding one that suits your special needs more adequately, then you are the one needing to have a long discussion in the mirror.
---
Again with the ganking topic.
---
Let me try to make this simple for you.
---
Do you think 1:1 is better for gameplay? If you don't think it is better tell me why.
---
I can accept the argument that affecting a majority of players can have ramifications on the game. Extrapolate on that and I would be willing to listen.
---
And stop making this about horde and alliance. I clearly stated this would affect population not faction.
---
Yup I JUST learned this right before opening this thread. Been using the voidwalker for so long I skipped a lot of imp training. Decided to catch up my imp for dungeons and yup... straight to fire shield rank 3... blood pact rank 3... didn't even learn rank 2. Shit almost close enough for rank 4... probably should've waited a little longer.
---
Yeah the Horde has tons of quests to kill Alliance friendly NPCs that the Alliance can't heal/buff. The marines in the Barrens, basically all of Hillsbrad, Theramore Infiltrators in Dustwallow Marsh. Its weird because as an Alliance player the only place I remember the opposite being true is the Go'Shek Farm in Arathi, though there must be others.

We share a world with people like this. Negative rude self centered assholes who don’t pick up their dog’s shit, throw trash on the ground, piss on the toilet seat and don’t wipe it, etc etc etc. it’s appalling how most of the comments right now are just outright rude and disrespectful.
---
Saidly I'm not on a pvp server in classic, but in wraith I used to help out low level alliance questing. Throw a dot on their mob and let them know I'm friendly. Until they pull 2-3 then I'd fear them and throw on curse of exhaustion so they couldn't run away, aggroing more watching as they get beat on 5-6 raptors.
---
Come to Ten Storms!
---
By yourself?
---
MB &gt; sw:p &gt; mind flay(when you get it) &gt; pw:s &gt; wand down &gt; reapply pain as necessary(pain/flay and wand combo is a good way to burn them down, shield let's you cast full speed. Pop a renew too while shielded)
---
In a group with tank?
---
Sw:p everything &gt; mind flay &gt; MB tanks target(when it's about 50% hp so you avoid taking aggro) &gt; wand .. reapply pain as necessary and flay any runners(the slow/dot effect can save the group from any accidental pulls)
---
Wand spec and spirit tap to start.
---
Suggest going into enchanting if you haven't already as you can make some decent placeholder wands if you dont manage to get them from dungeons or quests.
---
From dungeons..
---
Cookies stirring stick(deadmines), necrotic wand(SM GY, rare mob drop) are some notable suggestions.
---
Again, you can make wands through enchanting if you cant get these and once you get into the 30s, multiple quests open up that can reward you with wands.

you get it before 20 i think
---
Well he did open with frost shock then drop an earth bind totem... but yes open with fear / exhaustion then gg
---
This thinking is why I hate retail and classes like death knight and demon hunter. So glad they aren't ingame.
---
I just transferred here from Shazzrah and Ironforge is buzzing. Plenty of people looking for groups and entire guilds are choosing this server over many of the others. There are also enough 60's here unlike blackfang which is mostly lowbies from what I could see unless some more recent changes have been made.  
---
Also I made characters on each server before deciding where to transfer. I based it off of balance, Auction house and number of 60's. This one was the clear winner.
---
Was a drop! From one of the coyotes in Badlands
---
Who would buy this, I give them out!
---
Prob rolling with BM until I'm 60 with my Pre-raid BiS
---
That sounds more like people from your region being dumb though. I've literally never in my life seen a warlock SS themselves in a dungeon (although animation shows them SSing themselves in vanilla even when they don't). I also haven't had issues with pet users pulling since the game was very new and nobody knew what they were doing.
---
Mobs will resist/miss you more often if you are higher level, although I couldn't give you the exact numbers.
---
You need minimum 25 honorable kills in a single week to qualify for a rank up.
---
Agreed, fucking Hunters.
---
I’m at Tech school. I have a mouse it’s off screen. This is what I got! Haha
---
My main is mage and I am lvling a rogue atm
---
Every tank ever: Should I check my casters Mana levels? NAH let them figure it out PULL!
---
LookingForGroup will be back in my general chat in the middle of playing a single session several times, not just when i log in/out or make any changes in my ui.  I'm not sure why :/
---
Phony intensifies.
---
Imo children shouldn't watch these cheap bot-generated videos on youtube. It feels super exploitative and most of them are pure nonsense.
---
damn what a bro
---
plus I think he could have taken all that with him to the new server right?
---
I'd honestly go back to Fury and take Improved Slam. Unless PvP is your life Slam is literally better than Mortal Strike, even untalented.
---
Slept 4-5 hours a day for a week without doing anything but play classic and couldn't even hit 60 lmao
---
If you're gonna try hard for something, maybe make sure you don't suck too much to actually accomplish your goal or at least know how much it'll take to get there so you don't burn out with no payout
---
Have more than a teaspoon of brain is what I'm getting at, congrats on sacrificing so much for so little
---
actually yea, must be bugged unfortunately
---
Only if you want a lot of the details. The wikis and plenty of YouTube vids go over it in detail without having to splurge on the books
---
This is the truth from someone who has done it.  They are the same as they were.  If a raid brings one it is because they are being nice.  Your DPS is straight up laughable compared to almost any other DPS class.  You can't DoT, warlocks do way more than 15% DPS than you so shadow weaving isn't a big deal at all and takes up a DoT slot.  If they had decided to increase the DoT limit then mayyyyyybe worth it, but they didn't, so your raiding will be so dumb, just Mind Blast and wand...
---
Healing priest is really the only way to raid or else everyone will resent your shit DPS and giving you any DPS loot.  Good luck rolling on DPS gear as healing....people don't generally like that idea.
---
Undead Spriest in PvP is almost a God though and can pretty much survive until oom, which unfortunately happens way too fast in vanilla.
---
Spriest in TBC is really fun, vampiric touch was huge because it solved 2 major Spriest raiding issues.  You don't go oom so fast and raids will actually want to bring at least one for debuffs and party Mana Regen.
---
If you can get into a raiding guild save all your dkp for TOEP and then dip out to PvP.
---
I rerolled about a week ago, great decision. As much as I'm dreading repeating the early levels on a priest the no queues are worth it
---
Why would you let other people dictate your life in such ways?
---
I'm in the same boat, I've found if you tell them "I don't have a taunt, so if you take aggro because you couldn't wait 2 seconds for my cons to tick I'm going to let you tank whatever it is you aggro." Most of them cool their jets about nuking immediately.
---
Your shots will interrupt your auto shot, so you want to use them in-between. Especially aimed shot. You can get a shot timer add-on that will help a lot. There are lots of guides on the matter and you should probably check them out.
---
Funny thing is that this staff goes for 250g and the vexing cane from ZF is almost just as good.
---
Worth remembering the other player could have logged off at any point during this if they felt uncomfortable with what was going on. I suspect they were laughing their ass off.
---
I wouldn't say it's super easy but it's definitely simple. Far less complicated than what's currently in retail.
---
Ok.
---
150%
---
I was lucky enough just yesterday and found a group that said yeah cool why not. It was for tempel of xxx (the lvl 50+ dungeon!) First time full shadow in an Instance, 1 warrior 2 mages 2 priests all 50 beside one mage, smooth af.
---
So yeah you can get lucky and do your job as a shadowpriest, beside healing x)
---
Nice find, Lemonface!
---
I got complemented yesterday for dismissing my pet 😂 before jumping the rail in the furnace room of VC. Then I looted a 8slot white leather bag and I asked if anyone needed the rogue says "I could use"  /trade 'insufficient inventory space'.🧐how ironic. Lol
---
Alchemy.  
---
You will love this "free" mana potions that you will craft.
---
Gz, happy cake-ding
---
That's because they're calf implants
---
Whoa man I clicked the link and not gonna lie, you are one ugly son of a bitch
---
Cringe
---
I just looted a Flurry Axe (BIS for dpswarrior). Currently 3 listed on AH bid 350g - buyout 400g. Should I hold on to it and wait for more people to hit 60 and the economy to settle? Horde Zandalar Tribe EU
---
Stun lock/sheep lock to peel the healer. Nuke the mages one by one.
---
Yeah I'm sure we had a pretty good one during Karazhan.
---
yes this will auto attack. This macro is vanilla wow only though. are you using this in classic or vanilla client?
---
I love running around buffing people as a mage but don't expect a thank you since usually we're both running and sometimes in opposite directions...
---
But yes... Out in the world don't just open a trade or be all "mage, water/food!" Umm...kindly fuck off with that shit. I'd have given you a bunch if you weren't a dick about it. 
---
I tend to announce or ask if people need any if I'm questing in an area awhile. I like being able to help people. I'm not a great player but I can at least share food/water and portals when I get high enough level. 😁
---
Which addon gives you that damage font?  I liek...
---
I tanked stockade with my Paladin and enjoyed the hell out of it. Two healers, an assist from a rogue and shaman and we killed it. OK, we wiped once, but it was great. Tanking is great as a paladin.
---
Imagine being horde on a pvp server and complaining about being ganked outnumbered
---
I M A G I N E
---
You can 4 man to the arena, even 3 man, and only kill 2 mobs at max. You have have your 5 runs done in a very short amount of time.  Just in case you weren’t already doing that.
---
Tall Gnome
---
How often do you have to do that
---
It's been like a week since then?
---
Nope, no players left on any servers and blizz shut down retail &amp; is declaring bankruptcy...
---
They're implants. Not even guys on the olympia stage have calves like that.
---
all you need is 2500 people on a server to have an authentic vanilla experience. there is WAY more than that.
---
Is there really not worth anything thats BoP? I'm just on the fence. I feel like I could actually put more things on the AH with LW rather than sit on top of the bank advertising that I have certain enchants.
---
Use lower rank spells to keep from overhealing/over using mana.  Other than that, tell your tank if he wants to live, to let you get mana when you are low.
---
I leveled 11 points in MM for aimed shot and rest in BM and it’s been an absolute tits of a time exploding things with those absurd crits.
---
Highly recommended
---
Wow, I've never heard that!  I'll have to look into this.  Do you have to clear the trash packs getting to the room?  Or can you skirt by them and FD to avoid them?  That chest is BiS for warrior too... now I'm starting to have serious thoughts about rolling an alt on a second account so I can farm gear for him.
---
It was more for the shits and giggles but you’re right lol
---
Not a warrior main here... but as a Healer, I still feel this on a deep level.
---
Much love from Rattlegore, For the Horde!
---
Love the GW2 UI!
---
More like a 130 lb marathon runner ...
---
You will melt faces
---
Health stones?  What have you done lately? Summons are for warlocks only.  Soul stones?  Forget-a-bout-it.
---
Mage water is for MAGES.  Why open a portal to org when they can just teleport?  They aren't buying reagents for YOUR benefit!
---
Sheep? Freezing trap? Shackle Undead? Banish?  All for self defense only.  Sorry, tank it yourself.
---
Grats, indeed!  
---
I don't think you can bring items with you, unless server transfer for characters is an option yet. He also switched to Alliance, which complicates things.
---
I don't think you are doing things wrong. The tank is supposed to make sure you have enough mana, but some don't. Talk to him.
---
If it's not the tank pulling but the DDs, talk to them and the tank. If you and the tank agree on a slower pace, there is nothing much the DDs can do, because if they continue to pull, but the tank doesn't taunt and you don't heal them they die - and it's purely their fault.
---
If you find such a tank, add him to your friendslist for future runs.
---
Everything in moderation.
---
Do you lose your items when you migrate or is he just being wholesome?
---
Don't get close to mobs in Nova they'll hit you regardless of aggro and ruin your aoe (like in that clip)
---
Been tanking the whole way up. Wish I'd known this. No one has said a thing and I get thanked for being considerate
---
Try silver dragon
---
Yeah I Down rank and run renew with low heals, but it doesn’t always work. I suspect it’s just that way things are but I figured I’d see if others are seeing similar issues or if there is something I’m missing.
---
One thing that many druids have done is level to 60 as feral, which allows for tanking, and then respec to healing at 60. Not exactly what you looked for, but druids indeed level faster as kitty, which perfectly allows for bear tanking. So it could be a decent fit to give you a bit of tanking too before becoming healer, as you apparently lack experience in that too.
---
Bloodseeker Bats from ZG are 1.0
---
never realized the human voice sounds so shitty
---
As an alliance warlock I've been barely able to use fear on enemy players since 90% of them rolled undead.
---
I think the fear is frontloading it and stagnating the game
---
I knew someone with a similar issue. It's because parental controls were enabled on the account for some reason. Go into your account settings on battlenet and allow purchases on the parental controls. Don't try to turn them off as it takes a few days and is faster to just allow purchases.
---
You on the latest version? Having neither of your issues.
---
this is a good demonstration on deprived brain capabilities during so called "panic"
---
I ask when I need, in post.
---
"You spank it, you tank it!"
---
Nah it still shows in chat that you were invited but have requests blocked.
---
Got this too on my tank.  Are there better 1h before MC?
---
"Are there people playing this MMO" seems like a kind of reasonable question to ask
---
Nah, there is still paladings that cry about persons joking about them in public.
---
I've done 40 runs for hoj. Will be continuing, so it's up to you man some of us will grind for what we want lol.
---
Until they chase you across the world map and back with their main...
---
I have been experiencing this a lot as I'm leveling. "Wait did something just fear my vw? Oh... No he's just taking a stroll. He's coming back but oh look! 3 more mobs to fear juggle on half a tank of Mana! THANKS BUDDY!"
---
Well that explains it, try jumping a geared 60 arms as a Rogue instead of your mage and get back to me
---
Please add him to a no summon, no portal, no conjured food list.
---
Making horde quit gives the best chance for server faction balance
---
Come ZT, best classic experience.
---
Without a bunch of +spell damage (which you probably won't have with gear focused on tanking) downranking would make the threat issues even worse.
---
Wait you thought that was a serious comment?

That site says rogues can use 2h axes lol.. this patch of classic is rogues get +2 atp per agi, just go to the AH and get a single agi piece and put it on/off
---
Vuhdo has a classic version. (Currently using it.)
---
Warrs have an in combat charge as well. Hunters are easy pickings for melee dps
---
If someone takes the Time to insult you with an alt, you probably did some very annoying/harassing shit, only in game.
---
Waiting to level enchanting till you are max level isn't going to affect you much, not like you can't get another enchanter to enchant you.  Sell your greens and other stuff till you can get your first mount, then worry about your professions.  Once you are max level it is much easier to acquire funds to finish your professions off, and still save for your epic riding at the same time.
---
Alright let me tell you. As a mage (considering you are frost) you are the thougest opponent for warriors. Even though you are clothie and squishy af, it all comes down to your ability to lock them at one place and keeping them away from you. Yes, they are and always will be an easy target for you considering 1v1 scenario. There is however a potion called Free Action Potion that makes you imunne to any slow effect for 30s. Me as warrior I always keep some in my bag exclusively for mages. I was able to beat 58lvl frost mage in a fair duel as 52lvl warrior! Since i was imunne to all his frost novas and slow effects, he couldnt stop me and well, warrior is kinda superior to mage in a melee range. This can very easily turn the tides and suddenly warrior becomes your greatest threat. As a rogue on the other hand, you have huuge spike damage early game. Warriors need equip to deal damagr, rogues dont. Therefore in early game, you can pretty much kill warriors through the stunlock and deal massive damage to them. This will get harder as the game progress to the point, that your only chance to beat warrior in a fair duel will be to pop all the cooldowns and dance around him in a "dead zone" where he cannot attacks you, nor use charge. This tactic is very hard to master and if you arent one of the pro rogues out there, you wont be able to do it without a mistake. Plus due to melee leeway implementation, this tactic might not be viable after all. Hope i clarified a bit.
---
I lke to think of blueberries as big stupid puppies. That really love making friends.
---
As a shaman I usually just /laugh at them
---
Yes I do this also. Important to repay the favor or avoid inviting baddies into runs.
---
There's an addon that lets you make notes on people without adding them as a friend, and the notes show up everytime you meet them. It's called Character Notes
---
Free action potions help
---
Agreeing this is intended she does a windfury if you are in melee but just outside her melee range. If she's going to hit you, commit to it and let her hit you. If you try to kite like 1-3 yards outside her melee, be ready for a giant windfury. The attack even has a different animation and sound.
---
how much would we have to collect to get Morgan Freeman to narrate one of these addons....
---
Use it to your favor, use it to quest in. Or ask in world chat for a layer hop.
---
My god did i do this alot lol
---
I wonder if it will work if I could find a download of it, given that it's an older version of the game now...
---
Hunter! WTF! Why did u roll need on this shield??
---
Hey guys classic wow is so easy. All you have to do is play 40+ hours a week for a few weeks, get enough gear to do raids, then go in and do Rag in one night. Haha, guys is just really simple.
---
Tbh, being a healer is the easy mode. With healbot you literally just click a frame when it starts to get low. You can brain dead the entire raid and not even know a single thing that’s happening and still do well as a priest.
---
That's odd, your tabbard is tucked into your pants? I thought it only did that with dresses?
---
"I'm a good hunter, that won't happen"
---
-Every hunter ever
---
quest wars
---
As a warrior tank I laughed audibly.
---
If they really cared they would do what blizzard does best, put a shitton of invisible walls around the exploitable parts lol
---
Every HUNTER should know: Scroll up to send pet in scroll down pet to come back...
---
my warlock friend jested at me about how I have to spend fish scales for water breathing and he can't... but then we discovered that apparently shaman's water breathing is considered a more powerful spell than a warlock's.
---
Warrior is very VERY gear dependent, so leveling it's painful as hell filled with a ton of downtime to refill your resources.
---
If warrior is truly fun for you, just gotta survive through the pain.
---
That's a classic spot right there. I remember doing exactly the same grind in 2006.
---
So when you googled "WoW classic priest guide" this is what google told you? Savage. Who knew search engines had such strong feelings about classic.
---
Can I ask a really really dumb question regarding mods on the twitch app?
---
I'm trying to download auctionator but each version I get is "outdated".
---
Which version do I need to download to get it to work? I went back to the oldest version of the mod but it says it's for WoW patch 2.0 which is past the classic wow 1.12.
---
Can someone ELI5? Or ELI an idiot?
---
Nah you don't get xp in bgs in classic. Just keep your Twink in capital and you'll never level up. You also can't lock your lvl so bgs aren't separated.
---
its fine for whole game, only raid tanking requires points in prot
---
What addons is tracking the last seen market price etc.?
---
Fury.
---
&gt; what kind of person gets their kicks from that  
---
Sadists
---
Honestly seems like a stupid question. Just go to twitch and see the top games or google it. Kind of a dumb thing to ask.
---
Well they literally are the leader...
---
Like they go first...
---
One Time shaman asked me for food. Gave him stack of water and food. After that he said he wants 4 stacks More xD
---
I remember it being easier to leash with mind flay on a feared target in vanilla. Definitely not the case now, you get one mind flay and the target is out of range.
---
I’m a lvl28 Druid. I’m leveling as feral but I plan on being a healer when I get to level 60. Is there a certain level I should be respecing to resto? Or am I good to stay feral and just switch gear for healing dungeons?
---
Yeah combat is quite awful for pvp. Sucks losing most ganks but for me it's been worth it for the pve. 
---
Damage is insane.
---
Look at this guy and his observation. 610 is nothing. 
---
When I’m in the gym I’ll just blackout and deadlift like 8 plates
---
BetterFont
---
Yeah would be great if you could like dismiss it or something.
---
That'd be a great QoL change.
---
Wat, no. You get it at level 12 lol
---
You can sheep a warrior and wait out the potion
---
Or.. the person is an asshole, maybe?
---
If a player corpse despawns (and leaves no skeleton behind) does that mean they layer hopped or they logged out?
---
I know their body is *supposed* to remain if they logged but I don't know how it works in classic.
---
I want to do this but need the daggers from raiding to make it more viable. Also combat daggers vs combat swords fps in raids is not that good. Sucks to not be able to play how you want to get the things you want lol.
---
It's an add-on that allows you to click people's names to heal em
---
In my farming spot on my warrior I often kept up with the mages. Sure they were killing 5 at a time, but it took them a while and they had long downtime after. Meanwhile I just plugged away at each enemy one-by-one nonstop.
---
I could think of thousands upon thousands of things I’d rather do than watch someone straight up level in wow.
---
I see you like to live on the edge
---
Followed
---
What class is the best at handling a gank &amp; turning it around to kill a ganker?
---
Change stances to use different abilities. this is called stance dancing. For example a tank will switch to zerker to use intercept and then change back to defensive mid charge. You will spend the majority of your time in defensive but don't let that hinder you from utilizing your other stances.
---
lol 10 downvotes. Fuck off I gave the fake credit
---
I'm using an addon called BetterFont. This might help you out if you want to do it manually: [https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/changing-wow-text-font](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/changing-wow-text-font)
---
As an enhance shaman I've actually tanked and healed dungeons at the same time before.  I'm still tanking every dungeon I run, and I'm up to ZF.  I'm thinking Princess might be the end of my tanking days, we'll see.
---
I'd bank it and wait, to be honest. On a more mature server with more guilds nearing MC, I think it should go for higher.
---
Lifetap doesn’t halt the 5 seconds just by the by
---
I wouldn't say they're AWESOME at it, and after 40+ if you have the gear... you'll do fine in 1v1 against a melee class. If you fight a hunter or mage or priest? Gg 
---
Warriors are 100% gear dependent
---
If the people you fight are half decent at kiting, you will get beaten 9 times out of 10 unless you massively outlevel/outgear them. You will need a pocket healer or two to really unlock the power of Warriors in PvP.
---
Having a followup question.
---
I know warriors can tank with any spec whilst leveling, but I was wondering how is it at 60? Can fury and arms warriors tank UBRS and the likes without any problem, or is it better to usually just go prot if you want fast groups to farm your bis shit for dps?
---
Forgive my newbie... But my boyfriend just got a weapon that's legit a broken glass bottle (beer, liquor, whatever). I died laughing.
---
lmao imagine spending so much money on potions at level 30 when you need to save for mount
---
No problem man I hope you didn't think I was trying to belittle you. Your vid really was awesome and I hope you make more vids for each one of your dungeon conquests as a family lol. I'm a lvl 52 resto shaman let me know if you have any question about dungeons or healing it's how I leveled most of the way :) send me mail when you post next vid!
---
1  m nnn m. CNN
---
+1% chance to hit does nothing in terms of dps? Really? Do you do dps when your attacks miss?
---
I love that vod.
---
Also a lot of people coming back from retail probably don't remember to keep as close of an eye on breath underwater since on retail it's so long that you really need to try to drown.
---
It was a bug that was quickly fixed early in vanilla.
---
Thanks for confirming! Do you think the talent is worth anything then? It seems very situational now.
---
"With a snap of my fingers that gnome would cease to breath, and I call that...mercy"
---
Got a big lol from me, good job
---
Did... Did he fart a little green cloud then fan it away? OMG that made my day!
---
Ha! Haha! This warrior gets it.
---
I really disagree, I would take spirit over int in both raiding and 5 mans. The gloves are trash. There are other gloves with more plus healing anyway that drop from dungeons
---
fair
---
Having a job would literally be the definition of having a life. Lol
---
Turn on parental controls and limit game time and have your gf set the password.
---
It works. Trust me.
---
Any server is Horde dominated on english PVP EU, so just pick any really.
---
Basically engage in arms charge/rend/tclap 
---
Swap to zerk for zerks rage/whirlwind
---
Then back to defensive obviously this changes depending on how big/type of mob you're engaging
---
honestly I would much rather have the difficulty and mechanics of retail dungeons/raids than vanillas current difficulty. I have literally not read a single mechanics in classic dungeons and have completely steamrolled every single one of them so far at 52
---
I was in school Mance as a shammy with another shammy who is level 58 I told em I’ll put windfury you put Grace of Air and HE DID NOT HAVE IT!! How the hell can you not afford 1.7 gold at 58? It’s 43 agility Jesus Christ
---
Stick with it this time
---
nice bro
---
What level do i need for scarlet monastry? Im a well geared holy priest lvl 28. I healed gnomeregan at lvl 24...
---
It's the chest piece. I don't have the tabard.
---
Molten core / Onyxia is easy yes. 
---
BWL Test the Guild 
---
Zg is gear catchup 
---
Aq20 Post first boss is harder
---
Aq40 will punish you hard with new mechanics. 
---
Nax40 breaks guilds.   
---
Deeming wow classic by Mc is not fair 
---
You can 20 man most of Mc.... once you step in to bwl each boss will test one thing on each boss 
---
First boss will point on guild weakpoints
---
Second boss is dps check 
---
Suppression room is so/ die gauntlet that end in a boss.  
---
Chromagnus have random abilities and if your unlucky you can’t beat him.
---
It is a less-than-ideal pvp spec for the worst 1v1 class in the game. That's not to say you won't be able to kill anybody at all, but you are at a very significant disadvantage.
---
that's the plan!
---
Gnomercy...
---
What do we look like probability calculators?
---
AH prices can change from day to day, so as many times as you want, for it to be more accurate. As the game gets older and the market stabilizes more you’ll have to do it less
---
Had some guy invite me to his guild saying it was a great guild, many people blah blah blah... I join the guild and at level 36 I'm the highest level and there's never more than 5 people online. I'm waiting till late at night to give it that /gquit when no one is online
---
Added!

Nah It's not that i find warrior particularly fun. It's just that I hate healing and since I don't know if i will enjoy dps or tanking, warrior seems to cover them both. What do you suggest as a good class for a beginner? Is Druid any good in the end game since I am planning to keep on playing for some time.
---
dont give water to healers who cry and bitch about healing warlocks who lifetap. Mages are the last class who should be providing their benefit as it doesn't improvd your peformance it just saves you money. Healing a warlock improves the run arguably. Nobody says they are entitled to a rogue's lockpicking, or a warlock's summoning, mages aren't different.
---
Alli are stinky ;)
---
Am druid. I used to advertise as tank/heals lfg, but I've never had a problem getting a healer so I'm always tanking. Now I just say Tank LFG and ignore the healer part entirely.
---
I almost healed Uldaman yesterday but remebered I haven't skilled up any resto abilities except healing touch since I was saving for my mount.
---
you want us to do math for you?
---
Thanks mate! Well, it's a fact that you can't use copyrighted material in commercial use. But mine isn't. Mine will be a personal project that I will share with everyone.

I miss the days when windfury could do that right at the beginning of vanilla.

The first quest to tame pets gives you temporary pets. You will need to go and tame a new one to keep.

U missing out. Getting ganked and ganking is fun

Still works in PvP. I would say it is worth it.

This...I joke with my BFF that it’s his revenge for being enslaved, but seriously I’m glad it’s not just me 😆

I'm a web developer and my phone capitalized homebrew and I had to correct it.
---
People still transferring everyday.
---
It's not like you wrote it is,best way to check is go to STV and see how many horde players are there,you probably were in locations where there are quests for alliance which horde don't get,meaning horde doesn't go there really
---
True but gear score would be irrelevant in vanilla. Some of the games BiS items aren’t even 60 requirement level. I remember back in vanilla, a lot of casters using the Briarwood Reed until Naxxramas or AQ.

You can ask your dad when he comes in later inside your room to buttfuck you.

Ahh the millenial never grew up playing wow and doesnt know what games where like at the time, cute :)
---
Wana know why wow was so popular? Because it was the casual mmorpg at the time, the grind in wow was considered piss easy compared to what was the normal grind at the time for a mmorpg lol.
---
Alliance questing is better at lower levels though. Horde questing in Ashenvale, Stonetalon, and 1k needles is brutal at min/appropriate levels. Unless you're a lock or Hunter, of course. Quest design and mob density are out of whack 3/4 of the time.
---
Did a warlock steal his girl?
---
Are you changing the color of names in your chat after, or is this an addon that does this?
---
Your warriors must of been much better geared then the ones I was grouped with then. If I didn't spam healing wave they would go down like flies.
---
If it works for you fine but I'd still rather go old school tank &amp; spank with sword and shield.
---
Opened a char in flamelash cheers man
---
I didn’t take any offense at your advice. My videos usually post a week after the game session, so we often have talked for several days by the time anyone sees/hears what we did. But sometimes I hear/read advice we hadn’t thought about even later. Any advice at any time is appreciated.
---
CoF? Isn't called Will of the Forsaken? Also doesn't it also give them a few seconds of immunity?
---
I've been healing dungeons as 20/0/31 shadow since level 10. I have never had a group wipe to lack of healing, only accidental pulls and adds.
---
I've healed up to brd and both UBRS and LBRS without issue as well as all the scourge dungeons barring scholo (which no tank will ever run unless it's a favor to you) with no issues at all. If you want to level as a healer as a personal thing, disc is great as others have said. But you can 100% heal all group content as a pure shadow spec.

Ambush is insane
---
No mage should ever lose to a warrior - what a trash mage.
---
Because this **is** the fun part.
---
Feels bad. Started to help my buddies level last night with some arena farm. Got our two mages the belt and our warrior vendored another 2. I cannot believe how many we saw, it was insane
---
Pretty damn clever really.
---
You shouldn't be farming out the bracers quest anyway. You'll get them organically as a part of the chain to kill the leaders and the quests that send you to each of the ponds for things.
---
It is the add on Prat 3.0
---
&gt; Here, have a +15 int buff, you can’t really use it, but maybe it’ll make you crit more.
---
It helps with leveling Weapon Skill, so it's not 100% worthless.
---
yeah thats what i mean though, warrs in combat charge has a 30 sec cd right? hunters can just fd/freeze trap them every time they charge in and perma kite. only problem is if the warr gets the jump on the hunter (which is unlikely considering range). hunters smash rogues unless two of the following happen: 1) they get killed in the opener or 2) rogue procs cripping poison in the opener, otherwise they can just fd/trap and kite forever
---
Same. Most my friends, while married, have few responsibilities. I'm the only one with a child, house, etc. My highest character is 24. I rerolled a warrior recently so I could tank some groups. Everyone I know is now 38-54 and asking why I'm leveling slow/rerolled. But my warrior is live 13, 100/150 fishing, 100/150 cooking. 60/75 blacksmithing, and 100/150 mining. I might not be the first level 60, but once I hit 60 I'll be the most complete without having to back track.

---
I've tried this as well, reddit has made this spot very popular, I ended at about 7g in an hour and a half
---
As a rogue, why shouldn’t I be applying poison to my weapons when there’s a shaman in the party?
---
And if you're a newer player which doesn't know how to glitch up onto a building to become untargetable by NPCs?
---
Honestly I'll probably stay BM for a long time if possible. Done a lot of testing and I prefer BM overall so I don't need to respec over and over. BM pvps very well at low gear and still does fine with high end gear although pet doesn't scale. BM does good in dungeons (not so much raids, this is the only issue). BM is great for soloing and farming.
---
The only reason I'd switch to MM is if I was in a serious raiding guild that required it for TS aura. But, that's just personal pref.
---
"Oh my god..."
---
I followed a guide and my average lvl was around 3 hours from 45+ until 58 the last 2 levels tooks me 4ish hours but I was slogging around doing stupid shit. I also did profs and devilsaur farming when i hit 52
---
Yeah, what kind of person would just be entertained by mindless garbage like that?
---
K, I’m gonna go finish grinding out this level since I ran out of quests.
---
Sounds like a hater.

---
So u wasnt in love before?
---
It's the reason I mercilessly killed shaman any chance I got. I'm a horde player now, but back then I absolutely hated shaman.
---
Why should you get a tip for it? It's not like you did any real work. I get it, it's the principal of it. But all you did was click a button, wait a few seconds, and open trade and click accept.
---
Retail skill cap is much higher than classic tho.. lol
---
cringe
---
I like to play first person sometimes- gives it that Skyrim feel.
---
I hate the horde. And I know horde that hate the alliance. Hate is real in classic.
---
Why do you need to wait til no one is online to leave? If the guild is that shitty no one probably cares if you leave.
---
This is the best post so far on this subreddit, freakin hilarious

That's a mad lad.

Thank you for your service.

Is this a malfunctioning bot or a weird joke?
---
You have the option to not watch YouTube videos
---
As the replier below already said, it's more than likely worth it, not only for PvP, but mobs do crit from time to time, especially fast hitting ones (dual wielding ogres in tanaris pop to mind) and those times it's going to be pretty sexy.
---
About world 345000th. Seen 3 on Zandalar Tribe EU already.
---
Ah the people that never hit 60 because they’re constantly rolling alts and switching servers
---
All of the wow racial dances are based off real life ones so it’s quite possible that that’s the night elf one
---
Hey, bro - just giving some positivity for ya amongst the haters. Appreciate the honesty, and vulnerability.
---
Evan or Aidan, is that one of you guys?
---
If you think its so easy I can as well say that he will pummel your cast. And in reality (my own experience), most mages are completely shocked and lost when I pop FAP. Its probably due to a surprise moment and also most of them arent exactly experienced pvp players who can react quickly and accordingly. They usually put all their faith into frost nova and frostbolt spam
---
When shaman is lvl 30 they get a Windfury Totem, which applies a buff to the party’s main hand weapons. This buff will sometimes give you an extra swing which is worth more than that poison. You can and should still use poison on your off hand weapon.
---
I was watching going wow that mage can't suck that bad
---
Turns out it was just insane lucky damage lol
---
It's fairly balanced, but STV is horde dominated
---
I think they were not talking before every pull, but after the first few to optimise the pug for the rest. Good thing imo
---
Only times i'll tap that low is either during a fight where I really NEED the mana, or before a break when I'm low on water but have lots of food. 
---
And as u/justdrop points out, we should let the healers take SPI stuff. It's really not that great for us. Stam is the stat we want.
---
So the fury point only goes if you're doing the whole fury prot tanking with dual wielding? Yeah, I wasn't really hoping to go with lightning speed, but just being able to actually not get 1 shot and what not. Getting things done more or less. And yeah, only dungeons, not really raids.
---
&gt; This was a really bad Rogue.

No this is the average rogue.

People have written in this thread that GM's confirmed it's not possible to change specialization. Do you have any proof?
---
The challenge of Classic was logistics, technology, time and culture. It's difficult to get 40 people to play enough to reach level 60. It's harder still to keep their egos in check long enough to get to a raid instance and teach them the (rather elementary, but necessary) fight mechanics. It was very hard 15 years ago to keep the full raid from DC'ing or having horrible latency and getting a satisfactory VOIP client. Perhaps the hardest thing was finding 40 people who met the above criteria and were willing to be "closet" WoW players, since gaming had a different social stigma 15 years ago than today (ESports would have been laughed to scorn when I was in High School). The "challenge" was only partially inherent to the game, and over time, we've evolved past many of them. Now, classic is not "hard" from a "can I even do this?" perspective, it's just slow and the hard part is, "can I justify losing more sleep"? As a caveat, part of the magic of it being so slow, is that it really does encourage socialization, which, I believe, is the real magic of WoW. You give me a solid group of people I actually like to be around, and retail is the better game.
---
&gt; Is Druid any good in the end game since I am planning to keep on playing for some time.
---
Druid is very strong, but are 99% of the time, healing endgame. Feral tanking and dps is not that common. Tanking 5-mans is quite strong, but tanking raids is rare.
---
It's also complex, with constantly having to swap between 3 forms (caster / cat / bear).
---
I would recommend, hunter or warlock for someone who is just starting. Yes they can only be dps, but they are pet classes that have a lot easier time adventuring alone. (Never really alone, they have a pet to aid them always)
---
Disagree. Transferring off of an imbalanced server does make the server you are leaving worse. But no one has some obligation to stay on a server and suffer just to make it better for others? 
---
Also in this situation you cant get your homies to play on your server because they would have to reroll. For example, I transferred off of stalagg, I cant get others to come join me on stalagg because no one wants to start over on a highly imbalanced server. I just transferred off of stalagg to heartseeker, we all keep our characters and there isnt such a big imbalance. 
---
I dont have an obligation to stay on a server as a protest to try to keep it balanced, I'm gonna try to enjoy classic experience as much as I can, not my problem that the server I left was imbalanced.
---
Yeah WoF sorry.
---
And maybe 3-5? Not sure tbh
---
Yeah at worst you piss of 4 other people.
---
While leveling a Warrior it is easier to tank dungeons as fury or arms because you will do more damage and therefore more threat. Protection only becomes better and necessary to a degree in the late game. Also a shaman should never use earth shock as a dps unless you interrupt. It is a high threat ability that works as a pseudo taunt for Shaman tanks.
---
Or is the night elf doing a Michawl Jackson dance?
---
&gt;Weapon Skills Not being Maxed while Shifted
---
Is also just not true. I picked up a dagger in my mid 20s, never had used a dagger before, and had no issues in cat form with it
---
[Arena.NET](https://Arena.NET) definitely worked hard on the UI of Guild Wars 2. 
---
It is really well designed.
---
I just started a night elf druid and I thought the dance he does was pretty similar to the guardians of the galaxy dance in the final battle scene.
---
Back in the day i used to sit on quest NPCs in the hub on isle of queldanas in mookin form and ppl would always right click me, get flagged, then wrecked by guards lol
---
He got jumped. The end
---
I don't know if such guide for Horde exist.
---
Might be reasonable to charge a fixed percentage of the finished product or something. Say like 10% or something arbitrary like that. Find a number you're comfortable with charging.
---
Was running Mara the other day when after first boss hunter says he's out of ammo and his gear is at 7% durability...  he says I'm going to hearth and I was like hell no! Go drown and take spirit res and run your ass to Nijel's Point and back.  He did.

Good deal!  8 plates of 25 or 45 as that's 245 or 405 lbs.  I like deadlifts better than squats, just gotta watch my back.  Keep hittin the gym!  Edit: Math is hard.
---
what my friend did was vendor everything while leveling but supposedly its gonna be more profitable at higher levels
---
the real issue is that NOBODY has big money. In a few months there will be wealthy level 60 players who start leveling alts and wanna just buy mats and dont care
---
Must be a PVE server. My camera is always on a swivel on PVP contested areas.
---
I think it’s a known fact that warriors are the only viable tanks in 20 and 40 man raids. I’ve never heard of a progression guild using a Feral or Paladin. Mostly due to talents specifically made to mitigate incoming damage, taunt and high threat generation.
---
I will say that ferals and paladins are extremely capable in instance runs. 
---
I don’t think it’s elitist, but it’s certainly a well known fact for progression raiding. That’s why you don’t see other off spec classes like shadow priests, cat dps or ret. Otherwise, I say to each their own. People doing what they wanted was part of WoW. I wouldn’t turn down either for this early in classic. We had a paladin in our guild with the first TF on our server(before we knew what the bindings were for) and loved tanking ZG and other 5-10 mans. Otherwise he healed in progression. He even tanked for some Onyxia pug late vanilla.
---
It’s rogues all the way down.
---
So were they pugs or nah lmao
---
inb4 these guys will be the 1st to quit
---
You face Jaraxxus, Eredar Lord of the Trifling Gnome!
---
Is it too late to start playing?? I feel like I’m behind and don’t want to have to play big time catch up. Hope there’s still low level players leveling :D Want to play casual btw
---
I'm not high enough level, a mail wearer, it female. But this still got me a little moist.
---
How do you do this?
---
Thanks for your response!
---
Thank you for reacting!
---
You could most likely do UBRS with Fury/Arms Sword and Board or 2H as long as a good healer is with you and you have decent gear.
---
Stalagg is rough! But always interesting!
---
Because crafting profession provide bonuses, and gathering one's - don't.  
---
Like Tailoring would give you clothes that you could war only if you have 300 Tailoring. Or Alchemy give you elixirs that only Alchemist could use.  
---
Plus some recipes require very long farming.
---
50 here
---
It’s Michael Jackson’s dance....
---
Thank you!!! My post was for people who either transferred to feel happy they did, or for people who are unsure to take the chance! It’s a good server, only going to get better!
---
Why suffer on your current server because there are 50k+ ppl on it compared to only 20k on Heartseeker. ITS MORE THAN VANILLA! LOL
---
Yea okay Swifty, love you man!
---
Chill snowflake.
---
Raids are gonna really be tough to get into but it’s a 15 yr old game.  We’ve seen druids MT Ony successfully in the first week lol so I’m sure you can crack a 40 man roster.   As far as PvP goes it’s unfair.   I’m lvl 50 so far but every alliance I see just gets bodied.
---
I can't remember a single time in wow I've been attacked fairly and can only recall a couple of me attacking people fairly (though fairly is subjective since the ones I remember are them attacking me and losing, but that is as close to fair as it gets). On Timeless isle is probably the closest I've ever gotten but I still wouldn't consider it fair since gear was a bigger divider than levels at that point.
---
Nobody has big money he says as I sit upon my epic mount counting all my coin. 
---
Oh the life of a mage is a good one.
---
I'm in the same boat.  All the dungeon abbreviations are joggin memories outta my brain that had long been archived.
---
Just wanted to give some addition info: Two of these tips are controversial, but in my honest opinion, I think they are fine to use until Blizzard says otherwise.
---
 **Sit Crits**  
---
This CAN be done in classic with good timing, its just harder to pull off than in private servers.  
---
To my knowledge, this is still working the same as in the beta and Blizzard has not mentioned anything about it. 
---
 **Log Reset/Camp Reset**  
---
Some people are confusing this with the layering exploit done within dungeons to reset a boss while still inside the dungeon. The layering exploit probably also lets you bypass the 5 instance per hour limit, because you never leave the instance. Logging out and resetting the dungeon doesn't let you bypass that limit and just saves you a run back to the entrance. Also this has been publicly used for a while and unless streamer privilege really is a thing, then it should be ok until Blizz says otherwise.
---
For what it's worth, I only needed 1-2 screeches to multi without pulling aggro as BM.
---
Great, thanks!
---
Your casting non stop, in classic there's a 5 second rule. So spirit is almost useless in raids, until you get the set that gives you mana regen while casting. You rather have the Intel for the innverrates you'll recieve.
---
I'm not as optimistic.  People are already min maxing for leveling dungeons way more than they ever did in vanilla.
---
65/35 for Alliance/Horde 
---
Rip 42 Shammy :(
---
How do i make my pet hold aggro? I'm level 11 and have a pet boar. Whenever I shoot the mobs with my bow, i instantly get aggro'd. My pet is entirely useless.
---
It's never too late. There will always be altoholics like me to keep you company!
---
Thanks for your input!

I found a spot in thousand needles at lvl 29 where same lvl flying lions (excuses not knowing the name) spawn in droves, spent an hour farming heavy leather stacks, gonna probly do it once more than flood the AH and try to corner the market
---
You wanna have a little accident huh? You wanna fall down and hit your head?
---
If you said this picture was taken in 2006, I would've believed you

"Fall behind" and "I have a level 60"

You know a lot of people havent even hit 60 yet? 
---
Inb4 "I got banned for no reason" post
---
Master race!!
---
Maybe Tauren too. It's always a sad day when I see a dwarf and Tauren fighting :(
---
About 1% of total player base is 60. As a lvl 50 you have about 70-80% of the player base trailing behind you. Source : https://wowpop.appspot.com/

System &gt; Sound &gt; Uncheck error speech
---
You heard right.  She’s the person you have to hand in the quest to get the ring.  It was a nightmare when I tried doing that quest recently.  Others keep triggering the onyxia quest, then you can’t turn in until that’s all reset.
---
I think most people are level 30 and under. Most are def not 60 yet
---
Shouldn't eye of the storm proc if i /sit as an ele shaman?
---
If you have 99% chance to hit, extra hit does nothing.
---
What makes you think it's valued?
---
Ironfoe and many other “proc” weapons work with what is called ProcPerMinute or PPM. I’m not sure exactly the ppm for Ironfoe. I just know that’s how it works. There is no flat percentage chance for the proc to go off if that is what you are wondering. 
---
Devilsaur set is Pre-bis for human fury dps warriors. 
---
Can’t speak for the third question.
---
You can drop enchanting after smoking heart trinket. Druids really don't need any specific profession but if you plan on pvp or added functionality you should pick up engineering later on. Until that just get two gathering proffessions and farm to buy your Warden Staff, Devilsaur set, epic mount, and other key items or mats you need/want imo. You can really do whatever you want here, but my guess is that LW will be a pretty saturated market where you won't make a whole lot of gold unless you're farming all if the mats yourself
---
It’s an addon called Auctioneer. But it requires you to go to the auction house and scan it which can take around 10 minutes. So all the recommendation are based off your last scan
---
Not available yet. No details that I know of sorry. I'm also waiting for this
---
Facts : D
---
I see you also, also like to kill the earth will the plastic cup you are using.
---
I cannot log in on a realm at the moment. 
---
Even logging in to battle.net had a queue.
---
I too blame Blizzard but that's not how i see it at all. Not being team players because they want to play a class that they enjoy for whatever reason? No dps class is a team player, they just damage stuff. Mages for example happen to be a great dps but the players that play mage don't do it altruistically cause they're team players. 
---
If everyone followed that mentality, everyone would be playing only 1 DPS class, the one that ranks the absolutely highest because why would you want to play anything sub-par even if it's 2nd best dps? You'd be doing everyone a disservice. God forbid someone wants to play a dps that they find enjoyable. So basically delete all other classes and have just 3 in game. One ultra-tank, one ultra-healer and one ultra-dps. Do you see how weird and faulty that mentality is? 
---
I understand it if we're talking about hardcore raiding guilds that try for record positions etc but in every other case i find it ridiculous. I think people CAN bear doing a dungeon with a hunter and a rogue instead of 3 mages without their lives in the game being so unbearable. A lot of people don't care only about their class having the best dps, hunter players might like the playstyle that the pets and bows bring, druids might like all the utilities and shapeshifting etc. 
---
I don't like that blizz has turned some of the specs into meme specs but it is what it is. Still i think that most people (perhaps excluding the hardcore cases i mentioned) above, shouldn't be falling into that trap and effectively punishing other players for playing the class they enjoy to play in favor of "only meta specs". Yes it might be faster but for me it's damaging both the community and the feeling of the game.
---
In the 40s bracket of grouping. Only issue I have with SP is the same thing I have with most other DPS, they dump every single spell they have before the mob is even at the pull spot as my warrior has 5 rage. Yea, its great you have SWPain, but if you slap it on every mob before I can even make one swing, Im just going to let you tank.
---
I was running the other night as a mage, and had another mage and a holy priest. Both of us mages lost to the priest that said he thought it was spell crit and not hit. Sad day
---
 OK thank you anyways!
---
You shouldn’t be using thunderclap unless you really need the debuff it gives.
---
Ya you never gank a fellow rogue because what if his friend is right there stealthing? I'm not taking the bait.
---
Upvoted, but that looks absolutely miserable unless you don't mind shooting the shit in line.
---
Agreed :( I never attack Tauren 
---
But I will attack any undead I see
---
I never understood this mentality. Like, if you don’t have to heal why not help with DPS? Wand and dot things.
---
I remember having this on my blood elf paladin in BC. It was pretty awesome running around in battlegrounds, doing random spin attacks
---
Id keep enchanting until you get your gear set up at 60 and then just enchant to the best of your ability and help a couple of friends then drop it
---
Thunderclap isn't good for aoe threat at all. Its a trap.
---
1. 2.98% according to warrior discord
---
2. No, not really unless you want to use different weapon types for some reason.
---
3. I think you're misinterpreting crit suppression. Berserker stance still gives you 3% crit.
---
Never. Deep prot is for raids.
---
That's a low bar to set
---
I’m just curious, how exactly does this matchup work? I play a priest, and when a warrior engages me I have a tough time. I fear him, but he breaks it and is still in melee range and I’m stuck trying to bubble/heal/play defense until I die. 
---
I guess I’d have more of an advantage if I engaged, but still don’t see how I’m supposed to reliably win. 
---
Any tips to help me with this matchup?
---
Don't pay attention to the negative comments. It's already been said above, but there's no pressure to be at the top of the game or have the best gear. The game barely came out a month ago, and you're under no obligation to the game or to anyone to git gud rl fast. It can be fun to nolife it once in a while, but personal health and real life take precedence every time. Proud of you for recognizing that and sharing your story so others could (hopefully) have the same revelation if they need it. 
---
Stay healthy, hydrated, and happy, brother.
---
Ugh I hate lazy people in dungeons.
---
At what level would you recommend farming DireMaul?
---
HUGH!
---
If your pet does not net know growl, teaching them that skill is key.  If you still have issues, start slow to let them build aggro.
---
Classic isn't going anywhere. People have been playing variants of it ever since it originally changed over to Burning Crusade. Pick a server and enjoy yourself, dabble in retail if you like, and just enjoy the journey. The RP realms will always be smaller in population than the others, but I doubt any of them will be completely dying off anytime soon. If you enjoy the game, then play it. ;)
---
that was me just a few moments ago. picked up feral tanking for classic since i never played feral/melee/tank and went into the WC for the first time (tanking) and it was a fucking shitshow!!   
---
half way through the dungeon the hunter got mad and put his pet away since he was too lazy to press the pet-attack button ("why should i when i can turn on aggressive and get the same result?") and the mage loved to desheep his own sheeps right after sheeping (not aggravating but funny nontheless).  
---
TL;DR: started tanking for classic, got my nerves wracked
---
Ooh I'll look into that thanks
---
Just as long as that way doesn't become the only way to play.  I don't need someone gatekeeping dungeons runs to mages only
---
I was questing and tanaris by the ogres, I had a shaman whispered me from gadgetzan asking if I could make some water/food for a tip. I said sure but I'm far from gadgetzan and asked if I could meet them halfway. Now, when we met up this guy asked me for 6 stacks of water/food. I said it would take me a while since I could only make 2 at a time. Imagine how long it took me to make those 120 bottles of water. FOR 50 FKING SILVER. Sure it's "free" since I only have to click a button but come on guys time is money.
---
On your own time and for a company are completely different things. If you’re gaining experience by drawing for OTHERS they should be paying you, regardless. That’s about as dumb as working for “exposure”
---
Yikes cringe
---
You kids dont know who that is anymore. Kids think drake discovered ozzy.
---
NO YELLING ON THE BUS!
---
Nice, looking forward to my shiny staff.
---
You are over thinking it. World pvp isn’t about the crazy pop size it’s about small skirmishes that might explode into bigger ones.
---
Layering will eventually be gone and there will be plenty of action to go around.
---
Enjoy the game. Make friends.
---
Elaboration; You are a loser.
---
I like to pick flowers.
---
Just use cloth/leather int gear. It doesn't HAVE to be mail. Ulda has a really dope chest/shoulder drop that are mail with int gear. The shoulders i believe are a random stat so you might have to run it a few times. I just switched over at 45 and am loving that I can 2 shot mobs my level. Def need to ask mages for water while leveling though.
---
You just need healing gear until the 40s-50s. You'll start to notice how much you suck at healing as feral at late 30s early 40s. Also buy mana pots to help you out when oom on pulls. You'll want to respec around 50 or so.
---
Had a mage in BRD say to get water or food I had to give him all my vendor trash... which equaled around 5 gold. I laughed as a warlock and just life tapped. Doing every pull with 400 health was great.
---
Grats! Did you vendor the drops or sell them on AH? (Greens, skinning etc)
---
That isn't bad.  For an example, I lived near East Coast and played East Coast server in Vanilla.  It was common for people in my area to be 120-180ms latency, despite being close.  You may be traveling a long distance, but you're connected so much better than just about everyone was back in the day.  You'll be just fine, even in PvP.
---
The only consideration is ease of finding people who play when you do.
---
The best way to gain threat is as follows.
---
Be arms
---
Charge in
---
Use SS
---
Use serker stance
---
Use bloodrage
---
WW
---
MS
---
Swap to defensive and sword and shield once ss buff wears out.
---
Tab sunder/revenge mobs.
---
Grandes when needed.
---
Could you share that guide? I have limited play time so want to optimise it.
---
All i say is: [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7068/elemental-fire](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7068/elemental-fire)
---
Wholesome. You can’t have mail or be a guild master or have AH’s the rest will transfer.
---
I guess this is streamer/reddit/attention worthy. /s
---
Auctionator, it shows vendor prices and you can scan the AH for the "Buy now price" instead of the bid price that the classic auction house sorts by. Makes it also easier to put in stuff. 
---
Bartender 4, so you have more control over where your action bars are and how many there are
---
Atlas Loot, So you can look up what drops there are in dungeons
---
It's a good idea that'll never make it anywhere because the majority is Horde, and they like to have a huge population advantage.
---
don't do that, you'll just take aggro off your pet every pull and it'll be a real big headache. just wait til you get aimed shot at 51
---
Tbh i do notbshare that viee of druids buy i think its still funny
---
I couldn't believe it, I needed the video as proof.
---
Any Addons that show enemy cast bars?
---
Your monitor probably has far more pixels than it did in Vanilla days.
---
All my toons are still level 5, every class on Horde and Alliance. I'm just concerned the burn out will kill WoW classic
---
Just stick to tank until 60 and do the hybrid spec once raiding starts. It does get a bit harder after 50 to heal properly. Unless you're in tight with a dedicated warrior tank or something it's probably not worth the trouble to continue trying to heal
---
Okay but I'd say 99 percent of people dont ask for that much. Hell, I've never asked for food but I'd say maybe 5 or 6 mages in my journey have just given it to me without asking. THATS how it should be. Now in some cases like yours where the guy is gluttonous, I agree you should get a bigger tip.
---
Kill the mobs that drop it?
---
Ah I see. Cheers bud. How much gold did you make these three levels, and how long did it take you to grind three levels?
---
Nova was fine. He should have stayed in dead zone though rather than blinking out.
---
I think if put to a vote, it would show players would want multi-boxing be a ban-able offense in both classic and retail.
---
Lookin' good.
---
Tirisful glades and silver pine are really nice. Durotar to barrens is painful
---
I don’t mind it, but if things get hairy and I’m low mana I’m going to focus on the tank and not the lock. I think most people understand this though.
---
If I have mana to spare then I don’t mind being the locks second mana bar.
---
That is a sick gw2-looking ui. What’s the add on name?
---
Iron Man?
---
For anyone thinking about staying on servers like Herod it's also worth considering-you will face worse queues in phase 2 when layering is removed. 
---
How much worse remains to be seen but I'm not optimistic.
---
I'm planning on doing something similiar but as Horde.
---
I know. Just use it to help with your gear at 60 and get the trinket and move on afterwards tho.
---
Thrash can proc off itself but I don’t believe it stores like reckoning. One attack would automatically release all the procs. Either you got giga unlucky or the proc coefficient is wonky.
---
TL;DW version: Some talking, op lvls up. Nothing AT ALL of value is shown or said. Save your 1:42 for something, anything, better than this.
---
If you just do /auc getall it takes 15 seconds compared to half an hour
---
Yo dont get mad at me because you have threat problems
---
Give this man a golden gnome
---
Bro, I ran 1 monitor in Vanilla. As did most people. 3 monitors these days makes Multiboxing super simple on top of it, lol
---
Enchants and gear obviously. Also major agi or intel elixirs, elixirs of def, stoneshield pots, and dreamless sleep pots
---
"Babe, come on! this purple body paint said it washed off in a single wash! it isn't my fault!"
---
It fucking claps most if not all 1v1 matchups
---
Damn, didnt think you would dub over so much profanity. Horde really are edgy teenagers.
---
Explain for us noobs please (:
---
I really think its sad aswell but im not ignoring the fact people are out there...
---
They freeze you underwater so you drown or have you agrro Murlocs?
---
Deleted my female Tauren because of that
---
Hi all, so I want to share with you the rare locations of this zone. I decided to do this because the only source of rare spawns I could find was from a video made by Huzzah. It's a great video ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6fV5hnGg0E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6fV5hnGg0E) ) with detail about each rare npc, but I wanted all the locations to be on one image for quick reference.
---
What do you think? Should I share more or is there another site that's already done this?
---
I only saw 3 while levelling in Un'goro. Each time right when they spawned, and they were dead within 15sec.
---
most alliance players play out of favour on pvp servers, it's not that bad.
---
Princess in Mauradon has a similar mechanic when you solo kite. You get in melee range and you get womped with 4 autoattacks
---
I was about to say, layering made u lose it. So a non classic feature in classic caused an outcome that was nonclassic. So they kinda had to look into it and should def give it back- hope u get it! Keep us posted if u get it back
---
In 5 mans they’re a warlock with lower DPS but with some utility.
---
In raids they’re a warlock DPS multiplier. 
---
PvP is where they shine. 
---
Any way you play them, they’re H O N G R Y for MP.
---
250 dps on bosses? That's extremely low. 400-600 is average from what I've seen in MC.
---
I'm up to 75 for hoj, never even seen it drop. I'm starting to think about at what point I'll be able to solo angerforge (rogue).
---
Love this man thanks for sharing it.
---
The crits were from recklessness, a 30 min warrior CD
---
Really? Neither was layering.... I would argue that point. Because of things they put in that wasn't in vanilla you lost an item. It only seems fair that they use methods not in vanilla to fix the problem
---
In that guy?!? You're the one not looting your kills for the Skinners to come through..
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/In_Loving_Memory
---
Thanks man. I considered hunter as well what is he like after 60 dps wise? I always liked archers in other mmos but having a pet was kinda off putting for me. Will I be needing the pet after 60 or it is there to help with leveling?
---
Prom my perspective the horse are stinky!
---
I hope you get what's coming to you :)
---
Literally 1% of the entire game’s player base is 60 right now. That’s why you can’t find 60s to fight.
---
Classic cast bars
---
Looks like a 3v2
---
What Mage DOESN'T buy a Blizzard upgrade!?
---
Not really by a mile... Paladins come quite close IMO
---
Is that Silithus?  Are the quests for that area in the game yet?
---
If youre sword spec you want two swords but a very fast dagger offhand can help apply more poisons if you want to go that route
---
Daggers are faster so more poison applications, but there are fast swords too.  Just harder to get
---
Only work for tips unless its a a very rare plan. If you want to make money off it use your mats and sell finished product
---
I got hit by 3x spells by a Quillboar caster in Barrens today. Frost nova, fire blast, and some other instant cast all at the same time. The sound scared the shit out of me cause all 3 sounds overlapped each other and it took 50% of my HP at lvl 24 when he was lvl 22 non elite. I have a feeling a bug has found its way into the game and we'll hear about it soon.
---
Melee windfury / thrash procs I get, but 3 instant cast spells all at the same time? Not so much.
---
omg how dare u criticize classic wow smh
---
I can second this, only up to 20 but so far Pyrewood Village has been great. Haven’t had a bad interaction yet, everyone seems proper nice.
---
Aight! It does sound fair! Thanks!
---
Warlocks use spirit gear for solo leveling with improved drain soul
---
Does the one who is being charged stay at the waterfall area? And can still roll on items?
---
I would say it depends on your server and faction, if you're leveling by questing. Since lvl 30 I cant quest properly because it doesn't matter where I quest, the NPC's are camped by groups and/or I'm getting ganked by groups of hordes/high lvl chars. It's tedious to quest but at the other hand, it's still more fun than just going instances. 
---
Hunter is also not that good as a choice right now. You can't aoe properly, so you can't be part of melee-/spellcleave groups. You may level fast as a hunter on a dead pve server, but being on a full PvP server takes a while.
---
If thats MG I remember her, nice lady
---
but what if in another month, its the same on kirtonos? How is it on faerlina atm?
---
Right click abilities to toggle them off.

Last talent in the Affliction tree.

mount centipede
---
No dice with that or other variations.   
---
I was hoping someone had found it, but it just had not made it's way to google yet.
---
Check out the nerubians that summon scarabs in WPL. Each cast seems to summon 5-8 beetles that each hit for 40-50 before dying, which can also crit and daze. My warlock has taken 50% HP from a single cast. 
---
May not be the same issue but it felt bad. 
---
Also yes - I’ve noticed a number of mobs seem to thrash me for 4-5 hits at a time, those flayers being a good example.
---
Lol kattfan :P
---
I think the oozeling won’t be worth nearly as much this time around. Correct me if I’m wrong but there is an increased number of debuff slots in Classic right? This pet was only worth so much as some raiders used it to bypass mechanics. Still a cool pet and might go to see prices similar to the whelplings.
---
Maybe they thought the tank was asking for water in the picture, which may make them the dumbest shit head in this room.
---
You never want to be near a melee. Ever. Mage has the most tools to keep them locked out of range forever. He literally ran on top of him and dismounted. He could not have made a worse play unless he frost nova'd at range, hitting nothing and then blinked into the warrior leaving himself with literally zero tools. But honestly, this was about just as bad.
---
O
---
botting is cheating
---
You have learned in kindergarten that cheating is for losers. (If you are homeschooled, I am sorry for you)
---
I'm sure I ran a SM with you a few days ago - Noggenfogger?
---
6% more movespeed on cheetah is 6% faster to 60, the math adds up
---
Hey now my UI is clean as fuck.   There's no need for a messy UI on paladin you barely use anything.  Give me 12 action bar slots with proper macros, map, floating combat text, and small raid frames.   Plus this guy must have vision issues for his chat/meters to be so fucking huge.
---
As a rogue how can I use Skull of Impending Doom? When I equip it, it goes on a 30 sec CD. Is there any way to circumvent the CD through a macro of some sort?
---
not leeway but another much loved mechanic called Spell Batching. Between that and leeway.... phase 2 is gonna be dumb.
---
They killed the dwarf on the ground and we ran over, that’s how it started
---
Sadly 99% of guilds will expect you to heal raids if your class has heal spells. If you want to dps and tank warrior is the only option. And yes, its the hardest class to level, but its also insanely op and fun at 60. Compare that to hunter who can literally auto attack to 60 without dying, but is one of the weakest classes at 60.
---
its a level 60 instance
---
I never stated that he was obligated, I said complaining about server imbalance and then transferring off is hypocritical. 
---
Contributing to a problem and complaining about the problem is inherently hypocritical
---
Millennials.
---
Lol - at first I was like "oh what an idiot, running into the water after an enhance shaman" - but then he went and did that xD And he's even a warlock...
---
Pop a Frost reflect trinket or grenade stun.  If you're not Engineer, just go afk and collect your corpse in a few.
---
Guy asks for advice/opinion, that's all I offered.
---
 I never claimed to be any warrior mastermind, simply starting an interesting discussion on the topic rather than"2H tanking works fine" when a person is asking for advice.
---
&gt;It's not a bad idea but the implementation would be tricky. Also couldn't be a hard stop to one faction or 1 faction would never get in but doing something like letting in 2 from one faction 1 from the other round robin style could make sense.
---
The round robin style would make the most sense. You couldn't completely lock a side out with out potentially causing the same problem with the other.
---
3. From what I read a few weeks ago that people tested on the Beta. If they had 15% crit in battle stance on a +3 levels mob, when they went into zerker stance they still had 15% crit. Now, for raiding the only reason warriors are in berserker stance is to whirlwind and for the 3% extra crit (and sometimes to immune fears). Now if you don't actually get 3% more crit from zerker stance and you'll have the same crit in battle stance, instead of mainly raiding in zerker stance and popping into battle to overpower. Is it worth it to stay in battle and pop into zerker to whirlwind?
---
And of course you can install addons without the Twitch app. Just download and install the good old way if you prefer a bit of security and privacy.
---
It should be the same for 1-2 more months on every server. Average players will be getting to 60 in about 2 months of playing. You’re in the tiny minority who no-lifed to 60 already. That’s why there’s nobody for you to fight.
---
Most players, skilled or unskilled, are in the 30-40 range right now. Having more free time is not equal to being skilled.
---
\+1
---
I'm having a blast just leveling as deep frost.
---
Reminds me of non-scientific partisan cabinet members appointed to make decisions for government-run scientific groups.
---
My strategy was to level every class I was interested in to 6-10 range. The ones I got past I would decide were my favs, namely rogue mage and warlock. From there whichever one I got to 20 would be my main. Ended up being mage. Still flip flopped a lot but that's how it is. No race to 60, level cap won't be going up so just find what you enjoy first!
---
Omg the addons the addons! My eyes! They are burning!
---
Seriously, who wants to play it like this? What the hell:D
---
These videos seem like some kind of subliminal programming to make children dumber.
---
You and me seem to be the only ones
---
you could have sold it, stupid
---
Got any proof?
---
Depends if I can charge into a pack or not
---
No it’s not new, but quiet rare
---
i'm afraid of shadow priests and i play Warlock.
---
You're fine here. Your group can't see past their own gear and how much more beneficial it is for you to have it. At this level the tank and healer are more important anyway, but the gear will be replaced and if you guys have the time just run each dungeon a few times until armor breaks to give everyone a shot at gear and make the most of your time. I understand if someone else need rolls and loses on a good piece they'll be upset but it's trivial at best here and you weren't wrong at all
---
Another fun thing to do is get a priest and a druid to the opposite factions starting zones to buff mobs. Priest Mind Controls, druid puts Thorns and Mark of the Wild on (bonus points if you have the thorns talent). Sit and watch as lowbies take more damage then they deal to the mobs and slowly kill themselves auto attacking.
---
why arent you tanking the way I think you should as a hunter who has never played tank and doesnt know what threat is.
---
Precisely this and I'm a warrior. If my frost reflect engi trinket is on CD or I don't have an action potion on me its lights out before it even starts. This mage in clip is actually awful and did everything possible wrong.
---
Man, I never thought I'd see someone wax poetic about the Quillboar. That's beautiful.
---
&gt;Hunter is also not that good as a choice right now. You can't aoe properly, so you can't be part of melee-/spellcleave groups. You may level fast as a hunter on a dead pve server, but being on a full PvP server takes a while.
---
Why would hunters need to aoe/spellcleave? They have multi-shot but for the most part they don't need to step foot in a dungeon until 50+. 
---
My hunter friends have been 60 for a week now on a full pvp server. And they did it just by questing and hit it with 2 days less /played then it's going to take my paladin ass haha.
---
Being selective with the skills you learn while leveling is wise. Buying everything will break your bank, especially early on. However, a single rank of Water Breathing is definitely worth it.
---
I click on polymorph and potions.
---
Fight me.
---
Mostly just good memories of leveling my first Horde character I guess. But I like the broad level range, the fact that so many people are funneled there and stay for a long time, and the atmosphere of the open plains.
---
Theres nothing wrong with fighting him in the room. It's not difficult, just have 1 person constantly focusing the adds as soon as one spawns. When he summons multiple adds just kill them then switch to boss. When it's 20% and he summons the two watchers, ignore them and nuke the boss. It's easy. Only difficult when you are underlevelled.
---
I was warlock in vanilla.  you could banish them, but not enslave them. I a pretty sure about this as I went there all the time for rich thorium veins.  maybe, just maybe you could enslave them at game launch, but it certainly was changed in a  patch long before 1.12
---
That's actually pretty fucking cool.
---
"We added a feature that made you lose an item in a way you couldn't in vanilla but we won't use methods from outside vanilla to retrieve it for you".
---
So my shaman is closing in on 40 and I’m about to make a switch to elemental. What’s a build I can use to level as ele but maybe do some healing in dungeons while hitting 60?
---
&gt; then I see a frost Nova and cone of cold followed by a blizzard...  
---
I always save Frost Nova and CoC when needed. Blizzard is really only use normal mobs (or for some parts of the raid when needed, like all those Drakes).
---
Buy arrows with a bankalt before you start your session and send them over. Then log on your main and start playing. By the time you need them they have arrived. And you'll never have a shortage.
---
Oh, got it, thanks. Which class do you recommend for optimal level 6 surprise pvp action?
---
Amen
---
Also gives you the buff that increases fun by 9999%
---
right but the H/A imbalance isnt good on kirtonos that could affect it. Also, if RIGHT NOW the wPvP on faerlina is better, then it will probably be better in the future. I just dont know any 60s on fearlina to ask. hopeing someone here can help.
---
Need same for level 35-40.
---
Warrior it is then. I never liked in any mmos managing pets as well. Orc Warrior it is. Thanks
---
What game is this?
---
At 225 skinning at level 34. Worth it to train artisan, or wait until after my mount?
---
Hit chance has a cap,  it's not at 100% either . Just like crit chance is capped at I believe 26 or 28% . Hit cap is lower .

A warlock will lose to a Hunter, Priest, and Shaman as they are their biggest counters. Hunters only really have one counter being Mages and Druids only real counter is Hunters and maybe themselves lol.
---
Idk whats weong with bottong anyway...
---
 **Is it just me or is Chris Pratt doing the night elf dance?**
---
5s for the buff duration.
---
For those that don’t get the context (ie: non-hunters), “Nelson the Nice” is one of 4 disguised demons a hunter has to defeat for their epic bow Rhok’delar.
---
No actually, it's very clear when you're playing a druid. It happens on retail as well where you can't use Travel Form for 2-3 seconds sometimes when exiting an indoor area.
---
You didn't lose an item because of layering, you lost it because you didn't pay attention. You knew about layering and how it works. And even if not, it is a game mechanic we have now. Yes, it sucks that you lost this item. But it was your own fault. Get over it and move on and don't try to get something from GMs you shouldn't have by trying to find excuses.
---
Oh believe me I have been. Blizzard is probably sick if my reporting by now.
---
My point is that your "advice/opinion" has been wrong far more often than not and as such you will mislead others into thinking the same way. You are missing out on the basics and more. Do more reading, test things in game, then read more, then maybe offer advice... Assuming you have come to different conclusions.
---
that early hellfire must have nearly killed you
---
How did the troll not see the alliance name above his head in red?
---
Almost certainly one of the goals for classic was to hook people on retail after they got bored. Maybe it's only 5%, but that's 5% of subs maintained from classic.
---
Nice?
---
This is why I’m happy the guild I’m in is so amazing!! Never have issues like these!
---
See that makes sense :p none of the people i play with are even on 5 days. But 6 days isnt that much...so not rly hardcore, but not that casual either
---
Google.
---
How do effectively run dungeons as a spell cleave group? Is there a correct way? What should I avoid?
---
Definitely wait imo. You’ll still be able to skin everything you come across as far as I’m aware and you’ll have more than plenty of time to level it the rest of the way post-mount.
---
Thank you, I am leveling as a BM and was in maraudon yesterday. Got the rifle which is pretty fast and wasn't sure if I should use it or the bow from the quest reward. I spent like 2 hours searching for an answer because every "hunter guide" I find tells me: Rotation is auto shot -&gt; aimed shot -&gt; auto shot -&gt; multi shot -&gt; ...  
---
But I don't even have aimed shot unlocked for four levels. So I guessed using the fast one (with better stats) and adding a +7 scope on top of it is the better choice, even though nothing I read or noone I asked said so. 
---
Because of your comment I feel much better right now because I thought I made the wrong decision!
---
The Night Elf lady hip wiggle is very hard to resist.
---
You're not. Even some streamers do.   The only non ingame ui I'd highly recommend is some type of Raid Frames.  But it's up to you.
---
Otherwise all UI's are completely personal preference.  I enjoy GW2 UI but I disable things like their quest tracker, their map, and their nameplates (I use tidy nameplates instead).
---
Through Vanilla I was a clean default UI player and it never held me back.  My tastes/preferences have just changed.
---
This seems to be a “thing” in communist/former communist places (Russia being another one). Culturally, cheating is thought of as the way to get ahead in these places. It’s the end results that matter, not the methods.
---
I say just buy it so you can continue training it. Better to have max level skinning sooner than worried about training it later.
---
The damage isnt from the horde tho. 0 hits.
---
[lol](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/738/025/db0.jpg)
---
No, I'm saying it makes no sense to be categorized under ungoro when it only involves feralas and winterspring.
---
man these redditors are sure triggered from your comment lol
---
Lol if i werent so sure this was a troll id be seriously concerned about your thought process

Dude is just a hero of the alliance. Salty hordies should just back off :D.
---
This, I really only use Frost Nova if they are coming for the Healer/DPS.
---
I hardly use Blizzard because it's not needed most of the time. Just causes too much aggro and mana to be worth it.
---
SL warlock is king of duels. I dont see how a hunter or shaman can keep up with warlock sustain, or even do enough damage for 2 VW sac shields, health stone, and death coil. Hunter will be tough if they can stay alive long enough.
---
Ahhh Ulda is so good. Fighting your way into the instance, fighting your way back out. A sea of stubborn, hearty dwarves and the homage to Greek mythology the whole way through. It makes you feel like Indiana Jones. And the BOE loot table is soooo good, in both vanilla and retail.
---
Level 24 here. But ive been playing too much TFT... would play too much classic if i had people playing it, but all i know got scared about nolifeing so no vlassic for them.
---
Far from Banthok sash though
---
How do warlocks and hunter solo it? Is jt because of the pet? The warlock pet isn't as good as the hunter one which is why im wondering how its done. Any guides for this?
---
I have had that bug since the beginning of classic, and none of the hunters ive asked about it have the same bug.
---
Before the cracked down on Census apps, my last scan showed that a vast majority of folk are still around 30.

you can just download addons from the source  (usually github)  and copy the folder to your wow/interface/AddOn folder.
---
Get the flight path in Freewind Post, Thousand Needles
---
He's clearly referring to the balance druid belt
---
There were hardly any mistakes in TBC. Only improvements.
---
Also yes the mage absolutely sucked that bad
---
I understand what you're saying, but again I think you're misinterpreting because it doesn't work that way. There is crit aura suppression against level 63 mobs but that doesn't mean you don't get extra crit from berserker stance. I'd check out the warrior discord they can probably give you better info that me.
---
A reason to immolate first is to tag a mob fast so it doesn't get tagged by someone else.
---
Nothing, he has just been hitting the gym a lot, you know... practicing mindfulness and meditation. Just getting his whole chakra aligned...
---
Or something. Also something about gains and whey protein?
---
its 0.33% crit
---
Vastly prefer it to the whelplings, it was so cool and unique back in vanilla
---
They have been! Coming from games like overwatch wheres its all toxic, WoW is a breath of fresh air
---
A little bit OT, but what add-on are you using to show the character Name and the amount of an item held by him/her?
---
Congratulations ;-)
---
That's the best thing I've seen here yet
---
I can only tell you how it is on Gehennas as an alliance character. It doesn't matter where I am, I get ganked by horde. Your hunter friend may be 60 for a week now because they nolifed at the beginning so they are ahead of the mass, or they chose the dominant faction on their server. Or both.
---
i always thought it was
---
https://youtu.be/vcY6vCuRSeg
---
Open trade after asking at least once is cool.  But if you open trade right away,  it just comes across as an ass hole move. Mage could be on a new water or food and it might take a minute. I usually will tell ya though if that's the case for me.
---
Imagine being an alliance kid triggered by a reddit comment

---
Armory boss is 40 and Cath bosses are 42. I ran them just fine at 35/38 respectively.
---
They could always log in and see full/high servers.. I can’t believe they actually thought it would die off that fast. Plus, theres almost 4 times the servers from launch now.
---
Doesn't really matter what you pick besides Clearcasting and all talents in the last 3 tiers.
---
Gather all the mobs in a room, usually a mage with mana shield. Then when you gather all the mobs use ice block, all the mobs should then be positioned in one spot so the rest of the group can aoe them down.
---
If not, just pool rage ahead of time.
---
Great read. Though I feel you didn't really explain why you feel multi boxing is bad aside from tons of people doing it now. Do you feel it ruins the immersion? Do you consider it a cheesey way to play the game? I need more info my man!
---
Didn't think I'd find a Desolace mark in here. I love that almost every zone is represented in this thread. I just finished the bulk of Desolace (at least 35ish questlines) and I'm happy to leave. I quipped yesterday that I hadn't quested in Desolace *since* Vanilla. It never appealed to me, but it deserves its place.
---
Shamans can purge that Sac if I’m not mistaken. And have grounding totem for fears or death coil. If we are talking two lvl 60 equal skill and geared players with Engineering. The shaman is going to beat the warlock with their toolkit and not to mention engineering would allow them to have a shadow reflection trinket which could very well be the reason why the shaman and hunter would have the edge. A hunter can drain the warlocks mana and cause them to go oom or drain their own HP which is a very valuable resource when fighting a skilled hunter. 
---
Shamans can also interrupt the warlock every six seconds or less with talents and gear sets.
---

&gt;I don't believe you can decay back to unranked unless you gain like... Zero honor for a long period of time.
---
So it doesn't decay... unless it does. Got it.
---
I want it o_o but I'd end up selling it anyway
---
The first 100g isn't too bad if you get lucky rolls on greens/blues you find while questing that you can sell for money on the AH. Either that or go gathering and you can farm mats to sell. It's having 1000g by 60 or, in the case of this mage, over 70,000g within a month of the game being out. I cannot fathom how they did that.
---
You should just practice pulling as many as you can before the eye dies. Other than that you can spam whatever makes you happy. The mages should kite everything so that nobody is getting hurt.

after 5 years working in customer support for a gaming company, EVERYONE who gets banned insists it never happened. False positive bans were less than 1%, so i'm going to go with the GM over the player who insists they did nothing everytime.

Paladins have the edge in single target healing but priests bring so much in their kit
---
every joke comment is downvoted to hell. not sure why exactly. maybe lot of these redditors are also unable to get it up.

I think the amount of debuff slots is exactly the same due to getting the balancing right
---
yeah im still 35 after 5 days of /played. fck out of here with that excuse
---
You're just killing time anyway, you've literally got nothing to do between raids since you've hit 60 and have pre-bis. So, roll a rogue on alliance on Faerlina. Not only will the population be higher, but the horde imbalance ensures you'll constantly have more to fight
---
I’m a rogue. You’d never not be stunned or blind.
---
What CD is that?
---
TBH, they may have not even trained it to save the gold. Might have figured it wouldn't be necessary.
---
"See ya nerd."
---
A few quests in stv for example require gathering/fighting underwater - worth it for that alone imo.
---
Currently have a lvl 41 priest, looking to go shadow for end game pvp and dungeons. Don’t really have aspirations to raid. I’m now wondering if I’ll have an easier time finding groups as a warlock and considering rolling a new character.
---
Because I'm lazy and my dps is minimal
---
This but unironically. Abolish the prison state. America has the highest incarceration rate in human history.
---
That's not the impression I got from what the GM said.
---
What addon are you using for the party health bars?
---
This is good stuff. Thanks chief.
---
Nope, just like with the reflector trinkets just need to have foresight. Luckily as a rogue you can choose when to fight, so swap trinkets/skull before engaging when appropriate.

I bet his name is Frances.

For tinker you dont really need a pet, you can just kite him forever.  For Princess, the pet helps to trigger her dust cloud, so that she stops chasing you.  Hunters otherwise get the cheetah for running, warlocks have a little more work to put in but still pretty easy, since siphon life basically keeps me up through the random boulder damage.
---
I can do rotgrip too, but its actually a gph loss since he's so time consuming, as you can otherwise fit 5 tinkerer/mara runs within 1hr lockout consistently.
---
Do you have equipslot, in lieu of equip macro?  If you're using a 2h, you may need to switch your mainhand first, as it may stop you when you try to put a shield on while using the two-hander.  Also, global cooldowns activated might mean you have to spam it a few times to get it to work.  I don't remember if weapon swaps cause GCD, been a while.
---
No, one is human and the other's a troll. Please, stop this "they"-pronoun sillyness.
---
&gt;his inventory and mouseover text are the main sources of clutter here. It wouldn't matter so much in a combat situation.
---
Idk man those action bars are ghastly.  He needs a quick rundown on macros.  Could take 1/4 those buttons off the bar with proper downranking macros.
---
I would equip it. It's pretty amazing on a Paladin for aoe farming once DM comes out and you can do lashers. As a nice bonus the lifesteal scale with 100% of your spellpower.
---
Id say whelps are better. Especially for a rogue.
---
why do u care that i care?
---
It's clear you don't understand how any of this works but I don't have the energy to explain it to you.
---
How the fuck does that shit work? Every time I log out and wait 15 minutes, or I have someone across the continent invite me to a party, nothing changes and I'm still on the same layer.
---
What part was difficult?
---
many of the mobs on this list also have ranged attacks
---
list is shit
---
i'm not talking about spy addons i'm talking about having a second "spy" account. and this was allowed in vanilla. reread my previous comment.
---
Oh my god, shut up you negative nancy. The guy lost an item and you tell him he is just finding excuses? Its not an excuse, an excuse is something you do when you try n weasle out of a lie or something. This guy is explaining a situation he found extremely negatively impactful.
---
You wanna spend $15/mo 5 times, go for it. You’ll be able to stockpile gold but you won’t learn your class role in groups.
---
Good luck with that.
---
When I scan with auctioneer it stop at around 1200 listings every time. 
---
Am I doing something wrong?

"Guards! Help me!"

I think they use VC to not confuse deadmines and diremaul when abbreviated
---
&gt; better vendor price
---
I tried installing it, it says "out of date".
---
Also reminding you for a quest log addon.
---
I dont believe so.  First off, you'd change it to master loot, or whatever you agree with them, since you are still personally running it for the drops/gold and only bringing them along because they need the ring.  Personally, i would set a price before inviting people, they tag along but they only have to pay if it drops (because RNG can be a bitch).  They pay, you assign the ring to them, ezpz.
---
That way they can bail if they want too, because rng can screw you.
---
because I don't want them to feel sad, they are nice enough people but it's just a shit guild to be in.
---
So u are against multiboxing because too many people do it? What kind of reason is that? Not considering you said u multibox aswell. So if you cannot have the advantage alone, noone should? Not sure what you are on about here, sorry. I for my part haven't seen a single multi boxer on my server so far. Probably because I am only lvl 29 so far, tho.
---
Ah ok thanks for the clarity!
---
I don't have the balls.
---
Check out the Mage in Vanilla Flavors of Wow on Youtube for a nice skit at the start of the raid XD
---
Thank you
---
It's like nautical bullshit, already have words for all the stuff but apparently we needed a bunch of new ones.
---
Nah, you're wrong.
---
You can on PvE Realms. Didnt try PvP.
---
Oh did I mention I’m alliance? Does this advice still work?
---
Sure, but isn't it just +1% dps, since you only miss 1% of the time?
---
Maybe that's why I enjoy being a Waiter IRL...
---
Hi there fellow Khadgar EU alumni! I used to play there at the absolute tail end of Vanilla and real heavy into TBC (Dacai/Diabolos Inferi). I also recreated my original toon, on a US server now. Too bad for the region divide, would have loved to meet up with people I played with back then.
---
you can get there without any glitches or disconnects, there are several paths up the mountain . It's nice to explore, the dwarven airfields, the mountaintop and the place you got to.  Before you know 2 hours have gone.   There is also a tunnel into the mountains that leads to nothing  (the void)   with slowfalling and an epic mount one used to be able to jump down inside this void , inside the mountain,  and land under ironforge in old iron forge.  but somebody who tried this already told me it has an invisible wall now :(
---
It's a weird bug from retail, it's real. In any case the NPC never accepts so it's just a random, pointless glitch.
---
There's a healbot for classic.... Well that needs a download
---
I like to bring Shadow Priests as a DPS for instances where Shackle can be a reliable CC.  They are also good when rolling with a Druid healer and a Warlock, boosts the Warlock's dmg, provides healing so Druid doesn't have to heal the lock as often, and you can Soulstone the Priest for wipe protection.
---
If you only have a single character, you could delete it, make a lvl 1 alt, and then restore the other character. Free rage whisper every two weeks if you don't have alt!
---
Similar question I figure I'd piggyback on, anyone know how to set this to a mouseover?  I like to mouseover while I'm currently grabbing other targets.
---
So you can bait the shadow trinket, warlocks have a shadow ward as well even if that is the case, and if I'm wrong the trinket only reflects one spell, so for that to be useful it would gave to be a shadowbolt, which a SL lock prob isnt hard casting. You can purge the shield sure, but they have so much more effective health other than that, and grounding totem only works on fear, not death coil, so if shaman drops grounding at the death coil you can then fear, which happens more often than not when I'm in WPvP as a lock. I've had the most issues with hunters but even then, sac void into fear pet, amplify curse and then wait for nightfall procs to finish hunter quicker. I get they have counters, but not sure these are clear cut wins for any class against a lock. Especially a lock with decent stam gear is going to be terror in P2.
---
I have a int gear full of cloth that I use during dungeons, but it's fine because most of the time I don't get hit. Is it still okay to use it while solo? I feel like I wil have to heal myself a lot.

I mean they’d have to delete their horde toon to do that would they not ? I tried to make a dwarf on my server to reserve a clever name I came up with and it said I can’t have a character of the opposite faction on a PvP server.
---
&gt;then come back later of course
---
They aren't leaving.
---
If your goal is to camp devilsaurs, you are naturally going to hang out at the spawn anyway.

You should share more of this because I didn’t even know there were rare spawns in Dun Morogh

That's a bunch of gold I'll never get back
---
Plz just dont report, more botters will eventually mean more gold sellers and cheaper gold. Right now its 1$-1gold. Its really ridiculous! Im lvl 36 and just saved 28G!!! By the time im 40 ill have to pay like 60$ to purchase a mount. Dont even talk about epic mount. I know some of yall dont really like gold sellers and stuff, but its really an essential service to casual players who want to be able to buy boe pre bis stuff and mounts. Please dont take this the wrong way
---
"dude getting items back isn't classic? Neither is layering..."
---
"Really? Neither is layering"
---
someone posted a thread on here about being banned solely for ganking so ur wrong it is becoming stricter and more care bear friendly
---
Minimum cost is 10g from the cost reduction
---
Is 500g in 6 months going to be more useful than 250g right now though? For me it certainly wouldn't be.
---
Stupid question here but why would you want to summon something that reduces your own defenses?
---
what are you saying ? that they are not viable late game ?  why ?
---
As a warlock I will get random whispers of people wanting a summons to where I am.  Like I carry 2 guys with me to help summon anytime
---
You got baited - youbaited - jebaited

Herb/Alchemy + fishing. You can sell + make your own potions while saving money for mount

Lonely fields of Arathi. Where once we watched the small free birds fly.
---
Disagree, but I respect your balls xD
---
I give those type of people rank1 food
---
Due to the fact we cant crit with mind flat and sw:p this is very wrong.
---
Well you are a gnome they look very dumb lol, most horde hate them
---
All albums of iced earth set on loop
---
That's a really good leveling speed. But even with that time, you had to have played wow as much as a full time job.

We didn't wipe. Dismissing Costs happiness which costs food which costs money. 
---
What is it about this community worshipping warriors.
---
Down ranking might not be the best plan for you, depending on your tank and the damage he's taking. Sometimes it's better to just let the tank go low, do two max rank heals and a renew and sit and regen.
---
For tanking, does battle shout cause threat every time its cast, or only when its fully ran out and then reapplied?
---
https://discord.gg/acNmn4A
---
I mean i over simplified it, i usually look at the greens and ask myself, will i ever do this quest.
---
I should really figure out which ones need to be done for chains though
---
You need fast offhand
---
Yeah you can also learn it if you're a warlock WAIT A SECOND
---
100000% agree with this, unless I say I need a mana break, pull away!
---
I don't think there's a 2g respec. Thought it was just 1/5/10
---
I’d say you should focus on questing. You will get no experience doing Deadmines.
---
No, those are the giant turtles from Warcraft 2.
---
Recklessness. 30 min cd that makes every hit crit during but you also take 20% more damage
---
There’s a white bear rare spawn that’s popular as a hunter pet because of how easy it is to get.
---
Nice, it feels amazing with it procs!
---
Take my fucking up vote you monster
---
Spriest did well at start of bc due to mana issues being fixed. They fell off fast because they still could not crit.
---
You're crazy if you think a warlock is at a disadvantage versus a hunter. They just have too much sustain.
---
Bunch of cry baby healers in here . Learn to be good .....
---
Okay dude, now go down to the local skatepark and graffiti acab all over.
---
&gt; to make another acc on opposite faction
---
People have multiple accounts.   You need a second account to do this.. No one is deleting their toon just to message cross faction lol.
---
r/ElsaGate
---
he said "again", never said he stopped.
---
I feel like they could have done some cool effects with a cartoon design. I would love a cartoon tv series following the main characters in lore in a sort of GoT style where they cut back and forth between different character plots.
---
Was not like this in vanilla
---
Can't even find a ubrs group cause literally everyone is still doing uldaman lmao.
---
I've been leveling as shadow and am level 41 now. I stopped training Renew and basically never use it and I've had no problem healing any dungeons so far. I definitely recommend flash heal as it's half the cast time of the greater heals. This means that if someone is about to die, they may not have time for you to get your 3 second cast off. 
---
On another note, I had to give up on tailoring/enchanting to be able to afford my mount, and I also had to grind the repeatable shellfish quest in Desolace and got around 30g from that around level 35.
---
You got a point there
---
What everyone should keep in mind is that MacBooks are simply not for gaming. But yeah I was surprised as well. I mean my MBP costs ~2700usd. But than again I did not buy it for gaming purposes ;)

okay but I wanna be super prepared for phase 2 and have the most possible fun, its a once in a lifetime thing.
---
Holy shit. Never expected my home city to come up here of all places.

He mentions the implications of multiboxing in BGs in the first paragraph. Although barely, he did state a semireason, and he didn't restate it at all. Still though
---
Well in a sense it was money well spent. If it made you happy its always a success
---
I don't wanna accuse you but fap kinda sounds like cheating you know. The mage doesn't use consumebals
---
Unsure what terrible spriest you have played with but on a 5man boss fight I can easily top damage. Problem is we suck at clearing trash and have no aoe so any boss fight with aoe we will be well behind.
---
Not for this minimal of chatter.  Maybe if someone started writing a rage text version of the illiad to another player.
---
So they get less sad if you aren't online?
---
At least on my server, leather pretty much only sells for vendor amount on the AH until Heavy Leather where it’s possible to make some money on the AH at that point.  
---
And with mining, make sure to compare the prices from ore to ingots.  Sometimes I can make over twice the amount selling ingots for the same amount of ore on the AH.
---
Great that you're playing with family, too -- almost a full dungeon group. Both my boys have expressed they love Classic, especially for the difficulty and how it requires actual teamwork.
---
Dawg.  Punctuation.
---
Reread the first paragraph?
---
that's exactly what i do and i'm having a blast lol
---
Bet she helps you pressing the correct keys at the perfect time ;)
---
Classic quests are really just thinly disguised grinds. Even though it took long to do, it wasn't wasted experience for later.
---
Immolate has a lot of damage front-loaded whereas SL is stretched over a significant period. There's also of course the fact that Immolate takes time to cast whereas SL is an instant dot. For PvP this makes Immolate big, but even in PvE being able to avoid the casting pushback is great, to say nothing of using it to tag. Immolate makes it easy to cause a mob to go into a "run away" stage, avoiding damage and hassle.  
---
In PvP and PvE alike it's very hard to get a moment to cast a real spell after the engage, especially if running around, so using it early means more time you can dedicate to moving / drain life. Do you really want to blow your surprise on something like SL instead of a shadowbolt, immolate, or even a Soul Fire if possible?
---
E: it can also be argued that you don't want all your dots to end at the same time because you have dead space where they aren't all active. Immo + CoA + corruption + SL will have Immo expire just about two seconds before corruption, letting you recast Immo and then refresh corruption.
---
Are you shadow, are you dwarf? You can solo maradoun doing princess runs. If you have herb or mining you can pick nodes there as well.
---
It also (potentially) keeps you casting more often and out of the 5sr. More to mana efficiency than hp/mana.
---
Get alchemy to 200, frost oil seems to be selling for 1g each, probably due to being an easy quest turn-in in Badlands
---
/r/WhyDoWeAddGateToTheEndOfEverything
---
I never have this problem tanking. I always watch others mana and call for a mana break. I kind of control the flow of the group. Then again I usually don't have a hunter in my group either.
---
SFK (Shadowfang Keeps) or BFD (Blackfathom Deeps) are your best options. Then, there's a bit of a gap before the level 29+ dungeons, RFK (Razorfen Kraul), Gnomeregan, and SM GY (Scarlet Monastery Graveyard).
---
Currently using default raid frames, but when in a 40-man raid all the groups are horizontal, which means that even on the smallest settings group 8 is in the middle of my screen. I've seen some people have the groups in two rows (1-4 and 5-8), but I can't seem to find a setting for it. Any ideas on how to move the groups around?
---
What do you mean by give up on tailoring/enchanting? Just stop leveling them or switch to gathering professions?
---
I don't really see the big deal with having them because cloth is sold at basically vendor prices on my server, and going back to level gathering profs at 37 seems like a terrible thing to do
---
From level 18 to where I am now, level 31, I don’t advertise myself in LFG.  I watch the ads, and answer for one I want to do then.  Most of the time.
---
I have, on occasion, said “Druid LFG for &lt;dungeon x&gt;; Tank / Heals / DPS; I bring everything to the table.”
---
55-60 instance actually.
---
I think what they mean is the armor and resistances. Bonus armor is always really nice to have.
---
Get to know the range, by the time you glance over to read a number you’ve been frost nova’d, blinded, etc.
---
Know the range, no need to read it is all I was trying to convey.
---
Because Classic is too easy.
---
I'm using Questie atm. At level 50, which "style" would you recommend?
---
 - A) flying all over Kalimdor / Eastern Kingdoms and doing **every single available** lvl 50 quest, then flying all over and doing **every single available** lvl 51 quest, etc.
---
 - B) Do all of the quests in a particular zone. I just finished Searing Gorge and Blasted Lands I think, so I think my next step is Ungoro?
---
Which guide did you use?
---
This isn’t true because most players are bad at PVP
---
Gnome Warrior has Escape Artist, Spiderbelt, Charge, and Intercept. Then you also have Engineering Gadgets, if you’re a good players regardless of class, you should have no problem beating anything you’re up against.
---
No, Anduin back when he was a child.
---
i gotta roll horde though, my friend is horde on there. I thought faerlina was 50/50, it says on wowpop website.
---
I have a second account so I can gank lowbie horde taking space in my quest area while I level my shaman.
---
The guards usually get taken out by the alliance elite patrol.
---
The thing about the Barrens is that they're responsible for like 90% of my sense of wonder, especially when I would aimlessly run around not really trying to level up. Mind you this was all around age 11 or 12. But yeah, I was sorta worried my adult brain would tarnish that feeling a la why Im only playing alliance nowadays :)
---
Pretty sure you get rage for how much damage a white hit does? 
---
Getting hit generates rage too and that’s where most of mine comes from, that’s why you do t want a priest bubble on the pull as well.
---
the 30s is where people who don't like MMORPGs burn out. probably a simpler, shallower game out there that will be released as "new" every year if you want something more up your alley. if you are rushing to the end, you're playing the wrong game. maybe you could buy a boost from retail and play it. they like to reward you for existing.
---
Not worshiping warriors, it’s just beyond idiotic to not dismiss your pet, know it could pull and still jump. Then make a lame excuse as to why.
---
Could be! I might be mistaken there.
---
Taunt the pet and it’ll hit you to break Freezing Trap, this will allow you to beat 99% of the Hunters who play
---
Yeah exactly. I need it for studying and everything else. Not being able to come back for wow classic was simply the straw that broke the camels back.
---
Ah thanks for the correction!
---
Pet keeps up just fine thanks, when he don’t it hasn’t been anything a disengage or feign death doesn’t correct.
---
What a headache....
---
look up booty bay gazette
---
Why even play classic? Youre the reason why i report botters.
---
What's a good and interesting solo class?
---
My main is a Ret pally, but I've been having a hard time ever since leaving Elwynn forest (Westfall was a pain, and Redridge isn't much different).
---
I saw a single Frost mage destroy a pack of enemies without getting hit, and that seems interesting. How are frost mages in-general for solo (no AoE groups)?
---
Hunter sounds like the safest bet, but I don't really hear of them being an *exciting* class when it comes to abilities.
---
Not sure how a Warlock, Warrior, or anything else would be.
---
This is what you need friend. https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sExu0xotZVf0tr
---
You can do top healing, and deal damage. Just forget about prot.
---
I have a feeling phase 2 is a ways off still.
---
The most crowded server will determine when phase 2 can be applied. The lower pop servers have to wait for the highest pop server to be ready. They won't do phase 2 on only some servers, and not others. Until they can remove layering entirely from the most crowded server, phase 2 won't happen.
---
Only Blizzard knows if the most crowded server population is dropping enough, or spreading out enough. But I feel like at least 2-3 months is a safe bet. You have time to level an alt to 60 even.
---
You think you’d want it for the third time but you don’t.
---
20 or below?  I’m 31 and tanked last night and healed this morning.
---
This is The torch runs i see you talk about right? Does a warrior have any place there are are we, yet again, getting the short end of the stick? I am close to my wits end trying to hit 60, hovering around 53 atm.
---
No one can see the future, man.

Putting screenshot next to autorun and taking a dive off the ship/zeplin.

So why do we have spell batching again?

DPS is very strong, but starts to fall off after BWL, but still decent.

The only add-on don't want to use... :-S Thank you:-)

Generally this type of message is neither covert nor demoralizing.  If the player resorts to this they're pretty sad and pathetic.  I'd generally get a morale boost from bothering them so much they have to rage chat and ignore me before letting me reply lol.
---
Depends on when you can afford your mount, if you wont be able to afford it in your early 40s, just get artisan.
---
except this isn't a false positive ban, it's just a ban for a bad reason. nowhere did they claim the ban was for rooftop camping, just the 'disruptive gameplay' of group-camping lowbies in a guardless area. which he fully admits to, despite everyone showering him in insults and downvotes for being an asshole. I have just as much reason to believe he was banned simply because blizz is (tacitly) taking a much stricter policy on griefing for the launch of classic WoW.

Ah yes, the Fell Reaver of Un'Goro Crater. My Camera is always on 360 in Un'Goro, even out of the danger zone....a habit so to speak.

Regression. The greatest way to age.
---
I had this happen with FFXIV inexplicably; turns out it was the specific VPN server I was using.
---
I've never had this happen in WoW Classic, so I can only assume it's a connection-related issue. Might be solvable with a VPN, but debugging via tracert and communication with your ISP may also be an option.
---
I die a little inside everytime I see some idiot that thinks survival = melee.
---
I blink in a lot of pictures. I feel your pain fellow she-chonks
---
No, because any reasonable person wouldn't have more than 1 account to go on an alt and harass you. I can see why some would have an extra account due to some of its benefits, but if they deliberately go out of their way on their alt just to talk shit, they aren't that reasonable.
---
Fun fun but why did you feel the need to post it on Reddit
---
I just use 1-7 number keys, then Shift+1-7 number keys for some downranked spells or skills like psychic scream. I'm level 41 and haven't needed much more than that. When I do, I'll just add ctrl+1-7 keys most likely
---
 I also have tons of skills I haven't learned because there's not much point in having them yet, and I wanted to ensure that I'd have enough gold for my mount by 40. Most of a shadow priests damage is from your wand specialization anyways, so make sure to keep your wand upgraded as often as possible.
---
Perception
---
I need a new place to level cant cant find any quests that aren't red. 
---
 I'm at level 48 and playing alliance.  I've done Stranglethorn,feralas and the hinterlands.
---
Thanks, your voice is important. I would also like to add the following:
---
Mage water, at least the rank we have access to right now for the most part, will restore 2934 mana over 30 secs.
---
If both the healer and the warlock sit down and drink, they will be regening mana at the same rate (duh).
---
However, even without any scaling from gear and without talents, here is the raw healing per mana of some healing skills;
---
*Please note, I am not bothering to work out which is the most efficient as this isn't required to illustrate my point, however if I did go through the effort to find the absolute best efficiency it would only reinforce my point further...*
---
Healing Touch (Rank 11): 2257 - 2677 healing for 800 mana
---
Greater Heal (Rank 5): 1966 - 2194 healing for 710 mana
---
Holy Light (Rank 9): 1590 - 1770 healing for 660 mana
---
Healing Wave (Rank 10): 1620 - 1850 healing for 620 mana
---
As you can clearly see, healing heals for more health than it costs in mana - point for point.
---
For warlocks, health is literally mana, and it gets even better because the overwhelming majority of warlocks you will ever meet will be taking improved lifetap, which add a multiplier to our health &gt; mana conversation. Now, each point of health is worth 1.2 points of mana for the warlock when lifetapping, so you can add another 20% to the above figures.
---
Conclusion; as far as mana as a group resource is concerned, instead of viewing it as a selfish resource like the OP *which ironically seems to be his point of warlocks being the selfish ones*, then healing a warlock who is life tapping for mana is 3 or 4 times more efficient because of how heals cost less mana than they heal for and the further interaction with improved lifetap.
---
It's not because they're so tall, it cause everyone else is so good Damn short.
---
Don't think so
---
Maybe look up paladin leveling guides? Maybe you are missing something that makes leveling easier?   
---
Warlock leveling is very easy, so is priest  and druid for example
---
Thanks man, no idea how that happened
---
Don't give people bad advice like this, auto cast is pointless till you've gotten some gear at 60, before that 1-2 growls will keep aggro.
---
Why does priest mind control last like 3 seconds? It says it’ll last up to a minute but even when I do it on someone 30 levels under me it last at most like 5 seconds. But mages polymorph lasts like half a minute?
---
its worth a fucking lot too, because of its debuff for certain bosses in aq40
---
it pushes out a nasty debuff from the queen iirc
---
Most classes have a pvp and pve spec, but SL is a bit different because it's only great for just duelling. It's not great for any other general 'real' pvp (although it is okish), and it's terrible at any sort of pve (whereas even frost mage/sub rogue aren't that bad).
---
Are you horde or alliance? Kirtonos is about 55h/45a.
---
You have to understand that you’re in a tiny tiny minority of players right now. Go try to 1v5 some big groups of 40-50s or something. That’s about the only challenge I can think to recommend to fill your need.
---
Faerlina and literally every other PVP server has the same horde to alliance ratio roughly. Most are around 55/45 horde to alliance. If you’re playing horde and can’t find any alliance to kill then lol.
---
To reiterate: you’ve no-lifed to level 60. There are very few level 60s currently. It doesn’t matter what server you play on. You’re on a high population server. You’re just way ahead of everyone because you have more free time than everyone else. If you want to fight people you have to wait a few months.
---
If you’re going off raw numbers, the majority of the fan base didn’t even start until the 2nd expansion!
---
Also it looks like the phases are gonna be fairly spread out based off rumors so you have plenty of time even if leveling slowly :)
---
did the character say 'EY MON'? lmfao
---
thats hilarious
---
Imo it’s mostly the layout of dungeons, I have a ridiculously poor sense of direction and having no dungeon map is a disaster waiting to happen... :(
---
Especially in dungeons with multiple floors that intertwine and whatnot
---
I tanked a few dg (lvl 57 now) I got few groups with spriest as dps.
---
They topped the meter almost everytime in single target. Also taking aggro more than any other classes.
---
Don't know if the otherd were so bad to play their role but definitely not reluctant to bring spriest as Dps in the future
---
you're gonna have to buy mats but it's not expensive to level right now (higher levels it might be but they're not exactly cracking down on botting right now which means cheaper mats)
---
you're not gonna like having to go to dungeons to make certain high level potions though
---
Bloodsail Buccaneers is the PVE-RP server on Classic. 
---
I'm seconding linen bags. Cheap and easy to make and the low level players would go crazy for it.
---
 Hope you enjoy, I feel like this section of Stratholme's lore goes severely unappreciated so I tried to put some emphasis into it!
---
Is that just a modified elvui or do you have an addon that moves your buffs/debuffs? Been looking for one forever!
---
Because the base UI is really bad for tracking the information you need quickly. With a 24 inch or bigger monitor, the amount of eye movement you need to track info in the default UI is really unreasonable. You can say 'but i play fine with base UI', but unless you've played with a more advanced UI, you have no clue how hard you're shooting yourself in the foot. 
---
Buff bars in africa to the top right, hard to track procs and other coming and going buffs/debuffs. Your health bar is in africa to the top left. Default action bars are too low and too wide. You can cemtralize just about every bit of info you need theough addons.
---
Default was great for the monitors in 2004.
---
Lots of clicking going on
---
Gonna get crucified for saying this but retail does look waaay better than Classic. 
---
But that's the price of better gameplay, unfortunately.
---
If you don’t mind buying the herbs off the AH or if you have another character that picks herbs to mail to you alchemist, it’s fine.
---
but in action house it was galisea lol maybe i read it wrong
---
I get Error 132 every time I try to use full-screen mode. I've tried disabling Game Bar, and I'm running WoW as admin. Anyone have a fix, or am I stuck with normal Windowed mode?
---
Not a very clever response by the GM, since layering was also not in vanilla. Bit of hypocrisy in there. Hope you get your item back.
---
Did you start referring to her bra size as "AQ40"?
---
Horde dominate ashenvale
---
Then Alliance dominate hillsbrad 
---
Then alliance dominate STV 
---
But Horde dominate the entrance to SM
---
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be

is there some secret why people keep posting cat photos? I like cats they are cool but do you really come to this subreddit to look at peoples pets?

If you have an almost level 60 character already, you’ve been playing a lot.

In dungeons, I always /thirsty and /beg the mage and they usually get it right away
---
So do you not switch to Ele until 38? Just starting a new shaman and looking for talent guidance.
---
they can go OOM in classic and will run at you then but no, most non-warlock style casters will cast at range until they can't anymore. waht you do doesn't matter unless you're burning them
---
Why not?
---
Over the course of longer fights the judgement of crusader buffs your holy dmg (seal &amp; judgement of righteousness) enough to be worth it, but from my experience the seal by itself is only useful for getting pushback against casters w/ the faster attack speed.
---
what kind of unemployed moron must that be lol, he must have played several hours a day and then he just resets it, sane person doesnt do shit like that
---
&gt;I find myself running @ 3/4 to half mana nearly the whole dungeon.

As long as you're not wiping because you oom, this is perfect, you never want to have full mana.

I hate this so much &gt;.&lt;
---
How do people in this subreddit get the cool faction/class icons next to their names??
---
WoW makes people happy, cats make people happy. Combine the two, win win
---
Get the dagger from the last boss from sm lib and the umbral crystal boe for offhand. Then get the inventors focal sword from mara. This should hold you over until mc epics. Can grind out a of shadow wrath drake stone but it is completely unnecessary and long
---
To add: DPS should have as much uptime as possible, while heals generally doesn't need to have constant uptime. 
---
Heal warlock-&gt; warlock goes to dps and tank goes to pull-&gt;healer sits and drinks for another ~12 seconds because tanks don't take that much damage-&gt; group is more efficient.

Any gear that drops in the world is a world drop. Most are greens with random stats. Sometimes you will see a unique named blue or purple item, those are the rare and valuable ones.

They are a thing once yo I get the hit gear to make your attacks....HIT
---
Arms tanking is the low level version of the fury tanking max tps builds you can use for raids. Metas change, right now tanking with a shield is probably optimal for endgame dungeons BEFORE you get gear.
---
If you haven’t seen how much threat doing what I’m talking about generates in the first 5 seconds of the pull don’t say something else is better. I’m not sure how much theorycrafting/testing/engage vanilla experience to u have as a warrior so I’m not going to say you suck, but there are options. Once you can get your hands on the 2 handed mace from mc that aoe stuns and some decent tank gear you can go back to tanking the endgame dungeons with a 2 handed weapon all day. Your opener virtually guarantees a long aoe stun on the mobs and if your group is as geared as you are at that point they are going to dead dead before it’s worth going defensive stance worrying about threat.
---
I feel you, brother.  I hit it HARD the first week, barely slept, and I got sick over the next weekend.  My wife wasn't happy about that.

Not surprising.

My libido, sex drive and performance drop just because I'm on a caloric deficit despite eating somewhat clean and exercising and sleeping well. Can't imagine what it would be if no exercise, bad food and bad sleep.

Youre extremely agro for someone so aggressively mediocre

Appreciate it but "download" is the only option I get, under the 3 dots in the lower right.

which is about camping in spots that neutralize the existing guards via an exploit, not about camping in a guardless area...
---
Tauren be like: Oh ffs might as well scratch my ass!
---
You need to follow the other person inside, at least almost all the way to princess, but you can easily do that without aggroing anything.
---
Q
---
Pizza gate was probably real
---
Semi - false, poisons work off of a PPM (proc per minute system) and the best speed for an offhand is between the 1.80-2.00 or 2.00-2.20 (improved poisons) mark which isn’t typically considered fast as there’s 1.30 daggers/fist weapons out there. The reason being is because, with two swords, your auto attacks now have a 10% chance to proc sword Specialization, which can also proc poisons but you will always hit max stacks of poison PPM by then anyways.
---
And you are below mediocrity because you were wrong and I was right. So how about you shut up, sit down and let daddy teach you how the game works?
---
I'm glad it helped you!

Very cool. What’s the energy tick addon? I like how it all fits

have you reported him ?

This is the classic experience and a year ago dozens of threads were posted asking for exactly this to happen
---
Pretty stoked, first time ever beating Onyxia in vanilla (I started in 8.1 BFA, so I'm fairly new to WoW) - most of us had pretty poor resists, I think we had a lv59, and a small pug group in general. Took us around 4-5 wipes to get it.
---
Time for me to reroll Hunter I guess. Can’t wait to prove the melee unbelievers wrong!
---
/sarcasm

But legit, a little bit curious on just how bad this is.
---
Thank you very much for the support!
---
Scarlet Monastery dagger + warlock quest shadow damage offhand (orb of dar'orahil)
---
Switch out the warlock offhand for spirit of aquementas when you complete the un'goro questline
---
Swap the SM dagger for inventor's focal sword or witchblade at 60. You can get the focal sword earlier, but all it offers is crit which isn't very valuable while leveling since almost all of your damage is dots and you almost certainly don't have ruin talented.
---
Just hang out, chill and slaughter or whatnot
---
Neither the professions he mentioned bring any benefit to the character having it, so they're very well suited for alts.
---
Off hand is a very minor part of your dps, especially before you have dual wield spec. There's no reason at all to slow down your levelling chasing a  good off hand.
---

Step 1: Buy a stack of Bleach.

Step 2: Have a random open trade with you demanding drinks.

Are you putting ores/bars up on the ah in stacks of 20? I’ve been doing 5 each and my copper bars and bronze bars don’t last on there more than an hour or two before someone grabs them.

If it's a pvp server it's not 50/50

---
I have been leveling an enhancement shaman, and I’ve made it to level 48. I’ve noticed my dps start to lag behind others pretty significantly, and I’m aware of Enh’s reputation as a “meme spec” for late game.
---
1. Is this because it just can’t ever keep up with other dps specs at 60?
---
2. If I wanted to transition to resto or ele, how and at what level would I do that? It seems like groups wouldn’t be cool with me needing on gear for a spec I’m not currently running.
---
FYI, Shamans make incredible tanks up to about Mara.
---
Press blizzard hotkey is a tactic.
---
Lol u dumb
---
I just stopped putting any money into those professions for now. I'll go back to them once I am good on gold and can afford to. At 40, I spent 90g on my mount and at least 10g on skills to train. Now I'm down to only a couple gold, so money is tight right now
---
Also, I believe if you unlearn a profession, you'll still maintain the level you were at if you ever switch back to it. I'm not 100% sure though.
---
Because only psychopaths want to add up their easily sorted/divided bags into one big mess
---
Ace, thank you
---
2h fury is a thing too
---
That's why you pull out your 2hander and start dpsing. The hunters obviously want to tank so let them tank.
---
They've never really done abnything about it in Gadgetzan, so I doubt they intend to do anything about it elsewhere.
---
Time is money, friend.

They are awful at PvE. In PvP they are pretty good. Until they go oom at least! Plate armour, heals, freedom. In world PvP even more so compared to BGs as bubble and lay-on-hands are likely to be off CD. Most use 2h weapons too meaning very nasty crits.
---
You should probably Google "warrior leveling guide wow classic"
---
Can you elaborate more on grinding? Are you saying you purely grinded or just grinded a lot to and from quests etc?
---
It's bad for a few reasons. I actually typed this out while my buddy was begging me to go quest with him so I forgot to state why it's bad...
---
1-Multiboxers this early on in the quantity I'm personally seeing them will have an effect on the economy at Max level. Unless people form full groups, they have the potential to camp many lucrative spawns without giving other people a chance. In addition, just raw gold farming, they can make some serious bank through just grinding mobs. Mobs will fall over to them and they have 5x the bag space for stacks of tusks, fur, claws, or whatever else vendor trash that is dropped.
---
2-In Phase 2 when layering is gone is when we will really see a problem. It was annoying enough for a rogue to camp an entrance and you had to hope you didn't get stun locked while travelling to places like BRM and if someone happened to be walking by or you were going as a group, you will be fine. Now, we can end up in a situation where the only entrance is being camped by a multiboxer who is just deleting people without much of a fight.
---
Sure, PvP happens on a PvP server, but this related to my next point.
---
3-Classic is about nostalgia. There is nothing nostalgic about multiboxing Classic because Multiboxing in Classic was near non-existent.
---
People wouldn't be required to form a raid group to take down some guy running 5 toons at once in Vanilla. And if they did, the person was significantly easier to kill back then because of hardware and software limitations. The software to multibox these days is very simple to setup if you have a little competency with understanding video instructions.

warriors are the slowest class to level. there is no speed involved. at low levels you mostly have to hope for a hit on your next autoattack and if you pull 2 mobs and get bad RNG luck, you are going to die. your dps at 20 with a good 2h is similar to a mage's dps at level 7 and half as good if you get 2 misses.
---

If that's the case he's even dumber. Water breathing is super helpful for many quests that require diving. Also it doesn't even cost that much.
---
for rolling alliance vs horde racials? sure
---
Don’t tell him that general chat is layered
---
I can understand the anxiety of seeing someone in your party at basically no health as a healer, but if there isn't AoE damage during a fight then everyone benefits from the warlock life tapping to pump out more damage. Consider just throwing out your most efficient heal like a renew on the warlock when they're life tapping. 
---
Life tap **isn't a luxury, it's an essential part of doing damage as a warlock**. Healers who complain about life tap are really just putting their inexperience on display for all to see.
---
Sims 4 will even tell you the exact number of people playing it globally and it's not even multiplayer.
---
Are you a real person?
---
Or maybe he took advantage of the layering and then at the end of it realised “what’s the point if I feel like I cheated”
---
He thinks hes training cia operators.
---
Every so often there is a resist check where the target will 'roll' to see if mind control breaks. The threshold for the resistance check is going to depend on a lot of factors.
---
It's quite literally the opposite of what you said, it's an item that he should have but doesn't because of a feature that wasn't present in Vanilla.
---
Up until level 40 warlocks should respec to drain tanking, but until then spirit is very valuable to us.

it's called Shadowed Unit Frames:  [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/shadowed-unit-frames](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/shadowed-unit-frames)
---
To be honest I don't fully recall the details but I believe you get the Scout / Private title after reaching 25 honorable kills, which you can get pretty easy just by doing a few battlegrounds at most, probably just 1 if it goes well.
---
edit: here's the list of titles, requirements, and rewards: https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-pvp-system-overview#honor-ranks-and-titles
---
You just made the list.
---
Wondering about this as well. Personally I've had to play as a healer as I won't get into groups as ele or enh

Precisely, this speeds up the entire dungeon so much.

As a mage, i never have a problem helping others out. Even offer my Alchemy potions if need be

---
Spirit is actually very valuable to warlocks until you respec at 40 while leveling assuming you're doing things optimally (and take imp drain soul).
---
Completely justified in rolling on spirit gear.
---
congrats you found the worst mage in the world
---
What rogue abilities can pierce a paladin's blessing of protection? Blind? Kick? Anything?
---
Not necessarily, it doesn't tag until it does damage, which isn't immediate. I've lost many mobs after tagging with SWP only to see a warrior charge out of nowhere and melee it before my dot does damage. Wand is the quickest, but the range isn't as good as swp unfortunately
---
Warrior is the worst solo pvp class in the game. However pvp in vanilla is 90% about preperation. Having good gear, having pots, having the right spec and knowing roughly what to do about each class. If you have all that, you will only really lose to people who also are really good, which is far and few between. 
---
Go play what you enjoy my man, and come back a true champion.
---
“That” viable. Still usefull in every stage of the game :) Just not as much as other pure dmg dealers when they venture into AQ40/Naxx. Before that they are OK on the dmg charts, just not at the top.
---
For PvP i dunno.
---
This guy invests
---
Yeah, that's what I'm doing currently. Trying to save having to rebuild macro every time I get an upgrade.
---
Is there a macro to swap mh with oh without naming item?
---
I leveled a paladin. You're most likely not doing anything wrong. We don't have many dps abilities so you cast judgement, get your seal buff and wait. Kill 1 mob, repeat. That's about it :D (side note, i leveled tanking as prot and personnally i enjoyed it more than solo content)
---
Comparing to mages means you're comparing to the strongest class, and paladins look silly in comparison. Though, keep in mind AOE grinding doesnt start until minimum 20-23 for mages. They remain the strongest class for leveling both solo (when done right) and in groups.
---
Blood Fury is affected by gear, nice read though.

Yup! I actually started playing my lvl 16 druid again and am excited to get all the different forms. Is aquatic form really the hassle people say it is?
---
This is absolutely true, and even at 60 I'm not sure that I rate SM/Ruin higher than Dark pact for 5mans. You get ruin which is nice, but in pre-raid gear your crit isn't going to be particularly high so you don't benefit a great deal. When you do crit with ruin you also tend to just rip aggro which isn't especially helpful.
---
Meanwhile, keeping your mana up without DP is a struggle unless your group is stellar and the healer has no mana concerns at all so that you can life tap to your heart's content. I often end up having to blow through 80 runecloth worth of bandages per dungeon and still get left behind while trying to bandage on a regular basis. Being able to dark pact on the run is super helpful and I really miss it.
---
I have Questie, doesn't do anything to the quest log for me. Is there a separate file for it?
---
I played undead in retail for so long that i forgot breathing was a thing and have drowned twice already out questing as a human.
---
Man you’re a little bitch, send your girl my way
---
Can they still off tank at 60?
---
Battlegrounds are coming next patch
---
&gt;:(
---
Pretty sure they are. His point about more people being in. BGs and not out doing world pvp still stands though.
---
If you were on moonguard you weren't the only one.... Spent all my money on vendor whites because they had higher armour. Just me and me bear and raptor strike.
---
Searing gorge and blasted lands can work. You will have more quests appear in Hinterlands, Feralas, and Tanaris that require you to run between them. Maraudon (dungeon) is also doable
---
What made you so hurt to reply to me 3 days later? Im sorry it kept you up at night?
---
I'm guessing it's because every game that tries to implement weird tank specs tends to make them not good enough, which pisses off the people trying to play them as well as the viable tanks whose gear gets taken. Dodge tanks are the standard example that never works.
---
Raw, of course
---
All hunters and warlocks are like this
---
Ah no sorry just to track quests etc. my bad
---
This was reported day 1 in the beta and was confirmed to work as intended.
---
just because 3 people listed at 100g does not mean it sells at 100g. i don't know anythng about healing or cloth gear so i wanted it out of my bags.
---
It sounds like items aren't logged before they are looted, so it's probably a technical issue since they can't prove your claim. If they make an exception and restore the loot in good faith, they'll open Pandora's box.
---
Interesting predicament. Seems like an extremely specific mod could fix that. Check the bottom of the barrel for sound mods.
---
Lol you're taking this way too personally.
---
Literally unplayable.
---
Big tip: I do this all the time as a furbolg.
---
Do the ashenvale-quest that awards "Dartol's Rod of transformation". Abandon the Q and keep the item. Then, head over to a horde zone, toggle walk and wait a bit.
---
Horde will think you're an NPC, rare spawn (because you have a name). Surprise surprise when they attack you, they get flagged and you turn back into a night elf with 2 poisoned blades and all your CD's
---
Problem is that there are a lot of priests out there who want to be the guild's shadow priest. And if you start allowing priests to go shadow you struggle on the healer count. And they bring less dps than a mage or a lock. 
---
Spriests are going to want the mage/lock loot as well, which is going to create tension, because the mages and locks will say "this guy's doing shit dps regardless, why not give the piece to a class that can actually get dps out of it?" but you can't tell one dude in your raid that he's never get a piece of gear, ever, because then he just gquits.
---
It can create a lot of animosity between priests within a guild if you only allow 1 priest to go shadow - why him and not me? 
---
You have to think about the social mechanics behind having meme specs in your raid as well as the game mechanics. It's true for every meme spec, really. Realistically, any raid could carry an enh shaman or a balance druid. But it creates tension and can lead to infighting and gquits. 
---
Imo it's always the best policy to disallow meme specs across the board, it feels a lot less personal when it's a blanket rule and it just prevents all those hard feelings that are bound to emerge if players feel like they're being treated unfairly or that some of the raiders are getting special treatment.
---
You always do. You want to stay within dead zone so they can't intercept you or run out of range. It is a lot safer than playing far away because you have more control.
---
Well it took me 2 days with constant horde ganks and the ocasional ally stealing mobs. I was literally stuck and couldn't do anhthing other than log in, check the area and log out until it was free. Almost made me want to level alts while waiting.
---
Rouges
---
ghouls?
---
A new player who will propably use searing totem most of the time while leveling should propably not try to totem twist and its not a requirement to beat MC and BWL, so why bother until then?
---
It's in, it only drops off of the horde of trainees that run at you after Herod. It's also common quality and BoP so there's no rolling or trading for it.
---
It is fun how you try to justify getting this set so much. Every comment you make you are telling people how it makes sense that you spend time and gold getting it

If you can get one. I feel like they accidentally broke his drop rate. In 8 ZF runs, I've seen the gloves once and the staff never. 7/8 Zum'rah kills got us a bad green and 12s from the "chest".
---
Thats correct, and its a lvl 20 quest iirc. Worth doing asap. 
---
Cooking to lvl 60 is really easy. Just do some fishing and cook up the fish
---
A few quests in felwood are good in that level. Also maybe swamp of sorrows or rather Blasted Lands. Bladted should have some great grindquests, at least for horde
---
I’ve done about ten aoe runs as a priest, mostly 4 mages and myself. I’ve done it with 3 mages and a warlock as well. Typically we have a mage with ice barrier and pw: shield pull. Then if it’s a big pull we just have the mage block when we gets to us and stack rain of fire/blizzard on him to pull aggro, overall pretty straightforward.
---
iirc bloodrage is more threat than tclap and it hits more than 4. i'd rather spend the rage on the first sunder on the main target.
---
Why should there be? There’s stats available online already, collected by various census addons.
---
More than half of players will never even reach level 60 on 1 character. You’re also on the faction that has more tryhard no lifers and has better pvp racials. Idk what else to tell you, it’s pretty simple.

Unfortunately I don't remember what server I was as my account got hacked and everything deleted and as kid I didn't know what to do, only got it back around 1 year later when I emailed blizzard. But I did the exact same thing I remember vendoring greens and blues to buy whites from the vendors in town and when I got asked why I had that I would just reply "it has more attack/armor".

I still had the most fun I ever had in a video-game and Wow will always have a special place in my life because of it

Protip: Cast eyes of the beast to manually jump the pet down, then immediately jump down, it's a little faster than dismissing
---
That's awesome! And that priest guy can fuck right off.
---
Well just depends on how much gold people have. Not many people will be willing to buy that item this early on. Id wait until you are at 700g when trying to get your epic mount and see what its going for. The logic is that it will cost a lot more later on when people have more gold farmed up.
---
You aren’t allowed to use mounts/ghost wolf etc in BB.
---
You picked a rather slow leveling and difficult solo class unfortunately. Frost mage can just about do it all in terms of damage and farming and is really only held back by the skill of the player. 
---
Hunter, Warlock, Mage, and Druid are recommendations I would throw out for what it seems you want.
---
I know you wrote in the hunter may seem uninteresting which can be true for some grinding but all classes can get like that imo. Hunter has a good toolkit and a pretty good variety of things it can do.
---
That’s some solid advice right there
---
Cute cat !  Miss having one .  Our two shih tzus are great questing buddies though.

Yeah, I remember using an add-on in WotLK that made engineering chopper a lot more quiet, because they were so loud. Maybe there's something like that.

I'm not sure what the sword or cape is.
---
They should just prevent players from rolling a character on Full servers if they don't already have an existing character on the server.
---
I thought they already did this but it may have been introduced in later expansions.
---
For real! My wife and I just rewatched the two towers last weekend and was so good we had to watch Return of the King the next day. Definitely keeps its quality. There are a few cinematography  techniques that dates it, but by no means comes close to ruining it (like the dramatic choppy slow-motion scenes they like to do).
---
I still have yet to see any of the extended editions. I'll have to do that soon - since I joined wow at the start of TBC so I'm experiencing vanilla for the first time; night as well experience extended edition for the first time as well!

Did it today in Bloodhoof village, thanks! Gave away 3 stacks of cooked fish to a random lvl 5 Tauren.

You can take all secondary professions: cooking, fishing, first aid etc
---
Ur ugly irl
---
You let your kid watch this shit?
---
Just making sure, what you said remains true up until the cost is 10g :)
---
You can pick up cooking, fishing and first aid anytime and you can pick up all three. First aid will 100% compete with tailoring resources. And unless you need the bandages I’d suggest using leftover cloth or not bothering with it.

---
Warlock is sort of exciting as you put it. You can often take on 2-3 or more mobs at the same time or chain kills into more pulls with fear and just keep going for long time. Its dangerous, and you use your hp for mana so you’re never safe, but can be very effective. Other than that; exciting isnt really what grinding or levelling is about if you play it safe lol. Probably warlock or warrior.
---

---
If I remember right, it is close to the same level of viability as swords for leveling since the stuns keep you out grinding longer but is vastly outclassed compared to swords in dungeons.
---
Wow, that's a great tip, thanks!
---
You want to be hitcapped for yellow attacks at the very least, and that's 9% (6% for humans using swords/maces, orcs using axes, dwarf hunters using guns and troll hunters using bows). Hit is highly sought after for warriors. Rogues get 5% hit and 5 weapon skill from their talents. Warriors rely on hit for their procs. You want to hit swings so you generate rage, you want to hit your abilities and swings so you can proc Flurry, etc. It's the same reason warriors scale exponentially with gear compared to other classes. Better stats = more damage and more rage, which equals even more damage.
---
Hunter hitcap is the same as yellow attacks, 9%. You don't want to be missing tranq shot, which is why hitcap is mandatory.
---
Spell hitcap is 16%, and it always has a 1% chance of missing (missed spells show up as "resist").
---
TL;DR hitcap is wanted because more hits = more procs, and even more damage. You don't need to be fully hitcapped (nobody ever is) for dual-wielding white swings, but you want to hit the yellow hitcap at the very least.
---
They're just rats that have mutated from magic energies.

Completely missed that addom! Thank you!
---
What level are you? Once you have BT you shouldn't be pooling rage anyway. You probably should be staying in battle stance fighting mobs one a time anyway, but yes you can switch for OP if you're in zerker (like in an instance), after WW/BT to dump rage. Execute is very efficient damage, when it's not spending a ton of rage. You shouldn't be pooling rage, and you should be executing as soon as you can.
---
I always just start fishing while waiting. That or i take a dump.
---
And then usually miss it again because i got sucked into this subreddit

Because playing the game properly and doing everything you can to help yourself and your group progress is a good thing? Genuinely, what is it with the mindset of people like you who somehow think it's okay to just half-ass everything and get carried? You're already playing a Shaman at this point, trust me, you need to be doing everything you can to get your spot in a decent group lol.

Is your enjoyment of a class worth making your teammates work twice as hard to make up for your lack of dps?

Honestly anyone that plays a meme spec and whines about not getting invited is a selfish prick.

that is why blizzard should have paid transfers so I don't have to worry about this.

No BGs are phase 3, honor comes in phase 2

Kirtonos has the third worst horde/alliance split, the Horde outnumber alliance 2 to 1. Just check WoWheads census.
---
This makes leveling for the average player much harder. 
---
Literally had to just grind mobs in desolace if it was prime time. You step foot into stv and get corpse camped by a group of 3-5 until you leave the zone and go elsewhere, meaning even more travel time. 
---
This is a theme in a lot of zones 30+. 
---
Add in previously mentioned % of the playerbase still leveling and it’s no surprise at all you can’t find a ton of alliance 60s yet.
---
Also morning-afternoon is the lowest pop time on kirtonos especially. it usually only hits high/full during prime time (after 5est). 
---
Check out census data for the transferable realms, from what I’ve read it’s become fairly common for whole guilds to transfer over to raid without ques - May increase the pop % of 60s. A more even A/H split may also help. 
---
Source: play alliance on kirtonos. Currently 43 because work is da poop

That's pretty weak
---
Thank you. Didn't think of that. On one of my runs, our tank had thought that being on the stairs caused the adds to spawn, "stay away from the stairs like the plague." Then after the first wipe he raged and kicked the hunter for standing on them again :D
---
This is good advice too.
---
but they are vanilla.
---
Brave brave sir Robin
---
Many people have gotten into Classic (and PS vanilla before this) as their first game. But yes, it's also not surprising it's not for everyone. I mean everyone gets frustrated playing it, it's just some people see the fun in the frustration I guess.  
---
There's plenty of people in both camps - end game is way more fun and levelling is a huge boring chore to get there, and also - levelling is the game and end game is stupid. I'm probably in both camps depending on which day you ask me.
---
What does you being 60 have anything to do with it?
---
If you mean the "Not a bug" list, its not in there.
---
theramore would be the connecting
---
I’ve seen multiple YouTube videos saying you can do princess runs as shadow and watched a few videos of it being done. No source because mobile but that’s my current plan when I hit 60.
---
It's nice in pvp when I can get a good clean hit between kiting someone while I heal. I'd agree in PvE only the stats matter.  Mana is limited and that makes infinitely shapeshifting impossible.
---
Interrupts aren't "nothing". Stunning the mobs right as they are about to run isn't nothing. 
---
Hell with blade fury you have some pretty good aoe dps as well. And if you are running with mages by the time they are done drinking your blade fury cd will be up.
---
Just many rogues in the leveling dungeons don't bother to use the utility they have.
---
Why would someone want to arbitrarily handicap themselves?
---
I can literally get twice the xp/hr in spellcleave and get to 60 faster.
---
Umm pretty sure that is an addon?
---
Rare spawns. If you check out that youtube video, it tells you all the information you need. I kept this simple to leave it open for Huzzah show in detail.
---
Arkinventory let's you set up categories for things and does the count of items thing... It takes more time to set it up how you like it but it's worth it to be able to organize everything and still have separation imo. (Adibags also does the category system, not sure about count though but if it does then iirc that was a great in between the two, less customization but also more of a plug and play without being just a giant bag)

The ad is targeting you specifically as they have identified your interest in WoW classic. Most likely from your YouTube watch history. Using the same logic, I doubt you will see a WoW Classic ad, as your already part of Blizzard's "converted" segment of people.
---
My warrior is 47 and ive tanked everything easily as arms.   If for no other reason than how good tactical mastery is.  Being able to quickly switch stance to zerker for a whirlwind or arms for a thunderclap goes a long way towards holding threat.  
---
I even found myself unable to hold threat before level 35 with a shield.  I just couldn't do enough threat and nothing hit hard enough to necessitate one unless it was a dungeon boss or bad pull.
---
You should use the fast scan option represented by the fast forward button.
---
If you are enjoying prot then by all means keep doing it. The whirlwind quest is pretty difficult to solo but would be a weapon to last you into the 40s.
---
As for shamans, they may have rockbiter on their weapon or be using earth shock. Both of these abilities generate additional threat just like heroic strike. They are on the class since one of the original ideas was to give shamans the ability to tank much like paladins.
---
Maybe consider a touch room farm in brd. Basically you kill the same mobs on repeat its super boring, you get no gold and all you do is shielding a hunter pet, however it's crazy fast exp for no effort.
---
Fiery Weapon would probably be decent
---
I love this idea, I think that linen bags is great and helping new players get situated is noble, may impact AH prices though :P

Would you keep a list of names to keep track of who's completed? Or would it be a quest you could do more than once?

I've mained healing classes (mostly Priest) since TBC, but tell me more about how I'm a "trash healer" and a "diva" because I don't want to spend more gold on water because the lifetap-spamming warlock doesn't want to drink or use food.
---
Well, it's exactly the same as sword spec, with less weapons to chose from, 5% less damage, and a very minor upside. It's totally doable - but the lack of weapon options is probably the most annoying thing. Hemo is another option where you can use any wep fine.

don't forget default titanpanel. VERY important to be able to see how much ammo you have on your paladin.

as /u/tubular1845 has said, it gave them a melee stun. In DAoC, similarly to WoW's Aimed Shot, archery had a cast (bow draw) time. And being hit by anything, even including non-damaging debuffs, would completely cancel casts. This made archers very vulnerable to assassins, which would make the assassin the scissors to the archer's paper.
---
Shield spec gave classes access to melee attacks with the shield, all of which had a stun attached, with the longest being 8s duration. What Scouts could do when attacked was switch to sword and board, Slam the attacking assassin and land a couple of heavy bow shots.
---
Coming to think of it, between Infiltrator's 2.5x spec points, Scouts and Minstrels... I *really* hated Albs :(
---
I would say unless you (and your group) vastly outgear the content you are doing then you should be prot at 60 if you have any intention to tank.
---
This sub is basically a stream advertise site now :D
---
But also, they should have been able to do it naked
---
&gt; tanks don't take that much damage
---
Depends on the trash and the dungeon. Lots of trash packs hit like trucks and I can't do the whole "sit and drink while tank pulls" thing because the tank gets chunked for half his health in 5 seconds.
---
You still shouldn't let your child watch these. Clearly people are put off by this, and gut feeling shouldn't be ignored.

700g to epic mount and you start AHing something that will likely take 3+ days to sell and you'll be well past epic mount by then
---
Some times you gotta no life it so you realize that there’s more to life than video games. And I don’t think no lifing it is bad. Sometimes you just gotta get it out of your system. At least you recognized that you need to step back a little. I have friends who maybe need to do the same, so don’t feel too bad and learn from the experience man! Don’t get down on yourself.
---
I am hoping to run into the same luck at some point!
---
I have been 100% grinding as a priest. Currently almost 27. I had 2 blues drop so far, the Gargoyles Bite polearm which doesn't seem to want to sell, and Magician's Mantle which I put on because there was a million of them on the AH.
---
I love when locks use their SS to try and get you after getting their ass kicked. It's truly funny.
---
It's. One. Month. In. They will have paid transfers later most likely. The whole point of them not is because they are trying to control where people go. You need to develop some patience lol
---
Night Elf is much better than Human. Massive trees and moonwells litter the landscape as well as ethereal wisps. You are on a distant, remote corner of Azeroth with no idea what Stormwind or Ironforge are. You start to hear murmers of the place called Ironforge but its a distant concern. You finally make it to Darnassus after learning a bit and they tell you you need to take the boat to Darkshore. You're probably level 15 at this point. In darkshore you get your first taste of swimming underwater missions and its likely you'll run into your first horde. If you're lucky, you'll get your first piece of honor for helping a higher level kill the horde. From here the landscapes start to slowly change as you trek through Felwood, Ashenvale, Stonetalon, and eventually you make it to the boat to Eastern Kingdoms.... but you're still days away from Ironforge as you step into Wetlands. Theres really no comparing to the mystique and grandeur of the NE experience.
---
There is no escape, your king needs you!
---
Haha I did a Gnomeregan run this week. We all just silently followed the tank because we didnt know where to go.
---
Turns out, he didnt either!
---
Why not picking up mining/engi on your rogue? It's easier and make everything simple.
---
Hot and Bothered
---
There is no wrong answer when you are literally BORED of playing, if you are even getting the slightest hint that you don't enjoy what you are doing, are you not going to change just cos it's not "optimal"?
---
Addon.  They added it to the game later on.
---
addon
---
Elwynn chat gets pretty depraved at night.
---
What you mind sharing which whelps you're talking off?
---
I'm already running through lots of my mana as it is to keep the tank alive as he gets smacked, having to heal a warlock spamming lifetap for the whole instance only drains my mana that much more and forces me to spend more gold on water because the warlock is too lazy to use water or food.
---
But no, tell me more about how I'm "inexperienced" despite playing since 2007.
---
I'm no expert but I think 30/21 is also a good healing spec for druids.  You get a huge chunk of int and solid feral abilities and a lot of essential healing skills.
---
Getting everywhere 6% faster isn't insignificant. People underestimate how much time you spend traveling.
---
Ah nice, now you are also calling people retarded on the internet too, wow you better watch out you don't slur those words in the real world once you try leaving your moms basement. Could get you into trouble
---
Oh you poor soul, level 30+ will not be kind to you
---
Ahh ok cool any suggestions for addon names that have this?
---
You sound awfully worked up and upset that someone was better than you at WoW and enjoys the game differently than you do.
---
Hope whatever shit is going on in your life gets better soon and you become a happier person.
---
Thanks! You know the name of it?
---
Ah ok. If you're 60 with normal fury spec yes, you definitely should be switching for OP, at least until you're full raid gear. I'd imagine BT/WW will take up most of your rage at low gear levels. Typically you just cleave or heroic strike excess, although I know horde have a hamstring spam to get WF procs as another option.
---
Tanks, as a warlock how can I make your life easier? If I am drawing threat I try to wand, or throw dots. I usually wait what I believe to be 2, maybe 3 gcd to let tank draw good threat before I throw immolate When I do draw threat I draw them towards the tank. I noticed this more when I got some shadoweave pieces and started focusing on my +spell damage and +shadow damage. I also only keep my imp out during dungeons for the Stam buff, but do not usually use a minion in dungeons. I know that these are all kinda basic, but are there any small things I am missing? and before its said, I come to all dungeons with enough shards for 1 soulstone on healer or player who can rez, and 6 healthstones (1 for everyone, 2 for me), and at least 2-3 extra in case we need to summon.
---
Fuck sorry, just through the list, I could have sworn it was in there, I must be thinking of the pet focus regen, my apologies.
---
You sure? I've found nothing. I also watched some vids and never saw a 19 or 21 energy tick.
---
But its rly hard to see on vanilla vids.
---
My favorite target in STV has been hunters as a rogue. I can see/avoid their traps, get them with crippling, pop free action potion in anticipation of any slows. The only “hiccup” in the fight is if they have scatter shot but I just use sprint after that.
---
It's just hysterical that you cry racism without giving a single example. What a whiney little bitch.
---
Absolutely. You may consider playing Druid because cat form is similar to a rogue but having a Druid in your duo greatly increases your utility— double rogue will be fine too but you may have a harder time finding dungeon groups vs leveling rogue/druid. Druids are more limited at end game to a few roles— for instance balance and cat form Druids are less than ideal for raiding. As a raiding Druid you can use a resto/feral spec that is very competent for both raid healing and battleground / flag carrier roles. At 60 rogue / Druid is an amazing duo for dungeons and wpvp. 
---
Bottom line though if you both want to skulk around together you can do that with both duos. Personally I’d go the R/D route but R/R can be fun if you don’t care about dungeons as much.
---
Okay so a lot of hate and judgement from this thread and it kinda wasn't the point to get trashed as a dad. Me and my daugther occasionally watch a video or two on Youtube. No biggie. This is usually not the type of video but shit like this autoqeues sometimes. I just want to make it clear that I don't "foster" my kid on this.
---
This is the exact same thing that happened for me yesterday in SM Cath... I was the mage... Rattlegore
---
i know BUT the thing is I NEED This to be perfect for phase 2. and what if they dont do server transfers before phase 2? I would be devastated.
---
What does it take do this at level 7 lol
---
I did alot of scarlet monastery till 40 and had about 65g.  borrowed 35g from a warlock friend. this doesn't answer your question though...
---
BUT I also have mining blacksmithing and saved a lot of my mining mats up till 40. you are going to spend A LOT on leveling your smithing and you should probably plan around that. I'm level 49 with 250 in both professions and I think i have about 3g right now. i guess I'm saying you should be aware of how expensive blacksmithing will be in the levels going forward and plan accordingly. it wont make you money for a while
---
It's whole reddit feature, called "flairs".  
---
Find "Show my flair on this subreddit. It looks like:" on this sub. Enable this checkbox and edit your flair.
---
Both mouse buttons? In an MMO you're supposed to move with the mouse and cast abilities with the keyboard, not the other way around
---
Does anyone have an add on recommendation for healers so we can actually see what we heal for? Not HPS or Meters, literal floating text with a number that implies how much was healed, or hell- even a number that pops up on their face/nameplate would be nice. I’ve scoured forums and posts but can’t seem to find an answer.
---
I am a paladin short and shout
---
Here is my hammer and here is my mount
---
And when I'm attacked I'll scream and shout
---
Then pop my bubble and hearthstone out
---
Twas a great night! &lt;3
---
many whelps
---
Easy for me.
---
Haha I love joking about child abuse too
---
Can't tell if you are being sarcastic. Why bother playing the game at all?
---
Hmm....I didn't know that.
---
All good, thx for re-checking! 
---
May you want to edit your first post because a lot of people wont read that far :)
---
How did he/she have all their items in one bag?
---
http://shieldhearth.ytmnd.com/
---
Flying, worst mistake.
---
I am 60 prebis rogue on kirtonos though. I havent camped u cuz I dont kill greys haha but its lame I want to be on the underdog side.
---
As far as I'm concerned, there are two correct ways healing loot can be dealt with:
---
1. The healer of the group gets priority on any healing gear then need. If the healer doesn't need an item, then others can go for it.
---
2. If a player intends to roll against the group healer on healing gear, then they absolutely **must** declare this the moment the group is formed. If the healer agrees, then fine, but if an agreement can't be reached, then one or more people need to find a group where this won't be an issue.
---
Personally I'm a healer who believes that the healer of the group should always get priority on healing gear, if they need the item. Sure a non-healer in the group can declare their intentions and an agreement be reached, but it's a shitty deal for the healer, who will have their chances of gearing slashed by at least 50% with nothing of compensation in return. Meanwhile, the non-healer will probably be rolling on tank/dps gear, so are effectively doubling their chance to gear.
---
So what should non-healers do? Imo if they're serious about healing (especially at 60), they should show they're serious about it, and full commit to being a healer, i.e. respec, and acquire easily obtainable healing pieces via quests or the AH. Classic is all about commitment, not trying to have your cake and eat it while screwing over people who actually committed to a role. If they can't commit to healing, then they should go play retail where flip-flopping between roles is perfectly acceptable.
---
I’m just curious, why are everyone flaming new streamers/youtubers for their advertising?
---
I have found lvl 1 fear to be most reliable at keeping mobs inside spawn range.  Any more and they run,  phase out and evade.  I'm blaming layers
---
Single, buddy. I have too much fun banging whores like your daughter
---
It might be a little tedious since neither of you will have a healing ability. If you can I recommend Rogue/Druid combo for the clutch heals. They basically become Rogues at 20 anyways.
---
My son...
---
More like AsmonMOLD LMAO
---
Is there any addon for the gun sounds? Got a better gun than bow for cheap so decided to buy it, but by god the gunshots are so annoyingly loud
---
Yea it feels like not serious rp you can just... ah shit my lsd is kicking in
---
Cry a little more and my classic forum experience will be complete
---
LOL
---
No reason to not use it anytime you can, if you dont have to heal you should always wand
---
Best solo class by far,  fastsest (shared with mage) lvling, clothie killers in pvp, you just cant have all. its only normal that your in middle of dmg charts, althou my friend who mained hunter in vanilla and was in semi hardcore guild always was in top 5
---
Issue is having a singular shadow priest in a raid is beneficial as it boosts your warlocks damage. They’re only a meme spec insofar as you only want one and they’re only there to buff others.
---
I think the only two ways are ashenvale -&gt; stonetalon -&gt; top of 1k needles -&gt; gadget, or ashenvale -&gt; ratchet -&gt; (possibly theramore) 
---
 -&gt; gadget
---
Were elementals very contested? Leveling my second character to 60 and would like to try them but it seems like there’s a big lump of people in the 30-40 range
---
Ogre Arcana right there
---
At least Lifestealer can do this still lol
---
Communicate more with your party and complain less on reddit
---
I saw that ama and Blizzard appeared to be avoiding the question. They said that they wouldn't implement a system to trade gold between games, but thats entirely different from players agreeing to trade classic for retail gold among themselves.
---
Every time, but you need to remember that it really dependent on amount of people buffed.  
---
If you charge in and shout - only you will get a buff, so you get minimal threat. But if you do it near party - all 5 players will get buff, so you generate x5 more threat.
---
Enjoy the mage bro. thats how i fell in love with game. by playing mage
---
I'm l leveling a warrior as well.  It's a very fun complex class.  You are the best tank and the top dps class in the game.  With a healer you can destroy packs of mobs with whirlwind and sweeping strikes.  You can taunt, intercept, charge and interrupt.
---
But solo they are fragile and you need a solid stack of food to eat.  Having a foot updated weapon is essential.  If you are getting behind run some dungeons for a good blue weapon.   Learn to tank as well as that is how you will spend most of your time in dungeons.
---
For professions engineering is good for bombs and toys.  But I find alchemy essential as I can make health potions, something I use constantly.
---
Mainly just 'something to do' during 5mans/raids but it doesn't really contribute a whole lot.
---
Half the hunters I see don't even name their pets
---
Free mount hype!
---
Man I love this shit so much more than silence for literally the whole run of a 10min dungeon.  
---
Sure, there's some bad apples. But complaining together leads to friendship.
---
no, bloodrage is big threat on the whole pack.
---
Yeah if you like wasting hours of your life doing the same thing every time there's an update for absolutely no reason
---
Would you say the server has a good chance of surviving long term?
---
to train all 4 pet is on pair, if not more gold than the mount at 40. 
---
(unless you know youll never use succu and felhunter until bgs so dont even do their quests)
---
Ah I guess thats the reason then.. personally, twinks never interested me.
---
Spy addon will show enemy players nearby and allows u target them
---
Haha God damn, unexpected and hilarious
---
similar thing happened to me which inspired this.  greeded on that plate shoulder item that gives +defense and everyone else rolled need (no warrior or pala in group)
---
ähm it sucks that im the one who have to tell you this , but...
---
its not the bug which let you like a monster
---
Sunder &gt; HS 99% of the time when leveling
---
It builds slowly but at the end it becomes deeper and better than the first one.
---
Where did you grind mobs? Mainly 30, 35 etc. Looking to start!
---
Troll have a passif buff for health regen that others do not have, that's all.
---
can you share your /played time getting to 40? for reference mine was 5 days bein casual and a bit of afk time.
---
There is alot of greedy people lol
---
Its only as good as the data it has and the settings you tell it to use. I have found you need to dig in a little to make sure it is acting in a way you expect/want. For example sometimes it won't undercut the lowest listing if it thinks that listing is below market price. The thought being those low ones will sell and then the price will get back to what it should be, for items that don't sell quickly or at a high volume that not be what you want.
---
So does eating without a table
---
Via its mostly true is why.. Duh
---
Odd group whelps. Located on left side. Many.
---
I think you really need a group of friends or a friendly guild to make it fun for a first time player
---
Grats on the tame, i had a mage in lbrs say if i needed on any cloth he would farm BT for 5 days lol
---
Blizzard and apple both have tech support lol— have you tried reinstalling the game? Have you tried turning it off / on? Do you have a toaster lying around? Classic will play on a toaster.
---
Yes. Enhance is very reliant on WF procs. Feels great or feels like you may  as well spec rockbiter.
---
Wow thanks!
---
The only way to be totally unbiased about something is to be completely ignorant of the subject. Once you have information you are biased by either accepting or rejecting it. Yes, he is coming from the perspective of an Ally player in the minority. Just because people have  a perspective doesn't mean they are wrong.
---
If you want to show that someone is making a mistake you actually have to address their ideas. Attacking them personally instead is what people do when they don't want to admit they are wrong.
---
This is my engineering teleport to tanaris 30% of the tome.
---
Basically what OzRikT said. I used to be playing mostly on private tbc pvp servers and dueling a lot. Anything outside your spell toolkit was considered as a cheating. When I entered the vanilla pvp servers, oh man, so many cheaters everywhere. It took me a while to acclimate and accept that consumables are just part of vanilla pvp.
---
just saying i spent so much time on it i dont wanan reroll...
---
Correct
---
I 100% feel that but as a lowly lvl 30 I’m a mile away ,
---
Wasting rage for no damage on mobs that will die before you can stack it up seems a bit pointless tbh.
---
Really enjoyed your dungeons guides! Thanks for the work.
---
queshs wazhztst
---
That's... Nearly impossible.. Unless you were already very, very, \*very\* hurt already
---
My fav moment was when a gnome mage was getting ganked in front of BRS  and when he blinked out of cheap shot he blinked right on top of me, an undead rogue (of course), to get cheap shotted and killed :D
---
Warriors are mostly notorious for being slower on average than other classes and being very gear-dependant. If you can make it quicker than average, then good on ya. I'm playing druid this go-round and it's so easy to pop out of form and heal and just keep grinding indefinitely
---
The three LFGs I see most tend to be for SM, ZF, and Ulda, if that says anything about Blaumeux.
---
I haven't attacked anyone as a paladin so far, mainly because I don't want to spend a minute fighting, only auto-attacking. But I've been ganked by a mage (who didn't know BoF made me immune to slows) and 2 (shitty) rogues at the same time. I've died, but still killed the mage, so at least you're partly right.
---
Let's take the Menethil Tavern they said. It'll be easy they said.
---
Saw this same ad on day one of classic. Lol
---
Of all videos I saw it on the wow classic ad that blizzard made.
---
They must be there for the kill and in the same group
---
I'm playing on an i3-4005u which is terrible so you should be fine.  Don't know if you're missing drivers for the integrated GPU.  Maybe look around for drivers and try again.
---
That’s a fun pet! I’m running around with my trusty Senegal that I always ran around with in vanilla :)
---
apply on offhand, but nothing on main hand to benefit from Windfurry
---
This is reddit and WoW if you came for a place where everyone is going to be civil this is the wrong place
---
Yeah. Pet attack on its own is better than binding it to an ability. Its fine for farming/leveling though. I use both
---
He says as replying a day later. See if you can follow me on this although I know it will be hard for someone with no friends to understand. But when someone makes a jab at you you return in kind and you continue bantering. But then you have some idiot on the spectrum, that's your cue, show up and have a problem with it.
---
intimidating shout on the pet absolutely wrecks hunters. the hunter just slowly walks away from you for 8 seconds while you pound them. 90% of them have no idea what is going on.
---
Missing taunt macros.
---
i think in most cases you can ask to need and explain you’re trying to respec and most groups will be cool. people generally get mad when you need stuff clearly not for your spec with no explanation
---
Go to Heartseeker. Its seen a MASSIVE influx of players over the past day, let alone week. Also, it's great alliance-wise.
---
I also had 0 xp coming into wow classic and opted to play warrior . Lvl 38 right now. It’s definitely been a hard road thus far. But it’s been immensely rewarding . It truly feels like an accomplishment whenever I hit the next level. 
---
The two big lessons I’ve learnt so far:
---
- Food and bandages are key 
---
- pulling more than one mob is usually a mistake 😄
---
Embrace the grind 🤘
---
Bonus tip: listening to Disturb’s Indestructible album makes you crit harder
---
And it's about time to rewatch the vid about Chinese alternative WoW client - https://youtu.be/aycxWsFMD_o
---
If people want to be first and get a main and alt to 60 in a month, what's wrong with that? How is that any less "doing your thing" than someone like you who's only 28 a month in? I'm so over seeing these holier-than-thou "take it slow" bullshit posts. 
---
I have three characters in the mid 20s with a very full life outside of wow. And I'm definitely not speed leveling; I'm doing every quest, slow or not. I guess that means I'm enjoying the game better than you are.
---
Classic is hard btw
---
Need tanks more than anything
---
Dual-wield tanking is great for threat but difficult to heal
---
Silly question I haven't been able to figure out: is there a setting to show enemies HP and MP numerically on their bars? Or do I need an Add-on?
---
if there is a setting, where is it? Thanks!
---
Thank you, I had been trying to figure out how to do that
---
feel free to add suggestions, maybe we can make the next bingo card double the size
---
Thank you! I'm glad you enjoy them :D
---
from first to 30 its definatly easy. 30-36 gets iffy but then starts to pick up again.
---
Okay, that makes sense about the market price theory, thank you
---
Ahh.. good the good ol' barrens chat..
---
Every time I do a dungeon it feels like we are always looking for tanks.
---
So the gnome just drowned basically ?
---
A lot of us don't want one-size-fits-all solutions and want our UI to look _completely different_ than these options such as TukUI. Personally I hate the look of TukUI, but that's just me, if it works for you that's totally fine.
---
mages have a 99% win rate against warriors.
---
That's the Feathermoon boat isn't it? It's faster to swim across even if the boat is already docked, assuming you're going from the mainland to the island. If the boat is just leaving, taking it is roughly as fast as swimming.
---
Going from the island to the main land you should prefer the boat if it's docked, but don't wait for it if it isn't.
---
As far as I know Kromcrush is not one of the servers that is available to transfer out of. Arcanite Reaper I know for sure you can only transfer to from Whitemane.
---
If everyone needs, it can’t be ninja’d. It’s good to disclose this at the beginning of the run.
---
Thanks for the advice. When doing a dungeon do you prefer an active pet that can be controlled (I have worked very hard at pet control, so I am confident I can keep my minion in check) or a phase shifted imp that does little to nothing but buffs stam (currently mine buffs +26 stam) and can cast a 2 min fire shield?  
---
I have personally went with the Imp so I can focus more on the fight and the stam buff is really nice, but I feel like my minions could be doing a little more work.
---
Melee leeway!!! It’s a great feature for people who have crap internet.
---
Go away. Christ.
---
Can you make the entire board "dual wield fury tank" and "complains when taking enough damage to die in 2 seconds, but is dual wield fury tank"?
---
u/stathiszont69 let's see now who is going to do the chores around the house 😂
---
Lol you should delete this it’s incriminating as fuck.
---
Its literally about mana efficiency.
---
If you aren't healing or drinking, what exactly are you doing?
---
What's the name of this ui? Want to download it too
---
use common sense, you don't need someone else to do it for you.
---
as a healer, you will be blamed for their fuckups and if you can't handle that, then don't do shit with random players who are too fucking stupid to wipe their own asses.
---
it's the reason nobody wants to heal/tank in randoms in MMORPGs anymore. today's games have convinced idiot fucking players that they're not idiots at all. i mean, why else would they get phat loot?
---
I’m pretty good as a hunter my only fuckups have been tab targeting, targeting a mob across the dungeon instead of the pack 5 feet in front and me realizing to late.
---
FUCK!
---
Absolutely. A bad run makes a rant to my Guilford.
---
A dead silent run makes me want to stop playing and go play an actual multiplayer game.
---
How would it be unfair? Everyone has the same chance to play the less popular faction so encouraging players to do so by prioritizing them in the queue seems like a good way to help balance the factions.  
---
Of course, that assumes faction balance is important to pvp servers. I don't see anyone arguing against that assumption.
---
Tanks are hard to find but finding dungeon group in general is very easy still
---
i was just expressing concern lol. have a good day
---
Man imagine if someone came along and killed Mr. Kitty during the taming process after he ditched his trustee bear lol.
---
proud of the horde bois, yesterday we MCed around 3 people off the ship when it was furthest out to sea at Menethil and ganked the rest, then after the load screen, we ganked em again.
---
- source: undead rogue
---
Just wait till he finds out about tuskless trolls.
---
if the warrior is 30 and it's the ww axe, consider it a legendary weapon.
---
Add-ons can no longer /who -- only manually typed ones. Breaks several add-ons like the Census add-ons and WowIM.
---
My BT remains unnamed because I can't think of anything clever that lets people know that it's actually BT.
---
I have 12 art pieces done by students and placed on their portfolio, but they were all paid for them. Any sort of professional internship is generally paid too, just at a much lower rate than what a journeyman is
---
Wait really?
---
Poisons aren't on ppm yet, unless that has changed with Classic.
---
Can i get a list of spots? Im mage. Lvl 24. New to wow. At a point where i keep using gold for bullshit that i cant even get my skills.
---
I wish we had shattering throw in this game
---
It was the biggest fuck you to paladins and I loved it
---
You can't always count on other people to pay attention to your mana so you just have to tell them when you need to drink. If they dont listen and pull anyway just do what you can with the mana you do have and if they die, they die.
---
Why is that?   Are you one of the cancer cells within the tumor known as Barrens chat?
---
Thank you for this response!
---
I rolled back and then updated my display drivers but the problem persists. When you say "look around" is there an alternate source for drivers I should check?
---
Again, you're strawmanning me.
---
This isn't about "mana efficiency", it's about the warlock draining my mana even more because he doesn't want to use water/food and instead spends the entire instance spamming lifetap.
---
Any time there's a warlock in group, I drink nearly twice as much as usual because I'm not just having to cast more heals, but I'm having to cast more often which leads to less mana regen.
---
This line right here: "As you can clearly see, healing heals for more health than it costs in mana - point for point."
---
shows me that you're not a healer and are just looking at raw numbers to try and determine some kind of conclusion here. Like, yeah, no shit the healing spell heals for more healing than the mana cost, but having to cast that heal uses more of my mana and reduces my regen time leading to even less mana. All because the warlock refuses to use water/food.
---
I'm drinking more so that the warlock doesn't have to drink. And that's obnoxious.
---
What about outside dungeons and raids?
---
Thanks for the clarification!
---
Them's fightin' words around here.
---
Are you on a low pop server? On a high pop server, there's going to be 4-5 layers, so if anyone on your faction invites you there's basically a 80% chance it will layer you. If the first one doesn't the next one will usually.
---
Ok, so that grind is super real. I can't lie. I have had amazing success in Desolace and Swamp of Sorrow. They are not super populated zones, and have quite a bit of mobs and quests that can be done. I also did stuff in STV, and Arathi. Mix that in with some SM runs and you  will be gold. I am on bigglesworth so if you need a hand dm and we will make it happen.
---
You're supposed to pull - ice block with a shield up. Wait the full time for them all to gather close. Nova and kite with blizzard and cone. The point of frost is to not let them touch you. Problem with deadmines is its too cramped. Might be better off in shadowfang keep
---
In a group I completely agree. I will always give food or water to party members without wanting/expecting a tip. If someone whispers me while I'm questing or walking through a city though, I would consider it pretty rude if they didn't toss 5s my way. I don't ask for it, but it just feels like a courtesy thing.
---
In a group though? You know damn well I'm entering that dungeon with 300 water pre-made and handing it out like spam mail.
---
What add-on shows the HP of enemy?
---
As a paladin building a healing set (level 46) I'm looking for a weighted numbers for healing stats. I understand that +healing &gt; int &gt; spirit but am looking for numeric values.
---
For example: +healing = 2; intellect = 1.5; spirit = .75
---
Likewise are there stat weights for Ret?
---
Attack Power, Strenght, Agility, +Crit Chance, +Hit Chance.
---
Edit: Added stat weight request for Ret.
---
Good point.  Well if I'm not hopping continents them TB is nice lol
---
I had a group ask me to travel from barrens to BFD, which took me pretty long because I kept getting killed by either too high lvl mobs or ganking alliance. 
---
When I finally get there, they ask me to summon all of them. When I then told the party leader I need 2 ppl for the summon to work, he kicked me because 'I was too low lvl'. Bitch you asked me.
---
Gonna start copying this
---
Super lame but they did say they don’t want addons automating things.
---
It's from darkest dungeon and it's an amazing game.
---
Me, mostly because I've joined a guild of casual players of same age(30+) that know the game very well.
---
Nah Oceanic servers. But people keep posting their mohawked, jawless undead warriors so you probably got one of us :P
---
I feel like it is that's why I wasn't sure. If you're already looking for a group im going to assume you are "good to go" lol
---
Give the dps a free pass or two then tell them that of they're going to keep grabbing aggro you're not going to heal them. Same thing when you're drinking, let them know after the first or second time, then just sit there and finish your drink.
---
With the drink issue try to type oom in chat or something because a lot of the times the tank just isnt paying attention. 
---
For the dps make sure your tank is marking a skull to kill first so everyone knows who to attack first.
---
A spell cleave group will consist of 3 mages, 1 healer, and 1 puller, as warlock you will be the puller, you will use eye and aggro everything and pull them into a choke point where the mages will aoe then down, as warlock you will be using hellfire and rain of fire to help with the dps.
---
The Tauren did it to themselves by aligning with the Horde right?
---
Thats it!!!
---
Layer was not a bad decision lol if you don't understand why it's not a bad decision then Idk what to tell you
---
Yeah, I think it's one of the best default interfaces of the mmo genre.
---
Never be the first one to roll on boe, with random group every1 should need UNLESS Theres a person in group who really needs it.
---
got a &lt;Wikifeet Admins&gt; on my server
---
I just like it because its the last mmo i really enjoyed. I just dont have the time to grind that much as i did when wow released. And this time i wanna be able to clear end game
---
No, no, no! All DPS need to be top DPS, otherwise kick. Tank needs to have 100% of the damage taken, otherwise kick. Tank's health ever going below 99%? Kick the healer. Fight taking longer than 10 seconds? Kick everyone.
---
Talk to people and set the rules. If they're going too fast and you keep running out of mana then tell them. If they're toxic you can always leave and find another group - very easy to find a new group as a healer
---
Ice Block is a 5 min cooldown, you can't use it for every couple of packs inside a dungeon
---
Just Intel's site.

Personally I think Warrior is easier post level 30 as sweeping strikes lets you handle more difficult engagements. The whole warriors hard to level thing isn't accurate. If you're hamstring kiting with a slow 2h, on -4 to same level quests and mobs, it's probably one of the faster classes. It just sucks on +2 mobs as it has no heal, disengage, or other ability that can recover from bad RNG. Stick to quests and mobs you're a higher level than and warrior smashes through it. Buy a few cheap greens off the AH as needed, weapon damage range is the only thing that's important. Hamstring kite back and forth, spam sunder and overpower, sweeping strikes as needed.
---
Probably uses ESDF for movement. Feels weird but you probably get used to it.
---
Combat sword rogue here. I think I'll be fine without dagger specific skills.
---
Just push through, you’ll be 60 in no time and then you’ll be 69 in no time
---
So I'm fresh to WoW classic just started yesterday and I'm confused on how I'm supposed to be playing priest at this point. I'm level 10 and I planned to do holy priest but I've heard I should do shadow priest until high enough level where I can respec to holy? Is this true and will I still be able to heal with groups in dungeons? Any advice is appreciated.
---
All solid to know^! . Kromcrush ty man and enjoy the pony
---
Followup. Are you using domino's? I like your side bar and I'd love something like that.
---
hahahaha the tabard looks like the mouth of cookie monster, while the eyes are made out of ...
---
Is there an addon for finding a group for dungeons? That'd be handy.
---
I installed it before launch and it works excellent, manual is always best though can't speak for twitch app.
---
Enchants are nice, but I wouldn't spend the gold unless you already have your mount money and you expect the item to last you \~10 levels.
---
Fiery (expensive) or +damage (I think for 1handers, +3 is the medium price one) for your weapons, +stamina or hp for everything else, IMO.
---
probably bagnon.
---
He intercepts. Mage Blinks and Warrior starts running opposite direction of where the Mage just Blinked to, to get out of combat. You can now, probably, get a free charge off.
---
Yes.  
---
It was a rarely camped spawn when I was that level, not sure about now.
---
Yeah teachers are paid by their students, and can still be morons who treat their students like crap.  Crazy world.
---
Be a druid.
---
Then you can tank, heal or be dps.
---
I was referring more to solo content.
---
Dunno. For some reason it's just really relaxing and calm zone for me.
---
BiS for fury warriors until AQ.
---
I find it depends on the mob. DW mobs Imp Ret aura is actually alot of damage. Caster mobs I 100% use Sanc as they dont meele you etc. 2h mobs or or 1h mobs usually Sanc if its higher level sometimes I use Ret since I miss more etc and the constant damage from ret aura is nice.
---
**VOLUME WARNING**
---
you don't have to grind to buy a mount lol
---
nah
---
Like WC
---
I guess we'll never know if it was a good decision or a bad decision. There are lots of ways to handle dense regions and we'll never have a classic launch again.
---
Have you tried the looking for group channels? My server at least there is tons of groups for end game.
---
I wanna see all content but dont have the time to grind all the gold for pots and enchants. I missed out on aq40 and naxx back in vanilla. This time i wanna clear it. Ill lvl to 60 and purchase the gold i need for pots and enchants. So when i log in i can clear content. Not to grind, i have enough money but i dont have enough time. So for me its logic to buy gold instead of grinding. Im sure more players share my thoughts.
---
Playing PoE on laggy/DC heavy leagues teaches one good thing..
---
KEEP YOUR BAGS CLEAN AND LOOT THE FUCKING ITEM. Don't show off until you are in possession of it
---
wait til you get to 60 and everyone rolls need on greens to deter ninjas.
---
Leatrix now has a Extended QuestLog if you're using it
---
Gratz
---
r/WoW is definitely the worst sub I've experienced.  This one isn't too bad except for the overflow from that sub.
---
Tank here and if a DPS consistently gets aggro I usually tell him to chill out and let me get aggro, if they keep going I just stop taking the mobs off them. At that point I might whisper the healer to tell them to not waste healing on them. Just communicate with your tank and the DPS will eventually follow you.
---
The guy is level 11 with a boar that has no focus dump. Even if he had a cat it would be like 10 extra damage a fight best case scenario. He is clearly a new player, i dont think its unreasonable to auto cast growl.
---
why did you post this 3 times?
---
Indeed. Minority of people are capable of leading and many who can still don't want to take the stress and pressure of having to lead, take responsibility for wipes, bad pulls etc.
---
Mulgore Alphawolves have no teeth! How did they become alphas? And why are there so many of them? What kind of alpha wolves are those?
---
Anyone else excited that the content was actually tuned for 20 people the whole time and we were just bad back in the day?
---
Ily too
---
Sadly it’ll never sell for what it’s worth these days.
---
Just tell them you're holy and heal as shadow.. the content is easy, you'll get by.
---
Filthy human
---
Amazing feat!  What was your group composition?  Number of healers?
---
For the action bars I'm using Bartender.
---
It's easy to set up and good for customization. Definitely give it a try.
---
You can also choose from different pre-defined presets (about 3 or 4) and build on top of that.
---
Be the chaos you wish to see in the world.
---
He SHOULD have brought his own water.
---
Same as retail really, jump queues as tank or healer, tanks slightly faster than healers
---
Lol no not even close.
---
It's so bad sometimes I just tank as Enh.
---
What's the addon that shows your buss on the left of your screen?
---
Well i actually do, cause i enjoy making my character looking cool by buying twink items while leveling to make myself stronger. Ill never be able to have time to enjoy the game the way i like to.
---
I wouldn’t say no one needs food in duns. As a warlock when a mage offers me water I would just say give me food instead. Since I am lifetapping I don’t have mana issues and yes I can get healed by healer or drain life, but sometimes just about everybody needs to break for mana. So when everyone around me is sitting eating and drinking, I may as well too, and since I usually don’t need mana, I’ll eat some food
---
I think you agreed with me on accident.
---
They got rid of that feature. Used to be able to summon/unsummon the lil dude and if you did it enough times you’d fill out all your debuff slots pushing the undesired debuff off
---
It was the last time I looked, and also I thought they opened up transfers to any of the newer servers?
---
Lol, fuck you. I hope you get perma banned.
---
Just open trade with me, I chose a mage on purpose and always have stacks ready to throw into a trade. It’s no hassle, and makes me happy to help. I don’t get why everyone is so huffy. 20 minutes conjuring? Are you making a billion waters??
---
Wow, a Pickup Group group
---
yo same here on Kirt too... lvl 60 and stuff. I am rerolling same class on faerlina though... level it slowly i guess and gank on kirtonos in the mean time.
---
Sell it to a vendor, see if you can get the Uber Demon to spawn.
---
Yeah, could be worse.
---
Enjoy the view while you eventually get unstuck.
---
That was not expected and thoroughly appreciated. Take your upvote.
---
Just a PSA: If your pet goes to make new friends on their own or you forget to dismiss the pet after a jump there's still a possibility of saving the day. Instead of calling the pet back with his friends command it to attack and stay there. Once the pet dies pray to gods and feign death. If nobody else made aoe threat like heal they should just reset.
---
I haven't done the quest yet, planning on doing it after I get travel form at least... maybe mount. I think it's mostly that you have to travel to a bunch of places.
---
I hang out with a lot of actual artists in the /r/characterdrawing discords and the like.
---
When they found out I'd hit the front page for the third time in a weekend and didn't have any way to get clients from that they sounded like they were going to crawl through the server and throttle me :P
---
Just like all those npcs in BFA.
---
Make a macro to recall ur pet and keybind that macro. As a warlock I use that macro all of the time and have yet to pull anything.
---
When I afk in booty bay I shadowmeld on the captain guy. Can’t see me until you’re right there and unless they’re paying close attention they’ll probably rmb me
---
Only time I've died to a paladin is when they bubble and AA me to death or use lay on hands after getting them super low. Cheap bastards.
---
-Signed, Me, a Warrior.
---
Seriously I almost killed one a whole 9 levels up from me (41 v 50) while they were stealing my damn Shellfish cages but every time they either had bubble, lay on hands, or a low level friend suddenly intervene when I had them in execute range or even in single digit %. Disappointingly nobody else seemed bothered  to help, even though it would have meant less competition for Shellfish which Alliance can't even use for anything anyway and only a bit more damage would kill them.
---
Except for a lv50 shaman who sprinted across Desolace to drop a bug zapper in the water to finally kill the paladin for the benefit of all of us doing the Shellfish farm. Thanks bud!
---
lol you don't use mouseover macros huh
---
target the bad guy, mouseover heal everyone else, dps when you can
---
I've heard from many very experienced players that switching accounts to talk to someone who has ignored you will 100% result in a ban if reported.
---
Absolute unit
---
Doesn't work like that,  servers would crash constantly in every other zone. AND having individual zones having their own layers would cause a lot of issues with zone lines.
---
Got another idea?
---
Lille 70% of warrior are all fury dps wannabe's
---
Chased a dwarf priest who was terrorizing horde out into the ocean I sheeped him really deep under water he drowned to death.
---
I did that back on Nostalrius with a guild focused on world pvp. It was super fun, we were ~12 ppl. It ended with a lvl 10 Dwarf came into the starting zone and the battle reminded me of a raid encounter.
---
It isn't really a raid spec, but some guilds may like hemorrhage as a debuff. It depends on whether you can find a guild that would want that. You almost always open with ambush UNLESS you're fighting mobs with a high armor stat (you'll know because they're wearing plate armor or a shield), in this instance you open with garrote and pop your bleeds as they have a higher damage output on heavily armored targets. The only exception is if they're much lower level than you, or if you're decked in gear.
---
I've been asked to make more videos on it, and I may do so in the future if people are genuinely interested :)
---
Jesus Christ, the total annihilation! That was nutty, especially considering it took you so long to kill the earth elemental xd
---
So I started an alt human warlock, which I’ve actually been enjoying more than my main. however I’m beyond confused with the talent tree and how to spec for best Dps does anybody know of any good guides or have any tips ??
---
I do prefer that
---
Always have a couple full stacks of water, although normally a mage will be there. Drink the second you get out of combat, don't let anyone die.   
---
If people get aggro so much, or pull so quickly that they die - that's on them. If they die from a healer not paying attention or using inefficient heals or insisting on sitting to get 85% -&gt; 100% mana then that's on the healer.
---
Sorry, man but how can layering only be partly to blame for this? If Layering wasn't a thing, this 100% wouldn't have happened?
---
Personally I'm always more puzzled by the animals without any blood.
---
I grinded the wolves on the Alliance island. I am a horde on A high pop server and had no issues. Only people I saw were some shaman actually I assume in a totem quest.
---
Heh. So much for Authentic Vanilla :tm:
---
Nada sadly.  Classic is after the patch where they disallowed it to proc off of itself.  Well sadly for me, not dirty alliance!
---
Skullflower has a great minimalist skin for ElvUI as wel
---
Just pull ~~less~~ fewer mobs...
---
" better than you at WoW " -&gt; you mean more time to spend in wow
---
seeing peasants doing peasant things have nothing to do with happiness, i couldnt ask for more in my life
---
Also couriers and their guards like that will de spawn/respawn when they get to their destination
---
Grinding to 40? Fucking mag-
---
Oh it's a rogue?
---
If you are struggling I would suggest pulling smaller packs and remembering to LoS the casters you may not be able to pull the entire dungeon at once but you will still get fair fast times as 1 blizzard should realistically be enough to get them all down. Assuming you did a little bit of AoE grinding while leveling its pretty much the same strategy as far as the pulling and kiting goes
---
That's the reason why I don't play my rogue anymore.
---
I felt like shit because you can‘t get any meat in teldrassil and owls want meat. Took the boat to wetlands just to buy some stuff for my good boy. Felt a dog owner
---
&gt; Doesn't work like that, servers would crash constantly in every other zone. AND having individual zones having their own layers would cause a lot of issues with zone lines.
---
Half the player base isn't even past 30 yet. Zone lines are still intact and cause issues. During the DDOS'ing you would fail to instance travel properly on flight points. Almost like you're just guessing how the tech works.
---
Let
---
Them
---
Die
---
Maybe I should start charging dps for every time I have to taunt...
---
World drops are basicly items that drop from all sorts of enemies in the world. (So not counting dungeons and raids)
---
You recognize them as usually they are "Bind on Equip" meaning that u can trade or well them.
---
Greens are pretty common like "axe of the bear" And are usually just traded/disenchanted.
---
Blue quality items are more rare
---
But it's them purples that make you happy and highly likely rich by selling it.
---
...or strong by equipping it.
---
Would have been cool to see!! Still...awesome
---
Yeah you are right actually, I will edit.
---
It’s about the new player experience. If the starting zones flagged you automatically, most people would quit the game before level 10. When you’re level 22 and someone is camping ashenvale, you can just go to redridge instead. It’s a lot more daunting for an UD to go do starter quests in durotar because some asshole wants to camp tirisfal glades, especially if they’re a new player who hasn’t been introduced to zeppelins. 
---
The game needs safe zones. Namely in starter areas, where they mostly exist.
---
I think it only shows stuff that you've scanned previously. But if you post the item and press "Refresh" it will do a mini search of that item and show you a current list.
---
Use willitclassic to get most recent version - it may not be that exact add on but there are ones that are definitely working. 
---
Download questlogex for quest log addon. Such a simple change just making it bigger but probably one of my favorite addons I have installed.
---
"I hope your adventures are half as epic as your loots"
---
... *looks at green helmet*
---
Fuck man, kick me while I'm down why don't you.
---
can someone tell me what the name of the addon is for his action bar set up?
---
You can’t enslave another warlocks demon.  I don’t have an answer to your first question.
---
Yeah the LFG was such a hassle there, I swapped servers and it was A LOT better, along with some pretty serious issues with AH being underused
---
The population difference affects a LOT more than just PVP servers, unlike what a few other people said
---
I actually swapped to Grob! Much better.
---
There was an alch warlock I would run into a few times during questing. After the first time he asked for water, I'd automatically prepare some for him and he'd trade me a few useful potions in return. 
---
One of the reasons I went from MMO hater to falling in love with WoW.
---
One Blizzard doesn't kill them, need at least two
---
Spent all that time on a logo to export to jpg instead of png.
---
Hm, perhaps try a melee class like Rogue. Always welcome dps in raids, obvious advantages in WPvP. 
---
Pretty much every class has a basic leveling rotation, even as Rogue you’ll be spamming like 3 buttons most of the time, but melee is a different perspective at least
---
Because buying gold is against the TOS and thus banable?? Enjoy the ban after you've dished out 60 shekels omegalul.
---
would you be able to go more in detail on what the earth totem is and why i need to keep it? does it have to be in my inventory or can i keep in bank?
---
Not out yet.
---
Ive been playing priest healer for quite some time, and i see those things as an extra challenge in a dungeon. I usually pay mages to make me 80 water before i go to instances. 
---
 I just drink after each fight even if my mana is at 80% and keep drinking while they start a new fight untill the tank is at 30% health and then i start healing again. while in combat reserve some of your mana for the tank, If an dps keeps taking aggro just let him die.
---
In the time i have been playing classic i also noticed that nobody is using CC in any form, but just tank and spank full groups, wich is extra draining on the healer. A simple sap or polymorph makes fights so much easier and makes the overal progress in a dungeon much faster because the healer doesnt have to heal the initial bursts of damage from a pack of mobs wich makes a healer get out of mana fast. And allows for more mana regen wich means less drinking.
---
ya I use ESDF
---
Layering won't be removed or, if it is, it'll be because of forcible server fractioning. In any case, yes, shitshow.
---
I play an undead rogue and try to be as friendly as possible but it doesn't seem to go well most of the time
---
Buddy of mine and I took the transfer to Heartseeker. Actually been great so far and I was very skeptical. Zones are very ally populated and huge influxes of 60’s as a bunch of guilds transferred from Staalag. Quested for like an hour and a half in badlands with no ganks which was impossible unless you’re playing at 3 am on Kirt. Economy seems more accurate atm than Kirt too.
---
So... Not really worth it? I'm not even level 60 yet and 10g comes and goes like 10s used to.
---
I always have a felhunter or succy out. Stopped using the VW at around 30 the other 2 are just too good.
---
You need to keep the totem of each element in your bags in order to use totems of that kind. Yeah.. It's kinda stupid but that's vanilla.
---
what happened?
---
I did that place on my first ever character on vanilla release. Never went back for another character. Is it really as bad as I remember? I don’t know.
---
Is grinding the last few levels to 40 normally worth it gold-wise? (Ignoring crazy rare drops like this)
---
I would first suggest to try to break that wall your running against.
---
If mage is boring and you like ranged, try out a hunter.
---
Maybe less wanted in Raids but I dont think that will be an issue.
---
Take into consideration the stats/talents/spells of all classes are based on the 1.12 patch, the patch right before TBC. Everyone is considerably stronger than the release of Onyxia, people are better though.
---
You can slaughter lowbies. DKs are for NPCs.
---
Video I watched dude was in partial pre-BiS, no tier pieces at all. I’ll try and find it if I remember when I get home. 
---
I mean yeah you don’t just ding 60 in your questing greens then go solo Mara lol.
---
Are you sure they're soul-stoning themselves though? No matter the target the spell effect always shows on the Lock.
---
I'm at 4 days and 6 hours. And I'd say I have been going casual as well. Haven't been too focused on leveling as fast as I can
---
Well tons of warlocks have their pet's names in Chinese so I'd assume that's because the client is set to Chinese so it must be possible?
---
oh okay, thank you!
---
If they wipe my progress I'm done.
---
What ui addon(s) are you using for your action bars / map? :)
---
Precisely why i didn’t go faerlina
---
Thank you sir, then I will use it to find Prince Nazjak!
---
Whats that addon to make your and targets healthbar bigger while keeping og unitframe?
---
Mmm gotta love that lovely seduce baby
---
Thanks dude! The addon is called NugEnergy. Have a nice evening :D
---
That's why as a dps, I take it upon myself to mark skulls. Mf'ers don't know how to focus.
---
Urza?! Hell yea.
---
It dropped for me at STV about two weeks ago as well but I’ll be holding on to it for a couple more months

I never understood why growl auto cast mattered to people.  The hunter can even heal their own pet.

Here's a transcription of the [image](https://me.me/i/chinese-league-of-legends-player-nam-xian-recently-got-beaten-837886) I linked [above](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d7dexj/china_has_65_classic_realms_and_most_are_highly/f11uz8c/).
---
&gt; Chinese League of Legends player nam Xian recently got beaten up by a group of World of Warcraft fans.
---
&gt; Xian was screaming 'Demacia! at the movie premeir of 'World of Warcraft' and when the WoW fans heard they were so pissed of that they have beaten up Xian very badly. Xian suffered a broken arm,ribs and he also suffered skull fracture. The group of 5 WoW fans have taken him down on the ground and then they were repeatedly punching him with fists and legs. Xian is out of life danger and he is currently now recovering at the hospital in Hong Kong.
---
I have no way to know how factual or accurate any of this is.
---
According to [imdb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0803096/releaseinfo), WoW movie release date in Hong Kong was June 9, 2016, and in China was June 8, 2016.
---
Adibags is best bag mod IMO
---
Can't ever go back to anything else.
---
See, that's the thing, I believe it's completely unreasonable to tell new players do stuff that builds bad habbits.
---
Yeah it’s absurd and morally bankrupt.
---
Just to check, you're actually plugged into your graphics card right?
---
I’ve found it hard to actually get hold of dps’s on my server more times than I thought I would be so far and plenty of healers just not many tanks
---
Earthfury!
---
Bro!!! Thank you for this!! Was looking at daggers for 60 because swords to me is ehhh. Can’t wait for a shanker
---
Only good gnome is a dead gnome. Good work.
---
Neatplates, elvui, classiccastbars etc.etc. many are working use the twitch desktop app client for installing addons.
---
People still misspelling "rogue" as "rouge".
---
Blizzlike, I guess.
---
Multishot is cleave, Cone of Cold is AoE.
---
Ok ty guys also if I plan on possibly trying to raid in the future would it be best to go fury and dual wield or stay arms and put a few points in fury? I was planning to off tank, prot tank doesn’t seem that appealing to me I just would like to be an asset and not a hindrance for a guild when I join one plus 2H always looks so sick
---
Just shaman and priests. I guess other locks too if they have a felpup.
---
Adds are targeted... so you most likely have searched something to do with, or have watched something to do with classic wow boosting/power leveling/exploits.    
---
     
---
A lot of those speed leveling guides fall under that category which is why you may be seeing them.
---
Do you use the german client on an english server? And if so, why?
---
&gt;Players are the life's blood of the game so if you piss them off in the idea of a better game it doesnt matter because everyone left and now your game is dying
---
What do you think will happen in the event of most of a minority faction leaving a server? The majority will start quitting as well because there is no game to play. If there are two people in a que and one of them is quitting the better option for the life of a game is the one on the higher ratio side leaving or transferring.
---
Gotta have balance man. I'm only lvl 36 because I'm trying not to totally abandon all my responsibilities.
---
What is LiP?
---
Edit: Limited Invulnerability Potion! Figured it out just after posting lol.
---
 I agree priests than an edge but greater blessings are amazing in raids. So I don't think their kit is "so much" better.
---
Didnt you already post this?
---
I can't speak for everyone but often when I join your group I haven't actually left the dungeon and I'm just jumping groups because my previous group has had enough spam running. Hence why my bags are always full, I never leave.
---
no
---
Wasn't this already posted today?
---
This is worth about 4 bars of xp
---
Ooo triggered over being called bad in a video game check, unironically calling other human beings peasants check, being jealous over someone's hard work getting them something you can't obtain, check. Yup that's classic "happy person" right there.
---
You are aware of what that name implies. Dont try to be smart about it. Considering you didnt learn the first time apparently, yes. If you want to take it up with someone, go to Blizzard, not Reddit.
---
My hero!
---
you're the type of person that buys a car at the listed price aren't you?
---
Lol you know theres plenty of pvp in retail for shitty players, i think youd be right at home
---
Warriors rewarded at end-game for the absolutely worst-possible leveling experience of any class.

Everything is nerfed in this patch.

Hm thanks I’ll check that out. Tried classic cast bars but didn’t work. Will have to see this desktop app thing
---
You are what keeps me up at night
---
Like 80% of the reason I came back to vanilla was too bitch about vanilla, it's been great!
---
The fact that retail exists but we're all still sticking it out despite the complaints should tell you how people actually feel :)
---
Leatrix replaced so many of my addons. My go to addons are Leatrix Plus and Leatrix Maps.
---
Get a guildie or friend to invite you. All the dead corpses phase out as you're transported to a new layer dimension where they're magically alive.
---
Play stupid games , win stupid prizes .
---
Good thing i'm horde then, can you purge the paladin bubble?
---
I thought this subreddit liked shitposts
---
This man knows. Also fel dom, summon another vw soul link it and sacrifice again lol
---
The itemization changes are not in the game yet. They will come with AQ. We have the talents from 1.12 and the items from 1.10.
---
Bgs are cross realm
---
You can heal as shadow mostly up til 50.
---
Here’s a few tips.
---
1) do not bubble warriors and druid tanks. It starves them rage. Only shield dps if they take damage.
---
2) avoid using flash heal. It’s tempting to do it because of its cast time but it’s inefficient. Flash heal and shield only in emergency situations on tanks.
---
3) use Heal and renew while healing. Lesser heal is ok lower level dungeons but not as effective as Heal later on. Exchange lesser heal for Greater Heal once that become available.
---
4) Fade is your friend. Use it often to eliminate  and clear threat table. I use Fade when I pull aggro from Healing.
---
5) if you have 5/5 into spirit tap, try to use wand as enemy is low to get the killing blow for the mana regen.
---
6) lastly, i suggest setting up a mouseover macro for your healing spells to avoid having to “click” on the characters you need to heal.
---
Portals cost money. I only give those away for free at the end of a dungeon run.
---
Calling for witch hunts without proof is also against the rules bud.
---
They were negligent and let their bags get full. The entire conversation about layering was just an excuse to have a second chance at managing their inventory correctly.
---
Player uses smoke screen! It is super effective!
---
I think I'm too anti 1.12 for this reddit.  Haha.
---
The basilisks in stv can incapacitate you for 10 seconds
---
While I accept that it's anti consumer, no free trial is what helps protect us from gold spammers spelling out their website in corpses and other wonky shit like that.
---
You can enslave another warlocks infernal or doomguard if their enslave on it wears off. Regular demons, no.
---
Geez dude, you sound like you had a bad day
---
Transfers typically make faction balance worse, not better.
---
Felgaurd quest is given in Felwood .
---
Lol sure ^^ sounds great.
---
Ok so the tank can‘t move the mobs and loses the rage which he would normally gain by taking damage. It is just super annoying. Also some mobs cleave
---
Yeah I recognize the name and gear, had a chuckle he ran from more than just me lol
---
I’m level 41 and I’ve been seeing people (streamers, guild chat, general chat, message boards) using the term “casuals” to describe those in the 30s and 40s at this point. I’d just like to say that’s absurd and I’ve felt slightly offended whenever I’ve heard things like this. I have a more than full time job, family, girlfriend and I’ve still been averaging probably 25-30 hours a week playing WoW. 
---
That doesn’t seem at all casual.
---
Oh no kidding? Neat.
---
You disgrace the horde
---
Raise ticket and gm will give u 2 days of game time
---
Usually doesn't take long to form a group.  I'd say tanks are in higher demand than anything, but you don't sit there for an hour spamming.
---
Shaman if horde, paladin if alliance. Every heal at that level is basically lay on hands so you want a healer hybrid class and there's not many good spellpower enchants. Fiery weapon + some strength is way more than enough to pretty much 2 shot anything you come across. Don't forget movespeed on boots so you can kite or chase everything.
---
I also had a blacksmith hammer that I'd equip so my weapon didn't glow, then just use a macro to switch to my fiery once hit.
---
ty!
---
Yeah it is treated as a mob basically.
---
Faction inbance not low population.... No server has an actual low population. But some servers have 75%+ of one faction over the other.
---
Don’t worry they’ll let people go to your server if it’s low pop
---
The problem is that sometimes a small pull can turn into a big one. That's why I'm always nervous of healers who insist on running on fumes before drinking. Always hope for the best but plan for the worst and it'll go smoother even with accidents and surprises.
---
Bestial Wrath is one of your actual abilities, not the pet. Intimidation is the same way. It’s under the BM tab of your skill book.
---
They're such beta alphas

Honestly, I thought it'd fit in with all the other posts. I guess I'll have to wait until next week to cash in on that karma 😩
---
Well report him and that wont be his name for much longer. Add him to friends list, youll see when it gets changed.
---
A quest for horde called a test of lore. You need to read a book and answer a question from that book. If you answer incorrectly you get teleported away and get that debuff. I was in stonetalon mountain doing this, and actually read the book and got the answer right. Next to me some dude suddenly disappeared, and when I whispered him what happened he put me on ignore. Thats when sadly I realized classic wow is never truly going to be like vanilla wow...
---
Hauling ass to SM Is a real thing. Even from chill wind camp. 
---
I prefer the run from south shore tho. Spill some blood on the way.
---
I don't like it when people just open trade in dungeons either. Just ask.
---
Of course, at the start of a run I always offer.
---
With tank aggro as inconsistent in classic as it is, I personally find the two points in Healing Focus completely worth it, but ymmv (doesn't hurt when leveling either).
---
And here I thought I was lucky getting an Ironfoe on my 7th Emperor kill.
---
These are actually spells that you cast that buff your pet. So they should be in your spellbook and not an ability your pet uses.
---
If they don’t show up in your spellbook maybe do a /reload ui command and maybe try respeccing again (if all else fails).
---
Thank you! I already used fade after I pulled aggro and I continued getting attacked. Is it normal? Or am I missing something
---
Aren’t you on odd numbers because of misses/parry?
---
Anyone happen to know of  a PVP server on US east that has good alliance PVP guilds ?
---
Good point.
---
TBC introduced Mass Dispel which did remove the bubble, but in Classic you are completely invulnerable to anything a player can do. 
---
It's 100% a free getaway.
---
Never even thought of that! As a troll thats perfect on STV.
---
https://www.wowclassicaoe.com/
---
Beware the popular spots are usually well farmed by other mages but for good reason
---
That makes no sense at all. 
---
First of all OP's complaint is about people bashing on others for transferring to less populated servers, not about imbalanced servers. 
---
Second of all you don't seem to understand hypocrisy. Hypocrisy is about keeping up false pretenses of having certain qualities or virtues. About criticising others for behaviour you show as well. Being unhappy about server imbalance and then transferring servers is not hypocritical. Blaming or criticising others for server balance issues while then contributing to it by transferring would be.
---
This dudes an idiot, he said it was him just above.
---
How u get class colors?
---
It's in your own spellbook under beast mastery.
---
I know of several guilds that have already done multiple MC clears with feral main tanks.
---
Maybe you should overthink your idea of fun if it consists of ruining dozens of people's day.
---
Bags are for loot.
---
Lmao he actually edited that and took it out
---
Could spell batching explain all of the randomness I've experienced with it? Like my friend was helping me test and based on what was happening he thinks it has some kind of facing requirement. Also whether or not the target is in range whenever the crit happens and if auto-attacking is actually "active" seems to play in.
---
Is batching that impactful that it could be causing a bunch of seemingly random conditions like that?
---
Like I've had shit happen like it not give me any autos, then a few autos later it would expend a bunch of latent charges.
---
I went through BFD today starting out with a full 10-slot quiver of arrows and by the end I had just two stacks left. Fast weapons, rapid fire, and procs on certain talents will absolutely do that - you basically can't go into a dungeon without starting full up on ammo. x)
---
Well, this was possible in Vanilla wow as well ;)
---
lol brother I am a r13 player on p servers and been in man premades
---
Working on mine too and I’m a holy priest. It’s brutal. I ask people who have theirs and they just say dungeon farms. :(
---
No it is not worth it. Keep axe spec most lvling weapons are axes anyway.
---
Can confirm, never played classic, tried cleaving to rush 60, hit 43 and now playing COD. Am I cringe?
---
In this case, that won't help OP because WF cannot apply to a mainhand weapon which has a poison on it.
---
In chat? Prat.
---
And this is the cool part about PvP servers. The fight for materials in the late game.
---
A pun to what?  Something that didn’t even exist yet when this game came out the first time?
---
[1.12 patch](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.12.0)  
---
They said it somewhere, but it's in there.
---
Weapons for druids are stat sticks. Nothing more. There's a lot of good info out there though for druids.
---
If you want a great weapon, do Gnomer:
---
* [Manual Crowd Pummeler](https://classicdb.ch/?item=9449)
---
BiS LW helm
---
*  [Wolfshead Helm](https://classicdb.ch/?item=8345)
---
Absolutely. A happy pet is a happy hunter, they do probably more than half the work for us, gotta give them treats and all the /pets. They deserve it. Good owly, that’s a good bird.
---
Haha ohh okey! What inspire you to using Daban as a nickname if i may ask?
---
“ENOUGH!!!! I tire of this!”
---
What phase 5?
---
You don't lose durability if you're killed by a player, I usually only bubblehearth if i'm getting camped otherwise I'd rather just die, it's just not worth the cooldown especially in a zone where pvp skirmishes are expected to happen more than once per hour.
---
Layering doesn't actually "increase players allowed" it just spreads them out.
---
And you have to understand that it makes almost no difference. It were one thing if 38 people could now do a 40 man raid, but 20 people pugs are consistently beating it.
---
The more you have,  the easier it is to make more.
---
24/7 green barrens chat you say.
---
Was in searing gorge trying to do the Stolen Tools quest where you have to retrieve some smithing tool that drops off of a Dark Iron steamsmith. According to Wowhead, it has an 18% droprate. I had to kill around 50 to get it to drop (and there are only like 5 of them at a time with about a 5 min respawn).
---
More powerful how?
---
So, the reason it matters. 
---
It does not reset aggro, it brings the pets threat to that of the tank. For example: tank at 127 threat, pet at 17, pet taunts, pet is now at 127. 
---
Healers will out threat a pets threat gen, mobs taunted will eventually peal off from the pet to kill the healer. 
---
A tank views their #1 job as keeping the healer alive. ANY dps can out threat a tank, even the best tanks, so their goal is to dps below the threat the tank is generating. 
---
To be very clear, i will actively let dumb dps die, its their job to keep themselves alive. The healer is my( the tanks) responsibility. 
---
Also hunters are NOTORIOUS for barely knowing how the game works. Blizzard shouldnt have give them pets imo, should have been a deepish bm hunter talent.
---
I think the setup is totally custom. To achieve this just get Bartender4 and start tweaking.
---
You don't just randomly get layered.
---
Leaving a group won't change your layer either.
---
Nightfall actually does have an animation. There are like black sparkles around the caster when it procs.
---
Hunter
---
Prat?
---
Fall damage, drowning damage, everything a player can do to you, most all regular mob and boss abilities, most raid boss abilities. 
---
For example Deep Breath will be ignored with a correctly timed DS while Nefarians Shadowflame will still kill you. 
---
Regarding usability, the only things that can prevent you from using Divine shield are sitting, cooldown and spell locked holy school. A normal silence wont prevent you from activating Divine Shield, same as fears, stuns, polymorphs etc.
---
This isn’t quite right either. Layering *does* increase server capacity in that blizzard would have a population cap much lower per server without layering. Say they don’t want more than 10k per layer. After 10k players, another layer is generated and split evenly with new players being distributed evenly. Once 20k+ is reached, another layer is generated and so forth. 
---
This is why queue times are so different now than they were in vanilla. You aren’t waiting on other players to log out, you are waiting on resources for layer generation/placement.
---
The issue stands that having, let’s say 4, layers of a 10k population is that when layering is removed, the single “layer” left cannot support the player base. This is why they are pushing so hard to move players to lower population realms, they realized all too late that offering 10 servers initially was beyond stupid.
---
TL;DR- yes when layering *is* removed before P2, queue times on popular servers will suffer immensely unless blizzard opens more customizable realm transfers.
---
Talking about the ones in badlands.
---
And don't buy the car that day, leave after low balling them if they are "acting"  reluctant, but give them your email. 
---
Better believe they'll hit you up within a week with "manager approved" discounts.
---
Going on a tangent here but I'm surprised people aren't hired to professionally haggle for car buyers.
---
Is this a serious comment? War is by far the worst class to level.
---
Rogue have options to just avoid fights, or run away. As a warrior you have two options, kill the thing or die.
---
More like getting comfy with the heat from your laptop.
---
What add-on are you using that shows market price of items?
---
No kidding. Had completely forgotten that underwater breathing actually mattered. As an orc warrior there are many quests where you have to dive, pull a mob and then start going back to surface because killing the mob underwater means you won't have enough breath to resurface. I think they increased the timer for everyone at one point and then everyone got items to give infinite breath anyway so it hasn't mattered in a long time. UD racial also pretty useful in vanilla.
---
Unfortunate, but nothing they can do about it aside from work on coding the layering loot better so it doesn't happen in the future.
---
Popping BoF when PvPing a mage is one of the most satisfying things. You can see the fear in there eyes as there slows do nothin
---
I love when while some of the group are rolling for a chest and some idiot just goes in and takes it. Guess whose not getting heals or buffs for the rest of the dungeon!
---
Thanks for the info, makes sense now.
---
I was thinking gpu too
---
Ya’ll misremembering. The hoohoorann one wasn’t what caused the fix, it was when people were using it to cheese a phase of c’thun
---
I think (On Westfall) our average level is like..low 40's now?
---
That's the part where he starts throwing rocks, because he's fucking dead.
---
NPCs and other lore names are protected by Blizz. Has been the case since 1.0.
---
That’s the name of the addon
---
I mean, if it's an unfair fight and you're absolutely going to get smacked I don't blame him
---
One other thing is as a healer, I suggest getting a threat meter... that way you can avoid overhealing and pull threat.
---
While the tauren scratches his ass
---
Just to experience it again.
---
Its base config is original specs, you can bump most of it up to modern
---
Nice, keep always doing that,  for research purposes
---
I keep hearing auctionator doesn't work on classic. Is there a hotfix, or was I told lies?
---
i snooped around to see how they are in end game coz sooner or later im gonna get to that sweet 60. there was threads in this sub "life at 60" if you search you will most likely find it. i watched some vids on youtube about both pvp and pve side and it was pretty easy choice after. before reaserche i wanted either mage rogue or hunter. in the emd i chosed Warrior coz that playing wow on man-mode and in end game i will just smash. I did made alt who is lvl 12 now on who i play when quest spot is runned by hords or someone starts to camp me.
---
You mixmax WoW guys are some of the most sensitive people I've ever seen.
---
I've only ever seen that drop once.
---
plenty of fish in the sea
---
water breathing, rank 1 recklessness and banish have saved me numerous times already, and yet I see people saying not to train them. It's crazy; they're not even expensive.
---
edit: also used eye of kilrogg for pulling in elite towers
---
Do you have another map addon? I had an issue trying to get it to work exactly like yours. Leatrix fixed that issue for me.
---
I just tanked a RFD at level 40 and can cross off more of these than I care to...  
---
That group has caused me to avoid dungeons for a day or two. I'm having a tough time even finding motivation to log in at the moment.
---
I’LL END YOU
---
Yeah, except at max-level with engineering Paladin ganking sucks, it's probably the worst class in the game if you want to gank, and i'm pretty sure Paladins get ganked far more often than they do the ganking unless they're in a group.
---
You on Westfall? Cause that's a huge problem i'm having on that server lol.
---
I just want to do BRS/Strat/Scholo but everyone is just hitting Uld
---
Is that an addon?
---
Good call on the GCD, I'll try it out and see if my dps improves.
---
There are a ton of reasons why people just steamroll it this time. It’s known content with tons of guides. People have gotten better playing the game. A lot of game mechanics are well known nowadays. People know the best builds for each class and spec. People know exactly where to get their pre-raid BiS items. People aren’t playing on a crappy PC that gets &lt;10 fps in raids anymore, with a small 4:3 monitor where most of the screen is hidden by UI elements. There are way more powerful addons nowadays, like weakauras and a lot more people are using addons.
---
please keep politics off the classicwow sub.

There are consequences for acting like an asshole.

I thought you meant the pig in Elwynn for a minute, and was really confused.

There is no agro reset associated with a pet’s growl.
---
Not only that but it also pisses me off when someone says "I need water" or "give me water." Pretty much anything demanding like that. Like bich I ain't no vending machine. ASK me nicely to give you water and I will drop a fat stack or two on you and we all move on happy. Don't just demand I give you something because we are in the same group. The manners on these people yeesh.
---
Mograine EU. I guess everyone is behind me still lvling.
---
TLDR: Don't drop mining, just start saving all the tailoring mats that drop for you and once engineering is 300 THEN switch. 
---
The nice part about tailoring is that you can get most of the mats without a gathering profession. Which means you can save up the mats while keeping mining/engineering. Send all the tailoring mats to a bank alt (or two or three lol) as you level. Basically save all the cloth you get, especially mageweave and runecloth, but you can look up lists of all the mats you'll need. 
---
Then continue leveling mining and engineering imo. Just keep saving tailoring mats and wait until you've gotten engineering to 300 before dropping mining. I have a lock too and personally I'm just going to wait to see if Robe of the Void drops for me and once it does I'll drop mining and hopefully have all the mats saved up for tailoring by that point that I can level up 1-300 in a day.
---
Your Username says otherwise
---
My god you guys get way too hyped at someone getting suspended. Calm the fuck down.
---
Are you me? I had this same issue last night after getting the spyglass on the first kill of a lookout.
---
wow a 3 man crew you sound unstoppable
---
I know you said it's a Nelf but all I see is a animal rights activist Belf.
---
As a service member I totally agree!
---
My entire group in BFD died today fighting a naga underwater because they forgot to breathe. I was a druid and just switched to aquatic form quickly but my group just...  drowned...
---
I mean you probably didn't show the 6 other horde boys you got with you so
---
Honestly the fact that is you’re angry enough to post about those mobs only relevant for 2 quests on here so you’re passionate enough about the game for that. No issue here.
---
I swear it’s turning into r/wow effortless content, no disrespect to OP.
---
Yeah you get mass dispel once you hit level 64.
---
Remember in WotLK when it was all about the GearScore; if you didn't have the right gearscore, you weren't welcome, meaning you couldn't get the GearScore. Often people would be wanting a GS higher than the instance dropped so getting a group to gear up was near impossible. One of the reasons that Dungeon Finder became a thing.
---
In classic it's becoming all about having exactly the right classes with exactly the right talents. If you didn't roll or don't enjoy the meta, groups will be fewer and further between. People who play those groups expect slots in normal runs as well as their cleave groups, but if you aren't one of those specific builds, you can't play "their" way.  
---
Just wait patiently until they have finished all the content and have nothing left to get and moved onto something else.
---
Not all Classic content is available now. It is being released in phases. We are now in phase 1.
---
Is there any reason to increase herbalism beyond 300, via enchants or herbalism gloves?
---
The mana cost + no mana regen for 5s after is the main reason it's worse.
---
Yeah, I’ll parrot the others’ disbelief: this either didn’t happen, is exaggerated, or you were already low. A level 22 has 500+ HP and that’s *very* conservative. A level 19 twink might barely manage crits like that. A level 2 can’t even land a spell or swing on a level 22.
---
You must have not looked very hard...
---
Were you going to buy the item?
---
The best part of paladins bubble hearthing is both people feel like they won.
---
Pally: Haha he must be so mad.
---
Other person: Haha they had to bubble hearth.
---
Toof?
---
I’ll try this. Thank you!
---
Healers whiteout Mana food.
---
One of the most popular arguments against this idea is that introducing an artificial queue as an attempt to balance the game is crossing some kind of line. But the existing login queue *is already* an artificial queue to balance the game. The population limit exists primarily to keep the game balanced in the way it was designed to be played. The game was also designed to pit a roughly even number of Horde against Alliance. While I'm not 110% convinced a faction-based queue is the perfect answer, I do think it's worth discussing constructively and "git gud Alliance scum" comments only accentuate the problem. When most players are on the favorable faction, it's difficult to even have a real conversation about the topic.
---
Some people who play Hunter are just f****** retarded
---
one note is that i have tons of wow experience so i kinda know what to expect. In the very start i did the same as you only lvled to lvl 20 and then switched.  Few thinks i can ask you thay may help you to choose. Do you want to heal ? dps ? tank ? or be hybrid?
---
Fellow cosmerenaut?
---
"if I pull 50 mobs"
---
There's your problem right there. Even at 60 a ton of little mobs will own you. As others said, need to make sure they don't touch you. Try watching some old-school vanilla videos on farming SFK or Deadmines. Most of the time those videos have peeps in T2 or better popping trinkets, CDs, pots. So keep in mind your gear isn't there yet.
---
Do it I’ll come on my level 60 and make you look bad.
---
Just buy it off the ah for fair market price. If you won't, it's worth just as much to your party as it is to you.
---
Vampires produce the best fabric for sailing the open seas.
---
Because you named yourself after a long dick. Any other questions?
---
Why would you get mad if someone bubble hearths? You just came out the victor and wasted a lot of their time and they look like noobs
---
BGs come in p3. P2 is ranking in outdoor pvp. If your faction has much less players it's going to be farmed by the other faction in BRM and entrances of Scholo and Strat.

INV FOR ASMON LAYER PLS

I'm guessing Shaman's water breathing will overwrite a Warlock's if they're cast on the same target?
---
I’m mostly trying to escape the roving deathsquads preventing me from questing
---
Just saw an actual commercial for classi character boosts on YouTube. Isn't that against Blizzard rules? Surprised that they advertise so openly
---
My very first run on my priest alt was RFC and the random DPS warrior in the party rolled need on a pair of cloth shoulders and won over the two healers in the group.
---
He wouldn't say a word in chat the entire run but we were getting carried by a level 25 hunter anyway so the other healer whispered me and we just stopped healing him.
---
Combat would end with both of us on full mana but him on like 20% hp and he would turn around to face us both with his 10% HP and then just start bandaging himself. Still not saying a word in chat.
---
After the first time we had to rez him he started passing on rolls and all was right in the world ~~until the hunter made a jump without dismissing his pet and wiped us for the SECOND TIME in one run~~
---
I didn't realise how much I missed all these shenanigans until that run :P
---
It rly isn't. I've played pservers with 8 debuffs until ZG and it didn't make much of a difference in raid dps. Besides this is fucing onyxia, there's no dps race it's a mechanics boss..Don't get breathed or feared and don't overaggro tank and you win. Dps does not matter one bit, hell people intentionally slow down dps to not overaggro on this boss.

Grats. Got lucky with the hyacinth macaw that I’m hoping funds my mounts.
---
Other than taking rage away from tank, a Warrior's most efficient threat ability is Revenge, which requires a mob to swing at them.
---
Less mobs swinging at them means less Revenges, combined with less rage means significantly less threat, which means more DPS aggro, which means healer has to burn more mana healing everyone, etc. etc. hopefully you understand it now.
---
He is probably the most difficult of the four as well.
---
Stam, int, spell power, or frost/fire spell. Pretty simple really. And you can always unequip and item, re-equip it to see what difference it makes to your stats. Like a druid gets 1ap from agility, and 2 from str, and you can test it by using different pieces of gear.

Commenting on this one cos it’s at the top, but having read the thread... It’s not a question of deserve, it’s what happens when you repeatedly violate tos.

At the end of the day, you have every right to dislike the rules, but you agreed to them so you can’t really complain when they’re enforced.

Yea but 30 runs later and I still haven’t even seen HoJ ..
---
It was my first permanent one that I lost :(
---
A mount doesn’t trivialize the hardest fight in AQ 40 like this ooze does. But different strokes for different folks.
---
You couldve just taken a screenshot
---
If you can get a boost for your whirlwind axe, the 30's are an absolute joke.
---
It’s bugged and doesn’t actually do what it says, i believe it just resets your auto attack as of rn.
---
It was, yeah!
---
It's an uldaman quest IIRC... not sure on quest or item name, but should help narrow down the search for you. Good luck!
---
Try just picking a class and spec that's useful, you know you enjoy, and going with it. If your group needs a healer or a Tank, think about filling that role. Even if u think you might like another class better, remind yourself that you still like your class. 
---
I thought about how I wanted to be a lock, an s priest, enh shaman, but then I also reminded myself that I like my class too and it's probably just the "grass is greener" effect
---
Don't get me wrong, I thought OP's video was hilarious and I don't doubt that the frostmane troll trick works, just saying they don't really look alike and it probably only works because of the likeliness of encountering new players in low level zones and the lack of expectation for a lvl 7 enemy to be in hostile territory.
---
How do you auto loot while pickpocketing for Rogues?
---
I've often wondered this - how do you keep aggro on all 4 of the pull when the hunter opens with multishot and the lock dots every enemy? Genuinely curious, I don't know shamans' tanking suite at all.
---
Nah not really mate, you can leave any time.
---
Good.  This is what I came back for.
---
/w your friend? I still dont understand. There's absolutely no reason to be leaving or joining parties with loot left.
---
Edit: and if your friend wasnt in the party when it dropped, he'd never get it anyway unless it's boe. In which case you can Insta loot. There's so much that doesn't add up here.
---
It was an 11stam, 10 str plate legs that I wanted to give to my friend who is a warrior tank. I didn't think to immediately create inventory space for it because I would have left it in the corpse if it wasn't an upgrade for him.
---
☹️☹️ I didn’t but sounds like I’m not the only one this has happened to over time! I’m so sad
---
I'm most comfortable with dps, but I like to keep my options open for healing/tanking just in case I want to try it out later on down the road. Thats pretty vague but thats all I know at this point lmao
---
yea i dodnt get it till 40 by then i had ravager
---
Is there a general consensus on Auctioneer vs Auctionator?
---
Unless you're packed to the teeth with arrows or bullets it never ends up being enough. :/
---
Oh, cool.
---
As a healer I feel there are more of us than tanks on Grob
---
What will really burn you out, is listening to someone else decide what you should play. Go with your gut instinct, and just play it. It should be stated that before level 20 or so, you don't really get the real flavour of how a class plays.
---
It does! I think he was happy/content when I logged out, if you’re offline does that stay the same or gradually reduce?
---
All I see as a shadow priest - I’m not last
---
If you’re so bad and you beat him maybe he should “go back” too
---
Talvash scrying bowl thingy from the uldaman quest chain I believe is what you are talking about.  You need the necklace that drops from trash around ulda then go to IF to t.d.k.  back to ulda to the paladin guy I think that is when you get it?  Or maybe tdk gives it to you.  One of those.
---
Your tauren friend their was about to teach him how to count all the way... too shfifty-five
---
&gt; Classes with bad effective time per kill get more benefit from running quests than classes that kill quickly.
---
Yeah when I play my rogue I'm more tolerant of farming. But mostly I play priest and get bored wanding for an hour straight. So I prioritize questing as much as possible.
---
I agree with this, but the GM response was a bone headed one that made it me much more sympathetic to the OP
---
Ah ok is that why naked Rogue is a thing? Because of their just flat out awful kit haha
---
What is dead may never die.
---
Hey thanks for this response and for checking.
---
It's a laptop and I've never had the case open.
---
Yes, perhaps I should invest in a good wand...
---
It really wouldn’t surprise me if it was bugged.
---
I’m sorry but the horde outside scarlet monastery have made a permanent enemy.
---
😰 thank you
---
Zug Zug
---
There is a talent that resets CD on all frost spells DM isnt the best for solo farming though because it is so long and narrow.
---
Definitely haven't seen any of those yet
---
Yeah, bitter at stupid comments.
---
Ha!  That’s a good one.  Sounds a little harsh to me.  I’d let it go, personally, but I’m guessing it’s a ToS violation.
---
If the realm reaches a point where it requires a new layer wouldn't it have to layer half the population? It's not like once it reaches the limit on a layer the next layer starts with 1 person and builds up. It splits the population. 
---
They said there's only single digit layers so a new layer being created or disappearing is probably pretty rare, but based on how it works it has to layer people out of group every once in a while.
---
I fell into the first moat cause I was playing peggle the other day. Water walking =/= plague walking :(
---
I mean ooze doesn't for at least 99% of people it drops for either. You're gonna be better off selling it to that 1%.
---
Blizzard servers have been acting funky lately, I was disconnected from the social services. Whispering via real ID also sometimes do not actually link the item. We're also not in the same guild. It was in fact a BoE
---
Yeah, I find playing a healer/support to be really satisfying but at the same time it's frustrating being so dependent - you might not be able to just queue for a BG and enjoy it because you're reliant on others protecting you.
---
Only Priests and Mages to the high ground. One can Mind Control, the other can counterspell enemy Mind Controls
---
Rattlegore!
---
What they mean is that decimated means reduced by one tenth (so half city got decimated means half of 10% so 5% died), but it actually means reduced by a lot, as you used it. It's a weird word because it has the prefix deci in it, but that prefix has nothing to do with the meaning of the whole word.
---
Not me, though, fastest /wave in the west
---
Woah this is amazing and hilarious hahahahahahahahaha
---
To be honest, I'm not sure - however it's tied to the same subscription, so if you do get the retail trial it *might* work for Classic.
---
free devilsaur roaming... my dream... impossible on skeram lol
---
enough tanks, that is... "tanks". not many that know what they're doing and are specced right
---
Yeah this tends to work.  I've got anywhere from 1 to 7 days by asking to check out the game to see if I want to resub.
---
&gt;different strokes for different folks.
---
Second post ever on that acc, and both posts are stolen from others that you act like are yours. Interesting
---
Some people claimed they got "returning veterans" offers by contacting customer support directly. I don't know if that could be your case
---
Yeah hopefully they patch this music, you’re right
---
&gt;i heard that can make me some good money early game
---
Yeah skinning is great for that, just toss whatever you skin on the AH and you'll typically find buyers.
---
Late game you can farm Devilsaurs and their leather goes for something like 20g/ea atm on my server. 
---
&gt;i want to be able to craft some good items for myself while leveling
---
Yeah this is probably the best aspect of it, you might be just farming some random monsters when some pattern/resource drops that lets you create some cool new gear.
---
Wearing gear that you crafted just feels cool too. 
---
&gt;I should also mention that im playing PvE
---
Probably not worth getting Engineering unless you plan to do a lot of PvP then. It has some other niche uses (e.g. teleporters, useful trinkets, discombobulators etc) but I find the big appeal are the items you can use in PvP.
---
Except the itemization changes are in the game. That was one of the big things Blizzard said from the start. Literally just inspect anyone with a piece of tier gear to see for yourself. My T1 hunter bracers aren't packed with spirit, for example.
---
Yeah but have you farmed up at least 2 dozen Manual Crowd Pummelers for DPS?
---
Unluko
---
I didn’t say that anywhere in my post, but nice try at strawmanning me. I didn’t even imply that I’m good at the game.
---
Not exactly a trial you are looking for it doesn't sound like.  You've tried the game and you like it.  If you want to experience it again just get a month sub.
---
Everything useless except the mailbox one that I thought everyone knew about
---
The biggest problem with priests wanding when healing a dungeon is timing the interrupt of your wanding when you need to get a heal off again.  
---
Sometimes you are wanting to cast a heal, but the signal to the server is still "shoot" so your gcd triggers and you lose 1.5s, which can be a problem. So picking when you can wand for mana, and when that 40dps for 6 seconds isn't worth missing that critical heal is a big deal.
---
The mage sucks pretty hard bro
---
But this isn't vanilla, it's Classic. Layering is a legitimate game mechanic whether you like it or not.
---
There is a gator in the SW canals...
---
which succubus does,too. 
---
"a few seconds" is literally a single dot tick. which pulls agro from a vw as well as a succubus
---
Did you level as fury dual wield then?
---
I only have 3 buttons and i use them for (im a hunter). Pet attack, auto attack(ranged) and hunters mark.
---
Also sounds really fucking bad
---
Player created content. Nice job OP!
---
A bit different. Cod is pretty much just a twitch shooter. Its basically saying youre all aim and no brain
---
Yeah, I like it a lot. I started using my second monitor to look stuff up as I'm questing, or if I'm lost on something. 
---
What class as you trying? Maybe you need a change. I have been enjoying a protection warrior, after briefly trying hunter, and been a tank successfully in a few dungeons.
---
About to start playing casual with my wife!

I've only seen one Alliance get murdered on the boat, as a horde. He explained that it was revenge for the guy mind controlling him off the dock several times a while back.

Gnomes look shady as fuck though.

Shift mouse wheel, alt mouse wheel, cntl mouse wheel. You can get creative to make it so your hands don’t have to move
---
My guild has done all content like 10 days ago. Obviously another guild helped out (with numbers), and they had a few lvl 55s etc.. but since then its been on farm lol
---
But what, there are servers with less than 40 lvl 60s? The fuck is that even possible?
---
I mean, we all said to have progressive itemization, progressive talents, and no layers, all of which would have made the game far more difficult and would have better reflected original WoW. Blame Blizzard.
---
Journey before destination
---
How was it bone headed?
---
they did not lol. stop spreading this myth. just go read through the patch notes.
---
I use them for my druid forms. You can bind anything so I'd suggest go ahead and just experiment.
---
No? Reddit wasn't made so you can take other people's life experiences and try to make your uninteresting life seem better. Do your own shit and post it. This is just pathetic
---
they're pretty standard?
---
Wow had to mod all of the skeletons and skulls out for china, I imagine you could find the file and replace it with a different mob or somethiby, but thats probably against the ToS
---
In actual vanilla you could do model swaps, but it was against the TOS and could get you banned. I'm not sure if it's even possible anymore. There is definitely no way to do this sort of thing legitimately.
---
Moderate yourself my man.
---
Carrot on a Stick (ZF Reward for killing GZ)

Mithril Spurs (Blacksmithing)

Riding Enchant (Enchanting)

As far as I know there's not much else.
---
Also true lool
---
I'm not arguing against that. I'm just asking how much "utility" this guy thinks he needs to clear stockades.
---
Outstanding move
---
also available on pservers (which were way herder than classic) for years.
---
It also 100% wouldn't have happened if he had put it in his bag before joining a new group.  That's why layering isn't 100% to blame.
---
It seemed like picking skinning / herbalism would be more useful in making money while leveling
---
Carrot on a stick
---
Mithril spurs enchant on boots.
---
\+mount speed enchant on gloves.

You sound like a lock.
---
That cant be right. Server name?
---
I must have missed that in the description.
---
Don't stop your drink if a DPS decides to pull new mobs. Let them die. They will remember such behaviour and hopefully stop.
---
Ima have to assume he meant 1.1 way back when. Though, I cant say. I picked the game up in 1.3 and didnt hit 60 for months so
---
Have I been to the moon to find out if there's less gravity there? No, I'm pretty sure everyone isn't lying about it though.
---
People can't have arguments on their own btw.
---
How did Warlock end a tier above Feral Druid with the same DPS? The list also misses out the other Rogue spec on the graph.
---
Edit; Just reread and Warlock has a higher max, the graph only shows the average.
---
The time is irrelevant, never really predicts correctly, just look at your position in queue. That’s a better estimate
---
What makes you think you were moved to a new layer?
---
yup, unless that was some weird private server thing, but I doubt it.
---
it definitely is hard to notice if you aren't looking for it.
---
Video game screenshots are life experiences? Lol, k
---
Reddit is about imaginary internet points. People in this sub love low effort content, so I'm delivering. My only mistake was not waiting long enough between posts.
---
Locks enslave demons. It is not a bond of love.
---
On Whitemane I haven't yet been invited to a group and not been layered. It's clear that our population is in the 10s, 20s, maybe even 30+ thousands. That many people cannot share as static server. As I said: the two choices they face are leaving it on or forcibly separating realms.
---
Dot ticks never pull aggro away from my VW. CoA, Immolation, and Corruption. If I start wanding or shadow bolting, it immediately loses threat. If you're having difficulties with VW while leveling you're probably doing something wrong.
---
And I'm not specced into demonology at all.
---
Nice choice of music. Made me want to play it all over again.
---
Sure, but considering how much of an advantage hunters get questing wise they can deal with a bit of getting fucked. Supply lines are poor, there are less vendors than there would be in better supplied areas, you'll have to source placement ammunition yourself. It's a roleplaying game, role play.
---
no it isn't.
---
I thought so, I tried it and could never get it too look neat? Also a lot of stuff disappeared , guild chat, item rolls etc. I couldn’t work it out..
---
there was a 40 priest Onyxia kill on original vanilla. also a 5 man one i think. she's easy.
---
Leveling with a friend who's a warrior. Can't wait to use BoF on him the moment a mage tries their BS
---
Sorry but that's not how layering works. It does not increase the server capacity. I really don't know why this is getting repeated again and again by some people. If each layer would hold a full server worth of capacity then the entire system was destined to fail from the start. Blizzard explained exactly how layering works in several blue posts in the forum.  
---
On my server they have reduced the number of layers significantly as you can see how very populated it is everywhere with players now compared to before when more layers were active to split up the people better and it did not increase any queue times. 
---
Again you can read up on what layering does and what the purpose of layering is in various blue posts in the official forum.
---
What would that macro look like?
---
our group would have gotten wiped in BFD unless we had 1 undying and me as druid noticing underwater damage ticking.
---
Yeah in dungeons I’ll typically take the tip the first time I trade water but after that first one I say no worries on tip next time. Outside of dungeons I encourage a tip but won’t be mad if someone doesn’t. Ports on the other hand I will ask for silver to make up rune costs.
---
There are plenty of people at 60 now (probably for over a week) that didn't abuse layering.
---
This is exactly what I love about mage water in dungeons. As heals/dps, I can stop and drink whenever, for however long, and I don’t worry about getting all the use out of the water. I can stop for 5s drinks at the beginning of each pull and regen some quick mana before the tank needs healing again
---
It's good that he acknowledged a problem but dude just posted to the entire internet that WoW interfered with sex, of course there's gonna be jokes.

---
Too many cult like fandom around this shit. People base their entire self worth attached to name brands like apple, samsung, or video game companies like blizzard or valve. An insult to their favorite company is taken extremely personal.
---
Couldn't believe how obvious and good it was after I installed it.  And how I'd never heard anyone mention it before.
---
fear, dot dot, refear, immolate, drain, fear rinse and repeat until dead. if they WoF then you do something else for a few seconds then refear.
---
well didnt want to sound like an asshole i had pc from tbc area until spring and stopped raiding because of 10-15 fps in raids in legion, but eventually said enough is enough and bought new pc.. but on that old pc i had 40 fps in bfa in harbor... so i cant imagine 35 fps in classic...
---
How is it better than bagnon? Never heard of it

there aren't diminishing returns until TBC.

That's a strangely cropped screenshot, what are you hiding ?
---
I've leveled as MM. I'm lvl 51 now. Had no issues. I don't like relying on my pet.
---
I think  this is indeed true. I did read through all the patches one day when the ques where loooongand I think it was around 1.6 or 1.8 I read about either a nerf i mob hp and dmg and then there was another similar change around 1.3(ish). Keep in mind this was not on blizzard official site but a reputable fansite.
---
I would have to dive back in to it to fin the specifics.
---
Nah, that's exploring the oasis. The mushroom one leads to the delivery to thunder bluff which gives you cauldron stirrer.

Yeah, will be switching the first chance I get.

I like killing dirty allaince. If they bubble hearth, they didn't die

I still don't have it, but going to buy it as soon as it unlocks.

I’m at level 35 myself, sometimes I go days without playing (work is hard, must sleep after).
---
Sometimes I feel behind as well, but so far I’ve never had a problem running a dungeon or finding help with quests.
---
And in true tauren form, the instant battle animation ends, the scratching begins.
---
Stats:
---
Agi=str&gt;stam is the short version.  Int and spirit aren't useless, but for feral, they are much less important.
---
Weapon damage isn't relevant (we use our claws...), so weapons are just stat sticks (equipped or on use effects count; chance on hit effects don't work).
---
Wolfshead Helm is bis for feral dps for powershifting.  Still a bit useful for bears, but nowhere near bis.
---
Manual Crowd Pummeler has an incredible on use effect, but only has 3 charges.  For use in specific raid fights, where you need the threat (or dps for cats), it is clear bis.  Everywhere else (which includes levelling), it's mediocre.
---
Parried by a blind lion, the struggle is real
---
I like to think of it like when you killed it you hit the heart and made it unusable.
---
then polymorph is also dumb? fear is dumb? bubble is dumb? let's just delete everything then. your are getting downvoted cause your comment is stupid
---
Try downloading a ui addon like elvui that changes the portrait to an animated 3d model

---
And they won't leave it on. They can't. It destroys the spirit of Classic. It destroys the game as the phases roll out. So we'll see what happens. But we also don't know the actual server numbers.
---
Probably the best RP PvP character I’ve ever seen
---
Must be nice, having friends that is.
---
As someone else said, in interface you can turn on autoloot.
---
I'd also recommend setting up macros so you auto pickpocket while ambush, garrot, backstab, etc.
---
On Hydraxian Waterlords (EU) you are more likely to get a group as a Hunter than a Priest. That server is comically overpopulated with healers.
---
I only have 2 buttons and then my roller. Roll up is hunter mark/send pet, roll down is pet return, mouse button 1 is auto shot, mouse button 2 is mount.
---
Just assign them to a bar. Activate all bars, and just keep adding til youve used them all
---
Dont just give people water, make them pay for it. The reason why people are doing this is because other mages ARE giving them water when they do it.
---
They're both pretty similar - both classes that you play just to annoy the shit out of people in pvp. It's hard to recommend hunter atm as it's very weak defensively with scatter/trap DR and buggy FD-&gt;trap. You can gank people fine and your niche is ok in BGs with frost trap and viper spam, but in wpvp you're very vurlnerable to ganks and being 2v1'd.  
---
Druid is very fun atm but gets weaker every raid tier that comes out. BWL is okish but into AQ/naxx you basically lose the ability to survive and kill people, you become just a flag running bot.  
---
That's imo anyway, you'll find plenty of people that disagree with me on both accounts.
---
Depends on the class. IIRC, the biggest thing they did was turn your premier spec skill (requires 30 points) into a base skill, and then replaced it with the current and more powerful option. 
---
I played as a druid, and our final talents were Innervate, Hurricane, and they didn't even have a skill for feral before 1.8. We got improved pounce or some bull shit.
---
This is misleading and unhelpful.
---
Most people will not want to bring a shadowpriest in dungeons over any of the main dps classes.
---
attacks dont affect your energy regen though.  It doesnt matter if it's a miss or parry or whatever.  They never are supposed to affect your energy regen.
---
&gt;Mages are the last class who should be providing their benefit as it doesn't improvd your peformance it just saves you money.
---
If you tried to pull that in my groups then I dont care how much damage you deal. I'll kick you straight out and replace you with someone that can be bothered to play as a team.
---
I invited you exactly BECAUSE your class utility saves me money. I'm not going to spend 50-60 of my own vendor water on a dungeon run that you yourself benefit from. Stop being selfish and realize you play with other people.
---
Sure, level up easy without competition then hop to my server and take my raid spot.  No worries.  The guy in your guild that you've been giving all the raid recipes to... no one will miss him if he bounces servers.
---
They move people from high to low to avoid just killing that server.  Maybe they do a server merge with a few low pop servers but letting people pick is a bad idea imo.  Those of us that suffered through the queues because we wanted to avoid low pop servers, fighting to tag mobs, struggling with the economy... just to have a bunch of transfers come in that didn't have to sit in queue for 6 hours a day, that were able to farm and harvest plenty of mats without contention.  Not fair to those that wasted days in queue while you were playing.  Wait for a merge.
---
I mean, when I use the word gank I’m using my association of any type of pvp that’s not tilted in your favor. Like getting picked off at 40% health after killing a mob or like constant groups of horde to where there’s no feasible way you could fight back even if you tried. 
---
There’s still a lot of pvp on heartseeker but I mean that I’m not constantly having to rotate my camera around to watch for people ganking me.
---
Same to you
---
Yeah, 354 60’s online atm
---
What addon are you using for the AH prices?
---
The timing
---
It's mostly personal preference.
---
I like auctioneer, but it has a bunch of other stuff packaged with it as well that's useful if you play the market but not so much if you don't. Not sure if auctionator has such things pre-included. I had to disable 2-3 things in the auctioneer package though just because they don't work yet/aren't relevant to me.
---
rogues need 5-10m cooldowns all up to be able to do that. and knowing how to properly use them, it's the highest skillcap class in the game.
---
just make one and try to replicate that. you are gonna fail :)
---
You lasted that long?
---
This is the mouseover macro i used for all of my healing spells. Replace SPELL with the ones you want to use.
---
#showtooltip
---
/cast [mod:alt,@player] [@mouseover,help,nodead] [help] [@targettarget,help,nodead] [] SPELL
---
Edit: you can set lower rank spells by putting (rank 1 etc...) after SPELL.
---
if you're being a cat to gank people, you can lean heavily on bleeds which aren't ignored.
---
That makes sense why I can't find one then, tyvm
---
Those moonstalker fangs in Darkshore are one of the worst for me so far. If I hadn't had skinning, I would have done it.

Charge with two hander. Get first swing in for massive rage gains. Switch to sword and board.

That one takes FOREVER! And don’t take offense when I don’t group with you just don’t want it to take twice as long

This is hilarious because he did the same to me.
---
Is AV available?  There's your answer.
---
Should have written their names down and posted it on the server  discord.
---
I don't think just ramping up the numbers would hurt the vanilla experience. Make Onyxia simply hit harder and tank more. But I'm no game designer.
---
Ah i remember this guy! Got the idea for the guild in the barrens and then was back recruiting ppl for it lol

[And our wholesome conversation after ;-)](https://i.imgur.com/LB6xPCl.png)
---
People know a great deal better which items are best in slot, which helps a bit alongside what’s been mentioned.
---
I use them for abilities I need on a very short notice, typically in life or death PvP situations... as a warrior, I have 1 button mapped to berserker stance/pummel to stop fears, roots, etc, another to execute so I can finish off enemies in a pinch and the third to hamstring for catching or escaping. My thought is that you can access these keys without sacrificing movement or access to your other abilities, so they should be very important to your survival
---
It's the life of a tank.
---
Don't bother with the predictions. 1k in queue equals roughly half an hour of waiting.
---
Good luck with it! There's some artists pumping out stuff even faster than I can and a few really great artists over there willing to spend hours of their time on a random request so don't take it to heart if you do get lost in the crowd :)
---
&gt; I don’t have the emotional attachment yet to actually pay to have it done
---
This is basically the entire reason I wasted all these years learning to draw instead of just paying someone better. I like my characters, but I'm too much of a tightarse to pay anyone what they're worth :P
---
Grobb !!!
---
Or just '/join lookingforgroup'
---
I am very well aware of the regen bro.. I get it.   
---
My question is, in order for your energy meter to read as an odd number, that comes from having an attack miss or parry and only using a portion of the energy needed for the skill with the remainder being refunded giving the rogue an odd number of energy correct?    
---
I’m not talking about regen, but if the rogue is on an odd number energy such as 19, when the tick goes through, the rogue will be at 39, 59, 79, 99 energy... having an odd number energy is still working as intended when it regens and is still on an odd number.

Likes this 10x better, but why have "the"...i..just don't understand
---
You should add the classic: "wife aggro sry"
---
Maybe that's the difference then. Me getting the 5-point bleeds on them versus not.
---
I'll pay more attention.
---
*but warriors don't get to top dps until they get naxx gear, they're terrible in MC/Ony gear*
---
I'm talking about the numbers.
---
how do you turn on the class colors?
---
Depends if you like constant PvP action or not, I always prefer going to the lower populated faction.
---
Thats wild. I'll fight a rogue my same level and he'll just dodge tank everything I do.   
---
I feel like both specs are glass cannons compared to other melees
---
I'm doing 90% dungeons as well. Decided to stay retri instead of trying reckoning. Did you really level all the way to 60 just by grinding dungeons? Was it fun?
---
Many thx
---
Just whisper the healer and tell them to let the dps die if they pull aggro.
---
Did we expect it to look different than it did 15 years ago?
---
On behalf of warlocks I must apologize, I would like to think this warlock was simply trying to save money and did in fact not have the underwater breathing buff available to them.
---
As a point to note this was an alliance warlock and they are known to be of lesser intelligence then Horde warlocks.
---
Would Chestnutz approve?
---
Haha.
---
Why is this a bad thing? It gives you a reason to set up shop in an area and just relax and grind a bit
---
Why not choose a class that can do either of those? Druids, shaman, and paladins are all fun classes.
---
Damn you got my name!
---
56 mage here looking very much forward to 60! I love the idea of soloing dungeons and am definitely keen to grind some out once I hit 60 (mainly for that juicy epic mount atm). What are some solid dungeons to run for nice gold per hour?
---
Thx!
---
"Dude I'm so high right now" Why do people feel the need to announce this all the time?
---
Thats really cool man, hope people found you
---
The alternative was for me to do the areas where there are spiders.
---
Oh don't be so modest, my friend!
---
No. I got an email from customer support stating that they are not enabling classic access via time vouchers like they do for live- because of the high pop = queues for paying ppl have atm.
---
That was never the intent of Classic. Blizzard has a huge opportunity to go back 15 years and steer the ship a different course after learning from their mistakes over the years.
---
Being an asshole is the best feeling you can have?

no problem

Holy shit that must have been a terrible player. As a Paladin I've killed many warriors way above my level.
---
Well isn't that a bit of a cliffhanger
---
That’s a really cool idea! How many bags did you end up handing out to players?
---
But I'm trustworthy. Yeah glowing Brightwood staff and warden staff both dropped off the same boss! And when I layered back I was robbed of a freezing band!
---
Totally not a problem to reimburse me

Check Atlasloot (addon) for dungeons around your level for cloth waist drops.

and banning isn't one of them :)

More like, "we don't really have the technical capability and the human resources to deal with really rare temporary bugs that can be solved by keeping your bags freer and getting your stuff done before you accept a grp inv"
---
I think 40g is fairly reasonable, you could try to haggle it down with the seller if you’re really stingy but I feel like gold it’s not a lot of gold to be worth worrying about.
---
Why though? 
---
Unless you are some super hardcore guild competing for the top what’s it matter what you bring? 
---
Way I see it, if a group of -30 people (some of which aren’t even level capped) can clear MC. I doubt it matters how many you bring. Granted I know they are top notch people but ya’ll acting like if your group isn’t perfect you are never gonna clear anything. 
---
Shit by that logic why take any ranged dps into MC that isn’t a mage or hunter? And maybe 1 warlock.
---
I don't want anything after classic. Leave it alone.
---
Yea man it's crazy how much more honorable alliance are. As a horde I literally never get engaged by alliance without first receiving a hand delivered note requesting consent for PvP and usually also containing a nice $20 Starbucks gift card as a preemptive apology. But you know all I do as horde is hang out in westfall killing level 15s of course.
---
Unless you dedicate yourself to healing dungeons as a main way to level. Priests benefit the most from the spell cleave meta
---
Nice meme. More like equip 2h, charge, sweeping strike, and go zerker stance with zerker rage and cleave away.
---
Blame healer if you die.
---
This thread is making my head hurt, but I just wanted to somehow bring the pokemon "Shuckle" into this mix.
---
They are hoping the player base thins out. They will not remove layers if the current amount of players is still there. Why? Every server will have ques at all hours of the day.

That's a cat, he's not a dad.

---
You can ask nicely in a ticket suggesting that you have some gold but need to sell some stuff on retail to buy a wow token.
---
They might give you up to 3 days. Every time I've had issues with my subbed account they refuse to give me time, but if they think they're getting a player back they're much more likely to.
---
It's a notable difference but really: a 24 man PUG group took her down. What does  that 8 debuff loss entail? You have to bump it up to 30 people? Maybe 40?
---
At 40 players, that's nearly double the amount of DPS since you'll probably bring 13 dps and 3 healers. Onyxia would melt far beyond what a loss of 8 Debuffs would entail.
---
Any good solo class can do it at 60 very easy (hunter/warlock/druid). Once you get a half decent set of blues any class can kill them without too much trouble.
---
What dumb bullshit logic is this? Half expecting you to threaten to roll need if they don't give you the vendor price on drops lmao
---
apparently this guy makes a habit of this.

This is the way to do it, can start doing emp runs at 55 then move into lowerspire and get geared up while leveling.

She was 20 by the time the game came out?

Divine shield will, blessing of protection might not, it's a poison so not sure.

Wait and sell.

Totally wrong
---
Yea, but Succubus is almost as good for generic PvP (much better versus melee, slightly worse versus casters), so why even waste time getting the felpuppy before you're max level?
---
On the opposite side of the spectrum - some undead priest mind controlled me (gnome warrior) on Fairbanks in STV and gave me fort and healed me. Thanks bud! :)

No one has really ever argued hunters aren't decent phase 1/2.

I did, but it was exceedingly rare. I notice it frequently with druid now

That song released Feb 2003. She was born in 1984. Idk when the video was filmed but going by the song's release date she should have been 19ish.

What a name

Lmao I covered his name for privacy but everyone seems to know him!
---
This isn't actually true as far as I know at least. You do get layered sometimes out of the blue if you're on a layer that is very empty. I've experienced it myself several times when just out of nowhere people start appearing several at the same time all over the place. This is however a rare occurance. And I haven't had any issues with looting or stuff like that. Wouldn't be surprised if there's tech that allows you to bring unlooted corpses with you to the new layer or something similar either.  
---
Would be interesting to read something official regarding this since all I can offer is my own experiences but I rarely use layering to move layers but I've been layered several times still so I am certain there's at least something going on with it.
---
Druid is the better choice.
---
There's a lot of mixing between pub group and pug that people seem to use pug group a lot.
---
If you want cheap stuff, just get eagle gear on the AH.
---
I'm a 43 mage so I can give you some advice.
---
You can look into Red Mageweave Pants / Red Mageweave Gloves, cheap mats (but you may have trouble finding a tailor who can make it, since the pattern is not from the trainer).
---
Dreamweave Gloves/Vest is also good, but more expensive. 
---
For weapons, Illusionary Rod or Hypnotic Blade + decent offhand ( can just buy from the AH if you want, I use Nightsky Orb) is good. The SM graveyard has a good offhand, if I recall.
---
Others: Bloodband Bracers, Southsea Mojo Boots are coming up soon which are pretty good (quest rewards, look them up).
---
For wand, do the mage quest and get that wand.
---
Amulet = Triune Amulet from Cathedral, or an eagle amulet.
---
Shoulders = shoulders from Fairbanks in Cathedral.
---
Druid. Open world and otherwise.
---
What do you use alts for?
---
What an absolute legend
---
No, not until AV comes out.
---
I love this.
---
I mean Jeff Kaplan did work on world of Warcraft.
---
Mind blast doing a lot of threat might be to blame! Im always careful of casting it
---
Yeah it's a bit funny. Tons of warlocks do very well on many fights, depending on the fight they are well ahead of hunters. There's very few fights druids will beat the warlocks.  
---
I think it's just cause there's a lot of 'mediocre' warlocks dragging the avg down, but the 10 druids trying to make dps druid work are really going all out.
---
It's not like the dude/dudette can but treasury bills with the gold. The things he or she would buy to invest would include...this epic. Might as well just hang on to this investment for now.
---
The best play is to hold on to the item until you need its cash value, and then sell. It's an inflating asset. Selling early to put gold in your bags is suboptimal.
---
Or, I guess you can sell it for less to someone smarter, and let them profit from your windfall.
---
Don’t forget dps doing less dmg than tank and needless arguments that gets the group disbanded.
---
Parachute cloak is your friend.

This happened in vanilla.

I'm not sure the point of posting an assumed code fix, when this was already fixed a long time ago, but it wasn't fixed in vanilla.

So as a ret pally my max dps is 1/4 of a warrior ? Glad I wasted 30 levels

Congrats Octobers man!! HUUUUGEE

---
Everyone always rolls need on world epics, backpacks, and scourgestones. 
---
You can negotiate later. But everyone needs a few hundred gold as much as you need more defence. You might decide not to use the shoulders and instead sell them.
---
You can beat a warrior naked as a frostmage... this mage was just shit!
---
If it matters, this happens to me as a Druid in cat form too.
---
No this happens even when all attacks land.
---
There has to be something if they want to retain the returning subs/player base. WoW at its core is a progression game. Many people will go back to retail or quit all together if Classic doesn't have anything beyond it.
---
As a tauren druid. You can sit on a booty bay quest giver and completely block that npc. Trust me I did it for 10 minuts with lots of kills
---
Your username speaks to my soul.
---
Just don't worry.
---
If removing layering will cause big problems, they'll just keep it longer.
---
If they remove layering and pops are insanely high, you take the free xfer or sit and queue and stop complaining
---
Either way it's a better-than-vanilla experience, as transfers didn't come available for a lot longer and realms were relatively dead
---
Fair enough
---
&gt;Shit by that logic why take any ranged dps into MC that isn’t a mage or hunter? And maybe 1 warlock.
---
Because if you gear up 10 hunters and 1 warlock your raid will be terrible in AQ/Naxx.
---
I’m a super casual player.  I played a feral Druid tank for a long time in vanilla.  To me, the worst part about tanking is always being expected to lead the group through a dungeon. Everyone expects the tank to know the entire dungeon and all the fights.  It can be very stressful to a new tank.
---
wpvp is so much fun
---
The dungeon reset one is also super useful if you are running the same dungeon over and over, strat dead for example.
---
For TL;DW people we don't know what mailbox thing it's talking about, though I guess it's reloading to get the mails over 50 faster?

Yeah it's called hitting "v" on your keyboard...
---
The whole game should be fury dps + tanks + healers. Just warriors and people who support warriors. Who needs anything other than top DPS
---
Needing on BoE epics is the standard, it's to stop people from ninja looting, the shoulder's you're talking about are called Stockade Pauldrons, they can easily be worth up to 300g on some realms. Imagine if 4 of you roll greed and the 5th guy rolls need, he just easily ninja'd 300g. Better to be safe then sorry and all roll need.
---
Dude - for most things I say “to each his own” but Druid aquatic form is objectively useful - you spend enough of your time in the game under water to warrant doing that lengthy quest, imo.
---
This whole meme of “we were just bad back then” is really tired.  Fact is 1.12 is hugely nerfed from the actual game back in 1.1 at launch time.
---
I'm pretty sure lorewise most of the undead don't give a fuck about the rest of the Horde. IIRC Undead start off with the lowest reputation with other races/other races have Undead as their lowest rep in the beginning. It's pretty cool honestly.

This is where mages and warlocks come into play. I hate bottle necking classes, but mages and warlocks are so incredible here. As a tank theres only so much you can do, I prefer to get out the 2 hander and whirlwind and cleave if there is no elite around - your warlock will usually pull aggro, so it's up to your healer. Also LoS is your friend here, use every pillar and corner you can to bunch them up
---
*A shit ton of elite quests have joined the party.*
---
Not a meme for end-game dungeons and is way better at holding AoE threat than warriors and druids. The mitigation is definitely lacking when it comes to tanking raid bosses though.
---
nah thats not that huge.    
---
The bigger difference its the fps, back then i remember tanking Vanilla looking at the floor the entire time.  
---
Also, the mechanics are extremely simple, if you played retail in the last years, Ragnaros and Onyxia mechanics are nothing.     
---
And you know what? thats ok, because Vanilla wasnt hard, it was fun.
---
It’s ok, it’s kinda the same as PIN number.
---
They're supposed to be tiny islands. Blizzard made them continent sized for some reason.
---
I mean that at least makes lore sense. He's constantly telling you to send him back and hates being on this plane, of course he'll try to fuck with you when given the chance
---
Call me crazy, but I wouldn’t want freebees while leveling my first character. For me it’s partly about earning everything myself and doing well in the economy. Eventually that diminishes, but in the early stage of Classic it would ruin my drive.
---
Is Resto druid decent PvP-wise, or better to run Priest/Pally for that?
---
The recipe is tradeable so the same principle applies. 
---
Though again I would advise communication.
---
ITT: People Un-Ironically Using the Ready Check
---
They should let you wear pants under armor.
---
The one i've seen in my post 50 dungeons always pulls threat because of the healing they do, but when they somehow didn't pull threat the tank was more or less unkillable even without the healer
---
Yeah. No one wants to play a stagnant MMO.
---
I don’t think Blizzard should be afraid of people seeing all the content of a patch. But I *do* think that no future content or phases at all is a mistake.
---
I think the folks that don’t want changes are afraid of being behind the curve. But that’s just not really true, everyone has their own pace. The most dedicated players are usually the most vocal so they see everyone talking about downing raids and visualizing the future of Classic and they feel left out? Idk
---
How is it any better for threat when the boss is beating the living shit out of you either way and you can HS every attack?
---
Well done. :)
---
Lol thanks guys that's each a different answer, are any of you actually in Alaska ?
---
Damn I mained a Druid in classic and I do not remember us ruling most BGs.. damn
---
Ahh fair, yeah I definitely do get the 2H WW, like you might as well. So you wouldnt really try shackling and going dps 1 by 1 then?
---
What is Morgraine faction balance like? 
---
Not a fan of the balance on NoggenFogger right now so considering switching.
---
Original patch 1.12 I had top damage the day after I dinged 60 and I was in quest blues and greens. MC had been on farm for months. The people in my guild were not optimized, badly geared, bad talent specs, bad at boss mechanics, and most played in a slide show because their pc/internet couldn’t handle raids. There were rooms in BWL where 10 people would continually DC unless they stared at the walls.
---
I came from a top guild in Everquest for years and already knew the best dps rotation, stats, and quickly learned the simple boss mechanics.
---
Now going through this again 1.12 specs, better computers, better internet connections, better specs, simplistic boss mechanics, 15 years later we are just way better players in a better environment.
---
Mobs that are actually a threat. Weird
---
Probably the 20th post with a cat on their desk. Retards still posting and upvoting this
---
Pretty sure theirs a rando building in tanaris where you can swap but wether that was Added later or not i have no idea.
---
God no, tanks are so rare. It has to do with simply how terrible warrior leveling is.
---
That and everyone knew going in fury war is the best dps by leagues so no one wants to tank
---
Yea you’re right. I decided to go no shirt to just complete the look.
---
I think I activated it once while trying to set FFA loot, thought "that's handy" and then completely forgot about its existence again until I read this comment.
---
I can't say it myself as I didn't play the game myself, but I know couple people that played and they are saying that with 1.12 talents naked casters are doing more damage than fully decked casters back on patches when MC was progressed.
---
What kinda people are you guys playing with? I have literally never encountered people refusing to give water and petty stuff like that. Worst I've encountered was a guy in our dungeon group (rightfully) asking for an underleveled DPS to be kicked because we wiped 3 times.
---
I marcroed raid mark skull to my bars and it has made my tanking life so much easier. I just mark the next kill target and we go. 
---
Now all I have to do is avoid grouping with mages who can’t not aoe 2 seconds into a pullmwith 2+ mobs and we are set.
---
Problem is 1.12 isn’t 15 years - it’s more like 12 years.  The content was nerfed to the ground in this version.  It’s a real shame they couldn’t plug in the numbers from 1.1 instead so things were a lot harder.
---
I was annoyed with having a mic and not being able to use it - had to buy it 😄
---
Does your job not offer vacation days? Also, I don't know how many hours you're working, but the usual 9-5 easily allows for 5 hours of gaming per day, and then there's also weekends where you can easily put in 10 hours per day.
---
also the fps.  
---
Tanking in Vanilla was a looking at the floor simulator.
---
That’s maybe worse than the defias ones, I’m on the one with the highwaymen. :’)

---
I don’t disagree that priest dps isn’t lacking compared to others. But this thought that people have that you can’t be successful if you take more than one is silly. 
---
I’m not saying take 5 shadows but the difference between 1-2 maybe even a 3rd  is gonna be very small. 
---
Which goes back to unless your guild is actively trying to be the top. The blacklist on classes because they aren’t meta is fucking stupid.
---
Shadow Priest can do fine, but from a play style perspective I found them not very engaging or fun in PvE compared to a Mage.
---
If you enjoy it though then go for it, I used to raid heal as shadow spec all the time when we were short on healers. You don't need to be Holy spec to heal, gear matters far more.
---
I’m sure whatever they do post classic - it’l be optional so people who want to stay in classic can.
---
A &lt;Seasoned&gt; PUG on Kirtonos got one last night.
---
I need to make a horde and revisit based Orgrimmar again.
---
Probably misguided vengeance, this is my first time playing Paladin in classic and its been an eye-opening experience, I had no clue that Paladin's were so defenseless in Wpvp, we're really not much of a threat unless we're in a group.
---
It eventually got to a point where I decided to respec to make my build a bit less PvE focused and its made a huge difference. I still can't kill anyone, but they can't kill me either unless they're a higher level or bring friends.

---
Alright, I'll make it simple for you, since my previous post probably contained too many words.

Imagine EVERYONE runs this strategy, not just a handful of dedicated groups.
---
Try being a Rogue in this environment and getting turned away by EVERY dungeon group because they don't need your kind. WTF do you do? How would you feel about that?

What part of this scenario is an asinine excuse? Explain.

Putrid...claws....

There was but Blizzard stated they didn't like it so it might have been broken by now. The LFG channel is probably the best though.

Found the mage.

It’s actually a lot easier when you treat them like children as well.

I literally had someone say “hey, why don’t we do it that way” and I said “we could, but we are doing it this way” they shut up for the rest of the run and we had no problems.

While true, it's not the same leveling pain as warriors.  Which is what the deleted post stated.
---
There is mouseover functionality in macros, so if you can figure out how to do that I’m sure it would work. I don’t know
---
The irony here is Horde races are far more likely to be dirty.
---
Talk shit on alliance "lol"
---
Talk shit  on horde "wow u salty much"
---
It's a videogame sit down and have fun ya neet
---
Not NA first
---
Eye is useless without the hammer
---
You are not good at the game because you got a drop
---
Not only that, he brought a very low level character across the world (probably dying many times on the way) in order to do so.
---
It feels boring. I die easier. Other classes seem more fun. If I get caught on a mob in pvp I die instantly. Maybe I just haven't experienced my full aoe potential
---
What are you talking about? We agree that vanilla content is faceroll right? We agree that rotations for all classes is faceroll right? Then there must be some sort of reason as of why back then it took people way longer to clear certain encounters. And playing on older patches is one of these reasons.   
---
No1 is saying that content is hard, but that it is way easier right now than it was back in vanilla.
---
&gt; Raids? If you can get that one shadow priest slot I'm sure you'll be happy, but it's quite a commitment taking a class all the way to 60 hoping that you'll find yourself in that situation. You could very easily just find disappointment.
---
No point in bringing a shadow priest when one of your priests can go disc / holy and then go down the shadow tree for the debuff.
---
ATM machine
---
/auc getall does it all in less than 30 seconds
---
Pallys are great end game healers and have an easy, but slow, leveling path as ret. If you keep heal gear in your bag you can also heal 5 mans most of the way to 60. I imagine shaman has a similar path if you want to go horde side.
---
As a classic bear tank I always appreciate mage water. Just rebuffing MOTW or tossing dearie fire makes me OOM.
---
Yeye, got it man! thank you ;)
---
Saw post below, looks like it was changed pre-1.12. Appreciate the feedback.
---
The host guild ninjad it. Nothing was on reserve. 
---

---
That's only going to give you results for lvl 60. OP mentioned it for his leveling, which is a much more complex question.
---
I mean for buffs I usually do. But for heals, if you are healer, you should probably heal the group, as it's literally your role. My role is DPS, not vending machine.
---
Auctionator is great if all you want to do is buy the cheapest items, or sell your items quickly.  The market scan  also only takes \~10 seconds to execute.
---
problem is that warrior need a lot of good gear that isn't accessible right now. Sure, they are better when in full T3, but that's like 0,0000001% of the warrior's population.
---
If we take that in account to make a summary of a class, then survival hunter is by far the best hunter spec because they become absolutely godly with end game gear.
---
Oh. I don't have a problem with using them.
---
That's hot. Is your boyfriend single?
---
Priest/pally is much better.
---
I took the enchant, but I got all of it in my shield arm only.
---
Wait is this deviate delight?
---
You have to stand still when pickpocketing and for a second afterwards, or else the autoloot won't kick in for some reason.
---
Yep 100% not what I was expecting.
---
77 runs deep and I haven't even seen the orc in ~15 runs.  Go fuck yourself.
---
Since this is your first time I’d pick double-gathering professions for quick moneymakers or even just to horde in your bank until you find a profession to switch to and drop the other one. Like Herb/Skinning but than you find that you want to get into leathermaking game you can drop herbalism and pickup leather. You can use all that leather you made to level it up and make a profit while also selling all the herbs you gathered for additional profit... since there isn’t much reason to rush your processing profession until you’re high enough level or able to afford it.
---
If DPS pulls aggro, they die (cast Regen on them, only heal if tank definitely doesn't need heal)
---
If people start fights when you are drinking, they die
---
They'll learn eventually
---
Anyone have resources on BiS gear for elemental shaman re-spec at 40? I want to start prepping for it.
---
&gt;	dps warriors both weren’t a thing at all last time MC was current content
---
Yeah, they were. They may not have known the optimal BiS gear and talents but warriors dps’d when MC was end game, any many of them even wore mail and leather if the stats were good.
---
This sounds interesting, is there anywhere I can see it read up on what this entails? For example, I’m a lock, what is my job in the team, etc
---
Thank you so much for the kind words :) 
---
I uploaded all my addons in a folder if you want to download it.
---
https://github.com/Steingalen1337/Addons-Finished
---
You could try playing a class that doesn't suck
---
zero Onyxia changes lol. it's just the talents being changed.
---
I've really been feeling scattered as a warrior tank in AoE groups since the demo shout fix.  I've honestly been looking for more single target groups just because they tanking is more enjoyable.
---
On my warlock i died on onyxia EVERY single time.  Not a single run i ever lived through.  Always took aggro, so i just ran to the tank spot everytime she was gonna land so i could die near where the tank wanted her.
---
Pretty sure they have a toggle-able option to split it all into regular bags, I remember doing it back in legion?
---
If your goal is to be the best, then you made the right choice. I used to feel this way with MMO's as well.
---
Nowadays, I have way more obligations in life and I find myself not caring if I'm stronger than anyone else. I just want to explore, kill some shit, and make some good friends along the way.
---
Well there is your answer than
---
That feeling and the 5 bars of exp you get for it.
---
Unrealistic because not a mafia of opposite faction ganking you while their other half in your faction watch.
---
Because he clicked the button to accept the party. In what crazy world is that not *at least* a few percent points of blame?
---
I used to fall asleep in MC. I was a holy priest. Falling asleep could be a square.
---
Warrior dos is complex with no real rotation and is some of the most fun you can have raiding in vanilla. Spamming 1 button is really just a mage thing.
---
NOT WHEN I'M DONE WITH THEM
---
Are you retarded? Doing air squats and pushups will not fuck you up. You do not work out regularly, quit lying on the internet you doughy bitch
---
Not on classic it's not built in
---
Not only iron nerves but also the perfect timing and the enormous coincidence of the guy recording it. Amazingly hilarious
---
I wonder if blizzard has gone the way of esea and various other launchers and started crypto mining in the background lol.
---
You forgot "people kicking or ignoring you for being sub-60 for BRD or LBRS".
---
At lv 51 you can have anger management and 31 points in prot.... so....
---
Boars without intestines?
---
Or when they ask for food/water you give it to them for free (which I usually do, only take tips when they do it themselves) and they cancel trade and say “don’t want low lvl water/food” like ok dude you asked not me.
---
It took it off me lol
---
Neat plates is an add on that does it as well. But that replaces name plates as well.
---
They work for me.
---
S a t y r

---
Was doing this earlier.  Interestingly I got the best drop rate from the Syndicate folks, while it seemed to me it was more designed as a quest to go alongside the Battle for Hillsbrad questline.
---
This is RP-PVP Zandalar Tribe. The idea I get is even when the majority really doesn't roleplay, the general population seems more friendly.
---
This is undermined a bit because of all the server queues causing everyone to just go anywhere without a queue though :)
---
I felt the “dude i’m so high right now”
---
Kargoz and Madseason both have great guides that will give you an idea of whats gonna be your leveling experience and what it's gonna be like when you are maxed out. 
---
I don't think you should pick a class based on being the most optimal because lets be honest.. you will never raid Naxx.  Just forget about it. People in full blue are downing Onyxia with 24/40 party member and Ragnaros was killed after 5 day by a bunch of gnome.
---
Right now I kinda regret listenning to the meta because I realise I could've easily played any class of any spec and have a spot in a casual raid.
---
From your previous comments my analysis would say you should roll Ret Paladin for Leveling and Hybrid Prot/Holy for 50+.
---
Let me tell you why....   
---
1. You will be able to tank any 5 man dungeon easy.  Paladin have insane aoe treat and wear plate  
---
2. You will be able to heal or off heal for most content.  
---
3. You will be beefy and have insane substain  
---
4. You will be a pvp god.  
---
5. You might be asked to offtank group of trash in dungeon and even raids if you are good enough.
---
If at any point you end up summoning your inner geek to go for that hardcore late content you willl be able to respec Holy and be a very good healer.
---
Not sure how skilled they were since I don't play shadow priest myself. Also not sure why people downvote when nothing I said was opinion based, simply stats.
---
I tend to only look at total damage/DPS in dungeons because the clear speed is what matters. Bosses are simply too easy to care about who is top DPS. Most overall damage is the winner.
---
Just face tank the mages. Or since I'm horde. Grounding totems out the ass plus priest bubble.
---
In retail i had things like intterupts and speed boosts/gap closers bound to my mouse buttons. I'd say whatever skill you feel that needs to be hit the fastest and with most ease.
---
Wait why cannot I put dots on bosses?
---
I wondered this myself
---
I went priest. But my idea is to go shadow then re spec to holy for heals when's I'm 60. Is that a good strategy?
---
This is actually their most powerful move
---
Not enough tbagging
---
Additions/changes:
---
Warrior: 
---
Best single target DPS in the game.
---
Mages:
---
Pretty mediocre single target DPS. If we only look at sustained raid DPS (ignoring dungeons where warlocks outperform) they are outpaced by rogues and warriors by a chunky margin.
---
Likewise they don't have the best CC, that likely goes to warlocks and shadow priests. The fact that they can deal damage while hard CCing an opponent is pretty crazy.
---
They are undeniably the best class in the game at what they do, but they aren't perfect. Notably warlocks clean their clock in pvp.
---
Warlock:
---
Their utility is better than "some", it's very unique and convenient. You forgot they're pvp gods as well.
---
Hunter:
---
Forgot their solo pve godhood at max level. I'm assuming pve while leveling is being discounted, but they're also pretty amazing at that.
---
Rogue:
---
Second best pve single target damage. Very good at pvp not necessarily due to being a godly class, but for their CC and disengages. If you can't easily clense poison, rogues aren't fun to deal with. And they are bar none the most powerful gank class.
---
Paladins:
---
"average to below average at everything else" is a bit overselling this class. They are good at all types of healing and some pvp shenanigans that's about it.
---
Shamans:
---
PvP burst class with low defenses. But if they get the jump on you enjoy that. Their healing in 5 man content is a bit weak, but their utility is very high compared to other healer types. That utility makes them a highly demanded, horde like up to 8 shamans per raid compared to 2 paladins.
---
Druids:
---
Great raid healers (innervate), mediocre 5 man healers (lack of spam res), unique pvp due to their hilarious survivability. Decent tanks given some effort put into gearing them.
---
If you're interested in name for name, I will give you Gfg, Kief, Padre, or Token for the name Smith on Earthfury.
---
Animals aren't filthy in nature. People were filthy before plagues made us take hygiene seriously.
---
&gt;Shamans - average to below average at everything
---
yeah tell that to shammy who will 2 shot you
---
&gt;Hunter - low level pvp gods
---
gods also in high lvl pvp problem is they are VERY hard class to play correctly, they are easy to learn and hard to master
---
&gt;Mage - best single target dps
---
nop. rogue and warrior would like to talk
---
&gt;Warrior
---
pvp god tear (geared)
---
&gt;Rogue - decent gankers
---
best gankers, high dps in pve, god tier pvp
---
&gt;Warrior - the only endgame tank
---
some druids would like to talk
---
Nah, they are all stolen by Tauren Rogues.
---
I'm sure you can do it in a warrior in some way, but it's not the meta. I've been doing variants of lock, mage, priest and hunter. 4man worked nice and think 3man can even work if mage is good
---
But u can buy gold without risking the ban, there are methods which are totally not suspicious. Been doing it for 10 years now. Have never been banned. So sorry, ill just put in 1 hr of Real work to buy the amount of gold that takes u 1 day to grind. The time i got left ill just spend happily doing fun stuff :D
---
This is what a lot of people are starting to run into as they hit the 40s as well. It's fun grouping up for slay quests and unique mob quests for efficiency, but you need to stay and grind there because you are expected to get 12/12 mobs of full exp not 1/5th of 12 mobs exp. Otherwise you end up behind a pretty significant chunk of exp sometimes. Another spot you saw it a lot in the beginning was the early 20s, as people were missing huge chunks of exp from grouping for all those gnoll slay quests.
---
Aged Gorilla Sinew.
---
What do you want to do in game if they just stop after Naxx release?
---
Yep it's fun to play for sure.
---
Hey that's on the server I play on. Cool beans.
---
They did all that stuff when they implemented it in the first place. They've got nothing left to preserve as far as the spirit of the social climate is concerned. The fact that they used sharding technology in Classic tells you that they are more comfortable with it than with responsible population management.
---
Huh, I've always used %n
---
&lt;3
---
Wing clip + jump shot until pet gets aggro again or kite until the mob is dead
---
You can't explain things like "Tufts of fur", or "blood" with that though. And sometimes the quests like to say "pristine &lt;body part&gt;" when they want to denote a low drop rate item. The barrens quests don't make sense at all.
---
They should.
---
It’s really nice when you get the generosity tip, had a dude ask me to port him and I said sure how’s 30s sound and he tipped me 1g! Thank u good buddy!
---
It is annoying .. wanting 12 hooves but really taking 85 kills to get them. If 85 is what you want .. just make the quest - kill 85 zhevras!!! FML lolz
---
I’ve had a 100% drop rate
---
I’m alliance on kirtonos and I’ve been debating transferring due to the lack of faction balance. Some days I can’t even quest because there is so much horde. Did you transfer from kirtonos?
---
Ele/Resto Shaman build.
---
Paladins only need 20 points to heal so 21/0/30 build works if you don't mind keeping two sets of gear. 
---
Heart of the Wild healing spec exists allowing Druids to heal as mostly Feral.
---
It's doable with all these classes.
---
you move on WASD (or QWE). you will never be able to hit the key "=" as fast as you would be able to hit the key "R". especially on abilities you gotta do it fast (like iceblock) 
---
id recommend reading this https://www.wowhead.com/guide=875/the-art-of-effective-keybinding
---
How do you suggest to fix it?  Considering to this day most retail servers are horde based
---
&gt;does that sound like the Classic experience?
---
Yes, yes it does.
---
The Silencer is the better gun for sure.
---
Ok, check out this list of top 100 overall parses from MC. How many warlocks and how many druids are there?
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/rankings/1000#class=DPS&amp;boss=-1
---
The data says warlocks are far better at the top end then druids currently.
---
I dont aggree, games and hacking just became more competitive. Idk how people get hacked. They probably deserved it.
---
I'd sooner have 100 monsters to kill to retrieve 10 brains if they are readily available over having to kill 30 monsters for 10 brains but they are long spawn times, scattered all over the zone, and overall the spawns couldn't support 1 player doing the quest let alone the 5+ that are competing for it right now. That describes my experience with most quests 45-50 right now.
---
Don't need to be an RP server. I have a 100% success rate of handing people alcohol on ships and asking them to dance for me on a PVP server.
---
I transferred from Kirtonos, yes. This server is huge! I’m going to take a screenshot soon and post
---
Its resto. Your guild needs resto
---
Was thinking pvp
---
Clearly you're just too good. Perhaps you're better suited for retail
---
Devilsaur
---
also druids the best flag carryers
---
Go back to retail scrub! /s
---
You could, but that is a strategy for someone with patience, which I sadly lack :p
---
I just tried, sadly it didn't work for me.
---
