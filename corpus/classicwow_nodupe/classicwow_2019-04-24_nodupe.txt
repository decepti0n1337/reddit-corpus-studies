Legion is easily better than anything past wotlk.
---
---
---
Well, that‚Äôs kinda my argument for expansion to classic after the content has run its course for the purists. I enjoy the gameplay and social mechanics of vanilla and I want that to be preserved but I also eventually would like to see more content added to classic.
---
No, I'll be playing PvP (hopefully with an RP prefix, but I digress). IIRC, though, your characters aren't autoflagged even there until you enter a contested zone.
---

---
Of course, I could be mistaken about that. It's been 10 years since I last played.
---
When the server names come out can you PM me the one you pick so I dont accidentally play there
---
I never played Vanilla but dominated in BC as a lock. Why would this be the case? I could just dot everyone one and put insane damage out in BG's. Rarely was i out damaged.
---
I highly recommend it. Plus then you get to engage in the refined gentleman's sport of [Real Druid PvP] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klm2Q7xu_d4).
---
Youtube c@ cucker series from finalflash, decent boomie.
---
Your leading point of your post is that trying to make different specs viable was the start of WoW's decline, and that's why we should avoid making that same mistake.    
---
    
---
My point was that TBC showed that your point is wrong. Sorry I didn't realise this was so confusing.
---
"You got any friends, kid?"
---
Me: "No, why?"
---
&gt; Does it matter?
---
That's what I'm asking you. Why do *you* care? I'm using whatever assistance I can get in order to get the shit done quicker, I don't play for the questing.
---
In that case, public polls would give you the latter, but you risk losing the former, as subscribers could vote in a mechanism like group finder.. No free lunch I guess.
---
I need it to keep track of where I left off. I‚Äôve done all the quests before so I really don‚Äôt need to take extra time to figure out where exactly ‚Äú northeast from the farm‚Äù is.
---
What if it‚Äôs just a hoax, there is no classic wow? What then?
---
Mass suicide.
---
I don't care. It's just that levelling is a major part of vanilla and I don't see the point in rushing through that as fast as possible. I guess some people just always want to be ahead of other people.
---
Well I for one appreciate the in depth analysis. I‚Äôll be saving this to read again when I roll my hunter come launch. Thanks for the info.
---
This is how I felt when I got invited to my guild's newly forming mythic raid group...I was kind of flattered that they think I'm good enough since they handpicked 20 people out of 5 raid teams, but I was also like "then I'd have to play this one more night a week instead of playing vanilla on a private server..."
---
It does?
---
Yep because my opinion is going to make Blizzard change anything. Same to you though. You seem like a terrible person to be around in WoW and real life üòÇ
---
Sure, if you have some knowledge of questing in WoW, and the obscure items for the quests etc. 
---
There will be Thousands of totally new players who are going to be stuck.
---
Just go what you think might be fun.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
If you like the idea of Engineering, pick it &amp; maybe Mining (Engineering needs a lot of metal bars, and is difficult/expensive if you don't mine them yourself.)
---
When you're more experienced, if you feel you really need 1 piece of cloth gear from Tailoring, drop Mining then &amp; start Tailoring.
---
I'm going to go Enchanting/Engineering &amp; just fuck my gold right up.
---
It's northeast from the farm.
---
No I mean a way to filter out the image macros
---
No. Absolutely fucking no tokens or any sanctioned currency purchases. It absolutely destroyed the economy in retail and I don‚Äôt want that garbage in Classic. The gold sellers didn‚Äôt have nearly as big an impact as the WoW Token did.
---
I'd say if you're new using Questie is even more pointless. You're denying yourself the experience of figuring shit out yourself. I don't remember Questie being a big thing in actual vanilla, we just figured that shit out and sometimes worked together with others to do so. Sometimes we'd look something up on Thottbot.
---
Then you refresh this reddit without reading any of the content.
---
I have seen *literally* every single day, some form of this question being posted.
---
I think Blizzard could exercise some discretion as to what won‚Äôt on the table for voting as it would deteriorate the feel of classic.
---
Don't know this bullshit got upvoted, how retarded can you be to believe that that's normal wage
---
Yeah but if I log out in the middle of that quest and then log in again a week later I don‚Äôt think I should have to re-read the quest just to figure out how to maximize my playtime.  
---
Even with Questie its still fun to visualize the route you are going to take and choose the order which you will run your quests.
---
Basically like most people said don't judge warlock too much while leveling. Most spell damage classes get much better at 60 when they get their hands on some decent gear and have access to more spell power. Warlocks become literal gods as their endgame gear progresses, The further through content you get the more damage you will start to do, Spell power scales very nicely as Classic content progresses, so if you stick things out with a warlock you will be pretty happy with things in endgame!
---
Again... That's not everyone's preference. These will be Retail players who are used to spending 38 hours on an Expac release leveling to max.
---
 
---
Hey everyone, we‚Äôre looking for more members,  we‚Äôre going to go Alliance on a PvP server, obviously Oceanic servers if  we get them. The ultimate goal is 40 man raids and PvP so class balance  matters but we are not going to tell anyone what they have to play.
---
With our raiding we‚Äôre not going to be some hardcore guild aiming for  server firsts or raiding every night, probably 2-3 nights a week and  these nights and times will be decided upon what is best for the  majority. People have jobs, families, social lives etc so we aren‚Äôt  about to crack it if someone cant make every raid. Raid loot will  probably end up DKP, it seems to be the fairest option. Other options  can of course be looked at.
---
PvP is also something that a fair few of us enjoy and have had some  success at in Vanilla and various expansions. So we will be looking at  doing regular premade groups.
---
Regarding Officer/ Recruitment positions etc within the guild these  are all up for grabs.
---
As for the Guild name this will be voted on in the coming weeks.
---
Come check us out on discord if you‚Äôre keen or add me on battlenet eds#1563

Why do you wanna maximize your playtime? If you're taking a week long break you're not in a hurry to get to 60
---
I bet they had a fucking awesome day.
---
The time it took you to say that could‚Äôve been spent scrolling down another 30 posts in ‚Äúnew.‚Äù
---
Instead you have to come flex your e-peen to garner some sort of self satisfaction that you lack in real life. Carry on.
---
That‚Äôs precisely the reason I *need* to maximize my playtime. Because it is so limited.
---
And they'll also be used to getting welfare epics, free gear handouts, and LFR. I'd say if you're coming off retail, drop everything you were used to. We're gonna see a lot of people trying out vanilla for the first time and I think we're going to see 90% of them drop off in the first couple of weeks.
---
And then he stealth's and you have to worry for your life.  
---
\*hears wooshing stealth sound as you run by\*

"Guess ill just die"
---
Some of them because they still looking for Mankriks Wife in Barrens without Questie.
---
I guess there are some cases of that.  But in a general sense, you can watch for hours and not see any of that.  It's more like just paying attention to the right place in such a video at the right time, but it's like the lotto: You might be watching a 2 hour video that has nothing you don't already know.
---
I do get watching some - like I've watched boss fight videos before to learn "the dance" for that boss in WoW or FFXIV - but that's more "work" less "play" to me.  It's not doing it because I "enjoy" it, it's getting the mechanics so I can go do it myself.
---
getting a g600 has helped my carpal tunnel heaps.
---
I have no friends, all ready to go!
---
the thing is, pvp prebis lists are much harder to make, because stat prio for pvp is varying so much and its much more situational.
---
He's talking about a number of things...
---
Towards the end he's talking about weaving melee strikes into a hunter's ranged dps rotation. It's possible to increase your DPS by doing this but it exposes you to mechanics that ranged classes normally avoid and in practice the dps increase isn't that great. Most people elect not to do it.
---
Definitely understand what you are saying. I think it comes down to playstyle and why you choose to play Classic WoW. I didn't use questie or any addons back in the day, but I never read the quests besides the basic objective portion, and I would constantly tab out to thotbot to tell me what to do. Some people really like the questing and leveling process but others just treat questing like a to do list and want to quickly and efficiently check off the quests and move through the zones.
---
So what you're saying is you're paying a premium for people to play your games for you.
---
Trade chat must be fun.
---
This meme is mostly bullshit. Our guild did it, other guilds on the server did it. I gave up my geared mage to play a druid in aq. Playing a hybrid is like tanking, sometimes it feels great but most the time it's just sorting other people's stupid shit.

I don't know about the last one.
---
I dunno if this is accurate. Needs less cowbell. And clownshoes.
---
If you never EVER want to tank and you just want to focus on DPS I would go rogue. If you want to play around cooldowns and be a sneaky guy play rogue. 
---
If you like group play roll a warrior. If you like to dps but at times tank go warrior. If you tend to group up play warrior. 
---
Hope that helps. In the end both are melee damage roles. The biggest difference is rogue can play in a solo enviornment better than a warrior. Warriors are better in group situations in both PvE and PvP so you have to want to play with a group, and often times take control/lead.
---
2 years after release in just about to reach 60 I bet.
---
I want to make a crack about you not being old enough, but I suppose it's equally possible you just don't suck at reckoning age.
---
I worked at a community college for 12 years. Toward the end of my tenure there I noticed the incoming freshmen started looking younger every year. By the time i left I was pretty sure the college was admitting 12 year olds.
---
That's what I tell myself, anyway. Better that than admitting I'm just getting old and every person under 25 looks like a child to me.

Raid/PVP. I'm leaning towards tank or healer for my main.

I have played WoW off and on since vanilla, raided with some top guilds through Wotlk. I am looking for a guild who will be rolling on a popular server. I am open to classes but am leaning towards warrior, priest, or shaman, but leaning mostly towards warrior to tank. 
---
Send me a DM here and we can go from there.
---
Forget the time, Eventually the content will have been on farm for a majority of people/guilds, alts included. What then?
---
The fact they are keeping any dates is really ruining people‚Äôs ability to request time off especially during summer months.. I know for myself being in the navy it will be difficult if it‚Äôs not months in advance! Gonna be so worth all the years waiting though!
---
As much as people on this sub will hate it I expect tokens in classic. Blizzard doesn't want to police the black market especially when they are cutting support positions. Blizzard has no incentive to pay people to hand out bans to paying subscribers when they can instead generate extra revenue with a token system they know is profitable. Even if they don't add tokens to classic, since classic and retail share a subscription, players could just trade classic gold for retail gold to buy game time.
---
For me, vanilla isnt about the questing difficulty of not knowing where to go and having to read on the quest where to go. 
---
Vanilla questing is good because when a mob is orange in level, its hard to kill. If a mob is red, very hard and ?? mobs are impossible. You need to eat almost after every fight as some classes. 
---
You get some new shiny gear? You have it for a few levels and it feels amazing. And if you die? You gotta run a very long time to respawn. So to level fast you got to avoid risks. Questie and other quest helping addons doesnt really make the game alot more easy. Besides, you can explore the world with and without questie. But each to their own i guess.
---
The cast that never comes.
---
you dont need to be in resto to heal but u need to have offset gear with int
---
1 use is only 30 seconds. I highly doubt a feral druid only needs 1 charge per boss.

SL warlock shits on rogue
---
1) I play on pvp servers, you cant complain about being ganked because thats what pvp servers are meant for

2) 'stream sniping' isn't against the Code of Conduct or End User Licensing Agreement
---
3) this means all streamers are fair game.
---
Can windfury attacks proc on hit weapon effects such as sulfuras
---
Play on a private server for free.
---
PvE you basically spam downranked heals. Most healers play somewhat similar in Vanilla, some are just better than others - you will be lowest in terms of healing on a druid but you bring MOTW, innervate, and Brez. 
---
PvP as a pally you are dispelling/healing/buffing as a priest its a lot of offensive dispels/healing/mana burns/fears and as a druid you spot heal/peel/spin nodes/enable group members.
---
Yeah, that was everyone who was bad in vanilla wow.  DPS by group is a good metric that would encourage better overall play. "wee don haev enuf shaman to windfury and manatide heals and dps so widnfury! and fuck ever1 else!!!"  Meanwhile windfury's like 4% of their dps.  oohh 800 deeps to 832! new record!!
---
Dear God, why would you do that? I think that counts as a crime against humanity.
---
Yep, I use it to find those quests off the beaten trail after I've finished all the usuals. It's great for that.
---
Because it's a joke.
---
Damn you missed out, San Andrea's was my foundation for a teen at the time.
---
I've checked the Code of Conduct and the End User Licensing Agreement. There is no mention of this being a violation. It could be considered as harassment but i would have to be doing it constantly and honestly i wont be cause i still want to do my own stuff on that game. But when I'm bored or have some extra free time hunting season is on.
---
Nah, that used to be worthwhile. 40 people groups filled with a much wider variety of people from 13 year olds to keyboard turners. So many priests would roll into raid with shadow spec and knock off more important dots. No one wants to spend 3 hours wiping on rag because people lied about their talents.
---
Nice

‚ÄúNo, no; I‚Äôm an Armorsmith. Just completed the quest and everything.‚Äù

Yes. Often the powerful procs have internal cooldowns making 'proc stacking' pointless though.

I dunno.  I never was much for min-maxing.  I figure Dwarven Priests or Paladins would be seen by Gnomes as being competent healers.  Also: Fear Ward: (7:20-8:30ish)

You‚Äôre pretty gank resistant at high levels. When you are leveling pre-death coil, and have a VW out for leveling, making sure you go straight afflic early can help, so you get curse of exhaust and siphon life as soon as possible. And with a voidwalker sacrifice/hearthstone/soulstone, you have some tools to fight back. Near instant pet summon helps too but you have to go 17 points, not 11, so it‚Äôs not worth it go for that early imo. 
---
Also tidal charm can help at level 36, trinket gives you a stun on a 15min cooldown.
---
They seem to act like it, too
---
It wasn‚Äôt the downfall but it was certainly the beginning of the end.
---
yeah just stream snipe them over and over again Bold move. What if they are the same faction?
---
Tauren master race
---
No, I chug noggenfloggers because I like how they look, and I stare mournfully at stoneform as I get chain feared after using my trinket, because I DID this, a LOT. By the way, WOTF gives you several second of immunity to run back to the lock/priest during, and breaks more than just fear, things you learn by playing the game.
---
btw go read the orc and troll racials, literally nothing in there that saying anything related to anything warlocks do, and both dps cooldowns are tiny increases, especially in pvp.
---
I've decided im going to play as a Female Tauren Shaman in classic
---
male tauren are slightly too big feeling when playing
---
So not super helpful because *I have not read nor will I be using this guide since I'm rolling horde* BUT... There was an interview with 2 people who are polishing off a speed leveling guide for Alliance side on a recent episode of the podcast Countdown to Classic.
---
Specifically: Episode 98, 1:37:45 is the start of interview where they talk about creating the guide and the process of it (taking 1000+ hours I believe it was to make). The Creators are Aleyna and Umbra.
---
For what it's worth.
---
This will only benefit players in highly specific situations like AoE farming and I don't feel like that process should be made more convenient.
---
If you're playing Hunter and want to be the best you can be it's a great read. Do you have any questions specifically?
---
&gt; I think people like wrath for the Lich king.
---
I agree that there were many mistakes, but for me, WotLK is the greatest era of WoW tied with Vanilla. I don't like being forced to fly everywhere and I don't like the Dungeon Finder, nor do I like the art style in comparison with Vanilla. But I like building my character the way I want to, and the talent trees being absolutely massive is the way I like it. Glyphs also helped in that direction. I quit WoW a few days after the Panda prepatch, when they changed from talent trees to the current "pick 3" system.
---
Thanks for the in-depth analysis!
---
Spirit based healers (priest/Druid) use a lot more heal queueing/cancelling style, mp5 healers (pally/shaman) use more downrank spam, although they all use both to an extent.
---
Great info!
---
Will model editing work in classic? I suppose since its using the same client as BFA, if it works in BFA it will work in classic.
---
Seems like you posted this just to prove that you are a pay2win scrub.
---
Blizz hardly polices it in normal retail. Gold selling is going to be rampant.
---
True, and this is one upside to ele/resto leveling.
---
Ohh yeah?
---
I quite enjoy killing things one at a time then looting.
---
Making posts like this make this sort of change much less likely, because it just brings all the neckbeards out writing essays about how RSI is a core feature of vanilla. If everyone just ignored it they would probably put it in Classic just because *common sense* and obviously no one would complain once it is in.
---
Pretend you're a noob again and pick whichever one you think has cooler starting armor. That's true vanilla.
---
Mop and late game legion were not bad expansions at all imo
---
I mean, he‚Äôs not wrong...
---
Didn't they already confirm AoE looting is going to be in classic?
---
Winterspring had the higher drop rate and was easier to farm.
---
The problem here is that your asking for an ability to be rebalanced.
---
This is not vanilla.
---
Otherwise all specs for all classes would be able to become viable with a slight tweek of an ability or two.
---
The fact that you just called wow pay2win proves that you‚Äôre the scrub lol.

Self burns are rare lol

Windfury Totem. Extra hits are pretty damn strong in vanilla.
---
If you want to tank or even have a slight desire that you might want to try it at some point go warrior. If to strictly want to Dps go rogue. Warriors are by far the most common class because when geared really well are beasts. but most people don't get this geared and just suck. Rogues aren't as gear depended and are less common then warriors. If you enjoy open world PvP, rogues are also more fun.
---
on the flip side.. using a quest addon might show you an area that has quests you didn't know about 15 years ago so you find it that way... maybe someone up a mountain or hillside you never thought to otherwise climb.
---
Contrary to your point, Forsaken in Vanilla were more realistic as humans who were simply brought back to life as undead than the mustache twirling villains they are now.
---
If you're REALLY paranoid, you can set yourself up to drain tank (affliction) with an invisible succubus on passive.  You get jumped, you hit the seduce button, then fear kite.  WotF will still break that, but it will help vs the other 3 races.  I got my first PvP kill back at vanilla release doing this...vs a skull level warrior who was too dumb to use whatever it is in berserker stance that does fear immunity.
---
Warning though: by simply keeping your summon as PvP insurance, you will level a lot slower.
---
Nope. Autolooting (so you don't have to hold down a hotkey anymore) is in the ui of the alpha on the CDN, but that's far from confirmation even it is in Classic. You do bring up a good point though, where are the posts about how autolooting is an abomination and a corruption of core vanilla experience? It's pretty the exact same thing as aoe looting, just aoe looting was added a bit later.
---
&lt;HOME&gt;

I used to crush people with stats like "damage taken" / "damage mitigated" just by not standing in fire, etc. Loved when those stats got added to meters in WoTLK. I remember leveling a Disc priest and being told it wasn't viable in raids. So I pugged a LFR in all blues, and nearly got kicked out when someone finally noticed I barely met the gear requirements, and the other healers started posting their healing meters, pointing out my "garbage heals" - so I posted damage mitigated, which doubled their heals, and posted a healing meter that removed overheals - literally made them eat their words.  
---
Little things like that make such a huge difference, and people (especially elitest theorycrafters) seem to miss it entirely.  
---
I would LOVE a meter that actually accounted for DPS gains attributed to the player that boosted them, rather than the player actually doing the damage. For instance, a "Leader of the Pack" aura would calculate 5% of all critical strike damage done by the group and apply it to the druid's output DPS vs. the other players in group. Or CoE debuff would apply the elemental damage increase of the entire raid to the warlock who applied it vs. the players doing the direct damage.  
---
Things like that would make raid leading so much easier, as you could quickly identify the people really helping your raid progress, instead of getting harassed by big numbers and fraudulent boasts of "I'm your best player" by the guy constantly requiring heals and frustrating your healers to no end...
---
I've never been a fan of leveling guides on a brand new server. All the guides I've seen make a lot of assumptions which only pertain to mature servers. They are also very incomplete IMO, they are just questing routes. There is a lot more to leveling fast than just doing quests in a particular order.
---
If you want a general guide though look up James' Alliance Guide and Joanna's Horse Guide. Those are the two best ones I've seen. Joanna is working on an Alliance guide but it's not complete.
---
A good review.
---
I've been playing a druid on the p servers for 3 years now and I want to add to this that they have a lot of depth to them, both in terms of skill and gearing (you can swap so much gear and gear for so many specs). 
---
In PvP they have a lot of potential, but they also are incredibly difficult to play effectively. You have parts of the kits of a warrior, rogue, mage and priest. It's about finding the synergy between all of your different kits. It's a lot of fun and if you are willing to put the time into it I'm sure you will enjoy it.
---
On the other hand you can put a lot less time into another class (Mage, Shaman) and be able to do a lot more damage and sick plays without as much time commitment to learning your class. Druid truly plays on the razors edge.
---
No for sure I can agree with that. I personally don‚Äôt really watch any twitch at all. I‚Äôm just curious if it was really the streamers or the followers that were the problem. It seems to me that most of the Classic wow streamers are pretty down to earth and care for the well being of the game.  But I agree about all the toxic followers.

Is there anything that requires mining above 300 skill, or mining with any special tool? Herbalism, Skinning and Fishing all have some things, but I can't recall anything for mining.
---
Could it be 8 weeks away? This is a tease!
---
Hi, /u/markbbbm
---
Thanks for this answer very helpful and informative.
---
Once hunter damage starts falling off, how viable are they in PvP?
---
Just like they did the first time 'round.
---
I'm not gonna' lie; the fact we'll be getting the proper Horde back sans the plague of tusk-less pointy ears is one of the things I'm most looking forward to with Classic.
---
Regrouping Lightning's Blade NA.
---
Faction non issue.  core group of my friends going ally. still want to bring in the hordies.
---
A Leveling guild that will break apart when everyone finds  a guild that suits their needs. The core concept is to bring as many people from lightnings blade back together.
---
Server to roll on.   Lightning's Blade, if it doesnt exist. the first pvp server alphabetically starting with L.
---
...which is constantly camped by horde players who are mad that their quest line is harder, even though it mostly consists of travel and dungeons where ally can't interfere anyway.
---
The answer is indeed a simple one;
---
Not everyone will be playing classic for the *leveling experience*
---
Especially those who have done it many times before.
---
I mean jail break on pservers nowadays is a lot easier than it was on retail because people were a lot worse in this regard.
---
Youd advertise a Jail Break run and people would go without realizing what Ony attunement was and leave group. Youd have people on the quest and not realize its significance and just give up because it was too much clearing. Youd have people start Jail Break before everyone turned in the initial quest. Youd have respawns because some people in the group wanted to do Arena/coffer or Golemlord to start the instance.
---
There was nothing really difficult or special youd have to do for Test of Skulls, do a LBRS, a few UBRS, kill some random elites and another UBRS, certainly longer, but getting a good group for Jail Break back in the day was a nightmare.
---
This is wrong.  It also benefits me when the thing I am trying to kill runs off and dies half way up a cliff from SW:P.

Yeah! Fuck playing the game! I'm personally going to wait and buy a fully geared T3 character. Time is money, friend.
---
in TBC it's a spell that scales very well, because it has no CD. you don't even take it until late T5, but by sunwell every priest is basically just CoH spamming. it is insanely good on certain fights (felmyst, twins), and never bad once your gear is up to par.

---
Wow this is good. What about viable specs for pvp?
---
You are getting the answer but not understanding it. It's not complicated...
---
And was a must-have when fighting Moroes. That boss is the entire reason the trinket got nerfed.
---
Wouldn't work anyhow. Bag space is a premium and there's so much garbage that drops that isn't worth much that by the time you get to 60 and have a decent bit of gold you're not even auto-looting just to conserve space from junk.
---
Vanilla looting is wildly different from retail. You need to manage bag space, especially since you're bringing reagents, ammo, shards, plenty of food, quest items, profession gatherings, mounts (yes, your mount is a bag slot), low stack counts, etc.
---
Even if they did add it, folks would stop using it real quick.
---
I favorite leveling guild is the yellow exclamation mark above NPC's heads. I then read the quest and follow its instructions. Doing that generally provides me with levels. Some times it sends me on wild goose chases.
---
Addons have always been in WOW. If you dont like them, dont use them.
---
You have never played a druid then in a PvP group flag running or defending a node in ab.
---
Natures grasp is probably the only true "1 point wonder" in the game and make a far greater impact than 1 more point in hotw.
---
Yea sure, they did work hard to balance the classes. Doesnt mean they really got there.
---
What is the point of playing Classic if they remove the quirks that make vanilla unique? Surely people won't complain if there are a couple of QoL changes. The problem is that if you follow the trend of doing QoL changes that are focussed on the convienence of the individual then you end up with retail WoW.
---
Many players who are excited about Classic are not at all interested in playing retail with vanilla paint on.
---
I don't know if I'd mind this, especially since in Vanilla we could reach mobs that ran up hillsides with loot.
---
Clearly, you've never ran ZG. XD
---
I'ts also the most offensive word you'll be able to get away with, because of right-click reporting and outrage culture.
---
Oh hell naw not this shit again.
---
No
---
i feel like i'm pathetic at 28, about to graduate and be an attorney handling serious shit of rich people, and i'm more excited about being a holy paly playing wack a mole during scripted pixel encounters
---
Hey, Zaetar would smack dat.
---
Bartender, cooldown count, dot tracker, selljunk.
---
That's about it. I don't use much.
---
...just the thought brings a tear to me eye
---
Unless you are planning around respecc'ing at 40 to Ele and have a ton of mail/leather SP gear ready, its generally easier to stay enhance with storm strike.
---
However after like 45 and even with keeping your 2h up t o date, its just no tnearly as fast as Ele and Ele you don't t need a second gear set to heal/DPs.
---
But some people like.enhance more, so more powerful to them.. Just be aware Ele is a straight up better spec.
---
Shedo does like top 5-ish DPS on meters, plus the extra damage he is responsible for from crit buff.
---
Druid healers seem fine (I only healed on Druid in TBC and WotLK), as all healers are mostly just spamming their most efficient heal. Sometimes Priests and Druids AOE heal, and you can use HoTs if assigned to a tank. They can also heal 5 mans easily.
---
Druid tanks are being recognized finally, esp. with Skarm's recent videos (keep an eye out for Tips' Bear Tank deep dive with Skarm; the Prot Warrior one was excellent). They have crazy HP and armor, as well as the highest single target TPS without question.
---
They are among the best duelists in PVP, being able to counter their opponent or escape if they do not have the upper hand. Best flag carriers in WSG, and good defenders/spinners in AB.
---
They require more time and effort to shine, and have some drawbacks compared to their counter-parts (can't use pots, no vanish, no normal rez, etc.), but they also have advantages.
---
Well I know this isn't much of a discussion but more of an experience sharing but I'll come back on some of your points:
---
About the leveling:
---
- The reason why people don't take Aimed Shot early on is because it is very mana inefficient, while you kill 1mob a little faster you also spend way more time drinking and waiting for mana when you could send your pet on more mobs and use more Multishot more effectively. So in the end it feels like you're going faster with that one mob damage but in the long run it all negates itself and you end up taking more time.
---
- About the spec, for the guides I've stumbled upon, I've actually never seen the spec you linked. Bestial Swiftness, Improved Mend Pet and Spiritual Bond were all on there, and for a good reason. (Who the heck takes that focus talent)
---
- About the change of playstyle I can agree to some degree but Autoshot weaving really isn't that hard to pickup
---
About the 2h rotation:
---
- Definitely not for everyone, especially the new hunters which were a focus of this post (maybe break it up). I'd focus more on pet control for them.
---
- I was actually planning on using that kind of rotation on Classic and there's a few points that I would add:
---
* The viability of that rotation isn't only based on your skills, it is hindered by moving tanks/bosses and the ability of your warlocks and other dps to keep it in their pants and not overaggro
---
* There's a lot of bosses where doing it is worse than not doing it (obviously don't do it on Ragnaros' back unless you want all the melees to hate you) so it isn't a straight up 150dps increase.
---
* To go along with the point above, you will need both: stat sticks and a 2h
---
* While it is best on farm content, there will be a point where running in melee range and positionning yourself will take away more of your dps because you missed out on at least 2auto shots + 1 multi shot to try to do the rotation.
---
* As stated in the post doing it is VERY taxing mentally and may burn you down (it needs to be executed close to perfectly to even do an improvement on your dps) so I wouldn't personally recommend it
---
TL;DR: this is a lot of effort to push dps where people don't really seek it, but while you do what's fun to you do it
---
(Also, yeah T3 is pretty bad)
---
Right? Why would anyone need a guide? Like I understand Questie because you can still decide to run the quests in whatever order you want. But following a guide? Like why don‚Äôt you just pay someone to play for you.
---
As a raiding priest my spells were flash heal, renew, a down ranked heal, and the occasional pw shield.   If I remember correctly everything was +healing and mana per 5.  I think the only thing I had +spirit on was will of arlok. Id swap it for my benediction when I was down to 1/4 mana and switch to my down ranked heal to regenerate mana.
---
I picked Druid :(
---
I always hated AoE looting and am glad it‚Äôs gone.
---
I like to know what came off of each mob. I hate not being able to know what dropped what. Plus, it‚Äôs satisfying to loot all the corpses after a mass AoE fest. 
---
And on top of that, it speeds up AoE grinding even more, an already insanely overpowered way to play, be it for gold or xp.

I was in a top 5 guild on our server in Vanilla.. We got up to Twin Emps in AQ40, and downed I believe 5-6 Naxx bosses before people started quitting to wait for BC. 
---
Our raid ran a Feral for Leader of the Pack in a Rogue Group, Moonkin for Moonkin Aura for a Caster Group, 2-3 Resto Druids and we even had Shadow Priests. 
---
I've become incredibly skeptical of people puppeting elitist min-max shit from PServers, or wondering what their actual Vanilla credentials are.. 
---
In Vanilla we were raiding with people across all walks of life that had never played MMOs before, on crappy internet and crappy computers.. coordinating 40 people and still managing to down bosses. This idea that you cant have a feral druid in a raid is ridiculous and guess what, your Rogues and Fury Warriors will want one. Your Mages are going to wish they had some goober playing Moonkin so they could get their own numbers up. 
---
Druids were disgusting in PvP.. Ignoring Engineering and gimmick items they handled Warriors and Rogues nearly as well as Frost Mages, beat Mages and Hunters via attrition and sustaining, duel other healers for hours until one gave up.. the only real thing I remember having a problem with his Shamans spamming purge and windfury proccing but they oom themselves half the time, or good Warlocks. 
---
When you are really into something, and have real experience, and knowledge, it becomes easier to identify people that are full of shit. I see the same shit with people that are into guns... just parroting bullshit they saw in forums or on instagram but no real information they've gotten for themselves via experience. 
---
Druids were perfectly fine in Raid Healing.. just because a Paladin or Priest could do better on the meters, doesnt mean any guild ever was not recruiting druids because they only needed 1 for MOTW. In my experience, a lot of Druid players were into it for class fantasy, and weren't exactly the types to try hard.. I look forward to seeing what I can accomplish raid healing vs fucboi Paladins in their class chat channel seeing who has to spec for Improved Might or Sanctuary.
---
its the retail wow mindset. Gotta follow this race/class combo, gotta follow this quest path, gotta get to 60 first because the other 90% of this game doesn't matter. sure people can play how they want to and rush through things but those types of people don't understand why classic wow was great and with that mindset they never will.
---
Are you talkin about that thread a day or two ago, when they suggested releasing future expansions of content and the rates in them as just more tiers higher up at the same level 60?
---
this has to be the dumbest rule of any subreddit.
---
I don‚Äôt like them but they‚Äôre here to stay, they‚Äôve been here since day one so might as well get used to them.
---
?
---
Jailbreak happens inside a dungeon.
---
Horde quests requires travelling around the world multiple times, killing four elite dragons outside, plus one LBRS and two UBRS runs. Alliance need to do two sections of BRD, run around Stormwind a lot, kill a few non-elite mobs, discover that the Alliance has been compromised by the bronze dragonflight, walk through a cave and do one UBRS run.
---
So I don't know what you're getting at, the Horde quest takes objectively more time and effort. Only person whining about it is you though.
---
AOE looting has nothing to do with managing bag space.
---
Good rebuttal. Shame the other dude doesn‚Äôt understand it.
---
I doubt they‚Äôd give less than 2 months notice. So if it IS the July 16 meme, we would have to get the date by may 16. 
---
I thought we‚Äôd have one by now, so maybe launch is later :/
---
If they do go that route, I hope they don't add flying mounts. Flying mounts ruined world pvp and interacting with the world.
---
Except these guides have been around since Vanilla.
---
John staats talk about this in his book about how they made vanilla. Its a very good read
---
To be clear they are not among the fastest, but in my opinion they are not the worst. I like to level 2h arms, and chain pull mobs until i need to bandage. Between MS and overpower crits, it can feel pretty efficient. It all depends on the game play you enjoy. For me being up close are fighting for survival is more fun than bubble and wanding things to death like a priest does, or letting your pet do all the work like hunters, and warlocks.
---
Are you making fun of him by trolling or what's going on here?
---
I didn't know a single person to do this in Vanilla.. got to keep in mind the people on Private Servers are the most turbo-nerd of turbo nerd WoW fanatics.
---
The former devs will tell you: they didn't really try to get to a balanced state in all things. They just wanted to ensure viability in certain areas of the game for certain specs (e.g. Moonkin can do well in PVP, but goes OOM in raids).
---
Its pretty simple to figure out what comes after Naxx is finished. Create a new class and do it again.  
---
honestly though, i think there are alot of people coming to classic wow who have the retail mentality. They don't want to explore and figure things out. they just want to follow a guide (quest/talents/gear) and rush to 60. These people will never understand why classic wow was so great.
---
https://wowleveling.fandom.com/wiki/Wow_Leveling_Wiki
---
has some decent ones, most with video speedruns of the guide section as well.
---
I might use one if I get stuck on where to go next. You don't have to follow them from start to finish, you know...
---
Never thought of it that way. It makes sense tho.
---
That's my favorite of this meme ever. If this was an earlier version of vanilla you're goddamn right I'd be specced 31 in surv for lacerate.
---
Shh. You're ruining his illusion.
---
IIRC this is played in Stonetalon, too
---
I‚Äôm not even team questie here, but there‚Äôs plenty of reasons to prefer Vanilla endgame over Retail endgame.
---
40 man content, 9 entirely different classes, different game mechanics like threat and mana are fun to manage, older raids are more charming, loot feels rewarding, no whateverforging, you know your teammates more since it‚Äôs a social game, bosses are less over complicated (looking at you klaxxi lords), lore is closer to Warcraft era, less focus on topping meters, and so on.
---
Personally I would prefer blizz to do 1 of 2 things:
---
1) treat this as an alternate timeline and see how they'd progress the game based on what they know now. 
---
2) release dedicated servers for the other expansions over time with the ability to carry over your character from the previous expansion.
---
Either way they should leave at least a good chunk of classic servers untouched until population dictates mergers.
---
No, keep classic classic. classic isn't about quality of life improvements. This is why we will spend half out time on flight paths enjoying the scenery.
---
Curse of exhaustion should allow you to kite rogues at low level.
---
Spirit bond is pure awful.
---
Imp. Revived pet, bestial focus and pathfinding are all superior choices.
---
What this game comes down to, the simple truth of it is that, in the beginning each click every single click, with it came a certain value. In classic, we killed one thing and we looted it. Or we killed a lot of things and then we looted them all one at a time.
---
But the inevitable process of expansions, play a burnout requiring more rewards faster, and stuff like that meant that players needed more incentive. Players needed more bang for their click.
---
It's for that reason that I would not change loot. It is not a quality of life change but has a direct impact on how many times we click in a play session. And that has a direct impact on how long we play. And that has a direct impact on how we perceive our ratio of time invested to satisfaction or reward gained. One click per corpse was the classic standard and when you change that, it may seem like a very small thing, but it changes the value of one click.
---
Yes blizzard could change it to group loot. Or you me and everyone else could work that much harder on retraining our brains to once again appreciate the value in one single click and vanilla Warcraft. A value which inevitably changes in future expansions.
---
You are very dense.
---
spell power coefficient
---
its one thing to get assistance with a quest its a complete other thing to use something like Azeroth auto pilot. We all used Thottbot back in the day.
---
I could see how some people might want Vanilla 2.0 with all the quality of life improvements and class balancing and content after naxx. It‚Äôs a cool idea but that‚Äôs not what Classic is about.
---
To be fair this is not a new expansion. They are not expecting the same kind of numbers 4 classic round 2 as they would for a new expansion. They are not going to give us that many months advance notice.
---
At the same time it's not unreasonable to think it would happen after the last major content patch of battle for Azeroth.
---
Joana's, though one might argue that so many people will be using it that the route will be heavily populated every step of the way, unless you get out ahead of the pack.
---
MS&gt;OS
---
And every human female looks like one more kale salad away from becoming undead
---
Not gonna' lie, even though I had access to literally five (six? I don't remember if aquatic form had a dance animation) different dances I was always jealous of shamans and their damn hoppy dog dance.
---
Which is why, this time, I'll be playing both druid *and* shaman.
---
Gnomish Death Ray has saved my ass so many times while leveling.
---
If you're in my guild I will trust you by virtue of being a guildmate. There's no reason for me to micromanage until after you've shown that you're incompetent. That's my leadership style, anyway.
---
ESDF instead of WASD is amazing, btw.
---
It's just funny that there's lots of these qol changes that will be fixed and no one minds such as 
---
* autolooting
---
* multi item mail
---
* guild bank
---
and then you have ones that basically everyone is going to straightaway download an addon to fix just like they did in vanilla
---
* auto dismount
---
* ability cooldowns
---
* dot timer
---
* quests on minimap
---
* npc hp
---
* spell power/spell crit in character screen
---
  
---
and then you have ones that people will fight to their death to defend even though it's kinda laughable how much difference they make or how they supposedly 'erode' the essence of vanilla
---
* aoe looting
---
General Kenobi. You are a bold one.
---
Yes you join as a tank. Atleast have the courtisy to ask before takeing gear from your healer
---
It‚Äôs hard to take anyone who says ‚Äúretard‚Äù as an insult seriously
---
no
---
AoE loot really, really bothered me when it was introduced. It feels wrong. Damages my immersion in the game. I prefer that if you kill a beast you loot its corpse.
---
Joana's and Brian Kopp's are the classic ones, though there are likely massive improvements to them by now.
---
Did this once, paid some site 20$ to level 1-20. I hated the first few levels when making an alt so it was a no brainer.
---
I forget -- wasn't the cooldown like 2 or 2.5 seconds at minimum?
---
I get that but what i would recommend is ask people in game. Be apart of creating a community and not destroying it. it might be a tad extreme but everyone constantly using guides kind of kill the community. That it what happens in retail now and why no one talks to one another. If no one tells you where to go search up vanilla zones by level Pick something you wouldn't normally do and enjoy the adventure.
---
I think that's fair these days. I'm just pointing out that it was harder to connect with people and build that level of trust 14 years ago.
---
I do love diamonds... So being dense is a plus!
---
I'm sorry but good wow stops at wrath so what is mop, legion, cata, and bfa?
---
Pretty much that, and the other almost daily post with different iterations of the same question.
---
Second the point re frost mage in PvP. I eventually went this spec and the hard counters like shadow priests and locks become a lot easier to duel. 
---
Btw, I enjoyed reading your comments re rogue, warrior and mage, do you have any thoughts on hunters?
---
people want classic wow only to change everything about it lol
---
1 druid tank 1 feral dps tops in raids.
---
You could have more than 1 person on you or a hunter pet, and druid is not going to go toe to toe in melee with all rogues and warriors, its string suit is being able to play in melee for a while but bring in something else to the fight like a heal or some DoTs while kiting. The last point in HOTW is a sizeable loss in intellect, but the Nature's Grace ability is so unique. If you know you're only going to be raiding you may consider taking the extra HOTW (like you're mainly a PvPer but want to respec for an important progression run where you'll be healing + offtanking and will respec back for PvP ranking on the weekend).
---
When your lvl 20, there is no MS or OS. You need upgrades to level faster. How do you level faster? Killing things. How do you kill things? Stats. What stats does a Druid need? Stam, Int, Str, Agi, Spirit.
---
I don't think we should mind them too much. Some of them may be people who played years ago and just want to experience nostalgia for a bit. I think that's awesome-- The game is making it back into people's lives, even if only for a short period of time. 
---
I'm sure the community will be better overall a few months after launch. Those who aren't really into the game will have quit by then. But some of those people may have started out as 'tourists,' and I think thats awesome.
---
Yes
---
Release Classic WoW
---
Add TBC
---
Add WOTLK 
---
Restart.
---
That‚Äôs what? A 6-8 year cycle? Shit man they‚Äôd get my money for life.
---
Lvl 20 dude. He is specced Feral just like me. We both could heal or tank. There is no specs/roles to take into account who gets what.
---
Imagine preferring legion over mop lol
---
Comparing them line by line, process by process, function by function would be excruciating, probably not realistic.
---
ofc
---
I get what you're saying, but on the other hand it's pretty much a certainty that they are going to follow up classic with burning Crusade and wrath and so on. Now the question of if they are going to keep a separate server of just classic that is on a rotating, 12 to 15 months wipe and start over again schedule, that's up in the air. But was it actually a blizzard requirement that you had to clear one raid completely before you can move on to the next one? I know they were searching attunements but as far as I know there was no such necessity of clearing all content before current content.
---
If people wanted to Gear Up in tier 0.5 late in classic, thought they were s*** hot, and jumped right into naxx ramus after getting attuned, there'd be nothing stopping them from doing that.
---
I'm fine with first tier of content being a joke, plus naxx 80 let people experience a dungeon that only like 60 guilds even cleared while it was relevant. I liked it. Plus, it came with the BEST title in the game, The Immortal. I still wear this title to this day. 
---
T9 sucked ass but t10 and t8 were OUTSTANDING. Also, balance between classes was even better than it was in TBC, which itself made major strides towards hybrids actually being viable. 
---
Plus wrath was really awesome in terms of incorporating vehicles and instancing into leveling. I don't know how this works out for a new character. Probably can't see or access fuck all in some zones in Northrend at first, but it was awesome for people who leveled while it was relevant. 
---
Zones being created with flying specifically in mind was awesome too. Overall a really great expansion and there's no wonder why they hit their 14m peak during wrath.
---
I didn't ask you to take me seriously, I asked for your opinion on the situation. Take your sjw shit somewhere else please.
---
Talking about greens "of the who fucking cares" like they matter after 5 levels anyway.
---
If you can and will use it, roll need.
---
If you can't or won't, roll greed.
---
My favorite zone. Ever.
---
10m 3d was actually harder than 25m.
---
Because everybody's idea of fun is their own, everybody gets to decide how they want to have fun. Some people want to blast through quests and hit maximum level fast and start doing endgame content right away. That's their idea of fun.
---
I wouldn't question their idea of fun because there's no point.
---
My input was given regarding you, not the conversation. The conversation was absolutely fine. It‚Äôs that you wouldn‚Äôt let others have their opinion. My comments have nothing to do with ‚Äúreacting negatively to the conversation‚Äù.
---
I'd be okay with the Emerald Dream instance/ideas or the Crater PVP implemented. Mount Hyjal. Things that were originally "there" but not actually there in actual gameplay.
---
Oh fuck ya, it‚Äôs worth it for sure. I ended up making a second account and using it for my two power leveled characters. Basically an alt character starter pack.
---

Can we *please* get in the habit of calling BFA **modern** WoW instead of "retail". Classic will be retail as well since you need to pay for a subscription to play it. Calling BFA retail would just serve to confuse people.
---
There are two problems with your post;
---
1. QoL - this is a very un-vanilla like concept.
---
Play retail if you need your hand held or life made "a little bit easier"
---
2. Changes. As many of these should be avoided as is technically possible in the current era.

---
Man.. I gotta say that while it DOES happen at a time where kung fu panda came out, it's clearly chinese themed. China has an extremely rich and deep history. You can spend your entire life just studying one single dynasty. Stop being ignorant.
---
Working hard to balance the game and actually having a balanced game are not mutually exclusive my dood.
---
I paid a chinese farmer to level for me in TBC. I got an email and warning before he got to 65. Did the rest myself lol
---
Anyone else considering buying Activision/blizzard stock before the release?
---
you did nothing wrong. If a piece of gear is an upgrade, roll for it. If you win, gratz. If you Lose congratulate the other person and move on. especially on something as trivial as a green item. if its a small upgrade for you and a big upgrade for someone else, let them have it.
---
What comes after Naxx... Like you're in full Naxx BiS?  
---
Organized Guild vs Guild PvP?  
---
Farming Rank 14?  
---
Making an entire raid group comprised mainly of meme specs?  
---
Faction domination (killing enemy auctioneers/important quest givers)?  
---
Actually playing the game and having fun with your gear, because god knows the game isnt about raiding on a schedule just to be stronger the next week.
---
&gt; I was always jealous of shamans and their damn hoppy dog dance.
---
Hoppy dog dance is best dance.
---
How? 10 man 3D was essentially a tank and spank. Caster bases group or melee based. Zerg Sarth before any fight mechanics begin. So, no, 25 was harder.
---
Nothing beats that night elf run from wetlands to westfall
---
Negative princess.
---
an addon for enemycastbars for sure lol
---
Harder to get everything you needed in a group. So yeah, 25m was harder. I tanked both during progression and then later dpsd it. Always found 10m harder.
---
Expect to see every add on that retail uses to appear is some form in Vanilla. Essentially filling any gap that classic rips out out of retail a mod will more than likely have a way on making it easier for people to handle.

---
Streamlined gamers can also be called turbokids
---
On the other hand, many many many people will be also leveling with dual Gathering professions and banking on same logic you are using. Up to you. Get to level 10 or 15 and see if fires are gobbling of everything in keeping the price at a reasonably profitable level, or if it's bargain-basement Auction House selling and you suddenly realized you could actually make a tiny bit of profit if you bought other people stacks and just vendored them.
---
If it gets to that low price point you may want to just drop your two Gathering professions and pick up your typical tailoring enchanting.
---
Contemplating it but I would assume that classic is already calculated into the SP considering it had already been announced and that you automatically get it with a current subscription so the only thing that would really drive SP is new subscribers and even then it wouldn‚Äôt have an impact until annual earnings report. I would focus on Comcast being owners of the first ever Esports stadium.
---
_as a holy paladin_
---
&gt;You won't be able to chug flasks like on private servers
---
Why not? Of course supply will be less but so will demand. Private servers are international mega servers. Retail classic will be localized. If i want to farm gromsblood on my pserver its pretty much impossible but on retail i can just log in at 4am and have an empty server. 
---
Basically it will be easier to farm for yourself but AH prices will be slightly higher. Most people will be chugging consumables as the same rate as in pservers.
---
That doesn't justify the changes at all. It is undeniably a departure from the original look, which many people loved and were attached to. 
---
That kind of forceful change is exactly the reason why Blizzard lost the faith of it's original playerbase.
---
Why use many words when few words do same thing?
---
I'm anticipating most obvious thing, that being moving it right on into burning Crusade as it was 13 years ago. And maybe they will have a separate server that will specifically just keep re-running classic, then wiping progress and starting all over again every 12 to 15 months. In addition to continuing a progressive expansion servers. The one thing I don't think blizzard it will do is have a server on classic that gets to endgame and just stays there for all eternity.
---
Put sum respek on rexxar
---
Interesting! Thank you for the reply! Gotta keep the ol eyes peeled! Regardless, I'm so excited to play the best game ever made again
---
Explain the self burn. I didn't say wow was pay2win, merely that you adopted a pay2wi n playstyle in one aspect of the game.
---
You *literally* in your post, describe how you bought *with money* 2x level 60 chars and your first epic mount.
---
If that isn't paying2win, I truly do not understand the concept.
---
I still don't like it. You can't pre-cast NG before you pick up the flag because the flag is indoors. You have to go outside before you can cast it. And you can't cast it in Travel Form. That means you're slowing yourself down for something that you honestly don't need against only 1-2 melee. On the other hand, 4% extra stamina + intellect is completely passive and can definitely save your life.
---
And yes, I prefer to go on offense in AB. The only healer that can stealth shouldn't sit flags. Let the Hunters do that.
---
I think a lot of people overanalyze the level of tryhard you have to go to ‚Äúnot be rolled‚Äù. On a fresh private server with 10k pop, maybe... but you can probably get by a lot easier with a less hardcore population that‚Äôs also much smaller. As far as end game goals, missing 4-8 lockouts of MC won‚Äôt determine whether or not you‚Äôre killing Kel Thuzad. Only place I can see rushing to 60 being meaningful is if you are gunning for world/server 1st, or if you want to have your thunderfury in place. Which, if so, more power to you.
---
Please Blizzard, look what you've done.
---
If he wanted it, he should have rolled harder. The mechanisms in game are right in front of you need or greed, you get one roll. 
---
Also priests, paladins, druids and shaman all level as a dps spec but each can fulfill at least two roles. So it‚Äôs never really MS &gt; OS it‚Äôs current role &gt; inactive role‚Äîwhich is still bullshit cause there is a decent chance you‚Äôll be asked to fill a different role next time...so that staff seems real applicable now. 
---
Further, beyond egregious ninja looting (you know stealing loot for profit or in a juvenile display when quitting the game), I don‚Äôt give two fucks about the non raid members of mine and what they want, I won‚Äôt collude and ml shit to my friends, but if I need something while leveling, Fuck it‚ÄîI‚Äôm rolling on it. If you were a good player and the run was smooth I may even see if anyone wants to rerun.  We aren‚Äôt surviving in the wilderness, they won‚Äôt die cause they didn‚Äôt get illusory rod, they can buck up and put together another run. Welcome to Vanilla.
---
No arena in classic you'll have to wait for tbc
---
Seems like a strange thing to be worried about considering arenas aren't in Classic.
---
*they are NOT for eating*
---
Agree to disagree. I smell bullshit and I call it out.
---
Arenas were added in BC.
---
They're not in vanilla at all.
---
To be fair at this point, blizzard is much more prepared for that. They were not prepared at all back in 2004, but having been through 15 years of this they have some idea of how to block, report, and weed out the gold sellers.
---
It won't be perfect and some gold followers will still slip through the cracks, because we're a person can make money unethically, they will make money. But blizzard should definitely not start selling tokens for gold and vice versa because that did not come until many many years later.
---
The other part is simply us, the community, we report gold sellers and people who are engaging with them. Just do it, it's our community and we play a large part in maintaining it.
---
Are you too retarded to understand why 'retard' is a valid insult?
---
it's been over 500 days. i've lost my mind
---
&gt; If you're a user experience person I wonder why you're making the classic mistake of throwing a wall a text at people (maybe you don't care how the post is received).
---
Just to be clear, OP's post isn't a wall of text.  A wall of text is a massive glob of text which is unbroken by line breaks.  Other than that you are right.  It could definitely be more concise or ported to something like google docs where it could be better presented.
---
Dwarves are awful with that bouncy run animation, it's a joke.
---
I love this analysis. This is the great ball busting theory crafting I love to see.
---
Wait, no Cloak of Shadows in Vanilla? I thought it was a lvl 60 spell...
---
Being able to buy gold or tokens and gold for cash would cripple the feeling of classic Warcraft. There were very few titles, and the very thing about classic was that it was a representation of deciding what was worth your time and effort, and then that work you put in feeling like it was worth it to you when you bought the thing you wanted.
---
Blizzard can do that again and have that be exactly the same and it is not hard. the hard thing is for us, having played years or Decades of MMO's, having to retrain our brains to appreciate the level of effort to reward that vanilla offered. If we don't feel rewarded it's not the game's fault, it's our fault.
---
Yep. PTR's were the best time of the year. Free PVP server with any character you wanted.
---
You're all wrong. Gurubashi Arena ;]
---
If you have more than 1 person on you, then you're running away, NG or no NG. And you don't need NG to get away from people.
---
Hunter pets you just kill. It's not worth engaging a Hunter while his pet is still healthy, even if it is rooted. You can't even come close to killing a Hunter in the 15 seconds (max) that roots will last.
---
Time spent skinning from leveling it up alone accounts for over an hour. It's arguable that it doesn't really help compared to just using that time to level/farm all things considered. I'd take skinning anyway personally but only for the chance of getting some devilsaur.
---
Well if you want engineering you are going to need the primary Gathering profession for its materials.
---
that's not tips
---
Priests are so boring to level, I can't stand playing as one.
---
Best slap of the wrist you could have gotten really lol
---
It isn't really that tedious. Just another consumable you farm and you don't really spam them either. When tanking you pop 1 charge at most on pull, so you get ahead in threat. Druids already do tons of threat so you only pop them on bosses that of the gear-check/threat cap type.
---
When DPSing you can pop as many as you like but usually Feral Druids aren't expected to top meters but to be good offtanks decent DPS and decursers/dispellers/offhealers. You definitely want to have a bunch of them ready for a raid so you can use them when needed.
---
Remember kids, online friendships are not real friendships. /s
---
Thank you
---
Well we know you don‚Äôt understand the concept lol.
---
I wish more people had your brains.
---
Wich proff is that? Minning?
---
Another "shame the tourists" posts. Just be ready to help people, man. Dont make this a toxic experience.
---
Oh man ST. On Eranikus had the tank and healer go down right at the start of the fight. I was able to feign death and jumper cable the druid, who rezzed the tank, and we won. Shit was crazy.
---
Firstly, thank you for your opinion. I think we can all agree, the best thing about the Internet is everyone can voice their opinions as though they were edicts from Caesar in Rome. 
---
There are 4 ways I‚Äôve come up with/heard classic could go.
---
1. One set of servers, one run through the content, servers stagnate as people quit with no content to ever be added after naxx
---
2. Servers condense to a few legacy servers when content is thoroughly cleared. New servers pop up and content repeats. Process continues forever like d2lod ladder resets. 
---
3. Progress into tbc and follow the classic train to its ICC conclusion. 
---
4. Additional content added onto classic in the form of new raids or game/server tweaks (class balance, debuff limit, etc.) with resetting servers. A sort of system like d3 seasons, ‚Äòrefinement‚Äô of the classic game. 
---
There are small differences one could come up with but those, from what I can gather are the broad categories. To be honest, I‚Äôm fine with any of them. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll have much interest in playing classic wow a third time (2004-2006, 2019-2021).
---
Yes, and it's beautiful. I believe you can also get hand of justice procs.
---
All extremely valid points as to why there is no reason to change or add to Classic.
---
What is SM/Ruin spec for a warlock? Thanks
---
What rank Regrowth are you supposed to use for this?  Do mana pots and runes not share a CD?
---
Blizz keeps jumping with .2 seconds left.  Bastards.
---
they are objectively the weakest but not every decision made in the game is based on min/maxing every action so druids are by no means dead content
---
not to mention each player has different skill potential and a good druid will often be better and more useful than a bad other class
---
What profession do i get with engineering?
---
Exact
---
It's a medieval style high-fantasy game, of course humans are going to be prevalent.
---
And this was not an issue for you 15 years ago if you played because you had not been exposed to this before. Now it is an issue, so you know that if you just group with random people who you do not know at all, you put yourself at risk of having to deal with this Behavior. That means it's on you cultivate the group of people with whom you want to do dungeons. Sounds almost like a guild. On the other hand, people who behave crappy on a server will get a reputation as such and they will suffer
---
Save your mats. Just trust me.
---
They go into it [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/atmj9w/whats_wrong_with_arcane_missiles/) a bunch.
---
That is also true for raids in my experience.
---
There are plenty of fights that call for less healers than others. And don't forget trash, which makes up the majority of every instance. You could do most trash pulls with half of your healers AFK, but you often need more than 2 tanks for a lot of these pulls.
---
At cast. Otherwise there would be plenty of moments in raids where Blizzard would literally cost no mana and you could spam max rank for 2 minutes straight. I can assure you that is not that case.
---
I bet it was... classic. 
---
I know, I'm hilarious.
---
Those people are liars. Theres no easy mode on classic lol
---
        1
---
Have an upvote my good sir.
---
Cheers mate
---
I think this is one of two mouse methods, and probably the more popular, but I think its the inferior.  
---
This method requires using your movement hand for modifiers, and your mouse hand for keys.  I find two major problems. 
---
1.) it tethers your left hand to be near modifier keys and you lose valuable keybindings.  For example it‚Äôs possible to use this method and be ‚Äòesdf‚Äô, but if your hands are small it‚Äôs more difficult to reach the keys. The further you move to the center of the keyboard you gain keybindings but have to reach farther for your modifiers. 
---
2.) it requires constant repositioning of your mouse grip using because Your moving your thumb in many positions.  
---
IMHO the superior method is to assign modifiers to your mouse.  I think the Rival 600 is the best mouse for this.  3 buttons, one for shift, control and alt.  
---
Why it‚Äôs superior
---
1.) now since you are using your mouse hand did modifiers you can move your hand into the middle of the keyboard.  I actually play ‚Äò567‚Äô with no backpedal keybinding. I can do this because my left hand is not required to be near the modifiers.
---
2.) while you still have to move your mouse hand around it‚Äôs limited to only the 3 modifiers, and the 600 button positions are great.  I actually don‚Äôt move my thumb, it‚Äôs more of a roll/lean than a true lift off.  
---
I‚Äôve been working on my Classic UI for quite some time, and have theorized a lot how to be an mechanically good players. I also play hunter, so there‚Äôs a lot of abilities, and I don‚Äôt want to click a single ability.
---
I‚Äôm not ignorant, I‚Äôm not saying Chinese history isn‚Äôt interesting.
---
I‚Äôm saying it doesn‚Äôt fit within the Warcraft universe. No country is supposed to be represented in WoW it is a fantasy universe.
---
TL:DR All of the gear is mine lole
---
&gt;The aura also doesn't add more damage for the raid than another fury, same argument as boomkin aura and another mage.
---
Like you've actually done that comparison.
---
Wow. All credibility gone. You won't last very long in classic.
---
Why the difference between faction for feral viability?
---
Something like: If you're low on energy but close to a tick, wait for it, ferocious bite, then powershift and restart rotation; if you're not, and you're out of energy, then just powershift right away. 
---
Someone who knows better will correct me.
---
As I remember it, nothing required you to complete the raids in order except the gear checks. Doing Naxx in .5 would be pretty close to impossible, but it was definitely possible to gear up in ZG instead of MC or BWL for some of the later raids. I remember certain fights required high resist gear, so you‚Äôd have to craft or farm fire resist to fight Ragnaros or nature resist for Princess Huhuran.
---
Mage is very boring in vanilla raiding. You literally just mash 1 button the entire time. With that said I played mage the entirety of vanilla and loved it. You'll easily top meters, and mage pvp is a blast if that's your thing. 
---
The only threat reduction mage gets is -15% in the frost tree so if you aggro (and piss off your raid) you ice block and hope the tank regains aggro before it expires.
---
They're always viable in PvP. They just mean in PvE really.
---
Clearly, after Naxx you want to stand around in Ironforge showing off your epix while women fawn all over you. Because you‚Äôre just that cool. ;)
---
Personally I think TBC is a given eventually. Maybe 4 years in. We‚Äôll get the option to transfer our chars to new TBC realms.
---
It is kind of the other way around. Druids are exceptional on content that is *not* on farm. 
---
When your raid is undergeared and is trying a new raid for the first couple of weeks then they really shine with brez, innervate, barkskin, feral charge, nature's swiftness, swiftmend etc. They have a lot of options to turn around bad situations.
---
But when content is on farm and people are trying to top meters and decrease clearing time then they are slightly worse than their counterparts.
---
In general what they do doesn't really show up in statistics. But people thank you and remember the times you saved a bad pull or helped to turn around a seemingly lost fight.
---
So I pull aggro, I just instantly ice block for an instant -15% aggro, thus the boss will likely peel off me when I cast it?
---
One word. China
---
This sounds really cool.  I‚Äôm not on EU, but this would be a dope guild to be in.
---
The problem with even minor QoL changes is this.. Where does it end? What other \*seemingly\* innocuous QoL change might they make that has a devastating impact? It's better to simply not play with that Pandora's Box. AoE looting would have a massive impact on a lot of stuff. Like ZG or BWL for example. Looting trash mobs and ninjaing stuff.
---
And you aren't as scared the second time you play through "Fear"
---
It's not a hoax. But they're releasing it strictly to mobile.
---
Just curious, what's the cost of living like in Bulgaria? $300 a month doesn't seem like much.
---
But the turbo nerds are shaping the meta. The middle of the pack will still aim for what the top players are doing.
---
Maybe they learned their lesson (\*finally\*). They announced a date for BFA and then watched it flop flat on it's face when they had to rush it out the door.
---
Threat will be an issue on a lock. Their dps starts off rather average but rapidly increases with gear. Mage does solid damage and threat isn't as much of an issue...mages also scale well with gear. 
---
You'll be down ranking on every healing class.
---
Have you ever seen one of Asmongold's streams or Sodapoppin's streams when he plays wow? Even with sharding and whatnot, they always have about 100 spergs following them around. Now just imagine you're chillin in STV and you see 300-500 opposing faction players roll up...
---
#2 with judicious server merging of older servers if populations start lacking, and opening new servers for a fresh start again on classic please
---
Like what the hell, I was able to heal Zul'Farrak easily as a Shadow Priest back then with absolutely no issue, the Tank wasn't tank specced either.
---
Don't spam your biggest heals and you are good to go, downrank if you must.
---
I saw a post about most 40 man raids bringing about 6 mages, which is a lot, would you say mages are in high demand or not so much?
---
Do it for the Vets, Blizz!!
---
&lt;Undaunted&gt; - Horde |NA-PVP| semi-hardcore
---
Undaunted is recruiting members prior to the release of classic wow. Welcoming all players that are experienced or new with determination to progress at a steady rate and dedication on making the guild a better experience overall. We want to have a strong core of members when the game launches.
---
This guild will be semi-hardcore, Horde, and with a laid back demeanor but still seeking to progress with a goal to leave no one behind for those that show up on raid times, etc. Ideally a strong core roster of experienced players would be preferred to help out around the guild and bring everyone up to speed. We want a good sense of community within this guild so don‚Äôt be afraid to speak up and talk to others, in the end remember to just have fun with the game as well.
---
We will be doing PVE and PVP content with raids times being listed below but we do enjoy world pvp when we get the chance, perhaps even forming BG groups later on when they get introduced. When raiding starts we will be doing 3 nights a week. We are currently recruiting all classes, just play what you feel like. 
---
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday - 7:30 - 10:30 est
---
We currently have a discord channel. We have tabs for class/dungeon guide talk to help people out not familiar with classic wow and you can usually find me in general voice chat. Feel free to add me on discord or bnet for more info on joining it. Feral#0846
---
On my last Druid I beat 3 casters rolling on Robes of Arugal. Told those assholes "Look, do you not see the AGI on these robes!" They didn't think it was funny, but it was a serious upgrade for me. Their fault for only being able to wear cloth.
---
I'm using the same Ideazon Zmerc keyboard to type this that i bought for BC release.  The single most durable and reliable piece of gaming hardware i've ever owned.  And I'm on my 3rd corsair M60 mouse since around the same time.
---
Yeah he definitely is a personality. He also always has around 15k-25k viewers on his stream regularly and even with sharding has about 100 spergs following him around wherever he goes. Without sharding I'm sure there'd be 1000
---
They're the master of threat-per-second (without sacrificing mitigation), escaping hairy situations, soloing certain PvE content (e.g. Tribute run), WSG flag carrying, and more.
---
Right after the announcement I waited in line for 20 minutes or so . Just to be able to play for 15 minutes and get booted off. It felt extremely undertuned and mobs dropped like bowling pins.
---
So what you're saying is you're gonna be a sneaky mother fucker and sneak into the middle of the pack of 300 and camp the streamer? 
---
Good luck with that. 
---
If you're saying you're going to camp the small streamers like me then... well YOU HAVE NO HONOR!!!
---
The major 10-25 for night elves is all great music. It's my favorite starting zone for music and looks.
---
Theres mobs in AQ20 and AQ40 that drop small mining nodes that require 305 mining.
---
I'd probably be able to get a few people into classic WoW if I could give them even just 2 weeks of play time for free.
---
My favorite too, music on loop - never gets old
---
Loved watching Maydie's pvp videos!
---
Leveling, in my opinion, is the least enjoyable part of World of Warcraft and the game doesn't actually begin until 60
---
Ah my other comment would have been for OP since you aren't OP then uh. Carry on. I've seen it but not too worried about. I'm just going to avoid servers with big streamers on it if I can
---
Yes, mages are of an abundance. Any class shouldn't have an issue finding raids.
---
I'd be cool with all returning players getting a free month when one of the major phases hits. Like maybe phase 2 or 3.
---
Sharding was confirmed not to happen, right?
---
Dont forget your rocket boot parachute cloak combo
---
Exactly, and those gear checks were not specific hard lines. There was always some wiggle room based on your raid composition and your player skill and your consumables
---
Uhhhhhh, literally everything we have in terms of fantasy is based on something real. We can only create imaginary worlds based on things we actually know or have already perceived. Are you going to talk about how Tauren shouldn't be based on aboriginal people next?
---
Do you have any experience with it or know for sure? Sounds like you're making an assumption. There was definitely a point in classic that it worked based on target hit rather than on cast, I just don't know if it was changed by 1.12.
---
Hi, /u/twtchtv_LottoOne
---
The talent Frost Channeling gives a passive -15% threat reduction to your frost spells. Ice Block temporarily drops aggro from you for 10 seconds since you are untargetable.
---
You'll also be conjuring and handing out a lot of water
---
At 4 water per cast
---
*so much water...*
---
Well I mean you‚Äôve got a phone right?
---
Tauren starting zone is the one thing I miss the most. Cata made such a beautiful zone so...ugly.
---
Ahh thanks so much!
---
If you love healing you should heal in my opinion. Everyone enjoys topping but finding healers who actually like it is really hard.
---
1. Lock has no threat reduction talents. Mages do, so it will be less of a problem for them.
---
2. for topping meters mage is the better bet, mages do more damage at more points in the game, super late game locks compete but you'll have to wait a while.
---
3. It's very similar to raid healing in WotLK. Downranking allows you to always been spam casting. In real vanilla you could get addons that would let your heals target the lowest person in the raid and most people would just spam that button. Blizzard removed the functionality in TBC. Shamans having chain heal mixes things up a bit because you can spam it very easily and even downrank it. You shouldn't really have many problems of not knowing how to heal/what spells to you unless you're a priest but even they just have correct efficient ranks to go to.
---
No, I mean, the guides we are talking about were around during vanilla. Joana's, specifically.
---
One of the reasons I‚Äôm looking forward to classic is the original night elf female faces.
---
I don't support your greedy bullshit. It's not about "hurr I can use it is teh upgrade" It's about who gets the most bang for your buck. You won't last long on classic AT ALL.
---
Crazy that this is like the only video on the internet of the wow launch
---
Why do you feel the need to try to change how I play the game?
---
Man this looked awesome. Thats gonna be me and my boy but with some beers and some weed. Most likely some pre-rolled blunts or joints to maximize grind time. 
---
I hope everyones first weekend is full of them playing with whatever substances they enjoy, if its water, mountain dew, a box of cheeze its.. I look forward to the community and all you nerds.
---
Same.
---
Wrath had some pretty great music. I never got tired of Dalaran, Crystalsong and Garden of Life are very peaceful, and obviously Grizzly Hills
---
playing a rogue and warlock when classic drops. I can't stand paladin and druid.
---
Ret shouldn‚Äôt take any gear from warriors, a 2hander maybe but that‚Äôs a PvP item for warriors anyway. The biggest problem with ret is half the people who play them think warrior offset gear from raids is also ret gear. PvP gear early game mixed with dungeon blues is pre bis, but 95% of people arnt willing to put in the pvp grind and think ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs got strength and it‚Äôs plate I should need on it‚Äù.
---
Pretty sure guild banks won't be in classic. The addons you mentioned (plus many others) were used throughout the entirety of vanilla by a ton of people so I don't really understand the point you are trying to make.
---
And again, I don't complain about any of these things. The problem arises only when you accumulate them and when you create the expectation that the game can/should be changed reguarly. Changes like that mostly accomodate the lazy and solo focussed players.
---
It might seem ridiculous to you but even the looting mechanics kind of add to the social interactivity of vanilla. I remember when I grinded/leveled with my brother or friends then we would often have these little competitions of who loots first. Do these new and convenient loot mechanics remove that? Idk really. It isn't important but it just removes another thing that made vanilla what it was.
---
I think WoW peaked at Ulduar. Icecream Citadel was really good too. So yea, Wrath was pretty great despite the crusade and some of the other stuff that it brought.
---
Upvoted because I wanted to comment I've always enjoyed using Jame's for Alliance. It's aimed at a fast questing/grinding mix for max efficiency similar to Joana's, but he includes the biggest dungeons to look out for and goes into extensive detail on how to pick up all the quests for each dungeon and how to beat them all in one run, which makes doing the dungeons pretty worth.
---
There are some minor mistakes and it's based on all the quests available during 1.12, some of which might not be in the early phases, but for the most part I love it.
---
This is really interesting, and I get it by reading it, but would you be able to link some raid dps footage of this playstyle in action?
---
I spent a few mins trying to find some myself, but most videos and guides all stick to traditional autoshot/multishot weaving.
---
The long beard looks like a pinecone.
---
and you are entitled to that opinion and can play as you like. I don't know if you every played it when it was originally released, i wont presume to did or didn't, but for me most of my fondest memories happened way before lvl 60. I'd like others to get the same enjoyment from that game that i once did. personally i think alot of people who never played classic and try and rush to 60 will burn out and quit quickly. I hope that is not the case though.
---
I've personally been using the old SteelSeries WoW mouse for many years and love it, but sadly I believe it's been discontinued and mines starting to show its age.
---
Heal through BWL, switch to your lock alt for aq/naxx
---
What server you gonna roll? I‚Äôll joint you
---
Nothing really, the forsaken are from warcraft 3.
---
Wait how do trolls have increased threat generation? Im blanking hard.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IE0bhRbkAZZgx0tM0z
---
Here we go, so mages and warlocks will be nowhere NEAR the top until Naxx. Like seriously, before AQ, rogues and warriors will actually double your DPS. Come Naxx, warlocks will be only slightly less than rogues and somewhat below fury. One mage which has ignite rolling the entire fight will be way on top.
---
Shamans are excellent/fun heals and DO THE MOST DAMAGE IN PVP. No lie, highest burst damage in the game, and your healing gear serves as your PvP gear
---
Both Druids are Feral, but since he was healing for that pull, I cant roll on Intellect. Sounds like some Looking for Dungeon Wrath baby nonsense to me. Explain how that makes sense in your mind, wise one.
---
Maybe if your guild didn't waste slots on a feral and moonkin druid you might have actually cleared AQ40 or Naxx. You're vanilla guild was a casual guild, being top 5 on your server just means your server wasn't competitive at all.
---
I don‚Äôt think Tauren culture mirrored aboriginal cultures nearly as closely as pandarens do Chinese culture.
---
I don‚Äôt believe it is the same.
---
it is simply a recommendation from a past vanilla player, not an order. Retail is dying for a reason i believe part of it is because people become absorbing in guide and stop communicating with one another.
---
I only know a few good builds for most specs. I pay more attention to PvE than I do for PvP.
---
I am not the best person to ask about PvP builds
---
Boys were missing natural alignment crystal in here.
---
"original look"
---
What "Original" look? You mean like how the game looked ten years ago? Oh, but by that time Deathwing already blew the place apart and the aesthetic already shifted *massively*.
---
fair nuff
---
No.  
---
Stupid question, they are different games at this point. You have full access to vanilla wow wiki, you can see the spells and talents there. Do you know the spells and talents of classes in retail? Then you'll be able to tell how different they are.
---
Mages don‚Äôt pull aggrieved. Fury‚Äôs might occasionally but I‚Äôve seen tanks hold threat on 1500 dps warriors and they have no threat reduction. Usually mages will have like half the threat as melee
---
&gt; Not restricted to MMO's
---
I literally use my old one at work and I love it. Back/forward a page, close a tab, bring terminal to front (or open a new terminal window), open a specific app, etc.
---
I think I prefer the smaller, older one than the newer/bigger bulky one.
---
Also, the Warcraft 3 campaign story was probably inspired by the books that were out so far from "A Song of Ice and Fire".  
---
**Fun Fact**: The last mission of Frozen Throne is called "A Symphony of Frost and Flame". I noticed this a few years ago when deciding to revisit the series since I played it as a child.
---
1) Yes
---
2) Weapon Skill, yes.
---
3) "/1 Level 20 Hunter LFG WC"
---
3a) Some need keys, yes.
---
4) For the most part yes.
---
taunt is vital for some raid bosses, but speaking of just 5 man dungeons, its at most a inconvenience. And Paladin tanks do have damage reduction in their build, just not 1 super major damage reduction like shield wall. Like I said in my last comment they have blessing of sanctuary, redoubt, and holy shield. all of which gives a more overall damage reduction rather than a one time thing. With this in mind, i'm not delusional, most prot pallys wont make it past tanking 5 mans, but that's okay. that is what they are best at after all, Warriors are just not as good at AoE tanking as paladins, and 5 mans have a lot of AoE pulls. Especially with many private servers that have come out over the years, people have learned how to paladin tank effectively over the years and I hope to see more of them come classic. Cheers.
---
1. Both. People will say its hard, its not like mythic raiding hard, there's not alot going on, its unforgiving. Mistakes are punished instantly. Along with being very grindy. You're not on the edge of your seat the whole time, but you will feel very bad making a mistake because it casuses you to run back to your corpse which can be 2-10minutes.
---
2. yea
---
3. You walk there, most don't have any special requirements
---
4. Yes, Most are very basic versions of what you see today and only 1 or 2 abilities change depending on your spec, not all of them.
---
1. Yes and yes.
---
2. No announcements, but it doesnt seem they would make changes to this so, no for PvP servers, yes for PvE
---
3. No personal loot. Rolls and round robin. Learn to share.
---
4. 2500 ball park. Theyve said theyre going to try to keep it around the same.
---
5. It was added around 1.10, it was in Vanilla.
---
6. Debatable. Blizzcon announcements said "cross realms? Absolutely not!" This is assumed to be referencing to dungeons but it wasnt specific.
---
7. Crossrealm BGs and battle groups were 1.12 and is the same answer as 6
---
8. No.
---
9. Allys couldnt get shaman gear and vice versa. The only "super lucky" fifth (or fourth in the case of some other bosses) drops were very rare epics or legendaries like Eye of Sulfuras. Yes theyll still be there.
---
3) Walk.

---
Exactly.
---
"Oh, look, another pixelated goatman in a poorly rendered version of Hell! He might just pop out of my Voodoo graphics card and kill me!" -Original Diablo.
---
AOE looting would have been a godsend in Classic but you have to realize 90% of the people in this sub never played it and are basing their decision off playing shitty private servers and watching videos of other dumbasses that never played either but make it seem like they were 2x HWL or GM in Classic.
---
And as you have already seen these same people are the ones that bring up mage AOE grinding and how it takes off, all of 3 seconds, of their grind time. 
---
Apparently nobody has ever had a mob fun up a hill and die. People make the claim that they want to see what dropped off each mob. Well what about the one you can't loot? What if there was an epic world drop on it?
---
Oh, I read that one wrong. This is the correct answer.
---
&gt;1. Is vanilla hard or just grindy? Or both? 
---
Both! But I need to elaborate on this because the development philosophy used back then isn't really common nowadays. As a Warrior, or a Rogue, you'd have to spend a whole afternoon fishing. You'd then spend that evening leveling up your cooking with that fish. All just so you could actually quest without having to take breaks every other pull, because the mobs you fight actually hit hard and you didn't have any self healing like you do in modern WoW with these classes. And if you pull more than 2, sometimes even more than 1 mob, you risk dying. That is all both grindy *and* hard. But most importantly, to many of us here on this sub, **it's rewarding!** Leveling your fishing doesn't feel like a chore, just like leveling your cooking. It can be tedious, yeah, but it feels relevant, it feels like you're doing something meaningful and it will have a direct impact when you go to level and quest. So there's a real sense of reward with the grindiness and the difficulty. 
---
&gt;2. Is it true that you have to level up weapons? 
---
Yes. All weapons and unarmed had a skill that rose the more you used it. As a Rogue, you might have really high or max dagger skill. You'd get a really nice Fist weapon in a dungeon, but you couldn't equip it because you'd have to go fight some creatures to level up your unarmed skill if you haven't been keeping up with it. This isn't a major issue really, and it's not hard to level these up, but it does take some time if you haven't touched your Sword skill in like 15 levels or something because you haven't been using swords. 
---
&gt;3. How do you get into dungeons if you cant queue into them?  I heard you need a key? 
---
Lol you walk up to them and enter through the portal. Even in Legion and BFA the dungeons exist in the real world, and you could fly to them and enter them manually, you just never need to. 
---
There are attunements though for certain dungeons/raids, and I'm not really qualified to elaborate on those, but yeah you have to do some questlines and finish some tasks to get the attunement key for some of these end-game instances. 
---
&gt;4. Are classes completely different from current WoW?
---
Oh yes. Rogues still stealth and stab things. But it's almost unrecognizable from the current version. Warriors still smash things, but they're **way** less independent in Classic and much more reliant on healers. They're way different and there's too many examples for me to even get in to.
---
&gt;I searched up her guide. Its basically Azeroth auto pilot.. if that is how you want to play just download the addon and zombie through the game at your leisure.
---
I think a lot of retail players are going to be surprised how much better Classic makes you feel than retail.  
---
...then I will smile happily as they cry for changes to make retail better
---
Find me a vanilla video of mage getting CC from every single aoe cast, because that's how it would work in any situation where you're hitting 20 things at once.  
---
For every one you link I'll link you 10 vanilla videos of mages not getting CC every cast. Here's two to get you started.

---
nah i don't want it to be changed, i was just stating its flaw from a numerical standpoint. i'd want the game to be exactly as it is, and then if it was a success for balance changes like this to happen way down the road. Balancing classic wow to have the feel and play both in world/dungeon/pvp
---
One of the best pvp vidz out their for sure
---
&gt; The community in game will be worlds better. 
---
worlds (of Warcraft)\* better.
---
There, fixed it for ya! =)
---
lolcerate
---
EM is better than NS.
---
It depends on what it is and how long you post it for
---
...the world needs more people like you
---
You're miss the point. These aren't new.
---
I'll support AOE looting for you if you promise to support my request for a QOL change.
---
In the same way that AOE looting would speed up the looting of mobs, so would giving my feral druid the Mangle talent.
---
Good to know - doesn't seem offensive, either. Just some playful banter, amiright?
---
As I've already explained, these guides were around DURING VANILLA. I also played Vanilla, this adds no weight to your opinion.
---
See. I need one that has like.... 6 buttons on the thumb instead of a crazy 12. I don't need that many, and it makes the  mouse look like a old cordless phone or something.
---
1. You played starting in Legion? How to put this.. You don't know what Hard or Grindy means. I'm not saying WoW is super hard or grindy. Not at all. I'm saying, you haven't played a MMORPG if you've only played Legion. They are different games. Not just different names/timelines/expansions. Different games.  
---
2. No. Play the game (private server) and learn how it works. Dont jump in when Classic comes out with those kind of questions... Your weapon skill goes up as you use the weapon, you dont have to level anything. You're worries are.. idk nonexistent? Would be the word.  
---
3. Instances are comprised of an Outer Entrance, typically looking like some sort of.. dungeon. Then inside, past the outside Elites and quest objectives you zone through the portal and enter the Instance. You run there with your group. You fight your way through the outer maze and find the portal. Run the dungeon. Then hearth or run the entire way back.   
---
4. This question is worded like the two things we're comparing are the same game. They are not. I suggest you read the simple Class descriptors [here](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Class) if for some reason you can't just go read the 1.12 spells and talents and compare them to the current game you play.
---
‚ÄúWell you‚Äôre about to make some‚Äù
---
*reveals classic wow*
---
Get a 12 button mouse like a Naga and learn to use it. Best investment in gaming I've made in a long time
---
I met all my online friends on Vanilla.
---
EM doesn‚Äôt affect healing spells and as an ele resto in PvP, you‚Äôre better off with NS. 
---
Clutch heals and clutch burst via NS will be superior, particularly when you have some decent crit % on your gear.
---
Bingo. Also, most "toys" in Classic, even TBC/WoTLK were rare, or took time/effort/planning to get.  
---
Common pets/gadgets weren't valued, and nobody cared if you had them. But the first person to, say, turn into a Furbolg and run around Stormwind - he/she was a legend for life!
---
Considering they say they want us to have a ‚Äúclassic summer‚Äù leads me to believe it will be released in the early months. We wouldn‚Äôt experience a classic summer to enjoy if it was after September release. July feels right. 
---
I don‚Äôt think they will stress test the servers either cause they already know what their servers can handle. They will only continue to test the servers internally for QA and friends and family maybe. 
---
If classic stays true to the server population numbers, even doubled, they know their servers will be able the handle it. So they just need to check raids, dungeons, and other bugs. I agree, the more people they have test the better, but most of the hard work has been done so they will have the time to double check everything. 
---
Honestly, I know folks want a release date to plan (myself included), I have a feeling blizzard will say, it‚Äôs time....enjoy.
---
That massively depends on the content stage you are in. Obviously assuming we are talking about the 1.7 talents - or in the case of classic the 1.12 ones.
---
My default a full 31 MM spec with only 5 points into BM to proc quick shots (from improved aspect of the hawk)
---
Yes 20 into BM can be more useful for certain fights when you know that your pet is not going to be in any danger and when your raids doesn't need the crowd control from clever traps and entrapment. As stated I'm coming from an alliance perspective where you don't have access to a totem slow for various fights. Entrapment is not on any DR till 2.1 so it is worth its weight in gold on fights like rag or nef to keep the adds contained and locked down in one place. Naxx forces you to change those points as Entrapment is a no go for Gluth (again from an alliance perspective)
---
Though in terms of naxx I only opted for 20 into BM on dps races during progress (fist weeks of patchwork and loatheb) and every time when you want to get the rogues and mages to cry on patchwork farm you could also go 20 into BM again.
---
The main reason for the SV talents is the low survivability of your pet in certain fights. Avoidance (the -90% aoe dmg passive) is not a thing in classic. A simple rain of fire or not quickly dispelled DoT can kill your pet within seconds and you don't really have the option to save it as Mend Pet is a channeled cast that doesn't perform nearly as good as the later versions we got used to from retail wow.
---
When your raid usually farms all old raids on top of the current content for goodies - or later to sell drops for guild gold - it was more useful to keep the utility in the raid over the boost to the poorly scaling pet.
---
ele shaman is very strong in just green stam/int. Ive seen a green geared ele 3s kill a r14 warrior
---
I‚Äôm okay with a toggle as long as they keep the old models intact, on live all the skeletons and animations got replaced with the new ones.
---
I hope they change the API last minute to screw up all the addons that will be made in the beta.
---
To answer your question..The quests text doesn't clearly explain most quests and you would literally spend 30 minutes to an hour just finding the correct location. We never had Questie in Vanilla or anything like it so most people would have thottbot open to alt tab and check the location of the quest. It's not every quest but each zone has a few quests like it.
---
TLDR: people don't want to spend hours just to find the location of a quest and then have to do it 1,000 more times while leveling.
---
This reminds me of the endless all-nighters I‚Äôd spend with my brothers just doing random shit on wow. It didn‚Äôt matter what we were doing, just that we were all together enjoying our definition of bonding time. I love Vanilla but man I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever get to just game with them all night again like we used to.
---
Dartol's.
---
Shaman, heal and go ele when you want a break
---
Nah I think you were in the wrong. Doesn‚Äôt matter what spec you guys are in, general rule so these arguments don‚Äôt happen is you roll on tank/dps items he rolls on healer items.
---
He was willing to heal the dungeon, which means he will heal other dungeons and it will help him.
---
You were willing to tank, and you will tank more dungeons.
---
Now if it drops and you said ‚Äúhey do you mind if I roll on this, I only have a grey item‚Äù he probably wouldn‚Äôt have cared. But if you just rolled need it gives off an impression of ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt care about others and are used to personal loot‚Äù.
---
If it isn‚Äôt suited for your current spec, always ask. Imagine a paladin healer just rolling on good 2hand items that drop when there is a arms warrior in the group raid, would cause an issue wouldn‚Äôt it.
---
But it‚Äôs lvl 20 so it‚Äôs not a big deal, lesson learned.
---
Rogue is more about managing 2-5min cooldowns, warrior is more execute spamming.
---
Nope, I think it's because I always played Horde and you can't skip Barrens when leveling... So I'm kinda of fed up with it by now.
---
Frost mage is the main one. Barrier/ward/blink/nova/iceblock... You could say pally is good just because they can bubble but really a pally in greens isn't going to put out that impressive healing. While a frostmage naked can still counterspell/poly/kite to make everyone miserable that can make a big difference in group pvp.  
---
Classes like spriest/druid/hunter/warlock can do well with just a blue pvp set and well itemised pieces, but in crappy greens they will have no survivability and will be dead to a couple of frostbolts or one kidneyshot/thistle tea. So it depends if you mean crappy gear or just 'they don't *need* T2+ epics' like warrior/ele shamy does.
---
So where is the line? How many % points of closeness can a story get to a particular culture before it's considered based on that culture? Enlighten us.
---
LOL. So true.
---
Since I'm not playing on private servers (as I refuse to incriminate myself, nor to support those actions) I don't have any left from back in the days. Though I'll get back to you if I can find something on youtube or twitch recordings
---
Let's not start calling that a slur. We are going to have people who come in and look around and then leave, and some will decide to stay.
---
I think even this reddit thread is evidence of that - it's been growing exponentially as the word gets out, this is the place to discuss WoW Classic.
---
My big thing is never taking damage. I played a gnome mage. I couldn't sustain my suspension of disbelief when I had bears whaling on me or leper gnomes infecting me with their terminal diseases.
---
Mage let me do that. I can kite, blink, and nova my way around while keeping my shiny armor shiny. Also I don't know how I'm gonna live life without portals, food, and slow fall.
---
Ugly female troll or ugly female orc?
---
Farming that sword is a blast for skinners
---
If you like healing but have never healed Vanilla‚Äîdo that. 
---
Mage and lock are primarily 1 button pve dps classes. Both have a debuff to keep up scorch/corruption and locks also keep a raid buffing curse on the target. What I‚Äôm telling you is you‚Äôre going to spend the night slamming 1 constantly. 
---
At the very least, healing is different every pull. You will want to use multiple spells of multiple ranks. You‚Äôll consider the 5 second rule the entire expansion, cancel casting is a thing. 
---
If you‚Äôre a lock/mage you‚Äôre just a dude. If you‚Äôre a healer, you‚Äôre the reason groups happen. People want to be your friend and you‚Äôll be able to find a group for most anything you like when you want to do it. Shaman PvP is super fun‚Äînot that mage/lock isn‚Äôt, but everyone has seen drake dog and vurtne and you‚Äôre likely not either‚Äîso again just another dude. But you get good at PvP healing, and it may not make for dank big crit videos, you‚Äôre the soul of your premades wins.
---
Oh and l mean look at those shaman sets. T1 and 2 are amazing.
---
Strange question, but can we have old character models with all other graphics modern?
---
Did blizzard say they will be using the same server names as before?
---
Tailoring and Enchanting
---
I bet you‚Äôll finish before you hit 40
---
Hey thanks for taking the time to type a thought out reply, unlike most here. I dont agree with you, and wonder what you think about this.. I am leveling as a Balance Druid, yet was tanking for that dungeon. You saying current role and leveling spec are separate things? You think he, a Feral Druid, had more right to Stam/Int gear simply because he chose to heal for that dungeon? Again, this isnt Looking for Dungeon tool retail WoW where people queue by clicking a role and, can only perform the role for which they are current talented into. This is Vanilla WoW. I, a Balance Druid, can tank just as well as that Feral Druid. The thing is, I shouldn't have to tell you or him that I am specced Balance, because Stam and Int are main stats for me while leveling.
---
I'm actually surprised I have yet to see more guild adverts requiring evidence of Vanilla experience. (I've seen a LOT of pserver exp req, and some Vanilla/Pserver).
---
Thank you so much
---
Very intelligent comment bud. Not finishing a raid can definitely be condensed to 2 raid slots, couldn't at all have to do with anything else. That's some powerful autism you live with.
---
I think you would make more even in Haiti
---
Thanks.  I plan on playing a NE priest.  Looking forward to it.
---
fear....then cast fear again when it breaks.

---
People act like they care about quality content in the sub, then for no reason at all shit on a very well written and informative post.
---
I can tell you spent a lot of time on this. It was very well done. You started by giving me the fundamental knowledge I needed to grasp the concepts, and then taught me some great shit.
---
Well done. Saved the post. I look forward to using this when classic drops. Thanks man!
---
Yeah... I haven't always been a first-rate citizen, but when I am, I still call PvE servers "carebear"
---
i prefer Tauren, i like the animations, size and that your racials are a healthy mix of both pve and pvp. But what ever catch your eyes more, that what you should play.
---
I don't mind it.
---
Classes went through changes in vanilla, but warlocks only really got nerfed. Then there was hardly any changes or updates to the class at all. They became known as the mushrooms since they were forgotten about in a dark place.
---
Same. I'm also glad I won't run around Elwynn Forest dying to armies of murlocks while looking for an Archmage in some faraway city called Stormwind
---
I'm not a lock player but I can make some suggestions.
---
1. Your pet is going to determine the fight. If you want to beat a rogue you're gonna want a VW and to be SL to be able to survive.
---
2. Mages you want your felhunter to eat their shields and buffs and cast their counterspell or whatever the spell is called.
---
3. Hunters you will probably want a VW or succubus to CC the hunter while you kill the pet. If you see a big read animal running your way it might be easier to stick your head between your legs and kiss your ass goodbye.
---
I don't do a lot of PvP so someone else probably has better suggestions.
---
As I remember it, even people who legitimately liked raiding in Vanilla, raided primarily to PvP better.
---
On Arthas, a bunch of the guilds who casually made it through bwl, had it on farm, nbd, struggled with aq and naxx cause they required effort from players, being specced right, using consumables started to become needed. Arthas was full of pvpers, a lot of DAoC players landed there, famous wow movies like world of roguecraft, Maydie, hulk smash, pat, roaming PvP night, ioneye were all from there. Entire guilds would raid then split into 2-3 wsg teams or ab teams and premade twice as long as we all spent raiding. Raid gear was primarily dolled out for PvP needs. 
---
Anyhow I guess my point is, PvP was all the rage, it was what you did at 60 if not grinding for raids, which was what you did to get better gear to PvP with.
---
the corsair one is solid too.
---
r/woosh
---
Swear by my g600, absolute beast of a mouse and has lasted me over 6 years of mmo gaming.
---
This always confuses me because I see people go both ways on this. Some people say ele is not gear dependent at all, and others say that they are worthless without gear.
---
If you were really fancy you had one of these:
---

---
Karazhan too I believe.
---
For me it was around lvl 26. I was still "trying out the game" with my first character, which I had created with a very dumb name, expecting to try something else. Suddenly, I found myself facing a group of Elites in a tower, and I needed some weird orbs, and some dudes head, and these dudes were rocking me. Then a lvl 60 paladin shows up, laughs, invites me to group and destroys the whole place for me. I considered starting a new toon for all of 15 seconds before I realized that I NEEDED to continue this toon, if only because not only I had invested in it myself, but now someone else had, too...
---
Yeah, right? People nowadays even record fake reactions to trailers they watch.
---
Until people start hitting 60 regularly. Mat rush.
---
I need to whip up a playlist for each sesh. Work out what podcasts I'll be enjoying (BluPlz most likely).
---
If I can tell what culture you are emulating then it is too close.
---
You even said it yourself, aboriginal could literally mean anything there are tons of cultures like that around the globe it could be anyone.
---
Kung fu panda is China and the theme is China and it feels really fucking shoehorned in.
---
I haven't played WoW in many years, but doesn't all of the original content still exist in the current game? Did they get rid of stuff?
---
Even if that is true. 260 Euro/month is still no laughing matter. At this point seeing all these. I‚Äôm just about ready to gift subs to as many people as I can. Those whom can‚Äôt afford it of course. 
---
I will be starting a post about this soon to help those in need. And to me it won‚Äôt be about ‚Äúthrowing away‚Äù my money. I‚Äôve thrown away my money to others less deserving of it. Like BFA or hell even EA. At least this will make a bunch of kids somewhere happier for a longer period of time than it made me with the bunch of incomplete rubbish being chucked out as ‚Äúgames‚Äù by companies. 
---
The social aspect of WoW in BFA is pretty much more than dead. I‚Äôm just doing my part to make sure Classic is as lively as ever.
---
Order of character list huh. I didn‚Äôt think about that
---
Pretty sure EVERYONE is going to be a "vanilla vet" - even if they are 12 years old.
---
1. both
---
2. Yes. Get familiar with the mobs in blasted lands. There is a quest mob that cannot be killed without being on the quest. You can level up on them. And you get to do this for each weapon type you use or will use.
---
3. talk to other people.
---
4. I don't know I don't play garbage games.
---
This type of joke doesn‚Äôt even fit here... what are you doing?
---
This guy fucks
---
Maybe I'm in the minority here, but I turn off voice in any game that has proximity voice chat.
---
Tons of people don't use push to talk so you hear all sorts of garbage ranging from music to coughing to heavy breathing to yelling at mom because she got the wrong brand of tendies.
---
Then you run into the people who are just deliberately annoying because they want attention. They get into all sorts of profanity and slurs because they think it's edgy and cool. I don't need to hear a bunch of 12 year olds talking about fucking moms on proximity voice chat.
---
Lots of people have terrible mics too which makes all of the above 10 times worse.
---
Now imagine you're in a populated area, all of a sudden it isn't just one, but six children all screaming over each other.

---
You're not going to run many dungeons without an off-spec healer until you get to 60.
---
We don‚Äôt have to agree, everyone has different opinions, but as a vanilla player here would be my thoughts.
---
Yes you are balance spec but IIRC I can‚Äôt inspect you and see your talents or spec. If you sign up as a tank I assume you are leveling feral, so if you say I‚Äôm balance but I‚Äôll tank it could come off as ‚ÄúI just want to roll on everything‚Äù.
---
To save some arguments come classic, if you want to level as boomkin just dungeon as boomkin. Yes you might have to start your own groups sometimes but it‚Äôs a totally different scenario if you join a party as dps and they can‚Äôt find a tank, so you step up as a tank. Everyone will understand that you don‚Äôt want tank/dps items and will be rolling on caster gear.
---
Just because you can use every stat, some classes don‚Äôt. And a big misconception is you HAVE to get some items in a dungeon. There‚Äôs been tons of runs where I‚Äôve passed on a item even if t was a upgrade for me because someone else needed it more, WoW classic is all about community and teamwork. You pass on a item and make someone happy, they add you and a week later they pass on a item to make you happy, it‚Äôs all karma.
---
Just my thoughts :)
---
I didn‚Äôt play a Druid, but priest downranks and cancel casts heavily.

if you want to sell, you greed it. That's the whole point of "Greed"

Forgot about that.

...anything a gnome does is "short" \*eye-roll\*
---
I feel like this is the correct answer. I made more friends from classic/TBC than I could have expected.
---
It does

[removed]
---
I didn't say that at all. I said everything in fiction is based on reality. MoP is based on china and Tauren are based on native American culture.
---
...they might not know how to do that
---
Absolutely yes, it's grindy not hard. Those here saying otherwise are kinda full of themselves. 
---
Mechanically, vanilla is easy and simple compared to retail. Your gear matters more, whereas in retail knowing a more complex rotation matters more because gear acquisition is smooth and abundant. 
---
Classes have more character though. They each provide something only they can provide.
---
Second all of this, enhance is a blast
---
If we're talking about dungeons where people are farming preraid gear, yes, obviously you should ask before rolling on gear outside your ROLE. But we are talking &lt; lvl45 here. A Ret Pally could heal any dungeon but, you'll be that pissy warrior bitching when he loses on STR gear?
---
There are many native cultures that are similar to the Tauren, but can you name them? Point out who they are? No, it is more ambiguous.
---
Pandaren were rammed in there to appeal to the Chinese market and it was not a good fit IMO.
---
As an almost full BIS warrior pre naxx, I was constantly kited and killed by high skill mages and warlocks in greens/blues. If I used engineering trinkets, grenades, free action pots, etc, they died in like 2 hits though
---
I found my dream mouse while playing wow, the Logitech G5. I bought 3 and prayed they'd last forever. After losing or wearing them out over the years I ran out of my mice and was disappointed by the offerings Logitech had for me. After a long search I found a mouse with identical dimensions, weight and button placement as my trusty G5, the Roccat Kone EMP. If you want to go back to your G5 this is the mouse for you. It even improves the mouse by making the scroll wheel better.
---
Most immersice starting zone imo
---
Honestly, I lost all my online friends to Cataclysm, even ended up becoming guild lead of a dead guild. Eventually after going solo through MoP (and missing half of MoP due to IRL stuff) all my best friends now came from WoD.
---
Warlords of mother-truckin' Draenor
---
The absolute lack of stuff has given me friends that have patience and TRY to have fun. As much as I will always hate on WoD every chance I get, dang I gotta say I'm glad WoD happened.
---
Only one still plays, but I still talk to a few of them. A few have vanished during Legion, some I still dont know what happened. And one is a tragic story I wont go into here...
---
What's my point? I forgot. So bring on the Classic!
---
Wow. Good for you. It's not easy to try and help people, especially when you know you're being taken advantage of. Props dude.  
---
Actually reminds me of Judas - Jesus fed the dude, washed his feet and prayed over him, all the while knowing he'd already betrayed him.
---
1. Both, everything takes longer and the world is Kore dangerous so you can't just pull a whole zone and aoe them down. (With some exceptions like mage or prot paladin but they have downtime between those pulls)
---
2. You have to level up your weapon skill, think of this like training to become.more comfortable with a weapon, most of this happens during levelling and you can easily boost level them in blasted lands.
---
3. You walk to the entrance, certain dungeons require keys (scholomance, UBRS and scarlet cathedral come to mind) these can be obtained either through quests or drops from specific mobs (rogues can also pick certain doors)
---
4. They aren't *COMPLETELY* different and some classes share a lot with their retail counterparts but, this is a broad question and would need to be more specific to properly answer.
---
The way I would describe it is vanilla has a higher skill floor but a lower skill ceiling, basic tasks are more difficult but at the highest level retail wow is far more mechanically difficult.
---
Love silicon valley!
---
Do your research. At the very least due extensive research into each class to make an informed decision into what you'll enjoy. The leveling process is long and the endgame even longer.
---
Don't worry about racials. My play group wants to go alliance, and I main warlock. So the obvious choice for performance is gnome. However, I can't stand staring at gnomes so I'm going human. 
---
Be friendly and helpful. Your reputation WILL follow you. From level 1 to 60 and beyond. So keep that in mind.
---
I hope this was helpful and not just a broken record. See you in Azeroth!
---
How it looked in Vanilla since this is a Classic WoW discussion, right?
---
It doesn't matter anyway though. Any player who played with old models/animation and enjoyed them had that stripped in Legion. It was no longer an option to continue playing your character as they were.
---
Many players felt like they no longer recognized their characters that they had played for years.
---
Bahahahaha
---
No. It‚Äôs not confirmed to happen either, but it‚Äôs likely. At Blizzcon, during the section about feature choices, they talked about sharding. They said, there‚Äôs obvious ‚Äúno‚Äù features, like LFR, duh it‚Äôs not in Classic. ...But, some things such as loot trading and sharding may be used to assist the game.
---
The example they used mentioned using sharding for *starting areas*. It‚Äôs unclear whether they meant the 1-5 tutorial hub or the whole 1-10 starting zone. However they only used that as an example, so we don‚Äôt know *how far* Blizzard is going to take it. Personally, I‚Äôm a little worried about it, since modern server stability is good, but it can‚Äôt handle huge loads of players. 2 40 mans can easily crash the retail game. So, if Crossroads in Barrens is the most populated place, and EVERYBODY on the Horde is in that small area, it‚Äôs possible they would be forced to shard, to save the game from crashing.
---
On one hand, cool, the game didn‚Äôt crash... but I want the sharding BS to be over and done with past level 10, so I can get to the real *world* of Warcraft. Not a glued together hobbled jumble of phases. I‚Äôm reeeeaally hoping we get news on it soon.
---
They did a fine enough job. It they hadn't, wow wouldn't have become the most popular mmo by far the world has ever seen
---
I would prefer this over going through the expansions again. I liked how BC made every class tree more viable, but a whole new world was a terrible decision.
---
There are many cultures in china. Can you name them?
---
I'm with you I've seen both sides upvoted here. FWIW, on an instant60 server with free blues of your choice, I geared a 30/0/21 shaman in all blues (prioritizing spell power/crit &gt; Stam &gt; int) and still blew people up who had epics in BGs.
---
I thought I was the only one with an oddball keyboard setup like that. For me it's 
---
O - left strafe
---
P - forward
---
[ - right strafe
---
I put my major keybinds on 5 - backspace and remap the windows key and the one to the right to be shift and ctrl. Not sure why I did this but I was able to raid hardcore and do well in PvP this way.
---
I think they leave it untouched.  You have had private servers with people playing Vanilla WoW for the past 12 years, they didn‚Äôt burn out on content.  Since Blizzard is not charging extra money above retail for this version of the game, I am not sure how much financial backing it is going to get for new content.
---
&gt;  i couldnt imagine being 60 and stuck on a PvE server.
---
You can't imagine because you've never been 60 on a pve server. If you had, you would realize that it's pretty easy to find world pvp
---
I think on private servers, the demand/supply is unrepresentative. The hardcore raiding scene is perhaps 2-3x larger than a retail server should be... but as far as I‚Äôm aware, the Black Lotus spawn rates were jacked up much higher than that, to beyond compensate. It‚Äôs a full hour cooldown for the Black Lotuses, so it‚Äôs harder to just camp a couple spots and farm them.
---
Just curious, how do you strafe if you use "Q/E" for keybinds?
---
Retail wow, when in combat is much better than classic‚Äîat least dps is. Even with say shadowpriest, who does a lot of damage currently, the button pressing is unfun (it is certainly more fun than classic spriest, however). Tanking though is much less fun. When was the last time tanks minded anything revolving threat? Healing is a spam game, Vanilla healing was measured and methodical, mana pools drained quicker than they did in early Cata. 
---
But outside of raiding, the retail game blows. It‚Äôs an obvious gear pi√±ata that try‚Äôs to clearly make things up for you to do everyday while logged in. 
---
Vanilla wow had a raid lockout and a PvP system. Every other motivation players had was created, essentially, by themselves. Why do I grind Azerite each day? Cause I am told to else I fall behind (but what‚Äôs that matter there will be some inevitable catch up mechanic). When you hit 60, pre raid blues were relevant, whether you played in 2005 or 06, as a fresh 60 you needed blues to get to mc. You needed mc/zig to go into bwl, if you didn‚Äôt want life to be miserable you wanted (some) bwl/mc/zig gear to progress in PvP, and if you wanted to raid aq, well you needed a full bwl set. Naxx? Same follows. 
---
Catch up mechanics weren‚Äôt free, they were intermediate raids or long quests to upgrade gear. 
---
With no flying, no dailies infusing artificial gold into the system, and useful crafting materials scattered in zones from level 40ish onwards, people had to get out into the world. And we fought, talked, grouped together. 
---
Naxx May have been the pinnacle, but if you got an upgraded weapon, you‚Äôd be going to stratholme‚Äîthe same place fresh 60s needed. Want to make flasks? Better have a bwl lockout or you‚Äôre forming a scholo group. Need some tubers for raid? You‚Äôll be in a zone with 49-53 characters. 
---
We were bred to hate those red fuckers. Many people pursued endgame content so they could get gear to smash in the faces of the opposite faction better. We didn‚Äôt need incentives beyond ‚Äúkill the dragons once a week, get the gear, kill the alliance‚Äù. 
---
Then, let‚Äôs be honest, there is nostalgia. I quit with the end of mop, so I‚Äôve still got more wow memories in the old world than the post Cata one. Old world Azeroth is a place I know in better detail than the town I went to high school in.
---
I think the torch dungeon idea was an April fools joke.
---
They did a fantastic job given the incredible popularity of the game
---
Roccat Kone EMP
---
Wow classic is going to suck for you then.
---
The massive quality of life improvements from all the class revamps are gonna be in from day 1
---
You assume a lot. I was on Kadgar US during vanilla.
---
Yes you have mandarin, Cantonese, Mongolian, Hong Kong and Taiwanese cultures and even some Muslim cultures.
---
However, this is not a one to one comparison.
---
Tauren live in a grassy plain and worship gods and live in teepees, that is the only part of the lore that is comparable.
---
No special classes, a whole expac or anything just a simple nod with a lot of generic overtones.
---
Pan Daria was pulled out of their ass and it should not have been an expac.
---
If anything it‚Äôll boost their subs by a considerable amount. My guess is that a considerable number of people that played in the vanilla/TBC era no longer play or at a minimum have come back for each expansion only to unsub again.
---
I personally lean towards seeing new content made with the spirit of vanilla in mind but if they don‚Äôt then I‚Äôm still okay with that.
---
I was on medivh. Never felt "trapped". When I wanted to do world pvp, I had zero problem finding out.
---
LMAO I'm almost ashamed at how much i love both of these comments.
---
Except that my friends are just as hype.
---
I think Cata was way better at the start and sucked during the end.
---
Fuck em dude who cares
---
they're fun to play, that seems to be enough for most people.
---
Lol, the short answer is yes, tons of comical miss information on this thread, but yes both the eye of divinity and eye of shadow will be super easy to get with some patience if you are UK na raiding guild and have some friends out of raid. Hell you can even just buy the eye of shadow off the AH Haha. 
---
I would venture to say that there will be a benediction within two weeks of classic release made by some player.
---
1. Both. Its not Grindy as in, you have to kill 2000 boars here and there. You can level 1-60 without having to actually grind much at all. But it does take along time, and every kill takes longer. It‚Äôs also harder. You might die more times in 1-10 than 1-80 on retail. 2 mobs when you‚Äôre not prepared is a risk, and you have to use your kit to survive.
---
2. Yes, and Defense skill. Every level your cap raises by 5, so a level 1 caps at 5/5 for all skills, level 10 is 50/50, 60 is 300/300.
---
3. You form a group and run there. If you have a warlock and two helpers, they can summon. Some dungeons DO need a key, but very few. 
---
4. Yes, almost entirely. You may change your mind about what class you enjoy many times between 10-20, and that‚Äôs okay.
---
Honestly, 13 years of playing and a bit of P Server experience and this is the first time I'm hearing that it ever did damage.
---
Though fun fact in 6.1 the campfire got a new model and now gets placed where you click instead of being random
---
Yes, I'm an absolute monster!
---
They seem to keep doing that too, feasts did that in WoD and Legion. Man people got amazing screenshots of ridiculous stunts. They caught it before launch this time in BFA though :P
---
Really? Druids and rogues gank me while questing anytime I multi pull or start to aoe farm
---
That's an interesting concept - I might have to try this one. I've been quite partial to "esdf" myself just because ctrl/shift/alt is easier to reach while using control movements to drop instants, pop CD's, buffs or useable items. But seems like it could be quite deadly if programmed right!
---
Aww, dude, re-releasing Classic WoW?! AAAGH!
---
Summer 2019?! AAAGH...UGHHGH...
---
While leveling, old talents ruled. As WoW is a game exclusively focused on the max level experience (and has been since the first leveling nerf in Bc) the new mop talent system is miles better for actual content like progression raiding, competitive arena play, and now high end m+. 
---
Now maybe not every spec has hit the mark, but priest has multiple talent builds per spec used in the same raid. We‚Äôve got talents we use in PvP, some that are better while in the world. 
---
It feels hollow while leveling, I agree. But having to go respec to pick up a talent I need for one particular hard mode boss sucks. If sucks to the point that most people didn‚Äôt do it. When dual spec came out, most raiders put their fight dependent spec on the alt spec, not a different role. 
---
The new talent system, despite my enjoyment of the old while leveling (at least we had it for Vanilla and Bc when leveling was a thing blizzard embraced) is one of the few good additions wow made to the game as it changed. Does it fit with vanilla wow? No. Do the talent trees fit in retail wow? Absolutely not.
---
Am I retarded or is may 16th still 3 weeks away?

That is not entirely true. Check out [this side-by-side comparison](https://i.imgur.com/aOqqoCP.jpg).

The night elves are considerably more muscular and have very  different ears, eyebrows, and noses.

I've used a Logitech mouse ever since vanilla released - it's come a long way, and with current programable options, it's a thing of beauty, especially when combined with one of their keyboards. Almost limitless possibilities!

I agree with you. They already confirmed summer, so just make the date at the end of summer and take all the time they need. But give us a date lol.
---
From the Warcraft RPG books:
---
&gt;Tauren are, in a word, stoic, embodying the strong and silent type with their quiet contemplation. This introspective air combined with their immense size can lead a person to understand as to "why" many regard the tauren as a wise and dangerous race. Tauren rarely speak unless there is a true reason to, preferring to act instead of talk. However, once a tauren has learned to interact with a companion, there seems to be a more open and enthusiastic exchange of words. Since tauren warm slowly to non-tauren, they are usually silent and may sometimes appear brooding.
---
But come on, we both knew that already. The stoic, proud Native American trope is their primary feature.
---
Probably cause they don‚Äôt want to commit the 3000 or so quests in Vanilla wow to memory. 
---
Loads of folks don‚Äôt like reading or doing word math problems either. Reading a bunch of fantasy text and picking out the quest details is a experience unto itself, many people don‚Äôt like that part as they likely see questing as a guise to get you to kill mobs and aren‚Äôt into the role playing aspect as much as they are the progression aspect.
---
Love this

This deserves gold... once they release the server names well talk. Going alliance druid and my boy going ally Warlock

Mmmmm, boys made of soy....

...wait

I envy you
---
It most certainly does. I remember buying gold back in cata, having all gold taken from me and a note in my mailbox saying" hey retard, do it again you're banned" by a gm. Not literally but that was the jist. 
---
I bought gold like 5 times prior to that tho throughout wotlk and they never caught on. So iunno. It definitely can happen tho
---
I've even worked up a list of exercises I'm gonna do while taking the gryphon to and from places. Gotta stay fit while playing WoW or else I'll just morph into the couch.
---
&gt; But in a raid, its just better to do one thing really well rather than 2 things average.
---
IMO you want both, specialized players and flexible players, because it gives you the most options while retaining enough efficiency.
---
I personally tank, dps and heal/decurse with a feral spec in 5mans and raids depending on the situation. Sometimes I even do all of these things in a single fight. For example tanking adds then DPSing on the boss, switching to healing the tank and inervating a Priest because something happened.
---
Feral and HotW druids are flexible and can help out on "oh shit" moments very well when content is not on farm. They are basically there to fill holes and make up for mistakes. When everyone is playing perfectly after weeks of practice and is starting to get overgeared then you don't need that as much. But for the harder, early parts its really good.
---
It is just as true for raids than it is for 5mans because the mechanics there are more deadly. Just in 5mans it is more noticeable and people don't run their DPS/healing meters to determine performance. 
---
The mentioned HotW+NS build can do that too, allthough the heal/decurse part is better while DPS is worse than with Feral.
---
Here is Skarm doing exactly this in AQ40. Note that AQ40 is on farm here so the bosses go down easy, but imagine it wasn't and you had this flexibility. It is really useful:

---
Obviously I‚Äôm biased, but I think it‚Äôs superior. My pinky rests on ‚Äòe‚Äô and my thumb on ‚Äòm‚Äô.  These are all very bound to high priority, high frequency instant spells, aspects and stings.  I use an excel spreadsheet to track everything.  ‚Äò8‚Äô for example, requires you to take a finger off a movement key, for this reason it‚Äôs bound to aimed shot, as you can‚Äôt move and cast this spell at the same time.  I have a blank excel  spreadsheet I could post if there is any interest

Warcraft was never remotely "grounded". You can dislike it, and prefer vanilla's style, but if anything modern wow is *more* reminiscent of the completely exaggerated or cartoony styles of the original games.
---
Like I said we don‚Äôt have to agree, but you have to understand people have different viewpoints, hence why you got kicked and the group broke.

Just ask before you roll if it‚Äôs not your dungeon role, it‚Äôs simple :)

That sound of hooves in the complete absense of other noise is starting to give me anxiety after 30mins of watching, it's like as if the world ended and there was only you and a galloping horse left in the void.
---
Having a resto Shaman in a caster/healer group is super useful. Especially with Warlocks to lower their threat (Warlock threat is very high in vanilla), or for Priests so they don't go OOM in harder fights.
---
I‚Äôm not seeing the connection between noob and the rogue who knows enough and is concerned enough about getting the most out of his character that he downloads a mod rocket track energy regen ticks. That‚Äôs like...the opposite of a noob. It‚Äôs unreasonable to expect a rogue player to have an internal clock that starts ticking when he loses energy. 
---
I will agree that questie objectively makes leveling a more casual experience, and a vanilla noob will get the biggest benefit from it.
---
Yes I‚Äôm so small minded, obviously you are a mop fanboy.
---
Why does it mean so much to you?
---
They aren‚Äôt. I loved my guildies. For 5 years, I would log onto vent before getting on and if there wasn‚Äôt anyone to talk to wouldn‚Äôt log in. Had a few of their numbers. They were not real friends.
---
Can online friends help extremely nervous/asocial people to build social skills? Sure. Can you have fairly strong friendships? Absolutely. Do some people meet up and even marry online friends? Yep. But for the vast, vast majority of online friends, they are a complement to ‚Äòreal‚Äô friends, not a supplement. Anyone relying solely on online friends for companionship will not feel as complete as someone with real people in their lives.
---
I talked to many of those guildies for several hours a day, for years straight. Probably more than most of my real friends. But that doesn‚Äôt make them real friends themselves.
---
Yeah I know, if you have extra shamans that's a great idea.
---
I'm fully intrigued - if you could post to Google docs I'd love to look at that when I get home. I've been casually studying keybindings/macros in hopes to avoid certain wrist/arm pain while maximizing my response times

If gold sellers want to grind in the world, subject to global respwan rates and the wrath of other players and an easy eye from blizzard for botting behavior...let them grind. Catch them and the purchasers and ban them for that.

oh shit.  i found this post while searching for a pic of Mynis for Darckli.
---
I was the druid that single buffed in that pic =P
---
Oh hey, I was Zeksagmak back then.  I remember you from BG groups
---
derk?
---
That is only part of the problem.
---
Generally if you are doing progression raids w/o being overgeared then healers can very well go OOM in harder fights, especially Priests. Except if they farmed runes the whole week. But sure if you run Ony/MC in full pre-raid BiS then your healers don't go OOM.
---
Also there are mechanics that aren't always perfectly avoided. Maybe some guy is tired or distracted or w/e and does some kind of mistake etc. These things also drain healer mana super quickly.
---
Then there are simply fights that are taxing on healers in general because it is hard-hitting bosses or AoE damage etc.
---
Only problem actually becomes their threat - they have no way to permanently reduce threat. I have a friend who was an amazing ret pally in vanilla. Ranked up to 12/13 that way, I forget... Lt. Commander? I think that was his highest rank, dunno what that really was.  
---
Anyway, he always had to hold back max dps because nobody could hold aggro on him, even with blessing of salvation. Did pretty good dps, but could never top meters because his threat was always too high.
---
Well as long as they do what they did with raids and resistance gears I think it's kind of feasible but it would be insanely hard to do
---
I made more friends in Classic/TBC as a keyboard turning dumbass than I did as a top percentile raider in the more modern expansions. The game was just way more social back then, (most) people didn't care about speedrunning dungeons or raids or pushing the limit of the game - we were all there to have a good time.
---
^^^and ^^^good ^^^times ^^^were ^^^indeed ^^^had.
---
yeah pvp ns is better, else em.
---
Nope, still no idea what class, talent spec, race, profession to play. At least I know pvp, and rp-pvp of available.
---
Exct
---
Mop is actually the only expansion that I didn't play at all, but yeah im a fanboy. You're just uncultured swine.
---
what private server currently has Naxx out and an active raiding population? 
---
Oh right. Shut the hell up
---
Sure, the major, and obvious drawback is removing a lot of low priority keybindings, like ‚Äòm‚Äô for map, b, for bags, etc.  my personal philosophy is that these things can be moved to the edges of the keyboard, as living and dying in pvp/pve does not require you to suddenly and quickly open your talents page.  If you can cope with that, and realize you naturally learn the keys as you level.
---
Back when dm cards were a thing to get every early expansion as a progression raider, people got banned every expansion. We‚Äôd hear about guys of similar wowprogress rank have a member can 30 day (or perms bans) for buying gold. 
---
I‚Äôve done it twice, both for pre raid bis trinkets.
---
i would like to add. Game is slow paced, time consuming and it has delayed gratification. Enjoy it and take your time to make friends and explore the world in your way.
---
It‚Äôs funny that when you say standard vanilla music we all know exactly what that means
---
Ok, I'm not speaking from first-hand experience, but I had a friend who absolutely wrecked (still does) with a ret pally. I don't know how many times he would catch people in a 6 second stun, and they would be dead before it finished. He would duel all the time, and refused to use his bubble, preferring to learn how to beat players without it. In PvE, he was a wrecking ball, but unfortunately, even with another pally to bless Salvation, his threat was always too high. I think the biggest lim-fac for retadins, is they do a ton of spell damage, which draws tons of threat. So you have to monitor your judgements, and typically he would nerf his DPS just to avoid pulling aggro.
---
you have a .5s window after each tick to use an ability (to expend as much energy as possible, because it doesn't carry over), shift out, and shift back in. Shifting out is off GCD but shifting is not, so you have to have good ping and awareness of your energy ticks.

Oh no, to be a tourist, to prefer moderation in one's video games, to try out an older game not out of nostalgia nostalgia but because you respect it's lineage, to enjoy things for awhile, then eventually move on when your ready to try something new in life.

All classes are viable, only warriors can really tank, if you can heal, odds are you‚Äôre healing. Compared to retail many mechanics are less intuitive and combat mechanics, characters and bosses and less simple, yet often more deadly (especially by the raids or undergeared 50+). 
---
With that you know all you need to make a decision once you boot the game up and start reading the lore/fluff differences between the races/classes. 
---
Don‚Äôt spoil the adventure by reading what a bunch of us nerds who never moved on have been thinking up for the last 15 years. Come back and find guides for endgame around level 45 (that‚Äôs about 1/2 way time and xp wise) once you have a handle on the game and know sorta what you wanna get up to at max level.
---
ow yes, there will be hardcore pve:ers and pvp:ers on all sorts on realms
---
it was i have only played some private servers o i dont really have any experience from vanilla, thanks buddy
---
Watch some basic class guide and beginner guide videos. From there narrow down what faction, role and class appeals to you. New players this time around really have an advantage with the shear amount of information available.

No that‚Äôs about right. I‚Äôm saying, if they do give us 2 month notice and are having a July release, may 16 is the deadline for that release date. And getting a release date 3 weeks from now is pretty damn soon, relatively speaking.

The best geared druid with the strongest hot gets a buff in the meters because they can use their hots and not have it overwritten, for those forgetting. Druids may not always do well on meters, but mostly because they're hot based, and if they don't get hots they're at a disadvantage.

Hi, /u/_SweepTheLeg_
---
For me, a quest helper addon is super useful in vanilla for those quests that aren't super specific with their locations. Also, sometimes I just get confused, and end up going to the wrong place. However, I still read the quests and still have fun exploring. The quest helper addon is just there for when I really need the help, and the one I use can be turned on/off in the UI.
---
They could probably stretch Classic to 3-4 years. I honestly don‚Äôt see them releasing patches until they need to. They‚Äôre going to milk this thing and I‚Äôm 100% behind them.
---
I seriously don‚Äôt want people to be clearing Nax after 3 months of release. Make people wait on patch releases and progress slowly through content.
---
My god you're poorly spoken.
---
My very old memory here, so take it with a grain of salt:
---
No, weapon effects like sulfuras mostly worked like a spell effect.  It could proc off of things that procced an addition physical attack like Ironfoe, Hand of Justice, and Flurry axe.
---
Hold key (default shift) to loot everything was in. Checkbox to autoloot everything was a feature added in 2.0 I'm pretty sure, champ.

---
A lot to think about, but I‚Äôve always been a bit of a last second crammer anyway. Can‚Äôt wait to start the real battle planning.
---
Vanilla was the best at this - one of the elements that was lost in TBC was the arena grind for season gear. This lead to a lot of players becoming "PvP only" rather than playing PvE content. In fact, for several classes, PvP gear was actually superior to PvE gear, with the only exception being for +hit.  
---
But before that nonsense, the only PvP grind for gear was nearly impossible! Ranking up was mostly a solo achievement, and took most players months to get. A lot of folks were banned for account sharing while making a push, and most people who made Grand Marshall were accused of it anyway, as few could back it up by dominating in duels, etc.  
---
So for most players, PvE was the best, or even the only way they could keep up with player power. This caused all sorts of grief in raids, however, as many players would spec talent trees optimized for PvP. And in Vanilla, spec mattered a lot, and cost a significant amount to change (50 gold wasn't easy to come by).  
---
So get ready for quite a bit of contreversy, especially on PvP servers - but it's all part of the fun and excitement of the game! (As long as people don't freak out over loot distribution because they HAVE to have that dagger because it's BiS PvP even though it's a 1% DPS increase for me but 9% DPS increase for the next guy...)

Great post. Thanks. Do you think druids can be strong at PVP with a 29/11/11 spec (for feral charge and insect swarm) with the dungeon 2 set? I‚Äôm not interested in raiding. Is the PvP set better?
---
I posted the blank one, so you can‚Äôt see my own preferences, but some abilities i think it‚Äôs more convenient to stack vertically, same key different modifiers. I do this for aspects and stings because I wouldn‚Äôt ordinarily hit those in rapid succession.  Then some stacked horizontally, on nearby keys, with the same modifiers for stuff would be used in succession, ie scatter shot on ‚Äòj‚Äô and feign death on ‚Äòk‚Äô

As someone who loves shamans and paladins and pvp realms im having some real heartbreaks this summer

MMORPGs DEPEND on these guys. If we can capture their numbers we can flip the MMO genre on its head.

We need to show that there is a demand for MMOs and they need to be mirrored after the grind that WoW is. No more of this instant gratification shit.
---
I generally defer to main spec need rolls but also don‚Äôt tell people what unwritten rules they should abide by either.  If I was the healer and you beat me so be it as long as you‚Äôll wear it
---
Super interesting and definitely curious to see it in action on Classic.  
---
How difficult is it to weave in melee attacks during cooldowns, manage your pet and stay outside of the deadzone?  Seems challenging to run in and get your melee off while also strafing back out to get shots on the boss and staying out of cleaves.
---
Haha this was during a time where they didn't to faction transfers and all my friends had re rolled Horde. I couldn't be arsed starting again and decided to do this...

Many thanks!

Do you perhaps have a gif of you performing this rotation? It's a little hard to envision.

Just a tip for you shamans out there, taran ice breaker doesn't have an intern cd and is hella cheap on the ah 90% of the time
---
I need the release date just so my gaming buddies will start to gear up and get ready. Without a damn date everyone is stuck in Limbo and doesn‚Äôt want to wait an entire other year for the game to come out.
---
Also, I‚Äôd like to take some time off but I know realistically it won‚Äôt happen...
---
Don't be afraid to ask for help. You might get a lot of annoying responses, but eventually someone will help. In fact, the best way to get information in-game, is to state something you know isn't true.   
---
For instance: if you ask in /1 "Hey, where can I find a class trainer?" you'll see a ton of responses like "Ask Thrall" or "In your mom's house"  
---
So instead, say: /1 "I was told I need a lvl 60 warrior to train me, where can I find one?" and you'll get responses like "you're stupid, go ask a guard to find a class trainer"  
---
It's insulting, but it's also accurate. And if someone gives a close, but incorrect answer, someone else will instantly correct them. (This is even better). So, say for instance you ask "what's the quickest way to Ironforge?" and someone responds by saying "Just run" someone else will say "use the flight path" and someone else will say "actually the IF tram is much quicker" and someone else will say "buy a mage portal" (which is actually the fastest but usually least cost effective, as most mages charge 1g for a portal).  
---
Don't be afraid to use the tooltips to start out! And try messing with keybindings early on, so you can get used to making changes as you progress and learn new abilities.   
---
Most importantly: Never hesitate to ask for help, and in return, always help the next guy!
---
I told him I am not responsible for his addiction.
---
It really isn't that bad if watch videos before going in.  Keeping the diesease off and the skeles dead was more important then healing output.  I think I respecced spirit tap/holy and was able to 1shot in blues + ~2 MCepics.  I only remember playing with one priest who failed it multiple times and they were a clicker.
---
And players who quit before Cataclysm could no longer recognize the new Azeroth.
---
Time marches on, dawg. :V
---
Assuming they want to keep it classic and never add TBC and WOTLK, the least they can do, in my opinion, is continue to add end game dungeons and raids. Continue to add armor tier sets, weapons, maybe some more legendaries, just so long as they pertain to the lore.
---
Thank you a lot for the reply! I double checked the repeatable quests you mentioned...
---
The one with the Hippogryph Egg is in Tanaris. You turn in the Hippogryph Egg and get a bad, fine, ordinary or extraordinary egg. You turn this one in and you receive some stuff like food, items and buff scrolls. However, you also get some reputation! I checked it on the DB I linked and also on the ND PTR.
---
* Bad Egg +10 reputation to Thunder Bluff / Darnassus
---
* Fine Egg +10 reputation to Thunder Bluff / Darnassus
---
* **Ordinary Egg +10 reputation to Darkspear Trolls / Darnassus**
---
* Extraordinary Egg +10 reputation to Thunder Bluff / Darnassus
---
As you can see only the Ordinary Egg is giving reputation to Darkspear Trolls (not to mention that is only +10) and I found that very strange since all the others give reputation towards Thunder Bluff. So I double checked on the internet and I was able to find this website which seems to be an old wiki about repeatable quests: [https://worldofwarcraft.fandom.com/et/wiki/Repeatable\_reputation\_quest](https://worldofwarcraft.fandom.com/et/wiki/Repeatable_reputation_quest)
---
According to the website all these quotes give or **should give only reputation towards Thunder Bluff** (or Darnassus if you are Alliance). So I guess the DB is wrong...
---
You mentioned an other repeatable quest... You maybe thinking about the Un'Goro Soil? You can collect this stuff to get at the end some Morrowgrain which you can turn in for reputation. However, this is also only giving reputation to Thunder Bluff (or Darnassus if you are Alliance).
---
I am not 100% sure but it seems like there does not exist a repeatable quest for Darkspear Troll reputation. The only one is going to be the cloth donation which was added later (after removing the unarmored mounts) in the game... However, it seems like you can do it for Thunder Bluff and/or Darnassus... If you know a repeatable quest or you was thinking about an other one, please let me know!

My memory is that, in Vanilla, most of the best guilds in North America were on PvP realms. It may play out differently this time but I expect not. The most intense PvE people are competitive people and are more unlikely to accept a PvE environment.

Holy shit, I might do this. I need to work on cardio more than anything else. My blood pressure and resting heart rate are pretty awful for a 24 year old.
---
I was using the word noob a bit facetiously.  But I don't think it's unreasonable for an experienced player to have a good feel for the timing of energy ticks.  You can call it getting more out of your character, but it's apparent that someone who uses an addon to track it will have an easier time performing certain feats compared to an equally skilled character that doesn't have the addon.  Timing is a skill and it's made easier with such an addon.

I personally wouldn't mind if after 2-3 years they took the OSRS route and held polls for new updates (New mounts, new raids etc). I also wouldn't mind if the content updates ended at Naxx. I'm not too picky about the future as long as the community, at the time, wants said changes. 
---
In my own opinion, I think the game should remain at 1.12 forever. But if the time comes and a overwhelming percentage of the community wants changes, and people like me become the minority. I'm not gonna raise my pitchfork.
---
With new API, it can become a thing. Hopefully a addon developer will do this. There is an active addon in BFA called:  
---
 [Quest Completist](https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/quest_completist) with luck the Dev of that one will continue. In worse case maybe you have to take contact and show them there is support for it to be ported into vanilla.
---
Yes, automatically looting items was in the game by 1.12. This is often shortened to the term auto-loot.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't Bliz begin adding ICD's to things during BC. I remember it this way because windfury needed an ICD due to dual wielding WF being too powerful, and then they started using it elsewhere.
---
I might be one of the few who actually wanna see the game come in Aug-Sept. I would like to enjoy the sun this summer, or else im just gonna sit indoors.   
---
With no Classic comming until end of summer, i might actually get some shit done or travel somewhere before its time to hunker down and become an indoor recluse.
---
&gt; they are NOT for eating
---
You are certainly free to be wrong.
---
As someone who has been in and out of wow since BC, most of the time you‚Äôll experience friendly people willing to help out a new guy. Unless you consistently make idiot moves that wipe the party, you‚Äôll be fine. 
---
Unless you‚Äôre a healer...Then you‚Äôll get shit on no matter what you do.
---
Gaming is pretty competitive these days, and this subreddit is the most diehard Classic fans, so it might seem like this. 
---
Most players don't have much of any of the skills you speak of, it's the diehard's job to herd them to victory and loot. Everyone wants the epics - but they require "work"!
---
Mage, Hunter, Rogue. 
---
Every other class is quite gear dependent.
---
A single raid parse from a single guild on a private server which are known to get many things wrong.  The plain fact is, resto druids were objectively inferior compared to priests/paladins at raw healing output.  On top of that, stacking druids more or less introduced diminishing returns as druid hots didn't stack.  
---
However, they did bring mana efficiency, battle rez, and innervate for priests.  On top of that, vanilla wasn't so hard that you need to min-max to such a degree as to avoid resto druids.
---
Restorative potions depending on what is trying to stop you.  
---
There are some high armor cloth pieces for mages, and lots of armor pieces for druid.  Also the runspeed boots from AB mean you can do a stam enchant and still have runspeed.  
---
All the engineering stuff is useful.  Try to grenade before a carrier goes down so only your team can click.  Shadow, Frost, Fire reflectors if you know enemy team has mage/warlock/spriest.  If you have a root break available the net is very strong.  Rocket helm can be used as an extra sprint+CCs someone.  MC helm can be useful, but it is better to save the long CD to return a flag.  You can MC the carrier and run away from his team while he hopefully dies from dots or just MC his escort to isolate him.
---
druid is one of the highest skill-cap classes. probably a tossup between druid and hunter in terms of skill cap for PvP. Hunter skill cap in PvE is somewhat higher because it's pure timing (cat dps is hard, but built around energy ticks, which the server "keeps track of" for you, so to speak). 
---
Most druids will raid as a healer. Note that I said as a healer, not as resto, because depending on your gear, the content you are progressing on, and your overall raid comp (heavy on priests/pally/shaman), not to mention whether you're horde or ally, your optimal healing spec might be swiftmend/deep resto, or moonglow/regrowth
---
Of course, it's more straight.

---
watch the [cinematic for cataclysm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq4Y7ztznKc). that will answer your question.
---
druids are great for PvP because they have unique depth through their combination of abilities. Immunity to polymorph, effective immunity to slows, up to 63% move speed boost in travel form, stealth, good healing, mediocre spell damage but you can pop out of stealth and put DoTs on multiple people. Any competitive WSG premades MUST have a druid. The ideal setup of 10 players for WSG includes at least one of every class, but you can substitute almost any single class for a nearly-as-effective alternative- but not your druid FC.
---
&gt;Most importantly: Never hesitate to ask for help, and in return, always help the next guy!
---
This reminds me of a "mantra" we had back in vanilla. Do a good deed before you log off. Even if it was join an instance, just to help, or giving someone who asked for something a helpful response.  And when they say thank you or however they repay. We always said, no thanks needed, pay back with doing the same thing to the next person.
---
The reason almost everyone plays female on private servers is because in warsong on the alliance side theres part of the fence you can jump through if your character is female and you can't jump through if you're male.
---
It doesn't matter if you're a tauren or a gnome, it's just male/female.
---
And in super high tier premade vs premade this matters alot. But it will probably be removed in classic.
---
&gt; Druids were disgusting in PvP.. Ignoring Engineering and gimmick items they handled Warriors and Rogues nearly as well as Frost Mages, beat Mages and Hunters via attrition and sustaining, duel other healers for hours until one gave up.. the only real thing I remember having a problem with his Shamans spamming purge and windfury proccing but they oom themselves half the time, or good Warlocks.
---
Worth pointing out that this seems to be entirely a dueling perspective.  In battlegrounds they were amazing for WSG, especially if you were in a high end group where winning fast was more important than just winning.  
---
Otherwise though, they were probably the worst class.  Ferals were shitty rogues and far shittier warriors, moonkins were bad mages, and hots couldn't really keep up with how fast people died in pvp and purge on top of that was practically a slap in the face.
---
Depends though. Druids were great healers in early wow because of hots.  When healbots came along the meters got because healbots  healed under hots.  It's pretty retarded because plenty of fights hots are not just fine, they're better.
---
Thanks! I'm looking forward to checking this out!
---
&gt; People are overestimating the ganking. Like you, for instance.
---
I have to side with OP here. STV is a fucking shithole if you are not through with it within the first month. And you can't realistically quest around it. The only option is taking the Kalimdor route and grinding mobs to pad out the questing XP.
---
People who speedlevel to 60 and gear up within the first 2 weeks will get bored quick until enough people can bump up to pug into MC. You know where they will go? STV.
---
Even if you manage to clear STV in time, EPL and UnGoro can still be a problem even later on.
---
I will not play on a PvP realm because I don't like ganking, don't really get enjoyment out of organized WPvP and still get to access Battlegrounds later on.

1. I'd say most of the difficulty in vanilla comes from the vast amount of knowledge that's required to play optimally. On top of this you have the organizational difficulty of managing 40 man raid teams or hardcore PvP premades. And finally, yes, the game is extremely grindy compared to more modern iterations of WoW. All of that being said, the gameplay itself is not more difficult than modern mythic raiding or modern PvP. A lot of people are lying to themselves, and others by the way, by saying the game mechanically was harder back then... it just wasn't. Don't be fooled.
---
2. Yes, every weapon has a skill level and that skill level is very important to your damage output. This isn't really a difficult thing to grind out though.
---
3. The most common way of getting into dungeons in vanilla is to simply post in the trade or LFG channels (i.e. "LFG wailing caverns" or "LF2M wailing caverns need healer" etc.) Then you simply walk to the dungeon and enter through the portal. Late game dungeons and raids may have attunement quests you'll need to complete, but by that point you'll likely know what you need to do to get into them.
---
4. Yes classes are completely different than current WoW. Almost every class has been majorly reworked since vanilla, to the point that some of the modern classes/specs are basically unrecognizable when compared to their vanilla counterparts. However, I'd say the biggest difference is the fact that in modern WoW classes are extremely homogeneous, meaning they all have access to the same shit. Every class gets a kick or interrupt of some sort, every class has (multiple) forms of CC, every class has self healing etc. The list goes on and on, but back in classic WoW the classes were all extremely unique and they each brought something special to the table that no other class could offer. This is one of the best parts of classic, and one of the reasons that modern WoW is just so boring, at least for oldschool players.
---
Classic wow is such a small thing in the grand scheme of things. There's a lot of people that are already subbed that are going to be playing classic, and I doubt the number of new subs is going to affect their bottom line almost at all when you compare it to things like Candy Crush and Call of Duty.
---
Nah. May not even get to play it on launch day.
---
Man I really hope classic progresses into TBC, the fact that you didn‚Äôt have to raid to get great pvp gear was really nice. You could be ‚Äúpvp only‚Äù if you were casual and didn‚Äôt have time to seriously raid and not be left behind gear wise. I know some weapons were restricted to high arena score which it should be but casuals could still grind out 10 games a week and get pieces slowly
---
It's just gay to be smiling like a dumbass and walking like a dork while youre killing shit. I think blizzards idea is "Yeah Tauren should look happy because that will make people think they are happy while playing" or some shit
---
What makes your frost bolts hit for more damage? Int/spell damage? It‚Äôs weird how casters weapons do not  really relate to their damage as much as it does for melee/hunter
---
No problem, I‚Äôd be interested in your feedback.  None of my friends play wow, so I‚Äôve been keeping this to myself for some time.  Maybe I‚Äôll make a separate thread and post some pvp vids from Lights hope as proof of concept
---
Yup and I know what they all will look like too. I have anxiety someome is going to steal my character names. Thats the main reason I want to book the launch day off work. Oh yes and also to binge play like I've never binged before.
---
First mouse that I bought with my own money
---
Im still using the original steelseries wow mmo mouse. Its getting 8ng pretty worn on the top but still performs great.  Has 12 buttons that can be mapped to to pretty much any function in the game or as a specific keyboard key.
---
I got most of it set up just not the looks there werent as many character model options and I dont play private server. Also hope my names arent taken.
---
One thing retail did better than Classic is that they made all specs competitive..in vanilla... you wouldn‚Äôt be able to raid as ret, shadow, balance, feral dps, balance, enhancement, elemental, etc. and because of this, there‚Äôs going to be a large majority of people playing warrior, rogue, mage as a result as they have the best damage
---
you could play it that way, or just know that you will grow stronger over time!
---
Here's some honesty. I've played on nothing but PvP servers. I am going to kill you. You are red, and whether you're at 100% or 10%, your ass is fried chicken. Not gonna camp anyone. If I don't think I can win, then I will probably roll on through unless I get the feeling you're gonna jump me, then it's on either way. If you /wave, you might as well just be waving me over to come kill you like you're soliciting it.  If you're really low level, I'll probably still kill you unless I'm mounted and don't want to have to get off my mount and remount because I have places to go. If you run away, I probably won't bother chasing you down. If you're a rogue and I see you, you're getting smashed no matter what. If I lose, I don't care. I might try again, I might now. Depends on the day. Middle of a quest? Don't care, let's fight.
---
It's a PvP server and you're just content to me. Don't take it personally.
---
I‚Äôm sorry, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs odd. I‚Äôve played almost every expansion since vanilla, and it was a very methodical process that led me to this setup.
---
Holy shit these new models are fuck ugly. How could a game go backwards in design? Did they ever even playtest these abominations?
---
College roommate and me used to play Tiger Woods golf all the time. I always made the foxiest babe possible because duh. One day his buddy came in and briefed me about it. 
---
I was like "bro." and I pointed to the screen.
---
I always thought north was like, up?
---
I have a feeling it will release in phase 2 with DM &amp; Azergos/Kazzak.
---
Un-vanilla like? What? Blizzard is literally making other changes to the game that are far more long reaching in the realm of what is or is not vanilla like.
---
The D.E.N.N.I.S system.
---
Several of my RL friends play retail.  I wish I could convince them to play classic but won‚Äôt happen.
---
https://www.vanilla-questing.me Really simple and well made.
---
In a lot of areas Vanilla was better experience than current WoW. My greatest hope is that Classic will be success so Blizzard will realize how hard they have gone wrong with current direction they are taking this game. I hope Classic will help live to get back to roots of WoW. Back to thing that people loved.
---
This reminds of a dude in our guild in vanilla...huge weeb...like, defiantly weeb. Anime avatar on forums, always said "Kon'nichiwa" when he logged on, always quoting anime, talking about anime. If you didn't know what he was talking about he'd audibly scoff at you and be condescending, but he was a decent warlock (he knew how to spam shadowbolt and showed up) so we kept him around.
---
One afternoon we're hanging out in the lobby on TS and someone asks why we chose to race/class combo we did because they want to make an alt. We go down the line, and we get to him.
---
Guy: "Any reason you went with female gnome?"
---
Dude: "Racials, extra int is great."
---
Guy: "Yeah, sure, but why female?"
---
Dude: "Because they're hot."
---
Guy: "Dude...that's weird."
---
Dude: "Why? She's at least 15."
---
Everyone: "Wow."
---
Some people just don't enjoy the RPG element of reading quest text. I for one will have instant quest text toggled and will only check the quest if there's something more than just kill/collect
---
Ooomg
---
All the top players were always on PvP realms.
---
Would you really trust Blizzard in it's current state to make changes to the game? Restore an archive? Sure. But I wouldn't want them designing anything for Classic.
---
Difference is those improvements were made in vanilla.  So therefore still classic.  AoE looting however was not.
---
It did dmg in vanilla and tbc
---
&gt; You know where they will go? STV.
---
&gt; 
---
Probably not. If you're not using the first few weeks that you're ahead of most people to grind devilsaur leather or other stuff that will be aids to farm whenever most people have catched up to lv60 you're doing it wrong.
---
hahahhaha! Love the humor! If you miss it, we'll save you a spot! Cheers man!
---
I really think they could have done without the resilience on pvp gear. It really split the population into a pvp and pve crowd. That screwed people who liked to do a bit of both, but only had time for one.
---
I'm not going to get into all the "lookin at girl booty is for straight boys" logic others are trying to sell you.
---
But for me, there's definitely something really off about male animations as a caster.  Human males are pretty dang awful, and so are nelfs imo.  I also prefer a smaller model as to not stand out so much in a crowd.
---
Why it's different on pservers vs 2004?  Community grew up, and we're not all worried about what others think.
---
We could call it Activision wow.
---
Nice work
---
Yep. The circlejerk is getting kinda stale.
---
I lvled a Paladin to 60 in vanilla and have done it twice on Pservers, if you play correct there's 0 downtime and it's not really slow.
---
People will get bored of farming Ungoro and DM. And STV is **the** point for level 60s to relax in some ganking to spice up your day.
---
I don't think the pressure to gear up will be that great. Many people will need to fill their roster for MC and gearing up before 80% of your raid did, doesn't magically make your read down Rag. There will be plenty of time to relax at 60 if you speedlevel.
---
Shit like this would turn people off of classic community and give it a bad rep.
---
This is my dilemma, I even bug co-workers who don't play WoW about which class I should play.
---
I liked resilience, I am probably in the minority though. It was fun fighting people in tier 6 while you were in season 3 gear. But yeah I know what you mean by creating that divide between the PvP and PVE crowd. if you only had time for one thing, it was most likely PvP since you just needed to play 10 short arena matches a week to get points. To grind honor you just needed to play bgs which take no more than 30 mins. As for raiding, you had to put aside large amounts of time unless your guild had raids on farm.
---
&gt;as a caster.
---
They're also impossibly jacked, which looks weird in a robe.
---
This is brilliant thank you.
---
Chill, Mr. t0x1c.
---
Thanks for letting me know. English ain't my native. My b. xd.
---
Thank you for mentioning this addon.
---
Lets hope!
---
Wow I think this is the first launch video I've seen
---
I just consider female models visually more pleasing to look at, for whatever reasons, for me it's an mmo not an rpg. Although, you can make some good money selling handjobs to roleplayers in Goldshire Inn.
---
That sounds perfect. I wanted to go for a ele/enh hybird sort of thing for pvp and I was looking at the five thunders for it. Sounds like I picked the right one.
---
Ban the sellers, ban the buyers.
---
do we have to buy the game again?     
---
have the game up until Warlords of Draenor
---
Nearly every day there's a thread about min/maxers or casuals and how everyone has fun in their own way and how you 'can't tell me how I am supposed to have fun blah blah.'
---
Then someone brings up achievements and the previous opinions are only for when it's convenient.
---
Anyway, there will be an addon for achievements at some point.  We'll just pretend that Blizzard isn't already tracking all the achievement data, while we wait for the addon.
---
Questie does it already and I would be very surprised if it wasn't made for Classic client. I don't think there is a counter of total quests and quests in the zone but I might be wrong. You don't need it anyway. Once the map is cleared out of quest marks you're good to move on.
---
But not from phase one.. the rogue class revamp came like *2 years* after launch
---
They are much, much greater changes than the vast majority of suggestions proposed that go against the "nochanges crowd"
---
It's a *massive* change from actual vanilla, same with stuff like debuff slots or weapon speed normalization. #nochanges should be against that same as any other change - that's the nature of that philosophy - any and all change is bad
---
Interesting how those changes get a pass, yet more minor but equally sensible changes are somehow heresay
---
Who cared about Alliance, they all end up dead anyway.
---
Stat weights are way off for MP5 - the sheet doesn't take into account whether you would actually run out of mana using the selected heal.
---
The sheet tells you 1 MP5 is equivalent to 6.74 healing when spamming rank 1 Flash of Light on a 90 second fight, which is nonsense because unless you have less than 2100 mana and never crit, you won't run out of mana even with 0 MP5.
---
Every hobby has a sick side.
---
I disagree, i think spirit is overrated
---
seeing you argue with these people reminds me of clickers arguing they can click the actionbar just as fast as you can press keys.
---
There's definitely a lot to do but let's not lie to ourselves how content drought is very good and we will all be doing very interesting things during that time. I can't wait to fully play the first Classic cycle but then there has to be something more like fresh servers, TBC in the future or alternate timeline (Although I'd start that one in Wotlk in my opinion if it'll be ever a thing).
---
The no changes movement started out just being about gameplay, but morphed into this idiotic tendies screed about any minor change ruining the game.
---
It's not gonna hurt anyone if there's a model toggle, and if you downvote me or OP, it's just you being a neckbeard.
---
You realize you can still go outside this summer even if the game launches tomorrow, right?
---
Don't think it was a bug, but yes WF could proc WF. Low chance but was there
---
classic good retail bad 
---
never gets old, huh?
---
Southern hemisphere where it's at classic winter
---
I think "content drought" as most people see it, is actually a great thing for the game. It's not fun being on a raid schedule through the entire lifecycle of the game. Imagine being happy with your gear and actually playing the game, not just raiding over and over every week endlessly.
---
I‚Äôm a lefty... you telling me you use the mouse in your left hand? And keyboard on the right? How?
---
For sure. For example, I'm into gaming, so naturally I'm sexually attracted to my shift key.
---
It's mostly harmless, but I do occasionally have a problem with sticky keys.
---
You're right, it forces player away from you after only a short time. In wow you can walk behind people for hours. either way there could just be a mute function for wow.
---
Corsair scimitar is great. Feels much more sturdy to me than the Naga.
---
Why would you play a chick if youre a dude - asmongold
---
Wrong. You can raid as those specs just fine if you are willing to work a little harder at getting consumables and really researching your spec. Are they **optimal** for hardcore guilds that are trying for world first in classic? Depends on raid composition, but usually no. Are those specs **viabl**e to raid in Vanilla? Certainly they are.  
---
Stop repeating this nonsense about some specs not even being viable. It is not true in the slightest. There is a huge difference between viable for doing raid content and completing the content and optimal for pushing raid content for the fastest times or world/server first.
---
I live in Bulgaria and I doubt he makes only 60$ per month unless his parents give it to him. In the big cities, no one even starts a job under 250 euro (which is low as fuck). Even during the summer season, the lowest pay is 300 euro and not much people want to work it, last years they started to hire people from Moldova.
---
And that 16y old dude, that claims everything to be really bad - you are in reddit and plan to play a grindy video game, you are fine. At your age, I worked during the summer.
---
I am just pissed off from people that claim everything to be bad, but they have a roof, phones for 300-500 euro (I am still using my nokia n73), food, internet. There are people, that doesn't eat every day. I get it, ur problems look like the biggest on Earth because they are yours, not someone else. But stop acting like you are almost dying.
---
Yea that sounds like a fun spec! I‚Äôm gonna go ele/Resto because I really wanna raid but I want to smash face in a ten storms set as well haha
---
&gt; always said "Kon'nichiwa" when he logged on,
---
We had one such guy as well. He stopped when we started replying _"omae wa mou shindeiru"_ (You are already dead.) every time.
---
0600: Go to gym, set treadmill to 15% incline and 2mph. Walk for 45. Increase speed/duration weekly (add .1/.1 up to 3mph / 1 hour)
---
Don‚Äôt under estimate fasted incline walking cardio. Shredded me to 8% with minimal lifestyle changes and I‚Äôm really surprisingly fit from it. I had to do a beep test for a physical and manage over level 10 without preparing.
---
With utmost certainty yes, it will be.
---
"I deserve to sell these BoEs more than these other toxic people in my group."
---
Well I would love to play a shadow priest but everyone keeps telling me they only use one in a friggin 40 man raid whereas in retail, they are a top dps spec. In classic, I am most likely forced to heal as a priest or I‚Äôm forced to roll a mage or warlock if I want to dps as a caster.
---
A release perceived to be "on-time" will still signal company strength, though.  It's probably not going to have a huge affect but I'm sure they'll get a bump.  It's already up about 16% from the low in February; even without projections, release will probably support that trend.
---
Unless 8.2 is a dud, in which case who knows I guess.
---
At the moment, I really dont have time to go to the gym. I've got a full time job and I've been doing 60 hours of community service, about 2-4 hours a day after work. It's literally killing me.
---
Int only gives you a small amount of crit. +dmg is the only way to increase how much damage frostbolt does (for a given rank and ignoring how +crit and +hit work.
---
So, let's see if I understand you correctly:
---
When given the opportunity to be whatever you want to, chosing to have breasts and wide hips, is somehow proof that you are a straight man?
---
Sorry dude, that doesn't compute.
---
0600: skip rope, 30 seconds on 30 off for 15 minutes. Do this on grass to save your knees.
---
Add 5 seconds until you‚Äôre at a minute on 30 off.
---
This‚Äôll fuck you up.
---
So if pally‚Äôs are a competitive substitute for a warrior then what does horde get?  In an effort to balance pally‚Äôs to the tanking viability of a warrior you‚Äôve just created a faction imbalance.
---
What server will you be raiding on?
---
I am touched by your compassion! 
---
Last year, When I played on an unofficial server, we had our off-tank from Bulgaria I believe who was 16 at the time. He was not excited about Classic as there was no way he could afford the subscription. I was quite stunned by this since I, despite being a student and thusly considered "poor" by my own country's standards, I luckily didn't have to consider the financial cost of wow, rather the time investment.
---
Kudos to you!
---
Vid related :D

---
I'm saying people who autoroll need on BoEs so they can post it on AH when someone in the party wanted to use it are assholes.
---
So caster weapons are as much as a stat stick as a 2h sword is for a hunter ?
---
Questie is one of the best Addons for Classic. I mean most of the named NPCS can really hard to find or are not there where the Quest text told you. Do act like you did not open Thottbot back then

I played a mage in classic and was gona do that again. All this rouge talk though... I dunno Im torn. I know the rouge pop is going to be nuts but I bet a lot of those players fall off quickly too.
---
Almost always easier
---
I think the most hardcore PvE guilds plays on PvP realms. That has been the case for a long time.
---
Hardcore PvEers love world pvp aswell.
---
This is the autism level of classic tryhard players that I remember
---
Paladin.
---
Yes, and feral druids. The dps/speed is irrelevant, you're just looking at the bonuses it gives.
---
&gt; and the improved totems will boost a melee group enough to be worthwhile
---
Nope. Each talent gives roughly 10 str, which means you are giving about 20 str more to your melees than a regular resto would. Add that to the bottom-of-the-barrel DPS and the fact that enhances are the absolute worst Nightfall swingers, there's no redeeming factors for enhances.
---
RIP
---
oh lord
---
Shadow was pretty strong in vanilla. They have great damage but they run out of Mana fairly quickly. If you get aethena and know what you're doing it's good.
---
Damn that sounds fun, so fun. All my friends from old WOW just dont care anymore.
---
The classic community is its own worst enemy in this regard.
---
Hey same. Worst decision of my life
---
The guide used almost all quests, so there is no benefit to not use it. The real gain from using the guide is that you collect all X number of quests from a certain area before heading to the next. 
---
Unless you know where all quests are, it‚Äôs beneficial. Especially with the bread crumb quests.
---
People will always buy Gold from Goldsellers. I have sold gold since TBC (on on some PServers) and even in BFA i could sell the Gold for a better price then exchange it for a token. 
---
The problem is when there is a Official way to buy Gold the economy will be hit really hard and the Prices will skyrocket. What then happens is that people that had a lot of gold can dominate the AH because other people can not match them and they get richer. 
---
It would not be a big problem if everything you need in this game is made by players (repairs, Mounts and so on) but  with the epic Mount in Classic everyone would have it because there is so much gold in  circulation.
---
Look at BFA, no one has less then 10k if he has a lvl120 chars. I would even say most have around 100k+
---
Why are you gatekeeping friends? What you're saying makes no sense to me. A friend is someone you get along with and talk/play with. These can be guildies and such. 
---
I do agree that real life friends are important for your social health but gatekeeping the term 'friend' is ridiculous. Unless you are talking about those people you talk once with, put in your friends list and then forget about. 
---
My best friend is someone I've never met in real life yet we have talked and played together online for 7 years and we talk daily. I still have a ton of real life friends though.
---
*solo*
---
They are just fine at tanking dungeons and off tanking raids
---
Best flag carriers too
---
Yeah, in stonetalon and in thousand needles are two that come to mind. There's even more zones though.
---
I for one think the vanilla UI is hot garbage. The stock UI sucked completely until WoD, maaaaybe MoP, and when I quit the raid frames were still clunky af and ugly. I had to make an addon to scale and move around elements to locations that aren't completely useless and get more efficient raid frames.
---
The default UI is awful, and I'm utterly convinced that looking all over the screen to see information that should be more centrally located and situationally available tangibly lowers a players' performance and efficiency. It's literal garbage and players should be able to tweak it to fit their individual needs.
---
For me, at launch I‚Äôm going to sit down and make one of each class on both factions. Then I‚Äôll think about which I want to play first, it will probably on the same faction and starting area as my brother.
---
i cant wait to wreck the shit out of these mmo mouse people
---
Is this a worse version of an already used meme?

The hardest choices require the strongest wills
---
I'm going in fairly blind, besides knowing I want to main a gnome warlock.  Haven't decided on male or female, I was a male gnome when I played during TBC and WotLK but since then I really like rolling females on MMO's.
---
On the grander scheme of things Classic won't save their stock... A minor bump up and then a decline unless they get their shit together imo...
---
of course.
---
Played on German Kel Thuzad PvP Server and one of the best EU Guilds back then (Noir) played there and is still playing there (i have no idea if they are still top in anything)
---
Hopefully a osrs voting system is put in place for patch progression.
---
SOON GUYS. SOON. ^(get ready.)
---
That's a fair point but I believe you're in minority. Getting bis was always my favourite thing to do. After that I like to mop the floor with scrubs in pvp but It's just not something you will do endlessly since it's just easy. Big critz stop being big critz when they are just the usual dmg.
---
Content drought at the end of the expansion was always the worst time for people who achieved what they wanted to achieve.
---
Surely I can lvl up another class and start gearing it again but that's way worse experience since I will get carried by other geared players.
---
Just play near an open window if it's nice out, close enough imo.
---
I was going to call you out unless you mentioned weapon timer alignments, and you did so I cannot really find fault other than the benefit will be less than expected.  
---
In my experience, the move to melee was only worth it if you got a melee swing and dropped a fire/snake trap.
---
You can also go with a druid but prot warriors are the best choice for most bosses.
---

"And the effort to remove Elsherifo from his chair has entered the third day...we go live to Anderson Cooper who is on the scene. Anderson?"
---
*"Yes, Wolf, as you may already know this gamer has been in the same chair for several weeks now....Urine, feces, and some red variant of Mountain Dew have reacted with his chair to chemically bond the skin of his ass to it. Paramedics were unable to detach the chair to provide vital care after he reached level 60, and we've had to call in experts from New York. They should be....I'm getting....sorry, getting word that the doctors are on scene now. We'll keep you updated with the latest as it breaks. Back to you, Wolf."*

#THIS IS CNN

Druids can easily do all 5 mans as well as offtank and occasionally main tank, Paladins can do all 5 mans with less viability. Warriors can do everything.
---
Agreed, female caster animations are a lot better. Human females have the best caster animations overall.
---
Or play on a laptop outside the house!
---
you won't have to buy the game, but you do need and active sub. I'm not sure if your account needs to be updated to BfA though, so you may have to buy that.
---
It always depends on how you look at it. (Not the ass)
---
I wouldn't consider it very manly to identify oneself with a female avatar.
---
Pala Tanks are kinda fun on all that undead 5mans
---
Have you ever heard about the concept of RNG ? /s
---
First you need the item to drop (good luck with that Ironfoe) and then you need to win the roll ...
---
I know a guy that never got a piece of T2 (the head I think) for his rogue, he still farmed it solo on retail until a few years ago. The thing just never dropped for him.
---
Thank you for this
---
It might make it more interesting for you, but for alot of people the game starts at 60, so they want to do 1-59 as soon as possible.
---
Nothing in the patch notes.
---
He's a warrior, great threat generation !
---
Thoroughly interested in joining you all!
---
I‚Äôve been playing the same character since the original release, a much loved Restoration Shaman. I‚Äôve healed every raid for every expansion, am a huge nerd for performance metrics, and will be taking 2 weeks off for launch.
---
Any chance that would fit with you?
---
Warriors = King tank, preferred for everything but most annoying to play when you just wanna lazy dungeon.
---
Druids = strong option.  Great at 5mans, hard w a fresh 60 healer because you're a mana sponge... easier for a geared healer because of your health pool.
---
Paladin= good at strat/scholo but really no reason to roll this... I love prot pally so much in BC and WotLK but they're just so bad in vanilla ;/ you will never tank a raid, idc how many people link the video of that one guy tanking the raid.
---
So I get done reading your story after I've just dinged 37 on my hunter on lights hope.

It's possible that the bindings would drop phase 3 because you need BWL to actually craft the weapon.

I want an add-on for this. Leveled up? Do X pushups. Finished a dungeon, go run a lap. On a gryphon, time for situps.
---
During leveling all tanks can clear dungs and end game dungs. Pallies are the most annoying since they will drink every pull or two depending on how much int they have. They can't compete in raiding though. They lack hard taunt and the gear requirement is very niche since they need int gear. 
---
Druid and warrior can do everything but the warrior has better defensive options. Shield Wall is busted and lack of Parry and shield blocks hurt druid badly. Dodge is just not good since it denies rage generation.
---
I'm pretty sure there was one or two blood elf bosses in dire maul.
---
U can count on blizz to take ur money.
---
Why even think too much about it now? There is so much time passing by until the time the majority cleared Naxx. A lot of things can happen. I don't think ppl were discussing what content will come after BFA before it launched (or any other exp) but it seems to bother many about classic.  
---
\+ they shouldnt add anything on "Classic" Servers. I'm fine with getting new Servers with Classic+new Content or Servers with tbc we maybe can transfer a char to. But keep Classic Servers Classic.
---
I strongly believe there won't be enough servers at the beginning. I'm pretty sure Acti Blizz will underestimate the interest for Classic and we will see the longest queues in the history of wow.
---
I'm going female gnome!
---
Mages aren't too far behind rogues and furies in MC unless it's a remove curse fight.  Then in BWL it's even closer... warlocks are pretty shit tier 1 tho lol.
---
 **You didn't put it into any context though** 
---
sure thing Spock.
---
 **Frostbolt still was the meat and potatoes though.** 
---
Doesn't matter, it was a smaller potato and less meat. You ignored this which is a strawman.
---
  **The only thing that changed was icelance** 
---
Rofl, we can just play TBC servers boys, the only change was icelance.
---
  **and water elemental, which was passive damage and an extra nova. What  these things did do, was allow you to be more mobile while still dealing  some damage.** 
---
red herring fallacy, explaining something that you agree with, probably to appear to not be agreeing with me but educating me instead is just a distraction tactic, the mechanical explanation doesn't negate the thing itself, so this isn't relevant information.
---
 **No I'm not. You literally said Icelance held other spells hostage, which  is flat out wrong. Then after being called out on it you start dialing  back and suddenly begin talking about a "rotation" which is a far cry  from your initial statement. Hyperbole or not.** 
---
You demonstrated a fundamental lack of understanding of my comment. Unless you thing mages were balanced before icelance was put in the game, and all other balance changes were made without the existed of icelance being considered, you are wrong. You can die on that hill if you want. You even made my case for me, mages got more mobility and passive damage, those things mean you deal less damage overall or else you're just a flat out broken and better class. Name one class that had the best of every single characteristic, every class has a budget and a theme.
---
 **So you're suggesting to buff one of the strongest tbc classes by pretty much 40%?** 
---
So removing icelance and the water elemental in exchange for a number that was theoretical and made up on the fly as a **placeholder** is a straight buff? Are we seriously arguing my **completely madeup** hypothetical? As if I couldn't just keep dropping the number until "Ch4p3l" of reddit thought it as good? Spockism is worse than autism.
---
 **and your solution is to buff ALL mage damage? Where is the logic in that?** 
---
I know I'm making this point twice, but I think you're a few steps behind intellectually. So the reason players on a wow forum don't make final decisions in game design is because they aren't part of the design team and have biases and possess less than all the information. Every single answer I could give would be just as fallible, so a made up example is **literally** equal in value when speaking in hypothetical terms. I could have said "I wanted a 1 shot button instead of icelance" and it would be equally valid if your brain is capable of parsing that data.
---
 **one of the strongest tbc classes** 
---
Citation, prove it, you aren't an authority on the matter. Hold you to the same standard as you hold me.
---
 **It is, but certainly not in the way you did, because you didn't use them  to accentuate anything but just randomly spill them into your posts.  You don't make it clear when you mean something literally and when it's  exaggerated. It becomes especially unclear when your post contains flat  out wrong claims, is contradicting itself and seemingly can't  differentiate between class changes and expansion changes.** 
---
This is another Spock moment. Don't forget this is because you literally sperged and thought I **actually** believed frostbolt dealt 0 damage and was just left that way for all of TBC. Are you that stupid? No I just think you're disingenuous and trying not to let it show. I know that if I had you on the phone or in face to face conversations and after I mocked you for being an autist you would have to drop the whole act about only being able to take my words at face value. It's just a toxic facet of the internet reasonable people can't avoid.
---
  **You don't make it clear when you mean something literally and when it's exaggerated** 
---
When I said frostbolt did 0 dmg, but frostbolt didn't do 0 dmg, that was an exaggeration. I think I was mixing up some numbers with icelance damage vs frostbolt, but it wasn't a pillar of my argument at any stage of the conversation. You can say that was something I was wrong about, probably the only thing. Take it and go back to your cave?
---
 **So naturally you're looking at that compressed thought of yours with  this knowledge in mind, but don't realize that there's fundamental  information missing for someone to correctly interpret it, who can't  look into your head** 
---
This is projection, I just had an argument this big with another user over stupid fucking definitions of what can be considered "a benefit" or not based on items requiring a tradeskill. And after some time of arguing the OP had to come out and say I was absolutely correct. Just one example. What I think is happening is on the internet you can't hear me mock you verbally, which is a huge part of communication. You just get the feeling of validation and full investment from text. I am almost tempted to just offer you a discord link, just to settle this.  because of how much it annoys me that internet communities have these types of busybody types who just want petty victories.
---
I will say this politely. You were behaving exactly like he was. This is an argument about your criticisms of my statements yet you are just going for points battle royal style and ignoring when I refute something. You use extremely unreasonable standards that are frankly not human (you literally believe I said frostbolt does 0 dmg because I didn't provide a caveat).
---
My original statement: 
---
**This isn't just nostalgia, when TBC was in full swing and frostbolt was  doing 1200 or 1500 dmg to a target with 12,000 hp, and icelance was  critting harder than frostbolt with no cooldown and instantly cast, it  felt terrible. This one spell holding the rest of the spells hostage,  you gained almost no advantage by standing still anymore, ignoring mages  used to punish you.** 
---
Still true, still said as my subjective opinion aside from where I posted numbers which were from what 12 years ago during an expansion I played mostly 49 twinks during? Depending on the time of the expac and gear available I was almost dead on for frostbolt damage.
---
You do realize that video shows a frostbolt dealing damage that was achievable at lvl 60 right, and not difficult to do either? It might have taken a raid setting but that alone proves my point. Hp and resilience existed and hp pools were higher compared to the damage dealt. It even looks like his CoC hits for under 700 dmg, similar number to lvl 60 damage.
---
I mained a rogue for 119 days in TBC. Then I mained a warlock. Rogues you destroy tend to leave you alone, just stay topped up so they don't get the opportunity; if they do - its's your own fault.
---
Yep. My IRL friend had a total monopoly on the high-level enchanting Dusts/Crystals. He would buy everything under his price. He has quite the negative reputation. Funny, we were also on Dragonmaw.
---
Some comments make sense, some don't.
---
Just check this vid out. 100% accurate. Druid can be beasts, pun intended.

---
My (and Blizzard's :) take on it:
---
Classic is Vanilla. No more, no less. A game which already was but doesn't exist currently. So it's being restored.
---
You get bored by it? Stop playing. It's not created for you to play it until the end of time. It doesn't need any changes, balancing or additions.
---
It should be there to be able to go back to and experience again (or the first time) just like other old games. Like Warcraft 1, 2 or 3.
---
These games also nicely show what can be done if you want more. Want fancy new graphics? Ask for it. Let's have a WoW Classic "Reforged". Separate from the already existing WoW Classic, like how Warcraft 3 Reforged is separate from Warcraft 3.
---
Blizzard (Brack):
---
- "This is an important game in videogame history and there‚Äôs not a way to go back and experience that today. This is also about preserving something that we think is really important.
---
- "If millions of people show up and play for years, that‚Äôs awesome. And if just tens people show up and play for years, we‚Äôre fine either way."
---
Is it a figure of Batman cosplaying Lich King or an actual Lich King? It's impossible to say!
---
They're good, it's just that mana becomes an issue after a few pulls. If you have a group that's understanding of the need to drink, you can tank most every dungeon.
---
Nope, my gpu is dying and im broke.
---
I have planned my characters down. Race, Class, Name. All ready and set to get claimed day 1     
---
Computer setup ready. G602 mouse for the extra buttons I never had back then and I even bought a Logitech G13 for all them macro keys.    
---
All I need now is the release date so I can plan my time-off.
---
Considerably quick.
---
I feel the old rule from the Something Awful forums apply perfectly: Don't be a dick.
---
Follow that rule, and all is well.
---
I got the same LK, but vanilla CE is legendary. Only CE I didn't buy and I'm still kicking myself in the ass for it.
---
Go horde and stay in barrens until level 31
---
Actually 41 Blizzard yards are 41 meters :o
---
41 meters is 44.84 yards
---
God I hope it's possible to have them drop from the beginning... so many more opportunities for the already impossible to drop
---
I guess it's the go-to thing if you are a PvP player to roll female for some reason but when they start rattling off jabs about people playing males or humans or night elves and so on and so forth I really wonder how deranged they are in real life if they lack the self-awareness to actually say something like that openly.
---
&gt;Worth pointing out that this seems to be entirely a dueling perspective.  In battlegrounds they were amazing for WSG, especially if you were in a high end group where winning fast was more important than just winning.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Otherwise though, they were probably the worst class.
---
They had some extra utility in Arathi Basin as well, so that's 2/3 BGs, and duels. That's not bad.
---
I'm actually going to do this. But not solo.
---
Torn on what to main but pretty much ready to pop off. I live a very privileged life that does not require me to work so I'm going to full on no life it. Illy easily be top 10% to 60 and I will ride that wave all the way to Naxx. I have a totally unfair time advantage and I am going to fuck you guys up. Can't wait.
---
Why didn't you try to google "wow vanilla exp grind locations" before posting this?
---
I have maximum patience for people who are ignorant and are humble about it. I go 100% Toxic INSTANTLY if they‚Äôre ignorant and arrogant.
---
I feel like taking the time to read every step of the guide wastes more time than if I just put my head down and grind.  I'm always ahead of the pack and do pretty well.  I love orc and generally just
---
SKIP starting area, run out and kill lvl 5 mobs for a few levels while the idiots fight over boar spawns.
---
Do the whole first 2 towns outside levelling area.
---
Go to Barrens, do everything, venture into stonetalon and ashenvale.
---
Go to southern barrens and knock out those quests. 
---
Do the WC run for the quests I've gotten and overlevelled now... this is partly nostalgia partly food exp.  Breaks up the grind.
---
Should be around 23-24
---
Finish ashenvale and stonetalon.  Go to hillsbrad. 
---
Grind my butt off in hillsbrad on humanoids and level first aid as high as I can while here.  
---
If I'm mining I'll go to Wetlands and do the quests in raptor area then farm in the secret mining cave from 65-125 mining.  Should be about lvl 28. 
---
Go to thousand needles -&gt; every single quest. Easy route counter clockwise.
---
Go to STV, do all of north even the damn trolls. 
---
Go to shimmering flats, do all.
---
Go back to stv -&gt; do the south quests. If I haven't grinded enough I might go do some desolace or badlands... I try to avoid these if I can.
---
Feralas/hinterlands/tanaris - hopping back and forth as these zones scale per part that you're in.  Only 3 zones I'll group for too besides stv... tons of kill quests.
---
Searing gorge/blasted lands
---
Un goro- south east guys first, then marshals. Then full counter clockwise circle doing every quest.
---
If I'm not 53-54 I'll hit felwood. If I am I'll go to burning steppes and start knocking out those quests.. I usually try to start onyxia chain.  From here on out its BRD runs interlaced with WPL, EPL and Silithus. 
---
Dont even mention winterspring to me.  I dont have the cardio for it.
---
So you would choose Arcanite reaper over Ashkandy ? :p
---
Yikes.
---
Im old school so I still think people should roll based on their spec for the dungeon but only with blues or better. Greens really have never been like that.
---
And yes, a level 20 blue item may still be equipped at level 30 or 40 depending on the item and your luck with drops. Most quest items blow compared to dungeon drops.
---
Do we ban thots who trade sex for their epic mount like that famous news story?
---
I Think your absolutely right and I really hope so. Would be sick
---
Ehhhh I kinda disagree. This is true for guilds that don't get world buffs and have full consumes. But when you have Ony/ZG/DMT buffs, melee just pulls so far ahead it's not even close.
---
Incorrect.
---
I hope it's not true. That would mean there are other limitations put on Classic like skeleton crews for maintenance or development.
---
Hi, /u/VanillaHunt
---
Amen
---
The best xp farming options are gonna be the ones that have the least amount of players spawncamping them, which will depend entirely on how everyone else on your server plays.
---
Well, since you're alliance, I'd recommend farming boars in Elwynn Forest. I've heard it's great for xp grinding.
---
Exercise doesn't slim you down, diet does! Go to the gym without dieting and you just end up strong and fat
---
Free transfers i hope. Or they will just afk and check on their ez money from transfers
---
With what blizzard said, we can assume that we will have pre 1.10 loot table from P1 (with 1.12 stats). And in P5, they will update the lootable with items that had been included in 1.10.
---
I'll level as a duo (warr/pala) and my current thinking is get soc and movement speed from ret then go holy. This is mainly sins I don't provide the most of our dps. Me and my friend have tried alot of different specs on different p servers and it seems to work best for us. Another spec that works well and probably better solo is keep going ret for vengeance this is probably better if you play solo. First 10 points in holy is not bad tho and eliminating push back on heal is pretty good. Hit is not really needed when you level it is more of an endgame thing.
---
Why would he play a human when he is undead
---
Yeah maybe they do this for TF because it is TF but do you think they will also hold back Items of 1.4 and 1.5 patches?
---
If you were good enough with a rogue you could beat anyone naked with the starter weapons
---
I've always used and was pretty happy with Jame's Guides. If I'll have a second monitor by the time Classic is out I'll just keep the guide on there.
---
Only if the tank and healer are both geared enough for it. I'd be pissed if the tank ended up dying because the healer went oom trying to dps.
---
Wanding is usually okay as long as the priest stays vigilant, but that'a disc.
---
I'm sure it would, hop on the Discord!
---
Ha jokes on you, im bringing my friends back with me to no life Classic together!
---
Not saying this is the proper choice, or the right choice buuttt...
---
Find out which server the popular WoW streamers are going to roll on. Figure out which faction. You can estimate the population and faction balance using those.
---
Your logic is totally on point, mate.  I rate 10/10 for your argumentative writing and 10/10 for your reading comprehension.
---
I don't like to breathe, so I don't understand why you do it. I guess some people just want to live.
---
I didn't mean to be bitchy at first, but I realised that your comments towards the well-written feedback in this thread indicate that you're beyond reach. So I couldn't find a good reason to try to reason with you. 
---
Sit down, be quiet and let people play the game in their preferred way, son.
---
Depends on the level of the group and what kind of BRD run it is.
---
Yeah, that's the reason I loved pala tank in bc with a taunt. That was just some dank niche meta.
---
Login screen soundtrack is like GoT intro for me - perfectly described by this meme
---
Dude the Vanilla CE is so rare and when it show up it is around 250‚Ç¨. I started Buying them when Mop came around and i am missing the Wotlk and Vanilla one.
---
But i have some cool Figures from Warcraft 3 and WC2 ;)
---
That‚Äôs brutal. Maybe time to scour eBay and complete your collection? :)
---
Hope we get a Server list before so the guilds can choose a Server and you have at least a guess what server will be healthy enough
---
you missed out on mop then. If WoW is the Titanic, and Cataclysm was the iceberg striking the ship, Mop was like the ship breaking in two, the ass end of the titanic going 90 degrees and plunging into the Atlantic. Everything since has been freezing idiots on lift rafts at night. 
---
Wrath had Firefighter, Freya hm, vezax, yogg 1 and 0 light, H Anub Arak, H LK that were all enjoyable progression fights. Where Firefighter, Yogg 1/0 and HLK are among the best ever. 
---
 elegon, will of the emperor, vizier, amber shaper, empress, durumu, animus, sha of fear, sha of pride, spoils, paragons, thok, nazgrim were all great fights to progress on. 
---
spirit kings, lei shen, siegecrafter, garrosh were up there, imo, with the best fights in wow (I loved the rng of spirit kings others HATED it).
---
The only duds in all of mop were the nearly 8 easy bosses in the first half of soo heroic, if tuned right, that instance could have taken even a progression, wowprogress oriented guild like ours many months. If Juggernaut was a tight dps race, if galakras didnt tickle the raid. If the shaman were even close to hard!!!
---
which instant attacks scale with a hunter's melee weapon?
---
Quite unlikely, it's unreasonable to expect random people you group with, to hand you 500 gold. Just because "you could use it".   
---
BoP items obviously go to the correct classes and specs, but BoE's have higher value sold than used, for the large majority of players.
---
to be fair those videos were amazing but context matters they fought bad frost mages and if any part of their plan backfired they died.
---
PSA summer starts december in the southern hemisphere
---
They will most likely open up a couple more servers and people who dislike overpopulation will start fresh there. I actually like a big pool of people on same server. Easier to find groups and most likely good raidpugs for those guildless will run daily.
---
sweet jesus that mage was bad. props to the shammy.
---
I think you're working under assumption the player cap will be massive like 5-10k per server. We don't know how big the servers will be.
---
pathetic? You're about to be part of one of the biggest gaming events in recent history, you enjoy this dude (but ofc game responsively number of hours per day)
---
Bulgaria and Romania are in the same pot, also Croatia, Serbia, Hungary and Greece too maybe, but I think they're doing a bit better. Basically all of Eastern Europe/The Balkans. This is for Romania but as I said, I expect Bulgaria to be pretty much the same. Cost of living is really low. Rent in the capital, for a 2-bedroom apartment in a decent zone is around 250-350$. With 100$ you can eat decently IF you cook and aren't a foodie. Public transport is 15$/mo for unlimited entries to the Subway for a month.
---
If you are not in a hurry, I suggest you wait till Classic Beta gets released. Depending which controlling method of starter zone chocking they will end up going with will decide the most efficient leveling plan. If you really want to practice a route now, there really is only one way to do it at the moment.
---
It's the same view on private or classic...
---
Then you start mind controlling horde off high places, and everything is right in the world and you realize that you have made the best choice ever.
---
I need to find a mouse with a ball in it.  I need to pick the lint off the rollers before every raid...NEED
---
patch 8.2 timing is kinda scary. Most indications point to a june/july release. IF 8.2 releases in June then we can expect a classic release around end of july/early august, but if 8.2 releases in july then we won't be getting classic until late august/early September.
---
so am i a noob for downloading raid frames? or is improving the ui and presentation of information in any way a signal of being bad? i heal by using an addon to tell me what my given healing spell will do on avg. I have raid frames that show the health deficit of the player. Am I bad for not figuring out the avg on my own, memorizing it (as opposed to having it on my action bar) then knowing my raid team well enough to know what the sliver of health they are missing in a sea of 40 health bars means?
---
Im not trying to pick a fight, just understand the mindset. 
---
scripts that execute my entire rotation from one button press i see as different from a addon that displays information to be more easily digested seems fine to me. 
---
The good rogue still has to react to the information his ticking addon shows him. And he can more reliably react to it. A shit rogue with or without the addon doesnt know how to take advantage of energy ticks. 
---
The good rogue doesnt have the addon and takes advantage of it successfully 80% of the time. The better rogue wrote or downloaded an addon that shows him when the ticks happening, success rate 100%. 
---
Just look at live wow, scrubs can get within 15 ilevels of mythic raid gear now. But mythic raiders, and mythic raids shit on these people, because even with the gear they just dont know how to play. Tools like addons are only powerful (or should be limited to only be powerful; see 1 button macros) in the hands of people who know how to take advantage of the information.
---
Man I use that in every aspect of my life, say something you know isn't true because people love to like they beat you and proved themselves right, you get the answer you needed also. In a funny way it's just respecting their motivations. Also funnt, Trump did this during his campaign though I don't recall a specific example.
---
tbh its just a game..Do I look forward to it and feel like every other game else is subpar? yes, Im catching up on tvseries and doing more workout these days. Once it hits I know that wont happen so, also I dont mind it hitting mid august when im done with vacation, sun, summerfun etc.
---
i copy pasted most from another fellow reddittor who is almost in an identical situation but on NA servers xD.. so thanks @

Played  a lot in vanilla (Alliance) all the way through to wotlk when i stopped. In vanilla played as a paladin (healer)  then switched to rogue in tbc. in the days of vanilla played in a casual raiding guild, we were late to the game so never got to experience aq40/nax others were cleared. A Skilled player, and a quick motiated learner but i don‚Äôt have time to be in a hardcore guild. Looking for a  relaxed, fun atmosphere with other people that are older with families  or full time workers that don‚Äôt plan to hit 60 until a month or 2 after  launch (personally tied down for 4 weeks in july when cannot play).  But I want a guild that is organized, skilled, and experienced  for raiding.
---
Also if guild would be into pvp possibly premades / world would be great fun.
---
For me, it was the undead female eviscerate animation that made me play rogue forever. Unfortunately it wasn't my main after Ulduar as I was the only of my friends that would actually tank. Sad times, but it also meant that I got to play warrior, druid and paladin (at the same time) until I abandoned the paladin and the warrior in MoP.
---
I can't believe how much time I spent keeping those characters up to speed with the gear. At least I'm fairly confident that I will only have 1 main in classic as I'm not 15 anymore. So maybe it's time for an undead female rogue revival?!
---
I wonder if the new client they use will have old Ironforge in it for example.
---
I think it's likely that 1.4 and 1.5 items get introduced in phase 2. So far Blizzard looks to be determined to introduce the items as it was back in vanilla.
---
Yea I selfishly hope so too as I am planning on rolling warrior tank.
---
&gt; Most people elect not to do it.
---
This, it's a very high risk for relatively little reward. You have to learn two sets of mechanics (ranged and melee) and keep track of those mechanics and get put in the melee dangerzone for the reward of slightly higher DPS (yeah, you'll look great on the DPS meters as long as you stay alive)       
---
However for 5mans this deadzonedance is a great boost. The increased DPS is a very noticable boost in this situation.
---
STOP TOYING WITH MY EMOTIONS!!
---
The first run I'll go guideless.    
---
But for the alts I've always stuck to the WoW-Pro levelling add-on. There are other (probably better) options out there by now but it has become such a staple I've gotten stuck on it.     
---
(Then again, I've always been one of those "CTMod + TitanPanel nothing else" types)
---
That PTR was world of rogue craft... t2 rogues EVERYWHERE. I remember they gave you the dragonfang blade dagger from vael and you could pew pew ppl. The ships from menethil had raid groups full of rogues waiting for alliance
---
The end game isn't particularly hard. It's getting there that is hard, and I am not just talking time. You are going to die far more often leveling in vanilla than in retail.
---
Druids can dodge and be bubbled and never even notice it. Unlike warrior tanks.
---
Because Druids generate rage differently than a warrior tank does. A warrior tank gets most of his rage from Being Hit while generating almost nothing from attacks.
---
Druids generate most of their rage from attacks, and very little from being hit. And due to a sheer lack of buttons to press and an incredibly slow weapon for their dump, they aren't dumping all their rage every 3 seconds like a warrior is. 
---
A lot of the rage they generate from damage taken ends up wasted because they just can't spend it fast enough combined with what they generate from attacking.
---
It's far better to go all in on dodge and even get bubbled from time to time if you expect a big hit coming in, since it's barely barely going to dent your rage generation as a druid, which will utterly wreck a warrior if he tries that.
---
Since tehy aren't the same. The difference is about as big as the difference between how a warrior and a paladin tanks. There are similarities, but the specifics are different.
---
The Mayans were off by about 8 and a half years. Also, it‚Äôs not the world that ends but our lives.
---
It may objectively take more time, but since ubrs and lbrs is relevant for your BIS grind, you are spending far less time compared to alliance if you do the quest at level 60 so it doesn‚Äôt feel like anything at all compared to alliance version.
---
I haven't smoked anything for years now but would to join you nonetheless as well, that sounds awesome ;)
---
Yes, but then you would not truly enjoy your outside time, knowing that you are missing out launch days. Part of the fun is to be there since the beginning, rushing and trying to get ahead. So for (very) few of us, september is the ideal date.
---
Exactly, and I do hope it's bigger than in 2006. 
---
Private servers did it with 10k even more. People played, worked fine, sometimes to many people ofc. But around 5-10k for me would be ideal, atleast for me. In this case open up fewer servers with higher cap, then open up more would be great for those who like it more low pop, since those people will start on the new server.
---
This is just my theory and wishes.
---
I'm pretty sure Blizzard has a plan for this that we simply do not know about yet.
---
It makes me so uncomfortable to think that there are other countries than the USA. Idk
---
Tack on a couple prot talents for the extra survivability and the pace is not that bad. Those oh shit buttons really help if you over pull or someone tries to gank you. Once you get Truesilver chest and sword it's a whole new world. You rarely have to stop with enough procs. 
---
I haven't played WoW in many years... might have to get a second PC and jump in again.
---
wasn't that "in front of you", instead of "random"?
---
Longer than the game has been out? That's impressive!
---
I'm still debating about whether to go PvP or RP-PvP (if there is any). I absolutely love roleplay but I already have limited time to actually play. Joining an RP server means leveling like 10x slower hahaha
---
&gt; Where do you live?
---
Iran
---
Yeah, funny how people think the company that's making a complex game like WoW wouldn't know how to find a solution to a simple problem like population balance.
---
shhh
---
brb, setting up an automatic spam-F5 script.
---
Would you just do a princess run or a full run? I would say from the fastest path jumping to lava it would take 30-40min for a smooth run and for a absolut full clear 1-1.5h, and ofc it depends on gear aswell.
---
&gt; Instances are comprised of an Outer Entrance, typically looking like some sort of.. dungeon.
---
It's a sad thought that many people never see the entrances of instances now. I remember the first time 'discovering' the RFC instance and wondering what it is. Or the first time standing in front of the WC entrance and 2 manning the elites with my druid and some random shaman I met and kept leveling with.
---
Thanks. I'm glad to learn more.
---
It's because of animations. Human female and UD male have the best animations, that's why they are the most popular for each faction.
---
It doesn't matter if you're handed BiS, you still do less damage than an offtank and you provide zero benefits to your team.
---
Each to their own. If you want to read quest text go for it, if someone wants to use a mod because they like to be efficient, who cares. 
---
The problem with retail is the developers tell you how to play the game, exactly like the ‚Äúno mods‚Äù crowd.  The fantastic thing about classic is people have the freedom to choose how to play let‚Äôs not have the community take that away from us like the devs have done with retail.
---
Big tv usually stretches pixels I even play my consoles on a monitor for that reason.. but there are tv's made for it.
---
Swiftness potion, free action potion
---
I glad you are sharing In my pain. Was about to be on the last boss in bed when we got the 10min notice lol
---
Good to know, that Hit is more of a Endgame thing. That leaves Holy or Ret. But if Vengeeance is as good as i heard it is (and helps solo leveling), then ill just finish Ret (and get the Move speed next) and start with holy after 40. Thanks!
---
I guess 14 years and 6 months?...
---
I just did 2019 - 2004 = 15 ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
You'd think it should just be an active sub. I can't see them forcing anyone to buy BFA to play classic, it would be such bad will.
---
So you have to use full consumables while at the same time convincing everyone else to use zero consumables??
---
But it‚Äôs too bright for the screen
---
I am looking for a large gaming TV. Are there any?
---
Going for the Logitech G13 + G602 combo for Classic.
---
My SO booked us an hotel in Paris the third week of August. So its safe to assume that wow classic is going to be released during that time.
---
Isn't she sent by Azshara to help Kael'Thas escaping Humans?
---
I agree with skill being a big if not biggest factor. If you spend some time solo questing, tanking some and surviving some I'm fucked situations, you'll be better for it. 
---
Gear will be a factor, but not a crippling one. I've gone 1 on 1 with chars that well out geared mine and have been destroyed. But I've also beaten them. It really does come down to knowing your character.
---
Yes but to be honest with you I'm not tech savvy enough to confidently point you in a direction any better than a Google search would.. I honestly forget what it's called.. I'm sure someone will post it here soon. Haha.
---
&gt; Imagine being happy with your gear
---
And knowing the gear you worked hard for won't be replaced in 1 month.
---
There are some, but IIRC they are all damn expensive. Try searching "Linus Tech Tips gaming TV" - They reviewed a few of them and talk about the topic in general.
---
What is going on in here
---
If you are not in group and tagg the mobs as low level, then have a 60 kill everything you recieve 100% of the XP. So yes its very possible to power lvl
---
&gt; are PC monitors made for gaming? 
---
you are kidding, right?
---
PC Monitors are always better for gaming then normal TVs. They have better resolutions, less delay, and so on
---
I remember the premade characters, making an Undead mage and dying trying to aoe all of SM down. Thought I'd be God in all t2!
---
Then I made a warrior and thought they SUCKED because Ashkandi wasn't doing much work with full t2 tank set. 
---
[This duel tournament video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6sgfbEjVuo) is from that PTR. We copied our characters over, because they were better than t2 premades by that point. Remember how fun it was to meet/duel the big boys from other servers like Ssunken, Ming, etc. on my feral druid.
---
Pally defenitly
---
I haven't seen it here but I read that Human Female has the largest weapon-to-character ratio. My guess is that combined with the Human Racials makes up for a lot of Human Female Rogues and Warriors.
---
Human Males are just kind of weird with robes and they run funny so most casters will be female as well.
---
AFAIK, the very best premades run with 2 priests and 1 pally/shaman in WSG. Offensive dispel is a must vs other premades that use free action potions and BoF.
---
There are some subtle differences between a TV and a PC monitor.
---
As you have mentioned a TV usually have better colours and contrasts compared to a PC monitor. On the other hand a PC monitor usually have higher or same refresh rate, but they are much better at working an max refresh rate.
---
For gaming in general a higher refresh rate is preffered. For movies or working with photography colour and contrasts are important, that's why there are specific really expensive PC monitors for that purpose. For WoW it does not matter that much either way as the game is rarely "fast enough" to care much about high refresh rate. All games have limitations to their graphics that creates a "bottleneck" for how much color and contrast is needed, usually far below what any monitor can handle.
---
Razer Hex has 6 buttons, but look into Razer Trinity. If I were to buy a multi-button mouse I'd go for the Trinity purely for the concept. I've had both the Naga and the Corsair Scimitar (12 side buttons), and they both broke down, they are incredibly flimsy. I've used a Logitech normal mouse with 2 side buttons and never looked back. MMO mice are overrated imo, you can't be as accurate or as fast with your thumb as opposed to 4 fingers on the left hand, especially since the buttons are so small and you'd have to twist your thumb in awkward angles, fat-fingering anything around.
---
The Irony is that Horde vs Alliance is scuffed too because of the way they decided to go with Garrosh.
---
I know I'll be a undead warlock. My chef is aware that I'll be playing wow non stop. Want want finger food.. Y pr
---
Arter know I'm doing this. If she doesn't agree then she has to leave me.

Wrath &gt; WoD &gt; Legion &gt; BC &gt; Cata &gt; Vanilla &gt; MoP.

(Insert unpopular opinion puffin here)
---
Extra movement speed is not really handy when u level with a friend... u just keep outrunning them no?
---
Both druids and paladins can tank five mans with ease but there is a stigma attached to both so you might struggle to be accepted as a group tank, particularly if you roll paladin. Guildmates will probably be more accepting of you in that role.  
---
For levelling solo, druids will be fastest and warriors slowest. If you're levelling as a duo then a warrior with a pocket healer is very viable and will make getting dungeon groups very easy. Levelling a warrior solo, particularly as your first character on a fresh server, is for masochists.  
---
For raiding, warriors will be the tank of choice but most warriors will be DPSing. Druid tanks are viable and are easy to gear up but you might struggle to convince your guild to take you. By far, the majority of druids will be healing. Paladins *can* tank raids but mostly, they can't. As a paladin, you'll be healing.  
---
Most importantly though, level what you enjoy playing because you're going to spend a lot of time staring at the back of your character's head.
---
The internet doesn't work that way.
---
Then you reroll. Unless you know that you are so close to burn out that you only have one more full leveling experience left in you.
---
That's crazy talk!
---
They really aren't, that's what I thought at first too, until the Naga and the Scimitar I had broke down and I didn't want to invest in another one and moved to full-on keyboard binds again with a 2-side-button mouse. I've noticed significant improvement in response time with the keyboard as opposed to the thumb buttons. The buttons are small, the feedback is almost void and the entire mouse is just flimsy, gimmicky.
---
Really? I dont play alliance, but to me HU female always looked kind of wonky and half baked in the the animations. Kind of like how ehen you were a kid and a girl wanted to play with swords, but since she never watched any movies with sword fighting, she had no idea how to wield it.
---
&gt; paladins are pretty unkillable with full t3 with naxx shield
---
I was wondering, is it even worth ranking as a Hpally? Since for Hpallies, it seems raiding gear is way better?
---
I always thought HU males look great as melee classes though, broad shoulders and a good set of animations. All is subjective of course
---
Samsung Q9FNAA, just bought mine and I'm amazed.

Do not buy OLED for gamming as pixels will burn for static images like HUD.
---
There is this youtuber Quantum Apostesis(?) that does really good reviews with professional equipment, he does short videos with in deepth review for many TV's.
---
I'll take it upon myself to take your assessment apart piece by piece, my dude. 
---
1. If you're mentioning "the LGBT agenda" anywhere it isn't the topic at hand, you look like a delusional fedora to anyone sane.
---
2. It's a fucking video game about orcs and magic. It isn't that deep. Relax.
---
3. Saying "beta males" non ironically makes you such a goddamn cringe lord. Go back to Facebook so you can post more statuses about all women being bitches and whores.
---
4. Body disphoria is a terrible mental condition for people to go through it, but you're a disease.
---
Well, shit. That explains that. Strange that they were selling such a nice mouse and then stopped. Situations like this always make me wonder if there are reputable third party solutions to mail you a mouse directly from a country that sells it.
---
Who is only using 1... There's a lot of casual elitests who look at what hardcore private servers do for their raid comps, and then try to spew that to other people as the only way to do things.
---
Yeah, maybe for sppedruns on pservers where many minor things are incorrect, but in actual classic, you'd find all walks of life in every raid.
---
The problem with classic is that it's an old game, tons of ppl have played it for thousands of ours so they feel qualified to tell others how to play. Like me I speak English my entire life, does that qualify me to try and teach others how to speak? Just cause I had a kid and became a parent, am I qualified to tell others how to parent? The same thing is happening here.
---
There are people who give good advice, but most of the pserver minmax babies are not them.
---
Wait till people kill kelthuzad with a night elf shadow priest or an undead warrior, they'll lose their shit.
---
&gt; Hunters have one of the best, if not, the best gold farming tactics in the game.
---
What is that? :)
---
I really hope you aren't serious.
---
Model editing like it existed in vanilla has not been possible for a while. That being said there are morph programs people use now which can do it. I assume someone will make something for classic
---
It'd be nice if they released them at the same time so we don't get so many retail tourists on launch day.
---
I‚Äôm ready! Routes planned. Main decided. Alts decided. Professions decided! Bring me the horizon!
---
Saying you were x back in vanilla is like an anti-credential. It means literally nothing now, even world first guilds were trash let alone some random server's top 5 which probably meant worst raiding guild on the server.
---
That‚Äôs the most American thing I‚Äôve read today
---
Isn't shaman for classic going to be one race only again like it was originally?
---
The perfect spagett for the situation.
---
People actually *live* in those countries. Can you believe that? Brb paying my $49,000 hospital bill on minimum wage, might take me a minute
---
True but i doubt they would ever do that. Blizzard has been known to time and space out their content around their monthly subs and other mmo releases. 1 month difference between classic and 8.2 would be quite a compromise for them
---
You seem to know a lot of priests. For being effective at PvP, would you say raiding gear is better than PvP gear? Say, T2 vs epic pvp set, what do you prefer?  I was watching a stream (Cader) of a very good premade and the priest was using T2 instead of PvP set.
---
Finally the good content
---
Fine... Have my upvote sir...
---
No actual blizzlike server gets that wrong since it's published how it is supposed to work.
---
Play during the night, be outside and active during the day!
---
This isn't 2005. They can spin up new servers in minutes not months.
---
The 200IQ move is to power the laptop using the bike. Then no cycling. No WOW.
---
I think the biggest problem here is not viability.
---
The Raid has 2/3 Tank Spots normaly, why would you take something that is not optimal.
---
WAR is one of the most played classes on p-servers and most likely on Retail too, will will absoluty have no issue finding a raid tank. It will be the other way around, Tanks will have abit of an issue finding a raid.
---
So why would you ever not take war as a tank.
---
Especially while already in combat at half health..
---
Roll a dice then
---
Why has Mr Monoply got WOW classic hidden in his jacket?
---
This is the story of my life currently.... GIVE ME THE GAME!
---
Ok so it's only true for 90% of guilds. My b.
---
We wouldn't want them to do anyway.  
---
The classes were more perfectly balanced in recent expansions and it's super boring and linear.  
---
It means that ilvl = dps and there's little else to consider. I prefer vanilla's perfect imbalance &lt;3
---
I am so happy with Naxx being the last raid instance to complete in Classic. I never really liked AQ40 but Naxx was always a cool instance.
---
I really wish there were more people putting this opinion forward. There's a lot more role play involved in how I remember classic. Play what you like and don't get caught up in what the min max private server guys say.
---
At cast - I played Vanilla as a mage for entire retail vanilla and TBC. Best example is Blizzard which hits multiple targets and can hit some targets after few seconds (when they enter active blizzard). You never got CC from hits as you could even get CC from evade.
---
I leveled a female blood elf mage when bc launched for this exact reason. Oh and arcane torrent too I guess.
---
And the retail shouldn't server lag during 20v20 world pvp but it does. Technology is not the only obstacle.
---
Barrens, Home. At least it was before Deathwing fucked everything up.
---
Can someone make /r/unexpectedretard
---
Like Nihilum right?
---
Legolamb works too
---
It's also good for getting a Jump start on the gold farming. If you can gather a huge chunk of Gold while waiting for everyone to catch you up then you'll be free to grind less throughout the game. Which then allows me to take the time to do other things, like the Frostsaber Quest, Camp Tidal Charm etc
---
I get both sides.
---
I think you will always hear People complaining... Some People prefer leveling with Questie - others rather read the quest text's.
---
I presume some People that used to say questio is for noobs might now use it because they have gone through the leveling a couple of times and now just want to reach max asap..
---
Everyone is able to Play the way they like - thats the great Thing about WoW
---
I wager they'll be quite reluctant to, because they definitely anticipate a high percentage of tourists. Hence why they want to use sharding, to fill servers to greater than their capacity, so that they'll still be full after the tourists leave.
---
I like how this video casually mentions making rank 13 for gear.
---
holy shit where do you live? That's expensive
---
Hi all! I narrowed my class choice to Priest (...or maybe Pally? Damn it!). Now for race though: Human or Dwarf? They both get a different spell right? I like both races the same so I guess it depends on their racial specs/skills for me.
---
Heir to the panty sniffing fortune ?
---
Rank 10 works fine aswell. And rank 10 is no sweat
---
Difference between good pc monitor and TV is like first time seeing colors for colorblind.
---
Buy 244 hz monitor. They are cheap nowdays.
---
Genius!
---
The warrior can charge, the paladin can't
---
Sweden, some bars have cheap ass beer, like around 3-4 dollars if u take it in USD, but my local bar takes around 7-8 dollars for a beer there, and a drink for like 10-12 dollars
---
I lucked out and married a rich woman. I do whatever I want pretty much all the time. I don't deserve this life. I didn't work for it. I'll take it though.
---
Let me know if you want some help/inspiration, I'm a personal trainer IRL.
---
Wait so did I just experience someone demolishing a decade old meta for hunter dps? Does this mean hunter is a competitive dps along the other pure dps now?
---
Please, don't game on a TV if you have the option afforded to you to own a monitor.  Not everyone is fortunate enough to own an expensive gaming monitor but it's absolutely better.
---
Maybe download some audiobooks as well? You'll be able to go through a bunch while leveling.
---
Yep that bugs me a bit. Dudes, next week its May and we still don‚Äôt know the exact release date.
---
I plan to take a few days off work for it, so I hope it wont be a too short notice
---
Just watch some PvP and PvE (raiding) videos of classes you‚Äôd like to play. Other than that just join a guild and ask questions, your guildies will be there to help you along the way.
---

---
Your answer is in this first section.
---
There are, 127$ delivery.
---
I recall Amazon graying out the "economy" option, and only showing the "express".
---
Ah okay, that makes it relative. I live in Germany where, to be fair, beer is kinda overproduced and I can get a 'Ma√ü' (which is 1l) for like 4-6‚Ç¨ at events. 
---
But since the salaries in Sweden are also higher than in Germany, I guess everything might be a bit more expensive as well.
---
At first I bound mine to the num keys, but discovered num lock was a big annoyance. Then moved to F1 to F12 keys for WoW, 1 to = for anything else (you can have profiles that activate when you enter a specific app).
---
Timeless isle was probably the only thing I enjoyed about MoP, where as the levelling felt like a chore, the Asian theme grew stale VERY quickly, raids were boring, dungeons had next to no diversity, Pandaren were a joke race, (I know they were in WC3, but all they did was make bad jokes and be clumsy), and the daily grinds still give me ptsd to this day.
---
Cmon man, think a bit. The only "lgbt agenda" is their wish to be able to live their life the way they want, just like straight people.
---
I plan to go 20/31/0 paladin. Heal on raid bosses, tank in 5man content and maybe trash.
---
What could possibly go wrong...
---
why classic hate?
---
If you don't like lvling your time to 60 will be tough! As it's a big part of the WoW classic game to lvl.
---
Not really workout related, but what would you recommend for meal prepping? I'm thinking every week I'll make a healthy meal to eat while playing wow, so that I dont snack or eat junk like hot pockets or dominos.
---
I've had all of those things ready for a loooong time, pretty much since Classic was announced! I've not decided what food to eat, but I have figured out what guild I will be inn! It sounds like that is something you would like to as well? 
---
If so, did you know there is a discord for guilds to recruit in for classic? There are already tons of promising guilds out there, with different ideologies and sizes and ambitions, finding one for yourself to meet your future guildmates is a huge deal! Head on over to the Classic WoW Guilds Discord where there are already 3800+ members! You don't want to miss out, believe me

hunters in every loot roll
---
That's not correct. HoT portion gets 10% of the +healing per tick, direct portion gets 20% of the +healing. So if you have +100 healing you get 20 more healing on the direct part and 10 more healing per tick. 
---
Every actual blizzlike server gets this correct because it's correct already in the mangos core.
---
The joke is already done a million times over. This same fucking joke is half of this subs content.
---
UBRS and LBRS are nice for a new toon, sure, but the travel part really drags on. The four dragons are spread over the complete world, Emberstrife is at the end of the world (for Horde) and you have to find a dude several times who patrols across two whole zones.
---
Horde just takes a lot longer, but it's an epic quest across continents, so it's actually quite nice.
---
I was indeed like your friend, any zone with a lot of trees took me to 5 fps and most major cities were a slideshow for me and a struggle to get through. Hell, even busy Maplestory maps were too much. This experience of WoW will be so different this time around with a way too expensive gaming setup bought for this summer I can't wait to try it outüëçüèª
---
u aint wild u just a tourist
---
This is a document of history. You should upload it to youtube aswell to ensure logivety.
---
1. Vanilla is not hard. You just have to think about what enemies you can kill, spend talents and gold wisely etc.
---
2. Yes and you have to buy weapon skill at weapon trainer as well.
---
3. You just need to stand before dungeon and ask people if you can join or write to global chat. Once you understand how it works its easy.
---
4. Experince playing any class will be completely different.
---
I always have baked chicken on hand with lots of fibrous greens, and carbs on the side. I love the stuff and I inhale it, lol.
---
But it depends on your likes and dislikes. Things you can cook in bulk that are nutritious and healthy are brothy kind of concoctions. Healthy and good old fashioned soups, with blended/cut-up greens and a bit of meat in them NEVER fail. Low in calories, nutrient dense, and will last a whole week, even if you eat for every meal. Slow-cooker type deals also work a treat! If you take the last option and combine it in to soft tacos, you got yourself a protein and carb rich meal!
---
Also lots of water, can't be undersold!
---
I'm in this picture and I don't like it.
---
I liked a bit for the ¬´¬†hunter¬†¬ª. Should be in the same class as the rest pally /s
---
That glorious 17 inch 4:3 CRT &lt;3
---
I mean, did you check the links? I opened his five most recent raids. 0 healing and his guild-wide DPS was #10, #10, #17, #18, #18. That's pretty god awful.
---
Look at his Sapphiron. He cannot even sustain half the DPS the true DPS can keep up (he is at 200 dps, most dps are at 450-700 dps).
---
That server has non-blizzlike armor values that lower his DPS but I would not call any of that "record breaking". Frankly, holy priests can even do more DPS than that.
---
Sure, I am all in favor of not taking this game too seriously. But that DPS is rather pitiful.
---
I also went back a few raids. They take more than an hour to clear MC and he is #9 in the raid I found. He can't scratch 400 DPS in any situation.
---
I think that will be the case - they will then open more Servers just to realize that 80% of the People stop playing after a couple of month because it takes too Long to reach 60 :P
---
Then they will Close a couple of Servers again offering free Server Transfers - you heard it here first bois :)
---
Quick shout out to Josh. Great show, great quality podcasts mate. Will you continue with the show once classic hits? Sharing your ingame experience e.g.?
---
On topic: just go with druid and name him 'Canbeara' ;-)
---
Im currently moving, was just packing that thing in a box. I have all the CE's ... last i bought was MOP (didnt play on it much).
---
It's like you know my mind
---
Not an option, gotta work also :)
---
You as well know my mind
---
You know my reality and it pains me
---
Boiled/steamed Broccoli with chicken breast filet lightly salted and peppered, chicken fried on pan with only splash of oil, I use an oil with some lemon in adds some flavour. If you want to be fancy throw in some diced or sliced red pepper fruit when the chicken is almost done.
---
Cauliflower boiled or steamed, with fish, not too fatty a fish. But go for some good white meat fish. 
---
You can also take some parsnips, carrots and potatoes and slice them into "fries" and drizzle some oil and different spices on them, mix it slowly together so it doesn't get mashed, and place in an oven and cook in there.
---
I think the intent is to play, eat, sleep. There is no time for outside.
---
I absolutely hate the combination of lemon and chicken, so I probably wont do that, but I love broccoli and cauliflower so I will definitely have a bunch of those. Parsnips taste like acid to me, but carrot fries sound pretty good...
---
The world map doesn't have quest marks though?
---
I kind of disagree with OC. Warlocks are *the* least gear dependent caster. Stack Stam, spell power, int. With voidwalker out, you should be able to outlive most jumps on you, fear and reset. Always carry a Health / soulstone.
---
There's no reason past level 30 that a Warlock sound be feeling vulnerable - except when very aggressively grinding; chain pulling 2-4 mobs is fast xp, but does leave you vulnerable. 
---
Pop potions + healthstones (separate CDs iirc). 
---
Fear.
---
Always fear.
---
You can also add some sesame seeds to the chicken, then oven cook them instead.
---
I like a little lemon cest with my chicken sometimes, but other than that I agree.. basicly you can throw on anything you want as long as it isnt fatty. So go for some nice herbs if you want. Thyme is also good to try out. And rosemary
---
Actually would be very nice to get 2 pints of beer for 4‚Ç¨. And I‚Äôve heard that german beer is very good
---
lol no, just normal players playing in 2019 rather than 2004.
---
They are planning to use sharding to combat this. I absolutely agree they will underestimate the interest, but at the same time I think it wont take long to accomodate for that.
---
It's the best beer in the world, seriously. There are tourist tours solely around beer. Like where I live there is a "Altbier-Safari".
---
I really don't like the german kitchen but if we can do one thing it's brewing beer.
---
Goddamit there always has to be some retard spouting identity politics and 4chan to ruin a perfectly normal thread
---
Are you saying that the side with the streamer will be more populated? Or the opposite side more populated with people that want to kill the streamer?
---
Tweaking class viability so things like Retribution Paladin, Balance Druid, Shadow Priest etc were actually useful and viable for end game PvE content.
---
I really hope you're right.
---
Guild banks, but not the overly upgraded kind they added, just a NPC vendor you could drop items off, so the leaders didn't need to relog on alts.
---
Shadow priests are useful though
---
Not in PvE end game content. They have a high damage output but their mana drains very quickly.
---
If only cycling produced that much power
---
As an Hunter can i send my pet to attack while Im cc'd like sap ir polymorphed?
---
I am hoping for no transfers. I rather see merges
---
I think you mean 144hz
---
Sharding doesn't help with 3k queues at all.
---
Can i track hidden as Hunter while tracking Herbalism?
---
Same. I hope someone comes out with a mod or some addon that allows that toggle if blizz decides not to implement.
---
Can't auto shot while casting aim shot and multi shot delaying your autos makes u lose dps. Meleeing between autos at some points in your rotation adds dps.   
---
Weapon speeds important for this since you only have so much time before you lose auto shot time. Too slow melee swing timer and you'll be waiting in melee when u could be auto shotting.  
---
T2 &gt; T3 if you have alot of hunters or if your some of your hunters suck they should wear T2 ( support role). Reason being T2 bonus adds a proc'd debuff that adds 450 RAP to all users hitting the target.
---
This imo is the meat of his break down. There's more to it and details of how everything plays out but there it is. Not very short for a TLDR though lol.
---
Does everything in your life revolve around your specific point of view regarding that particular observation? You obviously fucking care, because you cannot for the life of your wrap your peanut brain around the fact that people are different.
---
No one is hating classic here. It's just community comes out a tad insecure constantly shitting on retail. Let people enjoy things they enjoy. I said things like that in the past myself and I can see how stupid they are now.
---
It would, and i don't think they will but its Actiblizz... who knows?!
---
Tf is this post..
---
 Anyway monitor better for gaming, especially when mouse/keyboard, I just can't imagine moving my cursor with input lag which is a thing all TVs have compared to monitor..
---
But you can play solo gamepad games on a TV, when input lag isn't bothering your experience..
---
And yes I have a very good 4k 65' TV, but monitor is better for the most of my games, just buy one with good Hz (mine is 165hz but 144hz is almost the same thing and way cheaper if it's not g-sync).
---
New Models are one of those things that would not affect gameplay in any shape or form. I am with you on this one. I want to roll a female UD warrior and I so much prefer their new model including hair styles and all.   
---
It's just a freaking toggle button! PLZ GIF TOGGLE MODLE BLIZZ!
---
I disagree with you most people going into Vanilla know what kind of grind it requires. There is way more to do than just level in wow also all community aspects back.
---
Without a lot of these additional items, the MC loot sucks quite a bit, especially when you remove T2, which presumably will never drop from MC this time (raggy legs aside) so I really doubt they will hold it off.
---
With a 40% drop rate and a limit of five instances per hour, you're getting two per hour.
---
Boo. Doesn't have the farmers.
---
For those that don't know, off the eastern coast of Arathi Highlands, there's a farm with two dwarfs living there, they don't have any speech or anything, but it's a neat little area.
---
Hmmmm. Well for me personally I like playing human male on warrior/paladin and female for everything else, the guys are far too muscular for clothie classes imo. Night Elf male absolutely sucks as casters imo, they look like they need to take a shit. Hunters also have that dumb gangster bow shit that makes them look like a GTA character instead of a millennia old archer. Gotta admit that they look pretty cool as warriors/rogues, gives me demon hunter vibes
---
Also I think there's some "culture" around picking female characters. From my observations a vast majority of the hardcore/top players on both retail and pservers pick female characters. Its just something they do, I think it started in Wrath when humans got Every Man For Himself and a couple of famous PvPers switched from male Undead to female human
---
It's a joke. the line in the episode is "why Charlie hate?"
---
Dude, if you're all about your ret pally you can make it work for sure. 100%. Gotta be more dedicated than other players(consumes etc.) , and no, you wont top the dps charts, but you'll do WAY more than you'd expect
---
Level 1's can die from a campfire, if they aren't a warrior
---
@serasangel Awesome read! Could you specify more around the delay speeds between weapons. Breaking down and specify which appropiate speed are desired between the ranged and melee weapon. I feel there is missing some info here. Otherwise, totally loved your guide.
---
It's a matter of preference. I prefer the new models any day. Having a toggle to display new models or old would affect absolutely nothing about the classic experience. People who want old models can leave the toggle off while others would turn it on.  
---
Don't get me wrong, I am still going to play Classic however it comes our way but I'd love to have me some new models in there.
---
So much this! I'm really looking forward to the release but a later date means more fun outside not wasted wanting to be inside playing a fucking video game that will kill my social life all over again. :D
---
In-game calender for guild raid attendances and such
---
Also guild bank as in retail.
---
Uhm yeah, it does. If your server limit is 5k instead of 2.5k due to sharding, it massively reduces waiting times. Thats the whole point.
---
Make an underground train like the one in SW/IF and make it neutral so horde and alliance can use it. I want some train standoffs.
---
One way or another it's going to be a morning or midnight release for someone.
---
Warriors and rouges are a dime a dozen. There's no pros to either because everybody and their mothers will be playing them.
---
I'm doing something similar but going to Holy Shock the heretics and refuse to heal everyone who questions me!
---
It's back up!
---
The ability to show enemy cast bars would be nice. As far as I'm aware addons for that can be fairly unreliable.
---
You bots always need the last word !
---
It was never one race only for Horde, or at the very least it had changed by the time I started raiding in 1.8.  Orcs, trolls, and tauren were the allowed shaman races.
---
Play on a server withowest. Or alphabet.
---
Sorry, I haven't watched that show.
---
Hmm, I know they did the world simultaneous release for BFA, didn't think they'd do it for Classic tbh, but who knows!
---
Survival Hunter combining melee/range/tank/pet/spells is king of 1vs1 pvp. You will need to learn how pets work. You will need to learn how to combine multiple abilities into one with macros. Once you do your first macro its gonna be easy.
---
Its probably most complex and hardest class to play in pvp.
---
 [http://vanillawowhunter.com/](http://vanillawowhunter.com/)
---
Any advice for someone whos vegetarian?
---
Yes. Sadly we can't gauge how many people bought it exactly due to sharding but I barely saw anyone on when I played.
---
Briefly. In Classic you'll be able to clear AQ-BWL-MC in 4 hours, so until you reach Naxxramas, 2 day will barely be used. Outside of raids, there'll be world bosses. You can't plan around world bosses, so it's expected that you scout and show up on spawn if you're available.
---
r/grannygan
---
I would wager moving characters up and down the list will be one of the QoL things they keep
---
What i understand from all the FAQ's is that sharding only would be live first couple of weeks. 
---
Correct me if im wrong please.
---
After 2-3 weeks they go back to normal?
---
Under. Not a chance. The furthest I'd think they'd go is Wrath since that was the peak of WoWs popularity and the end of the expanded talent trees.
---
Both true and untrue i guess. It's not that much different compared to running around the world gathering herbs and stuff. Farming is farming either way. It can just get a bit more frustrating if the dropchance is simply against you ^^ Then again, you can always miss out on those juicy mine ores or herbs because that one guy is faster than you - just as frustrating I suppose...
---
Where there is money, there is greed.  
---
If WoW classic hit wrath popularity you really dont think they'd want to abuse it as a cash cow?
---
Because the game was rewarding throughout all stages. Wiping through and getting some tier pieces in Kara was amazing for me, I totally didnt mind that competent raiders were beating Illidan at the same time. Nowadays you would have BT level gear while still being shit. So either you do content that gives you nothing or try to do content you had no chance of beating.
---
eeeeeeeeeeeeeEEESPAGET
---
No, because its included in your normal WoW sub. The only way that happens if it becomes an extra fee to cover the costs of something like that, and if they ever charged an extra fee for it, the community would have an uproar.
---
Or just use your char out in the world. Gnomeregan is only a 4 minute ride away from where your hearthstone is going to be ;)
---
This, i wasnt allowed to spec Shadow in raid until we had content on farm.
---
Soups would still be my go-to, but I honestly have very little experience with vegetarians and vegans, but I can point you in the direction of a strong dude who eats entirely vegan and has shared a few of his recipes - [here's](https://barbend.com/clarence-kennedy-vegan-breakfast/) a Barbend article on him, Clarence Kennedy. An absolute fucking monster, and fully-fledged vegan!
---
They havent said anything concrete yet. But yeah, thats the idea: Compensating for the initial influx without creating multiple ghost realms
---
Thanks a lot! I‚Äôll Have a look!
---
Probably both, people want to play with their favorite streamers, and people want to murder their least favorite streamers.
---
It's likely one of the hardest things to balance out so probably wont ever happen but yes considering lots of changes was put on hold in end of vanilla to be implemented in TBC tells you that blizzard was aware of some of the specs werent so great.
---
I just tested it on a level 1 rogue. Couldn't be done.
---
I'm not suggesting that I want them to actually do this. It's just a hypothetical lol.
---
The sharding is supposed to be only for starting zones for a limited time. You can't increase server limit with this system unless you do some game breaking system like queues for each zones.
---
If sharding will work on the whole world the game is dead on the arrival.
---
Well leveling spec doesn't really matter that much, because you can get to lvl 60 anyways for some its just going to be slower than others.
---
So yeah lvl 60 is what i meant, also i remember hearing that reckbombs woudn't work in vanilla.
---
"heheheh ill let him kill the mob and wait till its really low hp then just backstab it"
---
In frost we trust. 
---
AoE frost mage guide I used back in Vanilla/bc area.
---
You are very mistaken if you think a undergeared (blue) warrior will hit mortal strikes for anywhere near 2k, even on cloth. Go look up some pvp videos, people with bwl/aq40 gear doesnt even do 2000 dmg with mortal strike on cloth or leather. 1200 on cloth is feasable, 2000 is a dream number unless we're talking a ton of buffs and berserking in a battleground.
---
Almost, I have to get a desk and TV (better than monitors to me for wow) and new SSD for my PC kuz my laptop can‚Äôt even run retail on minimal specs but runs vanilla servers on medium just fine. Only reason I don‚Äôt use my PC is the HDD is over 8 years old and it‚Äôs dying (don‚Äôt wanna lose my stuff) but I‚Äôll have a nice budget battle station as soon as I get a release date!
---
Ofc he's right. Those are not Indie-Devs or Game Publishers we are talking about. Even if it sometimes doesn't look that way, they know their shit and certainly have thought of stuff a random reddit user also has already
---
I'd much prefer morning, but if they go the BFA route it'll be 11pm for us Brits. Fine with me also.
---
Both. Also I'd try to avoid joining one of those servers AT ALL COSTS. It will be HELL. Streamsnipers etc, GL trying to quest in the same zone as a popular streamer
---
[Here ya go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFwcvX52Vks). Can be done with 60% mount. The blue rune on the ground beside the quest NPC will teleport into the cave near the dragon you need for the quest.
---
Also, [backup strats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GU5DqxmAUnM)!
---
just last week i couldn't get on battle net and had a queue, doubt they will handle this well.
---
Dragonstalker Gloves off Flamegor. 
---
I was 7/8 for about 9 months. In the 75+ times (due to server crash resets and alts runs) my guild did BWL, we saw 3 of them. The first went to someone who quit playing 3 weeks later. The 2nd went to me (the time between the first and second was about 14 months) and the 3rd dropped off Ebonroc...right after I got mine.
---
I was already 4/9 Cryptstalker...with the gloves...but completing the set was amazing. I happily removed my Cryptstalker pieces and became the expose weakness guy.
---
Never completed my Cryptstalker set, and I never cared. I was just happy to finally get those gloves. The timing was perfect, too, because our guild fell apart a month or two later.
---
Thanks, man!
---
They can be awesome, totally agree. Shedo is a perfectionist is chasing that top dps spot, he's not ur average player. Powershifting perfectly to get the numbers he does is actually really hard. hardcore ferals have the most intense button mashing rotation of any class/spec to do it right.
---
Slightly less viable horde side as dont benefit from wf procs, but ferals benefit from pally buffs.
---
have to farm MCP (from gnomer) heaps if you want the best dps like shedo.
---
Not 100% positive cause it's been so long, but I think so.
---
I don't want to be farming gnomeregan for Pummeler for the whole raid progression. It's just not worth the effort but hey, you do you.
---
Not 100% positive cause it's been so long, but I don't think so.
---
Yes of course I¬¥m totally with you there - still playing Classic to this day^^
---
I still feel like most Retail Players will give it a shot at the beginning just because they pay anyway and - why not?! Right?
---
And a majority of These retail Players will not Keep playing until Level 60. Don¬¥t have to agree - we will see either way.
---
But just that huge amount of Players in the beginning from retail will force them to open many Servers.
---
I mean... Retail has millions of Players - if even half of them try classic it is more than Blizzard expects by far
---
Unless they add in a cash shop it wont be a cash cow. I firmly believe that they make more money with 3-5 million subs and their current cash shop than just 15 mil subs.
---
Unpopular opinion yet true : when your opponents are farming Naxx and or R14, there's no class that will allow you to compete with them without gear.
---
Yesterday someone posted a vanilla video of a lvl 52 rogue killing lvl 60 players. What nobody mentioned is that these lvl 60 had around 3k HP, not enough to survive while stunned. 
---
6 months later these players would have a bare minimum of 5k to 7k HP depending on the class, gear and buffs and then a lvl 52 rogue would just be a minor annoyance to them.
---
Friends...
---
This word... You keep using it.
---
I dont think it means what you think it means.
---
I'm honestly just curious, but I seem to have struck a nerve with a lot of people including you.
---
I had a ton of fun with all those old PTRs with the premades, back when they were locked to certain race and class combos. I didn't have the time or patience to level classes to cap, let alone get them geared, so it was a chance to fuck around. Naxx and ZA PTRs were the most fun.
---
I remember being disappointed because while the Warrior premades had Ashkandi they only had 8/8 Wrath and other tanking oriented pieces. But Rogue and Mage were a blast to screw around on.
---
I also remember joining a raid of Rogues that were going to sneak into Stormwind and cause havoc. On the way there another Rogue asked me what I thought of the changes to the class coming in the patch. I had no experience on Rogue over level 40 or so and didn't even know what the changes were. So I tossed out some bullshit, made up answer and he just agreed with what I said. Probably because he was in the same position as me.
---
I wish there were a way to confirm or deny this.
---
DHK's will only be granted to the person dealing the killing blow to the civilian.
---
Yup. I was about to write this. I raided as an ele shaman throughout most of Naxx. Your mana would hold if you were efficient and went really out of your way for farming. 
---
Get used to spending hours in ashenvale farming for mana consumables, and carry a ridic amount of mana potions.
---
Having that said. 100% would not recommend it. Way too grindy.
---
Yeah, people grossly overestimate how "difficult" content was back then.
---
It was difficult because a lot of people had REALLY bad computers, REALLY bad internet, and were just REALLY bad at MMOs in general. Any guild that really wants to will clear aq40 and naxx this time around, the only roadblock being guilds that somehow don't know you'll need 8 warriors for naxx
---
My man. If you snap me a picture of your Nokia n73 right now... throw in your Paypal account as well.
---
Oh ye, that's why warrior hate windfury and HoJ
---
&gt; You can't increase server limit with this system unless you do some game breaking system like queues for each zones.
---
Thats wrong
---
All good dude, and im agreeing with you :)
---
Druids give 3% crit not 5.
---
Feral dps can work sure if you wanna farm gnomergan for 4 hours before every raid night. 
---
Also shedo's guild is pretty garbage compared to his own skill, it's easy to "top the meters" if you put 2x more effort in than anyone else.
---
I mean... [technically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NLCaolW-I0) it is possible.
---
Sustainable for the average person? Unlikely.
---
Animations. 
---
Personally I find orcs to be the only race where most animations look pleasing to the eye for both genders.
---
You convinced me. Thank you.
---
&gt; specifically going ambush spec 
---
Yeah, i agree. And that's probably why he didn't mention the combat rogue build which is when you get as much HP possible, stack it until you're at about 1.6-1.7k and equipp the monster that is [Shadowfang](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=1482) with crusader together with either cruel barb or assassins blade in offhand also with Crusader
---
Oh my god stawp can‚Äôt wait
---
Connect 12v dynamo to the wheel of the bike, connected to a relay as control power
---
Relay is feeding house power to your conputer.
---
Pc will shut down when dynamo doesnt produce anymore, i guess there should be a timer of some sort that could be used two times an hour or so for bathroom breaks etc
---
In my time it just comes down to class/race combo 
---
Paladin - Human &amp; Blood elf i prefer males (Holy Pallys Female Human - Male Blood elf)
---
Rogue - Female Human &amp; Orc female (Undead look pretty cool as either)
---
Druid - Female Night Elf &amp; Male Tauren
---
\^this
---
Yeah they're very good. The main weaknesses for kitties are that they do not scale with gear very well as the game goes on, and they can't cleave or aoe much. But that's not reason not to play them. And if you're willing to use the rest of the class your damage can be very useful at the start, it just never goes any higher.
---
Most people have an extreme dislike for them because they're not meta and you have to put in alot of work to make it do well. A ton of people don't think about things themselves they just sheepishly follow what youtubers tell them. If you question that you will get attacked. I might get shit for even saying this lol.
---
Yes, you are curious why people don't adhere to your way of playing.
---
Warlock. SL is a flat 30% reduction to damage taken. Fear, coil, insta shield, 40% damage reduction to physical with void+SL, spell lock, seduce, instant dots - their toolkit is insane.
---
Not just my way. That's how we played in vanilla. This private server culture of everyone using Questie is new to me.
---
The Guild fell apart Thing is actually quite sad :/ Atleast I remember when my guild broke apart slowly as People moved on in their lives throughout classic and bc - so many  great memories with them....
---
Good for them that they have moved on and probably have a nice life now!
---
I¬¥m still here getting ganked the shit out of in STV...
---
Cheers that‚Äôs us. 
---
https://www.patreon.com/theraceto60
---
For your list!
---
Is it really varying that much? Like what could change? Obviously trinkets and stuff change, but does other gear really?
---
I booked my vacation from July 15 to July 26. Probably not going to release in that period...
---
yes
---
nope, you can only track one thing at once
---
Warlocks:
---
In PVE benefit from Pallys threat reduction, therefore able to do more damage then horde side. Yes Shaman has also a totem for this, but most likely Shamans might be used otherwise or not all locks benefit from it
---
In PVP it's the other way around, Warlock have an easier time on Horde side as you don't have to face Undead (Will of the Forsaken).
---
Your whole argument is "it doesnt work cuz I said so". I have no idea what to tell you because I have no idea what you perceive as the problem. I know you are wrong, I dont know why you think you are right.
---
PvP ranks won't degrade therefore everyone could earn max rank with enough time and grind without literally sacrificing their family/friends/health/work.
---
I know the Hyppogryph Egg is turned in Tanaris. I said Feralas, because that's where you find the egg hehe. My bad for the confusion.
---
As for the other quest, I looked it up. It's not the Morrowgrain one, but the Perfect Yeti Hide Quest, which is also repeatable. I'm not sure as to wether it gives Darkspear rep though. I've read that it does, but it might be wrong.
---
I would prefer whatever has like best chance of a smooth launch.
---
I am personally going to 5-box (multibox) in Classic. I‚Äôve been practicing on retail for some time now to get used to techniques and such. 
---
A software I HIGHLY RECOMMEND is: ISboxer. It is not free but it is very cheap for what you will be able to do with it (which is pretty much everything). The support for it is awesome too AND it has a discord with very active people to answer any question you have about boxing (especially in WoW). 
---
I also very much recommend to check out MiRai videos on YouTube where he uses ISboxer in WoW and breaks down pretty much everything you need to know to get started and become a pro. (MiRai is also on the discord I mentioned and he has answered my questions within minutes a lot of times. He is a good guy). MiRai also has a couple of videos where he tested ISboxer compatibility with the Classic WoW Demo, where he could confirm that the software will work on Classic WoW (since it is not compatible with e.g. private servers etc...).
---
You noobs are so spooked!
---
That's literal cheating lol. Wan't to be a pro? Who every spell and cast time by heart and go by visual clues only.
---
Yeah I've kind of decided which class.
---
Maybe not, but the Gatorbite Axe from Mara will. But then of course you have to be lucky. 2H Fury is good shit though. I just usually level my characters as arms because it's also good for PvP.
---
Sry, could u please clarify. What u mean under the "do not scale with gear"? The druids don't deal more damage from the stats in the late game?
---
60 Minute Buff for Palas. the 5 Min buffing is really boring
---
They think we don't, but we do.
---
Be sure if i see you drink and you are a cloth class , i will gang you !!
---
If Esfand rolled a Rogue.
---
i disagree worked out great for people like me who wanted to do a bit of both. 
---
I had my 2 buddies to do arena with when i wasn't raiding that day. And i had progress and reason to do both. Not to mention that even in PvP i could mix and match PvE gear to optimize better for arena.
---
I don't want QOL, I want content !
---
Once you got everything there's to get in NAXX, what then ?
---
My worry as a European player is how on retail there‚Äôs certain realms that are predominantly Swedish, Danish, etc speaking. That‚Äôs cool and all, but as someone who only speaks English I really hope I don‚Äôt end up on a server that‚Äôs been unofficially designated as one of these :|
---
mm i can smell my sweet UD female rogue &lt;3
---
Well they still benefit from these stats being increase but not as much as other classes. As a rogue the one thing that is going to increase you damage more than anything else is weapon damage. When you get a better weapon, this increases. 
---
Ferals do not have that weapon damage increase. In fact they don't benefit from weapon damage at all, you may have seen feral druids enchanting +weapon damage on their weapons and trying to get the "of quality" staff but thats bonus weapon damage from other effects that is calculated differently. The actual damage of the weapon they are using has no relation to their damage, which is why it is best to use a mace from gnomer. 
---
You lose little dps from taking off your weapon, but a Rogue or Warrior or Hunter would lose 100% of their damage. This is by design because you don't physically hit things with a weapon in cat or bear form you hit with you paws.

---
Other zones also have mythological references. 
---
Thrym (himself and also Thrym's end, all in Zul'Drak) is norses' mythological ruler of Jotunheim, the world of giants.  The latter also appears as a zone in Icecrown.  
---
Freya (both her avatar in Sholazar and herself as a boss in Ulduar) is one of the Vanir, one of the gods related with fertility and wisdom in that mythology. 
---
The val'kyr are an easy reference to it and appear in DK's unique WPL variant as well as ICC (and well, the remaining ones are in zones you've already mentioned).
---
Nordrassil (and, hell, Teldrassil's origin is the same) takes its name from norse's world tree Yggdrassill. So there's a speck of it in Grizzly hills as well.  
---
And I presume I'm missing some of them.
---
You're doing exactly the same thing and that is my point. 
---
&gt;  If your server limit is 5k instead of 2.5k due to sharding, it massively reduces waiting times 
---
How does sharding of starting zones make server limit higher? Sharding won't work on the whole content, what happens when you go to world content that is not using sharding? There is no known scenario like that in wow and you claim it works exactly like you say because you say so.
---
Currently trying to replace its display (broke it last week) and using Nokia Asha 210 (some keys don't work and it is yellow, got it for free with my contract). When I am at home, I might take one. I will need my Bluetooth to upload the pick from the Asha...I cannot repair it for now (just tried and the new display doesn't start but has the white light behind the panel, so I am not sure what is the problem). I have the n73 from 2007 and the Asha from 2014 and I hope to repair the n73 and using it 10-12 more years because already failed to repair the Asha. 
---
I just hate to replace something if it is working or the repair is cheap and can be done by me. I got a new PC only because my old laptop couldn't run a shit anymore and this is everything that I did on it, also want to try some rendering.
---
That's cheating? It's in retail dude lol
---
Needs to stop all these memes. People are going to start thinking playing right is God mode. Start making memes about how good Balance Druids are or Enhance Shamans
---
I've read that rogues may have a tough time finding a dungeon group. Is it extremely hard, or is it exaggerated a bit? I would understand warriors.  
---
Thank you.
---
If time is an issue, running is probably your best bet. Can do it literally anywhere, just put on running shoes and go for a run whenever you have time. Just shorter runs are pretty decent too, since it's more intensive than walking for example.
---
Ahh, probably I  understand you now. In latest extensions like &gt;= Burning Crusade Druids got the additional attack power from the weapons. But in Classic it doesn't work, am I right?
---
Yeah, there are little hints about who is behind that, but overall Zul'Drak can be hardly called as the zone inspired by Northern Mythology, it's mainly a Trollish zone with Aztech architecture infested by Undead. And Sholazar Basin is about the giant lush jungle, hunting beasts and having a look on two weird humanoid factions living in this zone.
---
&gt; Since we dont know if server transfers are possible
---
That was my reaction too. It was in vanilla and makes them money. Why do we expect that to not be in classic?
---
I literally dont have the time or energy. I'm still recovering from several fractured vertebrae, and I work 10-12 hours a day. If I dont lay down/sleep the last 12 hours of the day I risk injury. I mean, I'm already risking an injury with what I'm doing now, but there's nothing I can do about that.
---
There were T2 drops in MC beside the legs?
---
It works like that when you use context. Many people wont leave the starting zones at all before quiting. And those who do will at greatly varrying paces.
---
Yeah
---
There‚Äôs a Kul‚ÄôTiran human female joke in there somewhere...
---
Be prepared to hear "we already have a rogue" 50% of the time.
---
That doesn't make it not cheating. Retail holds hands way too much and it's a different game.
---
Will be sure to add you on Discord this evening.
---
Sounds a great fit, and I‚Äôve been playing the same restoration shaman since release, having heard in every raid tier.
---
Most TVs will look much better than your average 144hz monitor.
---
If you get a decent IPS PC monitor though, you'll see the difference.
---
Happy to help man, good luck with it!

I remember running Zul Farrak on my first character, a dwarf hunter. Our group consister of a druid tank, priest healer, a mage and a warlock. 
---
When Antu‚ÄôSul dropped Sang‚Äôthraze the deflector, i was the only one that could use it and so looted it despite already having a polearm with better stats.
---
Fast forward to the final boss (Chief Ukzor?) when he drops Jang‚Äôthraze the protector l. My group fell to the floor laughing as a warrior or rogue could make better use of the weapon, but surprise surprise, the hunter looted it.
---
I was quite awestruck when combining the two blades to create Sul‚Äôthraze the Lasher, my first epic item in the game. 
---
The following weeks i kept getting harrased by so many people (salty warriors/rogues), i ended up putting the sword in my bank and never using it again until transmog became a thing. Good times.
---
I'll be playing a Warlock this time around. Always wanted to play a Warlock on blizzard official realms, but I didn't care for them after Wotlk. I'm ready to experience being a master summoner and bringer of fear.
---
&gt;Starting on a server and find out after a few weeks of playing on it that the population on my server is not balanced between Horde/Alliance or even worse really low.
---
That's extremely unlikely to happen. It's only a thing on retail because the game has been going for so long and people have been able to transfer on and off realms. 
---
After a few months servers could end up being unbalanced, but your own faction won't leave just like that, so it will still be playable, only somewhat disadvantageous in world PvP. If one faction is bigger than another it will be because there are a ton of people on that faction, not because the other faction is lacking people. 
---
This is all assuming there will be no server transfers. If server transfers are available, then yeah, you can end up on a "dead" faction, but in that case you could just transfer off like everyone else. 
---
How much they reveal about realms before launch also matters, if people have a lot of time and details to plan where they are going it's possible certain factions will congregate on specific servers, but I still think that is unlikely. If they don't release server lists before launch, people will still go with their group of people, or follow streamers/guilds, but these groups will still be spread out randomly across servers.

Morning release so the authentication servers can crash during the day and are fixed by the time I get back from work.

OFC. playing on pvp realms does not even mean you want to play a lot of pvp. I personally, while i hope to change that in classic, have not played a lot of pvp during any of the expansions and usually stick with pve. However, i would never ever play on pve realm.
---
Tried it once, more like i was forced into it, when i came back to the game after our server ahn'qiraj has been dead for a while, so i transferred to the realm all my friends had transferred to "draenor" which was a pve realm. I hated every second of it. I hate running into opposite faction while questing and not being able to attack them or be attacked. It takes away the feeling of danger, anguish and unpredictability during your adventure.
---
If it were up to me, i would not even allow people who play on pve realms to do so before trying pvp realms :P jk , to each his own. But i do actually feel like a lot of people would enjoy pvp realms more if they gave it a shot. and remember this is coming from someone that barely does any pvp.
---
Just checked, Hands, feet, waist, writs dropt prior to patch 1.5. Was not aware of this
---
1. It can be both. A lot of vanilla is about preparation. Execution is also important later on, but most early raids are fairly simple as most guilds are getting the hang of wrangling 40 people into a somewhat cohesive fighting force. Just like in the game proper, the further you go the more complex things get.
---
However a lot of that ultimately comes down to preparations. Consumables and specialized gear for specialized fights is fairly important and can make the difference between endless wipes or a fairly trivial fight.
---
2. You need to train with weapons to use them effectively yes, though it's on a category bases for each type of weapon. Also you don't start with all weapon types available to use. At level 10+ (except Polearms which requires 20) you can visit specific capitals that focus on those weapons and buy training if your class can use it but didn't start with training (what weapons you start with is race based. Such as trolls are the only warrior to start with a ranged weapon skill (Throwing), where as all the other warriors need to get to 10 before they can get a ranged skill to pull with). This skill begins at 1 and raises by doing. Unlike very early wow you can gain skill from grey enemies but the skill speed is drastically reduced vs green+ enemies. However just because you could learn a ton of weapons doesn't nessecary mean you should. Warriors generally won't use more than 4-5 types of weapons meaningfully over the course of their career unless you just want to be exotic and use some odd less optimal stuff.
---
3. You CAN queue for dungeons. Either by clicking on a meeting stone or talking to an Inn-keeper and requesting them to queue you up (I don't remember if you needed to have clicked on the meeting stone at least once to use the Inn-keeper queue system or if you just needed the correct level range). 
---
This system however for most of WoW was complete shit and while Blizzard did make several attempts at improving it, by then it was simply accepted to spam trade for groups so barely anyone even used it, which in turn made it worthless. (It might work better this time due to people being more used to Dungeon Queue systems).
---
However it is merely a group creator. You still have to walk to the dungeon as normal. Unless your group has a lock that is willing to summon you. (Don't expect to get summons. Just be thankful if they do offer them. Locks can get very prickly over that sort of stuff especially if everyone is heading out the same time and someone stays behind to dick around in trade or something and expects a summmon. If the group is there already and just needing to fill a spot or two, you'll probably get a summon without much fuss).
---
4. Quite a bit yes. There are some surface similarities here and there. But in general it's a very different game, since it came out during the era of the Quartet (Tank/Heal/DPS/Support) rather than the Trinity (Tank/Heal/DPS) which WoW eventually morphed into during Wrath. 
---
Also specs are MUCH less role defining than in current WoW. Your roles are defined by your class and the gears sets you've got available that support it, and you can do those regardless of spec, being the appropriate spec just makes you better at doing that job than someone of your class with a different spec.
---
Though do in mind, that in Small Group content (Dungeons, small raids), you can do pretty much what you want. They're flexible enough that even Hybrids can perform specialist roles, though it might require a lot more effort to do and will definitely require different strategies built on the innate strengths and weaknesses.
---
But in Large Group content, it's generally weighted towards specialists doing their jobs and hybrids filling whatever gaps the raid needs for the current encounter.
---
It's not really a Classic summer if they release as late as september.
---
&gt;Private servers did it with 10k even more. People played, worked fine, sometimes to many people ofc.
---
Pservers messed with spawns and stuff to make it work. You had pretty much instant respawns of quest items and mobs while levelling, for example. And the respawn timers for herbs and stuff was much lower than in vanilla.
---
Vegetable beef stew then?  Green beans, celery, carrots, potatoes.
---
Always a winner for me.
---
You have to make a name for yourself in the leveling process so your name is remembered, for any dungeon group or raid there is an extremely high chance that they would have their rogues and hunters.
---
You need to out prepare the other rogues to make sure you get on the group.

I play against/with Cadet a lot and use 5/8 T2 and 3/6 PvP gear. The 5/8 T2 is for the 3 piece set bonus which gives you 15% continued mana regen while casting. I then get the 3 piece bonus from PvP gear for stamina. I still find spirit extremely valuable for PvP. In the beginning I used only intellect and high stamina gear, and the healing was great but I was drinking every 2 minutes. I am much more able to utilize offensive utility like constant dispelling without needing to stop to drink every fight. I also utilize the holy talent that gives 25% bonus spell damage and healing based on spirit, so that's obviously a big factor.
---
So youre the one who told parsley and sage that they couldnt be a part of the band anymore...
---
I have the opposite fear. I take a week off on launch, but there are so many people I can't kill any of the quest mobs I need or grind effectively, and I don't make 20 my whole time off.
---
Dwarf priest.  Just like the day I started WoW, before everyone started rolling that sh*t for minmax reasons.
---
Always movemnt speed, its by FAR the best talent for levelup on any class.
---
Debuff slots say otherwise.
---
Then you probably don't "need to work on cardio more than anything else". 
---
Get your life together first instead, if you can't do 30-40 minutes a day of exercise.
---
Can't go wrong with a stew!
---
Holy hell I never considered this.  Amazing idea
---
JUST A GAME ?!?
---
The Freezing Band is the BIS ring for PvP Frost mages, because the Equip-effect works with their Shatter talent. I've found one of these before and sold it for 1500g. This was before I was level 60, so when I dinged I could instantly go and grab my epic mount and riding skill, along with a fresh set of Devilsaur (I was playing rogue).
---
I don't expect to have this ammount of luck on Classic though.
---
Listen, dick. I have to do 60 hours of community service to get out of a charge for a crime I didnt commit. You dont know what's going on in my life, so dont assume it's my fault that I cant scrape together 40 minutes to do some cardio. I also broke my back last year, and because of this stupid opioid crisis, no doctor will prescribe me with pain medication despite actually being in real pain.
---
Are you on a PVP realm? then the human racial is pretty op
---
Just so you know, but holding left mouse button and right mouse button at the same time is the same as holding the forward button (W). This frees up your hand to press the spellbuttons.
---
&gt;Good to know, that Hit is more of a Endgame thing.
---
Hit is amazing. Your weapon skill is 5-10 behind your level the whole time until L60. As you are duo leveling, i think you wont be grinding lower level mobs... so that extra hit could be useful against all mobs you encounter. And since most of the pally talents doesnt exactly make you super effective in anything, its better than most options.
---
Have added you on Discord!
---
Looks a nice plan. I am a Resto Shaman playing the same character since release, having healed all raid content.
---
Although it is a great looking weapon, the chance on hit is wasted on hunters. You would've been much better off with a decent stat stick, adding to the insult of warrior and rogues. But cool story nontheless.
---
AH, finally:
---
So, i think i nailed it down to Hunter, Warrior, Rogue or Druid.
---
Id love to play  a class where i can get shit done even if im alone. Not only Soloing this or that but also doing dunegons "alone" as in with no premates. Hunter is great for Soloing and pvping but arent hunter like 50 % of the pop, the other half being rogue. 
---
Leaves me with druid or Warrior. Warrior cant solo as easy as say hunter or druid. But ill find a dungeon groups  really quick and in wpvp theyre also the punching ball if the opponent knows how to press \[generic slow\].
---
Druid is good for soloing stuff(not as great as hunter ofc),i can stealth around like a rogue and pick my fights as i want to. Even tho i dont have the burst of a rogue. I heard Bears are decent dungeon tanks so thats the Warrior part.  
---
And with a druid i can even heal dunegon if i want to and if i have the gear #hotwspecc.
---
after writing this i realized i dont want to play without stealth so i guess the question is rogue or druid ?   
---
Im fine with not being the first in dps or healing but i dont want to get shit on in wpvp. 
---
If a rogue is caught offguard, what are the chances that he wins the fight(1v1) compared to a druid.
---
Maybe add region?
---
Since we are going to play with 1.12 talents and raids in the catch-up state. It would be nice if they retuned the early raids to make it more in tune with how they were when they got released.
---
Marriage is a terrible trap.
---
Peacemaker, the polearm. Got it on my hunter, which was named Peacemaker. I did not know of this item before I got it.
---
Are we talking about progression or farm status bosses? I'll assume farm status since progression only lasts a few weeks.
---
Warriors, druids are optimal tanks.
---
Paladins, shamans are viable tanks. (with the exception of maybe 2-3 bosses that are hard/impossible, depending on server coding)
---
Warlocks, Priests, Hunters, rogues are semi-viable tanks (flat out stop around either start of AQ or midway.)
---
Mages are in a bottom tier of their own (poor mages...)
---
Everything listed above is assumable if you have a good guild and take the game seriously. It's a great way to experience the game from a new and refreshing perspective that differs from the mundane norm and puts a new spin on a decade year old game.
---
I would start in ret and get SoC and movespeed. From there you can go into whichever tree you would like, paladins are going to be relatively slow either way. And even in full ret you should be able to be okay at healing/tanking leveling dungeons as long as you switch out a couple pieces of gear (keep a set of decent 1handers/shields in your bank just in case :) ).
---
My tentative plan was to grab SoC / movespeed, and then go over to prot to grab hit/kings and maybe Imp RF so I can more easily tank a couple leveling dungeons. Then at level 41 respec into an AoE build, grab consecrate and BoSanc -&gt; Holy shield.
---
Your basic single target rotation is going to be seal of the crusader -&gt; insta judge, then seal of command, and then smack things with a slow 2-hander. If you've got mana to spare, you can judge command and reapply it.
---
Unless you go into holy and get SF (and until you get there if you do), use HoJ/DP/BoP to heal when you need it, and then keep smacking.
---
&gt; Listen, dick.
---
Calm down, I'm just trying to give you advice. 
---
&gt;so dont assume it's my fault that I cant scrape together 40 minutes to do some cardio. 
---
Never said it was your fault. I'm just saying if you can't do it you have more important things to worry about than exercising. So don't worry about your resting heart rate or whatever, you have time to get in good shape later. 
---
&gt;I also broke my back last year, and because of this stupid opioid crisis, no doctor will prescribe me with pain medication despite actually being in real pain.
---
Then rehab training is probably something you should look into before just doing normal cardio if that's the case.
---
It's 15.
---
Lower respec costs.
---
It's very good melee classes as well. Too bad it doesn't proc off spells against you.
---
Text on a TV is awful.
---
Stuck between Tauren, Undead or Orc Warrior. I like Tauren as big guys, and I like their lore and zones a lot. Decent combat animations. Not so sure about how their size affects armour pieces though, no feet and helm pretty much. 
---
I like undead due to their great combat animations and I like how they get more freedom to show armour. Not sure on their fluff very much, and on how relatively popular they are. 
---
Orcs seem boring but safe. Probably have the strongest racials, decent animations and armour fits them quite well. I just dont find them very exciting.
---
For stealth talking to people, or? :p
---
After release there is no day and night. Only classic with small 2 hour nap breaks.
---
I hope we will not see you in Classic. You truly are a pay2win person.
---
Those are the best drops.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHOoGKktie8

No of course not :p. But then I would choose Drake Talon Cleaver over Ashkandi. Or severance later on, but by that time fury PvP is going to be just as fun if not more fun.

It looks like some of those resources aren't found anywhere else, which is cool. I wonder if it is possible to reach Mining 305 without having a Goblin Mining Helmet. I'm pretty torn on what Engineering spec to choose.

Oh interesting, thanks for the advice!

Regardless of how people feel about this particular playstyle, the fact that we can still have hardcore theorycrafting on a 15 year old game is a testament to its depth.

Nice work OP.  Thinking outside the box

Play whatever race you want. It shouldn't matter unless you are in some super hardcore guild.

Dwarven handcannon - first ever epic drop.
---
Was on my dwarven hunter in Hinterlands just going about my business of culling the local wolf population and it dropped. I was so speechless and excited I ran into the next room and yelled at my brother to shut up and follow me.
---
Equipped that bad boy without a thought if it was actually any better than what I had currently.
---
Ye i didnt need gold for a long while either after that sale. 
---
I honestly love finding BoE stuff cuz its always exciting to see what you can get for it.
---
The problem here is adding those changes without affecting PvP scene. A lot of those troll pve specs are at least good if not optimal for PvP.
---
I rather not have it. I want to see wich particular mob dropped what. Also looting for more than 2 seconds feels rewarding.
---
I know but I'm undecided lol.
---
This was all a hypothetical I'm not actually advocating for them to do this.
---
This is misinformation, which has been spread by TipsOut. The formulas for adding +heal to regrowth have been known since vanilla and all blizzlike servers use them.
---
No, it will be added in phase 2. Kazzak has nothing to do with it, since you can get the other part of other mobs (and almost ALWAYS you do get it from other mobs than kazzak). 
---
The chest wasnt in MC at start, it will be added in phase 2. Chest was added in patch 1.4, same as the honor changes that have been already confirmed to be in phase 2. See,  [https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Patch\_1.4.0](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.4.0)

---
That was a measure Blizzard took to try to fix that problem. [They're are some weapons like that in vanilla](https://classicdb.ch/?item=20580) but they aren't really worth using compared to the Gnomer mace doubling your attack speed. Just some more attack power doesn't fix the problem, your weapons are still just stack sticks. 
---
[I found some old threads talking about it](https://ptr.wowhead.com/forums&amp;topic=142010) so you know I'm not just making shit up. Apparently in Wrath Blizzard automatically converted Weapon Damage to FAP(Feral Attack Power) and fixed it.
---
Unless an opportunity for a really fun scene comes up or something I really don't feel like I have to be IC when leveling or farming.
---
Yeah definitely would take too long otherwise
---
To add to this: For me personally at least I really like that 3% hit. I know it may not actually be doing all that much to increase the speed with which I kill things, but the worst feeling is getting several miss/dodge/parries in a row with a 3.8s 2-hander. I don't think 3% less miss chance actually makes it happen that much less often, but I just feel so much better with it than without it.
---
Like, the talent could be broken and literally do nothing except waste three points and I think I would still take it to make my mind at ease...
---
Are you more of a PvE or a PvP guy?
---
It's not one rare item, but rather a one-run plunder of MC loot.
---
Late 2005, I had been raiding MC as a priest and leveling a warlock on the side. My guild at the time had a serious shortage of Warlocks, so when i reached 50-ish, they requested me to re-roll Warlock as my main. They boosted me trough all my attunements and a few day's after hitting 60, I ran my first Molten Core. I walked out of MC with:
---
\[Felheart Gloves\]
---
\[Felheart Shoulders Pads\]
---
\[Felheart Horns\]
---
\[Felheart Robes\]
---
\[Nemesis Leggings\]
---
I was hoping to get one-two pieces, but five pieces was beyond my wildest dreams!
---
I have and im litterally so scared that im gonna work on release day and not get my name reserved. 
---
It's silly but im so ready to be back.
---
Oh pls no sharding for classic.it is a big mistake.
---
I don't think Hunters are going to be as popular as rogues, mages and warriors. 
---
Rogues are worse when caught offguard, at that point it basically depends how many cooldowns you have available and which of those are useful against the class that caught you. Druids basically always can reset a fight by running away, which makes them great if you want to stay on the safer side of things. Druids are definitely much easier to get into an instance group with, too. Sounds like you like the variety, too. I'd suggest rolling Druid.

Not in the slightest. I did some tumbling ideas in my head for now. Since we don't have a date, I'll not plan anything concrete.
---
He hasn't even played it himself in 13 years (see other comments), this is pure napkin math.
---
No reason to crown him just because he made a theoretical claim. If he can prove with video/log evidence that everyone who has continued to actually play vanilla for all these years is wrong, *then* he gets to be a min/max god.
---
I remember getting the Blade of Eternal Darkness on my mage. My first character I got to 60. Not exceptionally good for a frost mage, but no doubt  I had to use it atleast for a few levels. Like so many others just the sheer feeling of a real epic. Also no warlicks or priests got salty over it. I reckon I was the only caster. Few things will beat that feeling.
---
I played a Human warrior, an Undead warrior and an Orc warrior. In vanilla, I was amazed that the armor looked a lot better on Orcs - and especially shoulders. And they have a really great Mortal Strike animation.
---
More zeppelin routes. I think the OG/TB route was added in WotLK.

I'd love this, but they'd have to make the gain needed for rank a bit higher.

Oh yeah, didnt see that one. Thanks :)

You‚Äôll 100% find a guild on whichever realm you play on as that duo. Especially if you guys are dedicated when it comes to raiding, gearing, farming BiS, etc. your tanking buddy will be fed gear and you‚Äôll heal him from day 1 to Naxx
---
I mostly just hope we get a list beforehand and can note what streamers will be on which servers so we can more clearly pick and choose if we want to be on a server dominated by a streamer and its ilk.
---
TIL guild banks weren't in vanilla.
---
last pserver i played we had a cohort of troll supremacists in our guild haha, they were all funny people
---
Movable UI elements and a built in swing timer. I know you can just get addons for these but it would really help alot of new players min max their auto attacks, wand shots, or bow shots. And moving frames to help keep your eyes on your character to make sure you're not standing in fire.
---
I think it's crazy how the base UI in BFA still doesn't have a swing timer.
---
It is a bit exaggerated. But bear in mind - being a DPS warrior will land you in the same spot. I might be wrong, but from experience, fury warriors and rogues get about the same amount of invites to parties. Solve this by being in a guild and have friends you run with. 
---
On the other hand, if you are able to tank - then group finding will be a breeze.
---
boo
---
This x1000
---
I need to remember this and not be so worried
---
I have heard on multiples website and some comments here than Reckoning only works in private server, the 100% crit chance when you /sit and give you an extra attack will not work on official classic, so better stick to ret OR switch to prot/ret if you want to tank dungeon OR heal/ret if you want to heal dungeon, i am not sure  which is best.  
---
Currently lvl 19 and i took full ret talents
---
Heh...
---
Not in terms of seasons, but in terms of how it works in business it still will be.
---
Not if you have smallish hands, shift-combinations are a lot harder. And ctrl is even worse.
---
You do the same by just turning the camera.
---
From a purely min-max standpoint, just to be clear, he has all possible buffs you can get as feral, the crowd pummeler, and he needed all of that to do the 4th/9th most damage...in BWL. My guild stopped using consumables for BWL after the 4th or 5th clear...they needed to be saved for progression.
---
That's why feral is a pretty bad spec. That's why 'hardcore' raids will only ever bring 1, if they bring 1 at all. You will have to work 4 times as hard for consumables to get mediocre damage, and the higher tier raid, the worse they scale with everyone else. They have to pop consumables in 'ez' raids like BWL to even come close to competing. Farming 500-800 gold for consumables so you can clear BWL is madness. It's bad enough to do for Naxx, if you have to do that for farm raids...ugh.
---
All that said, I'd certainly bring a feral druid. We did back in the day. He went balls deep on consumables for Naxx and pulled enough damage to make him worth it (usually hovered with or slightly below the hunters) and he gave some crit to melee. But we didn't have him pop those consumables for BWL/AQ, because it was too expensive. When that happened, where did he fall? Behind every dps, except for our shadow priest.
---
From a pure numbers stand point, every raid needs 1 druid. Imo, that druid should either be bear or resto. Every other druid after that is a waste (in an optimal climate.) Why bring an extra druid for innervate when you just bring another priest or paladin? Why bring an extra cat4fite when you just bring a rogue or warrior? Why bring another bear when you can bring a warrior?
---
Druids can be alright. You just have to have an obscene amount of consumables...for alright.

The fact that I even remember this being an epic mace is incredible to me. I was around 10-11 years old during vanilla, and these epic items basically held legendary status to me, since I still remember them to this day

no body who values their time grinds for bis. go into mc at 58 who cares.
---
Me troll me no need to eat.
---
Yeah not sure what the logic really was, certainly would have skewed the time for BWL firsts for those guilds who got a few good MC runs in before the removal. Will be interesting to see if it has much effect. I didn't really get into raiding before BWL dropped anyway so it didn't affect me at all.

If they use what they did for BfA it'll be global and 11pm UK / midnight EU / whatever that is for the rest of the world.
---
Hehe that might be true. sounds nice actually, but we want to find a guild that works for us, not just any random guild who wants a tank or healer
---
(contrary to popular belief it's actually pretty easy to get in a group inside of the crypt killing red oozes)
---
I feel the same way.
---
This is my problem too.  Feeling really drawn to playing a Druid in Classic as my main.  I may try to convince my guild to let me go Feral DPS for like one raid just for fun, but there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm farming MCP‚Äôs and all other consumables every single week to stay relevant... any idea how many you actually need to farm per raid?  I‚Äôm thinking 1 or maybe 2 per boss depending on how far you are into progression / how long boss fights are lasting?  If anybody is regularly burning them on trash packs then they‚Äôre more of a man than I‚Äôll ever be.
---
have little issue with it, but a fair point.
---
in the end it all comes down to preference.
---
I don't remember the name, but I remember when it happened. I was doing some questing in the The Thousand Needles when a world Blue dropped for me, it was worth at least a few hundred Gold as I recall and it sold almost immediately. I was pretty depressed at the time, with my relationship ending and my grandfather on his deathbed, and I remember this little piece of blue-text really lifted my spirits. I even recall falling asleep all giddy that night, thinking of what I would do with all the gold.

Many tourists should drop out by then I would think, so we'll have a better picture of faction balance and overall population
---
That is one change I wouldn't mind. Up the charges on the Pummler to 15 or 30.
---
You‚Äôd be surprised how it works. Initially they need a healer, you join, level the rest of the way with them, have way too many consecutive drunk fridays, you clear the content and suddenly you‚Äôre all best friends 
---
On a serious note though, if you feel pressured at all, just know you‚Äôll find a good spot regardless.
---
I prefer initial sharding over ghost servers
---
Warlock PVP revolves around control.  Unless you have a succubus out, you are terrible in pvp.
---
When he opens on you, you can seduce him with your succubus.
---
0%.
---
If they‚Äôre going to release future expansions, it‚Äôll be as the proper expansion.
---
Nice, the early days of raiding was tough because not only could raid nights end in only a few bosses down but also mean drops were not your class needs and that meant upgrades were sometimes far apart.
---
When you get banned for buying or selling gold, don't come here and ask for help.
---
They know how to trace such things, you mean they wont notice a spike in a characters gold? I pretty sure there is something like that in place.
---
Maybe you will fool them once or twice, but the chance to get caught now will be much much greater than what it was 15 years ago.
---
Stfu lol
---
Save your gold for warden staff üëç
---
Baked sweet potatoes covered in beans/chili is a go to for me. If you really want a ‚Äúchicken and broccoli‚Äù dinner, Avant Garde Vegan has a good chicken dinner recipe (made of seitan).
---
Kind of want to play an Arms Warrior, but I know I would have to go Fury for raids because of the debuff limit, so i'm on the fence. Don't want to play a Rogue or ranged DPS. 
---
Alternative would be a healer, I have 0 experience with Shaman or Paladin, but it would be fun learn them.
---
Which class would you recommend to someone who started playing in WoD?
---
Endless entangel rank 1 spam from the druid
---
Just w8 for ppl to poly kill ppl in the water as mage
---
The companion from the Whelps in the Badlands. I sold that little shit for 2,000 gold and was literally so fucking thrilled.
---
I would be totally okay with that.
---
Worth it lol
---
So here i go
---
Iam stuck between warrior (tank) , Druid , (heal or if accepted tank) or shaman (heal) .
---
Im an all out group player.. i still enjoy some solo farming but my main focus is  totally on 5 mans and raids... it always was, i played vanilla back in the day (Druid) and really enjoyed it wich brings me back to the idea of playing druid. After vanilla i switched classes to paladin and warrior tank.. and i tanked nearly for the rest of my wow career ( I quit my "fulltime" wow carrer with MoP but i played every expansion casually on/off .)
---
My main "problem" is that iam a shiftworker .. i work nightshifts since 1 year now and that means that the only time i can play is in the early day around 8-14 (EU time) morning till noon and go to bet then so when not that many players are online to group with and difficult time to find a raiding guild or random raid.
---
To have the highest chance to get 5 mans at this time of the day its obvious that playing a tank is the best thing also its the role i have the mosp xp with (Played a tank on Nostalrius as well). But i have the feeling that there will be an influx of tanks this time around wich will make it difficult to find a raiding spot as tank at a daytime where already few raids will be available.. also after playing tank for alle the years things get a little bit stall... 
---
This brings me to the healing roles in form of druid or shaman.. i really like both for their buffs and utilities and it would be something refreshing after all this years of playing tank... but than a voice in my back head says... "wait what if you are totally wrong and exactly because you are only playing in the early hours of the day there wont be no friggin tank around to build a group with if you dont play one yourself and you keep spamming the lfg channel for all eternity"... 
---
Yeah thats my status right now... i hope to find a active pve focussed "early active" guild in EU area... i thought about compensating the daytime problem by maybe playing on US East servers but i still have lots of friends who also return for classic and that would totally cancel out the possibility to play together on weekends... Help :D
---
I need that table. Where?
---
Play WoW outside and shut up normie. We want it now!
---
Are you saying that Battle for Azeroth is my wife, or my mother?
---
As a hunter and leather worker I was able to (and did) craft the entire black dragonscale set. I remember it being very difficult to get all the patterns at the time, but I don‚Äôt remember exactly how rare it was...
---
Druids can tank...
---
Build a roof and some walls around the laptop!
---
I'm in the same boat. I don't mind how any of them look. Which is best for pve and which is best for PvP both horde and ally?
---
&gt;Without a 12 button MMO mouse you will find yourself using control + numbers and alt+ numbers for additional bindings.
---
Nah. 
---
Here are my keybinds (non-american layout, some are weird):
---
¬ß 1 2 3 4 5 q e r t f g &lt; z x mb4 F1 F2 F3 F4
---
plus shift modifiers for most of them. That's 36 buttons, or exactly three bars. That's good enough, and all are very easy to reach even with my relatively small hands. And if you for some reason want extra keybinds you can add in some ctrl modifiers, usually I use ctrl for focus cast and stuff like that. 
---
When I've tried an MMO mouse I had a hard time timing my casts well and stuff, and also had a harder time moving the mouse at the same time as casting, I'm guessing that comes with practice. But the buttons on my keyboard are so much nicer than any buttons on an MMO mouse, so I much prefer to use them for any ability I use a lot, it's a silly word but they feel a lot more "responsive".
---
People are telling you their reasons and you deflect all of it. Like here, someone said he/she likes to go fast during lvling. Your answer was "It's not a race". What kind of argument is this? People experience wow however they want to. There're more ways than your way but in an argument, you completely dismiss the existence of that. That is very annoying behavior that might strike a nerve during discussion.
---
In dungeons only attack targets that the tank has established aggro on. Aggro isn't just something magically awarded to tanks.  They literally.have to use a few abilities and refresh.those abilities on every target.  So focus dps on targets that have enough threat from the tank.
---
So under ;)
---
Well my friend you are definitely invited :)
---
My friend and I cannot wait for WoW classic. We have played multiple MMOs together and WoW is all we want.
---
Join us.
---
I've overheard somewhere that there are going to be 4 servers on the beta, as opposed to 2 servers that usually appear on retail expansions beta.
---
Hunter or Warlock?
---
I think Warlock would generally be more valued, and carry more utility and a probably better at PvP and PvE - but I'm still slightly leaning towards Hunter. But then again you have to stand still to shoot. Decisions
---
[BEKFAST](https://youtu.be/PJVP0RTRlWE?t=3)
---
Stop trying to be nice and help, dick! They fucked up their own life, let em live it
---
i agree to an extent, but those small abilities were an identity that SKILLED players could use. a good mage used rank 1 detect magic Vs a warlock with auto devour.
---
a good rogue weapon saps and changes poisons depending on the fight
---
a good hunter kneels to fake putting a trap down.
---
I argue that those "minor abilities" gave flavor and added to the skill cap. The modern game has a skill floor so low &amp; a skill ceiling so low that a 10 percentile player can hang with a 90 percentile player
---
Theres going to be warrior tanks, and then theres going to be a hundred thousand warriors who want to dps.  The 'dps warriors' are all dime a dozen and won't stand out to anyone anywhere, unless they are also capable of tanking.  Then they will be known as the dps warrior who knows how to tank.
---
People will walk circles around you in pvp unless you have support or better gear, and even then you are only good against half the classes.
---
The best solo, casual classes are Hunter and Druid.
---
Baron Rivendares Death Charger, I got it on my pally alt maybe three weeks before tbc dropped, I had just started playing on my alliance characters seriously in preparation for the expansion.
---
People in my party were good natured about it but they did give me a hard time ‚Äúyou‚Äôve only been here like a month!‚Äù
---
Edgemaster's Handguards(https://classicdb.ch/?item=14551) from one of those bandits in tanaris. I was in shock as I saw something epic dropped.
---
It was my first and last random epic drop in classic. Sadly no one wanted to buy it and I guess it is still in the bank on one of my toons.
---
But that feeling of getting something epic that is really rare is what I miss these days.
---
CSGO: Rush B cyka blyat don't stop.
---
WoW: Rush Level 60 cyka blyat don't stop.
---
any sub 6 diggit bill means it was just a minor scratch
---
Warlock has great utility and there will be less of them. If you value PvP Alliance can sometimes struggle against stuns so Horde is the clear winner there.
---
A group can always value a good warlock though.
---
&gt; I'd say hitting alt + right thumb button is a lot less awkward and time consuming than taking your hand off of WSAD to press a key and then having to move it back.
---
Even if you play with only keyboard keybinds you never have to take your hand of wasd, there are enough keys around there that you won't run out.
---
Warlock uses shards. Like a LOT of shards.
---
You lost your last shred when you planned the food you were ordering months in advance bro, just pathetic. I love it.
---
*yoink*
---
As ready as a prepped-to-the teeth, soon-to-be father who brought everything to the hospital, except the pregnant wife.
---
Mage + Paladin beats Warrior+ Paladin in vanilla from my experience.
---
You know those other warriors popped consumes too right?
---
They already said Never to AoE looting, and even Auto-auto Loot isn't garunteed to stay in as it was a TBC addition.
---
However auto-auto-loot is a much different can of worms from AoE loot.
---
Auto-auto-loot just saves you from learning to tap shift with your pinky as you loot, which after about 45 minutes becomes so natural you forget you're doing it until you jump on a server that does have auto-auto-loot and suddenly you're manual looting everything till you realize you're hitting the shift key still.
---
That's why most people don't really care much about Auto-auto loot. it's not really changing anything.
---
But AoE loot is a MASSIVE change. So massive it didn't exist for 10 years of wow's history. And has zero place in classic.
---
HERE WE GO!
---
If you hate dwarfs, don't force your self into playing one for fear ward. like man, it's not neccecery.
---
That sounds sad :( for me as a feral player. But anyway, thanks for the explanation
---
A little magic dust to keep you going. I rather keep that for the weekends. If I will use that for wow aswell im broke within a month.
---
u/DarkPhenomenon made a neat spreadsheet of all the guilds recruiting he could find, updated weekly : [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e7nMh8IaH5mNZ7MOx2it8MF7ULYdCIT0VqO6ubaUDq4/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e7nMh8IaH5mNZ7MOx2it8MF7ULYdCIT0VqO6ubaUDq4/edit?usp=sharing)
---
I understand if you want to get to endgame as quickly as possible, but otherwise I don't know why you would want to go through the majority of the content as fast as possible.
---
Orc/human are the best for PvE with blood fury, axe specialization and sword specialization respectively.
---
For PvP I'd say Undead for wotf and Orc for the 25% stun resist. For Alliance maybe Gnome for escape artist.
---
Oh you guys were talking about that cave, I thought there was some secret way to bypass the furbolg tunnel to WS from felwood.
---
Gun sound.
---
Really, when you think about it, with climate change, summer now starts in May. So it could come sooner that you think.
---
Corpsemaker for my orc warrior
---
&gt;in the end it all comes down to preference.
---
In this case, definitely. But there have been arguments like this between clickers and people who use keybinds as well. It's not always just preference.
---
The notion that people think that blizzard will take the time or will be able to ban or take action against all or even a small portion of gold sellers is verry unrealistic to me...
---
In my opinion there are verry few ways of controling it of which runescape is a good example simply becouse of their history. Runescape was forced due to a lost legal case to stop 100% of gold trading. Which led to the only selution that would stop it the stop of free trade anny way of transfering an amount of gold to another account. This forced action came fairly close to destroying the game.
---
If even to this day with the modern software there are gold sellers for modern wow. It shows that the detection software they have is bad becouse these gold farmers can make more money from the game then paying for a subscription fee... I feel like the only way to deter it from happening is to realise that it will happen and thus advocate for something that can kill that market by making it unprofitable in some way shape or form. The obvious awnser is that the banning of gold buyers and sellers needs to be better but it is simply isn't good enough as of right now. 
---
I just don't see people bringing this up to blizzard and in the community it seems to get ignored.
---
Warriors are by far the class I've played most in WoW. I will probably roll an alt warrior again.
---
In raids you will probably be fury, but it will be pretty easy to get a 2h wep, so you can go arms in PVP.  I know the big crits look good on youtube. But the truth is that you often waited 3,5 sec, for an attack hitting really low, and then waited 3,5 sec again for next swing if you didn't had any rage. That was boring as hell in PVE anyways.
---
Now that is still the one that "got away" for me. Did so many runs for it but never saw it drop.
---
no it wasn't. Auto-auto loot is a 2.0 feature.
---
the ONLY auto-loot in Classic was hold "Button" + Right Click.
---
fair point, i guess only for the really hardcore guilds that kill lucifron in 15 sec and the like it can sometimes last multiple bosses
---
Careful friend. [Your post might get removed](https://imgur.com/Gx8mPwy) like [mine was.](https://i.redd.it/vdtg0itrd2u21.png)
---
Glowing Brightwood Staff dropped in,  I think BRD or LBRS. The rules on our server was greed to sell, need to use. As I was still running Illusionary rod, I rolled Need even if I knew it was worth hundreds of gold. 
---
Yes, I equipped it.
---
I think you are going to be negatively surprised.
---
Horde warlock, be it undead or orc is way superior to alliance in pvp. Since 70% of the horde is undead, don't bother binding fear in pvp.
---
If they remove the additional loot they have to include t2 again. I think having the updated loot table aside from TF is the most likely (and most sensible imo) solution.
---
I won Orb of deception ( [https://classicdb.ch/?item=1973](https://classicdb.ch/?item=1973) ) in an UBRS run.   
---
Not so rare, but rare enough that i was offered 300g for it.  However, one can not really put a price on turning a dwarf into a troll every now and then.
---
Quel'Serrar. The ungodly amount of time and hours spent farming DM for that stupid book. When I finally got it all that time later I couldn't believe it at first. Surely i was just exhausted after yet another 30+ hour grind, but no! There it was in all its glory! Less than a couple of minutes before the scheduled maintenance too! Still to this day one of the most impressive grinding feasts I've accomplished in a game I think. I think about that part of my life from time to time and I can't wait to go back for a second glimpse this summer.
---
PvP is the only way to go. Best PvP and PvE guilds. Best people. Don't be a pussy and play on the real servers.
---
But this time around people will know what an ony attunement is and it will be much easier to do.
---
Cheap high framrate monitors are really crappy for anything that isn't FPS gaming. For WoW you don't need the super-smoothness, and would probably prefer having a monitor with decent color instead. Especially with the modern WoW engine, even on really good systems it rarely goes much above 70-80 FPS.
---
or install an addon..
---
Late night. Not enough people have the drive to sleep afternoon to midnight just for a game. So... less people, more mobs for me.
---
Look at all these plebs using monitors. There is nothing better than a beamer in the basement for nolife gaming
---
Mulgore. Home. At least it wus before I fucked everythin up.
---
Thank you for saying that! Im going a pretty human all the way. thank you
---
I'm down for some good storytelling but most vanilla quest are flat out boring stereotypes. Help us kill these guys. They invaded our lands. That guy stole food from our village. Fight for your faction. Kill the bad guys and secure this land. 
---
All these 1-3 chain quests have very similar storylines in each zone. It's just the same thing again. There are some diamonds like the defias story or Onyxia plot but you can catch up to that even if you missed that.
---
And? His other guildies are pretty average. Even ignoring that, a warrior doesn't have to do anything extra to be viable. They can slam their face into the keyboard repeatedly and still be decent. A druid has to have all their consumables, have a bunch of specific gear that has no great alternatives, has to farm a hundred copies of a mace from a boss in gnomer, and has to execute the most demanding rotation in classic to get to the same damage output as an average warrior...playing with other players as hardcore as that, as better classes, that's going to get you top 15 on a good night. Woo. 
---
That kind of effort may be worth it to some individuals, but it's still not worth more than a decent rogue or warrior, and it's only 'viable' for BWL and part of AQ. After that, it scales too poorly. It's better than the meme specs, but that's it.
---
pinging /u/unique-ishusername and /u/robmox
---
I wrote a pretty long reply but the Reddit app lost it.
---
&gt; I have a pserver level 52 Priest. What spec should I try?
---
At 52 you get Mind Flay rank 5. Nothing can keep up with Deep Shadow once you get that power spike.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
First off, [that guide](https://forum.nostalrius.org/viewtopic.php?f=39&amp;t=31668) is god awful. They claim SWP is the most mana efficient and recommend speccing into it to have an 18 second SWP. You should never be fighting mobs for 20+ seconds.
---
Mind Flay is god awful at level 25. You have such a strong wand.
---
&gt; also im a little confused on the value of imp fort.
---
Imp fort is not very big but nice to have. It is great on a PvP server. Keep in mind it helps your faction and party too. With spirit (and the rare mp5 and spell dmg) being a priority, stam is the only other thing you care about.
---
&gt; but if you arent dying is stam really worthwhile?
---
Yes, it is a resource. Just like mana. Stamina is not a priority. But compared to 1 spirit, there is an amount of stamina that will be just better. I would certainly take ~ 30 stamina over 1 spirit even on a PvE server.
---
You have cds and resources. Your resources consist of buffer (flat amount) and regen. When it comes to mana you make a choice between buffer (int) and regen (spirit). You need the regen to sustain what you do (but buffer becomes increasingly better the more regen you have). When it comes to HP, then you already have the best regen in the game! It's all about buffer.
---
Having more stamina will allow you to fight groups of 2-4 mobs (death sentence to warriors). They allow you to solo some elite mobs that can make full parties sweat. You are a one man army. A rogue ganks you, it is only about the initial burst. If you survive that, get a fear, heal, SWP and mindblast out, the rogue is fucked.
---
&gt; or is that survivability a real life saver?
---
On a PvP server, absolutely. You will die when people burst you before you can heal or before your cds are back up.
---
&gt; how about shadowweaving, if mobs are dying too quickly for sw:p to be useful doesnt that mean mobs will be dying before shadoweave can really stack?
---
Shadow weaving is a pure DPS and DPM increase. Once you use it, you are relying on Mind Flay. You will ramp up your Mind Flay's damage with every Mind Flay. It's not huge but it is one of many boosts. Shadow Weaving helps whenever you use more than one shadow spell. And you can weave mobs up by spamming 1-3 rank 1 shadow word pains and then do a monster Mind Flay. While this is not necessarily quick, it is very mana efficient. Rank 1 spells are essentially free and your max rank gets an insane boost.
---
I jotted down more info in something of a guide draft. But it's a lot of text and will probably lead to many questions. That is because there is no one right answer to what to do. You have a bunch of options and they come at pros and cons. But we can clear up some myths and reduce the options to around ~ 3 good approaches for experienced players. You still need to decide for yourself when you spec deep shadow. Levels 36, 40, 44 and 52 are reasonable points of entry.

Sul'thraze the Lasher !
---
I did zul farrak like 20 times, i got the first part on like my first or second run, i was 16, stupid and had never played an mmo before. I had never even seen an epic yet, i became obsessed with it, i couldn't even imagine how strong an epic weapon would be! I wanted it so bad that on the run that dropped the second part, i made a deal with the other warrior in our group, 80 gold if he didn't roll on it. 
---
**"That thing was too big to be called a sword. Too big, too thick, too heavy, and too rough, it was more like a large hunk of iron."** It was fucking awesome. It sucked but it looked fucking awesome.
---
What would you personally want them to cap out at instead of 50g? Not that I'm arguing, just curious. Personally, I wouldn't be against a 25g cap or even a 15g cap. 
---
Like I said, we all know these won't make it to the game so I figured I ask for people's opinions on the whole thing.
---
You might be autistic and I say that unironically.
---
That‚Äôs obviously not what I said, not everyone has shit intentions. ‚Äî bloodvine set will be out by then.
---
It becomes much harder to find a full LBRS/UBRS run group the more patches progress, you maybe have an easier time doing it at launch but come back and tell me how you'll find full runs without waiting as they become less relevant to the patch ,this becomes very noticeable around AQ if you're leveling an alt or you're a very slow leveler.
---
Whereas on alliance most of the things you need are solo, except UBRS 1 time ( compared to 2 for horde) the rest can be done mostly solo or at most needs 1 extra person (or 2 at most) at that time in the patch progression for any escort you may need.
---
The reason is that in vanilla people were really... really... I mean _really_ bad at the game.
---
So you needed the min/max of every guy in the raid. Because 80% of them would probably be using their mouse clicking on every ability.
---
True that. I posted quickly and looked like an ass. Sry
---
Talon of Vultros, a blue lvl 21 dagger that drops of Vultros, one of the rarest rare spawns in the game. It was really early vanilla, maybe 2 weeks after launch, so it felt like a pretty big deal then.
---
Raptor Strike for sure.
---
Not so sure about Mongoose Bite, prob not tho.
---
That's not the definition of unarmed. Following your logic civilians too cannot be considered unarmed, because they have fists and teeth, so in theory they can defend themselves against people with guns, right ? That's what the red army did more than once on the Eastern front : "You don't have carabines ? No worry. Germans have some. Go and take them". Doesn't really fit the current definition of the word "unarmed".
---
But either way that's not true in WoW, especially for casters, due to the game resist/miss/dodge/parry mechanics. Try using spells against somebody 10 + levels above you. You'll get about 100% of your spells resisted, even with specific talent points being put to avoid that, so even if that person stands still you won't be able to kill him. That's literally like being unarmed. Melees and Hunters have it a bit easier though, it's true.
---
Science broh
---
hunter has high disadvantage vs mage even more so than vs priests because of how many tools mages get to exploit hunter dead zone.
---
Bug or not, it was changed later to giving windfury an internal cooldown of like 2-3 seconds not sure what the exact number is.
---
But if you bring 6 other druids that all use innervate on the moonkin he can do as much as damage as a shadow priest! IT'S VIABLE.
---
I'm not going to dispute the spec he is saying, but hit is certainly not just an 'end game' thing. The +3 hit from prot is very valuable while leveling.
---
Why are you identifying with it (gay)? You're just playing the game (un gay)
---
It was somw kind of blue quality head dress. Found it in the middle of nowhere off a random mob. Gave it to a dear friend, he wore for AGES, haha.
---
Now all you have to do is find 6 Druids willing to be innervate bots vs the one Boomkin.
---
i have a mmo mouse, don't like it. too awkward and WAYYY too heavy.
---
Why?
---
Ive come to this conclusion too. If a pug on a pserver can do all of MC in one go, we must have been idiots when it took my guild several nights and many wipes back in the day.
---
Ugh its wasn't taunt, RD was nicely implemented in TBC, but it's not what "fixed" paladin tanks. Making conc a baseline ability, moving redoubt to chance on hit instead of chance on crit, spiritual attunement, adding a dmg reduction component to the imp RF talent, actually itemization with both +def and caster stats, and Avenger shield to give paladins a good opening threat move so they didn't lose agro right off the bat all had more to do with paladin tanking viability than taunt.
---
And even with all that, paladins were still the worst TBC tank by far. They couldn't MT due to various mechanics and struggled with content they were appropriately geared for, for example they had a hard time pushing into heroics at first. However once they did start getting geared they were awesome, and there was a wide variety of fights where they mechanically shined.
---
Nah there was a particular patch due to things like WF procing its self. Again that was a LONG time ago, but I'm relatively sure.
---
A man can hope
---
I would love some more RP enhancing items like flags, actually obtainable gear to complete RP sets, maybe even tents
---
I mean you could also bring some disc priests to give PI, some enhancement shamans to Keep up Stromstrike for him.
---
Then rank 14 would lose its value, if everyone has something its no longer special.
---
shes cute
---
Probably my favorite worst build so far. I would personally maybe redistribute those points in Iron Will across some other shitty prot talents, but Iron Will itself is pretty terrible here so...
---
By the way, I'm not an expert on buffs/debuffs and other classes, so I'm just asking this out of curiousity: Would putting 4/5 in Imp. Demo Shout be useless in a raid environment? I'm imagining there will always be a dedicated demo warrior who will have 5/5 in imp. demo shout which will override the 4/5 demo shout?
---
Reaching level 40 takes roughly 3-4 days playtime if you are relatively efficient but not an experienced speedrunner. So thats about 80 hours.   
---
Always sunny has 144 with each episode taking between 18 and 25 minutes. Thats roughly 50 hours.   
---
So yeah, you are very likely to be correct
---
get pissed because we stopped playing on private servers so we don't burn out. Then go back to the vanilla private servers, and ofc boycott all blizzard games from here on out.
---
wow thanks, thats a big list!
---
US? Horde...baniahan. I'll be rolling a PvP server this time. I didn't know the difference at release I just hit "recommend server" or some shit
---
Well, of those 3, Druid is the only one that can tank and heal 5 man effectivelly, so you can spec accordingly to your server needs.
---
(please, don't start with the shaman tank thing guys).
---
So, TL,DR: Go Druid :)
---
I wanted that for so long! I didn't even know what it did, I just thought the name was awesome.
---
ofc they don't know but not because they havn't finished, but more because they can't know what month will be most profitable with a most downtime and drop in subs.
---
You obviously don't use them on trash. Here is more of a sensible usage: If you are tanking and the boss is threat capped: Use 1 charge (out of 3) at the start to gain a threat advantage then switch to a defensive weapon (Warden Staff or similar). When DPSing you can use up to 3 charges on bosses that need to go down quickly, don't use any charges otherwise. Basically put in the extra effort when it makes sense.
---
The same goes for any consumable really. Consumable farming is time consuming, so use them when needed. Burning full consumables all the time on every encounter is simply not worth it, except you are in a hardcore guild that has the goal to decrease clear times as much as possible, but that is niche.
---
My rule of thumb: Always +stam from food/alcohol, mana potions on CD, 1 good defensive and/or 1 good offensive consumable and anything additional (including MCP for DPS) when the situation calls for it.
---
Alright, we're doing this.
---
A raid of druids to innervate the oomkin, a bunch of priests for healing and PI, a couple shaman for threat reduction, mana regen, and stormstrike...
---
Those other things should be easy enough to find, now we just need someone with no dignity or self respect to fill the oomkin role.
---
I'm perfect for the job.
---
Cool thanks!
---
Had a Human mage alt on a server where all my friends from scholl played. im a horde man my self, ran SFK and shadow fang dropped. Was able to sell it for over a 100g which made me very sad because i was broke on my main noob tauren warrior in his 40's with out a mount... and a fiery war axe had dropped while i was playing with my best bud on our horde chars, helping me grind gold for the mount. i gave it to him instead of selling it as best buds do!  we still play together today!
---
Thats right! The issue is theyre not bringing enough druids! &gt;:D 1 boomkin, 3 druid healers weaving innervates = boomkin #1 dps
---
the least notice t hey ever game in any of there previous releases in the past 16 years has been 2 months, and up to 5 months.
---
Passive Achievements so I can view total fish caught, largest ever hit, farthest height fallen from, total gold made from vending, duels lost, number of herbs collected, total distance traveled, number of flight paths taken, etc.
---
Blizzard already collects this data and because #nOcHaNgEs I'll never get to see it.  Going to be a real shame 5 years from now and can't look back at all the interesting things I've done.  Sigh
---
Druid or priest. Horde.
---
Hey all, I am pretty convinced on healing dungeons and hopefully most of the raids.  So I don't really have plans on tanking as druid really. I really like the playstyle of druids but a lot of people keep giving them a bad rap saying a priest would get accepted over them in dungeons etc, how true is this? I understand priest is the defacto healer so perhaps if healing is what I like I should play that.
---
If you'd found that again when Classic drops, you will be filthy rich. This must be the best epic BoE to get.
---

---
The Quel on my PALADIN. From book to forging my guild was supportive and helpful. Had a bit of drama when the book dropped but I farmed that shit for months looking for it. It dropped when I was doing a run with a guild off tank. Everyone knew I was gonna roll for it but when I won it there was some salt. 
---
Call me a shitter but i got to live the dream. I think it helped that it was like 5th string tank so nobody cared except him
---
Ironically Edgemasters Handguards became insanely expensive once people worked out that they are basically BiS for Fury Warriors through to Naxx.
---
I really want to roll a hunter and be good at it (I was a Warlock back in vanilla, loved the pet system but don't wanna play the same class again) but I'm concerned about the scaling thing.
---
I'm also concerned about not being invited to 5mans because mages and rogues are better in those situations.
---
with the knowledge people have now.. this thing is bis for fury warriors. they would buy it now.
---
One of the reasons I'm rushing 60 is to crush the gankers in TM. For the Horde
---
Hunter item!
---
still have it , it casts random spells from sheep to fireball or a fel hunter , los more too.
---
Just use the dynamo to power a laptop. If it's a gaming laptop you should juust about be able to go pee before it's starting to run the battery flat, and you're back in the saddle again.
---
If your goals is to heal dungeons and raids please elaborate on how Druid playstyle intrests you more than Priest? Most people who play Druid roll it because of the ability to have another playstyle than healing.
---
I played a healing priest in every single expansion except Classic and Burning Crusade. I was leveling a hunter in Classic but never hit max. Continued to level my hunter in BC, hit max, and raided nearly every tier of content besides Sunwell and Black Temple. 
---
I can't wait to heal in Classic. I'm thinking a warrior as my alt toon so I can tank.
---
If you never played a Warlock on vanilla, go for it. They are hella fun and have loads of utility and pretty good DPS with decent gear.
---
It's also a blast in PvP if you know what you are doing. You can 2v1, 3v1 regular/casual players and it's awesome.
---
The only reason I'm not rolling warlock on Classic is because it was my main, I played it from vanilla to WoD and I'm kinda tired of this class now. But a a first experience? Damn, I wish I could have that again.
---
Always.
---
First time Classic player, should I do Rogue or Warlock? These are the two I'm going back and for between. I love both ranged and melee, and while I'm well aware that Warlock is easy to level, as opposed to the Rogue which is supposed to be a lot harder from what I've read, I kind of want a challenge in leveling. My play style in WoW is pretty reckless (leveling not raiding) but not to the point where I'm picking fights I can't win. What do you guys think?
---
It is definitely needed to prevent long queue times and ghost servers. It is a good thing.
---
Man you uh... havent played a balanced mmo have you?
---
I love "what the heck did you say about me, let me get out of this cc and i will show you" playstyle. Mostly interested in wpvp and raiding. I also LOVE trolls. Any suggestions?
---
Paladins will be healing...the blessings should be 15 minutes from the get go. Once naxx hits, Paladins basically have infinite mana, and an argument can be made that they are the best healers at that point.
---
But priests have the bigger range of spells to use and are the de facto healer for vanilla.
---
Druids can still do decent healing. It's nothing to be excited about, and they scale worse than paladins and priests, and that's why they're memed on.
---
Shaman have chain heal and totems. So they're always great to have.
---
All of those classes will be healing right out of the gate, if they so choose, and I certainly hope they do.
---
Wow,, you really sold it to me!
---
This is a good point
---
Item: Spirit + Intellect stats.
---
Hunter - Yep, Need that.
---
Spend 2 seconds on a semi related thread on mmo-champion and you will find anti classic people coming out of the woodwork.
---
How can a druid spam a 3 minute cd spell? All healers use healing abilities. I can't believe I have to say that.
---
Priest has diverse healing tools. HoT, AoE heal, slow heal, fast heal but lacks utility. Dispel magic is the only big deal and you got some other very situational stuff.
---
Paladin is the king of one target healing with the most mana efficient healing in the game and utility spells are amazing.
---
Druid was always known for its HoTs and can hold their ground. They got great utility spells like Faerie Fire, Innervate and Rebirth.
---
One thing you have to know about Classic is it's not a numbers game. It's fine if you're not #1 in the penis meter. Each class has a job to do and each healer class fills its own role.
---
Ah, what I mean is outside of dungeons and raids. I plan on herbalism, using travel form, stealth and being able to basically escape most situations is appealing in that regard I think? I understand there's quite a complicated routine to follow as a druid in regards to pvp, where as priest has it pretty simple.
---
This happened to me in 8th grade.
---
Yeah priest is your best bet in my opinion. If you're grinding gold as a healer your weakness isn't really in your spec but your group. A healer and a dps warrior can do some pretty good farms as well as fight for things out in the world like devilsaurs. Just doing alot of dungeons can get you a good amount of gold, its not insane farming, but its more fun than actually grinding up gold and as a priest you can wand the entire time you're not healing to speed things up a bit. And running them with your guildies is always a good idea to help them get items and show your skill.
---
Paladin's are very mana efficient but only have 2 healing spells. You can put on a 2 hander and stack whacking stuff and try out crazy prot builds to farm with that get people hooked into the class.
---
Druids aren't bad, they have multiple healing builds to try and min max at different times. Some druids argue rejuv spamming is super bis, others like regrowth and healing touch builds. You can solo alot as a druid which should help with the gold farm but dungeons are gunna be worse because of your lack of a rez. You can do 2 druid 3 rogue stealth runs tho which are pretty fun.
---
Shamans are like turtles if you go the full resto build and must always wear a shield or staff unless you spec into more 2 handed weapons in enhance. I would say their best aspect is pvp healing. Having an interrupt and grounding totem makes being a healer in pvp really interesting but they are great raid healers too with chain heal. 
---
You can't really go wrong with anything as long as you like it and they're all pretty similar during raids just spot healing the raid or the tank. I'm not a healer so I don't know much about the numbers during different patches but those could change in classic. Anything could be slightly better at certain points because of an item update or the way something is coded. GL on your choice.
---
This was actually decent.
---
Flurry axe! [http://classicdb.ch/?item=871](http://classicdb.ch/?item=871) I still to this day rememer how exited I was. :D
---
I found the same mace in Tanaris. I was so happy back then and equiped it asap. I was 12 yo at the time. Good memories!
---
Aside from not scaling with +weapon damage Cat DPS has one very important problem: They just lack scaling moves. If you look at the Cat rotation then it is 2 DPS abilities that you use in Shred and Bite. Bite just adds flat damage and is a finishing move. Shred scales up % wise with higher damage per hit but that is really it.
---
If you look at Rogues and Fury Warriors: They have multiple moves, talents and invidual buffs that have multiplicative scaling. You can call them steroid abilities. Good examples would be Slice and Dice, Flurry etc. Add them on top of eachother and you get DPS that is easily increased with additional buffs and better gear.
---
Hardcore guilds go full circle and require Shamans to DPS.
---
Raids are made in a way that you need a certain amount of healers for the final boss and perhaps 1-2 more encounters.
---
The majority of a raid you get away with half as many healers.
---
Hardcore raid leaders like Shamans that totem twist and weave in melee attacks. Nightfall Shamans are OP.
---
Having more than 1-3 mana tides is usually a waste.
---
In terms of PVP both in world and battlegrounds how well do Warlocks hold up against other classes and in groups. I think I fancy playing a Lock more than a Mage but I feel I will miss the mobility of a Mage. Are Locks fun to play in PVP?
---
that's the reason you move with both mouse buttons clicked for a short moment.
---
Sorry I come off as a douche saying that. 
---
It's just that kind extremely detailed, very specific order type pre-planning is in all honesty something someone with signs of autism would do. Again, no cruel intentions saying this.
---
True pros turn off all UI. Just you and the gameworld. Actionbars? L2P! A map? A true patron never needs a map
---
Oh yeah you‚Äôre definitely a douche. It‚Äôs a meme post, thanks for commenting
---
Because WoW is a Roleplaying game. I prefer to play a character I can identify with. Can't do that with a female character.
---
Tourists are the people who are expected to log in try it out, get to level 10 and quit for whatever reason.
---
The reason the term "Tourist" getting thrown around is because classic launch is expected to have a lot of players who will try it out, find it's too hard or not for them and quit.
---
Can just make the decay happen quicker
---
Believe me, refactoring legacy code CAN BE a whole lot more work then doing it from scratch. Ofc it depends and idk how it is with wow obviously. But generally speaking, it can be a true, major everlasting pain in the ass.
---
Good, it was never a measure of skill anyway, just who had the ability to account share to China
---
The sand polished hammer!! Oh man I will never forget it, I was like 13/14 years old and got in a aq20 pug, didn‚Äôt have much of raiding experience but I guess I had decent gear (mostly dungeon blues and some pvp items). Anyway we managed to clear the whole raid and I was kinda sad because I had rolled pretty bad (remember loosing a roll on that sword from the first boss, can‚Äôt remember its name). And then that magnificent mace dropped! A bloody epic! It was so big and looked so cool with that chain handle. I fkn shaked and prayed to god when I rolled on it and I freaking won!! I got so happy that I even started to scream on my dad like I had won a million dollars. He came in running to my room and asked what was going on. So I showed him my new awesome mace and he actually seemed impressed (probably wasn‚Äôt by an in game item lol) and then he asked me to show it to him in action. So I HS back to IF and ran out and one shotted some boars and he was like ‚Äì‚ÄúCool your character seems really strong‚Äù. Man I felt like the mightiest rogue in whole Azeroth.
---
Definitely going for that mace again! Can‚Äôt wait on a release date!
---
reserved
---
Yeah, but does it actually work, if you don't have enough debuff slots?
---
he's wow jesus. /s  
---
It's nice to see people that do good things for others. so let's hope the people in need are really in need and happy to be able to enjoy some nice classic wow
---
Ashjr'thul...
---
There were only 2 hunters in the guild (since we both had 100% attendancy). Hunter set items dropped so often, not only did we both get full dragonstalker insanely fast, it drove 2 mages so crazy they rage quit the game.
---
However.
---
That crossbow from Chromaggus, bis for hunters (especially in pvp) untill the nerubian slave maker (drop from very last boss in naxx FYI), dropped for the first time after our first Maexna kill (naxx boss).
---
I was pvping a lot (rank 12 while having a job) so not getting this was very frustrating. But if only a few months before tbc, I got it, I fucking got it.
---
Oh and BTW... I played on the server... Chromaggus...
---
no people want new content with vanilla wow philosophy.
---
Content with emphasis on socialization, difficulty, cooperation, adventure, mistery, exclusivity and a lived in world not a set of multiplayer maps with portals to teleport in between.
---
The fact that we asked for classic servers in the first place was because we did not trust current blizzard in knowing how to make vanilla like content, therefore we asked for vanilla with no changes.
---
Had blizzard still been a good development studio and not lost it to greed and pursue of money over anything, we would not have asked for a vanilla option because the game would still be amazing.
---
Well, it's an indicator at least.
---
Also the fact that it got 5manned in Vanilla.
---
Maybe add a couple of windows and a door to those walls, and some furniture won't hurt either
---
Swifty was born to be a scumbag, and even Horde-side, no one liked him. He bit off a crapload more than he was allowed to chew, however, when he broke "realm schedules" and decided to take his business to Winterspring. Ganking during "truce" hours so people can gather mats for Naxx? Hah.
---
I farmed an elite bear (dont remember the name) in winterspring on my rogue which at the time had the highest drop chance for the Krol blade. After a long period I gave up. Suddenly, while questing in Silithus, it dropped from a random mob. My rogue still carries the sword today! (Transmogged though)
---
I am so confused. 
---
What does any of this have to do with Classic wow?
---
Hraaaaaaaagh!!!
---
It would still be a 700+ hour investment for r14... Hardly anyone would get it.
---
That‚Äôs why we need sharding in starter zones
---
I think you posted on the wrong subreddit.
---
I agree with everything you said, but at the same time you are hinting the answers to your rethorical questions:
---
&gt; Why bring an extra druid for innervate when you just bring another priest or paladin? Sure, battle rez is nice, but especially as you progress, people shouldn't be dying. Why bring an extra cat4fite when you just bring a rogue or warrior? Why bring another bear when you can bring a warrior?
---
Because neither a Warrior/Rogue/Priest/Paladin can do all those things, only a Druid can if feral or HotW/NS specced. It is a tradeoff between efficiency and flexiblity. Also a very large amount of their gear is completely self-earned. They need very few items for raids compared to other classes and they don't compete for gear that others want in masses, like weapons etc.
---
server resets.
---
AND
---
SEPERATE tbc servers.
---
It doesn't seem like a meme post and he is correct. But it's also correct to assume you are just very excited for classic.
---
Claw of chromaggus... that epic dagger with amazing stats and skin.. perfect for my shaman.. couldn‚Äôt believe it when I saw I lost the roll and the guild officers loot councilled it to me..
---
8.2 is on ptr now right? Could be released in may or early June with some luck.
---
Why not just but a headset with a mic?
---
I love it when people question the dogma. I‚Äôll check out your draft when I get home.
---
I've got a couple hundred hours of a certain pod cast I'll be listening too again while I level.
---
IMO that's part of the fun. I've decided not to pre-plan what class/race I'll be playing. Because when I stare at that Classic character creation screen for the first time, I want to sit there for 20 minutes as every decision comes to me naturally.
---
No changes, EU months later. Kek
---
I've heard that Wlocks are bullies in 1v1. That they are some sort of unbeatable battleship that can destroy anyone.
---
Yeah me too. I like facts and testing things out.
---
It's not like I never went Shadow at 40 either and it is hilarious how much more players respect you if you are Shadow. Suddenly everyone leaves you alone! It's all viable. Sadly I did not make comparisons for when to go deep shadow yet.
---
doesn't matter ,  just hope the names i want wont be taken :p
---
A server like that would be interesting.
---
They look tasty
---
Wholly/Grail seemed superior. Again, hopefully the author will support Classic.
---
Yeah, I remember - but the talents alone wouldn't solve that many issues (they also were balanced for 70 at that point). Many specs would still miss out on proper itemization
---
Whichever's sooner.
---
Do you seriously think every single player would farm for it? The strenght of Rank 14 gear in no way justifies the amount of grind it requires currently. 
---
Only end game raiding gear is justified with the amount of pain getting it.
---
Just my opinion of course, you don't have to agree.

You are not thinking big enough
---
The scrubs will do that anyway, it's legal after all.
---
There are numerous bosses in high level 5mans you can't kill if you don't have a tank, except your group is very overgeared. Some of them will simply 2 shot a cloth wearer.
---
Hunter can move between their shots, and warlocks have to stand still to cast (you can move while dotting, but you will hate dispells). In PVP i like hunter alot because i feel like i can burst alot better and my dots wont get dispelled. If you are horde, then Warlock can be alot diffrent,   cause of undead and being able to play orc warlock.
---
The general rule is that gaming headsets don't provide audiophile-grade sound or even the next few steps down from that.
---
My man!! :)
---
You mean a panther
---
I think we‚Äôll get a release date after 8.2 drops properly. They‚Äôre marketing 8.2 and it‚Äôs make or break for BfA really - they won‚Äôt want their own products to be outshone.
---
I think that's what got us bfa. Blizz seems to see we just want classic for this version.
---
Yeah, that was the usual reaction. Being 11 at the time and playing my first MMO, i couldn‚Äôt really comprehend game mechanics but I knew Purple was very rare, especially prior to 60.
---
I'm suprised enough druids even exist to fill a 40man raid.
---
... and we get something that does almost as much damage as a mage!
---
Ouch. Well, at least I'm an honest douche.
---
It‚Äôs not the pre-tbc patch or we‚Äôd be expecting 2.0.1
---
By T3, yes. They are a literal raid boss
---
Fang of the Mystics. We were some random tier 3 guild on Illidan and miraculously managed to kill Azuregos after another guild wiped. It had 50+ dps, I think 1.5 speed, and a spell crit back when I got it on my shaman, and I was pumped imagining the rapid fire windfury tornado that I would unleash on my enemies. Later when the dps got nerfed but they turned it into a legit caster weapon by adding +40 spellpower, that was pretty sweet.
---

Looking for semi casual European guild purely pve focused. Used to play during vanilla a NE hunter but unfortunately I was 58 when BC was released and thus didnt have the chance to raid at 60.. I did raid karazhan at 70 but stopped wow after a while due to high school studying. 
---
Will be playing a mage (most likely !!), and will be able to raid 2 times a week evenings.  Prefer PVE server but dont really care that much.
---
ALSO ALLIANCE !!!!
---
If we go on old statistics, rogues are gonna be plenty. Everybody had a rogue back in the day. If it wasn't your main you had an alt that was a rouge. Thats just how the way things were. Wlocks on the other hand were the least played "common class" if i understand it correctly (not counting the faction specific ones since they are likely less played than all the others). But this is all considering late game gameplay. During levling tho.  While Wlocks are pretty strong at questing (but still beaten in speed by mage and hunter) rogues can still hold their own in many other quests. Long and tedious fetch quests is a walk in the park if you decide to go rogue. Also if you play rogue on a pvp server you will have less of a risk getting ganked 24/7 if your not one of the fastest to level.  
---
There is also the money factor. Many people put wlocks on a pedistal with the "free mount" hurr durr and how that will save you alot of money. But thats not really the case. If you don't have a careful hand on your money all your money will be wasted on grimoirs for your demons (talking from my own experience). I don't really know if there is any specific extra costs as rogue tho. sorry.   
---
TL:DR  
---
If you want to be one of the most played classes play rogue. They are always fun to play but you might get sandwiched by all other rogue players. Otherwise i think Wlock might be better. But this is all just my opinion :) .
---
Multiverses amaze me

Make sure to watch ‚ÄúBig Trouble in Little China.‚Äù

Lol read the comment above he already said even with skill warriors lose 1v1

I farmed for a black oozling pet in felwood for like 2 weeks on my druid.  They had a small drop chance from an ooze bag that had a chance to drop from the slimes there.  Its was around 2500 slimes when one dropped 2 ooze bags.  The first one had the pet and the 2nd one was bugged and wouldn't open.  I was so stoked; they sold for a lot on the AH but I really wanted it or myself.  I will never forget that grind and the way I found it.
---
Pretty easy over a long period of time, just getting 1 rank a week is extremely doable with moderate playtime until the higher ones.
---
As a druid it should be cake if you know what you're doing with flags.

Eventually I got addicted to the waist getting smaller and before you know it I was adding minutes and days and six months later, 8% 180lbs.

Yes! I got one of those too! I had all these wild fantasies about getting it, then going into Org and ambushing people. But then I quickly discovered that guards would still attack you. Dreams shattered.

The most role defining set bonuses that come to mind are the full 8/8 priest t2, warlock 6 piece bonus t3, and druid 2 piece bonus t3.

My wife:  in the same week got rivendare, anzul, and the headless horseman mount.....
---
Warriors are the most versataile tanks and take the least damage over time when prot specced. Paladins are decent 5man tanks, especially in strath/scholo and they can tank adds/trash/AoE in raids when not healing with a gear swap but they are mana dependand. Shamans can tank all 5mans and some raid trash. Druids can tank all dungeons and almost all raid bosses but take more damage while causing more threat than prot warriors.
---
If your goal is *just* to tank then go with Warrior 100%.
---
world of warcraft looks TERRIBLE on a screen larger than 32 inches
---
32 inches is 81.28 cm
---
I got up to Legionnaire , that wasn't easy and I was server #1 for a short time
---
Exactly..  op said assuming good gear and skill warriors lose 1v1 unless I read it wrong...
---
None, because the RNG Gods have literally been the bane of my WoW existence for oh...14 years now.
---
if you want to be a pve legend you want pvp gear as well, the two are very much connected
---
&gt;are paladin's early on really expected to just be buffing people without healing annyone? is a priest the only class that is considered to be actually healing in raids/pvp?
---
Who's said that? Paladins are the better main tank healers and their survivability / buffs are insane in PvP.
---
Those gloves are BIS for fury warriors through-out all of vanilla (save for maybe Cthun gloves).
---
Most hardcore guilds will be PvP.
---
You do realize those images you post are ***four and a half years old***, right? Those screenshots were taken before WoD even released. The Human Female faces look nothing like those. Compare your first image with this: [https://i.imgur.com/jsIo0Hy.png](https://i.imgur.com/jsIo0Hy.png)

You can say the new models are bad, you can say they're not unique. Don't try to pass off 4.5 year old beta WoD models as current ones.

You're forgetting the rally hearth stone CD reducing set, bubble hearth the tier set!

There were so many extra servers during BlizzCon though
---
That would be a ret paladin with reckoning
---
I don't know what low pop is in actual numbers but on my vanilla server I remember there being 3 decent alliance raiding guilds (2 hard core, 1 mid), 2 horde (1 hard core, 1 mid). Then of course a number of other casual ones.  
---
I remember it taking a while before AV would pop unless the premaders coordinated to stop doing WSG for a day. At least originally when a day would be spent over the graveyard in the middle rather than the later zerg rushes it became.  
---
My biggest fear on launch that will 'detract' from the classic experience is the rush that will exist that didn't before where a number of players on each server will race to 60 and knows immediately what to monopolise. I've heard what happens on pservers where people race to farm devilsaur etc then are able to sell to the player base and get so rich they don't need to ever grind for the lifetime of the server. Fundamentally I feel this will change the environment, but maybe not - we will see!  
---
It probably isn't possible to reproduce the trickle start that occurred before since the majority of it is simply knowledge.
---
A S H K A N D I
---
Those idiots will stream their raids too, which makes their whole guild easy prey.

In a Hunter‚Äôs DPS rotation, there are two shots in a row without a yellow hit between them, before Aimed Shot and Multi Shot are off CD. That‚Äôs when you run in and raptor strike.
---
This is the most terrifying thing from the trilogy.
---
I go full ret until 31 (or is it 33) when I respec into ret/holy. I basically respec when I can get both consecrate and SoC. Then i''ll go for the movementspeed in ret asap because it's important, and get crit after.
---
The holy tree is super good because the 10% strength talent is pretty okay, at least compared to say the might buff (which you shouldnt spec), it's just straight better.
---
Then you get 70% chance of no pushback which is godly for lvling and pvp, as well as conc which gives you more dps if your mana allows it, and on fast attack mobs such as panthers, you can pull a couple with conc and ret aura and be decently efficient there.

If finding materials in the world proves difficult then wouldn‚Äôt classes who excel at farming instances be good gold farmers? Warriors are great at farming dire maul east
---
Reddit, man.
---
I am expecting Diablo 3 levels of fuckup.  If the game is playable the day after release, I will be thrilled.
---
Straight facts! Great content!
---
You're slacking dude ! :p
---
A TV with the same image quality as a gamimg monitor is just more expensive. Just get a big monitor if you want more.
---
I'm that kind of Hunter.
---
Staff of Jordan.
---
I still remember what southsea pirate it dropped in stv. On the gangplank to one of the ships.
---
Made a good penny.
---
Getting that awesome feel when an epic dropped was actually something to remember.
---
Myrmidon's signet on my rogue and equiped it instead of selling it for a cool 200-400 gold. We we're all noobs once!
---
Idol of the Moon + Flask of Supreme Power and a few stacks of Major Mana pots &amp; Greater Arcane Elixirs, Mageblood pots &amp; mp5 food - I see no problem here.
---
5? I saw the video of people 4 manning Onyxia a few days before TBC launch, but never an mc 5 man.
---
What about rank 12? I see that the 3 piece epic armor set would be all I need for real good fc'ing. How long would the grind from 10-12 be?
---
So if I‚Äôm reading this right, you can weave a melee hit in between every shot even with the 18% Quiver?
---
Found soulkeeper in a random locked Chest in western plaguelands - never felt that lockpicking was more useful than in that moment!
---
Can't wait for Classic but i hope if they do Expensions its not the same. I don't wanna play BfA 14 years later again.
---
I read they planned alot other Classes back in the Day  but never came.
---
You should mention it only works for ppl with relatively small hands 
---
As a big person with big hands I can't use Naga at all because the buttons are too small
---
Actually warriors are the modern and more meta version of hunters. Leather mail plate, they need it all
---
Warrior needed no reagents
---
Paladins rival priest healing from the very first raid, and they stay extremely competitive. Their raw healing output is very impressive, but they do pretty much only spam flash light for healing. Priest is likely better if you want more than a one button spam.
---
WoW is for tourists.
---
Tbh I can‚Äôt remember anymore
---
Get a 32‚Äù 1440p monitor.
---
People thats going to put in extra time to be ahead of the curve are not going to "chill out" in STV , they are going to do dungeons, farm mats, farm money for mount, pre quests etc to stay ahead.
---
Hey, first of all, sorry for replying so late and thanks for posting. :)
---
Honestly, that sounds like a lot of work for a casual like myself. With family and work, I highly doubt I'll be able/have time to do those grinds efficiently, so going with a mage or lock would probably be better.
---
When you first start out leveling it guides you right through what you need for abilities. Powders for vanish, poison shit etc. I am not sure there is a guide for that tho
---
Those were not gamebreaking.
---
Reagents were for few spells in the game.
---
Only those on revival spells were usefull
---
I wouldn't worry about it, every class gets screwed in some way. Warriors don't use any reagents but carrying around 2 sets of will mess up your inventory
---
Mages need Arcane Powder for Int buff
---
Locks need shards
---
Rogues need poisons and blind/vanish powder
---
Priest need candles for Stam buff
---
Druids need acorns or something for Mark buff and to battle rez.
---
Paladin's need symbols for Blessings 
---
Hunters need a quiver and pet food
---
Shamans probably have the least issue as all they need to carry around are 4 totems, anhks for reincarnate and maybe fish oil for water walking but don't play shaman just because of that lol.
---
The only ones that effect your gameplay outside of buffing is probably rogues locks and hunters and maybe druid because a druid that can't battle rez isn't much of a druid.
---
What?
---
I farmed ZF 186 times on my warrior to get this.  One ZF run I snagged Jang off the end boss, and thus my obsession began.  Luckily, Witch Doctor Zumrah drops some pretty nice caster gear, so it wasn't hard to find a healer to chain run the first two bosses over and over.  There was a solid week of my life where I was completely obsessed with getting the other half of this sword, it was really all I could think about.  There's even a Night Elf in Gadget named Trenton Lighthammer who gives you a little lore snippet and flavor text about Sul'thraze, which only poured gasoline on the flames of my obsession.  186 goddamn runs, and I finally got the sword of Antu'sul.  It was still early in Vanilla so I think i was the first one on the server to get it.  Some of my guildies advertised in orgrimmar that I got it and I got a flood of "congrats!" whispers, and one of those guildies crafted me a full set of imperial plate as a celebration gift.
---
good fuckin' times man
---
I‚Äôm uncultured swine because MoP was a poorly thought out expansion? You sure are triggered.
---
What the fuck are you
---
I still poop my pants when I see that scene
---
thats alot different. Ranking past 9 or 10 can't really be done casually and depends on what the other people on your server are doing. But no matter what you will have to sit down and really try.
---
Planning in focusing a bit on PvP (hopefully world pvp in rp events) but do want to be useful in raids. Unsure between Warrior and Rogue mostly, with Hunter and Paladin being choices I am also kind of interested in, but don‚Äôt think would work as much. Warriors seem strong but the idea of possibly getting forced to tank does concern me a bit as it is something I tend to shy away from in other games, while Rogue seems like fun, but also a dime-a-dozen. I like Hunter, but hate the dead zone, and Zalgradis PvP videos are my favorite and influence my interest in Paladins, but otherwise I‚Äôm lukewarm to the class. Warlock would also work if it wasn‚Äôt for being incompatible the general character idea of being a ranking military officer since I want to try running a dwarf/gnome only rp guild (the cliched military based variety, but it‚Äôs something that justifies wanting to pvp so hey) and Druid seems kinda neat but afaik the only thing they seem to really do great at pvp wise is flag running... and you can see where I have issues picking something.
---
Priest / Druid / Shaman T2 3p bonus.
---
If they release the game as late as September (my period for taking vacation ends late August) I seriously am going to lose what little faith I have in Blizzard these days.
---
They're able to solo Mara and DM.
---
rip gf
---
Guess it's not 'intended' method and they did say that they'd fix bugs..
---
I remember being level 60 for about six months, and fighting for raid spots in my guild.  When I was picked for an MC run, i was pretty elated.  Nightslayer Chestpiece dropped off Golemagg, and my guild's loot council took one look at my level 52 green quest reward and took pity.  That was my first epic on my rogue.  I later went on to get all 8 pieces.  Ohhh fuzzy nilla memories.
---
Yeah, and given that this is such a small IP to Blizz that there‚Äôs no need for a beta, I‚Äôm guessing this will be their shortest notice. It‚Äôs also better for hype if they don‚Äôt give too early of a notice. I also doubt they‚Äôd plan around the people taking work off to play it.
---
Yeah I was thinking warlock/ hunter originally, but I really like how much utility shaman has with healing and pvp burst. Also chain heal.
---
So went shaman. : D
---
I also thought they weren't that usefull, cauce they got no stats on them... Good old times :)
---
paladins! they need eeeeeeverything
---
Super stuck between Mage and Priest. I'm a WoW noob. Any insight for me?
---
**NIGHT ELF PRIEST**
---
PROS
---
 - Night Elf is my favourite race fantasy; female Nelf favourite flavour, model and casting animations
---
 - Give people heals, buffs - very socially conductive
---
 - Make friends for this
---
 - Shadowmeld/mindcontrol PvP trolling. Shadowmeld and Wisp great for PvP QoL.
---
 - Saber mount is awesome
---
CONS
---
 - Suboptimal race/class combo. Might get shit for this
---
NEUTRAL
---
 - Healing is more involved and difficult in PVE, possibly more fun
---
**GNOME MAGE**
---
 - Mage class is my favourite class fantasy
---
 - Give people portals, food and water for tips
---
 - Make friends, better off for gold because of this
---
 - More convenience, faster levelling, good solo class
---
 - Optimal race/class combo
---
 - Great in PvP, high skill ceiling
---
 - Favourite starting zone
---
 - Mechanostrider mount is meh
---
 - Raiding is spam frostbolt, boring they say
---
Illidan summoned nagas in the wc3 campaign, I bet Azshara new whats up and send Vasj for certain purpose.
---
Well you wouldnt be able to put out enough amps for that unfortunately üòÖ
---
Yes the crypts were a big project of John Staats, a dungeon/raid designer. I'd have to look it up again but I think he was working on it before a lot of other raids and dungeons. There were lots of plans to have it in vanilla but it just wasn't meant to be until BC.
---
A cheaper option to change just a few talent points.  Sucks to have to pay 50gp from a failed experiment.  Maybe 20 gp to refund all talents spent in one tree?
---
Yup. I had a warrior need on a mail chest with agi and crit chance a while back. Got called a stupid hunter for saying that it's hunter gear. Yay.
---
Spoilers!
---
The grind doesn't get bad until 11 imo. I was planning on stopping at 11 on my druid, but ended up going all the way because the stars were aligned. The gear was well worth it on a druid. If you're in the defacto top group on your server, ie you set the brackets, literally never lose to anyone, etc, then you can be done ranking with free weekends and stuff.
---
In vanilla, every class brings something unique which helps the group. If some hardcore group decides they are too good to invite certain classes, then more power to them. For most groups, the benefits outweigh any disadvantages.
---
As far as healing, the main tank normally has both a Druid and a Priest assigned. The Priest will probably put up bigger numbers, but the Druid's HoT's will protect the tank when he is taking huge spikes of damage. Each class brings unique tools to the fight.
---
In the right hands, Druids are imba in PvP, tbh. Look around YouTube and you can find some people doing truly amazing things.
---
I can‚Äôt imagine most tourists staying more than a few days.
---
I know there was a thread once here that had calculated how much you had to downrank wrath or starfire for you to not get oom as a moonkin. I wonder if thats "viable"
---
Piccolo
---
so true
---
*A druid without BR cant rez
---
You need to look at the percent heals completed stat and use it to decide whether a more expensive heal should be used. Once you find a rank that is in the 50-75% range that's probably the optimal choice for the fight.
---
Rogue, Warlock, Hunter.
---
I will start with Warrior and Mage
---
Sry not everyone RPs
---
Depending on factors with your server, R10 is do-able on a more casual schedule. Anything beyond that is gonna take more dedication.
---
I got both thekals grasp and arloks grasp when they where still on low drop rate. It was so fun to discover what the peoc actually looked like as there wasnt even an image on google of it. Had a good laugh shooting my bullets from a stiff tiger model. People would freeze in bg lokking at me, very fun item all in all untill I replaced it with barb of the sand reaver :)
---
This. On my lvl 52 rogue alt, bored at 3am farming mindlessly at Hearthglen. Alt+tabbing to wowhead to check what would be the best drop for my combat sword specced rogue at my level in need of a strong main hand. Krol blade of course, but less than 0,01%. Dude, what were you thinking..
---
I get back to wow, next pack of mob, hopelessly looting, the Krol blade. I litterally turned around to check if there was any kind of Blizzard spirit in the room. That was something. I kept it until my late lvl60.
---
Most tier parts are pretty bad for PvE, PvP even T1 is usualy a solid choice, thanks to bigger stat pools. 
---
For max DPS, the early BiS items even after having MC on farm are still blues, even more so once if DM is out.
---
I was a DPS / off-tank warrior: 31/5/15  
---
I was pretty undergeared, and we had a raid night in MC / BWL, the other 3 DPS warriors weren't online.
---
I got 8 - 9 pieces of loot that evening, the ones I remember getting:  
---
Flameheart Gauntlets  
---
Obsidian Edged Blade  
---
Helm of Endless Rage
---
Drake Talon Pauldrons
---
Drake Talon Cleaver (after I got the OEB)
---
Probably got some Tier 1 tanking pieces too, but I was more obsessed with being a "DPS" warrior than anything.
---
[Renataki's Charm of Beasts](http://classicdb.ch/?item=19953#comments)
---
Hunter trinket from ZG. It was pretty rare to get due to the mechanics of how the items dropped, and my guild was free rolling on them at the start, and when I managed to get 2-3 pieces, guildmates just declined to roll on them against me (the benefits of always being down to run dungeon even if I didn't need anything) so I can complete it.
---
The trinket didn't have much PvE use, but let me tell you about how ridiculous it was to ambush people in BGs, specifically using it paired it with Ashjre'thul, Crossbow of Smiting, to fire 2 back to back Multishots into a big group of enemies. An Aimed shot + 2 Multishots with a few crits would eat up cloth wearers very well.
---
It was rendered useless later on, and changed to be much less useful, but I still dream of the days I could murder squishies in Vanilla on my Hunter.
---
I farmed Strat for that mount for weeks if not months. The *one* time someone came with me was the only time it dropped and of course he won the roll and of course his account has been suspended indefinitely because he told his credit card co to not honor his subscription when he cancelled during Cata.
---
No pathfinding, not improved mend pet (at least 1 point), 5 points in Frenzy.... yeah, our definitions of "best leveling spec" are clearly different
---
Is he just wingclipping to fish for Windfury procs?
---
Back in the day I was in an all Druid guild on Boulderfist, they were working on raiding last I remember and had some successful clears.
---
First 3 pics Can be easily avoided, if you get rid of your GF, Family and friends before Classic Launch. 
---
Pic number 5 is worth all of the above.
---
I will look awesome.
---
Or warrior factoring in his troll love
---
I thought I'd got my shit together, but now I don't know what class to play. AGAIN
---
I did it somewhat easy with a full time job back in vanilla.
---
You just need to grind smart, as fun as they might seem, AV battles that lasts for hours on end are bad for getting honor (diminishing kills return less and less honor)
---
&gt;1.12 client
---
Classic will be based on the modern client. This might be possible, unless Blizzard wants to explicitly block these types of database queries to provide a more authentic experience.
---
There's been a sudden rise of meme quality in this subreddit... and I like it.
---
It‚Äôs....It‚Äôs all so clear now!!
---
The reagents that aren't just bought from a vendor that I can remember are. 
---
Shaman: fish scale and fish oil for water walking/breathing
---
Mage and Priest need light feathers for slow fall and levitate
---
Rogues craft blinding powder from fadeleaf but it can also be pickpocketed.
---
Warlocks create soulstones
---
While I agree for the rest, improved mend pet is a must take for both quality of life and for pvp. Without it, a mage can 100 to 0 you without you touching him, with it, it's almost becomming a fair fight.
---
WoW is making record income actually. I don‚Äôt have one difinitive source on hand, but I‚Äôve heard it from numerous Blizz employees. It makes sense too, even if you have 1/4 the subs, there‚Äôs probably 1/2 of that crowd that buys nearly every brand new mount for 25-40 as well as gold tokens.
---
I could easily see them releasing BC&gt;Wrath, until we have the original trilogy to play in its old glory. Demand will be there, it‚Äôs cheap (cheaper than Classic) to replicate, and Classic won‚Äôt maintain peak subs forever, no matter how much bloat you inject into it.
---
I think I have settled on hunter. Which professions would be good for hunter if I want to earn good money?
---
Moonkin the caster equivalent of a Ret Pally.  1 button rotation of pure skill.
---
Me and 3 friends had a lan at my parent's, we were farming some stuff in DM and happened to get a forrors compendium drop, 3 of us didnt even really know what it was, but the 4th Guy went crazy, instantly trying to sell it and people had tons of post on stormscale forums wanting to but It.
---
Then we did another 4 DM Runs and got a 2nd forrors compendium and we were all laughing our asses off this time, all 4 of us got pretty famous on the server for a while, and many top guilds would PM us on a regular basis just to tell us how annoyingly Lucky we were. And some warriors actually hated us just because they farme it Day in and Day out and we got 2 books in 5 Runs.
---
We were offered a good ammount of irl money and tons of ingame gold. All 4 of us got epic mount and a lot of money to spare. Pretty cool experience :D
---
I feel personally attacked. =(
---
Windfury has a 20% chance on melee hit when applied to your weapon to grant 2 extra instant melee attacks and boosts your attack power by X for ~1 second.
---
Those 2 extra attacks can proc all any any non-extra attacks effects such as inherent weapon procs, weapon enchancts like crusader or firey weapon, and other trinkets like heart of wrymthalak and darkmoon card maelstrom.
---
In 1.12, windfury has an internal cool down and can no longer procs off itself or other extra attack effects such as the hand of justice. Also, the attack power bonus of windfury and windfury totem were reduced my 50% in patch 1.11.
---
Now having said all that, I would still highly recommend any and all enhancement shamans test put windfury for classic should anything be altered, or where windfury mechanics could have potentially be changed with the newer modern game engine.
---
Oh, no.. no way to by pass that furblog cave.. and that one is easy enough to run through... PS, thanks Fuhzzies for giving them that info!
---
Red dragonscale shield from vael. Loved it! Judgement shoulders never dropped in over 12 months though üòî

The Shaman Tier 2 three-piece bonus increases healing to additional Chain Heal targets by 30%, making the Helmet, Gauntlets, and Bracer of Ten Storms BIS for all of Vanilla.
---
it's worse because Horde get to farm LBRS and UBRS for actual gear.. while Allies are stuck in BRD.  This is coming from someone who is rolling Ally on Classic, fyi.  I've just been Horde on the private servers that I've played.
---
man i remember doing ZG a ton for this set, never got it, it will be one of my goals this time around.
---
Warlock 5 piece T1/T2, added 100/120 resist all to your pet. Basically meant your felhunter could solo mages, which was hilarious in pvp. Interestingly was probably meant to enable warlock pets to dps in raids since they could survive the AoE. I'd be curious to try and SL build with this and see how it works out.
---
Yeah the animations with the updated models, has become more like WC3 with the even more exaggerated movements, compared to the animations from the original models.
---
Just cuz u saw one tank deadmines once doesnt mean they're real tanks.
---
Level with skinning/leatherworking. At 60 drop skinning and take engineering. Then do solo DM:N runs and get the HoTW pattern for LW.
---
You would think.  But I'd wager there's gonna be newbs just the same.  I was running UBRS to get pre-raid gear on private recently and people still don't know how to keep their damn backs to the wall to avoid getting punted.
---
Got the two 1h swords from Zulfarrak and got to combine them into my first legendary. Still have it on my main and transmit it sometimes
---
I respect your opinion, but he doesn't have to mitigate his own thoughts just because some people find it hard to read 100 words before getting distracted.  
---
I'd suggest the people that struggle with that particular problem won't be the ones caring about the content of this post anyway.
---
Priest or Paladin for PVE healing? Help me boys!
---
if only tauren wouldn't be too fat for other mounts...
---
To me leveling is the entire game.  I never did raids at all in vanilla and I didnt feel like I had to.
---
 Questing, dungeons, and world pvp were a blast.  So much so that after some battlegrounds and 5-man dungeons at 60 I would just start all over again.
---
Mages will wrek rogues 1v1 if only using class abilities.
---
Rp is a very varied term. It's still a rpg. You don't have to play on a rp server to be playing a rpg.
---
What do you play? I'm pretty sure you play a character you identify with in some way.
---
If anyone gives you shit for playing a specific race, that person is not worth playing with. 
---
Go priest. WoW needs more priests.
---
Me and 3 friends at a lan party got 2 forrors books in 5 dm Runs, we had a good ammount of fun with that :D
---
Just find 6 other moonkins. They are used to that role
---
To add to the list:
---
Shaman needs ankh's to do the self res. 
---
Mages, Priests, paladins and druids all need mats to do the 60min(or for paladin 15min) buffs.
---
Druid needs mats to combat res. 
---
Rogue needs mats to vanish, blind and obviously poisons if that counts.
---
What is this image from?
---
UI?
---
I was just listing non vendor stuff but yes that would be the vendor reagents.
---
Full t1 hunter is ridicules for both pvp and pve. The set bonus is 15% damage to multishot.
---
Pretty much.  Very very few guilds have the luxury of refusing someone because of the race they picked.
---
&gt;Farming 500-800 gold for consumables so you can clear BWL is madness.
---
Wheres the 500-800g spent in BWL in that screenshot ?
---
Well it sounds to me like you already have all the answers.  Not sure what the point of your post is then.  I do remember in 2006 retail Vanilla, quests giving rep all 4 factions though.  More to the main faction of the quest and a smaller amount to the other 3.
---
meanwhile on alliance there's like 5 quests in hinterlands :(
---
Had a bunch of epics but when savory deviate delight finally dropped for me I was a happy man
---
As if "actual gear" doesn't exist in BRD?
---
I don't have experience with shaman, but for pally it's true only for raids.
---
I've had a pally that could tank/heal/dps any dungeon up to lvl 60. Is it optimal? Probably not. Fun and possible? Totally!
---
I already posted it 2 times, but I feel like i have to do it again. Me and 3 friends got 2 forrors books in 5 dm Runs. People hated us for it, but It brings up fun memories, seeing so many people say they farmed for ages for it :p
---
It‚Äôs funny how dramatic people are around here lol.
---
Because that's how it was in early patches before the paladin rework that made paladins the super power healers that they are in 1.12.
---
So when you go watch vanilla videos about paladins, most people call them buff bots.
---
Not sure where you got that idea from, but warrior is terrible at farming alone. No matter the content.
---
Zalgradis's pvp videos are unrealistic in today's game. If you are not okay with tanking, don't roll warrior. The deadzone isn't as big of an issue as you think; its an annoyance at worst. Rogues are a dime-a-dozen, however good rogues are rare. I think you should put more consideration into a healer. A healer brings a group of would be Wpvper's into the next level.
---
But you said in your post "I'll watch their stream to find out where they go so I can kill them again." Those were your exact words...
---
The shaman himself didn't even have a single thing keybinded.
---
Dps meter and Atlas loot will get you far
---
It¬¥s a marketing convention where they appraise their new products. And you can pay for the privilege to act as a scenery set.
---
Oh yeah. I main a warrior, and when I leveled my Shadow Priest, people see that Shadow Form and stay the fuck away. It‚Äôs a stark contrast to watching people go out of their way to gank me.
---
World PvP usually favors rogues because they can choose when to engage and a lot of times like this meme there is more than one.
---
All non cloth melee dps items - warrior rolls on them. In the end they have the largest pool to choose from, similar to paladins and heal gear. 
---
Now you go to an UBRS group and everyone is rolling on the TS shoulders, rends eyepatch and dals sword set
---
Realistically the con of the priest being a suboptimal pick probably isn't a major concern. A hardcore progression guild will shun you over a dwarf priest, but any other type should accept you - you are, after all, a priest which are always welcome as healers.
---
I think you'll find most casters have 1 particular spell they use more than not, and I'd look at it more so what you provide as that class. As you say, you'll bring a smile to those who need water, food and teleports.
---
As for the mounts, you might be able to get exalted with dwarfs/humans and if you really like sabres then you can grind for the winterspring mount, though a little warning, it's a loooong grind.
---
Well for me it was shadowflame staff from bwl.  In vanilla I played a lock and saved up all my dkp for it in vanilla and my guild never ever got one to drop.....feels bad. Fast forward a year or 2 ago I start raiding on a pservers. I'm playing a lock again join a guild. Turns out this guild didn't respect locks during MC phase, not a single lock ever got a bis piece all of it went to mages (lol).
---
 Anyways pretty much every lock left the guild with good reason I decided to stay because bwl was about to release and I know it would be hella easy to get my full T2 set and they promote me to class lead. About a month goes by and the staff finally drops now mind you I still hadn't gotten a single bis piece since I joined only tier pieces. 
---
After a long discussion with officer's they decide to give me that staff. I'm so happy I'm yelling with joy in my condo I can't believe I finally got it! So much satisfaction. A little bit after the raid I see the mage class lead say in officer chat "the mages aren't happy" I lol, our mages have gotten all prio on bis loot the entire duration of the guild. No other guilds on server treated their locks like this never giving them loot cause mages do more DMG.
---
 I only say one thing to guild chat before I log " You guys are complaining the FIRST lock in guild to get a bis piece while the rest of the mages are the best geared on server atm! Lol!" A few days later the mage who complained leaves the guild and brings a couple of his friends with him who were all great players. Go figure the guild ends up disbanding a month later cause good players aren't exactly easy to replace and new recruits can lower the moral for rest of raiders. But I got my staff waited too long for it, joined a couple other guilds and eventually got to clear and farm naxx for a bit. The thirst is still there can't wait for classic!
---
There‚Äôs a ton of info if you search this subreddit. I was able to find so much information on my class by looking around.
---
Druids of Darnassus on Cenarion Circle
---
In vanilla there weren't precise addons that did as in it took the average health of the mobs and gave a close approximate. We will see how classic does it with the new addon system as that's yet to be seen.
---
Ill keep that in mind, cheers!
---
I've made more friends playing on a classic pserver than I have in the last 10+ years of playing retail..
---
Dude, we had a druid offtank in BWL and AQ.  It's 100% doable.
---
Getting the population correct is a challenge. The problem is the first 2 weeks are probably going to be quick voluminous, then a drop off, then maybe a slow rise. Its a lot of factors to work with.
---
Then it clearly went over your head, it's okay.
---
Orc warrior - tank.
---
You'll be fine ranking slowly. especially when you hit r8 people will want you in WSG if you can flag carry and that will be some very easy honor.
---
Olaf‚Äôs All Purpose Shield. I loved having a way to cast slow fall on my warrior. I used it to jump into Un‚ÄôGoro Crater, and frequently in AB. It‚Äôs a fun item.
---
Such a cool looking weapon.
---
They're among the slowest of classes to level so that'll deter some of the worst.
---
Yeah honesty the cold war aspect makes it really cool. And while leveling our first characters when classic releases, there will only be a handful of people that rush to gank.
---
I'd think mage would give you that or you could go healer and heal for pvp. Priest is good for raid heals and to melt faces from what I remember in shadow form.
---
Thanks bro, I appreciate it!
---
I went into my first BWL with 2/8 Tier 2. I walked out with 8/8 and a that dragon-gun who's name I've forgotten.
---
That was a night.
---
well the people that claim he needs gear are just wrong. its one of the biggest lies, that somehow gets spread again and again, besides being factually very far from the truth. "ele shaman need aq gear to really shine" is kinda like "ud is best race for shadowpriest'". you instantly know the person writing that has 0 clue.
---
I really hope when classic starts it demolishes the numbers they had with BfA.  
---
And I hope more people stay to play than they have actually considered in their plans.  
---
this would satisfy my soul, especially because BfA is garbage.
---
Priest, on par with a pala for healing
---
Levelling with be a little more pleasant
---
Won't look like a gimp when you have to wear cloth (pala in cloth with offhand item lol)
---
Benediction
---
More AoE I think
---
...MC people off the ship in booty bay
---
I do that right now every day to build up something to draw from when the no life starts.
---
Im going to go either priest or shaman to heal in PvE, and respec to shadow or ele/enh for WPvP. Between the two classes in WPvP im not so much interested in which is better, but which is more Fun‚Ñ¢?
---
Wait already?? Jesus that felt quick
---
fuck that...too overcrowded with that many people.  I left that pserver because of that reason.
---
RIP wife and daughter and career
---
I never imagined I would see an avengers spoiler here..
---
and another idiot somehow spreading the lie that ele shaman is gear dependant. sigh
---
Try priest they have the best 5 man healing with prayer of healing and access to resurrection
---
Yes. But mages only have to have a split second to instant root you and blink away. Then it is gg unless you have multiple tools to get out of root or prevent root
---
Very likely, as this is part of the framework.
---
Not rare at all, but the carrot on a stick trinket is the most memorable item for me..
---
Who would hold the bucket when you have to poo then?
---
I was in a guild with a lot of competitive Hunters, who were very stingy with their DKP, so when it dropped, I plopped down 800 DKP on it, to the shock of the raid because it shattered the previous high bid by a few hundred points. Everyone was wondering quietly and aloud about how much of an overspend that was.
---
I was an officer, and submitted my bid quickly, and our Raid Leader who was handling the bids was verbally astonished at the bids he was seeing. So after he announced that I had won the Xbow for 800 dkp, he also let me personally know that it wasn't an overspend, because the 2nd highest bid was at 750, and a few were in that range as well.
---
So in the end, I got my Xbow, didn't overspend, and enjoyed the great damage it brought in raids, and the joy in killing squishies in PVP with it.
---
Private servers did not make those populations work.
---
And instead of explaining yourself, you insult me. Great post.
---
Rerolling takes ages, so people just stick with what they choose.
---
I'm pretty sure Moonkin is significantly worse than ret.
---
Wish they were viable because I loved my moonkin in vanilla... guess I'm rolling mage!
---
I do that every day already to build up some reserves.
---
I‚Äôve tried healing before (it‚Äôs how I leveled a shaman back in Wrath-era) but found myself generally focusing on the tank and not noticing when the group takes damage until it became a major issue (or they died)
---
The golden God!
---
Bow of searing arrows and Krol Blade
---
Uhhmm sorry what?

No one said paladin for DI or greater blessings
---
First time I‚Äôve seen this exact question.  It is not posted multiple times a day. The sky is not blue.  I am not excited for Classic.
---

---
Literally multiple times a day.
---
I know its been along time but I'm 99% sure in MC, shaman gear dropped on alliance side.
---
Anyone have a good resource on how impactful human sword racial is for pve? I've heard anywhere from 2%-10% of total dps. I want to go NE for Shadowmeld because it was one of my favorite abilities as a hunter, but if it's at the cost of a huge chunk of pve dps, it doesn't seem worth it.
---
Thanks for the feedback! About the nelf priest, yes, that's largely what I'm seeing as well, not much of an issue. Luckily I've found myself a casual guild too.
---
When you say get exhalted with dwarves do you mean pick up the mechanostrider at 40 and then work on that, or try to get exhalted via quests by 40/50 and have my first mount be the Ram? I was looking at StaySafe's guide on getting Exhalted with Darnassus by 40, but I haven't played Vanilla before and doubt my ability/desire to stick to that fairly strict levelling route.
---
That's why my Paladin will be a female Human. They look good in plate AND dresses.
---
Shoul shards, not stones.
---
Getting t2 helm on my pally was the best I got unfortunately it was like 2 months till bc and everyone stopped raiding shortly after that.
---
Bandages
---
I would do, along with all the trees, grass, etc if they implement that. I read that the main issue with new models in Classic is the fact that the animations are totally different, which may have some complexities when it comes to how the animations look to you, with new models toggled on vs to everyone else. Imo, they shouldn't kill themselves over this _to make the release_. I'd be perfectly fine with this being something that comes out down the line, maybe with one of the content patches.
---
Priests needed devout candles for group stamina buff if I remember correctly.
---
I got Boots of Avoidance to drop from Pirates in STV on my warrior. I briefly considered selling them, because they‚Äôre BiS for tanks, but I equipped them and wore them all the way to Molten Core.
---
Arcane missiles have some use in PVP however
---
Tauren prot warrior by far looks the best in the full tier 1 might set. In my opinion! Plus more stamina.
---
&gt;Warriors don't use any reagents but carrying around 2 sets of gear will mess up your inventory
---
Most hybrids carry at least 2 sets of gear with them. A druid carries much more.
---
I agree. But the issue might be server vs client side rendering of the animations, since they're different.
---
What I think they will do is increase the server limit at launch and use sharding on the starting zones because there is going to be a lot of people who are going to want to check the game out right away.
---
I think a good amount of these people will quit within a few weeks (probably not even make it to level 20) and the server population will drop. Thus, if blizzard starts us out around 4.5k server population, once the tourists come and try it out and move on the servers will drop down to a healthy 2500 population or so.
---
Yeah gl getting your raid into the zone with a world buff active
---
Thanks!
---
what addon for combat text ?
---
Don't forget twitter integration. It was very important.
---
There isn't even a release date man, you get yourself this excited already then the waits gonna be painful.
---
Druids destroy mages usually, and they are highly populated. Try 1/29/21 feral
---
8min cd
---
Streamer server will have the biggest dropps because they get the most tourists.
---
Rshaman.
---
Dude.. You are pulling dragons and horses out of your ass. How is a few toys more immersion breaking than that?
---
I'd say they need to add more of this kinda stuff to the retail game. It's nothing but the same end game stuff, with rarely any vanity stuff. Been playing a lot of FFXIV recently, and every patch you get pets, toys, hairstyles, emotes, and vanity outfits / gear to transmog into.
---
Rogue is definitely can't switch seamless between raid and pvp, although you use a good amount of the same gear you have to change specs to be not useless every time you switch. 
---
I'd recomend a mage, warlock or hunter. All of these can use the same gear and spec to PvE and PvP. Probably Hunter is the most useful in full PvE spec in my opinion. PvPing as marks is fine, I think BM is better but marks is almost as good. Warlock has different PvP specs but if you go SM/ruin you can pvp and pve with the same spec and gear. Mage is only really good if your PvE is a full frost, being arcane power PvE spec is pretty bad in PvP but you can still make it work. 
---
If you like healing PvPing as a healer in raid gear and spec is fine if you have a group with you. However, solo they can't do much.
---
How else would we use Bloodrage?
---
2 rogues is acceptable to me as long as they don't fight over their loot
---
I think its "Scrolling Combat Text"
---
Desk straps - check
---
2 week vacation - check
---
mom...toilet!
---
Every T3 set is really strong in both pve and pvp, but only Hunter wears 8/8 tier 1/2/3 because the set bonuses are all good.
---
I'm stuck between a priest or a druid as my alt. I plan to primarily heal with both, particularly in PvP, and am familiar with leveling both but I didn't heal much in PvP as I lvled or at end game. Both classes could give me fits on my rogue but is there anyone that lvled and pvped as both that can speak go the differences I'll notice?
---
Orb of Deception from a rare spawn outside of Diremaul,  still one of my favorite items
---
..And in the next scene you have Roberto Carlos legs and a pretty sulfuras shinning in your back
---
I have high hopes that private servers have a much higher population of assholes, because I have not seen a horde rogue that didn't try to kill me.
---
You also forgot the reagents for making portals/teleporting.. but those usually pay for themselves.
---
pFUI
---
I won a roll on a Krol Blade in UD Stratholme right before the Banshee boss. I was so stoked and I sold it on the AH for a good chunk of gold. The following week I got another Krol Blade off of Blue Dagonkin in Winterspring while farming Arcane Protection Potion Recipe.
---
Well a full resto druid spec shouldn't really be tanking anything without changing your talents and if your in a city to do that you can just store them in your bank. Prot warriors having a DPS set to do their best while they're not tanking is very useful, and fury warriors putting on a shield can still tank alright. Expecting a shaman to carry around a 2 hander without being specced into the skill to be able to equip it would be a little unnecessary.
---
Yeah if you wish to get another factions mount then you need to grind to exalted, which does require a specific path usually because of reputation loss when you're higher lvl doing lower lvl quests.
---
Personally I think it's a lot of effort to do all that for a different mount. You could ruin an amazing classic experience by travelling all over for faction-relevant quests, but that's up to you if value that mount a lot. At some point in classic I think you're able to turn in cloth for reputation for a faction, that could work but you'll be on that strider for awhile
---
Respecing gets super expensive fast. With shaman you can spec ‚Äúele-resto‚Äù which can heal in most raids / pve and be a damage healer hybrid in pvp.
---
You can get pally buffs on horde side
---
Yeah Oomkins are bad, but put one in a group with 4 Fire Mages and suddenly he‚Äôs a valuable raid member.
---
haha
---
Imagine you end up on a Method server. With the closed ecosystem you would never get your hands on a single flask, outdoorboss or epic pvp rank.
---
Everyone thinks Moonkins are useless, but put one in a group with 4 Fire Mages and suddenly he‚Äôs a valuable raid member.
---
Hunters if you're reading this, don't take spirit bond, this is probably in the top 10 of the worst talent in classic. 
---
Let's say you have around 1300hp when you get this talent (level 2) at level 32. That's a whopping 26 health every 10 seconds. That's 100% of your life every 500 seconds. If you're bad at math this might sound appealing, but unless you're multitasking and pulling multiple mobs at once and switching aggro between your pet and yourself, this talent will only benefit either you, or your pet and basically halves its healing.
---
If the healing is happening on your pet, well it's basically wasted, 5 seconds out of combat regen on your pet is worth at least ten times the amount of healing this talent brings. And lastly, the more dps you get the less damage the enemies deal to you, meaning picking offensive talents will always be better than picking this one talent (armor talent is good because it improves EHP and lowers downtime when killing stuff). This tament is just 2 wasted points.
---
its a twohand rogues could never use it
---
i managed to win chromatic carapace from Rend Blackhands dragon in ubrs. Its the most important ingredient to make an epic breastplatehttps://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Quest:Breastplate_of_the_Chromatic_Flight . I got harrassed from the other warrior because i didnt have the quest atm. But i could pick it up whenever i wanted.
---
The solution to the tourist problem is to charge for classic like any other xpac. The people who want to play will pay. Tourists won‚Äôt, or at least fewer will. This will lower the long term population because some tourists would get hooked and stay, but the added population stability would be with it.
---
It'll make it lower.  
---
You're taking every quick reaction and bundling it together with every slow one.  
---
Enjoy kick/counterspell/spellock/pummel on cooldown while being polymorphed.

It's almost as fun as being shot behind a wall in CoD.
---
Even installing it by CD's back in the days was kinda hype.. i remember just sitting there thinking how awesome it would be when it was ready to play! took its time though for sure
---
You sound like a pleasant person to be around. Shamans are an ally class.
---
I found the epic dagger Gut Ripper on an ogre in Feralas.  I remember being pretty miffed that it was level 40 instead of 39 so I couldn't really make any gold by selling it to a twink character lmao
---
Just get one of your friends to reserve the name for you.
---
Yeah, modern vanilla follows the simple rule of "what is actually best for the class", to which the answer is often all kinds of unintentional stuff. There is a reason why Blizzard had to implement the bonus to main stat for wearing full set of your "intended" armor class. In general, the more armor and weapon types available to a certain class, the more gear is available.
---
The worst is when people also start to count how "important" a class is. A warrior might honestly be seen as the right choice for a leather agility item instead of a feral druid purely because warriors are seen as more important.
---
Personally I think people make too make "rules" for loot. If someone is in the group or raid and a certain item is BiS for them, then they should have equal right to it as anyone else where it is BiS and higher right compared to people where it is not BiS. For weapon it makes sense to make a bit of rules so a warrior don't get a epic bow in front of the hunter and hunters don't get BiS swords in front of warriors and such - make a bit of a priority in regards to weapons in that regard.
---
I absolutely despise the word "toxic", and just how meaningless in every possible way it has become. 
---
But I also love that it exists, as to highlight the people who use it; so I can know **exactly** who to stay away from.
---
Mad at the try hard damage dealer, and the casual healer.  You‚Äôre a hard man to please.
---
Its all relative, as a Human Mage I found Warlocks and other Mages more or a challange and the odd Shaman that was any good.
---
I found Warlocks to be the hardest class to beat.
---
If someone makes an all moonkin guild I'll join it
---
I‚Äôm with you on team resilience,  healing got a little boring on my priest so I switched up to a paladin, teamed up with a warrior on 2v2‚Äôs.  It was sick testing skills with even matched team.  As a healer you couldn‚Äôt just sit and heal in the corner like most raids.  You had to survive, get some stuns and hits off, time your cooldowns. Helped you dust of the abilities you almost never used in raids.
---
Yeah, SL lock is the closest to unbeatable 1v1. I just have Rogue on there because Rogues will always suck to fight as a lock, and at certain gear levels (or any other warlock spec) they do have the advantage.
---
Great info, thanks!
---
üòÜ this is the quality content I sub here for
---
We can hope that server names will remain the same, so people will naturally stick to their original ones, so it might be reasonable to do some research beforehand Drak'thul was for example almost exclusively CZ/SK. But I don't think there were actually that many non-English realms in the end, and there will be even less with English profficiency in Europe being higher on avarage. My server was labout 1/4 CZ-SK, almost half was made up by Nordics, especially Swedes, but overall English language was still dominant in trade and lfg.

I got that thing on my pally. Also ZF is when I quit being ret lol.
---
Are Druid spells so mana-expensive or why are they so low on mana? Couldnt they use cloth setup? is there no shortcuts??! REEEH
---
Hunters 8/8 T1 is amazing.
---
This reminds me of the time I played a female human lock and an male undead lock on the same server, would pvp both sides, and people on the forums told me I had an "identity crisis."

---
Having no Tank dos not mean you run only cloth, and even if you want cloth pick up a SL he dos the job fine.
---
The only thing you need is a guy with Semi High hp and that can pull aggro away from the Healer.
---
I will be rolling paladin in classic.
---
How difficult would you say is paladin 5 man dungeon healing when you just hit 60 ?
---
Especially when you would have a holy/reck spec without the 5% crit.
---
My Paladin Main friend from vanilla said that would be very difficult, but we didnt have patch 1.12 and I was collecting t0 thinking that would be good when I hit 60 back then.
---
This is tbc :(
---
A feral druid should have:
---
- A tank set for tanking
---
- A dps set for dpsing
---
- A fire resistance set for tanking MC and BWL magic bosses
---
- A nature resistance gear for tanking in AQ
---
- An int gear for decursing (having MoTW means ferals are the best decursers)
---
- A heal gear for healing in encounters where you have enough damage dealers and tanks
---
A MotW/NS druid should have
---
A tank gear for tanking
---
A heal gear for healing
---
(And some pieces for cat form)
---
Both of these should be at hand because in 5mans you never know which you will do
---
I dont know how Blizz got it so wrong in TBC.  I joined a low pop server because I thought it would allow me to get ahead of the pack (total noob).  Worst decision ever.  Ended up quitting after 3 months.  Luckily I came back to the game 3 or 6 months later I think (memory is sketchy), only to reroll on a more populated server.  
---
My point is, I wonder how many new Classic players will bail if they end up on a low pop server and never come back.  It's very frustrating (no economy, no dungeons groups, no raids etc). 
---
Blizz has a chance to learn from previous mistakes and GET IT RIGHT this time. 
---
1) Only build high pop realms
---
2) Get Horde/Alliance balance right
---
Things like this is what makes the game a success for new folks and what will keep the game going in the years to come.  If Blizz doesnt care about stuff like this, then its a mission critical mistake IMO.  
---
And also, if mistakes are made, allow free realm transfers to correct this stuff instead of trying for a cash grab.  Is basic stuff.  Dont chase the short term gains.  **Think long-term here, YEARS**.
---
DPS warriors are black sheep. People don't bring them to 5mans based on principal. Also, why would a warrior tank let someone else take the plate gear?
---
If 5 mans are the main source of pve content, go Shaman. Much more desirable than Druid for 5 man content.
---
Yes. It‚Äôs one sub for both games.
---

The more I wait the more flaws I see in all classes and other things.  Lmao.

When would you recommend I do this?
---
How popular will paladins be in classic? They are like the most played class on live.
---
Also, I know on paladin I will be forced to heal a lot, but what are the scenarios when ret can do respectable damage? Is it good in PvP? 1v1s?
---
I have settled on horde warrior, my brother is rolling a priest so we can group etc... what race tho? Orc or Tauren?
---
Kreshis back and deadmans hand. I know dead man's hand was add in TBC still memorable.

---
I mean I need mana as a hunter, that's not my fault, that my abilities need mana.
---
As a hunter, you basically have actual need onto everything:
---
&gt;The first thing you need to know about playing hunter is you want to  be doing as much ranged damage as possible. So keep the following in  mind:  
---
&gt;1 Agility ¬† = 2 Ranged Attack Power  
---
&gt;53 Agility = 1% Critical Strike Chance  
---
&gt;You want to be getting as much agility as possible to increase your  damage and critical strike chance. Apart from agility the other main  stats you want to be thinking about are Stamina and Intellect.  
---
&gt;1 Stamina = 10 Hit Points  
---
&gt;1 Intellect = 15 Mana  
---
&gt;A simple way of looking at it is this: For PVP prioritise Stamina (to  stay alive for longer) and for PVE prioritise Intellect (to be able to  use more abilities before running out of mana for higher DPS).

All you need to do for classic is up the font size to 16 and you‚Äôre good.
---
Everything is without a question sharp enough to enjoy the game without issues.
---
The question is, how much is lots of gold?
---
it's called a troll, probably hunter at that too.
---
probably Orc for pvp focus/dps
---
Tauren for tanking
---
You sound like the kinda guy who has 8 different excuses lined up for whenever you die to explain how unfair the fight was and how you would total own them otherwise.
---
Fuck this is helpfull! Thanks a lot.
---
So in short (when looking at the best for MC) the average Palas are around 450 DPS and Warrys are around 1.800. So it is actually 1/4.
---
n00b
---
Do it before classic hits. Everyone will check if there retail account has some spare gold and will buy tokens. The price will go up big time once classic hits.
---
I remember seeing a shaman multiboxing on my server. Now this guy was going at it with 5 shamans and that was just a beast to fight with 4 others.
---
meirl, though it hasnt just been WoW thats done that for me.  Its always been easier for me to make friends online, and i have some damn close ones that ive met over the years on various games/forums.  Hell, ive met a fair number of them irl multiple times.

Nothing wrong with making friends doing the things you enjoy, even if there is still a  bit of a negative stigma about it with videogames.
---

[(8) Set : 10% chance after casting Arcane Missiles, Fireball, or Frostbolt that your next spell with a casting time under 10 seconds cast instantly.](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16914/netherwind-crown)
---
You could make disgusting shattercombos, or send a few pyroblasts someone's way if you were specced correctly
---
Constantly changing a spec is miserable, I would go with shaman so you can go ele resto and do both pretty good
---
Depends on the market and what you've got.
---
You can pay $15, sub for a month, then convert all your gold to tokens / bnet balance. Or if you've got the ~120,000 liquid, it'll cash that out and you can sub that way, then token the rest.
---
I've had luck in the past asking support nicely for a 3 day grace period to tokenize all my liquid gold. But depending on what you've got to sell, it'll likely take longer to sell, so my recommendation would be to pay 1 month sub a month prior to launch, and take your time liquidating retail inventory to pay for your classic.
---
Im ok with just eating the respec cost if I have to. Price of doing business as a healer.
---
I'm in the same boat. I can sleep whenever so I usually fancy late night releases.
---
I bet itll be morning release on a Tuesday after server resets.
---
If you get top 100 on your server for about 6 weeks, you'll have it. XD
---
To be honest I really loved nostalrius. 8k to 10k population. People everywhere. It felt like a living breathing mmo. Was really awesome to play support class like paladin or druid.
---
10k servers only worked because they were international. Imagine 10k players on the US east coast... Imagine 3k players all trying to raid MC at 7pm eastern, or trying to farm elemental fires in arathi. It would be a broken situation. Not to mention the fact that those private servers had increased spawn rates to deal with the over population. No.
---
Population caps of 5k are needed.
---
thats why you gotta spec hybrid.  hybrid tax means cats are not as good as rogues, bears are not as good as warriors, and moonkins arent mages and resto aint priest.  but being able to do all the roles at like 70% efficiency is the whole point of hybrid classes, and this is the appeal for some players.
---
how old school?
---
Depends on the stages and the server obviously, but what he's using is on servers with heavily increased herb spawns and increased spawn times (blasted lands buffs) and it's still not cheap. Everything is likely to be even more expensive when Classic launches.

Elixir of the mongoose, elixir of giants, mageblood potions, major mana potions, winterfall firewater, juju power, grilled squid, fire protection potion... he's not using Demonic/Dark Runes here, though he would be during progression...I can't see his *fourteen* hidden buffs, but I have to assume he's using R.O.I.D.S and Ground Scorpok Assay, either mana oil or sharpening stone...All of that is enough to carry through a BWL run if your guild is farming the place, isn't completely brain dead, and it doesn't cost 500g. Based on my last look at those prices, and only having to use 1 of everything (except mana potions, which feral chugs) it's just under 100g. Still expensive for what it is, but not 500g expensive... but that's assuming one straight clear, farm status BWL, not progression...and it's not counting the time investment for the stuff you can't buy...the most expensive part is the pummelers and runes. The time it takes to farm them is time you aren't getting those other consumables. If you aren't farming your own consumables, you're buying them. If you're buying them, you're farming something else or playing the AH, and spending hours a week grinding for a 20% drop is a lot of lost money. Same with the runes. Takes time, and time is money.
---
The amount of time it takes to get a bank full of crowd pummelers is ludicrous. You make a small amount of gold doing it, and you can sell the depleted items, but it's still a net loss.
---
As a druid you have to have all of that crap to be worthy of the spot. Die? Have fun reapplying 50-70g in buffs.

Late August

I am not but you are free to believe.
---
i am absolutely ready to play classic. i made up spreadsheets to keep my toons &amp; professions organized, my WoW notebook is prepped so i can take notes and keep record of progression throughout the game, recruited old friends and new ones to play, planned out play times, got a discord ready, and even made a massive list of foods i can make in an instapot so we can just throw mats in it and it cooks itself so we don't have to spend too much time in the kitchen but can still eat home cooked meals. bruh i am READY

I'm a little confused on what talents will look like on launch, i.e. will they be 1.0 or 1.12 trees? And how will this affect the leveling of certain classes, specifically Paladin which I believe received a lot of quality of life fixes in 1.12? I know that leveling a Paladin is practically a meme but is that still relevant after the 1.12 talent changes?
---
I'm gonna get a teebus blazing longsword this year I can feel it.
---
I dont consider a lot of my guildies friends, but theres definitely a few of them that are, and im fairly close to them.  
---
Beyond that i have plenty of friends that im not even in a guild with anymore than im still quite close to.
---
I also have an extremely close group of friends that i met on reddit that know more about me than anyone i know irl.  Despite being very different people, different backgrounds, etc, its always been a very close group (brought together by our love of beer).  Ive met up with those dudes 2-3 times, have shared hotel rooms with them, etc.  I absolutely consider them friends, and very close ones at that.

I've never seen a crit that big in classic before,

This seems like a bit of mental gymnastics to me.  One button rotation macros are too far and trivialize the gameplay, but other addons aren't.  Where do you draw the line?  When does an addon become as bad as a 1 button macro?  If the only reason you beat someone in a duel is because of an advantage you gained with an addon that they don't have, that doesn't make you more skilled than that person.  It makes you better geared, in a sense.  Except you're using gear that doesn't drop in the game that you had to download off a third party website.  
---
The entire purpose of addons is to make things easier in some way.  Whether it's to minimize overhealing, chain stunlocks together better, or otherwise.  Hence, if you are using addons, you have an easier time completing the same tasks than someone who isn't using them.  It's not that complicated.
---
Pretty sure the 1800 on warrior is skewed.
---
The moon has lost its brightness because Elaine gave its power to Tyrande! /s
---
Well be carefull as some of those look like they are dps'ing in healing gear. Might not be alot of data on Ret paladins.
---
I imagine a lot of people will roll paladins, realize they don't play anything like on retail, and quit or roll something else, especially if they try to play ret but get forced to heal anyway
---
Epic level 54 staff. Had int, spirit and resist on it. Don't remember the name. Got it off a devilsaur after I accidentally aggro'd it and a hunter helped me kill it. It was an epic event and I sold it for 600g and had enough for my epic mount before hitting 60 lol
---
If you're talking about that level of play every class should have every inventory slot filled with useful gear or consumes. If you are actually insane enough to think you need carry all that around all the time I hope you're having fun with the class and I'd really like to know how you're performance as a raid tank isn't crippled by having 0/5 threat talents and I'd really like to watch a video of those kills.
---
And it's very easy to know your role before joining a 5man. How else do you form the group? Invite random people and hope you get 1 healer and 1 tank? 
---
Again no disrespect, using an int set for decursing is very beneficial but without threat talents a druid wouldn't be tanking anything that is actually worth trying to do well, so keeping that set in your inventory instead of your bank is an obvious misuse of space.
---
My guild had open (out loud) bidding. Me and the other hunter must have loot checked at exactly the same time because 0.5 seconds later a very loud synchronous 'ALL IN' resounded over ventrilo...
---
Ensued the most breathtaking (and that's literally) 6 seconds while the raid leader checked our dkp. Even now, thinking back still makes my heart skip a beat... But that excitement afterwards.. Un-describeble...

I think you are confusing science with stupidity.

Keep concecrate rank 1 on bar the whole time

The one thing I don't want ia large pop mega servers

Tip, dont need bags at first. Make 2 bank alts. Use their banks and spots for inventory. Send and return by mail. Unlimited inventory.. And a good way to do auctionhouse of your main

##You have failed me, Executus!
---
Winning Vis'Kag the Bloodletter from Onyxia. The sword has a really low droprate and as a rogue it was a massive upgrade.
---
Together with that blade from Garr in MC i was suddenly top5 dps as a sword rogue.
---
Also remember a lot more people started to inspect me after that and looking on in jealousy \^\^
---
As a druid, just do WSG repeatedly. Form a regular group and you can be the flag runner. If you work 8-5, get home by 6 and pvp until 10pm on weekdays, maybe 6 hours of pvp on saturday and sunday, its very doable. You might even be able to go from rank 9 to 10 in a week or two playing this much depending on your server.
---
Why is it so hard to ban gold sellers?  I see some guy spamming gold selling in trade, I report, but it goes on for 30min.  How come that account doesnt get suspended immediately when like 3 people report him or something?
---
Nobody that takes classic seriously is gonna have a gf though
---
Hunter wep
---
Kinda different, but my original paladin i made was named "Fearless".  I ended up xferring it and my warlock off of my original realm in Cata.
---
I went back to that server in Legion and xferred my pally back (along with a warlock, though its the 3rd warlock ive mained over the years).  Unfortunately i couldnt get that name, which sucks because theres now a title 'the Fearless'.  I wish i could have been 'Fearless the Fearless' :(
---
I dont even think someones using the name.  It doesnt pop up on the armory, so i assume its a level 1 toon :(
---
Dang dude you nuked him.
---
Orb of Deception.  In retail BC I was farming that rare spawn outside of DM and got it.  
---
One time when I was leveling on one of the PServers recently, I had one drop from a random mob in Silithus too.
---
Hi, /u/Seyda-neen
---
That could work, but would i be able to do enough damage then. I mean prot has reck and well ret is ret.
---
Wouldn't make sense for them to make record income and layoff like 400 people lol.
---
If they release it close to september I'll be too busy in uni to properly get into it. I hope they give us june/july/august to play at least :(
---
TBC was great.  Bring it on.  But Im in no rush.  I hope WoW Classic lasts as is for years.
---
It's not that it is hard the fact that it still happens means that it is still profitable. This means they don't get cought enough to the point that it is unprofitable for them to have an account with a wow subscription just getting banned.
---
Warriors need the most consumables(generally speaking)
---
Pick a coin any coin
---
Yup, it's garbo, and the MC listed there has 1 ret paladin above 400 (424.3) - with the average being 320.
---
BWL has rets averaging 200 to warriors' 700
---
&gt;having to use Nightfall
---
Pallies have very limited on-use ablities, so they're even trash for that. A melee hunter can keep up Nightfall with endless wing clip spam and still likely out DPS the paladin.
---
TBC, with the exception of flying, was a true expansion on vanilla and that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm saying. I just think that EVENTUALLY after a few years that expansions in the mindset of how they did TBC, again with the exception of flying, would be great.
---
My first epic, Finkles Lava Dredger.
---
You made me check it and it's 6 min cd. We finally got it!
---
What are u talking about?? the game requires a sub. they havent released another payment method than a retail sub includes classic.
---
And how about the leveling the shaman? Is that so hard? I  know its hard to compare the lvling to druid but some lvling advise also welcomed for meüòÄ and some tips in raids. I heard shamans and druids were nit the best maybe shaman was the worst in hps but lot of utility provided by shamans and maybe was not too boring?
---
Impressively state-of-the-art in-breeding simulation they had back in 2004.
---
Or go alliance and go Pally because Stormwind&gt;Orgrimmar
---
One of the big advantages of sorting out a raid guild before or during launch is that you'll have tailors in the guild willing to craft you bags as long as you provide the mats.
---
omg gnomes
---
Thanks all for the great feedback. I should have specified we are going the PVE route. 
---
After getting to SOC, how would you round out the talents for this build?
---
I guess this is how to climb the dmg meter..
---
#moonfire
---
they are so expensive but so fun to have, i'm getting 2 of them on my druid at some point for sure. Will probably take me a long time though, gotta prioritize the epic mount first.
---
As a Tauren hunter, I solo'ed the drakes on the horde quest chain.
---
Shaman, Ele/Resto. Pick 31/20 or 30/21 and hide the fact you arent full resto in raids.
---
Im always so 50/50 on those quests because theyre low droprate for a reason.. they want you to get some grind xp. So if you luck out and get it early youre gonna fall a little behind :(
---
Apparently this theory crafting was done back in Vanilla, it was just not well known.
---
I see plenty of mages not let themselves go below 40% mana. Also who levels ambush? Also it may work once but not twice if the mage is not an idiot
---
Gnome warlock then.
---
For what it looks like you got most of the necessitys in arms tree. Although in prot you don't need "iron will" for tanking dungeons nor anticipation, place that in defiance and thougness instead since 10% armor bonus is way better than 1dodge parry and block.
---
You can take of 2 in cruelty and place in shield spez and 1 in imp block, my recommendation, since there are a few bosses that hit harder so you can swap to shield if needed.
---
PvP wise it's bad premade wise, soloing its ok leeching spec
---
This does not sound casual. üòÅ
---
Are there any classes that are solid healers and can also Respec to do respectable damage?
---
Ok man, I'll let u stay insecure about ur manliness that you won't play a female video game character
---
Well first of all mortal strike in raids is a big no-no because it takes up a debuff slot and without mortal strike theres really no point going arms tbh. As for pvp, your build could work but obviously isn't as optimal as cookie-cutter builds.
---
This is a very good advise! Ty :)
---
And getting 10-12 Slots bags early shouldn¬¥t be toooooooo hard by Level 30-40. And that should be enough for your everyday filling up of bags with trash to sell to the vendor.
---
Paladins being able to use staves.
---
- I can swing a long stick with a heavy bit at the end
---
- I can swing a long stick with a sharp heavy bit at the end
---
- I can swing a long sharp stick
---
- But I cannot swing a stick?
---
The fuck?
---
I just want it for leveling cause staves are OP damage.
---
its 8
---
In WoD we had the option to use old and new models. They didn‚Äôt do the skin wrap till they did new animations for classes.
---
day 1 old school :)
---
I remember getting a small green pouch in my starting zone one time and it was like the greatest thing lol. Hopefully I will have good luck again this time
---
 OOMkin
---
My thought exactly. Unless it's like "anger management" for warriors were the tooltip don't say everything, this is one of the most useless talent ever.
---
The weapon speed and debuff proc were pretty ass, not gonna lie.  All in all it was a terrible weapon.
---
But it was rare, purple, and I had my heart set on it.
---
yes... watching to find out where they are isn't the fun part. once you kill them and watch them bitch and moan is. there is a little fun in watching to find out where they are, but thats due to the anticipation of trying to kill them.
---
Remember when that Chinese site had posted the updated talent trees and there was the new Moonkin form icon and people were speculating what it could be and if it was even real or not.  Then 1.8 hit and the Oomkin was born!
---
Yes, seeing that some actually reach 500, 600 one even 800 and that the Top 30 Hunters and Warlocks also start at around 800 makes it not too bad.
---
But comparing it to Warry, Rouge and Mage is a different thing, of course.
---
Again thanks! Not changed my mind but seeing the real (P-Server) numbers helps a lot.
---
(Played a Warry from actual vanilla till BfA and need a change now. And beeing to good at everything makes it actually boring for me)
---
Find a guild pre-launch.
---
thanks for the link!
---
I said that in the last sentence.
---
Yeah you more than deserved it. Illusionary Rod? That meant you didn't get an upgrade from lvl teen something to your 50's? Heck of an upgrade! Grats!
---
Chromatic Carapace from Gyth in Ubrs.
---
Then farming up all of the materials, including all of the blood of heroes. To get the Leggaurds of the Chromatic Defier.
---
My Raid Leader in vanilla was a ret paladin and he best described playing the spec as DHS.
---
Damage Happens Sometimes.
---
I can‚Äôt decide between Warlock or Druid
---
Current factors swaying my decision-
---
Class fantasy: awesome for both but have experienced on warlock before Druid would be new. 
---
Role: I enjoy healing but hate melee combat. Warlock would be more fun to level and solo with for me but Druid more fun for groups. Is balance at all ok for farming if not levelling? No interest in any other healing class. Don‚Äôt want to tank. 
---
Limited play time: which would be quicker to level/easier to gear/easier to get groups with while levelling or at 60?
---
Needing to respec- lock seems to have build that is considered fine for pvp/pave/farming. Is there any spec for Druid that would really be fine to use for healing as well as for solo play?
---
Related question. I stopped playing in wrath, and probably had a good bit of gold back then. But this was years ago and I don't remember how much I had. How much inflation has happened since then? Is it even worth checking if I have any value there?
---
&gt;I'd really like to know how your performance as a raid tank isn't crippled by having 0/5 threat talents
---
Who told you i have 0/5 in that? (It's false) What makes you think that an offtank, especially a bear, has to max out on threat talents? They really dont. 
---
If you go in with full PVE tank/heal/dps/xxx spec you are obviously better at that role than with other specs. But few people do that, because respeccing just so you can farm stuff, be effective in 5mans etc. is a chore.
---
Besides, the whole point of being a true hybrid is the ability to fill whatever role the raid requires, for that very pull. I've been doing raids where I was a healer mainly but switched gear and went with tanking where we needed another tank or went to cat form where we clearly had enough healers.
---
&gt;And it's very easy to know your role before joining a 5man. How else do you form the group? Invite random people and hope you get 1 healer and 1 tank?
---
You are farming scourgestones in EPL in your dps set. You see a popup, people are looking for a healer for Strat. Do you get back to the bank, switch gear, then head there? How about when you enter a small scale pvp fight? Do you switch to your heal gear or keep using the one with 2500 mana and go out of mana after 3 casts?
---
As I said. You do not need to have all that on you all the time. But you will likely fill 1-2 bags with gear if you dont want to constantly go back to the bank and play mix-and-match.
---
Utility shamans provide is amazing and you definitly want them.
---
Leveling is pretty hard. You can go enhance and swing a 2 hander and use windfury or use a fast weapon like a dagger and a shield and use flametongue. 
---
For a new player I'd recomend the dagger and shield, it doesn't do much damage but it never dies and if you keep your mana high you can live through your mistakes. It's slow and safe like a turtle.
---
[If you have a spare 20min you should watch this video.](https://youtu.be/lzhn4wsXF40) It's the most accurate shaman guide I've seen and I watch a ton of vanilla content to look for different perspectives.
---
GLHF
---
ok now im confused, if i do it in client its an 8 min cd, but now i double checked on the database and it says 6 min. im confused.
---
i am 100% for addons. i started using them in BC and haven't looked back. my custom ui set up has been honed over literal years of gameplay and i am very much going to be using it in classic. my husband plays totally addon free (and has been since vanilla) and wouldn't have it any other way.
---
There's a lot of factors that go into someone's DPS, especially in Naxx where some encounters cater more to melee, some to casters... and even luck can play a large role.  Parses like that don't really tell the whole story either, my reason for linking was just to show that the numbers are better than "god awful".  
---
That doesn't mean I think they're great, because the effort involved is very high.  That same amount of work put into a rogue or warrior would put him near the top of the chart, but still hanging around middle of the pack as a feral is good enough that someone putting in that much work is not a detriment to the raid.
---
FOUND THE HUNTER! \^
---
You mean, as opposed to your manliness, which is apparently so fragile you cannot even look at a low-poly model of a male in an MMORPG without feeling threatened about your sexual orientation?
---
Ofc grinding the pummelers takes quite a bit of time. But thats what a feral does. Everything else in there you see on most melee do just to compete. Its definitely not for everyone, but if you compare that to example R14 grind, is it that different ? Atleast on pummelers you can do it when you like and can take a break if you want to.
---
The internal cd was changed in BC. however the proc of proc was changed in vanilla.
---
I usually farm the rare in Westfall to get several 10 slot bags at first. That can last you a while until you get better ones imo. There also some quests giving bigger bags.
---
Thanks for the info! this is awesome
---
You never found Chen's Empy Keg in the Barrens?
---
Nothing really, I was kind of a noob in Vanilla - I was in a very small non-raiding guild, and I got the 2H rare quality sword from the Tribute chest, which was pretty fun since there was a sense of teamwork &amp; accomplishment from playing with friends.
---
It's been a treat to be able to experience most of the vanilla content on pservers, since I wasn't able to do all of those things back in the day...
---
This is the main reason i am hesistating rolling alliance haha
---
You shouldn't need them as a druid. Druids are already the kings of kiting. Yes, they're better than hunters at it.
---
The staff is from ZG trash... Its boe and looks like tbc loot idd
---
this meme is not true. Hunters dont get aggresiv they just casualy auto need anything because they know it is for them. More like a spoiled teen girl.
---
Dude is this how much time it takes to unlock purple pvp gear? I mean I'm here for it but I underestimated how much pot and red bull was going to be required
---
A lot of raid guilds will flat-out ban Mortal Strike because it reduces the amount of debuffs the raid can use from 16 to 15.
---
Some of the more casual guilds may not care.
---
That said, I don't think split specs are really worth it. As long as you have a set of pre-raid BIS tank gear, you should be able to tank in any spec.
---
inb4 private server reee, but I used to offtank stuff like Drakkisith, Garr's adds and Majordomo after teleports in a full fury spec and a fairly questionable set of tank gear. The only thing I was iffy on tanking was actually Wyrmthalak. That guy chunks.
---
I remember having a twink boomkin at 49 and it was a lotta fun blasting people down with wrath but definitely went oom quite a bit.
---
sp
---
Hell yes. Shaman #1, Shadow Priest #2. Both will have mana problems though
---
I have honestly only really played Alliance because I think horde cities are just terrible (besides TB). That being said... I have this strange urge to play Shaman. I haven't really ever been drawn to healing, but I just can't shake this feeling like I want to play a resto Shaman. Am I crazy? Are they a mediocre healing spec? Can I play a Tauren shaman and enjoy lvl 60 or is it orc or bust?
---
I got a Felstriker way back when, that was kinda cool. Never really saw many epic drops off of dungeons.
---
Mail fees are small, but they can really add up when you are mailing everything to bank alts.
---
yeah...
---
It will probably go off around midnight Eastern time, or a couple hours before. Which means all the hardcores will play through the night and into the next day.
---
I once leveled a mage to 60 on a private server without finding an upgrade for Crescent Staff. Quest reward from a Wailing Caverns-quest. :D
---
Ugh, remember it‚Äôs classic and dps isn‚Äôt why every class is brought to a raid. Paladins have so much utility and even a ret paladin has blessings, bubbles and judgements to help the raid. Rogues and warrior will always top meters but they bring nothing to a raid but damage, that‚Äôs their job.
---
Ret paladins are fine in raids, it‚Äôs not all about dps numbers!
---
BY FIRE BE PURGED!
---
My guess is that the comrade obviously is cl and grabbed Neltharion tear to himself.
---
Carma is a b\*tch \*cough\*
---
On retail vanilla back in the day, getting a single 6 slot bag in the stating zone was basically your first epic world drop. 
---
On private servers I frequently leave the stating areas with more 6 slot bags than I can even use.
---
Drugs are bad
---
Windfury is great but freedom is probably better. Freedom solves the warriors number one issue, impairment.
---
It's pretty good if you're into min maxing and actually HAVE a sword(s).  I'm not sure it's too healthy to worry about it though unless you're that hardcore of a min maxer and pushing content faster than most guilds.
---
drus arent strong pvp healers as far as output, they rely alot on avoiding damage, priest prob funner ngl, but dru has higher skillcap imo
---
raptor strike does adds flat dmg, its technically better spent on a dagger. The 2H is better for pvp for getting into melee, getting a 1k melee crit on cloth, and then backing out. Although a hunter with DW can spam hamstring and basically silence a caster.
---
Your stupid for saying that a agi and crit chance mail chest piece is hunter gear.
---
Once bgs are in game; (what I did back in Vanilla) 
---
Rank 5 can be achieved, simply by doing some battlegrounds at every level ending with a 9.
---
Rank 7 10bgs per week and joining in on wpvp you happen to pass by should be enough
---
Rank 10 actually requires some commitment, with limited time this means pvp will now become your biggest time consumption
---
Rank 11 and 12 each time require double the effort of the previous rank. This is where it escalates quickly.
---
13 and 14 are above and beyond. Here you simply have limited slots. So now it not only depends on your effort but also on the effort made by your competitors. As soon as there is decent competition and you have a full time job, 13 is not a guarantee even if you put all your available time in wow, and all your wow time in pvp. 
---
Rank 14 is a 100 hour per week investment and even then some other dude might beat you, since rank 14 follows highlander rules.
---
its vanilla, you cant afford it trust me
---
A mage without any of the buffs :).
---
On their own they can compete with spriest, but it's not like that's saying much.
---
My little 12 year old heart was broken when I realised moonkins sucked at 60.
---
For dungeons you'll be fine. I'm not trying to sound unhelpful but for 5 mans 99% of tanking is your approach\skillset\your group. If you run full prot in UBRS, don't know your threat priority rotation, and run with 5 rogues opening with cheap shot - you're gonna have a bad time. 15 points in prot is plenty of threat to allow you to be successful - but you should definitely get comfortable with tanking beforehand. 
---
BRD is a really good test, because it is not "hard" in terms of mitigation - you can tank it in greens. It throws a lot at you though - AOE threat, netting mobs, disarms, if you can survive BRD at 55+, you'll be good with end game dungeons as 31/5/15.
---
As other posters have indicated, your biggest issue in raids is mortal strike. The debuff is a rather large negative, and your problem is less "You can't tank" and more "You're a bad dps". Even if you're off tanking 100% of fights and never DPSing, you could be a liability depending on your guild's perspective.
---
PVP wise it's good enough. You obviously lose some utility but you won't be 100% dead weight.
---
I think 31\5\15 is a great spec for the first few weeks at 60 and will let you get your pre-raid BiS for dps *and* tanking potentially, but if you want to raid to get gear you might need to just suck it up and go full fury.
---
Are you sure? Because I just searched through every patch note in TBC didn't find any reference to this.
---
Vivalafry.....this is a phenomenal idea. I hadnt thought about that at all. Might do this and then just take 10-15 mins when I'm done to vendor/AH what I've looted.
---
Still can‚Äôt decide between priest and druid. Priest is cool because of the benediction quest line and diversity of their heals, but druids look more fun comparatively in pvp and i‚Äôm not sure how much not having a rez in a 5man will hinder me. hard decisions
---
This is a cool idea. However, as a flag carrier, natures swiftness is an absolute necessity in my opinion. With how long games run, you will use it at least twice every time you have the flag to save your life.  It's just too important to not pick up.
---
blizzard made mistake but its also the gamer culture's fault to blame for current wow. Classic wow was a challenge and not really a casual thing. Dungeons took time. progress required effort. But now gamers wanted everything to be easy and quick. people didn't want to be social so they got LFG and LFR. blizzard gave them the game most of them **thought** they wanted.
---
Having a Mana pool capable of lasting more then 20 seconds in combat is the main advantage.
---
Therein lies my dilemma. I suppose narrowing it down to those 2 helps atleast. I'll wait and see.what classes the folks I run with choose. The opportunity for some rogue/druid PvP is super enticing.
---
Paladins wear plate in PvP. Cloth in PvE. Unfortunately, vanilla itemization is retarded.
---
Question was for PvE specifically and I don't think you can go wrong with either, but for healing groups in instances I find priest a lot of fun because of the number of different spells you have for healing, plus an AoE heal, plus fade to dump aggro.
---
mage for travel
---
do it my guy. you can play any race/class combo in the game. it only matters if you‚Äôre min/maxing
---
yes, this is good further on, but initially will be tough as they still need to get to 225 for mageweave bags.
---
Very interesting. Do you buy your mats at that point?
---
Why worry about it at that point?
---
So not so much achievements, but the 'statistics' tab in the achievements frame.
---
&gt;not bad
---
that pretty much sums up Druid's worth compared to most other classes.
---
You dont need utility if bosses die before they can do anything dangerous
---
Naughty secrets!
---
Your first sentence is obviously correct. But hardly relevant as we can very well compare a feral DPS to warrior DPS and rogue DPS.
---
Agree to disagree. To me, your numbers illustrate the contrary of what you are trying to show. And "record breaking" is misleading to say the least.
---
I also did not just check Naxx. The dps was all and throughout *mediocre*. Even holy priests can sustain 300 dps with low spell dmg. It's the bottom of the barrel.
---
remember in classic you can only mail one piece at a time. That is going to take a long time and the cost will add up. Also join a guild ask a guild member to make you some for the mats. everyone gets cloth while leveling

I respect your opinion but I think you need a little more experience to really stand behind these points you're making. In a small pvp brawl just switching on healer gear isn't going to give you any more mana because you won't have time to drink. And in that example going to undercity when your in EPL really isn't that big of a timesink.
---
Druid is an extremely flexable class but trying to spec to do everything limits its potential greatly and effectively nukes the usefulness of the class. Most people played druid like this back in real vanilla and that along with being untuned really cemented the stigma against them being good. We know now that that stigma was false, but unfortunitly yes, you do need to use your talent points. Threat is the most important factor in raid tanking and it will absolutely not be possible to feral tank without 5/5 Feral Instinct. 
---
You have control over the groups that you join. If you are Feral spec and a group doesn't need a tank you are not forced to join that group by any means and it's probably easier to find another healer and make a group yourself than to attempt to heal that group. Switching gear can be very useful but kitty dps without Furor and other required talents is just gunna be so garbage it really doesn't matter if you spam wrath instead, if the fight actually demanded dps you would need to respec or switch out a healer for a dps. Vanilla isn't very hard so that probably will never be necessary. Either way a resto druid dpsing isn't a solution to any problems.
---
You must be nuts to give up a life saving cd such as NS as a FC. There's no way any serious FC will ever be casting wrath or doing significant amounts of damage in general, and the rest of the heals he'll be doing will be instant hots with a regrowth at most.   
---
You're wasting 21 points and NS to get a tiny bit of damage, that if you use it, ooms you faster than you otherwise would, therein helps you die faster. Shapeshifting ain't cheap.
---
Thanks, title had me confused like I was remembering incorrectly.
---
Hunter t2 8/8 was so good it only got beat by t3 because of the low amount of hunters in the raid (4 hunters or more provided enough uptime to make t2&gt;t3). T2.5 was a niche and only good for 2 weeks during the tbc talent/skill update at the end of vanilla.
---
At early stage of the server, hunter is in good shape, because ur pet is huge chunk of ur dmg, on Onyxia BM hunters are top dps. In dungs, mostly mobs come in group of 3, many classes have to dps single target while u can multishot + fd. In comparision with rogue u also bring utility, traps + ability to ot with pet. Mages have to drink a lot between pulls, so if ur tank goes fast, u can actually out damage mage, depends how much aoeable the dung is + u  are very needed in UBRS.
---
I played the meme nelf priest. I'm thinking of going dwarf priest (maybe that changes daily) and just stocking up on Savory Deviate Delight so I can deal with my hatred of the character model. The racials on a dwarf are disgustingly OP.
---
Why is he valued in that scenario?

Yeah but why not automate the suspension (say for 24 hours), then have a human look at the logs to see WTF is going on?
---
Suspend first, ask questions later.
---
Leveling and PvE is logistics. PvP is also logistics, but has an incredibly high and unintended skill cap.
---
Back in Vanilla D3, my friends and I would do 10 pushups, 10 situps, or 10 squats every time we died or got a legendary drop.
---
They really have to drop the release date soon, I want to be able to schedule vacation days from work.
---
# SOME FOLKS ARE BORN
---
# SILVER SPOON IN HAND
---
Oh yes sorry should have stated that, was talking about pvp.
---
It will be 1.12, but even with 1.12 talents pally leveling is pretty much just autoattacking.
---
I'm ready for Rnjesus to decide my fate
---
As far as for solo play, I recently saw a video of someone aoe farming with a druid (as resto) 
---
Moonfire/insect swarm 4-5 mobs, barkskin, hurricane. Seemed pretty viable.
---
As for leveling and grouping, druid is really good. No downtime during leveling and cat form/travel form reduce travel times. 
---
If you're feral you can tank or dps in dungeons and even heal with a healing set. I know you say no tanking but you'll change your mind when there's no tanks around to do the instance you wanted.
---
Meleeing as a hunter for extra dps.
---
I've been planning a paladin this whole time and just realized the friends I'll be playing with will almost certainly go horde. Feelsbadman

---
You are correct. I was talking out my ass. There was a hidden 3 sec cooldown added at some point. It is however not mentioned in any patchnotes whatsoever.
---
That's pretty darn big. Even tanks in naxx gear were like 9-10k so you figure that there was no way anyone in their raid would survive that sucker.
---
a wow token went for like 117k on the server i used to play on.
---
Shadow priest was one of the Warlords on my vanilla server back in the day. He used to destroy us Alliance every day in Alterac Valley.
---
In my experience there tends to be 1 or 2 people bee-lining Tailoring. Usually Priests. I assume that they make a lot from the AH for being one of the first people on the server with bags.
---

---
It sucks, not denying it. But, get full points in improved wing clip, and practice dueling and using scattershot/feign death/trap to where you can pull it off without thinking and you'll be fine. The cooldowns on those are not bad. Run with track humanoids on and zoom out as far as you can. You'll get sat on frequently, but you'll also get the jump on people frequently and tear people new assholes.
---
it bugs me they roll on felstriker. last server i played i had 2 dropped. won the first and lost the second to a warrior who wanted it for tanking. as i was playing a rogue this wouldve been the key dualwielding FS and being able to SoF before AQ equipment.
---
Haha. That's for rank 10. The purple gear is ranks 12, 13, and 14.
---
Oh.  Same icon as deterrance, was wondering what the hell that chart meant.  Great post amigo.
---
If you have spare cloth you might be able to get a cheap bag from someone lvling their tailoring.
---
Yea that‚Äôs the general vibe I‚Äôm getting. Main worry is that if I stick to only PvP pre raid will only carry you so far and unless you get rank 14 your just suck in the blue set which isn‚Äôt even out on launch I believe.  Hopefully I find a guild that can both clear content and doesn‚Äôt mind an Arms warrior in raid xD.
---
now u get it üòé
---
It up on spotify yet? :D Cant get to this website from work
---
He is so noob that I wouldn't surprised there was shift option for auto looting
---
Thank you very much for this really great presentation of the most interessant class in vanilla in my opinion. 
---
I have nothing to add, I‚Äôm a noob about this class but if I decide to finally play classic, druid will be for sure my first roll! 
---
Only think I can maybe say about the ¬´¬†Druid can do everything¬†¬ª is that as all generalist in our ¬´¬†specified¬†¬ª world, maybe Druid can do all role but won‚Äôt be as efficient as other class for each role. Good warrior will always be a better tank, good priest / pala / sham will always be a better raid healer and DPS class will always outdps ferals.. 
---
so yeah basically I would say that Druids are good for everything but optimal for nothing except FC / dual
---
You probably do not have much. 20k for the Mammoth was a lot back then. Tokens are 115k
---
You played Horde, Scarlet Monastery is literally just around the corner. Did you just never go into SM Lib?
---
when you say quite a bit of gold in Wrath, what do you mean?  
---
Back in Wrath, stuff wasnt that expensive.  I think I had about 60-70k gold on my bank alt, which I considered a lot back then. I could get mats for raids easily either farming or AH.  
---
But folk have hundreds of thousands of gold in tBA.  1 token (bought for real cash), sells for upwards of 150-200K gold on AH.
---
&gt; Ofc grinding the pummelers takes quite a bit of time. But thats what a feral does.
---
Right. That's the whole point of what I'm saying.
---
&gt; Everything else in there you see on most melee do just to compete.
---
Except most melee do significantly more damage at the higher end, and have an easy rotation.
---
&gt; Its definitely not for everyone, but if you compare that to example R14 grind, is it that different?
---
Well it's easier than the R14 grind, they don't even compare, but again, that's not really the point.
---
The point is, no matter how much effort you put into it, a skilled kitty druid will never be as powerful as a skilled rogue or warrior of comparable gear level, and the effort required remains much higher.
---
The point of the post was the question 
---
&gt; As I see in many posts a lot of people hates the feral druids in PvE content as Damage Dealer. Why?
---
and it's because having to do all the same farming for consumables as all the other classes, they also have to farm a weapon, they have to perform a much more difficult rotation, and they still don't come close to rogues or warriors at the top end...they're also harder to gear up because their required gear comes in later tiers and doesn't have decent alternatives. On top of all that, they're worthless on resistance fights. Because they're so gear dependent, as soon as the FR/NR gear goes on, they pull slightly more damage than the tanks.
---
It's not a terrible idea to have them, it's just important that people have all the information. They have a decent buff for melee, they can still battle rez, and they can pop bear and do some off tanking *if* required...but they will never be the best against similarly skilled/geared players, and they require tons more work.
---
It‚Äôs gonna sound like a meme, but I honestly think the most memorable piece of gear I got from Vanilla was grey shoulder pads while questing in Westfall (I think). I raided too, and epics felt awesome, but no specific gear stands out.

Having been torn between mage &amp; rogue, I think I've finally settled on rogue. I have mained mage since TBC and played a little in vanilla as a complete noob, so feel as though the change would be more enjoyable. 
---
My issue is, although I am not going to be hardcore, I am going to be playing a considerable amount and would like to raid with a good guild. Would I struggle to find a raid spot as a rogue? Would being a mage open more avenues for me? Also, I plan on rolling dwarf rogue - does missing out on that sweet sword specialisation human racial hinder my chances of getting a spot?
---
Play WoW all day for 3-4 months straight. If you are behind, sleep less. Its not worth it.
---
Thanks Josh!
---
Been looking forward to this one for a while now, Kevin is a star and we‚Äôre so happy to hear him as frequently as we have.
---
Keep up the amazing work, onwards to episode 200!
---
Maybe you'll even have fun one day
---
In that case I might go the standard PvP build (31/20/0) and hope to find a guild that‚Äôs casual enough to let an Arms warrior in but competitive enough to down context xD
---
Hey Booshies, not just yet, for some reason Spotify can take up to an hour to update after I upload.  Check iTunes for now, otherwise it will be everywhere pretty soon.  Cheers!
---
God I fuckin hope my dude
---
Midnight I guess? Regardless of when it is, I'm unlikely to be able to hop on right at launch unless the date magically aligns with my July bachelor week. So a midnight release would give the maximum amount of time to everyone else before I log in and hopefully the starting zone is a little less crazy at that point.
---
This is why you always kill any rogue you find
---
leveling isnt hard at all, just takes a little longer than pure DPS classes like hunters/rogues/mages. 
---
I'm planning on levelling as a ele, and have some healing gear in my backpack as its easy be able to heal 5 mans as you level even as ele.  At 57 I'm respeccing Full Resto and will instance my way to 60., trying to get BiS from Scholo/Strath/UBRS etc.
---
the 3% crit bonus is immense in a AQ raid where the moonkin is in the group of the mage who is chosen to be the ignite specc
---
you duo it with a healer. you DE all the boss drops under 5g, mine the two rich thorium veins, herb the handful of herbs that are on your path, and tally up any other BoEs/Books that drop before splitting the gold it is all worth. it makes a solid chunk of change especially early on when certain class books are in high demand
---
Die insect!
---
I mean, it depends on your timeline. Now that we know about the waves, you literally can't even rank until phase 2.
---
So for phase 1, your goals should be roughly, IMO: Hit 60, find a guild\build up community\friends, farm pre-bis.
---
You can honestly do that in any spec - you're really not going to be doing much of any useful PVP whether you're 31/5/15, or 0/0/0. 
---
Once ranking comes out, Phase 2 is going to be anything but skill based. As a warrior trying to rank in world PVP, you're going to need friends. I can't prove this, but I would argue that if you find a good guild, they really aren't going to care about the X in your 31/x/x spec for world PVP of all things. As long as you can apply MS, and are fun to play with, that will get you further than anything in wPVP.
---
You really can tank anything as any spec though, so I'd just consider having an open mind on your goals. Your spec is just a way to achieve your goals, but if 31/5/15 gets in the way, i could see you getting through phase 1\2 as DW fury just fine.
---
[Dazzling Longsword](http://classicdb.ch/?item=869) on my Warrior. Was tanking Scarlet Monastery Cathedral and it dropped from Mograine. I was so excited the rest of the team told me to go ahead and take it. I don‚Äôt even care how good or bad it was; I used that thing until I hit 50, at least. I think it‚Äôs still in my bank.
---
It's a tough choice.
---
Obviously, DWARF is the master race, and has great animations for both guns and bows, plus stoneform is ridiculously good for pvp.
---
Night elves, however, has shadow meld, to prey for horde scum in open world or bg's. Surprise them, kill them before they even realize what's going on. Plus they have fancy flips. However, it comes with a price. They are only satisfying with bows, playing a night elf with gun or crossbow makes me want to neck myself. 
---
It's up to you in the end.
---
Spell crit aura
---
Hurray for more Kevin Jordan class interviews.  Thanks for your work on these.  
---
What is the typical turnaround for the podcast to hit YouTube?  It‚Äôs the only option at work, unfortunately (and oddly).
---
I feel you, I'm excited about maining lock, but somewhat disappointed that I won't get a chance to give paladin a try this time around, even as an alt or anything, since the homies are 100% on rolling horde.
---
I remember equal spots for rogues and mages. Remember, most raids will be 40 man. There should be plenty of space for pure damage dealers. You will be needed.
---
Most likely yes. Replacing character models was bannable back in the day(like replacing druid travel form to look cooler or worse making flags in wsg huge)
---
Think he's referring to the spell crit buff from moonkin form for the 4 mages maybe.
---
If you are dedicated and plan to r13-14. The "bigger" guilds might let you stick full PvP specc if your ranking doesn't take to long, since the gear from r13-14 works up to naxx. To long i mean above 6months or more.
---
I thought they confirmed they‚Äôll keep the new mailing system so this should no longer be the case
---
i did recently and it happens to be pretty powerful if you keep your weapons up to date
---
Paladin can be a little awkward when you just hit 60 depending on how you leveled. 
---
If you ran some dungeons and have a halfway decent healing set, you'll be fine. But if you leveled mostly through questing, you'll hit 60 with little or no healing gear, and it'll need some attention.
---
You can remedy this by just buying some intel/healing power heavy gear (doesn't matter what kind it is, cloth, leather, whatever, but note +healing power gear is probably going to be way expensive) and having some consumables. Blessing of Light makes up for quite a bit.
---
But it's still important to note that paladins don't start out as infinite mana containers. You'll need to be smart about your heals, watch overhealing, wasting mana, etc, but all healers will be doing that, and paladins are still great healers as fresh 60s.
---
Tough trade off. Priest is the better 5 man healer, and if you don't want to tank on your druid you're really devaluing yourself.  I understand where you're coming from though because healing druids are a pain in the ass to kill and they are very fun. 
---
You're not going to run a lot of instances when you level anyway unless you have quests...that is...if you want to level with any kind of speed. Instances while leveling take a long time logistically to coordinate and make the trip to the location, suffer from people AFKing, rage quitting the group, or just flaking out 1/2 through. 
---
I think you should just weigh which is more important to you and go for it.  Make a vision for where you want to be at 60 when you have a decent set of pre-raid gear and it will help you decide between the classes.

My friends and I were messing around on a P server. Leveled Tauren to 20+ and Orc/Troll to 20+. We have always played alliance and after spending so much time in the horde cities we are 100% staying alliance. I can‚Äôt stand the horde cities at all. TB is ok but IF and SW are amazing and have no interest in giving them up. Also tried shaman but did not enjoy the totem style gameplay. I would try them out if interested though!

I needed this today. :)
---
&lt;Dominatus&gt; \[OCEANIC\] \[HORDE\] \[PVP\]
---
Time Zone: GMT+10
---
Raid times: Starting from 10:00pm GMT+10 (# of days per week TBA)
---
Goals: PvE (Semi-hardcore raid progression)
---
Loot: EPGP (Details TBA)
---
Contact: [https://discord.gg/Hcy87MX](https://discord.gg/Hcy87MX)
---
Guild info: Dominatus will be a late-night, semi-hardcore guild with a no-dickhead policy. Raiding will start at 10:00pm GMT+10 time so this would suit WA players or East Coast nightowls. We will not be rushing for server firsts but intend to develop into a high quality raiding guild for like-minded players. We have Vanilla raiding experience up to the first couple of encounters in AQ40.
---
Applicants: Anyone can apply, the levelling journey as a guild will be focusing on general recruitment and working out raid roles. Vanilla raiding experience is highly preferred but not mandatory. It is expected that players will have a moderate-to-advanced knowledge of their class as well as a committed ethos to raiding (familiarising yourself with mechanics, farming consumables, acquiring BiS gear etc).

Hey, the turnaround is usually anywhere between 3-5 days later, sorry about that! Most people grab them on their mobile device if that's an option too via Spotify or iTunes etc?
---
Yeah dude I was so tempted to do it back in the day, the druid travel form is so boring
---
Tales of the past ! I love all 3 ! Looking foward for this interview ! Thanks Josh !
---
oh damn I had completely forgotten about this video
---
That's a good warrior piece, they are crit starved  and have needed talent procs from crit
---
Getting there. I'm still working out my 1-20 speed leveling path. Professions and wand strategy are all worked out. Got all the dungeon quests worked out to make sure I get maximum value out of them. Talent point allocation is planned. Essential quests are identified (ZF carrot quest, tirion's quest line in epl, save the princess questline in brd, etc.).
---
I have found warriors to be worse than hunters with taking everything lol.
---
Thunderfury is not for rogues bro
---
I have a bit of a unique situation I'd really like some help with.
---
I'm wholly settled on what class I'm going to play (Holy Priest), but I'm totally unsure about what server to play on.
---
I'm a Brit, but I live in Central Russia (CET +6) and that time zone has totally prohibted me from joining any meaningful guild on retail. Now that I have the chance to start fresh, I'd really appreciate people's recommendations on which regional servers are likely to have raid times that line up with my free time, please?
---
During the week, I'm free from 2pm CET - 5pm CET, at weekends I guess I'm free 4am CET - 8pm CET.
---
Should I be looking for a Pacific server? Or might I be better served aiming for a US server? If so, would I want East Coast or West Coast? I'm not leaving Russia any time soon so this is going to be a pretty important choice on my part if I ever want to raid :(
---
Everyone gonna be waiting for respawns of the black ooze at Ironbeard's Tomb in the wetlands for the Digging through the Ooze quest.  It just has such a low drop rate though that on crowded servers it takes ages to kill enough ooze.
---
It's taken me since classics announcement to figure out dwarf Paladin. Still jumping between professions (pretty much everything but leatherworking), gender, and what type of server I will roll on...
---
no they were doing some theorycrafting on this in the "classic theorycrafting" discord, hunters have slightly higher uptime with nightfall but much lower dps than ret
---
i suggest paladin healer cus it plays like ret but does alot more, plus its new to you and healing is really fun in vanilla cus of mana management
---
There's a reason my guild only had 1 or 2 holy paladins and no other spec. I just love the rp element of them, but I think I'll be playing horde this time. I played mostly alliance all the way through Vanilla and the first half of BC. It will be nice to experience the other side.
---
Half a year is a long time. Personally I think 1.12 AV is lame, since it‚Äôs mostly PVE but I understand that nobody wants to be in a WW1 stalemate forever. 
---
A lot of people just want their rep and will never return. It could be fun if there were both versions to choose from when queueing hah, but that‚Äôs never going to happen.
---
just grindy like old school runescape
---
For some reason my brain read your last sentence in Falric's voice.  "Leather, mail, plate, none were spared the warrior's wrath.  Cloth will be no different"
---
You‚Äôre right I completely forgot bgs arnt till phase 3 and PvP rewards are phase 2. In that case I might just run a standard fury DPS build until PvP systems come into play. Would you recommend duel wield or 2H fury for pre raid end game? I know 2H is good for leveling but unsure if 2H slam still wins out at 60.
---
Yahzee once said about MMOs:
---
"Grinding is a feature of MMOs. Im not sure how you take it out and still have a game."
---
This covers just about everything I wanted to say. 5/5 Shield Spec, 2/2 Bloodrage, 3/5 Toughness, 5/5 Defiance, 1/3 Improved Shield Block, 1/1 Last Stand.
---
Would not surprise me if blizz implement this in the form of an add-on. They can claim classic is no changes with stock release and then leave it up to the users to apply the add-on or not.
---
Better get that fishing skill up or camp the auction house. Those oily blackmouths are calling your name.
---
Very true and honestly i dont plan on raiding much anyway (LBRS/UBRS ... and some MC pugs maybe).
---
Just wanted to see some numbers instead of the usual ‚ÄûIts useless, play heal!‚Äú. 
---
And Pala support capabilities and sustaine are legendary. Like you said, good readons to keep one around at all times ... no matter the specc :)
---
druid is good like alone in pvp, group battles arent their strong suit. if u wanna go around with a rogue friend then dru will be fun cus they do good damage for a healer, so yall can wreck shit haha
---
lol @ that paladin pic. There's gonna be a shit ton of those teal dresses running around because of no healing plate, and good luck finding a shield with int on it.  There will be a lot less of that when BGs are implemented though and a lot of gold gear running around with a 2H unstoppable force mace.
---
Back in vanilla, I mained a druid, then levelled a Warlock that I got to like 58 by the time TBC came out.
---
This time around I'm playing a Priest, since after I came back to WoW (I quit just before WotLK and returned at the end of MoP) I've settled solely on support classes.
---
I'd really appreciate if anyone could look at this (WiP) plan; mainly at the to-do list, and tell me if things look solid/whether I've missed things? I'm trying to prioritise aquiring best-in-slot pre-raid gear, grinding up sufficient cash for buying my mount plus BoEs and leveling my professions.
---
[Here's my spreadsheet.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15ZHumYWZvcSSlb7LIL3J8AAvae1CZaZ1SyY1jL10-n4/edit?usp=sharing)
---
At a certain gear point (for healers mostly), you can raid perfectly fine with 15-16 points in Prot.
---
I think a lot of people tend to forget that you must have at the VERY LEAST 2 hunters with Tranquilizing Shots to kil Magmadar.
---
One hunter is not enough because a miss = wipe, especially in blues and greens.
---
I've done MC a loooot, and I'm very eager to see all these guilds thinking it's gonna be easy face a few countertime that they didn't expect \^\^
---
Agreed
---
I would very much like that. I understand that people might not want this at launch since it might presumably mean that Blizzard divert resources from getting Classic out as soon as possible, but I would like to see optional clientside support for improved graphics further down the line.
---
Can't afford anything in vanilla when all your gold is being saved for mounts lmao
---
I remember seeing footage of people gallavanting about as Ragnaros and whatnot.
---
Or maybe you need more [experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG5P71m6D4g) with druids.
---
I NEVER had any issue with my healing while going 30 points in feral. Not in low level dungeons, not in end-game 5mans, not in raids.
---
HotW/NS you can max out threat talents if you want, can have furor and be pretty good at healing.
---
And only lose 10% healing, 9% mana cost reduction and cast time reduction with crits but gain 20% mana. 
---
Only thing you lose for tanking is more damage from balance tree and some armor if you haven't perked thick hide. Are those useful for a main tank facing a boss the raid never killed before? Absolutely. 
---
Is it a requirement for a guy who tanks 1-2 adds in a trash pull? Hell no.
---
But you do you. I'll keep my healing and tank gear in my bag and you carry your dps and tank gear in yours. (I don't like cat dps)
---
Mm'kaayy
---
there is much more to a Druid than being a FC as I said it in the post.
---
Posts like this make me concerned about the lack of class balance in Vanilla. There are reasons to be a druid and even a boomkin despite being lower DPS. They have support spells/buffs that are near essential in raiding. But if everyone's just concerned with pure DPS, nobody's going to want to fill that role.
---
that would be amazing. i haven't heard one way or the other.
---
Why would you ever want to use the new models or animations, they are both a top contributor to why i cant touch retail anymore.
---
Great Video! This one was an accident tho :D
---
Priest (likely healin, maybe shadow) or Lock. 5mans and PvP, maybe some light raiding. Horde.
---
I know the game quite well, mostly looking for people who have experience with these classes.
---
At what moments did you feel love for the class and at what moments were you annoyed with the class? And why? Any other things to add?
---
Everyone farms the shield from Mara, right? Looks like a spinning cog.
---
Honestly if you want to play a spec in Vanilla just do it. If you are having fun doing so that's good. But you'll have a hard time finding groups that's all.
---
Rule 7 does seem to be enforced in an odd way.
---
There are tons of low effort memes on this sub. This doesn't seem any lower effort than the others.
---
That said, if you have a problem with a removed post, just message the moderators. They can explain their reasoning better than anyone, and most of the time making a post about a removed post doesn't help the situation at all.
---
Warrior cow tank
---
They will probably add the option for new models just like they have the said there will be an option for new graphics. 
---
I would not try to import custom patches because they might get detected by warden and you'll be instantly banned.
---
Haha thanks mate, yes the show will go on :)
---
In the last pserver my retail friends quit at level 8-10.
---
They can actually do half decent dps if gear and consume usage is right. Plus the crit aura is really nice for warlocks/mages. One oomkin is a good thing in raids :) plus there fucking adorable
---
Was gonna post this, had T2 3p on for sooo long past it's content
---
I will never wear a Cloth-Robe with my Pally. It could have fucking +500 Healpower, no chance!
---
Other players that turned into RL friends. One I really wish I could find again. He was in Canada and used to talk to him on Messenger before it went away and I lost contact. Another one died during TBC, RIP.
---
I probably got some loot too...not from the one who died since I know some smartass will ask.
---
Ret is pretty good in PvP as long as you remember that it's a hybrid class and not a pure DPS class. Your support abilities are really good so you should use them as often as you can. They can solo well too but are easily kited. You can just not play the kiting game though and hide behind a tree or in a house. The Guardian's Favor (increases the duration of your Blessing of Freedom spell) talent in the Protection tree is pretty much mandatory for PvP.
---
With respect, that's your opinion.
---
I'll concede that the Tauren male was totally screwed up (the way they look so... "bumblingly happy" as they speak with their wild gesticulations doesn't really fit the serious monotone vanilla voice acting), but I'd rather look at a WoD dwarf than a vanilla one as I go about leveling.
---
I remember some guild removing the walls in AQ and skipping straight to C'Thun lol.
---

---
go full ret first. you could change some points here and there, like improved ret aura for vindication for improved improved SoM, useful that group content. (you dont want SoM for you, you would want to cast SoB on you while leveling to drink as less as possible)
---
best rotation is judging seal of The Crusader if its a really long fight/have more paladins and then cast S of Command and autoattack. if not, just use SoC (in combination with hammer of justice to get that extra damage of judging SoC).
---
after that, its not that important, it depends on how you want to play. do you want to use consecration or BoK? improved HoJ or get spiritual focus? more intellect and strength or a better BoP and BoF (this one is better for PVP)?
---
We usually remove any image/meme post that isn't obviously related to Classic beyond the post title; this is mentioned in the full ruleset. What falls into that can be somewhat subjective, but we try and be consistent. With that said, messaging us via ModMail is the way to go, not some pseudo-court of public opinion passive-aggressiveness.
---
When wow launched the first time. The forums and realm forums went up first‚Äîiirc. Many established guilds in other mmos and nationalities picked realms before it ever launched. 
---
I believe for example, black rock was earmarked as an oceanic realm before their own realms came out.
---
It's called personal preference.
---
It seems like the potential strain on the healers far outweighs the extra dps the hunter would be doing.
---
I got this photo as a screenshot from Hamsterwheel's second video going over Moonkins in Vanilla. Here's the link https://youtu.be/BL8YRx6GqHw
---
&gt;I've put a ton of work into this but I don't intend to update this spreadsheet at any point as I've lost all interest in this project. Feel free to use, change, or distribute it as you see fit.
---
I guess you're going to play a rogue as all of them then :p
---
I'm frankly not experienced enough with the current meta to comment on 2H fury (especially as horde with WF) versus DW fury. Someone else surely will be.
---
The only part I can comment on is the tanking aspect, which is you can still tank just fine in either spec.
---
As a feral druid you should innervate a healer
---
You should be the first to use battleres 
---
You should be able to remove poison etc if needed 
---
Your main goal is to dps yes but if you can you should help out.  
---
But now we are not talking about strange specs. 
---
As long As you got the 11/31/7 (2unspent) baseline 
---
Omenof clarity is one of the stronger ones (free cost spell allow you to drop form and drop a healbomb of either tranquility or regrowth). 
---
31 in feral is needed if your going to dps/tank and I would spend 33my self.  
---
7 allow you to get enraged and gives you enough rage/energy to deal with dps /tanking on the pull.  
---
So is 11/33/7 hybrid? Or just the feral cookie cutter?
---
You underestimate how big a problem starter zones are. The first days, a huge majority of the population will be pretty low level. You are both right. It's not a 100% solution but it's not 0% effective either. It is somewhere in-between.
---
After the starter zones, questers dissipate to different zones. You will still have traffic jams but you can also make an effort to evade some of them.
---
Most guilds aren't going to be able to be too choosy with their dps. They have to fill 40 slots. The absolute best thing you can bring to any normal guild is consistency. Be there when you say you're gonna be there and be ready to go and you'll get one of those slots. Also, rogues are (likely) going to be numerous, but they will also be in demand as their single target dps is top tier. Raid groups are likely to have quite a few rogues.
---
The video itself has classic edited into , try again.
---
In that case it gives me something else to research into for the time being. Thank you for your insight mate!
---
Every raid needs a Lazer Chicken :D
---
Thanks dude!
---
Every server will have thatcguild. Some will be better at it than others.
---
Its just weird to me i cant understand how anyone can like the way the new models move and bounce around, it disconnected me from my characters so i didnt feel at home anymore.
---
All points are valid except point 1. You do not "have" to spend a whole afternoon fishing and leveling up cooking. This is completely optional, it may just save you some gold. 
---
Make friends with a mage or simply just buy some, its relatively cheap. 
---
One of the most important thing's to start leveling up though is First Aid skill.
---
Those that quit will probably quit after only a few hours of realizing that beating single NPCs of the same level can be unintuitively difficult.
---
me too man ill binge it this summer but ill fall off when uni comes back around.
---
Same. If it's not a pure dps classic then don't judge it only by the dps. Afaik boomkin lacked mana and spell penetration in raids, and the numbers where low because of that. Im sure they p0wn dungeon-wise since you don't have to worry about lvl 63 bosses with 500k HP.
---
Completely agreed with the above. 1/3 imp shield block is probably the best point you can spend. 31/3/17 or if you want to stick to 31/5/15 and dont "need" the threat - drop to 3/5 defiance.
---
Sounds cool, but on ele you need to deink a lot , right? I mean is it worrh to drink after every 2mob? Or is that not bit expensive to buy waters all the time?
---
I see "raid leader" and "Hunter" and that's it, but I'm on mobile. What am I missing?
---
At least you understand that paladins heal. Abysmal dps should never be a choice you consider :)
---
The way I understand it, is that memes have to "make sense" and relate to classic wow without looking at the title of the post, otherwise it will marked as low effort. So in your case, without the title to explain whats going on in the video, it's just a man (hunter) stripping in front of another man (raid leader) which doesn't really relate to classic wow in any way.
---
Druid is a more fun class imo. Priest leveling is not super fun for me. Can‚Äôt say much on the endgame though.
---
Been fearing this one - played warlock since Vanilla and want to try something new. I know Kevin‚Äôs interview will suck me back in!
---
Orc if you're looking for the min/max racial stuff, Tauren if you want that massive toon intimidation factor.
---
Illusionary Rod is the one from SM Lib
---
Truth is, dagger have become meta for tanks and threat. And gearing/speccing for threat has become more popular as well. And item that can proc guaranteed crits means your tps can go through the roof. Personally I think that the Ironfoe is better, but I can understand your frustration. Ive seen fury warriors using it as well for the same reason, or swapping it in amd out for higher flurry uptime during early server raid progression.
---
I agree with you on animations, I really like the models but the animations kill it for me. New models with old animations would be perfect.
---
Because Defiance multiplies with Defensive Stance, I‚Äôd argue it‚Äôs too valuable. The threat from the 2% Crit + Impale won‚Äôt compete.
---
I have 0 qualms with bring clothadin but I will always wear a shield.
---
Yeah, on PVE when someone flags, everyone in the area quickly knows there is pvp going on. It is communicated quickly so someone might get you one time, but unless they are REALLY good at hiding, the other pvpers will find them.
---
I played on pvp to start with and we got camped 50/50 days. We were trying to just level and kept getting camped. It was horrid.
---
The biggest concern this time around with pvp that I do not think many people realize is the BIS gear is primarily pvp gear. This is due to the 1.12 version release being WAY ahead of when it was originally. This is going to ENCOURAGE that god awful gameplay. That is the main reason I am making sure to convince my friends to all play PVE. I HOPE it is not half as bad as I am imagining, but to get BIS gear, gamers do all sorts of sketchy stuff.
---
I'm sure the target release of Winter 2017 will be met with time to spare.
---
They likely weren't dpsing in healing gear they were just wearing their healing gear the last time their profile got updated. The best way to get ret gear is to heal for a good guild and take ret pieces as OS.
---
That surely isnt possible. You can replace models but collision shouldnt change.
---
well thats gonna be vanilla boring, regardless of class. im still hyped tho.
---
Pretty sure they are going to implement a classic/newer models button. If they're going to add one for graphics/terrain, why would they skip over the models, it's already in the legion client. Not my preference though.
---
Hi Hen-stepper 
---
Would you be willing to talk about that on camera if we asked you a few questions about it?
---
Best
---
Ben
---
Hi Samidare
---
So /u/Coltrane45 said a couple methods are viable. He said:
---
&gt;Yeah I'm probably going mining and engineering. Farm a lot of arcane crystals at 60 to pay for things. Once I get 500g and enough starting materials to take engineering to 240ish then I'll switch to tailoring
---
I asked about Doing Tailoring/mining at first then drop mining for Eng
---
Me:
---
&gt;Ooooh, I misunderstood. I thought you mean start tailoring/mining. Yeah that's a better idea. Hoard the cloth and level engineering. I bet trying to hoard all the ores for engineering would be tougher.
---
Him:
---
&gt;You can totally go tailor/mining
---
He also mentioned a benefit to doing mining/engineering at first is that robe of the void can be subbed out for the T1 Felheart Robes. So you might not need tailoring right at the beginning. Swap mining to tailoring later when Bloodvine comes out, hoard cloth until then.
---
Based on these responses I think I'm going to follow what he's going to do. Mining/Eng then swap to tailoring later. I think he has raised a good point you can always use mining to farm for reliable income if you need.
---
Don't forget on the performance of every other ranking player who gets more honor than you. You are fighting for that rank with every other pvper out there.
---
Read his post again. He went to 60 with the WC staff.
---
lol don‚Äôt try to reason with a reddit mod..
---
Ahh yea that is probably it
---
taran icebreaker lasted my paladin until level 59 and its a lvl 48(iirc) wep, got it when i was like 13, good times
---
It gives you a lot more flexibility to replace either if you want upgrades. The flexibility saves money (at least for the headphones).
---
Perhaps you don't even need a mic, your phone already has a great one.
---
What are those unit frames? I don't remember seeing incoming heals being a thing in vanilla.
---
Hi SoupaSoka
---
Thank you I will get in contact with them if possible. Sure it would be great to ask you some questions if possible and if you know anyone else that was there at the time. 
---
I agree with you, I think it's too valuable as well. In my opinion if you're going prot at all for 5 mans, its for threat and not mitigation, so it's hard to envision someone who would "need" the threat, but not the full 5 points into defiance.
---
I could see some sort of theoretical trade off for non-tanking applications (2% more crit for PVP), but not only does that seem like trying to do too much with 1 spec, it's not gonna matter at all until Phase 3 when he'll probably be an entirely different spec anyway.
---
Are we also to blame for hearthstone p2w, overwartch drip fed content but innundation of skins and diablo immortals?
---
The community has always complained. This is the way it is in life gaming or not gaming.
---
Go watch old blizzcon pannels, if people complained about difficulty blizzard would not give a fuck.
---
The diffirence is blizzard became too greedy and 12 million minthly subs was no longer enough so they changed the game philosophy to aim more content for accessibilty instead if exclusivity.
---
The good does not erase the bad nor the opposite.
---
Blizzard like bungie like bethesda like bioware have all been at the center and shaped gaming in the past 20 years.
---
And sadly for all of us they are all gone...
---
Your raid should have enough healing paladins to cover blessings and judgements take up debuff slots your not even allowed to use them outside of specific encounters in a decent guild. Bopping someone is nice but a healing paladin watching raid frames is far more likely to react to that than a ret pally concentrating on dps.
---
I think you are restricted to a specific faction per server.
---
No, I didn't think about it.
---
If you have a minimun ammount of intelligence, you do
---
The winterspring mount only takes 20 days, if I remember. Although, I did it sometime after vanilla. It will not be as easy, I'm sure.
---
Hi simcase
---
While it may not be from ground zero your story is still interesting, would I be able to speak to you over skype or discord to discuss further?
---
Oh I was reading the wrong level reeee
---
Damn, that's awesome! Love these kind of theorycrafts, and I'm looking forward to test it come classic.
---
Great job bro!
---
assuming you keep a healthy sleeping schedule, and fulltime job/education, pretty much any remaining free time from rank 8 to 10 or so, before that you can chill
---
Already got your Adderall for your 20 hour sessions?
---
No laptop? You can create a character during a break on any laptop with a core i processor or equivalent, regardless of GPU or OS.
---
Yeah, pally would be second best to druid if you want to tank and heal 5mans. But I think he wants to play horde so I didn't suggest it.
---
You'd be surprised how often we'll overturn a post removal or ban if people send us a relatively polite (or at least not antagonistic) ModMail that explains their perspective.
---
https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-guild-banned/1100-6160983/
---
No expansions at all would be nice. Defeats the purpose of wow 'classic'
---
 I'm going to agree with op on this one I remember in vanilla having to be inspected before pug raids and hoping the raid leader "likes what he sees."  I get it. Get a sense of humor ffs.
---
 Love reading all of your stories. This is what its all about.
---
An unarmed civilian chooses not to engage in combat, by turning on war mode, you essentially are agreeing to become a combatant.  You can still level and play without it on and not be at risk of encountering wpvp.  What I am trying to say is that you are getting mad that people can unfairly destroy someone, but it goes both ways, just turn off war mode if you don't wanna get ganked.
---
Personally if you are a hostile and within proximity, I will kill you no matter what because I really enjoy the faction pride RP.  I will hunt you down if you are within proximity of me still, but if you run away, I will let you go.
---
Ya it does, lol i understood what was being talked about right away. It was funny and its just like any other meme that gets posted in here. Either have consistency or dont remove em.
---
That's nothing yet, to be honest. Your purple gear does not come until rank 12 and 13. And that 32 hour schedule might end up cutting it but is probably not enough depending on faction balance and collusion.
---
And the less time you invest, the longer it will take.
---
ironically, ret paladins have a bigger and more complicated pve rotation than most pure dps specs. Seal&gt;judge&gt;seal every 8 sec, using the correct rank of consecration for mana conservation, saving mana for spamming hammer of wrath in execute phase, and if there are debuff slots alloted for it, keeping up a judgement of crusader at all times.
---
Haha nah, I just don't plan on raiding so the spreadsheet doesn't have much practical use for me. I just made it because I was bored and needed to kill some time.
---
I didn't saying blizzard wasn't at fault but the consumer is also to blame.
---
what show
---
I‚Äôm okay with content like this being removed.
---
No, they outright removed the walls along with collision somehow lol.
---
That rings too true. All warriors will need to at least off tank at some point regardless of spec. I got shit on for refusing to go prot back in the day, but I still made it into raids.
---
Thats like 200g right there xD
---
What does a ret paladin bring that a holy paladin don't?
---
Yeah, duo farming makes warrior a lot more viable. Still a lot slower than good farming classes, but not completely shit
---
I always fond that it did not do much in terms of kill speed. I normally go for faster move speed then mana reduction, then critt, then utility like no push back on heals. Hit for me comes after this but I might be wrong. I have not played whit it enuf.
---
use lower ranks of ur healing spells. they get the gear benefits but dont oom you, also theyre still powerful
---
I was never able to find the video again but back in bc I saw a video of a dwarf shadow priest with anathema in WSG raping everyone 1v1 and the song playing was for minor-10% skill
---
But then again, this post https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bf6h5w/when_youre_questing_in_stvietnam_and_hear_an/ didn't get marked as low-effort meme even tho it's just a kid with wow shoulders photoshopped on him which doesn't make any sense either unless you read the title. So yea.. idk..
---
If you hate melee combat I would advise against Druid. Leveling is a huge part of the game which means lots of melee combat. Lock is an amazing leveler with almost no down time and can solo elites with fear. They are really strong at both PVE and PVP and can farm.
---
I'm in the same boat. I ultimately chose Night Elf Priest to be my main. Night Elf is my favourite race too, and wanted to do healing this time. I don't like druid, so only Priest is left, but it's a subobtimal race and class combo. 
---
I considered it to be worth it. The bonus racials of dwarves are great, but priests are first and foremost healers. Do your job really well, socialize with others, use consumables and buffs. Some may make a stink about your racials, but if it would bother you then you should grow some thicker skin. It's a game.
---
This podcast is just the best to consume good classic info/news/content. The production on it is high quality, and the variety of topics it covers is extensive. Also I reccomend joining their discord, just a fun good group of people over there. A delight to hang out with while we all F5 this subreddit for more news!
---
Somewhere between 20% and 30% of a warrior from MC to Naxx and they bring nothing useful to the table that's unique for ret. In a raid it's a wasted spot.
---
Locks are monsters in pvp just for fear alone. They are obviously vulnerable in cloth. I think back on a lock I 2 shot in Arathi with the Halberd of Smiting when its decapitation proc'd consecutively on mortal strikes. Every other encounter was likely me dead before I could charge them..
---
I miss my TBC shockadin pvp spec
---
20% skill I believe, remember the name is the song :)
---
Wow, I wasn't afraid of this until now, WTF OP.
---
This was my main server (I"m brazilian) and I loved that server. We had BR guilds, NA guild, KR guilds.
---
It was so alive, I learned a lot, and I can only speak a good enough english today because I played on warsong back then. Damn, I wish I could find another warsong-like server. (pure BR servers are really crappy and most of people there are terrible players with the "relax, it's just a game" mentality)
---
SoupaSoka can you explain how this isn't at low effort meme? https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bf6h5w/when_youre_questing_in_stvietnam_and_hear_an/
---
GMs have got GFs...
---
Some people absolutely astound me. This is extremely impressive.
---
Locks have a learning curve.
---
Rogues are a safe bet, which is why everyone seemed to be a rogue.
---
Would be really mean for mages and other bread and butter AoE classes which are *the* carriers in group mass group PvP. Unequip weapon, whack a civilian, drag him into a bunch of AoEing mages to fuck with them. :(

They will release classic when the monthly subs are at their lowest with no content coming up.

---
This is the same case then. The content of the picture isn't specifically limited to Classic, but why is the post not removed? Seems very nitpicky.
---
As I said if you are overgeared then you can prolly clear everything but you'll have more downtime. Some high level 5man bosses and even some trash hit pretty hard. Enh Shamans and holy/prot Paladins work just fine because they can wear a shield and have good armor and they have mechanics to hold threat, they are good 5man tanks. But rogues not really because their mitigation just sucks, so your healer will go OOM all the time.
---
Yeah I mained a mage in Vanilla the rotation was incredibly simple.
---
Yeah Pally are the ultimate support class but lack luster in combat. Hell I was playing on a p server tanking SM Lib while eating Chik fil a. Just seal, conc and auto attack is basically enough.
---
I heard that there are 2 streamers planning on rolling the same server and opposite factions.
---
This sounds like a wPvP dream/nightmare come true. I'm tempted to roll on it.
---
I thought it was instant. I've had people reserve names for me on private servers and 2 seconds after the character is deleted I can use it.
---
Blizzard might have some system to prevent that tho? First I'm hearing about it.
---
Maybe, but it depends how many hours you focus on it. I swear I heard 4 hours a day it still need 90 something days. I know one of the repeatable quests is elites which only some can solo, so you are limited usually.
---
So if I sub on launch day, check my Wrath account, and find some gold, how do I convert this into a token, and then how do I use the token to get a month sub?
---
Sorry if this is a dumb question.  Ive just never used a token or even seen one in game.  I didnt know I could use my old gold to buy one (doubt I have anything close to 200k gold though).
---
Mistakes happen, dont worry :)

I'd say it should have been removed as being low effort. However, we try and be reasonable - if we don't catch a post until it has gotten a fair amount of comments, out of respect for the discussion that has already started, we'll leave a post up (unless it's a flagrant issue, such as something racist). My guess is that's the case for that one; we missed it until it was up for too many hours.
---
I know that makes the moderation seem inconsistent, but we're trying to be reasonable people about it.
---
Dwarf. They're the best priests in the game because of Fear Ward and Desperate Prayer.
---
Fear Ward - A buff that you can apply to any friendly players. It eats up fear-effects. Lasts for 10 min until feared. 30 sec CD. Unlimited targets. Insanely OP in vanilla because of some bosses and quite a few trash mobs (in both dungeons &amp; raids) use fear effects.
---
Desperate Prayer - instant heal on yourself with a 10 min CD. Both dwarfs and humans have this spell. Night Elves don't.
---
Humans have 5% spirit but it's not really a whole lot.
---
Don't forget the 1 SM/Ruin warlock geared for crit to keep up improved shadowbolt.

They deemed your post as "low effort".  Me thinks maybe you should "try again" and put some effort into it this time.
---
To be fair, a lot of people will easily hit rank 6-7 just grinding AV rep when that comes out. If you level an alt at that time, you can go into AV at level 51 and do the quests and grind harpies/gnolls and get honor plus XP which puts you at rank 5-7ish.  The worst part of the rank 10 grind is getting to 10 from 9. It's really 3 or so weeks of a non-casual grind.  You can grind less and hit 1 rank every 2 weeks instead of trying to get 1 rank per week which is more difficult. Basically you just need to stay ahead of the decay and you'll make progress. There's no skill involved, just time.
---
AAAAAGH.... AAAGhh.. UHHHGHH AHHHHHHHHHHHGH... 2019?? AUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGGH
---
 I always assumed you ran tendril spec, not HOTW.  As much as I judged your feral spec then I realize now that HOTW is a beast spec.
---
It was, I had them from some addon. Dont know if it was msbt or sct though or some other addon :/
---
June is just over 5 weeks away, I doubt we'll see it before even July at this point.
---
Well I had 3 maxed toons before legion hit doing WoD ‚Äúdaily‚Äù garrison I think is what they were called and also ran my rouge through almost every ‚Äúlock out‚Äù raids evey week old raids for gold I know I have a screen cap from 2017 of over 1m gold on one of the acct most likely my bank alt
---
This guy shapeshifts!
---
Your limiting factor as paladin healer early on is mana. Save up your int gear from levelling and buy some from ah. Always bring lots of water and drink on every pull no matter what and you will do fine
---
Not the guy you were replying to, but you came off pretty rough and dismissive of him. You gotta remember, context and tone can be tough to grasp in written word. Dude's obviously been through some shit, and it a sore point, and just telling him to calm down is gunna come off more dismissive. You both are going about talking to each other wrong.
---
And that last part, it doesn't read as him having an opiod addiction, more that docs refuse to perscribe any because of the opiod crisis, leaving him in crippling pain.
---
To the original dude, I hope you can get everything cleared up and life starts going more your way.
---
After only a couple weeks?  Just reroll on a new server that's more balanced.
---
Especially on a PvP server, you might level faster.
---
You'll get the second one
---
Either or will work
---
Ugh, my main in vanilla was a hunter. I said for Classic I‚Äôd go with something new for a truly fresh experience....(was going to go pally) but now I don‚Äôt know again haha
---
#nochanges
---
I quit a few years ago, but as of when I played on retail, names freed up as soon as you deleted them. I don't remember there being a buffer or account tag on a name once a character is deleted.
---
Only true for the guilds that don‚Äôt matter
---
WR leveling time was what, 40+ hours for 1-60? While not unfeasible, I think somebody would have to account share or go without sleep for two weeks to have Benediction in that time. I'd say three weeks guaranteed, two weeks not guaranteed but possible.
---
Lol, no.
---
Well there are still gold farmers and sellers at a much lower right theres just less incentive to use them. 
---
I think they're work pretty well considering blizzard isn't making more gold, the gold has to come from somewhere. 
---
I play retail and private servers so I'm used to farming gold so it's nice to not have to blow 15$ a month. And I'm sure someone somewhere is doing something with that gold I farmed up. 
---
I'm not economist tho so I have no idea if this is fucking anything up and I really honestly hate the pay to win aspect rich people just getting whatever they want by pouring money into their bnet accounts, even if it means I get to play WoW for free. Ideally I'd want the system in like Diablo or something, that way it's not affecting the game I love but I can farm still farm up my sub fee somehow.
---
None
---
Yeah they do lots of damage when they have mana
---
Isn't there a r/barrens troll posts like this can go?
---
It destroys the economy and is basically pay to win cash shop.
---
Tell that to all the rogues who used it in vanilla
---
My uber fucked up and dropped me off at a hospital once. The next one was 15 minutes away so I walked in and asked if I could sit down, the nice lady said sure.
---
$89,750 can you fucking believe that
---
They also made spawn times dependent on the number of players.
---
So are you implying that is not enough? What exactly constitutes ‚Äúenough‚Äù classic content merged into the pic/ gif to qualify??
---
loot trading would be terrible in Vanilla though. Loot is usually too diverse to be class-restricted so if you're in a group with a 3m premade, they'll just all roll need on anything they want and trade it to each other. 
---
Clear downsides to sharding, too. The massive pserver population in Elwynn/Westfall (for example) is basically a gating mechanism. Unless you get out ahead of the pack, you're stuck in the morass, and it keeps the middle of the pack players close to each other for the first 15-25 levels.
---
Being *with* the pack is legitimately the best gameplay experience that pservers offer, which is part of why **fresh** is such an enduring meme. Once you hit 20-25 and people start to spread out across multiple continents/zones, getting groups for dungeons/quests is still easy but zone density is acceptable.
---
Spirit is great if you have the talent to get SP from a percentage of it though
---
I played from February 2005 till the TBC.  I saw vultros exactly one time and I killed him and he dropped the fucking cape :(
---
Luna Unit Frames
---
pretty much everybody on vanilla private servers uses them
---
well main something else (paladin, rekbomb wew) and make a hunter twink, they're so stupidly overpowered at lvl 29, they're like rogues at lvl 19.
---
I‚Äôm not
---
Nope
---
Fair enough.  
---
  If the title was added to be part of the picture in this case and OPs case, would these memes still be considered low effort?
---
Hunter for quite a while. If you can get just through T1 and get the bow quest from MC and get that done, you'll be set for the entirety IMO.
---
Nope. Healing druids would spec into it and dump mana on max rank heals then drink back up.
---
I personally think the best thing they could do would be to recreate one--ONE--older version of AV and release it initially, and then at some point in one of the later content buckets update it to 1.12. This way everybody gets something they want.
---
Game won't survive with no changes. See 2007scape.
---
why?
---
21.5 hours a week is still quite a bit.
---
If you need a pic of mynis.  [https://imgur.com/MYeQc7m](https://imgur.com/MYeQc7m)Sorry best I got, should of taken more shots when we were in WSG but was too busy playing.      Who is Darckli?
---
I get that its heresy around here but I'd love a complete Vanilla graphical update. Keep gameplay the same but update all the zones to modern graphics including items and armor etc. Itll never happen but I can dream. I would leabr zones exactly the same just make update the graphics.
---
How so?
---
Xantim had some entertaining videos. Not the best Spriest, but good enough.

---
Life without enemies would be boring.
---
Eu token is like 175k and US a bit lower than that. Can give you a couple of months.
---
Might as well do it if you don‚Äôt gonna play retail anymore.
---
If you like spamming one heal then pally is for you!
---
Yeah they should be the more complex mage spaming frostbolt, or the lock spamming shadowbolt!
---
I wouldn't say either is lots of damage is what I was saying.
---
There will be many players that want to level their tailoring. Hand them your mageweave and the reagent and you can usually get it for free.
---
Yeah you're right.  Knowing someone paid $ for their epic mount basically invalidates everyone else's efforts and makes the fact that you have an epic mount worthless.
---
This kind of stuff killed the WoW we used to love.
---
Pay to Pay is cancer and destroys the game.  Please Blizz dont make the same mistakes again!
---
Faps!!
---
I'm still going to play one.
---
Reckbombs will definitely be a thing in Vanilla
---
On private servers currently you can intentionally /sit to make yourself get crit and generate a stack.  This was not the case in Vanilla- you would still get crit if you /sit but it would *NOT* generate a reckoning stack. 
---
You absolutely can still unleash reck bombs.  Rogues, warriors, and mages especially generate charges quickly.  If you have a mage in melee range you'll get a lot of frost nova, fire blast, arcane explosion or whatever which can all crit and generate stacks.  It's extremely viable to spec reckoning for PVP as a paladin- vanilla or private server either way you smash faces.
---
People are right to point out that this is technically bannable, and people have been banned for it in the past. However my experience has always been that Blizz (or rather Warden) doesn't notice, and unless you screenshot or livestream yourself using model edits to cheat, it's unlikely you'll get banned.
---
People have claimed warden picked up on their client edits in the past, I don't know how much validity there is to that vs getting banned for botting in BGs and telling your friends it was your model edits to save face.
---
I would like an option to use updated models as well.
---
You are half-leftie then!
---
It's normal, just the opposite. Instead of WASD I use arrows and nearby keys (incl. numeric keyboard).
---
Lets agree to disagree :D
---
got a link to the discord? love me some theorycrafting.
---
I want to be melee DPS but I don‚Äôt ever want to tank, I‚Äôm a rogue right?
---
Still trying to decide between holy paladin and resto druid. Holy paladin is better and I like it a lot but I also really like druid. Druid is nice because as the master looter and probably one of two druids its easier to give myself gear without people getting upset. Paladin is nice because I also plan on doing pvp (and rez is nice)
---
Anyone that has played both or raid lead have any advice?
---
I'm ready to feign death / freeze trap so many 5 pulls
---
95% sure I'll be going warlock. The problem I have is professions. I'll most likely stick to PvP and then just do casual raids here and there when I have a dedicated night to play. Is it worth going tailoring if I plan to PvP mostly?
---
I added "Classic" to Meme and spelled out how the tidbit of info relates to Classic a bit more, is this enough to not get removed?
---
Or a ret Pali, or enhance shaman, or feral Druid, or survival hunter (lol)
---
Yes bags are crucial! Wailing Caverns is a great early source of bags for horde. There's a quest for a 10 slot (deviate hide pack) and a fairly common 10 slot drop (snakeskin bag).
---
Elites are more likely to drop bags too, so dungeons in general are a decent source of bags.
---
If you have money, you buy tokens with real world currency. Tokens = in game currency. You just bought gold.
---
Vanilla is not about convenience, period. Let blizzard handle the gold farmers, imo. They should be handled better Han they were in vanilla.
---
The facts don't agree with you.
---
By getting moonkin form?
---
Well, you're competing with your own faction. The amount of "rank points" you get per week depends on how much honor you farmed in comparison to the other players on your server and in your faction. You also lose 20% of your total "rank points" every week, so if you don't farm enough you hit a wall or rank backwards.
---
If there are enough players who literally just farm honor and sleep (i.e. 16+ hours of farming every day, or 24 hours if multiple people play the same character), then the higher ranks are impossible to reach if you have a life outside of WoW.
---
&gt; Paladins have so much utility and even a ret paladin has blessings, bubbles and judgements to help the raid
---
All the holy paladins have the same thing.
---
\&gt;  but me and wifes having a very good time  
---
I'm not sure if you meant "wife" or "wives" but that's interesting.
---
yeah, i mean i can understand it.. but it still grinds my gear that i had the chance to play a 2x FS combo on a rogue which is like godtier at that point because it proccs pretty often too
---
And it's +20c whole august here.. boom!
---
Paladin is master of healing, especially in PvP. Shaman is incredible PvP burst and pretty good heal/utility combo.
---
Druid...yeah, pretty clunky
---
Except you can still buy gold from gold Farmers and they will always exist because a lot of people have more money than time. I'd rather Blizzard sell the gold than Farmers
---
Succesfully kited him as a Gnome Lock while my Dwarf Paladin friend solotanked it. Sometimes you just gotta believe in yourself.

Custom private servers are a ghost town compared to blizzlike.
---
There's your precious facts. You can join the 3 or 4 people playing on them if you'd like.
---
EverQuest had some ASOIAF references back in 1999 too. One of the bard guilds had NPCs named Sansa and Joffrey.
---
UBRS is the huntard detection dungeon. First the balcony jump then kiting. And weapon drops like Dal Rends which are Hunter weapons.

Seriously go check out Kevin on YouTube and twitch guys. He talks about this stuff constantly on twitch and is great for answering questions. He has a discord community going as well. Recently he‚Äôs been watching Madseasonshows alpha patch notes vids every once in a while, you can check out the VoDs on twitch to get his commentary. Very interesting stuff
---
Yes but that's during a good week with really nothing else going on. There will be alot more weeks where I can only play 7-10 hours total.
---
I wonder how different it would be if you couldn't see other player's level.
---
The version classic is based on doesn't use .mpq files so they just won't be loaded. To use custom models you have to use an injector, which is detectable and banable.

He said 'I don‚Äôt ever want to tank'.
---
Idk if it was really rare but the whirlwind axe was an iconic item I had back then. Just so good for the lvl it's used and I loved the way it looked.
---
Yeah, in vanilla you can cast your heals as any spec, being resto spec just makes them better but you usually downrank them. But if you could drink in combat mana wouldn't be an issue, so you could drop just use max rank heals to make up for the healing bonuses you lose from the restoration tree. It would be be so good you wouldn't see any druid not doing it.
---
Don‚Äôt ever use bear form ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
I'd say yes, if the image/meme post is self-explanatory (e.g. I could save the GIF and post it to Discord and it still makes sense) and related to Classic, it'd be allowed.
---
Sure it does. They aren't needed due to better automation. Increase profits get a pay raise.
---
Counterpoint: if you are already talented with hotkeys and spend a lot of time in apps that heavily utilize them (particularly terminal-based apps that pre-date mouses such as vim or emacs) ... stick with muscle memory on this one. I spend most of my day in a terminal not using a mouse and my goal in WoW is to use it pretty much for turning and hovering over raid frames. I trust my left hand to be accurate, complicating my mouse hand is just asking for trouble.
---
Hi, i have look at your sheet and can se you have done some work. 
---
Some of your crafts while lvling seem a bit off, since the amount of wool needed is more than you get while lvling, so taloring is behind, dont expect to have some of the crafts at the sugested lvls unless you use gold on mats. 
---
This inclues some of the later ones to like truefaith which is locked behind 40 days of mooncloth from the day you hit 250 tayloring. 
---
i woud reevaluate the amout of BOE you buy some of them are deffently worth it if you get a good deal like a cheep Cassandra's Grace or the Papal Fez which both are great for pre raid bis eaven dreamweave is solid if you cant find a good deal.  
---
to sum it up it looks like you have a plan. What about a lesser magic wand?
---
Based on what you said, why would I want to flag myself in a 1v1 situation? That changes world PvP even more for me now and an even bigger deterrence for PvE servers.
---
The honor system comes out in Phase 2 which I think is same to assume is a couple months in at least.
---
This means you're most likely going to have at least 1 level 60 by then, and leveling is not as high a priority. 
---
This phase is very light on PvE content, and the world bosses are perfect for the PvP patch, while it doesn't get in the way of you running Dire Maul; people SHOULD be out in the world PvPing, it will be a one-of-a-kind historic time period where there is honor system without BGs out. 
---
It's going to be personal preference (it always was), but for me PvP is the very obvious choice especially based on your first paragraph
---
That will suck because after about a month you'll have like fiddy dead servers.
---
That‚Äôs for blue gear. If you have a full time job, it is almost mathematically impossible to get full purple pvp gear (on most servers/battle-groups) without cheating. This is why account sharing and AV botting was extremely common and probably will be common in classic.
---
I love vanilla wow but the pvp grind system is unhealthy and broken, and those are words I don‚Äôt throw around often.
---
Seems objectively worse from what I can tell. Naming conflicts alone can be desastrous to deal with.
---
No, so I can run away from annoying people :)
---
Former arms warrior. I doubt I ever respec'd once through Vanilla. If you get enough gear, you can do raids with an accompanying guild, but be prepared to off tank. Pvp is a lot of fun with arms, too. Clothies are just.. *muah*
---
I only like wheel of time references
---
Thats pretty fucked that that was possible. Thanks for providing sauce!

dalrends is hunter weapons tho.

HOw someone else earns (or doesn't earn) their stuff doesn't invalidate what others did.   My first car was bought with money that I earned over the span of 3 summer jobs, my friend got his bought by his parents, this fact didn't diminish my accomplishments or how I felt about earning my vehicle.   I don't live my life or play my games based on other peoples accomplishments.
---
What killed the WoW we used to love is small changes that inevitably removed the core community aspect of an MMO and turned it into a single player PUG game with multiplayer options.    When you can play an MMO for 10 hours successfully and never speak to another person, that is a fail in my books.  Tokens didn't kill WoW.
---
 Pay to Play isn't a "cancer",  Cancer is cancer , Pay to Play is a model that SHOULD prevent microtransactions from appearing in the game that affects gamplay and gives other people unfair advantages if they have more disposable income.   Unfortunately, corporate greed is prevalent in games and cosmetic shops have pushed the boundaries of what was acceptable.
---
I think you should still be able to reach rank 10 with that time. Maybe 11.
---
My rough estimate would be that you'd cap out at rank 10.
---
I did rank 10 when I was a high school student, so I could put in something like 5-6 hours on weekdays and ~32 hours each weekend. I stopped at 10 because of exams, so I'm not sure how far I could have gotten before the 20% decay had gotten too big.
---
Last time I was leveling through Duskwood, I saw a Starving Dire Wolf mob near an NPC who was a member of The Night Watch. Couldn't help but think someone in the dev team had read asoiaf.
---
I bought the sword at the end of LK. Full size replica, ~$400... never received it. Somehow it was never delivered but tracking was screwy. I‚Äôm sure someone opened that box somewhere - I can only hope it went to a fan of the game, and isn‚Äôt sitting in a dump. :-/
---
fine by me, im just gonna hit exalted and never touch it again.
---
Hi all. I played Wow since Classic, and have played every expac besides WoD pretty much. I mained a Warlock from Classic all the way up to mid-Legion, when I swapped to a Brewmaster/WW monk. I still played the warlock up until Uldir, but more attention was spent on my Monk as I became more skilled in Tanking.
---
For classic Wow, I think I will be retiring Warlock, as I am leveling one on a private server currently as trial/fun.
---
PvP and tanking is most important to me. I'm indifferent towards the raiding scene - though I understand gear from there can be good. I would like to focus more on PvP as my endgame, as I can only play from 7-midnight on week days. I got heavy into the M+ scene in Legion with tanking, but BFA was unable to hold my interest past Uldir.
---
So I am thinking now leveling a Warrior as my tank, then a rouge as my PvP main. The warrior I would be able to tank to 60, then have him as a pvp/tank hybrid that I would play casually. The Rouge is the one im on the fence about, as I would only play him in PvP pretty much. I want to be confident that it is a good melee PvP choice, which I think it is.
---
Finally, I would have a caster, which I cant decide on. I would like to be able to heal, but it isnt a priority for me. I would use this character probably as a farm alt, or just a caster character in general. So I could use suggestions on choosing between: Mage, Druid, Priest or shaman.
---
Going Horde by the way.
---
Thanks for taking the time to look! 
---
The BoE list isn't so much a set of mandatory purchases as more a prompt along the lines of "yo, check the auction house for these things every time you're in a city and snap 'em up if they look good." My aim's just to get myself as kitted out as is possible for a solo player, so that I can hopefully make a good name for myself in dungeon groups.
---
Since I'm in a weird timezone I'm figuring that, if I can build up a good enchant library/perform well in 5 man groups, I might best maximise any good connections I can make and maybe get in on some raids.
---
With regards to profs; the tailoring/fishing objectives I've placed there are to be prioritised, since I think the Dreamweave set is really nice and I think leveling fishing's a bit of a priority so I can grind cash nice and early farming fish for the Free Action Potion. I'm going to need a lot of cash to snag BiS BoEs, get my mounts aaaaand to buy the BoE enchant recipes.
---
Truefaith looks like it's going to be a right pain in the arse, aye :p
---
&lt;Low Effort Memes&gt; would be a spectacular guild name.
---
A character named Tirion? Check
---
An Undead Army from the cold north? Check
---
A name clearly inspired by A Song of Ice and Fire? Check
---
Warcraft 3 and early WoW were definetely inspired by ASOIAF to some degree.
---
As GroFu says if you are aiming for world firsts go human if not play what you want. There is a diffrance in the amount of hit you need on gear. The 5 extra points in swords give around 2% hit if i rember correct.
---
I'm in exactly the same boat. But I used all those add-ons back in vanilla, so playing with out them this time around would in fact be #changes.
---
Yeah definitely. There‚Äôs no way I can get that crazy high rank 14 that some are gonna get to so I‚Äôm thinking twink gives a more level playing field.
---
[Dad, your song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z29Rk8814w) is playing on the radio again!
---
Currently struggling to pick between the four pure dps classes, Rogue, Mage, Warlock, and Hunter. I plan on playing Alliance so that factors into Warlock.
---
I fee like Hunter is the hardest to play PvP and Pve, and you get the least amount of payout for being good.
---
Mage has no satisfying gear, it seems like it all looks like crap, which sucks.
---
Rogue is well Rogue.. Been there done that.
---
Finally, Alliance side Warlock has a ridiculous pvp disadvantage due to Wotf. 
---
I'm looking for a class that can excel in pvp and pve, mage obviously satisfies this but they are hideous (IMO). 
---
Hunter and Warlock are both interesting, but i'm uncertain i'll enjoy them in pvp. Luckily they both look awesome at most stages of the game.
---
Lastly, Rogue is top tier raid dps and awesome in solo pvp, but outside of wpvp ganks, they don't really find love in premades.
---
Any advice that might help me decide?
---
&gt; warlocks need soulshards* for most their stuff.

Played Tauren my whole life but had to race change to Undead once WoD dropped. New Taurens look like they're perpetually stumbling without ever falling over. But honestly I think most of the new models are absolutely atrocious compared to the old ones, and that's not nostalgia talking.
---
I also miss the days of Warsong, i.e. "international" guilds where you can play with people from all over the world in the same guild.
---
As an alliance main and a Brazilian, I'm screwed. The only BR realm with a sizable endgame scene is 99% horde, Brazilians are obsessed with the horde, unfortunately. This means I have to play on NA servers.
---
You don't need to level a hunter pet after taming it. Or have it auto level to your level minus 5. Leveling a pet requires 1/4 the experience it takes to level yourself. So if you are level 60 and have to go tame a level 13 lupos, then your need to level from 13 to 60 all over again but 4 times faster. You also don't get xp from doing quests so it's 100% farming mobs. So if it took you 8 days of /played to get to 60 then it's going to take you 2 days to level your pet. So at 12 hours a day that's 4 constant days of doing nothing but grinding mobs by yourself since your pet is a weak bitch. 
---
I'll never go through that again. I'm only taming high level pets. if there is a valuable low level one it can fuck right off. 
---
Fuck you Lupos I hate you.
---
Yeah and how there's gonna be different addons for classic than the main game.
---
The simple solution is to become the raid leader
---
They made changes to vanilla and reset often.
---
Fairly sure they did confirm that. Said basically there are addons that do the same thing. Myself, and everyone seems to be fine with it.
---
If you play oomkin you better have guild master as your best friend
---
Problem being another fire mage stacks better than the boomie... 
---
Will you always have another mage you can bring? Probably, but I prefer the boomer if hes reliable, but the dps argument doesn't actually hold in my experience

If you got rank 14 with a full time job, your server was really slacking=D
---
Research and own experience says that the name stays associated with your account for 30 days (on retail). If you want to use the name on another account you can ask a GM to unlock the name for you earlier.
---
However, I don't know if the 30 days rule applies to characters below a certain level.
---
I'm concerned that if blizzard names the classic servers what they originally were, the massively imbalanced retail servers are going to transfer over to them. Stormrage on US for example is like 90% alliance on retail currently.
---
I don't know between a warlock or a mage I like them both equally. I'm a PvPer and never played vanilla

I wish the default UI for WoW wasn't so garbage. Even in BFA it's so bad you basically have to alter it somehow, but I think thats a normal part of WoW. Even in the [first ever MC clear](https://youtu.be/Br1hXGXJ7Tg) they had addons. So it's technically blizzlike to use them.

*Look at all these little things! So busy now! Notice how each one is useful. A lovely ballet ensues, so full of form and color. Now, think about all those people that play them. Technicians, engineers, hundreds of people, who will be able to farm for honor tonight, so those PVP ranks can grow up big and strong and have buy mounts and weapons of their own, and so on and so forth. Thus, adding to the great chain of life. You see, OP, by causing a little destruction, I am in fact encouraging life. In reality, you and I are in the same business.*

Torn between Paladin and Shaman. I feel like I'll have more fun with Shaman, they have a much higher skill cap and more outplay potential in PvP.
---
However, nostalgia is making me lean towards Paladin (was my main in vanilla), never played Horde in vanilla either. Haven't messed around on P servers at all.
---
Give in to nostalgia and relive the "good ole days" or go for a new experience this time around?
---
&gt;  No, because its included in your normal WoW sub 
---
But they can tell who's playing Classic and who's playing Retail and if the majority of the subs were playing Retail then it wouldn't matter if they are on the same sub, they would still be losing money if the Classic players stopped and potentially gain more money by putting more into Classic.
---
Not that I necessarily think that the sub counts would get that high, or get expansions out to Wrath. I don't think that it wont either, no opinion either way.
---
There is a draenei in tbc named after Oprah Winfrey, clearly she had some influence in the development of tbc.
---
I was priest on a private server and raided a lot. For shadow it‚Äôs almost impossible to get into a raid with only 16 rebuff slots. You also run out of mana very quickly and won‚Äôt be doing much damage compared to other pure spa classes. 
---
I also planned to go shadow but I ended up healing which can be fun in 5 mans but can sometimes be boring in raids. Never fell in love with priest but I never hated it. 
---
If you have any other questions feel free to ask.
---
Tokens give 30 days of play time I believe you buy tokens on AH and click the token to ‚Äúactivate‚Äù
---
I remember my cousin nabbed the epic sword from sunken temple on his hunter. The melee dps understood the true classic wow experience that day.
---
Thats why there is a ‚Äûlow level mage‚Äú in the picture. Good luck fighting a lvl 60 rogue as a level 38 mage üòÇ
---
Vis'kag the Bloodletter.
---
I was the single combat rogue in our guild who regularly topped the damage charts. As soon as that dropped, everyone knew it was going to me.
---
Can't argue against that though.
---
That's your only retort to facts? Sad.
---
Thanks for sharing this. I think a lot of people will dismiss it because it's not traditional.. "druids are best at fc therefore don't even try to support with burst damage.
---
They forget that it's about fun. This seems really fun, I might try it out sometime when I'm bored of flagrunning.
---
Getting lots of crits back to back probably melts people, and of course with the support potential you can give with heals/roots/hibernates/faerie fire etc. I'll bet you'd have some really interesting encounters
---
And people say you can't raid as Arms warrior. Jokes on them.
---
Check out the guilds grizzly and progress, but i doubt they will get a week one rag kill, I bet the guild onslaught  will though, those boys are on a entirely different level of hardcore and preparation. If you do the math, it's feasible but nuts to be 60 by day 7 of release. 
---
 So depending on the drop off domo chest, and between those three guilds will likely see a bene by week 2 for sure if not day 7 of week one if domo is good to them.
---
That gun was pretty much bis pre-leaf in MC, definitely a good drop from your hunter
---
I'll take option C: Blizzard takes an active stance against gold sellers. But that would require Blizzard to spend money to improve their game, so unlikely.
---
Even if that happened, is that really a problem considering druids were also the worst healers.
---
&gt; druids in moonkin form drink in combat.
---
LMFAO
---
Yeah rank 10 is possible. Rank 11 there is a barrier of top 1% or something on your faction that get the rank each week iirc. Rank 11 would be harder for casual playing
---
"can" being the operative word. It doesn't mean they will be using VMs for this.

I feel particularly burnt out but I'll try my best, they started off as neutral, their quest givers were typically portrayed as either pure evil or choatic good. Whether thats collecting skulls and digging up graves to abuse the remains, or the actual formation of the weapon used by the Apothecary Society which started with the player all the way back when in Tirisfal. What I've noticed is that people often tend to inject themselves in to their character, or they look at things not objectively, but through the veil of what ever the politics of the time are.
---
Just by glancing over the modern forums the distinct impression I get is that the most passionate Horde players rolled them to played Thralls' Horde back in the day and they aren't too happy about being given the villain bat because the whole point of the story arc (partciularly) the orcs, or the central theme, is striving for redemption in a world that's hostile to them for good reason.  I also who see people who seem to be as I said injecting politics in to the situation, viewing them as minorities and because of that, they think of the Alliance as an opressor as ludicrous as that sounds.
---
The Forsaken in general though are outright portrayed as filled with hate and malicious, the Horde was only ever about an Alliance of convenience as outright stated during their introduction. They've always been straddling the line between moral grey but are often portrayed as evil apart from outliers like Leonid Barthalomew the Revered.
---
What does it mean ?
---
I'm also almost certain my friends will not keep up subscriptions with me. Neither of them played vanilla. One played BC and the other didn't play much of anything. I may just roll an alliance elsewhere in my own time. Who knows?
---
No idea why drinking in combat would be minor? You'd never go oom
---
I quickly used wowhead's model viewer to make a similar image comparison as the OP, but this time switching it around so the Vanilla model screenshot is taken at the awkward moment and the Moderm model screenshot is taken at the normal moment.

You want all secondary professions
---
Then mining blacksmith is a good choice 
---
Maybe engineer as wel
---
The content needs to be understandable without the title
---
I didnt see any facts.
---
Looking for an EU alliance guild. I can play a few hours most evenings and during some working days. Personally looking to dive into pvp and clearing pve for general progression. Mostly looking for the social aspects in a guild. Bonus points if the guild has people that have played vanilla, as we'll all be adults with our own lives and subsequent expectations.
---
Also just want a group of people I can share my hype with!
---
Fishing and cooking are secondary professions that anyone can have in addition to their primary professions
---
Those are secondary professions. Absolutely get them and first aid.
---
&gt; different zones
---
Ally detected. The Barrens is a right of passage for every member of the Horde.
---
Fishing and cooking are secondary so you can pick them up along with whatever main professions you want. Personally I will be rolling with engi + bs.
---
Fishing, cooking and first-aid are secondary professions, so you can roll all those three in addition to say mining and engineering
---
I'm all for hybrid classes, but moonkin is so completely broken that it isn't worth it.  If a fight goes over about 2 minutes long you'll typically see the Moonkin have to just go melee the boss or stand around.  The moonkin serves no purpose and is simply a player being carried in the 40 man raid.  After a while of doing this other players might get salty because of that.
---
That said, feral druids and shadow priests are really useful along with enhancement shaman being nice too.  Moonkin is just one of the most broken specs that shouldn't be brought to raids.  Pvp is another story.
---
Well its your lucky day because both fishing and cooking is secondary profession meaning you can have those plus two primary professions such as engineering and mining
---
We aren't perfect
---
You can find a ring called the 1-Ring via fishing. That might be a reference to the trilogy of novels from J. R. R. Tolkien called ‚ÄúThe Lord of the Rings‚Äù.
---
If you‚Äôre willing to spend $$ on a sub at all, I‚Äôd probably do that for a few months on release before buying tokens with your gold. 
---
The release is going to drive the price of tokens up significantly so you‚Äôll get more bang for your gold once the hype dies down a bit.
---
Sharding isnt to prevent ghost servers. It's to handle initial population. If you do the math (assuming 2k5 total pop, split evenly across all races) then Valley of Trials will have over 600 people in a non-sharded server. There's not enough mottled boars for that.
---
Make shakes with

1) Protein powder

2) Oats

3) Milk / water

4) Spinach

I only know one thing: Orc Shaman. Everything else is up in the air. We starting fresh boys!
---
Same. 3 pieces of T2 was BiS for Priests until Blizz nerfed it in early TBC to a flat mp5 amount. Before the nerf the only time I swapped them out was on the Romulo + Juliet fight to have enough stam to avoid the random instagib.
---
I was under the impression that Insect Swarm was like the best PVP spell druids had.  Most people go half resto at least to Insect Swarm for PVP.
---
I remember having SO MUCH crap in my bags as a Rogue, it wasn‚Äôt even funny. 4-5 types of poison, Blind powder, flash powder, lockpick tools, pickaxe, 3types of engineering tools.
---
Of course, I never had to worry about carrying keys, so it evened out. Until they added the keyring.
---
You pop will of the forsaken, and then ice block. Give yourself some time to figure out what to do next. 
---
Oh... You're not undead? Well there's your first problem.
---
\&gt;  90% of the dps pool being warriors and rogues 
---
Lol.
---
I mean yeah, then theres no reason to spec resto and you're just trading one spec for another. And a healer being able to drink in combat would just be blatantly overpowered along with them being able to do damage too? It would also invalidate every other healing spec in the game lol.
---
Fuckin' deleted.
---
Healing meters don't matter, they never really do.
---
Only think that matters is keeping people up and having low overhealing
---
Non-priest healers will always be in demand, because it makes no sense to miss out on utility and have gear go to waste
---
That makes me more happy to go for hole/prot
---
Ill have good healing, possibility to do good damage and ill have blessing of kings and possibly sanc too.
---
yea.. the timezone problem was the next poste, not much i can help with there, have no clue how other timezones raid =X.. back in vanilla i played a priest with taloring/enchanting and loved it.
---
Just fishied lvling one more some weeks ago on a P-server with the same profs. tho i farmed  from 52- 55 mats for bis items and 55-60 DMe to make gold for bis items. 
---
tho no DMe in classic. but you could farm more essence of water/felcloth enchants
---
&gt; i plan on creating a group to kill them mercilessly over and over until they leave the zone or log out

You would still have a better chance than a low level rogue vs a 60 mage.
---
If I can count pserv experience:  I was recently loot counciled a BRE as a ret paladin (holy in raids).   Words cannot describe how ecstatic I was.
---
If only actual vanilla counts:  I played a feral druid, but I wanted Mograine's Might b/c it looked so dope (gotta get that stand-in-city mog) and had decent mid-range stat....I remember tanking 14 Cath runs in a row before I finally got it to drop (and of course was so over leveled I barely used it for a level or two before replacing).
---
So I want to pick a class that has **STRONG** 1vX playability. I was originally going to roll rogue but I feel as though in 1v1 they are gods but in a 1v3 situation a mage might do better. So I'm leaning towards mage. They have strong CC and high dmg output and great endgame progression. I was also considering shadow priest but they are more heavily 1v1 focused and OOM really quick. Warlock was another idea but from what I've read they blow up once their fully geared this making my playtime as a mage slightly more enjoyable while obtaining end game gear? I'm at a loss.
---
As a Druid main on a private server, I have turned away many a Moonkin. Largely based off of gear for the most part but its truly bottom of the barrel for fights longer than about a minute and a half. The truly try hard Moonkin deserve a chance, the Tom Brady's of the Moonkin world with a chip on their shoulder willing to do whatever it takes to compete. Those are my guys. To the casual Moonkin, I wish you good luck but I am all set.
---
I wouldn't just consider raids for their PvE experience. Mage is a lot more than just spamming frostbolt. That's the case in raids, but dungeons and leveling can be quite the challenging and fun experience.
---
Good mage who is on top of CC can really shine and carry a group. Your sheeps will be broke and there will be bad pulls and you'll be the one trying to save the group from wiping, not just spamming frostbolt.
---
I don‚Äôt know about a lot of outplay potential, you only have a tremor, earth shock and grounding. It‚Äôs more about the playstyle. You heal your warrior buddy, drop a windfury, purge and nuke the target and hope melee don‚Äôt sit on you. It‚Äôs more about offensive pressure than control.
---
Ok, that's understandable. But can you explain why this was removed?

Here's a comparison that, instead of like the OP's, attempts to show the modern model in an awkward pose, instead shows the Vanilla one in an awkward pose and the modern one in a normal pose:

As far as leveling goes I'd definitely pick up cooking. Get fishing later on when you want to chillax and just fish some stuff up but DEFINITELY get cooking for leveling and make sure you loot enough stuff to keep it leveled up. 
---
As you level up you get white rareity meat that sells for a couple copper, maybe a silver each. You spend 5-30 silver on 5 pieces of meat just for normal food. So already instead of selling white meat at a loss you cook it up and get a gain. And on top of that this food has stats on it like stamina and spirit which will 1) Increase your HP and 2) increase your HP regen rate. All and all a great investment of time while leveling up. 
---
Other professions while leveling that I'd take would be Mining / Skinning. Mining you are going to out level very quickly and running around looking for copper veins especially on launch will NOT be worth it. IT will be flooded with people and a complete waste of time. My Recommendation is mine things as you see until you out level it and just sit on it until 60 or you want to take a break from leveling and go back and do it. 
---
Skinning I'd just pick up because vendoring things for money at 40-45ish will be great. 
---
After you hit 60 go engineering. Its the best.
---
First aid another leveling skill and even post 60 skill that will come in handy all the time. Decrease downtime during leveling and can save your ass. 
---
GL my friend.
---
Im definitely going purist mode. Just a few addons like KTM, Atlasloot and OmniCC. And ofc something to help me move my portraits. 
---
OTher than that none.
---
It does prevent it though. Because the alternative would be to have a lot of servers to accomodate for the initial surge.
---
You can login to the char select screen of your account right now without a sub. But you will not be able to login with any character that is level 21 or more.
---
But, if you have enough gold on all your chars combined you'll get a pop up that asks you if you would like to buy a month of subscription with it. Of course, you don't do that, because the subscription would start running immediately, but at least you know if you would have enough gold. If not, it's only going to get more expensive with Classics release.
---
mages are probably the best at 1vX (if you're good at them). You've probably seen all of the mage pvp videos - bear in mind those players are very good and if you haven't played mage before you won't be able to do that. To be honest you're probably better off playing what you're most experienced with / enjoy the most.
---
reliability.
---
No.  Going hard with consumes such as juju flurries, and other short term dps pots and they still struggle to keep up with an optimal specs using baseline consumes
---
All weapon is Hunter weapon
---
These are pserver numbers though so you need to keep in mind that the pservers have paladins doing more damage than they did in vanilla.
---
I know I did a bit of cooking in TBC, so I guess this is one of those cases where memory fudges things up
---
I'm pretty sure of all the meme specs in classic, oomkin is the absolute worst
---
Would be nice to have a big poll again to see what everyone is planing on playing. I prefer playing some race/class combo that is not too overplayed. 
---
I know people are a bit tired of polls but it was a while since the last one and with all the theorycrafting going on here maybe people's choices have changed.
---
old AV = Best Av
---
Yep it doesn't matter how you swing it, you're gonna want mining and your choice if you want cloth gear or access to the best spell reflect trinkets in the game. I'm gonna try tailor mining and focus on powerleveking to 40 for mount before touching professions. If I can get a bunch of copper early on while grinding that's great but I'm not going out of my way for it.
---
And this is why i¬¥ll be playing on a PVE server.
---
Roughly, I remember it being kind of hard to predict unless you were on super flat terrain
---
I think you'll have more fun with a mage and not have to worry about resources like a lock does. All those soul shards..
---
You made some good sense until you said every other druid you bring is a waste.
---
As if you have no idea how gearing works in wow raids.
---
Having 9 priests and 1 druid will net you less healing than 7 priests and 3 druids because the druids will be better geared, and so will the priests
---
All Ive thought about is the mouse I want to buy
---
straight out the ass
---
Hey!  I've been down the same road a few times.  
---
\-I'm assuming Paladin is out (you seem to be more horde since you mention Shammy, but left out pally).  Pallys would be good with a hunt/mage for the heals, buff and what not (blessing of freedom would be awesome for a hunt/mage).  Plus you'd be melee and have little gear competition with the heavier armor options.  I love the idea of a pally, but the gameplay doesn't quite do it for me, so it might be "a pain in the ass to get into" depending on your play style.  High raid demand.
---
\-Shammy is great.  Similar reasons to the pally.  I find them to be more fun.  They feel more.... offensive.  The buffs and healing pro still stands.  They have totems that would compliment the control mages and hunters offer.  Might have some gear competition, but that's not really a deal breaker for me, but something to consider.  High raid demand.
---
\-Warriors are also pretty cool.  Again no gear competition.  A little more tanky, but a hunter pet would be a pretty decent replacement in questing.  They take a little getting used to, but I remember really enjoying my warrior all the way to 60.  I feel like there will be less demand for warriors in raids, since dps wars will be a dime a dozen and each guild will only need a couple prot wars until naxx.
---
\-Warlocks are OP and are anticipated to be under represented.  Gear competition with the mage, not with a hunter.  Good raid demand.  Good dps and control.  I personally find them tedious, but a lot of ppl swear by them.
---
\-Priest/druid would also be worth considering imo.
---
\*obligatory play what you want, cuz anything will work and you can eventually get into a guild with anything at some point.
---
I'm sure other ppl will chime in, and some may attack for asking this question.  It's fun to think about and it's really a hard decision to make.  At the end of the day it is true to play what you want.  We have difficulty deciding because all the classes have their pros and cons.
---
If you go mining engineering though you won't clog up your own bank as badly. I recommend that. Keep all cloth
---
A song of 15$ or not
---
Can you please explain ?
---
Epic pvp gear is a massive time investment, r14 is literally going to be 24/7 honor farming for months. Always funny to me when people who have never played vanilla say they‚Äôre gonna get r14 and have no idea what that really entails, you quite literally need to be spending every waking hour in game honor farming, assuming your server has lots of other people also going hard for r14z
---
Well.that is where my mind comes
---
also, i'd say priest would be faster to level (on launch). mages are only really t1 levellers when you can aoe grind mobs (which you likely won't be able to on server launch).
---
Pros: I play WoW for free.  
---
Cons: YouTubers make annoying videos that Acti-Blizzard is a greedy and terrible money-hungry pay-to-win gameplay company.
---
Wow I didn‚Äôt know y‚Äôall added it to Spotify!! That‚Äôll definitely help!
---
The truly try hard deserve a spot but you really cant half ass moonkin/ret/enhance and expect to get anywhere near another pure dps class that is half assing it. The full consume min maxer guy will find his way to a raid without too many problems. 
---
But if you are that try hard why not grab another class that in some cases can literally do double the damage? It's a catch 22- if you want to play and be casual playing whichever spec you want on lesser desired classes you cant expect to be finding easy way into a raid. And if you are so try hard you have to prove your worth and make a point, why aren't you playing a class that is optimized for maximum effectiveness?
---
Then there is the few in the middle, not quite over the top hardcore but beyond casual that will find their niche. But despite all of your work and dedication to your undesired/meme spec, it wont change the glaring issues these classes will continue to have.
---
900 DPS is 900 DPS
---
didnt ranks reset every month or so ? season?
---
the irony in, "so i'm thinking twink gives a more level playing field" lol  
---
I will be twinking as well!
---
Best choice for me was herbalism and alchemy. So much utility, there are even rage potions! I‚Äòd probably pick this again for leveling and later on selling transmutations.
---
Absolutely going to be doing it along with a ton of other people try xpoff.com  they have a classic section, its kinda quite cause most of us are talking via discord real id ETC.
---
I mained a rogue though from release, until horde paladins hit in TBC. I don't want to go though that punishment again :P
---
I'll either roll a Shaman, or Hunter this time. I've tanked, and ai've melee'd, so now it's time for something else. The Huntard approach does appeal to me most (class fantasy etc), but I know it'll be tough getting groups.
---
Everyone is going to tell you to go engineering, but if it doesn't interest you no amount of discussion will fix that.
---
As everyone is saying, go cooking at minimum to increase your leveling speed and save you a ton of money. Fishing pairs well but isn't required. First Aid helps reduce downtime and can save you a few deaths.
---
For your primary professions - herb\alchemy will give you some minor QoL while leveling (More healing potions\regen), and shouldn't really cost you too much in terms of gold. Vials cost a lot of silver later on, but early potions probably give you more than they cost.
---
I'll add another voice to the crowd for mining\eng, but if you're not interested in it herb\alch has its upsides, particulary for a warrior.
---
Best of luck - new to vanilla + warrior is definitely jumping into the deep end, soak it all up!
---
I've heard of hunters kiting him all the way to rends room, I would always just kite to the dark corner where the core hound boss was. Don't recall the name.
---
This is why I wanna prepare and make a kind of 'server poll' for when (if) the servers get announced.
---
People could vote horde/alliance on their preferred server, although it would just be their word. It would show peoples intentions, and they could end up being quite balanced ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
And what about some druid experience? Grinding life in 60 etc?
---
Yes, if done intelligently to not affect PvP balance and have the changes be really small.
---
But your suggestion is the opposite of intelligent (sorry)
---
8.2 is not confirmed to be the final BFA content patch.
---
Good luck with that flask come classic
---
Can‚Äôt you just bait Wotf with succubus seduction?
---
It does because the gear cap for twinks only requires gold, not account-sharing with someone in china
---
This is why i tailor
---
We dont know how world buffs will work come classic, but that 3% crit is largely negligible. You can stack plenty through other means, and yes that will be a flat dps increase to those mages- the caviat being that swapping you for another mage would outweigh that same dps increase that you bring. I main a druid on a private server and while those numbers may not be entirely accurate come classic, Moonkin in raiding pvp are really just not worth it.
---
Lol, yeah. I‚Äôve been doing some reading and I‚Äôd never be wearing even the Grand Marshall stuff as a Holy Paly even if I could get rank 14. I was under the impression Holy Palys wore cloth gear for raids so what exactly do we wear in PVP? So easy to be confusing.

Fifth Element is on Netflix right now

You're losing 9000-9999 RP per week to decay between rank 11 and 12, so you really have to grind a decent amount just to stay ahead of the decay.
---
I remember gold farmers getting out of hand mid-TBC.  At some point it seemed like Blizzard gave up on combating them.  
---
Why will this time be different?  
---
I get Warden is a slither of hope when it comes to botting.  But WTF are they going to do about gold sellers?
---
Blizzard can't control the population of the realms, it's up to the players to decide where they want to go. They can however put a population cap on a realm, though it doesn't mean it will reach that cap.
---
its all about how much honor you can get, during that time. But you would have to spend all ingame time pvping. maybe even wait for bg's to start pvp. Since 2hrs a day hunting for honorkills wont be much.

The following actions may be considered dishonorable but are considered legitimate PvP tactics and will not be addressed by our Game Master staff:
---
* Corpse camping
---
* Killing players well below your level  
---
And nothing mentions watching a streamer to find their location to kill them. There was one about about doing it in ranked SC, but blizzard just considers it unsportsmanlike.  
---
Take Away Message - You pick a PvP Server and broadcast your location, you are fair game.
---
So the first part is right but the 2nd part is bullshit.
---
I was raid MT from TBC prepatch through current retail on a paladin and we ate server firsts like they were candy. The TBC prepatch changes put the Paladin on equal footing with the warrior as MT and in many cases far ahead of them. 
---
There was one niche where the warrior was the clear choice: caster bosses. Literally everything else was up for grabs.
---
If they managed to catch even 10% of people who buy gold and hit them with the ban hammer I bet hardly anyone would take that risk.
---
Me Personally, I would flag for a 1v1 situation and use a small nuke like smite on the person to see if they wanted to fight, then engage.
---
I think you underestimate the majority of players leveling capabilities and time. I would wager more then 60% of the player base is not 60 when phase 2 comes out. The game is going to be VERY crowded for the first couple of weeks, so it is going to be rough to get moving unless you are one of those crazies that can dedicate 14 hours a day.

That aside, yes, phase 2 is light on PVE content as the original game was still developing the content. This time around, everything is there and I am just guessing that the phases will be quicker then we think. Not sure why I feel that way but I do. As you can tell, I am apprehensive to be on a pvp server with the state of the PVP rewards. I think pvp on PVE servers will be abundant as that is the only way to get BIS gear. So, I agree, this is a once in a lifetime experience for the honor system. I think PVE will have a ton of pvp going on, and the ability to choose when to fight.
---
Me Personally, I will be grinding pvp as often as I can in phase 2 because the rewards are just too good. I am confident I am of a majority of pve players who realize that phase 2 is going to be a lot of fun pvping when we feel like it. 
---
In short, I have been burned enough times and been camped enough on pvp servers to never want to waste that time. I have way less time now then when it first came out, and I got frustrated then. The idea of not being able to access a quest or a zone entirely is just too much for me. PVE and the ability to choose when to pvp is where I am heading. I know there is a huge community that is already set on pvp servers. I hope the gameplay is balanced and fun for you guys.

Smack em in the face.  Rinse and repeat.  
---
You scale very well with your weapon so your focus should be to obtain a two hand weapon from lv20+ 
---
And to have a Idea what weapons you want every 5-10 levels. 
---
I levelled a shaman 1-70 in TBC ally only back then.  I prepared my alt with a ton of weapon in the bank.  
---
Also note that WC and and SM is fantastic for you (mail from lv40).  
---
Enhancement is great for instant ghost wolf.   
---
Same goes for Druid. Go feral as your faster and got great synergies between forms. 
---
Try to find gear that spread stats all over all stats as it‚Äôs often better for you.
---
I have been feeling that same way. I have been really wanting to play Warlock. In the original they were underplayed, but super strong. I suspect now that everyone knows that, there will be a million warlocks. But when I look around, it seems like every class has the same problem if you put yourself in that camp.
---
Tough to get groups as hunter, maybe. But not tough to get loot in said group, because all gear is for hunters!
---
I don‚Äôt like 19 think as hunters simply reign supreme. I always enjoyed 39 or 49 twinks. I remember making a warrior tank spec that was unkillable lol. And then a fire mage at 49 with eye of flame that was insane.
---
talk about rekt
---
&gt; smiling like a dumbass
---
Sounds like a personal problem, man. :V A smile is a smile, and it makes every girl look cuter!
---
I reached rank 5 just grinding AV rep, over a very long period of time and without putting any effort otherwise or joining any other BG
---
Not to mention downranking a rank or two if needed on a longer fight.  Any caster goes OOM its just that boomkins do it quicker.  
---
Mana pot, demonic rune, mp/5 food, bow/mana spring totem, and spamming mage food between fights?  Cmon you'll be acceptable- not as much as a mage or lock but you just have to be on point and focusing a bit more to keep your efficiency as high as possible.  
---
It's easier for mages or locks, less mental energy required to do more damage.
---
and good melees do above 1-1.3k at that gear/buff level on the same boss.
---
Agreed, and I played as a rogue, the worst class in zerg warfare. Pretty much limited to behind-the-line ambushes on drinking clothies and ninjaing flags, which druids could also do and more
---
Dragon's Call

I remember how hard it was back in vanilla to buy certain items when leveling if you wanted a mount you stayed away from the auction house and when you found something you really wanted it was an incredible feeling. Even when I was at 60 trying to get into raid guilds you didn‚Äôt really have enough money to just gear your character and I played around 40+ hours a week so when you ran strat or Ubrs and you obtained that upgrade you needed so much it felt amazing, even when you your item got ninja looted I feel it brought you closer to the game because you just wanted to run it again. There are items that are BOE that will bypass a lot of this and I believe that would be a real shame for classic. 
---
I remember farming for hours in the plague lands tower to try to get the weapon enchant just so I could afford to enchant my Molten Core weapons with something other than life steal. 
---
You think you want tokens, but you don‚Äôt. It will feel so much better when you earn your gear and mounts. Farming runecloth for days to get faction to buy other faction mounts etc. If everyone has them it‚Äôs no longer special and to me that was what made classic so special. 
---
Sorry for the rant, I am as excited as you all, also nervous that they fail us with some of these decisions.

Actually, there‚Äôs aren‚Äôt any reason to keep a ret papa ‚Äúaround‚Äù because identical utility is provided by Holy

Yeah but they CAN close and open up servers depending on population statistics.

If one server has too many horde, close it, while leaving the alliance side open for sign up.

There will always be a demand for gold so there will always be a quantity demanded for certain real world currency prices.
---
**3 Options:**  
---
A) People who want to buy gold buy tokens
---
B) People who want to buy gold buy from gold farmers
---
C) People who want to buy gold buy from gold farmers and blizzard actively hunts down and bans anyone involved in this process. 
---
**Option A** positively impacts blizzard's quarterly reports (maybe not long term, but remember they are owned by a publicly traded company, so they care less about long term than Q) . **Option B** has a net 0 effect on blizzards quarterly reports. **Option C** negatively impacts quarterly reports, but increases the health and longevity of the game.  
---
Lets see what they choose.
---
not really but dalrends are.

The flask alone is almost 100g

If people want to no life the game and rush to 60, that's fine. I think it's dumb, but they're free to do what they want.
---
I hate and envy you for that. Congratulations though, I really get how you felt in that moment.
---
You know what the most frustrating thing about me trying to get Quel'Serrar was? I played until WotLK and kept running DM now and then to maybe finally see it drop. It never did. Then, a few years back, I played on a WotLK server, on the patch right after Onyxia was re-released, which was the patch that removed the quest from the game. The book still could drop, it was still epic, it just didn't offer you the quest. I ran DM alone just for fun, to see the old dungeons again. And that fucking book dropped off one of the named Guards in DM North. It was like the game was taunting me, I'm still pissed about that.
---
Well, maybe with Classic, I'll finally get my hands on that damned book.
---
Is that Kungen? Guy is a legend.
---
The Beast man. How do you forget The Beast?
---
Pretty sure most, if not all, of the times I've killed Drak he was just kited around his room.
---
I'm not wrong.
---
hmm, I don't recall placing a campfire outside super flat terrain - well, most of the times, I used inn fires.
---
Might be hard to have a kid in Taiwan level your account this time around. Blizzard tends to be sensitive to vast changes in IP address, unless said power levelers are using VPN, not sure I would risk it.
---
i'd recommend noting being the same armor type as your wife so you dont compete for gear. this would allow you both to gear up quicker.
---
Yeah I have experience as a mage and I'm an avid PvPer. I quit when cata dropped but I played disc priest, ret pally, marks hunter, and frost mage. The priest I had the most fun with for PvE content but the hunter and mage were a close a tie for PvP.
---
Realms sorted alphabetically, most players either scroll/sort all the way (realm names with xyz)to the bottom or pick one of the top realms (abcdef) I believe

---
Pro tip, keep you secondaries in par with your level
---
As primaries, start with skinning and enchanting. Keep skinning at the appropriate level (shouldn't be hard) for the zones you are in. Enchanting is only for disenchanting. Don't sell it immediately since no one really has money to buy it. Disenchant all bop items, all used items and all stuff with weird stat combo's that you can't sell on ah.
---
You save space in your bags, and whenever you are near a bank store it. Sell it when prices go up / when you need money for epic Mount.
---
When you are 60 drop both and go for 2 out of three : mining, bs, engineering. What you chose depends on your preference and whether or not you will have an alt.
---
Midnight, I can avoid the shit storm by sleeping.
---
I got one of these as well. It dropped from one of the plaguebats in Easter or Western Plaguelands for me while I was questing. I was super torn on whether to sell it or equip it, but in the end I decided to equip it. Was my first ever epic.
---
If you don't want to be ganked or participate in PvP roll on a PvE server...  its really not that hard.
---
It wasn't just 1 item but the entire scarlet set. My first character was a tauren warrior. Once I discovered set pieces from my first or secons run through SM armoury, I was on a mission go complete the set. I'd spend countless hours spamming runs to try to get the full 6 piece's tbh I don't remember if I ever even got it. But man the rush I got when seeing another piece drop was amazing.
---
According to wowhead the Staff of Beasts is a unique model.
---
vanilla was 5
---
Until one of them quits or decide to switch servers. Then the server turns into a wasteland
---
One word, toggle.
---
This discussion is going nowhere anyway, old models as the default and for people who want the new ones, said toggle
---
Trial and error here. Its all about muscle memory. Just start adding hotkeys for the buttons as you gain abilities/key items and fiddle from there. Everyone has a different taste.
---
Im with you.  NO TOKENS!  But how do you crack down on gold farmers at the same time????
---
PvE server.
---
HEADSHOT
---
spiritual attunement and hand of reckoning would not break pvp
---
I agree, but we also have a new phenomenon of Streamers this time. I don't know what the affects will be to the server population or game experience. 
---
During the classic Demo I think the Streamers and their band of groupies had a positive effect. If the streamers can agree on a server and keep the factions balanced it might be a fun server to be on once you get to 60. While leveling I can watch their streams and stay away from the zone if their is ongoing world pvp. Additionally once I'm 60 and phase 2 starts I think the most epic world pvp shenanigans will occur on the streamer servers.
---
Any leveling rogue will not be using daggers, but some people who want to go through the trouble will make weapon swap macros.
---
The only downside I can think of is that it led to more people buying gold, thus inflating the economy and leading to a ton of gold sinks in BFA.
---
People certainly did pay for WoW gold before, but due to the various factors such as having to buy them from shady websites and risk having your account banned, less people did so.
---
For me, I use a corsair scimitar which is one of those 12 button on the side mmo mices.
---
I use 1-9 on each bar with various modiferes. So first one is 1-9, then i have a bar each with shift, ctrl, alt and ctrl+alt(altered keyboard so caps = ctrl+alt). This means I have about 50 keybinds without even using the keyboard. I pref using keyboard mostly just for modifers but I do QER and a couple of modifers bound too.
---
As for keybinds, basically all the important keys on non modifer, somewhat important on shift/ctrl and rare cases on alt/ctrl+alt. Rare cases are mostly just consumables or buffs. For engineering items there's addons that can basically bind a key to that inventory space, and allow you to change items fast, so only one keybind for helm, belt, offhand and trinkets are required.
---
Hey, keeping my curse refreshed and pressing 2 is a lot of work
---
I've only had a mouse with 2 buttons on the side and it has served me well as a mage in pvp without engineering.
---
For #1 - I'd say its because we are all bored to tears, and consuming as much info/news/etc is the one way to somewhat scratch the itch.
---
It's possible, but right now I don't see a better system other than "The guy who tagged the civvy gets the DHK". It'll always be somewhat of a quagmire.
---
Pretty sure you rock felhunter full time while pvping, I could be wrong though.
---
That settles it. The PTSD I have from being warrior, rolling against other warriors, paladins, and hunters - I'm feeling cloth based class is the way to go.
---
Oh right, how come do the trainers then warn me if I buy a new profession that it will rule an old one away or something like that, don‚Äôt really remember
---
Behold the almighty thunderchicken!
---
Slow people in general. This game is basically 80% standing around and traveling. People who waste time in this game are literally the worst. Idiots who don‚Äôt understand simple game mechanics, even after spending over a hundred hours playing their character, come in a close second. 
---
Lastly, the reaction time of wow players never ceases to amaze. It‚Äôs also always combined with backpedaling and keyboard turning after a good three seconds to comprehend that they fucked up.
---
I don‚Äôt really think it was that big of a problem I remember all the weird stuff they would do like dying to form a website on the ground and spamming every zone but to me it was part of the game, and messing with gold farmers who were in plaguelands to me was really fun. Hell we brought them into groups sometimes just to fill late night and would just master loot so they could steal and most of the time they would do well. Even in classic if you bought gold I‚Äôd say you were on the low end and most players never even dared to risk being banned.
---
When I started wow in 2005 I think there was a suggested choice of realms when starting the game, that's how I ended up on Vol'Jin
---
If they decided to bake Lazypig into the game no one would complain.
---
Int&gt;stam&gt;spirit=str are your 4 lowest needs as hunter. Your abilities do use mana, it's your fault if you run out however. The int gear would be much more useful for a caster (hunters are not casters)
---
that's only for the primary professions that you can only have 2 of, like mining or engineering
---
I'm not reading any guides, tips, tricks, or anything. I never experienced Classic as I started playing in BC. Even then, I was only a wee boy and never got to do endgame content for BC when I was 12, and I didn't truly fall in love with the game until WOTLK.
---
I unsubbed very quickly after WoD came out and haven't played since. 
---
I'm really looking forward to playing Classic with a fresh mind. I'm hoping to recapture to total infatuation I had with Azeroth when I was a boy, since I am experiencing a lot of content for the first time, as well as revisiting some aspects of the game I wish I encountered more of.
---
I'm looking forward to the unique class quests I'll get, running dungeons the way they were intended, and meeting strangers along my path.
---
I just don‚Äôt have any faith in what blizzard has become to pull off something like that lol
---
Moonkins are perfectly fine in dungeons. some dps, some off-heals, some CC with roots and hibernate, and an emergency rez.
---
What's not to like?
---
Gold isnt being created or destroyed with token.  Its being transferred from one player to another.  So inflation or deflation of the economy does not take place.  
---
I'm 100% NO TOKENS, but not without the stopping of gold farmers.
---
I mean it kinda is actually. So is Zin'rokh
---
And you can always respec to Engineering later when you got money to blow :)
---
I‚Äôm not sure how it was in original vanilla but I am just translating what I presume he meant with the alphabetical thing. I definitely remember recommended realms though, I always skipped them and went to the High populated ones lol
---
Thank you for pointing this out.  Correction made.  The times are as listed, for a total of 8 hours.
---
I wasn‚Äôt being sarcastic, totally agree!
---
I use Vanilla ElvUI :3
---
MOOOOOWHHHNFIHAAAAAAA 'yall!
---
We'll there were defiantly caps and balances to some things.  If I remember correctly warlocks could go in with tier gear and do fairly well, but knowing your opponents gear was another important factor.
---
How was that Soul Fire an instant cast? I must be missing something.
---
Unless you are hardcore.  Then you sword and board forever.
---
better money tracking systems ?
---
Lol maybe everyone feels the same of their preferred class and I'm just biased thinking everyone wants to play mage. 
---
It was pretty clear in the last poll however that we will need more people to tank.
---
I figured lol Hunters4evah
---
IF the shadow priest is wanding the entire time!
---
That is an interesting perspective. Except I think you might want to consider phase 2 world pvp. By then the tourists may have stuck around long enough to ding 60 and once phase 2 starts they won't be tourists anymore. I think they will stay as long as the streamers do.
---
Feels like rank 7-8 realistically, sorry. It will depend on the realm situation and you might be more lucky.
---
People say that you can get r10 "casually" but it really depends on your definition of "casual". I contributed 300-350k honor weekly and spent approx. 4-5h playing per day on average and the progress really slowed down at the late rank 8-9 and had to increase the amount of honor gain to ~450-500k per week and respectively, the time contribution to 6-7h daily to achieve r10.
---
A token cost $20 to buy correct?
---
Feathers I guess.
---
A mage without a weapon, wearing a no-stat Twill hat.
---
Agreed.  Doesn't that thought inherently suggest that we're bored with retail?
---
some of the tbc changes for paladins
---
* spiritual attunement
---
* mp5 on bosanc
---
* on crit to on hit for redoubt and reckoning
---
* freedom salv and protection as hands instead of blessings
---
* hand of reckoning
---
* exorcism and holy wrath useful on all targets
---
thats a list the #nochanges people will shit on, but i would not be at all surprised to see blizzard implement some of the tbc tweaks on hybrid classes at or shortly after launch. blizzard knows they did a shit job at class balance and they were working on fixing it.
---
Husband and I will be twinking. Dual rogues for all that fun fuckery!
---
Some people will be more concerned with having fun, and some people will be poop-socking their way to server first on 15 year-old content.
---
I draw the line around the point where mechanically you need to put less into the game. 
---
An addon that plays your rotation perfectly or one that moves you out of ground effects is fundamentally different to one that simply tells you what you should do next or advises you that you are standing in a ground effect.
---
The guy on the shirt is Kungen
---
I usually use the ring-finger one for reactionary instant cast spells like ice block/FD/death coil etc.
---
One further note, players like Swifty who on stream talk about how many tokens they will buy so they have this massive amount of gold ready for classic have an end goal and will get to it, he sees the game a lot differently than most, I am sure he likes it but the streamers are a different breed. They will be playing to entertain you, they have been playing for a very long time and the easier translation for them to get back into PvP dominance or high end raids the better but for the average player you really will be missing out on everything that made classic what it was. 
---
I am in no way attacking the streamers who want this to happen but just remember if if they love the game they have other motives than just experiencing classic all over.
---
That's a good point actually, thanks for the correction!
---
And mhm, I'm against tokens in Classic, but am also curious what their alternative to stopping gold farmers will be.
---
You'll need a guild song. Here is a good choice:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPrtFxd9u9Y
---
There's dozens of us. DOZENS! I'd rather go for class fantasy over absolute min-maxing. Class fantasy means wearing plate at all costs.
---
Lol the third one has a subtle spelling
---
That's a lotta gold to do as much damage as my Imp.
---
I'm wondering this too. I guess the MC gives him 'special powers'
---
I you don't want to risk being banned, don't go harass other players.
---
Wow, is that a thing? Here, I thought it was just my experience...
---
I‚Äôm not against toys *existing*. And yeah, I know it‚Äôs a game, not trying to be hyper realistic or anything, but non-realism isn‚Äôt what breaks immersion. It‚Äôs an over-abundance of silliness usually, most of the toys are *so quirky*. Which is fine to me, *if* there isn‚Äôt 50 of those per expansion.
---
Other side notes, I think vanities, hairstyles, emotes, and xmog stuff is great, and would be great for retail. That‚Äôs more of an even spread of cool shit, compared to my experience with WoD. Also, I know this wasn‚Äôt the point you were making, but one thing I‚Äôm looking forward to with Classic (and even BC to an extent) is that mounts are much simpler. We‚Äôre just pulling horses and wolves out our bum, and not choppers, mega-mecha-Porto-dragon-lords, and floating gas discs. All sorts of wild mounts are sweet for retail, but I like having a simplistic RPG kind of style, where the most otherworldly mount I‚Äôll see is a bug mount that nobody has.
---
I think that they meant that twinking allows you to faceroll the other 19s, 29s, 39s etc that aren‚Äôt twinked and are just in leveling gear.
---
The audience is probably a bit aged compared to less niche gaming audiences
---
I am tempted too. During the classic demo the streamers added to the experience like hunter bug pvp. There was definitely some shenanigans and I think phase 2 world pvp would be glorious.
---
I used the naga epic for about 4 years playing retail. I just bound the buttons to key combos in synapse then used the clique add-on to bind the spells so no interference with regular key binds.
---
Hmm, 40man raid. 20 casters, all casters are Balance druids.
---
Now, think about the benefits. Once everyone is alive, buffers start buffing and all Druids pop their innervates on the biffers. This makes entire raid buffed almost instantly, without the need for each buffer to drink 3 times.
---
Now, the battle starts. Once everything is ready and pulled, and once healers start to need innervate, the 3-minute cooldown is ready.
---
Let's say there are 5 healers. I'm sure that, with such amount of innervates, there would be no need for more. So, 5 druids cast their innervates on healers. 10 save their innervates for round 2, 5 top-geared moonkins cast innervate on themselves.
---
Now, round 2. There is a need for new innervates, and those who cast theirs in round 1, are on cooldown. Now, 5 balance druids cast their innervates on healers, and 5 on the top-geared moonkins.
---
And, the cycle continues.
---
Hmm, this even makes sense. Not only there is more room for damage dealers, but also you have 5 moonkins constantly bursting.
---
Now, let's discuss tanking........ :√ê
---
I dont think you have to look very far to come to that conclusion.
---
Probably. Remember to horde any twink blues in your bank until BGs are released and sell them to twinks for crazy money.
---
Everyone in the guild must have it playing on loop ultra loud whenever logged in on your moon toon
---
hoping for the original names as well, although i was on eu-talnivarr that was originally over-spill from deathwing-eu and stormscale-eu, so not sure which would be available or where some of the old names might re appear on.
---
&gt; . If a fight goes over about 2 minutes long you'll typically see the Moonkin have to just go melee the boss or stand around. 
---
DPS needs to average about 125 dps to kill Ragnaros before his second submerge. A pre-raid bis moonkin can average 250-280 dps perpetually without going oom by downranking Starfire.
---
Is 250-280 dps as good as a mage? Hell no. But is it good enough for T1 and T2 raids? Yes it is.
---
Hat of the Magi
---
Ran Doom nonstop for weeks, got nothing.
---
First arti drop ever - still rock hard
---
Even if the tokens are reasonable in game, most people won‚Äôt be able to afford the token and gold, it will more or less turn into a hardcore guild pot source and people will sell tokens so they can get more gold to play better, and normal players or poorer players will have a harder time getting into guilds and groups.
---
Hunter weapon right?
---
Yeah its still a miracle on how this happend, interrupted my shadowbolt and and shoots instant soulfire..
---
No, there was no seasons.
---
People seem to forget that pretty much every private server makes Black Lotus spawn at ridiculous rates compared to what it actually was in vanilla.  Unless you are in some cutting edge guild or get lucky chances are unless you are a tank or a healer you won't be using flasks.
---
Agreed. Popped up on my YouTube feed and enjoy listening to his vids at night.
---
I don‚Äôt really think it was that big of a problem I remember all the weird stuff they would do like dying to form a website on the ground and spamming every zone but to me it was part of the game, and messing with gold farmers who were in plaguelands to me was really fun. Hell we brought them into groups sometimes just to fill late night and would just master loot so they couldn‚Äôt  steal and most of the time they would do well. Even in classic if you bought gold I‚Äôd say you were on the low end and most players never even dared to risk being banned.
---
To be honest we're probably both talking out of our butts thanks to faulty memory
---
But yea inn fires were plentiful, in Classic I probably won't even bother with the inventory space required for a flint and wood
---
But no token AH sales in Classic, so how does he plan to have a "massive amount of gold" at launch?
---
Yeah, I was so relieved when they said loot trading wasn‚Äôt going to be in 5/10s. I don‚Äôt really want sharding *whatsoever*, but I concede that a limited use is what‚Äôs best, and what will happen.
---
Ideally, I hope they just split the 1-5 minizone into 2-4 shards, not 20. So, when you visit Goldshire, Stormwind, or Westfall, it‚Äôs not a night and day what-the-fuck moment. I‚Äôm still kind of worried they will over extend sharding, to make a majority of the game as ‚Äúsmooth‚Äù as possible, either due to complaints or fear or shrinking numbers.
---
I know the 2 streamers that he's talking about, there's no chance in hell either of them are quitting, especially considering they live and breathe Classic and have their own podcast.

---
It all really depends on how much honor other players on your server are getting. If you somehow get lucky and pick a server where not a lot people are really doing the PvP grind it won‚Äôt be too bad. But if you‚Äôve got a ton of players who are spending 10 hours a day grinding honor it will take some time.
---
So my friend decided to play Alliance recently. I now have to pick a new class. He is going Pally. We will be playing together a lot. Probably 2/3rds to 1/2 of my time will be played with him. We will raid together and PvP together. I would love to have a nice class duo. Warrior is an obvious choice but still worried about leveling and solo content at 60.  Warlock actually seems like a great combination. We could really work well together especially when I get gear and become tanky. I would also be fine on my own. Hunter would be another choice, cleanse and BoF would be great for a hunter. Any thoughts and suggestions?
---
I only read my way through questing the very first time i level alliance and the first time i leveled horde. (Okay fine, the real reason is I didnt know you could auto quest text). 
---
I tried it after the cataclysm again, nope.
---
Ive got mos vanilla quests committed to memory and enough online resources to look up the locations for the few I dont or have forgotten. 
---
But once questie comes out, probably a few weeks into the release, ill certainly be using it on alts. 
---
I like leveling, I enjoy being quick about it.
---
Right. So what class was the MT and OT1?
---
Is that confirmed? I was listening to a few people talk about buying and selling the tokens on classic ah.
---
Makes no difference as long as they give us a release date soon. 
---
I'm taking 2 weeks vacation with 1 extra day off before release so I can adjust my sleep schedule!
---
Endless AVs are bad for everything. Anyone who does defense in AV is doing it wrong.
---
Just spec inner focus!

I had dinged 60 and my rogue went on the back burner. Group of friends found the 19 bracket and the rabbit hole of twinking started. This is right around AQ release. Had a rogue with shadow fangs that I got for 6 gold each. Biggest grind for gear I had was the fishing gear tho. I spend the better part of vanilla and early BC every Sunday afternoon in STV fishing for boots and the hat. Me and a friend rotated every hour during each weekend so we didn‚Äôt kill ourselves of boredom. Needless to say he pulled two different hats and I got the boots. (https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/us/skywall/newdoc) most excited I‚Äôve been since gut ripper dropped in MC for my rogue
---
And presumably farm up to get mats to level engineering? You don't suggest picking up mining?
---
Thats a hot take.   
---
Gonna assume you started with Wrath? Or you started late BC and Wrath was the first expansion you played a full endgame of?
---
WoD and Legion ahead of BC is quite odd to see.
---
Every single class gets limited by threat. "Your dps is low because of threat" is the same as "your dps is low". Rets do way less damage than warlocks and mages, who also do spell damage. Hell, they do less damage than tanks.   
---
Also, there is no special thing about spell damage that gives you threat. Warriors get a threat reduction while they are in berserker stance. That is why they do so much more damage at equal threat levels.  
---
Ret paladins are just bad.   
---
Imagine a warrior using no abilities, praying for a double hit from HoJ or Ironfoe. That is basically a ret pally.
---
Ranks don't really reset. You lose a % of your rank points every week (called decay). Higher ranks take more and more rank points, and thus the amount of points you lose to the decay increases as well.
---
lol its not harassment to kill and/or camp others in pvp on a pvp server.
---
I'd say Warrior since they shine with a healer and holy pal is the best pvp healer. that duo would be unstoppable in pvp. If you guys are playing together a ton, it would work out great.
---
Bind them to mousewheel up / mousewheel down and you can be catatonic and scrolling down repeatedly with a bit of "up" thrown in every 30 sec or whatever for good measure.  Until you hear "DON'T STAND IN THE FIRE FFS"
---
Gonna be tough but fun. Just like I remember it. I remember I had one last chance to do deadmines get the cruel barb and succeeded. And then twinking died.
---
Yeah "girlfriend".
---
\#NOCHANGES I want my wow classic just as i remember with gold farmers and all!! /s
---
Druid, hunter, rogue are the ones from the top of my head.
---
I appreciate your enthusiasm for sarcasm, but to become a master you mustn't use /s.
---
*I'm a human being, and this action was performed manually.*
---
Hey Josh, just started getting into your podcast, really loving it - makes my commute fly by. Great questions and insights, keep up the good work!
---
Ok bud, they definitely didn't ban people for this back in the day and you definitely aren't risking a ban for it now, nope!
---
Decided on Lock, but:
---
Friends want Alli, I want Horde (nostalgia). I want pvp mainly
---
I like the undead look a lot more ( yes, drakedog lol) but I keep reading the Orc stun resist is superior. For Alli I would go Human, nit sure how it compares to gnome but I hate gnomes
---
Kinda unrelated but also my most important question because I dont remember it anymore:
---
How much different is the leveling experience Alli vs Horde? If I played Alli will I mostly be able to level in the same areas as Horde? Or is it very different and I'll have nostalgia blueballs?
---
Not true. Gouge ignores level difference so you can gouge the 60 mage and then you can vanish. Literally nothing the low lvl mage can do to get away from a 60 rogue
---
Isn't it better to vendor those green bop items Across most of the early levels?
---
Many people on private servers play 2h fury. 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LbhxkIbZVVzVMxkVo
---
Is a pretty good spec. You could drop anger management for 2/2 imp overpower, same goes for piercing howl, but since you want to pvp it's very nice to have.
---
Yeah it's a very strong defensive spec.  The harder people try to kill you the more reck charges you'll generate.  You're kind of like a PVP tank - once people see you healing/cleansing/blessing all over the place you'll become a target.   It's a very weak offensive spec though aside from reck bombs, so it's only utility in PVE is to just put on a dress and spam heals.  Which is still fine!
---
I have some heal pieces and a 1h/shield that I saw to if I'm doing PVE or if I'm in AV for example healing vs the warmasters, but the corrupted ashbringer and t2 / t2.5 comes out when it's PVP time!!
---
Did you duplicate it 8 billion times and saturate the economy on your server with it?
---
Thanks for offering but not interested in being on video.
---
All depends on your server but mabe you will be able to get the blue pvp gear.
---
I appreciate your promptness.
---
Yeah, I'll be playing paladin, I'd love to go ret but it's just not realistic, so I'll be going holy but I'm not touching cloth gear with a mile long pole
---
Tier gear should be good enough
---
Classic won‚Äôt have tokens 
---
Retail will
---
And they share. Subscription
---
I would like to know as well because that would crush the economy in classic.
---
Engineering is the go to PVP profession. It's necessary if you want to PVP at a high level.
---
Saved
---
I played a Warrior Tank in vanilla, but played ranged in later expansions. I'm thinking about either playing Mage or Warlock in Classic...but I'm having a hard time choosing between them. Is there anyone who played them that can advise me one way or the other?
---
Hey man, we are about 6 danish guys as well who looks forward to classic. Alliance PvP also.
---
Maybe we could find a guild together?
---
In my first UBRS run in real vanilla on my first 60, a rogue, Felstriker dropped. I won it with a roll of 100.
---
On my second UBRS run, Felstriker dropped. I won it with a roll of 100.
---
12 year old me was excited but didn‚Äôt understand how much time I saved myself and how ahead of the game and fortunate I was until Nostalrius came out 10 years later
---
do you happen to have a raid level talent build to include melee? I assume you take your points from bm and fill in mm and some of surv for this ?
---
No. They are a complete waste of a raid slot, and also a waste of gear. Why would anyone ever give someone dps gear if they aren't "brought to raid to dps"? Why would you take DPS gear from warriors and rogues when you yourself admit you don't do good damage with a ret pally? If you aren't brought to raid to DPS, but instead to use your abilities for utility, why not just heal then, which is something you actually do well?
---
Yup, started in late BC, peaked in wrath, played through cata, got bored at last raid, missed first couple months of mists, then Warlords came along and I had so much fun playing and levelling. Admittedly, the patch content was dire, but i fell in love with the music and aesthetic.
---
Stopped again at start of legion cause of uni, but joined near the end again which was also pretty fun.
---
T2 other than legs dropping in MC was not intended and fixed.
---
Still can‚Äôt believe Kungen race changed back in the day. It wasted All my interest haha
---
Option C is the only real bad option for blizzard. At least option B has the gold farmers paying for subscriptions. I agree option A is probably the best for blizzard but I trust the classic team to keep that shit out.
---
&gt;From a purely min-max standpoint
---
&gt; From a pure numbers stand point
---
9 geared priests, 1 geared druids &gt; 7 geared priests, 3 geared druids
---
Isnt there a spellpower plate chest in lbrs? I mean its not 68 healing from robes of the exalted
---
But its 18 spell power, 15 int 12 str Which seems more desirable overall if i could only have one and I like pvp and raiding.
---
Damn son, gz, that is a lot of gold. If you‚Äôre serious about getting tokens I would do it before the release date is announced as every ounce of hype will spike the price.
---
No because you can‚Äôt recognize that it‚Äôs based on China.
---
&gt; buy a token for real world currency and then sell said token on the AH in game and make 100k+ gold
---
Yes but ONLY on retail.
---
You can also buy a token ON RETAIL AH and so pay your Classic sub with gold since the same sub is shared between the 2 games.
---
So seeing those numbers, do you think you should ever get gear if you go to raid as a ret paladin? Why should you get any given piece of gear over a warrior or rogue?
---
Seems incredibly unlikely they implement tokens in classic. Literally no confirmation of them existing in classic. You can still use your retail wow to buy tokens for your subscription since it's the same sub, but you wont be buying or selling them in classic wow currency.

I thought it was a turkey
---
im imagining pvping with T2 and corrupted ashbringer with the def spec and it looks beautiful.
---
I have a G600 myself, and I'll never use another mouse.
---
The third button on the top, the far right, I use for toggling auto run.
---
\[1\]\[4\]\[7\]\[10\]
---
\[2\]\[5\]\[8\]\[11\]
---
\[3\]\[6\]\[9\]\[12\]
---
If you look at the buttons on the side like that, I use 2 and 5 for strafing, because they are where my thumb rests naturally. 1 I use for either a super powerup move, or an emergency defensive (ice block, etc.). 2 is usually some ranged attack on cooldown. 3 is usually a rare cooldown. 4 is always mount.
---
7 through 12 I don't use much, because my thumb hurts if I bend it back that way too often. 12 opens my character pane though.
---
Oh, and the button on the to that changes the DPI I rebound to open my inventory.
---
They haven't really given a difinitive answer on this one yet I don't think. If I'm mistaken someone please show me the source. 
---
It very well could exist. Since classic is basically "free" for everyone assuming they already have a BFA Sub (LMAO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) Blizzard will want to make money. I would not be surprised to see paid character transfers to different servers being a thing and over time classic tokens put in a store. 
---
I dont think that theyll be released right away, but I have a feeling in the future it will happen sadly.
---
The Savage Gladiator chest is BiS for warriors and hunters
---
How many more times are we going to have this discussion? Can we just get a sticky post to discuss ‚Äúhypothetical buffs for weak specs‚Äù?
---
You know what....I would be fine if they went for 100k on the AH in classic.  They would never be purchased.
---
*Skeptical optimism* has been my thoughts on classic wow so far and I haven't been disappointed. So if they do decide to do something like this I'll stay the course. :D
---
I opened the link and dps was 6 secs long, lol...
---
You're right, HoR has no effect in PvP and Attunements not good enough to carry an already weak PvP spec. But then there is an issue with one side having one more viable tank spec, Im sure it would offend quite a lot of players :)
---
Still, thats just one spec "fixed", and this one is by far the easiest to do.
---
There is a zero percent chance tokens cross over into classic. You can pay your sub with a token on retail but the tokens will never be on the classic side.
---
This reminded me that there‚Äôs a bridge on Teldrassil between Darnassus and the second city that always puts an A Perfect Circle song into my head. 
---
I think the feeling of youthful amazement at the zone‚Äôs beauty and me listening to the song at the same time forever burned that into my memory.
---
I don't need graphic improvement. I want classic play style, but new zones and quests and exploration. We should just ditch BFA all together and just add new content to classic wow. We've already explored Azeroth. Let's restart 1-60, whole new zones and adventure. Also I want my gear to matter and look cool. Thanks
---
r10 is easy tbh, the time it takes(how many weeks) depends on how much you put in every week, but eventually you will reach your rank. This is true up to rank 11.
---
Pro-tip if you're not sure: Join the server where a prominent streamer and/or content creator is joining. They will guarantee to bring a huge crowd with them.
---
As for faction balance, that is literally impossible to know beforehand until a few months down the line when the player base has more or less settled. You'll just have to hope and pray that the balance isn't too lopsided.
---
Also, I'm positive there will be server transfers. Blizzard are hardly going to pass up the opportunity for making money are they?
---
lol i might get a temp ban and ill just link them their own support page saying its fine to kill and camp people. Temp ban isn't the end of the world.
---
And mages can one shot you from range with spells you wont resist. Possibly even instantly. Seems like being able to kill from a distance and possibly instantly is to a greater advantage than requiring melee distance and time.
---

"If the guild master had put me on the raid roster, we'd have downed KT before TBC, no doubt. No doubt in mah mind..."
---
Just to confirm - whoever has left over gold in retail accounts can buy tokens on the AH, and exchange that for game time at Classic launch because they will share the same Activision account correct?
---
If so, would people use their Retail toons to farm for gold in exchange for tokens in the future as its easier to get?
---
I really want to play a Shaman as Ele.  Briefly raided on mine during Vanilla, was pretty fun.  That or Fire mage.
---
There are certain points where imp ambush will do 2/3 mob hp but you're right
---
Great stuff, love the video. Will use as a reference for exploring when classic launches!
---
You son of a bitch

you shut your mouth.  SHUT IT
---
IMMA START RIOT
---
What is the best class to Solo with that can contribute regularly to group/raid play?  
---
I am leaning towards warlock at the moment, but want some thoughts. Only melee class I might play would be an enhance shaman. Never played one past level 50 early on. Are they strong in raids late?  
---
What are your thoughts?
---
What did he change to?
---
I'm not opposed to auto attacking, honestly, but is it really slow leveling? I'm currently deciding between Shaman and Paladin for healing, and while Shaman looks more appealing, I think my friends/guild will be rolling Alliance. I don't want to play Priest (I did that in vanilla and really disliked it) and the fact that Druids don't have an out of combat rez is really annoying.
---
You will burn yourself out if you are not regularly physically active by running and thinking it will be the most beneficial activity.
---
A slower pace at an incline is more sustainable and will keep your heart rate elevated
---
Only tried Razer Kraken and now I have a pair of those nice new 7.1 Steelseries, and I've been impressed with the sound quality of the mic on both.
---
Ofc a stand alone mic will produce better sound, but not a small cheap one that you "tape" to your headset.
---
The Argent Dawn bag won't be a part of the game before Phase 6.
---
I did the same, I only needed a priest for the red drake
---
No.
---
I feel shame. I'll go commit sudoku now.
---
I would suggest a mouse with 2 thumb buttons. This can easily equate to 6 keybinds using alt and shift as modifiers. You will also have the scroll wheel which can be modified by alt and shift when clicking and when scrolling so that‚Äôs another 6 binds. More than enough considering you can bind keys 1-5 with alt and shift as well.
---
The question isn't whether you can meet the minimum here.  The issue is that the rest of the raid is basically carrying you through content.  
---
I guess my argument here isn't about Moonkins never raiding, but my argument is that Moonkins should never be brought to a serious (I know old content lawl) raid.  If the other 39 members are taking the raid serious they won't enjoy someone being beaten in total damage by the tanks on some fights.  It rubs many the wrong way.  If you're in a fun friends and family guild you absolutely can do moonkin and whatever else you want.  There's tons of resources and guides on how to build out your moonkin, but just know that you are putting increased burden on every other raid member and on fights passed mid t2 its not possible to carry as many people.
---
I know mages are ranged and rogues aren‚Äôt but the point is, low level rogues have an option to try to gouge the mage and escape. A low level mage literally can‚Äôt do anything but blink. Low level mage can‚Äôt cc a 60 rogue, low level rogue can cc a 60 mage and then go invis. Case closed
---
AQ gate opening was my favorite day in wow. Guild farming in Silithus with officers trying to convince the rest of us to stop intentionally killing each other with mind control shenanigans.
---
I was talking about the [Runed Bloodstained Hauberk](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19904). I got agi confused with ap
---
Yea that's what I read. What is considered high level? I would like to get to rank 10 perhaps.
---
And highest rep costs üôÑ all ither reagent mats are a joke compared to that
---
I can't blame you. And yet here I am reading your post. I'm going absolutely insane as well.
---
I think they should have a weekend every month where AV is an early version, just so people are able to experience it. Other than that weekend, I'm fine with the 1.12 being the default.
---
Every hybrid can heal dungeons in any of their PvP specs if you have some healing gear. Exception is druids because of their res cooldown, but they can heal fine if there is a ret pally, elemental sham, spriest, etc in the group. 
---
Ele sham is definitely the best hybrid to heal raids though, rest of the hybrid dps specs wont cut it.
---
You could knock afk people out of AV with snowballs too
---
luna, pfui or elvui are the most common
---
Idk if said already, the crit buff only is to your own group, not the entire raid üßê
---
It ignores the realities of gearing up a raid team.
---
"From a pure numbers standpoint", statistically you're going to get equal numbers of class gear, therefore having a reasonably evened distribution of classes will "min-max" the raid the most
---
It's misleading to talk about the "perfect min-max" scenario when it'll never happen for 99.99% of guilds that will only have 1 raiding roster
---
Imho you only really need the money at 60 for raid gear, enchants and epic mount. It's more like an investment for later.

I have a freind that is trained in Psychology. I made the statement that Classic will be popular because people have not changed alot despite gaming trends having changed. 
---
He told me that Psychologist all over the world are observing something kind of crazy. Young people like 20 or younger nearly all do not have the same kind of imagination as previous generations. He explained further in a game like Vanilla they will not imagine themselves as a class. He then predicted due to this fact Classic will be popular but only among older generations like 30ish +. 
---
The whole conversation lasted for hours so i skipped alot of data and explanation.
---
They won't be in classic. Someone will soon comment "but you could trade someone a token in BFA for gold in Classic", which is true, but also against ToS. And at that point you might as well buy directly from farmers if you're going to pay money to not play your video game.
---
Yeah, the number of realms will hardly be the same as it was. Though I wonder if EU Stormscale will again become so large and popular among top PvP players. Cyclone battlegroup eventually became pretty scary because of that.
---
true dat. i was just memeing around on the server to a certain point. having fun with non meta speccs is kinda cool :)
---
I see it hasnt been confirmed but I highly doubt they will include it.  The #nochanges crowd will burn the place to the ground
---
Yeah IMO it is the strongest PVP spec once you get ridiculous gear like that.  You have a lot of sp from the gear, and you can get the flash of light libram as well to boost FOL.  
---
My fol heals for about 700, mana cost is negligible, and if I put on more caster gear it gets closer to 800 with good mp/5.   Divine favor + holy light if they get too low and I can be that usual 'monster single target healer' that paladins are renowned for. 
---
White crits up to around 1500, Corrupted Ashbringer weapon procs for about 400, crits like 650, and is a drain life too so a nice self heal. 
---
Reck bombs can easily do 5k+ damage with a few crits and seal of righteousness active.  Judgement of the crusader boosts it a couple hundred more but its very rare to judge crusader in pvp.. basically pointless. 
---
I have about 5k hp/4k mana self buffed with no consumes.  
---
Full 2.5 is best- the 5 piece bonus is like 50 more SP.  I currently roll with 5/5 t 2.5, and 3/8 t2 for the extended aura range.  You can use other gear in those 3 slots if you want to focus more on weapon damage (plate DPS gear) or int/sp.  
---
It's a lot of fun =)
---
I remember farming in Tyr‚Äôs Hand and getting the Lifesteal enchant and thinking it wasn‚Äôt worth anything 
---
I went back to Ironforge and put it in trade and instantly had people and GMs messaging me asking what I wanted for it. I was really confused because it was just a enchanting pattern haha. 
---
Sold it for a ton and was very happy.
---
Pattern: Bottomless Bag
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=14510
---
i found it first on server and sold it
---
This is an amazing read. Well done. My future raid leader will probably gkick me when I roll on Ashbringer.
---
Is there a video of this playstyle?
---
Then you will enjoy my name :)
---
Ah, a fellow man of culture. YouTube is also NOT blocked at my work for some reason, while everything else is.
---
Obviously warrior. Offtank is still a tank so regardless Druids can tank
---
Is that the evo 212 cooler. The cokes looking warm tho
---
I remember being a new baby in wrath and hearing about your Saronite bombs on wow insider. Gg.
---
You can get to rank 10 without it, but will lose more 1v1s.
---
I always thought hunters were the greedy fuckers. Then I played a shaman.
---
You literally don't interrupt mc targets because thats when they start casting instants.
---
Last I checked, snowballs cost absolutely nothing, and can be spammed on mc targets by anyone who buys them, if your dps is unable to spam cc for some reason (they aren't paying any attention).
---
Will never level a Druid.
---
Tried leveling one in vanilla because I was an altoholic and it was terrible. Did level one to 100 in WoD and wasn't a fan either.
---
I don't like playing Mage at all either, but I will level one for gold farming.
---
Feral Druid and Enhance Shaman would be fine for dungeons - however they aren't brought to raids very often.
---
As for PvP, Druids are great flag carriers in WSG. Elemental Shaman can absolutely decimate people with their burst damage.
---
If I were you, I'd pick Shaman. Level as enhancement, raid as Resto and PvP as Elemental. You wont have competition for Ele gear besides with other Shaman.
---
It also helps to pick realms with popular or well known names. Illidan server was always bumping, although after Vanilla/TBC it started having massive faction imbalance favoring the horde.
---
Reliably low dps?
---
Yeah enhance is much faster at leveling because eke isn‚Äôt mana efficient at all. The best thing about leveling ele is one set of gear.
---
And which classes are those? Say warrior for example, sure they‚Äôre much better classes but they‚Äôre one of the hardest to level, lack of utility for convenience, heavily gear dependent. How is that better for a casual player compared to a Druid?
---
This was the toughest thing as a warrior who wants to be a PvP God. Raid guilds don't want you or take you seriously. You are automatically expected to be decked out in tank gear and specs.
---
The best way to do it honestly is join a guild that pves as an end to gear up for PvP. This is what I did in vanilla the hardcore raid carebares got mad at us always fightin outside of by mc or doing bgs. So we split the guild under leadership noses and ended up being in a PvP guild with the first rank 14 on realm. A PvP warrior is a maverick and I love that role
---
I'm still torn between Mage and Lock.
---
HELP MEEEEEE
---
Plate or mail I'm ok with personally. The rescale chest piece has something like +66 heals- I'd take that over the dress any day
---
I used it for trinkets/engineering and arena123 type macros.
---
Same. I‚Äôm leaning toward mage because I‚Äôm leveling with a group. But solo I think I go lock, they have no down time!
---
Since you put this much effort in the title it's staying up.
---
reliable attendance
---
Winning Alcor‚Äôs Sunrazor, my first epic, from a roll during an UBRS run
---
Funnily enough the what I call "Barrens run" is one of my favorite things to do when leveling an alt or a tauren. When time comes to leave  Mulgore or go into Mulgore for rep, I always take the  mountain path. You can (legitimately) jump up the Eastern side of the mountain range separating Mulgore from the Barrens and run across its whole length North-South or South-North depending. It's by far the fastest and safest way to get to Xroads and to camp Taurajo. 
---
I always jam to "Right Here Right Now" by Fatboy Slim while doing that run.
---
My mistake. English is not my native language. Well, I could claim it was a joke heheh...
---
 "but you could trade someone a token in BFA for gold in Classic" 
---
I cant even figure out the mechanics of how you would get this to work?  Doesnt make sense.
---
September 23rd better not be the fucking release date or I will Reee!
---
Another holy paly, we must be sadistic to ourselves to play holy paly a second time after knowing what would happen to us at end game, lol
---
What kinda build would you run with this? So far im thinking of something like [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#sE0urxoZVGp0cux), i really like the feeling of being able to heal nicely and give buffs and being able to defend myself too.
---
It would probably have to be more than 10%, but yeah that's the idea. You become ruthless and public about RMT bans to the point where people are too afraid to even consider it. If people think there's a chance they could get away with it, they'll still take the risk.
---
The classic EverQuest emu server Project 1999 was quite militant in their enforcement of RMT to great effect. And that was done with a relatively small volunteer team.
---
EVERYONE ELSE HUNTER
---
It‚Äôs definitely a warrior and hunter item, in a guild group I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if prio went to the warr as they have far superior dps
---
Dropped the Meme Gauntlets from a random ZF Elite. Rolled Need, so did everybody else. I got them, after the dungeon instantly sold them for a 1000 gold. One of the best memories of Vanilla I have.
---
I had a few crowded private server launches where Silverpine was a decent alternative, honestly.
---
Oh look, the reason I hate warriors.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=15047
---
No blue dresses please- mail is still acceptable for your class fantasy needs
---
1.12 is 15 with greater blessings.
---
Sand polished hammer is one of those items that comes to mind when people ask "what's the point of AQ20/ZG loot for a high end guild". Ya, if you're clearing BWL there are a few better drops that you have a few of in the guild at the point AQ20 comes out, but u gaurentee you there's a couple fury warriors or rogues in every guild who could still really use that. 
---
I can't wait for classic to launch so people can remember how hard it was two get 2 good one handers when competing with 14+ people who want the same weapons and you get like a couple a raid if your lucky. It's frustrating but it's part of what made getting an item feel so amazing.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=15047 is the closest - is mail therefore best choice since it still is ok class fantasy/lore wise
---
Best way to get a sense of play style for a healer at 60? In retail, i have never really liked healing but I love hybrid classes and shaman in particular. Not super excited to think that I will love most aspects of a class but hate the raiding. And yes blah blah 30/0/21.
---
Why would they not? Most multiplayer games get released globally nowadays.
---
If it releases during summer and not late august/september (Yes, they are in summer too I know!) then I am not too worried if its during the night since I have too much time on my hands anyways.
---
&gt; Why will this time be different?
---
There's been a trend over the past 10 years or so to stop spending money on customer service and rule enforcement type areas. Companies seem to believe the tradeoff between a worse experience for the players vs. saved money is worth it. It's the same reason that most call centers have been outsourced to foreign countries.
---
Warriors have the advantage that they can more easily form groups and reserve items. No melee dps, tank or other hunter is gonna join brs runs where the hunt lead has reserved dal rends pieces.

don't jinx it dude
---
"Name-Server" is a thing. There won't be any conflict
---
Except when it's the druid healing your group that's about to teleport to Moonglade.
---
enhance shaman are never strong in raids. All the bring to the table is better done by a warrior OT (nightfall) or resto shaman (totems) Warlocks are strong ranged eventually (like once they start getting AQ gear is my understanding)
---
BOO HISS
---
See I thought this as well, until I realized how hard it is to have a group with less than 2 clothies. So I decided if I was going to have to lose gear, I‚Äôd rather it be to someone I know.
---
Very interesting, I really like the tough to reach ones as UI buttons and binding the mount. The strafing thing seems like blasphemy but I've never tried it. I can definitely see how it could become natural.

---
Me2, well hybrid holy.  Pally + war duo is so much fun
---
Compared to hunter paladin can neither use offhand or staves, but can use mace of which there are not too many pre bis/ bis options with a few noteable exceptions
---
Thank you all for the clarification, that system is fine by me as it has no real effect on classic... And now the wait continues...
---
That's like asking the entire guild to be canadian... It's not going to happen. :V
---
Warlocks, Mages and Hunters are what you're looking for.
---
Omg all of the coke cans remind me of my teen years in classic WoW! I had them things piled two and three high! lmao
---
Oh baby this is getting my hyped to play my rogue....
---
Are the private servers accurate? Went on the retrowow one, Just made a 60 rogue with full shadowcraft gear, dal rend weps, 8% hit and it took SO LONG to just kill a normal level 47 creature, not to mention feeling like every other hit was getting blocked/dodged/parried. Are they this weak?
---
Rank 10 isn't as hard. Definitely doable as a casual player. rank 11-13 is where it gets sweaty
---
I 100% will have a 29 Priest.
---
*40 minutes later*
---
"I made it out of Mulgore!"
---
Pretty sure your feral druid will be doing shit for DPS without meme pummelers. :V
---
Dodges and misses are just as much a factor as resists. Pretty sure a gouge can be missed dodged and even resisted.
---
So is Kung fu panda.
---
KT and Illidan were the bosses who pushed paladins out of the role. Sure you can have multiple MTs and swap them around, but at that point...why? At that point guilds moved their prots to dedicated OTs.
---
Destruction Warlocks can use seduce-nuke tactics.
---
But baiting WotF with secuditon doesn't make sense. They are in the same DR table anyways so you'll only land lower duration fears/seduces on undeads anyways.

30 year old looking for Hardcore/Semi-Hardcore raiding Guild!
---
To be up front, I'm an American who lives in Vietnam. I have no issues with Ping.
---
I'm looking for a NA Guild. Alliance pref because I will be rolling a Dwarf Priest. If a Horde guild looks favorable I would probably go Troll. Hell if I know. Is Blood Elf available?
---
PvE is pref, never been into pvp much. However, I am willing to commit myself to a PvP server.
---
I'm an English Teacher so I work in the Vietnam Evenings which is like 3am to 8am PST. Any normal raid times based out of the USA are no issue to me. 
---
I want to primarily raid as a Healing Priest. I will dabble in Shadow.
---
I raided in all Ex-packs besides Vanilla. I healed on a priest since Wrath to retail. I went shadow main spec mid way Legion, but still healed dungeons and sometimes raids. I know Priest through and through on Retail since wrath. Been learning about Priest on Classic for a long while now. 
---
My raiding career has multiple Realm First kills under my belt as well as some top 10US and top 20 World kills. Mostly in my early 20s during Panda land
---
I have gone a bit more casual in my age but time crunches caused that. Also a lack of desire for retail that has became of a lot of us. 
---
If interested, PM me some info.
---
If he's a Euro. I think they drinkem like that. All room temp and shit. Fucking barbarians.
---
Oh your going to play alliance? That's too bad but you just be the best boomkin you can!       
---
Ok hordies were gona fuck this lazer chicken up, who's with me?
---
I need any time after June the 17th :D
---
I would prefere it to be in september or august as than I get to do more theory crafting, but thats just my own opinion.
---
TOO SOON
---
Obviously a warrior.  So was our number 1 OT but our druid was also great.  Don't remember ever wiping because he couldn't hold aggro.  I would run any 5 man with him and he would main tank UBRS all the time.  Not to mention the feral buff he would give to our fury warriors was OP.

It was a beautiful illustration of the Broken Window fallacy, masterfully delivered by Gary Oldman.  
---
Still a fundamentally flawed concept, of course, but that's why Zorg was the villain. I suspect he knew (as I'm sure many rogues do) as much, and just enjoyed having something to vex the minds of the simpler, well-to-do people he interacted with.
---
They will announce at Gamescom (Aug. 24th) that the release date is mid September. I bet that‚Äôs what they will do. That‚Äôs 4 and a half months from now. Since the game is in alpha testing at Blizzard. Beta won‚Äôt hit probably till end of May.
---
It takes a while but is worth it. The pally quest and caster gear definitely get a lot of interest.
---
&gt;and just telling him to calm down is gunna come off more dismissive
---
Well, he's the one calling me a dick for just giving some advice. Am I not allowed to be at least a little bit dismissive towards him?
---
&gt; And that last part, it doesn't read as him having an opiod addiction, more that docs refuse to perscribe any because of the opiod crisis, leaving him in crippling pain.
---
I understood that, lol. Rehab training =/= drug rehab. I'm saying he should get his back in order before he considers running for example, if you have back problems a lot of otherwise "normal" training can end up hurting you a lot.
---
x2 freezing bands are bis for flag carrying if you're going against a melee heavy team. You can do fine without them but it's really fun to piss rogues off with.
---
Short answer, NO.  The real problem aside form the #nochanges crew is the lack of boss debuff slots.  Even if you were to buff numeric values of spells many classes still couldn't come to raid because the 216 debuff slots are mathematically already established to provide the overall raid with the most benefit.
---
Hard-target enemy and use mouse-over addon for healing
---
Man this is the reason I don‚Äôt want TBC or any long term gear upgrades. I won‚Äôt be able to compete right now but maybe in 3 years I could have some nice gear playing casually. I‚Äôm gone from home 12-14 hours a day for work. Factor in other responsibilities and there isnt time to grind that. I can pull a lot of hours on the weekend but almost none on the week
---
I could see bringing ret pallies if you have enough healers and you can't find a full 40 man roster. Ret pallies can still pull off a clutch heal, lay on hands, bubble, etc. Also they can be the blessing bitch to take off some burden from the holy pallies.
---
And so is mop
---
Assassin's blade drops there too iirc.
---
There isn't a ton of leeway as you want to get divine favor + reckoning which is at least 21/25 with 5 points leftover. 
---
I generally use this spec for maximum PVP utility.  I prioritize divine intellect over divine strength- with my gear and weapon I hit plenty hard enough already I find that my mana pool helps me more than a tiny increase of DPS. 
---
4/5 spiritual focus is a must to free up 1 point elsewhere- when you have conc aura active (most of the time) you still are 100% immune to damage pushback. 
---
The improved SOR /JOR isn't a huge damage increase, probably on par with divine strength.  But I like filling out the holy tree more than what's left in the prot tree. 
---
I have enough +hit on my gear to not need precision, so toughness is a nice flat reduction in damage taken.  I don't bother with shield spec, though if you want to do some AOE tanking you have most of what you need in this build anyways, other than holy shield. 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#sVnuMxoZVMt0fdx
---
Others may definitely want to boost divine strength instead of intellect.  Personally, there isn't a TON of strength on the t2, t2.5 gear and my offpieces (cape, neck etc) don't have much str either instead focusing on crit or hit.  If you wanted to gear more focused on STR, then divine strength is probably the better choice. 
---
I spend the extra point to get blessing of Sanc.  Rarely used, but it can be handy, say in AV if you have a tank on like 10 NPCs in the horde base, BoSanc will save hundreds of HP per 5 sec.  Blessing of sacrifice does the same thing but ofc you are taking the damage in that scenario so it's not always ideal =P
---
It's possible to drop BoSanc and get +1% crit on holy spells, up to you.  There's a decent amount of int and a small amount of spell crit on the t2, t2.5 gear already.  
---
I've used improved LOH before but its still a 40 minute cooldown so.. pretty rarely used!  Personally I like the fear/blind/sap resistance more as these are two primary ways you will be CC'd.  Blessing of sacrifice can negate them but no  matter how good you are blessing of sacrifice won't save you all the time. 
---
I personally hate consecration as its such a huge mana hog but it does do a respectable bit of DPS if you get the person standing in it for over half the duration.  I actually unbound max rank consecrate and only use rank 1 for getting stealthers.  My biggest pet peeve is going OOM and consecrate will get you there really quick for a really minimal DPS gain.  PVP fights are extremely mobile so its rare you'll get much damage from it, I prefer to save my mana to sustain more blessings, heals, and judgments. 
---
Good luck =)
---
I unkeybound all movement from the keyboard over a decade ago; all movement is on my mouse. QWER, ASDF are keybound to abilities.
---
Yeah, that is sort of the consensus I am getting. Shamans are interesting concept, but overall, they seem to suck for any group/end game content UNLESS you are spamming chain heal.
---
Warlock can solo really well and turn into some crazy dps later.
---
Druids are viable tanks. Druid tanks are sometimes superior to warrior tanks. Many good raid groups now include a feral tank. Here is one resource on druid tanking:  [https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/)
---
But it shouldn‚Äôt because it doesn‚Äôt fit with the universe nor did it deserve an expac.
---
Chen was one fucking character, and the original idea was a fucking April fools joke.
---
Thanks, but I want to avoid addons, and keep my tank targeted, so any damaging spells would go to their target
---
What‚Äôs so hard about it? Trade the token in bfa, both of you then log into classic, trade the gold. It‚Äôs not rocket science.

Battle Chicken
---
He-Man has to ride something!
---
If that is my territory i.e the barrens. Your getting stomped as it's my right.
---
So, USA token price is average 20 USD for 115k gold. Classic standards would be 12k gold perhaps? Still seems a lot by classic. Maybe 115 gold? So, you give WoW token to seller on Retail. Log into your Classic toon and seller gives you 115 gold.
---
What I was saying is if you are casual and half assing it your dps will be better with many other classes, and in the end if you are choosing a sub optimal class spec and knowingly doing so than its expected to have a harder time. 
---
I could make a list here explaining each but any pure dps class (Rogue/Hunter/Lock/Mage) will have a much easier time as all have some form of strong CC (well aware of Druid sleep) and can easily outperform a druid dps wise. In terms of Warrior their utility lies in offtanking and Battle shout which is always helpful, but beyond that don't provide much
---
I'm speaking purely to endgame content as well, as certain classes definitely shine in different brackets and vary in leveling speed and ease.
---
pls no
---
This is why I won‚Äôt take off work for release. I‚Äôm sure the first couple days are going to have their issues.
---
So, Josh, you mention you know when the Alpha ends which then leads to what? Beta? Release Date?
---
Very curious to hear they've given you insight into the F&amp;F Alpha timeline, happy you're keeping it for yourself as well.
---
Pandas that talk doesn‚Äôt fit but space goats do. Ok.
---
I have like 600 k on my retail toons just sitting there since wrath.  I look forward to using every copper on tokens.
---
It's cute that you think a vacation with classic will get you anywhere.
---
*Comes back from 3 weeks vacation*
---
"So what did you do?"
---
"I hit level 19 in WoW."
---
Roccat tyon is amazing, have 2 of them and they work perfectly for wow!
---
How would you rate shamans and specially enhancement shamans in comparison to pure DPS classes
---
&gt; "From a pure numbers standpoint", statistically you're going to get equal numbers of class gear, therefore having a reasonably evened distribution of classes will "min-max" the raid the most
---
That's a fair point, and it's certainly outright true in the beginning when nobody has anything, but most of classic's gear is garbage. That's why paladins, priests, druids, and shaman share so much gear, and in a few cases, share it with mages and warlocks beyond that. Let's look at BWL for example.
---
Druids have 2 class specific, phase bis pieces from there, stormrage bracers and gloves. Sure, other stormrage pieces can drop, and they'll be wasted 100% if no druids are there to pick it up, but at that point the alternatives to most of their BiS are found in 5 mans anyway. So assuming someone isn't too lazy to do a few 5 mans, the gear is a waste anyway, so it doesn't matter. It shouldn't be an upgrade for a prepared player anyway. Same goes for paladins and shaman in most regards. Most of the alternatives to their bis are better than their class specific pieces anyway and can be found in content that is easily doable. 
---
So what about the items that are shared? How about Mish'Undare for example? It's BiS for druids, priests, mages, warlocks, shaman, and paladins. Same with Lok'amir...lots of competition. If you look at it optimally, favoring progress, giving either to a druid over any of the others would be a mistake. The others just get more out of it.
---
And unfortunately, 'evened distribution' stops being useful from a 'gear utilization' standpoint. Hunters and druids don't scale well into Naxx, and since tier pieces span multiple classes, it's hard to waste them anyway. So do progressing guilds in naxx keep this distribution of slots up in the name of loot efficiency? If they don't have to, nah, they don't. They'd get rid of as much as they can get away with so we can get the good classes in. They're in an era of comparing what is great to what is good, and an innervate and a 30 min CD battle rez doesn't compare to a decent priest.
---
&gt; It's misleading to give advice and talk about the "perfect min-max" scenario when it'll never happen for 99.99% of guilds that will only have 1 main raiding roster
---
Now I 100% agree with you. Most guilds, this won't matter. Guilds will have attendance problems and will compete with other guilds for members, requiring concessions. But the context is druids having to try-hard their way to relevancy. Extra druids are a concession, and any guild even making *minor* adjustments in the name of min-maxing will start with druids.
---
If you pick warrior you can tank and if you pic shaman you can heal. being either of these roles you can start the party and basically dictate what classes join you.
---
Valor pauldrons from UBRS. I had my sights set on them from the first time I saw them on someone. I still have a full set of valor in my bank, sans helmet.
---
It's not something you can do casually, period, even over a long period of time. It's a competitive bracket. You only advance up the bracket if you're meeting the criteria for the next bracket as compared to other players. Your rank decays if you don't meet the criteria. The grind element comes into play because even if you meet the criteria for rank 14 (highest honor on server) one week, you don't just become rank 14 -- in fact your honor will only go up about one rank, or like a third of a rank after 12ish. You need to consistently be one of the top ~5-10 players on the server for like a month to go from rank 12 to 14.
---
Also, check out Drakova on youtube.  He did a video about this holy/reck spec and goes into a lot of detail (maybe 15-20 minutes iirc) and knows his stuff.
---
I'm not sure what you mean. Tokens are only about 120,000 gold on NA realms. Gold is so easy to get right now that it's fairly easy to just sell things you get through world quests, etc.  
---
If you're talking about Classic, tokens will not be purchasable/sellable on the Classic servers. Those are BFA/retail only.
---
I've twinked at 29 and 39 and likely will again at some point. Probably a druid, but possibly a priest or hunter.
---
It‚Äôs ok if it‚Äôs justified. It‚Äôs like being a cop and curb stomping a criminal. Nobody‚Äôs gonna stop you because he deserves it
---
Very good question
---
That‚Äôs a good catch!
---
I am choosing to believe it will be a September release because it keeps my hopes and expectations in check. A side effect of this will be I am either right or pleasantly surprised :)
---
Reasons to bring a ret pally: 
---
- being 39 players :)
---
*End*
---
Only if you have both. Rogue should get prio
---
False. But our freezers support ice-making, which I guess is not present in other parts of tellus
---
The amount of times I walk past a rogue 5 levels lower and leave him be, then 10 mins later while I‚Äôm fighting a mob at 10% hp he ganks me.
---
So now, they all die. Level one or level 60.
---
Yeah uhhh.. I dont know, but I do know what my first 200 gold will be going towards now if true.
---
I am really bad at PVP, somewhere my fun has to come from, right? :D
---
I don‚Äôt think you need the skill to buy the mount. The mount icon in your bag will be red I think and you can‚Äôt use it, that‚Äôs it. Don‚Äôt take my word for it tho
---
Maybe ion meant to say winter?
---
No I‚Äôm aware, I just meant more from a PvE perspective. I‚Äôll be able to raid, but always have cared more about PvP than PvE
---
I will protect my faction from the opposing faction scums.
---
It's basically a lose/lose for blizzard no matter what they choose to do. If they allow tokens in classic, it introduces a sort of pay to win spin on the game
---
I say sort or, because most of the best gear worth getting in WoW are drops and not BOP. The arguments for using wow tokens to essentially get the epic mount in no time is a bit more compelling.  You can get a real leg up in profession gathering, PvP, and just overall spending less time getting point a to point b is important. And I dont think you should have to spend more money on microtransactions to be competitive earlier in a game.
---
If they dont put tokens in, people will still buy gold for irl money regardless if blizzard provides an official avenue or not. Gold farming companies profits would be higher with no tokens because they are the ones providing the service, which in turn could go into investing more gold farmers, making the problem harder and harder to combat.
---
I can see and agree with both sides. I dont really think there is a good solution that makes everyone happy though.
---
Me too, it's so tough.
---
I'm going to revive my 39 Troll hunter twink with his Humar the Pridelord pet.
---
This made me remember how slow the WoW installer was. Re-installing the game was PITA so making your own backup of the game was much faster.
---
It'll just sit in your inventory, unusable
---
How does playing a certain spec makes someone have a reliable raid attendace?
---
I hope so.
---
If you have both then you don't need them anymore lol
---
You can get rank 10 playing less than that per day, it'll just take longer. You might need a good week where you binge a bit to finally make the bump, but if you get it once, you have the gear forever.
---
Last i heard was "soon (tm)"
---
You had 15 years!! Lol
---
I dont need an excuse to kill lowbies. If I wanna kill lowbies I'll just do it
---
Yeah what the actual fuck how does anyone forget The Beast.
---
I'll let them duel it out once. After the fight, regardless of that victor, I'll be one shotting the enemy player as long as I have business in that zone. Why? Because red is dead.
---
If you are doing PvP then you want Plate over all costs anyway
---
And they‚Äôre dumb and need more int
---
One thing you could do is roll Resto/ele for raiding/dungeons, but primarily pick up spell damage gear rather than straight healing power (plus of course aux stats like mp5/int etc).
---
You'll do just fine pulling your weight as a healer and you'll still be able to have fun PvPing/dpsing where you can. 
---
I built my pally in vanilla pretty much as a shockadin (tier 2 helps as it was sp dmg/heal as opposed to straight +healing). Made it much easier to kill mobs if I ever needed to farm, and was pretty bursty and almost unkillable in PvP.
---
Someone‚Äôs been watching too much of the Shield.
---
Lol I mean if you already have one and the other drops than by all means roll against the rogue.
---
DAE GRIZZLY HILLS BEST ZONE?
---
&gt; The question isn't whether you can meet the minimum here. The issue is that the rest of the raid is basically carrying you through content.
---
They aren't carrying you when the person you replied to literally said that moonkins deal nearly double the needed damage.
---
Carrying would be being beyond that threshold...
---
I solo'd my MC attunement on my warrior. Took several invisibility pots with me. Bunny hopped through lava and the like. Waited in ten minute intervals for the invisibility pot CDs to reset. I think it took me well over an hour.
---
damn warlocks killing their parties.
---
Goblinüò≠
---
As someone who just levelled a lock on a pserver, you will have downtime. It‚Äôs not as much as other classes but definitely have downtime.
---
There is?
---
It happened to most of my Vanilla characters when I came back in WoD. Their names were like "Chompski864527" and I had to rename them if I wanted to enter the world. If I'm not mistaken characters below level 30 will lose their name faster. I'm guessing names probably reset after a year of inactivity or after new Expansion.
---
When I raided in vanilla we always used flasks in progression raids no matter what class and role. It was expensive, but not that bad.
---
Robe of Arugal was my favorite robe leveling up. It‚Äôs definitely a bring your own party kind of place though.
---
#showtooltip  
---
  /cast [harm][@targettarget,harm] spell  
---
if this still works it should cast 'spell' if your target is hostile or your targets target is hostile.  
---
  Let me know if I did something wrong.
---
Just play whatever you want to play. You‚Äôll find groups.
---
Agreed. Sounds like OP got rekt and is salty now
---
U da real mvp. OP is trying to bait you into not keeping lowbies safe.
---
Can someone get me a link of that warlock picture? I need a new phone backround
---
Did the premade characters come with 300 weapon skill?
---
The good news is that in vanilla the gear margin is tiny compared to modern WoW. Going from pre-BiS dungeon blues to ~AQ40 BiS is, depending on your class, often about the same jump in character power as going from "first expansion tier" to "second expansion tier" in modern WoW.
---
Yep.  1-10 questline gives you a 4 slot bag.   Do all 3 starting zones
---
Paladins too... They want ALL the healing gear... cloth, leather, mail, plate... greedy bastards.
---
the Blastershot Launcher in MC, my guild was sort of weird RP on a PVP server, and had strict race rules, so if you weren't an elf, you were a "lesser race"(also no humans) which seems ridiculous to me now, but then I just wanted to play with my pals, but I also refused to play an elf, so I picked dwarf hunter and just lived with being "lesser" in the guild.
---
The other hunters were all elves and went with bows, so when the Blastershot Launcher dropped I finally had the weapon for me, I loved that thing. 
---
Close second/third is when I got Zin'rokh and Rhok'delar/Lok'delar.
---
There is no change that can make that speccs viable.
---
If you give Moonkin, Shadowpriest, Ele shaman the ability to somehow conserve mana they will be absolut monster in PvP Mana is the limiting factor that makes this classes struggle, and that they dont have access to perfect gear/abit less dmg.
---
So if you make them raid viable they would be unbelievable monsters in pvp, shadowpriest and ele shaman are allready kinda strong in pvp. 
---
And even "Balance" Druid is because often they just die because they go oom.
---
As for Ench Shaman and Ret pala, well they would need a dmg buff, that would most likely not break them in pvp because they have the issue of getting kitet, so you have more room to work with.
---
The buff you proposed would do nothing, your dps would just plummit even more, hunter can drink in combat it hurts dps would be the same for Moonkin, and ppl would just play moonkin healer like ppl here said.
---
And with effort you can allready fix the mana issue of these classes more or less, but you need to put effort in it.
---
Def agree. Having a mount and ~70% of your moves was way better than lower brackets. Played 49 war for ~40 days in vanilla/bc.
---
if you were meleeing the boss from the beginning you might not have oom'd. Though i do agree they should've made the Moonkin mana restore on spell crit or something instead of melee attack, and base it on a % of maximum mana or at least your spell damage (instead of Attack power). Though they were trying to keep the Balance is the everything tree.
---
Even with Atiesh the mana you regain per successful hit proc was pretty pathetic.
---
Yeah, I agree. It kinda stinks that back then pally/druid/shaman etc couldn't tank on par enough with warrior for it to be something people wanted. Hoping we get a ton of warriors! Might level one as a second character.
---
*Bubble Hearths*
---
Awesome! If I go tailoring, what's a good pair while leveling?
---
Just food. Bandages. Pots. A pocket healer. You know, the bare minimum.
---
Damn skippy
---
Decursive and maybe Prat because standart chat way to limited.
---
At that point you might as well just clear it with 39 people so there's less competition for gear
---
This is only true if the two fighting are around the same level. If 60 horde are ganking in Redridge and a 60 alliance comes riding in to fight them off, he's a damn hero.
---
NE starting point is the best in the game.
---
Well, they're still not lying if it releases before summer ends.
---
If its red, its dead
---
Yeah but the token trade needs to take place on the AH in BFA, and Blizzard sets the price.
---
Which means if you're buying gold in Classic, the gold seller needs to have $115k gold in his BFA account to buy the token you're selling.
---
I guess this is possible with a 10 million gold cap, but eventually this will come to an end once those accounts have been depleted.  Blizz could also just raise the price of the BFA token to deplete the accounts faster.  
---
I think linking the two would create more problems than it's worth.  They may need to remove tokens from BFA at Classic launch to have some control.
---
Yeah you are right, the most viable option is tanking.
---
Yeah, the PvP system in Vanilla is one thing I would love to see changed. If we ever get an OSRS-style "Patch 1.13", I hope that will be on the table. Rated BGs seem like a good direction to take the game. Or maybe open-world PvP objectives.
---
Can confirm.
---
"I'll tank it for you if you give me 25g and true strike shoulders if they drop"
---
*eyepatch drops*
---
"Yeah, I need that, too"
---
**rolls 98**
---
why?  so EVERYONE besides hunter/rogue/warrior competes with you.
---
Warlocks have a quest that takes them through SFK (and BFD) as well for a decent spell damage staff or off hand.
---
I simply use proper terminology. Activision and Blizzard don't exist for years. The company's name is Activision Blizzard. For the same reason, I stopped using Vanilla as a term and started using Classic. It's not to a jab. It's simply how things are named.
---
Also, you have no real info on how much the Activision part is affecting Blizzard games. It's a very strange coincidence the companies merged together during Wotlk and the next expansion had cash shop don't you think? That is a jab.
---
I would get a mouse with 3-6 thumb buttons and just use a Tartarus V2. With CTRL you'll get 6-12 keys +2 for the wheel click
---
Is that true for anything other than sit-reck (not applicable in raids)? I wasn't aware of normal ret doing any more dps for any reason other than sit-reck which only applies to questing/pvp really.
---
To build on this point the real key to leveling in classic, especially early is to know when to stop trying to do a quest and just grind due to bottlenecks.
---
Yeah I don't understand the hate for sharding in this situation. I honestly wouldn't mind sharding in tier 1 and 2 starting zones like barrens/westfall either.  At least for the first month or whatever. I think we will really need it.
---
Oh you know thered be ONE GUY who would
---
You have to orc. Stun res too good
---
If blizzard itemized the fucking game properly, it wouldn't be an issue. The fact that shaman and paladin bis gear can be leather and cloth is completely ass backwards.
---
It's all about muscle memory. I got a 12 button mouse back in MoP doing Siege of Org. Learned how to use all the buttons real damn quick during raid nights. Trial by fire will get you what you want, though it'll probably take at most a week.
---
If you're stilled subbed to retail go do LFR with the goal of using those 12 mouse buttons and you'll develop it right quick.
---
What are you planning on farming if you think 200g will be easy to obtain in phase 1? My memory of vanilla was of gold being hard to come by. 200g was no small amount.
---
Damn, I should have met you back in 2006 when I was poor as a rat and had to save for sub. Too bad I have money now ;)
---
But seriously If there was something like a fund for paying subs for kids in need (like scholarship but for wow subs) I would be happy to chip in! I honestly believe wow addiction made me a better human being and despite being huge time sink it made me grow more than whatever else in its place would.
---
I was on EU-Spinebreaker, which later I found was dubbed Spainbreaker.
---
Want to know how somebody is playing on a pve server? Wait 5 seconds and they will tell you.
---
The leveling is pretty different for the first 20 levels or so. Barrens/Silverpine is pretty much horde exclusive for questing but locations afterward are for both, such as desolace, tanaris, ferolas, stv, arathi, etc
---
Rank 10/11, not hard.
---
Getting higher ranks in vanilla is more about time commitment and efficient use of that time than it is skill. 
---
I reached rank 12 without ever touching engineering. I did run hundreds of premade WSG and AB games though.
---
Is the option to turn off exp gains even still in retail?  Havent played it in a long time?
---
What youre describing is an objective downgrade to OP's 12 thumb button mouse.
---
Seriously. You can scream BiS all you want but you look like a joke and chose to.
---
"6 going into stealth sounds at once"  
---
"haha I'm in danger"
---
Not going to lie, all the logs I've seen don't look too good. If I was running a guild, I wouldn't see any reason to give a ret paladin gear over a warrior or rogue, assuming all other factors such as attendance and guild contribution being even.
---
Maybe if you went full tryhard and did everything you could as far as consumables and buffs go, then you MIGHT be able to compete, but you'd still be behind warriors/rogues, who are also expending a third of the effort. You also would never beat them if they are expending the same amount of effort. Even a kitty looks like a better performer than a ret based on the logs, and it would actually be bringing something to the table in terms of unique utility.
---
A holy paladin is far more desirable and can bring the same exact utility while also not being half as effective as others filling the same role.
---
Guild banks.

Pvp happened on a pvp server.
---
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
I jumped off about 1/4 way through one time...don't do that.
---
I know many people who hate that stuff. Me included. I take it over ghost realms as I dont see a better option... but clearly not over some initial sharding. Most people wont need more than a couple hours playtime to leave the starting zones, so its a few hours of sharding against an indefinite annoyance. I dont know what would make you hate sharding so hard you rather choose the later.
---
"I need that for my enhancement set"- every shaman I've ever grouped with
---
Also expressing interest - have a few friends that would join as well (We have a group of about 8 of us that had been planning on reconnecting for wow classic, of which 4 would likely want to raid and 4 would be casual players that would just want to level/quest/dungeon). If you guys are still looking for people, give me a shout!

30 slot bags. I don't remember many bags over 22 slots or so back then. Would ease the headaches associated with lugging around all kinds of gear and reagents.

Okay, I triple checked now on private server and it says there it is 6 min. I hate you for making me spend so much time on it and I kind of like you for that. I hope you roll horde so I can spawn camp you.
---
Hunters aren't top dps until the later raids, sure. But saying they are unviable in lower tier content is just silly.

Bro they're gonna milk the fuck out of server xfers first of all. Second they'll be mega populated at first....it's 2-3 months down the line you have to worry about.
---
They don't require the skill to purchase.
---
Note: Datamining of the current classic beta shows the mounts using the old mount skill system. Where the training to ride the mount was cheap and the mount item itself was expensive. 
---
(Speculate however you want if they will stick with this system or use the riding system they swapped to in 1.12.1 in preparation tbc.)

---
Careful, that kind of power could attract the attention of a dark lord or something.
---
howdy  - you might want to look us up, Glamorama (Alliance though). We will raid tues + thurs 20-23 CET (so that would be 21-00 finnish time) We are mostly about the PvE but will ofc play on a PvP-server becaus PvP is still fun as hell. We have around 60ppl no, mea age around 30 and so ofc lots of us have kids and real jobs and stuff. We got a fun Discord going, hyping each other and prepping for a "Classic Summer". Feel free to  contact us on discord [**https://discord.gg/92V5CCD**](https://discord.gg/92V5CCD) , write a little something like this in our "recruit" channel and get to know us
---
That's the idea, hell, between mana tide, mama spring, and innervate I could probably two man some dungeons!
---
if a ret paladin finds a raid that will allow them in, they will not miss that raid slot
---
That one time a Zevra Hove dropped, it was lika an epic. It never dropped for me again after that day...
---
I had a razor naga with 12 thumb buttons and it was overwhelming. I‚Äôm not very sensitive in my thumb so I can‚Äôt feel that many small buttons. I‚Äôve been using my setup for years now and I have no complaints. Every spell is bound, even food and drinks.
---
Not having dead specs makes sense to me, but all the Warrior/Rogue/Mage players want to stay on top, so....
---
Yeah I‚Äôve definitely been leaning shaman, main competitor being spriest but I wanted to leave the question open ended in case others had similar thoughts.
---
Shaman seems to bring so much though and from what I hear is more than capable of raid healing in their ele pvp spec, which is great cause I never even got my epic mount in vanilla so I‚Äôd like to avoid respec costs as much as possible lol.
---
I also wonder if enh couldn‚Äôt function as a nightfall bot, but I‚Äôd probably be better off healing anyway
---
Try kiting him as a fury warrior it's not a blast.
---
howdy  -  Glamorama might be what you seek! We will raid tues + thurs 20-23 CET. We are mostly about the PvE but will ofc play on a PvP-server becaus PvP is still fun as hell.

pservers have wrong values for armor and resistance and many wrong mechanics
---
some pservers purposefully inflate ret numbers so its less laughable. i dont think the one in question here does though but its something to keep in mind. pserver data is not gold.
---
The atlas is sweet
---
Got that off a Scorpid in Silithus at level 58. Sold for 700g, I had an epic mount at level 60 on my first toon. Probably won't be that lucky this time around.
---
Too much to drink will result in a metric ton of bio breaks. the professional uses cut vegetables in the fridge. Hydrates and feeds you.
---
Also worth mentioning, the costs of riding training and the mounts were reversed pre-armored mounts update. Not sure how Blizzard plans to roll it out for classic but you may be looking at 900g epic mounts at launch.
---
The largest bag in Vanilla was 18 slot. One from Onyxia drop and one craftable from rare Tailoring pattern. Most common to use was 16 slot bags (travelers backpack)
---
Elemental can have great burst potential but go OOM super fast. Elemental is meh at best but utility wise Windfury alone is worth bringing to a raid. Toss on a Nightfall and you can find spots especially in caster heavy groups. 
---
On a numerical scale 10 being highest I would put enhance at best around 5-6 with hunters of equal gear being around 7ish. Wars (fury) 10 -mages 9.5- rogues 9 -warlocks 7.5 (my opinion is based off of them doing their best with at least decent to good gear)
---
Yes. 
---
It's both insanely grindy and insanely difficult. Wanna do Ony? You need to grind fire resist gear.
---
Wanna do a dungeon? Find a group in general chat, walk to the dungeon entrance, and hope nobody has to leave in the 1-2 hours it takes to clear the dungeon. You need CC in most dungeons. You can't faceroll anything.
---
Want something crafted that's rare or epic? Hmm, maybe find out if anyone on your server can actually craft it. It might not have been learned my anyone yet. 
---
I can't wait for classic &lt;3
---
&gt;bears are not as good as warriors,
---
This generalization is not good. There's fights where Bears are -  hands down - better suited for the job. Basically anytime you want to go ALL OUT on DPS, you want a Druid tanking the boss. Warriors cannot compete with a Druids TPS, not even considering the Fura Tank specc.
---
That being said, you also can't use a Bear all the time because some fights are simply not well suited for a Druid for several reasons.
---
Sharding expanded to level 10-20 zones and not just starting zones. The people arguing for no changes also need to realize never before has their been such a large bottleneck of players at low level, if people can't make it to level 20 and then dick around with dungeons then a lot of casuals are going to quit. Having casuals around is a good thing and if they can't kill a single thing in the Barrens they will quit.
---
yeah of course, the boss values part is the big one, i was just wondering if there are any specific common bugs with ret on Mangos. And yeah if Esfand's logs are anything to go by, LH doesn't inflate ret numbers LUL
---
So wait.. You think that because the last boss of an expansion is a caster boss that it made guilds push out their MT?
---
Nah. It does not work that way unless you are some kind of min/max/worldfirst raid. The rest of the world is reasonable.

Blizzard might have to do this, just to deter account-sharing of gbank alts and clogging up of the mail system
---
If you plan on pvping horde is the only way for a lock. I prefer undead, makes it easier to kill other locks and spriests. The argument is with orc you will survive a warrior, the stun reduction will never save you from a rogue. so for me the only choice is Undead. Leveling as alliance is way easier the zones are smaller and closer together so you have less travel time than horde.
---
Sheep him lol
---
Warlock main here so I am obviously biased towards warlock DPS.  Regardless of what DPS class you play I HIGHLY recommend going alliance because salvation is just too good.  I've played on private servers for years and even in legit garbage preraid gear as a warlock I can rip threat off a tank in full threat gear and dual wielding as horde.
---
Every raid will have at least 2-3 hunters. Actually, most raids will have more as most leaders won't be minmaxing the raid compositions as much as people on private servers do. 
---
Classic is gonna have a lot of casual guilds that will take all specs to raids, don't believe the scaremongering against niche specs.
---
Proper nice
---
So youve finally hit lvl 60 after a couple months, started a guild with some IRL friends and many you met while lvling and in your beginning adventures at lvl 60. You and your guild and mates finally have done some raiding and created a sort of schedule. As the weeks go by youve become very friendly with all and expect to be greeted everytime you log in, especially on raid night... THEN BAM - SERVERS BEING SHUT DOWN WE THINK THIS IS TOO LOW POP OR THAT THERE ARE TOO MANY HORDE/ALLIANCE AND THE BALANCE ISNT PROPER. FUCK YOU.
---
They cant just "shut down" servers so easily... why do you think in the past the best they could ever really do is offer free transfers as an incentive, a server becomes a players world that they adapt to, whether its imbalanced or unpopulated. Players who really dislike it can transfer off or reroll elsewhere but simplt "shutting servers down" is far from the correct answer.
---
I agree with the rest of your post but I want to disagree with this point.
---
If the "minimum" is 120 sustained dps on a boss fight and a player does 250, he is not just meeting the minimum and he is not being carried.
---
The problem with moonkins is that a geared moonkin is perfectly fine in T1 raids and is ok in T2, but his dps is not going to scale up after that.
---
And if you are on a progression raid and have to choose between the 250 dps moonkin and the 450 dps mage, well of course you are going to choose the mage.
---
However, we are talking about 40-man raiding and the choice for most guilds is going to be between a 250 dps moonkin and a 0 dps empty raid slot.
---
And moonkins are not going to soak up raid gear as well.
---
 Hunters are top dps until the later raids, sure. But saying they are unviable in higher tier content is just silly.
---
hell yea! honored to be part of this amazing team bros..its gonna be an era to remember!
---
That last part sells it I think. I‚Äôd imagine other than a feral or spriest sprinkled here or there, hybrids are only getting into raids as healers so being able to cover that without needing a respec would be huge
---
Rebalancing would be one of the best ways to improve the game and simultaneously make many many people angry.
---
See somethings are about control. If you have a tight knit group of people who are in a leadership role of a guild nobody can tell you what to do. The hardest thing about a warrior with PvP aspirations is none of the hardcore guilds will take you seriously...nobody wants to gear a warrior up to be a PvP God especially strictly pve carebares. You're expected to be a tank for life to have any part of end game. If your friends with the guild leadership who the fuck is gonna tell you what to do? A warrior who plays arms is a rebel a maverick and it can be a beautiful thing.
---
Find guilds who view pve as a means to an end towards PvP domination. There was a split in a major raid guild I was in because a good group of us just wanted to gear up for PvP. So we basically took half of an amazing raiding guild and got an amazing PvP guild going once we were decked out. I can't remember if the other guild took it the wrong way but ehh pvpers are here to be the best and most feared not to sit around and fight npcs.
---
What if there must always be a Night King?
---
Thanks for all that you do.
---
Thankfully this doesn't stop you from wearing the gear earned from higher ranks
---
Bis is Bis. But yes I agree that completing set is priority.
---
Yep. My guild did. We merged with another large guild to fill 40 mans. We were into Naxx when BC was around the corner. Never did finish it, though.
---
Yeah but I think we can agree its not the gold sellers that ruin the game, its the act of selling gold itself that allows others to pay to win/get ahead/take shortcuts at the expense of others whole may not have the same resources/just want to play the game competitively on a **FAIR** playing field.  
---
So you got to ask, where will less gold buying take place?
---
If people risk getting banned, or being defrauded by some shady Chinese gold seller, then far less gold buying will take place.
---
This should be the end goal IMO.  Less gold buying.  
---
So NO TOKENS, and combat gold sellers (at the hit to Blizzards bottom line, but with the goal of growing the player base and getting that extra $180 sub revenue vs $5 from a quick gold deal).
---
There's been a lot of passion coming from all angles for this project! So amazing to see this hard work come to fruition. A lot more to come, everyone!
---
LoS functionality (at least in bgs) so casters can't shoot through houses and trees and whatnot. Unfortunatly, such change would make a lot of casters cry, so it's never going to happen. :/
---
pserver values are not off.
---
The best drink in the game gives 4200 over 30 seconds, and then there's spirit to take account for.
---
This is pretty much how I feel. Another reason I want to see a list is to try to figure out what types of realms they are offering and in what quantity.
---
Guild banks is the only QoL thing I would implement. Anything else ruins what classic was. Duel spec would take out a huge money sink that was in the game which would fuck with the economy.
---
Guys! so glad to be a part of this project and see this come to fruition! Love this damn Community!
---
It absolutely does not work. Even during lower pop times on bright slope every single damn quest has other players from both factions competing for mobs/ items.
---
I regularly saw 3-5 druids in raids back in vanilla in multiple guilds that I raided with or knew about from other guilds
---
2 currently on my mind are  
---
auto-dismount  
---
removal of reagents for certain spells (ex: blind powder)
---
were gonna add caves to it soon too my man big ups to taladril
---
Sharding for 10-20 zones so release week isn't a mess. People are underestimating launch because the OG Vanilla had people trickle in, never once did it have thousands bottle-necked in the Barrens/Westfall.
---
Technically the largest bag was 20 slots. Soul pouch etc.
---
Classic was extremely unbalanced and changing specs isn't really a QoL its about rebalancing the entire game. WOuld be awful...
---
Right there with you.
---
Had it happen to two guilds I was in, and we were faaaar from world first min-mixers. Both times we had 2 prot pallies tanking as we were progressing. As we started running into those bosses we had to swap one of them out for a full time warrior tank, which meant that one of the prots ended up respecing.
---
Holy candle &amp; sacred candle
---
Thrilled to be a part of this community.
---
And that Atlas is SWEET and provides so much potential
---
with 16 debuff slots a warlock should never use corruption on a boss, unless you put it on the non focus target for extra dmg.  The 'skill cap' in vanilla is understanding how ot maximize your DPS.  Yes warlocks, as an example, use shadowbolt but the masters know when to sapper charge, when to shadowburn correctly, how to cancel/cast marco since no spell queuing, how to properly consume for raids (so many world buffs), and how to life tap correctly- e.g. dark/demonic runes mana pots only life tap when you move if at all.  Don't be fooled by 1 button rotations- god tier anything in vanilla is just as hard as any retail rotation when done correctly.
---
I had no idea there was such a huge gap, i didn‚Äôt get to play vanilla wow too intensively when I was younger but going back now and finding a class that fits the roles I prefer has been a challenge
---
I find my self constantly flipping between the idea of playing a warrior, shaman, Druid and maybe rogue
---
I prefer melee classes (or specs) and a bit of utility, but the struggle I heard of being a warrior or rogue seems a bit too hardcore for me.
---
This was my thought
---
I hope he's doing well and taking care of him self because I *need* Kungen classic streams.  Also, it would be nice for him also =)
---
Taladril is the GOAT
---
I would make a judgement call based on how good the group was before the end on how far I kited Drek. If the group was doing good dps, I would go to the dark corner in beasts room, else I would go all the way to Rend to be safe. Better to have the party wait for the boss to come back for 30secs than wipe them bu having Drek come back too soon.
---
You misinterpreted.  Shut down new sign ups on actively running servers temporarily, not the server themselves, just the signups lol.
---
Foror's from king in DM N. Only three guys rolled need and the 2 greeders ("always greed on epics!"-people) were mad.
---
Well if all of your friends/guild are going alliance, going horde would be silly imo. Yes, paladin leveling is very slow because auto attacking is their rotation - time to kill is extremely slow but on the bright side they have almost no downtime due to self healing and pretty low mana usage. Go what ever you enjoy, Druid rez is annoying but don‚Äôt let that one thing sway your decision on the class as a whole.
---
Good thread to start and keep saved =).
---
Hunters are viable. This isn't retail where you just pick the top dps on icyveins or whatever and roll with that. You need hunters to complete content, depending on the guild you will have 1-4 hunters in raids. As hunters scale worse into AQ and naxx sure your raid might only want 1 or 2 hunters. Just be that one or 2nd hunter. If you join a guild and stay with them you won't suddenly just get kicked off the roster. Also don't worry about hunters suddenly losing 2 raid spots. A lot of hunters quit at AQ because well there's like 2 upgrades in the entire AQ tier and they do mediocre dps. 
---
You can also go with the hunter then reroll mage at ZG plan, I recommend it a lot.
---
howdy  - you might want to look us up, Glamorama. We will raid tues + thurs 20-23 CET  We are mostly about the PvE but will ofc play on a PvP-server becaus PvP is still fun as hell.

---
Dude, not as glorious as 29 shaman with ravaged. You could 1vs40 with a lucky proc. Instant death to the entire bg assuming everyone was grouped in a 5 yard per person chain.
---
*laughs in PVE*
---
It all depends on fight length. If you're outgearing the content it's a much different meta compared to first kills for example. On Progression, every Priest should be atop of all the other healers all the time. This holds true for every single content block out there. They have been just that much better.
---
That being said, other healers can do really well, too. Noone plays perfectly. Everyone throws a big overheal out at some point in time. And other healers certainly have strong points to bring them, too, albeit that mostly being the buffs/utility they provide...
---
It‚Äôs how Gollum would say it, so you planned it this way ;)
---
There's no "more memes" vote.
---
Honestly this subreddit is dead as fuck if people want to bring more content here in form of memes, I'm more than glad to see it. There's only so much you can discuss about a game that doesn't even have a release date.
---
Isn't seduce nuking basically Warlock PoM pyro?
---
Are they an enemy player? Can I kill them? They're dead. Done.
---
Lol!  This is great, love it.
---
This thing is looking great, can't wait to be part of the community
---
Pick mage. I'd say they're the best at farming out of the 4. Plus you get teleports to the cities, for easy travel to farming locations.
---
yours is in really good condition... mine was used as an armrest /to put the mouse mat on for years, and for many years more collected dust in some storage box. Still have it, but it's in pretty bad shape :)
---
I'm with you. I'm also trying to wait for Ryzen 3 to release before finishing my current PC build, and don't want to be competing with kiddies that have no responsibilities during summer.
---
You can buy mounts without having the skill to ride them yes.
---
Farmed the epic ring from SM gy on my 29 rogue twink. Then accidentally leveled to 30 :(
---
One of my two real regrets in wow
---
I got a flurry axe on the coast of Ferals while leveling my warrior. I had no idea its power and was like "wow this axe has no stats? Piece of shit"
---
I then went on and got excited for the Blackhand Doomsaw which WAS a piece of shit. But for some reason I felt the cool model gave like 10% more DPS.
---
Sweet. Tbh I'm expecting to see more normalized behavior with Classic. It's just all the pservers over the years that would only ever have 2 and they both *had* to be Resto, ya'know. Shit gets boring.
---
"Hybrid Tax!!!" and all that, but Warriors are fine with being the best/only tank and pretty much top DPS later?
---
So for a shadowpriest with 6k buffed, how long would it take to fill that?
---
40 seconds?
---
That's a very... long time.
---
Good point ab that being a big gold sink...I don‚Äôt play enough to grind for so much gold üò¨
---
... is that why the orc was trying to mount the druid?
---
Warlock on Horde, Orc or Undead? I was going to go undead but I've seen a couple people say the stun resistance/pet damage of orc would work better vs the large amount of alliance warriors/palas.
---
Wait whaaat? Since when can you crit so high in Vanilla? Can someone explain this to me?
---
We just had a post (that the user later deleted) about three hours ago arguing that we're too harsh on the removal of low-effort memes. Can y'all just fight it out and then whoever survives gets to decide?
---
I'm an American and can confirm, that shit was really, really American.  Like, fucking eagles flying by amidst fireworks level American.
---
False, the costs were reversed very late. The armored mounts were introduced in 1.4.
---
Good. It wouldn't be Classic WoW without the [classics.](http://www.leagueofpirates.com/sirvival/queuedance.html)
---
&gt; And if you are so try hard you have to prove your worth and make a point, why aren't you playing a class that is optimized for maximum effectiveness?
---
Because 1) some people think druids are fun and 2) some people like a challenge and 3) some people don't want to always go with the flow
---
I think he's the bear, actually.
---
This is approx 68% of the reason I've chosen to main Hunter for the first time come classic.
---
Available for purchase at your local Ravenholdt hideout
---
Taran‚Äôs Icebreaker and Stockade Pauldrons while leveling
---
I love Tauren, thought I also like healing. 
---
Are Tauren good healers at all? Which class is the best option?
---
10% armor = less rage
---
parry = faster white hit, rage
---
block = less dmg, rage
---
dodge = no dmg
---
 anticipation is the winner for me as a tank
---
So Jealous. I wanted that Nem helm all through Vanilla!!! Killed Ony so many damn times and never got it. Had full tier 1 but never got that damn Helm.
---
Holy fuck, nice work man. Where did you get the zone/leveling guide?
---
Best mage water is 4200 mana over 30 seconds. Enriched Manna Biscuits do 4410 over 30. 
---
Gotta look out for that suspect water scripting!
---
Yes if you want to get into raids easily, go shaman. However, the odd few feral dps and sprists may be able to sneak in too.
---
I heard they have bootleg versions in the cleft of shadow :P
---
Duel Spec is beyond quality of life. It would remove the need to align your character with a specific need. A tank chooses to be a tank for specific reasons or a healer chooses to be a healer for a specific reason. It's an investment in their guild, their friends and their community. If you delute that by letting people pick their spec for a specific moment and flip flop back and forth, it renders their choices less meaningful. Plus, respec cap is a necessary gold sink late in the economy.  I think that is the problem with most QOL improvements is that they change larger aspects of the game or community than just the improvement of the QOL item.   
---
Infact, I think QOL improvements are to blame for much of the state of retail. Most notably the LRG/R. You don't have to know anyone anymore.... they're just faceless people summoned to help you. On the surface it solves one of the largest problems of the game.... trying to fill parties having trouble but it eroded so much of the community I'd hope that if we could do it all over again they'd never roll it out.
---
I admire your passion. I‚Äôll have to consider that and look around a little bit to see if I can find a guild of like minded people. PvE is nice and all but my ultimate end game is PvP. PvE is just a means to become a more equipped PvPer
---
I had only been level 60 for about two weeks when a friend asked if I wanted to join a raiding guild due to a shortage of druids.  I agreed and headed to Molten Core (there was never a moment that I specifically decided I was going to be a raider, but luckily I had completed the attunements).  I had no clue what I was doing but one of the giants dropped a Cenarion belt and it went to me because there were only  2 druids in the raid, and the other one already had it.  I was so ecstatic about getting my first epic that was all I could think about the whole week.
---
The hilarious part is that the Cenarion belt is actually one of the worst pieces of any of the T1 sets, but it had more stats than whatever blue I was wearing (Wildheart, I believe). AND IT WAS PURPLE.  Also worth noting this was really early in Vanilla, BWL was not released yet.  I think it was maybe around the time between patch 1.4 and 1.5 approximately...
---
If I had to have an in game change. Guild banks
---
If out of game change. Re order characters on select screen
---
Honestly hadn't thought about it till today but trying to min max a 29 rogue was an incredibly rewarding experience for me back in the day. I might do it just to redeem my horrific fuck up of leveling to 30 with at or close to BiS.
---
Couldn't care less about memes, but if there was a way to filter out the word "viable" I'd be one happy corpse-camper.
---
Looking at this I don't know whether I'm impressed or depressed damn son it's like a study guide for an exam
---
I didn‚Äôt necessarily agree with space goats, but at least it didn‚Äôt clash with the established universe.
---
Hey I actually found some old guildies. Shoutout to u/jagera93 from GLORY - Aegwynn.
---
Dude. Yes.
---
haha, yeah i will roll horde. gl
---
Did they do a free weekend or something recently?
---
&gt;Life at 60, the complete collection
---
yeah they are as soon as you hit any Npc
---
Cheers, will drop by and say hi!
---
the music still gives me chills
---
Have a Classic summer, Australia!
---
Hahah. That‚Äôs just how it‚Äôs gonna be   for the less ‚Äòmeta‚Äô classes / specs sadly. A good hunter will be well respected by his guild though if he does his job properly.
---
2-4 Druids is fine, any more and it's kinda silly. Even though ill be a Druid. A druid is just not as good pure dps, or tank, or healer as other classes. Bringing 2 Feral cats on average will be less raid dps than 2 rogues or furys. HOWEVER, I will always bring a good and dedicated player over class.
---
I have a similar fear - in US, there are 2 server locations - east and west - and Blizzard does not make that inherently known, people much smarter than I find out the locations (and their respective battle groups) via ping times and other techy resrouces. The location impacts your ping (not necessarily a lot, but enough for you to notice the difference) based on the distance from your physical location.
---
The point I‚Äôm trying to get to is that there will be no way for me to find out if the server I chose is west or east, but I plan on playing day one (partly because I want to lock in my toon name). If I later find out I chose the wrong server, I‚Äôll have to make a new character with not my name on a different server and be behind everyone, or deal with slightly increased lag.
---
Great! This website is going to be the #1 place to be for Classic WoW. So much hard work and passion these people are putting into this. This is where the heart and soul of Classic is.
---
It's casual in comparison of what's needed for rank 14.
---
Did you break Ayle's character planner?
---
My issue with dual spec is less the money sink and more that it removes hybrid specs.  Finding a balance in your spec between two things you want to do (Dps/tank, PvE/PvP ect) is the only really "unsolved" spec because it's based so much on how much you value activity A vs activity B.
---
If you farm that up go for it.  Its 2000 hours of farming at 50g/hour.  More power to ya!
---
His twitter is like all pro-trump politics these days, which is weird because he doesn't even live in the US.
---
 [https://www.joanasworld.com/azeroth.htm](https://www.joanasworld.com/azeroth.htm)  \- made some altercations based on my own testing and adding in rogue specific things like quests, grind spots, and good spots for lock picking drops but here is the just of it. Joana is a godsend.
---
Who?
---
From what I understand Rogue would be easiest dps wise as you rely heavily on +hit gear and keeping your slice and dice? I think it is up. Which is why a dal rends rogue can still compete dps wise into raids. Wars arent bad but it cost A ton of gold for the helm and devil saur stuff.

This. Amusingly sharding at launch is probably closer to 'no changes' than not having it, seeing as the people you'd see on your 1-20 shard would be similar in number to how many you would see in a few weeks time in those zones anyway.
---
I see dynamic respawning cited as a solution, but IMO that's far worst than sharding as then you have to deal with instantly-respawning mobs (and possibly ores/herbs) causing some low level quests to just be constant corpse runs, Frostmane Hold comes to mind.
---
Sharding is a necessary evil. But only at the very beginning.
---
Yeah, but the exception is priests. Night elf priest (and female lul) is going to be fucking laughed at.
---
Keep the memes keep the hype. The upvotes decide
---
On a 4-6 hour timer with 75% drop rate?
---
That's like 26.666 (repeating of course) hours to get 4 bags if you camp all the spawns.
---
In 26 hours you can level up to like 35 and have the 8g needed to just buy four 10 slot vendor bags.
---
I know the feeling all to well. Gives me something to do in between studying for Security+ and checking this sub lol.
---
Druids and Shamans are both solid. Shamans are probably in greater demand as raid healers.
---
Yes they are good, I suggest Druid and Shaman.
---
Random: I like your critical font choice.  Will change mine to match.
---
Orcs are generally considered to be superior in PvP beacause of the stun resist.
---
Awesome! You‚Äôre a star!!! üòÄ
---
Allow me to solve this for you.
---
Both of these classes simply shoot a ball at a boss, the only option here is down to blue or purple.
---
Both of these classes regenerate mana well, the option comes down to hurting yourself to do so, or channeling for a few seconds / eating a jewel
---
Both of these classes get eaten alive in PVP, but one of them has reliable forms of CC that an entire (very popular) race can't immediately break out of
---
One of these classes has to carry around an entire bag of purple jewels before every raid and summon the entire cast of 37 other people.
---
One of these classes can instantly send themselves to any major city in the game
---
One of these classes is the best money making class in game
---
Could I buy your version? I need a horde rogue leveling guide
---
Well, it's not like I am in a hurry and I did it in the demo too, for fun XD.
---
Yes, of course. Especially 2H Weapons.
---
For you, I choose Lock.
---
What, you don‚Äôt like having a level 23, a level 1, two 60s, a 29 twink, and another 60?
---
It's actually a massively popular opinion
---
Yea you get it man it's actually closer to no-changes, sharding can go away as level differences begin but it is necessary. Without it you mine as well say good bye to questing unless you're leading the pack in progress.

Dont have a gf and friends and family hates me already so i guess im good
---
Fun. I want fun. What is the most satisfying class to play?
---
"Uhh, I only date *mages*."
---
Deadman‚Äôs hand was memorable for me too!
---
Swarthy female dwarf paladin (to juxtapose the yellow and white of your abilities) and tailoring/herbalism.
---
I think you have it switched
---
Conversation has been going in circles for months. Same questions asked day in and day out. An average day is 3 memes and 40 questions that have already been asked. The memes get the upvotes.
---
What I am saying is search by /new.
---
Spells that cost reagents are great imo. Same as hunter ammo. Adds flavor to the game
---
Boy, we've got casters at home!
---
Although be prepared for some serious elitism/gatekeeping this time around.
---
Going to be a lot of people pretending vanilla is hard and min-maxing is important
---
I hated this scene as a child, its like nothing else in the film.
---
I've already accepted that its coming out in September. Worst case scenario I am wrong and pleasantly surprised.
---
Lol, I think you're right!
---
A difficult question about what to pick.
---
picking between warrior, priest, shaman, warlock, hunter
---
* Played **warrior** in cataclysm and it was fun(they were op, but climbed to 2400), so probably wanna do it again, but looks like there will be A LOT of warriors on the start at least(not sure how many of them will make it to 60. Fun in PVP in pve, but needs gear
---
* **Hunter** \- played on private server 6/8 T2, was  pretty much fun in pvp and pve.
---
* **Priest** \- never actually played a lot, so probably why I wanna pick it(also mind control). fun in pve but probably boring and sucking from mages/shamans/rogues/warriors. But will be everyone friend as its a healer.
---
* **Warlock** \- never actually played, fun playstyle, lots of hp (geared) , lots of fun quests, petc etc. Fun in pvp and pve, only will roll for horde side.
---
* **Shaman** \- played on classis wow on official servers back in days, was pretty much fun, but never gave elemental spec a chance, , is it even a thing? Pretty good in pvp and pve(or is it just my opinion. was geared on lvl of MC and ZG
---
Would be great to hear people opinion, what should I roll.
---
And redundant questions/posts like "Post Naxx Content?" and "When is the Release Date".
---
Ok then you just grab a healer druid instead because it is actually useful and I can give DPS to an actual DPS spec.
---
I bought 7 cleaned out all my toons.
---
Yeah but I mean if you're gonna compare a ret paladin to a fury warrior for example you need to compare them in a situation where they use the same consumables and equal gear levels otherwise it's not really a fair comparison.
---
Here's a macro for you all:  
---
`` /run f=function(i) o='' for I=-(string.len(i)),-1 do o=o..string.sub(i,-I,-I) end return o end RunScript(f("dne )(metIrosruCeteleD )P(metIyrotnevnIpukciP od 32,0=P rof"))``  
---
#Just kidding, do NOT run this macro lol
---
I stand with the Meme House. Someone stand with the losing side to fite me.
---
My STV playlist is gonna be full of 60's-70's anti-Vietnam rock.
---
Yeah sucks for us people that cant play a ton, but still part of what the game was and would ruin economies. Just like wow tokens.
---
No furor, no insect swarm, no nature's swiftness. Feelsbadman. Your spell crit is going to be really really low. Banking on nature's grace is gonna feel awful.
---
Hilarious but that's exactly the same way most people looked at them in vanilla, from my experience.  No stats? No crit?  Ehhhhh.  Turns out few people, if anyone, actually knew what they were doing.
---
lmao you think thats gonna be cheap on a fresh server??? Crazy asf
---
Never really planned on raiding because i knew it was bad (and getting even worse from MC onwards). Just wanted to see some actual numbers.
---
Realistically ill spent most of my time in AV or other BGs and maybe the odd Pug raid every now and then. But the effort is not worth it, thats for sure.
---
I use the wheel clock for target nearest enemy and the top left for target self. I only use buttons 1 to 6 I can‚Äôt comparably use 7 to 12. I use Shift or Ctr 1 to 6 also.
---
Being able to rearrange the user interface to reflect your keys really helps so hopefully addons are available soon after launch.
---
I guess thats just another reason not to add duel specs. The money sink is what affects the entire server while hybrid specs only effect you and your raid more than likely though.
---
your logic is so flawed.
---
I'd wait for the beta/demo/pinata to see which macros will work. In theory it should be new retail system but they made spell batching so they might as well decide to go back to old macro system.
---
C h i l l
---
Yes, but you can still login to the game and check your characters, but you can't play with them if you dont have an active subscription.
---
Only problem with having 2 mega threads is we dont have the other sticky that rotates through-out the week.
---
What the heck does that do?
---
Warriors are very strong with any class that can heal.
---
Warlock/ Paladin is a great combo since he can use Blessing of Wisdom on your pets so they won't go out of mana as often. And it does happen quite often, if you're chainpulling mobs at least. 
---
Hunters are so strong soloing stuff that it almost feels like a waste leveling with someone else, but that's just my opinion.
---
You should honestly just pick the class that appeals to you the most, even if it's not the most optimal combo with a paladin
---
The "I'm level 30! I can quest in STV now! :D" No... No you can't.
---
Hey Garnett here, I currently don't have any friends that I plan to play classic with when it drops, so I'm looking for a guild for at least phases 1-3+
---
I'm happy to apply to any guilds that are interested of course, but heres some background info on me in the meantime.
---
I'm looking for an East coast server guild that plans on doing a lot of 5 mans, 10 mans, and eventually plans to raid BWL in phase 3+. My end goal for the character is to farm full t2 and go spell power holy to push R11+ premade pvp content as a healer.
---
\[Don't worry -- I'm not another ignorant Shockadin, I'll play the build like a true healer 80% of the time, but I just have a 1 shot combo every 3 minutes to aggressively burst, duel or defend myself.\]
---
Here is my content progression build plan:
---
1 - 40: Ret
---
40 - 60: Protection (20/31/0)
---
Phase 1: Protection (20/31/0)
---
Phase 2: Protection (20/31/0)
---
Phase 3: Once significant +SP from T2 -- 31 Holy Shock
---
**On my build\*\***
---
For phases 1 and 2 I'm going deep Protection (20/31/0). This build enables me to heal small and raid grouped content via Illumination, while also allowing me to $olo thorns farm, and even offtank (when rarely appropriate). The build also lets me contribute Sanctuary to raids. I'll happily go Holy Reck (or even 31 Holy) when BWL comes out if it gets me a casual spot to collect Judgement gear.
---
\-----------In phase 1 I plan to collect 6 piece Lightforge, which means I'll be doing A LOT of BRD, scholo, strat, &amp; UBRS. Largely as a healer, but also maybe eventually as a tank as well.
---
**Background on me as a player:**
---
I played a warrior offtank in classic, arena pvp'd at a r1 &amp; gladiator level in TBC, Wrath and MoP. I'm approaching my 30s so I only have time to play casually -- early in the morning &amp; weeks when I'm "off work" mostly -- ...BUT. I'm a super competent gamer, and being an esports coach professionally, I'm relentlessly positive, I'm an outstanding communicator in game, and I'm great for guild/group culture.
---
Please let me know here or in DMs if your guild is looking for a great pally that primarily heals, but also contributes a niche tanking role for specific circumstances. Also let me know the server you hope to roll on, or how to contact as classic approaches of course.
---
Thanks for taking the time, cheers,
---
Garnett
---
4 piece paladin PvP set was pretty good,10s off HoJ. With talents it made HoJ a 35s CD
---
How does that improve the raid DPS or HPS? How does that improve tank mitigation or threat?
---
Yeah, but if you have xp off you only que with other people with xp off. So you'll basically never play a game outside of peak hours. Even then you'll wait at least an hour to get in.
---
I double dare you to use it.
---
Moonkins were such a joke my guild gave sulfuras to one just so he could afk on top of the orgrimmar bank while wearing it in moonkin form to tease all the noobs in blues.
---
Ah so this is private server footage? I didn't think that was allowed here.
---
&gt; I come to the subreddit is for discussion about wow.
---
What discussion? Just about everything there is to discuss has already been discussed to death.
---
All the "discussion" threads are about the same 10ish topics:
---
1. Release date
---
2. Balance changes
---
3. What should I play?
---
5. Meme specs are fine
---
6. How to make gold as X class
---
7. Will classic have X, Y, Z, thing?
---
8. What happens after naxx?
---
9. What professions should I learn?
---
10. Various pvp related questions
---
If anything we need to do something about these posts being brought up 20 times per day.
---
No but if they're going to do unarmored then they probably will do where the prices are flipped and the mount is what was expensive.
---
should have aimed for a mage.
---
Planning on doing skinning up to 60 to vendor mostly.  Being frugal by buying no gear. AoE farming if possible in dungeons or the plaguelands. Phase 1 should be about 3 months, so I think 160 gold with the discounts should be pretty doable for most people, if this is truly how they'll release the mounts.
---
The gathering professions are good for money making. Enchanting is decent with Tailoring as you can disenchant the items you make for enchanting materials.
---
Dude why did you have to go ahead and be a dick about this?
---
For sure. I wonder if a compromise would be that if you use dual spec, every respec is now 50g regardless. No decay, no gradual increased cost, etc.
---
Hi, /u/ParticipationTotems
---
obvious rogue. any day everyday
---
Man.. a lot of classes really don't need one at all until like late aq40 and up. You must have been in a very cutting edge guild or just a masochist.
---
Actually not sure if it works anymore, but it used to delete all of your equipped gear. Recently a streamer got told from his twitch chat to try run it and he was silly enough to do it lol :p  
---
You can see it here https://www.twitch.tv/videos/415070822?t=45m
---
So no other class/spec can be played by reliable people?
---
Such great power only comes to those brave enough to play as ret?
---
Thanks, I didn't know about the nifty stopwatch.
---
Rather bold opinion.  
---
I tend to look at it in a few different lights.  
---
1.) Did someone ask in zone for help from being ganked over and over?  
---
2.) Are you on a pve server and someone was dumb enough to flag over and over to lose to someone?
---
3.) Does it appear to be an even duel where two about even level users from x factions saw each other and decided to have a little fight?  
---
Each of these would warrant a different reaction from me, which is why I plan to PVE. PVP, these all go out the window. Kill anyone Red at all times ever. Seems to be about 75% of the pvp polulation.
---
I was playing a rogue on a PvP server back then. I was 13 years old at the time and I spent most of my time trying to be the new Kishkumen (World of Roguecraft creator) by frapsing sone cool clips from WPvP. 
---
There was one particular spot that I really loved to PvP at though. It was Tyr‚Äôs Hand in Eastern Plaguelands. 
---
As a rogue, it was the perfect oppourtunity for me to kill people without spending all of my cooldowns. I was an evil fuck. 
---
I remember one incident clearly though. I was doing my regular thing in Tyr‚Äôs Hand and as I had just killed a poor soul, the elite he was killing started attacking me. I somehow managed to get the tag on it and after I had killed it, I looted the body as if it was a boar from Elwynn Forest. 
---
I couldn‚Äôt believe my own eyes when I saw the [Glowing Brightwood Staff] in the loot window. My first ever epic and it was mine! I knew what this weapon was selling for (it‚Äôs a lot more than what it has ever sold for on any private server, lol) and the fact that I got it over the other guy who was peacefully grinding gold before I came along, only made the satisfaction of it even greater. 
---
To this day, I still get a bit of a kick out of it when thinking about it - even though I was such an asshole back then.
---
Hi, /u/Bouchdag
---
Nope. Warriors just need to spam sunder armor for crusader procs then switch to smite's hammer with 15agi and proceed to 3 shot hunters with fishing hat/boots. Having a twink warrior on you is one of the few problems you'll face in the bracket though.
---
Girlfriend... hah
---
Are you me?
---
/u/Roobscoob Like this guy.
---
These days? Are you sure you're referring to the same person. The actual Kungen hasn't been supportive of Trump and furthermore has been inactive since late 2018.
---
I'm not sure what you mean by these days...
---
Is it not working? Seems fine to me.
---
rogues also need devilsaur set and compete with warriors/hunters for shoulders and swords in ubrs iirc
---
We weren‚Äôt that good and not very hardcore really. We did a couple (maybe 4 or 5) bosses in AQ and two bosses in Naxx. I think we were probably the 5-7th best guild on our server.
---
The only people who say shit like this are private server fanboys who never played vanilla.  You have zero clue about what its like, only what holds true in your fantasy lands.
---
Blizzard like still changed vanilla. Just in more minor ways.
---
How does grouping EU and Ocenia make any sence in comparison to grouping NA and Oceania who have more in common?
---
Private servers aren't the same as vanilla was, there are changes.
---
i use 1-7  and shift 1-4 on the side and the top 3 buttons. If i feel like it ill bind mouse10 to world map.
---
Security+ is good. I assume if you are getting certs you are trying to get into IT or just started in IT in the last 1-3 years?
---
As a long time IT guy, and ex IT Manager. Be aware certs are only good in the beginning, the matter less and less once you gain more real job exp. But having them never hurts.
---
Not that you asked, but how I studied for my certs, including my security_ was by reading a good study guide book about 4-5 times. I never focused too much on actively trying to remember what I was reading. But after reading the same book 5 times in row you basically memorize everything without really noticing. Then take your exam asap before it leaves your brain.
---
There are a lot of people on this sub who will argue endlessly that every spec is viable. Well while that might be true, it's also a heck of a lot easier to just roll a mage or warlock and do significantly more damage with significantly less effort. Yesterday I was in a very lengthy argument about feral druids being good end game tanks. Like why? Just bring a warrior who will be way better and can switch specs to be literally the best in the game.
---
Neeeeerrrrrrdddddd
---
[https://mobile.twitter.com/wowkungen](https://mobile.twitter.com/wowkungen)
---
He links to his twitch stream and last posted 13 days ago.
---
Yeah that's why it was rare, since you had to have 1000 gold before 1.4 and then not trade it in for the armored ones.  If they go with the 1.12 pricing scheme on release, like half the server will have the unarmored mounts I'd think.
---
Drinking in combat wouldn't do much in pvp.
---
Getting into implementing new mechanics and that would add to dev time. I dont like it. Me being one of those people that get to play 12-15 ish hours a week and planning on raiding during most of that Id rather just pay the gold, get the game released and play as much as I could. 
---
I don't agree with compromising with anything that changes game play. We're already compromising a lot when it comes to sharding / loot trading and stuff like that.
---
They've said like 100 times that they will make no balance changes...
---
That's cold blooded to take out a fellow class member.
---
group leader: i found a mage, would you be willing to heal, druid?

Yeah, I remember that I stacked willpower on my hunter because I run out of mana all the time. Didn't work out that well ;)

That helm is Tier 2 :)

Hey guys I'm doing the minimum! Aren't I a good team player?
---
Try that mindset anywhere in real life and see how fast you're removed or at least disliked.
---
Where are you seeing 13 days ago? His twitch has videos from over 2 years ago.
---
Just curious.
---
Back in the days. Did you buy TBC, went to Hellfire and said ‚Äúfuck this game‚Äù?
---
How would drinking in combat affect pvp?
---
Not going to happen.
---
Troll post? lmao, wont be any class balancing. Weak classes / specs will remain weak!
---
You realize I said Twitter not Twitch right?
---
true

The min maxer will begin this mindset on character creation and probably play a different class.
---
There's only been like 100000 or so threads on the same topic, but the answer is still NO
---
well, never a crit that big that wasnt setup
---
Literally no guild will run grace of air over windfury. Ferals are definitely more viable on alliance.
---
Well depends on your spirit really. Usually anything but mages should fill up after a full drink.
---
I think this would actually be my preferred implementation.  It'd make the unarmored epic mounts rare if they were only available in phase 1, and also make it so having multiple races mounts less likely.
---
I'm East Coast and you are 11 hours ahead of me. Oceanic might be your best bet as they would only be a few hours off of your TZ.
---
None.
---
I do however, VIVIDLY remember [Ring of Saviors](http://classicdb.ch/?item=1447) dropping as I was tanking Maraudon, it happened during the ooze packs. I figured stamina+armor use effect meant it was for tanks. I was ecstatic. And then the warlock wins it. "Stamina is good for warlocks bro, we Life Tap. I need".
---
No bueno.
---
I also remember the run I did where the group got a 60 player to help us through all of BRD. Took around 5 hours IIRC, finishing at 3am. Three epics dropped, two of them in the bar alone. [Taran Icebreaker](http://classicdb.ch/?item=2915), [Hammer of the Northern Wind](http://classicdb.ch/?item=810) and a third that I think was either [Glowing Brightwood Staff](http://classicdb.ch/?item=812) or [Warden Staff](http://classicdb.ch/?item=943).
---
The same guy won the roll on all three. Wasn't me, but was awesome for that guy, those items paved the way for quite a bit of stuff once he hit 60.
---
Ouch
---
Warrior can hamstring kite which makes them better levelers than rogues who have to face tank everything. Gear dependence doesn't matter when every group is going to want you.
---
Priests and druids have talent to continue to regen a % of that outside the mp5 rule
---
I think shamans aswell
---
Paladins really don‚Äôt use that
---
How do the initial tokens enter the economy then? There would still be economic consequences
---
You're a next level gamer.
---
Bad, and the main goal of enhance isn't even dps, it's to be a nightfall axe bot and maybe totem twister for the melee.
---
Hi, /u/ASIWYFA11
---
what's HoTW?
---
Im pretty sure what blocks mana regen is spells with a cast time / channeling, not instant casts
---
Swift Zulian Panther. Oh man what a glorious mount...
---
Yeah that's what I was guessing too
---
How many times old man ... how many times ...
---
Every second you can wait after 5 is increasingly valuable.  Your mana regenerates at a faster rate and it's usually done like this in dungeons blues when guilds add 1or2 extra healers to the raid.  That way you can rotate and regenerate.  Simple concept but its actually real hard to stand still and not do anything in a fight for like 20-40 seconds lol.
---
This is very relevant to when walking into Moonbrook for the first time
---
I didn‚Äôt know there was an ability to dup. items.
---
I'M ALSO STUCK HERE TOO. I LIKE MAGE BECAUSE ITS NOSTALGIC AND FOR THE MOST PART IT LIKE IT. BUT WARLOCKS ARE EFFICIENT AND THEIR ARMOR IS REALLY COOL IDK WHAT TO DO.
---
Depends a lot, but honestly few times you actually need to make use of it as a healer. Also it works a bit differently on priest/druid because they have a talent that allows a % of the mana regen to work while casting, and that means they get the regular 3 second mana ticks even in when casting and the 5 second rule doesn't apply before then next tick after 5 seconds.
---
honestly it's not really a big deal.
---
I AM NOT PREPARED.
---
I've never read the WoW Chronicles, but I cannot recommend highly enough Lord of the Clans, Rise of the Horde, and Arthas. They all set the stage lore-wise for vanilla WoW and are some of my favorite novels even to this day. Definitely must-reads for all WoW fans.
---
Leather even.
---
&gt; Deals double damage of the minimum needed
---
&gt; Hey guys I'm doing the minimum! 
---
Fantastic reading comprehension.
---
It means that the longer you can wait between casting spells, the longer you can afford to wait, the more Mana you will get back, but you have to wait at least five seconds in order to benefit from that.
---
instant casts do aswell.
---
I work in Telecomm right now, was an desktop admin before that. I have a few contract jobs open to me right now but they require Sec+ before i can continue. I have a plan set out, i'm one week into studying and should be taking the exam in about 3 weeks. should have everything down by them. Thanks for the advice!
---
Thankfully a lot of the shit they want is crafted.
---
well, scrolling through the content in the mega-thread, I'd say that roughly 60% is NA guilds or NA players LFG. So I was just cutting it into two kinda similiar size bits
---
I raided hardcore as a Tauren Shaman until Cataclysm. Nobody gave a shit about what race we were, they just wanted the Jesus Noodle.
---
If your guild isn't full of idiots, your first MC run, Ragnar oh shouldn't take so long that a moonkin in blue gear will run out of Mana. Mana is not an issue unless your guild is terrible and fights are taking five times as long as they should.
---
Dont mind me then
---
It doesn't.
---
that logic doesn't really fly. the dal rend offhand is terrible for melee unless you have the set, so why should rogue get to roll before hunter?
---
[Opt-in Only WPvP truly is the patrician choice, when you get down to it.](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/218/305/85e.jpg)
---
As a caster this means you want to front load your spells and when an enemy is about to die, use your wand instead of spells. This will kickstart your mana regeneration so you have less downtime between fighting mobs.
---
For example. If I am a caster and I cast my last spell while fighting a mob 7 seconds before it dies, and wand it down over the last 7 seconds it is alive, then I have regenerated more mana than if I had finished the mob off with a spell. This additional mana regenerated adds up overtime and will increase the speed at which you complete quests and ultimately will affect how quickly you get to level 60.
---
Anything under 80h/week is casual AF
---
So hoard Assassin's Blade and Feet of the Lynx, gotcha.
---
I feel that im gonna use consecration on stuff like if i try to grind many mobs at once and rank 1 for unstealthing rogues. 
---
Ill check Drakovas channel, thanks.
---
I'll clarify. 
---
Minor changes to super underperforming specs to bring them closer to the back of the meters is good, as long as it doesn't affect PvP balance.
---
Drinking in combat would not be the most massive buff to PvP, but would be a lame, clunky change for PvE balance in itself
---
10. How do I make my wife/gf play?
---
I bet they‚Äôre red in the face.
---
Nice! I haven't ever done much contract work to be fair, but I have heard of requiring certain certs to get the job.
---
Sounds like you are on top of it. Goodluck!
---
Yeah, pretty sure its LOTR refference."One (1) ring to rule them all"
---
*shocked Pikachu
---
Yes :(
---
Shit, forgot to add #10, but yeah that works too :D
---
Doing half as much as your friends while reaping the same rewards. You're basically a leech. Excellent comprehension of what is required to be a contributing member of a raid.
---
Skeram mind controls you, makes all of your skills instant cast, and increases your damage by 300%.
---
Lots of mind controls are or were scary because they basically made you hit almost as hard as the boss and on random people.
---
The mainhand is way more useful for a combat swords rogue even without the offhand
---
I'm not a vanilla expert. But I did heal in the end of  vanilla a bit and my take on it was... gear with mp5 always ticks even while casting. After 5 seconds of not casting, you get your out of combat generation rate on top of your mp5. So you want to wait as long as possible without casting again. 
---
But just reaching the 5s must spike your regen rate even if you cast right after. Not sure if you get 1 tick of the extra or 5 full seconds or whatever though. Either way not casting for 5s has helped pace mana usage and likely given a little extra regen bump as well. Hopefully someone can reply more specifically with values.
---
Believe me I know! lol. Killed Ony probably 40+ times for it and it only dropped like 4 times. Lost out on it from either lower DKP or in a roll off :*(((((((((. The last time I missed out on it I was so upset pretty much made me hate the guild I was in since they gave it to a new person rather than me when I had been raiding with them for over a year.
---
Skeram MC is called True Fulfillment and is really, really fun.
---
Emerald whelp right?
---
Twink vs Twink premades were popular and competitive
---
Woah that‚Äôs totally what‚Äôs gonna happen shit. Will it be John?
---
Tier 2 helm, Tier 1 Shoulders, Dreadmist chest. Had to look up the gloves to get the specific name but I know they dropped in MC. Gloves of the hypnotic flame. They're so distinct
---
Making low performing specs viable is reasonable. Small changes like giving paladins a taunt isn't really game breaking.
---
The inclusion of more armor/weapons to fill some missing slots such as more healing plate armor. While I'm all for classes having to share many of the options I personally feel that end game choices should consist of your highest armor type. 
---
I'd Really like the inclusion of more 2h healing weapons that compare to mace + offhand/shield.
---
Obviously, I'm going in as a holy paladin and I want my fantasy, damn it!
---
Omg I love you
---
Of course. He died once and came back.
---
no probs, I got you lol
---
I think people usually paired gauntlets, bracer, and belt. That way you can use the t2.5 5/5 bonus along with it so the best raid healing capabilities available.
---
Isnt that one of the quests you get on the way out of the starting area, that points you to the inn?
---
I'm not going to run it but I still desire to know its function.
---
Awesome! I played OG vanilla but only hit 54. The only endgame I‚Äôve experienced was TBC
---
How do you farm a rare spawn?
---
Of course its an excuse to stomp lowbies. What other better feeling is there than shutting down some cocky level 19 twink stealthing in westfall.
---
Nope. 
---
Boomkins in raid will be spamming starfire, which benefits from curse of shadow, so they have the same spell pen as any warlock or mage in the raid. 
---
Fights in raids are not long enough for moonkins to go OOM unless half the raid or more has wiped by the time the boss is dead. Mana pots and demonic runes are not optional raid consumes for any caster class. The mana cost of starfire vs. a typical mana pool in pre-raid BIS gear for a moonkin is not any higher than that of shadowbolt or fireball. It might be slightly less efficient than frostbolt, but it also scales better with gear than frostbolt, so...
---
Oof that is rough!  You going warlock in classic too?  Perhaps your luck will change!
---
I suddenly got the feeling I might've actually had a pair of those gloves in my bank on my main.  Not sure if I actually did but the more I think about it the more I think I had them...
---
=\]
---
The chronicle books are very good. They will walk you through all of the lore so you‚Äôre refreshed for classic!
---
alt + 1 etc
---
But my computer isn't a laptop.
---
Well it probably still needs few fixes :D i tagged pve and druid. Was rewarded with : Bis weapons for rogue twinks.
---
Add /follow on another ranged dps and /focus macro and you can truly veg out during your raid.
---
This would be the ideal situation yes. I was just saying if they happen to want to play classes with the same armor class, it wont be the end of the world and there‚Äôs a silver lining to losing gear.
---
Mage or warlock. I like both equally. I played mage till WotLK and loved it till Cata changes. Lock seems really cool in most regards. What do!?
---
I'll rub it in a bit, I got it in an Ony pug my guild was running and i got it at level 58. Kept me motivated to hit 60 rofl.
---
Even without gouge vanish is still a tool mages have no equal to in terms of escaping a high level.
---
Lmao that's /r/watchpeopledieinside material
---
Sounds good, maybe it will even help decide what i will play.
---
C V B for cat bear and travel. Adjust forms from left to right depending on your spec and which one you use most often.
---
&gt; Doing half as much as your friends while reaping the same rewards.
---
Oh I see, you are just an envious kid that doesn't want other people to get the same as you because they aren't showing their e-peen.
---
That's fine. You do you, play with the other 10 fury warriors, and let the other people play specs that work absolutely fine and do more than the minimum, even if they are worse. Just don't be such a sad excuse of an asshole.
---
Good day!
---
Bad idea. The hangover from it will keep you from playing for longer than it will help. And your mind wont function any better on it either.
---
As long as it's put together with all the love it deserves, I can wait. That said, I might lose my sanity.
---
I am stealing this idea, lmao.
---
Uhhh no, I just don't like carrying people.
---
Warlock is super fun. Has the great benefit of having 1 spec the whole time. SM/Ruin is great from Day 1 in MC to end of Naxx, and also great in PvP.
---
See now THAT is top tier.
---
So I'm having a tough time deciding which class I should choose for classic. I started playing late TBC and never really got too much into the PVE aspect of the game. I would really like to do both PVP and PVE this time around, however I think I'd like a class that has the most viable spec for both situations. For example as a priest obviously I'd have to respect constantly if I wanted to heal for raids and then do shadow in PVP. Is there any class thats like this? I'm currently leaning the most towards lock. Is lock able to Raid and PvP with the same exact spec, and if not which class can?  Thanks in advanced!
---
&gt; They aren't carrying you when the person you replied to literally said that moonkins deal nearly double the needed damage.
---
&gt; Carrying would be being below that threshold...
---
Website is down for me.
---
Awesome to hear. Everyone makes it seem mandatory or I will be severely gimped. Thanks!
---
Lol i'm guessing that means Healing Wave XD
---
What is that lil twiggy off-hand I have? Cant remember to save my life.
---
&gt; The problem with moonkins is that a geared moonkin is perfectly fine in T1 raids and is ok in T2, but his dps is not going to scale up after that.
---
That's wrong. Moonkin dps (starfire spam) scales better than frost mage dps, and substantially better than shadow priest dps, since spriest gets next to no value from crit. 
---
It scales worse than fire mage dps or warlock dps. OTOH, this is because both fire mages and warlocks have substantially better than 1:1 scaling with spell crit, due to ignite and improved shadow bolt. So a boomkin in a group of fire mages or warlocks is going to increase the average dps of those 4 casters by about 4-5%. The question becomes, can the boomkin maintain 80-85% of the dps of those classes? 
---
And actually, yes, they can. If your guild isn't bogarting non-tier caster dps gear from the boomkin, their dps scales well enough that having a boomkin in a group of 4 mages/locks is at least as good as having a 5th mage/lock.
---
I like alchemy for the passive income of arcanite transmute.
---
As others also implied, I think downranking your spells properly negates some of the need to follow the 5s rule. With downrank you'll heal less, but more efficient so you can cast more often.
---
True, was just commenting on total cost. Lionheart is a money sink that rogues luckily dont have to deal with. Their gear can be obtained from dungeons minus the Devilsaur.
---
Chain Heal 4 lyfe
---
&gt; Problem being another fire mage stacks better than the boomie... 
---
that's not what the math says.
---
G600 gang!   
---
LIke someone else commented, you can use an addon to layout your action bar like so
---
Having the action bars visually laid out like above on your screen helps a lot for building the mind/muscle connection. You'll pick it up quick levelling like this.
---
Then you can use modifiers, like shift/alt/ctrl to get a total of 48 buttons.
---
I use the third "click" for push to talk in Discord/Vent.
---
Oooh I like that!! Gonna try it thanks
---
Anyone who claims to be a paladin goes for verigan's fist. It's like the whirlwind axe (I'm exaggerating a tad) for paladins in their 20s.
---
thats a different mindset than your other post, but now id agree on principle. at the end of the day though, people are justified in rolling against whoever they want for main spec gear as long as everyone didnt agree on something previously.
---
Ctrl + 2, 3, 4 for Bear, Cat, Travel/Aquatic
---
I used f1 through f4 for a long time until I found a better setup. Now I use Z, X, C and V. Z is bound to a macro that returns me to human form from any other form. Z, X and C are macros that cast bear, cat and aquatic form respectively, and if I am already in that form, each key automatically power shift me instantly out and back into that same form (for breaking roots and such). Travel form I have bound to a button on the side of my mouse next to where I always bind my mount button.
---
I'm pretty sure it's substantially better. 
---
Moonkin dps scales better with gear than frost mages. In good enough gear, better than AP/frost.
---
Dude thank you
---
Rofl.
---
For the few seconds they can dps without going oom, sure.
---
I don't have a problem with this. Be patient, we want a quality game. Remember, they're re-writing every single line of code in the game!
---
No, actually starfire is very mana efficient and scales very well with gear. People who think moonkin dps is bad have never played with a good moonkin or done any theorycrafting, and I can tell most of the posts in this thread about "lol oomkins" have never raided at all in vanilla.
---
Despite rogue being the most popular class dps. I think im up for the challange, im rolling orc so no much gnking.
---
Once we get the beta and once Classic actually drops, I'm sure you'll see less memes, or at least a lot more content about the actual game.  
---
Right now, there's not really much to talk about, so you get memes.
---
That's what it's all about. Sharing ideas!
---
Exactly my point, but then you hear of those who swear with all consumes/flasks/world buffs/songflowers they can compete. If that level of effort is required to even bring yourself barely to par with others why not do the same on a class that could really make a difference. Contradictory mindset IMO.
---
But I can compete if I put in 10 extra hours to make sure I'm there! Same person with any other reasonable dps class: I'm topping the meters! Part of me wonders if it is just the lack of desire to refill after finally hitting 60 and realizing your class isn't as great as you hoped
---
Thats what i remember.  Wasnt sure if they just did away with it all together or not
---
Well if you want to raid playing fire isn‚Äôt viable until ZG/AQ/Naxx because pretty much everything in MC/BWL and Onyxia is immune to fire damage.
---
TL;DR triggered
---
I believe so
---
Is there an analysis of Grim's videos in there ? :)
---
I think you're talking about [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bd2m0j/research_how_easy_or_hard_is_it_to_get_raid_spots/) post?
---
I will be leveling ambush, because I don't care how long it will take to 60 and I think it's a funner spec.
---
This is gonna sound silly and I wouldn't play a hunter, but they look the best. All of your tier gear is BiS, so you'll always match :D
---
Yes!
---
I like DnD and stuff, so the aesthetic is nice.
---
Yeah, no. This is absolutely not viable at all. I've been playing PvE hunter on vanilla for a year now (currently progressing thru naxx) on vanilla like blizzard like private server and this is not the meta for Max dps for good reason.
---
Don't take my word for it, go check legacyplayers.com and short by vanilla, hunters, and look up the top rankings for naxx bosses, aq40, bwl, mc... anything really..you go melee, you lose insane amount of potential in dps. This is such bad advise.
---
Never thought I'd comment on a post like this but the nostalgia hit me! I was on kilrogg and started in Dominicide(Horde) then moved over to Sanctuary(Horde) - I played a hunter named Rinsewind and eventually moved onto a healing druid named Cutwell. Wish I could go back to those days sometimes :)
---
That server is not an accurate server. 
---
In fact they have the numbers tuned far too low. Mob HP and dmg is too low
---
Damn that looks really cool. I hope it takes off.
---
Oh dude warrior will be a higher % than rogue. Rogue will likely be second most played tho. It's very difficult to max rogue dps tho so if you work on it, it will show and you'll stand out.
---
Zug zug!
---
Mine was "K√∏benhavner st√¶ngerne" translated from danish: Copenhagen Rods. I dont know what that means xd
---
And what everyone wants is what was in Vanilla. This is why you see people talking about 1.12 AV vs 1.5 AV, auto loot, etc.
---
Folks are willing to talk about what was in Vanilla without any retooling beyond.
---
Savvy?
---
Like I said, go play with the 4 other people on dead custom servers if that's what you want.
---
Classic isn't for you, then, and that's fine. Find something else your like and don't try to fuck it up for everyone else.
---
Tyr's hand is where the ring dropped for me aswell, my favorite spot to grind gold tbh :)
---
Stormscale server, Cold Fusion guild. Shaman, Shrakal.
---
Honestly needs to be changed. I have heard that they were static timers for the lotus in og vanilla and there were very few spawns. That promotes a mafia like no other
---
I love chicken!
---
Toxic I think on Korgath. GMs name was Narcosis.
---
I heard the noise when I saw his face... Fucking bird bears.
---
Except amelinda's artisanal marshmallows pay to play, other fellow's raiding of banned accounts for rmt and so on.  Rmt was a syndicate there if you knew the right people.  Also hi reiker.
---
Happy Cake day!
---
You weren't in a guild called Dark knight Alliance, were you? I witnessed this same thing happen when I played on my mage, I was hella jelly.
---
the two mouse buttons right under my scroll wheel
---
Loving the class overviews so far !
---
Would have loved more Druid talk, but I'm biased :)
---
People were aware of how good weapon skill was back then too. You just had to specifically seek out that information.
---
Not in the book but in the mind :p haha.
---
This.  Can we just have the cap still be 50, but the decay tick at something like 5g/day?
---
100%
---
Eternal Fury. Stormscale EU.
---
Honestly, with the phased roll out, and the amount of desire people have to at least see old AV again, I don't understand why you wouldn't change AV each phase, similar to how it changed in vanilla. It starts hard and turtleish, and slowly mellows out into a pve farm. You might find a patch in the middle is close to an interesting BG, if you just buff the armor scraps turn in a bit.
---
Y tho
---
Wouldn't this be a bit of a game-breaking change though? For instance, if I know that the price of mount and training will switch eventually, then I'll level as many characters to 60 as fast as possible, buy them all really cheap mount training, and then when the switch happens, buy them all their mounts for dirt cheap. I could get 5 characters their epic mounts essentially for the price of one, right?
---
Not sure if that's the case, but if it is I think they should implement whatever cost system they want and then leave it unchanged through the patches.
---
One thing is, you don‚Äôt go up there to do it once. You should make sure you have all the quests, and a group that‚Äôs willing to dive that place like 5+ times for gear.
---
Logged in on my old character and managed to find it on the armory :p
---

---
It definitely needs to be early summer. My girlfriend will be traveling for work for 3 months and will be back at the end of September. That's valuable leveling time!
---
Nice I think i was on Sargeras Server one of the original ones
---
I don‚Äôt think you are. Getting Verigans fist by lvl22, is mission critical for Paladins. You don‚Äôt see items with that kind of stats until 30 or so.
---
I don't remember when this changed, so it might be on Classic already, but being able to take long flight paths without stopping would be an acceptable change for me.
---
Warlock. Has the great benefit of having 1 spec the whole time. SM/Ruin is great from Day 1 in MC to end of Naxx, and also great in PvP.
---
&lt;Veni Vidi Vici&gt; on EU Lightning's Blade (horde)
---
Since I'm the lvl 60 guy I'll do what I bloody damn please, thank you.
---
Alright, reasonable decision. See you in Classic.
---
Sup.
---
Yeah sure it'll never be perfect, I wasn't claiming that. But you have to admit that P99 cut down RMT by a ton. Log into a WoW private server and you'll immediately be spammed with gold sellers. People are afraid to even talk about RMT on P99. Amelinda was removed from the staff when the admins found out what she was doing. But you're right, there's definitely been some favors pulled in exchange for some server hardware and such but that shit's so deep the vast majority of the playerbase would never have any idea.
---
Yeah, reading about how hunters can do solo runs for around 150G/hour (apparently) kind of blew my mind, since it took me SO long to get my epic mount. But I don't think there were any well-published strategies at that time - at least I wasn't aware enough to look for them.
---
I'm leaning in that direction :O
---
Nice breakdown. Thanks!
---
Ugh I remember having to help my priest friend kill demons for hours and hours. 
---
He helped me with a ton of stuff and was a good friend but for like 2 weeks everytime I log in "let's farm demons :-)?"
---
You're probably right. It's really hard to do the Westfall quest in your early 20s, but if you can, it's such a powerful weapon for ret and healing
---
Are you planning on adding overlays like boat/zep routes and major cities and hubs?
---
Well in that situation is not even a contest the ret loses
---
I hope they do this since it makes the most real-world sense and really makes each mount more of a statement.
---
1 March - 31 May = Spring
---
1 June - 31 August = Summer
---
I joined in 2006 on Aerie Peak, one of the last new servers I believe. Started out in a small guild called &lt;The Fonzworthies&gt;with 4 friends and we all had different spellings of the name Fonzy.
---
Ended up joining &lt;Delirium&gt; and we were core members there until the guild leader switched servers.
---
For real though. Once I fully realize the impact of no transmog that's a wrap.
---
Ravager is level 37 though. Probably meant 39 shaman. And yea it‚Äôs fun as hell haha
---
hahahahahahahahahah
---
Also a added benefit of being able to physically cross something out once completed!
---
The time it takes to reroll is no doubt a huge factor. In classic I will have my main and maybe one alt, and that's it. It just takes too long to level. I'm not a speedrunner and it takes me 10 days or more. But yeah if you play a top tier dps class you can either just not do those 10 extra hours of farming per week and still do better OR you can actually put in those 10 hours on the other class and really shine. I think people who go into the game wanting to be a moonkin just want the personal challenge, it's just that they ignore the fact that 39 other people now have to carry you just so you can do your little personal challenge.
---
I don't really remember any flower offhande from MC/BWL era. It might be just a flower you bought from the SW flower vendor
---
You can read about real world inflation and money supply.  In this case, the server's gold supply remains unchanged so AH prices are not affected.
---
No, if you make a conscious decision to do less damage than you could, or do be less beneficial than you could, you're being carried.
---
this is amazing thank you!
---
Hrm honestly it looks like a flower you bought from the SW flower vendor. I can't remember if MC/BWL had a flower offhand
---
Priors of Sion
---
Barrens has isn‚Äôt even contested territory lol.
---
Hey u/magues17, sorry to be a pita, but your post was removed because it links to a private server gameplay video and also advertises the private server's name in the video description. The rest of your post would be fine (and I actually like the idea), but because of the video linked, I need to remove your post per rule #4. If you remove that video link I can re-approve your post, or you can re-post it yourself without the video link. Otherwise, please try r/wowservers for private server gameplay videos.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Anyone else here who used to play on BlackDragonflight-US as well?
---
Yes we will have visual things like this that can be turned on or off so that you can see exactly what you want.
---
Iron Edge on Dunemaul, Ravenous on Dunemaul and A Few Good Men also on Dunemaul.
---
That's my concern as well. Sure, I'll get lucky once and fill a group up. But is it worth repeating if I don't get what I'm looking for?
---
I see your point. I also see not being able to easily change spec as a big barrier to wanting to play whole classes though. I'd like to play a priest or paladin, but I'm simply not going to do it because I don't want to spend all of my time raiding as Holy just to have to heal again when I go to BGs or wPvP. In this aspect, I think the dps classes have a current advantage because they can reasonably be viable in both with the same spec, to a degree. If Dual Spec was a thing, maybe they could implement some restrictions on it, like a 24 hour cooldown, no re-spec in combat, raids, BG's, etc.
---
Lol, ok bud.
---
&gt;What are your favourite Vanilla bosses?
---
I never actually got the chance chance to do this one when it was current content, but Razorgore the Untamed.  I don't think there's any bigger fight in the game quite like it.
---
Alright, I'll ask - Who are the streamers?
---
Have fun trying to find a guild to carry you, bud.
---
Tales of the Past was cringy but also so epic
---
Mob HP and dmg too low? I was trying to just do basic quests out in the world to fool around with rogue (feral druid main in WoTLK which I loved) and everything seemed to hard, I can't imagine mobs being even harder (at 13 levels below me).
---
Not really. In the original system there was just "x riding" x being horse,tiger, raptor, whatever. The epic mounts required the same skill as the normal one ~~so just buying the training and waiting for the system change would only net you level 40 riding unless you had an epic mount in your inventory.~~
---
Easier to just let the Blizzard post explain how they did the change over.
---
&gt; Hi everyone,
---
&gt; Because I keep seeing these questions pop-up, and because some of my previous answers have been lost to the forum monsters I'm going to post the info I currently have regarding the mount changes. This is how the mount changes work as I understand it, they may change before 1.12.1 goes live.
---
&gt; After 1.12.1 goes live there will only be one riding skill that will work with all mounts. The skill currently has 2 ranks Apprentice(75) and Journeyman(150).
---
&gt; Apprentice(75) skill will be required for all superior(blue) level 40 mounts, the Rank 11 PVP mounts and the superior(blue) AQ40 mounts.
---
&gt; Journeyman(150) skill will be required for all epic(purple) level 60 mounts, the AV faction reward mounts and the epic dropped mounts (Deathcharger, Raptor etc.).
---
&gt; Warlocks and Paladins who complete their mount quests will be given Apprentice(75) and
---
&gt; Journeyman(150) upon completion of the quests.
---
&gt; All mounts will be bind on pickup and have a level requirement.
---
&gt; Purchasing a non-racial mount will require exalted reputation with that faction.
---
&gt; When the patch goes live the following changes will take place:
---
&gt; Characters who have a mount in their inventory(backpack or bank) will be granted the skill level necessary to use it even if they are not yet the level necessary to use the mount.
---
&gt; Players with the Rank 11 PVP mounts will be granted Journeyman(150) skill.
---
&gt; Players with Riding skill but no mount will be granted Apprentice(75) skill.
---
&gt; Paladins and Warlocks who have already completed their level 40 and level 60 mount quests will be granted Apprentice(75) and Journeyman(150) respectively.
---
&gt; Mounts in the mail or on the auction house at the time 1.12.1 goes live will not grant skill to anyone, so I would suggest making sure you have mounts in your inventory or the bank.
---
&gt; There is currently a bug that is preventing players lower then level 40 who transfer to the PTR with a mount from getting the correct riding skill, we are aware of this and working to resolve it.

---
Kungen was the iconic MT for the best PVE guild from the end of Vanilla and throughout TBC.
---
I'm expecting November 23. It will line up with original release. Anything before that will be a bonus.
---
Yep. When TBC launched I picked a brand new server and only found out once I got to contested zones that my faction only made up like 20% of the server. Ended up making me quit the game for several more months before making another attempt. This is a real fear I have for classic.
---
I think it was earlier than that, for Wrath. Sharding and phasing made the Wrath leveling and open-world experience the loneliest I had ever been in an MMO. LFD ensured that the few people I did meet would mostly not be worthwhile prospects for forging bonds.  
---
Everyone who defends it says raiding (ICC?) was why they loved WotLK, but I never made it that far; the gear and the terrain were both ugly. I wasn't ready for TBC to be over (they dumped a ton of content right before the end). I was bitter that the reset button had been pressed again less than 2 years after the last time, which set a precedent that all efforts at advancement and reputation building were ultimately futile.  
---
WotLK delivered twin blows to the game on release, as the social structures underpinning the experience were bypassed in the name of "QoL", and the manufactured achievements offered by the game developers were revealed as illusory and extremely temporary. Every reason to play the game long-term was completely annihilated. You could be the best of the best at X, Y, or Z, and it wouldn't matter in 3 to 12 months; nobody would know you, remember your accomplishments, or care, and you'd have to master something else to stay relevant... until the next expansion, anyway.  
---
I am firmly of the opinion that WotLK swept the legs out from under WoW, but mostly people were still so emotionally invested that they refused to acknowledge it, and feel more comfortable blaming Cata, instead. The subs arc supports this perspective - it was WotLK, not Cata, where the game's meteoric rise in subs finally ground to a halt and began to taper.  
---
I wonder if the people who champion WotLK would genuinely enjoy going back there, and playing that expansion in perpetuity, as Classic has shown us there is great demand for with the vanilla experience.
---
Meh not really. Lvl 20-25 gear doesnt really make too big a difference. The only 100% NEED item from there  when leveling is for Paladins, a quest item in order to get Verigans fist. You‚Äôll prolly see like groups of 3-4 pallies heading up there as early as possible to do it.
---
Interesting. I can't reproduce this error. Did you mean Hunter? Because there is a Rogue/Hunter Bis weapons post?
---
Up for me. Is it up now?
---
Edited
---
You might want to look into a bottle like camelback. It's to suck every once in a while, so you only drink as much as you need to keep hydrated. If you got the hang of it, you basically do not have go to the toilet for half a day.
---
Why isn‚Äôt there just a subreddit for this at this point that‚Äôs linked to the main sub? Then it would searchable and filterable.
---
Every class can stun in some way if you include stuff like grenades or tidal charm. That stun resist is a blessing.
---
I want it in July.  But if they delay it until school has started, that might actually make it worth the wait.  Will make my initial hardcore week one push a lot easier.
---
I'm rolling alliance almost entirely because of the questlines.
---
Specifically: All the amazing defias brotherhood stuff in Elwynn and Westfall
---
Onyxia Attunement
---
Virtually every quest chain in Duskwood.
---
The quests involving that Forest Troll city in Hinterlands 
---
Oh! And so many great quests in Westtern and Eastern plaguelands involving the Argent Crusade. 
---
The only time questing felt quite as cool as that was The Wrathgate. I actually didn't know about it when I turned in the quest as undead, I just thought it was a cool quest. Then I watched it unfold and it was just absolutely surreal.
---
Protecting Daphne Stilwell? Yea its a bitch for a single lvl 20, non-geared. But with 2 people it becomes trivial. There should be tons of pallies at launch doing this quest lol
---
Great, thanks!
---
LOL, right?  Wtf.
---
nobody said anything about anybody other than a ret paladin.
---
how do you think thats what is being discussed here?
---
Yes, he can learn everything a boar can at max lvl.
---
He can learn them all, but you need to tame a boar that has it, use it til you learn it, then teach it to the first.
---
glad to see i'm not the only one who's planning ahead like this while we wait
---
Maybe their plan has always been to transition all their players to classic at some point? That‚Äôs why the expansions has become worse gameplay wise over the years, to give us that classic need and lust. After a few years wow will end its life cycle, and blizzard don‚Äôt want to lose all those beautiful subscribtions. They will keep us in an endless wheel by pushing tbc &gt; wrath &gt; cata and so forth until we hate it again and want to play classic yet again.
---
I'd like to see it in practice as well. Seems like it wouldn't be sustainable for an entire raid.
---
Ancient petrified leave.
---
Couldn‚Äôt you just kite him indefinitely around the beast room? I seem to remember doing this.
---
Youre still talking?  Your meme spec will stay a meme spec, get over it.

It's gonna be july 16th foo!
---
There‚Äôs a guy down by the river in the Eastern Plaguelands that wants you to kill some crap. May not seem fun at first but highly recommend you check it out.
---
Fuucking Epic dude

Drillborer Disk from Garr too, hopefully lol

The looong defias quest chain that goes into Deadmines and then the Van Cleef letter until the streets of Stormwind.

---
Your pet will level with you and once he gets to a high enough level you can teach him new skills. Any pet in a class can learn all the skills for that class.
---
You will occasionally need to stable your pet and go temporarily tame another one that has the higher rank of a given skill. Then you can teach it to your main pet. That's how you learn new ranks.
---
I had one of those!
---
I'm running out of things to prepare for! lol. Need that release date!
---
NO! 
---
I sold my computer a few years back, in order to quit gaming and get my shit together.
---
Well I've gotten my shit together and am slowly building a computer again. I've gotten 3 parts so far and can get another two this week. Just need about a month longer to build and then I'll be ready.
---
The original question was "What does a ret paladin bring that holy don't?"
---
Seeing as you don't seem to know that feral druids have the highest single TPS possible, which would allow your guild to do certain bosses, and farm bosses too, the fastest and most efficient way possible -
---
I don't think I will have problems finding anything. Good try though!
---
Faction transfers and better horde racials sadly means a shift towards one faction over time. Look at warcraft guild rankings and almost all of them are horde now. At first a couple people change for better racials then suddenly there's a way bigger talent pool on the horde so guilds xfer just to be horde and be able to recruit. This cycle repeats many times and boom it's 2019 and almost every successful guild is horde.
---
Fair enough .  but the money made for th3 cunning player was unbelievable on p99
---
Put my shifts on my mouse.
---
and my answer remains unchanged. 
---
ret paladins show up for raids.
---
Are you a spider? 
---
That sounds like painful shifting.
---
Yup, RW is off by quite a lot. 
---
I was only on there long enough to confirm mobs are off. Though to be fair I was doing mobs in dungeons, it's possible open world mobs are scaled normally? I was trying to test certain builds, and found the numbers to be way off when as A druid I could solo half of BRD...
---
Yes once it gets higher lvl it can learn any skill that a boar can learn. 
---
You just need to stable it, and then tame a high level pet that has the skill you are looking for, once you use that pet a little bit you learn to teach your old boar how to use that ability.
---
Let it reeeeee
---
Yeah I guess I was assuming that fact would be a given.  For sure though people should plan rolls for BiS gear prior to beginning the run.
---
Skinning is easiet to make money IMO.
---
I absolutely cannot imagine trying to do Westfall quests with the zerg going on. Every single quest is basically "go gather 10 of these items, with an 8% drop chance, from the 15 spawns across the zone". Not to mention that every Alliance race is funneled to that same zone more or less. I've tried it on a private server and it takes forever to kill the 20 harvest watchers when there are 6-7 people camping each field.
---
This needs an answer!
---
That's the one! I think so too with the launch having a ton of pallies. So much that I bet you'd see 5man pally sfk runs lol. If she dies though.... She's got like 10min respawn timer
---
Broken for me too on mobile. Every talent just shows the corruption icon and no tooltip.
---
Trapper Keepers rule!
---
If you're willing to found an MC pug why not just start your own guild and name yourself MT?
---
nah im down to play whatever tbh. im fine with respeccing and to play shadow. whatever is more fun
---
First of all its not gonna take more than a few sec. But using mail addon should push these few sec down to 1 push of a button. I use this very early on. Mostly for getting money up. Each time i finish a quest before lvl 10 u die on purpose. Depending on which start zone you are in. You also get a few 6 slots usually by the time u finish lvl 10. Things u dont vendor are the things u send. So its not much at start. It also depends if u are trying to lvl fast or just chilling. I do tend to stay ahead of the curve while lvling so this way sooths me. There is many way of getting stuff stuffed. I do it this way and i do my bank alts with proffessions sending mats from my main and alts. I always have a good amount of gold and still stay ahead of curve while leveling.
---
How many seconds?
---
Does anybody know if mana continues to regenerate if you keep precasting and cacelling a healing spell such as chain heal? Or does mana stop regenrating as soon as you start casting?
---
Those streamers will level so much faster than me that it's not a factor. It's the endgame stuff that will be extremely annoying, like imagine trying to farm consumables in the same zone as a streamer and their army of fanboys taking all the nodes.
---
Yes. YES!
---
I love it!
---
Lol. Ret is not 1 button, and moonkin (which is) does substantially better dps.
---
I think the main issue is that inbetween Blue posts, there's really nothing much to talk about here until we get Classic.
---
I would hope that there's stricter moderation on memes when Classic is actually out.
---
You can always try EverQuest where you sat on the ground for 10 minutes to get all your mana back.
---
Park your toon there and check every few hours, whatever is specific to that spawn. Middle of the night is the best try, you do have to sacrifice some sleep a few times but it gets the job done often, better than competing in daylight when there are people all over the place.
---
I just never went there. I go to desolace and grind mobs instead.
---
&gt;immensely popular
---
if only it had been more popular. I know so many people who have no idea TotP  existed, but they'll tell me their favorite nixxiom or oxhorn video. Or Craft of War. :(
---
Haha I fucking love this! I've got a tone of notebook pages saved on my desktop ready to go!
---
On the one hand, I'll also be playing a Thunder Chicken.
---
On the other hand, THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE!
---
*Let's do this.*
---
Cross realm BGs for every group except lvl 60.
---
I want twink bgs to happen often, not just 1x a week
---
Could be that I'm on mobile?  Not seeing it.  Tools looks like a talent calculator full of corruptions.
---

---
Secondary question: What day of the week would you prefer?
---
I'd say Friday - That way I could take one day off and if there are server troubles in the first few days at least I'm off of work mainly for the weekend. If it's on a Tuesday, I'd be nervous that I'd have to take off Tues-Friday and potentially not be able to play much the first few days due to the servers, therefore wasting my precious few PTOs.
---
*AND MY AXE!*
---
I assume you can just run a packet sniffer then traceroute to whatever address your game data is being sent to.
---
Im not saying they cant be useful. But warriors are the real tank of vanilla. Warlocks offtank a raid fight and with good pet control can even tank dungeons. Shaman can tank up to Temple of Atal Hakkar. paladins can even tank if the group is mindful of him not having a taunt, and the tank himself is mindful of silence and mana drains.
---
If you want to be beaten on by the boss, leading the raid group, charging in first at the pull--its a warrior. 2/3 of your 3 tanks were warriors. And the MT was "obviously" a warrior. In good pserver guilds their tanks are now just dual wielding warriors out to get all the threat in the world. 
---
I even agree you'd want a feral druid, melting that gear does very little for the raid as a whole. Only needing to gear 2 warriors and a druid is quicker than needing to gear 3 warriors (in most rng circumstances). Same with why we bring potentially more than 2 hunters, its easier to gear your 3rd hunter for dps than it is your 8th fury warrior. 
---
If you want to tank 5 mans and UBRS and be the Xth tank on Garr or the 3rd tank on broodlord--go for it. If you want to fulfill any OT role AND the MT role, your only option is warrior.
---
That's what annoys me the most in the whole game  weapons that shrink. It makes 0 sense. Leave them a size and keep it! Not really sure why it bugs me so much.
---
And why is that?
---
F for bear, shift 3 for cat (3 for stealth), mouse4 for travel
---
I loved the battle of darrowshire quest line in Eastern Plaguelands.
---
This is extremely close to what I‚Äôm thinking of, but I don‚Äôt think it was this exact post. Thank you though, this is more than I was able to find and this is really helpful :)
---
Please ignore a lot of the other comments you're seeing here as they're incorrect. 
---
You'll have to tame higher level boars to improve the ranks of his skills. Furthermore a boar can learn one or two other skills that boars do not normally come with once you tame them (can't provide this exact information right now as I am at work). You can then get rid of the pet and teach the skills you've learned from your newly tamed pet to your boar. 
---
Pets have specific abilities they can learn. Theres some handy resources you can look up as to their modifiers and the skills then can learn such as: http://vanillawowhunter.com/vanilla-wow-hunter-pets/
---
I hope this helps! Happy hunting.
---
A warrior can tank with fury so it's not like a feral druid is the key to those good parses.
---
Still downvoted though. Fuck em.
---
Sort of.  Until he conflags you.  Best to keep range
---
Based on what data? Care to show me the numbers that you've pulled out of your ass?
---
And even if it were true, you can always find other classes/specs that are just as reliable while doing much more DPS than ret.
---
My 1st one was Regnat Populus on Earthen Ring on the US servers. Great guild and brilliant team-mates.
---
It's true after all that vanilla has been theorycrafted to death
---
Esfand and Staysafe in separate alliance guilds. Tips running a horde guild on same server.
---
afaik, if youre SM/Ruin with 16 debuff slots you absolutely want to be casting corruption. Whether your guild gives you the debuff slot is another question. But I dont think it was until BC where youd have so much Shadowbolt scaling that you cut everything else out of your rotation.
---
A free 20 page or so sample available online. Decide for yourself.

&gt; Mages will wrek rogues 1v1 if only using class abilities.
---
What delusion do you have that think gangers do honest 1 vs 1, it will be you, the mob you fight and atlest 2 enemy players....
---
Was more effort than my paladin.
---
1. /Follow a fellow healer
---
2. Turn on autohotkey healbot repeat macro
---
3. Profit.
---
You're stupid for not knowing the correct usage of 'your'.
---
&gt; Care to show me the numbers that you've pulled out of your ass?
---
care to deflate your ego?
---
But that's the problem- even with 10 hours of the extra time they still dont shine, they sort of faintly glow
---
I joined Scott Johnsons Guild Ecta Ala Est or w/e its name is on Earthen Ring as a Rogue named Slicer for a little while and lead a Raid Team. We did pretty good, though I don't remember which expansion.
---
I like to correct Pepe with wrong facts too. Hey guys did you know there is flying mounts in vanilla! /s
---
I use the thumb button on my mouse to go travel form.  CTRL+thumb button for cat.  Shift+thumb button for bear.  you can macro that and just use one slot for all that too.
---
You need to work on the mobile layout. Especially on the Atlas.
---
Thank you for this. The updates have been amazing, keep up the awesome work. This website has so much potential!
---
Haha thank you but all credit should go to Defcamp and Melderon TV. They put out some great Classic content!
---
Fallen Hero of the Horde. The most epic non raid quest in Vanilla. Very long quest, lots and lots of lore, takes you all over, unique rewards. 
---
The quests to summon Gahz'rilla iN ZF and the Avatar of Hakkar in ST. Avatar drops some pretty good gear too, even low chance to drop Epic Cloth Robes, Embrace of the Wind Serpent. 
---
Abercrombie for the Alliance.
---
If this is how you treat people, youll do a great job fucking it up yourself.
---
What would Kungen do tho? I need to know!
---
It‚Äôs crossed my mind but honestly I‚Äôm not sure I can deal with running a guild myself. But I have a friend that‚Äôs wanting to do that so I may co lead a guild and mt. Pugs just seem like an easy way to get in there for experience without the headache of managing a guild and it‚Äôs loot system.
---
Very cool stuff. If I may voice a feature request: Would be cool if you could have a clickable legend on the atlas that enables/disables various overlays on the (zoomed out) map like lvl range, flightpaths, dungeons, etc.
---
september 22nd 23:30 it is then
---
I rolled a Belf pally on launch day of BC on a fresh server.  Had to much RL drama involving ppl on Spinebreaker needed a change of pace.
---
You should decide on what you want.
---
&gt; No, if you make a conscious decision to do less damage than you could, or do be less beneficial than you could, you're being carried.
---
Right then and there you have that conscious decision, because druid tank is simply better concerning TPS. 
---
&gt; it's not like a feral druid is the key to those good parses.
---
Higher TPS = Fastest kill time because it allows your optimal raid to do more damage. So... he is key.
---
I thought I was prepared... with my level plan saved as a single text file on my computer. This is impressive to say the least. Also, I did a head tilt when I saw the skill field guide at the beginning... "hey... that's... 'eyyy!"
---
Kind of. You can basically seduce, them soulfire, immolate/conflag timed by another seduce, and repeat with like soulfire, searing pain+shadowburn and then another seduce if needed.
---
If timed correctly it's 3 separated huge burst windows with next to no time to react (maybe one NS+Heal).
---
You still have death coild after those 3 seduces. It was a very fun gameplay. Here's a video of me doing something like that: https://youtu.be/XFqXph5wEzc
---
It's been over a decade so my memory is rusty, but I'm pretty sure that the counter doesn't start until you finish the spell cast.
---
At this point the subreddit could convert to a wiki
---
I had a few. On Azgalor Alliance
---
1) PIAS - Poop in a Shoe
---
2) UG - UnholyGround
---
3) Swords and Boards
---
4) Brethren
---
5) Cant remember the first one I made haha
---
Well, I really dislike sharding way worse than I dislike naming in the game, so I'd take the merges anytime.
---
I stfg
---
want to know how somebody is going to play on a PvP server? they will comment "OH.MY.GOD. STVIETNAM SHAPED MY LIFE AND ASSHOLE IN MY YOUTH"
---
look at literally every thread on this subreddit in the past few days, topic doesn't even matter.
---
Cool and when that feral needs to dps they're gonna suck ass compared to the warrior who goes from prot to fury. Actually the warrior doesn't even need to respec to tank. I don't know why you're latching onto this so hard man.
---
Ahh got it. That was a talent calc placeholder. Probably a mobile issue. Will talk to Ayle about it!
---
&gt;and good luck finding a shield with int on it
---
There are plenty of them.  At a minimum, every paladin or shaman can get Sacred Protector from an EPL questline. there are caster shield drops from Mara, LBRS, DM and Scholomance, and every raid instance except AQ20 and Ony drops a caster shield as well.
---
You just contradicted your original statement.
---
Yeah, it's about a third of my damage in every fight.  In the last 100 duels I don't think I've casted Wrath once.  There are opportunities but there's just more important stuff to do.  I can also say that I've never casted Starfire in my life in a serious 1v1, maybe counterspell bait.
---
Mana continues to regen until you finish a cast that takes mana. So starting to cast and then canceling is fine. You can also cast a heal with inner focus which puts the mana cost of your next spell to 0 and still keep regening.
---
Hey! Would love to chat. PM sent.
---
Yep, raided pretty seriously as a mage in vanilla. Got to twin emps in AQ and a few boss kills in Naxx.  Was sad that my days spent as fire were so few...Still have vivid memories of being the mage with the rolling ignite, seeing the massive numbers then getting one shot by the boss.  
---
Honestly I don't really want to raid MC/BWL, I spent way too much time in those raids.  Was thinking about hitting pvp pretty hard until AQ comes out then finish off the bosses I didn't get to kill back in vanilla.
---
Orc for sure
---
Cool but why not just get a second monitor or have your phone with all these documents for an easy ctrl-f?
---
I‚Äôm not judging, but want to ask. Running your char by the book with everything prepared - will you still have the excitement you expect? Or you‚Äôve already finished the game multiple times while preparing all docs/guides, and doing it on live servers will be just an echo of it?
---
My year would be ruined. I get bonus days off if I take my vacation in june/july so I NEED this soon.
---
Do you care a lot about how your character looks?  Mages sometimes look outright clownish until they start getting their T3 gear - which the majority of players never do.
---
I have leveled 1-60 on many p-servers and very rarely is it more than 1v1 except on overpopulated servers
---
I think it's worth pointing out the ratio of minmaxers to more casual/less hardcore types is naturally going to be somewhat skewed on a forum like this, especially when we're still 2+ months out from launch.
---
For my part, I absolutely intend to roll a Boomkin come Classic. Which isn't to say I'm going to be a dick about it; I'll maintain a healing set alongside my damage gear. I know how to be a team player and it is fundamentally a social game.
---
That said, anyone who seriously has a problem with me even speccing into Thunder Chicken to the point of giving me grief about it in-game is only too welcome to form a line, bend over and *bite my furry, feathered ass.*
---
haha yes gd reformat of my meme dude üòÇüëåüèªüòÇüëåüèªüòÇüëåüèªüòÇüëåüèª
---
If your choice is between a warlock and an enhance shaman, then yeah, go Warlock without even thinking
---
Hope you don't want to raid on classic with those choices :(
---
Because there are no fights where you need more tanks AND also less healers, it was a joint statement. Any fight where you need more tanks you need more healers to keep those tanks up. It's best to have 2-3 prot warriors and 1-2 full feral druids.
---
&lt;Suramar Survivors&gt; you can guess which server we were on.
---
&lt;Who Is John Galt?&gt; was another massive guild on the server.
---
Can‚Äôt wait to jump back in!!
---
That's the plan! We want it to be very interactive with lots of different details to show.
---
Haha nice!
---
I didn‚Äôt know Amy Santiago played WoW....
---
well if you change your liquid intake just as classic releases this will hold true, but if you usually drink a lot your body will adapt
---
Come on when people say "summer" they aren't speaking in terms of calendar summer. We all know that "summer" to most people is like june through august. Some might say it goes into september but that's when autumn starts in a lot of places. Again, using the leaves changing color as the seasonal marker and not actual months on the calendar.
---
Lol, another Mage to help keep up ignite is far better than a boomie. For all you guys talking about how viable boomkins are and how the math checks out, where's the logs proving it?
---
Find some logs of competitive boomies and people will take you 10x more seriously.
---
Just curious, why does this guild require that you do engineering? Is a PVP guild?
---
Enjoy your ded game then. Let's see how nochange works after everyone has farmed naxx.
---
Well, yeah. But parking a character there means you cant play it, so it doesnt really work on release night.
---
Yes, Rogue is the only melee one you won't ever be asked to respec to tank or heal.
---
The funniest thing in this thread, is that Oomkins are basically the second best hybrid dps spec after feral, but people try and pretend shadow priests, enhancement and even ret are better. Somehow.
---
That's my dream for classic right there.
---
if that is your face doesn't that mean you've decided on orc?
---
Me and a few friends hosted a guild called ‚ÄúBig Nick Diggers‚Äù we had like 300 members in like 3 days lol needless to say we all got a 3 day ban including all members haha I do a lot of stupid meme stuff
---
i hope its late summer
---
This isn't about if your guild can do it.  You can do MC with 40 sub optimal people.  It is about dragging down your guild in the future if they take the raids even semi serious.  This is not a problem for a friends and family guild.  This only becomes a problem if you are in a guild that expects to clear each raid tier within the month or two months of it being out.
---
Maybe with your bladder
---
&gt; That's wrong. Moonkin dps (starfire spam) scales better than frost mage dps, and substantially better than shadow priest dps, since spriest gets next to no value from crit.
---
But you have to use lower-rank Starfires to avoid going oom. That's the Achilles Heel of the spec.
---
You're pretty wrong, it's the second best after Feral.
---
me not that kind of orc
---
Honestly, if you‚Äôre looking for gold income and/or guild supplementation, go for two gathering professions on your alt. Herbalism/Mining is an excellent staple choice, and you don‚Äôt *need* to be 60, but it makes farming routes much easier.
---
If you‚Äôre looking for a lower-level alt, then disenchanting/tailoring is excellent, because (I believe, could be incorrect) all gear can be disenchanted by a level 1 enchanter. You‚Äôll probably have a ton of leftover cloth which you can then turn into items to disenchant for mats to AH or use.

Go big or go gnome
---
Did we reddit-hug it to death?
---
No they aren't. They are reformatting data. It's not like they have to code everything from scratch.
---
Started in a small "Knight Templars" themed guild. None of us had MMO experience let alone beta experience, the guild was made up almost only of very casual players.
---
I left soon after reaching 60 because there was no raiding potential. When I re-joined in late 2005, the guild was still around somehow but still no raiding.
---
We made a couple of alliances and started raiding at. Remarkably enough, we ended up absorbing our allied guilds into our own and started experiencing success in raiding over time. 
---
By the end of vanilla we were seen as a decent raiding guild on our server with respectable BWL progression.
---
I still have no clue how the guild made it past 2005 and turned its luck around.
---
True, but it's not aimed at release.
---
Love to see evidence of this - I‚Äôve noticed something frustrating when communicating with classmates that they have trouble thinking outside of paradigms
---
My dead game that hasnt launched and will be around a minimum of 2 years?
---
Sounds good!  Have a nice day, friendo.
---
We prefer the term "owlbear."
---
something need doing?
---
Yup probably going to roll a 29 twink this time around. Did many 19 twinks back im the day.
---
Thinking of either rogue or warrior. Hunter is just to OP to even be fun imo.
---
Yeah you can AOE grind if you want, can even use the same gear (t2, t2.5).  You just need a good shield with a shield spike, and the only thing you're missing is holy shield which is actually not a huge part of AOE grinding.  It's much more helpful for tanking when you have fewer targets, but if you have 10 mobs wailing on you holy shield is not the greatest use of mana to cause damage.
---
If you want to AOE grind a bit, you just need Bosanc, consecrate, and a shield spike.  Then it's all about gear check!
---
For a second I wondered how you were ony attuned at 58 then I remembered you were Alliance.... It hurts.
---
Orc is bae. Stun resist too OP in pvp
---
That‚Äôs exactly what I mean! Been a long time. 
---
That bracket, with ravaged, was my personal fav.
---
https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/
---
Thats the site for Blizzard Entertainment, the game development company behind WoW, Overwatch, Diablo 3 etc. Not Activision Blizzard. 
---
Activision Blizzard is the parent company that owns Blizzard and Activision.
---
If you want to use proper terminology, talk about Blizzard when it comes to their games and Activision Blizzard when it comes to board meetings, marketing strategy, Publishing etc.
---
And yes, we all know but you people keep a blind eye for it. They have said Activision and Blizzard work as indiependent companies.
---
But there are alot of dps classes. In return for specing holy or prot you get faster dungeon groups, easier placement into raids and often priority for loot. I played Prot warrior from vanilla through wotlk and I never felt I was having half my class locked away. In BC I played arena and would respec for the weekend when we PVPed. I paid my pound of flesh and then went back when it was raid night. In most BGs I played as prot and enjoyed myself just fine. I always had pretty top of the line gear and was a great flag carrier. I think it's the outlook you have. I have chosen to tank to save my friend the pain of death and undoubtedly because I'm a control freak and tank gives me the most control in this game. 
---
I think it should be something someone understands going in what they must surrender to play a class. To play prot I give up my dps and some of my pvp prowess but playing a straight dps class you can not attain my position of tank most of the time. That is a trade I will gladly make over the duel spec silliness.
---
Fuckin dedication. 
---
I was thinking about making the same thing on google docs for my mage
---
There are a few boss encounters that are trivialized by having 40 people use the engineering bombs/dynamite at the same time, essentially to nuke adds.
---
Requiring engr on every raider is a bit overkill imo because if a guild is hardcore then they‚Äôll probably be okay without 40 people throwing bombs but that‚Äôs just my opinion. It‚Äôs still a great profession so at least requiring it won‚Äôt hurt anyone too bad.
---
Thats a sweet idea man. Im making that for my Druid tomorrow
---
You seem very confident, I'm sure you have logs to back it up? Go ahead, find me a boomie that beat frost mages in mc or bwl. 
---
Oh wait they don't exist because u are full of it.
---
Yes, it is definitely a reference, as Sm√©agol and D√©agol initially found the One Ring while fishing in the **Anduin** river (yeah, same name than Stormwind's heir, coincidence ?). 
---
I mean it's not surprising that the lore writers are big Fantasy enthusiasts using litterature as an inspiration source (Black Lotus and the hidden crypt in Baddlands are inspired from Conan the Barabarian, the Old Gods are Lovecraftian, etc ).
---
Man I wish I could remember my guilds name. I honestly just found out about this vanilla wow remaster 2 days ago having not paid any attention to the game since lich King. I was a hardcore raider and pvper on gorgonnash (I think that's how you spell it) server (alliance) and can't wait for this to come out again. I am oozing with nostalgia looking through this Reddit page üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
The order of toons  may simply be part of the new client. I'd hope for that but it doesn't much matter.
---
Yeah but lets be real, having one or maybe two ret paladins in a 40 man raid, isn't going to make or break it. Maybe if you're in a world first guild in Naxx, sure but an average progressive guild? Give me a break.
---
Relevant user name &gt;.&gt;
---
Made the mistake of playing an Orc warr on a pserver a few years ago and not sure I can do it all again
---
It's better for progression, since trinkets like arcanite dragonling and battle chicken can generate really significant DPS for key stages when you're popping 40 of them at once. Basically a crutch to clear fights that you are slightly undergeared for.
---
For some reason Cata and "back in the day" still don't compute for me. I feel so old.
---
Not everyone plays the way you do.
---
"like why?" Could have literally almost any answer. In an environment where everyone is beyond the metric for success, and you're capable of winning, you are able to afford the flexibility and freedom for "fun" without negative consequence. 
---
If you have someone who wants to hyper optimize and play that way, that's fine.
---
If you don't, that's also fine.
---
Your inability to accept how others choose to play the game does not define the method in which others need to play.
---
First: I was a priest in the low-mid 50s questing in Andorhal. Caught a flash of purple, looked in my bags, and there was a Glowing Brightwood Staff. It‚Äôs not even that good and I‚Äôd have been better off selling it but I equipped it straight away. I was so proud of it. 
---
Second: I collected the full tier 0.5 set on my rogue. It was a real struggle. When I completed it, I just sat on top of the bank in Orgrimmar for an hour.
---
Lol yeah. While it might not be fair, nice, or accurate, I remember that PVE servers were often called ‚Äúcarebear servers‚Äù and had a reputation for being the place for ‚Äúcasuals‚Äù and kids to go. I personally started on a PVE not k owing the difference, but eventually switched once I learned how fun world pvp was.
---
&gt; Cool and when that feral needs to dps they're gonna suck ass compared to the warrior who goes from prot to fury. 
---
During the raid? Awesome!
---
&gt; Actually the warrior doesn't even need to respec to tank.
---
So, what is his role? Tank/Offtank, or primarily DPS? Because the feral tank replaces the fury guy being tank as primary role, because thats where feral is superior at it. I hope we don't need to discuss how fury is clearly superior at dps so this should be a no-brainer from the start, lol.
---
&gt; I don't know why you're latching onto this so hard man.
---
Because you have a narrow view of carrying and I'm pulling that shitty view right back at you. It's just not "as dramatic" because the difference is smaller; But still there. Taladril has done enough theorycrafting at this point so I don't even need to argue any of this.
---
Good post, I am on team A Classic Summer. They‚Äôd stop using that exact phrase if release was looking like early fall, but they haven‚Äôt. And it‚Äôs when kids, students, adults (in fields like education) will have the most time to pour into WoW.
---
I would start a character and get them to level 5 so they can learn enchanting.. then just park them next to the AH and make this your bank alt.  you can DE any level item at level 5 with rank 1 enchanting (though it will level up to 60 from DE alone).   you don't need to try and make money with them or really level it up.
---
For the alt, it depends on your gold making methods too.  But if you are going to essentially park them at 35 you wont really be doing much gold runs (unless you got a rogue to 40 and did SM pickpocket runs but even then you could probably make more on your main for the time).
---
But I would say tailoring / alchemy.  You can make some of the potions you need and get any of the recipes and mail it to your alts to learn as well as herbs.    But mainly you can sell the transmutes from alchemy and the mooncloth transmutes from tailoring (as well as bags).   Mooncloth goes a long way in vanilla and it can be used for large mooncloth bags, for epic cloth gear, as well as when ZG comes out the bloodvine set will require mooncltoh to make which is bis for a lot of people so some may stockpile the cloth ahead of ZG and the transmute.
---
Yes. That's another thing that concerns me about sharding. What if the populations remain high for longer than anticipated and we get stuck with it?
---
Go look up Esfand, he pulls good numbers for ret. Drakova is another Ret Paladin.
---
https://youtu.be/dSSlL4maa6c?t=1
---
I figured that would be the response. When do Enhance shamans become useful? BC?
---
Well, I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre in that situation but we will be happy to take ya up here in NA.
---
You seem like a reasonable man. My experience with BR players is largely negative, or n a few ways. From unsubstantiated ego, negative to fox attitude or just plain terrible at the game. Can you help me out here and explain the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù or maybe tell me my experiences were happenstance and not the bigger population?
---
At max level in classic, dps warriors have to dip into leather and chain. While leveling though it‚Äôs a major dick move for a warrior to roll against hunters or rogues for leather or chain when they‚Äôre also going to take any plate that drops
---
That's retarded but I admire your spirit.
---
You sure they are corrupted? Isn't tga a pretty old format? Maybe some image viewer from that era can open them properly.
---
I know I'm gonna be tempted to pick up a list of BiS &amp; some guides, but I may just go in blind. Try every dungeon &amp; get upgrades when they come!
---
For me, once you get a mount something just kicks in in my brain that says GET TO 60!!! And I can't stop. Going all the way to 49 and stopping seems like a waste when I can just twink at 19 or 29. Just my opinion though lol
---
I can say i agree with you on pretty much all of those points. The only REAL thing that i have fond memories of in WOTLK is Ulduar. That was an incredible Raid.
---
Linken's questline in Un'goro Crater. A great questline that takes you to multiple zones, and full of Zelda references. Some pretty cool mechanics too.
---
[Headmaster's Charge] with a fiery weapon enchant. Enchant didn't benefit a mage in any way, but looked sexy af. I was too poor/lacked the knowledge for a proper weapon enchant.
---
Also full Magister's set - I was a bald gnome. So majestic!
---
No screenshots unfortunately :(
---
They haven't specified about the time period or which zones would be affected, actually. People just love to speculate and think they know.
---
I'm guessing this is a reference to Diablo 2.  That is exactly what happened in that game with a ring called Stone of Jordan.
---
A lot of class questions but I got a question about  how to make money, how can I make really good money besides Dire Maul farm runs? I like making money if anybody is willing to give me some good methods.
---
Finally, an alternative to this moderation-censored subreddit with ban lottery
---
what re the random letters and numbers after the names?
---
No, but I do play guitar :P
---
I love shitposts, what else is there to say about Classic? There are hardly ever any low effort memes when we have a recent Blue post to discuss.
---
Awesome project. I hope it gets popular enough by release.
---
This was literally my classic experience. I played before 1.12 and mage was do squishy. Each class got balanced each patch and I recall Mage was one of the last classes to be addressed. Bad times. I ended up making a priest instead.
---
I think the ultimate thing you could do is play WC3 campaign (or watch the YouTube videos where it's all the cinematics) and read some of the earlier books.
---
Chronicles is a great read but SO much info has been retconned over the years that a lot of it wont apply to what Classic was intended to be (set years after WC3 with lore as it existed then).
---
I got the Flurry axe on my troll warrior in ZF. I won it and immediately used it till 60+ for tanking. 
---
My group was pissed.
---
I was like 12.
---
Why would Europe and Oceania be in the same thread?
---
The HP on Tauren is kind of meh, but the AoE stun is actually really useful in PVP as well.
---
Will you toast my oats daily please?
---
There was a few over the years.
---
Onslaught
---
Chronology
---
Were the 2 main ones.
---
I recall one of the first quests in Westfall, "Ol' Blanchy" or something to that effect awarding you a 4-slot. I also recall one from a goblin in Ratchet awarding a "Money Pouch" which was also a 4-slotter.
---
Neither of these are starting zones. They're both about level 12-15 quest rewards and to be honest, you should have been buying 6-slotters by the time you've gotten that far, anyway.
---
Can I have a warlock specific question?
---
Which is more optimal for leveling: 1. Dotting up a mob and wanding it to death or 2. Using drain soul to finish the mob to trigger the 2/2 affli talent which increases mana regeneration?
---
Some guides opt for using drain soul finisher but Ive also heard counter arguments (5 second rule prevailing)
---
You can't search for ore and herbs simultaneously. So in most cases it won't be worth it. I like to level a alt to 5 and give him Tailoring and Leatherworking. Then the main gets Skinning and Enchanting to disenchant all the leveling gear you won't be needing any more. 
---
Leatherworking and Tailoring gives you either vendorable items to sell or to to level enchanting also "free" bags and low level wands for all the alts.
---
Long term, Hunter with Herbalism/Alchemy to farm pots
---
I don't even know! ):
---
I do remember the Jumungie Clan on Suramar. First twink guild I've heard of back then.
---
Yup! Qeynos bars guild.
---
The first quest is a full clear of LBRS, which took me weeks to finish in vanilla because horde fucking never steps foot in there again once they finish it unless they're trying for the seal of ascension. 
---
Finding rexxar is annoying as fuck because he paths through ALL of desolace and some of ferelas/stonetalon. 
---
I also love how the first ubrs run is completed in the first room or two but you still have to do the whole dungeon then GO BACK SEVERAL TIMES. It's so annoying and kind of immersion breaking. If you kill the dragons for their eyes then kill drak in the same run, then logically drak is already dead by the time you receive the quest to kill him. Continuity breaks in this questline and it always bugged me. 
---
Then you get the kill quests for the world dragons that are all over the damn place and when you turn them in you get the 4th kill quest that the quest giver couldn't have just given you earlier for some reason.
---
Honestly the only way the alliance quest could be more annoying is if you tried to do it really early on before people knew to clear the hallway before jailbreak or if someone accepted the quest before you were on that step, forcing you do to brd again.
---
Incoming Horde grief. If Hordies level fast enough and run down there, 2 lvl 20 Horde rogues can ruin the entire Paladin populations leveling lmao
---
Aka the sound of an infant crying
---
Is this a troll? It's a troll right? Please tell me this is a troll.
---
Gotta love some of that cheek-powder :)
---
I keep telling everyone Classic is going to go live at 1:49 AM (mountain time) on the 23rd. It's the perfect launch window, as it gives them a full 26 seconds of wiggle room/plausible deniability.
---
Which isn't to say I won't be right there beside you REEEing all the way home, of course, but "joking" about it is the only way I can open my mouth without screaming at this point.
---
It won't.
---
Having a couple of empty spots won't break anything for any half decent guild either. Plus you don't need to give gear to these empty spots.
---
Why bring sub par dps when there's a ton of rogues and mages out there looking for guilds?
---
&lt;Guild of the Chilled&gt; EU-Shadowsong - Wish I‚Äôd never left
---
If they're using cloud services they could do this fairly easily without breaking the bank for sure. It's actually very cheap to spin up servers for short amounts of time. If they are ready to do this... who knows.
---
12 button mice owners: do you spam abilities so that they activate asap (my current style with keyboard) or do you go the route of just pressing it as it's coming off cooldown? If you spam, does your thumb ever start to hurt or get tired?
---
I'm mostly concerned of potential for my thumb getting tired if I get one of these, or even the potential for some sort of repetitive stress injury ala carpal tunnel.
---
is there going to be BR or spanish servers does someone know?
---
For alliance jailbreak is the only really annoying part. For horde every part is really annoying. HOWEVER at least UBRS is a dungeon that people run all the time so you can find groups without too much issue and there's no real failure state that's possible like in jailbreak.
---
Nov. 23 is well into autumn. Which isn't to say the release couldn't be pushed back, but until we hear otherwise, that's a no-go.
---
*Setember* 23, now...
---
That's not major, but definitely a sneaky tactic that I will do if I can!
---
Angels of death. We thought we were good at PVP. Looking back, we knew nothing, but still had a lot of success. the good ole times.
---
I think that's probably a good recommendation. I'm already planning on a level 5 bank alt with enchanting for sure, but if I decided to go enchanting I'd use my prof alt for disenchanting to get free levels.
---
Yeah I think tailoring is probably flat superior to LW, with mooncloth passive income and a bag crafter. Heavily considering a priest main w/ herb/engi, warlock alt with tailor/alch (eventually getting to 60 for DME farming, and being a level 40 summon/prof alt for a while), and a level 5 enchanting bank alt.
---
I played in a guild called Eos on Hakkar. It didn‚Äôt stand for anything, just a name a group of friends came up with. 
---
As we got pretty big into the PVP scene people wanted to know what it stood for so eventually we just started telling them ‚ÄúEat our shit.‚Äù
---
Was he in a VAN?
---
I tried every viewer I could think of, and have access to: Irfan view, GIMP, Paint, Paint.net, Paint 3d, Photos.
---
I tried online converting tools hoping it would somehow manage to convert them and fix them at the same time, no dice.
---
I don;t have access to Adobe Photoshop, but I suspect it wont open them either.
---
Low effort meme
---
Felheart is the coolest set ever released in WoW.
---
Shadows for everything. But mostly I would like the mini map to be able to show inn keeper and repair and class trainer at the same time instead of only selecting one at a time. I know Wierd but it's a small QOL
---
But you look beef supreme as a Tauren.
---
(I'm still deciding myself...)
---
A gnomish contraption of sorts, yes.
---
My friend was super excited when achievements initially came out because he could earn the ‚ÄúMerrymaker‚Äù title on his main.
---
He has been ‚ÄúMerrymaker Combobreaker‚Äù ever since lol
---
Might do a 39 twink with passive gold income proffs, although I would want engineering too so a bit of a dilemma there
---
Alright man feral is the best spec. I'm too tired to keep arguing with you over something stupid. Enjoy doing like half the dps of someone who puts in less effort than you. Play how you want to play, just not in my groups lol.
---
It is because of two things. 
---
1.	Those new abilities have to fit the classic ability/design mindset and abide by class fantasy. People doubt Blizzard has the competency to do this. 
---
2.	It‚Äôll ruin the meta all these try-hards have spent 14 years post vanilla trying to come up with. You‚Äôre underestimating _why_ a lot of people want #nochanges. They like the broken game because they plan on playing a figured out, completely viable spec.
---
But.. But those are rookie numbers..
---
All i'm saying is look into Esfand and Dakova, they have proven that Ret Dps isn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be. Will it beat a warrior or rogue? No, ofc not. But it's still not as bad as people make it out to be.
---
And besides, Classic is all about community. You bring the people you want to be around, those who have good vibes. If you're not in a world first hardcore guild, then it doesn't matter.
---
So ugly, that's literally the one thing preventing me from playing the class :/
---
Wasn't the supply bag only available during the scourge invasion? I might be wrong, been a long time.
---
I knowww that's what I was thinking, but damn it I love will of the forsaken for breaking fears. Warlocks are gonna be mean in 1.12, especially so without WotF.
---
I've also been playing Undead male warrior and undead female rogue since vanilla, but I don't want to go back to undead female rogue because of the weird offset way they told their weapons which makes draketalon fist look stupid.
---
If I go Orc it'd be a female, but I simply love how Undead males look as Rogues and I've never played one because of the nostalgia for my Undead female.
---
I'm torn :(((((
---
Stun Resist + Blood Fury
---
or 
---
WotF + Looking really cool.
---
Mouse wheel tilt left = Bear,  Tilt right = Cat, Mouse Wheel pushed down = Aquatic, Alt+W = Travel
---
well you can actually DME lasher farm pretty easily as a priest.  Warlocks can do that too and mara farm in phase 1, but priests have no issues with it. 
---
You can consider tailoring on your priest too if you think you can get the truefaith vestments (from low drop rate or buy pattern off AH) since they are BiS until T2 robes in BWL and are BoP.  But they don't require tailoring to wearing. Herbalism is fine too.
---
Warlock would probably be good tailoring / alchemy though.  then the bank alt.  Really you can't go wrong.. once DM comes out you can farm whatever gold you need to buy mats and such off the AH if you really need it.
---
&gt; Alright man feral is the best spec.
---
Not what I was arguing, but I can accept that too.
---
&gt; Play how you want to play, just not in my groups lol.
---
Gladly. 
---
Have a wonderful day!
---
If you have not cast a spell within the last 5 seconds you regenerate mana at a rate of your total spirit. When you're not casting we call this 100% regen.
---
If you cast a spell, your mana regen is penalized down to 15% for Druids and Priests, and 0% for Paladins and Shamans.
---
Casting a spell invokes the 5 second rule. This is why when you need to regenerate mana, you stop casting in order to regenerate mana at full rate.
---
Orc looks freaking awesome with gear. And the axe skills racial is also Nice.
---
Then there‚Äôs the level 43 hunter that preys on all those rogues.
---
I was a level 20\~ mage running through Stormwind. One of my servers top raiding guilds had just downed Nefarian for the first time and they were all celebrating around the gates. I was still very new to the game at the time and young (Like 13-14)  and hadn't seen anything like it in-game before. I stopped and started to just watch as they hooted and hollered around in trade chat and /yell. They noticed me watching and started to chase me all around Stormwind as I too started to spout off nonsense. 
---
After about 25\~30 mins of them chasing me around I get a guild invite and they recruited me as their "Mascot" 
---
I didn't hit 60 until around the end of AQ but once I did hit 60 they were always more than happy to run me through ZG and AQ20 to get me some gear.
---
Thank you "Shadow Tribe" on Garona server. Been many years since then and will always remember my first guild.
---
Later on, towards the beginning of BC they broke up and I believe split up into "A Modest Proposal" would be interesting to see if any of them post on this Reddit.
---
Secons this and also the Chronicle's. Arthas was an amazing story def check it out.
---
Any tips for a future raiding hunter?
---
And remember, that pserver has dynamic respawns so those things were spawning mad fast. Without sharding from 1-20 or so, it‚Äôll be a fucking disaster
---
See? People much smarter than I. 
---
I don‚Äôt know why you said ‚Äújust...‚Äù as if it‚Äôs elementary, because you lost me at ‚Äúpacket sniffer‚Äù
---
This was vanilla wow. It is part of the vanilla experience. Purists unite!

Final Fantasy Tactics. You learn skills from one job, switch jobs and can take skills from the previous job w/ you

Veteran Vanilla raider (MC, Ony, BWL, AQ, Nax) looking for a guild when classic drops. I am not partial to Horde or Alliance as I have played both and raided hardcore on both sides. What I'm looking to lvl will more than likely be Shaman or Mage Horde side or Pally or Mage on alliance side. I am 34 years old and have a family. Pretty much any time to raid after 8pm EST as I am central timezone in NA is a go for me. I mained both Rogue and Priest during my vanilla time and since have played every class but am looking to do something new for vanilla. I am looking for a mature hardcore/semihardcore raiding guild.

I wonder if your teachers would be proud or disappointed knowing you used the skills you acquired in their class to play a video game...
---
&gt; You bring the people you want to be around
---
Exactly
---
I want to be around people that want to play optimaly, so that we can clear these 15 year old raids as quickly as possibly with little to no wipes.
---
And those people can be just as fun to be around as anyone else.
---
Psychadelics, EU-Gilneas, Horde.
---
You finish casting the spell - mana is substrated from your manabar, and stops regenerating for 5 seconds.
---
After 5 seconds, it resumes to regenerate, but the regeneration ticks every 2.5 seconds - so, you won't regenerate anything, until you have waited 7.5 seconds.
---
But, starting to cast doesn't interrupt regeneration - only finishing. So, you wait 5 seconds, then start casting a 3-second-cast ability, so you end up with a total of 8 seconds, and get one tick of regeneration. You can even keep starting and canceling, and it will continue regenerating until you actually finish the cast.
---
On patch 3.0.2, they changed it, so mana would regenerate constantly, instead of every 2.5 seconds.
---
BTW, I'm not certain whether it was 2.5 seconds, 2 seconds, 2.2, or whatever, I just remember there were ticks.
---
I grinded to rank 10 in vanilla. Rank 9-10 was harsh. I spent about 8 hours a day in bgs that final month.
---
My server had 20-30min queue times so I remember queueing up, setting my stop watch to 15min, running outside and jumping on my trampoline while waiting for the BGs to pop. Contrary to popular belief, the vanilla honor system actually made me incredible fit.  
---
This being said, I am sure you could reach rank 10 doing 3-4 hours of bgs a day. Just very slowly. Your ranking prosess will probably last a month or two longer than what is the norm.
---
TLDR: Rank 10 is probably doable doing bgs 3-4 hours a day. It will just take way longer.
---
Warrior or a mage? I can't decide between those classes. I primarily want to dps but I'm also comfortable with tanking. I really wanted to play warrior but I heard it might be hard to get into groups if I'm not overgeared for content, there are also money problems. Mage seems to solve those problems, easy groups, no problem money making. I like mage just aswell, but I think warrior has an upper hand. I will also have my brother playing healer priest so lvling a warrior won't be as hard as it normally is. What do you think I should take?
---
Only way this works is if you adderall a few times but dont stay up longer than 24 hours and dont go crazy with the dosage. The resulting comedown will make it so you dont even want to play the next day. Not worth it unless you really want to farm boars for 24 hours strait
---
Irfanview opens TGA files just fine.  Does it give you an error when you try, or what happens?
---
Holy fuck. What I bragged about in my post doesn‚Äôt even compare to this. Bravo!! üëè
---
I played in vanilla and I've played on unofficial. There is nothing new to me or undiscovered unfortunately. The thrill i get is playing with high parsers for PvE and high rankers for PvP in competition. I am trying rogue this time which i haven't done in vanilla.
---
Great guests on the show. I could happily listen to them crap on for hours. 
---
If you ever get the guy who went to his girlfriends house to get Thunderfury, on the show again, I hope you get him to tell that story.
---
Id love for a midnight release. Sleep in the day off and set the mood
---
Um everyone knows naxx gear is nuts and vanilla pvp is completely dominated by whoever has the best PvE gear. How is that in any way an unpopular opinion?   
---
90% of vanilla pvp videos people link to "prove" X class is good is someone killing players in pve spec/gear just trying to get to a dungeon who are playing on a laptop trackpad with no keybinds.
---
Warrior for you then
---
What makes it so that alli can get attuned before horde?
---
Kinda wish vanilla had mana crack though.
---
well, this is not weird at all
---
Yessir! Thank you for all your hard work, I've been compiling rogue stuff over the past few weeks since i decided on on rogue. Your work is invaluable and great!
---
"Can't read file header!
---
Unknown file format, empty/damaged file or file not found!"
---
Go Hunter.
---
Nah, from what you tell us, just go Warrior. Idk where you picked up "Gold Problems" grab your brother and do DM East Runs - easily solved. Since you dont have problems tanking (which you can easily do in DPS spec with tank gear ob) just tank those instances.
---
Especially running instances as a tank gives you the possibility of forging your group in a way that no one is competition for your potential loot.
---
Duskwood is amazing and this is coming from a hordie. Probably my favorite zone in the game.
---
In dreams is really cool. Tons of xp and pre raid bis gear.
---
It really depends on your playstyle and mindset. I'm going mage because I actually enjoy tedious, repetitive grinding and mages can AoE level very quickly. Couple that with Tailor/Enchant and I'll be in riches.
---
I never said they couldn't be, just giving Ret Paladins out there and other meme specs a chance at raiding. They will raid whether people like it or not. 
---
You do you, I'm not telling you how to play specifically.
---
Do both. Main one, alt one. Juggle that rested xp.
---
Play warrior if your brother will be priest. If you two want to run any dungeons while leveling, you will find a group instantly.
---
I see what you're saying, definitely didn't before.  On one hand I guess that wont not work, but I still feel weird about it in some ways.  It'll depend heavily on the specific case, I think.  In places where the difference between tanking and dpsing are small for the warrior, it wouldn't make much sense, but in places where tanking and dpsing functionally end up very different for the encounter, it could work well.  
---
For example, wing buffets used by flamegor/ebonroc/firemaw in BWL require an OT to taunt, eat a wing buffet, then move back into position to rinse repeat on the timer.  This job doesn't look at all like dpsing, so a fury would be rightfully pissed to have to do it.  
---
On the other hand, in AQ40 on the reaver trash mobs (purple bugs with a knockup), there are 7ish mobs that need to be tanked per pack, but the only threatening mechanic is the knockup and they don't hit hard at all.  Here, you assign a fury to tank because 'tanking' here functionally means 'dpsing while walking backwards' and you actually wouldn't want to add another person to the aoe knockup (the druid).
---
Also to note...by first Naxx patch you want your rdruid healing 100% of the time to make use of the t3 2pc bonus.  
---
In general this reminds me of having the priests in your raid smite when there's not enough damage going out, which makes sense to me, but I guess the assumption tied to the smiting priest was that the rdruid stays on healing duty in the current meta.  I would say it's possible that a druid could outdamage the off-duty smiting with off-duty cat shredding, but I haven't seen that just yet.
---
I'm gonna be new to the game, I've been doing quite the research but I just can't decide.
---
I narrowed it down to 2 classes: Priest and Shaman.
---
I like both classes, but since I've never played the game, I have not a single clue how they play, how active they are, skill ceiling and overall how fun they feel to play (I know fun is a subjective matter).
---
So anyone that could give me some pro/cons on the matter? I guess the more active the class is, the better is for me.
---
there is something satisfying about knowing you can plan ahead like this because the game will essentially be locked in time, these guides won't become outdated or have to change
---
Your post is what made me wanna post! haha. I really could feel the sentiment you were talking about. I've just done a bit more. I've made a Grocery list for the couple weeks of launch. Characters, Professions, everything. once i settled on rogue main i started making this.
---
Have a wonderful raid! I know the guys carrying you won't :)
---
&gt; They have support spells/buffs that are near essential in raiding.
---
The problem is, that's not true, otherwise there would be way more moonkins around.
---
Yeah I would like to go tailoring to get the vestments, but then I'd need to drop herb, which means dropping alchemy on my alt since I won't have any good way of getting herbs other than AH. I guess there's nothing wrong with going herb on both, dropping herb on my priest to pick up tailoring once I have enough to get the lock to 300 alch? Then eventually level his tailoring to be a backup mooncloth farm? Or do you think I should leave the alt with herb till it can hit 60?
---
Cool, makes sense. Thanks!
---
Had something similar. They don‚Äôt empty themselves.
---
It's a custom server basically, there's custom lvl 60 quest zones to play solo/groups and there's custom dungeons to do in 5mans and there's BGs.
---
Anything else on the server isn't meant to be done. So whatever lvl 47 thing you were killing is no indication of vanilla wow or rogues.   
---
Try teleporting to the dew collector zone and killing some of them.
---
You were making feral seem way better than it is, but whatever. Good day.
---
Did you lose the title too?
---
Same here! I compiled a laddered gear list to accompany the pre-raid BIS for my druid. It includes rungs for "solo" content (world quests, low effort craftable or rep), then "easier" dungeons like BRD, ST, Mara. I found getting pre-pre-bis can help getting into groups for UBRS or Strat.
---
Skullflame shield. My first ever world drop epic. Sadly it was only around 80-100g at the time, but it was still pretty damn exciting to find.
---
Battlegroups are beneficial for twinking. I hope they're part of the game, but Blizzard haven't said anything.
---
It's for lazy healers who dont come prepared with  even 1-2 consumes. Seriously, it doesn't matter in raids. Focus more on downranking heals and cancel casting.
---
Had a paladin during vanilla, and even in the Jenkins video they were going after cloth shoulders for a pally.
---
Mouswheel up: Travel Form - so you can "spam" it easily while kiting in PvP
---
Mousewheel down: Kitty (feral and for easy power shifting)
---
Q: bear - actually never messed up by switching out of form for tanking
---
Shift + q: aqua form
---
Can you give us on outline of what's in this book to we can create our own flavors of it?
---
&gt;Gf 
---
&gt;Classic
---
Pick one
---
Balance/resto hybrid is pretty good for raids
---
It started in WoD, I bug reported it in: WoD Alpha/Beta/release/every patch, and in Legion Alpha/Beta/release/every patch thereafter, and in BfA Alpha/Beta/release/every patch so far.
---
I don't think they give a fuck.
---
Undead male weapons shrink to like old Blood Elf female weapons size (before they were fixed).
---
Making the usage of any 2handed weapon comical when they're put onto the back and get tiny, then pulled back out and are normal sized. So basically the only weapons that look reasonable are the largest of the large, Ashkandi, Armageddon, Zin'rokh, Cataclysm's Edge, the big fiery cosmetic one from WoD challenge mode golds, etc.
---
Sometimes I like using older, smaller weapon mogs but they become 1handers when sheathed, it sucks ass :(
---
I did it once back in 2006. Took a wrong turn and jumped right into the elites guarding the BWL enterence. Made it though, and got the beaststalker chest piece!
---
They already do this essentially for massive servers. The server would show as ‚Äòfull‚Äô and if you tried to play you had to join a queue. Therefore most people moved on. 
---
As for a limit on faction specific... let‚Äôs say you have a friend that wants to start playing with you. But damn... horde is full. Too bad. 
---
Doesn‚Äôt make sense. What does make sense is giving a horde:alliance ratio view for each server. I would be shocked if someone doesn‚Äôt create a webpage that provides these statistics anyhow. 
---
Either way, blizzard shouldn‚Äôt have to intervene passed what has already been in place from the beginning.
---
blown the fuck out damn lol
---
I'd just encourage you to play one that you haven't yet. A fresh experience will help keep the game feel more exciting and new. If you're more inclined to play pvp than pve, i'd say go for a spriest or a shaman. They're fantastic and not hard to gear like warriors and warlocks (at least trying to run destro).
---
Nah balance/resto hybrid is pretty viable and top tier guilds should consider one.
---
Nope. But i had a mage-friend who was super-salty and bitter :).
---
In PUGs I always ask the group what we are going to do. And we do that. Often times everyone agrees to greed for selling, need to equip. But if people say any BOEs need all then so be it. I think its always worth a quick 2 second clarification with a new group.   
---
But, should you not follow the agreed upon rules and ninja... I will get pursue the issue to the ends of the earth. Or well... atleast to your guild and make sure they kick you.
---
üòì
---
The problem is that you have no way to guarantee that the player who actually "needs" the item is going to use it or is just saying that because they are a class that generally uses it and now they got it without competition and can sell it on the AH at their leisure. Generally, people don't trust other people on the internet, so while I'd happily let that Hunter have his BoE bow since he'd really use it, if everyone in the party is rolling need, I'm gonna roll need too...
---
people aren't pissed that sylvanas is "evil" dude they're pisses that everybody's reaction to her is neutered af
---
I was originally in a small leveling guild: Calm Before The Storm. This guild later merged with Ashes of Avalon in order to get into raiding. This guild eventually collapsed and disbanded due to some sort of drama while I was offline. 
---
It had something to do with one of the officers, who ran our dkp site, editing the dkp of himself and his friends. The Guild Leader was apparently also some sort of weirdo or creeper to some of the members and it all came to a head when the dkp scandal was brought into the open. I was offline for all of this so I can only retell what I heard afterwards. 
---
I was a casual player at this time will never forget logging on and thinking I was just given the boot without warning. It was pretty wild. I had been leveling and chatting with this same group of people for probably the entire first year or so following launch. Shortly after logging in, the whispers started flooding in and people started filling me in. Thankfully, some friends from that guild scooped me up for a fresh one created from that fallout: Stockade Prison Blues. I have been a member ever since!
---
It‚Äôs a casual guild which happens to raid. We managed to get MC, Ony, BWL, AQ20, and ZG on farm before Burning Crusade. We were just stepping into Naxx and AQ40 when the expansion was closing in so we decided to just gear up alts and do fun runs instead of pushing content. They have managed to clear the majority of content since then excluding most of the mythic raids.
---
Yeah, i mean, if thats your opinion then there is not much I can do about that. It just doesnt really seem reasonable to me, considering every negative aspect I am aware of doesnt actually come in to effect here.
---
Any chance you could elaborate on your UI and bindings in a separate post ?
---
Some of it may be due to altered drop rates in the current client. I know some things like the baron mount, and other drops have been modified, mostly post cata.
---
big yikes dude. you don't understand the actual mechanics, nor how to value sp/hit. Hit also diminishes in value the more of it you get. Don't spread misinformation literally pulled from your ass.
---
No matter the day or time, i‚Äòll call sick on that day :)
---
I don't remember rightly. I remember you could use any items you bought that were tied to your rank, but I don't know if you would have still been eligible to buy them if your rank dropped or if you kept the title.
---
When the honor system was changed for tbc I was a knight-lieutenant and I remember when they added the title selector I could originally pick any of the ranks below that for my title, but at some point I'm pretty sure they changed it to only let you pick the title for your highest rank.
---
You have 5 seconds to pick it up and eat it. After that just throw it out.
---
Do you even play vanilla?
---
Thought about selling copies? For other classes too maybe?
---
While I personally wouldn't directly use it, I think it's pretty damn cool. Many would probably have a pretty big use from it, especially those who want to recapture the old school cheatsheet feel from guidebooks.
---
For pug groups: You need because if you Greed, someone else will Need and youll lose the item anyway. Good luck Greeding tho
---
Gotten burned way too many times before.
---
For organized/friend groups: talk about it and figure it out. You should be able to trust these folks.
---
I ask nothing more.  As long as the rules are agreed on, the people who break them can live with the consequences.
---
What would be the point of keeping this data for an 15 year old game that would never come back? Drop rates for previous expansion's content changed. Maybe even multiple times. The old data was worthless.
---
Play smart not hard
---
Yeah think you are right, so that‚Äôs phase 6 üò¢
---
I recall that guild. I was in Sere Vala.
---
It's not that long of a walk when you consider you need to make it eventually anyway to get the flight paths to Arathie and South Shore. 
---
Then it's like a 5 minute walk from south shore and now when you need to hit up hillsbrad to quest at level 30 you can fly there rather than walk.
---
very surprised this hasnt been removed yet
---
Why not both?
---
Literally nobody says that
---
Get your shot timing down. You can eyeball it well enough, but nothing beats a shot timer. You need to weave multi-shot and aimed shot between auto shots. 
---
This applies to all classes, but come to raids prepared. Have your consumables, ammo, etc. This means mana pots and dark runes. An oom hunter is bad. Bring *food for your pet.* One thing hunters commonly forget is an extra bow or an unequip macro for Nefarian's class calls. Having your weapon broken and having to melee the rest of the fight is embarrassing, and you don't want any part of that.
---
Use your pet effectively. Not just in terms of what you bring (wolf vs cat is pretty close in terms of overall raids dps) but in terms of what talents you give it for individual raids, Fire Resist for MC/BWL, Shadow Resist, etc. It improves pet survival and increases your damage.
---
Use feign death effectively. Obviously it's important for managing your threat, but you can also pull off some crazy stuff with it since it takes you out of combat. After Nef lands, you don't need that Onyxia Scale Cloak anymore, feign and swap to your dps cloak. Warlock go down during Twin Emps? Feign into your shadow resist gear (if you have it, this is a pretty specific one I did exactly once, and we wiped anyway) and distracting shot to pick up aggro and allow the raid to potentially recover.
---
Other than those that come to mind, the same stuff that applies to other classes applies to you as well. Watch your threat, be prepared, be a team player, and have fun.
---
Knew this was a hunter meme before I opened it.  Going to treat myself to a cookie.
---
This is honestly the easiest solution. Regardless of server etiquette, just ask the group while you're all flying or lazily waiting for the Warlock to get there. Most of the BoE issues I ran into in Vanilla &amp; retail would have been avoided by the group lead just clarifying before the dungeon.
---
Everyone should roll need in a PUG on BoE items.  If you wanna work something out for an item after go ahead but rolling greed is just asking someone to take it, especially really valuable stuff.
---
There's still no guarantee they even plan on doing a public beta, is there?
---
They may keep it all internal.
---
You can never guarantee a person is being honest vs cheating the system.  A mage might be a dick and take that staff to AH, but on the other hand, if he rolls need and you see that he hasn't equipped it, you can report him for ninjalooting and/or spread the word that he cannot be trusted.  In this scenario, I agree with you.  Everyone else rolled need regardless of class, so go for it.
---
If someone says they need a BOE to use I want to see them equip it.
---
Just state the rules at the start and everyone knows what to do.
---
Pugs - need on BOP if you can use. Greed if you can‚Äôt. Need on all BOE‚Äôs. Pretty simple.
---
If you are inactive for a long period of time, Blizzard will ‚Äúdelete‚Äù character names in order to make them available for new players.
---
Yeah same here. Is the drop rate increased on private servers or something?
---
Why does someone need a weapon upgrade more than I need a mount?  They both serve the function of leveling faster.
---
Thinking about priest, have a few questions about Disc:
---
* is it a viable raid healing spec?
---
* is it better/worse than holy in PvP?
---
Actually pretty true. As a rogue you probably spend the least amount of time being frustrated out in the world
---
We are taking a deep dive in philosophy but yes, a cave man that invents an axe is a more skilled lumberjack than a cave man that doesn't.  And a cave man that is given an axe is not a more skilled lumberjack than a cave man that wasn't given one.  Do you see the difference?
---
The whole point of all of this though is just to critique the people that want a hardcore classic wow experience and then soften the edges of the experience with addons anyway.
---
Meh we used to drag some pretty terrible, braindead folks around in our 40 mans.  A good player playing a bad spec is better than a terrible player on any class.
---
When does this come into play? From what I'm seeing, he instant casts about 2 frames after being MCed.
---
Not me but a friend won a hand of Edward the odd, sold it to a member on nightmares asylum Smolderthorn US for 1k or 900 I think.
---
For the first part, needing because you assume everyone else will do the same still puts you at fault.  At the very least, wait and see if someone rolls on something they don't need before you click need.  
---
As for friends, I agree.  If your friends are trying steal stuff, you blacklist them.
---
Taran Icebreaker on my ret pally.
---
Updating this with a video find. Not from classic, but apparently the plagued private servers had a use for once. Thank you Fused for the find.
---
The start of the Video showcases the exact rotation and that it has no negative impact on the ranged rotation.
---
A couple of things are worth mentioning. You may read them before you watch it or you can dive just in.  
---
The video seems to be a patchwork of multiple raid recordings. Only the beginning covers melee dives.
---
The player is moving way too much around for it. Which let's me assume that he or she has no routine with it yet. The lack of dives during rapid fire also supports this theory as there is usually plenty of time to dip in back and forth (basic ground travel speed without movement modifiers is 7 yards per second and you only need to cover 6 (3 back and forth))  
---
As hilarious as the Thunderfury part is. I'm glad that it is in the video. It shows how bad this playstyle is when you try to utilize it while dual wielding. (In addition I'm assuming that it shows the player experimenting with expertise as he is using maladat as offhand during that fight. Which implies he may even be using edgemasters to counter the dmg loss on glancing hits. Which is pointless. Only 1 of your melee hits with a 2 handed weapon is a white hit and dual wield simply doesn't bring the weapon modifiers to properly support the dive in - burst - leave playstyle
---
I should probably add some numbers for the one handed weapons to show why they are so bad at this.
---
Last but not least I felt like mentioning it. He is complaining about bad RNG on feign death. That is not a FD resist. He didn't call his pet off the target when he tried to FD. If your pet gets hit by an npc or if it hits something by itself it will keep you combat flagged and prevent your FD-Item-Swap attempt.
---
I guess I meant Druids more than moonkin specifically...
---
That, except make the rogues invisible
---
Hi, /u/Potatoburrito123
---
If they just opened the servers without saying anything right at this moment how long do you think it would take for the word to get out? 30 seconds?
---
&gt; Therefore most people moved on. 
---
I mean, isnt this exactly what you're saying.  Two buddies want to play, server is full of Horde but open to Alliance, so they move on to the next sever to find horde availability.
---
And a friend trying to join you in a few months where the server is full period, or full of a certain faction and closed to that faction = just the same thing, too bad.  We already have one, why not the other, and how is that different?
---
Any maybe they could do a "refer a friend" thing to get your buddies on that server with some sort of a wait list, or where you get preference when then server opens up again to accept more from your faction etc.
---
I just dont get why its so hard to balance the servers???  They completely #$&amp;%\^#'ed this up at the beginning of TBC.  Waaaaay too many dead servers.  Hopefully they avoid the same mistakes.
---
Been playing for 15 years, took me about 13 of them to realize the most fair thing to do is for everyone to need the item. 
---
That way everyone has an equal shot at the item, may the best roller win. Now if someone in the group wants the item and they ask nicely I will always be willing to sell it for below market price in the spirit of the game. 
---
Anyone who wants to call me a ninja for losing a fair and square roll off can be my guest. I'm not losing out on anything by not playing with people who think that.
---
I see you've learned the hard way what you get for being a carebear.
---
Sure, the sections are as follows:
---
1. u/seguren 's 1-60 Trainer ranks so you know what you can skip ect.
---
2. Professions guide. (Cooking / LW / Engineering after im 60 and farmed LW) Pre-Raid BiS gear. Enchants, consumables, world buffs, General Tips.
---
3. Joanas Leveling Guide that i have modified to suit Rogue more. Added in training spots, grinding spots that fit LW and farming Cloth, rogue quests, grind spots for lock picking ect.
---
4. Raid BiS list so i can see what is an upgrade and what i can pass on to fellow raiders.
---
5. Going to add a sections for PvP tips and different specs to try for fun and goofing around.
---
Things I've also prepared for is Food/Grocery List for 2 weeks of launch. My characters Names / Classes / Character Designs so I can make them super quick and move on to leveling. Which character will be a bank for me to mail things too so i don't have to deal with them. I made this same handbook for my girlfriend who is playing Priest. We redecorated a spare bedroom into a gaming room. We are full on hype train over here. Hope this helps some others plan their adventures.
---
The push to talk hotkey is a good idea.  Do you think it would be possible to bind it as like a hover hotkey? Like bind it to dispel whoever you third click on?
---
Oh boy, my Nth mage.
---
Unpopular opinion because a lot of people here think they have skill but in fact they just have gear ;-)
---
I created a guild called ‚ÄúHorde Assasins‚Äù. We were Alliance, it didn‚Äôt make much sense. And also I couldn‚Äôt spell.
---
But I think we had fun!
---
Why do you need a mount more than I need a new weapon?  The weapon makes me better at what I do and the money, if used on a mount, makes you better at grinding.  When we all group up for something, its a team effort and your personal desires are sidelined.
---
Awesome ü§ôüèº thank you! Will definitely look you guys up!
---
Thanks for such a well considered reply.
---
The hit isn't really significant, it reduces white damage glancing blows on bosses. On a warrior that's pretty big because that determines your rage gain. It depends on the fight and gear but it's around 6% dps for warriors 3% for rogues. How much that matters is entirely up to the player. It's extremely unlikely it would ever be the difference between a kill and a wipe.
---
Ive made one for priest as well cause my girlfriend will be going one. IDK if i have the patience to try and sell them, also dont know if there would be a demand for them.
---
Using the Logitech Software you can map the key to whatever key or combination you want. You'd then need to create a macro to cast the ability on hover and put it on an action bar slot you're not using for your main modifiers.
---
Then keybind the action bar slot to the key combo you mapped to the third button!
---
Are we going to just IGNORE the fact that he has his enemy frame on the left????
---
In addition to what other people have explained, unless I'm wildly, WILDLY mistaken the actual stat you see listed on items as MP5 is not affected by the 5 second rule nor is BoWisdom.   These tick at a rate of every 2 seconds (despite being displayed as a 5 second stat) regardless of your combat/casting state
---
oh how many soj's was used back then for trading, ring was everywhere
---
You didnt answer the question.  I contend they are at worst equal.  An epic mount will last longer than a staff of Jordan so it really is worth more but I dont want to argue that so lets say they are equal. Then everyone should roll need.

Do you have Notepad++?  If you open one in it does the first 18 bytes look like:
---
[NUL][NUL][STX][NUL][NUL][NUL][NUL][NUL][NUL][NUL][NUL][NUL][NUL][EOT][NUL][ETX][CAN] (and a space) ?
---
If you scroll to the bottom, it should have:
---
TRUEVISION-XFILE.[NUL]
---
So a person in your group actually needed an item, and everyone rolled need so they could make money.  Now, your claim is that it was fair because you sold it to the first person for a profit?
---
This is basically the reason for ‚ÄúX, Y, Z reserved‚Äù when looking for groups on pservers and why it will be common come classic.
---
People talk about server reputation like there‚Äôs some designated bookie keeping tabs on what everyone is doing at every time. The reality is that in almost all cases, people won‚Äôt care, or they‚Äôll care for a day or two then forget about it. 
---
Reserve your items, it‚Äôs not like the norm will be acting like a dick, there will still be a lot of dicks out there.
---
And if they dont?
---
You really think the server community is going to give two shots that some random lvl 36 hunter ninja's some BOE?
---
Serenity Now on Illidan
---
There's an immediate demand from me for the priest one since I plan to main priest.
---
Yeah. I haven't done the Horde questline (haven't done the alli one in like 13 years either) but based on research it seems like Jailbreak is the single most annoying quest between both questlines, but the Horde questline is a bigger pain overall.
---
If you're playing a class that can be an orc, and you didn't roll orc, you dun goofed.
---
You can't report people for that.
---
And noone is going to give a shit that some random low lvl mage ninja's something
---
Yeah, ill level a druid and go bear tank through all the dungeons.
---
Sure. You tell them that, they say ok, then they don't equip it.
---
Now what?
---
Go warrior, we need tanks. Plus not everyone has a healer to help them level so that's a huge advantage.
---
Ya but where‚Äôs the exhaustive Druid guide? I‚Äôm gonna have enough asshole energy to run oomkin I think
---
Rogue is really one of the best for inventory considering you have very high gear overlap with all specs. Any hybrid or tank is a pain to manage gear with and Locks/Hunters lose a whole bag. So mages/rogues really have it the easiest if you like the minimalist lifestyle with lots of bag space!
---
I was thinking the same thing lol
---
Some items from engineering give you more mobility like the gnomish or the goblin rocket boots, the gnomish net-o-matic projector can also root your ennemies for 20 sec, and most bombs can stunt people for a a little bit. Probably the best profession if you want to PvP or be part of a hardcore PvE guild.

It's a program that monitors your network traffic. Tells you what is being sent to where and what kind of data it is. You can open up an entry that gets generated by wow and see where you're sending data to. Then do a thing on your pc called a traceroute, which shows you the path your traffic is taking to get to a particular destination.
---
They aren't equal.  An upgrade in equipment makes you better at whatever you do.  Higher damage, survivability, healing, etc.  Bottom line is that your equipment is part of the bread and butter of whatever you do.  Stealing gear for money so you can buy mounts, gear, mats, etc is stealing from other players plain and simple.
---
Putting mounts aside, the gold from an epic weapon sale can be used to get an equivalent weapon or set of armor off the AH for whoever gets it. This being the case, I'd say everyone need is always the best way to go.

Ok, so you're waiting to see to make sure everyone greeds.

Shouldn't other wait to make sure that you hit greed as well?

Black Lotus could also be a Magic the Gathering reference. Black Lotus was a super rare card in the first release of magic that is one of the rarest and most valuable cards outside of sports cards.
---
Maelstrom. I really can't remember. It was supposed to be our guild from SWG, but when we got into WoW there were a couple of guys running the guild who I didn't know. So we end up in a succession of raiding guilds that I also can't remember the names of lol. 
---
My season 1 two man arena team was called PBR Street Gang. I remember that!
---
Contact their guild. Find out if that is their main or alt. Request they are removed from their guild and try to inform the rest of the guilds that they're a ninja. 
---
All you can do. Some of it is simply trying to be your best and at the end of the day hoping for that from others.
---
As other people have said it is a fair comparison to compare it to WW axe as you keep it till Bone biter since you can get that earlier than others due to being able to heal cath at 35/36, and having that at level 20 makes Duskwood and wetlands trivial
---
My theory is that it will be Bran.
---
Well Shaman is Horde only, so if you want to play Alliance then you have to go Priest.
---
Shaman have totems which can be fun and appealing. Priests are generally the more sought after healers though, although Shaman aren't bad by any means.
---
If you have leveled any other class to 60 besides paladin and warrior then you would know how much slower it is.
---
Till you contact their guild and just ask a rando in it "hey, who is XXXmage's main" and then pursue that.
---
Would you be able to upload one of the files so we could test different methods and see if we can find a solution?
---
what's your keyboard? looks rly nice
---
Meanwhile you could of just saved a bunch of websites and alt tabbed.
---
^This?
---
I want to go alliance lock but I keep worrying about dealing with WotF. Is it really that big of a deal?
---
If you want to Tank, there will *always* be a shortage of tanks so finding a group won't ever be a problem.
---
Sure. Now their guild leader tells you to get lost, or they're guildless, no one else cares about an item getting ninja'd and you're left with a guy that got to sell the BoE without his group getting to roll.
---
That's why people roll need in PuGs.
---
As someone with a 2.5 and 1.5 year old and not a lot of spare time, this would be a HUGE help for my casual play to maximize my time. If you would be willing to share or sell, I'd be interested.
---
Vanilla hasn't existed for 12 years so nobody plays it.
---
As I mentioned, this community has been pitching the importance of community and the risk of being branded a ninja by other players.  You cannot guarantee that it will never happen, but that's life,
---
Neither have you apparently
---
HELLA NAH

That‚Äôs very possible. That‚Äôs one of the reasons why I said beta and not public beta.

---
Probs a 29, I remember having a rivalry between me and my buddy and 2 other 29s on horde side. We would see each other *all the time*
---
My boss: ‚ÄúI only hit 6‚Äù
---
I have never once had a GM tell me to get lost. I have a pretty good success rate getting them kicked. But again, I support asking the group what they want to do and going by that. You can't stop all ninja's but you can do your best to limit them and then you can pursue and harass them to the best of your ability.
---
How bout now
---
That Tartarus looks pretty gimmicky, what's the joystick even for?
---
Yes, why wouldn't it be? That person needed an item. I needed gold. Something dropped that would solve that problem for either of us, so we rolled need. Now I have an item that will get me gold, if he has gold, he can use it to purchase the item he needs. Giving him a discount is just a convenience factor.
---
I actually watched that the other day! This is not the video though, it was mostly WSG pvp in the video and the only song I remember playing was fort minor - remember the name.

I definitely don't want to go pure DPS.

I'd like to have a spec/class that lets me heal/be helpful in dungeons/laid back raids (I will not be a hardcore raider) but that will also let me PvP well.
---
I'm torn between HOTW druid, Shadow Priest, or 30/0/21 shaman. Any thoughts?
---
Keytal‚Äôs videos got me into shadow priests
---
Perhaps it being a private server have something to do with it? :P
---
The right song would be chacaron macaron. Their dance is based on it !
---
Hmmm maybe I can farm money in retail for tokens and play for free
---
Option 1: Contact guilds, write petitions, make realm forum posts complain and hope people listen.    
---
Option 2: Fairly roll on the item, winner can give to someone if they want (ie. exactly the same outcome as passing to someone who needs)  
---
Yes that is a tough one, can't tell which one makes more sense.
---
We will take back Silverpine Forest for the Alliance!
---
How is it stealing their gear? If I use the money to then buy gear that makes me better at what I do, what makes that person entitled to the gear, but not me?
---
I legit got the book from my first DM run on a private server, but i always wonder how legit their loot tables actually are
---
It's more like "How I look in PvP" vs "How I look in PvE".
---

---
It only happens to repeated offenders.
---
You'll see people calling others out for ninjaing in trade chat all the time, but it's not like everyone is keeping a list of it, nor is there an easy way to prove any of these claims. So most people just ignore it.
---
I have 3 monitors but being able to flip through it and still have the game open to do rotation / craft / move / ect is more appealing to me. Also being able to physically check through my leveling guide is nice so i know whats done and what isnt.

---
True, people overestimate the community, but at the same time, going ninja on items frequently is what leads tho that belief.  You might get away with it here and there but sooner or later, it will catch up.
---
I agree with this. Most important while leveling. Can also be important while raiding but only with well coordinated groups. In dungeons you will usually have the option to drink between pulls when combat is broken even if the tank pulls again right away so it‚Äôs not as important - unless of course you forgot to bring, or are low on things to drink
---
&lt;War Front&gt; on US Frostmane.  Technically we came from Frostwolf in a mass exodus but I don't recall being established as &lt;War Front&gt; prior to the move.

That's just sad.  You can have it all in digital format like most people have?
---
Is it even a game at that point? Playing something litterally by the book like this just looks unfun and depressing to me but w/e floats your boat

This is not a quality of life change
---
All three will work, however Shadow Priest will have the toughest time finding a slot in raids.
---
Haha no we‚Äôre just kidding around. The man in the van is a motivational speaker by the name of Matt Foley.
---
I've narrowed down my list of classes to play as my main to warlock (was my main during vanilla and liked it), priest, rogue, mage, or shaman.  Not 100% sure I'll play in a pvp server, but prolly will (was pvp during vanilla, switched to pve shortly after tbc release).  Definitely going horde ( I was alliance during vanilla).  Not sure about races and specs yet of course.
---
Uh what's that?

I have not seen this level of dedication in any game outside of eve online, I'm impressed.

September is summer?  From when?

WoWhead's drop rates rely on people using the WoWhead client to report that drops when people loot a certain NPC. As that client didn't exist (I assume!) in 2007, and Classic isn't out yet, it can't record the drop rates.
---
my guild was only ever able to kill Chromaggus once, and you bet your ass I was hording DKP for that crossbow. It actually dropped, i was floored.
---
It was so fun to PvP with that thing, clothies died from aimshot / multishot combo on the regular
---
BoE = money pile. Everyone needs a money pile.
---
Yes we all rolled for the item meaning we all had an equal shot at it. 
---
Nobody "needs" any item anymore than people "need" gold.
---
Dungens at your current level is for gear not to "get rich quick". If you take a genuine upgrade away from someone then your contributing to whats wrong with this community. 
---
Ultimately don't PUG. The community morals are not high enough to rely on them to do the right thing. 
---
How do I know? I healed all through vanilla and have been tanking ever since BC. It could be day one of a new dungeon and people rage quite the moment s tank or healer make a mistake...hell they rage quit if they don't like your pace...or if you want CC...anything aside from making it easy for them. 
---
P.s. I know its not the entire community but sweet geezus it happened everyday when I was playing BFA.
---
I'll be playing priest if you want to share a PDF &lt;3
---
The problem with the new books are that they have all the new lore in it.
---
I can really recommend the old books like Lord of clans (the thrall origin), day of the dragon (a group saves the red dragon clan from the orcs, really great concept for wow) and the third the last guardian (the story of khadgar the first war, medivh and karazhan).
---
My girlfriend told me that the war of the ancient are also really old school in the sake of the lore but I never read them sadly. (we have all the books but nobody has time for that)
---
Are you high?  Of course when most normal people say SUMMER they mean from June 1st, the calendar way.  Why the calendars and official seasons are for then?
---
So does that mean that I have to roll against 4 other people for the truefaith vestments pattern every single time it drops simply because it can be sold on the ah? Seems like a raw deal for a priest.
---
people will always be happy for the crit buff

You cant prevent ninjas altogether, but that isn't a reason to ninja everything.  The idea behind the community is that people remember other players who screwed them.  It may not be perfect, but that isn't a very good excuse.  I remember addons designed to allow you to make notes about players you grouped with and, if they make a return, it will be a great way to avoid ninjas.

&lt;Core&gt; on Stormscale EU, played in that same guild for the entirety of vanilla after it was founded in early 2005, clearing all vanilla content. I wish that same group could be brought together again for classic.
---
Always need a BOE in a pug. If you win it‚Äôs yours to do with what you will. You can give the Staff of Jordan to the mage if you want. 
---
You can ask the group on the onset what rules everyone is abiding by but there is nothing to hold them to it. If that staff drops after everyone has agreed to need&gt;greed or ms&gt;os that doesn‚Äôt mean anyone won‚Äôt take a server reputation hit for that staff.

8.2 on retail (yuck) is likely to be late June. I highly doubt they would release classic to overlap with retail so they will probably release classic when 8.2 is dying down and people are beginning to unsubscribe. My guess is  probably in like August time. Just my prediction.
---
Is there a place on xpoff.com that shows all of the BIS lv19 gear for vanilla twinks?
---
Going human priest for the same reason. Dwarves could have a racial that allowed them to one-shot raid bosses and I still wouldn't play one because no way am I going to spend all that time leveling and playing while staring at a toon a despise the look of.
---
Both of you joined a group to get upgrades.  You decided that the other guy could go to hell and stole his upgrade so you could sell it to him instead.
---
Damn, I'm gonna do that now once I buy my new printer today.
---
Depends on how much it sells for. If it's selling for a couple of gold then people will probably just let you have it if you ask. If it's selling for 100 gold, then you're need for the pattern likely doesn't outweigh their need for 100 gold in their eyes, so yeah, you'll have to roll against them.
---
Openly asking OP to violate copyright law lol
---
You mention what happened in trade chat and then I add that person's name to my little notepad by my computer telling me who to never group with. If you feel comfortable being a loot ninja with that seemingly light sentence then by all means go ahead. I have to warn you, I think that punishment is much more severe than you think it is.

It‚Äôs definitely rough for alliance locks in solo PvP. Undead rogues can break your first fear or seduction with WotF then pop their trinket for the next one basically leaving you death coil to get any breathing room. Your PvP trinket doesn‚Äôt break stun either so basically you‚Äôre boned if you get caught alone and don‚Äôt catch them out of stealth.
---
But in organized PvP paladins are your saving grace. Not only will they save your ass with BoP, cleanse and freedom but you won‚Äôt have to deal with them cleansing your shit either (only priests can for horde). 
---
It was definitely frustrating when I played my lock since I rarely did premades, ended up doing mostly PvE on him because of it.
---
Items on AH can vary based on supply vs demand and server.  Why should any of that matter?  We both invested time and effort on this run.  Why should your item matter more than mine?
---
even in vanilla itself the drop rates were tweaked a few times.
---
Our territory, our rules. 
---
Goes for both sides.
---
Haha m2 I am only 26 but rushing home After school so you were able to play WoW longer, Damn Good old times!
---
That's fine, but that's not going to deter any people who would say they'll equip and then don't, so that's why everyone else is going to just roll need. No muss, no fuss.

Sorry dude but for most people december 20th is winter. Just because winter doesn't start until the 21st doesn't mean shit to most people. This is what I was applying to the discussion at hand. So while september is technically summer if you go by calendar definition, most people consider that early autumn.
---
Guess that‚Äôs the problem with running pugs then! 
---
Set the rules at the start.
---
This is great! I haven‚Äôt jumped on the discord quite yet but I wanted to say I love listening to your podcast.:)
---
Well, first of all, people join dungeons for many different reasons, but ignoring that, since the item is worth gold, it not only represents an upgrade for the class that could use it, but also for everyone else, so I gotta ask again, how is it stealing? It wasn't his, he didn't do any more work for it to drop than I did, so why is he entitled to it?
---
It counts from when mana is removed from your bar. So channeled spells will start the counter when you click the thing(but if it's a 6 sec channel you will start regening at the fifth second), and cast spells will start the counter when you finish the cast.
---
Axes from strat are better if you are alliance.
---
Plate vendors for a lot. And I wear cloth so maybe I'll need on some BoP for my mount...
---
It shouldn't. That's the point you're missing. Because you're saying *your* item matters more than mine. 
---
They're worth the same. That's why we both roll fairly for it...

---
Exactly this, you're gonna make the run sooner or later ,it's a fixed time, and it's really not a bad walk from SS to SFK.
---
I figured that would be the next argument you would try to make, and obviously you know why it's bogus, but just to play the game for you, plate vendors for a few gold at most, where as items we are discussing are potentially hundreds. Which is exactly the point I made in my comment. If the BoE is worth a few gold, you'll likely not get much resistance, if it's worth hundreds, then that's something everyone needs.
---
Well, at least people wont see you as a weeb :P
---
You both joined a dungeon to get gear.  An item dropped that he could immediately use, and you claim that you have the right to take it, sell it, and use whatever money you get to buy whatever you want.  Money was never the point, upgrades were.  Blurring the line is just an excuse.
---
How are classic warriors in world pvp? Used to be a big pvp/arena junkie in wotlk and stance dancing/skill cap wasn't an issue, but I also really liked rogues and their utility. I have no problem being opened up on, but I'm still torn between the two classes.
---
This discussion is actually incredibly simple if you approach it from a logical position, but (surprise) there's a majority of greedy people in the world who try to manipulate the conversation, just as it's happening here.
---
Let's imagine there are Priest BoE boots that average 40g on the auction house.
---
The Priest player has at any time the ability to purchase these boots for 40g.
---
The Priest player is in a group where these boots drop. If the other 4 party members win the boots, they have the ability to sell them and make 40 gold. If the Priest wins the boots, then he doesn't have to spend the 40 gold he would have to spend otherwise.
---
So it turns out that the class that wins the boots is completely irrelevant. No matter who wins the boots, it's +40 gold to that player.
---
Therefore, the only logical way to approach BoEs is to allow all party members to roll need on the item, as all players in the party contributed equally to obtaining the item, and the item has an equivalent value to all members of the group.
---
To suggest that such an item should be defaulted to you merely on the basis of the class you decided to play is an incredibly greedy and entitled position to take, and holds no water logically.
---
you dont need to alt tab if you have a 2nd screen....
---
If you play on a PvP server, tough shit.
---
One of these classes get a free mount
---
If it's causing problems just let him play what he fuckin wants, at least he'd still be playing with you
---
I don‚Äôt remember his face looking like that at all... wow wtf
---
You should let him play what he likes ... and gank him!
---
But seriously, it sounds like a shared level experience wouldnt be that much fun if your preferences are so differently and especially if he really doesnt like leveling.
---
But where is the problem if he rolls a human character? You are not forced to do the same. You can meet a few levels later?
---
This isn't a hostage negotiation, sometimes people are going to break the rules.  Acting like a dick preemptively doesn't make it ok.
---
Again, why is his item worth more than mine? A BoE represents a pile of gold, for *everyone* even the person that will equip it right away because that's gold he didn't have to spend on it. So, why does he get a free pass on his pile of gold? He doesn't. We all roll for it.
---
 I mean telling them they can't play human is kinda the opposite of vanilla. Play what you want, don't force you or them to do something they don't want to do.
---
 I wanna play with friends, but they're going Horde. I dislike Horde, so I am going Alliance. It is that simple.
---
Reign of Darkness, Stormscale.
---
Dude... im in the same boat. From what iv heard warriors are great at 60 and almost unstoppable if geared well. Rogues almost same deal. It comes down pretty much if you want to tank at all or not. If you wanna tank at any time go warrior but if you wanna be a dps only and have fun ganking anyone and everyone in open world go rogue. :) hope that helps.
---
Vanish gets you out of root fyi. In the 30s it is definitely an even matchup, especially considering the mage will also have a mob he is in the middle of fighting and may already be low health
---
I've seen pretty much the same points when Starcraft 1 remaster was happening. Units there are very dumb and without some serious micro management you could lose a fight you had advantage in because your army was stuck somewhere.
---
It's an old system but it added a huge skill cap and those who mastered it had great advantage in micro intensive army compositions against people who went for brute force type of gameplay. Of course I'm talking about top end pvp. It didn't matter that much for lower rankings.
---
I'm pretty sure the same thing applies here. Most people won't use it to their advantage. They will just play the game but high end players will use the system to make predictions and interrupt abilities they wouldn't be able to without. 
---
I like this unique layer and, since it was in Classic, I'm glad it's there even in the reduced form.
---
Both sides have good points so it doesn't really matter and neither solution wouldn't "kill" Classic.
---
I would legitimately bet that the time a mage puts in to grind out the cash for his epic mount is less than the time a warlock spends completing their epic mount questline.
---
I don‚Äôt get it
---
You don't have to be sorry
---
You can buy tokens in Wow classic?
---
i mean the meme isnt very smart
---
He was really bad. Had a pocket healer all the time during his video. Then he died 1v1 to a NAKED rogue.
---
Well later on in the games cycle they switched it so needing turns item into BoP. This type of discussion was probably one of the reasons why they did it in the past. But on topic, with randoms always need.
---
Definitely gotta save a slot for Druid execute(moonfire spam).
---
This sums it up about as simply as you can. A BoE dropping is equivalent to a pile of gold dropping. You're rolling on a pile of gold.
---
reddit mods are asleep, time to post low effort memes
---
Ah yes, the rubber dishwashing gloves.
---
He was really bad. Had a pocket healer all the time during his video. Then he died 1v1 to a NAKED rogue. Nevertheless his video is great entertainment, no doubt!
---
I'm not saying we can prevent ninjas, but setting the rules and being a decent person is the only option other than ninja or be ninja'd.  As for the staff of jordan, I used it because it was in the OP's scenario, but I see no reason why the item or value should matter.  It really doesn't matter whether the person in your party is a twink or main, they invested the same time and effort in that group as everyone else.
---
During Vanilla, when 1.5 hit, I reached exalted within 1 month. 1.5-1.7 AV was, without exaggerating, the best time I had in any videogame (I'm 35 yo).  
---
After a few days reading the official US forums, I now remember why most if not all of my guildmates (form a decent sized raiding guild with PvP afficionados among them) didn't liked it. They were clueless about what to do or can be done in AV.  
---
As I was every day in AV, skipped maybe too many raid nights because "not tonight sry, I'm in AV", they started to be angry at me.  
---
When 1.8 hit, some started to ask me why I liked it so much. So I took them in and showed all we could do, they started to take interest. But... 1.8 being the 1st nerf to AV, I lost interest pretty quickly. It already felt empty to me, boring.  
---
To me, the majority of the hate about 1.5-1.7 AV is about reward-MoH-honor whine, and/or misunderstandings.
---
So you trust everything that gets posted in trade chat?
---
/2 Absynthexx ninja'd staff of Jordan from our group. Do not group with him.
---
If you're playing with a party of friends and guildies that you can rely on to use the BOE that dropped then fair enough you shouldn't need on them just to sell to the AH. 
---
If however you're in a PUG with a bunch of randoms then any BOE that's worth a decent amount should be needed on by everyone because you know full well that there's a 99% chance that the person who claims that they're going to use it will also sell the item to the AH due to how important gold is in Vanilla (especially early on).  
---
This applies to the expensive BOE items and not every random green/blue that can be listed for 10g, if you're needing on them just for the slightest edge in gold then you're a dick and will quickly make a name for yourself.
---
The main game membership is on acct wide
---
Damn, congrats on the updates. :D
---
No, you're right, neither solution would kill classic, which is why I think people should see past this as just a sane thing that anyone playing a reactive game would want.  
---
I don't think the 20 ppl on each realm trying to hit spell batch windows are worth everyone else losing their interrupts to CD's while getting CC'd.  
---
@Arsh yeah I'm just pulling this out of thin air, I've never played WoW  **:l**
---
I don't really care either way, 98% won't notice the difference and some people obviously think it matters a lot (even though they haven't played vanilla spellbatching in over a decade) and makes things better so who knows.  
---
200ms sounds like a hell of a long time to have a window to counter things but considering how the server/client works we'll have to see it in practice to make any big statements about whether it makes gameplay feel better or worse.  
---
At the end of the day it's a ability based tab target RPG where most skills are on a GCD so the idea that it should play the same as a FPS is kinda silly.  
---
Vanilla pvp is already kind of nonsense with everything having a base resist chance and spamming invis potions/FAP/reflectors/tidal charm so whatevs.
---
Base dmg, prolly agony and corruption.
---
&gt; stand still and not do anything in a fight for like 20-40 seconds lol.
---
Yes! But you should be queueing heals anyway because mana regen doesnt stop until you actually CAST the spell. That way you can conserve mana but be ready to let one fire off just in case.
---
That thing will be worth a ton on horde this go round. It's like the BiS offhand for orc fury.
---
 I'm just way ahead of you guys
---
Kek
---
Disc is great. Power infusion is amazing on any mage friend if they are arcane power burst spec. Add that and they turn into gods as long as they don't pull threat
---
Between those 3 id say go shaman, because after you do the 30/0/21 build you can slowly build an Enh set then go about one shotting people with WF. But if you want to pvp and pve id say go druid. You can't be the best at anything but you can do everything.
---
Have you considered both playing Tauren and just chilling in Thunder Bluff? It's beautiful and peaceful.
---
I was in Norgannon, our Horde guild was &lt;Band the of the Red Hand&gt; 
---
Friendliest people ever. I really miss them.
---
This is actually an excellent point and why I will mostly run with guildies at max. I'm making the arguments in this topic from a point of view of someone who may not have that luxury.
---
My personal view is patterns should go to rolls of those who have and can demonstrate the profession in group and who express a need for it for their character. Weapons and armor should be greed for AH and need for equipping. Ninja looters calls apply if violated. Twink items are obvious and should always be need by everyone because no one should be expected to believe the toon in the dungeon is planning to twink the specific bracket they are currently leveling in. It should also be commonly accepted that building a twink costs money for any gear that can't be earned.
---
I know many will disagree with these boundaries and they will never be applied in pugs in reality. But it's simply my view of fairness. It's also mostly not my problem since I will be running with my guild and any high level pugs I run will have hard and soft reserves declared and master looter enabled.
---
I would bring the same consumes in my Mage, so I don't see what the big deal is
---
Assuming they need to do more than one or two months of beta testing
---
This is why you should just role the one true paladin class.
---
If I can get an equivalent item if I win, why is it your item?
---
And assuming you're joining a guild raid group to fill a few empty slots, i'd guess they already have a shadow priest in the group. Full PUG raids would probably be your best bet as a SP.
---
I tanked in WOTLK and enjoyed it, but definitely wouldn't want to just become a pve tanker all the time is my issue. No dual spec makes for a hard life.
---
Buy it off the AH then. Running a dungeon specifically for any boe is a waste of time anyways, it has a 6% drop chance. In the time it took for you to run the instance 20 times to get the drop you could have farmed enough gold to buy 5 of them.
---
Nobody has said that and this is poorly formatted at best
---
No, because the Truefaith Vestements pattern is BoP.
---
Even if it was BoE, it's not a "raw deal." You could just buy it off the AH like everyone else. You're not getting a raw deal just because people don't give you free stuff.
---
*picture of a man passed the F out only playing four hours per week*
---
Me.
---
No purpose? I thought Boomkins had a crit buff or something..
---
The Greed button's icon is literally a picture of gold, not sure where some of you get off thinking you "need" it for gold for a mount. If somebody is going to equip it, they roll need. If not, it's Greed.
---
I want to level a lock and get improved voidwalker to assist with leveling. How well can my pet tank 5 mans in place of a warrior if there is no tank to be found? Can the healer keep up? Assume the DPS wait for 2 or 3 torments before engaging and listen.
---
Was that named after the Wheel of Time series?
---
all in bids are a thrill
---
You are so random and wacky !!!
---
If you are wanting to play between those two id say go shaman. Shaman has two good dps specs and one healing spec as priest has one dps spec and its pretty mana hungry, meaning it eats up mana quick. If you want an "active" class also shaman as you will be placing totems down constantly and at some points having to totem twist agil and wf totem. Now if you want to heal mainly then go priest. :) hope this helps.
---
Thanks for the response! I was not aware that the chains were so different. I also hadn‚Äôt really thought about the differences in travel to dungeons between the factions. Interesting to think about.
---
You guys got bigger issues than faction choice
---
Laughs in Ret paladin
---
This post is the epitome of this sub. Sees it worked for someone else, minor/low effort changes, hopes for karma. Over it.
---
I can help with some input with the priest was my main in vanilla to xpacs that dont matter.
---
if you are afraid of 1v1 pvp on a priest when in your heal spec that i understand its a mana batle. But when you join as a healer in Bg's if its randoms you find the best geared war/mage/lock and play pocket healer its fun.. if its a premade you have a team to help you stay alive.
---
From my understanding people mainly split between holy and disc. There is some good use from a deep disc spec just for Power Infusion though so even if your not topping the healing charts, you'll still be useful!
---
Hey, I have no idea whatsoever what it leads to, just that end date is the extent of my ‚Äòscoop‚Äô.
---
I do see the argument of it being closer to a turn based RPG than an FPS, but these tick rates kill the proper function of interrupts in this game. We now have available to us fully functioning interrupts - so why not have them? (eventually, at least. I can see these phases being fully classic.)
---
Shadow Word: Pain has the most damage/tick afaik.
---
A warlock pet will be horrible for tanking 5 man content.
---
Why do people act like Will of the Forsaken is some spammable ability that you are always immune to fear with?
---
I have not played since Vanilla, except for a bit during Legion but I hardly ever saw any Alliance out in the open due to all the sharding/phasing.
---
I just think that fair fights are more fun.
---
Have you considered some type of content vetting before it gets added? I just sat through a 10:15 video where the only relevant information was already said within the first minute. And then I watched the rest of the video, but it turns out there was nothing of importance. He just stretched a ~1min video to +10minutes for that YouTube money.
---
That's the reason you have a couple of restos and ferals in the raid 
---
Sadly, blizz didn't push the spec specific utility enough
---
Give moonkins 5% crit and 5% spell power buff or something like that 
---
Or said buff after they've critted, they'd probably be able to close the gap between top performing specs
---
Same with elemental and enhancement shaman sadly
---
Forbid him from eating soy.
---
Could you hand me your guide? :)
---
I probably played 5 hours a day M-Thurs, 6-8 hours on Friday, and 12-15 hours Saturday and Sunday.  50-60 hours a week.
---
beserking is awesome, people are nuts
---
First of all, people don't join dungeons for many different reasons. They join it to get gear.  They might join it to farm certain unique items which are separate from weapon/armor upgrades, which is another matter entirely.  If you simply want gold, there are plenty of farming methods.  Once you're in, you're all investing the same time and effort for gear.  If rogue gear drops, obviously this is what the rogue is here for.  If he happens to have something better, then everyone rolls greed for a bit of extra cash.  You're making the case that every single item that drops should be judged by how it could benefit everyone vs how it should benefit the class it was designed for.  As I mentioned in my post, this is a BS argument.  I might as well judge every single BoP item as vendor trash towards my mount if we're going to play that way.
---
Being patient and watching the auction house. Being things at low price you know are valuable and then flipping it later. You need some gold at first to do this. You could become an enchanter and sit in your home city saying trade you're doing enchants for their mats, tips appreciated. You'll get ppl wanting chants and tipping you for your service. Level mining, skinning or herb while leveling even if you aren't gonna keep them to stock up on mats for other professions, people won't buy them at open of servers cause no one will have gold but later they will. Making the end game bags too with tailoring is another good way. I could go on and on about this but this is some of the few basic ways.
---
Here is your answer, ask him to create an alt so u 2 can play together.
---
1 there's no reason to accuse random people of ninja looting for no reason. 
---
2 often the case is others from the same group pile on trashing the ninja in trade chat. In some cases the ninja even has some saucy retort involving their mothers.
---
You can't ninja something if everyone needs on it...
---
And the community is not your personal army, people are not going to remember everyone that has ever done something shitty, especially if there's no easy way to prove it.
---
In most situations there are things that you can do to prevent yourself from getting screwed.
---
If you chose to not take those precautions, do not expect anyone to care about you getting screwed.
---
Gathering professions, farming mobs for cloth/felcloth, fishing/cooking raid consumables, or flipping items at the AH.
---
extra haste = faster attacks = more threat. 
---
They have a straight up DPS increase for a racial, other horde tanks do not (except Orcs, but you get a 50% healing reduction for 20 seconds so you cant use it)
---
√Ñhm.. those were the words someone I talked to about 8 years ago when we realised we both played WoW and that's pretty much how I felt in this situation.
---
No idea where all the hate comes from tbh and thought people had similiar situations and could relate
---
Am I too young to understand this? I understand the image but not the title paires with it.
---
Pain ticks more but corruption from SM locks can proc nightfall
---
A 2 minute cooldown spell is considered spammable in wow classic. If you don't think it's really op, try playing warlock alliance in pvp. Fear is just not that great is all.
---
Greatly.
---
Prolly go with lock, mages seemed to be one button spammers in raids. And in pvp locks are one of the best
---
DPS wise I think SW:P is a little bit higher than Corruption, but typically warlocks will have much better gear and it can proc nightfall so, corruption. CoA might do more damage but it'd be lower dps.
---
I mained an undead priest for quite a while in vanilla, both as healer and shadow, then a rogue. I'm tempted to go back though I dont know if I'd be allowed to shadow this time round.
---
Then again I can't even decide whether to play alliance or horde.. depends on if I find a decent guild I guess.
---
I remember people raging about combat looting. Good times.
---
Recipes should be the same as anything else.  If a tailor plan drops, tailors get to roll need.
---
Oooh I see, so liquidate assets to pay for gametime?
---
Yeah! Tie that up with findfury and hand of justice and ur good to go. :p
---
Huh?
---
Yet horde doesnt have to so jailbreak, the Escort in brd  that is so bad that it is nearly impossible to get  guildies  to help  you.
---
I don't think you realize the difference of playing WoW 3 hours a day and playing classic 3 hours a day though.
---
When you log on and play classic, you work towards a specific goal and do what you want. When you log on and play modern wow, you first need to sort out all your daily stuff and then you've already spent a lot of time but only sit left with a feeling of "what now" - especially towards the end of the week when your dailies are done. It's a lot more of an unfun feeling.
---
That Tauren range though... also being a cow is kind of awesome.
---
Yea rogue as these other fine gents said. You'll get so much amusement out of running around questing zones sapping people over and over. About to get ganked? Hah np lemme just blind you and vanish. And ganking around with a druid as a rogue is one of the funnest things in the game.
---
Cloth paladin, aka priest.
---
I'm going Tauren for the AOE stun and health boost but I also dont PvP much and plan on tanking all the way to 60, thank god my wifes playing a shaman and will do the primary killing.
---
Why not increase the debuff limit, because the only reason it was there was hardware limitations, which clearly isn't an issue today.  That's a serious question, why not raise it?
---
No it was a thing I‚Äôm pretty sure (instant spells when MCd) Mechanics like that didn‚Äôt fuck around bk then.
---
Ret.
---
I can't have a Classic Summer if the game doesn't release until the end of summer! PepeHands
---
They aren't BiS for Orcs / Humans. They became BiS later in the game because there were so many different raced warriors without the racials. Everyone will be Orc or Human this time around, so they really aren't that big a deal.
---
Horde have one in durator.
---
Vanilla is a slower paced game compared to modern MMO, let alone FPS games.
---
Fast-paced twitch-action 100-tick-rate gameplay does not belong in Vanilla.
---
If you're concerned about getting dotted when you peek around a corner because the update rate is too slow then you should probably be playing a different game.
---
We now have available to us fully functional interrupt abilities - we could just have those instead of trying to edge each other out on what's basically server-level exploits.  
---
(I can see keeping it entirely classic for all first phases coming out though, for sure)
---
Daaaaaang downvoted into oblivion just for a guess on what blizzard is going to do. DAAAAAAAAAAAANG. 
---
Not saying I want them in the game lol.
---
Let him play alliance, then gank the shit out of him.
---
1000% Go orc, the stun resist is amazing and the pet % is great in both pvp and pve. undead warlocks are for the aesthetic rp look of a true warlock.  So if you want to be a bad ass looking warlock go undead. but if you want to be statistically better, go orc.
---
The voidwalker CAN definitely tank, but it struggles with large mobs until it has it's AoE taunt.   
---
Everyone needs to attack the target the voidwalker is attacking or else it will be unable to hold aggro.   
---
With that said, although the voidwalker CAN tank, it's certainly worse than warrior or druid. I am not sure how it compares to paladin, however I assume it is also worse than that.   
---
tldr: Voidwalker can tank, but it probably shouldn't.
---
Choose the one you consider u like more as a main and then create an alt. Problem solved.
---
Humans suck for pvp. A dwarf is a better anything than human if you're strictly min-maxing pvp. Perception is nice for duelling but is rarely useful in actual pvp.
---
&lt;Kiss Army&gt; 
---
Good times
---
Axe skill, stun resist, and an extra dps cooldown. Orc is the obvious choice for horde warrior.
---
lmao bro were you using rank 1 skills? Sounds like you were using rank 1 skills.
---
Okay once more for everyone: I was in this situation like 8 years ago with someone I barely knew and we realised we both played WoW and started discussing.
---
Anyway within 1 hour people in this sub either showed their superior meme-taste or/and that they use their brains before they respond :"hurr durr, no one ever says that.."
---

enjoy
---
So I don't have to alt tab to thottbot :p 
---
lets not pretend that everyone was figuring the quests out themselves in OG vanilla. I was personally using a website like wowhead or thottbot when i couldn't figure out where to go. 
---
I actually like level and dont mind using questie. I dont find it really takes anything away from the experience, I actually get more from it because im not missing quests that are off the beaten path
---
Personally i use a G502, so i have a few extra buttons, but theyre spread out.  I also dont use all of them because theyre not all comfortable.
---
I only currently use 2 of the side ones.  Really should get the 3rd bound (right now the front and back ones are the same bind), but im just not sure i can adjust to it.  
---
I use the two to the left of the left mouse button a lot.
---
I have the mouse wheel left/right disabled because its way too sensitive, especially with the heavy middle click and mouse wheel.  I accidentally hit them all the damn time, so i just disabled it. (or made it middle click, i dont remember).  
---
The button behind the scroll wheel lock doesnt really get used, its just too hard to get to reliably.  
---
So i guess at this point i basically have 4 extra binds there, which i then use modifiers for (ctrl+alt+shift).  Its not as many as the big MMO mice, but like you...i just couldnt possibly use that many binds close together.  I like that these are spread out a bit between my thumb and fingers.
---
Do you have to stand still for it to happen?
---
‚ÄúJokers and Smokers‚Äù was a fun bunch. They actually let around 13 year old me raid with them. Thanks to their patience I got to see raid content all the way up to a few bosses in naxx. Am grateful
---
You should make a downloaded PDF version of this. I'd love you forever.
---
If you run out of mana, just feign death and drink. You probably need to reset aggro by that point, anyway.
---
I startet on burning legion in vanilla and in BC the server became heavly polish populated and during wotlk nobody spoke english anymore, had to take a free server transfer in cata because it continued to be so bad. However the swedish/danish I have played on was not as bad, atleast they mostly spoke english.
---
Yes, they do. People join dungeons to finish quests, gain levels, complete attunements, get gear, help friends/guildies, or because they just plain find them fun.
---
And no, BoP items sell for such low amounts to vendors that it's not even worth discussing. They also can't be gotten any other way other than running the dungeon and killing the boss that holds it. 
---
BoE items can be bought at the AH. That means that Rogue could have just bought the item. That means that the item represents gold to them as well. That means it's incredibly greedy to act like they are entitled to the gear more than everyone else is entitled to the gold. 
---
The actual BS arguments are yours, bud.
---
I think the arguments are a bit more valid, at least for a start, to keeping the debuff limit closer to how it played in vanilla.
---
If you open the game up to an infinite debuff limit you'd have to rebalance quite a bit when it comes to raiding. I can see them doing that as well as making us aware it'll have to come with balance changes later on.  
---
The arguments for the interplay of these abilities is to just have stuff actually work.
---
I'm gladiator paladin, warriors are best synergy with paladin. It just works amazing. The heals the stuns and the plate armor beats anything. Counter by mage or rogue? Bop bubbles and freedom. You will feel like a God when playing next to him.
---
But ret is bench spec :(
---
This is wonderful. I would much rather have it in physical form like most people.
---
Warlock for the soloing thing for sure. Enh shamans are almost never viable in raiding so if you want to raid don't go enh. Enh didn't get really good at raiding until BC when they could dual wield and even then they weren't that great. But if you want to pvp as a melee class enh can be really good once you get geared. Getting a nice big WF proc and almost one shotting someone is so satisfying.
---
Haha I‚Äôm 36! Long live the real AV!
---
I‚Äôd so much rather no one post anything rather than these garbage memes lol
---
Hi, /u/pabl01313
---
Dude no idea why you're writing any diary entery about WoW retail - we're in the classic section aren't we. 
---
Sorry, just annoyed by those many negative responds without actually pointing out what they dont like about it
---
Ret is the only paladin spec in my eyes ;)
---
There's 4 pieces to mana regen we need to establish before I get into the strategy:
---
1. Mana regenerates in ticks of 2 seconds each.  So if you regenerate 100 mana per 5 seconds, you're really getting mana in chunks of 40 every 2 seconds.  This applies both inside the 5-second rule and outside.
---
2. Mana regeneration inside the 5-second rule is limited to your "MP/5" gear, as well as Druids and Priests who get a portion of their spirit regen back through talents.  (I am ignoring effects which can trigger to give you more mana).
---
3. Full Mana regeneration from spirit starts 5 seconds after the last time you spent mana on something.  This means if you have a free cast, it doesn't stop your regen.  It also means if you finish casting a heal at T=0, and start casting your next 3-second heal at T=4, then you'll regenerate 1 "tick" of regen while you're casting, before you spend your next burst of mana at T=7.  And, sometimes it takes 6 or 7 seconds to get mana back, because even though it's been 5 seconds, you haven't hit a regen tick.
---
4. In combat or out of combat doesn't matter.  The rule is only based on when you last cast.  The difference for in-combat vs. out-of-combat applies to health regeneration.
---
With that said, the best strategy is to spend your mana in bursts.  Let's say you can heal the tank for 1/4 of his health.  Wait until he's at 40%, then chain-cast 3 heals (he'll probably need a 3rd heal by that time) and then regen.  The more regen time you can chain together, the better.
---
If those heals are 5 seconds apart, then in one scenario you get no regen, and in the other you still get like 9 seconds of regen.
---
PI and AP don't stack bro.
---
Joining a PUG is about teamwork.  We all show up and roll on the items that drop because they benefit us.  Trying to take items out of other people's hands so you can sell them is called ninjalooting.  A BoP for another class would earn a small amount of gold, but you'd be pissed if someone stole boss loot for your class.  His item isn't worth more or less than yours, it just happens to be for his class.  Claiming that it should go to you instead because he could go farm gold and buy it on the AH is a horseshit excuse.
---
If you have a tank and healer its not too bad.
---
Probably easier on a PvP realm because Southshore is more popular there.
---
People get super salty over all kinds of stupid shit and will try to do everything they can to ruin someone's day, including making shit up about them in trade chat.
---
I thought you guys were referencing the caravan quests in EPL after Cata...heh.
---
Pservers also have higher populations then retail. It's not exactly the right spawn rate but it's often not mentioned that pservers don't have blizzlike populations. They also have way more raiding guilds than a normal blizzard server will have since pservers have every geological area on the same server.
---
Even if it's set to 1hr static respawn that's 4 lotus an hour, 96 a day, and 672 in a week. There's not enough tanks and healers that raid to consume that supply in a 3k - 5k population. Now that's assuming every lotus gets picked but if they're not then you're on a server with little competition and you can realistically farm lotus yourself. When AV comes out there's a lotus spawn there too but, I don't know if it's blizzlike for it to be up immediately, but if it is then lotus supply becomes even more inflated.
---
Flasks really arnt bad, 200g (100g a pop which it probably won't be after AV) a week is pretty easy to farm as a boomkin since you can 2 man DMT with a rogue.
---
There are several good youtube videos on the subject. I'd suggest starting with Frostadamus.
---
&gt; Money was never the point, upgrades were.
---
It's almost as if that money could be spent on upgrades.
---
Also it's not really your business what players choose to spend their money on. "You shouldn't try to get a mount because you should already have one by now anyways" is a ridiculous argument.
---
What server?
---
since the vast majority of the players on classic will be experienced players they probably wont queue low level bgs to be stomped by twinks so i expect the low level bgs to have insane queues tbh.
---
I also started out on Aerie Peak as Horde, small guild named knights of oblivion.
---
What was your characters name? I was in righteous dawn and knew a ton of people from brethren and pias
---
I distinctly remember questing up there when i started in Wrath, but for the life of me i cant remember the questline.
---
I think i even remember some of what you had to kill, but i just dont remember the context...
---
I am pretty sure there will be server transfers at some point, as it is something nobody would be against it and blizzards everlasting love for money.
---
Warlocks remain the dark horse. You will see 2x more mages guaranteed
---
&gt; Orc 100% Looks better
---
I could't disagree more.  In fact, it's the combat animations that are going to make me roll a Tauren Warrior.  I am not a fan of the hunched over pose.
---
I mean, I totally agree. And looking cool while standing around in Ironforge is like 90% of classic, anyway. But it's tough to get groups as a ret.

these old models and animations are so cool
---
If it drops at random in a dungeon, the tailor just found it without having the pay the AH for it.  You might as well demand anyone with herb or mining give you a chunk of what they collect because you were there.
---
Holy crap, I cant believe so many people put their forms on modified keys. So stupid lol
---
Alfiey / Excalibur / Karmerr =D
---
does /sit help to regain mana and health ?
---
I can‚Äôt remember if that‚Äôs just for PVP servers, but either way I‚Äôll pick one server per faction.
---
Just create a level 1 character, log in, look at the server time. Google what the time is in EST or PST if you need to and there you have it.
---
Did you forget about thottbot / wowhead? I think i burnt out my keyboards alt+tab back in the day from using the website so much.
---
Questie just removes the alt tabbing lol
---
I‚Äôm advocating equal chance when it comes to BOE rare and epics because it levels the playing field. You‚Äôre advocating equal outcomes without any enforcement mechanism. People will get burned either way. At least in the ‚Äúeveryone need‚Äù scenario you have the players who would otherwise greed rolling need. You want those people rolling need to offset the rogue(example) rolling need against the mage. Then at least if the mage loses he/she has a higher chance of still receiving the staff. 
---
And the inherent value of the staff being a twink item will indefinitely tempt more people to roll for the AH.
---
&gt; What is everyone's opinion on enchanters needing BoPs for disenchanting in a situation where everyone should be using greed?
---
For BoE items, the value of that item is the same for every player in the group. That's why it makes sense for all players to roll need.
---
BoPs are obviously different because now the equip value will almost always be much greater than the vendor/enchant value. Now you're kind of an ass if you roll to enchant an item that's a clear upgrade for someone.
---
BoEs and BoPs are very different.
---
You understand also. Sadly a lot of the no changes crowd are not seeing the obvious. Sharding only has to last a few days but there will be a giant bottleneck of players never seen before in vanilla which had players trickle in continously.
---
It's not like the game would have a five pots of coffee if tick rates were like an FPS shooter.   
---
Never was I implying that I wished for WoW to have a gameplay similar to an FPS either, I was merely trying to explain what a weird request it is to have a bad tick rate in a game.  
---
All that would happen is you'd never not interrupt on time.
---
Depends on how dedicated you will be on your alt if it's worth playing them with herbalism or to keep herbalism on your priest and just grab stuff on your way to dungeons and such. 
---
I mean you don't \*need\* tailoring on your priest, you can just get T1 or blues it wont be the end of the world.
---
Dat +2 beastslaying.
---
With that extra tid bit then definitely go rogue. The world is a rogues playground for world pvp.
---
Came to say this. PUG atmosphere BOE's are free games unless an agreement is made.
---
No, so you're totally free to set up a /pat macro and run around encouraging all the ranged dps.
---
Do you really not see how you're being the greedy one for saying you deserve the BoE because you're going to use it? If you deserve it so much, then go pay for it. You didn't do any more work than I did to get it to drop, so why do you get to use it and save 100g vs me getting to sell it and make 100g?
---
Yeah that's exactly what I'm worried about.

To each their own, i personally can't stand Taurens attack animations for 2hs but them being tanks is decent looking.

Yeah I could try to post something this week.  Probably about how MMO mice are overrated, and my preference for the rival 600 or any other mouse with 3 thumb buttons
---
Personally I will hope to avoid STV this time around. I just find the quests to be too tedious for such a populated zone, forcing me to compete for quest mobs and such. I'm targetting a Kalimdor-heavy playthrough.
---
Your arguments get even more ridiculous. I put in the time to level my mining, so I get to make use of the mining nodes. The rare shit gets sent to get rolled on anyway. 
---
A BoE drop represents the same amount of work from all party members, so all party members get a shot at it.
---
It's been lasting for 15 years already, thanks to private servers
---
Ah. A simple truth that extinguishes my entire question.
---
lol  they were a thing in vanilla.  No one on a pserver "discovered" them.
---
It's for Ony attunement on the Alliance side, you have to escort Marshal Windsor from his prison cell in BRD.
---
Bullshit.
---
And I just explained to you how there are plenty, especially when you include trash. 
---
Let's take ZG for example. Most groups on private servers are bringing 5 healers because you actually need that many for Hakkar. But you could have 2 or 3 healers for almost everything else. That leaves plenty of opportunity for a hybrid Druid to offtank on one of the many bosses in ZG where offtanking is required.
---
Now, that Druid can't be your ONLY offtank. You need 2 tanks for Hakkar in addition to the five healers, which I think is the point that you're trying to make. But you can have a DPS Warrior as your 2nd tank for Hakkar. And on the earlier bosses, that Warrior gets to DPS while the hybrid Druid offtanks.
---
Man that's insane! I'm studying for sec+ right now too. I'm in the air Force and it's required for my job.

How would Holy paladin fare?
---
I really don't like how this post is framed. I think the idea of a discussion around BoE etiquette is a great idea, but this post doesn't really do that as much as offering your opinion as if you are in some way an authority on this subject. There are parts of this post I agree with, but there's a lot that I find deeply questionable.
---
&gt;People do not need mounts. Don't get me wrong, mounts are awesome, but you already made it 40 levels without one, you can survive a bit longer. Prioritizing your luxury item, in this case a mount, above someone else's need to upgrade their gear is a dick move no matter how you spin it. In fact, why are you even drawing the line at BoEs? If your mount is so important, roll need on every singe drop in that dungeon because BoP items for other classes could still be vendored toward that mount fund. This no-trust mentality that we all need to nab the loot before the ninjaooters steal our mounts needs to die a long and horrible death. You wouldn't question the mage for rolling on a BoP staff, but all the sudden, a BoE drops and suddenly, you should be the one to decide he doesn't really need it?
---
This logic is truly insane to me. You're going to use the mount far FAR longer than you're going to use a level 35 epic. And you absolutely do NOT need a level 35 epic to kill things. So it seems bizarre to me that one would say that the mount in this case is the luxury item, as if that's the only way to see it. I understand arguments can be made either way here, and I think that discussion of this would be a good idea. In my opinion either the mount or the staff of jordan could be considered a luxury item here. Personally, I'd lean more towards the Staff of Jordan being the luxury, but I could be convinced otherwise. 
---
Most of my disagreements with OP stem from this point here. Saying that anyone "needs" something of value that anyone in the party could benefit from seems like a very subjective position, in my opinion.   
---
&gt; The biggest gripe I had with the first post was the sheer number of people claiming that BoEs are nothing more than AH trash, as if it was a logical argument. They essentially said "hey \[class\], I know we all came to this dungeon to score some gear, but that was before we knew a super rare item was going to drop. We honestly cannot see why a \[class\] would want to have an epic item instead of having a quick payday, so we're shooting dice to see who gets it. We would also accept a mafia style tribute where you buy us out for the privilege of upgrading your gear, because we're so kind and generous to our fellow players. We realize this might seem unfair, but really you're being unfair for wanting to upgrade your gear when the rest of us feel we deserve some cold hard cash. If you want the item that bad, then you should go to the AH and pay a hefty fee to someone like myself because mounts are expensive, and I shouldn't have to live with that."
---
This seems like a strawman of the position that BoEs are valuable, and unlike BoPs they are valuable to people outside the party. To ignore that fact is willful ignorance. 
---
&gt;At this point, I'd like to pitch a compromise. One thing echoed by some on both sides was discussing the matter case by case, before each dungeon. I'm already planning to set a macro that states need it if you want to wear it, greed if you want to sell, BoEs are no exception. It seems like the best you can do and if people break the rules, then we can see how well the community works to root out the scumbags. However, it should go both ways. If you disagree with that stance, be upfront about it and set a macro of your own. "hey, I'm one of those guys and I'm gonna roll need on anything I can auction, if you don't like it, let's figure it out now."
---
I have pretty much no problems with this bit here. I think this issue is unlikely to be resolved in a forum post, and it's a great idea for parties to discuss this before starting the instance. So if I came across the OP in game, I just wouldn't play with him, and that's fine. He doesn't want to play with me, I don't want to play with him, and it's just easier for everyone if they're up front about how they see this issue.
---
Smart, focused, mature, experienced fury warrior. Ready to push. American and alliance. 28 years old. Professional bodybuilder (points for being a warrior in real life?). Would love to find a US guild to raid and pvp with. Hardcore.
---
Oh yeah, I remember that. 
---
I now decided to play horde.
---
Don't worry about finding dungeon groups. Anything will do since groups mostly just wanna fill the spots as soon as possible. Nobody will try to only invite certain classes. Groups will look for a dps and take what they get. 
---
Besides all classes are perfectly viable in dungeons as long as you know how to play it.
---
That combat log! Lol
---
My first guild was called "Kneecap Mafia" on Gilneas (mostly dwarves and gnomes). It was good fun until the GM got deployed and one of the few remaining guild officers changed the MotD to "Guild disbanded, everyone find a new one!"^1 By the time the GM got back, everyone was gone. I had him in my friends list, and saw him come online. We chatted for a while; he server transferred and tried to start again.
---
I moved to a guild a friend had started - Serial Killers - and finished leveling. At 60, the GM and I ran into a couple of rogues and a warrior; pretty soon we were running dungeons with them on the regular.  
---
Before we knew it, Serial Killers were joining After Dark almost as soon as they hit 60.
---
^1 Screw you, Kroova. Where ever you are.
---
Beast slaying for easier leveling
---
Regen for less downtime while leveling
---
Beserking for best dps cooldown at end game
---
Bow/throw spec so you don't miss when you have to do a ranged pull. 
---
Troll is obviously best choice.
---
Except that this ignores the whole point of dungeons.  Players are free to go farm gold through crafting, gathering, farming mobs, or buying/reselling on the AH.  Everyone in the party went out of their way to join a dungeon group to get gear, but you want to claim that the benefits no longer matter because you can sell it.  You cannot draw a line logically between BoE vs BoP items beyond claiming that one is worth more therefore, I should get a cut.  Make excuses all you want, but there is a reason they put need and greed buttons.
---
I think the population will swell and then the bubble will burst and it will diminish to smaller numbers but there will remain a dedicated, serious, and competent playerbase, to be certain.
---
I don't think it's been 'confirmed' but I think it's a very safe bet it will be the same, it has a very big impact on character identity/community.
---
Only thing dwarf is better than human at is being a hunter and thats cause humans can't be hunters. lmao
---
I had the same "fear", then 4 years ago I played classic again right until the server in question closed down. It was like the first time all over again. Our young minds knew well.
---
Your BF sounds like *that* person who talks a lot of bs.
---
Tell him you're rolling as horde and for him to deal with it.
---
Phantom legion and sociopath. US smolderthorn.
---
&gt; sometimes people are going to break the rules
---
That's why people try to use rules that cannot be easily broken, like having everyone need on BoEs
---
I had a 19 hunter and 49 warrior.   God those were fun.   I always found it interesting that certain classes were better than others at different levels.   I seem to remember Shamans in the 30-39 bracket were beasts.     I can understand how Blizz didn't like it as the noobs would get crushed, but the way I look at it, I got crushed as a noob, it's just the way it is.     It's also a great "other" thing to do when it's not raid night.   Since it costs a lot of gold, I always thought of it as another kind of 'end game'.
---

Troll 100% looks the best and has the best leveling racials and end game dps racial. Only nubes fall for the orc trap.
---
Yeah, cutting down on his vegan diet should help the situation dramatically.
---
That‚Äôs exactly what I foresee. Pop a pimple and the ooze comes back, but significantly less ooze.
---
I really don‚Äôt want this sub to become r/wow and it‚Äôs really starting to feel like it. Posts on there that are actually discussing the game are in the extreme minority and are drowned out by the low effort memes, art, cosplay and random artsy screenshots with corny titles. 
---
I don‚Äôt want to sound like a salty dikhed but if you feel compelled to make a shitty wow meme take it over there, not here. Almost no one is going to find it funny and you‚Äôre just driving the nerds that come here to talk about the game away.

yeah it was not meant to show of skill or anything else, just fo OP to get a decent picture of the burst numbers of no gear.

Having trouble deciding between mage or rogue. I like the idea of kiting in PvP as I mained a BM hunter in legion but also like the idea of shredding someone within a stun lock. Can a mage kill a rogue within a root lock assuming they don‚Äôt have improved sprint or trinket up? I also enjoy topping the meters but I hear mage and rogue and roughly equal in this regard. Any advice?
---
I don't believe you, but that's funny
---
\*raises hand\*
---
This was only true for PvP servers, it would be awesome if it was re-applied but they haven't said anything about it.
---
niiiiiiice, just ordered one!  Good looking out fam!
---
&gt;Why do you need a mount more than I need a new weapon?
---
He doesn't. It's equal. Which is why everyone should roll equally, IE needing.
---
My man!
---
For now we want to keep the entry bar low and open to all. User views and upvotes will help bring the best content to the top. We'll watch how this acts and looks so that you can get a good user experience from it though. Thanks for the suggestion.
---
We all committed time and effort to a dungeon to get items for our respective classes.  An item clearly intended for my class drops.  Why should you get to claim that I don't need the upgrade because you want some extra gold?
---
Right i see thanks. Yeah you dont have to stress Beserking as a racial my female troll mage was the envy of my peers :D
---
Haha I like it!
---
I‚Äôm having the exact same dilemma. I don‚Äôt care about topping meters as long as I provide some real utility in raids and PvP. I want to get dungeon groups quickly (able to heal or tank), have little additional farming, and have some solo capability. I‚Äôm down to either Ele/Resto or Enh/Resto for shaman, PI/Holy or Shadow for priest and 1/29/21 or 15/31/5 for Druid. 
---
I also need a class that doesn‚Äôt require a shit ton of hot keys to be effective since I don‚Äôt have great mobility with my left hand which makes me feel like shaman may be a bad choice. Druids require a lot of farming to tank effectively and need a metric ton of gear so I‚Äôm on the fence there. Priests seem like the best all around but shadow is tough to pull off without additional farming and they‚Äôre squishy without shadowform. They‚Äôre all limited to one per raid too except maybe PI priests, possibly a couple ele/resto shamans since totems and chain heal are too good.
---
What is?
---
It seems to me the obvious solution is to roll horde so you can get constantly run SFK in your mid 20's.
---
EU ~~Lag~~Doomhammer, &lt;Steadfast&gt;. Moved to Anachronos at some point after.
---
My third epic was easily my best, and rarest. I was randomly invited to a pickup world boss group by a top tier guild (the bosses spawned late at night, and most of their roster was offline, hence the need for ringers). I died about fifteen seconds into the Emeriss (one of the nightmare dragons) and watched in awe as the seasoned pros dropped him with brutal efficiency. I had no idea I'd be allowed to roll on loot, I was just there for the experience. An epic leather headpiece dropped, the \[Circlet of Restless Dreams\]([https://www.wowhead.com/item=20623/circlet-of-restless-dreams](https://www.wowhead.com/item=20623/circlet-of-restless-dreams)), a clear upgrade over my Shadowcraft Hood. Against all odds I rolled my heart out (somewhere in the mid 90s) and won! I was disappointed with how it looked, so I stowed it in my bank. (Check out the link above, it looks just as awful as I remember, like something a level 20 would wear.)
---
Fast forward a few months. My raiding knowledge has expanded exponentially, and I'm min/maxing myself into oblivion. I learned about hit tables, glancing blows, weapon skill, and remembered the random epic helmet I left to rot in my bank. Turns out the Circlet of Restless Dreams is one of the few items in the game with +Dagger skill, and pairs nicely with my Aged Core Leather Gloves to jump me up above 310 skill. My DPS jumped significantly, even though my hat looked stupid. And that's how I stole one of the rarest, best rogue items in the game from a serious progression guild without realizing until months later.
---
would be so nice if you put your photoshopped your face on a orc rogue as a cover!
---
I'm not sure what point you're trying to make here.
---
&gt;If it drops at random in a dungeon, the tailor just found it without having the pay the AH for it.
---
And the other 4 members of the group just found a bunch of gold. It has equivalent value to everyone in the group, so everyone in the group should have an equivalent chance to loot it.
---
&gt;You might as well demand anyone with herb or mining give you a chunk of what they collect because you were there.
---
This isn't similar to BoE drops at all, but I'll humor you with a response. Honestly, I wouldn't be against dividing up herbs/ores at the end of a dungeon run, but there's some problems:
---
* A lot of this stuff just isn't really worth much, so players tend not to care.
---
* Dividing up raw materials is a pain in the ass. You'll have a bunch of different items with different values, and they probably won't evenly divide across all 5 players. So to make this fair, you'll have to calculate the value of all of the resources and then divide that across the group, but the guy(s) with the professions are still at a disadvantage because now they've gotta sell the stuff. It's a logistical nightmare.
---
* There's an argument to be made that the players with the professions are entitled to those items due to the investment they made specifically on leveling those professions. You can't really make a similar argument with BoEs, because presumably all players in the group have made an approximately equal amount of investment into their characters.
---
* The players with the professions already know the market and are familiar with selling and/or using these items, so they probably have slightly more value to them than to other players without the associated professions.
---
In no world is troll a superior choice for warrior. Like yeah play one if you think they look cool but don't lie to yourself that it's numerically better. [Orc is obviously best choice here.](https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Ranking/Default.aspx)
---
&gt;You both joined a dungeon to get gear.
---
A. That's not necessarily or entirely true (could be quests, XP, fun). 
---
B. Okay, let's say that the other dude sells Staff of Jordan and buys Ardent Custodian. He's still "getting gear" with the item from the dungeon.
---
Unlike tauren racial, who scales with base health. Gnome is an overall int % that scales with everything
---
Maybe he was a gnome and is suppressing memories of all the times he was sacrificed to the beast.
---
Completely agree with this.

---
yep spirit bond is just a straight up bad talent. Def not worth 2 pts
---
Once the spell is cast, the way the game works in it just send a spell animation with a specific "projectile" speed that will always hit you/clip through walls.
---
You must break LoS on any ranged spell or attack before the attack/spell is cast.
---
Thank you. You said that very well.
---
Not necessarily. Private servers are free and it‚Äôs a matter of if people are willing to pay $15 a month to play classic long term. A couple of my friends will play the first month or so but aren‚Äôt sure if they want to add a $15 monthly bill for a 15 year old game. The real answer is we don‚Äôt know how popular it will be, but it will most certainly have a big drop off after the first few months.
---
Right, so everyone can go farm those things for gold to buy their BoEs so why should they get precedent when they drop?
---
BoPs sell value is so incredibly low that the equip value far outweighs them which is why people don't roll on them to sell to vendors. It's not excuses, it's logic.
---
In case you didn't notice I wrote an explanation
---
Circle of Might and Blood Brothers (Aerie Peak, EU). Hit me up if by chance you're reading this, old friend.
---
Everyone knew what they were.  They were going for 400g on my server when naxx came out.  There were no 2h fury warriors before 1.8 so no one gave a shit about these til  aq.
---
Can you buy the tokens &amp; not use them? Like stash em?
---
Suck something, should work
---
That is correct. Which is why MP5 was better for Shamans and Paladins (at least thought to be back in the day) as Druids and Priests have talents that allow a portion of their spirit regen to tick no matter what. Paladins and shamans did not have this talent.
---
Find a new boyfriend, preferably Undead.
---
I do this put i take 5/5 IAOTH 3/5 Endurance and don't touch imp pet rez
---
Hah, I replied to another one of OPs comments with pretty much exactly this, and now see you beat me to it by 45 minutes. Well done. I think you nailed it :).
---
What you say is very true, however the vast majority people who could possibly come to realize this or in the private server community and usually don't come to realize this until they've gone through 15 or 20 different Fresh Starts, wondering why they can't find the fun.
---
Those people will still show up for classic. What an enormous number of players who have only ever experienced retail and have never started over from scratch will also be playing classic, it will be their first time playing it, or for those veteran players it will be their first time in 15 years.
---
We don't know what blizzard long-term plan is. But the obvious answer is to follow the model they've already laid out meaning this will not be classic and done, it will move on to each successive expansion. Maybe they will also have a Cycling Classic server that refreshes and wipes every 12 to 15 months.
---
&gt;Nobody "needs" any item anymore than people "need" gold.
---
Well said.
---
Here is my list of keybindings as I remember it:
---
1, 2, 3, 4, (5 and 6 were less used but still bound), E, Q, R (I actually unbound reply so I could have more button real estate), F, Z, X, C, Middle Mouse, mouse wheel down, mouse wheel up, Mouse 4, Mouse 5. This gives 16 buttons which is a shit ton.
---
Though for me that wasn't nearly enough, so I CTRL+ all of those and ALT+ the more easily accessed of those. This is way more than people need but I was a tryhard paladin and I had nearly everything bound because I hate myself.
---
There were times I couldn't strafe and do something but honestly that wasn't a huge deal.
---
And you're still a scrub.
---
Isnt warrior gonna be most played by far?  Probly gonna be lot of tanks
---
It's a point that has been made to him like 5 different ways by 5 different people, but he doesn't seem to want to listen to it.
---
I had a few twinks back then. I had a 19 Hunter, 19 Priest, and 49 Warrior. I very much enjoyed each of them, and I plan to get back into it at some point during Classic.
---
you have alot of trust in people. In a PUG I have no obligation to those people, they aren't in my progression or someone I will associate with often. Like others I've been burned before.  I helped get that loot, I deserve a chance of that loot. Regardless if he's going to use it. BOE's are free game, always have been.
---
1, 2, 3, 4, (5 and 6 were less used but still bound), E, Q, R (I actually unbound reply so I could have more button real estate), F, Z, X, C, Middle Mouse, mouse wheel down, mouse wheel up, Mouse 4, Mouse 5.

Though for me that wasn't nearly enough, so I did CTRL+ all of those and ALT+ the more easily accessed of those. This is way more than people need but I was a tryhard paladin and I had nearly everything bound because I hate myself.
---
Did you know Neurotik? I still listen to the music he made for his boss fight videos!
---
Real vanilla had new population trickle in steadily and noobs provide experiences and niche items to economy. You want noobs/casuals to play you're game if you want to re-experience real vanilla.
---
Yet with only sharding in 1-10 zones for the first week we will see a huge bottleneck of people unable to quest past level 12 if they're not the 10% of people ahead of the leveling pack. Having sharding in 10-20 zones is a good idea for the long term health. Not even up for debate, I'd bet money on it.
---
I'm not worried about the 20+ zones being crowded because the encourages PvP and people at that point could do dungeons to level. So people stuck at 20 wont result in quitting, people stuck at 10-13 more likely to kill the hype of first week.

As a healer in a group you will want to be mindful of the 5 second rule at the beginning and end of pulls.
---
 * If you pop a heal or a HoT on the tank as soon as he pulls then you will stop regen at that moment. You want to keep that regen going for as long a you can into the fight, so delay any heals or casts as long as you can (without undue risk of course).
---
 * It is also important if you find yourself OOM in the middle of a fight. If you cast another heal as soon as you have the mana for it then you will be OOM again and need to wait 5 seconds before regen begins. If you can wait to cast then you will end up with more mana over the same period of time.
---
 * It is important to be mindful of non-essential spell casting during regen as well. Imagine you just finished a pull and everyone is running to the next area. You might think it is a good time to renew buffs, but that will interrupt your regen and you will have less mana than if you waited until the next pull.
---
 * Wands are incredibly valuable for the reason that they do not interrupt regen. If you're in a situation where you do not need to heal and you want to contribute some damage then Wanding is an excellent choice. If you choose to cast a spell instead then not only are you using mana but you are interrupting regen as well.
---
I used a razer naga when it came out. Never really ended up binding more than two or three of those buttons to anything. I found simply using ESDF over WASD allowed for enough additional hotkeys to not really need 18 mouse buttons.
---
holy shit, i did the exact same thing lol
---
Hardly! I know this game will be as addicting as it was when I was 16, so I want my crack when the weather gets crappy XD
---
Damn we need a new season brother
---
There's is no reason to be playing musical chairs with positions like that. If the fury warrior is going to be tank #2 for hakkar they should just be tank #2 for the whole instance. You don't need 3 tanks for anything other than maybe tiger if your tanks are bad.
---
Definitely not just happenstances. The average Brazilian actually tend to be somewhat xenophobic towards foreigners, what we refer to as "gringos". They , in general, think less of them and take the party less seriously if the majority of the teammates are gringos.
---
In regards to "just plain terrible at the game bit", it's generally because we have a massive community. Brazil is huge market and there's lots of poorly educated people with internet access that really don't care to put in the minimal work to at least get the fundamentals right on how to play the game. The attitude is like "lol who cares just press shit and have fun". But, we also have tons of very top quality raiders, which you often don't notice because they usually speak english just fine and are competent at their class.
---
&gt;only warriors can really tank
---
Not really. Only warriors can be MT. Only warriors can fulfill all tank jobs. Only warriors can really tank.
---
I had a lot of old guilds in 2004-2006. The only guild I can remember is one I wasn't in, but ran with. The super-pug lead by &lt;Late Night Elites&gt;.
---
As someone who has done every role in this game, I can tell you that there is basically zero carryover between any of them. DPS and tanking and healing are all completely different. You get good at what you do.
---
The only thing that separates someone who knows how to tank and someone who doesn't know how to tank is repetition. If you have a hybrid Druid who regularly tanks 5 mans, then you should feel more comfortable asking him to tank in a 20-man or 40-man raid than the Warrior who types "LF1M Strat Live need tank" in world chat.
---
Do you have a google docs link? I'm planning to levle a priest
---
I don't think the OP understands the fungible nature of money in an open economy.  
---
If a BoE drops, that's a potential BoE for EVERYONE in the group; it's just that some classes will have to process it through the AH first - sell that BoE gun to buy a BoE wand, for example. Arbitrarily deciding for everyone that a drop belongs to someone by default because they could - theoretically - use it to increase their stats *without* first visiting a market, is just that - arbitrary. OP is basically saying "This item is yours at the expense of everyone else, because it's an upgrade that doesn't require a trip to the AH. While everyone else here could ALSO use this item to increase their stats, they'd have to carry it to a faction hub first, which is just unthinkable."  
---
On a macro scale, OP's method is also less healthy for the server-wide economy. The more of these items that make it to the AH, the more affordable they will be. The people with the means and desire will acquire them, and the sellers will convert the gold into something of far more value to them, personally. Basically, it keeps the gold flowing, which is good for everyone.
---
You need to start making exams and posting them on here for people to complete, I think it would be a big hit in this community if it was all website based. 
---
Sample:
---
At what level can a Rogue learn Instant Poison III?
---
a) 32
---
b) 34
---
c) 36
---
d) 18
---
Do you remember Soul of the Fire or Core of Insight? Shadowsong vanilla player here too
---
whole guild of 50+ ppl going to classic wow only to twink on 39s bracket so hopefully see you there! 39 is end game for us &lt;3 let the raids (≈ôman dung coughcough for BiS begin)
---
As mentioned before, I showed up to get gear for my class, same as everyone else.  I don't roll on gear for warriors if I am a mage.  Claiming that you should be able to sell a BoE cloth item when you wear leather or plate is no different than saying a BoP cloth item should be yours because it can be vendored toward your mount.  You're taking a convenient excuse to grab something extra at someone else's expense.
---
Imagine intentionally gimping yourself in a 15-year-old videogame so you can feel like you look cool. No one fucking cares what you look like. What they do like is being able to complete the content without hassle, which people like you cause.
---
In the early days of raiding I assure you most people didn't know too much about how weaponskill mattered, especially compared to str/agi/ap/crit/hit.  I raided as a resto druid so all I cared about was intellect, spirit, and healing power.
---
No! :o 
---
I've never touched anything to do with classic until now! Why would I be here to troll?
---
Why not? Guidls on private servers are bragging about how fast they can clear dungeons in their recruitment posts. Why would they NOT do something that helps them clear even faster? It's not like the Druid and Warrior are competing for gear.
---
Why should you get to save an equal amount of gold simply because you can use the item?
---
The item represents literally the exact same value to both players. I can sell it for 100g, you can buy it for 100g. If either of us wins the roll we have gained 100g. If you lose the roll and want the item still, you are free to buy it. If I lose the roll and still would like 100g, I am free to farm for it.
---
The time before ilvl.
---
thats the same as fresh 60 vs r13 or raid geared...
---
actually 39 can get 10v10 twinks with more more competitive spirit in short time and effort for everyone
---
Whats difficult to max out on them?  I played a Rogue classic-BFA but I was 100% shit in vanilla.
---
As far as I can tell the basic gist is ss/bs to 5 combos, snd, ss/bs to 5 combos, evis if possible, etc etc
---
That's ignoring cooldown usage though.
---
It‚Äôs true, but that‚Äôs okay.
---
Nice name. Maybe im going to create a toon named Kal on every. single. server. u know. just to be sure.
---
just kidding ofc! :)
---
Scales with everything, which is still close to nothing.
---
Yeet!
---
First of all, private server so may not translate to classic 100%.
---
Secondly I don't see a single troll warrior in those graphs so obviously everyone fell for the nube trap of orc.
---
Two different points too, and he doesn't want to listen to either of them. He's so deluded that he appears to actually think the ONLY reason people do dungeons is gear. Despite plenty of us telling him we do dungeons for different reasons. Because he does dungeons for gear, he assumes that's the case for everyone. (I'm not straw manning him, every time that someone says they do dungeons for multiple reasons he doubles down on the idea that it's only for gear, ever.)
---
You've oversimplified it. His comment was in reference to having "God gear to be average"  
---
My response was basically pointing out that even in "God gear" he will be limited by vanilla's in-game mechanics for threat.
---
Now, I get your point about spell damage, however, consider how spell damage ignores armor. Also, consider how melee DPS draws more threat. So even if a paladin focuses on using spells vs. physical abilities to do more damage, they would still be making more threat than other spell damage classes because they are a melee class.  
---
We all know Paladins have extremely bursty DPS - even without reck bombs (since you're not supposed to be taking damage/getting hit). However, without any mechanism available in their talent tree to reduce the threat they generate (like every other DPS class has) they have to further minimize their damage done in order to not pull aggro. You say every other class has this problem, but if a mage reduces threat by spec'ing for 30% reduced threat, that's basically 30% more damage he can do than the Paladin.  
---
I've seen pallies sit right under the top threat meters in vanilla, barely hanging under the tanks, helplessly watching everyone else out-dps them. I remember because my friend who was VERY good at the class, was always frustrated because Blizzard merely responded to Paladin frustrations with ret by saying that their bubble was their "threat mitigation" - which infuriated the Paladin fans, because their bubble does not remove their threat table, meaning it simply buys a few seconds for tanks to taunt a mob back. And they couldn't improve the damage they do, because they would've become imbalanced in PvP.  
---
So, again. Threat will always limit a Paladin, more-so than any other class. You may think otherwise, but I promise you, you could play a Paladin and a Fury warrior side by side in vanilla - and even the Fury warrior would never pull as much aggro, while doing more damage than a similarly geared Paladin would, because he would essentially be stuck on auto-attack the entire fight.
---
You'll just have to have rewarding, challenging gameplay in retail...............................................*punchline*
---
This always existed.
---
From the default WASD position with pinky on shift, I just move the pinky down to CTRL. I use middle finger for 1-3 and index finger for 4-6
---
üòÅ
---
We are starting everything with 1.12, and 16 debuffs already.  Thats a huge change. It changes the balance at launch. It affects literally everyone.  
---
But you want to change something that only affects the smallest population of pvpers? I hate pvp, but its not an exploit, its how the game worked. The average human reaction time to visual stimuli is 0.25sec, outside of your time frame of your server tick. The only way to use it is to predict when and what your opponent is going to do, which is what any good pvper worth their salt will do.
---
This game wasn't perfect, and that was fucking great! It didn't cater to floor tanks.
---
Hiding behind objects to break line-of-sight existed in Vanilla. Although not all objects will break LoS. In general if the object is part of the terrain then it will not break LoS, but if it is a standalone object like a house, or a wagon, then it will. Although there are many inconsistencies throughout the game, so you will have to find out for yourself what objects do and do not break LoS.
---
I found the huntard!  
---
"I should get all the BoE's which I can convince people I'll use!" lol. And he's so certain he has the moral high ground, too! Adorbz
---
I remember when I got my first Naga and it came with a little booklet that gave helpful exercises for learning the buttons, and it had little tactile stickers that you could attach to help learn where the buttons were. It also said that it took on average about 20 hours of use for people to become accustomed to it.
---
After that, it's all muscle memory. I can't go back :)
---
You can easily pirate movies, games, music, software, etc and yet most people still chose to buy all those things.
---
I will gladly pay for a sub just so I dont have to deal with all the pserver issues like bugs, gold sellers, high latency, server crashes, over/under populated servers, lack of moderation and so on and so forth.
---
Vanilla or pserver?
---
I remember that tag and Knuckleheads from back in the day. I ran with Infuriate on Hakkar (Horde side).
---
I believe it got picked up for season 7 so all in good time.
---
I wholeheartedly applaud your idea of Warcraft fun
---
I'm really not. You keep making that BoP claim and it is just you being willfully ignorant. BoP items both vendor for such a low amount and cannot be gotten in any other manner other than running the dungeon.
---
BoE items (at least the ones we are discussing) sell for a lot of gold and can also be bought for *that same amount of fucking gold*. They are not even close to the same thing. The one who is making an excuse is you because BoP items happen to be vendorable. 
---
If you want this piece of cloth gear and you lost the roll you can buy it for the exact amount I can sell it for. The value is equal. If you want this BoP item then this is the only way you can get it and I can sell it for much less than that value to you. The values are not equal.
---
Thank you for explanation! :) 
---
I must admit I was scared to post in this sub because a lot of vanilla players seem to be a bit elitist, no tea btw! 
---
Do you need to level up for example wands and staffs if you play a clothie? Or is it only weapons? 
---
Omg! Haha, I should have been a bit more detailed about my dungeon ask! I know you can walk to dungeons but I have heard that you needs keys and others have said you need quests to go in first! So I was just wondering about that :)
---
Ambassadors of Truth on EU Dragonblight. We moved lock stock from EQ, me a little later after a brief flirtation with EQ2 and some time to get over WoW's joke graphics. Created a Horde lock only to find the guild had gone Alliance, and the name... Sheesh. I'd already been raiding 2-3 nights a week for some time so came pretty much burned out and only really made MC before going casual until TBC. AoT still going on retail Dragonblight, hoping to see some of them in Classic!
---
I can't decide between orc warlock or undead mage and it's killing me
---
i prefer Night lets just say this was a smooth launch and we can play right off the get go. i would want to play for 2-3 hours or longer to get to like level 10... get some rest let people separate a bit then wake up all Gitty and excited to grind all day
---
skullflame shield in stratholme living for my warrior :3
---
...and this is why you don't leave rogues alive. I honestly believe they feel insulted if you don't try to kill them. If you try and they escape, they seek revenge. If you succeed they seek revenge. If you help them, they will kill you for thinking they needed help.  
---
There is no winning unless you hunt them down and kill them mercilessly regardless of level difference. At max level, if I see a PvP flagged lvl 1 rogue, I will kill it. If I am killed by a max level rogue, I will hunt him down and return the favor. At some point, some way, some how, I WILL KILL THEM ALL. Because they will do the same to me.
---
&lt;Masters of Mithril&gt; on Perenolde
---
That's wrong, tons of dagger rogues in mc and bwl were at ~+15 daggers
---
My argument hasn't changed and your logic doesn't help.  The tailor found a tailor drop just as a warrior might find a warrior drop.  If you invested time in mining, then you have the sole benefit of being able to  gather ore.  If I'm not a miner, I have no expectation of adding ore to my loot just because I happened to be there.
---
It‚Äôs really not a big deal. WoW is not a FPS. Most people won‚Äôt even notice spell batching.
---
Sargeras EU
---
&gt;Recipes should be the same as anything else.  If a tailor plan drops, tailors get to roll need.
---
Lol... All I can say to that is good luck with that buddy. Hope that works out for you.
---
How an earth would a guild break up over a BoP unique mount? Why would anyone ever expect someone else not to roll for it?
---
That‚Äôs odd my guild cleared AQ and and a couple wings of Naxx and we never had full raid flasks.
---
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you bring that evil on me Ricky-Bobby!‚Äù
---
I don‚Äôt know how long have you been away from retail WoW, but that‚Äôs not how it is in retail - timezone =\= location when it comes to servers.
---
Granted, it MAY mean that for Classic servers when they make them, but I don‚Äôt want to take chances, otherwise I‚Äôd just roll with what server the game suggests and hope they suggest them based on your ping.
---
Yes you will and I will as well. But you‚Äôd be surprised how many people struggle to make ends meet. Also a fairly large percent of the private servers are international players who simply can‚Äôt afford $15 a month for a video game.
---
Sounds to me like you don‚Äôt care about racials. If that‚Äôs the case then just go for aesthetics.
---
It's obviously a hunter weapon
---
&gt;Seems like a raw deal for a priest.
---
Not really. The priest can just buy them off the AH same as anyone else.
---
Lol ya weirdo
---
A lot of people have fun being a completionist. I am one of those people. I do not 6 hours a day to dedicate to the game, so I have to make the time I have count if I want to get to where I want to be.
---
Put the spells you use regularly on the keyboard. Spamming is rough on your thumb. Utility spells like interrupts, stuns, and cooldowns are great candidates for mouse thumb buttons; the type of spells you don't use often, but want to have fast access to when you need them.
---
I also have my mount button on there, too! And with the alt key, you can put 24 utility things on your mouse... You might be surprised how fast they get used up. Cooldowns, buffs, mounts, potions, health stones, drinks, sprints...
---
I would assume it depends on the addon makers and if we have a beta or not.  Someone needs to actually make them so if someone makes them before the final version comes out then we should have some addons day 1 otherwise we are waiting for them to be made or adapted from current addons.
---
The value is only the same if you claim that the item is only worth money.  If the item grants a decent stat boost to one player, how do you compare that vs the other 4 players who happened to be there when a rare item dropped?
---
Can this ever happen? I would love to see this.
---
I'm pretty sure if they don't include 1.5 or 1.7 AV, private servers will still live on. Actuelly, I do hope so, to show Blizzard they fucked up even the re-release of an old game...  
---
They are supposed to deliver a "museum piece" of all the best parts of Vanilla within a static patch. All being 1.12 is just... 1.12, not that so called museum piece. I already played that on private servers, I have close to no inerest doing it again without OG AV :(

I'd guess they would need to be updated since it's using a modern client. Unless they somehow redo the old add-on API. I doubt something like Decurse will work like it used to.
---
It's been painful. I normally ignore posts like this, but I'm avoiding working, so here we are.
---
If you hug a girl for more than 5 seconds you will get a boner.
---
There's...something on the wing...
---
Some...thing...
---
I mean, I laid out the logic that already refutes your response. If you want to ignore that then that's your prerogative but you're never going to get anywhere in a constructive discussion.
---
I'll make one more attempt to point out how your position is dubious.
---
&gt;Players are free to go farm gold through crafting, gathering, farming mobs, or buying/reselling on the AH
---
This is totally irrelevant. Just because someone can get a similar opportunity elsewhere doesn't mean they should have to forfeit that opportunity in a situation that you've arbitrarily chosen.
---
&gt; You cannot draw a line logically between BoE vs BoP items beyond claiming that one is worth more therefore, I should get a cut.
---
That's not what I said at all. I said if the item has equal value to all members of the group, then all members of the group should have an equal chance of acquiring said item. This is *always* the case with BoE items for the reason I clearly explained above. (Well, there is an exception for items that are so rare that they're rarely on the AH and you could ascribe a value to "finding" the item but this is so fringe it's not worth discussing in the context of this thread.)
---
BoP items do *not* have equivalent value for all members of the party like BoE items do. This is why they should be treated differently. If, for example, Hands of the Exalted Herald were a random BoE then they'd probably be worth at least 100 gold. But their vendor value is 1 gold. Those values aren't equivalent.
---
Finally, let me try one more time to put this into context: Let's say you and a friend find a $20 bill. Your friend says, "Let's flip a coin and the winner gets to keep the $20." But you say, "No, I deserve this $20 because my rent is due tomorrow and I need it more." You both get equal value from the 20 dollars, but you are creating an arbitrary reason for why you think you deserve it more than your friend instead of allowing it to be distributed randomly.
---
This is why you are arguing from the position of greed and entitlement.
---
I like to believe that at the time itll just come to me
---
Without Dire maul, Dalrends ARE hunter pre raid BIS unless you're willing to pay out of the ass for world drops.  
---
  Issue being, fresh server means these drops are gonna be quite rare and there's less overall gold if it does drops, for everyone.
---
July 16th is likely too.
---
F keys are bad but modifiers are even worse. 
---
You want to have it on things like F, G E, R. Or on your mouse buttons and scroll wheel.
---
Since that player can buy that exact item for the same amount anyone else can sell it for, the comparison is easy. They aren't missing out on the stats, just the gold.
---
I ran https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-talents/druid-talents/?tal=01000000000000001552521003000140555203000010000 for the record
---
definitely not saying that it was optimal, but it's what i ran.  A compromise between pvp and pve.
---
I was also ending fights with over 30% mana.  Game has evolved a lot since then and I've got some parses to show for it =P
---
Bleeding Hollow was my original server. My first serious guild was Nightguard Elite. Great guild and a great group of people, but infighting between the upper end of people broke it up. Afterward I found myself in Fignuts and found some lifelong friends.
---
SS/BS to 1-3  comb. depending on mob difficulty and how long youll need snd. this varies if you can chain mobs then 5 comb points for long buff. then 5 comb to evis. your almost right. just depends on how long youl need snd. youll level swords. slower sword on MH. faster in OH. Instant poison. etc. Its not difficult after level 20. 1-20 is rough solo. You get some nice utility and talents 20+ tho. Just Keep food and bandages on you and alternate them between pulls.
---
Gotta use up that rested xp. Play your alts for a few hours every 10 days so they are not sitting at the rested cap!
---
Send me a copy, please.
---
Just... just save it as a digital document.
---
And you'd be suprised how many people want to play vanilla but refuse to use pservers for various reasons, such security risks, legality issues, lag, etc, etc.
---
I'm willing to bet that these people outnumber those who play on pservers due to them being free.
---
As far as raids go you usually have a Shaman in every group, so I would not say Priests are more sought after.
---
Dang that actually sounds casual to me... TIL I‚Äôm hardcore
---
Correct, it was changed to the end of the cast in 1.4.
---
"Mana regeneration is now disrupted when a spell has completed casting rather than at the start of casting. It will resume normally five seconds after the last spell cast. This change increases the total time spent regenerating mana and therefore increases the total contribution from Spirit for mana-based classes."
---
The warrior bash is real. Omg... You all are doomed to find a tank in classic...
---
^(Thunderfury Rogue gets me going)
---
If your best examples of ret pallies are dudes that literally get fed gear by 39 other people for entire tiers and still fail to top the meters...
---
/startattack macro for any melee is a must have. 
---
/Stopcastng macro for casters is also important.
---
Most will go Fury DPS.
---
Akama? I was in Onslaught until I burned out at level 58 like a doofus
---
If you dont think stoneform is the best racial the alliance has for pvp then I‚Äôm not sure what to say. There‚Äôs no other race better suited for pvp than dwarves strictly speaking from a min/max viewpoint. Any class a dwarf can play will be the best combo for pvp. There‚Äôs nothing that will push stoneform from first place for pvp racials for the alliance.  If you want to focus on pvp and the class you want to play can be a dwarf than be a dwarf. That being said, the stoneform racial is the best for pvp but it‚Äôs not essential. If you hate dwarves than be what you want, you‚Äôll still find success in whatever it is you want to do.
---
People slam on trolls because they don't like the open toes, or look of them. They underestimated, great for dps, especially rogues and warriors.
---
I refuse to comment on this topic. No matter what my stance is I get down voted I to the dark abyss. Please dont down vote me for not speaking  :(
---
I don't think so on account of the community would literally crucify and probably not play it. Tokens are cancer.
---
Didn't the LoS functionality get improved over the years since vanilla? If so, I wonder they will keep that improvement for classic - im also curious if warriors will, once again, be able to charge uphill. For example [charge up the graveyard in WSG](https://youtu.be/1qHsxM4lz2E?t=55)
---
yeah. lack of global cooldown having to wait 5 sec to even do anything would suck vs more than 3 mobs
---
undead strictly for looks, orc casters always looked bad imo.
---
Very long. Early on it‚Äôs 25-30 seconds but after AQ gear it‚Äôs 40+ seconds. 
---
Classes like Shadow Priest and Elemental Shaman will spend a lot of time drinking.
---
I definitely remember sneaking raptor strikes in to my rotation when able. It didn't work on bosses where you really needed to be at max range, of course, but when you could, it was pretty good. It was only really worth it with a 2her, though. It worked in BC, too.
---
I think even if we get a stress test beta and that's it, a lot of addons builders will be in it and have them ready to go by the time launch comes around. Worst case scenario some dont get updated for a few days.
---
Healing in pvp is like tanking in pve
---
But weren't tokens added partly to deal with gold sellers?  Without them, won't they just be incentivized to do again (if private servers are any indication)?
---
i encourage you to watch the video find of the community that is backing up everything I've stated. Not that it is anything new. It's just not something a lot of people knew about
---
Stage 1-6.  
---
No 0
---
It's like healing in pve, but you also play the role of the tank
---
As well as the boomerang trinket which IIRC was a pallies only reliable ranged attack outside of engineering
---
Yeah that is actually why I posted what I did.  When I opened the thread and saw no one mentioning that, I actually panicked for a second b/c I've just swapped in a few MP5 pieces on my pally (pserv) and was like...oh shit did I mis-remember something.  Double checked it on a few sites rq before posting.
---
&gt; In the last pserver my retail friends quit at level 8-10.
---
Damn, level 10 is just when it starts getting good.
---
Ahh ok yeah so this is what I was talking about, after the spell has already been cast. So you must break LoS prior to the spell being cast or it will hit you pretty much no matter what. It would make sense to me that you could hide once the projectile is chasing you though
---
DABU
---
You can still log on retail a couple of times a month to pay for your sub if you‚Äôre so inclined üòã
---
This. The amount of times I was told that I had low priority rolls on one handled/two handed weapons as it was just a "stat stick" but I had to roll with warriors and rogues for bows and guns.
---
I went over this before in my first post.
---
The amount of money you can sell the item for is the same as the amount of money you can buy the item for. They're equivalent. This is why the item has equivalent value to all 5 members of the group. That's what the whole 40g Priest boots example was explaining.
---
It's the same reason that a $20 bill has the same value for you or your friend. It doesn't matter if you're going to use it to pay your rent or your friend is going to use it to buy a new shirt, it has equivalent value to both of you. It also doesn't matter if you replace that $20 bill with a shirt that's worth $20; you could sell the shirt and use the $20 to pay your rent, or your friend could keep the shirt. It's all equal value.
---
Nonononono, not in million years.
---
Bone slicing hatchet is 13 agi each. That's 26 for a set = 0.47% and 54 AP.
---
Dalrends gives 1 crit and 50 AP. So about half a crit better.  So you saying 4 AP &gt; ¬Ω crit?
---
Coming from someone who can't make any sense or have any logic when speaking of the topic at hand.Fuck outta here with your stupid ass
---
Ok that‚Äôs interesting. Another comment pointed out that LoS must be broken prior to the spell being cast and this doesn‚Äôt work once the projectile is already coming after you
---
Moonkins do very high dps I don't know what your talking about.
---
So I ask for a friend mage who farms DM N and E :)
---
There are sell sellers in retail. It was just a move by blizzard to get a piece of that revenue pie. Allowing players to buy gold in classic would massive screw up the world. Epic mount for everyone no need to grind for it. Unlimited spec changes because it only costs gold so who cares. Want to be epic geared? Just buy it off the AH.
---
It is a lot. Especially with PI can out burst mages.
---
Iirc, DM is stage 2
---
Lol it's like over 1k and I can't justify spending that on a game that's been out for 13 years lol
---
What are the different sections?
---
He's right though... No one in my 2005/2006 raids even used flasks or world buffs until Naxx.  
---
Mages and warlocks frequently competed for top dps in MC/BWL, after the rogues.
---
ROFL... Keep projecting you autistic incel.
---
And only dumbasses choose something thats not given as a choice.
---
Honestly I don't want hunters to get anything.
---
Bro I been ready for over ten years at this point.
---
Cancel casting is what puts you in the 5 second rule.
---
Dal'rends is still a bit better. Dal'rends gives you 50 AP and 1% crit, whereas dual BSH will give you (26*1.1 = 28.6agi) 57.2 AP and .54% crit
---
.46% crit is worth more than 7.2ap
---
You have to use a command to set it. Maybe thet forgot.
---
My first guild was Hard Rock Zombies - Magtheridon.  Small guild made up of a bunch of local people I met the leader at gamestop when he asked what server i played on. He talked me into switching and going horde. I was on that server until a few months ago.
---
It would stifle illegal gold selling by legitimizing it. It would create a waaay bigger problem by having people paying to win be commonplace. The wow token works on retail because gold is almost exclusively for cosmetics now, the same cannot  be said for classic.
---
Dope game proper. I‚Äôll be rolling human paladin. Let‚Äôs get it. Good little trio
---
Oooooh, I'm back with the news.. so they split the 4 stages into 6 phases. Found an article. Ok. Thank you very much. Case closed.
---
As in you try to heal your teammates while everyone is attacking you?
---
Oh I have no doubt that classic wow will be way larger than any private server out there, I was just trying to point out that using private servers to predict classic wow‚Äôs success is misleading.
---
Yes to leveling up wands and staffs.  And don't worry about keys.  It's mostly late game dungeons/raids and when you're gathering up quests or researching the dungeon you'll learn how to get your key.
---
Man who plays ally anyhow?
---
Lets do the math:
---
2x boner slicers = 26 Agi unbuffed, = 28.6 agi buffed(assuming no Zg because who wears dalrends with ZG out). That's 57.2 AP and 0.52 crit. Lets say 57AP and 0.5 crit. Dalrends is 1crit + 50 AP. 
---
So the question is, what's better 14 AP or 1 crit. From what I can dig up usually 1crit is better but if you got some sims or something to show up fully buffed what AP to crit ratio would be I'd be glad to see it.
---
No, you should continue to start your healing spell, if you determine the spell isnt needed, cancel it before it completes. I usually strafed or jumped a quarter second before the spell completed. 
---
 This prevents overheating and gets you regeneration ticks.
---
aaaaa can't decide between druid or hunter
---
_do I want to have a kitty or BE the kitty_
---
Both seem to be very fast levelers, but how good are bears at soloing elites compared to hunters? 
---
Endgame wise, hunters seem to have the most interesting dps rotation, but healing seems fun too.
---
And of course, having an extra bag slot would be welcome, but so would being able to hold my own in STV
---
Yes, and your teammates dont do anything to help you
---
I bought my wife a pc and got her into wow and we have death workout routines.
---
ok
---
He was the punting target for the beast on pull.
---
Most likely. It also adds a minimal amount of dps by itself as you are using melee swings / on the next melee hit skills so your GCD is free. But if you don't have the mana conservation for it I would not advise to do it - or to go for Rank1 spells instead. (same goes btw for raptor strike, the 15 mana every 10 seconds is definitely worth the guarantee that one swing can't be a glancing blow)
---
I really enjoyed pally healing in Wintergrasp. Mostly because I wanted to participate but suck at pvp.
---
Hates leveling and grinding you say? I‚Äôd suggest you play whatever the hell you want. Your boyfriend might not even make it to 60. Seems to me he likes the conveniences of retail so you could always play with him there.
---
You can arcane power trinket pom pyro fireblast kill any class at 60 if crits.  A very good mage kills rogue 80% of the time.
---
This rule isnt very important in end game raiding. As long as you have Major Mana Pots and Demonic/Dark runes (not even necessary unless your boss kills are taking a TON of time) then you should be absolutely fine on mana as a healer.
---
Any opponent with half a brain will understand that you are the most important person to kill. If you're not getting focused you've already won the fight. This is why paladins are the best pvp healer. They are just harder to kill.
---
Feral druids don't really scale at all, so they're not the worst per se. Even if hunters don't scale well at least one is always needed through content, and they're beasts in pvp, even in close quarter 1v1's with proper use of grenades, cloaking device, rocket helm etc.
---
You, take my upvote.
---
OP, take my downvote.
---
Up to 10, I believe.
---
They both seem pretty fun in pvp, though alliance locks seem annoying as hell in solo pvp due to wotf. I'd go mage just because soul shards are too annoying to manage.
---
1. Join a guild
---
2. Be consistent / show up
---
3. ???
---
4. Profit
---
Just another comment recommending orc here. They just look so badass.
---
I think the misconception you have is that the game will run at a 2.5hz tickrate, which isn't really what's going on, I mean wow doesn't even use a tickrate in the sense a game like CSGO does.
---
Even with spell batching, the spell casting itself doesn't have any delay either, it's just the spells *effect* that does, so things still feel responsive and not laggy, most people didn't even notice spell batching was a thing all the way up to WOD, at which point it was effectively removed.
---
You're not really doing yourself justice by refusing to let him play human, that's HIS character, not yours.
---
But it sounds to be that you're both just as bad as each other and no matter what you do someone will be unhappy.
---
I don't have a solution for you, but some counseling could help lol. Or maybe smoke a fat blunt and try to talk things out.
---
aww good dad
---
I think it's rather interesting that people keep saying this. It feels like people have never been in dungeons with...
---
Warriors, Paladins, Shamans, Druids
---
wotf is better for melee anyway.
---
Yes yes yes to Defias Brotherhood and Duskwood. They are quest lines that actually feel ‚Äúepic‚Äù. Like you need to exhale and go ‚ÄúWoah.‚Äù when you‚Äôre done.
---
"Yo Rogue, do you need that belt?"
---
"Hang on let me look at my notes..."
---
*furious paper rustling*
---
If you want to have any kind of life at all. PVP gear is not a good way to get gear. Raiding is much better for people hard on time. Especially if you have a good guild pre AQ40.
---
Yup it's how I treat trolls, as should everyone. You're not welcome to hang around, that's for sure.
---
and I cannot emphasize this enough
---
changes
---
Orcs are better in pvp and pve. Basically if you want superior numbers above all else and the class you can play is available to orc you go orc.
---
Hi, I know this is super late so idk if you'll even see this, but why do you recommend starting solo until level 5-6? For an example, I plan on leveling with my brother in the orc starting zone and there is quests like kill 10 boars, kill 12 vile familiars, that would go faster in a group especially considering how crowded it will be.
---
I wonder if it's because I default my fingers on Q W E.
---
Whuuuuuut?? xD
---
I don't recall any specific changes, but I remember being able to shoot fireballs through hills and the like during the AQ era.
---
That‚Äôs how I feel about Horde
---
The premise behind it?
---
I don't think they'll put tokens in classic. The way they have it set up now indirectly pushes people to play retail if they want free game time, and blizzard still wants people to play retail. That's why they made the subscription cover both retail and classic.
---
Oh man we gotta get the band back together!
---
You think the boyfriend is the only one being a diva? 
---
&gt; I honestly always thoght it's a really nice gesture to offer him to swtich FACTIONS in exchange of forbitting him a single race.
---
That sounds to me like "Fine! I'll let you play the faction you want to as long as you don't play the race you want to!" Why can't OP play a dwarf and let BF play a human?
---
Illumination (I think called?) is one HELL of a talent.
---
Not really qol but I would love rated bgs and harder raids
---
This isn't 2005/2006 though and most people aren't willing to go through 4 months of BWL progression. Most of the guilds will be gathering world buffs before raids
---
I‚Äôve levelled three hunters with this.
---
Imo. Cheetah isn‚Äôt noticeable enough to me and it‚Äôs two points not improving you or your pet.
---
Focus regen talent is not garbage. Assists my cat (preferred pet) with being able to claw and bite without focus starve. 
---
No mage can 100-0 a hunter during the levelling phase especially post 40. You destroy everything until 60.  Points better spent in revive pet. 
---
1 point in hawk procs it on average once every couple of fights. It‚Äôs a filler point regardless and not an amazing talent pre 60 anyway because your pet is your damage.
---
I've had fun healing as shaman and druid in vanilla and BC. Also heard priest can be pretty fun. But I haven't heard a whole lot of positives about pallys. I've heard they're really good but boring, but maybe somebody who has actually played them can correct me.
---
I'm not sure what to say for the first part.  At no point have I claimed to be an authority, nor have i put up anything other than my opinion, because ultimately, I'm some guy on the internet.  In any event, sparking a good conversation on the topic is what I was hoping for.  
---
The reason I claim mounts to be a luxury is that they are a measure of efficiency above all else.  Having a mount gets your around quicker, contributing mainly to farming, gathering, and traveling.  An equipment upgrade on the other hand directly contributes towards your survivability.  A boost in stats buffs your ability to quest or PvP more efficiently.  The two are difficult to compare because they aren't equal, yet many people are comparing them as if they are exactly the same.  One player sees a drop and thinks "Finally, I've wanted a new weapon since 10 levels ago."  Another sees the same drop and thinks "Oh good, I can start saving for my epic mount early."  The mount may last longer, but each person also has the option to decide how much of a priority that is.  Do I spend on professions or go double gathering and auction everything I can?  
---
On the second part, I generalized most of that based off comments in the first post.  Many people commented that a player should either roll with everyone else, or pay a share of the AH value to each party member in exchange for taking the item.  Multiple people commented that using a BoE was a waste because of it's AH value.  So, in that regard, everything I paraphrased has already been posted.  
---
As for the final part, that's perfectly fair.  I don't think every group should have to follow the same rules, so long as everyone involved agrees.
---
Warlock tier sets look absolutely insane on an orc male.
---
Just smoothes out the feel of the D-Pad.
---
That is like the 20th revision of the original Belkin Nostromo. It's design has been around for a loooooong time and is super popular for a reason.
---
I mean, you can dedicate 3 fingers for movement and action keys and a thumb to just jump but I'd rather dedicate a thumb to an 8-way directional pad for movement to free up all 4 fingers for ability activation so I don't get caught up playing finger yoga while trying to move and do stuff at the same time.
---
The Logitech G13 is another contender but that's not in production.

Beauty is in the eye of the [wow item] holder.

Damn. You put as much into this WoW binder as I did into my college thesis.

An enhancement shaman can totem twist, which isn't something you're going to see a healer doing. I don't know if that's more helpful that the ot warrior on nightfall duty, though.

a little late to this, do you still think pickpocketing is the way to go? ive heard different concerns about vanilla copper/silver amounts being lower to the point its not worth it, and that pservers were always just higher.  ive tried to find videos from 2004-2007 of any rogue pick pocketing a mob lvl 50+, or any SM farms for proof to compare amounts, but i cant find anything.
---
&lt;Buy BitCoin in 2009&gt; on Archimonde. Weird name, but we all had fun clearing MC, etc.
---
 You're concerned with gameplay, skill caps and balancing which isn't the reason anyone wants spell batching to be as it was in Vanilla.
---
We want it because Vanilla PvP had a flow to
---
it, a rhythm so to speak and we want to play to
---
that tune come Classic.
---
Retail is there for a different experience and I understand why some people like that, but for me it's almost too responsive and I would be very frustrated and disappointed if Classic PvP played like this.
---
Depends on how hard the rest of your server is grinding. The amount of ranking you get is determined by the amount of honor you obtained for the week compared to what your entire server got.
---
Between Vanilla, BC, and Wrath, with fresh servers every 3 or so years, I could see the Classic IP get an enormous number of subs. Idk if they‚Äôll ever beat their peak though, that seems impossible. It‚Äôs still hard to believe they capped at 12m, that‚Äôs insane to me.
---
Just not supposed to promote or encourage private servers. This is just a post about a teammate getting deleted. üòÇ
---
Mages with engineering can like 1v5 people if they suck enough. Watch some old pvp videos from otherguy or vurtne. They're extremely entertaining.
---
ü§´
---
do you still think pickpocketing is the way to go for farming? im a little worried about how well it will work in classic. really interested in what rogue farms ppl are thinking of.
---
That extra 2 yard Tauren range though. And you‚Äôll have the largest possible weapon models in the game. It‚Äôs fitting for a warrior.
---
Everyone thinks they're special and, as such, it should be given to them.
---
&gt; It is about dragging down your guild in the future if they take the raids even semi serious. 
---
I'm sure you will drag a guild down with that attitude well before a boomkin who is doing above adequate dps, providing various buffs, and cooldowns every week.
---
The real reason fury wore leather.
---
So accurate lol
---
My history teacher played. He showed me his main one time. He never raided, never made it to max level, and never pvp‚Äôed. He just enjoyed the world and game the absolute fuck out of the AH. He had millions of gold in BC

Roll a holy paladin. Find a stealther buddy to pair with you, especially in BGs. Watch the enemy struggle with your plate and bubble, until they die from your buddy...

---
While it's true that shamans are in greater demand, that can also work against them when there are 5-6 other shamans rolling or bidding DKP on the same item.   Most raids will be taking 2 druids so less demand for the class, but also less competition on gear and fewer people play druid than shaman. 
---
Back in vanilla i remember getting 4 or 5 pieces of Cenarion on the same MC run because i was one of 2 or 3 druids and the others were already geared.
---
With that said, both druids and shamans are awesome options if you want to roll a tauren healer!
---
I healed on a rDruid in classic. To me it seemed like my hots barely kept people afloat. I had to cast rank 4 healing wave a lot. But roots and stealth make AB and WSG a blast.
---
"That's a very... long time."
---
This is the truth. Mana in classic wow is an actual resource, not an irrelevant bar. It was used as such. Many classes are only "balanced" by how much they have to freaking deal with it. Most of the classes who tell "I have to drink, way too much" Stories. Would be super OP if they didn't. Ele Shaman, Shadow Priest, Ret Pally all would be OP as hell if they didn't have such a mana burden placed on them.
---
It is not a solution for anything that Blizzard takes over the gold selling market, it's the same fucking problem except Blizzard simply takes all of the cash and poor people and children become the chinafarmers instead, and P2W is legitimized on top of it all.
---
Stop, think!
---
&gt;Copying from previous post:  
---
&gt;Sure, the sections are as follows:  
---
&gt;1. u/seguren 's 1-60 Trainer ranks so you know what you can skip ect.  
---
&gt;2. Professions guide. (Cooking / LW / Engineering after im 60 and farmed LW) Pre-Raid BiS gear. Enchants, consumables, world buffs, General Tips.  
---
&gt;3. Joanas Leveling Guide that i have modified to suit Rogue more. Added in training spots, grinding spots that fit LW and farming Cloth, rogue quests, grind spots for lock picking ect.  
---
&gt;4. Raid BiS list so i can see what is an upgrade and what i can pass on to fellow raiders.  
---
&gt;5. Going to add a sections for PvP tips and different specs to try for fun and goofing around.  
---
&gt;Things I've also prepared for is Food/Grocery List for 2 weeks of launch. My characters Names / Classes / Character Designs so I can make them super quick and move on to leveling. Which character will be a bank for me to mail things too so i don't have to deal with them. I made this same handbook for my girlfriend who is playing Priest. We redecorated a spare bedroom into a gaming room. We are full on hype train over here. Hope this helps some others plan their adventures.

Before you tell me that I don't know what I'm talking about just know that I only play Horde so I don't know what I'm talking about.
---
Played resto druid pvp in vanilla!  It's pretty wild, you're just a big target.
---
  3 minutes into the game and everyone knows you're the healer. They res, buff and come for you.  It can be a good thrill if you have some peel dps to help you... if you pug youre going to heal a couple times then die because pugs dont protect their healers.
---
I liquidated 6 maxed 110‚Äôs

I‚Äôm looking to PVP mainly. I first found WoW a couple of months before BC came out and seem to remember that locks were pretty nasty in BGs. I‚Äôm open to anything really but what do you all think would be the strongest PVP class to roll?
---
Use the [official forum](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/c/community/classic-discussion/l/new) for the best updates. Any new post about Classic goes there almost always first.
---
&lt;Sons of the fallen Lands&gt;
---
I don‚Äôt recall the Server unfortunately
---
Pally is easily one of the slowest classes to level. But it sounds like you'll be playing with friends so it probably doesn't matter.
---
Guild leaders will sometimes decide who gets it.   And then the fighting begins
---
Wrong sub
---
I think Classic fresh should be... well, fresh. It should be quite different from a private server launch.
---
1. The population is much more bearable with Blizzlike caps.
---
2. The playerbase should be MUCH more inexperienced with Vanilla as a whole, so it‚Äôll be easier to live vicariously through the noobs Vanilla virgin eyes.
---
3. Characters are permanent. There will be no shutdowns, and if the servers shrivel in pop, they can easily be merged. 
---
4. For experienced players, there‚Äôs a higher chance that *you* can be a server first raider. When all the huge Vanilla fans flock to the new server that they had to go out of their way to download, there‚Äôs no chance you‚Äôll be the sweaty nerd to be the best, when there‚Äôs so many more nerds and the server attracts the sweatiest.
---
5. IMO, it‚Äôs much easier to convince a friend to try the game when it‚Äôs ‚Äúlegal‚Äù. There absolutely is a stigma with private servers, and most of them deserve it. But even downloading a 3rd party service feels shady and disrespectful to most people. That was me until I quit Legion for good and the allure was too strong. So the ability to actually drag others into the abyss with you makes the game infinitely more fun. It‚Äôs a social experience, and again, you can live vicariously through other people experiencing everything for their first time.
---
I think FFXI did random server assignment. You could buy a world pass to create a character on a server with a friend (with in game gold), but that's it.
---
I liked that way. They can balance server populations that way.
---
It's funny how people are replying to you that "you won't even notice it" which undermines their own argument. If it's small and insignificant enough to have it's small and insignificant to have without.
---
Really they are just making the game worse. It's like purposely adding bugs and networking lag, just because they existed in vanilla out of necessity of the game being made in 2004 or just from lack of manpower.
---
I actually prefer the buggy gameplay it produces, but it's still inferior and wouldn't mind it being brought into modern times - as they would have intended back then if they could
---
Hello old Spinebroken friend! The excitement is real
---
So you know how some mobs drop food? If you loot it fast enough after their death (within 5 seconds) you can still eat it!
---
Pally and shaman are typically the least played classes other than druid on their respective factions.

Ehhhh was thinking about it but might run Rogue. I am not a huge pvper but I feel pvp out in the world is going to be crazy for awhile and would like to be able to stealth away lol. I never really liked lock for pvp and don't feel like trying to fight an army of undead Rogues at launch. 
---
Although I do like Warlock for endgame so I might change my mind lol.
---
With no improved mend pet, a cold snap mage will just own you without you being able to touch him, he can stay between melee and bow range and spam instants and level 1 frostbolts, get a frostbite proc and you're just done for. All this while your pet is polymorphed. If he has to deal with the pet being purged every 2 seconds, the fight gets very different. Your other points make sense and are up to preference I think, but mend pet is a must I think.
---
Hunters are viable in every raid but, please consider. As a hunter you are not coming as a DPS. You are coming as a support. Any serious guild is going to give you loot only after the rogues and warriors have had their fill. So you can raid just fine but, you may feel like a second class citizen.
---
Personally the fact you wanna do Naxx makes me feel like you are a hard core. I would recommend Mage over hunter for that. It is an actual DPS and will get first shot at gear. They are also way easier to play in pvp. THey are also better in PVP. All in all Mage over hunter unless you really want a pet. OR to farm gold.
---
I rebind my number bar to the thumb pad on the mouse saves me a lot of reaching.
---
I think it‚Äôs possible, still not sure if it‚Äôs likely... *Then again*, they don‚Äôt even release sub numbers and could easily be below 2M. And Classic could easily eclipse the modern game at a time when Classic has a peak and Modern has a valley. I highly doubt Classic will ever surpass *concurrent* subs for the modern game though.
---
I think ones obviously better and will be more beloved by many, but modern has the advantage of being an actively updated game.
---
Except.... you're wrong.  Your private server mindset is screwing you up again.  You think herbs really respawn that fast, and that black lotus spawns really are that common.  You say shit like "triggered" and shit on people who are gonna play the same as you because you want to pretend you're going to play more hardcore.
---
This isn't 5x Exp.
---
This isn't a private server.
---
This isn't somewhere your shit attitude is going to get you into a guild.
---
Saying things with conviction doesn't make them true.  Anyone experienced is looking at your posts and laughing like us lol
---
I would like the r10 gear to fc in wsg and do some world pvp while raiding. I won't be super casual, but  also not hardcore.
---
Found my wife‚Äôs old Everquest binder on a shelf last week, now THERE was some incredible work.  Those players really blazed their own trail.
---
Agreed, WoW was really a monumental game for its time in so many ways.
---
Okay, good point lol. I feel silly even being concerned about it now, seeing this bizarre thread
---
Chronicles kinda mess with Vanilla‚Äôs lore. I‚Äôd rather play WC3 and read the books people are already recommending in this thread.
---
For 5 and 10mans boomies can be good. But inferior to other casters in like every raid. Go oom basically every fight bwl onwards.
---
ok... it's not like I theorycrafted the shit out of this or anything
---
This is pvp healing.

Fun is subjective.
---
THIS! People called me crazy for having max amount of alts and leveling them all like that. But jokes on them when i had almost every class at max with very little effort.
---
I think 10-20 is aweful. I concede that 1-5 or 1-10 is a necessary evil. But most noobs will probably take 5+ hours to hit level 10. If they play that hard in the first day, than they should be prepared for a slight bottleneck. 
---
Plus, 1-10 is a short experience, relatively speaking. I can handle having that 1% of my gameplay experience being in a sharded zone. But once you get to Barrens, for example, you start spending solid amounts of time in that zone. 
---
It just doesn‚Äôt feel like an MMORPG when the world is segmented, and there are people all around you that you just aren‚Äôt in the same planet as. I get that a small amount is necessary, but imo, sharding anything past the first zone is a huge mistake, as Ion himself said he understands that sharding is *antithetical* to Classic.
---
"Now, I get your point about spell damage, however, consider how spell damage ignores armor. Also, consider how melee DPS draws more threat. So even if a paladin focuses on using spells vs. physical abilities to do more damage, they would still be making more threat than other spell damage classes because they are a melee class. "
---
1 damage = 1 threat before modifiers from talents/ stances. If your spell damage ignores armor, you are generating more threat bc you are doing more damage. 
---
Melee DPS doesnt generate more threat than ranged. They pull aggro at a lower threat number than ranged. They arent pulling more threat than casters because they are melee, they just have to respect a slightly lower threat cieling.
---
I get what you are saying, but ret pallys are limited by doing shit damage, not threat. Warlocks do great damage despite dealing spell damage and having no aggro reducing talent/stance. The difference in damage between locks and rets cannot be accounted for simply by the differences of being melee vs ranged.
---
Also, I have tanked alot of Vanilla and never see ret pallys about to pull aggro. They are quite low on threat meter, almost as low as they are on dps meter.
---
Took you a long time, but you arrived at the correct way
---
HAHA you actually just reminded me of that. I totally avoided inviting dps warriors to my groups, thinking how selfish they are that they're playing one of the very few tank capable classes and deciding to not do it.
---
I see where you are coming from, and I myself am a tank, but I dont feel duel spec would take away from the game. I plan on rolling a prot war, but will be arms for pvp. Sure theres a necessary gold sink, but they can make it less of a sting. Make it a 10g swap every time you do it.  or pay x amount of gold for the lockout to be able to swap specs. I have a feeling alot of the playerbase for vanilla wont be putting in as much time in the game as they did previously. I'd love to see a dual spec option or at least something in regards to spec switching.

---
Im 90% sure they already said that you can buy token playtime on retail and that will work on classic. 
---
They do share a sub so it makes sense too.
---
You don't need R10 gear to FC in WSG. You can do it in greens with lots of int and stam. What is way more important for a flag carrying druid. Is that you have things like Goblin grenades, Engineering helmet and, Skull of impending doom. Druids don't need fancy gear to work. They just need a guy who likes being a druid and hit and run tactics. 
---
Either way Ranking in pvp isn't casual. Don't let these neck beards lie to you. Many of us have warped views on what casual means lol. Ranking up even just to rank 10 is a serious time investment.
---
Chronicles are great, but there's a few other novels you might want to check out before Classic - my favourite being Lord of the Clans, although Arthas is a close second-runner.
---
I'd try to either play through WC3 or watch the cinematics on Youtube, WC3 is still a great game and holds up to modern standards imo.
---
Do you have the world's biggest mouse pad?
---
I want to give a solid no.
---
They're kind of fun though.
---
~ for cat, shift f for bear, t for travel shift s for moonkin. No real rhyme or reason lol
---
Reading an awful much into a name reference. You'll be hard-pressed to find actual parallels between Warcraft 3 and the two ASOIAF books that were out when WC3's story was outlined.
---
It would be antithetical to the nature of Classic. People loved this game because it rewarded you for what you did in game. There is almost no chance that Blizzard would introduce something like this.
---
They only legitimize it, if they add it themselves. If I find someone is a gold-buyer in Classic, I know they‚Äôre a dumb idiot who wasted money on a game, and probably got hacked in the process.
---
But if you do it through Blizzard, *youre smart*. If you can earn money in your job faster than the equal amount of gold in WoW, you‚Äôre being inefficient by NOT buying it. I hate that it‚Äôs in retail, but it‚Äôs even worse in Classic, where gold is a huge part of the game. Let me spend 15 bucks to give my fresh toon 100g, and the game is *ruined*.
---
Bear:middle mouse click left, Cat: middle mouse click right, travel form: shift -spacebar
---
What are the reasons that make stoneform the best pvp racial? What situations do you get the best use out of it?
---
If they allow wow tokens to exist in classic I will 100% not be playing. Nobody should be able to pay their way ahead of anyone else. Classic needs to be classic not this wow token bullshit. If a token could be bought from like a vendor to delete money and never be resold is the only situation this would be acceptable.

Veteran Vanilla PvPer and raider (MC, Ony, BWL, AQ, Nax) Got rank 10 on NE warrtard before real life issues stoppped the grind, I mained Warrior and Lock during my vanilla, and had all classes to 60 (except Pally) before TBC. Prefer a mature West Aussie guild but will be happy to just have a decent OC PvP guild.

Or buy them now.

The 5 second rule is pretty simple:
---
If you drop your food on the floor, germs legally have to wait five seconds until they hop on it. Because of this legal technicality (at least in the US, idk about other countries), you can safely eat the food if you pick it up in this timeframe.
---
I don't know why you're being downvoted, it certainly is how vanilla was designed and it should remain that way as per faction loyal design on each server.
---
&gt;Any class shouldn't have an issue finding raids
---
(Hunter standing outside in the rain, looking through a window)

Yep, it's the one talent that makes hpally work as well as it does.
---
Down voted. Thats what you get for existing.
---
Jokes aside even today mythic raid race limit brought 10-13 shadow priests to raid that‚Äôs was yesterday. Today method did 2 tanks 4 heals 2 melee and 15range dps... those guilds that run that way will be clearing and progressing raids much faster then anyone who feels other wise. ‚ÄúMin-Maxing‚Äù like this isn‚Äôt something that was only vanilla. It happens today but you and I don‚Äôt take part in that level of gameplay. But shitting on the Min-mixers is why we have this casual content stressed game today. Most guilds that will slow progress MC BWL maybe Zg-AQ and naxx are not trying to be world first world top 100 server top 4-5. Just saying. If you wanna be part of that guild you will be asked to play specific classes and roles and specs. Just do yourself a favor don‚Äôt play at that level?
---
The literal word for fresh. You know, new, a breath of fresh air, different. I don‚Äôt see what you‚Äôre getting at?
---
Same. Was grinding with a friend, sold it for I think 400g and split it with him
---
Tokens will not be in classic. However they will be in retail. As they share the same sub. PLayers who have a retail account. Will be able to use the tokens they have from retail to keep their classic account active,

---
10 is (was?) pretty easy if you play a reasonable amount.  I pushed the pvp grind for the rank 11 mount because i found farming gold dreadfully boring, but grinding pvp was super fun and I wanted a 100% mount.
---
Every rank up to 10 took 1 week of pretty moderate play.  I think I may have jumped a rank or two down low, but I think it's safe to say 8-10 weeks of consistent but not obscene amounts of pvp will get you rank 10.
---
Most of my time was spent raiding, and I was definitely not grouped with our high warlord squad for pretty much any of my journey to rank 10.  I do recall very specifically that going from 10 to 11 took me 3 weeks, since I just barely missed it after the second week.  For those weeks I was playing probably 50% of the time with the HWL premade, so it was pretty efficient.  I never did any win-trading with the GM squad on the other side, though, which was relatively common because otherwise those matches took \*ages\*.
---
Anyway I guess rank 11 is a bit out of the scope of the question.  In my experience, rank 10 was the "casual cutoff".  The time investment from 10-&gt;11 was a significant jump from 9-&gt;10.  The same can be said for the difference between all the next jumps as well.  11-&gt;12 required a ton more than 10-&gt;11, same for 12-&gt;13 vs 11-&gt;12 and 13-&gt;14 vs 12-&gt;13.
---
TL;DR: rank 8 is essentially free for anybody with any motivation to rank up at all.  Hitting 9 and 10 will take a little bit extra, but aren't very out of reach for casual players.  Anything beyond 10 you should expect to remain very committed to ranking up.
---
Copyright laws are there for a reason. Unless you drastically made changes to the original guide.
---
Wonder how many super edgelord guild names we will get this time around. Player base is much older now.
---
What was your character name? I did a couple raids with you guys in naxx
---
Mage is bad in the sense that its the most boring class in the game in raiding.
---
maybe nothing special, but i remember having a couple of max rank books in my bank, not realizing that some other people in the guild were desperate for them. (warrior stuff iirc)
---
and the reaction when they said they needed it, and i had it.  
---
gods, i was a newb
---
Wait for the proc to send one then pop presence of mind for another instant pyro
---
Yes they are basically immune to melee and for the range to target paladins. They need to get very far out of position. Pally is baller as fuck.
---
The Horde is not for everyone.
---
Well at minimum you could do 2 to my knowledge prolly more somehow. How tho? You cast fireball. Procs tier set, you cast pyroblast instantly. You can spec into arcane and get presence of mind, using this spell makes your next skill instant under 10 second cast. Pyroblast has no cd so any instant spell cast from any proc allows an additional pyroblast. That spec is also referred to as PoM pyro.
---
If people are up front about loot expectations at the start of the dungeon there's no issues typically.
---
Against rogues, warriors, druids, priest, warlock, hunters it negates bleeds, dots, blinds
---
You have a link to this stuff? I would love to have a thing of beauty like that at my rig

Saying why Classic will be different than private servers, while using a private server community-appropriated word to describe the Classic server. The irony is self explanatory, lol.
---
Gurubashi PvP Horde side &lt;KaiZen&gt;
---
Raided with them a bit on my mage. MC, BWL, most of AQ. Had a lot of fun!!! 
---
Can't remember what server I went to after but the guild was called &lt;Do It Well&gt; iirc. Also loads of fun. Finished AQ with them and half of Naxx.
---
While that is good it is better for rogue twinks than leveling. It doesn't have a high enough drop rate and you don't really want to sit and farm SFK as rogues can level easily enough without it. One run won't kill you though.
---
Here is a very informative thread:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7qutjz/human_caster_how_much_of_a_disadvantage_is_it/
---
TLDR:
---
"gnome - 7248 max mana
---
human - 6843 max mana
---
dps difference in that given example was
---
378.9 dps - gnome
---
376.3 dps - human
---
though obviously it depends on crits/resists procs. gnome is definitely critted more than average there, though it got 1 more resist, so it quite equaled, though it can vary."

---
Yes on pvp servers you could only create one faction.  If you wanted to switch you had to delete your characters before it would let you create characters of the other faction.  I am 99% certain (just based on my own conjecture) that this is how it will be in classic.
---
On pve servers you could have both factions at the same time.
---
ü§ê
---
This is so true. Even today this shit happens. Last time I played I toured legion I jumped in some PvP to heal for giggles, was doing my part keeping everyone alive while they didn't notice - but the alliance did. Had 4 dudes all over me, obliterated me while nobody paid attention. The guy I was healing right beforehand died a few moments after me and yelled at me for not healing him.
---
I'm like bro how did you think you survived that long and did you notice I got pounded right next to you?
---
People are ass. Last time I pug a BG. At least if I'm playing with a few buds we got each other's backs and I turn my buddies into ever-living death machines because we know how to peel for each other while I keep the green numbers flowing.
---
Lots of folks want to be Johnny Awesome with the dips and I enjoy it, too, but when you pull some insane heals out your ass and your team is still up while corpses litter the ground it feels sooooooo good.
---
You yelled at him for 40 mins because he wants to play a game how he wants? What a bitch.
---
If they want to do that, good for them, they will probably be better
---
Personally, I love spell batching. For one, it discourages the need to absolutely DESTROY your keys mashing them to get the first move. It also makes addons that autocast when able less necessary. 
---
There‚Äôs so many fun plays that come from it. There‚Äôs been so many ‚Äúoh no‚Äù and ‚Äúoh yes‚Äù moments. Compared to just having the addon that guarantees a cast first, or mashing your button so loud you wake up your girlfriend in the next room.
---
it had a 1 min cd for most of vanilla.
---
A ret pally trying really, really hard (full consumables ect.) will do half what a similarly gear fury warrior that's got no consumables and is drunk smashing buttons will do. It's not an exaggeration. Ret pally DPS is a meme for a good reason.
---
If you want to be in a higher end raiding guild just don't. If your happy getting as far as whatever guild you get into will get, you still will struggle to find a spot.
---
For casters /stopcasting stops your current cast and starts casting whatever you put behind it. I used a /stopcasting /cast earth shock as an ele sham.
---
This is the kind of high quality post that gets a 100 upvotes while an STV meme makes it to the 2k.  
---
Thank you for this I'm planning on hunter.

Yeah I was trying to devils advocate side with the op, but Jesus, that‚Äôs some top tier douchiness.

He's a Horde fanboy - they have not chill. Just impotent rage, asperger syndrome and dinosaur chicken tendies. I mean whether you prefer that to Alliance Fanboys with their hentai obsession, autism and buttered s'ghetti that's your call.

If you think you‚Äôre going to avoid even one of those cause you‚Äôre paying a sub you‚Äôre gonna have a bad time
---
wow really guess it wastn just me noticing that. World has gone to shit lol.
---
I exclusively play horde, but I'm so tempted to play a pally healer. I don't care how boring the gameplay is, I care how effective it is. Which Paladin seems to be extremely effective.
---
Ya, that's the real issue isn't it? You give gear to people for what helps the guild. You will be giving first dibs on all dps plate to the warriors, and probably even the 2H weapons. Im playing horde so i don't have to shit on any paladins dreams personally, but I'm not going to stick with a guild that's rolling with enhancement shamans and giving them priority on 2h weapons either so....
---
Which classes can dispel which types of debuffs?
---
Mydogfarts sums it up pretty well.
---
It‚Äôs a pserver thing. It‚Äôs just because some the most recent ‚Äúvanilla‚Äù versions are inaccurate and it‚Äôs causing misunderstandings
---
It's hands down the best support class of classic wow. Especially in pvp.
---
This guy isnt going to have fun during classic, tbh this makes me more angry than happy.
---
An explanation of this is back to front. if you read it that way it makes a lot more sense as it lists cursor over each inventory item, then deletes the cursor item.

Yeasss!!!! Suramar survivors!!!!!!

Thank you for the second opportunity to down vote.

I think he should play what he wants, and I think you should get a new bf

Here's a third. I love down votes
---
lets do some real talk here, there will be dubios goldsellers anyway. i will 100% bet my entire account on the fact that at somepoint 6-12month after release well get tokens in classic wow.
---
Ugh, remember that it's classic 40 man raiding. The "utility" that one player brings really doesn't matter with few exceptions. If one players utility matters, your raid comp is already complete ass.
---
Solo elites? Don't know. At least Druids can fill any role in a dungeon, and they are not overplayed like Hunters.
---
Do you have like all of your guide in word docs? I'm planning on rolling rogue too, and this looks super helpful. I would greatly appreciate a dm with the docs or heck even a video that shows each page that I could screen shot. I understand if you dont still have the word docs or don't want to go to all the extra effort for a stranger. Best of luck in classic, either way

Ive never been so pissed off and so happy as I have been playing PvP healer.
---
What Human passive are you talking about? Humans are generally the worst Alliance race for PvP.
---
Yeah, it seems like it would be the strongest 5 man healer because of all the buffs alongside the super efficient heals. It would also be cool to check out alliance. It seems to me that paladins are very common, but devoted healer paladins are very rare.
---
It was a joke. I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs a good thing to already be annoyed at what I‚Äôm not even playing haha
---
Oo no you don't. This ones getting an up vote. I always win!...
---
Some weaps are definitely more pally oriented, like Sulfuras and Kalimdors Revenge. Our guild gives those to dedicated holy paladins. Thats the thing about palas. The holy ones want to go pvp as ret or reck too. They just arent so self absorbed to force the bad spec into a raid. Why should a ret pala that refuses to do whats best for guild get rewarded over a great holy pala that carries the raid?
---
Yes! I'm going to so the same. I like having my leveling routes on paper and I can check stuff off and add notes with a pen as I go. For some reason its much nicer than alt tabbing all the time
---
That link is specifically broken. we'll get that fixed soon. Thanks for the heads up!

Check out Monkeynews on youtube for some Warrior WPvP. They usually require healers to shine, but can destroy people alone too in the hands of good players.

Tokens in wow classic ruin the economy and the achievement of earning things. Want epic riding just pay 100$ and it‚Äôs yours. If you know people have the easy option to buy gold with 0 risk your going to put those BIS items higher than you would on a server with no tokens. Why because with gold tokens someone could afford the absurd price of 5k for edge masters hand guards. On a brand new fresh server they may go for 100g the first week.
---
don't listen to these noobs. 
---
Someone will always need a warrior for high dps, or a tank. that is pretty much guaranteed. Nobody needs just a DPS class most the time. Your groups will be spending a lot of time finding a warrior/healer. If you play with your bro you are guaranteed into groups OR you can start a group at any moment you want too.
---
Ah I see, apologies :)
---
God please don‚Äôt be an aug-September release.
---
This guy ain't wrong
---
Getting much past 10 or 11 will be tough on that schedule, and 11 doesn't do much for you unless you want cheap epic riding.
---
Rank 10 might be tough on your lighter weeks, but fortunately you don't need to churn a 30 hour week every week to hit rank 10.  You can certainly hit 8 easily, but probably slowly, on a \~10 hour week.  If you then want to push for 9 and 10, you can try to plan to have 2-3 weeks of 20+ hours consecutively.
---
It doesn't take many weeks in a row to get a single rank down that low.  8-&gt;9 and 9-&gt;10 can both be done in a single week without going insanely hardcore.  It's also fairly easily to prevent decay, so you can probably do a heavy week, hit 9, then follow it up with a slower week and maintain the rank or lose a minimal amount of progress.
---
The only thing that's certain is that you \*will\* need to have some weeks of pretty heavy dedication.  You can slowly wander your way up to the cusp of those ranks, but you won't hit them if you're only playing 2 hours a day.  You'll probably need two heavy weeks in a row for 9-&gt;10, but you may also be able to spread it out and just take a lot longer.  It's hard to say since it does vary a bit by server activity.
---
***THIS PLEASES ME.*** - The Dark One
---
This is not what I mean, but spell interactions WILL work like this but you just won‚Äôt notice it (until you fail to interrupt something that affects you, still getting the cd).
---
Them being in regular wow is fine the newest expansion has the worst player count in wow history. I just don‚Äôt want a token in classic to exist, and this is because people should not be able to purchase gold under any circumstance.
---
Was about to say this, if you want to get paid to get certs find an air national guard unit bear you and do then one weekend a month gig in the comm squadron. 8 weeks of a relatively easy (but annoying) boot camp, and then it's tech school where you come out of it with a sec+ and a security clearance (usually TS) then most common squadrons will pay for you to get more certs.
---
The guys in my bases comm squadron get recruited like crazy. That security clearance and the certs is a huge selling point
---
Same. An old mod started me in that habit to use zxc
---
You should have seen the website
---
God damn you nailed it. So many times my healing partner dies then I smash the person that kills him. Then wait around for my buddy to run back and res.
---
It's very simple. Wow is not remembered for it's gameplay. If you sit your friend down and have them watch you raid. They will have no clue why you love this game. The truth is. The gameplay is simple and straight forward, but that my friend is the magic.
---
Classic wow is at it's base. Very simple and straight forward. It's one of the smoothest games to just pick up and play. So it appeals to everyone. It then takes that and couples it with systems that force social interaction. That is what we all remember. Social interactions, not game play.
---
The reason why classic won't just be around in two years but, will actually be bigger is simple. When you log into classic and hit a quest you can't do alone. You will ask for help. Mr. Tiggles will be happy to help. After you and Mr. Tiggles finish the quest. You and ole Tiggles will be fast friends. That is why classic will still be hear. Because you will want to meet up with Mr. Tiggles tomorrow and have fun together. Rather then logging into retail to try to accomplish something alone.
---
Get Engineering for stun grenades. That helps.
---
Yes it was!
---
Warlock and Hunters are the two classes that stick out the most in that way.
---
Can confirm pally 5 man healing was nice. Could salvage everyone to make my cousins tanking job easier judge light to help heal.
---
They are the best healers even in raids. Priest is the only one that can be argued to even be close but, the argument is a lie lol.
---
I had a shadowpriest on a PS in mostly r12/13
---
Was annoyed by legit drinking 50% of the time.
---
IP ban gold buyers and sellers from all blizzard games. If classic gets wow token that would mean people could spend real money on items that give large advantages IE devilsaur. If they add a classic wow token I believe most of the classic purists will be pushed too far and quit the game. The buying of wow tokens could also skew the economy making it harder for legitimate players to get items they would want. If wow token is added blizz will lose my sub yet again.
---
Were experiencing Stage 0 right now.
---
That's the threat mitigation right?
---
They can release it tomorrow they are just being dicks trying to profit the most and brainstorming
---
You recognize that it's a necessary gold sink but still try to push lowering the price.
---
It just seems like that crit scaling is busted with that talent for 100% refund.
---
i know you're triggered, but just try and calm down and look at how stupid you sound.
---
The troll racial scales with gear, and UD and Tauren racial are actually good for pvp. The only class that wants to be an orc is warrior because of the axe skill, and because you can stack stun resist talents. Nobody else who can play an orc can take stun resist talents, or will use axes, except I guess enhancement shaman. The orc racial is a free melee trinket you cant use in pvp, and is worse than berserk in pve.
---
So in summary, rogues, locks, hunters, and most shaman would rather have literally any other set of race bonuses. So pretty much just orc warriors then...Even then, if you dont want to fight over the 3 good epics axes you can have an extra stun or pvp trinket for when you finally do pvp with that gear.
---
Different opinion = troll? Good luck with that attitude. Classics a social game.

wasnt forced, she offered a compromise.
---
Yep thats why it was nerfed to 50% in TBC and was still the stone nuts. There gonna be a lot of people rolling horde because they think it's the way better pvp faction. They are in for a surprise when they run into the bubble boys. The day a clothadin evolves into a full paladin. Is a disastrous day for the horde.
---
As long as you have that Nightfall equipped we good fam.
---
The voidwalker CAN definitely NOT tank 5 man dungeon. Just because it has a threat spell don't mean it 5 man dungeon tank.
---
Playing ret is like choosing to be in the special olympics.
---
It changed early in classic. Chained flight paths will definitely be a thing if it's based off of 1.12
---
They havent proven anything. Being num 1 dps in one ubrs is not proof. Esfand regularly parses very low despite being fed the best gear and going ham w consumes. If anything they prove ret is bad.
---

I was hoping for something way more lighthearted coming to this thread.

Stop acting like an authority.

All need on boes.

ITT: people pretending she is abusing her boyfriend by offering an optional compromise that he can willingly accept or decline. I'm the last person to white knight, trust me, but this is ridiculous. Also the opposite would be forcing her to group with a character she doesn't want to.
---
Shit my friends can't even group with me if they are rolling on my gear.
---
This is depressing
---
You will have alot more fun in world pvp as rogue. I found that world pvp was more fun as a range or stealth class. Warriors are great fun in premad bg tho
---
Then don't make claims about shit you don't know.
---
Did you even bother to watch the video? He was topping the meters the entire time. he didn't get carried, he was the carry.
---
Horde so you don't have to play against WOTF.
---
Alliance because Warlocks are rarer there due to the above.
---
Yes, i have a feeling the playerbase will not be as hardcore, especially since it's likely they want people to still play retail. Theres ways to add the gold sink but still cut costs. IE like i gave an example, or at x level be able to purchase the option of a second set of traits that you can swap between for a cheaper price. If you want to swap the traits on the bar it costs the amount as normal. To swap between each spec charge 50%. 
---
It still creates a gold sink, but doesn't lock people who are casual players into a specific roll.  Gold sinks don't have to be expensive like rerolling was, especially for someone like me who played tank and then pvp'd as an arms war. Going back to classic isn't about being diehard for most of the playerbase.

Not enough tanks for 5 mans, and too many for raids.

Hey man! I do something pretty similar but I have a suggestion for you.

Yeah, my minor research has led me to thinking dwarf would be best for pvp, as pallys have no spirit priority, but human would allow me to hate myself 10% less if I decide to grind the saber.
---
He's been top meters in MC as well, just goes to show you don't know what you're talking about.

But but it‚Äôs all easily accessible online
---
There is no high level raiding in vanilla though besides i guess racing for realm firsts though right? There is only one difficulty, so why leave out 90% of specs.
---
Alch, Tailoring and leatherworking got mats they can craft that has 4days cd and therefore sell for alot. Level up a few alts and you make moeny while you sleep
---
I assume you're refering to this:
---
&gt;Mage casting polymorph, rogue kicks it. Rogue still gets polymorphed AND puts Kick on CD
---
thing is you're making an assumption, we don't know how that situation will play out, it might be that interrupts simply don't get put on the spell batch timer, or maybe the interrupt would still cancels out the sheep that's on the shame batch.
---
Are you using EZDismount OP?
---
Something is wrong here lol  [http://www.classicdb.ch/?npc=11502#drop](http://www.classicdb.ch/?npc=11502#drop)
---
Fury warrior, it the most played class for a reason. Full world buffs in raids with a fun rotation makes very satisfying.
---
How did you get that idea from this post???? He doesn't like org so use a cross-gendered insult?
---
Ok... what about only canadian moonkins? Lmao
---
Wish people wouldn't downvote stuff just because they don't agree with it. You put a lot of effort into this post and it's at least worth a discussion.
---
Seeing as this was an engine error I highly doubt we'll see this again.  
---
And it didn't apply to WW which was a mindfuck.
---
Yeh reduces threat by 20% letting your dps go harder than they can on horde side.
---
Which I suppose would make alliance warlocks raiding monsters.
---
Yeah kind of like "yeah okay fine I can't get my way 100% but I still want to remind myself I have some control over you" can't confirm but I get that vibe after rereading it.
---
Oh the day when we've kited thunderaan to OG and our rogue was crying in TS to bring him back the whole time because he she was worried that she would have to farm the gold for 100 bars again XD
---
Are you going to have a guild? I want to be playing with credible people this time around. No desire to be an officer or GM this time around either, but want to play with people who want to have fun and know what they are doing.
---
Interesting! I didn't know that that's how it worked. I guess I always assumed there was some kind of released  database that it pulled from.
---
Sec+ is a bitch. Tbh (at least for me in the military) it was all based on what test you got and what subjects were on it, there were some questions on the exam that were not even in either of the two books I read. Do you have a link to all the documents in your book there? I planned on playing a rogue in classic, however I use my second monitor for all information like that.

Star developing muscle memory by assigning day-to-day keyboard bindings to your mouse like so:

When I set this up I basically got used to 1-2 of those buttons each day. After about two weeks my thumb was just flying around the mouse without thinking about it.
---
Warlocks dont exsist on alliance side they are a mythical creature because WoTF undead racial makes them rage at not being fear gods. But yeh I‚Äôm sure it helps locks but really it benefits fury warriors the most because they aren‚Äôt threat capped with no way to drop or reduce threat other than stopping dps.
---
Engine error, won't happen.
---
If you go horde warlock you still have to deal with fear ward. Fear ward can be more prevalent that wotf in some contexts, and has a much shorter cooldown.
---
While wotf grants immunity, fear ward can be targeted on high priority targets, which can turn in to a real nightmare for locks.

They said they are going to change any QoL thing that can be done by an addon. This was one of them. I think they mentioned it at blizzcon?
---
I dont know what I want to roll.  I plan on playing PVP and PVE.  I played a hunter in Vanilla OG, however I stayed at 49 for most of the pre-BC patch, and then 59 when the BC gear dropped, so I never raided on my hunter.  
---
I played that hunter through Kara, but leveled a Druid and eventually began OT and eventually MT in BC, through some T5 content.
---
Druid main tanked ICC, killed LK and all that jazz.  Also had opportunities to do feral and balance dps.  
---
Druid main tank in Cata, did most of the raids, also had opportunities to do feral and balance dps.
---
In Legion I only played pvp on a boosted Shaman.   The other expansions I have skipped. 
---
Im leaning towards rolling another druid but I have heard it was mega different pre-BC talent changes.  Anyone got some opinions on this?
---
You have a better chance of running DM as Horde or WC as Alliance than forming a group for SFK as Alliance.
---
In my experience, it was really only the casters that wanted to do that dungeon on Alliance. Trying to convince a tank to do that dungeon instead of Stockades was never worth the hassle.
---
I've been tossing up between a male or female dwarf. 
---
Can somebody tell me which of these two you would rather party with?

I loved doing this. I had and Orc Hunter back then. Had my skinning all the way up as high as it would go as well. I can't wait to do UBRS again, probably my favorite place in classic.
---
You went right to thing I didnt want to argue.  Mounts make you level faster than a single weapon upgrade.
---
"Stealing"  LMAO 
---
I think thats enough of your shitty logic.
---
no one cares what you look like? Have you been playing the same game?
---
Druids are decent soloers, but nothing tops hunters in that regard.
---
Druids might use more bag slots. Given a Druid might keep 2-3 sets of gear depending on their role.
---
F for feral, C for cat
---
Yeah, I used to take that rout.
---
They thicc
---
Giving free enchants while leveling enchanting IS SO REWARDING AND FUN  
---
Receiving them as well. At low levels a few +3s in some stats is such a huge boost!  
---
God, vanilla is perfect
---
F for bear, C for cat
---
Hes still only #4 on dps and wearing ashkhandi in a raid that cant even kill Rag before submerge. The dps in that raid is either terrible or very undergeared compared to him. Rag should drop before submerge easily if you are a raid that is killing Nef.
---
Horde if you want it easy for PvP.
---
Alliance if you want to be valued more.
---
yeah, that is why I used to take him farther out.
---
Without it you can say goodbye to questing and grinding. Every mob will be camped. I don't think people understand that private server launches are already changed from original vanilla and that isn't how original retail vanilla was.
---
People will always race and compare themselves amongst others
---
Canadian Moonkins
---
I can already see the R-18 fan fics about "Tapping their trunks for maple syrup" :V
---
Shouldn't the 2nd picture be taken from a lower angle?
---
Yikes
---
Aren‚Äôt things like spell batching engine limitations/errors? Blizzard seems to be pretty good about nochanges.
---
im joking ofc. I loved this game in the past.
---
This is some Lesli Knopf level stuff, very impressive. You‚Äôve inspired me to make one for Paladins.
---
There used to be a mod (I want to say 'Rare Tracker') that would have an overlay on your map showing the path for them.
---
Err, can't the warriors ask for those weapons for exactly the same reason as paladins?
---
Joanna has the devilsaur spawns and paths in his guide but I‚Äôm not 100% how accurate they are. That‚Äôs probably your best bet though.
---
You had to go there!
---
sure, but outside the top 1% of guilds in retail no one stacks classes to progress, and it would be a shame if it was common in classic like most people here lead on.
---
Why would I be valued more on Alliance?
---
Who needs a mount when you can just get the AB boots?
---
Where does it go? Should be between two places both factions want to be. Between Stone Talon and Tanaris?
---
Compromise: Chainmail dress
---
I love this, so completely true. Especially the 'Only replies with...' part. Right down to the heartbreaking last log-in, 100% correct. &lt;3
---
I wish more spells had reagents. WoW is very lax with how little spells require reagents. I remember in UO, I believe every single spell costed reagents. Most spells besides cantrips in D&amp;D require reagents. They are also great for the economy. A level 5 toon can already start making money off of the auction house from light feathers. It isn't much money to the level 60 but to a level 5, a few extra silver is another ability that they can pick up.
---
Nice try mafia man.
---
mannn the only reason i dont play paladins is cuz their BiS is those stupid cloth pieces lol
---
Northwest (35, 23)

North (57, 24)

Staff of Jordan is only deserved by the top 1% of gamers willing to pay for it. If you think I will watch you equip a 500 gold item so your frostbolt can do 14 more damage for 7 levels until a staff with 21 spell power drops and almost dwarfs this "epic item" you're dead wrong. 
---
The item is a luxury item, min-maxxed for twinks and rich people.
---
If you want to make a delineation between BiS gear at 60 and twink items that's a good conversation to have.
---
I am not saying you can't want those items, but I've played twinks and currently have some. A single item doesn't move the meter much, even an epic isn't far ahead of the many blue items you can get.
---
They should put in a goblin vending machine that will take your gold and let you pay for your sub via playing in Classic, but not let you buy tokens with money to sell for gold in Classic.
---
They reversed that at some point. Xpoff queues are no more. Thinking in retail is halfway decent again.
---
I had a caster core who were all officers.... they pretty much told me I was going boomchicken at one point.
---
What race should I play as a horde hunter for pvp?
---
How I would decide this is by thinking about what class I would play and if i would benefit more from paladin buffs/auras (salvation!) or shaman totems.
---
I did!
---
Because I'm that kind of ~~person~~ moonkin!
---
In Vanilla we would randomly get to respec when they changed our class or talents enough. It was great and something to look forward to on patch day, even if you didn't like the changes. You got a free respec, and I remember getting a few of these while I played. I don't know how you emulate that in classic, but if every few phases respec costs reset, or you just got a free one, that would be nice.
---
Fire and Blood, but I can‚Äôt remember the server name at all, even when I Google old guilds and severs :( all I remember is it was Alliance EU based. English speaking.
---
It was such a fantastic guild, awesome community to be apart of...I miss those days.
---
Are you willing to share these as word docs? Even if you delete the content but provide us with the templates, that would be awesome!
---
i was in a couple of nonsense guilds early on.
---
the first real guild, i will never forget
---
Destructive Nature on Dentarg (i was in this guildfor vanilla, and wrath, TBC i was kind of lost in the wilderness.)
---
the GM Boldark, a priest (later rolled a mage named zarjin). a great guy, a young family man.  never raged. always fair.  his brother was in the guild, and when we killed Sartharion +3, his brother told us he was running around the house with his infant daughter on his shoulder). you could not ask for a better guild leader.
---
the GM's brother Veto, a fellow hunter. we worked together great in dungeons/raids. later he rolled a warlock named hemorrhoids. dude was jacked irl.
---
another fellow hunter named Grencha, we learned a lot together (he eventually rolled a druid named Wildbar)
---
Throttle, a hunter whose pet was named Clutch
---
cloudz (a warlock that had crusader enchat because he liked it), reagan (shaman that had a 'Reagan Smash!' macro), silhouette (rogue that had an odd hate of hunters), 
---
Thorstenburg, a warlock that always laughed at my terrible jokes
---
Balla, a warrior that was really young irl
---
Nyt, an undead warrior and Blessrthou, an undead priest (met in gameand became a couple irl)
---
and Fannie, a troll priest and my absolute best WoW friend ever. an older southern guy, a true gentleman.  ultimate team player. had severe health issues.  stopped logging in one day.  I miss him, and think of him every time i log in to WoW.
---
This is 5-10 lvl 40 mounts, and a mount is far more valuable than a Jordan. You barely notice the Jordan unless you're a warlock, even then the warlock is better off selling it, so everyone knows it's mostly just gold.
---
&lt;The Lost Ones&gt;, Kor'gall, EU.
---
Norwegian server. We never raided
