I would say probably close to 1/3 of horde players picked the faction because of racials. There are probably 10-20x more orcs on the horde side compared to vanilla and that is literally only because of stun resist.
---
---
---
&amp;#x200B;
---

---
thats level restricted anyway.
---
should have rings and neck and maybe trinkets by lvl 40
---
It's a lovely name!
---
I was luck enough to be in the first wave of players on this realm, so I got all the names I wanted.
---
Name checks out.
---
Thanks, I just tried re-writing my macro and /use &lt;mount name&gt; works. I'm not sure what I was doing wrong before.
---
To eliminate spelling errors, I typed '/use ' and then just left clicked my mount in my inventory and the client auto-filled the name of the item into the macro. I bet I was just spelling it wrong before.
---
I guess i don't have it on Sap, now that you mention it. Ambush, Cheap Shot, and Garrote.
---
Feel bad for your stomach if you down that whole thing by yourself lol
---
If you can't find the hit, keep Blackcrow. Carapace will be slightly more overall dps.
---
Has anybody had luck doing the hunter pull trick where a pet (wind serpernt?) or player with a ranged attack pulls 1 mob out of a crowd after the hunter pulls. Then hunter FD , and the other mobs from the pack go home. 
---
I'm just wondering if it's possible to easily split some of the nastier packs in like strat, lbrs, etc
---
I'm with China tbh
---
Druid. Would take a lot longer without Life Tap though. 
---
Probably faster to just tank for a needy group, clear it normally, and reserve ores for yourself.
---
Everyone roll "need" unless you need it. Give it to the person who needs it only on the agreement that it will be instantly equipped.
---
Hoarder alert!
---
I'm currently level 59 and have been running many dungeons throughout the leveling process.
---
In every dungeon run ive been in every group member has rolled greed unless they are going to equip the item straight away.
---
Those that have rolled need have always asked first and explained they are going to be using the item, myself included.
---
Maybe I've just been lucky or chose a good server (Zandalar Tribe) but I've come across no ninja looters yet for BoE items, the closest to a ninja looter I've grouped with was another shaman needing on the healing staff from last BRD boss when i had just spent a good 3-4 hours healing the whole dungeon for the group and i needed the staff myself, i found that in very bad taste...but i won the roll.
---
+3% hit and +3.7% are no different so 305 vs 312 skill does nothing for hit.
---
+4.7% dmg to your white attacks is about +2% overall dmg (i do about 40% of my dmg with white attacks on a boss like Rag). 
---
I think having +1 crit and 50 or so AP would be more than that dmg increase. And thats if it actually is 4.7% more dmg having 305 vs 312 skill.
---
And you dont get any +crit from 305 vs 312 skill.
---
I believe it uses a global. But it's definitely possible.
---
Yes
---
l2p
---
I am not saying you are the bad guy, and at 40 there are not many trinkets available.  You shouldnt be called out on your gear if you have your main armor equipped.  
---
Also worth mentioning that at lvl 40 your gear is making almost zero difference to group efficency as you are unlike you have much +heal or +spell crit anyway.  If you keeping the tank up, you done your job.
---
I know your pain. Thought I was going to get gkick  when I told them I replaced leggings of the fang at level 50 something. I know there were better options, but I never got around to them or got a better drop.
---
Its part of ElvUi it overhauls the entire HUD
---
I don't quite follow how you're using this macro to find broken tooth
---
Absolutely not. 
---
I can't WoW like I used to. This is coming from a guy that had an 8/8 T6 rogue, Crux of the Apocalypse, with full Vengeful Gladiator set.
---
Yeah it was combustion-living bomb
---
I love these. Nice work lol
---
Should have*
---
Sorry... I know not all spriests are like this, but it’s super hard to keep aggro away from an spriest, especially bad ones. 
---
SWP dots at the start means you have to tab sunder. Hope to god the rest of your DPS is hitting the same target as the priest because you’re gonna have to taunt every time they mind blast. All that effort and they don’t really offer utility... a good spriest obviously does (heals dispels and bubble) but a bad spriest has 4 keys bound and the rest require a few clicks.
---
They are the best 19 twinks
---
As a healer, not convinced that's true. I felt like I was in high demand for lowbie dungeons, but at lvl 60 I'm having trouble getting into the dungeons where a lot of healing pre-BiS drops. The demand for tanks is on a completely other level compared to the demand for healers.
---
Ever heard of a healer who though their pug DPS was competent? You should never assume ppl are as good as yourself. And for all we know the mage could have CDs. I've saved countless idiot dps when by your logic i should just watch em die. Idiot dps is still dps. If you can save, you should, just saying how i prioritize my group healing. Letting a dps die means longer time spent in dungeon.
---
BOTTLE
---
That’s the odds if you care what the number is (for the OP it is important). But if you only care about 3 people rolling the same number, it’s gonna be 1/10,000 since the first roll doesn’t matter what the value is.
---
Grab fishing. Anything in a pool can be great. The salvage can even drop greens mats and recipes.
---
You cant teach the ignorant :D
---
Hunters were popular in the 19 bracket, they were pretty strong.
---
There used to be a website called Twink Info or something, not sure if it’s still around. But they had a ton of information and people would organize events through it. 
---
Sorry I’m on mobile
---
&gt;ask guild for any dungeons, no answer
---
&gt;look around in different channels and nobody needs a healer (noggenfogger are fucking stacked with healers)
---
&gt;solo farming for 1-2h
---
Thirteen!!
---
It would be really fucking nice if they fixed world defense channel too because at least then you'd have an idea to what's going on in the world.
---
Some good old red wine. You know, to balance out the not-so-posh pizza.

---
It's literally in his username, don't feed the trolls, they already have Darkshore!
---
I'm glad I told myself early that I wouldn't care about Dal's.  Everyone and their mother wants those swords, and there are enough alternatives that make trying to get a group, then seeing the swords drop, then hoping to win the rolls, not worth the time investment.
---
If you have all day to do a dungeon, sure.  If I have exactly 1.5 hours and if we dont get it done in that time frame im going to have to leave then I kinda need it goin as fast as reasonably possible
---
The roll you were doing during the encounter determines your eligibility. You don’t get to flip flop just because of a drop. Go get pre BiS as a tank and come back and tank it. Then you’re eligible.
---
Mage doesn't count. Run it back.
---
So what if Teebu's Blazing Longsword drops? Worth upwards of 6000g.
---
The Rogue says he's going to use it, do you just give it to him?
---
Just because you can't use the sword, couldn't you still use the 6000g? Couldn't you use that gold to buy things that your character can use?
---
Don't you deserve a fair shot at rolling on something that valuable? Isn't everyone rolling need the most fair possible way? Other than selling it and splitting the gold equally, but that would require a lot of trust.
---
As he said: edgelord.
---
Jeffpesos
---
&gt;And thats if it actually is 4.7% more white dmg having 305 vs 312 skill
---
Why wouldn't it be?
---
&gt;You dont get any +crit from 305 vs 312 skill
---
Shit, yeah, edited post.
---
Mine is Jeffpesos :)
---
A
---
Ironically so. Just this morning I got 10 for 10g. What are the odds someone else did exactly what OP did?
---
The awful recorder at the end was excellent.
---
DUDE, THATS NOT HOW THIS WORKS
---
DW generally is better for single target sustained dps while 2h excels with AoE trash.
---
Also, don’t go DW until you are yellow hit capped and have more than 25% crit unbuffed.
---
I will say also that 2H is much less viable on alliance side. Horde has WF which dramatically increases dps for 2h wars.
---
Am i the only idiot that goes to an instance BEFORE i start hitting up LFG so i'm ready to zone in straight away?
---
Thanks man. Sorry you got downdooted in the comments.
---
Bad mage
---
I actually did a dungeon and someone in it asked if I’d leave my guild for theirs because apparently it’s rare for the mage to frost nova when the other dps starts to aoe.
---
If you enjoy making these keep it up, they are really funny.
---
I’ve seen it from urok.
---
Switching from horde to alliance after 10 years is like being an atheist all your life and then all of a sudden becoming a hardcore evangelical Christian in your 40s. You were right this whole time, why did you make such a stupid decision later in life?  People are more passionate about horde because its actually cool, alliance is lame in comparison,  that's why people aren't as attached to it.
---
That's a really low sample size.
---
I reccomend running at least 10,000 attacks if you're trying to measure % accurately.
---
[removed]
---
Oops, I forgot the last clip is w/ dagger sub build.
---
!remind me
---
It’s never worked for me.
---
agreed, and when it comes to things of value like say a flask recipe, I would expect anyone rolling need to learn it on the spot.  I have passed on 3 epic BoE's so far, and happy to do it again if the person is prepared to prove they will use it.  I will one day get screwed by some cash whore but its only money, and once you got your epic mount money has less value.
---
You posted this earlier?
---
Ok ok I’m sorry I poked the bear but sometimes I do miss some convenient features and yes I understand dungeon finder had many flaws too it but it’s nice for people with limited time
---
Eh. If he died because eranikus put sleep on the tank then the mage should have kited/ ice blocked the dragon. If the mage pulled aggro by doing too much damage it’s on the mage.  
---
Either way I doubt there’s anything you could have done to save the mage.
---
I also love how each class brings something different to the table. I'm seriously jealous of pretty much every class because of that one utility they have that I don't.
---
Is this what it's like to chew 5gum?
---
Wrecked so hard at the 29 bracket
---
Question. I'm an orc who ran to Mulgore at level 1. I went to classic wowhead, clicked quests, then filtered by only quests which reward rep with thunder bluff. Then I just sorted by level and I've been doing every single one. The quests REALLY started thinning out at 25-35. Right now I'm 44 and I'm just entering feralas. I'm at 75% to revered which is making me nervous that Runecloth is inevitable. Can you suggest what I should do further?
---
Use the profanity filter? Why did u even turn it off if bad words make you feel bad
---
I think he was just Young and stupid. His obsession of doing the right thing was way out of the line. But we see why he made that decision
---

dude stfu
---
I picture everyone on that realm always as a pirate of ninja while off the Savory Deviate Delights. Pls tell me I’m right
---
Druids, they always run away like pussies if they can't win a fight
---
I leveled shadow until mid 50s. It's true shadow priests aren't the best at dishing out damage, I mostly just healed.
---
But I found that if you dps with a warlock in the party the two of you end up being very dangerous due to shadow weave. 
---
But being dps in as a shadow priest is nice because you can res the healer if they die, and you can off heal during emergencies.
---
Ikr... it’s gonna be a shit farm soon because everyone is gonna be doing it

---
I've been saying Herod/skeram are going to turn into horde pve servers, and the horde Bois just get pissy about it. 
---
This isn't just blizzards fault, were going to have horde dominated servers no matter what because theres just so many more people that bandwagon to play on the horde side in general. We need to get people excited about playing alliance , instead of telling everybody you need to play horde to have any success in pvp
---
Is that common? I've never told DPS to wait for me to stack sunder armor.
---
40-50 in 2 weeks is a fuck load of time investment unless you're following some boring ass leveling guide or doing boring ass spell cleave.

What server?

Yep whitemane
---
You were kicked because you were asked to keep politics out of guild chat, and you continued to drone on and on about it, despite multiple people telling you to stop. Then you went and sperged out in trade chat and likely got yourself chat muted because no one else wanted to listen to you either.
---
Holy shit. Talk about an attention seeker.
---
Holy nova? Wtf
---
It's easier to get into runs as a level 60, so I'd wait for that. Buying the devilsaur set asap can give you a nice boost so you're not too low on dps as a fresh 60.
---
BRD unfortunately has only one pre-BiS for you afaik, and it's savage gladiator chain so not very realistic. I wouldn't bother going there early like some other classes do. You can wait till 56ish, then go there for quest runs (attunements, the bael'gar quest that gives you discount truestrike shoulders).
---
Then I'd go with LBRS to get some decent loot, taming the blackrock worg (best wolf by far, and wolves are nice for party play; cat is generally fine though), getting the quest to kill drakkisath. You can do UBRS after that, to get the guaranteed 2% crit trinket and maybe some other upgrades, but there's not much in the way of pre-BiS in there except truestrike so I wouldn't farm it much. 
---
At 60, there are items you'd want in every dungeon, but either UD strat or DM N would be big priorities. You can solo tribute runs no matter what your gear is, but it's a hard run even with great gear so expect a steep learning curve (and RNG deaths even if you master it)
---
What software are actually being used creating these dank memes?
---
What shoulders is that?
---
I always say all need, that way the last person to input doesn’t ninja. If I win the roll and it’s an upgrade for someone, I just give it to them. Given away 2 epics so far, and have 2 friends I play with frequently because of it

I did clarify it, and downvoting it just because you have no idea about how computers work and that makes you angry isn't really what downvotes are for.

Looks better on a Tauren or Orc.
---
Mainly on bosses only. I’ve seen many mages get 3 hit by Krastinov in Scholo because they didn’t wait
---
No honor in the game... yet people insist of camping lowbies and killing people who clearly have no desire to pvp. If there was honor I’d get it... its just a waste of time until then.

Blame blizzard for making alliance far less cool than horde.

Not if your a troll warrior. I rarely eat, I usually hit 100 faster just standing there than eating. (while leveling of course.)

So much this.  Hemo uses a strong slow MH and fast OH, usually a dagger.
---
Screech is very high-threat. There was this bug on release whereby demo shout for warriors was causing way too much aggro. Considering that screech is similar to demo shout, I'm wondering if it's overtuned for aggro as well and they just never fixed it. It's normal for debuffs to cause threat, but I swear screech is on another level. I had to turn it off in 5-man dungeons because it would out-aggro the warrior's demo shout every time on big packs.
---
I’ll test it out
---
I HATE THIS STUPID FUCKING GAME IN GENERAL. GCD IS SO FUCKING BAD, 1 ABILITY PER SECOND ARE YOU FKING SERIOUS.. WHERE IS THE APM??? TAB TARGETTING GARBAGE. PVP TAKES NO SKILL.

Went back and got Ravager on my hunter after seeing a youtuber talk about it.  Surprisingly useful and definitely worth grabbing even for hunters.

Ok.  But we're talking about Hemo sword spec.  Not combat 😆

Yah hoping the pm crowd has less hate hehe

I play 2-3 hours most nights and I only have a 33(play that with my wife) and a 26.(played solo).  The norm may not be quite as slow as me, but it my guild of like 70 people we only have 2 level 60's.

Can someone explain to me the lockout timer?  I thought i understood it, but just now I have timed my runs, and I started my first run at 7.21 and now on my 6th run at 8.28 I could not enter the instance...  Not a single run was less than 12mins (https://i.imgur.com/GvNFSTZ.png) but I still got hit.
---
2? I’m not even 60 yet on 1

Well flying is still in bfa despite them wanting to remove it.

I like the ui, its nice and simple.

Can confirm. Was on a 8 yr break until last month.
---
Never.
---
That you need moderators. 
---
And you're also assuming that the vocal minority of every sub should be in charge of what content is displayed and not the people who created the sub. End of the day they get to set the theme of the place and if you don't like it you can simply go and create you own. Of course the reason people *don't* do this is that despite arguments such as yours that mods aren't needed? It's a lot of work and people don't want to do it.
---
You need to be fishing after midnight for those numbers.  Otherwise you will be splitting the catches with sunscale salmon.
---
unless you're a troll getting hitcapped is actually quite the struggle as a hunter so blackcrow isnt bad at all

Right, continue.

Getting major old h3h3 vibes from those edits

Doesn't seem to be the case.  I just posted about it here https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/djl1ut/daily_questions_megathread_october_18_2019/f48pfms/

back to back runs, 12 mins or longer, and still locked out on the 6th.

I abandoned my mage at 38 because of how annoying all the pressure to aoe was. It's fun sure but it's like a mages entire fucking identity I went insane and deleted it

The same account invited me to the same gold channel 5 times in about 2 minutes. I whispered the account &amp; said I would kill them in their sleep if they invited me again. I didn’t get invited again.
---
The problem with dagger is if your burst fails to secure a kill then you're at a huge disadvantage because dagger is all burst and low sustain/control compared to hemo.
---
With free transfers, my entire guild left the server that already had around 60-70% horde. I of course, was not home for a week and missed the window of transfering to the server my guild was on. Now, there is still some Alliance left, but the cities are fairly dead even during prime hours. I just made a new character on Faerlina. At least that server will stay populated on both sides due to the streamers.
---
Wow grats. Now go outside and see the real world
---
I would say the vast majority of people don't like actual balanced world PvP encounters and just want to gank lowbies when their bored and then pretend they are badass for rolling on a PvP server where their faction has 90% of the population.
---
Almost every retail PvP server pre Warmode was a glorified PvE server, the same will happen to Classic over time.  Blame Blizz for making 0 effort to combat this for 15 years and counting.
---
Rip dude sorry to hear that
---
Those are actually plantains, not bananas. Common misconception.
---
were living in a society filled with pussies lol
---
Did 40 ubrs runs. Never seen the main hand drop a single time. Buy a sword of zeal, it procs very often and it gives a similar dps to a crusader proc
---
Good point
---
hit is huge since our damage is in slow and large chunks. Getting a few unlucky misses is a large impact on your dps. Missing tranq shot is also never good either.
---
Yes. The burning legion did find the orcs because Kil'Jaedan was following the Draenei from world to world. It was the Orcs however who willing sided with the legion, drinking the blood of Mannorath.
---
While some were deceived into it, the majority of the Orcs still accepted it even after seeing the effects it had. Furthermore it was the Orcs that then took captured civilians and used it to power there end of the Dark Portal. In fact the path leading up to it had so much carnage the bones of the slain Draenei crushed under foot creating what they called the Path of Glory.
---
Then in Demonic fueled rage they sieged Stormwind and we're well on there way to decimating all of Eastern Kingdoms until Guldan got greedy and dipped leaving the orcs without leadership and magic users that were holding the Kingdoms from helping each other, allowing the Alliance to pull a win out. So it's understandable that the alliance views orcs the way they do.
---
Lol you have Onyxia tooth pendant and still greens? Did you not give it to tanks first?
---
you've actually seen one? Afaik there was a bug that prevented the recipe from dropping
---
they do. If DPS take aggro, especially in boss fights they are 2-3 shot which literally only takes a second. Lower levels it doesn’t really matter since a healer can most likely keep anyone up. But past BRD, shit gets real
---
One of the most boring streams I’ve ever seen. 
---
No camera, no mic, no interaction with chat whatsoever. He’ll ban you immediately if you say anything about how desperate he is. 
---
Avoid at all costs.
---
Noob priest, do I ever get any AOE? Fighting more than one mob feels bad and only fighting solo mobs is a little repetitive.
---
That's literally impossible since eating just applies a multiplier to your natural Regen.
---
I have a friend who only plays paladin due to class fantasies(even in other mmo rpgs)... But he tends to quit games pretty quickly if they're too tedious.
---
My other friend and I were thinking about rolling alliance with him as we're Warlock/Rogue players but we came to the conclusion that our paladin friend is going to give up after 10/20 levels due to the levels of running and grinding are a lot more than modern MMO Rpgs. We ended up going Horde. And our paladin friend went over to alliance.
---
He didn't make it to level 10 and although I feel like he would've liked to have leveled with us, with our time schedules being different, this wouldn't have made much difference.
---
In the end, both my warlock friend and I still play and were the faction we prefer.
---
Why are gnomes consistently the kinkiest race?
---
I played vanilla for like 5 seconds, never played retail.
---
It seriously unreasonable to believe someone picked a race because they like how they look?
---
Agreed brother. When I tank I don’t even use a sword. Damage isn’t my job!
---
I'm curious as to if you have some examples of subs/sites in general that have zero moderation and *don't* just turn into a collection of low effort posts, memes, and whatever else?
---
They allowed transfers AWAY from more populated servers, not to it.
---
Are you playing on a CRT?

Oh yeah, I'm in the same vein. I just calculated the odds for the server at large instead of the group. As you can see meeting another lock with the same name for the imp is already above 50% if you meet 30 other locks or more during your plays. The trick is of course that the other player would have to have their pet summoned for you to know. And you too.
---
I love the original Star Fox music
---
I really wanted to hate this, but I fucking loved it. 10/10 on the execution. Memes where perfectly timed and that skuffed titanic themed outro had me lol
---
I wanted to do this too, found this great [video](https://youtu.be/exh-niEWk-E), however it looks like rep values were changed in classic and it’s not quite viable anymore. That said someone in the comments stated they started at lvl 1 with a human in the NE starting zone and by lvl 40 they had gotten just into revered so maybe by 60 it could be done
---
Pft you’ll be pulling people from his group when they see a tank advertising for the same dungeon.
---
I've done it all and am at 3000/21000. So no ;) cloth is the way
---
Slut.
---
This is what I do. I’ll use Doomshot if I have it but I’m not willing to go out of my way for it. I can at least mine thorium while I’m just running around doing stuff.

That would make more sense from a min/maxing sense. The guild is very casual though and lets everyone spec and gear as they want. The content is so easy right now anyway.
---
I haven’t touched Retail since Classic came out. Logged in to check my Alabaster mounts (got the 15th anniversary CE) and that was it. I probably won’t be back for 8.3 either honestly. I just wanna do Classic shit! It’s everything I wanted it to be. I’d love to see a return to more traditional RPG elements in Retail.

Was in one of the few guilds clearing BT on arthas in BC.  It is 100 %assumed you are rolling for the spec you are there as unless stated otherwise and it has been like that in evrery group I have been a part off since the. Obviously your take wasn't the norm just based off the number of people that disagre with tou here.
---
“Would you mind telling me who the fuck you are? Besides someone who feeds people to pigs o’course.”
---
CREATIVE WRITING. I HATED THAT DAMN CLASS!
---
Most people on a PvP server don't play there because they want to kill 10v1 or get killed 1v10. They're there for when it's a confrontation that isn't decided before it started. For the little skirmishes that turn into fights. For the thrill that you'll have wherever you go, just like OP described.
---
"pVp oN a PvP sErVeR" is a really bad argument against faction imbalance that basically eradicates the thing you signed up for - which PvE servers don't solve either.
---
Yeah that’s why I said it takes a lot of stranger trust, pretty unrealistic stranger trust. In my opinion the person requesting the trade should take the risk of getting screwed.
---
Yeah, but idiots like that keep the rogues employed.
---
is there any resource you guys know of for finding out about where to acquire gear upgrades while leveling? sort of like a BiS for certain levels? i’ve tried wowhead but it’s just somewhat overwhelming for options
---
Yes, they laid off a lot of of their in-house support, it's likely that most of the support tickets are now being dealt with by indian call centers
---
Nice.
---
Have you tried GetHitModifier API command with and without the scope?
---
it was 2 days ago and a random pug. I unfortunately dont remember the name.
---
I’ve been playing since 2004 and I didn’t even know this was a service they offered.
---
They shouldn’t offer it in cases like yours. You made a choice. You should have to live with it. That’s part of an RPG
---
just so everyone is aware, form a specific group for this quest. it's actually really easy and short. get the debuff, hearth, GG. 
---
still not worth it but I know how some of you weirdos are so if you must do it, this is how
---
He got booted before there was time to take a screenshot... of a chat log...
---
You're thinking of hunters, bro.
---
Cracked and bought Krol. Was only 50g more
---
Also, it won’t work if there’s any enemy AoE happening, but this can be such a clutch skill if someone pulls an extra mob, since you can pull off one and freeze them. It’s saved my group multiple times in UBRS.
---
Good mages are a pleasure to group with.
---
Probably because they are shills for China.
---
If things are tight for you, man, I can Venmo you like 10 bucks for a pizza or some groceries.

Pet mouse wheel binds make your life so much easier, you should give it a try.

i’d say a profession
---
If you are a true min/maxer, Bloodaxe Worg isn’t the best wolf.
---
Slavering Worg from SFK (lvl19) and Deathmaw from Burning Steppes (lvl53 rare) are tied for best wolf. They have the highest attack speed of all wolves which is 1.2. Yes DPS is averaged out but if you have frenzy, it’s not. They are also the best wolves for PvP due to spell pushback.
---
Bloodaxe Worg has slower attack speed but has max rank furious howl and bite SO to min/max you have to tame a Bloodaxe, learn its top rank skills, then teach those top rank skills to one of the 2 worgs mentioned above.
---
They did not have name changes as a service before TBC.
---
The candies you get from the quests only last 14 days but can give you handy buffs like slowfall/waterwalking/faster swim speed/underwater breathing.

are you an idiot? 6% is the hit cap for level 60 mobs
---
Nice. Nice. Nice.
---

---
They didn’t nurf DM, it’s vanilla 1.12 dm, private servers were incorrect. 
---
Mages farming lashers with herbalism can still make 50-65g an hour.
---
The best pvp healer ever
---
So you found the Onyxia side of the quest quite easy by comparison of the 800g you spent? Gosh, I would pay someone to help me with Onyxia lol
---
Boosting zf
---
Why don't you just cap your hit and then see if you get any misses?
---
Noob question: would the rotation here be frost nova &gt; flamestrike &gt; blast wave &gt; then blizzard if the mobs are not dead by then?
---
That just brought back memories I didn’t even know I had
---
its called titan panel
---
Man, I really need to buy houseplants for my apartment. Makes it seem so much more lively.
---
Any guild that did this was not serious about itemization at all.
---
OP I take it you are also referring that is currently the case right? https://imgur.com/a/4cRjoBy 
---
And I don't think its just a tooltip error as I mostly play ST personally and am 51 but Frost nova followed by Frost bolt + fire blast back to back usually deal double crit for me.
---
In groups also FN followed by Arcane Explosion or Flamestrike usually yields a lot of crits.
---
It’s the kinda guy u feel bad u even wasted a renew on him after that
---
It’s definitely viable to heal BRD as a shadow, just as the guy messaging you thought... I’m totally fucking missing the funny part sorry.
---
Why do you give Hunter weapon to main tank? Are you dumb?

What did you do to get bad rep? Curious
---
That little AHH on the Immolate made me laugh so hard.
---
why dont you know that the mob he was hitting was level 60 and 6% is hitcapped already?
---
So now he's Dovakin thu'uming his nerd rage?
---
That’s exactly what tanking feels like. I’m constantly trying to dummy-proof every pull: LoS, small packs, 💀, ❌,🌜, but DPS seem to find a way.
---
I really thought I was the only blind one. I feel better now
---

git gud and farm dme with satyrs included for 60-70g per hour.

I still farm lashers because I’m an herbalist and arcane specced. Don’t really want to respecc everytime I go out to farm stuff. So lasher is the way to go for me.

Haha nice. I guess I should have assumed there was an add-on. That's awesome. Definitely will check that out.
---
Cast Intimidation for pet if he drops aggro or if you're worried about it. For mobs that seem troublesome, ride your autoshot mostly and use Arcane Shot sparingly or use a lower ranked Arcane Shot.
---
Blame streamers. Not blizzard.
---
You chose to roll on Herod. Nobody made you.
---
That's a common misconception, Paladins do in fact have a 100% chance to roll need on Plate gear whenever you are playing your warrior.
---
Every warlock is kill on sight for me
---
I would say get it as soon as you can.
---
 Depending on if you have friends etc it may be hard to get ravager and you can use WW axe from LVL 30.
---
I enjoy the quest part of it too and the accomplished feeling.
---
You won't replace the we axe till after 40(ravager is the same not an upgrade except for air farm) so it's a good investment
---
That said you can just roll greens n quest rewards to 60
---
FUCK PALADINS. OVERPOWERED PIECE OF SHIT HEALER CLASS LITERALLY IMMUNE TO CC OR DAMAGE NO COUNTERPLAY.
---
Approval to not play?! You just dodged a bullet, dude. 😂

You can’t get TF for the current content anyway
---
You want it for progression when “harder” stuff comes out
---
But yeah w/e guilds can do what they want with 2nd TF, they probably won’t even the first one before AQ
---
I'm pretty sure they are considered strong tanks for 5mans. Don't expect to tank raids though.
---
I have a 60 and 55 on a PvP server and a 50 on a PvE server. 
---
PvE servers are not easy mode. None of the shit people say about PvP servers being "the real game" is true.
---
If you’re on heartseeker, I don’t know if you’re tied to luminous in some way but their leader straight up ninja looted in MC. They lost a bunch of members after that and booted most for complaining. I know you can’t witch hunt here but just letting you know in case you were planning to stick around.
---
Cool I got tank
---
Yeah.. just sucks that now I want to play higher level instances that I have to run around begging... :(
---
Doesn't arcane shot count Spell hit and not regular hit? It scales with spell damage
---
*That's the joke.jpeg*
---
I get it, but you and whoever decides to take you up on the gold offer can get in trouble for purchasing gold. I’d rather throw a sub your way because I like to be nice sometimes and not receive gold in exchange.
---
Welp I'm saving that tab. Thank you!
---
Most guilds arent that sweaty
---
Unless you're getting carried to it, it's generally not even worth getting due to the time it takes to complete.
---
Axe is amazing at 30, it's a bit above average at 36-37 when the quest becomes plausible to solo. At this point, there are more accessible options. So unless you plan to get help you're honestly better off skipping the questline, it's a bit of a new player trap
---
Wasup Zardoz
---
to be fair, if its fearable its soloable. and that definitely is fearable.
---
i too have played starfox before
---
Am I the only one that just takes the 2 seconds to type Deadmines?
---
I’ve yet to be ganked by any horde on my server ever so it must only be alliance who ganks!
---
I kinda want to know where to get all this for tmog I’m retail.
---
Unfair if they're good.
---
Except
---
You need an sub tank for the last boss, he puts the tank to sleep and it's not dispellable
---
So pally or warr
---
 a good rogue or hunter will suffice but a "good" one isnt a dime a dozen
---
And no I wasnt leader
---
But I did have the warrior removed after he ninja the loot
---
You just suck. Look at the other replies, hunter owns in pvp.
---
If you are a fresh 60 and looking to do pvp and some dungeons / raids but not super serious about either I have seen a spec that is combat/sub to include blade flurry and some hit from combat and also have hemo and prep from combat. You can move certain points around how you feel necessary and it looks like a solid spec to run at this point of the game.
---
People like you are why this game is already losing an ass ton of players. What is the point of sitting there wasting someone else’s time, when you don’t even get honor for it? You’re a fucking idiot.
---
You can still get an enchanter to enchant your stuff, you just have to actually look for them rather than just buy a scroll on the AH
---
And why would that be a bad idea? Hunters are top 3-4 in pvp, great class.
---
./use [mount]
---
./cancelaura [mount buff name] 
---
Gives you the retail quality of life!
---
Going Oom in Classic.. kek
---
You need improved flamestrike.
---
My rule of thumb when I wpvp is if I can see what level they are and am not currently busy with something else, attack them in the name of the horde. Do they outlevel me? Yes. Attack. Do they outnumber me? Yes. Attack. Am I trying to finish this quest I've been grinding for a half hour? Yes. Eh let em go... Did they tag my quest mob(s)? Yes... ATTACK and /spit!
---
Because as a healer and a tank you can pretty much always find a group so putting myself in a position to do both meaning I can get into more instances quicker and get greater versatility from my class.
---
So You can buy enchants on the AH ?
---
That's the worst thing I've ever saw!
---
They are probably just the most popular class and therefore more likely there are assholes.
---
+1
---
Making other people miserable makes them feel less miserable about themselves.
---
Not related at all. We're on Earthshaker EU, and the GM is super nice.
---
Horses suck.
---
No you have to find an enchanter to do it in the trade window.
---
"this activity is not fun or worthwhile because I am not being rewarded for doing it"
---
That's you, pal.
---
Those are all wrong. I followed them on my gnome and by the time I was level 60 I still needed 16000 rep with Darnassus. They all used wrong pserver values.  I did every quest in every zone that gave Darnassus rep. It makes it that much more impressive to do it by 45. There must be more Stormwind rep avai6or it starts higher.
---
Sure, so what's the drop rate?

I don't join these groups at all on whitemane even if I don't need any items. I've spoken to a bunch of people about the no reserve life because it just.. makes me so annoyed to see it.

Only other prob on Whitemane currently is the insane amount of bribing you have to do to get tanks to do anything.
---
LFG from a size of 50-100 ppl online in ur guild or LFG from a size of 2000-4000 ppl...
---
tell me which ull think have easier time finding people
---
I can only play, I cannot play play. :(
---
Yeah I gotta say, the Blitzchung decision got me and about 6 other people I play with to all quit. Doesn’t make my cravings go away, though.
---
Just have to maintain distance.  If they blink in, scatter.  Hope for stun proc on conc.  Anticipate the blink and try to position trap.  If they blow cold snap, they'll probably get you.  As you get more gear, you really come into your own.  I've AS/auto/MS combo'd quite a few mages, but that's with 5/8GS and Rhok.
---
It will not change, believe me.
---
5 fewer steps for mages ;)
---
Kind of, I understand your confusion and I get that a lot of what I’m saying makes sense in my own head and is hard to explain but the story that the npc’s tell you in game is what they want you to know not necessarily what is actually happening. So tidal wave comes and an npc tells you that’s deathwings fault, go and kill him but deathwing has followers that hold an opposite view and they truly believe that they are right, just as much as you believe that your player character does no wrong but sometimes you have to be wrong, unless your character is somehow infallible. I take every quest in wow with a grain of salt because every quest giver has a motive that they may not be telling you.
---
You lose a stupid amount of damage by not going Asa. Cold Blood is a must have for duels because of how ridicuulst OP it is.

Pretty sure you can solo it easily. I soloed it on my first try as soon as I could get the quest, just kept him feared and used pet as mana battery.
---
heavily inconvenience people that roll on a highly imbalanced server
---
1. if faction balance is 70/30 shorten res timers by 40% for the underdog, increase it by 40% for the other  
---
2. increase the repair costs. devalue items being vendored. slow down the flightpath mounts. allow only 3 dungeon resets per hour  
---
3. go REALLY crazy, add a world pvp debuff. you ever mean a member of the opposing faction and you're both alone? well he gets to whup your ass 
---
there's so much you can do to TRY and even up balance
---
it's a shame they will do **NOTHING**
---
Was hoping to see Whitemane in here! Represent!! Actually not a whole lot of drama Horde side on Whitemane
---
Was that a Vectorman reference LOL
---
Just a big ol loser trying to feel good by being a dick. Bet you’re super fun irl too. Probably about 5 foot, 300 lbs and as threatening as a prepubescent bitchboy. Go back to ganking people half your level so you can stroke that little peen.
---
Thanks my guy
---
You're right, dead server
---
Hell yeah, thank you haha
---
u got me there mb
---
I dont think it's the real game. Being able to opt out of pvp objectively makes the game easier. Not much more to it.

IM JUMPING RIGHT ON THIS PALADIN HATE WAGON. HOW FUCKING PATHETIC OF A CLASS CAN YOU BE TO HAVE THREE FUCKING LIVES AND STILL BE CONSIDERED BALANCED AGAINST OTHERS. NO SERIOUSLY THINK ABOUT THAT.  THEY NEED TWO EXTRA FULL HEALTH BARS TO WIN A FIGHT. IF YOU HAPPEN TO DIE ITS USUALLY FROM BORDEOM FROM HAVING TO FIGHT THEM FOR 10 MINUTES. GOD FORBID THERE ARE TWO AND YOU SPEND HALF AN HOUR NEARLY KILLI G THEM OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

I agree that was a total cop out but that is where the story is now and bolvar has motives that may not have been Arthas’ or even nerzhuls and maybe non of them are in control of the scourge and the scourge just need a proud soul to be sacrificed every 30 or so years to keep it in check. The story is evolving as we see it and some of the things we hear/see seem permanent but change as the story changes just like in real life.

Some folks in my guild and I were drunk after raid one night and started a party with some campfires in IF, and several joined in. Then RP walked to the tram, ride it to SW and partied near the big tree by the AH. We ended up doing the Windsor escort with 2 different random people, RP walking the whole way. Imagine you just start walking into SW with Windsor and 10-15 people RP walk right up to you and /kneel, then walk with you the whole way. A random lv 3 said it was his first time playing wow and asked wtf we were doing. Some of us may or may not have gotten naked, too.. haha. 
---
The game is really what you make of it.
---
Yeah its easier to get to THorium point and get ganked, i always take the Steppes way while atleast 1 party member dies upon landing
---
Do you run a PVE spec? How are you pulling aggro with a mindblast with 40% threat reduction unless your tank is sitting on his fingers. 
---
Trash: dot (if more than 10K hp) MF-MB-MF
---
Boss: Yes let your tank build some aggro, typical boss fight for me is: wait for first sunder -&gt;SWP-&gt;MF-&gt;second sunder is usually up by then and it's cruising MB-MF-MF-MB.. Just be mindful when/if the tank get stunned or CCed as obviously their aggro is on pause in the meantime.
---
Yeah but it’s been proven many many times rank 1 glad doesn’t mean shit in classic.
---
Or 2, my server rattlegore had it up on the AH one night for 2200g and it was gone the next morning.
---
Cold Blooded is overrated, while it takes the chance out of Evis it doesn't actually provide a DPS increase on all Evis. Also, if you watched any of the duels from Rogues you'd notice the damage wasn't their issue at all not even close it was their ability to control the duels Rogues can't 100-0 in fights where people are on Equal gear levels meaning a stun lock combo isn't good enough right now sustained burst and control is where the game is out for duels having ways to stop others gameplans. Sure Cold Blood Evis si super strong when you can 100-0 someone within your stun lock but if you can't or if you're against a mage what are you gonna do? Pop everything and hope? This build allows more counter play in alot of match ups where you see Rogues struggle.
---
some guy is giving away the warlock mount for free. u whisp him, he invs u, u go to DM west and get the mount. free of charge.
---
every other warlock trying to sell that service is pissed
---
Not great conduct from the mage, but to be fair, it sounds like you could have either explained why you couldn’t heal them/they were wrong or just apologised. You were both complicit in dragging out this affair.
---
Herbs are good price on my server but sadly I dont have herb. I heard the lashers also got nerfed, doesn't drop as many items as in vanilla

Yeah I will never join or make a reserve group or pay a tank that’s not how this game works
---
Plot twist, the Druid was the healer and the priest was shadow.
---
ya but if ur the healer, u can't ress more than 1 person every 30 mins and that slows the group down a lot
---
Nice gameplay - would you be able to link the song by chance?
---
My experience with the boats in Classic wow has been interesting. It seems as long as you are close enough to the boat it will drag you along for the ride.
---
Something similar happened to me last week.  I was afk on a zep.  Came back just as it was leaving Durotar.  I didn't want to make the round trip again, so I jumped off the zepp just as it zoned.  I was then teleported under EK and was flying along at a couple hundred miles per hour underground from Wetlands to Blasted Lands and back.  Then I zoned into Kalimdor and flew from Distwallow to Felwood and back.  It matched the zep timer.  It's like my body was connected/tethered to the zep still, but on the opposite end of some long tether.

26/25 seems to be the consensus, PI PvE wise is mostly good for speed clears, it’s pretty good in pvp however.
---
It has 32 million views on Youtube.
---
Great name.
---
It is fearable, I never said anything about diminishing returns, I did death coil, it has a 2min cooldown, I did void sac.  No matter what you want to think, some things won't just stay permanently feared with no resists and unlimited death coils. 
---
Why didn't you just go ahead and solo it at 50 then? I would love to see it. At 52 I'm sure its doable, I had him fairly close but you have to have everything go your way.
---
And, whether or not its soloable is not the point of the post.
---
Sure but if you're in a guild where everyone is min maxing and getting worlds buffs. Your tank is gonna have to min max as well so dps arent limited by your threat.
---
You don't need the buff, think of it as a nice bonus.
---
go fury and offtank dungeons. people wont notice. then dps when raid time
---
Or just leave the system as it is
---
Yeah they can't get away when you have an epic mount and they're level 20. I kill people 3-4 times until they log off.

If you played since 2004 and never had a quest item restored to you its probably because you play on Argent Dawn and live in Goldshire inn.

When you transfered servers you had the option to change your name.
---
Badass way to ding 60
---
Of course I do, I would never open a conversation with someone by calling them shit. I've tanked plenty in Classic and I've had to explain to dps players how aggro works. And now that I'm devoted to playing as a dps, I find that there are a lot of lazy tanks who thinks that all they need to do is mark skull and that's it. 
---
Listen this thing got way out of hand, I'm just trying to point out that tanks can be in the wrong as well. I've played every role extensively in many different games, and the margin of error is largely the same between everyone whether it's a tank, healer, dps or otherwise.
---
We could have battlegroups with a mix of PvP and PvE servers.
---
homie with an extra chromie
---
They 100% had paid server transfers before TBC. There was just also a lot of free ones off high pop servers

Why would you be mad that's awesome that you found out!

Grats! To the hunter who got it

You want to switch to MM when you're doing more dungeons than solo farm.

Picture-in-picture Netflix using the Windows 10 app.
---
Yeah, it's pointless to have a convo with someone who can't provide a reason for his points other than"it does more damage" Rogue doesn't 100-0 on equal geared players I never argued it did less damage but in the end it allows for more damage. If you kick a mage before they blink they can't do anything and you get a GCD which you wouldn't ahve been able to do before which results in more damage. You think that everyone who takes improved kick gets faked out a lot, does that mean players who take improved counterspell get faked out a lot too? No, not at all that logic is awful they use improved counterspell to prevent so they can set up their next cast. This is the same logic.

I should rephrase, is the max I can get for the + to all 650 by 40? Or is wowhead missing stuff?
---
That game was my jam! Along with Treasure Cove, Gizmos and Gadgets, Operation Neptune, and Ancient Empires
---
Bring a Shadow Priest, Ret/Prot Paladin, Shaman DPS and the problem is solved
---
A few questions:
---
* Should I buy the [Eveengreen Pouch](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11020/evergreen-pouch) and use it on cooldown? Can I even buy it right now at 44? Or do you need to be 47 to even purchase it for the Morrowgrain quest, or do the two have nothing to do with eachother (ex. can the bag be used at level 1?). Is it worth buying soil on the auction house and just using it on cooldown?
---
* Should I wait till I'm 60, have completed every thunderbluff quest in the game, THEN turn in Runecloth as a last resort?
---
* Let's say I reach 10-25% into exaulted after all that. Exactly how much money would you estimate getting to exaulted would cost?
---
Raid Shadow Legends, Final Fantasy Mobius or Dragonball Dokkan Battle on my phone while Fishing in Game.
---
Weapons are normalized, but instant attacks still benefit from weapons that have a higher average damage. Whether that benefit makes up for a potential loss in overall weapon DPS is a case by case thing.
---
Why don’t you start preparing for the honor grind?
---
I know you aren’t 300 Goblin engineer, with all the BoP Gnomish trinkets already crafted, and 300 Sapper Charges &amp; 500 Iron Grenades.
---
Don’t come here with that ‘nothing to do’ BS when your a filthy casual who is going to get farmed hardcore come Phase 2.
---
sorry, i don't really know. i just responded yes because i've seen them in MC raids and they seem to do a boatload of damage
---
In my experience as a tank, this is true as well. The worst one I've had so far, was a warlock with like 100 shadow spell power in ZF. It's one of the least pleasant experiences of my life, and I've broken a rib before.
---
just like smoking
---
K
---
It just depends if you lose an extra cast from that 5 energy. I know on a full energy bar hemo gets 1 more cast than SS but idk how it'd work rotating them.
---
Nice video, appreciate the detailed narration. 
---
Having to respec is a pretty significant cost unless you really want to go hard on this though. You ever trying bringing restorative pots and burning him down with a raid spec? Problem is restorative pots are ~3g so that's 6g an hour down the drain and youd have to kill him pretty darn fast to only need one.
---
There’s an entire mage guide on wowhead classic, it’s fantastic. It literally has everything on there that you would need. Just google mage guide wowhead classic
---
Yupppp, my guild knows I'm fury and they're just thrilled I'm willing to tank dungeons for them...
---
Best part of the week is flying over barrens to Duskwallow, just to catch up with the boyssss.
---
Them heals though.
---
Make sure you're really getting the hang of your rotation. Even if aimed shot is off cooldown don't use it until RIGHT AFTER your auto attack. And yes, hit chance is very important. Not only for dps, but missing a tranq shot can easily cause a wipe.
---
Should be fine, especially now that DM is out with Mugger's Belt and Distracting Dagger.
---
It isn’t the VERY best for either role, but you don’t lose much to do it.
---
For tanking you lose out on Omen of Clarity/+10% physical damage 
---
For healing you lose out on your two oh-shit buttons
---
how do you get control of world chat lol?
---
I don't even play Rogue, but i have a lot of knowledge of the class since I used to play Rogue, I'm a Druid player so I don't get faked sorry :(
---
banana sure is spelled funny in WoW
---
As a hunter, the last panel pretty much sums it up. Feign death should have the picture of a possum XD
---
Or just don't wipe :)
---
Why? You can't get it until p3 anyways.
---
Not everyone values PvP as much as you do, you’d do well to respect that.
---
What add-on gives all that info at the top of the screen
---
Here's what I do, I charge in, auto attack the boss to gain rage, wait for someone to aggro, I taunt, shieldblock and revenge, then I start sunder.
---
The taunt would put you in the same threat level as the person aggroed and the rage you saved would put you in a decent theat lead over everybody.
---
Also, priority revenge over everything else as it generates most threat.
---
I got 2 points in and I've seen it proc.
---
pm me nudes
---
THIRTEEN
---
I pretty much only use it on myself in a tough spot feels like a waste most the time trying to use it on someone but there have been a few occasions
---
Yeah
---
I don’t need any more dungeon gear on my Druid but I still pimp myself out for some gold or to reserve loot for a guildy
---
Fantastic name
---
Solution is to remove world buffs in raid and pvp instances, also increases longevity of the game
---
This, if it was available already, there would be hundreds of people with it already.
---
So yeah, you need to tame another pet that already knows the spell you are looking for. Petopia is a great resource for this. You can stable the rake and then tame the pet with your desired skills/spells. Once you do this, you wanna use that pet for a bit and make them use those abilities so that they appear in your “pet training” codex thing. Then you can teach them to the rake. Hope that makes sense :)
---
Horde guild named Toxic on Kromcrush filled with ninja looters like Undie.
---
As a prot paladin, I know how you feel.
---
BRD is very hard to get a full run for, and to complete it with saving the princess. To me it's your first "real dungeon." Also one of my favorites in the game, the slaves groaning, the cum guzzler and bar fight, all great.
---
Everyone just wanting to farm or do their specific runs, meant I've done BRD dozens of times but a full clear? twice.
---
Once you realize you'll be spending the next 3 hours with these people, group composition is pretty strong and I don't mean classes/races.
---
I see, well why are you worrying about making gold when you're level 44. Hit 60.
---
Ya know I was going to make a comment on pally tanking, but he is absolutely right. Pally tanking is suffering and shouldn’t even be listed as an option.
---
All the pugs I see reserve it. I got lucky to get it after both our main tanks did.
---
usually what I do is wonder how I was the last one to join the group and still the first person to make it there.
---
Quoting yourself doesn’t make you suddenly not wrong.
---
I think we’re done here.
---
Screw you man hes #teamedward means he loves the sparkly vampire in all forms including wizard
---
If you aren’t a Fury Warrior Id just go with Cadaverous instead. Might lose out on a few top end dps but it’s worth it for the less shitty farm
---
You're talking about a different audience. I'm asking you if you actually think people upvoting in a sub called *gamesdiscussion* would actually upvote memes instead of discussion.
---
If you genuinely think that, I think you're a massive pessimist.
---
“There’s nothing to do” - sounds like there is plenty to do and you are simply choosing not to. 
---
Makes your post seem pretty retarded.
---
I mean I get it, I always give water/food when in grps, but for perspective; I had a guy constantly tagging my mobs, when confronted he just repeated ‘water pls’.
---
That should tell you enough.
---
I did that the other, I glad it's a thing
---
Heck yeah there are! I love the armored boars in RFK. Also, once you hit 60, there are these like, undead (?) boars in EPL. I think they are the coolest looking pet in the game!
---
lmao
---
Wait until it's gotten 2 growls off before attacking.
---
This is why I pick pocket every mob at the start of the pull before going ham.
---
Also means I can cheap shot a cast so win win
---
Farming is not ”fun” and has never been. Even if I wanted to do PvP right now there’s nothing in it for me because there is no honor system in place.
---
Didn’t check if this is already here but:

Also don’t bother with enchants until you get really late 50s gear because you will just replace that item
---
If they're on mobile there is a bug that will say it didn't post so they'll do it again but it did post so then they just post it twice
---
someone really that mad they created a website for him lmfao
---
It doesn’t cost a lot to respec. I respec for each raid and for mara farming etc.

You'll just have to take your own self assurance as fact on that one. There's not going to be a situation where you ever get to see if you're right.
---
It doesn't, but it's also kinda pointless to say "do this" when I gave reason for why "this" doesn't work in the previous post...
---
&gt;People will post illegal content,
---
 How is this not reddit's job to moderate? They're a MASSIVE company with fucktons of resources relying on slave labor to filter out illegal content.
---
\&gt; or groups of people will push content against the subs original intent to the top repeatedly and drive away users etc. 
---
This feels like confirmation bias. There's no way this happens every time. If I started a sub called gamesdiscussion, what do you see it turning into if unmoderated?
---
While I disagree with OP, there are much more tactful ways to do it without sounding like a complete child, which I am assuming you are. Maybe you should go outside and learn how to interact with other humans beings and maybe you can be more appropriate. Flaming and name calling off the bat makes everything you say illegitimate.
---
Now all you need is some fish oil and a couple of journaleros
---
In your spellbook in the general tab there's a little slingshot looking stick. That's your pet spellbook. If you want to teach your pet new abilities you'll find them there.
---
So to give it a new attack ability, put your pet in the stable, tame an animal that knows it, use that animal in one combat, you'll get a thing that says "you learned X", now you can abandon that pet and teach that ability to your normal pet.
---
In WoW Vanilla (and Classic now, I’m assuming), even up until Wrath, players incurred an exp penalty if a higher-leveled player even touched a mob in the open world (dungeons incurred a lesser penalty but still had one).
---
I haven't been able to get into a single DM-W run yet.  I am just going to make a group of 5 healers and we will keep running until we all get what we want.
---
Mograines not too bad, but you see 90% of the alliance faction are in ironforge where as 90% of the horde are outside UBRS on the balcony, easy to get the numbers messed up
---
r/iamverybadass
---
little bit of both
---
i went from Thrash to Mass of McGowan to Viskag 
---
TBH IMO everyone is to focused on swords, there are some solid maces out there Mass of McGowan, Bonechill hammer, cruel hand of timmy, bashgooder, they make excellent weapons and will do just fine in MC/ony. much easier to get and you wont be rolling against 7 other people in UBRS for them
---
That's sad.
---
You will need healing once you pull aggro from DoTting everything.
---
I dunno, I've been unemployed since July and can sit in a fucking chair 12h/day if I want, and I still have shit to do in game. Maybe I'd have run out of things to do if DM hadn't come out, but even so, there's a lot of gold to be farmed. I needed about 2500g for all the stuff I wanted, plus professions and pre-bis. So far I've put 22 days into this shit and I'm only now starting to approach the point where I'd have to get creative in order to find reasons to stay online.
---
Do you have full pre-bis, including expensive BoE items?  
---
Are they all fully enchanted with librams and everything?  
---
Do you have a secondary set of PvP gear?  
---
Do you have epic mount and 2x 300/300 profs?  
---
Do you have 4x Traveler's Backpack, full bank slots, etc.?
---
Have you farmed a month's worth of raid consumables ahead of time?
---
It took my unemployed ass a month and a half to fill out that checklist, and I'm still missing one item. If you feel like you've run out of things to do, either you're putting in more than 12h/day and thus have no grounds for complaint, or you're missing something you could be working on.
---
Nobody hard casts until they come across a braindead rogue who uses kick for a 2 sec blanket silence.
---
Titanbars or something like that
---
I'm not sure I understand what you are trying to say. Mind rephrasing?
---
Can someone explain weapon normalisation? Speed normalisation? Damage normalisation? Keep seeing it regarding warriors but don't get it
---
Not my proudest fap.
---
i checked the wiki and it seems to be the case, but i have no idea how the penalty is calculated. I'm planning to use my 60 druid to boost a level 10 hunter since i need a hunter to do maraudon faster, but i think the penalty will be so bad that's it's better to just do it with my hunter.
---
OP is a retard. Move along, nothing to see here.
---
The best!
---
Mongoose Bite and Counterattack are flat damage. Running in for a quick Raptor Strike when a Horde group's got a Windfury Totem down is amazing with slow weapons.
---
No.  It’s a big ole dumpster fire. 
---
Expect nothing good from this company atm.
---
Thanks. Does it show the time remaining in a number format or is that a different add on?
---
Yup. I also see a few people trying to sneak a few kills/skins at wee morning hours and undersell the mafia in trade chat which is great.
---
Just have to change up your mentality, you're not a babysitter at all. You are 2 manning the dungeon with a healer, the 'help' is the DPS. That's all they are, nothing more. Keep the healer alive, worry less about the dps.
---
So, you don't dispute anything I've said and that's all you can say is that? You're a troll lol.
---
I play almost exclusively with the same group of 15 people that I have played with for the last 14 years. 
---
My warrior has a sunrazor, my healer is a druid. We're gonna be alright.
---
Be warned, I **haven't tried this with Rank 1 hex**, but pulling everything, freezing, then hexing guarantee's you enough time for everything. Hexing beforehand can cause some slight issues if you don't pull the pack fast enough.
---
So true
---
Invicta?
---
There is nothing to dispute. Your frankenstein spec is beyond atrocious. But how could you know if you don’t play a rogue.
---
You seem like a sad person. Maybe find something to do that gives your life some meaning?
---
EVERY SINGLE FUCKING CLASS HAS SOMETHING FUCKING BUSTED ABOUT THEM WHICH IS KIND OF HILARIOUS BUT ALSO MILDLY IRRITATING EXCEPT FOR YOU, WARRIORS, YOURE ALRIGHT
---
Clearly you don’t have any 🤷‍♂️
---
The very last fight that rogue probably broke his keyboard over his brothers head who was right next to him watching you own his ass after he died. Damn that was a nice turn around!
---
At this point aren’t you treating the game more like a job than a game?
---
I'm saying that if your tank has any idea what he's doing, mobs will have gift of arthas, which again makes attack speed relevant.

It's basically some math that determines how a weapon benefits from attack power. This is a pretty decent explanation:

---
Thank you!! I saw another person do it on this sub
---
Agreed. But HoJ can be a bitch to get. The DM trinket is super easy.
---
Its just the engr shield that breaks a lot requiring multiples. Not any other shield.
---
Didn't think I'd have enough time to raid but a promotion at work came with some pretty good consistent schedule that would allow for it. Things changed.
---
I would have been fine tanking Dungeons and the odd raid as a healer for 2 years when I only had 4-5 hours a week to play.
---
A traveler backpack just dropped in Scholo this morning for me
---
Just to add to this, have your mocking blow macro on a persistent bar so you can always see the cooldown
---
Only if you are reliably fucking up. Most of the time is going to be spent tanking given the shortage.
---
As someone leveling a shadow priest to not raid with... I came here hoping for this comment.
---
I said I would rather quit than level again, calm down.
---
I haven’t seen the rogue book yet. Rogues should farm hoj relentlessly.
---
ok i found it! https://www.reddit.com/r/StreamersGoneWild/comments/djmhte/lisa_stpeach/
---
How good are druids at lvl 60? How do they fare solo? What about in 5 man groups and raids?
---
I'm only a level 31 druid but this is my exact plan. Tank 5/10 mans and OT/Heal raids. Can the 0/30/21 spec allow you to do both in raids all the way through phase 4? Or do you eventually have to spec full feral or resto to do well in the later raids?
---
You're gear is also cheap as fuck to repair though.
---
Plate is 2x as much to fix as leather. All the tanks I know actually lose money on every dungeon run unless we funnel them BoP's that no one needs
---
Thanks, I hate it
---
Wtf lol
---
And that’s fair. I’ve only ever been 2 shot a handful of times lol. The tanks I roll with know my ways by now and we just have a laugh.
---
I know, I'm just being "internet" funny :)
---
Boomkin moods
---
You def took my comment the wrong way. I don't understand what you meant by your previous comment, so I asked if you could elaborate.
---
Are you saying that far worse stuff gets removed within a few minutes of posting, therefore it's understandable that the bananas post made it to the front page?
---
I hope you mean 200 gold
---
That no longer works anymore it won’t let you make a name with that deleted characters name anymore
---
My warrior bud and I literally had the horde in ungoro create a raid group to hunt down the 2 of us.
---
 11 v 2... just wow.. haha.
---
Same boat man, I've got a newborn on the way as well. I'm level 37 with the 10 hours on a good week.
---
I don’t get it. As a tank Druid I can go non stop instancing IVF I want to, I have 3 full sets of gear. Why would I want to tank for some pugs if I don’t need any gear?
---
I get what I want to make it worth my time, you save 30-minutes to an hour. Win win.
---
Tigers are still better tho.
---
That's actually cheaper in money
---
This sounds made up.
---
Yes, you could also kidney shot and then potentially get a BS in. Unfortunately it's not an efficient use of energy, and it doesn't overcome the anemic DPS. I mean you *can* do it, I actually did it myself 15 years ago when I was a fresh-faced rogue.
---
Honestly if you want to play with daggers, I'd suggest sucking it up and leveling combat reach 60 fast, then you'll have access to all sorts of dagger builds.
---
Chests are basically just refrigerators. Change my mind!
---
Now RAMS - that's what I'm talkin bout!
---
Is there a problem? Do you think you need to be all pre-bis before you're "allowed" to roll on gear?

Horde on incendius since launch, after seeing all the other server drama and complaints about population, can say I’m very happy with my choice. Always a lot of alliance to fight as well; feels pretty even

---
 I've always kept my hearth at TB until flying mounts were a thing.
---
Classic is the biggest throwback for me.
---
I'm Alliance on Stalagg. It's crazy how bad the ratio seems. Whenever I go through leveling zones I see SO MANY horde white seeing barely any alliance. The last several times I've gone through Un'Goro Crater I've seen dozens of horde without seeing a single leveling alliance.
---
Out of those 3, Sneaky Snakes
---
You know, I thought that too. But then I googled it and google disagrees. Not could google be wrong? Sure, but I wasn’t putting in anymore effort that a cursory double check with the ole Google.
---
aye am horde, where you see the hit cap? or is it just a known average? ty
---
You made a ton of people salty in here OP.
---
Grats though, those'll be good for a long while

Ah that makes sense, thanks for the write up.

Why are you bothered by people punishing pieces of shit?

Damn, I must have fucked up somewhere then! Hahaha
---
Raid leader does a roll based on how many people are in the raid, and then gives it to whomever is in that particular raid spot.
---
I agree with that, im just saying I dont think PvP makes the game any easier or harder.
---
The first time I killed a warlock I was entirely unaware that they could just respawn on their body lol. Surprised the shit out of me.
---
The game is so big and so cool love all the little things in it!Later expansions felt like a big rush
---
The comments are lists of things to do with you saying you don’t want to do them. That means there plenty of shit to do, but you elect to not participate, and therefore causing your own lack of things to do. That’s like me saying having a day off is boring, but not actually doing anything on my day off. You’re just bitching about a problem you’ve created.
---
Can you make a 24h version of your OUTRO? Thas shit it sharp!
---
\&gt; I’m tired of this argument honestly. You go ahead and make your game discussion sub, then don’t moderate it. Once it grows to a decent size hit me up and we can have a chat about how wrong you were, but for now we’re done. 
---
You're really struggling to conceptualize stuff beyond the status quo. I'll never understand how people go through life like that. Prob partially a failing on my part for not explaining my logic well enough.
---
Honestly, I don't understand how someone could be on reddit and not like memes (aka humor). You must be a total bore irl. Are you a mod of a subreddit or forum? If so, that makes sosososo much sense. I've never met one irl, but I just imagine they're the creepiest/lamest people on the planet that you would never want to be friends with.
---
Free Transfers can help, but there isn’t an incentive to be on those servers.
---
The best thing that Blizzard could do is add a comparative buff towards PVE.
---
Any time that the total number of active 19-60 players (logged on in the last week for more than 5 hours) is in a ratio that is out by 5 give a 10% exp buff to the other faction. 
---
For example,
---
50:50 - 0%
---
55:45 - 10%
---
60:40 - 20%
---
This way at least your time over exp gains aren’t reduce due to being corpse camped.
---
They could also add some other things that are also PVP related such as minor +resistance and stat buffs so that in the likely time of being 2v1 they have a better chance of survival.
---
I mean how was I supposed to react when upon ressing he immediately started attacking me *even as we are looting the boss*?
---
Not really, it’s just RNG. I went 20+ runs without seeing one when we were farming it. Then saw three in a row the next times I went.
---
10 hours a week?! Man you are either tired at work or your wife is mad at you. I'd be lucky to get half that and only because I'm so very tired...
---
The whole point of this was that I'd want my mains name I've used since 2004 (currently my Paladin has)
---
I fixed it though, my server has free xfers off it so I just moved the Paladin to another server
---
For horde, priests have the best single target heals.
---
I'm almost certain that's ElvUI, but it was out of date when I tried to install it
---
Then sits on your body smoking, drinking, and listening to heavy metal
---
Leveling a druid early on is so slow and tedious. As soon as you hit 20 and get car form it's crazy how much faster it suddenly goes.
---
As I stated on another post, I was trying to save mana for the MT and I thought he'd have gotten away as he had ice block up and the MT was waking up to intercept and taunt. He obviously thought the same which is why he didn't iceblock, but for some reason decided to blame me instead.
---
You need to learn how to down rank your heals. It takes time. I do a lot of standing around it feels like but you can bash the mob for weapon skills. As long as people aren’t dying you are doing it right.
---
Not very smart are we?
---
You're paying for you guild masters epic mount or his alts epic mount. 
---
gg no re.
---
What do you mean true? I don't doubt it happened.
---
As a paladin for sure no, it’s like irl if you have people got some disease the first reaction would be to contain them and find a cure or something. 
---
If your first reaction when someone gets sick is to kill them all then yeah you can see why he’s the lich king
---
alamos best durid
---
Then they complain there’s no tanks.
---
When people let the tank pull and wait literally 2 seconds? Tanking is awesome fun. When they pull and force you to run around trying to get aggro with no rage and only barely recovering before things are dead? Tanking is shit and unfun.
---
Like... I don’t care if “it’ll be fine”. When I rank I want to have fun as well, if you finishing the instance 30 seconds slower (or more likely 10 minutes faster because we don’t wipe) is too much to ask so that I have fun as well, I don’t want to run with you. Find someone else and call me bad as much as you please, I’ll be running with friends and guildies having a blast.
---
FUCK WARLOCKS! THEY RIDE UP TO YOU ON THEIR FANCY EPIC MOUNT, DOT YOU UP REALL GOOD AND THEN YOU DIE WHILE BEING KITED CAUSE UR A WARRIOR.
---
BG's will be cross-realm. So BG queues will probably be about the same for both factions.

&gt;for “reasons”.
---
You know, the reason is literally in the post you're answering to. It's the same reason any more heavily or equally heavily moderated sub won't gain any traction: People don't just switch subs, and new people always subscribe to the biggest subs.
---
????
---
Should I level as arms or fury for 2H warrior? Some people say arms for improved overpower and sweeping strikes, but others say fury for increased crit and otherwise.
---
I definitely know that at level 40 to spec to arms for Mortal Strike, but leading up to that I'm not sure.
---
&gt;just useful for pvp

rofl, thats the only thing that matters haha

Upvoting just to spite you.

Not too sure but ownership gets passed to the next person when previous owner logs off. I'm thinking since its not an actual chat like general and trade it just goes to the next person who has been online longest
---
Suh du ;)
---
Lots of work for a strict mount downgrade &gt;&gt;
---
I'm not tryna tell you what to do, just that it's not like live where you have to play one spec, you can do fine healing dungeons with a feral build
---
At low to mid 50s you should run Mara through princess for the quest bow and the ring drop. Get the trinket from the elite hinterlands quest by then as well.
---
Other than that though, levels.
---
Get 59/60 with that then hit up the 5 man dungeons for gear - LBRS, UD Strat especially, but scholo and living have gear for you too. Drop everything to run every UBRS you can get.
---
But levels matter most.
---
I played an spriest in vanilla, the only class that got all passive aggressive with me getting gear was Mages but who gives a shit about Mages.

I use to chill in the Warlock chat channel, we got on great lol

Don't bother, Blackcrow works just as well, enjoy the extra hit. Send your time chasing other gear.

Apple bobbing gives the strongest Stam/Spirit buff food, but you can only hold 5 of them at a time.

Not sure if it's against the rules but whatever, guys name is Ohrami. You can google it and see, he has a reddit alt where he talks about how child porn should be legal and all that. You can join the Herod discord and see him every now and then, but his whiteknight buddy Akashi is *always* sitting in there trying to defend him because he gets called out a lot.

It’s an easy buy off the AH. I’ve deemed HoJ so much and haven’t seen it drop.

I have a prot paladin in the 40s and a lvl 56 mage I main. I can definitely say that druids can tank perfectly well for 5 man high lvl dungeons, and from what else I've seen druids can tank just about anything except maybe a few raid bosses, they just are very gear dependent.
---
On the flip side, I don't like playing with paladin tanks very much for 5 mans unless it's an aoe run, in which case i'd still prefer a druid or a warrior. Paladin's just don't have the ability to regain aggro and especially if someone screws up and there are adds charging the healer, there is little a paladin can do aside from putting an aoe down and having the healer/dps run through it. They also have no real ranged attacks, so even with linkins boomerang they can't pull as well as a bear or warrior.
---
I love having paladins as heals though for both mage and pally characters
---
Congrats for finding smart ways to farm gold. On the other hand I find these ways clearly to be terrain abuses. I personally hope these different dungeon abuses get fixed, nothing personal :).
---
I keep on getting rogues in my group that will NOT touch skull.  Won't even look at skull.  Why? WHY WHY WHY?
---
I’ve been trying to write a similar macro that puts poison on my mainhand with no modifier key and puts it on the offhand when holding alt, but for some reason, the alt modifier doesn’t work; it always applies to the mainhand no matter what.
---
I’ve also tried to create a mouseover Blind macro, but it doesn’t work at all and I have no idea why. It’s just “/use [@mouseover] Blind”.
---
I definitely wouldn't call them "strong" but they are fine with a careful group

Hunters are in higher demand than druids for raids
---
Ahhahaha you are! You're a gem. Let's talk more about fury warriors with CHT. Why don't you explain your guild's logic for not permitting fury warriors to acquire it. Your broad statement that every single warrior is or ever would be in your guild would voluntarily refuse it isn't believable.
---
those techniques dont work in dungeons, I was looking for advice there.
---
STV arena and random world stuff. I usually spec it on off days to farm mara.
---
What happened afterwards though? He killed brokentooth or someone else tamed him?
---
New player as well but here's what I've heard: druids are great for leveling and tanking/healing/dpsing instances. For raiding, healing is gonna be your most desired spec, but you can probably find a guild to let you feral DPS, it's just gonna be a little harder. Apparently the rotation for DPS cat is much more intensive as well.
---
So if you're looking for an alt to level with and then maybe break out for pvp or instances, druid is a good option. If you want something to main for raids I'd probably stick with lock
---
Alliance.
---
We're you resisted? Or was it a batching thing? Did you get charged while feigning? Because that's a separate issue.
---
The higher levels you are in dungeons the easier it will to hold aggro. Mark your targets and tell your team to attack who you mark. Build threat on the unmarked enemies as your team kills the marked target. Once that target goes after healer you can taunt it, but if it runs away it’s not a big deal as long as it’s being attacked by everyone else. From there move into another target and do the same thing. That’s how I deal with tanking.
---
Doing dungeons for the first time as a tank is always a nightmare because it’s hard to hold aggro u till you’re above average dungeon level and you don’t know then monsters and how to deal with them. Keep playing the dungeon and by the 3rd time you’ll be a pro.
---
Star Shards is legit the best Priest spell for leveling. it has fantastic dpm, in fact, it might be the best dpm spell a Priest has.
---
I love BC and if they released BC servers i'd drop classic in a heartbeat.
---
Everything about BC was great, arena, raiding, dungeons, only downside was alot less world PVP due to flying.
---
This is why I like playing with Prot Pallies. AOE threat generated is WAY better than a warriors'.
---
SW:P on multiple targets is very mana hungry and if those targets die long before the duration expires it's also incredibly not mana efficient. Mind blast is also the biggest source of burst, which is kinda what you need for trash mobs but you can't really use it on them. Boss damage is fine, it's just trash packs that are depressing.
---
Should I drop leatherworking?  
---
I'm a level 28 hunter, I have LW @ 125, skinning @ 175. There's been very few instances where I've actually used the items I'm crafting (tend to find better items questing/dungeons). Would it be better if I just switched over to herb/mining now and make some extra gold?
---
Had a 2+ hour long ZF run last night. 
---
We couldn’t even kill the last hydra boss you summon at the end. Armor was gone as was my pride...
---
We had two lvl46 mages a 47 warrior and a 46 Druid tank who was god awful.
---
Lol that happens to me all the time too! Someone needs to make a meme of that bread vender like "hey! you wanna buy some bread? oh. you just want the auction house. that's next door -sad face-" lol
---
I have never raided, but is it possible/practical to skip bosses to farm in the instance with a smaller group?
---
Great for healing, just fine solo, and they can tank 5 man groups. For raids you'll probably be healing mostly for this raid tier but some people use bears as off tanks. Boomkin is basically a joke for right now. Cat form is basically rogue lite and travel form is really convenient when you don't want to take time to mess with your mount (and you get it way sooner than a mount). It's a fun class and it gets better as the patches go on.
---
Just combine them. Sneaky Dudes
---
Slippery slope fallacy happens to be one of the major informal fallacies in logic, take a class jeez, you're embarrassing yourself
---
No AOE but your single target DPS and self sustain is very high which lets you easily handle elite quests solo in a lot of cases. Also very hard to die even when pulling 2-3 mobs at once
---
mind explaining mp5 anyone?
---
join a non shit guild...profit?
---
lol this remake is worse than most p servers. Blizzard make numerous small changes and nobody cares, mainly because nobody here actually played vanilla so they dont know about the changes.
---
While leveling, once you get shadowform, you can pull like 4 mobs, dot them, use fear, repeat twice and they should die with some wanding mixed in. It uses up most of your mana though and isn't really faster than doing single target considering the downtime, the only benefit is you can tag multiple mobs in contested areas.
---
It's great for holy spec sure, but as shadow you kinda expect to do more DPS :D
---
Sounds like you'd have more fun in retail
---
Rattlegore is best server

Never said anything about permissions bro. Never made a broad statement either. You should really atop accusing me of things I never said or accusing me of things I never did then doing them yourself. Hint: it's you who is obsessed with getting the last word in, not me.
---
He was there for that exact reason
---
Moonfire is one of the coolest spells imo.
---
I had three drop for me on 700 kills ...
---
... they all dropped on the first 400.
---
This was weeks ago
---
I'm pretty sure bliz changed the drop rate at somepoint, lowering below the 'proper' rate to compensate for the oopsie resulting in too much supply too early.
---
gg
---
Possible yes. But you won’t get much out of it since you raid for loot, and loot is on bosses.
---
you'll be fine as Protection in 5-mans, but, you'll almost never be wanted to raid 'cuz your mana will run out FAST and you have no taunt.
---
To be honest I don't know enough about classic raiding to answer that question, but the video in which I originally saw it was a Skarmtank video of him using the spec in Naxx so late raids it is apparently effective.
---
Why can't I find group for brd is lvl 52 mage tóo low?
---
Here is what your were suppose to do. 
---
1. Take your damn time.
---
Seriously, 90% of the players are still leveling and enjoying the game. You rushed to 60 and now your on reddit complaining?
---
Give someone a little power and they take it to the extremes. He's a mod so you have to do whatever he says. it's that simple. He should have been removed but mods stick up for mods, the rest of us plebs can be dammed.
---
You most likely won’t get the thing back from blizz, unless you can prove they bugged a trade window or something.
---
Kinda like eve just ninjaing or willingly trading stuff over means no returns, no matter how scummy. Report it to the local big guilds with proof
---
Not saying this to be rude, but what generation of games did you grow up around or are familiar with? A game that has almost zero penalty for dying, that you can play with just a few abilities, is pretty casual.
---
Training points are equal to pet level x loyalty level

Feed your pet and be patient. All pets have the same points at the end.
---
The fucking homer scream
---
No you are just wrong or a troll. Have a good time
---
Tanking does get better. Yes, you're going to struggle holding aggro until at least around 30ish. That's when I started noticing a difference. Also at that level there's not really many challenging dungeon bosses that you have to worry about if you lose aggro momentarily and your DPS or healer takes a few punches. Not the end of the world. Plus WC, in my opinion, is just an awful place and will make anyone feel disheartened.
---
Also, the beautiful thing about tanking is you tend to set the pace and the mood of the group. I'm a level 53 orc warrior tank on Grob and I have yet to have anything remotely close to a "toxic" group. I've honestly enjoyed playing with about 95% of the people I group with for dungeons. You'll make mistakes and so will your group. I feel like a lot of tanks are prima donnas and will be quick to bash their group or push blame to others. Always be able to admit your mistakes and also be able to calmly teach if you know a better way to handle certain scenarios. Most importantly, remember it's just a game.
---
I wasn’t really trying to rush I was just having fun playing the game and then before I realized it I was already 60
---
When you’re having fun you just want to keep playing, you know?
---
something like this, but self-hosted, yes
---
Depends what you want. If you want extra gold, then grab mining or herbalism. If you want to make gear keep leatherworking.
---
You don't understand. He kept his head in the sand and is completely oblivious to the faction imbalance on Herod until now when he is concurrently on Reddit and the voice of people not on Reddit. So he is obviously an experienced Vanilla player, 2004 to 2010, but also knows nothing and is here but is not here. Do you get it now?
---
I mean you could easily have someone else buy it and give it to you. No rep grind needed.
---
Fully agree, you can see a) a lot after content creators had landed a hit
---
Kromkrush horde as a pretty adamant twink community
---
I love how dense these are with meme references, sound effects, perfectly timed cuts, and a nice dose of nostalgia. I’m not sure if this just comes naturally for you, but the amount of work put into it is obvious and the creativity required to make a stupid SM run this entertaining is incredible. Well done and keep on it!
---
ravager is awful at higher levels
---
youre in a party with no aoe.
---
I have the hand cannon and it doesn't outperform the xbows, even on a dwarf. I bought it when leveling because I had plenty of gold and it's lasted me from 53 to just about full pre-raid BIS. Just waiting on Rhok. 
---
That being said I have collected all my gear and seen neither xbow drop.
---
I switched to MM when I decided I wanted to start getting into raids. BM is fine for 5 man and 10 man content. You only really miss out on the 100 group AP from trueshot.
---
Protip: you can bind your stances to your keys directly without having to drag duplicates onto your bar.(unless those stance macros have some function you find valuable beyond just changing stances)
---
Keybindings, actionbar, special action button 1, 2, 3 for battle, defensive, berserker, respectively.
---
He is a tank. We have to do almost all the work(healer excluded) inside the instance, least other people can do is the work before hand.
---
Probably. I have trouble finding groups sometimes as a 54 mage, unless they're guild runs.
---
&gt;Raptor strike
---
Everyone does not do this... There is no irony in the other person's statement. 
---
Only a fraction of the playerbase takes part in senseless camping, not "everyone" 
---
Many of us rolled on PVP servers to partake in large scale, non instanced faction warfare that is no doubt going to come phase two, not to just mindlessly camp people we can oneshot and laugh at. 
---
Sorry buddy, sounds like you are part of the assholes.
---
Absolutely!
---
You have a tank so you can go ham on dps.
---
Aimed shot will pull off even a BM pet, but not a warrior. And since you're the dps of the party, you should be speccing to maximize for that.
---
At the very least go 11 deep to AS before returning to BM, or go full MM all the way.
---
Thank you!
---
I have rank 8, 7 5 and 4 on my bar atm. With 2 different regrowths and my highest rank rejuve. I have around 170+ healing atm. I might try to reroll to balance resto when I get off work. 
---
 Can you still cat dps okay? I know in cloth kitty form gets hit kinda hard, but probs better than spamming wrath and staff bashing yea?
---
Asmongold isn't going to play Horde. He was insulting them as he listened to the narrator talked about the history of his new Orc toon. He just went to troll the Hades players. So far as I am aware he only went there that one time. 
---
His buddy McConnell has a Shaman he wanted to play so he's the one on Herod. I would expect Asmon to come back once or twice for some events but that's about it. He will attract attention and increase the players trying to get on the server when that happens but it's really temporary.
---
Wont save you from getting broken tooth killed though
---
Yeah people mindlessly telling others to downrank is causing a lot of confusion. It's less HPM until a certain amount of +healing but it can still be useful if a big heal would cause too much overhealing.
---
The sims that I have seen show it as the best pre raid MH weapon, though they are probably based on private servers. 
---
All in all it’s probably a very small difference that’s not gonna matter.
---
the ww sword is fine. i was the highest level in my guild and used the archeus sword until i could solo cyclonian at level 41. 
---
sword spec is great for tanking, too. sword of omen, vanquisher's, thrash blade, mirah's song... lots of great tanking sword quest rewards. 2H sword drops are pretty rare from 40-55 though.
---
Kurrinaxx fam in the house!
---
&gt;  as Alamo told us, 
---
I remember this so well, at the time it was posted. I assumed it was lost with time.
---
Amen! I will gladly take a hunter along to dungeons and not worry as much lol
---
at lvl 35 and 250 LW, you can get a salt shaker that turns deeprock salt into refined deeprock salt and make like 10g per day at least doing that, which takes seconds. if you have plenty of time to kill and can farm 10g+ worth of herbs per day, drop LW if you really don't care about making your own gear
---
Are you on bigglesworth? Cause we just did that last night! The fires in IF I mean.
---
Sounds like successful PvP to me. Congratulations Horde, you did it!
---
Kromcrush is fucking krushing it.
---
Compared to games like EQ and such it is more casual than that but classic is a time sync. Classic isn't hard by any stretch. In truth the raids and the gameplay are ridiculously easy. But this is more of a game of attrition. I was able to trudge through it 15 years ago because I didn't have a life or responsibilities. Now I need something more casual. Plus I did all of this so much back in classic that it's really not that fun this time around.
---
Just gotta be lucky.
---
Not really
---
Because horde don’t suck.
---
I have literally no idea why I like this but I love it. It’s like how edm started or something
---
No. The SM weapon is much better and you can get it right now if you really wanted to. And it takes much less effort.
---
Conan the Gnomarian.
---
you had me the whole time, but when i heard the rs sfx i was dying
---
Come to Kromcrush. It has a great faction balance and the population is just the right kind of high.
---
its okay krol looks sick
---
Haven't managed a single Onyxia or MC pug yet and guilds with stable raid rosters are always full on hunters. Only reason I rolled a hunter was because the guild I was in at start of classic said I had a raid spot. Then the guild imploded. Doing high level dungeons is as easy as any other damage dealer, but raids have been completely inaccessible to me.
---
Fucking every time an Alliance tries to go into an instance they get killed by horde, you fucking act like they are to blame but Horde only attack in advantage but then act like pals when the opposite appears, go fuck yourself.
---
Always this.  Anything else would full in riot.
---
The problem I had is my guild and I all got together on discord before launch, and we had so many tanks planned... They actually convinced me to NOT roll another tank, that we had "too many"
---
Half server transfered by week 2 cause of queues or guild transfered cause they out paced most of the guild. 
---
But now that we are all trying to get people geared for raids, its abysmal. 
---
So Im saying fuck it and rolling a tank from scratch, and I will run every damn dungeon for the other guildies that helped me along the way because I understand the pain of no tanks running the shit you need.
---
I prefer Gun.
---
wow didn't know there could be that many alliance on a server :Ooo
---
signed Skullflame EU player 70%+ horde
---
&gt; so hmmm please do the necessary steps to be able to raid
---
And you made a hunter? o_o
---
Looks like its not working again.  Blammo had about 8k players 3 days ago on census and now it has zero
---
Never said that it was, but it definitely paints illidan as *evil*. He redeems himself. It's like his thing.
---
More!
---
The rouge and another horde warrior joined in on killing me and then they killed Broken Tooth.
---
I learned the hard way
---
If you're overgeared for the content, you can afford to waste a little mana for this. If you're NOT overgeared, this is the kind of thing that will deplete your mana reserves to the point of group suicide.
---
A great healer knows what they can sustain and what they can't. A great healer knows when to make sacrafices and let DPS cover themselves (as they can and fucking should--blow a cooldown, kite, bandage, whatever, stop being a lazy shit).
---
Oh I see, thanks!
---
Can’t DE in trade window yet.
---
51/0/0
---
This is the boat to Feathermoon in Feralas haha. But yeah it is faster 100% of the time to swim from the shore with the water elementals.
---
i tried, not possible with current gear i think
---
Yeah it’s pretty bad on most servers. All the dungeon entrances are camped by Horde non stop and it’s gonna get worse in P2. 
---
Vanilla and private servers had more alliance because the raids were much harder and being Alliance gave you a big advantage. But in Classic the raids are so braindead easy that faction doesn’t matter at all so naturally people pick the faction with better pvp racials.
---
Judging by their expressions, at least half of them achieved release.
---
Random 100 it, no one gets a second bag until everyone has gotten one.
---
Welcome to pvp bitch.
---
Find a troll and give them the money to buy the mount for you
---
Just because your specialization is shadow does not mean you lose your healing abilities. They are still useful skills and part of your skill set. Shadow vs holy is not like being gay or hetero. Or like a fashion statement.
---
If you get offended by this, perhaps you should respond more than just “shadow”, because that is not a “no” in this case.
---
That's why both the level 30 and 40 tournament was won by Blizzcon champions? And also why most big names from private servers are ex-gladiators and rank 1s? You're not the sharpest tool in the shed.
---
It has to do with how group exp is calculated. 
---
Group exp is based off people near your level. 
---
You get more per each person near your level. 
---
The full 5 group meant more group exp. 
---
The level 60 completely takes away from the group exp equation. 
---
Honestly only losing 1k exp is nothing, though... You didn't even lose 10% of what you were making but you had a much smoother experience.
---
Join the dark side. Undead Warlock baby!
---
Who gives a shit though?
---
Part of the role of being an officer is you are responsible for making it happen.
---
Especially when we didn’t know the drop date.
---
I got the axe from gnomergan and used that until 36 and got  Whirlwind. Not to hard to farm the tusks, and some of the charms can be bought cheap
---
I was just concerned about him saying he could do 12 hour sessions, already putting in 22 days and getting to the point where he has to get creative to find reasons to log on. The list itself was very helpful and had a good amount of stuff on it and I’m thankful for him sharing his ideas on stuff that might be worth getting
---
Corruption acts over 18 seconds, so it gains 18/15 = 120% of spell power added to the total damage done. 
---
So so if it does 666 damage originally, with your cape it does 690 damage total now, with the bonus damage divided equally to each tick
---
Yes they made it braindead easy.
---
What guild !?
---
Basically what others have said. The primary reason is Druids cannot benefit from the DPS air totem shamans will be dropping in raids: Windfury. Windfury effects weapons, and druids don’t use weapons.
---
Not only does WF buff rogue and warrior DPS better than Kings + Might combined (the paladin melee buffs), but the Druid gets nothing. The result is horde warriors and rouges theoretically do slightly more damage that their alliance counterparts, while Alliance druids do considerably more damage than their horde counterparts (an alliance Druid will be raiding with around 200 more attack power and at least 1% more to crit than a Horde Druid in the same gear).
---
Another thing to consider in horde vs alliance in relation to raiding ferals is that a shaman has to be in the party for the melee to benefit from their totems, while pally buffs are raid wide. But someone could write a thesis on raid composition and synergetic parties. So, suffice it to say it’s a point of consideration.
---
Thrash does just fine for MC, if you were just about set for everything else pre raid and no longer interested in running those instances then yeah, you can put crusader on it and wait for a raid drop to replace it.
---
What mods do you use? your interface is slick.
---
Nope, and wouldnt that give 1-.75*.75=96% reduction? if it worked that way?
---
This particular gnome looks like a guinea pig.
---
Not just HP, the bosses on private servers also did more damage and used their abilities more often. And melee dps was nerfed hard on private servers.
---
Are you sure? It doesn't look like [Morpheus](https://www.dafont.com/morpheus.font)...
---
Hur did go back to retail if you don’t agree with me!
---
Grow the fuck up. 
---
You are entirely wrong. Any guild that understands itemization decides who is swords and who is daggers before hand and they are locked into that unless the roster changes. Anything other than that is just flat wrong period the end. 
---
Imagine telling me to go back to retail when that has nothing to do with this conversation at all.
---
Biggest problem for most pugs now and back then was to get enough dousers
---
I waited 90 minutes for my ubrs run to start because my party was camped from TP all the way to the entrance.
---
Alliance KIRTONOS.

They are scum !

---
It was in the early classic (meaning 1.13 builds, not vanilla 1.x builds.) builds but was removed from them around the same time they removed it from 8.2 ptr which may suggest that it was an automated removal from all non-internal builds.
---
Even if it was in the game still all of the recent methods to reach the island required 2 seater mounts or vehicles which obviously aren't in classic.
---
I would trust Blizzard on this one. They say they have a 1.12 reference client and that they ported the data values as they where. I also believe old Blizzard would mention major nerfs done to bosses in patch notes leading up to 1.12, and there where no changes to raid bosses in those besides c'thun and ragnaros. 
---
C'thun was nerfed, and we will unfortunately get the nerfed version.  Ragnaros however was just bugfixxed with regards to animations and sounds.
---
I learned in vanilla to never use fast weapons as a hunter even if the dps is much higher. Slow always foes better. You can easily run out of ammo with a wipe or two with a fast weapon.
---
Name 1 that's better.
---
Long story short me and a group of about 15 IRL friends started a guild when we got to 60, we joined a PUG group for MC and they left our guild and join Boomer Police.  I decided to delete my character and quit playing and made this video in honor of our experience.

Everyone is RNG carried. Literally everyone. I've seen fresh 60's be in full T1 two weeks later and I've seen people working on their blues for months.
---
I'm pretty well geared at this point, still have a green cloak and exactly zero decent blues have dropped for me. Had a green neckpiece till two days ago as well. 
---
RNG is basically this entire game, otherwise you'd run everything once and then have nothing left to do.
---
Part of the responsibility of running a pug is establishing who can roll on what before the raid. I would make a gear list, have people say what spec they are, and then make it clear before any kills that loot has certain restrictions. 
---
BOE gear would be class specific as well and be auto equipped. Things like fiery cores and the like I would save till the end and distribute to people who DIDNT get any gear as equitably as possible(accepting requests if people needed something in particular).

I don’t pug right now but that is how I would do it as a leader.

This doesn't work for me.

It just gives me an option to manually apply poison to a weapon.

Uh....

Not what happened though

Raid it with your guild? I figured thats what everyone did

Atlasloot I think.
---
A few days ago we had a group of elitist gnomes who gathered in IF and started insulting all the other races on Ashbringer EU leading to some fun shennanigans :)
---
Wow so lucky
---
Meanwhile I'm over here with my daggers and having never so much as trained swords. Just isn't fun to me and I do great in damage so "meh".
---
You can have shamans who are more focused on being tank healer or shamans focusing on chain heal. It wont matter much in MC/BWL but will be relevant P5 and P6.
---
Numbers are misleading.
---
50:50 is 10:10
---
55:45 is 12:10
---
60:40 is 20:10
---
“Only”?
---
2-3 extra per 10 is where one faction starts to swallow another in a demographic like we have.
---
His best
---
There's no reason to have a wolf if you also are bm with frenzy.  Better to have a cat, or a bird/spiteflayer with screech
---
Hunter is better for you.
---
When you get a shaman with full t1 they’ll often tank heal on some fights or melee heal others. Ideally you’ll have a bunch of shamans with at least one on the tanks for the extra armor.
---
F
---
Just got mine!!
---
Or you are just being an asshole for no reason because you are a Reddit tough guy.
---
I do this, even if I do have an SS up. My time is less valuable, tabbing out and doing something else while they waste theirs is all I can do.
---
What man?
---
If I am going to look at an ass for hundreds of hours, seems kinda gay to pick a male one. 
---
But hey, maybe that’s just my heteroness coming out. You enjoy your man ass!
---
Weird bug. But nothing in Classic surprises me anymore.
---
Been alliance my whole life on pvp servers and went horde for classic. It's amazing how many interactions where I feel safer amongst opposite faction as opposed to being an alliance priest. Being an orc shaman, I have not been ganked by a rogue yet in classic. Mages and other classes are a different story but in general it's quite amazing seeing the difference in personality in the open world when it comes to cooperation. In general I'm not a fan of killing people for kicks, I will only do it if they are attacking a rare elite, quest mob or taking my node. In fact when I see mages aoe farming I will drop a fire Nova totem to help them out. The other day I found two warriors farming black dragon elites in Burning steppes and I helped them out because I needed to skin them (they weren't). I'm not saying I didn't have tons of horde friends as a mind controlling priest in wrath/tbc, but god damn did I not want to be around horde ever. Undead rogues are typically cancer. Alot of my guildies can follow the same mindset too where they kill on sight no matter the case which I don't really agree with (until phase 2).
---
You understand that hunters and warlocks have one less bag than other classes right? Woosh
---
So just leave and that's it. No real need to make a reddit post about a shitty guild, they are a dime a dozen.
---
It's not BiS in AQ. On alliance you don't care as much about mainhand topend dmg since you don't have windfury. Non humans go daggers in AQ and you reach the softcap at 308 weapon skill, meaning the dagger from AQ (+3) and aged core leather gloves (+5) turns out to be better than edgemaster's thanks to the additional 1% crit and 15 str being a lot better than 0.08% crit+hit. Fyi nearly all BiS lists are entirely based on horde and not alliance. Current BiS for non humans as far as single target DW goes is perd blade+CHT/Felstriker, alternatively Deathbringer MH for better multi target.
---
Should’ve thought about that before you kos every other opposing faction member as the dominant faction. Whatdya think they were gonna do?
---
^
---
Wowowow that's incredible.
---
🧂🧂🧂
---
I disagree, But I get your point.
---
Dread It, Run From It, Destiny Still Arrives
---
Only if you’re a mage. I just did this blinking on cool down as the boat left and we arrived at the same time.
---
Druids are excellent at 60, but you need to know that you will not be the best at any particular role. You are a true support class - you will support other classes and help them shine *while also* being very proficient and valuable yourself.
---
Druids make **excellent** 5-man tanks, and they are very capable raid OT tanks (and can even MT on certain fights, like Patchwerk - who doesn't crit). They are also great healers, especially as you progress through end-game raids. Your healing throughput ends up nearing the top of the charts. As for DPS, with enough effort, you can be middle-of-the-pack with feral. I don't personally find the appeal of the powershifting, but hey - it's a cool concept.
---
And, lastly, Balance (Boomkin). While it is a pretty ridiculous, mana-inefficient spec - it's really fun and absolutely hilarious. You can almost sense people smashing their keyboards in wPvP when you drop a starfire crit on them.
---
As for leveling - I'd argue that they're just behind hunters for leveling speed, even a touch ahead of warlocks. You can essentially seamlessly attack mobs in cat form, popping out every third or fourth mob to heal yourself, then popping back to cat to dps. If you accidentally pull two or more mobs, you can pop out and cast rejuvenation or regrowth (or both), then shift to bear form and tank it out. It's super satisfying to see your health actually *go up* when you're getting beat down by two mobs.
---
I'd say give it a shot. It's a very diverse class. 
---
Just to be fair, I'll share my biggest con of the class: you can't see your gear when you're in form. I don't know if that's the vanity in me, or if it's just warrior/rogue envy, but it really bums me out that people can't see my gear when I'm tanking in bear form.
---
I actually replaced the legs with BF legs. But Inhave plenty of hit in other places.  And BF pants have a ton of crit on them and AP. And DM being out now makes a big difference.
---
I personally would say warlock over hunter. Hunter for me got very boring. However with warlock, you get all these powerful spells, lots of interesting class quests , no mount for you to grind as you get it free, amazing pvp. I also feel that warlock have a higher demand for raids also, later on in your wow experience 
---
That’s just my opinion on someone who rolled both and have both at around level 30 atm
---
He is in full pre bis
---
That depends on your subjective tastes. Perhaps classic simply isn't for you. Personally I've been playing almost non-stop and have lots of things I want to do.
---
Some people want to make their own goals and do their own thing, others prefer being guided and told what they need to do. You're simply someone that prefers the latter.
---
Great for finding groups. It watches chat for you.
---
Disc priest checking in. I have a fire resist wand, a high int wand, a spell power wand, a healing power wand and I still need a mp5 dispell fight wand.
---
For the Herd!!!! Mooo!!!!
---
Funny how much different that gear looks for females, much better looking
---
I urge you to play on a 30-70 server as the less dominant side. It’s not a matter of fair or mildly inconvenienced questing, some zones are literally locked out at certain times. 
---
Being outnumbered you can kill more people only holds up when you vs lowbies.
---
Healers should have the same mentality, heal the tank first and foremost. If the tank dies it's usually a wipe, if a dps dies it's far less likely to be a wipe. They'll eventually learn to give you 2 global cooldowns before engaging.
---
For a second there I thought that cat was on a leash.
---
Im with you. I get that its possible, but I'm a shadow priest for a reason!
---
What kind of enchanted life do you live where that's only somewhat lucky?
---
I’m a furry warrior with a 58 dps one handed. If I wanna run dungeons, I tank. These half a sack Furies can get over themselves.
---
A lot of Horde players have this competitive PvP mentality, which is exactly why you should play on Alliance to face against people who like doing world PvP. I rolled Alliance because I want to be the underdog and defy the odds.
---
Skurri
---
But realistically, how much does a bis pet matter in terms of dps? Like a regular 2.0 attack pet vs some of these 1.0-1.2 pets.
---
I guess you’re right. I’ve never been a fan of sandbox games and what you just said is most likely the reason why.
---
But the problem is that the endgame is not a sandbox by design if you ask me but actually caused by a lack of  content at the moment.
---
Sorry but I cant get through your min/maxing attitude to make you see logic. Might want to try being more reasonable in future.
---
Use LFM instead of LFG
---
I’m just being bitter
---
I'd be reporting him for his name so quickly for doing that 😂
---
NEKRAGE IS OUR SAVIOR HOW DARE YOU! 
---
Na, I'm joking, I saw the drama in World Chat and it's hilarious as shit. Especially when the GM of CHADS intensified the drama thanks to her friend or boyfriend or whatever he is who is also a streamer but he streams on YouTube where she is a Mod of his. I found it hilarious because it turns out the guy is Alexensual who is a lowly YouTube streamer who used to be best buds with Asmongold, who now hates him because of his personality. You gotta be one twisted fuck to have Asmongold saying he used to be your friend but no longer is lol. They're all on our server too and Alexensual tried to do the Devilsaur Mafia thing by telling people to let others know that he runs shit - meanwhile no one on the server really knows him except for Nekrage and his clan OT. I, personally, have no issue with any of them but I love to fuck with Nekrage by calling for him in World Chat saying I'm summoning him - I got no beef with him but it's fun watching people freak out about it, sadly he left World chat and let his lackey's advertise for him instead. I've not seen the GM of CHADS talk or be online for awhile though. I honestly just think the whole thing is silly but so fucking hilarious because they're grown ass men who started drama over who's a better streamer. Both Guilds are full of toxic people but there's some cool ass people too.
---
Overall - I am enjoying Kirtonos' drama, it brightens my day. Also watch out for a dude named like Slev or something - he plays a Hunter and basically admitted to wanting to hangout with children online, thought he was trying to joke so I said it's not cool to be into kids man, he took it very seriously and it turns out he's very fond of children actually which is really creepy. He's yet to deny the claims (like any sane person would) and instead berates anyone and everyone while trying to get people to defend him for liking kids.
---
But those who comment are an entirely different set, composed entirely of humble geniuses.
---
You can't do any DPS if you're dead. In a raid if you die as DPS it's most likely your fault.
---
I got at it at 30 and it’s definitely a huge power boost. I just /who in STV and altercation mountains and asked whatever level 60 would come help me and bought the mats on the AH. Took maybe 30min all in all.
---
Well we will just have to agree to disagree, we formed our guild prior to the release and had a group of officers and members determine loot priorities and all members voted on it. Just the way we decided to distribute loot.
---
Imagine being 60, and hanging out at the nessingwary camp just to kill lowbies.. they’re probably the same ones that complain faction imbalance although they’re the ones causing it
---
you think this is bad wwait until the buff is put up and your not on the layer of the guy who used it lol
---
What exactly is this event beyond trick or treating once an hour at an innkeeper and apple bobbing?
---
You spend a couple of hours a week making meaningful progress on your character that will never be invalidated, idk how that isn't casual... Even more so than retail, since you don't have the stress of keeping up with world quests, azerite etc... And knowing that in retail, literally everything you do will be completely meaningless and wiped in 2 months and a fresh 120 will have equal progress to you.
---
Weakauras are a good option for it, you can find a ton of rogue specific ones on wago.io
---
Was this ever resloved? have a friend with the same issue
---
On average any way, I bet you save 3-4 mins every time by swimming.
---
What a unit, I can’t handle the raw sex appeal
---
The ones that complain about faction imbalance are the same ones that camp low level zones as lv60 as the dominant faction. Change my mind
---
&gt;The guild's Loot Council claim of fairness and transparency is a facade
---
*gasp*
---
My guilds main team has 5 druids and we clear shit just fine. Here will be guilds and pugs for anyone on most servers, just a matter of finding them.
---
This is the best answer. I am currently level 35 and have done daggers the whole way. I really enjoy it and it doesn’t feel slow and I still dish out top dps in most groups I’m with, but man there was a point in the early 30’s I just couldn’t get a dagger upgrade for the life of me, and you can really fell the drop in damage, then the gnomer one and the SM caster one both dropped within 1 level /shrug
---
total player count means nothing when you can only play with 5 of them
---
Min/maxing is all about logic -- applying math to accomplish goals. Not letting furies roll on CHT is all about emotion.
---
52 priest on Faerlina. Never had any problems on my server.  Tanks can be tough to find sometimes  but my role is solidly second in demand.
---
Whats the gold per hour on this badboy?
---
Mara farming is 30-50g/hour as a lock.
---
Depends what you think 'end-game' is. For some, MC/ony is simply another hurdle to get towards the end-game, in terms of items for PvP. For others, those items might enable them to take on other challenges in the game.
---
Personally, I like MC/ony, and one of my primary reasons to get gear - besides possibly PvP - is because I like seeing what I can solo with better gear. There's already been people soloing parts of Dire Maul. MC/ony is end-game, but it's not my only end-game based on my personal goals.
---
With how little I'm able to play I might be able to kill level 50+ mobs by next Hallow's End
---
This is eranikus, a boss that drops threat from tank. Dps should accept the likelihood of death no matter how good their healer is.
---
On the flipside, there's a ton of Hordes thinking they're safe farming mobs next to 3 Alliance players. I've taken it as my mission to correct those ideas.
---
You realize no loot council is fair? I'm not sure why your smearing a specific guild here. Obviously loot council isn't something your ok with so find a guild with a different loot system instead of a weird smear post
---
This is true, but when I’m leveling solo it’s always against green mobs so they die stupid fast anyway. Ambush, two SS and then sometimes I can’t even get a Evis off before they die
---
Thank you so much for the info! I feel a lot better about it now
---

---
I'm pretty sure the spell can't be removed from the tank - it makes him immune to *everything*, which includes friendly dispel magic casts.
---
&gt; I think you might be right on that, but it's not because moderation adds value
---
Right. It's just nearly every successful subreddit collectively making the same mistake. I gotcha.
---
No way! Lynneth was the name of my original succubus in vanilla!
---

Strong solo. Strong gold making. Strong group. Strong raid. Strong pvp.
---
This really made my day bro
---
Congrats! My guild [Convergence] on Kirtonos just downed him last night for the first time, too! It was so great being back there after 14 years and taking him down.
---
I’m not sure if I’m doing my rotation correctly or not. I’ve been casting my Aimed Shot like .3 seconds before my autos according to my weapon swing timer, and the auto still goes off. I also don’t get the little “failed” thing in my auto timer bar when I do it that way.
---
So from what I can tell, casting aimed right before the auto cast completes, still results in a successful auto + correctly timed aim shot where it’s not clipping the next auto. 
---
Am I doing this right?
---
black desert online
---
Humble brag lol
---
Cool
---
True. I haven't seen a single huntard. Even the hunters I've met who've said classic is their first wow experience haven't been huntards. All those players went mage this time lol
---
This. I am lvling with my homie who is a warrior and we have been killing it. Getting people to fill out 5 is ez pz. We can usually even bring 4 total if the dps is hella good
---
Deathmaw is great for pve stuff.
---
Depends on what you're trying to accomplish. Are you looking to stun lock? You can stun with SS and going full combat if you want. Stun rotation is open with cheap shot, ss/ or hemo gouge wait then kidney. Diminishing returns on the stun go away after 15 seconds so you could blind or vanish after the kidney and do it over again. The things you'd be missing out in the assassin tree is ruthlessness and remorseless strikes which are good energy savers. As well as the +5% in crit and bonus crit damage on your SS or hemo in lethality. 
---
I'd probably go either full combat and assassin or sub and assassin. This spec is actually insane right now  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/305320115001-3-500253000332121](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/305320115001-3-500253000332121) if you how to stun lock. 
---
You could try this to which can also stun lock with the right timing. Also good in pve and group pvp. [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/005322115-3200152020050150231](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/005322115-3200152020050150231) 
---
As long as you know the rotation you can build off of that.
---
And there's at least 3 for Warlock...
---
Lol. Just dont reply dude.
---
It's the circle of gank. Angry horde who got rekt in hillsbrad go to gank in STV when they level up. The alliance they kill eventually hit 60 and return to STV to take it out on the horde there
---
i think what the person was TRYING to tell you, is stop casting max rank greater heal on someone who would be fully healed by a lesser heal for 300 less mana
---
overhealing is a sin
---
also don't bother hitting people with heals if they're not going to take damage that will kill them
---
if a rogue takes a cleave, let him stew with his health bar down, he's not pulling agro, he's not in any threat of dying. just continue spending mana where it's needed
---
amen. finding any of those classes is way easier than finding a tank. especially if you're horde. So many dps shamans
---
There's an elvui for classic. The one you installed was probably just the modern version.
---
It's on their main website, [tukui.com](https://tukui.com)
---
I've used it since release with little to no issue, and it's only gotten better with each update.
---
We are starved for dungeon healers on Incendius, takes like an hour to get one.
---
&gt;	what was a balanced server with great world pvp went to shit
---
No, it was only good for your side or else the alliance wouldn’t have left you ding dong. Obviously they felt different
---
Ah, powerthirst
---
I mean, being at 60 is what you make of it. 
---
Now that I have all of the gear I need from dire maul, and have completed my RP set, I am going to spec back to boomkin in my Travelers Set(just need two more travelers backpacks to be complete) and wander the land, helping people complete quests, smite those who dare attack me, escort people from menethil to ironforge, so on and so forth while RP  the entire way. 
---
Part of the joy of being on an RP-PVE server. I have the option to do things, I don’t have to.
---
Don't get me wrong, it's good enough to clear content and it's without a doubt one of the coolest weapons in the game, but when it comes to min-maxing it's literal garbage compared to a fury-prot with 2 daggers.
---
Fisting is 300 bucks
---
You really couldn't be any more wrong, triggered lil bitch.

Litenghoof is infamous for his non-stop spam for Ironfoe Reserved.

I‘m alliance on the most heavily weighted horde PvP server, and my first run to 60 I legitimately don’t think I was ever corpse camped. I played it neutral, and got ganked  plenty of times, but I really can’t fathom why I hear about people getting corpse camped for no reason. Idk, maybe it’s changed since I rode the semi-hardcore player zerg to 60. I’ve started leveling an alt so we’ll see how that goes.
---
Ahhhh let's not sweat the small details...
---
This is photoshopped. Look at the bottom of the picture.
---
I win.
---
who care's rank 1 glad doesn't mean fucking shit this isn't retail wow pissbaby
---
Little dude takes his SM groups seriously.
---
I don't seek out pvp, but I really wish skeram was more even. Those free server transfers may have helped reduce the pop, but they also fucked the ratio. I feel bad for most alli on our server. I try to MC people to help get them into instances all the time. Except everyone from &lt;Pretty Good&gt;. They are always forming gank squads to 5+v1 people, but I literally never see them pvp alone.
---
I think axe is typically considered better due to spec'ing into the axe talent. 
---
Getting any of them at 30 is a huge benefit at that level. You won't be able to solo the quest until ~38 and at that point [bonebiter](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6830/bonebiter) from the SM quest is better. If getting carried to do it at 30, consider how much you're spending to do it. On my server if you bought the charms it'd be close to 10g. Not really worth it at that level.

---
Yes, that's a good idea amongst any opposite faction. The second I notice I'm outnumbered I take heavy precaution. However nothing I can do about a dbag rolling up as I solo a elite and get caught at 30% hp. Typically always better to avoid fights and congestion rather than resort to emotions / passion in fighting
---
They work on a effectiveness coefficient, and it depends on the skill.
---
Dots are base 15s but don't exceed it. So any dot 15s or longer gets 100% of spell power, but no more. Same for hots.  In both cases, the addition is spread across each tick.
---
Direct casts are based on 3.5s before talents.  sbolt = 3/3.5 = 85.7%.  Instants count as 1.5 (gcd).  Any ability that damages and heals gets the above calculation divided in two, aoe skills are divided by 3 (if channeled, spread across each time).
---
That works for all the rule of thumb stuff, there may be edge cases.
---
You have a threatmeter that works? I've downloaded one, but that doesn't work right. I have to rely on my threatplates as a tank. Would be nice to see a meter as well so I could more easily know how much wiggleroom I've got.
---
Is this from something? Why do I like it so much
---
I thought all the 60's complaining everyone else was slacking off and clearing mc was easy by now were the ones putting themselves on the pedestal
---
not that many quests give +alliance rep. most are for a specific faction.
---
Ok. But fyi, it does work in dungeons if you're soloing or with people who don't mind taking it slow. Not saying it works great, just that it sometimes does the trick.
---
Paladins can sometimes have some luck getting BOE int plate that won't sell on Horde side.
---
Fuck that guild. Just make friends with some tanks and healers. Then you just hit up your friends list and put together groups way faster. Especially if you make friends with tanks. Being amicable is huge plus for getting more invites from people. 
---
You're way better off waiting to find a guild until you meet some people that you like to play with. Find a guild with the culture you want, and not a guild to get epics fast. There's no rush unless you're super hardcore.
---
Dude demons are the reason orcs can't just shamanism and chill in the first place.
---
Only if they are the same group.
---
Basically when you kill a boss, you are saved to that instance ID and cannot join any other instance ID.
---
The instance ID that other party members will join to is the one that the leader owns, so in order to run the last 4 bosses the group lead needs to be someone else who is locked to that same instance ID.  It doesn't have to be the same person, but it does have to be someone already locked to it.
---
Yep. In all my experience since actual vanilla, the only real way to boost a character is multi-boxing, all at the same level.
---
Depends on what you want your gaming experience to be. No cross realm, thus all is server based. But keep fapping to site ranking rather than feel one with your community fam.
---
Stop saying hex
---
If you've got higher level friends def grab it. WW axe is gold for the early 30s, especially if you're on a pvp server and leveling in stv.
---
idsay from horde perspective that priest mainly does main tank heals and few pi priests group heal
---
 shamans are best on group heala and well druids, druids are druids
---
Probably addon is not uptaded on that and is bugged
---
Rogues. They love to gank.  World of rogue craft is also very annoying.  Will be nice when pvp trinket comes out.
---
Makes very little difference. All the best items are boe.
---
Gnomish is more fun for giggles though.
---
 You're bound to find a friend or guildy with the other specialization. 
---
The teleporter is probably the biggest deciding factor.
---
they post them for a reason. they generally are the scumbags that got outed by the guild they were once in

Hi, /u/evokenONE

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/djz3lf/whats_the_best_dire_maul_wing_for_healers_druid/). 
---
Those are a lot more elegant than what I've been doing, lol!
---
All our big, successful guilds (both factions) that are fielding raids and clearing content (and getting legendaries) are all allegedly made up of nazis who have insiders at Blizz feeding them good drops. 
---
Also being better organized in large-scale PvP is bullying and reportable.
---
Making an alt would solve this a lot better than a reddit post
---
Imagine doing a run without repair bot.. wtf guild is that lol
---
So what's the deal with the Halloween event? Go to different inn keepers and hope for something good? With an hour CD in-between visits?
---
That's fine, but the fact that your furies happen not to want CHT for whatever reason remains irrelevant to point that in general furies will roll on that against rogues given the chance, particularly this early in the server lifecycle. Some LC guilds even prio it warriors. You guys LC, DKP, or what?
---
They said there is a balance. Why are you acting as if they said all or nothing?
---
Amen. Druids kill it as MT heals. especially when they're not fighting to get those HoTs on.
---
google the 3 minute mage and see if that's your thing, lol
---
Would be true if I enjoyed having alts, which I don’t.
---
I'm playing on a tablet smartass
---
Why DKP is dumb, and loot council is the way to go. If you don’t trust your guild leadership? Maybe don’t be in that guild.
---
I was so excited to finally see Broken Tooth I B-lined it toward it and started taming, then I hear the cheap shot :(
---
It's its own show, but that show is bad.
---
Depends, if you want harder hits in general go AP, if you want more cries go agility. What’s the actual stats of the items?
---
A general question, but I'm playing a Rogue.
---
I've read somewhere that spirit is the most important stat for leveling, regarding your class. Supposedly it gives you least amount of downtime, and other stats like agility and strength make a small difference on low levels.
---
Is that true?
---
For example, should I rather take an item that gives +9 stamina, +9 spirit, instead of +9 stamina, +9 agility?
---
I still think stamina is important, so my priorities look like this:
---
1. Stamina
---
2. Spirit
---
3. Everything else
---
What do you guys think?

ironspine is 9 agility 4 str, assault band is 5 stamina 7 spirit 20 attack power on equip
---
Agility is your best friend. Crit and ap. I would say agi stam spirit
---
Well it only costs 20 focus so it can get a big threat dump from using it every time it can.  Carrion def is a legit option for off tanking, with the extra armour compared to owls or bats, combined with ap reduction from screech.  I got spiteflayer which has 1.2atkspeed as well so he's extra annoying vs casters.
---
I believe there are some quest that grant you rep but I'm not entirely sure, I'm new to vanilla
---
But that 2h axe is a hunter weapon
---
Or just start your own groups tbh.
---
Everyone rolls that didn’t get a bag yet. Round robin system for bags
---
Considered just going out and helping random people? 
---
Whenever I am feeling down or bored I offer to tank, dos, or heal for a lower level group looking to run an instance. 
---
It’s super low stress, I feel like an unstoppable god, and they are super grateful and will whisper me at 60 thanking me or will just wave to me in town. Really satisfying feeling. 
---
I just completed my Travelers set for RP and I plan to just travel Azeroth, looking for people asking for help on a quest and assist my siblings in the alliance in their own journeys across Azeroth.
---
So you think having +9 more agi, is better than +9 more stamina? 
---
Currently for me 10 agi is +1 more damage, 0.4% more crit chance, 1.3% more dodge.
---
It doesn't sound as useful as having buttloads of spirit so you can regen in stealth while you walk from mob to mob?
---
pvp swords can be very powerful, and you can deal with heavy hitters like warriors toe to toe. 
---
That said you can go hemo with good swords and rape face
---
Oh wait, you’re serious?
---
Let me laugh harder!
---
😆
---
Nope, you aren't wrong.
---
I suspect this is why healers on reddit are all complaining about mana while leveling. They read about downranking, try to do it while leveling, then run oom because it sucks.
---
Note that there are no mages in this group - probably why it’s so chill
---
The only downside for sure. Getting to BRM instances is a pain in the ass from TB.
---
Port to org and feel like you wasted gold, or fly and feel like you're wasting time. Then zep to grom gol. FP to Kargath. Then finally FP to Thorium Point (or the cave)
---
I just herb farm, every coup,e of days I get lucky and pass a lotus on my morning route. It’s nice.
---
I hate that. Especially since none of UC dismounts you, not even the elevator section!

Easy to play, hard to master. You don’t need any macros to manage. Just hotkey the forms if you don’t want to click them.
---
u want a mage for this run for the tiny packs when u torch the flames
---
Bath in the salty tears!!
---
You're such a fucking joke dude
---
wtf
---
Classic doesn’t hold your hand with rewards, the rewards are what YOU decide are rewarding. So set a goal and work towards it. If you want the game to do it for you, that is retail.
---
I play a rogue... One of the only classes 100% excluded from most cleave groups...
---
Their logs are objectively worse, and they have far less world pvp presence. What criteria are you using other than those?
---
down ranking is worth it, but, the problem is, you need a certain thresh hold (around 300?) to make it worthwhile and good. plus, down ranking for the sake of down ranking is also good; there's no reason to cast, say, Greater Heal 2 when you can heal someone with Heal 4, for example.
---
i try and keep at least one down ranked casted heal of both Priests long heal and Flash Heal. that's usually good enough.
---
lol no u didn't have yhat conversation
---
Wat, 3 levels per day easily doable
---
Oh daddy slapman....
---
Get atlas loot and inspect end game gear on a human to see what it will look like
---
r/kerning
---
Not really. ”Vanilla” in its finished state had 4 different raids, honor to grind and BG’s to play. 
---
What we have currently is just a fraction of it.
---
Funniest part of this for me is that when I played near launch? We called it both. DM was for the dungeon in general, see how far you could get, VC was specifically for runs where you planned to kill Van Cleaf.
---
I used it 5 or 6 hrs ago, yes it showed them all as level 0, but I was able to see 4 pages of rares and greens from DM farm that I vendored, select a boe I accidentally vendored (and logged), and have it sent to my mail for cod. Worked flawlessly just looked a little weird when selecting realm and character, rest was totally working and looked normal.
---
Lol, what did you say about [the 1v1 tips tournament?](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EHNIiWRU8AEPDjQ.jpg:large) 
---
Hunter placed number #2 in **TWO** out of the current 4 groups that have played, and one hunter placed #3 in groups with absolute beast players as well. Thats already 3/4th of the hunters being top 3. BuT HuNtErS SuCk? 
---
LMAO, so not only don't you know how to play,  you're just making things up on the spot as a means to project your incapabilities and incompetence as well. Yeah you suck, b2bfa bud.
---
As far as I’m aware you’ll just have to use memory, maybe put a sticky note near your PC that says YOU CAN RESS and try look at it often while you’re in a group haha
---
Yeah, have it on the bow rn
---
yup, this is how my guild did it in Vanilla.
---
Everyone has to be using it. Guilds will usually require it for just that reason.
---
The reason folks try to "force" you to tank, is because DPS are a dime a dozen and no one gives a shit about your damage.  
---
  
---
That said, if you said you were DPS and they still invited you that's bad on their end. In general I have a bad taste in my mouth for warriors that refuse to tank, but you are in the right here for sure.
---
Shuuuuu we don’t spread that knowledge. I got my epic mount off of my “fishing trips”
---
The more of these I see, the more I really want to start recording myself doing dungeons and make similar content 
---
My memes are [nowhere near as powerful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8GbEf_rIWk) as these glorious ones
---
True, i was mostly thinking about my experience, we have 6 locks in my raid so no room for extra things like that, and on gar everything gets banished then killed after, domo we sheep alot of stuff and anything that isnt would die before it triggers, sulfuron we just aor everything down in under a minute too.
---
Yes, that sounds like a perfectly reasonable method for leveling if speed is not your priority.
---
Aha, I only run pugs. My guild is just, ehm, real life people.
---
I always assumed this was part of the joke: he’s an (formerly) ultra-rich  asshole, and considers you so far beneath him and so poor that 2 gold would be life changing to you.
---
*cries in Taurahe*
---
Cause it fucking matters.
---
FUCK MAGES, FUCK SHEEP, FUCK FUCKING FUCK FROST NOVA THAT LASTS THROUGH FUCKING TOO MUCH DAMAGE, FUCK BLINK OUT OF STUNS, FUCK POM PYRO
---
So my raid group has a surprisingly low amount of DPS warriors, and even fewer 2h like me. I was talking to someone in the loot council, and they asked which I would prefer in the event we got a drop: BRE or spinal reaper
---
My instinct is to say BRE, but there seem to be a lot of mixed opinions on whether or not it’s actually better than spinal. I’m an orc warrior so the +5 weapon skill would make itemization better, and would reduce glancing blow penalties etc. Would the armor debuff on BRE outweigh this? If my guild is stacking sunder/FF/CoR/annihilator, would the armor pen be wasted?
---
As for pvp would the ArPen on BRE make it that much better than the rage on kill? More importantly which one will improve my gnome smashes/minute by a larger amount
---
Sorry for the amount of questions but it’s hard to find concrete data, as several different sources have different armor values for bosses
---
Just go my route and take it slow with leveling. I almost have my third 60 just pushing slow and enjoying the process.
---
Who?
---
Thanks for the quick response. What level would u recommend spec back to ret
---
Nah I agree. My mining route runs me past three chests thatI end up looting probably 5 times a night. Don’t even remember the last time I saw a green. Chests were nerfed to be total crap as far as I can tell.
---
actualy as lock ur wors stat is the intelect after sporot. u need spell/shadow power and stamina. that rod is crap for locks.
---
It does
---
They didnt actually say they are rich, thats why he said " retained his worthless existence as a human" :DDDD
---
It definitely *was* balanced.  Ally on Smolderweb and I'd be shocked if it isnt closer to 65/35 now.
---
The 30-50 zones often feel like Horde starting zones.  I'm attempting to stem the death spiral that imbalance can brings.
---
It's got busy Alliance cities and grouping is easy enough.  There is a critical mass of players on Ally to play for the foreseeable future, but quest zones and dungeon entrances are mostly owned by Horde.
---
When he gets back on I will reply to the post
---
My rogue guildy lost hoj to a dumbass hunter if that makes you feel better.
---
Its quicker for me to vendor an item and take a loss than run to town and hope to make that few extra silver.
---
It's not that I dont enjoy it I really do, it's more the time factor for me that gets in the way lol!
---
Does alliance have a similar event?
---
Screech has a very high threat component with the debugf, it's fine to leave on auto.  Auto screech and growl will hold aggro better than any other pet skill combo.  Not to mention that since it costs 20 focus it can be used more often than claw meaning more crits to feed frenzy uptime, leveling as BM
---
Isboxer, can run it all on 1 pc, can "broadcast" keys to all accounts at once
---
"Hey we need a warrior for our group"
---
"Sorry, im pvp arms"
---
"nah its ok you can dps"
---
\*joins\*
---
"Welcome, tank"
---
Let them have their fun
---
Bless you. Been solo farming that hell hole all day and have been using my lok’delar staff bc I can’t hit anything with 0 2h sword skill on barb blade. (Those dogs are bitches and you’re gonna have to melee them at some point, don’t judge me.)
---
Dang, Resto pots only 1g over on bigglesworth!
---
How can anyone downvote this gold
---
Assault band is definitely one of the better pre raid rings for dps
---
About to hit 60 as a a dorf. Can anyone recommend a gear resource that goes beyond BiS? It would be nice to filter gear based on a certain stat, say, Agility or Attack Power, and search for alternative gear sets. There are a lot of BiS guides out there but I'm interested in creating my own personal BiS rather than just relying on wowheads infinite wisdom, or at least doing some research to verify what wowhead has put together.
---
go world pvp at lights hope or black rock mountain, get a different set of gear going via dungeons etc
---
Still funny when you see sometimes you see fury warriors "LFM TANK UD STRAT CLOAK RES" And he's been spamming for 2+ hours.
---
Just throw on a shield and tank it yourself, fucker.
---
I didn't miss the joke, I just continued the discussion. You don't have to stop the conversation after someone makes a joke.
---
This has to be posted by Mad Season.
---
Thanks
---
Ptfg plz lol
---
I know what you feel. It's good that you took time to share.
---
Multi shot and aimed shot also scale based on your weapons damage, so slower weapons increase their damage more
---
If you have help getting everything, the axe will change your life for the entire lv30 bracket unless you replace it with Bonebiter or Ravager
---
Your time will come!
---
Lol thank you
---
xD
---
*Casual as a mage - PRO*
---
Relatively easy levelling experience 
---
Good survivability in most open world PvP scenarios
---
Not gear dependent
---
Easy to play adequately with little skill
---
Option to AOE grind either in dungeons or world 
---
Teleport is convenient
---
*Casual as a mage - CON*
---
Hope you don’t mind sitting and drinking for 30-40 seconds because that’s you after every 2-4 pulls
---
Hard to gear up when you hit 60 due to competition for loot
---
Intense competition for raid spots, I’ve seen 8 mages scrap over loot while druids locks and hunters collect items by default
---
So conclusion; if you just want to have fun levelling and see the dungeons, maybe PUG a raid or two but don’t really care about pushing endgame, then mage is a great casual class. If you want to push endgame with less relative effort, then choose hunter or lock.
---
Bonebiter &gt; WW axe
---
I give a friend world chat moderation privileges and he goes on a banning spree every time. 
---
Everyone hates him.
---
No one has realised it's me who gives him mod every time.
---
also, you can buy all fifteen green hills pages and turn them in on your way to farm the tusks. a cool 8000 xp and a pair of plate boots for the bank.

Classic has been going back to usual toxic/retail play in my experience.
---
Did you make this?
---
There is a point where swimming is slower than the boat. Basically if you are in the middle of the city and the boat is on the backside of the island, the boat is faster.
---
We do an open gold bid where the gold goes to the guild bank. Usually goes for 150g-200g.
---
Well, seems like you rushed to 60 and are so nearsighted, you aren't enjoying the game. Farm bis. Farm rep. Help others level. Be social. If only thing you have to do is raid then I'd say it's your fault for nolifing the game and getting burnt out.
---
Well, if all that was said in that printscreen is true and you specifically didnt heal only the mage, then YATA...
---
I feel like mages are actually more in demand than healers. It's by far the most-searched DPS class, probably because of the free water and AoE potential. Never had a group where we had to wait for a healer much.
---
This shit right here. The fact any LF tank post on Skeram is immediately met with an ask price is shit. 
---
Also it has turned every warrior on the server into a complete asshole. Heads the size of blimps.
---
Seriously just go unguilded until you meet people in a dungeon or in the game that you enjoy playing with. Join LFG channel to find groups or start your own. I only play 4-5hrs a week due to work and family commitments and I manage to find groups as a dps that is unguilded at lvl38
---
&gt; I’m a furry warrior
---
No need to share your fetishes here.
---
That one guy is the most killedest guy.
---
Less agi means less damage being done, and thus more being taken, and thus more downtime. 
---
Whereas more agi makes regen less important, because faster killing and higher dodge means you’re not losing as much HP in the first place.
---
Yeah dodged a bullet, bunch of fucking tools lol
---
Going slow? Yeah right lol!
---
You take a step into the Stormwind inn when a warrior gnome says "Welcome to the club, buddy" and slaps your ass. Your actions?
---
So pve spinal&gt;&gt;&gt;BRE, pvp BRE&gt;spinal?
---
Most don’t know how to use it methinks. I told one to use it to break a fear on himself. He said he didn’t knew it did that.
---
Typical horde reply
---
Downrank for smaller heals so you don't overheal. Every single hp healed after max hp is a 100% Mana waste. Also try your best to utilize your mp5 by not spamming heals and letting your regen do it's thing between heavy damage
---
People like OP bitch for the sake of bitching. Anything you say he will take the negative path and start attacking you. Best not to waste your breath on people like that.
---
i sincerely regret letting an orc tame broken tooth, horde players are just... the worst tbh.
---
What program do you use to edit videos?
---
Hadn't even seen the bitching cuz I avoid the pig seen. Gotta open up LFG/WOLRD to tell him to eat a dick.
---
If your mom counts as a daily I've been doing pretty well!! #getwrecked #noscoped360

---
When was it funny?
---
LmaoO mind games has one of the most toxic players I’ve ever seen
---
Jaedan broke that guild in half on like week 3 because he was trying to poach 60’s from literally every other guild
---
Ahh yeah got ya.
---
By limiting the audience of their message. Trade is not global and LFG is. There is no reason to avoid crossposting to LFG if you are going to be posting into Trade. My comment is specifically about the people who ONLY use Trade.
---
Sorry but blizzard isn't going to cater to just you because you no lifed the game during phase 1 and have nothing to do.
---
Lol go resto, or oomkin. If your username is true!
---
Oh yeah Desolace is always empty. Go to STV instead I guarantee you'll see people.
---
I’d say something like a shaman or warlock where you can beat shit down and heal yourself back up... I main hunter and people suggesting hunter are right in some ways, but needing food, pet food, water, arrows, and having limited bag space makes it hard to save money, so you have to sink your time into grinding mobs or doing some sort of profession for gold
---
Yep, so the game is just not for you. Could always come back when it’s all out.
---
Kill stuff, Pick stuff, Make Stuff, Sell Stuff
---
This! I'd expect that answer to be a "Be aware that my healing might not be as perfect as you are used to"
---
I'll play, but I'm a level 60 undead rogue, where are you questing?
---
I got a filthy dwarf scum mask.
---
Thank you. This was my grieving process and the more I think about it f anyone that has a problem with it.
---
Okay, so your logic says that a layer has to be full before people gets put in another layer?
---
True, but then you have the hassle of having to log out and /reset the dungeon
---
Yea, that would be &lt;SEND IT&gt;. Some other guild has been unbanning people periodically when they get control of it though
---
Yea that discord is super tryhard with theorycrafting, can pretty much trust anything official posted there.
---
I think you missed my point. That's a valid argument, but instead of providing it, OP just sinks to their level. To what end?
---
Get all the people who regularly downvote/upvote posts, plus all the moderators from all subreddits and put them in a room together. What do you think they would look like? A perfect representation of humanity?
---
Very nice! You use some add-on for the quest log?
---
The fight club discord has accurate BiS lists for all races and for 2h/dual wield.
---
How can you be at 20g as a lvl 40?? What are you using your gold on? I'm a warrior and I hit 40 with 95g
---
That was 15 year old me to a tee! Same race/class and I felt like a baller with my half blue gear! Dueling outside org instead of grinding mats for pots!!
---
I can’t quest solo efficiently. I’m completely dependent on groups for efficiency.  I’m proud  that I’m a dependable healer.  People have taken notice and whisper me with invites. I have been running with the same tank for over a week now.
---
It definitely doesn't apply to tanks. And I now think it's an overstated meme, actually.
---
Lol at you not realizing that the type of person to want an unmoderated sub is not the type of person to make a sub. An ounce of critical thinking gets you there, but you couldn’t quite scrape enough together
---
think its just called questlog extended yeah
---
the ravager is such a good weapon. i've been tanking sm cath and rfd while a full ret with it. lmao
---
Go to desolace. Jump in the water near the horde city and find the shell cages. 5 shell fish = 55s (turn them in on the bridge)
---
Around 10g / hour
---
I played vanilla up through WOTLK and never had to put up with bullshit like that in any of the guilds I joined and yes they did raid and pvp as a guild though not to a super hardcore level
---
Hinterlands
---
setting up for sunken temple one run 100% too
---
If it's Horde, was the guild Scum?
---
Lfg fires up every time someone posts selling Tanking services
---
Mmkay buddy. You can have your last word now.
---
That's gonna be a yikes from me
---
If you're going oom too often, it could be that the dps is low and fights are carrying on for too long, or you don't have high enough int, or you're not letting yourself regen mana (following the 5sr).
---
&gt; So anyway I started blessing
---
FTFY
---
This hexo guys sounds like the moron in this Story
---
Lol. While this isn't terribly uncommon, most of the time it's a false perception. If someone has full attendance, full consumables, nice player, topping meters, and getting passed for loot in favor of a low-tier player that's just a RL friend of leadership, then yeah, that's messed up. But a lot of the time, the players putting in the most effort and sacrifice are the leaders of the guild, and the loot benefits them most (assuming it's a good guild). Again, might not be your situation, can't tell. Hope you find a good fit.
---
Can’t wait to do this with gnomer... again...
---
That burn lol
---
[deleted]
---
Just write it out nobody cares about videos
---
Thanks for this. Sounds like Edgemaster's are good for non-human alliance for quite a while but that it's possible to replace those gloves in AQ40, long before KT, if you get the dagger (and the gloves). Honestly it's a relief to me! Much nicer to have a potential upgrade in P5.
---
Good job bud
---
lol
---
I would play this game.
---
What's the macro command to call another macro?
---
Dude, that’s wild. People get soooo sketchy with “power” in this game. Higher level or higher rank in guild, or a class that is needed more than others, irs crazy seein how people behave.
---
Reserving items is about power.
---
If the run won't happen unless person X gets Y if it drops, then there's two responses - you either let them take it, or the run won't happen.
---
Now, people who could be replaced easily and on short notice don't have that power - and that means rogues, mages, warlocks , hunters, dps warriors, ret paladins and cat druids don't have a lot of negotiation if the tank goes 'I'm only coming if I get X'.
---
Tanks, generally, do, and have incentive to do so because tanking for random DPS is shit, and if you're running with friends you know and like you don't need to reserve stuff, because people go 'Of course you should get X'.
---
So. Yeah. 
---
If you don't like it, roll a tanking class and tank.
---
Trying a bit too hard to be funny here... Or maybe hes serious?
---
[What would you guys sell these mail healing legs for?](https://i.imgur.com/yYREgQR.png)

HUNTER MAKES SUPERIOR USE OF AGILITY! ALSO GO TO UNDEAD STRATHOLME AND STEAL THAT CROSSBOW FROM HUNTERS IF U REALLY WNANA PISS THEM OFF
---
The night elf cunt
---
As we used to say in my old raid group, dead DPS do no DPS.
---
Not rly lol. Just said it was to be expected so they could have planned better.
---
To all those who play hybrid classes in classic:  
---
"Bring the class, not the spec."
---
What the hell are you trading away your epic mount for, to prove your cool or something?
---
Play stupid games, etc
---
You dont need spirit as a rogue.....at all.....
---
hey it' sjust like retail lol
---
Its the best spot to earn gold for 40 Mount..  but it's getting more popular so try to farm it at odd times
---
Remember:
---
-Spend a bit of time searching the area and plan a route or two. The cages respawn rather quickly. If the route is contested try to find a new route
---
- either you go for the cracks in the ground with bubbles or you buy waterbreathing potions. The first option will reduce your gold / hour but you wont spend gold in stupid potions 
---
- there is a belt with +15% swimming speed. 
---
Only invest if you're sure the area is not impossible to farm. 
---
Gl!
---
You should see it with windfury : D
---
i cant tell , when he laughs it seems like a joke but it also looks like he has snapped lol
---
Honestly, as long as all loot rules are stated at the beginning, then I have no issues with loot reservation at all.
---
Alt Z is your friendo
---
No rispeck, no rispeck.
---
Strongly disagree. I think classic team is killing it.
---
Fuck you, leatherman!
---
As a warrior I had mount money by 40 I didn’t really do anything special tbh, I skin/mine but mostly kept ores/bars and vendor most low skins until thick which I ah’d
---
Always made bag room to vendor trash and usually ah’d greens away unless it was near vendor value, other than that I really didn’t do anything special and just kind of forget about gold so I wouldn’t spend, might be worth doing some sm arms or cath runs making gold that way, ahing stacks of silk as you’ll be flooded by it
---
Too low dps, squishy tank, no CC, no aggro management or focus targeting are the main reasons for healer ooming, of which you have no control.
---
Overhealing, keeping everyone at 100 %, and never leaving the 5sr are the main culprits that you do have control over.
---
Based on the amount of work you've done after a meeting with 4 x Dunning-Kruger effect, I think you're gonna be a great healer.
---
Don't let them get to you. It's been "the healer's fault" for 15 years, and for some, that will always be their perspective. Add them to your ignore list.
---
Sucks that you bought all those +heal items. They're kind of shit at lvl 48. Get some spirit, and make sure you use your highest rank heal until you're geared enough that a lower rank may be more efficient (+300 ish heal). Avoid overhealing. Don't heal chip dmg on the dps, and let morons who refuse to watch their aggro die. This ensures high healing per mana, and as much time as possible regenerating mana in combat (get fsr addon). As long as you do this, you can be certain it's not your fault.
---
Know exactly how you feel. Got all professions to 300 including fishing and cooking. Got epic mount and expensive boe epics aswell as all the preraid bis. Enchants are in place too and I'm still more than 1k gold even though I don't care to farm. 
---
All i have to do now is help friends gear their chars and said 3-4 hours a week.
---
I wish atleast battlegrounds were a thing... i know its an unpopilar opinion on reddit but atm there's too little content out for those of us who have been 60 for some weeks.
---
+5 strength to bracers costs 20-25 silver.
---
Just saying.
---
Ice cream bikini girls
---
more dumbass retail retards
---
Downranking does jack if you don't have +healing. You can use downranked spells for heals and topping off players but a priests bread and butter in 5 mans is max rank greater heal plus and immediate renew and start to regen mana. The issue is all these dumbass retail retards that pull aggro left and right causing you to never be able to regen any mana because you are constantly healing every party member. This is NOT how the game is supposed to be played. Healers don't have infinite mana like in retail.
---
Slow and steady so I don't burn out.
---
Dugi and Zygor guides are similar in the way they work, but are made and distributed by different people.
---
The alliance event is to come over and kill the guards guarding the wickerman for the same buff.  Not really an event but...  Uh, yeah--
---
Memes are supposed to be relatable aren't they?
---
I feel ya man, not used to a monthly sub after all these years not playing, my account lapsed last week and I gotta wait until next week to play again, jonsing for some Azeroth but it’s my fault for not being more prepared.
---
Voidwalker doesn't have taunt, does not work that way...

Powershifting still has about an 80% chance of taking Leader of the Pack away too.

I think some mobs in scholo will mana burn you in bear-form/cat-form *sometimes* as well.

There's nothing wrong with that. I'm just talking about the things you do decide to put on the AH.
---
Agi/str. 
---
Find any mage when you're leveling and pay them 50s for a full trade window of food. 
---
Eat 10-15s between pulls.
---
Just discovered you. So very glad I did. Subbed on YT too
---
Ayy: lmao...
---
Hold on I'm going to roll off this horse by rollin on to a slightly smaller horse and then onto a pony and come over there and kick ur ass.
---
yes they are.
---
Had no idea. No I’m psyched. Which specialisation is hide of the wild? Same as the scale cloak?
---
With a game full of bugs, layering, lack of communication about DM, no keyring?
---
Fair enough though, he might wait longer for people that don't need gems.
---
I'm thinking I'll need to start doing it for the last gem, as going through the entire dungeon, with an already 40% drop chance only to lose to someone else, when there's nothing else I need that deep in lbrs, shitty feelz.
---
Thing is, people didn't know shit when vanilla came out so raids like MC took days to finish. Now everyone knows everyone and rag goes down in a few hours. The phasing doesn't fit with the times.
---
What’s the population like
---
Don’t items in your bag also take durability damage on death?
---
Man, that sucks. It's not fun to be in a situation where you have to settle with a guy like that in order to get your quest done. 
---
I definitely feel like people have become way more selfish this time around - at least I don't remember it being this bad in vanilla/BC/previous expansions. 
---
I'm happy you got your mount done, though - congrats! :)
---
Bad luck sorry but your action bar is painful to lok at  but if you like it it's cool but i would change 
---
Scroll forward to pet attack 
---
Scroll back pet follow
---
Forward page to ranged auto attack 
---
Shift page forward to aspect of the cheeta 
---
Shift page back to aspect of the hawk
---
Shift mouse scroll button to aspenlct of the monkey
---
Really makes a difference playing.
---
R-e-s-t-e-c-p
---
Key ring is later - they said it would be later. The game has always had bugs in it and probably always will. What do you mean lack of communication about DM?  They’re doing everything they’ve said they were going to do so far. Haven’t not delivered. They’re doing a fantastic job with classic
---
You need the rep to *use* the mount do you not?
---
Just said why, but yes, it is good for pve
---
Horde players pick horde so its easier thou hahah

Make a macros that can fast unequip your weapon if you certainly gonna die, helps a lot

Subtle flex..

“One of my 60s”
---
I understand this practice only when you have 4M party made with friends or guildy and you decide to go into a dungeon to get a specific item for one of your party members. You now search for a random person and demand that the item you want it's reserved. 
---
If the entire party is made of PUG I don't really see a reason for anyone to accept it, unless it's a very strange hour when you know you can wait 1 hour to be able to make a party. In this case, as someone said above, it's all about power.
---
It’s clearly meant for a Balance Druid
---
Cat.
---
But I'm missing some critical talents that are necessary for healing efficiently.
---
Reserving by a tank or mostly guild group is fine as long as it's clearly stated while forming the group.
---
They said key ring would be first patch in phase 1
---
My advise to you, is just be another dps on trash pulls, until boss then use a sheild. At 60, as prot people do the same things but you have more tools to deal with it. Makes tanking more fun at max level.
---
Those members just gotta learn that their guild is doing scummy shit, not grouping with them will do that.
---
You are just on a bad trip. Everyone knows windfury only procs when someone is at 1% HP... :P
---
You shouldn't do the stuff you do... it's clearly not giving a a good trip.
---
In Classic WoW, the Keyring will not be implemented on launch, but on the first Classic patch. It is currently unknown if this means the Keyring will be added in Phase 2 or earlier.
---
I've been using it for around an hour now and I gotta say... Wow! This addon is fantastic!! I've been doing everything that it's doing manually all this time. I didn't even think that something like this would be entirely possible. Thank you so much for this I love it
---
From my perspective it's the alliance that are evil!
---
implying horde has any self awareness
---
I've been editing for quite a while now and content like this is just so fun to make, I just really wanna do better each time I receive comments like this :D
---
Tipsoutbaby his channel on twitch ofc, the little payo ftw ofc!
---
raiding with ms isnt good since propably you arent allowed to use ms cause of the debuff limit. 
---
pvp = ms
---
raid = fury
---
Bu buying this harness from AH, you made one lvl1 tauren rich.
---
I'm tempted to say that warr was dumb, as torch room mobs have low health and die fast, but otoh he could've been holding off to allow the tank to keep aggro.  If he wasn't using WW period at any point even in multi mob pulls where the tank had aggro, then yeah the warr was dumb.
---
&lt;3
---
Yeah my Problem ist, with a Baby at Home I can Play Here and there 30min or an hours of the Baby falls asleep, So this doesnt realy work
---
My question is how are they in hyjal?
---
Zardoz!!!!
---
Sorry I’m new to WoW, what do you mean by dead zone? (Also just came across this post super late)
---
Have people forgotten Gouge or something?
---
I just wanna say shaman can grounding totem Eranikus sleep and it doesn’t destroy the totem. Makes this fight stupid easy.
---
LOL! I meant it more like I deal with it from multiple roles and it's not a good way to run dungeons. I can see how it's a flex too I guess.

Instantly use pots when in form and shift back. Cancelauras are to fixa bug with powershifting. Also works with things like Crystal Charge (/use [@cursor] Crystal Charge), Sapper Charges and things like Demonic Runes. Just be sure to use it outside GCD or shifting back won't work.
---
Honestly so happy to read this
---
About 50-60 angerforge runs here, if not more, and I have not once seen Hand of justice even drop at all.
---
Finally it sold for 288 gold :) not bad I guess.
---
Thank you papi
---
When they launch BC servers.
---
In seriousness, T0.5 when AQ patch comes.
---
I did an UBRS run today.. both swords dropped and the same rogue won both of them.
---
sell them, definitely. i'd just look at other items around the same power range and base them off that. like, on my server, they'd go for like... 15-20g.
---
You better start believing in ghost stories.. YOU'RE IN ONE!
---
My pleasure :)
---
The same applies to Fury in that regard.
---
Only when you spirit rez.
---
Yikes
---
I got a torch of austen in that very chest the other day. Not spectacular but a few gold at AH at least :)
---
You can put a shirt on lol
---
Final update: sold for 288g
---
Some of the mistakes I made: I put it on for 24h in the morning, so there was not much competition; I could have made it wayy more fun. Like for example, giving it as a reward for druids only, the first one whi brings me 7 arcane crystals or something.
---
Oh well. Cheers!
---
Drop rates seem so weird on the bindings though. The guild im in already has both.
---
Trick or treat quests are super good for rep.
---
Doesn't matter that half the Alliance racials are powerful when those races are much less appealing and therefore unpopular.

Nice vid, dude!

I swear it was supposed to be released like last December?

Hey buddy, I think you got the wrong door.
---
Now you can have your loot and eat it too.
---
It's loot with appeal.
---
they are not exclusive concept. Being slow doesnt make it social
---
It's a known average.  9%, unless you have a weapon racial, in which case it's 6%.

Next Friday will be another, there's some more here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgdyswgFk7pcF6SFcNaWthA

Most people with Details! are getting a threat metre at the same time, it’s quite reliable but everyone has to have it.

Damn. And I remember when people were saying Brazilians would be a tiny fraction of the sever. Glad I avoided that mess.

Guy who "owned" world chat being a lulcow that has been kicked from every guild on the server now (and banned from world chat).  
---
People running or failing at running pug raids with stupid loot priorities (striker's mark hunter etc.)  
---
Biggest alliance guild getting increasingly cuntish towards most horde and colluding with one mediocre horde guild while pvp doesn't even matter yet and no world bosses are out. Simultaneously getting increasingly cuntish towards their own faction. Simultaneously some alliance transferring off the server, tilting it from an okay 60-40 to harder horde dominance.   
---
People looking for a tank for hours but refusing to pay for quality tanking services.
---
So everything as normal.
---
I never said that lol
---
I love how you put words in my mouth
---
No.  You will be doing some amount of donations.  To minimize the amount needed, you'd need to roll a human (+10% rep bonus racial), and go straight to Teldrassil at lvl 1 and start questing there, and play through the Nelf zones exclusively for max rep gain from quests.  Can do this with any char, obviously, but it's faster as a human.
---
As a prot warrior, the only people I have added to friend list are healers. I remember good DPS, but at the same time, I would never bother starting a group unless I had a healer secure; filling with DPS takes minutes, finding a healer is the only hard part for a tank.
---
Has it been confirmed as a bug?
---
I played vanilla. I'm playing classic now. I never touched a single expansion between them. The classic team has done a fantastic job, because I honestly can't tell the difference from vanilla.
---
Watch out, such a maintank can outgear the guild and get poached by some hotshot guild.   LIke the star player of Ajax gets bought by the bigger Barcelona team

Don't bring Noggenfogger elixir for lube into an orgy?  Pretty self explanatory there.

Your videos have easily become my favorite thing on this sub. I love videos with this memey edit style.  Looking forward to the next!
---
&gt; and warriirs dont replace them til p3, and the replacement is wsg exalted kegs iirc.
---
And the alternative is the pvp set legs...and given alliance's dismal pvp record...
---
I've been using the tinythreat plugin of Details. Enough people are using it that I haven't run into issues.
---
I mean he was out of line being so aggressive but I suppose you should make sure to ask the tank to hold aggro or make sure the healer heals you.  Better ask them first so they know you need that.
---
I have absolutely no problem with groups reserving items. It's 100%ok with me. Because I, as everyone else can choose to join those groups or not. I choose not to, because I think it's stupid. But that's just my opinion and people who don't share that opinion can do whatever they want.
---
This is a non issue
---
&gt;then it tells me his time is more valuable than mine.
---
He's in demand. It IS more valuable by default.
---
Unless it's changed, Whitemane or Blaumeaux are the highest pop servers.  Not sure about faction balance.
---
Icehud is a pretty decent add-on, only shows combo points as a number though.
---
There's no award for ending the boss fight at full mana. If you can heal enough to win (and you can) then your heals are efficient as they need to be.
---
&gt; They do it because they're playing the metres instead of the game. Because rogues take a few seconds to ramp up DPS they pick the X because they're building combo points and don't want the skull to die before they can use them.
---
Or you know, build combo points and activate SnD for the next fight or two...
---
My groups sometimes look to me to keep the mob healers locked down (cheap shot, kick, gouge, kidney punch etc) while they burn down a higher priority target. I guess some groups just don't like having a plan!
---
Good for you man, everybody hung up on the word bis seriously trash. Nice guide and explanation
---
That and the wilson scream
---
Or you just don't want to heal, period.  If he had rolled a mage you wouldn't even have the option of him healing so just pretend that's what he rolled.  Warriors ever DPSing instances when the number of instances that can be run currently is legitimately gated by the number of people tanking, and when tanking is basically just DPSing but with different buttons, is idiotic, but there are way too many healers in Classic so asking a DPS to heal just because they have healing spells is silly.
---
Go any spec you want and farm maraudon. Easy money.
---
Not a hassle for me i just do AH on other char for 2 mins
---
Been doing that in mara fine
---
PSA: Corrupted Night Dragons are still bugged in Felwood. Don't waste your salves.
---
Buddy that only works when the stuff drops.
---
I spent a full year in vanilla running UBRS with no rogues or druids to get my Shadowcraft chest piece. RNG is RNG and some people have better luck than others. Sure you can run more instances but I promise you it’s no guarantee you’ll get what you want.

---
&gt;After your main-hand hits you press this macro to cast and then instantly cancel Heroic Strike.
---
&gt;With that in mind, your off-hand is tied to the 24% cap UNLESS you use this macro. When you Heroic Strike cancel properly it applies the 6% hit cap to your off-hand instead. 
---
I thought HS needs to be queued up to have this bug work. So when you instantly cancel it, I'd think it's not queued up anymore and you will get the 24% instead of 6% penalty again. Is that wrong? Don't you need to wait until juuust before your MH actually hits to cancel the HS?
---
Any food including mage conjured food. Very easy to keep happy
---
This will sound a little overly complex, but I love it. See https://wow.gamepedia.com/Macro_conditionals for conditionals to macros. To use the macros, we need to set up 4 buttons. 2 buttons are used for your shield combo, the other not. 
---
1.  Mainhand (2h or 1h, offensive)
---
2.  Offhand (1h, offensive (Fury))
---
3.  Mainhand (1h, defensive, can be the same as 1.)
---
4.  Shield
---
We need to figure out what the codified name is for these buttons. If you use normal bars, it can be something like BottomLeftButton4. In Bartender, it is BT4Button[number] (eg. bar 8 has buttons 85 - 97, so BT4Button85 is the first button on the 8th bar). Some experimentation and googling may find you the right word.
---
Switch to offensive weapons (1 and 2):
---
    /stopcasting
---
    /click BT4Button93
---
    /click BT4Button94
---
What are BT4Button93/94? 93 is weapon 1, 94 is weapon 2.
---
Switch to defensive weapons (3 and 4):
---
    /click BT4Button95
---
    /click BT4Button96
---
Now we can make a swap macro too (where 91 is offensive, 92 is defensive):
---
    /click [equipped:shields] BT4Button91
---
    /click [noequipped:shields] BT4Button92
---
All you need to do is update the buttons with your latest weapons. Here's a few more:
---
    #showtooltip
---
    /click [stance:3] BT4Button92
---
    /click [stance:2] BT4Button91
---
    /cast [stance:3] Defensive Stance
---
    /cast [stance:2] Battle Stance
---
    /cast [stance:1] Berserker Stance
---
    
---
Goes "left" on the stance bar, equipping defensive weapons on Defensive Stance. (berserker &gt; defensive &gt; battle &gt; berserker)
---
    /click [stance:1] BT4Button92
---
    /cast [stance:3] Battle Stance
---
    /cast [stance:2] Berserker Stance
---
    /cast [stance:1] Defensive Stance
---
Goes "right" on the stance bar.
---
I hope I explained it properly.
---
Done between 20-30 runs, got OH and only one OH dropping, never MH.
---
Its pure RNG, if you are lucky you will get it.
---
Should have just farmed gold for Krol, would have been quicker.
---
Ralph Tauren, I would appreciate it if you would step off my, Tommy Hoofiger's, business.
---
Yeah it's called Deep Slumber but it is functionally the same as Banish.
---
You can't really call it a struggle when it's your own choice not to join the group.
---
No way the drop rate is that low...
---
One of the perks have having a nice mage in the group is free water.
---
A perk of having a tank, well you don't have to pay his armor repairs so do not offer your tank anything.

There is a repeatable quest in the Swamp of Sorrows where you find crates and turn them backvfor SW rep. That's how he did it.
---
Hillsbradman
---
??????
---
There's quite a few changes, the majority of which are AI-related though a handful of quest tweaks. Biggest example is "Idle Pathing":
---
In Vanilla, mobs would stand still, walk in a line, stop, wait, then turn and walk in another line, making it possible for Rogues to get behind them without a ton of risk if they paid attention, but still had the chance of bad timing and being run in to.
---
In Classic, mobs are on fucking crack. They hardly EVER sit still. They will walk here, there, everywhere. They will wander like a boat, they will wander around your moat. They'll walk over there, turn and immediately go over here, then go "oh shit I left the oven on" and run in a third direction and not stand still for the next fucking 3 minutes I shit you not, making it extremely frustrating for Rogues to maneuver around them let alone backstab/ambush.
---
Likewise, many mobs have had their chase speeds altered - Treants are now race cars and will run you the fuck over.
---
Aggro-wise, in Vanilla, you would hit a mob and keep its' attention until you stopped attacking it long enough to leash. In Classic, if you damage a mob once, it's going to hunt you down like a Wookiee with the opposite of a Life Debt until you either die, or find a way to make it go into Evasion mode(e.g; in water for beasts that don't swim).
---
I'm pretty sure aggro range is a little wonky too, but I can't quite prove this one.
---
I'll tell you one thing though, in my entire fucking time playing since Launch, Vanilla never let a mob run through walls, and being feared through them was rare. In Classic, it happens fucking -constantly-. (which, funnily enough, is something that occurs normally on pservs too...makes you wonder where Blizz got their base code fo Classic from since the original was supposedly lost \*cough\*)

I personally love playing on the underdog side. It may seem bad now, but as soon as BGs are implemented, I’ll be enjoying my instant queues while horde will be waiting a minimum of 30minutes before getting into a game.
---
Reroll elsewhere while you still can OP.
---
Wolf def has the best animations in the game hands down
---
even then, does one really get honor from players who are in the 'grey zone' of levels compared to the attacker?
---

---
Arms is incredibly good for tanking. No excuse not to tank dungeons as a warrior.
---
&lt;Thunderbluff Steakhouse&gt; has been pretty chill
---
Its because mages make a run easier and faster, but theyre not absolutely needed like a healer unless youre doing some specific stuff.
---
Frost mages are the chillest of all. You’ll really appreciate all that ice cold conjured water in the deeper reaches of BRD when you’re sweating so much your armour rusts.
---
Doesn’t matter you, blue stupid cornflake!
---
You have 9 pve server versus 26 pvp! Overall you will have more horde than alliance in bgs!
---
Just make the fucking water/food/portal and shut the fuck up. It's a max 3 clicks, God damn no wonder people hate mages.
---
As a mage, shadowpriests. I don't stand a chance. At least I can run away from them most of the time. Unless they get lucky with blackout or terrain
---
Too sum it up: 
---
I’m a priest and none of your are entitled to any of my heals! I might heal you, but don’t expect me to waste time on buffing you
---
Go arms and you’ll be fine. Though at 57 you could totally do a hybrid spec.
---
Kind of old drama at this point but there’s a huge guild of Taiwanese players that followed this streamer to the server and that’s causing more Taiwanese players to roll on the server.

Yeah but that breaks the gcd check. I'm still looking for a power shift macro that both fixes that bug and is spammable on gcd without leaving you out of form.
---
&gt; not absolutely needed like a healer unless youre doing some specific stuff.  
---
For sure, but healers are rarely what's lacking in a group. Probably because everyone recommended playing healers because they are always needed ;).

😂 I got a 60 mage and I agree with you, it takes a few seconds, cost a few silver to make a portal. Who gives a shit it's a game man these guys crying over entitlement get a grip

**An all-in-one macro for multiple situations in which you would want to use Blind.**
---
showtooltip Blind
---
/cast [@mouseover, harm, exists, nodead] Blind
---
/cast [harm] Blind
---
/use [mod:shift] Heavy Runecloth Bandage
---
/use [mod:ctrl] Heavy Mageweave Bandage
---
/use [@player]
---
Just pressing the keybind for Blind will Blind your target. Pressing the keybind while your cursor is on something other than your target will Blind the mouse over instead. Using the modifiers shift and control will use the appropriate bandage for either, however you will most likely be using this in a one on one scenario. Blind is great to have a bandaging script attached because you are guaranteed to get the entire bandage off!
---
Also works well with Gouge, just replace Blind in the script. Gouge bandages are good for when you only need a few ticks to stay in the fight and your blind is on CD.
---
**Slice and Dice + Blade Flurry**
---
showtooltip Slice and Dice
---
/cast [mod:shift] Blade Flurry; Slice and Dice
---
Just a simple quality of life macro, saves you keybinds and bar slots by combining your two attack speed spells on the same key with a shift modifier on Blade Flurry. I use a weak aura that tells me when Blade Flurry is on cooldown/how long until it’s back up/how long the duration is.
---
**One Button Vanish/Stealth**
---
showtooltip Vanish
---
showicon Vanish
---
/cast [combat] Vanish; Stealth
---
Will cast Vanish if I’m combat, stealth if not. Be careful to make sure you are out of combat as to not waste Vanish!
---
And last but not least -
---
**Sinister Strike, Target Grab, Start Auto Attack, Riposte EZ Mode, and Ranged Weapon Because Why The Hell Not?**
---
showtooltip Sinister Strike
---
/cleartarget [dead][help]
---
/startattack
---
/cast Riposte
---
/cast Sinister Strike
---
/cast [mod:shift] Shoot Gun
---
I’m all about saving keybinds when I can. This macro combines 3 (technically 4) into one. Pressing the keybind will first select the nearest target to you as well as begin your auto attacks - removing the need to right click almost entirely. Keep spamming while in range and you will begin using Sinister Strike. If you put points into Riposte, when you parry (given that you have enough energy) you will instantly cast it during your spam. If you have enough energy for both Riposte AND Sinister Strike you will cast both almost simultaneously! I added the ranged weapon script recently to work with the auto targeting.
---
Hope some of you guys find these useful!
---
Casual mention of the guzzler
---
Yeah no, it's pretty fucking chill here. We really don't have much drama **at all** compared to other Discord/Reddit Admin's I've talked to. I'm loving it.

Im not 100% sure on this but to my understanding Rogues only need 4% hit from gear to be hitcapped since they have 5% from talents.
---
*happy Yiga noises*

I'd definitely get it if you can, you'll be crushing mobs for fun and players. Don't bother getting Bonebiter, it's not that much of an upgrade tbh. 
---
Next upgrade axe wise is definitely executioners cleaver which you can buy off the AH, I'd recommend getting fiery on your WW axe too for some extra damage and it proccs like crazy too.
---
Would never join a guild like that for any reason.

W o o f
---
I was counting abilities as attacks. 
---
What part is not accurate?
---
Yeah nearly took me 30 runs, I can’t see brd anymore
---
I hate it. I believe that the game is about grinding for your loot. Sometimes it takes 1 run, sometime 100, but that’s the entire point of the game.
---
People who reserve loot are in my opinion, entitled. They seem to think that they’ve earned the right to the loot when it drops despite needing the group to get there as well. People go off about economics and supply and demand, but it’s still scummy in my eyes. Less so when you make your own group and advertise, but super scummy to whisper a group of 4 looking for 1 more knowing full well you’re already getting all the tank/healing gear, and won’t even compete with others on rolls.
---
I’ve run a lot of dungeons, even got my UBRS key early as a dps, and anyone who’s whispered me trying to reserve an item to join my group gets lol’d at and ignored.
---
You wanna reserve and item, make a group and try and fill it, don’t go whispering other people to try and take loot from someone else. I’ve noticed it’s usually tanks who want dps loot reserved. I have zero issues with tanks rolling on dps gear, because that’s just the way the game works when there’s so few tanks needed for raiding but so many for dungeons, but to expect a reserved item because you’re tanking is scummy as hell.
---
I ran 80 ish UBRS runs the last few weeks in an attempt to get Dal rends mainhand, and lost the roll to 3 tanks and a hunter the 4 times it dropped, and I still never considered reserving them, because while I was supplying the ubrs key and making the group, I needed everyone else to complete it as well. Eventually I caved and bought Krol blade instead, because dropping 350g on a sword felt less scummy than putting my name in lfg chat next to “reserved”.

How can I make something they didn't even ask for? As I said in the last paragraph if you want something ask, I'll make it but if you don't ask for a port how am I suppose to know to port you?
---
naw. people leveled fine when honor was out before, they'll level fine now. tho, world PVP and ganking is gonna be even more prevalent and dickwadish, even moreos then now since there's actually a "reason" to do it, now, aside from being an ass.
---
Not sure why you can't level still

Had a guildie who made almost 200 runs for it

There's a selfish statement. Waters in the group will make the dungeon move faster. It is like the priest refusing to buff people "You are not entitled to my buffs". And what's more, many buffs have reagents. Waters are free.

Do your part for the dungeon and give out waters, because this is part of your class utility.

I think the mmorpg aspects began to be gutted with cata.  I can't say i have the answer, but i think classic will only keep earing them and decent amount of money until naxx comes around again.  I am all for bc and wrath after(bc is still my fav xpac) but if they wanted to continue after that, I would like to see a version of the game that doesnt futher strip out the rpg mechanica.

---
&gt; It's really fast, which means that your abilities won't generate as much threat as they should, completely countering any benefit you would get from the higher AA dps.
---
Any prot warr worth their salt is macroing HS and Sunder together, for extra threat gen and rage dumping.  You get so much rage that you can't spend it fast enough, so you want a faster weapon for more HS's.
---
The absolute worst case scenario is you having to level in instances
---
Now THIS is podracing!
---
It’s just morons exaggerating. If you get ganked by an enemy, call for help and no doubt he will get ganked too. It will be fine.
---
its a pvp server. this is part of the fun. stop crying.
---
ret pally is just awful.
---
****g
---
Grappling hook into the hole.
---
Sure. 20g. Whether you choose to tank my dungeon for me after the fee is just gravy.
---
I wish Blizzard would permaban anyone doing this stupid mafia shit.  Its so scummy.
---
I, as a Mage feel like this post may have just been created to farm bad karma :/ 
---
Before even getting to a dungeon I’d normally make 5-8 Stacks each of food and water - it’s in my interest the healer and other casters regen as quickly as possible so the run goes quicker. I’ll happily throw up a portal at the end regardless of anyone asking because the difference between that and teleporting is like 10s :/ 
---
What you’re saying is you’ve never asked a paladin for wisdom, or a Druid for innovate, or a warlock for water bre......you get my point. 
---
Each class in classic has an identity - you’re not unique by trying to break the mould - as a mage you do certain things other classes could only dream of and son you best embrace it or you’re gonna have a bad time m’kay!
---
Since you didn't get a real answer from the other guy. 
---
I use https://sixtyupgrades.com/ for my personal BIS list for my hunter. You can do custom stat weights and filter based on that, as well as phases etc. 
---
You just have to do your own math to see what would be BIS for the spec you want. For me it's the lack of pvp focus in normal BIS lists.
---
Alright, if it sounds that optional even for ubrs I'll just go full arms, why cripple myself if it doesn't help.
---
It's all down to being obsessed with getting top DPS, i I think, if that's the case these people should just roll fire mages sub 60 and have done with it
---
Try playing horde for a bit and you'll see alliance players are just as bad
---
Life tap and drain life make it easier yeah.
---
Yep.
---
&gt; Bonus tip for when trying to find a tank: If you have a higher level healer for a dungeon group, and you're looking for a tank, have your healer advertise for the tank spot in LFG - they're more likely to get a response. If I'm looking for a tank for UD strat as a 56 hunter, no tank in their right mind will respond to me. However, if a level 60 priest is asking for a tank, that's a whole different story.
---
I'm just gonna leave it at that. 
---
Also you can keep your irony to yourself. I'm not any bit better than you because I'm 60, I certainly wasn't the fastest leveler myself. I just want to use my play time as efficient as I can, and that means I look for groups with players of my level.
---
&gt;warlock
---
&gt;excellent aids class
---
Am I reading this wrong?
---
As I explained in another group post no. No one is entitled to your abilities. But if you want to be in a group you have to fulfill a roll. For the priest, it is healing. So to be apart of the team you use your abilities because doing so is mutually beneficial ie(clearing the dungeon and getting loot). Futhermore if you didn't you would prob be kicked from the group. Same for me. My role is dps not porting people after the dung.  
---
A more accurate analogy to what I wrote would be me running by ur priest and not saying a word. Then pming you calling you a dick because u were supposed to buff me even tho I didn't say anything and we aren't in a group.  
---
So to reiterate the main point of this post is that 1: if you want something ask me for it
---
2: If i say nah don't want to don't pm random shit later about it
---
I don't know about impossible however once honor is put in there will be way more world PvP. So while yes you will be getting ganked more there will also be more people willing to run over and help to get honor themselves. You would only really be in a pickle if you are on the wrong side of a faction dominated server.
---
Extra threat gen is built into HS.  Prot warrs eventually reach a point where they can't spend rage fast enough before capping out, so a faster weapon is better, coupled with a HS/Sunder macro (or Cleave/Sunder as needed) that they spam to help use more of it and generate extra threat.
---
Take a screenshot ffs.
---
Im always curious what makes people do that. :D For me to kill underleveled player is Like going to fight a kids in kindergarden. Serious question, why?
---
Even if its an item you dont need?
---
Them going out and publicly stating certain reservations should show some level of honesty, and that they are less likely to ninja something
---
Because phase 2 is when the honor grind comes and since it’s ranked based on faction players like me that will be 48+ will become the mobs to grind for that honor.
---
I actually like every mount in the game, except Gnome mounts and Raptors. I hate how those two move. 
---
Currently 54 on my Orc and just started buying runecloth for an undead horse. It's gonna be expensive, but worth it.
---
That’s the problem blizzard doesn’t give us the tools to know if we are on a bad server.
---
Yeah this is my assumption as well. Yet all the Best in slot lists (wowhead, icyveins) give way more +hit than that at the expense of other stats.
---
I switched to Paladin from Warlock and IMO Warlock is much easier to level.
---
I was going to use these talents:

You sure they weren’t memeing?
---
The druid is playing whatever he enjoys so he can show reddit he is 3rd in DPS with pride on this one specific fight in a few months.
---
 Boy is he viable, he’ll show us all.
---
I spent about 30 hours total doing arena, anger, golem runs to get savage / hoj sacage took me about 15 hours him took me the last 15. Only seen 2 drop lost first to a resto shaman won 2nd against 2 others in party.
---
Ya, I agree wholeheartedly with this. Hence why I said I usually make things for people espcially when there in my group and I do not think there is anything in my post that suggests anything counter to your point. 
---
But the main point would be if a priest didn't buff me in a group I wouldn't pm the priest and call him names and then proceed to block him. I would just continue on with the dungeon or make a decision and leave.
---
I see the logic behind believing that culling Stratholme was necessary, but I honestly feel like it would have been a better and more humane idea to quarantine the city while Dalaran worked on a cure. It may or may not have worked out, but it would have been the right thing to do. Lots of people in Stratholme probably had not eaten the diseased grain yet.
---
Arthas refused to consider it. He jumped immediately to the easiest answer, despite it being the most brutal. And he tunnel-visioned on it, considering anybody who didn't back him up on it as a traitor. If we put ourselves in the shoes of Uther or Jaina, would most of us *actually* be okay with going into the city and killing all this townsfolk before they even turn? It's completely unreasonable to be angry at somebody for not participating in the Culling, and none of this would have happened if Hearthglen hadn't pushed Arthas to the edge.

I’ve had what felt like lesser energy ticks after my ss gets dodged/parried/missed etc, but never less than 20 a tick.
---
I read about some strange energy behaviour in the beta but I assume most of that was fixed, and nothing at all about 19 energy a tick.
---
Thanks! Looks had a big part in me getting it

The guy named "Ayy" saying "lmao" is probably better post-material than this guy's ad.
---
I think i know what you mean, but I've also been getting ticks for 21 energy. I think it is either a visual display bug. Or possibly a rounding error (e.g. Your attack gets dodged so they refund you some energy and it is a decimal amount rounded to be displayed as full).
---
Typical hordies
---
Yeah what I have allways done throughout wow is to have atlas make 1 of each race/gender that I am considering and checking tier sets/raid gear that is realistic that I would get (That means dont try it with thunderfury etc and base your selection on that)
---
ikr \^\^ such an easy gold :P
---
Why do people reach into the past? This dudes screwed. 15 years ago people didn't understand the game. We do know and people who arnt max level are fucked because 60s are farming them now

Wow. DM:W Has one of the best pre-raid tank weapons you can get. For warrior and druid ( Druid if you don't have warden staff, unable to do tribute run for some reason, or just want more threat stats from tome of knowledge ) 
---
Which is timeworn Made. 120 armor, str and stanima on it. Pretty spiffy.

---
If they want more tank nothing stopped them to roll one.
---
Dps players complaining that no one want to tank are hilarious
---
I got the cloak off last boss in DMEast on Tuesday.  I can live without the Baron cloak for now.  Shoulders though...why yes another piece of gear I don't have to upgrade for a couple phases would be nice.
---
Im level 42 and never used rupture so far. You are saying to use it immediately after your opener? I feel the damage is average, mobs die before the dot lasts its whole duration, and it will break gouge and blind.
---
Do people farm bad karma? Is that thing? 
---
But ya, I ask people for other things all the time. Especially buffs because as I have said in another post they are usually mutually beneficial to the group and help me get what I want faster which is loot. So following that logic I usually throw up my own buffs and hand out water to my group since it helps us clear which is good for me and u. 
---
But this is what I was trying to get at. First off, ports are not mutually beneficial. But even with that said I do not mind making them. Usually, I always port my group unless they are mean or annoying. But if I do not decide to port u don't cry about it. Especially if you don't ask and I am porting to if alone.
---
I was fortunate on the group make up when it dropped I had no competition as we had 2 mages and a lock as our Dps... although it did take me roughly 20 kills before I ever saw it
---
Inb4 sold it for 10s
---
I don’t understand why people post videos and pictures of getting on boats.  Close calls are not special. At all.
---
Sub can also take elites easily. And you have double evasion amd double blind.
---
Is male gnome really better tho?
---
Just Rogue harder.
---
And I was worried none would get it 😂
---
The mp5 and the other recipe fro ad quartemaster are added with naxx
---
BiS bank alt city.
---
Your racials and the mobs your farming mostly also come into play. Spirit can be helpful, but for example as an undead rogue, humanoids give you pickpocket, cloth (bandages), and the option to canabalize on same cooldown as bladeflurry. So focusing humanoids in this case largely negates any spirit you need.
---
Also important to note- spirit regen only works out of combat- so it implies you already have considerable downtime between mobs- something your trying to reduce anyway
---
I saw a better one. 
---
LF2M, tank &amp; healer. Live strat. First orb reserved.
---
Phase 5
---
Filthy living peasant.
---
The amount of hit that goes over the yellow cap still benefits white attacks which is a huge part of Rogue's damage. You don't have to go nuts with stacking hit but going a bit over the 9% is a good idea.
---
Wouldn't surprise me if it was that one guy, name has five letters.
---
According to APES on our server fury tanking is only worth it over shield bash if you are fully world buffed
---
The WoWhead BiS list doesn't know what build you are going to run.....    
---
If you have over hit-cap then maybe pick some of the optional items?    
---
I mean people say they wanted classic but follow "BiS" lists and "optimal talent builds" blindly which is a big part of why retail became boring and generic.
---
Probably bartender
---
That said when levelling just focus stamina, especially as a combat rogue. Parry scales with wep damage and ss does flat bonus damage on top of weapon damage. Just make sure to keep your weapons up to date as you level, and equip any items you can in Stamina, Agi, Strength, Spirit order
---
You care to correct him, you statistics genius?
---
Happened to me constantly on druid as well. Energy ticks randomly giving 19/21 energy, quite annoying.
---
Lol, what. I don't even know what people are doing after the dung or even where they are going. How would it be common sense to just randomly make a portal? Which one should I make if its such common sense the If one? The SW one? or do i just make both and pray for the best? 
---
Wouldnt it just be more common sense to just say hey mage can u make an if portal and I port u?
---
I have researched this alot and cant find a significant answer. However , the 9% hit cap is for yellow damage only (sinister strike dmg etc) , the hit cap for white damage (melee),  which is the majority of a rogues damage , is significantly higher than 9%. So there is some benefit for having even higher hit % , however , I personally think after hitting a certain %; you are better off going for agi/attack power / crit etc ... 
---
BiS lists work on individual items and don't really take into acc all the items as a set.
---
I got my gold (also as a warrior) for my level 40 mount from fishing floatin wreckages in STV.
---
STV and it’s not even close imo
---
What a fucking legend
---
That was bigtime money in '06.
---
Level 60 and I have the same +shadow damage pants from SM GY. Haven’t been able to play much recently.
---
Wth, raptors are amazing!
---
P.S. or you could've farmed Strat UD for like 1000 times and maaaybe you'll get your rivendare deathcharger XD
---
It is
---
Does that only drop in dusty tomes?
---
Got it at 107. Keep grinding mate!
---
Where should I level as a Horde Priest at level 50? Just cleared up Tanaris, Feralas and Hinterlands (last two recommended in these threads - thanks!) 
---
Also, what dungeons should I hit up now? Maraudon and Sunken Temple?
---
9% is the soft cap. IIRC, 24% is the hard cap.
---
That is truly Evil. I love it.
---
Nope
---
stop wiping
---
Groups don't always want ports, sometime they hearth or walk out. As a mage I ask at the end though
---
i think druids would work better since the hots can heal the tank immediately after he gets smacked
---
did MC for the first time last week with 2 druids and 8 paladins. on baron geddon we wiped 5 times, partly because me and one of the other healers couldn't keep the fully fire resist geared tank alive, despite spamhealing him. i think a druid might have worked better there.
---
Those ghost packs cause me a great deal of stress tanking there, otherwise West is a pretty fun dung.
---
Just gonna day this... moving out of Barrens chat has negatively impacted my experience as a first time WoW player. Why is every area not this way!?
---
I get the 21 ticks very frequently ([example](https://streamable.com/gjh7f)).  Never once seen a 19 tick, though.
---
Just buy a blackstone ring run and get a innervating band from ah both better
---
Dying and crying on Reddit doesn't seem very enjoyable.
---
So farm in instances. Crisis averted.
---
Someone should definitely get some evidence and report it in game or on the official forums then. I personally haven’t noticed it ever happening to me, but I can definitely see why it would cause issues.
---
Brave post.
---
that 50 stamina would be a bigger net gain then 50 agility.
---
50 stamina is just 500 health, whereas 50 agility is... however much stats it gives. i don't know the exact numbers.
---
more stamina is great if you're dying, but... if you're killing the mob faster, and not in danger of dying, you don't need the extra stamina. it's essentially "wasted" stats. 
---
sure, the stamina would help you if you're fighting more then one mob, but, rogues have so many tools to avoid that, it should never happen, or almost never.
---
its very hard to get full run now also because the level range in the dungeon is absurd, starting at like 47 and ending at 58, people around level 50 are gonna struggle with the later parts of the dungeon, people closing in on 60 and looking for their pre-bis items arent interested in spending half the time with mobs that barely give XP let alone interesting loot since the mid part has very few stand out items you usually get in the first few runs anyway.
---
I can understand not using it in some cases for aggro but we were in desperate need of aoe lol we had a rogue/lock/warrior as our dps and kept looking at him as I died rain of firing like... “is he ever going to fucking WW?!?”
---
Hey there - sadly not but I am working on a website. You can check my reddit profile here I posted them last week. I just started to do these so there isn't much content yet and to be honest I didn't think that people like them that much - I honestly just wanted to get some feedback.     
---
I created a \[twitter\]( [https://twitter.com/MOFC20](https://twitter.com/MOFC20) ) account and for now that's possibly the best way to keep in touch. I am planning to release one comic per week here on reddit and daily stuff on the twitter account (=  
---
And it makes me really happy that you enjoyed it!
---
Why did you bring your pet when looking for Broken Tooth? Stable full?
---
Haha, no.  Horde was decidedly the underpopulated faction in Vanilla.
---
People playing dedicated DPS classes (rogue, mage, warlock, hunter) make that choice when they select those classes. They have no ability to tank/heal, even if they want to.  If you play a class that CAN fill multiple roles, it's not an outrageous request for you to do it. A warrior refusing to tank is just a shitty rogue until they get good gear, and if they have good gear they can honestly just "tank" 5 mans with raw damage output. 
---
It's the same issue with shadow priests refusing to heal. Literally every single class can spec to "do damage". The problem is that the ones that have the ability to tank/heal refusing to do it. It's not like they're wanting the arms warrior to tank molten core or the spriest to be a dedicated tank healer for onyxia, it's 5 man dungeons. If you aren't in level 30 quest greens you can do it with little effort even if you aren't the right spec.

---
Griefing. Some people are just wasted dna.
---
&gt;A healer's priority is the tank and themselves and then the rest of the group. 
---
To add to this, RANGED dps are an even lower priority than melee dps. RDPS generally don't take as much damage by just existing as melee, and all rdps have either self heals or methods to escape combat, drop aggro, etc.
---
Healing priority should usually be:
---
Tanks &gt;&gt; Healers &gt;&gt; MDPS &gt;&gt; RDPS except Mages &gt;&gt; Hunters' pets &gt;&gt; Tanks for a second round &gt;&gt; Wanding the boss just for shits and giggles &gt;&gt; Mages, maybe. 
---
Because fuck Mages. Huntards of Classic.
---
Holy shit I remember this video

Facts. If you do not ask me in the first 20-30 seconds after final boss or come stand next to me and jump up and down, I assume you guys are hearthing and I port out and go on my merry way.

wrong
---
About 20 runs.  Its something I will be running all day tuesday-thursday tanking it.  And NO I am not going to reserve it.  I don't roll that way as a tank.
---
almost finished up getting the last of my pre-bis set on my rogue (with a few raid pieces also)
---
any suggestions as to what to do next? farm for epic mount?
---
&gt;I'VE SPOKE ENGLISH
---
SOUNDS LIKE YOU NEED MORE CLASSES STILL
---
Waow poor guy has to use his class spells... So sad :(
---
Didn’t we agree to stop with the shitty humblebrag posts?
---
This and the vanish lottery. 5/6 of my vanish failed the other day in BRD. It's really annoying never knowing if you'll live or die because of a stupid bug.
---
Because if they did people would be using that information to make all manner of stupid decisions 🙄
---
You can't really run a mafia with only one faction. When I was farming my devilsaur, it wasn't really a challenge pvpwise, but I hit 60 ahead of the curve
---
just taking a bite from his burger between sentences.
---
Against it. Look I understand the desire to reserve gear.  But you are just spending 1 hour forming a group instead of 15 minutes.  By the time you are done you could have already done 1 run and maybe have gotten lucky instead of 2 hours to do that same run finding the group forming it and finishing it.  While the other person is probably just finishing his second run.
---
&gt;we all want new content but NO CHANGES.
---
You want NO CHANGES, but you want new content like brand new BGs? I think you are confused
---
Any warrior worth their spot in a dungeon or raid can tank when they need to. If they choose to sit in LFG for an extra 20-30’minutes, that’s all good. Increases demand for real warriors, ill just tank as fury with a bunch of cloth wearers, more loot for me!
---
What exactly gives rep? I can’t find anything?
---
Mr fancy over here can afford flights.
---
I WILL!  ^thanks
---
My rule of thumb is if someone demands it in the group I just ignore it unless its something I want then I just say so.  Then again I tank so generally I can't just tell them to fuck off and find another group quickly.  If you dps however it isn't quite that simple obviously.
---
I get the error on motw.
---
I'm in the largest Horde guild on Faerlina. We currently have six full raid teams, of 60s, and a stocked bench. 
---
Even we have to pug sometimes for dungeons, especially lower level dungeons.
---
I don’t know, I got forced to put on clothes in Stormwind.
---
when I see a female nightelf hunter I automatically assume it's a male 40 year old virgin
---
Which is fine.  That instance kind sucks to tank in general with how long it is.  But he gets to spend the extra hour trying to form it.
---
Almost like expecting to be invited as a DPS warrior to compete with the tank for gear (unless the tank is a druid)..
---
I plan to tank end game, but i am lvl 54 atm. should i switch to deep port instead of arms now that im tanking dungeons like ubrs/etc?
---
How are they bugged? They worked just fine for me a few weeks back.
---
Combine that with no layers and much higher overall server populations and it's going to be nasty.
---
^ this.
---
i have no issues if it's clearly stated what's being reserved. if we go through the dungeon, change to ML and then take the item without any previous discussion, that's when it gets ick.
---
Such a cool mount. Too bad Iam a orc warlock which just look stupid on warlock mounts so I bought the regular epic mount. Worth it to have orc shoulders though.
---
That was awesome, Had a good laugh! Thanks!
---
My reply when I want to form a  group for that instance would be.  LFM LIVE STRAT FIRST ORB NOT RESERVED!
---
It's not being greedy. A BoE item worth that much is literally just gold at that point. Everyone in the group worked to get it, it is JUST as useful to any member in that group, tank or not. The priest can sell it, buy gear of EQUAL value to him and give him the same benefit the tank would get. The item is readily available to be bought at any time on the AH. Not to mention half the time something that valuable drops, the person who "needs" it ends up posting it on the AH an hour later. My main is currently a tank and I wouldn't expect the whole group to pass something that valuable to me I can buy at any time by farming gold. In fact I think expecting that is the definition of greed when that item can be used to progress each person in the group equally by taking one extra step and turning it into gold. The bottom line people always ignore in this situation, is that item holds the same exact value to any class if it can be sold, and in turn that gold spent to progress their own char, no matter what class.
---
Sounds like you are conflating two entirely different issues and acting like they are the same. The problem isn't a Fury Warrior not wanting to tank, that's not an issue at all, and is what I am trying to point out. When you get a Bear tank or a feral DPS in your group and can't find a healer, do you bitch at the Druid for not having a full set of heal gear and healing? That's pretty cringey if you do, but it wouldn't make you a hypocrite at least.
---
You are saying that someone complaining about not being able to find a tank when they are reserving tank gear is an asshole, and I completely agree, but that's because they are trying to make someone else work for free for them and has nothing to do with them not wanting to tank.
---
Was wondering how long it would be before these posts would pop up whilst trying to get Broken Tooth.
---
Hey bro, don't come to Un'Goro crater tomorrow
---
This is exactly how I leveled all of BC. It'll be fine.
---
Hit 60 on my rogue last week, trying to gear up pre-bis has been a nightmare even though we are like 50+ people that have hit 60 in my guild.  
---
Started leveling a druid yesterday just because it takes up to 2 hours just to find a group for one single dungeon run...
---
what kind of ban is it? couple of hours/days ?
---
While leveling, making your own gear is awesome. It’s also super good when you first max because you can make the Devilsaur set which is pre raid BIS for all physical dps.
---
It gets a rep for being “Bad” when the servers mature because they don’t really make anything that is great after the fact, and nothing that is Bind on Pickup. 
---
I wouldn’t stress it though. Maybe dropping it later if you get serious into PvP, but even then it isn’t 100 percent required.
---
You don’t have to use an exact term, just report them for cheating and say they’re sitting on top of a building attacking players. They’ll know.
---
Wf doesnt proc from the whirlwind, but noticed almost after each ww proc i got a WF proc ^^
---
Youre the weak willed crybaby that wants to real world trade.
---
Great I’ll get that later looks good
---
No
---
Because you can like and play both games.
---
If guilds aren't getting alot of tanks geared as content releases later on, I'd be surprised. They're gonna be shocked when they hit 4 horsemen in Naxx and realize they need, like, 8 tanks in t3 just to clear it.
---
It even hurts pointing out the onyxia head neck :p
---
I want to play a Warrior tank but i also want to raid.
---
Tank life, people fight over you for 5 mans but you won't find a raid spot.
---
Is he alliance? I missed that
---
Take my money
---
Same.  I lost to a hunter who got the dal rend.  I was like ok congrats.  There will be other chances.  And a couple days later I am sporting a vis'kag.  People who reserve gear only hurt themselves in the end.
---
Also I doubt it's a coincidence that the only players I've seen more than once in groups were the nice/decent players.
---
The people that can't behave themselves almost seem to disappear. I've tried to find a few of them to add a character note about their poor behaviour.
---
People really need to start replying to these angry people with "ok" it really riles them up and requires the least effort on your part :)
---
Which is never, because you fly to Thalanaar anyway
---
I'm gonna be honest, Ziqo didn't put up the best showing, given his abilities, well-earned reputation, and excellent gear. 
---
I guess everyone has off-days. 
---
Not that i could do any better. Hell, I'm still not even 60. But i think we all expected a better showing from him.
---
Oh shit maybe not, I always forget that is only available to alliance. Whoops 😅
---
How's the f150? Making up for being short?
---
It’s refreshing to see people who aren’t suffering the delusion that their faction is somehow more honourable haha. Zug zug bro.
---
As a tank.  My only rule is I can roll on 1 piece of DPS gear.  I don't demand that piece.  I just want the chance to roll on it.  Demanding it to me is taking it too far. I mean why don't you form your own group then.
---
excatly, shaman/paladin weapon :)
---
If you aren't the leader it's also quite likely you can tell the other players you won't group with them if they were to get invited and they will run with it.
---
I've been helping a warrior buddy of mine with arena/angerforge runs. He's on around #140 without seeing it drop once. Haven't seen savage gladiator chain either!
---
What's hilarious is the so called \*casual\* or \*semi-hardcore\* guilds that try to act like a hardcore guild end up bleeding players because of shit like this and then eventually they end up pugging half their raids because players leave due to it not being the guild that was advertised.
---
That guild will be dead in 3 months tops.
---
SOLD
---
Keep arms until 60 or raiding imo
---
I can‘t wait to get around to max level and finally tank brd, strath and co. So hyped for it..damn still 42 levels to go 🙈
---
I have combo points setup for weakauras. I can export it for you if needed
---
It's even worse, haven't played for a while so I may be wrong, but you just re-run some raid over and over until you get lucky with w/e drop you're looking for, and since it binds to you once you pick it up it's not even tradable.
---
Meanwhile on BDO I can just make money and buy it from the market.
---
What is so wrong with selling services? That's like saying I won't tip or pay an enchanter or crafter. Tanks are in demand, and there are instances they just don't need to run. Would you rather them not run that instance at all because they need nothing from it, or give you the option to tank it for gold?
---
As for reserve groups, why wouldn't I make one if I know its going to get me my item faster? It's so easy to do, especially being a tank lol. Why would i spend 50 runs gunning for HoJ, when I can get it in a 1/3 of that time reserving. Sorry I like to be efficient with how I play and farm the hard to get gear I guess.
---
Lvl an alt, epic mount farm, do raids etc. if you’re all BiS just have fun.
---
ElvUI has this built in.
---
I'm right. My guild is going to literally raid 48+ zones all day lol
---
Was obviously not actively looking for it but happened to stumble upon it?
---
Mara and ST are good. Felwood, ungoro are also good.
---
That is hilarious, couldn’t think of a worse way to bind keys than that! Bravo sir!
---
I actually have a Ford ranger. I'm 6 foot and dont like big trucks lol.
---
Fangs?
---
This is one of the most important lessons you must learn as a healer. There’s absolutely no need to keep everyone topped off all the time.
---
I was defo ina  few guilds like this to the point where I ended up thinking it was normal that casual guilds wiped offline members after a few days. Only one had this weird formal request for time off shit though.
---
what does "understanding the game" have to do with farming honor? people knew what to do back then and they still do now. the game won't be "impossible" to level. even with the tryhard hardcores playing private servers and being massive douchenozzles, it was still easily possible to level once honor came out.
---
You need 8 tanks with either the four piece set, or a trinket or something for the Feral tanks. To be honest though, most guilds will probably have all their DPS Warriors with a tanking set and a feral tank or two by then. Eventually tank gear is going to be handed to offset, especially with Ony and MC being easy to split run.
---
this blond boy here on the picture
---
It's very easy to mess up some of the pulls and the elemental and ghost packs are made considerably harder by the fact most people are unwilling to stun on interrupt them. Had a group where they did the other day and I could just leave a renew on the tank and start wanding.
---
Also people should be spreading out for the elementals chain lightning but you get a mixture of people not wanting to and the pulls involving clumping around to LOS around a pillar/corner.
---
definitely the paladin
---
Arms warrior beats HoR Cdew, not so weak I'd say.
---
That’s it, I’m kinkshaming!
---
That can be so frustrating sometimes. Especially as a DPS since we're a dime a dozen and, depending on the group, could do without one.
---
Really pisses me off is if it is on the way. High inquisitioner from BRD is a standout one for me. Just wanted the shoulders off the boss and is literally 3-4 mob pulls of the lowest threat, and level, stuff in the instance but people won't do it. At worst it would be maybe 5 minutes added. (But ohh well. Ended up getting something better recently.)
---
In before the lawsuit for copyright infringement.

It really isn't that much effort. Just two clicks. Profile&gt;submitted posts

You need to understand that if you haven't hit 6p your fucked and comparing things to 15 years ago is retarded. Servers are bigger. You will be able to quest but getting killed every 2 minutes is going to destroy you.

Yes.

&gt; Fury also dominate other warriors.

lol no. hamstring and jousting destorys dw warrs.
---
If you actually knew anything about the rank 1 players you'd know they played from vanilla for the most part so they know their classes in and out from the earliest time possible so it being retail means nothing it just so happens that PVP tournaments only got into proper full swing around cata-mop but that doesnt mean there wasn't rank 1 players before that. 
---
If your gonna try and shit on genuinely good players try to come up with a better reason than just \*guh retail kids\* cause that shit doesnt wash for 99% of rank 1 players.

As a warrior you dont Connect for too long. So is you are able to hit your enemy for 1sec, u want to get those Big numbers in ;D

Lvled my rogue as mainly sub once i could get hemo, far superior if you are questing on a pvp server
---
And that's smart. Everyone is acting like they are entitled for DPS warriors to tank for them though, which they aren't, and that is the problem. If the Fury Warrior wants to spend longer LFG, there's nothing wrong with that, but people are actually getting mad at them for not being willing to tank.
---
People are trying to conflate people being assholes with people not wanting to play a different spec. They might have some overlap, but they are two entirely different things.
---
Raw.

This is the same method some gnome used back in vanilla to get exalted with SW. 
---
I'm trying to find the video, but I don't remember the title. It was with some girl commentating over it.
---
What server is this on? Bloodsail buccaneers is a server?
---
Here are some of my Warrior macros. Make sure to also bind /startattack to most (if not all) of your damaging abilities.
---
    #showtooltip Charge
---
    /use [stance:2/3] Battle Stance; [mod:shift,@mouseover,harm,nodead][harm,nodead] Charge  
---
Casts Battle Stance if I'm not in it, otherwise casts Charge on my target or on my mouseover when I press Shift too.
---
    #showtooltip Intercept
---
    /use [stance:1/2] Berserker Stance
---
    /use [mod:shift,@mouseover,harm,nodead][harm,nodead] Intercept  
---
Intercept version of the Charge macro. Same macro format for Hamstring, Disarm, Taunt, etc. Just change the abilities and stance numbers (1 = Battle, 2 = Defensive, 3 = Berserker).
---
    #showtooltip Berserker Rage
---
    /use [stance:1/2] Berserker Stance; Berserker Rage  
---
Casts Berserker Stance if I'm not in it, otherwise casts Berserker Rage. Same macro format for Sweeping Strikes, Whirlwind, Overpower, etc.
---
    #showtooltip Intimidating Shout
---
    /use [mod:shift,@mouseover,harm,nodead][harm,nodead] Intimidating Shout  
---
Stops any casting and casts Intimidating Shout on my target or on my mouseover when I press Shift too.
---
    /use [worn:bow] Shoot Bow; [worn:crossbow] Shoot Crossbow; [worn:gun] Shoot Gun; [worn:thrown] Throw  
---
Instead of dragging a different Shoot icon to my action bar when I get a different ranged weapon, this macro should work for all ranged weapons a Warrior can wear. Haven't tested it with Thrown weapons.    
---
    #showtooltip Retaliation
---
    /use [mod:shift,stance:1/2] Berserker Stance; [mod:shift] Recklessness; [mod:ctrl,stance:1/3] Defensive Stance; [mod:ctrl] Shield Wall; [nomod,stance:2/3] Battle Stance; [nomod] Retaliation  
---
Casts Battle Stance and then Retaliation if don't press a modifier key. If I press Shift, it casts Berserker Stance and then Recklessness. If I press Ctrl, it casts Defensive Stance and then Shield Wall.
---
    #showtooltip [stance:1/2] Shield Bash; Pummel
---
    /use [worn:shield,mod:shift,@mouseover,harm,nodead][worn:shield,harm,nodead] Shield Bash; [stance:1/2] Berserker Stance; [mod:shift,@mouseover,harm,nodead][harm,nodead] Pummel  
---
I made this macro, but I haven't really tested it yet. But I think if I wear a Shield it will cast Shield Bash on my target or on my mouseover when I press Shift too. If I don't wear a Shield, it should switch to Berserker Stance and casts Pummel on my target or on my mouseover when I press Shift too.
---
Same with the auctionneer on the second floor of the house in darnassus. Who have time to climb up another floor before openning the auction house ?
---
Especially good comment since he is called Cotton\_Depot
---
sorry u died
---
Depends on prior offences and severity. Could be a day, could be a month.
---
N
---
I'll focus in the GANE when you get a life homeboy.
---
I mean if you can get core-hound tooth, then yeah. If not, then stilll no. Unless you're a nonhuman that doesn't want to shell out for handguards, I guess.
---
For me specifically, I'm not the main tank, nor am I the first or second warrior offtank, so the chances of me getting a core hound tooth over a dagger rogue are about nil. So this seems like a fine solution to me. I also don't need a super fast weapon to sink the rage I get from dungeons, unlike raids.
---
Would like to know as well
---
I still don't get it how so many people think their faction is the best. There are a-holes on both sides.
---
You have ignore list for one and kos list for the other. I just wish ignore list didn't have a limit.
---
Using one key stroke to perform multiple actions is not allowed, and so it's not possible without outside macro helpers. These macros are meant to be pressed multiple times if required.
---
Felt the same but it needs time to be learned, once you know where is what, it's good
---
So much wrong in this post it's gotta be a troll
---
I love that trinket, hitting 900+ at lvl 45
---
Are all of them like 5 uses each? That's kinda lame
---
Nice, didn't knew that.
---
This and the ticks aren't synced so if you open just before a touc you won't get extra energy. Which is a known bug as well that messes up a lot of combos
---
He made a joke about the 1'000'000 as opposed to 1,000,000 as the commas are 'high'... Went over people's heads.
---
I bought something similar for 9g. Depends on server and comparable items. Between 5-15g id say depending on demand and supply :p
---
Just heal and roll on your dps and heal gear at the same time. Shadow life is pretty easy. You could be a mage searching endlessly for groups.
---
Sounds like you try to blame your own weakness on your spec
---
I don't play warrior and never did
---
That was enough internet for today
---
Actually I think the most amusing is the run to silithus.
---
No that ability was added quite a bit later. If you google classic warlock spell list I’m sure you will find the entirety of learnable abilities.
---
Everyone should start joining the reserving shitter groups and roll "Need" on all the items whoever is reserving is rolling need on. This and the non sense elitism of min-maxing class choices in easy as fuck dungeons is ruining a big part of the end game for me.
---
What kind of druids are you playing with:)
---
My understanding is that because precision gives 5% hit, and Weapon Expertise gives +5 weapon skill, you only need 1% hit from gear because +5 weapon skill is roughly equivalent to 3% hit. So the cap is really 6% with 305 weapon skill.
---
That seems totally fair to me personally, I know many warriors don't really enjoy tanking or they want a DPS set. Raids only take 2-3 dedicated tanks so all the others are basically there for damage, and thus need a damage set. I don't even mind warriors rolling on leather shit because I know a lot of it is their pre-bis too, that's just how it is.
---
Casual guild did their first run today and it dropped for tank.. lucky bastard. I'll probably have to do it 20 times to even see it with my luck.
---
I have never, in 15 years on this game, found a guild so terrible they try and control your play time.
---
Get out and pretend it was all a dream.
---
So they should have planned before the release of DM, on the day they are rading, that a couple days later DM is releasing and therefore queue will increase? Yeah makes all the sense in the world.
---
Should probably plan around BWL release this sunday then
---
My tips:
---
You dont need down ranking before level 60.
---
Only heal the tank. Do not waste mana and threat on others. If you wipe cause of this, the fault is with DPS/Tank, not with you.
---
Make sure you focus on only using your biggest heal since if has best Health per Mana.
---
Make sure you do not over heal. Dont waste mana. It is okay to wait with healing to the point where you do not bring the tank back to 100%. Its acceptable to sit around 75%.
---
Set up a down ranked spell that is 50% as strong as your biggest heal. Use this to heal little bits of damage on those who need it. Preferably out pf combat.
---
Do not cast shields. They are not mana efficient, generate threat and avoid rage generation for your tank.
---
Dont use renew in most cases. Not necessary at all. When you do use it, make sure its when the tank has built enough threat.
---
Do not use Flash Heal. Not efficient and if you need it something is wrong.
---
Wait for the tank to build threat. Make sure DPS folk do the same.
---
Ideally you only pop your first heal after tank engaged combat, built threat, and has less than 50% hp.
---
Rule of thumb: Heals generate 0.5 threat for each health point healed. Make sure this amount is lower than the damage done to the targets to avoid aggro. You can use target of target to see tanks target hp to get an indication.
---
Peace out!
---
You could level normally which would then make dungeons easier as you do more DPS and less resists when you play together. If you can play then just level and then help him out?
---
kinky
---
I'm a warri and took a guildie along for a boost and he won it. Was sick. Only time I've ever seen it drop in 15 years and several alts running it.
---
This is the most retarded video I've ever seen.
---
Well I like tanking.  So I am pretty flexible.  But DPS seems more in demand in raids at the moment.  Which is fine to me also.  Just need the foot in the door so to speak.
---
Thank you
---
You just killed my hope.
---
You're welcome man :D
---
Exactly. Classic is casual as hell. My wife has been playing extremely casually, no real goals, no devoted time to anything. Almost level 57 and loving it.
---
Add some points in disc for the mana regen, it's useful for dps and heals. Never had to sit and drink.

Atm im in a guild of 200+ active players and ppl get kicked out after 25 days of inactivity if they don't set a note (like "away until 1 november").

Thats pretty legit to me, opinons?
---
&gt;30 second Fear immunity (!!!) and "unlimited" rage to keep slapping people even when they are behind barriers  
---
Where is the unlimited rage coming from? I hope you're not talking about the 40% chance to gain 1 rage on hit talent, because that isn't nearly enough rage to sustain bloodthirsts/whirlwinds if a barrier is up.  
---
Warriors also already have a 10 second fear break/immunity in the form of zerker rage that has literally no downsides and mortal strike is infinitely more useful against priests.  
---
&gt;And versus Hunter and Rogue losing Mortal Strike makes no difference.  
---
I don't know the rules of the tournament you're referring to, but you know that almost every class has some form of CC they can pop you with to get a bandage off right? Mortal strike greatly reduces the effectiveness of that.
---
Got I around 50 runs. I am still running for the glad chain tho, my friend is 100+ without banthok sash

If he plays well, he went back to humanoid when he saw the dps warrior pulled aggro on everything and cast heal to keep him alive.

Get engi and first aid to 225, look at the best loot you can get including from quests that start at 19 or lower, get arena grand master, profit?

why would you gimp your damage output when there is cooking, first aid, and troll's blood pots in the game?

Is feral instinct needed to tank dungeons as a leveling Druid?

just get 5 nightslayer items and get +10 energy
---
You play the same game as me. And tell me to get a life
---
Are you retarded?
---
👀
---
It shows that they feel more entitled than others on certain rewards, it doesnt show any honesty. If I was in charge I'd ban these idiots for trying to to reserve anything.
---
So I'm currently only level 41 and might be 43 or something near the end Hallow's End (not much time to play). Are there any 50+ level mobs that I could grind for the bags that are a bit squishy and easy to kill?

Oh là là, did the rouge eat une baguette?

---
Once you start getting into 5x - 60 dungeons, you should never settle for a dps-healer or try to be one.
---
The mouse bindings are pretty standard, those others are fucking mental
---
You wont be able to solo ZF graves because the mana required to do it is more than you'll be able to get at level 53 (most likely). On top of that, not having an epic mount makes it much harder to actually get up to the graves.
---
That's what people did during this period back in the day. It only lasted for two weeks and BGs came out and it was garbanzo honor by comparison and everybody immediately quit. #1's farmed about 40-50,000 honor during this period and that was that. Here's the list of winners on NA servers:

It wasn't that big of a deal. It won't be again this time as long as it doesn't last for months.
---
Define "time wasted". If I enjoy it. Then how can it be time wasted?

Yeah because it seems like this game is your entire life dawg. Remember to take everything in moderation, even World of Warcraft

Your assertion that it isn't the best for min/maxers is strange. If DPS is the same but with different speeds, then a slower speed would benefit from frenzy the most if you translate the speed increase to a specific amount of time. 
---
Did you mean its better to have a fast attack speed just for pvp?
---
Ah okay, what other options do I have? I’ve heard people saying SM is good for gold but which part?
---
*plays on PvE server*
---
Ha! Nobody can hurt me now!
---
*tries to quest in STV but cant due to the excessive numbers of gnomes and dwarves tagging everything and you can do nothing about it*
---
Gives nearly 6 gold at lvl 60. Plus a trinket that vendors for a gold, so that’s 7 gold in total.
---
What I think they were trying to say is that you shouldnt waste high level heals on the dps unless they're actually about to die. There's no need for them to be full health unless they're currently holding aggro. They should eat and drink between pulls just like the healer.
---
Pulling from the past doesn't work. Things have changed. Guilds are forming raid teams for 48+ areas. It's hilarious how your reachinf back at years ago with people who didn't know what they were doing and comparing it to people who now know what they are doing...lol. just like how people thought rag couldn't be killed first week. Your in for a long time of ganking unless you are on a low pop server

I'm a gnome rogue and I wholeheartedly agree.

I've got engineering too 125.

Should I start leveling leatherwork so I can craft devilsuar leggings etc or just purchase them?

Maybe stupid question? But why do I always have -5 spirit on my stats? Undead Warlock.

Where's MY FUCKING KEY RING
---
I couldn't really say on that, you could nickel and dime some money by selling portals/food. You could also work on your professions. I don't know what it's like on your server, but on mine wool cloth actually sells very well and is incredibly easy to get from SFK (as well as a few choice twink BOEs that could sell well).
---
I was just questing in Darkshore on my Night Elf (obviously female) Hunter, my owl pet has been helping me to cruise through the quests. That is... until I had to enter... the ship wrecks...
---
These damnable ship wrecks destroyed the pathing on my pet, I died maybe six times to individual murlocs because good-ol-reliable had gotten either lost, stuck or enticed into joining Thorin Oakenshield's quest to defeat Smaug - so he was going on a long, unexpected journey. 
---
Is there any way I can handle my pet better in these wrecks if I come across such things again in the future?
---
It looks a lot more like a bug with their spell queuing shit than a mechanic imo.
---
Dude. Screenshot..
---
Also , roof camping 👍🏾
---
How did it go?
---
what else would i roll on?
---
This is such a good reply, thank you for this!
---
Yesterday was my first time in classic making a group at level 60 (because I'm trying the life of a fury warrior instead of tanking and I feel it's super awkward to say "LF tank for X dungeon" in lfg channel as a warrior lol), and my jaw litterally dropped seeing the whispers from dps saying "I'll only come if you reserve X for me".  On my server, though, in general it seems to be fury warriors and rogues reserving items.
---
I felt like a scumbag yesterday reserving those two gems from LBRS. It's the first time I've ever tried reserving anything, and it's definitely my last. It just felt wrong, but I've come to a point where: a) I've lost the gems so many times already, and b) It's hard for me to find an UBRS group without the key, that I eventually took matters into my own hands and put on tank gear + reserved the gems.
---
I just demand 50g per reserved item if i join a group
---
Hey man how do you zoom out so far? My camera doesn't zoom out that far...
---
Again, what is your point? *What is your point?* You think people weren't forming raids for this back in the day? That there weren't pvp guilds? They literally gave away new graphics cards for most ganks.
---
\+ 1 for CJ
---
Tried it in a group and we all had the debuff it was super obnoxious but we were all in on it and had a laugh when we wiped on the ramp near the dog boss. Actually completed it in a guild group by porting everyone out and turning in
---
That is because of pvp. Healing is extremly strong in pvp which tend to make hybrids great in 1vs1. Tanking abilities on the other hand is useless against other players.
---
Yeah I got kicked out of my guild for taking a 1½ week break. I'm now back on break because fuck it.
---
I got the feeling you killed the rest of them to take the picture on the throne when I looked at it first!
---
And yeah being able to chat while playing is awesome! Who hasn’t had awesome groups that wipe a lot but everyone is just happy chatting away so it doesn’t leave a bad taste when you wipe.
---
My point is this. And I won't explain this again. 
---
Servers are bigger. People want honor and competition is bigger and more fierce. You will have a shitty time level 48+ while every 60 is out there farming you the way they farm dungeons. 
---
So once again. My point is. ^
---
entangle is another DoT technically, with a root attached
---
You had me at gnomes.

Curse of Doom is really powerful in certain situations. It can be really powerful when you are solo kiting bosses such as Tinkerer, Princess, and Rotgrip in Maraudon. With one global cooldown you are guaranteeing 3200 damage in 1 minute without any follow up! Curse of Doom is also really powerful in raids when you are fighting multiple targets at once. You will attack the focus target with the rest of the raid but can apply Curse of Doom to your last target in the kill order. Again, that's 3200 for one global! It only gets better the more locks you add! Curse of Doom is also really great for burn phase bosses like Onyxia. All of the locks in the raid can blanket her with Doom at around 70%. If your raid times it right, the curses all pop in the middle of phase 2 (ranged DPS burn phase) for a big chunk of health! Lastly, you can cheese Curse of Doom on tough elementals. Curse of Doom + Banish rank 2 (30 seconds) + Banish rank 1 (20 seconds) and you essentially start the fight with 3200 damage.
---
Heartseeker - no drama but we need more horde plz
---
 Assuming you are in mostly prebis there is a slight single target dps difference in favour of 2h fury vs arms (30/21 deathwish over ms)but there is a massive difference in aoe dps in favor or arms.
---
So imo if you are still grinding dungeons in any capacity arms is the way to go untill you get to the stage of raidlogging.
---
And ofc if you are doing any pvp at all the benefit of MS arms will vastly outweigh any pve differences.
---
R I S P E C K, find out what it means to me
---
As a holy pala, i have been stacking intell with good results, i havent really struggled to heal anything yet, and i do pugs mostly. Currently lvl 49, and have done all instances atleast once. No downranking whatsoever, yet.

Hexo  the Anserine left the Mage Guild and traveled to Elwynn forest to join the Fools' Guild in Goldshire. There he found a job in the Darkmoon Faire, as Town Jester.
---
After a few months of hard work he got in touch with the local Defias Brotherhood and secretly joined them to become Hexo the Assassin...
---
Is this one of those “it was a bug back then too.  Working as intended.”?
---
They're just gonna go do a dungeon, bro. Lol. Very big deal.
---
We just do a roll off for ours. If you've already won one, you're not allowed to roll on a 2nd until the entire raid has one.
---
So everyone that currently kills anyone is an asshole? I can respect a fair fight, and more times than not I attack someone 5+ levels higher than me without even thinking. But so what if I want to kill an opposing faction member regardless of level. Many of us play by "you red you dead." They are the enemy, that is literally how the game is designed. The moment you ride by that little level 35 rogue on your mount, he is probably going to gank the lv25 guy on your faction side. Your not an asshole for playing the game how it is intended to be played. Camping that little grey for 45 mins straight, now that more of an asshole move.

---
Who does the mage us his innervate on?
---
Take it like this : you have one Window to be able to finally hit your target, would you rather hit for 600 or hit for 200?
---
Think you have your answer, you can have all the rage in the world but if you cant Spend it properly its better to hit harder.
---
Dear Mage,  don't tank the boss.
---
Love,  Priest
---
I put together a group for DM and the hunter needed a summon it wasn’t until I got to the instance we realized he was in under city. We are alliance.
---
Haha good idea :D
---
My point is, if you as a mage is invited to a dungeon and you don’t want to give water to the team that’s the same as a priest declining to heal or buffing.
---
Glad I just went daggers
---
"The popular zones" ooh you mean the zones you have to level in to get 60? Yeah, lets just avoid those.
---
I laughed more at the Ayy lmao
---
Yes, I would save up about 10 maps or so before turning in, and each landmark takes about 3-5 mins to respawn. So it took it a few hours to turn all 50 in, but buying the map fragments doesnt take much time. You do have to check the AH often tho, that part took days.
---
Close, Undead got a drop that starts a quest in duskwood. Maybe it is a SM quest, I don't know. Old history book, is the item.
---
Is this also being planned on any of the EU realms?
---
Can't log on to any US realms without buying another account subscription (no way!).
---
This is a noble initiative, so I am certain it would have a lot of participants and supporters in other regions outside of the NA.
---
I'm sorry so charge, blood rage, blood thirst then switch to zerk?

for rogue its single target damage

important to outline cuz others got good aoe

Ok

I feel this has been posted here before, and it turned out Blizz purposefully made it work like that, as it worked like that in Classic? Bit like the much slower spell-batching, how moving increases your hitbox, etc.

It's really not that hard to just rez behind a tree or cover to sneak away and quest elsewhere. Leveling my hunter alt, I didn't want any competition in a quest area, so I would kill a hunter 5 levels below me. I would kill him each time he'd rez within 20 seconds while doing the quest that took a while. About 25mins and close to a dozen kills later... why keep trying? Just move on. If your that type of player, just go quest elsewhere and come back. Its not that hard. Not worth quitting over. Maybe PVP servers just weren't for your friends.

I hope you've learned your lesson. "Friends" in WoW can do stupid shit when large amounts of gold and/or gear they really want is involved. It always brings out people's true colors in this game. It was that way in 2004, and it's that way now.

I know for a fact that this doesnt work.

He will always run back to where he was activated after losing aggro on the first player to attack him.

result orientied thinking is awful. you can get good results while playing god awful. i am not implying that was the case, but thats something you should keep in mind especially when he critized your decision making, not the result. 
---
granted the mage was a total bitch first, but if you ever want to raise children(like this mage) then you should learn to stay calm and slowly explain it for their peanut brains instead of lowering yourself to their level. you both seem unpleasant to play with, judging from that short word exchange.
---
if the mage died using blink, block, coldsnap, block, blink then its 100% your fault. if he didnt then the mage is at fault and you should have pointed at his bad decision making.(first the mechanical misplays then deciding to blame the healer).

do you even have enough self-awareness to call him a crybaby but then making the decision to cry on reddit? or how this thread could be summed up with "cool story bro" too?

Short answer: Hit is good, but you should not sacrifice an abundance of other stats in order to get it.  
---
Long answer: With 5/5 precision and 305 weapon skill (combat spec) you only need 1% hit from gear to reach the yellow hit cap. From Oto's rogue guide (which admittedly is a bit outdated, there may be a little swing here but not TOO much) these are the numbers each stat is worth assuming pre-raid BIS with buffs. [ ] is value if you use daggers.

---
I don't know what you expected honestly with the fact there's no honor system or bgs in the game yet. Half the game is missing, more than half the game when you take into account later phase PVE content. When we raided in vanilla prior to bgs coming out, you did the same exact thing except maybe you raided one extra day a week, tues and thurs in most cases. You know what you did on every other day of the week? Farm consumables or stand on the bridge in ironforge or on top of the bank in Orgrimmar. Nothing has really changed.
---
Spec healing and dungeon grind.
---
Wish you the best it's best to avoid dbags like this in the future
---
I prefer leveling on my alt rather than running be same instance over and over.
---
Hunters are fine choices for raid groups, you bring a lot to the party as Marksmen. Some people will contrast this to other classes that bring support and then some, and say that the Hunter brings nothing to a raid - not true. 
---
Trueshot Aura is a party wide affect and it provides a nice boost for physical damage so it's advantageous to bring one hunter to each party full of physical damage dealers. Hunters are also used to remove Frenzy on some bosses with Tranquilliser Shot, and despite what some people say a hunter does in fact bring respectable DPS to a raid. All this means that in a typical 40 man raid you'll have three or so hunters. This isn't many spots in the grand scheme of things but in contrast to a shadow priest for example you're practically in bliss - it also has one major advantage. 
---
In short, hunters gear up reasonably fast because you will only have to compete for class loot with two other people. Thanks to this you will likely be welcomed into a group more readily due to your equipment.
---
Am I the only one completely blown away by the 37 days played? Are you on 14 hours a day wtf?
---
It is the slow server ticks but its not a bug I'm pretty sure. That's the way the system works. Personally I think it feels very sluggish.
---
combat is 2 button play (ss and evis), in sub you use more abilities (u dont have to), u have better defence (dodge, stuns) and if u play on pvp sever, random pvp is better. 
---
that beein said, all specs in all classes r viable and the difference is minor. ull more likely see bigger difference in equip than in spec (meaning sub rogue could level faster than combat just becouse he got better weapons)
---
you must know what white damage is a massive part of rogue DPS
---
and white damage hit cap is very high like 20%+
---
so having more hit is still a great thing

Not really. It'll do a bit more damage but you'll have significantly more downtime than a screech pet.

My world PVP experience has been delightful. I see all these posts complaining about what you just did but I just don't see it. I don't think its a server issue either, except the heaviest skewed ones. Both of my characters have had over 95% fights against people within their level range while leveling. And tons of them at that. Its been a bloodbath, my pvp record keeping addon is always filled. Yeah you run into the occasional 60 camping hillsbrad for 3 hours straight, but just don't play into their games lol.

You just need Level 5 to train disenchantment that is all
---
As no: you do not need a enchanting lvl?
---
Cool thanks

Your editing style reminds me a lot of HawkrayTV from Heroes of the Storm (https://youtu.be/ElmDmpWBOls) and I love it! Do you know Hawkray or are you the same person? Sorry for comparing you to another artist but all I have is praise for your creativity. Cheers
---
Big bad shoulders too
---
Max out your proffesions. Get pre-bis. Get a PvP set. Farm consumables for upcoming raids. Farm gold. Boost people through dungeons for fun/gold. Protect lowbies trying to quest in contested zones.
---
There are A LOT of things to do in the game, you just dont want to do it because you dont get massive rewards.
---
Arms all the way. Sweeping strikes is amazing to farm mobs with and in combination with WW axe (or bonebiter, if you are alliance) you have a much easier and faster time leveling
---
Couple days probably, if they do it again after that then the bigger hammer comes out.
---
Horde sit outside dungeon entrances all the time. GET A LIFE.
---
You can shorten this further by using multiple conditionals.
---
    /use [@mouseover,harm,nodead,mod:shift][mod:shift]Gouge;[@mouseover,harm,nodead][]Blind
---
Is a macro i use for gouge/blind. 
---
Leaving the "#showtooltip" as just that will make it contextual as long as you select the "?" for the icon, where as "#showtooltip blind" will always and only show the blind tooltip.
---
Using multiple conditionals acts as a kind of fall through logic. Macros are read from left to right, and every [] set are for conditionals. You can have multiple conditional sets for a single ability as long as you understand it will stop at the first one that returns true, and leaving the set blank acts as no contionals.
---
For example the macro i listed earlier does the following.
---
Shows the contextual tooltip in conjunction with having the "?" icon selected for the macro
---
    /use
---
saves 1 character for the 255 character macro limit, functions the same as /cast outside of some nuanced and specific situations.
---
   [@mouseover,harm,nodead,mod:shift][mod:shift]Gouge
---
First conditional, checks for a mouseover target that is hostile and not dead, only fires if the shift key is held. If this returns true it uses gouge on that target. If it does not it checks the second conditional, "[mod:shift]" which is if shift is held down. If so it casts gouge, meaning it functions as if you had just clicked the spell in your spellbook.
---
    ;
---
separates for a another ability within the same macro, will only check for the other ability if the first returns false.
---
    [@mouseover,harm,nodead][]Blind
---
First conditional checks for a mouseover target that is hostile and not dead. If this returns true it uses Blind on that target. If it does not it checks the second conditional "[]" which is blank, meaning it functions as if you had just clicked the spell in your spellbook.
---
Sorry if my explaination is overly verbose, i just wanted to make it clear and easy to follow. Macros are amazing tools, both for accessibility (i have very severe RSI in my wrist, smart macro usage allows me to play the game effectively and efficiently without aggravating it.) and for usability. By understanding the basics you can continually build on them for things like these macros.
---
    /use [worn:Fishing Pole]Bright Baubles;[mod:shift]Crippling Poison;[mod:ctrl]Deadly Poison;Instant Poison
---
    /use [button:1] 16; [button:2] 17;
---
    /click StaticPopup1Button1
---
If you have a fishing pole equipped it will apply bright baubles, if you are holding shift it will apply crippling poison, if you are holding control it will apply deadly poison, else it will apply instant poison (replace them it appropriate ranks as needed. If you left click those thing swill be applied to your main hand, if you right click your offhand. Lastly it will auto accept the popup to replace an existing weapon enhancement.
---
or 
---
    /use [stealth]Pick Pocket
---
    /use [stealth]Sap;[mod:shift]Kidney Shot;[@mouseover,harm,nodead][]Riposte
---
    /use [nostealth,worn:bow]Shoot Bow;[nostealth,worn:crossbow]Shoot Crossbow;[nostealth,worn:gun]Shoot Gun;[nostealth,worn:thrown]Throw
---
If you are stealthed it will pick pocket and sap. If you are not stealthed and are holding shift it will kidney shot, if you are not stealthed and have a hostile, non-dead target it will riposte on that target, if none of those are true it will ruposte on your current target.
---
if none of the above are true it will use the appropriate ranged attack skill as long as your are not stealthed, and have the corresponding weapon type equipped, and are within range.
---
Sorry for the tangent, but i do hope my long ramble as i fly from undercity to Booty Bay is helpful to someone =P or at the very least entertaining to read.
---
Lastly, the best macro for a wand user is
---
    /use Shoot
---
    /dance
---
Because who doesn't want to rock out with their wand out.
---
Mages are not obligated to give you free water outside of a dungeon.
---
Goldshire is the nudest area.
---
If loot rules are stated first then it’s fine imo. 
---
Then if people don’t like it they won’t join and the one making the rules can re-evaluate how they are getting that item.

I hope you realize this attitude leads to the same Undead Rogues doing shit like camping Broken Tooth.

Yesterday this low level horde took advantage of me attempting to solo a higher level elite in the arathi highlands. In response I walked to the horde questing area of Hillsbrad Foothills and made it mine for an hour.

It ended with a hord raid on Southshore. Good times!

On Atiesh we've got a running joke about a guy named Hoboo. He's got a legend of ninjalooting, abandoning dungeons, and being an overall prick. But, he sometimes acts good and end. Up with a few whiteknights backing him up
---
Playing human for perks and I always carry 100 noggenfogger. Here is your solution.
---
I always played humans since I'm a PvE boy but yes I'm tired of their animations. So I have a Noggen budget, an orb of deception, furbolg form and almost ogre suit for DM now.
---
I don't have my epic mount yet but priorities gotta be straight.
---
Apparently the game 'saves up' the proc during blade storm for after its done - saw it on another post, could be wrong.
---
Warriors getting a core hound tooth should depend on race and faction. It's BiS off-hand for non human alliance warriors, both rogues and warriors can use swords and daggers so it's not really fair to stop someone from trying to get their BiS item because "sneaky rogue Stabby Stabby needs Daggy Daggy". Rogues has got to learn how to live with it, because in AQ40, daggers are BiS for non human alliance warriors again. Also, daggers is not even as good as swords for rogues to begin with, so they're literally better for warriors than rogues. Whether rogues want daggers/swords in PvP is a playstyle thing, if anything, you could make the argument that swords are better because they dish out more damage in whitehits whilst building CP to control the fight.
---
You cannot get a weapon with equal dps on that level. You can however buy the crests at the AH for cheap and ask around for help with the tusks in STV. People tend to help warriors a lot.
---
I had that shit back in classic.  My whole server, it was me, and some dude on alliance.  We had the only Rich Purple Silk mojo.  It was fun.  Not much profit, though, because nobody gives a shit about shirts.
---
My characters all have that shirt, though.
---
You can learn enchanting at lvl 5 and desenchant
---
What do i need to run UBRS?
---
Ive ran BRD and LBRS but do i need some sort of key and how do i get it for UBRS?
---
Privileged mages. It's always mages.

Seems perfectly normal to me. He was visiting an old friend in Lorderon. They were talking about how unfair it is that hunters don't get priority on Thunderfury books.
---
My retail imp is called Pipqua &lt;3
---
I’ve done both and had a blast with each. Sub you survive easier but kill slower. Pvp is possible with combat but you’ll notice some obvious stuff that favors pvp in the sub tree. Up to you in the end. For classic I went combat the whole way bc I wanted to force myself to get better at pvp while combat specced. Just didn’t wanna respec all the time for raids. That’ll change when bugs come out tho lol. 
---
I probably have more fun playing sub if I had to pick tho.
---
‘...but did you block bro?’
---
People like this usually double down cos they know they’re in the wrong.
---
Only one person needs the key, it's quite time consuming to get. Requires a rare drop from 3 lbrs bosses.
---
You don’t need a separate set of gear to tank dungeons. I understand not wanting to tank because it’s stressful, but the gear argument is nonsense.
---
Yep, just checked and looks like it's America's RP server
---
I have a wild card with that one... my wife has been my healer in dungeons ever since we started playing. So if we need to reserve something we will start the group and announce from the beginning what is reserved. So as a healer make a friend who is a tank you guys start the group and announce what is reserved. You will get dps just as fast as you joined the group without reserves
---
agi, str, stam, spirit
---
Nope, no pet. Only item i recall having negative spirit was the ring you get from silverpine forest from a quest. But i dont have that equipped anymore 🤔
---
Demonology talent ?
---
Having played both factions I can honestly say that racials favor horde but both have decent racials that work for certain classes. The thing is people try to min max but pvp and pve metas are incompatible so they choose one over the other and get mad when they're disadvantaged in their non meta choice. The horde meta choices are less disadvantaged.
---
As an alliance warrior if I were to pvp I'd 100% go gnome but everyone is human for the sweet weapon skills. Alliance rogues have way better racial options than horde but most stick to human. Alliance hunters are better than horde hunters hands down.
---
The thing is, hardiness and will of the forsaken counter the two most prolific types of CC in the game. Alliance just have tools against snares and poisons, which influence fewer classes. That's all that this really comes down to.
---
Dear Horde.
---
Please stinkbomb Southshore so I can finish the quest.
---
You don't have to be the best dps to complete a dungeon, however it's not happening without a tank, so yeah.
---
Would there be much of a market for Swift Flight Bracers? The mats are expensive but they're only slightly worse than Bracers of the Eclipse, but could be reliably bought on the AH instead of being drop reliant. 
---
Swift Flight Bracers are mail with 160 armour, + 7 Stam, and +41 Ranged Attack Power.
---
In my eyes horde are all the same. If one pisses me off, I’m pissed off at all of them and entire faction will pay for the transgressions of one player.
---
Gotta feed that circle of hate.
---
Shadow bolt on E?!
---
Sounds like he was advertising free water
---
Taking photos of display in 2k19 jesus
---
Think you just need levels to enchant. The disenchant skill never levels up
---
I don't see anything wrong with this one, its a trade mat and its the only reason the tank is even going at all. That dungeon is a unique situation because there's no gear from there the tank actually wants.
---
Probably not... Most likely asking if anyone wants water.
---
In Southshore
---
Enjoy folks!
---
Shadow priest plus warlock combo in diremaul is lethal due to all the single/small packs with high hp. Not to mention with vamp it actually does help the healer a ton with conserving mana, youve got shield, downranked fears for appropriate situation, silence, spirit tap + some mp5 gear and you barely have to drink long as youre downranking mind flays on maxing shadoweave before you blast them with top rank mind blast and mind flay. With a shadow priest in dire maul id wager your runs are way more efficient time wise than a close to meta group.
---
Theyre pretty terrible in BRD tho not gonna lie. Anything that has a lot of mobs in packs that arent elites tbh because their lack of aoe.

Actually you just die next to a gate

Does this also work if my pet is still being attacked by a mob? I always had the feeling I am not out of combat while my pet is still attacking/being attacked, so I never used that macro. FD just puts me out of combat but not my pet right?
---
Then he should have stated a price.
---
You probably thought it’s the mage’s fault to pull boss aggro in this fight, no?
---
What enchants on the weaps? Currently lvl 52
---
Alliance blaumaux ?
---
Yup dont sell an item if It's DPS oriented if you get Hit oriented and vice versa.
---
When you'll get the stat you miss on one item switch back to the other one, dont follow BiS gear like a sheep. Maintain your cap and work around it to min/max other stats. Watch the 2P/3P bonuses, parse them. It's what I find the most fun in Vanilla itemization.
---
As a lock I just spam sb all day and sometimes dot up bosses.
---
It's on the left next to the chat in the standard UI, the typical 'Sounds' pictogram
---
Depends a bit on the item IMO. If its a novelty item like Teebu's or a rare recepie then I'm fine with everyone rolling need, buy if its just straight up gear you cant or wont use then you obviously shouldnt be rolling need on it. Its called Need/Greed for a reason. Greed literally being "To sell"
---
bumped into a druid that ganked me in ashenvale when i was a wee lad, i'm 60 now and he's 40.. revenge was sweet
---
I have a question about pets:
---
Pets have 300 Skillpoints to work with. Now if i tame a cat with dash - does this cat lose 30 skillpoints and starts with 270 because it has dash already learned or am I saving 30 points because the cat already has the abililty learned and I still get to use 300 points ?
---
So don’t post a picture at all, if it isn’t the news? No picture is better than these stupid phone pictures. We can all see this in-game but thanks for the PSA I guess...
---
there isn't even a disenchant skill.  Every Enchanter can just disenchant everything at skill 1 in Enchanting. (although you won;t stay at skill 1 if you disenchant, because a disenchant gives skill points TOO until about skill 50 or so.
---
I’m a 44 alliance rogue and I’d love to quest with you some time tomorrow. I was planning on hitting the higher level quests in stv
---
Amen.

Sometimes it ticks for 21 as well. I don't know why and how it hasn't been fixed yet but I've reported it like 10 times already.
---
If you don't read every bit of quest text, pull 1 mob at a time and level at 2k xp/hr you're not enjoying the game according to Reddit

There is a maccaw parrot that has a 1 in 10.000 drop chance, the same as the mount of Baron Rivendare.

---
I noticed that pople have no clue how threat works. Most of the people will not let you hit once or twice before AoEing.
---
It’s all good in lower level dungeons, but I feel DPSers should get the habit of waiting a couple of seconds before going ham. It will help in later dungeons.
---
Nova first to trigger Shatter. Then CoC to (almost) oneshot them and maybe one more AE.
---
Jesus christ lmao
---
Please delete this before somebody thinks its a good idea and starts annoying me with stupid whispers

Keep engi, you should've taken a gathering prof from the start. Now you could invest in leveling Alch and sell potions from bought AH mats.
---
Or... Start playing the AH by identifying trends in prices of potions etc. Buy low sell high.
---
TL;DR:
---
"I want to reserve items, but my mind gets blown when other people also want to reserve items"

Even his ad caused your items to suffer a durability loss, don't trust this guy!

I learnt that when im tanking all dps gets salvation, no matter how they cry about it

Spirit does help but first aid can counter act not having any spirit. I’d go agi, stam, str. And keep your first aid up to date

id rather have 2 hellfires and a hurricane than a bad mage rn

I think this is really just not true, but a lot does depend on the group.

of all the brands he could choose, this guy went with lacoste?? pshhh

Did a DM east jump run with three mages and a priest, the book for the epic tank sword dropped and everyone needed.  
---
The worst part is none of them seemed to think there was an issue with this, as a tank I tend to disagree but whatever, can't change people being greedy.
---
&gt;Is there any truth to this?
---
of course not. 
---
There will be more pvp but you can always avoid most of it.  Just don;t go to the most popular quests hubs at rush hour.

---
Someone else pointed out in the thread that part of it also comes down to the player mindset. 
---
I think horde players are more willing to engage in pvp since that plays more into their game lore vs the alliance which is much more pve. 
---
Horde has the "zug zug" whereas the alliance don't have an aggressive ethos. I leveled on Herod from day one and there was a LOT of pvp happening since faction imbalance wasn't an issue but I can't honestly say I've seen alliance players really go out of their way to pvp unless they had a serious advantage. And this is back when Arathi highlands and Ashenvale was mostly Alliance controlled. Meanwhile horde players would willingly hop into 2v4s because "zug zug".
---
Lol I have that same guy on my friends list - him and tashi ran me thru ulda at like 34
---
Fury tends to become good after you get gear. I’d stay arms until you raid a bit
---
Arthas did nothing wrong.

Run with &lt;Undercity Mafia&gt; on horde, you’ll have a reason to complain.
---
Retail doesn't have low drop rates on anything anymore?
---
does it beep when it finds what I want?
---
Easy solution here, join a guild and dont play with these dbags
---
Correct. This happened back in vanilla too.
---
The person selling them on my server is named Mom I think it is a better brand name
---
As a mage I've got to say that it is really annoying to enter any main city and get 3 whispers at a time asking for water or ports and on occasion the opened trade with no context. Ask in /1 and you will find someone. Sorry, my rants over :)
---
Not complete nonsense. Many Warriors wear leather and mail pieces while leveling, which makes tanking harder. The other day I had a Paladin tank in my group for ST and he took tons of damage. Turned out not even half of his items were Plate. He even wore a couple Cloth pieces...
---
Why is it ALWAYS gnomes? Im not sure that ive ever been ganker by any other race tbh.

Going by your name I'm going to assume you're a troll but anyway, here goes: you're*

Feudal Japan, farming sandals, obviously.

Uhmmm... Undead rogue is the ultimate ganking race/class combo. 99% of people rolling undead rogues on a PvP server do it for griefing potential.
---
You are exaggerating. A Lot.

pst for food and water

Completely the opposite, since classic has nog real endgame content it's very casual

Funny you say that. [This](https://render-us.worldofwarcraft.com/character/bleeding-hollow/111/114251375-main.jpg) is actually my rogue from Retail I haven't played in a long time, but I still live the xmog lol
---
Being openly whiny is optional.
---
I personally just use tab targetting
---
I have no problem when people questing there too to kill me to have the mobs for themselves. I have no problem with a group questing there killing me for fun. But that damn 60 rogue who had fun to gang 3 of us repeatetly in badlands really has some serious issues.
---
Where did you find the tinythreat plugin? Is it incorporated in the Details addon?
---
Believe whatever you want, mate. 
---
Just don't be disrespectful, please.

I made a /stopcasting macro so I could cancel heals at a whim. It doesn't work however if my mouse is hovering over a name in the group or raid. What am I doing wrong?
---
All it does is:
---
/stopcasting
---
Right now I have to move my cursor outside of the raidframes to make it work.
---
Alliance has much worse PvP racials. People who want to gank - roll undead for WotF.
---
It's so unfortunately they couldn't figure a way to get the 1.12 client to work. 
---
What they did is so hacked together. There's SOO many remnants of the Modern Client causing massive bugs and inconsistencies. I don't know what bigwig at Blizzard (or more likely Activision) forced them to release Classic before it was ready. But it clearly wasn't ready.
---
Fairly common, everything about that "Sleep" effect makes you expect it to be a normal magic debuff but SURPRISE it's really a Banish and have fun with that, sucker.
---
I got it on my 2nd run
---
Fishing pole in desolace, near the horde camp. Had similar looking inventory when I farmed mine :D
---
Kama on Reddit ?
---
It is more advisable to go arms until 60.
---
Thanks for the advice, this is great.
---
I think the point is that it was a DPS looking for both tank &amp; healer, which makes it kind of ichy.
---
Spend a couple weeks tanking pugs and you will end up on a lot of people's friends list
---
What
---
As a 60 priest can you spec into the spirit buff to train prayer of spirit then respec back to shadow and retain prayer of spirit or do you need to keep the talent to keep prayer of spirit available?
---
Tree fitty
---
I personally love the lvl 40 ram, but I hate the lvl 60 one, I just don't fancy the new position of the head because it makes me feel like I am sticking out or something. Completely agree with your point on the raptor, that bounce is hectic and I also agree that you're completely on point otherwise. Nightsaber first, Orc Wolf second, Undead Horse third.
---
Thing is, though, that the person reserving items will put on master looter when they reach the specific boss. So there won't be any rolling on items.
---
Imagine being so entitled that you think you get to decide how someone else plays the game.  If you want a tank for groups so bad roll one yourself.
---
2H Fury until 39, then respec into 2H Arms for Mortal Strike at 40. Work your way back down the Fury tree until you hit 60 and then respec as you need to from there.
---
Horde
---
Azshara
---
I feel like you may have miss judged, on my realm I always see guilds advertising for main tanks and off tanks, the guild I’m in atm are also looking for my and ot roles to be filled, even levelling there does seem to be a lack of tanks, luckily as a warrior this doesn’t really effect me as I can easily tank 5 mans as arms/fury and considering going prot to raid as my for my guild
---
I feel like if you was to give warrior another shot but level it as fury/arms at 40 you can still tank 5 mans even with a 2h (depends on your healer) I’d be quite surprised! Could even find a guild that accepts levellers and push for mt or ot and if you’re showing dedication to levelling you’ll be able to keep that spot
---
It’s up to you man but I wouldn’t knock it to soon
---
What's the hype around broken tooth about?
---
Oh, I see. Bold strategy.
---
sup stretch
---
Not sure about Druid but mirahs way better for Prot.
---
Highest atk speed in the game, makes it best for interrupting casters in PVP. Therefore it is very reasonable to whine about being PVPed while trying to get what is essentially PVP gear.
---
Are you completely ignoring this post then?
---
Fury is probably better until level 40, your talents do a lot more for your dps. Once you are 40 mortal strike and sweeping strikes are a very effective combo, and you are no longer a garaunteed free kill in pvp.
---
You can do fury all the way, if you don't wanna jack up respecc costs.
---
Arms is more versatile and because you'll be using a 2h you won't miss nearly as much if you were dual wield fury. Fury is better once you hit 60 and start to gear out with +hit gear. Give it a shot if you are curious but arms is an easier time for leveling.
---
Once you hit 40 as arms and have access to both mortal strike and sweeping strikes you get a lot more offensive utility and survivability
---
Played a rogue back in the day.  This happened back then too.  Sadly a bug that's now a "feature".
---
Welcome to classic.
---
There’s two sides to the coin ofc. Simply opening trade seems rude af imo. I always whisper asking to buy so it’s clear beforehand I intend to pay for the service. 
---
I usually get 60 food and 60 water which = 24 stacks of 5 at 36s a pop in the vendor, i.e 8g 64s. 
---
I usually tip the mage 2g. 
---
The mage makes 2g for doing next to no work, I save 6g 64s by asking politely. 
---
It’s a win-win really, don’t know why people have such problems with this simple concept :p
---
With the legions of rogues and mages we have, you could think a few of them would reroll to a tank instead of complaining that others refuse to do it.
---
As a priest I’d like to say boo fucking hoo
---
A 2.0 per does benefit more from frenzy. (Their attack speed goes down to 1.4?) But I read you will need to max out frenzy to reliably keep it up. I heard 1.2 speed pets only need 4/5 frenzy. Dunno which would be better
---
Lore trivia, screenshot contests, races with live commentary(across the map), custom quests(like Oh no our gm is sick and only lv13 priest can heal him/her or we are preparing feast we need this and this), dps/heal contests, raids with alcohol(every death is 1 shot etc.) and karaoke nights.
---
They could, and ideally hunters could spam wing clip to prof Nightfall but good luck convincing them to do that
---
It's even worse as a Druid tank. Rogues, Shamans, Hunters and even Warriors roll on leather non-caster gear. And you can't really blame them - some pieces are actually very good for DPS\Leveling.
---
I hereby introduce myself then, Fruitofthdoom
---
nope -&gt; Key Bindings -&gt; Interface Panel -&gt; Toggle Chat Pane

I actually have BRE as well /flex
---
But you will get kills, if your someone who's good enough at pvp to rank that high.
---
As manly as a gnome can get
---
It certainly does proc during bladestorm and bladestorm also procs off the windfury.  I have spun for well over 20 seconds due to this and the windfury damage is noticeable on your target (but it wont do WF damage as an aoe).
---
Yup, but have you ever actually had it? Soooo much sugar!
---
Basically. I sacrifice sleep and work time just to play more.
---
Stepped from 8h a day to 5 with no break. Not losing that much on payslip and got more time for that junk of a game.
---
&gt; parry on backstab (how??)
---
Probably your client thinks you're behind the mob while the server thinks you aren't.
---
Not necessarily more important but if you’re waiting for a tank, there is a probability that you are on your way or already close to the instance. If it’s the case, it’s a trade off of 1 soul stone and 10 seconds of your time compared to a 20 minutes travel sometimes...
---
If you’re not close to the instance however...
---
This is correct. My shaman would often oneshot mobs in SM after a whirlwind because i had like 3 WF stacked. 
---
If you keep an eye om combatlog you can see the proc but there wont be any damage.
---
Gotta keep the talent to keep the spell.
---
Am undead rogue, can confirm. Cannibalize everyone
---
I keep getting ticks of 21 energy once in a while and that just rocks :p But yes, something is wrong.
---
Last expac we had Aman’thul’s Vision which was obscenely rare. Like classic deathcharger’s reins rare.
---
You still get some xp. It's not too bad, give it a go.
---
I guess nothing hurts you...
---
-ONLY GRASS!!
---
Ah, cool :). Just assumed you might not since asking for ideas. 
---
Blizzcon is coming up, could buy virtual tickets to it. Though not sure how much Classic content it'll be have specifically. I always find value in watching other game events even though I dont play those games. And theres the concert at the end and opening intro stuff. Last time they had the classic demo. Turns into a couple good days of content to jump in and out of.
---
Should I stay 2h and look for an axe upgrade?
---
I'm a paled in tank. The tree mobs, tree boss and Prince all have agro dumps. Not a fun instance for us.
---
Same as all the good stuff in wow.
---
I thought it was best to put some points in prot if I’m going to be tanking dungeons?
---
I dont think retail has anything to do with wanting a dedicated healer for a dungeon and personally they dont have to take you and just because they didnt doesnt make them wrong it makes you petty for making this post.
---
Someone saved a bundle of gold. Congratulations!
---
Reeeeeeeee
---
Wands have the best dpm! ;)
---
This panel opens when you shift click a channel. Might be a forgotten removed feature, not an impactful one either way
---
Healer here too! Vuhdo does both actually, and is a fantastic addon, if a little overwhelming at first. Is it Clique you're using? I've got that too, the classic Clique+Grid2. I had to switch off Vuhdo because it wouldn't show me other people's incoming heal in a raid but I heard from other folks it's been added/fixed. 
---
If you don't mind some friendly advice, I strongly suggest making Soulstone resurrection and your buff icons visible on every frame, really useful! It doesn't *have* to be icons, any kind of indicator that you would understand can work.
---
Yup this is a variation of "the birthday problem". 1/10000 chance of 3 people rolling the same number. 1/1000000 chance of 3 people rolling 69.
---
30 hours is ~150 runs. That's pretty good for the savage.
---
I have levelled till around lvl 40 with sub spec and found it extremely fun. Opening with an almost guaranteed ambush crit for half the mobs health never gets old. But I found that if anything went wrong like missing an ambush opening or pulling an extra mob made things significantly different.
---
I switched to combat swords after getting the Sm and rfd quest reward swords and thought combat was going to be boring. It's not. I feel so much more powerful and yes even though most of the time I'm just as spamming I love being able to take more then 1mob at a time and having oh shit DPS cd's to use every 2 and 5 mins.
---
I honestly enjoy combat swords more now than I did with sub daggers
---
What’s a death roll
---
The guildy betrayal though
---
It's a 45 minute dungeon not a sketchy sexual encounter. Just shut up and get the loot, who the fuck cares if you have to press this button instead of that one.
---
Gaming rogues in general is a bad idea if you value your time. I've stalked and corpse camped gankers for hours until they hs. Stealth is nice like that you never know if they're around and you'll spend the next hour wondering if you'll get jumped.
---
Just lie lmao
---
why do you think people prefer to be on 70/30 servers and be part of the 70 lol
---
Would you say there's a minimum amount of gear needed for this or would it just make it safer / speed it up? It seems like there isn't really a minimum, but maybe the last bosses HoT requires dps to out do it idk.
---
It’s 5g for the second stable slot
---
Hey, I’m using Clique atm, still leveling so I’m still learning. 
---
What do you mean about soul stone resurrection visible on every “frame”?
---
I got 5.8k Mana and I still need the mana gem and occasionally pots
---
OMFG!!!!! ITS THE SEX NUMBER 3 TIMES WOW NO WAY DUDE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Love how at the beginning, all my friends said they love SW over IF. Now that we have reached 50+. All of them spend have hearths set in IF or wetlands. They barely touch SW unless they have a specific reason to run down there. They have learned just how useful and easy the true capitol of the alliance is. 
---
Although at least UC isn’t Darnassus. That place is just useless if you aren’t a night elf.
---
While the Kingdom of Lordaeron proper was only Tirisfal Glades, both Plaguelands, Silverpine Forest, and Hillsbrad Foothills, the kingdom of Alterac (Alterac Mountains) was conquered and effectively annexed, though the area remained ungoverned and effectively lawless. Also, the Island of Tol Barad is claimed by Lordaeron, though after the 2nd war there was only a minor military presence on the island. The Kingdoms of Gilneas and Kul Tiras (made up by the regions of the same name) were allies of Lordaeron. The Kingdom of Stromgarde claims Arathi Highlands, but as seen in the game, they barely hold any territory. Finally, while the Wetlands are claimed by the dwarves of Ironforge, the city of Menethil harbor was built and maintained by the forced of Lordaeron, and the land it sits is effectively on loan from Ironforge to Lordaeron.
---
What I think is pretty amazing is that Lordaeron was not completely wiped out, despite both the scourge and the burning legion. The towns of Hillsbrad, Southshore, and the small city of Menethil Harbor survived, and were effectively annexed by the Kingdom of Azeroth, and the Scarlet Monastery, Hearthglen, and Tyr's Hand survived, and were united by the Scarlet Crusade. It really shows just how much of a powerhouse Lordaeron must have been at its height. Probably why the Burning Legion didn't just invade, but wanted to soften them up with the Scourge first.
---
And almost no one ever notice it except for a few bugs here and there. QQ
---
Zardoz
---
Your comment honestly just confuses me.  This wasn't a bug in vanilla.  The nochange crowd would want this bug fixed.  What are you trying to imply?
---
Azuresong yes because crit and SP are essential for holy pallies (crit &gt; healing for holy pallies) robes of volatile power no that should be a lock/mage prio item unless your a spelladin in pve. Just the way it is unfortunately unless you directly request an item with a strong case (for pvp for example). Otherwise if you want niche items that other casters want you might be better off in a more laidback guild when it comes to loot.
---
This is coming from a ret pally that is well aware of loot priority in a semi hardcore raiding guild,
---
Exactly. Speccing into prot as fury (for imp shield block) is only useful for raid boss tanking. Warrior mitigation comes from gear not talents. Deep arms and deep fury can easily tank 5 mans.
---
Power trip
---
By the way I don't care about that, I'm not racist, just an orc that smorcs
---
I had 73 runs before I won it. This was also the first time I saw it drop
---
mmh, probably just trial and error sadly.
---
Or they do, but are totally chill with a pally tank ;)
---
I already invested 1.5hr without success, I don't want to stop now, becouse then if I dont' eventually find it it will be wasted time :P damn i'm hooked :P
---
karg
---
As if warriors don't regularly roll on leather and mail gear as it is, i.e. Truestrike Shoulders, Savage Gladiator Chain, Eye of Rend, Mask of the Unforgiven, etc.
---
I'm sorry, but brd requires a min maxed spec, full healing prebis, and approve from hr, please vacate the dungeon premises
---
You wearing a Perditionsblade?? You Madman!! :D
---
Ill hope together with a CHT and The Leathergloves!
---
Remulos represent!
---
Jeez, you gm or something?
---
Alright, I just went through it so I cn shine some light.
---
At 55, the only dungeon you will find groups for will be brd. I'd focus on the onyxia attunement and saving the princess there, and you might get some prebis on the way. Afterwards, western plague lands, start the in dreams quest chain (with tyrion). At 58 you might be able to get a few groups for lbrs if you create them yourself, do that and focus on bijou's belongings into maxwell's mission. An dthen finish your attunement at 59 in ubrs.
---
Finally, spec wise, as the other said, the best moment to resoec fury is 5 mn before your first Mc run.
---
&gt; The best part is that as a dps he thinks you not getting in his groups is a thing.
---
As a healer myself, I would have ignored him long before this healer explicitly for that purpose.  I pop a lot of consumables when I'm healing.  Obviously not as many in dungeon as in raid, but for some reason DPS seem to have this idea that they don't need to.  Not sure why a mage wouldn't be carrying potions.  I do on my mage alt.
---
Plus you get synergy going.  Me and my priest duo all kinds of stuff that should take a 5 man group of 55+s and it's a blast seeing what kind of stuff we can pull off that we really shouldn't be able to. There's nothing better than a great warrior/priest combo who play a lot together honestly.
---
Is it worth taking advantage of free transfers atm? On Ghandling EU atm.
---
Especially important in pvp.
---
Nope, BG battlemasters are already in major cities.
---
You're literally crying like a child that "He only has greens and ony neck"
---
You put words into your own mouth and are upset when you get called a spoiled brat for what *you yourself* said? Are you serious?
---
Good jokes but The actual answer is Orcs
---
Did you get killed right after the message bc you were distracted by the message? &gt;.&lt;
---
*Nods*
---
your fine... phase 2 won’t come until next year. you have plenty of time. don’t worry about it too much, your faction will almost always help out as well. don’t let dumb ppl scare you.
---
wonder if u can make an addon to auto swap at low hp
---
Is it worth using the Evergreen Pouch for a non-herbalist? Is the return on the 9s per seed enough?
---
He says he's both horde and ally but his text says he plays horde religiously and suck at killing hunters.
---
It isn't even about wiping you smooth brain child. Tanks take hits more then dps, which means they lose armor and weapon durability even if you don't die.
---
How can you not know about basic fucking game mechanics and try to act "smart" Fuck off kid.
---
We're likely on a different server where PuGs have different cultures. The head was raid rolled and I happened to win. Nobody in the raid was mad about it so I'm not sure why randos on reddit are mad about it
---
No they were just as bad in vanilla. Private servers got drops wrong

My 900 DPS which I wouldn't ever have had otherwise seems to disagree.

oh, I disabled the icons next to the chat\^\^
---
This sounds like great fun, but I won’t be home until 15 minutes after it starts.  Can I catch up?

But you didn't call me a spoiled brat..

All I did was call OP RNG carried (which he is) - he has been very lucky. What's wrong with that? How am I "crying?" *You* are the one who chose to see my comment as a complaint, rather than the statement it is.

I show you a log of people doing naxx dps and you are disputing it by saying they used CDs on short fights?
---
Homie the fights are short because we do naxx dps, not the other way around.
---
Awsome! Im 24 now, should i wait?
---
I hexed it with Rank 1 hex. Worked very well.
---
That's a very strong reaction to have. What would you have me do when gear that I need drops? Pass until I have the pre-pre-bis and then roll on dals? Not accept the Ony head from the raid-rolled pug? I don't understand your contention
---
I meant that if a person in a raid - any person - has soulstone resurrection cast on them, it should be visible to you so it's easy to spot if nobody has it! For example, [this is how my frames are set up](https://gyazo.com/04abd765f028b70c486e7900f0d6b778). Class colours as background, only mana bar displayed not other powers, priest buffs upper right, soulstone right side, debuffs change the bar colour according to whether it's magic or disease, icons visible in the middle.
---
Got suckered into this last night. He’s lucky my favorite color is purple and that I’m a sucker for rare shit.
---
5g for a shirt, ugh.
---
There is also an empty slot on the pet spell bar where growl should be
---
i am mainspec feral tank . i have easy time to get gear, in MC i am performing better than average warrior as druids have more armor and hp, and druids have more options for fire res gear
---
I can say without a doubt that I spend my time in this room as shadow merely putting shields on people and healing because I have zero aoe.
---
I’m a fury warrior and I carry a couple extra pieces of plate on my bags for tanking. Hell sometimes I even put them on for DPSing 5 mans because I generally take more damage in those than raiding. 
---
This is classic. You don’t need to meta the game 99.9999998% of the time for omg maximum DPS potential. Even without being exact hit cap I still do a fuck ton of damage and top the damage meters nearly 90% of the time. 
---
Some of the people I’ve come across in the game and the level of seriousness they take it is almost laughable. The game is really, really easy.
---
SHIFT MOUSE SCROLL FOR ASPECT OF THE MONKEY?
---
As a level 60 rogue with 10% hit should I aim for getting more gear with hit or am I already at the point where it diminishes?
---
Warlocks can aoe them down just as fast especially when they are two Done it many times
---
He’s sitting in Iron Forge afk anyways, how do I not value the time of others? That’s seriously what you took from this?
---
That would suck if you enjoyed the sound of mail and hated plate.
---
Do you use "water closet"?  I have been using bio (break) since I was like 16 playing MMO's.  15 years later I've never heard of "wc" or "water closet".  Haha.
---
What part of the world are you from?  Kind of sounds like an Assuie/New Zealand thing just at first glance.
---
Yeah ppl forget that locks have power of aoe as well
---
The thing that crocodiles do?
---
That’s funny haha
---
can still pow everyone so I dont mind
---
&gt;This group reminded me how important the social aspect in the game is above all else.
---
Yea that's been a huge revelation with classic. I mean the social aspect has always been known to be important but damn. It's so nice to have people be dependant on help from others and having a reputation. People actually have a reason to be nice and talk to each other rather than being total dickholes because it doesn't matter and you're never going to see any of these people ever again anyways.
---
You literaly broke the window man.
---
What do u mean by clipping? I got Rhok’delar two days ago. How do I rotate in a raid?
---
You have a talent. Lmao great vid
---
Haha was it on Razorgore?
---
That's exactly it. If your attacks miss you get some energy back.
---
Bro... I literally have goosebumps reading it. Must have been terrible. Worst part is it's this cliche undead rogue asshole I imagine them living for these kind of momenta lmao.
---
Do they actually change it? I never join these group so I don't know how it works but I would never trust a PUG player to master-loot anything personally. It shouldn't even be possible to change loot allocation after the instance is created imo.
---
Are you honestly comparing someone killing you in a video game to assaulting a child?  Dont be a fool.
---
Silly elf, horses are for humans!
---
I saw a video recently that talked about this. When your die, you roll from 999 down to either 1 or 0. Whomever gets there first loses.
---
Best thing I've seen so far is "LF1M tank Strat UD Mount on res for you!!" Bribing tanks with epic mounts seems to work
---
Can fiery enchant proc on Ravager’s whirlwind effect?
---
So your saying warriors can't tank a dungeon if he isn't protection specced? Good then i know
---
Do what you want. I went arms for inp. Overpower, just went fury as 52 and I'm not going back, just more fun for me!
---
Bdc92. Dis you actually mean fury/arms or did you mean DW/2h?
---
The same thing that appears on the mini-map appears on the world map as well. You can just see where they all are in your area that I’ve collected instead of what’s just in the small radius of the mini-map
---
'dont tell anybody about this'
---
Five hundred upvotes later...
---
Jupp. Last time I was in Stv i encountered maybe 2 allys in total. And 20+ hordes
---
As a warlock Eranikus never killed me :-) He drops aggro on tank so goes on me ,but i just kite him then when he catches me just pop hs/hp potion drain life and with healer he was never able to kill me .Even when i was 51 (4 lvl less then him) i tank him for a bit and survive
---
Ive never experienced that. And enchancement is fully viable in raids.
---
It's sad how incredibly one-sided this bug makes a PvP matchup against a hunter.
---
You have to train ranks 1-3 first using your beast mastery icon before it will be usable
---
I definitely understand your point of view, I just think it goes against sportsmanship, fair play, and fair equity. I can’t change other people’s behaviors but I can choose the people I group with.
---
Allright, pretty solid arguments there mate. I didn't know about the frostdmg proc interruping Scatter Shot. Nice.
---
Personally I still wouldn't call it garbage, and I'm enjoying the hell of it :).
---
Peace.
---
Well except in raid
---
A bio break is like, getting up to go the bathroom, grab a drink, grab a snack, etc.  You know, satisfy your biological needs.
---
You've always been able to toggle heroic strike off. Since the very beginning of the game. Either with macros or just by hitting escape. If you're gonna call this a bug, do it on the basis of it being a mainhand ability affecting an offhand auto attack. A modern macro system has nothing to do with it.
---
It's already trained to the pet. The pet is clearly using it. But it is not on the pet bar, so I can't turn it off (for instances and pvp).
---
In fact we tried to switch aggro to the dps once ( a rogue ) so that if he deep-sleeps the first time the tank is up and can immediately grab aggro again. Worked really well actually.
---
I'm a ret pally, used ravage from level 37 to 56 to which I finally won princess scepter. Still have ravager my bags with a macro to swap to it on  big aoe pulls......though it loves to proc at weird times
---
Mages are the new hunters.  The evidence just keeps piling up.
---
50+ runs so far and never seen either of them even drop. Feelsbadman
---
Did you manually add the rank 4 button from the pet tab in your spell book?
---
A shame you didnt have a priest friend handy to sneak up from behind and MC them into the hole right next to you.  That would have been great.  Lol
---
5% for pvp, 9% for pve if you haven't got +5 weaponskill from either your racial or your talent tree. If you have +5 or more weaponskill, you need 6% hit.
---
Until life?
---
PvP tournaments only post cata?  Orangenmarmelade? Prime hydra rmp?
---
Correct!  It refers to any "biological necessities" so includes the restroom as well as grabbing a drink/snack, taking meds, or whatever else one may require.
---
From the East coast of the United States.  We use "bio break" in work/corporate settings as well.  I.e., if there's a long meeting they will announce a "bio break" after every  two hours or so.
---
 So I finally got to pick up my number 700 &amp; wanted to share some more information.  
---
My part 1: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbj1ZJtZNGs&amp;t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbj1ZJtZNGs&amp;t)  with all the black lotus locations
---
Fuck do I know or care  I just play My game
---
Kodo is amazing hey!I like the horses as well
---
Best mount, go horsie! Sarah's guildies are very proud, and also relieved that finally xp start coming in again :P
---
Honestly, the problem is a lot of people play rogue. You're going to want to get into a guild to get a raid slot most likely.
---
There's no transfer available to your main?
---
you never regen mana at 60, dont have enough time.the rest is right.
---
To make you feel better its still a very very low chance %.Farmed instances yesterday including BRD we disnt see a single drop
---
Thats a different quest mate
---
Lol this was funny..sad u didnt survived!
---
I’m about to join the subscription, which server is best to join or does it not matter? I’m a casual gamer but plan to really get into it too. My first time playing! I don’t want to join a server if it’s known to be really hardcore and pro-filled if you know what I mean.
---
ive rolles a tank shaman against all odds, hit 60 this morning and already decked in most tank gear and bis, so far done lbrs and it was a breeze, scholo next!
---
No its 50+ level mobs always been
---
That would be awesome if you don't mind!
---
Damn even when we had only 1 on our side it was 200g, only time fee was 300 was when there was only 1 horde on the server that sold to us alliance
---
Question regarding weapon debuffs like Gutgore ripper's. Are these weapons viable in raids? Especially now that we have 16debuff cap?
---
Probably the person playing the game for fun does care about playing what they find fun.
---
I got it tonight after 90 runs.
---
I don't play a lock but my understanding is you can have them auto taunt. Either way, it seemed to work just fine for the lock in my group who did exactly that on that boss.
---
You should try to join a high population server, either RP, PvE, or PvP depending on what you like.  After that, it's what kind of guild you join which dictates the kind of people you're around.
---
i always get 21 energy lucky me i guess
---
Haha
---
Hope you didnt res him at the end.
---
1. Trying to picture what you mean, their health bars? Red generally means hostile and/or opposite faction. Yellow is neutral, if its a player of the opposite faction and you can't attack them it's because you're in their territory and they aren't marked for PvP. Blue, I'm trying to picture, I think I've seen this as party member's health bars (ctrl+V) but you could mean something different. 
---
2. The guards will attack you and any one else who participates, yes fear and any other CC (polymorph, etc) will turn the guards hostile. Reputation is only affected if you kill a guard.
---
* Light Blue: Your faction, not flagged for PvP
---
* Green: Your faction, flagged for PvP
---
* Dark Blue: Opposite faction, not flagged for PvP
---
* Yellow: Opposite faction, flagged for PvP
---
* Red: Opposite faction, both of you are flagged for PVP
---
Oh, most weaps with a slow attack speed, you should let your auto shot finish before casting an Aimed or Multi.
---
This is because the autos hit so hard, it's not worth interrupting them.
---
On faster weapons, you start to disregard it. Rhok is just on the line where it's not worth finishing the cast so you just mash the buttons to fire off that shit on cooldown.
---
Thinking the average player knows that the gloves they just rolled on are another class's BiS, or that they only have a 2.4% drop rate, and that they have another upgrade in another dungeon, is a dangerous assumption. A lot of players aren't raiders and don't know or care. Some don't even know what BiS means. Some are kids who are just playing because it's fun. They just see an upgrade and press need. It would be really cool if they let the priest roll on it, but you can't assume that everyone knows everything. This is the first time a lot of people are playing WoW, and the first time in 15 years for a lot of others. This stuff wasn't common knowledge back then like it is now.

---
No it doesn't. Undead Rogues are the original evil. Those are the people that make the character with the vision of making others miserable. And just because people have seen through it and take proactive measures doesn't give them any moral leeway.
---
That's the major perk of doing it on retail, honestly. It's a shame Classic doesn't have a trial system implemented.
---
really depends who you play with. I know for a fact that most players on my server/faction are utter shit, I have no idea why, but thats just how things are. If I'm going to tank for randoms I want a good reason to suffer through it otherwise I might as well just not play while I wait for my friends to come online.
---
I see it more as a public service. People who have no hope of getting a tank get a tank and the payment is just forfeiting a item if it happens to drop.
---
except everyone was whining about how essential spell batching is to the classic feel 1 year ago...
---
Its hillarious when a tank boe drops how the tanks demand nobody else roll need but when a dps boe drops you're the first to say "all need" or just smash the need button. 
---
Need all, the group should have a shot at winning it just like you. They get the same benefit you do from winning it. Wether it be through buying upgrades or consumables.
---
I hate all the low effort memes in this place, but this is a high potassium meme.
---
No, not right now. Got my recipe about ~2weeks into servers and have sold maybe 5 since then for 1-2gp. People are still too miserly about spending good on vanity items.
---
One would assume they picked a druid to play a druid.
---
Bring horde mage and arcane explosion lol
---
what addon are you using?
---
I became the healer of my group while the holy priest could aoe with novas.
---
Can I please get some advice on where to solo farm at level 52 as an aoe mage? Please PM me.
---
This what I don’t get about Warriors who only want to DPS. Players really appreciate good tanks- people will practically beg you to join their groups (instead of fighting for slots), you don’t have to fight over gear too much really, and you just have the ability to offer something really valuable that everyone needs. It’s like turning down a chance at being royalty.
---
Has any non-warrior ever taken up blacksmithing 🤔 It might as well be like the special Rogue professions, it's such a perfect fit and adds so much to the class fantasy I imagine the demographics is at least 50% warrior
---
Not knocking because I also main druid but trust me the being better than warriors will fall off quickly. However druid is way more fun to play than warrior... sooo
---
Pretty hard for some classes to find a somewhat good guild ,as a hunter I'm in search for a good guild since a few weeks but every somewhat competitive guild already has 3 and cant get 1-2 more ,and joining a guild that still wipes at domo/rag is a no go. Luckily on my realm gehannas there are quiet a few good pugs where not everything and there mother is reserved
---
Perfect. Thanks
---
If you're in a neutral area where there are guards and in a spot where the guards physically cannot reach you, it's bannable.
---
That is true but mage blade is still extremely sought after, if they're following BiS lists they won't simply take a Sorcerous Dagger as a replacement
---
Been there my friend, road is tough but very rewarding. Good luck with the new one!
---
Lol, "sadly."
---
Or, you know, because Undead Rogues look cool as fuck.
---
You can tank just fine with leather and mail as long as you have a decent shield and Def Stance.
---
I hear the pattern only has a 0.01% world drop rate.
---
The only difference I can personally say I've seen between factions is likeliness to help counter a gank. 
---
At least on Alliance if I ask for help I'm usually getting the "imagine complaining about PvP on a PvP server lul" response, where it seems like if I gank a Horde player once or twice a level 60 or two answers the call to arms.
---
I will admit sometimes I will quasi reserve loot by just not inviting people who will take my pieces. That feels a lot less scummy though.
---
2. Great. Thanks
---
I really don’t get this. Why play the game if what is happening in the context of the game is meaningless? Is the enjoyment supposed to be derived from the button pressing?
---
Yeah, always funny when baby dps throw a fit and think you care about getting on their personal blacklist, as if we can't throw together a group in 30 seconds.
---
Lets start a petition to hang out in Thunder Bluff from now on instead of Orgrimmar
---
This
---
Who cares? It's a dungeon..
---
Happened on Pservers a lot. Don't know about vanilla or classic now though.
---
ZUG ZUG
---
Easy kill for lock.Not sure do they have frost resist increase cause they "water" creatures :-) .Some mobs like certain whelps do have high shadow resist
---
I am currently 3rd tank in our mc raids I was playing Resto our team only has one or Druid so have been passed a lot of Druid set pieces! As with anything just play what you find good it is only the hard core guilds speed running that really care about your spec being willing to Inverate healers and do the boring tasks like de-curse if will make you a valuable team member!
---
Agreed, they're called gnomes and NE Hunters
---
That is our mains
---
We had quiet big drama in the beginning where someone from a prominent guild (not apes) ninjas bindings to his rogue friend in a pug where it was reserved and he let everyone roll ,they got kicked from guild and made their own a while after
---
You can 2 man farm it with a feral tank with good gear. Done it for a Rogue 2 Warrs and an Enh Shammy.
---
Who said assault?
---
It doesn't matter anyways, the point is it is no achievement and the only thing you you get off to is to imagine how much you go on someone else's nerves. That is just anti-social on a highest level.
---
Also true in raid. Sometimes topped off leads to members not dying.
---
Bur mages do damage.. Shadow's have 2 things... Shadow weaving and pvp. For everything else they are useless.
---
Ooh, I might be a few minutes late but I'll have to give this a shot.
---
2. Thanks, I've read people doing some cc in ratchet so that people will miss the boat. Do they run away from the guards or is that a PVE server or?
---
Relevant.
---
private servers were ironically better at fixing bugs
---
You press heroic strike just after a swing, and then cancel it right before next swing.
---
Does /sit activate talents?  
---
I get the crit but I don't receive the free casting...
---
Paladins?
---
If you read my post you’d see that I’m not looking to level, I just want a way to make gold while I’m waiting and I am open to suggestions, I just mentioned zf graves as it’s what I’ve been seeing on other posts.
---
Because its possible it doesn't mean it's cool or has to be a part. Ninja items is also possible. Still not cool.
---
I've always been in the mindset of if they don't patch it to prevent it, it should be fair game. How can you hold the player accountable for an easy exploit in the game they manage.
---
It happened in vanilla too, I do think it was patched at some point tho.
---
"Viper Sting - This spell can no longer be used on warrior and rogue targets. In addition, while it can be used on a druid target at any time it will only drain mana when the druid is in caster form."
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.4.0
---
Why would you ever do that
---
Everyone I've heard of have been given a warning first, been multiple posts about it on Reddit. Doubt Blizzard would suddenly start banning right away since it's still not common knowledge that it isn't allowed.
---
/equipslot 16 &lt;name of weapon&gt;
---
/equipslot 17 &lt;name of shield&gt;
---
&gt;when tanking is basically just DPSing but with different buttons  
---
healing is basically just tanking but with different buttons with this retarded logic.
---
Imagine thinking people actually really hate videogame characters and it affects their daily lives. And on top imagine being offended by it and wanting to double down on being an asshole as a result.
---
That’s just consistent RP
---
Definitely a bug. It may sound unfair, but druids should regain mana during shapeshift while being immune to mana drain. This is how it worked during prebc, tbc, and wotlk.
---
Why not just level then worry about gold. You have to level anyway, you are just waisting time trying to do it in the opposite order.
---
Guess that depends if bandages sell that well.   Runecloth goes like candy.  And it sells for more than you mention on the majority of wow classic servers.  1.3 to 1.5g per 20 on atiesh.  
---
Furthermore it takes 2 cloth per heavy bandage, so at the prices you mention if they are actually the going rate on your server, thats a  40s profit margin every 40 runecloth.  And if they dont sell as consistently you have the potential for loss of ah deposit eating away your profit.  Whereas at least on atiesh runecloth goes so quickly, you can purposely price yourself above the cheapest going rate and still watch it get bought often within an hour. T
---
Or a raptor or a mexhanic bird
---
Can you equip four quivers and get all the ranged attack bonuses, or is it just the highest one? Or can you not equip more than one?
---
Usually what happens if you open just before an energy tick is that the server thinks you opened late, but then you get 40 energy on the subsequent tick. 
---
That's what I've experienced when just grinding Tyr's Hand and timing openers a bit.
---
I am using ElvUI. Font name for chat is Vixar
---
Are we talking about a 60 mage solofarming?
---
It has been since release
---
You'd be surprised on some servers.  For some reason, the people on my server in vanilla didn't think about shirts a whole lot - there weren't a lot on the AH.  I was able to corner the market, though, and buy the small number of shirts other people posted and jack the prices up to 1g+ for linen shirts.  It was a bizarre time for the economy on Lothar.
---
Humans are garbage creatures...
---
Don't do 2 hunters or 2 mages. You will be only marginally faster than alone cause you kill things faster than they respawn but you still have to drink gallons!  
---
The absolute best combo is lock and Priest. The locks deals the hurt and taps taps taps his life away while the priest dots and heals the lock/pet.
---
oh true, but id really prefer not to have to make a 2nd account. whats the other sneaky way? appreciate the help
---
Seems like someone was watching the Dueling tourny yesterday.
---
That's retarded. I would have followed broken tooth for hours camping anyone trying to tame.
---
Until a horde hunter came, then I kill it for the greens.
---
Their debuffs get pushed off by more important ones, so even if your raid reaches the 16 slot cap, you won't be occupying one of them.
---
currently, yes. 
---
you wont be able to have unoptimized raids in AQ40 and Naxx. Molten core was created to be cleared with dungeon blues and quest greens, it's supposed to be easy.
---
absolutely not but you do you
---
That happens yes, but it's not what's being talked about here.
---
Retail bad!! XD! Not MY Warcraft experience !
---
This correct. Blizzard has stated that in case of tie there will be second hidden roll to find out who wins item.
---
LMAO wtf that was great dude please make more
---
This is me on Yojamba. An OCE server... with no RPPVP server. D: 
---
LF Guild, Ally, Aus time zone.
---
it's a pve server...
---
Yes this. It’s more about kiting and connecting with weapon swing timer. If you could pvp like ur fighting a pve target i would agree fury&gt;ms. But that’s not the case
---
Yeah well of course anything here could be photshopped. But this is not. I don't have reasons to make fake things for free internet points.
---
It’s a specific color that’s rare, Hyacinth Macaw
---
Yea
---
Quality.
---
As I’m waiting for my brother so we can enjoy the game together instead of racing to 60
---
It's why I leave groups as a tank warrior when a dps warrior gets invited. He can tank aswel. No need for us both to be in the same run.
---
Ignore and move on, my friend, those kinda people are why my ignore list is so full.
---
Armchair philosophy is bullshit, go read why bullies bully. It's a extreme comparison but it works. You're totally allowed to do this on pvp severs, doesn't make you any less of an asshole though.
---
why pvp server then? its literally what you signed up for.
---
Hell, I would've been fine with you having it for mere vanity over a shard. Shards are easily farmable. He was an ass, and good luck to him in the future if he treats people like that.
---
Don't let him get you down. As for the chest itself, it may not be BiS, but its not awful. I'm still using the Deathdealer Breastplate from BRD, since I haven't managed to farm Savage Gladiator yet. You may want to look it up, its far more common (3 places it can drop), and is not significantly worse than Savage Gladiator.
---
Mage
---
I doubt you’re sitting on 3 Hyacinth Macaws. They are very rare and also is an epic quality companion.
---
&gt;I've always been in the mindset of if they don't patch it to prevent it, it should be fair game.
---
Agreed, although this is a bit iffy in the #nochanges classic experience.
---
&gt;It happened in vanilla too, I do think it was patched at some point tho.
---
Never was patched iirc and they definitely banned for it. Depended a lot on the gm though, some would just port you down.
---
aka cooking bananas
---
Farms in WPL. Questing there yesterday and saw 4 or 5 mages AOEing the undead at the various farms.
---
Because we’re hunted all over Azeroth,  but report these cheating fuckers. Gnomes have enough honour to stab you face to face.
---
What class of ranged weapons are best for pve leveling?
---
21 can reset your energy to a x0 or x5 amount if you got parried or missed prior and now have x9 or x4 energy.
---
And undead rogues and mages
---
It's a undead lol. Undead gnome?
---
lol, I always stop when I have 10 lotus, I admire your work ethos
---
Except in the duel tourney just the other day viper sting didn't drain mana a single time that druids were in form. 
---
So if anything it might make the match up one sided.
---
If you're in a group you gonna need to banana split
---
Soft
---
ok I will go back there. last time I was there I kept getting owned by all the ally mages. way too many people
---
You can VPN your way in.
---
Right? It’s an iconic item. They even made a heirloom out of it. 
---
People used to go ape shit back in vanilla when it dropped before all the knowledge and theorycrafting came out to crunch stats. But now that all of that is out in the open it opens up that elitist behavior over a 15 year old game that’s pretty easy to begin with. Lol
---
Yup!
---
So, I guess you would never, ever play something like Tomb Raider, Nier, Horizon: Zero Dawn and all those other great games, just because you would have to play as a woman?
---
That's pretty damn sexist and dumb. Your whole attitude in this thread is sexist and dumb. Gratz.
---
They said it would be released wit hthe first patch (not necessarily phase 2, probably sooner)
---
I mean there is like 0,5% crit on it in form of agility. It’s not that bad
---
And since the good vpns, at least the ones I know of cost money. And making a secondary discord is free.
---
Agreed, but that'll only be true later. Previous comment was using present form.
---
Depends on the server, bleeding hollow was horde sided. And i know this 100% because we rerolled from horde to alliance for better queue times.
---
Wow
---
Banned over that? How pathetic.
---
Best of both worlds.  AOEing and protecting your turf from enemy players :)
---
I'm a hunter and I support this message
---
The thing is that I have ok gear healing for my lvl and will build up more healing gears, sure it's there choice but I am doing good healing and almost never have failed to keep people alive (some cases happens for example people aggro pulling the aoe silencing dinosaurs in Mara and I can't heal for 8 seconds) but normal runs I do more than fine and keep all att 100% so I don't know how more dedicated I can be...
---
Idiots gonna idiot 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Isn't there an item that increases int and decreases spirit?
---
Start in Stormwind.
---
I have a ravager... Why haven't I thought of lifesteal? This changes everything!
---
Where are people in tanaris gonna go to "just quest a little" if you get "harmless" griefed like this. You literally have to travel for 15min + to get to a different appropriate zone. Dude you are just an asshole, grow up.
---
Even worse, he drives a Ford and actually seems *proud* of it.
---
No, no you don't get it. You are convincing him to become an UD Rogue just to grief people. 
---
Though someone like him already has one no doubt and he is just upset someone said something about his favourite class/race combo.
---
Then you're doing something wrong. 
---
Druids works okay for casual guilds but the buff cap means druids cant even Regrowth on the tank thus they are the worst healers by far.
---
Do you have a guild that is raiding already?
---
question: does the ravager proc seals?
---
How do you pull all 3 at once? Is the risk of nova resistnot too high / damage after ib too high?
---
Because bugs aren't always as easy to fix as reddit thinks?
---
That last line was absolutely chilling! I wouldn’t be surprised if one day people ran the instance in the future and you’re there roaming the streets mindlessly killing undead. Trapped forever in the city that needs no sleep...
---
For that legion of rogues mages and warlocks it's not hard to understand that they don't want your arms dps in their group. It makes finding a tank so much harder then it has to because that shitty dps warrior is competing with the tank.
---
Whoooossshhhh
---
When you get a failed gather do you 'lose' any herb.
---
E.g. when fishing if I fish a node and get "you failed to catch" it counts as though I gathered it. So you could get 5 "failed to catch" messages and then the node disappears.
---
Does it work the same with herbs and mining?
---
You seem mad enough to me
---
I use ElvUI for most things.
---
Other than that of stuff you can see is Questie, Necrosis and FiveSecondRule.
---
They said it would be added with the 1st patch.  
---
Well, Dire Maul patch has come and gone and yet still no key-ring.
---
But dude... its &lt;Made by Lacoste&gt;
---
How you gonna turn that down?
---
Where in your ass did you pull that statistic from?
---
But it's Made by Lacoste
---
While still technically possible, frontstabbing is very rare in classic.

I'm having a really shitty time farming thorium. I'm at 285 bs and have really hit a brick wall. I've been to un'goro, winterspring, epl, and burning steppes with little success. Any advice to finding more thorium?

Ugly enough, you pass!

I never thought about not even bothering with expansions. Let's keep rolling out these phases.

How is the pvp on bloodsail? I want a heavy rp server but it’s disapointing that it’s not pvp. I’m also playing from Australia so it needs to have good nightlife from the Americans
---
I agree, as i was close to 3 elites!
---
I would call losing 15min to be quite harmless, yes.
---
&gt;Dude you are just an asshole, grow up.
---
Yikes way to assume. I've never evadebugged goblins *in my life*. I'm waaaaaay too much of an ah-goblin to waste my time ganking lowbies.
---
Is this really true? Based on me just looking at the tooltips ALL spells become more efficient om higher ranks unless you have lots of +healing.
---
What are the dpm for THE different ranks of healing touch?
---
Judgement or marky guide I found
---
Or you could use Azeroth auto pilot
---
You know, normally I'm not into this "Cut off my nose to spite my face" kind of vengeance, but this would be a painful bit of blowback to the stronger faction for "farming" the weaker faction into obscurity.
---
One potential blowback I see is the use of the neutral auction house to transfer the material turn ins from the stronger to the weaker faction. If the weaker faction is entirely united (no outsiders who will participate regardless) this would force people to purchase additional subscriptions. This would, in the end, siphon gold out of the stronger side at the very least.

That's Mt. Taranaki in New Zealand. It's not a crater, the perfect circle is the boundary of a national park.

Well shamans is different, you at least doing your normal rotation and siince your dmg sucks anyways you feel usefull.
---
A Hunter spamming Wing cllip is bis for uptime, but Boring as hell and you literally not even playing your class anymore (and doiing 0dps)
---
Similar for shadow weave healers, you have a spec thatss only usefull for raids and won't enjoy brother healing more dpsing.
---
Man, I haven't seen this video in a long time. While in Iraq my battalion Sergeant Major would play the power thirst video during briefs because people were bitching the chow hall was trying to restrict how many rip its we could take out.
---
Have you ever played with them? because its all totally from your perspective which I understand but just because you know you can heal doesnt mean they know or do they want or have to risk going to the dungeon to find out you cannot heal then have to replace you.
---
such as crossfaction gold moving, griefing, paid boosting, too effective gold making which can used in gold selling, etc.
---
I'd never super big conglomerates like Momcorp.
---
2h fury is good then respec dw at max level but if u plan on doing any tanking on the way i would encourage you to go arms for the talent 'tactical mastery'
---
&gt;not some joke for bored white kids.
---
That right there is part of the reason why most of the outrage mob in regards to racism are a bunch of hypocrites.
---
Can confirm
---
you dont need to spec dw as fury till max level
---
The war effort is only partly player based.
---
Crap I sold the recipe for 5g...
---
I should say the ones that had massive advertisements across Youtube and what not was post cata. before that was just blizzard lan tournaments.
---
As the gentleman above me has highlighted, such a tank can be extremely dangerous to have, especially if he has also been given an officer position.
---
Same with warrior, eventually I specced tank tho :')
---
You misspelled undead.
---
Did you see the picture in this post? Is that a gnome or nelf griefing?
---
Have a hard time believing that the way you defend griefing. I get world pvp is fun and all, but this is not it.
---
On Fairbanks, we have a group of friends that are owners of lfg and world and they sometimes put passwords on the chat and if you ask em about it they will say idk about any password, all I know is that there’s a riddle. I mean it annoys the fuck out of ao many people but it’s funny to me lol
---
What does the gnome say?!
---
Ring-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding!
---
Gering-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding!
---
Imagine thinking rolling a 1 funny enough for a rofl.
---
This is why dumb people are immune to depression
---
Azeroth auto pilote or Dungeon grind if on a pvp realm
---
Zardoz!
---
Or spend the gold on an actually good item in Lionheart.
---
Does Judgement guide work well with guidelime? Seeing many people complain on curse.
---
It's conjecture on my part. Yes it probably would be exploitable, but you'd have to modify your client which is a banable.
---
If you tried to sync client and server at all time it would feel unresponsive, especialy if you consider that 15 years ago latancy was a lot worse. Having a parried backstab once in a while is a lot less worse than being phyicaly behind the enemy on your screen but being unable to use your ablity.
---
Well I mean, Broken Tooth is only outstanding from other pets in PvP vs casters, it is in their best interest to not let allies to get the pet and use it against their comrades.
---
That percent rate doesn't have much to do with how long you farm.
---
Could drop first kill.
---
how is pvp half of the games content?
---
As a rogue, I just stealth an pickpocket the whole pull before starting DPS. Gonna be pulling mad threat anyways, so delaying by a few seconds is a favor to the tank and also nets me some sweet cash.
---
Try it out for yourself and see.
---
Isn’t the biggest problem with shadow priest that they will be rolling on gear that a healing priest would want, which will piss off your healer and make them find a new group. Or in a raid, you won’t ever get priority over the healers.
---
Is the macro bound to a mouse button? That would be why. I forget the reason exactly why mouse 3/4/5 interact this way while over frames.

The 29 agi pr is for lvl 60 ! Agi is much more potent dodge and critwise for lower lvls!

Fury tanking is mainly for funsies.
---
It still baffles me that people don't know this over 15 years after its release. I mean, it's a pretty famous place.
---
I really wish there were a better way blizzard could implement a tool for fining groups. I understand its classics and nothing should change but this aspect of the game is really tedious and not fun at all, it doesn't add anything but frustration to the game.
---
Is this some kind of peasent joke that I'm too Two-Monitor to understand?
---
I think it depends.  I sometimes encourage it, and have them kill me like 20 times in a row while I'm cooking or whatever.  I imagine that could make it a steeper penalty.
---
lol comparing ninjaing items to ganking. thats not comparable dude.
---
Ganking is super fun and im very glad its part of the game.
---
I don't think so, the macro will get to revenge, and stop if it can't do it.
---
The best you could do would be some form of cast sequence macro which casts revenge on the first press, and sunder on the second press, and then spam it.
---
Replying to save
---
I know... The post was meant as a joke :D
---
oh sorry i should have said "for me" ofc in general it's fine, but i come from a background where i raided top200-500 in retail, and on top of that in classic i would like to stay in 1 guild for longer than 1 raid-tier, and if they can't easily clear mc after a few weeks i see dark for bwl etc.
---
Skeram?
---
Alliance literally do this shit too. Stop acting like it’s a one sided thing.
---
Well they can enjoy their queue times for rolling easy street
---
Why try and tell someone else how they should play?
---
Pretty stupid of that mage, OP had literally nothing to loose: it"s either free port, or just finding another mage.
---
It used to in an earlier patch, it was aided by paladins for Reckoning Bombing, but it's not in this patch.
---
That will still leave you out of form if you press it on GCD.
---
The end of Dire Maul East usually has two rich thorium nodes
---
Enjoy the mana burn in scholo upper floors!
---
So? you can screenshot on a tablet.
---
He's trying to do a grind that is for a semi-geared 60.... Logic would dictate to hit 60 to do it.
---
Seems you can't read.  As I have said a twice now in this thread, they left because of 6-10k queues when Wrath hit.  Both sides couldn't raid effectively because of these queues (caused by people transferring TO our server for PVP because of the faction balance being so good).
---
Don't comment on things you have no understanding of.
---
Any 2.5+ weapon speed bow/gun/xbow. They generally give high top end damage, great if you spec Aimed Shot but still good for BM spec. And the most underrated point in my opinion is they use lesser ammo/arrow which saves you money &amp; time.
---
The exp is coming, I promise!
---
In DnD when you go to 0 HP, you have to make a “saving throw” to try and stay alive. Rolling a 1 is a critical failure, resulting in losing 2 of your 3 chances. It essentially means death. I’m assuming that’s what he’s referring to.
---
Cause its funny
---
Also that.
---
I went into Skull Rock last night and got all the way to the back before I found a single Burning Blade to kill, but once I did, I had to try and fight 41 of them to get out.  It didn't go well.
---
DM:Est you get 2-3 rich thorium in the tunnel at the end. You can do drop runs with 2 to 4 players depending on gear and comp.
---
I think you can equip as many as you want, but it only uses the speed of whichever bag has the one 'stack' of ammo thats in the slot on your character page.
---
Gz gz! Gonna last you a really long time. I'm stuck with demonshear still
---
Didn't feel like revealing my name. I'm gonna upvote you though. Have a nice day.
---
Came here for this. I'm horde on Thunderfury. ;)
---
Sounds cool
---
It’s a meme class to those that are deeply knowledgeable in the game and played pretty much every class and they have specific things that they focus in game like PvP etc.
---
As a new player of WoW i don’t think that you ll ever realize why people call paladin a meme class so go for the class you feel that you will enjoy the most, if it’s paladin and then you should play a paladin.
---
You're right.  I've reported a lot of people for exactly this, and never seen any sort of reply.
---
60 I think.
---
paladins are fun. just be aware that at lvl 60 you will most likely have to spec for healing and heal. Its possible to to lvl 60 stuff as dps or tank, but most people would not want you as anything else than a healer for harder content.
---
How would I go about finding a guild? 
---
I’m currently on NethergardeKeepe EU (PVE because I’m new to WoW) and all of the guilds advertising in major cities are just full of people that leave after a couple of hours/days and have no real dedication to the guild 
---
( I’m level 31 )
---
Same here, lots of years as horde, but rolled alliance together with a friend because other IRL friends rolled alliance. They're not playing anymore so if faction changes become a thing we might both switch. It's fun seeing the other side for once but I would love to be an undead again.
---
Were the conditions of loot made known before you grouped? If so yes, if not, flip shit and/or leave.
---
Let's be honest very little, if any, prebis gear is needed for ZF Farm. You want int and stam.
---
I'm not sure you know what a crater is...
---
ITT: Every race/class combo except mine is evil and KoS.
---
Unless you like healing i highly suggest you don't. You will be forced to heal endgame and instances or just not go. Currently on my server i know of no guilds taking prot/ret paladins holy only for raids. They can tank well and dps 5 man instances fine though.
---
Its so funny the things people say to feel better about themselves lol
---
No. It just makes you have to click again.
---
Try making your own group and don’t take anyone that needs HoJ too
---
I used Guidelime for a bit and then tried Zygor, and honestly, Zygor feels so much better to level with.
---
If you don't want to pay the monthly cost then Google around for a download link.
---
I’m actually in a top raiding guild and not even we do this. It’s the easiest way to kill you own guild. It’s good to have hardcore players for your core team, but you also need casuals just hanging out and having a good time.
---
I know in Gadgetzan it's possible to gain enough rep that the guards will not attack you.  I'm not sure it's the same in Winterspring, but imagine it must be.  I wonder if that's an extra benefit of grinding the rep for their mount.  I'm horde, so I honestly don't know much about it.
---
&gt; My buddy: /roll 1000 - Person A rolls 315 (315-1000)
---
You meant 1-100 in the brackets here, right?
---
I’m in Netherwind and I’ve had overall positive experiences with other players. Super nice people and friendly guilds to help you with leveling. Not sure how it is on other servers though.
---
Make an alt and send it to him. No need for running then
---
Reputation grinding? Farming raid materials? Wpvp? 
---
Once battlegrounds are released you will have some fun with that too. Oh yeah, gotta rep grind those too!
---

---
Horde have it pretty easy with the barrens being available for so long, but after you leave the barrens it will be like how it is for the rest of the game and how it is for alliance period. 
---
When a zone says 10-20, that doesn't mean you can do all 10-20 levels there. That is just the range of available quests. For most zones, you will do a couple of quests at like 12-13, 15-16, and maybe 19-20. For the other levels, you need to go to other zones. It sounds like this is your problem. As a 26, you do have options like stonetalon mountains and ashenvale. 
---
And also, it does sound like you need questie, which will show you all available quests so you have a better idea of where you need to go. It's just a fact of the game that it doesn't automatically guide you to where you can go a lot of the time. If you don't enjoy that, then I don't understand why you are trying to "play the game as it's intended to be played". You are going to end up burning yourself out. If you can't compromise and also can't deal with how it works, unfortunately classic wow just may not be for you.
---
Just saying if you are giving gear put inefficient it’s a waste of time.
---
Roll on things good for you.
---
Oh shit, I've actually seen that guy running around. He was wearing a purple shirt though, so you can't trust him.
---
Yea I’d say hunters have the highest skill sealing in the game, especially for world PvP
---
1. You have a dead zone
---
2. You will need a lot of macros
---
3. You need to kite
---
I’d say a skilled hunter can 1 v 1 any class if they get their traps off 
---
Only mages give me problems... hate blink/frost nova.
---
Yup.  There's a slider in the graphics setting page that lets you adjust view distance.
---
Most don’t, a few do. They played when they were young but now they have “lives”
---
*I think you got the wrong door the leather club's two blocks down*
---
Yet it somehow makes me laugh anyway.
---
What's the best dagger Rogue pvp build?
---
&gt; just because they didnt doesnt make them wrong
---
No, but the implication that offspecs aren't suitable for healing BRD and that the group member was wrong for telling the leader to invite him to heal as feral definitely makes them wrong.
---
Something like this? https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/5002311305051-20505003230005/0AEDHgf1CEHKJqqqAqq0KNp
---
HOLD STILL BITCH
---
&gt;I linked my current chest, [Valor] was a lot better than what I had
---
Case closed... upgrade, if a minimal one.
---
/say Greetings, peasants.
---
Depends if the pet is hot. UwU
---
I went with gehennas, thx
---
Really cool!
---
Good point! I will run Stratholm tho. Knowing my luck I'll probably get the mount within 2 or 3 runs
---
Lmfao "no idea how class plays or works let me proceed to theory craft it...." oh this reddit is a great laugh. These kinda post or people bragging they got 12 days played and are only lvl 40 b.c they never rushed and ruined their game *eye roll*
---
It's environmental detail
---
So just another join another guild maybe?
---
Erm. Usually people do it the other way around? Grind night elf mount as a human :)
---
How do you give him the possibility of fearing you? His fear should go on your pet while you just run away.
---
Mount, you'll make gold to buy items through farming other  preraid bis.
---
What they should do 
---
Is take two servers that are 
---
70/30
---
30/70
---
And then make them 
---
70/70
---
30/30
---
I mean sure your bending everyone over between overpopulation and underpopulation but it would be a great taste if medicine.
---
Well yeah. But he wont replace BiS gear untill the next raid hits. Which is months from now. He'll have plenty of time to get a mount untill then.
---
Looking for equip, cast, equip macro on a Mage for Evocation.  I can get the equip, cast part to work. But the final equip doesnt.
---
Mostly there's a stigma you have to heal, which simply isn't true. Then again if you dont like being told how to play id recommend finding a good server for that sort of thing. Pretty much everyone will try to tell you how to play, what to play  or what not to play. Paladin is extremely flexible, highly survivable and easy to learn. I think youd have a good time playing one. The only thing you simply cannot do is ranged damage. If you have any attraction to distance fighting paladin just dont have the kit for it. You could also take a look into druid as they can actually do anything. Tank, heal, melee dps, or magic ranged dps. Being a druid is like rolling every major class and role at the same time.
---
Usually tanks are those who roll for stam gear and yes that’s not even good for dps you better farm atleast BRD for the blue and epic chest with 2 % crit 
---
But there is always drama about the battlegear set anyway coz everyone want it for pvp
---
There are a lot of wannabe tryhards who think BiS items are the only items that matter. They're too dumb to see otherwise and are really insucure as a result. They look for any opportunity to bully someone over dumb shit. If it's an upgrade, go for it. Valor is literally a warrior set.
---
Fishing is basically tanking but with different buttons.
---
No. What is funny is that the rules of the roll weren't set yet and he rolled 1 which is a loss in both death roll and normal roll
---
Undead rogues are Kill on sight,  they tend to be little pricks who only fight you when you’re eating or fighting mobs,  they just come off as the lowest of the low and it’s always a pleasure saccing my VW then wrecking their shit.
---
Yeah pretty much! You can move a few things around on how you feel, I like holy nova for farming stuff, and went for the threat talent instead of Imp PW:Shield.
---
Its better the moment you reach the yellow hitcap.
---
I got it on my first run in brd as a tank bc nobody needed it.
---
I've been in the raid team since day 1. Always bring consumables, enchanted gear, pre-raid bis farmed, always on time. I perform often better on dps charts and on logs than the two orc warriors. 
---
I'm considering at the moment to just reroll to another class / race and start over. If this is going to be my experience in raiding of getting gimped out of loot to players performing worse because they have a racial, then that just kills my mood entirely.
---
That's what it is supposed to be, the poster is pointing out people ignore it.
---
But that’s THE thing. You will replace it regardless of when that is. You’ll have to farm the gold for the mount regardless. Might as well use it for something that will last. But, his gold, his choice. There’s always differing opinions on this.
---
More like an episode of Scooby Doo.
---
I've fallen behind on my herbalism and now I can't pick herbs in the zone I'm in (level 39). Would it be worthwhile to run around at 40 once I get my mount to skill it back up or should I just keep levelling?
---
To be fair they're actually right. I healed a full BRD as shadow before I hit 60 and respecced healer. It worked, wasn't optimal, but it worked.
---
but distance is not the problem.. While hes i bubbled i cant disrupt his fear with anything other than FD and if thats on CD well im doomed because he will drian my life so quick and i cant do anything about it while he sits in his bubble
---
Currently a 43 shadow priest, and want to run Uldaman soon. Can I heal while spec'd shadow efficiently? im kind of a noob so not sure if i could pull it off (any tips appreciated!). I imagine i couldn't run as DPS due to mana issues but i do want to do this dungeon and i don't want to respec. Help!
---
Yes, the auto still completes, but by activating AS right before it goes off the attack becomes delayed, effectively lowering your DPS. Auto shot is your main damage source, that's why they need to go off cooldown.
---
I'll take the 150 bucks
---
Druids excel at killing mages. Have stealth (to pounce on and shred mages), dash, feline swiftness talent and travel form (to catch mages trying to blink away), can powershift out of frost slows/roots and are immune to polymorph 99% of the time.
---
it's not what i meant, i don't need to reduce even more (im at the minimum aynyway) the distance at which i see objects or details, i need to reduce the view distance like we can do on retail
---
&gt;if you are instance capped it does use hearthstone right?
---
You kite. You have a ranged slow.
---
&gt;I know how to generate threat
---
&gt;Reee warlock multidotting
---
Unless you're doing a LOS pull with 0 rage there's no reason for a single corruption, or worse agony, tick to rip from you even if cast immediately
---
Mount for sure bro
---
What macro doesn't....?
---
I'm leaning more towards mount atm. Truefaith Vestment I can get pretty quickly either way, but Hide of the Wild wouldn't be replaced for very long
---
Yea, do you really think people are going to leave an advantage for an unknown?
---
Not an excuse. You can crop images with any image editing software. If your tablet is iOS or Android you can crop the ss when you take it.
---
They're mostly taken for healing. The levelling isn't very engaging sadly; it's mostly autoattacks. If you're wanting to do raids (the end game in PvE) you'll have difficulties finding a spot if you're not a Healer. Not impossible, just improbable.
---
West is really easy with a skip run, dont even need to kill much.
---
I've noticed all tanks are gigantic babies who hate playing their class.
---
You'll find more and more people that do. Back in the old days, I didn't know threat meters didn't work for everyone because everyone used them, but they went out of favor in wrath when threat became a non-issue so people aren't used to them being automatically downloaded now.
---
But he is also ranged so what is the advantage of kitting ? hes not running towards me and i wanna fight him but i dont know how to because he counters everything i do
---
those spots are so over-farmed that nobody goes there any more
---
You have a longer range than him and a pet.
---
Theres a lot of gear you will never replace. Lionheart Helmet for example.
---
really? didn't checked, in Vanilla you had to go to each battleground to queue right.
---
ok I've double checked, didn't recall because i was always in the wild on a pvp server, so I've always queued directly for the Bg I was going to, but there was Battlemasters in Capital, I tought it came with TBC,, super...
---
Chromie came home with a list of names
---
Chromie sat down in the inn room
---
It's time for a few small repairs she said
---

---
There’s a few other reasons to downrank heals.
---
A critical greater heal is almost always massive overheal. The hate spike from greater can be problematic depending on what’s going on while two smaller heals are more spaced. 
---
Two smaller heals gives you a greater chance to prod inspiration meaning less heals total. 
---
Downranking costs you GCDs you could dps with (wand). Also, you spend longer casting which reduces your mp5. 
---
It’s a balance of the above. 
---
Flash heal, pwshield and renew are ALWAYS mana inefficient. They have their rolls but can tap you out quickly.
---
Classic for me is the first experience with WoW, so that’s all I know. Tanking can be frustrating sometimes, but it’s more fun than DPSing to me.
---
Broken tooth is a basic bitch pet anyway. So many hunters have it, making it uncool and not unique. 
---
Now Spiteflayer. Spiteflayer is cool af AND annoying as fuck to be attacked by.
---
The challenge is just numbers rather than mechanics though.  The first half of Mara was much more complex to tank first time round between worms spawning behind you from the pipes, the globs doing aoe damage, the oozes leaving degen on death.  BRD has the aoe room and nothing much else, even the Emperor has no mechanics at all that I had to think about unlike timing your berserker rage on the Mara Princess.
---
I'm pretty disappointed with my PVP server. My entire time leveling I was never attacked by any alliance that wasn't at least 4 levels higher than me. Now that I've reached lvl 57+ the only time I'm attacked is outside BRD where it's pretty much a 24x7 clusterf of MC raids fighting with groups trying to do the dungeon.
---
Going back I'd likely have just picked PvE and saved myself the bother. I've been in exactly one decent fight the entire time I've played. #notworth

Why don’t we just Xserver everything while we are at it? 
---
Let’s go back to retail
---
It’s all or nothing. 
---
I’m saying at least give unbalanced servers the option to move to a more balanced one.
---
If you want to stroke your ego on a 30/70 go ahead but you’ll pay for it in BGs
---
I bought the mount after Lion Heart helmet and my other BiS weapons and I just regret it.
---
I could have used the money to prep my raiding bank, get PvP gear/enchants etc.
---
Especially now you do not want to buy the mount, prices are going up (and will even more so with P2/3 releasing). Mount cost is static and will not change.
---
Invest wisely.
---
The fuck do you mean "a good time", you're not allowed to have fun in this game. Chump.
---
Either by encountering people you get along with when leveling/doing dungeons, or through advertisements. There's dedicated threads to this on the WoW forums and the WoW discord.
---
yeah but i have 200 curses and debuffs on me no matter how far i am from him and when i try do my most dps he ofcause just bubbles and while hes in a bubble my life has already been drained like 70% and shortly after that im dead.. that happend 4 times in a row and i cant figure what im doing wrong.. Yes he was very good at pvp so im just trying to figure out what i can do the next time i get in that situation
---
Yeah lol
---
I’ve outfitted about 8 warlocks/mages with that sash
---
I probably did im trying to figure out what i can do better
---
\#showtooltip Consecration
---
/cast \[mod:shift\] Consecration(rank 1) ; Consecration(rank 4)

Casts Consecration on normal press or with shift casts rank 1.

this is for 1.0 version

\#showtooltip

/cast Seal of Righteousness
---
Replace Righteous with all of your seals. One for each seal.
---
/cast Hammer of Wrath
---
Mount for sure
---
/cast \[@mouseover,exists\]Cleanse;Cleanse
---
Cleanse your target or cleanse your mouseover if you have one!
---
It isnt possible. If you tried to log into another computer while logged in on another it will disconnect you.
---
Douchebag alert!
---
You can also wall jump it.
---
im going to go out on a limb here and say this priest probably had decent +dmg gear which for that level can absolutely turn them into a walking god. That said you do have tools to help you! between mana drain , pet and your shots. Carry hp pots on you too!
---
alright... who got the gimp out of the truck..?
---
That’s account sharing which I believe is bannable? Also no because it isn’t possible.
---
You’re digging yourself into a hole here.
---
Are you really arguing that the Breastplate of valor is better off as a large brilliant shard than as an actual armor upgrade for a player?  Suppose he wears it for weeks while he farms BiS?
---
/castsequence reset=8 Judgement, Seal of Righteousness
---
Shows Judgement, when you cast it, it shows Seal of Righteousness (or any) you want.
---
After 8 seconds it resets back to judgement, if you are ret, change this to 7 seconds.
---
Perfect for seal twisting and not having multiple button presses.
---
I've tried to use feign death or scatter shot mid-fight to exit combat and put a trap down, but it doesn't work. Am I missing a step?
---
the biggest game changer for me was putting all my holy spells in a macro that has /cancelaura shadowform; in it.... ESPECIALLY DESPERATE PRAYER.. two key clicks and you're full health back in shadowform.
---
/cast Exorcism
---
Even if the mage is having to actively use all of those tools to stay alive, it still might be worth to heal them against a boss. It's a judgement call. If healing the mage instead of the tank means going oom before the fight is over, letting the mage die can be the right call.
---
I mean, put this in perspective. What did the mage lose by dying? A few silvers worth of repairs, that's it. There is literally no reason to get that upset, and I'm glad the OP posted this so I can laugh at them.
---
If u have some what of a skill and the tank knows what hes doing you can heal all available dungeons as shadow even at 60
---
Dwarf hunter, nelf rogue, human paladin, gnome lock - signs that u are an arse !
---
it can drop on the 1st run or your 1000th , just keep going you'll use that trinket for a very very long time.
---
There is no point in playing tamer or any pet class like that. You get little to no silver income that way, and level doesn't matter past 60 (which you can hit in a a day or two if you're being efficient.)
---
The only real way to progress in bdo is to either lifeskill for silver &amp; mats, or grind high value spots for silver. 
---
Gear progress are the only way to reach any power fantasies.
---
Cat auto attacks are also significantly faster/more dps
---
Are those the Retail high-res masks? They look more detailed than the actual human face.
---
It can be, but I believe it tells you, no? This video that shows it is pretty insane if you ask me, definitely looks bugged https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/video-of-the-vanish-bug/321409
---
What so you don't want x-realm BG just so the horde have to sit in queue forever?    
---
Because x-realm BGs will favor unbalanced servers if you thought about it for a second...    
---
The Horde PVP players won't be ganking you in the open world because they won't be sitting in queue for 2+ hours and you get to play with a balanced pool of different players who want to PVP instead of PVE?
---
You’re what’s wrong with classic right now.
---
The not a crater part?
---
GMs could appear in game, but they were never allowed to actually participate in stuff like BGs or fighting people. They might have been watching people but not joining in.
---
I use [Puggle](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/puggle), and by default it sounds off a ding when it finds a match. Puggle has made my ingame life much easier.
---
Ah I see you're one of those "no changes" people that don't seem to give a shit about all the changes that have already happened. There's literally no reason not to do xserver bgs besides drooling out "no ChAnGeS!1". People on the low pop side of a server will still be able to BG and then people on the high pop side will be able to too.
---
Why cater to the minority for no reason when it doesn't even hurt them having xserver BGs?
---
Dude. That’s awesome! I like fantasy maps but don’t actually draw them because my kids get all of my time now. 
---
I went to a work conference recently and my boss commented on how I was the only one in his region taking notes but I was actually drawing fantasy map stuff as that was one of the rare opportunities I could doodle on such for so long.
---
Contrary to what everyone else is saying, because I've been through it: It's not immediately bannable, you get a warning from a GM the first time you get reported for it.  After that it is a bannable offense.
---
Viable.  You sir are a meter whore moron.  Druid’s are the definition of viable.
---
Mages I'll give you, but really hard to argue undead rogues when we have photographic evidence of one doing God's work of stomping out a NE hunter while simultaneously denying them the BiS pet. The guys a hero.
---
That's what interests me as well. I've reported three people for doing this to me in Winterspring at the Pattern vendor. One guy did it to me on two separate occasions with almost a day between the events.
---
To be fair, after the first time he killed me, I started provoking him by standing on top of the vendor (apparently that bothered him because he doesn't have the *interact with target* action mapped, I guess) so that he would go kill me again, and that I could take proper screenshots of it.
---
Hope you're enjoying Blizzard jail, Immaculate.
---
I farmed it with two dudes who needed it, we all got it within 2hs
---
It is a one side thing. I have seen nothi g but horde do this. Its 90% horde. Horde scrub.
---
ok ty!
---
Going to have to watch this
---
Ofcourse this is going to be your experience, your playing in a guild with loot council where the leaders of the guild most likely know eachother irl or through playing before. 
---
I would NEVER join a guild with loot council, 90% of them will fuck anyone over that is a random to the council, DKP system / /roll or im out.
---
I’d get an addon that checks your range between your target.
---
I played a hunter awhile back and I can say the biggest reason I won most of my fights is because of that six yard range bonus.
---
It’s hilarious to watch a caster perform a cast and then you run backwards to watch his cast go mute. While you lay waste to him. If he starts running towards you kite him and keep the viper sting on him.
---
Looks loke Quartz to me
---
My guild has 4 bear tanks, and 2 or 3 warrior tanks. Your luck depends on the guild you're in. I will never get a chance to tank in my guild, which is why I'll be leaving it once I get to 60.
---
I dinged level 60 with zero skill in both crossbows and guns. Honestly there were very few times in the leveling process where I ever felt like I needed to switch from bows, there's just so many good ones available from all sources.
---
One thing I would recommend though is that at level 51 you buy a Heartseeking Crossbow from the AH if it's cheap on your server. It's a very good bow, is usually very cheap, and can last you until you get the PreBis bow (Carapace spine).
---
He cant fear you when hes not close to you. You are obv a noob in PvP, dont kid yourself, else you would know this and about your higher range and about your deadzone.
---
Jesus you dumbass get deathdealer from BRD or cadaverous from scholo.
---
Valor is terrible, and he’s a terrible player for even thinking it’s remotely useable at 60
---
Bis.  Those suggesting mount are foolish.  Enchants and such are far more important.  You should have mats for enchantments lined up for expected upgrades too.
---
ty
---
No no, you're just confusing undead with gnomes, honest mistake since they both look basically the same. And all I see is an absolute hero stomping out a NE hunter and denying them their BiS pet. Truly a man doing God's work
---
I just want to say that as a Tauren resto Druid the only time I have mana issues in 5/10 man content is when the tank is pulling when I have half mana or when DPS doesn’t wait for tank to build threat. In raids, hasn’t really been an issue so far in MC and 9/10 I use my innervate on priests. Druids just have a harder time covering up DPS/Tank mistakes.
---
*ducks to avoid the pummel of Druid hate coming his way*
---
just checked damage counters. Third player, and biggest troll who ninja'd a bow, was a shaman called "Vemenotrix".
---
Be careful out there boys.
---
A dedicated healer is nothing to do with spec. There's no effect on the success chance of the group whether your're 31 points feral or resto. My shaman is deep elemental but will heal fine until I respec full resto at 60. Levelling spec for levelling dungeons 👌🏻
---
You'll get significantly better performance if you use [DXVK](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk). Plays just as smoothly as on Windows for me, while Wine's built in DX11 performs pretty poorly.
---
Found the shitty dps
---
Thank you for putting effort into this explanation - much appreciated.
---
Found the other shitty dps
---
Your lvl 26 complaining.. download questie or you will most likely be smashing your computer by the time your 40+
---
I'd say get the mount, the difference between full swing bis all boe gear and just getting bop blues is negligible in 40 man raids. And your mount matters a ton more in the world for gathering, wpvp and pre raid questing.
---
Not only is he an idiot but he is also short-sighted.  
---
There are plenty items that aren't optimal but better than something else one might not have. It will never be possible to get all the best items for all members of a raid but often there's an alternate item that's way less contested even if it is worse. And even then collecting the D1 set merely for looks or nostalgia isn't a horrible thing either.  
---
He's short-sighted for completely disregarding D1 sets. For some classes the D2 sets - or the drops from the summonable bosses from the quest chain - will become very relevant for some classes/specs. To be able to progress the quest line (and do the summons) you need not just the piece(s) you want but most/all of the others as well.
---
Back when we were playing on private servers we once had a group of 3 or 4 people join our guild. They also refused to wear or farm anything other than their current BiS gear. ZG was out at the time so they even didn't bother for some preraid BiS pieces.  
---
They didn't last and never got raid spots.
---
No, an account can only be logged in one time, and if you did decide to log out and share so your friend could log in it’s a bannable offense.  I don’t know the geographical range on it, but they notice when you log out and then log back in 5 seconds later in a new location 500 miles away.
---
This.
---
Anyone suggesting mount doesn't sound like they've been there before.
---
About 140+ runs of arena -&gt; anger -&gt; vault.
---
false, i am a medium sized baby who loves playing his class
---
I Will keep that in mind. Thank you.
---
A classic example of an elitist jerkbag, they enjoy nothing more than hearing their own voice and can never admit defeat in an argument.
---
"Just go farm your pre-raid bis..."
---
Trust me I'd love to, but some people have a full-time job, family, friends and rl-responsibilities we can't neglect for a video game, and for that reason we're happy with any upgrade we can find.
---
Can i exit the game completely and still be ”logged in” aka not getting a queue?
---
man this is bs, back in the day it was way more crowded for leveling and world pvp was rife yet we all got to 60.
---
I along with a friend I was partied with escorted the dwarf once while he was carrying the flag. So I’ve always wondered what was going on or if for some weird chance someone got the &lt;&gt;symbols in their name when they created a character. As I said they were killable and I remember the horde killing the dwarf multiple times.
---
Your best bet at selling pets is the cross faction auction house
---
So you feel better by excluding more people?
---
I'm seeing many good advices in this thread already but in reality and all honesty you just have to accept that Hunter isn't that good in PvP in classic, probably only above Warrior while Shadow Priest and Warlock are objectively considered S tier. It's not a coincidence that these two classes win every single classic PvP tournament. As a Hunter you'll lose every time against a proper Shadow Priest just like a Warrior will lose every time against a proper Mage (or even a mediocre one honestly...)
---
So I'm going to be punished by having to transfer to a different server for picking a server I had no idea would be imbalanced? Yeah let me just leave my whole guild and friends behind because of something I had no control over.
---
Your spot is held for a short period (2-5min?).
---
And fix activating stealth you immune to all spells while you're at it
---
https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/training.php
---
You don't have to learn everything, but you should get new ranks of Bite and Claw for your raptor as you level.
---
Good.
---
Experience, probably. Any Alliance from PVP servers can tell you this.
---
It was so in vanilla, it is so in classic, and the mentality still somewhat exists in retail.
---
You play on a pve server?  Getting to raids at primetime almost always involves wPvP and it's only phase 1.  Might as well have the best version of your pets, you're gonna have them for a long time.
---
I don’t understand how he’s ruining people’s experience by taking the Valor breastplate if no one else  needed it for an upgrade; I mean he even offered to reimburse the DE cost. If anything he’s going out of his way to make sure his ‘non-proper way to gear his character’ dosent effect others. 
---
Please could you explain that point a bit more.
---
It identifies as one
---
Depends on your server. Its not going to be impossible, but it will be extremely shitting. Again though, this depends on the server you're on
---
Yep I love puggle
---
Xd
---
21 happens a lot,
---
19 almost never happens
---
this is consistent with Vanilla
---
The guy going first has the same chance of an auto-win by rolling a 2.
---
The details are so intricate... aah it brings back great memories of getting ganked.
---
happens extremely frequently
---
They weren't added to the game until a later patch. I am not sure what phase they are going to be added in. Maybe phase 4.
---
This is like reporting class imbalance. Welcome to classic.
---
Click bait
---
You must be that special kind that won’t consider bear druids and paladin tanks for dungeons either.
---
Honestly, with the older median age (assuming so..) I’m surprised there are so many assholes in this game.  One would think we’d be more chill and friendly since this is such an old nostalgic game with not much relative complexity.  Maybe I just got bad luck but I’m 0/2 on guilds not being arrogant dicks.  I’m objectively a good player but I’m about to just join a chill guild even if we stuck on farming up to garr in mc I guess.
---
Yeah make fun of people who know things you don't, cause being ignorant is better in life.
---
Hurting other experiences? Dude you sound like the hugest no lifer fucking ever. How is rolling on valor, which is an upgrade- going to hurt someone's game experience.  If that dude wanted a shard he should fucking buy it like everyone  else.
---
He wouldnt have to farm it unless he feels like he need it. If he's just gonna fuck around stormwind whilst waiting for raids he wont need an epic mount.
---
Why not simply do some dungeons, chat with some people, throw some lines out? Im not saying you have to join a massive cesspool-guild where you're just an anonymous player. There's plenty of smaller groups. But you have got to communicate.
---
Sounds like a made up story ngl
---
Basically anyone who you know picked something for the perceived superiority is typically an asshole.
---
Ignorance is bliss
---
noggenfogger did persist in classic cause people used it to fix the cat form hit box bug in pvp where you have to be in front of the person you are chasing for it to be in range
---
ahh that must be it
---
Roccor in BRD drops a cat one and magistrate in start undead drops a bear one.
---
Need is a stretch here though. Rhok is in a weird spot where clipped is better but only ends up being like 2-3% more damage. You spend less mana doing the full rotation and if you're more comfortable with full then you might end up doing better with it because the difference is so marginal.
---
Really?  Never been somewhere where I can’t pick up the quests listed on my map from questie. Been one or two quests listed that won’t be added till later phases. But that’s about it. And for reference. I’m doing a 100% quest run. So. I check pretty much every quest that pops up.
---
You know that just because technically everyone does it, doesn’t account for higher rates within a given population right? 
---
Of course you do, only a royal idiot would think otherwise.
---
No, it happens out of combat too.
---
Not on finishers though, it's so so sad to miss 3 eviscerates in a row :D
---
My comment isn't relevant to your request but I just needed to say that I am incredibly envious that you have nearly 2.5 months of no work and can play as much as you want. I hope you enjoy the shit out of this time.
---
Same on US servers
---
Hey Dadrokk.
---
You do realize you are not allowed to post the names of players in this sub for the purposes of witch hunts, right?
---
20 would be lucky
---
Thank you, I appreciate it.
---
what?
---
Battle fatigue? Karma? Who knows..
---
Don’t seem that difficult for Hunters? What makes you say that?
---
Usually if I can get a stack of sunder on each mob, and then focus hard on the main mark - all is well. Not everyone likes to wait on AOE or even heals though.
---
It’s like a JET FIGHTER made out of BICEPS
---
If you're on a pvp realm, phase 2 will be painful without an epic Mount, so take that into consideration.
---
Should he just use whites all the way to 60? After all bis  is all that matters.to you. 
---
If you went with your logic of never rolling on upgrades unless its bis/prebis, then youd have a whole lot of unseccuessfully dungeon runs- with people running around gearless. After all theres. Limited number of drops per run.
---
I think you're so lost in the bis mentally  you forgot to use your fucking brain.
---
Someone ninjad a bow from you then taunted you with it and you stayed in the dungeon lol?
---
Anyway no witchhunting.
---
Zandalar Tribe is awesome and we could always use more Dwarves. If you like warrior by any chance go level that. The shortage of tanks is real.
---
I'm totally fine, you seem to be the one about to have aneurysm.
---
thug shirt is BiS imo
---
Mount 100% no question
---
far too many people like this playing right now
---
upgrades are upgrades no matter how big or if they are "BIS" or not
---
Not yet they dont
---
It's a joke, you killed it.
---
Give us this day our daily thread.
---
Max energy doesn't help much, it's mostly about regen
---
AND FORGIVE US OUR DEBTS
---
You shouldn't be sad that other people aren't trash like you and are capable of tracking multiple things like enemy cooldowns. Thus the need for this addon.
---
Way back when this game first started, my friend rolled an undead on a pvp server.  He kept getting killed and asked me why, and this was my answer:
---
You're a fucking zombie, dude.  What do people do in every goddamn game with a zombie they kill the fucking zombie.
---
That's a blatant lie, but ok.
---
You on Incendius by chance?
---
Not a bug.
---
I'll just use all 3 plus the prat modifiers lol
---
Names are now deleted. However i wasnt demanding a witch hunt. Wasnt calling for harrassment. It was allowing people to choose to avoid them at their discression.
---
and my realm is 60-40 horde, yet each door at Dire Maul theres a 20 man alli raid and 0 horde apart from the ghosts waiting for res timer. so what. horde gets preraid bis in pve while alli suck outside
---
This isn't new. It happens on Druid too.
---
What do you mean? The other guy still has a 50/50 in that scenario? It only ends when someone gets 1 from what I've seen. The number you roll for is the number the other guy rolled, even if it's the same
---
Triggered much? 
---
Take some responsibility and just own that you want to be a dick to people instead of blaming other people for being a dick. Unless you are like 13, actually scratch that, some 13 year olds take responsibility.
---
/cast pickpocket at the start of your stealth openers
---
Wow you can’t just call people nuggers
---
Maybe for you. I get the 19 tick almost every mob
---
I imagine it depends on the class. As a warlock I can have three mobs at once, but I imagine warriors need to fight greens
---
He is a Priest
---
it was 1 boss from finish. Might as well try to finish it for the quests as opposed to spending another hour or 2 doing the whole thing again.
---
Depends, deep resto has its upsides depending on the number other druids and your healer role in your raid, but if you're strapped for mana in it swiftmending on the last tick is a good way to alleviate the bad mana efficiency of regrowth and rejuvenation. For pure mana efficiency there's the moonglow HT spec but if the cow is oom she's probably not using it. There's also a regrowth crit nature's grace spec, great for sniping heals in raids but horrible mana efficiency. Or the HotW spec for having a huge mana pool but that'll run dry as well.
---
In that dudes post history he suggest ninjaing gear from pugs if you're  with friends. Hes a litteral shit human being.
---
Cows are very social animals, and many of them have best friends! When separated, they often search for friends and family even years later.Cows are considered sacred for Hindus in India.
---
I had 1000g and got my mount as soon as I hit 60 also as a priest. Best decision ever. I knew that once the gold was gone, I would probably never have 1000g again, as I would continue to buy enchants, reagents, and repairs.  With the mount I could at least farm my own herbs efficiently. Now I sit around 200g constantly. BIS gear is easily replaced in MC/Ony. The mount will last until the end of the expansion. Those who say BIS  still don't have their epic mount
---
do u know if ignite stacks eg we get ignite on the mob from flamestrike+blastwave or does the blastwave one overrides the flamestrike ones ?
---
None, I suspect, but that's what the guy asked for.
---
A wow account isn't netflix
---
Reporting for duty
---
“Talks about one class” “means every other class is evil”.
---
Really might want to work on that extrapolation ability chief.
---
because its like 10-15 packs of mobs to get to him
---
Im in the same position as OP. I worked 300 H/M for 4 months this summer. So now I have 3.5 months of paid vacation. Grinding your ass off pays of IRL as much as it does ingame ;)
---
You can do chest of seven runs before 60 there is no excuse to walk into a ubrs without it. 
---
I’m sick of these awful players doing shit dps and wasting my time. This game isn’t hard go after the gear you need and stop being lazy.
---
Bad bot
---
I didn't check the population of either of the servers I started on, so my human pally is on a 2:1 Horde/Alliance server and my undead priest is on a 3:1 Alliance to horde server. It feels like that one WoW South Park episode, lol.
---
Cowvinklein would like a word.
---
Do you get gifts of deviat supreme often?
---
Where'd ya hear that?  /s
---
Send them this thread for a reality check and then leave that fucking guild
---
That you don't have another chat tab. Also seems like it makes the chat log cut off earlier.
---
If someone does it 9 times as much as the other side, it would be pretty retarded to talk about them as if they are equal, or at equal rates.
---
To be fair, you're playing a female night elf hunter, the alliance equivalent of undead rogue.
---
Thanks, I worked 6 days a week 10-12 hours a day for quite a while. So it’s weird to have so much time.
---
I mean... Do you *think* Blizzard wants two people playing when only one is being paid for?
---
Have a lvl 30 pally, thinking of respecing holy and just grinding dungeons for 30-60 because I'm not really enjoying ret leveling. 
---
Is this a good idea or at least a viable thing to do or will I just end up hating it more? Anyone else level primarily through dungeons have any advice/tips?
---
Amazing. Hope we get a Princess Theradrass in her beautiful nature sanctum soon!
---
I’m working on that, but I thought I’d reach out here too! All avenues rights?
---
Does he even realise how difficult it is to get savage gladiator chain? That shit is rare as fuck to get and I haven’t got that on my hunter in over 80 BRD arena runs... I haven’t even seen it drop for that matter.
---
Ignore idiots like that. People take this game far too seriously.
---
No snark friendly pro-tip:  Delete this post before a mod has to.
---
Nope, they just have a threat generating ability.
---
Of course its not fun for the victims, its griefing.
---
You can go MM without pain if you like that playstyle more (aimed shot completely changes your rotation), but beastmastery will be more damage. The reason being that your gear is bad while leveling but your pet is completely gear independent so the boosts that it gets from BM outweigh what you would get from MM.
---
I feel this very strongly about human warriors. Why would anyone play a human warrior? You are playing literally the only thing you could actually sort of be IRL.
---
Down votes from horde trash are gold to me. Never played wow till classic and was ganked by nothing but high lvl. Funny thing is i never stop to fuck with a low lvl. Beat the shit out of horde 2 lvls higher he comes back with help.
---
Damn only a problem since lunch?
---
Depends, the difference between a good specced healer and a bad healer is pretty huge 
---
the healer mana determines the speed of your run
---
Or can I?
---
Fuck that person. That is annoying dude. You’re better off not in there , there are better discord’s that are better run.
---
Leveling sub as well, 38 now. It doesnt feel sub optimal for me. Maybe sub optimal in a PvE server and a dungeon.. but out in the world questing or grinding, I kill just as fast as my fellow combat rogues. I'm sure the difference will become more noticeable in the 50's and onward but I think the utility in PvP is always going to make up for it.
---
sealcub has been unsubscribed from AnimalFactsBot. I won't reply to your comments any more.
---
Weapon skill.....................
---
Fuck off
---
Is there a macros to chain the same spell? Put it on cycle of some sort? 
---
Asking for a mage friend :D
---
But it was an upgrade...  
---
Some people don't enjoy nerding out and spamming the same dungeons over and over, especially when it's not even remotely necessary seeing as you can do MC in green. Not everyone is a sweaty egokid like yourself.
---
Good pitch but yuck.. Cold calling.
---
Im 100% planning on still playing Retail. Classic will end eventually unless they start adding stuf that wasnt in vanilla, and thats probably just gonna make people leave the game.
---
Guild name is still there.
---
Honestly, there are a massive amount of idiots who play this game. 
---
Don't waste your time on these type of people.
---
You can safely buttonbash it without shifting back out during the GCD - I thought that's what you were after.
---
If you're looking for a macro that you can mash straight after a Shred, that isn't currently possible afaik.
---
this video's comment section seem to say so https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtasfA3FvmU&amp;t=49s
---
 also alot of streamers have reported such.
---
Enjoy being eaten alive by warlocks.
---
They see that shiny gear miles away
---
I started roaming leveling zones and killing undead rogues just for being ud rogoes. I don't even look at other horde. Few hours 2 days ago and I won't stop, I plan on doing it in the future every time I'm bored.
---
God I can't wait until my gear and the healers gear can support this.
---
ooo, interesting... so did they add the relic slot into Vanilla in a later patch or was that slot always there since the beginning?
---
I was lvling arms until 50 and swapped to fury, its way more fun if nothing else and honestly, later on it gets pretty hard to do 2 mob pulls anyway which means sweeping strikes is a dead talent at times.
---
well it would be a fucking useless post if it was "PSA, dont do dungs/raids with XXXXXXX in skullflame"
---
I came back for classic, played retail for 3 weeks while waiting for release. First time back since wotlk, and I will never play retail again
---
This subs definition (and most subs) is posting names in a a negative light.  This thread is blatantly breaking that rule
---
You have a point... I just kept wandering so they have a harder time to catch me. But besides that there’s nothing much you can do about it.
---
Below the third roll is literally a copy of the text above it, a perfect copy, you missed a few pixels down when copy pasting this.
---
Fake.
---
Your logic or feelings about it are irrelevant, it violates rules.
---
I thought we were asking for 1.12 #nochanges?
---
Magram ftw.
---
Bacon in waffles
---
Stupid question,  is that good?
---
It s not. I was like that in vanilla
---
No idea what i just watched... but i enjoyed it
---
Ty mate
---
Yeah you peeps are in the wrong for stealing a book the tank would use.
---
Shame on your greed over that players main spec.
---
For the weapon changing macro take the numbers you got from the other script(for you it is 8, 9 and 10) and use the command UseAction(number).
---
The Macro should look like this:
---
    /run UseAction(8); UseAction(9); UseAction(10);
---
Healing touch is why I decided not to roll a resto druid. I played tree from BC to BfA and I much prefer the hotbot style of healing.
---
Powershift?
---
It’s based on the victims rep. If you don’t have at least friendly with the town. The guards will not help you.
---
I AM SERIOUSLY STARTING TO HATE WARRIORS MORE AND MORE! YOU ROLL ON EVRRYTHING THAT DROPS BECAUSE YOY NEED STAMINA FPR TANKING AND THE NEXT TIME AROUND YOU NEED CRIT AND HIT FOR THREAT BECAUSE ITS GOOD FOR TANKING LIKE FOR REAL FOO REAL MAN 
---
DO YOU FIND IT INFURIATING TO BE TRAPPED KITED AND GANKED IN BRM? GOOOOOD!!
---
You are either a genius or a moron lol
---
At the moment I'm not playing retail but I think I'll try the new patch when it comes out. Definitely not quitting retail for good
---
+1 for the subtle Leet. Nice.
---
I could never fully switch to classic because most of the things I love about the game were added after Vanilla. 
---
That said I am still having fun with Classic. Mostly just casually leveling with a friend.
---
Sounds like your typical private server asshole. I ran in to them all the time playing those servers, they really ruin the game for everyone
---
He's not wrong, he's just an asshole.
---
Dude I love all of these...especially the alcohol one, I’m into that
---
I've learned through an ancient wowhead comment that the Scarlet Medic in Western Plaguelands can give you a +80 Arcane Resistance buff if you mind control her.  What are some other cool mobs to MC?
---
Did I hit a nerve or something?
---
He didn't say "in this order"
---
I’m staying on classic unless they make some huge changes. Every class being unique is the key. Every class in retail basically has a heal and cc it’s ridiculous
---
Its just not that good at 40, with the addition of mortal strike it gets left in the dust up until you get hit and some gear
---
I think we found that dickhead's reddit account.
---
What an asshole. If it's an upgrade it's an upgrade, and if you want to collect your tier 0 why not? I'm gonna work on getting my whole t0 set even though it's ass for raiding, because it's actually pretty good for pvp.
---
Why the frick didn't you leave?? I get that they are assholes. But you weren't so smart yourself by staying either
---
Undead Rogues gank, Orc Rogues are the real PvP'ers.
---
Is this a suicide letter?
---
I have essentially quit retail unless some drastic happens. Level squish, removal of both lfr and lfd, and normal raid difficulty (make normal heroic hard and heroic mythic hard), remove sharding, Take away time gated content and let me grind when i want to. 
---
That being said im keen for a new diablo and maybe something in the starcraft universe.
---
"warlocks can aoe them down just as fast"
---
Then goes to say "especially if there are two".
---
Lol so it takes two locks to do what one mage can do "just as fast".
---
Ally scum!!
---
Still deciding if I want to tank or heal. I guess it depends what we need. I'd like to tank dungeons and heal raids but it'll be harder to get gear that way
---
What are you interested in ?
---
Google is probably your best bet (as with a lot of things) - at least I’ve been able to find everything I wanted from macroses until now by googling “wow classic macro for ...” or something like that.
---
My guild is swapping realms, thought I'd ask but people just downvote instead of providing an answer?
---
I love how you put it this way, most groups I know would drop your bitch ass in a second and carry on while you whined about losing a shard in UBRS.  Get good, it makes room for generosity where you clearly feel you have none.
---
Imagine thinking you're so smart that's the reason you're depressed.
---
try landing in light's hope on Shazzrah eu, you'll have to death run to the scar to even try getting to strat.
---
I just hit 60 yesterday with 110g /cry. Only good drop I got was a disgusting oozing companion in un’goro which has still yet to sell.
---
Have all 13 classes on retail at 120, farmed old raids every week on all of them for gold and tmog, raised decently well on most of them.
---
I've switched for good. In one character on Classic I've gotten more fulfillment than all of my characters combined on retail.
---
Aye, and the way you prevent people who lack objectivity from deciding who gets the loot is by not using loot council.
---
&gt;when you are progressing AQ for example, loot council is absolutely the best method for distributing loot
---
At no point in this game does having +5dps on one person versus another ever matter.
---
IF you are talking about OP picture, and IF it was a death roll he already lost by rolling a 1. If it was regular roll I would argue that the mage would do a /roll as well as it could end in an equal match.
---
An intro lesson I guess. I forgot it all in 15 years. Saw some threads discussing it and wondered
---
Boy that was a stupid comment.  
---
ITT means in this thread. This entire thread is full of people saying undead rogues and gnome mages and nelf hunters are ***all*** the worst of the worst. No reason for me to explain that to someone with a fucking brain, but here we are.
---
Don't respond, thanks.
---
Paladins are awesome. They are one of only two classes which wears plate mail, so you get that awesome heavy armour look, and then either shield or huge maces. 
---
They are tough, share their power with their friends in the form of some of the best buffs, particularly Blessing of Kings. Great healers, they can also tank whilst levelling and are very strong in PVP due to being hard to kill. They have a lot of very strong "cooldowns" - abilities which can't be cast very often, but are usually atrong. Spells like Lay on Hands or Blessing of Protection and Divine Intervention which allow them to save the party from certain death with powerf spells.
---
For people who have played the game a long time and are concerned about what every class is the best at, they are one of the best healers in the game. So often people focus paladins on healing later on. But there is a lot to do in the game from making money, to PvP, to raiding, to crafting so you don't have to do just one thing. And in PvP battlegrounds you can be anything you want to be.
---
I would suggest don't read too much information from the community. They have played for a long time and already know everything about the game. But they would probably all go back and start over from scratch knowing nothing if they could. The best part of the game is learning about it yourself. So go for it and enjoy it instead of worrying too much about exactly what is best. Play the class you love. They all have a role.
---
damn and here was me thinking they actually made un'goro crater a real thing
---
Wait people can tell when you target them?? Omg.....
---
I mean honestly you sound pretty toxic as well.
---
Yeah I would imagine anything is possible
---
Might take a while.  Ive seen the same guy doing this all week in booty bay, every horde in the town report him.  Still there doing it.
---
I agree. But OP isn't crying
---
Sub rogue, being able to do 2/3 of their total health with ambush is pretty damn satisfying
---
I have literally never seen a tick for 19 as a full bis rogue. 21s happen all the time though.
---
Have you tried cancelform instead of bearform to unshift
---
Im talking about a deathroll. So if you are saying the other guy doesnt have to roll if the first guy rolls a 1 on the first roll then its pretty unfair to the guy going first since there is a chance he loses instantly and the other guy never had a risk
---
WowthanksI'mcured
---
I have generosity for those how put in the effort and deserve it.
---
I don’t believe in handouts for lazy people like OP
---
There is no reason to skip your BRD upgrade as a warrior you are either to stupid to look at google for 5 second or too lazy to spend your time properly in game to not be a complete fucking burden.
---
Druids fuck
---
Spell  batching has nothing to do with melee leeway.
---
Well, they arent wrong. I mean certainly play what's fun for you, but if you're leveling holy solely because you think you're saving time by not drinking in dungeons - you're doing it wrong. 
---
I'm currently mid 40s, and still have no issue at all healing. If I'm with a tank that's  doing big pulls, I'll full on heal, and drink while they start the next pull (if needed). Pop up when he's about 35% health and get him back up. If it's a tank that is pulling smaller groups, I go shadow most the time, and VE does nearly all the healing (and not spec'd into improved). Most runs is a combination of the two. Th he extra damage, and drink timing - groups are rarely sitting around waiting for me to drink.
---
And certainly questing or solo play is faster as shadow.
---
(And I consider myself a healer - always have been- will swap to full on holy when necc)
---
Shaman(enhancement) - the joy of being able to do a little bit of everything, huge lottery burst, heals, long range/ mid range spells, best kiting potential in game IMO
---
Do you really think one single person on this planet thinks this way? It's purely out of spite and schadenfreude.
---
Making quite the assumption.
---
Well no I didn’t, I signed up for pvp not to become the reputation grind for people for someone 12+ levels above me
---
i mean... i totally agree with u, its a bit twisted xd i used to do it when my favorite snipers were all online, but in my defense, im not a nice person !
---
I’m a big fan of my warlock. I play one in retail but never did in vanilla. I love the dot and drain aspect to it and I feel decently strong in pvp at level 44. I can usually take on 2 players at once depending on what they are and how good they are. And with life tap I can dot 4 to 5 targets howl and drain and usually be fine. Especially if they are mobs that run at low hp.
---
I also love my alt Druid he’s low level but for some reason I really like being a super underplayed class on my server.
---
Forget about spell batching! A true master of Aera of Effect is a build like [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/1-055200300003-05300233132051301). Because a ice barrier is just hand down better than blast wave and if a guaranteed flame strike critical doesn't kill them, blizzards and flame strike area damage will kill the pack you are AoEing. 
---
  https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/1-055200300003-05300233132051301
---
Dont forget the dodge from ghostly strike! More often than not using this right after ambush ends a fight leaving me full or nearly full hp resulting in little to no downtime.
---
Luck will come your way don't worry. Just start farming shit and you'll get lucky. I had been farming Felcloth for an hour when Edgemaster's dropped
---
Maybe :P I'm a DPS too. And I leave the instant I see shit like that. I don't care if I don't find a new group quickly. But I'm not going to let assholes ruin my dungeon run.
---
You can start from here :
---
https://www.wowhead.com/making-a-macro-commands-modifiers-warcraft-guide
---
But keep in mind, that classic use api that substantially different from retail.
---
You can search wowhead for popular\helpfull macroses for your class.
---
Day 8 at 60, no one knows I haven't trained rank 1 starfall yet.
---
It isn't. Some people are defensive about their choice in going to a pvp server because, if pve servers aren't missing out on some percieved content,  their getting camped for a few hours by max level characters was a total waste of time. Imagine wanting a choice in gameplay!
---
It won't get worse then 12 but it might get worse than 2 depending on when it drops
---
Blah I stupidly sold that pattern on the AH for a measly 3G.
---
Priest - I really like to just shield up, dot and wand enemies down ^^.  Besides that I am having a great time being the healer in quest groups and dungeon parties.
---
Just tested your Macro on my druid with minor Healing Potion and it worked perfectly so the macro is correct. I can't help you more than that sorry :/
---
Has nothing to do with epeen. It has to do with wanting to quest, farm, or get inside BRM without dying 18 times.
---
Account sharing is bannable. Honestly if you want to play with him and he really can’t afford the $15 you should help him out. 
---
Think of it as a one time cost. Once you get him addicted he will find a way to afford the subscription on his own
---
Where do you get the notion that pservers are full of assholes? Sounds like something you just read and accepted rather than experienced yourself.
---
Most people probably don't even have their abiliies key bound but sure everyone is a min-maxer lol
---
I’d go ahead and agree with not training most of those up except for berserker rage and whirlwind. Those are bread and butter and will enhance your leveling  and dungeon experience considerably.  They are so cheap they shouldn’t make or break your ability to purchase your mount when the time comes.
---
&gt;a thorns buff,
---
Wait, what?
---
I mean you're trying to be funny and edgy, but in  reality you just validate a person messing up the happy moment of another person for no reason. That's just sad really.
---
It's not bannable or people would have been banned for it, the same people are doing it for weeks without anything happening
---
Hey fellow Stonespiner! Nothing wrong with our realm if you'd ask me, I like how the ratio slightly favours Horde. I like being the underdog, but not by too much.
---
[Ayy]: lmao
---
I thought about doing the same thing but the other pre-raid items that offer hit are few and far between. Once you begin raiding a few items pop up. Getting 2% seems trivial but i’ve found it was less painful just going for devilsaur set. Between blackstone ring, devilsaur, and truestrike shoulders you’re at 5%. From there depending on your class you can get that last 1% via ring, weapon, helm, or a raid neck.
---
fuck me this is reddit not high court.
---
It's just a green belt.
---
Sure you did
---
You're actually so twisted you can't see how wrong you are.  Taking an upgrade is the min/max approach over a shard.  On top of that, your dumb ass must not have read the part where he offered the shard cost to the group - even the shitty tank saw that as fine.  Your assertion he's lazy is actually just ignorance and lack of reading comprehension, but we both know you have no personal standards and will say anything to garner a reaction.  Sad.
---
Outside of progression, I’m going to be rocking Tier gear. Fuck the BiS lists
---
Guess that's a yes and I'll just block you then.   Bye
---
Why especially if they're an officer?
---
I really hope 9.0 is good, I would rather play a new game that I enjoy. But it's not nostolgia, classic just works for me.
---
To ganging greys.
---
Ninjaing is the same fun. You get a lot of grief and they even are able to direct it at you. You don't even have to imagine they are biting their keyboard and swearing. You can hear them on discord and screencast their tirades on you.
---
It is really asocial shit. Both.
---
Paladin. Big heal. Little heal. Cleanse if it looks bad. Lay on hands if you oom during a boss fight.
---
"Vanish working as intended"
---
Yes, people who deny the enemy access to the BiS pet for PVP are wasted DNA. It's a rare pet and if this guy was looking for it specifically he was looking to get better at PVP. You don't see the irony in complaining about PVP when you're gearing up to do just that?
---
The war effort will be done in less than a week, guilds already have hundreds of stacks of materials banked for it and a year from now it will be even more hoarded.
---
People in raiding guilds at that point will only care about getting AQ open so they can complete their TRUE BIS spreadsheet.
---
You can use the mount to farm more gold. Get mount.
---
Went from tank to mage. Now I can blink, make food and water, and teleport. 
---
I can just be chillin, and have several dudes hit me up asking for portals for 1gold each. 
---
I can mob control and kill several enemies at a time 
---
And I have a shit ton of spell damage, as I used my main to pay for auction house shit on my mage.
---
Is that a PvE server? These public events always remind me of the funeral in Winterspring
---
They are SABBERS!
---
Hehe yea, by suckering OP to keep paying for his account to stay active...
---
I mean he’s right. Your specialization is shadow but you can still heal a 5 man. Better get used to people wanting you to heal if you want to get in pugs.
---
&gt; #showtooltip Superior Healing Potion
---
&gt; /cancelform
---
&gt; /use Greater Healthstone
---
&gt; /use Superior Healing Potion
---
&gt; /cast Dire Bear Form
---
so it turns out both the macros work, mine and yours as well. I just tried manually clicking on a health potion right out of my bags and my character wont consume it...so thats odd. Must be an addon or something interfering, ive never experienced this before.
---
No, the argument makes sense. We will be engaging in PvP against each other soon, why let the other faction get ahead by any means?
---
Trash horde
---
Gratz
---
I think ele pvp is super satisfying if you're into that kind of thing.
---
I’ve ran tests to compare bite and claw, however bite comes out on top every single time. I am completely willing to use claw instead if you’ll show me your math/sources
---
It's a long ass post and it doesn't say US anywhere. Again please?
---
&gt; Or killing yourself on accident when the healer chooses me instead of you.
---
As a healer, i love this part the most lol.
---
At this point in the game, I don't really see the point of any other healing specs for PVE besides Moonglow personally
---
What I don't understand is; why you keep referring to the people that played vanilla as they didn't know or understand the game, could you please explain this?
---
I ask because I am one of those vanilla vets. I can agree that there is an absolute shit ton more of information easily accessible now than there was back then, but we definitely knew what we were doing my friend.
---
Wait another level or two, then make the swap.
---
Weird. On my server Dreanor, a guy named Armani did this
---
Ditto
---
I fucking read it.
---
Tanking Stances in retail add so much threat it’s essentially not even a mechanic anymore.
---
I probably shoulda thrown an "lol" or something in there, it was more of a joke, poorly worded, mb. Hell yeah he has fun, he plays a pally to the fullest of what the class can do!
---
Yes but as a result of industrialization Millions of azerothians were lifted out of poverty
---
If you don't mind healing in raids, then go for it
---
Yup. Exactly. As a former competitive raider, BiS wasnt something until much later on. Vanilla was just upgrades or not. Sometimes we just preferred one item to another due to playstyle. I loved t2 on mage in vanilla because it was OP in pvp.
---
Tell that to hemo rogues
---
Listen here, Mr. Tank, as a dps player myself I don't think you realize how closely my feelings of self worth are tied to that dps meter. Do you just expect me to be 2nd or 3rd in dmg in a Strath run, do you realize what that would do to my ego! No sir, I'm going to just blast the shit outta everything with every cool down I can and this whole 'threat' theory can go jump in the lake!
---
You will be banned if you ask a question about warrior?
---
Always stay in Arms spec, then 20 minutes before raid thats when you would respec to fury or prot or whatever. Biggest tip i can give you for dungeons is to pool rage for the next pack. When there's only 1-2 mobs at low hp, you just wanna stock up on rage so you can get aggro immediately on the next pack. Watch good warrior players on twitch ( twitch.tv/maitoz twitch.tv/moo_uk twitch.tv/tribe_tv1 twitch.tv/zulp twitch.tv/skarmtank ). Skarm and tribe are pretty good about answering questions, but some of the other guys dont like answering the stupid questions that could be answered by a quick google search. hope this helps.
---
Intellect is a trap while leveling and doesn't actually do all that much just fyi.
---
Entrance is my spec of choice due to me experiences in vanilla. My shaman in retail is elemental though, don't like the 1h dual wield enhance
---
Up and down arrow keys.
---
Pfft, dont give that chucklefuck the credence.  He's big mad you got loot he wants and didnt get.
---
Awesome edit man, but the content itself was kinda boring imho lol, just a random sm run.
---
Maybe for PvE but have you tried to play an optimal sub rogue in PvP?
---
I haven’t been a fan of retail in so long. 
---
Classic all the way for me
---
power corrupts, he could assign more gear towards himself while at the same time already negotiating a position in the top dog guild, that will be happy to get him as they basically get lots of gear from another guild.
---
I've never seen ticks for 19 or 21 are you sure y'all aren't getting parried?
---
Playing since Vanilla Beta, and i came back to classic for nostalgy and will come back to BFA in 8.3
---
Recently hit 60 as a troll priest. Current holy/disc raiding with the goal to switch to PvP when phase II hits. How viable is troll vs. undead in a PvP environment? Loosing sleep currently over not having will of the forsaken and cannibalize and wondering if shadowguard/berserking compare.
---
The relics go into the ranged item equip slot since the classes that get them (druid, paladin, shaman) can't use ranged weapons. I'm sure it's the reason they were added since every other class got another source of stats that the hybrid classes didn't.
---
Yet it can still meet the Patchwerk dps check so it's okay in my book! The only class I'm no sure that can is boomie on account of mana problems, they sure hit hard enough
---
That's the beauty of it, gotta make it interesting with the edit
---
It's fixed now
---
It's a 100% a bug Blizzard doesn't admit exists, seen it happen several times. 
---
Friend lost a drop from Balnazzar that way, the whole party was still in the room when he won the item, he had space in his bags but game didn't loot it for him. From his experience there's nothing you can do, even though he had chat log screenshots of when he won the item and when the portaled IF (with chat timestamps), Blizz just said he probably had his bags full and closed the ticket.
---
Yeah, It's called "Target of Target" you can enable it in the interface options under Combat.
---
Reserving was almost unheard of in vanilla pugs. You pray to the RNG gods, and if you’re the creator of the group, maybe you didn’t invite 3 other casters if you’re a mage too.  Let the roll gods decide.
---
Use Sphinxy classic gathermate2 addon for classic nodes. And mine only did that if I put the node file into the gathermate file
---
Thats why I rolled on a pve server!
---
Tbh unless you both are 15, if he can't afford $15 a month then he needs to reevaluate his priorities and doesn't have the time for classic.
---
I love my Paladin. 
---
I’m only level 32 but I’ve been enjoying my time with it. 
---
I enjoy running around and randomly healing and buffing strangers. It makes me feel cool.
---
I absolutely love reviving someone. Especially when they whisper me saying “omg thank you sooooo much”. Again I feel cool
---
I join random groups for quests and people always love having me. I can tank and heal at the same time. Again I feel cool.
---
I like helping people and everyone is happy to have someone who can heal them or revive them if needed.
---
It’s pretty accurate when people say “I hope you like auto attack”. Because yeah that’s most of it haha. 
---
I usually have a movie or tv show on while I play. Very enjoyable.
---
Mage is fun, with teleports, making food and water and aoe. 
---
Hunters are good for questing and playing dead is a nice trick. 
---
Shamans have some explosive dps 
---
Up to you. Can’t go wrong really
---
Yup. I automatically ignore and have a personal blacklist of people like this so I never group with them. It is a game and all they do is bitch and complain about min-maxing and omg if the dungeon takes an extra time 2min.
---
You don’t need to be tank spec to tank at that level. It really doesn’t start mattering until later on in the game where bosses require you to have mitigation or they’re going to murder you.
---
As a tank myself I’ve noticed this about a lot of other tanks. For some people I feel like tanking is a power trip that goes to their heads. It pays dividends in the end if mistakes happen that A) you own the mistake if it’s your fault, not just instantly blaming the DPS or healer or B) you can talk through mistakes instead of immediately shitting on people and making the dungeon/raid painful. At the end of the day it’s just a game.
---
If you are dotting up every single mob, especially not in the same order they are marked, a warlock will absolutely pull aggro. Tank needs to focus on getting threat on skull first then X because that is what DPS are focusing. If warlock is putting dots on target 3 or 4 in the pack, the tank hasn't even hit them yet because they want to keep aggro on the first 2. Spoken as a bear tank, because swipe is bad.
---
I stopped playing Retail during WoD and don't intend to restart. Classic however I'm enjoying immensely.
---
How would 31 5 15 look?
---
No if you ask questions already answered in the FAQ
---
You have absolutely no idea what you are talking about.
---
&gt;Theyre pretty terrible in BRD tho
---
Those dwarf lieutenants, though? The ones with paladin bubble, flash heals and a rifle? ASSUMING DIRECT CONTROL on them helps a lot in that part of the dungeon.
---
I don't know how old they are, but my guild's got a few 'bro' types. I assume they are in their 30s now. Sometimes they are amusing, sometimes I can tolerate them on voice chat. 
---
(They scream a lot and seem to revel in scatological humor.)
---
Thanks for spreading your uninformed speculation. You sure did us all a favor by posting that comment.
---
Oh ok makes sense
---
The argument is "I know devilsaur is better, yet 100% mount is still BIS"
---
Similarly but more relevant, there’s a mob in lbrs that gives a fire resistance buff that’s good for the attempts on rag with less FR gear. 
---
There’s a few mobs in late game dungeons that deal incredible amounts of dps that are nice to MC, such as sorcerers and battlemages in strath live, and evokers and some ogres in lbrs. 
---
In a later phase, for people to learn how to smelt elementium, they have to learn it from a mob that you mind control.
---
Play another game. You've been doing almost nothing but play Classic since launch. I actually enjoy getting to raid farm mode in WoW. The feeling in retail that there is always something I should be doing every day is one of the reasons I burn out when I've tried to play it over the last few years.
---
xD yes in naxx phase warriors will beat druids in performance,but still druids find their spot in every phase .. good things about druids are they adaptation , i myself tank one boss and heal next .. good player should use any aspect if its class
---
also the difference is lack of items from raids i belive . also scaling isnt perfect and tier sets for healers mainly dont help... learn your class to the deepest and you will be warmth welcome to any group and/or raid
---
Are those nice, yeah. If you’re the top 1% it might matter. Otherwise you’re fine.
---
Bear's autoattack damage is also roughly 2.5x as high if you don't have significant amounts of Agi, which you're unlikely to have by 20. No matter which form you're in, most of your damage comes from autoattacks at those levels. And somehow, I've found bear to end up with better damage when all's said and done. It definitively has better downtime as the armor lets you last another mob before you have to heal.
---
It doesn't say anywhere you “must“ kill low level players and it doesn't say anywhere you “must“ only roll on loot for your class. Tough luck I guess. I think both is despicable.
---
Well... I am one single person, ain't I? ;D
---
You can’t detect it by the user clicking reset instance, and it being written in the chat afterwards? Manual would work for me too though :P
---
Also, reset doesn’t seem to do anything unless I also /reload - am I missing something?
---
Scientists should study you
---
https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/738/025/db0.jpg
---
😢 just try to logically reason that it's fine to click on other players. There's no problem with it at all and no one thinks about it.
---
There are dramatic retards in wow?  Please tell me more.
---
&gt;What the fuck at your post history bruh. 
---
x)
---
My favourite expansion is TBC/Wotlk, mainly Wotlk for the PvP since it isn't rock paper scissor like vanilla. 
---
I don't like freebies. I like raiding but I can't find the motivation to play the game solely to raid. I want something other meaningful to do.
---
This is probably a good pax’s and doing the right things. Only other option is a gathering prof if you don’t already have.
---
Keep in mind a Druid with travel form if your a couple levels into the 40’s it’s fine.
---
You didn't start raiding? 
---
What level is your warrior?
---
How many nips? I see 3 options:
---
2 nips; because of humanoid form.
---
4 nips, because of cow attributes.
---
8 nips, 2 set of 4 nips, a combo of both.
---
Like wise.
---
If you are arms weapon type likely does matter due to weapon specialization talents.
---
There is no reason to join a ubrs run before you have the BRD chest of seven chestpiece
---
&gt; In Everlook in the bank/AH/Qia building I've been killed a couple of times now when browsing Qia's wares
---
huh. all i ever see there is bots spamming qia for the patterns 24/7.
---
Lmao, "wasting your time"? You're playing the victim on someone's behalf and comparing a fucking videogame to bullying, evidently your time, like yourself, is worthless
---
I think some people do brd dwarves around that level, not sure if you’re high enough for that but maybe.
---
Reserving was the norm on pservers, wich are a good chunk of playerbase
---
&gt; Yes, people who deny the enemy access to the BiS pet for PVP are wasted DNA. It's a rare pet and if this guy was looking for it specifically he was looking to get better at PVP. You don't see the irony in complaining about PVP when you're gearing up to do just that?  
---
Imagine being so triggered about a tongue in cheek comment that you go on a tirade 😂
---
Who are you talking to?
---
These pre BIS lists are insufferable not to mention there's a ton of them that are just incorrect or unable to factor in advance things like set bonuses. We literally had 12 or 13 casters NOT want a sorcerous dagger because it's not their BIS weapon from MC. I had to remind this lot of idiot casters that Mageblade is rare as fuck and someone is taking this dagger or this raid is done.
---
Being able to NOPE out when a group of alliance rolls through looking to start some shit
---
You're right, it makes no sense. Perhaps I'll enjoy the game more when BG's come around. Although I was never too fond of vanilla PvP.
---
Also us tanks can’t afford epic mounts if we’re still gearing up :\
---
Lv 44 and lucky if I get 1/2 level per day.
---
I give it 5 bags of popcorn
---
Paladin May literally be the worst class to level. 
---
Ret doesn’t get any better. Dungeon grinding can get you to 60; SM to 42-44, zf to 52, BRD/lbrs to 60. Can heal the whole way. It’s really about can you withstand being in a dungeon for that long.
---
RP PvE
---
???
---
What is that add-on that gives that bar across the top?
---
Im also looking for that one!
---
Sure. It’s where lots of us started
---
Eh maybe. I'm not the one proving various studies though.
---
Sure, especially during levelling I made some great connections and got good memories. Sadly those people got stuck in their 30-40 and don't log on anymore. 
---
I've failed to make any meaningful connections in my guild. Perhaps I should find another one.
---
What's in demand? Warlocks / palas?
---
What I reccommend is finding a balance.
---
I don't want questie or other brainless helpers but I need to know that sometimes I need help to find a certain NPC for example.
---
I reccommend looking some things up online to just help a little.
---
Yeah it builds up the proc very quickly, which is what’s giving me some solace.
---
I’m going to go after T0 specifically to upgrade it to T.5. I plan to have significantly better before it’s even available, but I don’t care. I’ve wanted to do that quest chain since forever and now, I’m gonna.
---
Why are mages so retarded now? So he fucked up and took Agro and despite being a mage with all the shit mages have died before the tank could taunt it back?
---
What are you waiting for? You are about to embark on the biggest and most epic virtual adventure of your life.
---
I meant the stun blackout not the shadow weaving stacks
---
I dont go the full duration just 3-4 combo points. What ever i can get with my opener and a hemo
---
Literally a thread for any question. Why do you even bother being here?
---
You absolutely need shield block, berserker rage, and whirlwind. 
---
End of story.
---
Absolutely yes it is a great place for new and old players. If you roll a horde toon on the Grobb server you will have a home with my friends and I. We can teach you the ways of Warcraft
---
You're right. An extended break will perhaps do me good.
---
ive done the exact same. ive got 90% of my preraid bis, epic mount. done 4 professions to 300, have almost all flask recipes and elixirs in the game and over 4000 herbs stocked on an alt. I got sick with the flu and was to sick to play, still kinda am. And now ive lost a lot of interest outside of raids. I still love raids though. 
---
I plan to take a break and play alts and hope that my passion and drive comes back when my health returns.
---
That sucks. would be ace if it worked with SoR
---
Leaf 😢

Next week!

We have three warriors who are all looking to forge Quel Serrar this week. 
---
Does anyone know if you can do all 3 in one raid. The bit I'm wondering how many times Onyxia can be stabbed for the last part.
---
The last boss in ST hits incredibly hard and it is impossible to keep a mage alive if the boss is beating on it.
---
In classic, I have a gold full of people I know who seem to be sticking around for the long run. We run dungeon and ubrs together and they are good players.
---
My guild on retail has been dying a slow death since early Legion. It's was hard to find two people online at the same time, even before classic launch.
---
Likely the cast and the attack roll occur at two different times
---
Why did he have agro?! You shouldn’t ever have to heal not the tank on a single target boss fight
---
Goldshire orgies are legendary.
---
No. UD rogues are.
---
Well either you dont make much money or you're bad at math.
---
What?
---
You have no choice on the last boss. Tank gets banished and boss goes after a dps
---
It took me longer than it should have to understand what “last spot got sum” meant.
---
You had me in the first half.
---
Dude, there was nothing tongue in cheek about your post. Anyone who read that would assume you thought he was griefed.
---
Yup, it’s an RP-PvE server.
---
Hunters can do a DM tribute run solo?
---
why are you so paranoid that people will think its your video
---
you can just post a video without explaining your motives, this makes it 100000x more weird
---
Yes i did. Bfa doesn't interest me one bit.
---
Yeah, there's nothing complicated about it. The difficulty in classic is time investment and not so much mechanical difficulty.
---
No pummel? Woof
---
I saw it about three times in 10-15 runs. My buddy had worse luck and lost his roll to a hunter
---
Mount. One and done. Never have to worry about it again.
---
Yet he took mocking blow rank 2
---
Ha your boss is a fuckin RETARD
---
Hehe reverend love joy
---
A guild finally got lionheart helm recipe... they want a 300g crafting fee..
---
Mount, people are clearing MC without anything resembling BIS gear.  So why spend the money on gear you will replace rather quickly once you start raiding?  I would focus on things that help you enjoy playing rather than min/maxing.
---
same for kitties
---
Holy shit. You're an actual fucking loser; go outside you creature and stop telling people how to play a video game. But as I see the way that you talk to people over the internet, you probably don't do we'll with basic human to human interaction (autism?), hence why you sit behind a screen and keyboard all day acting like a pleb elitest.
---
Yeah his response was a little robust
---
This is unfortunately true. Pserver players are all fucking toxic savages.
---
I say that as a person with an enormous amount of pserver play time.
---
lol players like that always do the '??" thing its retarded
---
Ok, you may wish to work on your communication skills bud ♥
---
Finally some real advice.
---
drops another 10% with PVP rank 3 BTW
---
Paladins. They are so hard to kill in PVP.
---
Well, I am alliance so I don't hear about your side of the water
---
HoJ drops at Angerforge.
---
IT WILL TURN YOU INTO A FIGHTER JET MADE OUT OF BICEPS
---
No, there's also a very small chance it will drop from a few of the bosses.
---
Has anyone found an add-on that collects the minimap icons from other addons that works with classic? I've tried one called minimap button frame or something like that, but it didn't work.
---
The long-awaited third faction. Many expected it to be naga or demons, but it turns out Whimsydale was more of a concept piece than a joke.
---
from what i understand of it, spell batching is apart of the system used too help counter the shit latency ppl had back then. the system also included the melee leeway
---
so while spell batching =/= melee leeway, its like there siblings
---
Find treasure chest locations and add little "X" to mark the spot x)
---
It’s the best mmo for a noob in my opinion. It’s immersive and every little accomplishment is so rewarding.
---
&gt; I wasn’t even trying that hard to save and I had a mount at 40
---
I guess I'm not as lucky as you.
---
I'm playing with my son, and he is playing a warlock. So I'm wanting to get my mount ASAP, because I don't want to be running while he's mounted on his felsteed.
---
57 atm isn't extremely casual I'd say, just going by time spent. Could be wrong though.
---
Hitting on your mage point. I feel if a mage pulls threat, let them have it. If he can't control and kill the mobs solo, he will learn not to AoE. Most mages "should" know how to AoE farm and should not have a problem handling dungeons.
---
How can I see a group member’s pet’s health bar/portrait? As a healer I just want to see a hunter’s pet’s health so I can heal them more easily. Can I do this in game or with an addon? Thanks.
---
You gotta wear literal rags until you get the BiS item. Nothing in between obv.
---
Just noticed, face palm =.=
---
Or *git decent
---
Nothing in classic requires you to actually be Good. Especially as a mage.
---
True still his rule, his group but the indication that I could not heal because I'm not specced is like saying a arms warrior can't tank.
---
My first Halloween gift last night as a male Night Elf was a male Night Elf mask.
---
My ex guild came over from retail and have mostly returned.  Some people prefer retail.  There is 100% a bunch of people who will be going back to retail for good.  That said, there are a lot more staying.
---
Sure next time I will just lie though about the specc not like it'll be a difference
---
No, they are indeed excellent aids class.
---
Sword spec. Not impressed.
---
-dagger rogue
---
Good Bot
---
Happened to me as well. with some wrists with a lot of frost dmg. lvl 56 green. Was super happy to get it, but it never got into my bags and we wiped right after so i didnt get to check the corpse (my bags were not full either). everyone left after that and by the time i got back to the mob the corpse was gone. 
---
I tried to ticket it, but got a blanket response that didnt address the fact that the item didnt appear in my bags, so i moved on. no big deal.  
---
You can try to ticket it. But they wont restore it.
---
Side not on restoring items: I soloed a rare elite and was not able to loot at all. They restored those items, but one of the greens had no stats. So even when they restore they dont always do that right :P
---
It really doesn't help much at all, unless every single fight you're using your entire mana pool.
---
No need to engage someone that's immediately and very obviously an asshole. There is no response you can provide that will make them think "Hmm ok he's right. Good point." So there's actually no point responding to someone who's hostile in their first whisper. Idk what people think you're going to gain by talking to such a person. Do you have convo's with people on the street that run up and scream at you?
---
Not saying you're in the wrong obviously the dude is an idiot but I would just ignore them entirely.
---
If you had like 5-600 I would say bis, but if you have the full 1k I would just go for the mount. Gear is replaceable and you can farm pieces that are close in power to those items.
---
People ask him for ports and water all day. He is fucking with him to cut through the tediousness for his own sanity.
---
Amani Exchange *has enterted the market*
---
Ok let’s differentiate between a ban and a suspension. I thought ban was permanent and suspension was temporary is this not the case? I see the term ban used for all kinds of temporary actions nowadays
---
I hope he falls
---
Hello kitty island adventure
---
Buenos dias fucc boi!
---
Do you redraw the map from wow or do you travel through the zones and map it from your mind?
---
"Coming soon"?  We've got trailers for this stuff now? Fucking hell.
---
Why don't you just do something else?
---
I wonder what a centaur woman smells like.
---
It’s funny, my guildie told me to have faith in his healing when he caught me ice block. I told him I have 100% faith in my tanks and healers, but when I go full ham and pull 4 mobs, I’m sure as hell blocking next to the tank to drop aggro! Usually click block off with the GCD reset anyways and continue.
---
Please dont advertise tanking endgame dungeons as a fury warrior.. especially if you plan on rolling on dps gear.
---
Choose what you want to be right now - a fury warrior (fake combat rogue /s) or a tank and focus on just doing that well right now. 
---
Worry about your OS later. Would be like a ret paladin saying he wants to heal dungeons and needs all the gear because ret and holy is their main spec. All the while having only some points in holy then let's the group die.
---
&gt;I don’t have insecurities I’m in the best guild and putting up some of the best parses for my class.
---
Oh the irony.  
---
&gt; I’m only describing the reality of what will happen, sorry that the truth hurts you. 
---
But it doesn't happen, that's just the scenario you've dreamt up in your head to make you feel better. Besides, I have almost full BiS, simply because I had the time to farm it. I'm just capable of seeing the other side of the coin becuase I'm not an elitist bigot.
---
why? You kill enemies faster so you shouldnt have more downtime?
---
I'm not asking for a steak anyways, but if you gamble you should not enter a lose-lose scenario
---
Try some Pve server .. and its good to search some webs what u should do some spell rotations and those kind of stuff .. its not that ez like todays mmo for New player
---
Who /magramchad/ here?
---
Imagine someone in your group literally needing on useless items just to spite you, then trolling you by posting them in trade over and over again, and staying in the group anyway. Insanity.
---
I went into another group later at night and coincidentally the healer got invited too, he just went "that name looks familiar"... And then we just joked for the entire run XD
---
*28 mage still kills you*
---
Come to the alliance ;)
---
Gratz bro a lot of salty people in comments. Why can't we just congratulate you and move on lol.
---
I use handy notes for npc icons, and sexymap for my minimap. The icons display on my mini.
---
stfu with this "uh nothing in classic is difficult everything is easy blah blah" bullshit. None cares.
---
More like rock, paper, screw you warlock.
---
Do we know anything about the potential for paid character transfers? I have two groups of friends on different servers, and have I have two characters so I could play with each of them. At this point they are both 30+. I eventually wanted to consolidate my characters to the same server, hopefully with whichever group is still more consistent. However, both of these servers are high volume (I believe "layered" whenever I log on). Is it going to be possible to move a character to a high volume server ever?
---
I keep busy by trying to interact with people. Without people to have fun with, the game feels pretty empty after getting to your goal. Alts and professions help too. Some of my friends are lower level so I try to keep some alts around their level so we can progress together. 
---
Otherwise it’s like you said. Burnout and realization you’re just rinsing and repeating the same thing every time you play.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=11189/qia#comments
---
I used the macros in the second comment from the top.
---
Luna... It takes the time to be setup but it's really nice. And what I did is disable the party frame, set the raids frames and check the option to show raid frames on parties :)
---
? Its fun for your buttons to not work?
---
Wait. Are there more than 14 items you can get before raids??
---
also cant hide forms with noggen fogger still
---
I got a bit worried they fixed this, since I haven't seen any screenshots of this for the last few hours :P
---
There's 3 skill levels for mages. 
---
Lvl 1 = instantly popped, or didn't ice block in time for the healing spell to finish. 
---
Lvl 2 = manages iceblock if things go badly, gets a heal up. 
---
Lvl 3 = Healing is plenty because the mages knows the mobs and their damage values and at most only gets winged.
---
And a good gear can go really long way there also even without a rest specc. Ooh well I went back farming
---
I can neither confirm nor deny...
---
Jesus, you're a twerp.
---
he was 100% wrong to go off on you, but he is right that you shouldnt of rolled on an item thats not bis/prebis for your spec
---
you never roll on gear thats not bis/pre bis for you in a higher lvl dungeons because someone might of been farming it for weeks only to have it effectively ninja'd by someone who'll vendor/disenchant it some time soon after they find there prebis/bis. 
---
its like how holy priests are constantly rolling on the belt from BRD-arena, which has hit rating. a stat that for pve is basically useless for a holy priest. they do this because alot of the bis lists show it as like 2nd or 3rd optional pick(Which they shouldnt do) and the farms are very popular. when really the one they want is going to come from strath ud or ubrs. but they end up fucking any caster dps out of a pre bis, omega rare item. simply cuz they want a .1% increase in stats (they also do the same for the strath ud caster dps helm)
---
at the end of the day, i dont think you hurt anyone. so what ive just typed up is basically meaningless, but i hope that someone reads it and thinks twice about rolling need on something that isnt bis for there spec. because youd never want too be the person that lost a roll to someone who "barely" needed the item.
---
He-man was in Shattrath in TBC.
---
I really wanted to play Ret Paladin but ended up skipping it because the work involved to be competitive is ridiculous and I’m not interested in healing. If you play Paladin your probably going to be healing at end game so consider that.
---
Warriors can have it all. No one cares about rogues, lol
---
I would still go with the QoL improvement first.  The point was that the guild probably doesn’t need them to be fully decked out for current content.  Now if that isn’t the case and they are struggling to clear then it could be a different answer.
---
I’ll play retail again because I love the raiding. But that will always be there I feel, or something like it will exist elsewhere. Don’t think there’s any rush to stop experiencing classic any time soon
---
Are you upset about something?
---
So like a bunch drop everyday. That's not even low.
---
What a piece of shit you are.
---
It's adorable that you have such a terrible attitude about a video game.
---
And being rogueish and ninja shit is also implied :) why would you be able to roll on stuff you don't need if you should not.
---
So funny. The after BC came out if you said that you would get a guild invite. I just want to melt faces
---
If you go to settings, the raid profiles section has an option to “show pets”. This should work with both raid and party frames.
---
Not gonna lie... I don't like a lot of post-BC content... but the caravan in plaguelands I enjoyed a lot, it was amazing.
---
It's just a joke lol, typically combat rogues out damage the warriors unless a warrior has a noticable gear difference.
---
Combat swords is fine for BG PvP.
---
What’s honestly better? It’s like a single player game on easy void of any RPG elements.
---
I’m currently still playing retail just to level up a few alts to 120 so I can fully quit retail until the next expac.
---
I don’t get what’s better? On classic it’s not just the levelling but the social aspect that goes with it, trying to get gear, farming gold, levelling up weapons skills, deciding which abilities to train, what talents, levelling professions.
---
On retail, I do a few quests where I don’t have to think, ding, then dungeon queue pops, I ding again. Then I’m 120.
---
Now I wonder too.
---
How do I add the [mod:shift] to this?
---
I want to have my middle mouse button be auto attack and I want shift+middle mouse to be swap items all on one macro button. Then I want to be able to add mod:alt but I can get that if I understand adding mod:shift
---
No chance. Hunter has way more kiting potential
---
lmao.. GL killing a rogue who's not afraid to pop his cooldowns
---
All-in-all, very new player friendly, as long as you like hard-to-kill support characters. Their abilities are powerful and straightforward. 
---
Paladin is very strong in many situations, and is quite fun to play if you either like to heal or are cool with often waiting for the next auto attack while looking at other options and anticipating danger. 
---
It has a lot of leeway for new players, due to very high survivability through heavy armor, healing, and the strongest defensive cooldowns in the game. The main problem for new players is they have ZERO ranged (unless undead/demon, so it doesn't help while learning).
---
Their damage is limited because they don't have any Weapon attack abilities... but this allows you to support your allies more, and lets you have room to think and see the battlefield and your health and the status of your allies, etc. 
---
In endgame, it will be harder to compete for damage (both spots in groups, and to keep up with others), but it can be very fun and is quite good in PvP. Tanking, which is already the hardest thing to do without prior knowledge of game mechanics, is difficult as a Paladin, due to a variety of reasons but mostly no Taunt ability to force enemies to hit you. 
---
Healing is where they shine. They have very strong, efficient heals, and their defensive and support abilities are the envy of all other healers. Extremely good at healing all content, always. You are a powerhouse of back-to-back quick heals, and probably the hardest thing for other players to kill.
---
Hard agree.
---
I LOVE it :D Open a blog, man :)
---
I can confirm, I have alt f4ed and quit the game many times, even during peak time with queues, to add or remove addons. You get a short time frame to reconnect with no queue time.
---
I *think* I read P5 somewhere. Can't source it though.
---
Hmm, I can’t find the rule about not posting guild names.
---
*Can’t have problems with Growl in dungeons if you don’t have it trained* 200 IQ plays
---
There is no devs for classic. The devs are retail devs. Bug fixes have been so slow because they've been working on the new retail patch.
---
Every once in awhile, when the stars align, I get to dps instead do of tanking as a fury warrior
---
yep and for the longest time it didnt work on private servers its somewhat recent that they made it so u can use noggen in shift form
---
Most subs this one included also believe in "name and shame" though before removing said names so...
---
I just want the Master Builders Shirt from fineous Darkvire
---
Amazed, mainly.
---
Not to mention, you need some kind of "pre-pre-raid" gear. I mean, you can't just magically get your preraid gear, if an upgrade drops, you roll for need and thats it. I've had several people saying "can I roll for this? it's an small upgrade" or something like that. Bro, if you need, you need.
---
Oof, thats a yikers. Keep showing how mentally incapable you are buddy. Funny to see that after being put in your place you now have to resort to low effort trolling. I know it's embarrassing to be publically displayed as the garbage monkey player that you are, but hey there is still bfa for players like you.

It SeEmS LiKe I aLsO hAcKeD HiS TwITteR huuuh
---
Again, you suck, b2bfa bud. We dont need you in classic.
---
Dungs lol
---
Mage - lowest upkeep ( repair; food); best cc; strong solo questing; quickest traveling around the world (biggest reason); best pve ranged; good pvp; demanded in dung groups
---
They're working on the new retail patch isn't it obvious? Classic has no permanent dev team.
---
Oh! Turns out if you play UD rogue you're the scum of the earth. Oh we all knew that already.
---
Because he assumed his employee was taking notes on his notepad during a Conference? 
---
As he probably should have done?
---
 Okay, remind me never to hire you.
---
I mean... as a rogue I do a ton of work, maybe more than you would realize.  Depending on how bad the group is it’s a lot more work.  I’m constantly sprint Kicking dangerous out of range casters, stun locking bad spells or dangerous mobs, blinding loose mobs on the way to the healer, netting or gouging extra mobs that patrolled into a moron, marking patrols, pushing damage right up to the threat limit, occasionally evasion tanking and kiting, and vanishing at the last second when shit hits the fan with jumper cables xl for a wipe recovery. 
---
That being said if the tank needs a summon(or anyone) I’m cool with that, I like bringing a warlock for the ss and to replace a member if they leave it’s just another summon.
---
Honestly the best way to find a great guild is to either check your server forums and find a guild that suites your play style and times, or to just continue playing as you are. I found a lot of great people and made many connections while dungeoning with PUGs. Although I had a guild lined up, there were a few that I would have been really interested in joining. You will for sure come across some friends with a similar play style and may get an invite to a guild this way!
---
Mount you want to grind 1000G all over again!!!!! No way jose
---
How is lvling as a holy paladin? I've been playing ret pali while lvling and learning that their dps compared to other classes is low. Is it best to wait til 60 to switch to holy? (lvl 41 rn)
---
Sounds like they're being sarcastic, wouldn't think to much of it. Funny hoe people overreact on reddit without knowing the full story or maybe other important context and jump on shaming a whole guild. (no I'm not part of this guild nor play on that server)
---
/join Lookingforgroup

/Leave lookingforgroup

Just toggles the channel on and off. Basically your poor mans LFG tool :)
---
What leather?
---
Congrats! It’s awesome to see all the guilds willing to help and contribute!
---
No not in classic
---
But I hit cap while doing 3 pulls and killing boss when he’s alone. I Don’t get the point of trying to speed it up more
---
Thanks! Never thought to check raid settings
---
There will be exact same amount of people after layering is removed. 
---
What leather did you farm?
---
That's exactly what I have done for 2 weeks now.
---
10% is max discount for now
---
How does that make you feel?
---
Hunters can solo arena.
---
Death roll is when one person does, say, /roll 1-420, then the second does 1-(whatever the first person rolled), and so on. Whoever gets 1 loses. Basically russian roulette.
---
I guess agree to disagree
---
Healer in the streets, PvP nuker in the sheets.
---
PvE wise in very high demand as a healer that can drop WF, fire res, fear cleanse. No one complains if you show up in 5 man content as well.
---
PvP wise: 30/0/21 shaman is something to fuck with if you ever see its hands glow blue. It's capable of delivering 3 full damage spells in a single batching tick, followed by a 4th 1.5 seconds later. Without crits in pvp stam gear that's at least 2000 damage. And the 3 spell combo is up every 3.5 seconds. They also purge, interrupt, and have spell and fear neutralizing totems.
---
This is why I don't understand why people are rushing through the game as fast as they can and only want the best. "New" content isn't going to be released forever. I can understand wanting to keep up with the latest phase's raids but limiting yourself to "BiS" is going to really limit your options and playstyle.
---
And this is why the alliance and the horde don’t get along
---
This picture has to be fake, a horse in North Korea would be anorexic with flies all around it like an undead mount.
---
I just did this, then grouped with a hunter. Still no pet health or portrait.
---
How about rl? Dont try to fill voids with wow. It wont work
---
I learned most of those and still got my mount right after I dinged 40, even though I regularly bought gear on AH
---
Resto. Resto druids are by far my favorite healer to play. And since im a druid, i can always change later on if  i feel like it, maybe cat dps 😆
---
VAN CLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEF.......REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Run it again!
---
Also, there are 5 quests there and some of them reward pretty good gear. Make sure you complete the Defias brotherhood quest chain before your next run. It involves a lot of running around delivering messages to different NPCs and then killing the Defias messenger. You'll be rewarded with one of the following:
---
Caster staff
---
Melee dps leather chest
---
Melee dps mail pants
---
Either of which are sure to be an upgrade to your current gear. Anyway, happy hunting!
---
It’s because alliance players have no shame but ok
---
oh nice but how do they deal with the beatles?
---
What level are you?
---
The point is people have options, they just don't like them and would rather pretend to be victims. They/you hold the keys to your own prison, let yourself out anytime you feel like it.
---
We've been playing less than 2 months, I'm not going to pretend like it's the end of of the world to reroll if it means having fun again. We've all done it, but all done it many times but somehow it's a big deal if it happens to you.
---
Alright, but the quests are kinda a one run deal. Is there something similar to ZF GY runs? Or a chain of bosses that are efficient do to multiple times?
---
There was a guy named Ralphtauren in my guild and he was the only druid on the raid team, if this is you why did you abandon free loot?
---
Indeed. I’m trying to keep an open mind, then I play for a while, develop a bias against undead rogues, warlocks, mages, tauren druids... and then I realise that I’m an idiot and confirmation bias got me again. The cycle repeats itself over and over.
---
Hunters can cheese it
---
Is there any way to move the casting bar? In Retail I used to use MoveAnything to push the bar upwards since right now it rest halfway on top of my three bars layout.
---
If you actually pay attention to the story. A lot of quests are just more entertaining either by having a cool lore connection or by having some funny dialogue and actions. Cata is when they were able to add all the weird and fun quest objectives that they experimented with in BC and wrath. I mean. I bring up Redridge again. It’s a A-Team style story getting your group of buddy’s together to take on the invading orc army. Gotta make a homemade gully suit. Run a metal gear solid style stealth and assassination mission. Then ride a tank that was airdropped in for you to destroy the blackrocks in droves. Then ending with a final confrontation on a cliff with the big baddie of the area. 
---
My perfect quest experience would be the interconnected zone experience of classic combined with the long zone wide story chains of later expansions.
---
Might be my buddy, he has the name Ayy and the guild lmao
---
Nice Post. Take my upvote! 
---
Regards a Holy Priest.
---
Because classic was a lazy cash grab and the only reason they did this Legion frankenstein monster client instead of just putting the original client and server code out there is because they would have had to maintain multiple server infrastructures which would have cost them more money in the long run.
---
In other words, lazy ass cash grab. Anyone who gives Activision cock suckers money deserves the shit they get.
---
I used to do this on private servers.   But it requires shafowforge key.   When you enter the instance open the gate to the left and you should be able to solo the single fire elemental.  Head towards Bael and away from the arena/garrison.  Kill the dog on the right side of the tunnel and wait for the pats to pat towards bael.  You can pull the fire elemtnal pats and kill them for essence of/elemental fire.   Put pet away/on stat and head to the double doors.   As long as your 60 you can avoid aggroing every dwarf pack.
---
For the two packs of fire elementals you can split pull them with your pet if you time everything right.  I usually pull with aim shot and send my pet in just before it goes off.  As soon as your pet gets one hit in, feign death.   The other elemental should lose aggro while the close one goes onto your pet.   After the first 2 dui packs you will probably need to trap one while pet tanking the other.   Once you get to incendious it's just a matter of doing the lava jumping to the black forge and soloing the elemental by it.  But if you screw up lava jumping your gonna have a bad time lol.
---
Nekrage and his trash zerg guild are notorious for entering new MMOs and using pure numbers to try to win. They'll 50v10 another guild and claim it as some great victory. They're always seen as a joke by everyone else on whatever server they're on.
---
Uh... it's always been faction ques. If you mean server only ques, it wont happen. It was bad after the first few months of launch and Blizz knows it
---
I would personally download Questie and only turn on the ability to show quests for your appropriate level range on the map (you can select the levels, I choose up to 5 lvls below and only 4 lvls above). This gives you the opportunity to see any quests that may be out of the way, but doesn't ruin the immersion and adventure feel by telling you exactly where to complete each and every quest. 
---
I feel like this is the best of both worlds, as you still need to read quest texts in order to know where to go for quests, but you don't miss out on any of those "off the beaten path" quests because your map will show that there is a quest to check out.
---
Exactly how I would have interpreted that response. And priest is the class I am most experienced with.
---
Maybe, but not necessarily. If everyone who farms leather now keeps doing it, they'll all be on the same layer, so their will be less to farm (technically). That being said, leather is almost never worth a lot. You can almost vendor it and it won't make a huge difference.
---
Wait... Is she older than irl greta
---
He was the only other person in the party that could use the item, and it’s not BiS for anyone
---
Yea reddit is very brainwashed echo chamber, I really just wanted an interesting discussion but instead they all got butthurt
---
Yes actually :o
---
check any logs where boss doesn't die in under a minute ill bet you anything on fights like geddon, shazzrah, luciferon, magmadar etc the pet is doing next to no dps.
---
My problem with the quick setup is that the 3 options of  tank/melee dps, healer, caster dps presets all look the same. It isn't like retail where they are all unique.
---
Thick and Rugged
---
I did though... I never did the rush through quests thing. I still liked very little of the new zones. But the caravan was one of the few i really really liked.
---
I get 19 a lot.
---
Hmm I’m on a train right now so I can’t test for myself, I know it does work. Are you using party frames? Like the same as player frame with a portrait for everyone, or raid frames? Pets show up for me in raid frames as about a half sized bar at the bottom of everyone else. The party frames should also show but I forget how. Check the left hand side of your screen while in a party, there should be a little pop out menu near the party with options. Try unlocking the frame and making it bigger.
---
Can't stand these types of players. They expect everyone to just sit in greens and not take any upgrades unless it's BiS. "Go farm sgc", that shit could take months
---
Yep, still have to run to a mailbox which can be too far away for it's worth.
---
You should have yelled before the roll....
---
Please don't bring politics into here. We don't need to start fighting about a climate change activist teenager, it has nothing to do with WoW.
---
It took me me 4 tries to find the guild I mesh with. The worst thing you can do is stay somewhere you don’t feel like one of the guys because of sunk cost fallacy. Meeting the right ppl makes it a pleasure to log in each day to see familiar faces,  and I don’t know that I’d still be logging if I didn’t find that.
---
The attack power reduction from screech reduces incoming damage a lot meaning you don't need to stop to heal anywhere near as much. A pet with standard damage is likely doing somewhere around 40% of your damage. A cat with +10% only increases your total damage output be about 3% which means you'll be killing mobs less than a second faster while taking significantly more damage.
---
And of all the things to tell him to farm it's the chest piece. 
---
He's an idiot. 
---
Literally one of the hardest pre-BiS pieces to farm up just due to how unlucky you get with arena runs, and he's just like "just farm it dude."
---
Every zone is just alive with people and pvp encounters are random social interaction on Classic. If there wasn't such a big discrepancy in the vitality of the open world between that and the empty theme park of retail I would play both but for now theres simply more comparison. Also, the writing quality nosedived real hard during cata. I love the simplicity and gravity of the old quests.
---
Internet janitors always have a stick up their ass.
---
Lol you're a priest just heal. It's extremely easy.
---
Very udderated
---
Ayy Lmao
---
Haha that guy murders people.
---
How is that in any way shape or form a stupid argument?
---
Uuuvan is a ninja he stole edgemasters from me and he spit on my mother's grave.
---
If you are gonna afk, just log out. Otherwise it’s free game. Whenever I go afk I either risk it and hide behind a tree or log out.
---
“Do not encourage others to harass individuals or organizations”
---
Basically taking advantage of really weird Line-of-sight mechanics in one specific spot. There's one spot on the edge of the arena you can climb ontop of one of the gates,  but leave your pet on the ground.
---
It's not about being fast, it's about being efficient.i dont mind waiting.  There is a difference. If the tank needs 10 seconds for aggro that's a tank problem and kind of the same as a dps not waiting at all. It doesnt let the group as a whole do their job. But I guess tanks do no wrong and everyone has to bow to their every whim, screw that.
---
i havent played retail since warlords and i never will again
---
Yes GMs will give out warnings for first offense. I believe they will ban if they get caught on second offense.
---
That's not all I did to your mother's grave ;)
---
Is there a way to search for tye value of an item outside the AH using TSM? I'm syncing with the desktop app.
---
&gt;In a later phase, for people to learn how to smelt elementium, they have to learn it from a mob that you mind control.
---
That's the coolest shit.
---
Gotta run to the mailbox.
---
Perfect response. I take anything I can get..I passed on HOJ as a Hunter when a warrior was there because he was a good guy, but I absolutely will take HOJ if I get the chance
---
I donno. It its owned by a pudgy tyrant dont you think he might spare some oats for a mount after spending 90 gold to have it?
---
I'm glad you are enjoying your shirt! -Lacoste
---
I only do the video game part. I dont actively roleplay as a female much like most people playing female characters.
---
Starting classic soon can you please tell me what a shard is?
---
Install bootcamp and play on Windows.
---
I've found that vanish usually fails if I pop it while mobs are all around me still. For instance while pickpocketing the ring of law, a mob resists, they all swarm, I vanish in the middle and they detect me right aware. 
---
However if you use sprint to put some distance between yourself and the mobs it's much more consistent, at least in my experience.
---
It’s even harder as a healer. Healers usually are involved in the forming of groups and usually there is little use for a second.
---
Tanks are rare indeed but dps isn’t too bad. It’s just not an auto join like a tank/dps is.
---
I'd say its THE mmo for a noob, previous posts have already summed up a lot of what I'd say, but I'd just add that wowhead.com is your friend, there are a few really helpful addons (Questie, in particular), and the great thing is the game has been out a long long time, so you can use google fu to easily fill in the blanks for most of the rest!
---
Not on a PvP server lmao
---
Hahaha, designer crafts in WoW. Now I’ve seen everything. “Oh nice boots, but mine are made by FurtKnocker”
---
I'll single target skull for a few seconds then aoe if aggro seems good.
---
My brother swears by this story:
---
Back in Vanilla, before the dressing room, he would let people try shirts on, with a holding fee, and if they didn’t like it, they could trade back and get their money back.
---
After a couple days of posting in IF, a GM whispered him asking what was up with this method, he explained it and why it worked, as most people kept the shirt.  GM thanked him for his time and the next patch we got the dressing room.
---
For a world drop that's incredibly low. It's among hundreds of possible drops, not a set of just a few items like boss loot.
---
What a shittard mage
---
yeah man chill out! just a small indie company, don't push them!
---
This is nonsense
---
Who the hells thex

*Laughs in Shadowform*

I just thought it was funny that WoW has a character fighting for the environment named Greta, no politics intended :)
---
Sold that pattern for 20g first week of classic.
---
That’s the name of my all Orc Jimmy Buffet cover band
---
Just sell it why wait
---
Zandalar is great. There's plenty of PVP and horde can put up a good fight, there's also lots of city raiding.
---
RP has its own unofficial layer right now, I've not engaged in it too much, but I'm told there is a healthy scene.
---
Almost everyone and their mother is raiding, I'm not sure how easy it is to get a spot but plenty of guilds are raiding, several with multiple teams.
---
If you'd like to know anything specific about Zt, just ask.
---
Your a mage. Lol wut. Don't be upset it's not easy mode
---
I just run around naked until I get my bis

&gt; i didnt realise they were all in one guild

The giant tags over their heads didn't give it away?

I personally just skipped the Runecloth bag and kept making belts if I remember correctly

---
My experience was similar; started as rogue, dps was my goal. I would just walk a fine line with my threat level...and sometimes that was bad. 
---
Then went holy priest. imo is the opposite of dps, the role that keeps the group alive lol playing heals didn't really give any new perspective; other than the understanding that heals decides if you "live or die" when in "desperate times"...not the least of which are dps being idiots  :)
---
Then went pally tank (was wotlk at that point) and wow its my favorite role by far. It's fun fighting to keep aggro, doing good pulls. It also gave me the perspective of how difficult it can be for a pally tank to regain aggro...not sure of other tank specs  
---
Oh and playing heals before tank I knew to basically treat the healer like a princess; keep an eye on them and don't let them get hurt lol heals were always the "primary" target for me.
---
He is a douchebag.   Im a dps warrior and I took it over what I had too.   Ive since won the mail chest with 8str 8 stam 2% crit and only use valor when tanking.   Ive done around 180 arena runs at this point and only seen gorosh 1 time.  Farming for scg is maddening.  Only reason im still farming for it is because of just how long it will actually last.
---
Ayy lmao
---
Item rack evocation event.... Bind sets.... Easiest thing ever.
---
I got a bigger chuckle out of OP dying right after getting the ad, as if the brazenness of it just killed him
---
is there currently a macro that works that is similar to /run BuyMerchantItem(4,1)? it doesnt seem to be working in classic
---
Well...how many did you buy?
---
Jesus man, just dump that crap.  I thought you were maybe hoarding devilsaur.   Thick and rugged is vendor trash.
---
Reliable burst for pvp.  Reliable steady for pve.

Ugh. Imbeingcerial, go buy World of Warcraft, install it on your computer, and join the online sensation before we all murder you.

(For legal purposes, the murder portion is a joke.)

I apologize overlord of the subreddit, i shall proceed to remove this post that hurts your eyes and annoys your greatness.

1,408,000 total items
---
70,400 stacks of 20
---
Even if every major guild on a server has a couple thousand stacks, and everyone’s main focus in phase 5 is opening the gates, I highly doubt it will take less than a week.
---
yeah, you're clearly a good example. typical casual with limited knowledge and experience in the game has not realized all the bugs and changes and thus they must not exist or are not of relevance. nice contribution
---
Vendor it
---
I BLESS THE RAINS DOWN IN AFRICA
---
I just dual wield tank and slap a shield on for tough mobs. Valor set was a good investment.
---
We are one, we are thex. Everyone is Thex
---
There’s nothing stupid about denying enemies an advantage on a PvP server.
---
I agree; I find it's a more "sophisticated" form of dps lol
---
So you're expected to play with quest reward gear and only swap out when a BiS drops? lol,   that was just an elitist idiot, don't even waste you're time thinking about that warrior.
---
Why don't you just ignore it if you don't like it
---
Druid - being more flexible than stretch Armstrong. Getting away from lvl 60s in cat form with potting and clever use of terrain. Earlier I drowned a 8 level higher Tauren warrior by rooting him at the bottom of a lake.
---
Wouldnt play with him again.

Dont stack spirit on anyone but priests. Spirit kinda sucks in classic. It's good on priests cus they have talents the work with spirit. The only benifit from spirit on a rouge is a little out of combat regen. If your out of combat and need health eat food. If you want a little more health regen get a troll pot.
---
Rouges have talents and abilities that work of agile and str. So stacking thoes will give you more benifit. Ex. 
---
Spirit - small amount of out of combat regen.
---
Agi  - crit, hit, and scales with abilities.
---
Always go with the stuff that gives you multiple benifits.
---
Also in classic consumables are crazy strong op broken. Use them.
---
Finaly max out fishing and cooking itll give you way more benifit than spirit stack ever will.
---
Ally or horde? I'm horde, haven't seen them, so assuming ally... but it doesn't seem like there are more than 50 alliance players on the whole server so.
---
I have to tank more than I want to because Tanks end up d/cing, leaving for emergencies, bailing etc. all the time. When you are in the middle of a dungeon and no one wants to join you, or there are no tanks even looking for that dungeon period, the options are disband or sack up and jank tank the rest the best you can.
---
Point being, I speak from experience when I say, as the other guy said, I end up in leather and mail pieces and get hit for quite a lot, it puts a lot of stress on the healer and sometimes a few extra links that are absolutely no problem for a proper tank become an absolute nightmare and even cause a wipe for a DPS tank. The reason melee cleaves work is because threat bounces between the warriors and it's a little easier to heal that way, the same isn't true of a single one holding threat on too many mobs the entire time.
---
If you want to remove gear sets from the argument, but still follow my point, then demanding that an ele shaman main heal would still be an appropriate analogy. Same of a Boomkin, though I'm going to be realistic here, I swear to god I haven't seen one fucking Boomkin since launch.
---
Pointless post.  You weren’t even the first roll in the list.  The 99 came before you.  Nothing was even riding on your 98 roll.
---
Hey we did this on Atiesh a few weeks ago! Lot of fun, and a lot of death! We did a raid of Thralls Throne. So we started in the starting area, over to Loch Modan, Badlands, Searing Gorge, Black Rock Mountain, Burning Steppes, Redridge Mountain, Duskwood, STV, boat to Ratchet, north to Durotar, and then into Orgrimmar!
---
No spell batching was just be part of the net code and server capability they had. It was a result of the inferior hardware that was available at the time.
---
Lacoste - Netherwind here. I appreciate the kind words. I will be in Ironforge most of the day, mention the reddit post and I'll take 1 gold off for a price per shirt of 3 gold. Own the best shirt money can buy!

---
It's the key ring ffs. You get 6 bank/bag slots or something, big deal, priority contend. It's kinda nice, but do you actually give a shit? 
---
And btw you're probably just one of those lvl 43 hunters complaining that classic is moving too slow. Everyone else is enjoying the game.
---
Read this as do not do drugs.  Sorry for the down vote.
---
Smolderweb - life is good
---
o, then your issues is not looting the mobs. Getting hit simply doesn't cause enough damage on average to outweigh the gold looted,
---
I spent 12 hours in DM when it released, and the first Dusty Tome we found all day had the book in DM East. On our way to it a Glowing Brightwood Staff dropped, and the last boss dropped a SECOND book all in the same run.
---
Either the drop rate is bugged or we just got REALLY lucky.
---
Hemo/Cold Blood is fun.

Something like this. Feel free to change things around as you see fit.

Thank you for adding this comment to prove that you don’t value his time.

Cut him some Slagg, he gets looked down upon by the warriors so give him that atleast.
---
Dis enchanting good items gives enchanting materials needed for high level enchants
---
As a hunter my focus stats while leveling have been agility first, stamina and spirit if it's convenient for regen. Im almost 40, does attack power do anything for me?  I saw a hunter with duel weapons have that, but no secondary stat so  I wasn't sure.
---
Let me explain like you’re five: I’m a tank so I make the rules. You’re a DPS so you follow my rules.
---
i appreciate your thoughtful comment! thanks for the reply :) i agree with ya. the last statement i also agree with but as a orc lock i can win most mirror matches versus an UD just by first baiting out wotf with fear or seduce first. this is besides the point but wotf isnt a godsend vs locks or priests and what not. def nice to have but theres workarounds gotta remember wotf only lasts 5 secs. thx for your thoughtful comment again btw
---
Because they’re dumb
---
Alliance
---
He means Large Brilliant Shard from disenchanting the item. They are only worth 2 to 3g so it would probably be better to vendor than disenchanted but the dude was just being an a-hole.
---
Good riddance!
---
classiccastbars lets you do that
---
Yeah this is honestly how it is grouping with most warriors so far. Even taking leather or agi weps are often bitched at. Hunters went from a meme of rolling on everything to not being allowed to roll on anything
---
hey im not the smartest person lmfao
---
I got the human mask as a night elf and every time I look at it I crack up.  
---
*Hello, fellow humans.*, I say.  But no one gets the damn joke.

horde!
---
Go play retail u fucking cry babies!(this mage and people like him) People who expect perfection in classic should just go back to running mythic plus where there's a legit reason to not wipe. If you cant deal with dying one time in classic then you're gonna have a bad time.
---
Tbh depends if you have gathering professions you actively farm or not.  If not and you do actively farm anything, I would buy the items first.  If you are like me and you just run a crapton of dungeons, you will make the money bag in a way that epic mount really doesnt help much.
---
What I do is open battle net in the background and launch a new version of wow. Once that new version is logged in to the character screen it boots the old version and you can login. I did this during heavy queue times to install adobe
---
I have never seen it drop yet atlas loot says it should now I understand why lol
---
There are plenty of these what I call em entitled classic players which I assume comes from private servers
---
This is not retail, a paladin gets no bonus from matching all plate gear.  If he mains heals and it’s an upgrade to his healing ability, it’s a fair roll.
---
UPDATED! \^\^

Shadow Priest: People not expecting that you deal pretty sick damage (little do they know I pop so many Major Mana Potions)
---
A lot of people enjoy playing in Min/Maxxed gear.  It isnt a question of if its needed or not.
---
Found the whiny shit tank
---
Can Item Rack switch weapons in combat ?
---
The act of playing wow itself turned political a couple weeks ago, so pretty much literally everything is. Maybe just don't get so mad about it?
---
Nah you should AH them. They both sell well because of different gold making schemes with leather working. Thick gets turned into nights 
---
cape tunics which is something like 10g per hour just vendoring. And rugged has a few different ones like d/eing wicked head bands.
---
But yeah I agree with the sentiment. Just sell. The price for thick and rugged is pretty much always the same.
---
By that logic though you wouldn’t be taking advantage of the 5 sec rule. Isn’t the mana regen more important than the off chance of a slight boost in healing. Does a phase 1 priest with bis even have enough int to make it worthwhile to abandon the 5 second rule and bank on a crit heals instead?
---
Yes, but do you already have one? If not lmk your IGN and I'll cod one \^\^

---
Devilsaur is what, like 200g?  Gold comes in so fast it really doesn't matter.  Just get it to help your raid out.  
---
You don't need it.  Just like you don't need everyone to use consumables or to show up on time and not AFK.  But it's a hell of a lot better doing MC in a single 1.5 hour raid than it is doing it in 2 3 hour blocks. 
---
You do it to make it easier and a better experience for everyone, because when everyone tries hard, it is just a more satisfying experience.
---
It’s a meme
---
Why did I choose Magram?  I liked the way the name sounded.  
---
Gelkis sounds stupid.
---
Believe he was on Countdown to Classic (podcast). And I think he grabbed Thex on his server.
---
Can you put this on YouTube lol it won’t work for me on reddit for some reason
---
Depends on realm.  Many realms you are borderline losing money after fees on the AH.  If you’re on a realm where there is a profit margin over vendor price, yeah, dump em there, but either way, they are not something that’s ever going to bring in a huge profit.
---
Did you not watch machinima in vanilla?  Trailers are very common.  Sometimes years before the video.  ::cough::  illegal Danish ::cough::
---
What an interesting.
---
Simple supply an demand. I would reserve it before I went though actually.
---
To whoever's talking about banning the guy, are you sure he is in a spot where the guards cannot reach him? Or perhaps he is just out of the aggro range of guards? They have an aggro range just like any other mob.
---
Go aoe grind in dalson's tears and move to hearthglen after that. It's pretty good money and nuts for xp/hr. Zf graves can wait.
---
There's a lot of downtime and travel time. The skill cap is pretty low so if you feel like you are pretty good and competent at other games, you may find that you don't really improve yourself in this game (ie getting better at playing it) but rather you simply improve your character by spending time.

The virtual immortality of being a Warlock. With careful management, I only die when I either: a) get cocky and try taking on too many enemies, or b) just bad luck or carelessness like when I wasnt paying close attention and ran directly into a mob of elite Scarlet Crusade NPCs in the EPL while completely unprepared.
---
Not wanting our planet to burn is very controversial. Didn't you know?
---
Someone last week said in our guild that once Dire Maul released, so many BiS items would be obsolete.
---
Not “not as good to a very fine margin”, but **obsolete**. As if the stats wouldn’t exist or something.
---
A Fury Warrior said that Truestrike was BiS till AQ. He also complained about dying in raids. Likely because his gear offers no stamina at the moment because he’s a Warrior in leather almost exclusively.
---
All this, and we’ve cleared MC. So what exactly is the major issue? We kill Lucifron in like 1 minute 20 seconds and not 1 minute 17?
---
Lol!  Good for you.  My favorite is the warlocks who demand I top them off with heals when they life tap.  If I have a mage provide water I don’t mind as much but when I don’t it’s like they want me to spend my coin instead of them buying drinks for themselves.  Haha.   Also...you pull aggro and then expect me to keep you up?  Nope, stay under the tank.
---
Just making sure, 9% is the hit cap goal correct?  I'm currently a Human Combat Sword Rogue that just hit 9% with only 4 pieces of +hit gear (Satyr's Bow, Blackstone Ring, Devilsaur Set).  If 9% is enough and there's no reason to go past that, I'm thinking I should skip the other pieces of +hit preBIS gear and try to find stuff with +AP or +Agi instead.  Also thinking I should try to farm 2x Tarnished Elven Rings and replace the Satyr's Bow with a Precisely Crafted Boomstick (or other +Agi Ranged) if I can find one cheap.
---
Also thinking I should focus on getting Eye of Rend instead of the Mask of Unforgiven.  Only thing I'm wondering is what alternative I should look for on Shoulders.  Both Truestrike and Wyrmhide have +2% hit (which would put me at 11% hit), but I don't see what I would put in their place.  Maybe skip the Elven Rings for a Magni's Will and and Painweaver instead?  I'm currently using Phytoskin Shoulders (+16 Agi, +10 Sta, +10 Nature Resist).
---
Any thoughts?
---
You and the tank should have kicked them
---
The RP is strong in this!
---
&gt;Frost mages are the chillest of all
---
Literally, yes :-)
---
So I might as well just do it all myself or is there a short cut?
---
Something similar happened today as well, but they didn't use the terrain. They were simply such a high level that they could literally stand inside Gadgetzan and kill people, without aggroing the guards... Wtf?
---
The worst part is that you are unable to fight back at all, because then YOU will aggro the guards...
---
I can't believe you went to a Master Loot UBRS to be honest.
---
“I like disc/holy because I never have to drink”
---
&gt; ur doing it wrong

&gt; I drink every pull before the tank grabs agro

Dude what even are you trying to say?

Yes D’:
---
    #showtooltip Entangling Roots
---
    /clearfocus [button:2] [target=focus,dead][target=focus,noexists]
---
    /focus [target=focus,noexists]
---
    /stopmacro [target=focus,noharm]
---
    /cast [target=focus] Entangling Roots
---
replace "entangling roots" with a CC spell of your choice (Like "Polymorph" or "Hex")
---
click the  button to cast hex, or whatever, and it'll cast it on your target - And add that target as a focus target. click again, and it'll cast it to your focus target, regardless of what you're currently targetting 
---
I'm honestly not 100% sure if this macro works on classic. but ive used it for years on retail and currently play a class with no CC.
---
oh btw, right click on the button to clear focus.
---
Thanks for explaining!
---
Whats questie exactly?
---
I wasn’t upset or anything just curious even with the other attributes going to waste
---
Yeah I’m over 110 arena kills and have seen Gorosh 3 times total.
---
So... The first time I heard bio was watching some streams. I then learned what it means and got used to people using it.
---
WC is a common way to label the bathroom anywhere (restaurants etc.) in my country.

But. This is the first time I learned it means water closet. So. Thank you I guess.

I just wanted to clarify that some parts of the world use "WC" without ever thinking of it as a water closet.
---
I do this once a week since I hit 60. All little the hordies get pats and hugs except for the UD Rogues getting a shadow bolt up their ass.
---
That's the punishment for abandonning your pet!!!
---
Sounded like the guy selling the port was going to give it to him for free if he lost and wouldn’t sell it if he won.
---
Wow! I was in this guild on Thunderfury and got kicked last week after being offline for less than a week. I logged in and was just no longer in the guild. It made me feel pretty bad haha.
---
What’s crazy is that the guild started out as a destination for “Old Farts” who have real life responsibilities and can’t play all the time.
---
I'm so glad my ignore list is so short. I haven't come across too many people that make me go "fuck that guy, I'm never running with him again."
---
The only two people I added to ignore so far are
---
1) The guy that kicked me from ZF for no reason and then called me the "stupidest person he ever met."
---
2) A guy that spent the whole time in BRD sexually harassing our tank in PM's
---
Youre supposed to take tactical mastery for every fury dps spec as well.
---
That sounds great. So from what you've said I can assume it's leaning towards majority alliance population? and which faction do you play?
---
Out of curiosity, have you talked it over with them? If they were apologetic about it then that seems fine, something like “Hey we’re sorry about that, I’m sure it feels bad, but the orcs get a massive bonus from it and you will be able to roll on other drops like swords that they won’t.” Something like that would be perfectly reasonable. But if they’re shady about it or get defensive then it’s definitely more questionable. So I would just be polite and don’t go looking for drama, unless they’re rude or make a habit of excluding you from rolls.
---
Salv is the best dps buff in the game
---
#nochanges
---
I paid 15g for a duo rogue angerforge run. Got it on the first run.
---
How are you running dire maul at level 20?
---
Breastplate of valor is technically more of a tank item than a dps item. That's probably why he reacted the way he did. It's not very good for fury.
---
As someone who has played a lot of MMOs, I think the absolute best one for newbies to the scene is FFXIV. Largely because it has a very gentle learning curve. 
---
For WoW in general I think Retail is probably easier to learn out the gate, but Classic isn’t too bad.
---
Isn't Greta Thunberg like 16 or 17? And wow came out 2004 right?
---
Haha good save - just in case I mysteriously wind up dead this week
---
Mind games is like 600+ members and 90% are brain dead. Avoid the officer jaedan he’s the most toxic player I’ve met in classic.
---
Had the same thing happen in WC the other day. Won the shield. It said I won. But didnt give it to me. I had 26 open slots and even went back to the boss. Nothing.
---
Will it show incoming heals only if every healer has the add on?
---
I play on the most populated US realm and PVP to raid? You must be alliance on a smaller realm with more Horde because this is not true.
---
isn't finishing up the rest of the dungeon with the debuff a real pain the ass tho
---
I've stayed in bad groups in the past - something about the raid lockout just makes me wanna stick around I guess.
---
Thanks haha! You just got another subscriber my dude
---
Heh my raiding guild is clicky as hell. I think they are gonna do some bs loot council/ dkp hybrid thats screwing everyone who doesn't suck up to the GM. They are gonna gear all the leet officers first.
---
There have been a few level 60s quitting over bs loot drama every week and we haven't even started raiding.
---
global warming isn’t real and there is no causal link between co2 and the temperature.
---
Classic plus is gonna be great, am I right?
---
But we can all agree that gnomes are the worst and only serve to be punted, right?
---
Stupid sexy centaur
---
Is that you, Mario?
---
You must not have the right brand/advertisement, because I've made about 300g so far on shirts. But then again, mine are &lt;Made by Mom&gt; and people seem to be really fond of them!
---
Lacoste is a real brand name though...
---
That amazing genius of this:
---
This dude could do this all day and still never pay for a port.
---
Ok, a correction then: It is better for those who play the game like me: Solo.
---
I mostly stay away from dungeons, and things that require groups to complete, because i just can't deal with other people in somewhat stressfull situations.
---
type "/console farclip 200", or which ever value you want.
---
I laughed, sorry.
---
Not even if I gave you a discount?
---
Ah, Neat!
---
But dude shaving 3 seconds off every boss fight in MC saves you like 30 seconds of raid night!!!111!!!one
---
Does downvoting this mean that the tauren is ugly? 🤔
---
Exactly.
---
If you aren't having fun then just don't play lol
---
It's a game not a job
---
I'm Spartacus!
---
She was born 2003, january the 3:rd. So Greta is *slightly* older than the tauren version
---
That guy was delusional and just wanted to let out his daily dose of toxicity.
---
The Valor set is really, really good for normal PvE encounters and even PvP outside of Raids. When I'm not in my hit capped PvE gear, I usually wear Valor Chest/Wrists/Belt/Shoulders. That gives plenty of HP, armor and the 4 set AP bonus. The added agility and spirit on all 4 pieces is also very nice for uptime, and let's face it, the valor set looks fucking cool.
---
There's actually not many other pieces (plate, at that) which you could wear in world pve/pvp. You wouldn't wear your full PvE raid gear outside of raids, because that gear is solely focused on giving you max hit and damage, as opposed to survivability. I get shredded by more than 1 mob if I'm not wearing my outside-PvE gear, let alone PvP encounters.
---
So good job on getting that chestpiece, and don't pay that fool any mind. I'd suggest you buy the valor wrists/gloves and even belt off the AH to get the set bonus right away!
---
How is it dumb? He's making an opposite faction hunter worse at pvp.
---
Classic Dark Souls potato parry
---
Attack Power will increase damage with your Melee Weapons (so if you're weaving, this might be beneficial).  Ranged Attack Power will increase damage with your Ranged Weapons.
---
TO BE FAIR, IT’S PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA FOR EVERYONE TO NEED ALL BOE’S BECAUSE THAT MONEY COULD PROVE BENEFICIAL TO ALMOST EVERYONE IN CLASSIC
---
Look at your reddit name you hypocrite.
---
50+ undead mobs have a chance of dropping a +16 slot holloween bag.
---
I'm at 277 and belts are green right now so i assume they can't me past 280

https://youtu.be/ELAgBaJHsn0
---
Tbh it sounds like you need a new guild, one you feel apart of. The people are what make this game worth playing at the very end of the day.
---
Brutal lol
---
&gt; They also refused to wear or farm anything other than their current BiS gear. 
---
What did they wear?
---
Not bad for pvp, I think.
---
Even if they have been they could have easily overlooked the relevant posts simply because it didn't occur to them at the time.
---
lol are you the 0 IQ guy from op's story or what
---
Then grind beasts. I net about 120 from 32-38 on beasts in deso. May be boring but it gets you mount money and near same xph as questing
---
I wore those items till I was level 40 or something, so definitely worth it!
---
I can certainly argue that being in the majority is better than being 50/50. Many many people want that.
---
Lol I got this whisper last night on Netherwind as well, I was very tempted to buy one.
---
Tribute? Can I have the TLDR?
---
Thank you friend, video next Friday :)
---
Maybe? We do have pause points.
---
This ain't it, chief.
---
Ok. You go live in your weird alternate fantasy and I'll stay here in reality
---
This is classic, what do you expect?
---
You want to ideally stick with one wep type unless you find a huge upgrade so you aren't stuck paying gold for respecs.
---
It’s gulch*
---
Don't feed the trolls
---
Oh fuck that brings me back
---
Sorry but not this year. Doing 2 already is a ton of work and anything EU side is unrelated to me.
---
Yes! Rp!
---
&gt;  if you are giving gear put inefficient it’s a waste of time
---
what does this even mean?
---
You know what a waste of time is? Farming arena 200 times for a chest piece that isn't required to clear current content.
---
Quick, pirate the whole movie theater
---
Yes it's "bannable" in that it's been confirmed through a blue post to be an unintended thing. But from the sounds of it it's usually more they get a warning, or a temporary suspension and then if they continue a ban. But ya it's reportable
---
Mobs can still dodge yellow hits, and gouge requires you to be in front meaning you now have parry to deal with. 
---
If you are hoping that gouge is going to save your team you are already leaving things up to RNG gods far more than a singular 19 tick.
---
I can't easily leave the house. So as good as it can I suppose
---
i have one of these! someone made it for me randomly a few weeks ago when i bought someone else from him. only charged me 40s
---
What addon is that that shows your crit/hit in your character screen?
---
"Bis bis bis bis bis bis bis bis bis bis bis bis bis bis bis bis bis bis bis bis bis bis bis bis bis bis bis bis bis bis bis bis bis bis bis bis bis bis bis bis bis bis bis bis bis bis bis bis bis bis"
---
Aggressive
---
We aren't heading there lol
---
Do you not see the sarcasm?
---
I think they will release BGs early to increase subs. 
---
I could see honorless zones an important add, but nothing too major
---
There is no raid lockout in dungeons
---
\*looks at Venus*
---
I'm looking for something that collects the icons away from the minimap since there's too many on the map. I also use sexymap
---
That’s the retail folks weeding themselves out, the people that actually enjoy classic will stick around and it’ll be back to good stuff
---
Alliance scum...
---
I've never leveled a rogue past like level 2 and had no idea that's what he was for. I always wondered why he was attackable.
---
I'd love to see you there!
---
Rolls don't happen until everyone has selected need/greed, or the timer runs out.
---
The rolls all happened at the same time.
---
My world of nice people.
---
Next year! 💙
---
Someone's regretting rolling on a pvp server.  Try deleting and going to a pve server
---
Its a good server!
---
Someone link that turn around Nigel Thornberry/Little Mermaid gif!
---
It is funny, some people just get crazed about stuff
---
Why so cis about this guy being gay about that guy murdering people?
---
The whole BIS thing is just a fad. Sure you can prove that it would be the best min/max given perfect a scenario. I have so many vanilla first time kills which anchored on my Spirit leveraged darkmoon card: blue dragon priest. This is not a current BIS build, and the items needed are phase 2, and now considered trash. I have regenerated 2million mana during a vanilla twin emps fight and will absolutely build my priest this way again. When 20 tards stand in the fire and die, the 6min fight will now take 12. I can regen an ungodly amount of mana and float the raid beyond projected perfect scenarios. Sure i would keep a power/best gear set in my bags too and augment as needed, but the content is cheese anyways. Just start MC in greens and blues, get gear along the way. No gear needed beforehand. The ability to survive and longevity makes up for a lot of stress and wipes.
---
Oh how fun!
---
Really boring
---
You know, warlocks have been my name. Several of my last runs have had locks tabbing Searing Pain on all mobs.
---
Oh smart!!
---
Do a royal rumble in the DM arena.
---
Have everyone make a warrior, get a friendly lock to summon everyone.
---
Last man standing wins.
---
That’s so selfish and gross.
---
&gt; sweaty egokid
---
I'm using this, lol.
---
Most tanks are gonna want it, too sadly.
---
the joke is flying over your head HARD
---
Exactly.  So nothing was given and taken away.  The 99 is the only roll that mattered.  OP just thinks they’re special for getting a number one less than the winner.
---
Most are flat out lvl 1s
---
I’ve had this happen to me a few times. I think you need to loot the corpse. I’m not sure why is happening - perhaps someone is looting the body that the item is on when you win the roll. Either way, it seems very rare. The 3-4 times it has happened to me, looting the corpse works every time.
---
Anyone who says that better be topping warcraftlogs. I've had people in my guild say it while they were being out DPSd by someone in worse gear.
---
Have a good time!!
---
Escort quest in searing gorge where the escort is killed by the sniper at the end is bugged for Druids. Sumatra’s or something like that is the name. 
---
When he dies he drops a note but if you are in animal forms it does not drop. Did the quest 2 times and had to look on wow wiki to find out what I was doing wrong. 
---
Figured I’d add this to list of bugs.
---
Thank you!!
---
No. I am on one of the most balanced PVP servers, on the faction that is likely more dominant. It is just extremely obvious that there will be long term issues that will kill classic if changes are not made to phase 2. I might have lucked out, but those who did not will almost certainly quit instead of rerolling, especially more casual players.
---
This isn't true. The auto that successfully goes off is not delayed if cast aimed shot immediately before it goes off.
---
I don't play Alliance because I don't like Alliance. I don't like the races, I don't care for the aesthetic. I rolled Horde in 2005, I did it again now. I don't give a flying fuck about having a slight advantage in PVP via racials.
---
Why should I play a faction I don't care for?
---
It’s not luck just research strategy and planning. Don’t plan on spending less. Plan on making more money.
---
Retail got too easy. Those looking for click and win will quit soon enough.
---
Yeah, but if you weren't so cynical for 5 seconds you would understand the humor of the post.
---
Sure thing boss. You kill no bosses except the last boss. They old bosses call you boss. You get different boss loot from the old bosses chest and the bosses you let live give you world buffs that make you feel like a boss.
---
Likely not w/o a US side sub :( we smuggle everyone from the EU onto retail with trials
---
It's only fair, after all, hunters take everyone else's gear!
---
If you want balances go to retail. Everyone knows what they are getting into when coming to classic it's no surprise.
---
Oh that's fun! I don't think its related to the charity project I'm working on :)
---
Dan Mleef*
---
Nah b
---
Awe boohoo he lost an auto roll.  MUST come shit up the Reddit with a stupid screenshot.  But yeah, fuck me for calling him out for over a worthless post.
---
Thus the fun isn’t in clearing it but in clearing it fast...
---
So why are you in there still
---
Bring the rain, bring the ruckus
---
You sound salty. 
---
If someone told you the noble thing to do was drop everything and roll Horde, would you? Probably not, because you clearly don't like them. So why expect others to do the same?
---
50-60 level dungeoning has been really dramatic. Loot drama in every group
---
No loot from SM lib for rogues though, try getting a group for UBRS as a rogue and even then you have to deal with like 5 other people also rolling on truestrike IF they even drop
---
If I have Troll Racial (+5 bows) and Marksman Bands (+2 bows) for a total of (+7 bows) and I'm using Rhok'delar, how much hit modifier do I need for end game raids?
---
&gt; handouts for lazy people
---
You mean gear from the dungeon he just ran?
---
The problem is when the masses leave over horrendous balance, you won't have any one left to PVP with if you are on a one sided server.
---
Meh, plenty of us survived this back in the day. Granted, servers weren’t as dull as they are but the imbalance existed back then too. I rolled PvE this time though because I wanted a smooth leveling experience. Good luck!
---
&gt; There is no reason to join a ubrs run before you have the BRD chest of seven chestpiece
---
This is fucking hilarious.
---
Go outside dude
---
[proof](https://imgur.com/a/R2nYV7w)
---
Grr I rolled on a pvp server but I didn't know there would be pvp plz make less pvp
---
how do you charge  people in real life bro
---
Why do you assume he is from a pserver?
---
they had both majority, and party leader
---
I can taste the salt of your tears by reading this, and in turn my own for the waste of life it caused me
---
How about fuck you, don’t tell me what to do.
---
This sparks joy
---
He's on my server. He's great, but has an interesting past on YouTube.
---
It's fun when you have a bit of wild card in every action you partake. It's fun when mages polymorph each other and it's fun when rogues can cheapshot an already aggroed mob... It's fun when crazy things, that you haven't thought to be possible, happen. If you want wow to be superbalanced and responsive - the retail version is all fresh and good (it is, and 8.3 promises to be great too) and it's waiting for you. Here is classic though, vanilla people've been waiting for this for ten thousand years. Who are you to deny em?
---
Its definitely not a nostalgic trip, but I do plan on going back to retail after I've finished my goals for classic.
---
I still want to do some high end mythic progression on retail, nothing - not even classic - can beat that experience.
---
That makes sense, you've changed my mind.
---
I want more PVP, not less. You won't much PVP if the faction balance issues continue into phase 2.
---
The only way to fix this is the have each faction have its own queue. Probably. Make people move off of lopsided servers.
---
I've noticed it's impossible to get a group for anything unless you start your own, or are a tank. Spam LFG every few minutes? No one invites you. Spam LFM? 8 people whisper you. It feels like everyone is afraid to start their own group if they aren't a tank.
---
On Herod Horde devilsaur is 150~250 for the gloves and 250~350 for the pants and is likely to nearly double in price when we lose our second layer.
---
 Fuck that shit.
---
Lol there’s the politics. One political party denying basic science.
---
I've spoken with him, he rolled on a different server because the queues on Herod. Last we spoke it was around a week ago and he was level 52.
---
Is there a working drain soul macro for deleting your soulshards in the 1st slot of your regular backpack? I refuse to use the soul pouch and each of my other bags are for specific items.
---
As a hunter I think you should get mana burned while shapeshifted.
---
Quite frankly i do not farm bis, i am perfectly happy with ais (adequate in slot) and will roll on anything that I plan on wearing.
---
People who are collecting bis are wasting their tome already imho and i will not refrain from rolling on something that I would wear just because someone thinks they need to have it as their bis.
---
Since a whole political party denies science is real
---
The true classic experience. It's what everyone wanted. Cross realm layering and battlegrounds were the fix to these issues of having horde/alliance heavy realms.
---
I'm bored now.  None of what you want will happen so you're either trolling or omega oblivious.  Bye
---
Epic mount for sure
---
Did a 5 man UBRS today and it was way more fun than aoeing everything down in a 5 man.
---
The short answer is "terrain exploit."
---
Yes, fuck you, lmao. Do you not have very many social interactions?
---
Just the ones that deserve it.
---
There’s a bunch of us with it on Stalagg, but the Bright Yellow Shirt pattern is considerably less rare among horde players (sold from an alliance vendor). I was the only one with the yellow shirt for like the first month of classic, but sadly recently I saw a couple other people selling them and am no longer the sole maker for horde. Profit margin was better than the purple shirts but much less volume moved (1/4 the mats and sold at 1/2 the price of the purple shirts)
---
No one suspects a thing
---
Get help, wtf
---
Why would you need a second healer? It’s still significantly easier to find groups as a healer than dps... I hope you aren’t attempting to change that narrative. I think you may be both underestimating the volume of waiting dps in chat channels vs overestimating the amount of healers that are waiting? I truly don’t know how you concluded this. 
---
I miss my healer from nost pretty badly. Looking as a non mage caster dps (lock) sucks in compared to healers. I won’t hear any suggestion otherwise that healers have it hard lol. Leveling a healer alt as we speak to remedy this very issue.
---
Shadowmeld is amazing in pvp.
---
Whatever they had from questing. For example the rogue refused to roll on Nightbrace tunic when we ran UBRS and I told him to take it because he was convinced he'd just get Cadaverous Armor instead to replace his quest green (it was not that wicked leather armor craftable, something with worse stats). Cadaverous Armor is a rogue preraid BiS item that's notoriously elusive and hard to farm whereas Nightbrace Tunic is incredibly easy to farm as part of the Jed/Rend runs you want to do anyways (takes like 2 minutes longer to do that boss but everyone still wants to skip him because it isn't dropping BiS).  
---
He never got that Cadaverous armor to drop before he quit.
---
You don't lose any fees unless the item doesn't sell.
---
Some reason I doubt the true classic is experience was having every PVP server horde dominant to the point that there are no alliance to PVP with. Most players did not know what was optimal back then, like they do now.
---
🤔
---
Shamans should just be everything blacked other than "totems".
---
What do you have to do when you want to get out?
---
really? most ive ever seen one go for was like 300g
---
Yup. The meta is never upgrade your gear until you get your prebis. Pass on all gear that is not your prebis. If that means running a lvl 58 dungeon in lvl 30 greens, so be it. 
---
The funny thing is they call it efficient.
---
You say no, but you haven't tried stopping them.
---
*wink*
---
Such a loser lmao the self proclaimed hero of making sure every post on Reddit meets your standards
---
Found the Frost Wolf member lmao
---
Its just much worse than every single other racial for PVP (or even PVE) that its almost never optimal to pick a night elf.
---
Went to a pvp server, cries about pvp. Go back too retail
---
Yeah idk, u won't get much sympathy here. Apparently it's your fault for not knowing the future and that your server would become unbalanced. 
---
That being said, same. I'm on an extremely Horde dominant PvP server and the experience is similar -- 8-10 deaths per run into BRD, constant camping, not many alliance to group with so it takes like 1-2 hours to get a group, etc. Dying 30+ times a night isn't out of the question. There isn't much "PvP" about having 40-50 Horde in blackrock mountain to just kill you all the way to the portal every time you rez instantly, but oh well. 
---
I actually recently started a Horde on a dif server and it's been much better for now. May play here til something's done to my main server (if something's done).
---
I can ambush from infront of a mob
---
Most bag add-ons allow you to hide bags, so double check that you've not turned the visibility for one of your bags off.
---
That poor priest having to heal that though
---
hmm looks like that guy just killed you
---
Robe of Archmage Pattern really 10-15% drop rate? Quite high for an Epic.
---
we can see what kinda virgin you are by looking at your recent comments
---
Yup. Also, if you aren't going to poopsock your way to a breastplate of chromatic flight, the Valor is very decent for pvp. There's not a lot of breastplates around.
---
Comparing it to Knight-captain's, you're looking at +6 str, +3 agi, -1 stam, -1% crit on the Knight-captain's Chestguard.
---
Yeah! That's rubbish!
---
Wait a second...
---
For me, it's Tyr's Hand. 
---
I'm a farmer at heart, so i love to see what the different kind of elite mobs there can drop...i can spend hours upon hours checking every building for chests, there's a rare around too. The zone also has black lotus and rich thorium vein spawns as well.
---
And i also adore the vibe Eastern Plaguelands has.
---
I prefer nicely styled bars and I use raven for that check it out
---
The mere CO2 that is released by playing video games without any practical purpose purely for entertainment ...
---
Don't be shocked when PVP servers die out from being too one sided. This issue will also affect queue times in battlegrounds.
---
The sunk cost fallacy is most definately applicable to my situation. Thank you!
---
You’re welcome!  If some of us didn’t, we would just have to put up with bullshit posts like this one all day every day.
---
Your username says it all, sadly.
---
What do you mean by meme class?
---
because it is a goal, something to strive for, you dense idiot. hell, why even get to 60? mc can be cleared at 55-59!!1
---
No no no, FUCK YOU!
---
Of course
---
Well...in the real world nobody likes or defends assholes who have fun annoying people. So much for your real world. PvP Server or not, camping lowbies makes you an ass.
---
Pre-BiS is insanely overrated. If you want to farm a chest that has a 4% drop rate from a boss that spawns 30% of the time, go ahead. But don't expect anyone else to care about it. We're already clearing MC / ony with PUGs and people are getting their raid gear.
---
Wanting to shard an item when someone wants it just because it's not pre-BiS is just crazy.
---
&gt;Where do you get the notion that pservers are full of assholes?
---
&gt; I ran in to them all the time playing those servers
---
&gt; Sounds like something you just read and accepted rather than experienced yourself.
---
Still struggling?
---
&gt; I ran in to them all the time 
---
&gt; playing those servers
---
No one knows other than the server moves that have already been allowed.
---
Imagine being on a lowpop realm lmao
---
You can easily modify the macro out there on warlock guides
---
You posted this exact same thing 14hrs ago
---
I'm assuming your answer to my question was "No no no", correct?
---
Hand of justice duo rogue farm. any tips, experiences?
---
While leveling I'm usually only in the group for the quests. Losing the bow would suck but my thought process would be "oh well, at least I'll get the last boss kill for my quest, I can stick it out and never come back"
---
Getting booted at the end like that I probably would've lost it.
---
yeah so its lose lose for him. he either makes no money and no port or loses money making a free port
---
How are wolves as pets for hunters? I never see anyone with one. 
---
I am leveling a hunter to imitate a character from a book I like. She has a pet wolf so that's what I'm wanting to have. 
---
Where is the first place a NE can tame a wolf?
---
Oof you angry....
---
If the question was do we need horse shit threads like this, then yeah, that’s the correct answer.
---
It also applies to, did I ask for your opinion?
---
Yeah.  Piss off kid.
---
Yeah, i haven't equipped a single item since level one that isn't prebis/bis. Levelling was hard, and they laugh at me when I try to find groups for dungeons but they will see my way is the best way in the end! /s
---
5% ah fee on everything.
---
I rerolled Alliance on an RP server (Bloodsail Buccaneers) and am having more fun than I ever have before.
---
You realize that premade vs premade is an incredibly small part of pvp in this game, right? Sure, premade vs premade I would agree that holy paladins give alliance the edge, but that is probably what, 5% or less of the game's overall pvp experience? 
---
So outside of the very niche situation you have described I am right. In pugs, world pvp, and duels (the incredibly overwhelming majority of pvp experiences) those racials are often the difference between winning and losing.
---
Do u know if can i create a troll alt char and buy a troll mount to mail to my undead char to use?
---
You'll be fine
---
Maybe a bit more enjoyed than right now
---
But you will
---
I'll be fine
---
And you want to spamm blockrock anyway
---
On the contrary. My server is fine, most peoples are not. Don't be surprised with the lack of PVP on horde dominant servers when the alliance "go back to retail."
---
If you have fun with it, it’s fun.
---
Yeah. Play classic and enjoy the experience, it's normal to go super slowly when starting and not knowing where to go first. Just take it easy and explore the world. If you have any questions ask in any chat. You will surely find people willing to teach you what to do next.
---
If someone told you to drop everything today and reroll the opposite faction for the good of your server, would YOU do it?
---
I didn't roll Horde on Herod for PVP advantage, either. I just like Horde as a faction and I wanted a populated server. So did most other people I play with.
---
Easily the best healers in the game. People say that priests are, but this was pre- patch 1.12. In every raid I’ve done so far as a holy paladin, we have 4 holy paladins sitting around the top. Then priests, then druids. 
---
They’re relatively easy to play, with a couple nuanced abilities that takes some skill to understand. 
---
They’re always needed in a raid environment.
---
Tomorrow?
---
That's the thing though. Classic is about the leveling journey.  It shouldn't be torture. 
---
Retail, there is no journey.  Its all bonuses and hand holding and doing everything it can to get you to max level as fast as possible.
---
Who the fuck runs ubrs before a princess BRD run?
---
You are shit I do 721 dps to rag as a warlock.
---
I know what I’m talking about, people are just getting mad because they know I’m right and hate reality.
---
nope stating facts
---
I just like chuckling at kids who can't read or follow simple instructions.
---
Whew lad settle down killer
---
LMFAO sorry man but if the majority of Horde were actually good, I wouldv quit by now. The fact that they are dog shit is the only saving grace.
---
Addon you download and put in the interfaces folder of your game. It shows mobs for your quest on the map so you aren’t running around looking for it blindly.
---
Oh boy. I got that and I instantly just used it. Then 10 minutes later it hit me how rare it probably was
---
Tyfys, Carry on being cynical
---
Not sure about that. Greta Mosshoof is healing Azeroth, while Greta Thunberg is just repeating what her masters tell her to say while she fails to answer direct questions around the human-caused climate change hoax.
---
Disagree. Especially if arena pvp ever becomes a thing shadowmeld is S tier. 
---
In current classic it is very unique effect with both powerful and fun effect.
---
Hello can you block me too please?
---
Don’t post worthless trash.  Awe boohoo you got a 98.  MUST TELL EVERYONE ON REDDIT!!!!!!
---
[Ayy] lmao
---
Except that part of my question is, is there a working drain soul macro.
---
Because the two that I have just spit half the bind into /s.
---
Indeed
---
Sure, but mom's is made with love..
---
Perception is worse.
---
You are right. It depends on the server. The two I play on ahing is a lot better but it maybe different. For example thick leather is 60s to vendor and sells for 1g+ on both of my servers. But I have a suspicious it's like that on most servers because of the leather working shenanigans.
---
&gt; he will learn not to AoE
---
Imo, that is rather optimistic of you. Rather he will blame the tank for sucking, the healer for not keeping him alive, the other dps for not killing the mobs fast enough. Self reflection is not really a virtue many of the aoe mages posses.
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH
---
Zug zug
---
My recomendation is to run holly ret for early leveling. Get holly down to consecrate and then start grabbing all the ret talents you can. You can get some pretty good DPS doing this. You can run as any role in dungeons until about 50 if you keep multiple sets around for the different roles. Once you hit fifty you lose some of your versatility with running dungeons. You can still do any role. But you won’t do nearly as well except for the role you specialize in. 
---
As has been said. Raiding expects you to be holy. Paladins are the most efficient healers in the game. Our flash of light can be spammed till kingdom come once you get some decent healing gear. Plus with talents. Any critical heals give you your mana back. 
---
Tanking can be a chore as a paladin. Only do it with groups that understand you need a warm up time to generate threat even more than druids and warriors. We have no  direct threat generating ability’s. All we generate comes from how much damage we do. Since we have pretty low DPS.  It can be difficult to keep up with mages and other high DPS classes for threat. Don’t take flak from the people you group with over this. While paladins can act as tanks. Blizzards horrible class building with them made them one of the worst at the job. And people need tanks more than you need them.
---
You need raptor riding to ride a raptor.
---
Do they realize if Golemagg dropped the mageblade every week, it would still be 12-13 weeks before everyone had it? People are so fucking stupid about gear these days.
---
Upgrading some pug well always be worth more than a shard. I constantly run into the same people and don't want them rocking greens forever.
---
Mmmmm steak.
---
I wouldn't go so far as to assume what OP was thinking or feeling, but I'd agree that the point of this post was to show the small margin by which the winner was decided.
---
Whats that addon?
---
Current drama on Pagle horde that has lasted 2 days and has become a meme of sorts:
---
A tank warrior was advertising in LFG that he was "LFM Strat live runs, orbs on reserve" as he didnt need anything from live and figured tanks are in high enough demand that he could reserve them (I had a talk with him for a short moment). LFG chat absolutely blew up with "how can you be so greedy" and being down right toxic about the whole thing. While others were saying to simply not join his group if you didn't like him reserving them, which I thought would be reasonable. 
---
No, this turned into a 2 - 3 hour debate in LFG chat on why you're a shitty person for offering tank services for reservations! 
---
Now horde side will periodically say things like "LFM RFC orbs not reserved"
---
The brown sky ruins it for me. Obviously part of the plaguelands theme, and silithus being a desert isnt much better, so honestly I just want Elwynn forest with lvl 60 mobs
---
I just did WC with 3 people on lvl 20. Smart pulls are the key. You could realize if you have to play with scumbag guys at the beginning of the dungeon.
---
I think there's a chance that world pvp wont be as large as people predict simply because the servers really suck and cant handle it without major lag and rubberbanding. This was acceptable in 2005 but people are sick of it 2019.
---
As an addendum to that, if your healer gets aggro it's not a sign of a bad healer, it means the tank is not producing sufficient aoe threat to offset the damage he (and occasionally the rest of the group) takes. If I have to spam Heal the tank I will produce a lot of aoe threat, and while I don't like to do that I'm still going to because the alternative is the group dying.
---
Two more things, like many leveling players I currently Heal in with dps talents, this is fine except for one thing, I do not have anti pushback talents so if I get hit my casts are going to take ages to finish (I had the 1.5s cast time lesser healing wave at +9 seconds or something in lbrs yesterday).
---
Also, since I mentioned that group, yes healers can heal dungeons they are too low level to dps, it's just a bit slower, and no a low leveled healer does not generate more aggro from healing spells than a higher leveled one with the same talents).
---
This turned i to a bit of a rant, but the tldr is don't blame the healer for taking healing aggro, the alternative is you (and probably also the rest of the group) going to visit the spirit healer.
---
Make a macro for ambush/cheapshot 
---
If you pve more than you pvp
---
/Cast [mod:shift] Ambush 
---
/Castsequence Pick Pocket, Ambush
---
When you open in pvp or mob without pockets hold shift+key macro is on :)
---
I’m not sure, but definitely something to look into.
---
VC for lyfe
---
I don't think you've played for the past 15 years. Almost everybody uses keybinds nowadays.
---
So the issue is that when in combat, switching weapons will always trigger a global cooldown. I haven't been able to figure out a way around this. It means you have to hit the button once, pause, and then hit it again, or just spam it.
---
Peak human performance.
---
As far as horde heavy pvp servers go, I'm not locked in there with them. They're locked in there with me.
---
If you don't want people to see your posts you can just not make them.  Free lifehack
---
Which happens a few million times a day.  He’s not special, his screenshot is not special, it’s nothing more than spam that doesn’t need to be posted.
---
What do you really think? Was this question worth asking?
---
Im not trying to be a douche but cmon
---
HOW DARE MOO!
---
I'm on proudmore alliance which the server has more horde not everyone and their mother will pvp all day every day. 1st week may be crazy but people wont just camp one person over and over again because Honorable kills have diminished returns most of the real pvper will be doing them in hills or stv
---
Its THE best mmo out there. That's why it has the biggest amount of subscribers in the world.
---
Your epic mount *is* BiS. It is the ultimate BiS because it will never be replaced.
---
Some wise guy once told me:
---
"Retribution can be used all the way up to 60, but if you do more dungeons then from roughly 45/50 on onward it might best to go 21 pts holy and rest in Ret."
---
I've been ganked by roving Alliance bands on Herod quite often. I'll even be peacefully near a solo Alliance player, and as soon as a second or third pass by, they'll all turn and aggro. Most people will get itchy to attack once they have the advantage; it's just human nature.
---
And while the DM entrance is Horde-dominated as hell, I feel like Blackrock Mountain tends to switch hands several times a day, so I too question how heavy the imbalance is.
---
Well you know when you have what you believe is a killer post but it didn't give you as many upvotes as you wanted you gotta get right back on that horse.
---
I got a green chest piece off poor Gamon yesterday after killing him for years
---
I was slightly mistaken because I did these macros up a month ago but I use a /click macro so it's a bit complicated. First I made a macro to equip my shield and one hander, then a second one to equip my 2hander, I put them on my bars off to the side really small on an unbound action bar. Then uses either 
---
/framestack 
---
/script DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage( GetMouseFocus():GetName() );
---
This displays the name of the action button your using, Finally just put 
---
/click 'action button name'
---
And it will click that macro, problem is you will use 3 action buttons just for one macro. But it works and I don't have to change more than one macro when I get a new weapon because all the other weapon swap abilities call the 1 macro 
---
So it goes 
---
 #Showtooltip Shield Bash
---
/click DominosActionButton7
---
/cast shield bash
---
Letting me spam the button and it swap and interrupt 
---
And one tap of 
---
/click DominosActionButton8
---
And it weapon swaps back or forth
---
I'm sorry I'm not good at explaining things without pictures and had to regoogle some of this stuff and look at my current macro. Hope this helps
---
Imp fire shield
---
Probably convinces them to retire from touring and kills their manager.
---
Go back to retail
---
Zangarmarsh.  
---
This zone is the second area that many players would have reached in their playthrough of the first major expansion for WoW. It is a giant mushroom forest with a little bit of swamp, and I fondly remember running around in its beautiful blue-green tone fighting giant lightning bugs and weird creeping monsters with long legs and bulbous bodies. This zone also contains Sporeggar, the most wonderful little hamlet of mushroom people ever created in any videogame ever. It also blew my mind to find out that beneath the large Zangarmarsh lake there is a raid instance where you have to fight a bunch of nagas and, like, a naga queen or something. It was a massive jump forward in fantasy aesthetic for the game, and it’s just as amazing to look at today.
---
Do you teach your pet stuff?
---
Form your own group then. Healers are the second most desired after tanks. Dps make up the bulk up the community and are easily interchangeable.
---
&gt;Does nothing but make personal attacks and doesn't actually discuss the topic at hand at all
---
&gt;Accuses OP of trolling
---
What kind of bizarro world person are you?
---
No, healing is the role that's different from the others.  Tanking is mechanically identical to playing a DoT-based DPS.
---
I'll temper that by saying "If it's an upgrade roll on it unless it's bis for another class".
---
Rogues needing the healing mace out of chaple for the extra 2dps while it's actually the best healing 1h before raids is painful.
---
well 10 is better than nothing xD
---
No. Fuck off with that. I want as much time with honor and no bgs as possible. BGs ruined the fucking world pvp in 1.5 and it'll happen again. 
---
If I had it my way BGs wouldn't ever come
---
Why cant i buy my Bite level 2 skill for my new lvl 40 cat!? I could buy the first level when i was 37 :s
---
TLDR: use /click to press the macro on your bar from another macro
---
I don't know enough to comment on your specific gearing questions, but as a human with the sword racial, you only need 6% to be hit capped in pve - you're good to go.
---
Haha. I actually upvoted it the first time, which is why I noticed.
---
Lmao the pathetic gatekeeping in this post.
---
But in 4years of raiding every reset it's already 1h44min!!
---
Not worried about any of this, and I'm alliance on 
---
a pvp server. Flight path honor is the only thing I think is credible and wouldn't mind seeing, but even that's barely over 'meh' for me.
---
Asinine topics don't need discussed. They aren't balancing the game lol.....
---
Don't worry, I would /guffaw at you
---
Top ten most OP Mmorpg powers...
---
Truth. Avoiding pugs with reserved gear is a good way to avoid selfish people.
---
If you want to switch do it, you'll probably regret it and that way you can also experience horde leveling
---
Yes that was exactly what happened
---
You're not going to fail to complete a UBRS either at all or in a timely fashion because of your shadow priest's damage.
---
Ok thanks - is threat a a big problem as healer? Figured I can just pop fade at the pull
---
&gt;im in a fun,intteracting guild 
---
You want to trade a good socializing guild for racials and looks? Seems like a grass is greener situation, finding good people you fit with is hard.
---
&gt;No. I am on one of the most balanced PVP servers
---
Then stop trying to speak for those who aren't. We hsve fingers to type up whiney posts if we want to.
---
Last stand, one in shield block, the rest in defiance. 5 in crit in fury and standard arms.
---
If not specified as melee attack power it increases melee AND ranged dps.
---
How old are you, out of curiosity. No disrespect but I’m ballparking 12?
---
So you're saying you shouldn't pvp anyone because you won't have anyone to pvp if you do?
---
If you are enjoying where you are I say keep where you are at.  With that said, it definitely isn’t too early to reroll especially if you are desiring how the character looks because you are stuck with what you use for the rest of classic.
---
High :)
---
loooool
---
i play naked until naxx
---
I haven't played retail since Cata and even then it was pretty casual by that point (actual casual and not the casual that is anything less than no life). I tried briefly to drop in when classic started up to play with friends of friends and it's not for me. I hate zones so reliant on flying for one thing.
---
I need to be able to play at my own time. I'd rather play 6 hours Sunday and not at all the rest of the week rather than logging on for a short time to do dailies and stuff. I can't stand wow chores. Especially if they're necessary for gear. Give me drops and I'll take my chances.
---
I kind of want to fully level all the classes but we will see how long the servers survive.
---
Is that a NE warrior?
---
I would agree that it's only mildly interesting. Why does it bother you so much? Just scroll to the next post. No need to shit on OP.
---
My goal is 1000 :)
---
Nice job. And also nice positivity and encouragement for others to try.
---
\*mind blown\*
---
Bite isn't bought from the trainer. You need to learn it from a wild beast: https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/abilities.php
---
You can skip straight to rank 6 at your level.
---
It didn't last time and it won't this time. Imbalances were massive on US servers. Stop trying to play doom seer you're bad at it.
---
Please never tank for any group I'm a part of.
---
lol i trashed that
---
I never understood this mindset - constant improvement or you're just wasting time. I run stuff because it's fun to get a good group. If something drops that someone can use, cool. If not, also cool. Slight improvements over time makes the runs smother and ultimately more fun. Rolling need isn't taking anything away from anyone else, and people getting butthurt over pixels is just lame. 
---
It's a game, nothing in it really matters - not your gear, not even the gold. The gear treadmill is going to end in Classic eventually. OK, so you didn't get the piece you wanted this time, or you lost your roll to some pleb who "didn't deserve it". OMG so what, just run it again and next time you might get it. I'm not going to even guess how many runs it took to get things like a Sun Eater or Baron's mount, even lost need rolls, but I got both of them. 
---
If you need the reward of gear at the end in order to have a good time, why the fuck do you even want the gear in the first place?
---
That's pretty wild to me. I double checked and I've actually sold 11, but only about ~27g off all of them. Are you the only seller on your realm? On Mankrik there are at least 5 people sporadically posting them for 1-3g per.  I was pretty hopeful when I got the pattern, but so far Shadoweave and bags are where the money's at.
---
I feel you shield brother! I don't reserve as a tank either, that's just greasy. I also don't like the "tanking for gold" either, especially if I still need loot from the dungeon. If the tank needs absolutely nothing from the dungeon then sure charge gold away, you're absolutely selling a service then. It's just not me.
---
For the Horde!!!
---
... is negligible compared to ocean liner emissions, air traffic, and industrial uses of power.
---
I'm on Gehennas and even if I go to a black lotus zone at 4 am there will be more than 10 horde looking and several alliance. Was easier when not that many were 60 but now everyone and their mother has a BL spawn map
---
Am alliance, it didn’t get mentioned for th 6 hours I was on last night or the 2 so far this morning.
---
Hop in man! Make sure to roll your first char on a PvE server would be my only piece of advice!
---
Some servers are getting a glut of healers. I feel dps still has it worse but due to the lack of tanks I see a lot more of the same healers lfg.
---
56 close to 57.
---
Did BRD arena runs at lvl 52 before
---
We found the big brain.
---
The only actually compelling argument in this post.
---
So it's a scarf on female models head? I always saw it as hair and beard.
---
Butttttttt that tauren is definitely older than 2 years.
---
Because you have to establish laws/policies which make it political
---
&gt;No spell interrupt
---
&gt;No Zerk Rage
---
&gt;No WW
---
What kind of monster are you?
---
exactly!
---
There is a big difference between a holy priest rolling on Ban'thok Sash against a dps caster, and a fury warrior rolling on Valor against a disenchanter.
---
He's saying she looks like a cow because Tauren look like cows. And that's not a very nice thing to say about a teenage girl.
---
So do Wow characters. Murder hobos on horses.
---
If only you had locked in Lemmiwinks...
---
Omg
---
Considering I make a quarter million a year probably somewhere better than your dumb ass.
---
Everyone saying its bannable, I believe it is not. You can get banned by jumping on top of the arena because that is terrain abuse, while this spot is not. It is a spot where only 1 guard patrols every few minutes and that person is in range of them. Just a clever use of game mechanics.
---
WoW characters are not real.
---
Wowhead BiS guides are Boomer news
---
There's a guy on EU Shazzrah Horde who does this named LouisVuitton
---
The first time I ran BRD I signed up to tank it at level 56 for a full run. I made it clear it was my first time so be gentle and explain as we go. It was possibly the smoothest run of any dungeon in my entire life. Not a single death. 
---
I’ve since run it many many times and none compare to that first run. Even with a full group of 60s. I feel like I’ll be chasing that high for the rest of my life.
---
Wolves are at their best in groups with a lot of melee dps. Not so great for soloing. You can use one, it's just not optimal.
---
If you're making the run to IF/SW, you can pick up a wolf in the dwarf or human starting zones. Lowest in Nelf zones are the level 19s in Ashenvale.
---
I’m talking about my lvl 40 mount
---
So why no Renew?
---
I get 500 healing for 120 mana or so.
---
My Heal rank 4 is 600-700 healing for 300 mana or so.
---
For a lot of us this was our first mmo or first one after runescape. So yeah it's s good one
---
I mean if you look at the posts here, I feel like 80% of those people don't have key binds.
---
Hmm. Every add on I have (and I have many) has an option within the add on to hide the minimap button
---
Hey mate thanks for letting me know how you feel about the content, I always look for ways to improve. I wouldn't consider the content I use subpar, only if you assume what you mentioned is the norm for interesting content, I generally don't have much free time to play wow so it's hard for me to get raid wipes or really good pvp content. Since I started making wow content I've always used dungeon runs or generic wow content and made it more interesting, it's sort of my gimmic. I'll try harder to get some footage like you mentioned in the future as I always want my content to appeal to everyone :) I reply to around 80% of my comments and havent seen anyone call me a fortnite youtuber though that's a first. I actually did start out as a Fortnite youtuber though if you go back to my older videos on YouTube haha, didn't get too far though .
---
surely you have to be trolling.
---
&gt;You are shit I do 721 dps to rag as a warlock.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I know what I’m talking about, people are just getting mad because they know I’m right and hate reality.
---
Yes you put the time in to get good loot. Better loot increases your dps. Nobody is contesting that, fuckwit.
---
they’re not particularly amazing for leveling compared to something a boar or an owl but they are great for end-game because of their Howl ability that provides a ranged-attack buff (and you basiclly don’t have your pet attack because of the likelihood it gets killed
---
not sure about your second quest since i’ve only ever played horde
---
I had the same before. Went to item restoration page and it was there. Maybe i accidentally deleted it but didnt look like that
---
Fair enough! Haven't seen this method yet. Will google it.
---
I think the main issue may be that healers tend to look for groups for their bis items that tanks may not need. Similar to tanks ressing the orbs in strat, as there may be no other motivation for them to run it. With the introduction of dm I definitely see what you’re talking about. However, still can’t imagine there isn’t 3 times the volume of dps to healers if not more. I think we can all agree that there’s not enough tanks :(
---
Maybe I'm just optimistic. I am an AoE Mage. If I pull off a tank, I get mad when they try and pull back. I know what I was getting in to. Maybe j was trying to help the group out be reducing the damage you take and killing a mob. Same goes for when I see you in trouble and Nova...mobs are frozen, just walk away for a few bro.
---
I must have rolled on the wrong server. As a tank, there’s no chance in HELL that I’d be able to reserve that ring and make a group that wasn’t all guildies. 
---
I got it on a run competing with 3 other people, one of which was a enh shaman in healing gear. And that was with 40 minutes or searching for people that WOULDNT need the ring (got a warlock trying to get the dagger)
---
Well done guys!!
---
Thanks for the info! Yeah party frames is what I’m using.
---
What's the best source for BiS list right now on this patch? I see a lot of conflicting information when it comes to BiS and alternative equipment.
---
yeah x faction auction house is a scamarino
---
Oh so i need to find a Pet that knows a higher lvl bite? Also dash would be good...
---
I play alliance on Blaumeux I'd say we have a good split.
---
I think classic/vanilla tends to attract the basement dweller type because anyone can be “good” at the game with enough time investment. 
---
And I would be willing to bet that there are a lot more age 25-40 males living in their parent’s basement in 2019 than in 2004 because most jobs require college degrees and there are more electronic entertainment options to keep yourself busy.
---
Oops looks like somebody has been corrupted by the seductive whisperings of  ~~c'thun~~ Exxon Mobil
---
I wanted up to upvote but you had 69 points.
---
...nice
---
Bro private servers have been running for years with the same balancing issues. They didn't die, why would classic?
---
That guy behaved like a toxic asshole, and you took it like a champ.
---
There is no doubt that a sane person would have needed in your case. It's an upgrade, AND noone else needed! 
---
Moreover it's Valor man! The iconic warrior set! The first thing I do when I create a character is see what they would look like in their t0 set with atlasloot.
---
Kill 6 reactionary traitors and 6 reactionary running dogs and I will reward you with freshly baked bread and 30 copper, noobftw.
---
Why don't you just get a swamp of sorrows jaguar? Their attack speed is 1.2.
---
Did you use giant growth to clip? I used the blink method to get down there for a video a few weeks ago. It's a bummer the duel spots don't work anymore.
---
Yeah, this is my second mmo. First time playing classic wow and I love it!!
---
This. 
---
 i dont give a shit what you're selling. If you PM me out of no where you're going on ignore. Period.
---
the aq boss thing won't work, so its only a collector item now.
---
I don't get why you're being downvoted. You're right that if the realms with extreme faction balance continue, people from the minority faction will just keep quitting. It's just a snowball that'll never fix itself and even keep getting worse. I guess if some people are fine playing on 85-15 servers that's fine, but I can't imagine that's ideal for either side
---
Yes. Stable your main pet, tame the beast with the skill, spam it until you get a chat message saying "You have learned a new spell". You can then abandon the temporary pet and teach the skill to your main one.
---
The page I linked lists every rank and where you can get them.
---
im lv 40 and my mp2 from spirit regen is 75 mana.
---
Down ranking is absolutely pointless, not enough int/healpower/mp5 gear to make it useful.
---
You think the 8spirit/15 heal Cath mace is better than the 31 heal BRD mace?
---
We have been doing it right behind the pillar no prob. Everyone has to be there. If someone isn't on that spot they aggro
---
Giant Growth and Firewater together, yep! Yeah they fixed those duel spots so long ago, I really miss dueling in the middle of IF
---
Careful walking around with that massive brain of yours flopping around, wouldn't want to knock anything over would you
---
You monster!
---
I believe there is an add-on that lets you make weapon comparisons like this, came to this thread to try and find the name of it lol. If anyone knows the add on i’m talking about i’d greatly appreciate it, I’m also a fury war with a similar dilemma
---
Yea.. retarded. I'll sign your helmet if you want.
---
Yea retarded. I'll sign your helmet if you want
---
But people keep saying I’m wrong.
---
I’m telling you why this guy got flamed, that’s it. I’m not saying whether it’s right or not....
---
In Wrath, my guild would do drunken snaxx/undying runs. It was a blast! Especially with certain bosses that people would consistently mess up on, we had a priest who never could get down the safety dance so we would make him sit outside the room and call him Unclean! Flash forward to classic, a lot of the core people from that guild have come back and I'm having an absolute blast again
---
I’m a warrior, if I want to run a dungeon, I tank. If you’re a warrior who doesn’t want to tank, get the fuck outta my group. Unless you’re a friend of mine, then we’re good.
---
Deathbringer.

I'm in this weird spot leveling on my server where most people have already moved on the BRD, or are still on ZF. So the few of us currently running Mara don't have too much competition. I was lucky and got 3 mages and a priest so as long as we ran tinkerer too they were fine with me reserving the ring
---
Guaranteed he wants to keep batching because rogues benefit from it. If a mage is spamming /cast [combat] blink to get away from a CS opener, you can gouge and both abilities trigger. The mage blinks but must sit a gouge and the rogue reopens.

If you're going to be toxic to any and everyone in pursuit of your goal, in a MULTIPLAYER game, then you're a fucking asshole, and no one should play with you. That's the point, you shit-stain.

Pinnacle of laziness - but to be fair, it's not a dig at you specifically - as I said, it's an epidemic all across the subreddit, regardless of the reasons why. We're tired of seeing grainy, ugly, low-quality phone pictures every. single. day.

Some people like their virtual avatar to have boobs y'know? I'm usually one of those people, but I play a gnome and I want the crazy old man look

Some people like being on the extremely imbalanced servers. I rolled alliance on a retail server that was 150:1 horde:alliance so that I would have more people to kill.

Its typically a low level poorly equipped suicide run, that's what makes it so fun.    So lots of level 1-5 gnomes.  Higher folks often run along side of the run and play interference to take out any triggered mobs

Is this ring only from tribute? Also how many runs did you do to get 2 of those?

Thanks for the answer!

Thanks for sharing man, really enjoyed the read through, and as a mage, highly appreciated the comment about us :P

Stop blurring the names out IMO. Make em famous.

If it's someone else's BIS, I think it's courtesy to let them have it.

I agree about everything else, an upgrade is an upgrade.

I do giveaways in my videos, BUT since I feel people aren't obligated to watch the video: the first person that can guess the server my very first character was ever created on will get a free month of WoW! :)

As an Enhancement Shaman with Elemental Devastation, is it ever worth it to take spell crit instead (to a certain threshold like 10-12%) instead of physical crit? Or physical crit is always, always better? Like, full Agi + Strength gear but an Eye of the Beast in the trinket slot instead of Blackhand’s Breadth
---
I mean, the horse is real nice.
---
BiS gear will change eventually. Mount stays forever.

But apparently streaming and use of broadband has quite the footprint. I don't remember where I read it, but if I find the article, I'll link it.
---
And cruise boats are negligible compared to all the freighters, ....
---
Bottom line: playing wow (or any other video game) or binge watching netflix does have a CO2 footprint and just btw the CO2 emissions of world wide video streaming is app. as big as that of world wide air traffic. Let that fact sink in!
---
Yeah and how many of those people are still glad that it’s here or even play at all lol
---
I play on a pve realm so not really a concern for myself.  I do really think adding WSG in ph2 but holding back r11+ rewards until later ma be a way to go.  People will still gain the ranks just have the upper grades of equipment locked behind the time gate.
---
Yeah, I finally tried it out and with everyone standing near the exit cave, I just tanked the boss right there (where the imps come out) and the lashers never aggro'd.
---
Saves a couple minutes of clearing those trash mobs. Was able to get my DM E jump runs down to ~10 minutes.
---
&gt;Also, if you aren't going to poopsock your way to a breastplate of chromatic flight
---
I would almost go so far to say I'd much rather shoot for that doing rend runs than savage glad. Saw it drop 5-6 times in vanilla and twice in classic already.
---
Exactly. And you can put it on when you wanna look like a bad ass until you complete better tiers
---
You sound like the type of person who complains about seeing toxicity and elitism everywhere while also feeling virtuous for ruthlessly and viciously harassing people who fit your definition of toxic as "Anyone who has different preferences or priorities than mine"

When I am frustrated with tanking I just log on my alt and watch them suffer in LFG while farming.

As a casual player, is enchanting worth sticking with? I'm just about level 40 and feeling the money crunch. I'm considering swapping to herbalism to compliment my tailoring.
---
Yo. Here’s the deal. You are a human rogue with the hit talent and using swords so you only need 1% from gear to hit the “yellow cap”. This amount caps your special abilities but your auto attacks can still miss. This usually means hit is still good after yellow cap but worse than crit.
---
As for whether certain gear swaps are worth, I couldn’t tell you without knowing your gear and the raid buffs you run with, and simulating it. But for shoulders the other option is called Wyrmtongue Shoulders or something, they have a lot of agility.
---
You are a hilarious little troll...
---
The chest of the seven is rng loot. It's not a guaranteed reward from a Princess run. People who aren't complete idiots run UBRS at lvl 58 to get keyed for Ony regardless of whether or not they received specific rng loot from the seven.
---
It's adorable that you think all progression should stop until you get a random drop from BRD (which isn't even prebis).
---
Your alleged dps is irrelevant to the discussion.
---
I know some people who came from Elysium that are chill, but yeah they all say the same thing you are.
---
I'm not saying you should completely ignore bis gear, just that it's barely worth the effort when it's not actually needed for anything at this point in time. I mean that there's too much emphasis being put on bis gear and min-maxing. If it's your personal goal, then whatever the fuck, you're free to spend your time as you like. It's when that shitty goal is forced on everyone else that it becomes retarded.
---
Food level.  Check your combat log, it tells you how much happiness is ticking after you feed your pet.
---
I used to grind for it in wrath because it was like winning the lottery. I was a kid and real bad at making money, but it sold for way more than I had ever seen - I think it was like 14k at the time.
---
It' about as much as world wide air traffic.
---
And btw the opportunity cost is a weak argument, since you could just as well entertain yourself with some old school activities
---
Is anyone who disagrees with your opinion a pathetic gatekeeper?
---
About +6, so surefooted and then +3 is really easy esp with T1 gloves
---
Also if you want more details on hit cap, for weapon skill 300/301/302/303/304/305 the cap is 9/8.6/8.2/7.8/7.4/6.0. That isn’t a mistake that it drops an extra percent at 305. Blitz just wrote some random ass formulas and that’s how it works.
---
One of our fury warriors has run arena at least 100 times and has yet to get SGC so I totally understand rolling for an upgrade. Maybe if someone needed it for mainspec bis but this sounds like someone latching onto misplaced frustration.
---
Don’t think you need a spec for the scale cloak. Just have 300 Lw skill when you hand in  the Head of Onyxia and you can learn it I believe.
---
Hide is tribal I think?
---
Oh do you think it’s fun for your vanish to work 10% of the time? Do you think it’s fun dying to an auto attack from a dead mob, then running back to your body for 5 minutes? Fun for mobs to auto you when you cheap shot them?

PvP in classic was fine the way it was.  Anyone super competitive spent all day in queue or bgs as a group and world PvP in popular pve zones thrived.  Tier 2 meant nothing in PvP so you didn’t need to worry about being out geared.  It wasn’t until the terrible idea of putting BC talents in without gear to compensate that would PvP became stagnant because suddenly half the classes had an almost instant kill button.  To be clear I play horde on a PvP server where we are outnumbered.  I also spent lots of wasted time being killed by 60s because I am not. These types of unwarranted and completely biased complaints are the reason blizzard felt it necessary to add everything people disliked.  Trust the process patiently how vanilla was intended to be played but don’t sit on the internet pretending you have other peoples best interest at heart.  It’s clear that you’re worried and I can respect that but there are other avenues for you that won’t change the game everyone else asked for.

You should absolutely start playing. With all the information out there, you shouldn’t have too much trouble picking it up. On the flip side there is a LOT to learn, so take your time and take the game at your own pace. Don’t worry about maximizing efficiency (unless that’s your thing), just enjoy the game. Don’t be afraid to ask for help, there are a lot of friendly players out there. Find a guild that is welcoming of new players and you’ll have a blast.

"Okay, Kids. Today for recess we're playing dodgeball. Now I know this is supposed to be a competitive sport where the object of the game is to affix to units against each other and compete to gather resources and get the other team out.
---
"I know that most, or all, of you want to win so I've designed a way for most of you to win!! Instead of the 20 of you being split into teams of 10, I'm going to split you into a team of 7 and a team of 13! This way the team of 13 has higher chance of not getting 'out' (ganked) and can also gather resources faster (mats) so that the other team cannot keep up with your progress!
---
Doesn't this sound like so much fun for all of you!?!?"
---
- You if you were to design a competitive system.
---
Nah you are not, but that's despite the shadow, not because of him.

same story here

I’ve had this thing since the start of the game where about every 30min the game will lose connection to the server and I can’t move or do anything for about 6 seconds. Happens at really inopportune times.

Hunter - Marking and killing undead rogues on site.
---
Good job :) nice "event" hehe :) 
---
Things like this makes WoW great :)
---
The ally version are gnomes especially gnome mages or locks, but more so for me compared to undead because many people pick undead because they look cool - who the fuck would open an MMORPG, look through all the unique races and classes, and want to be a gnome - the stupidest looking race in the game pre pandarian. Thus a higher percentage of gnome players are pvp tryharfs compared to undeads who are often just edgelords as well.
---
They prolly just like being the best they can be. Fuck you for telling people what the real vanilla experience is. Comments like yours outweigh the min-max comments by a huuuuge margin. Shut up. Stop and smell the roses if you want, but shut up about it

OK, you're stupid and can't even stay on topic. You have to do better if you want me to engage with you. You're not even good at trolling.
---
Ah maybe it's like the hunter FD bug then

A lot of prebis gear is situational too.

Hit is much less important outside of raid bosses, for example.

I guess the guy with the portal is the “house,” and the house always has a slight advantage? We are gambling here.
---
it literally doesnt matter if an offspec can heal I agree druids and paladins and priests and shamans can heal in their dps specs but a group can decide whether to have an offspec healer or a mainspec heal and the fact the OP made this post over such a petty thing is what made me make my initial post.
---
You can do almost anything else that doesn’t cost a global, such as cancel druid form which makes it possible to do one button switch between forms.
---
They haven't stopped these types of posts in the past. I doubt they will start now.
---
Honestly I have a really hard time believing that farming black lotus as your prime objective is good gold per hour. Unless you have alts on all the respawn points, the chance of you getting it even when you know the respawn time has to be at most 1/5. Just doesnt seem like a viable long term gold strat to me. You must have put in some insane hours to have that many lotus.
---
I don't even understand the mentality. In Retail I can *kinda* understand it, because having top DPS on a mythic fight is an actual accomplishment. All the content in Classic is pathetically easy though. There's nothing "cool" about topping dps charts. It doesn't show you're more skilled, because skill has nothing to do with it. It only shows that you're playing one of the stronger dps classes and have more gear than the other dps because that's all it takes. If you want to measure your e-peen, go to Retail.
---
I maintain that in any environment where muting or ignoring someone is an option, the second jerky thing they say is voluntary.
---
Yep, no bigger bug in the entire game than this niche issue with a specific scenario for a certain class. Biggest bug in the game by FAR

The 2% drop rate is set aside for the mats.

Thats a very nice looking horse.

Almost Famous is already KoS, now it's time to add Frost Wolves to that list

Same, something seems fishy about this guide. I dont think classic has been out long enough to have found that many lotus.

True wisdom. Thanks brother.

I hope the white stallion is available.. it would look so badass

Findings are inconclusive. Nowhere near "basic science". The solutions suggested are unrealistic and hurtful to the economies, especially in smaller countries. The issue requires further study and alternative solutions.
---
"You do what we tell you or you're an ignorant moron." is not a proper argument if you want to reach a decision.
---
Enchanting is more of a guild support skill than a profitable profession. There aren't very many level 60 enchanters, and your guild will love you if you stick with it long enough to start getting rare enchants for them.
---
If your guild already has a skilled enchanter then it's not really worth it, enchanting is not very profitable.

What kind of rogue wastes combo points on stuns when the tank isn’t dying? This hurts me right in the dps meter

Nah, OP ws only lvl 58

So by his own definition he shouldn't have used any gear before pre bis and anyone who ever rolled on an item in any dungeon before pre bis items is a noob. Seems legit
---
Priests boi here(;
---
People like you, crybabies, ruinned wow. Yes. Go back to retail.
---
Usually the player doing the advertising and inviting dictates what sort of run is attempted, including what sort of mats to bring.
---
i’ve never tried enchanting but from what i understand unless you’re gonna be like first on your server with a particular enchant you’re not gonna be making a ton of money and you’re probably better off with another profession from a money-making perspective but again this is just what i’ve read
---
Typicially it's whoever organizes the group.
---
I’d say start targeting more people, with target of target on. You’ll see that they’re all humans too and target people for whatever reason. And the things you’re anxious about, you will eventually use this to bring good into the world and spread love and amicable targeting to humanity. You’ve gotta confront your anxiety head on! You’ll be amazing!
---
Imho most groups just kill the last boss or skip him by running in different corners (fd helps a lot).
---
lmao it was game breakig before
---
Wait people can use quivers to attack?
---
That sounds like a dank combo, my friend and I run feral bear and shaman. Druid can heal and Rez at 20, I would pick the highest dps class. I am a LW which works out because we both wear leather
---
It's not about whether we should save our planet or not. It's about whether suggested solutions are realistic and reasonable. And that's why it's a political topic.
---
For me it's just behind black rock mountain. There is like this shrine with these huge stone hooded statues leaning over it. One of my first memories of wow was flying from stormwind to iron forge and seeing it and thinking "damn that place looks amazing, I'm gonna go there one day". And I did about 3 months later! (Young kid, slow at levelling)
---
In classic when I hit 60 and started mining routes in searing gorge I stopped off and chilled there and reminiscing about all the fun times through our the years. I honestly dont know what that little area is for to this day. But I still think it's really dope.
---
How dare you

We had a rogue in my guild either get them both in the same run,  or in back to back runs he claimed

Na hes just an ass. Sure it has some desirable stats but you dont take something with +hit. Those items aren't that easy to come across for casters. Only scenario I would take is if the other 4 in party didn't need.
---
Anything in life or a video game that could potentially make you more money/gold is usually more expensive.
---
As long as you're not a dps you should be fine
---
You really need an introspective look at yourself. You are about to be 40, and you just can't help yourself but shitting on someone in the /new/ section of a video game message board. Wowza.
---
She’s a kid who represents something. If you have to deep dive into her strategies then you’re missing the point
---
On my server, rugged vendors for about a gold/stack, but sells in the AH for about 1.4-1.6g/stack. It’s a solid 40% markup if you saved a ton of it. But you’re never going to make any serious money with it unless you have thousands to sell.
---
Sure if you are casual, i respec every week even at 50g cap
---
As rogue, by far the ability to vanish out of being ganked by higher level players. And continue my questing

THIS FFS
---
Everything is costly. Being alive necessitates consuming other living beings (plant or animal). It's unavoidable.
---
Lol k man. Enjoy your ignorance bubble, I’ve had this dumb argument before and it’s not worth it. It’s a damn shame we have to also drag you along when we fix this damn thing.
---
Yeah because everyones played the game before right.
---
In my experience the people who are all "omfg rogue kill on sight" are legitimately some of the worst players in the game. *^(Anyone ^gungho ^about ^worldpvp ^in ^general.)* Por ejemplo the last hunter to try was running scorpid sting on me. The one before that started attacking me within throwing weapon range and got dazed in cheetah. They all fall victim to my dreaded purple nurple cherry belly.         
---
Also I have yet to be scattershot into a trap so I'm guessing that doesn't work in classic? I thought it did. Hunters are primarily Marks right? Mystery.
---
Sit crits proccing player abilities was a bug that was fixed before 1.12 in Vanilla. It was broken on private servers. They didn't fix it for classic, sit crits not proccing player abilities is just faithfully recreating 1.12.
---
Yeah, I remember seeing some research about what shirt to equip on my main and I discovered that this thing existed.
---
Really was bis shirt, imo, unless you're putting together a specific vanity set.
---
Exact thing happened to me in Mara. The 2 stone giants before landslide, one peeled off me to a mage, mage blinked AWAY from the group, so every time I got in taunt range the mob would move and I couldn't taunt. He died, then said I was a shit tank. Bud tanks can't do shit outside of melee range. Blink towards me and you won't die.
---
Just buy the cheapest tailoring recipes you can find in the ah. Not worth to follow the tailoring guides for the last 20 or 30 levels.
---
Anything with plus healing is fair game for paladins. Sadly until the later phases when blizzard finally started to figure out itemization. It was quite rare to find good healer plate gear. If you look at BiS lists. Cloth and leather make up a good portion of it for most of the phases. Hence why we have to fight priests and other clothies for a decent part of our gear. At least the mail and plate we get to keep for ourselves.
---
Ohhhh yeAGGGGHHHHHHHH
---
Just proc by sit standing...
---
When you say a certain pet is great for pve, why is that?
---
Are the base stats higher? i helped my little bro tame an elite raptor in the barrens the other day and i'm not sure if he's any stronger, but im lvl 25 with a common orange tiger from the South Islands in Durotar, should i aim for a specific pet for pve?
---
amazing you took all that form a peanut gallery sarcasm remark
---
&gt; how difficult it is to get savage gladiator chain
---
Tombstone breastplate from Scholo or Deathdealer breastplate from BRD are good enough.
---
That's cause agi is a priority stat for warriors.
---
Nobody asked for classic with changes. 
---
This is supposed to be a recreation of the original game - if you want balancing please go play retail and leave your ideas out of this community.
---
Its an obvious issue that will affect all PVP servers if we do not stop it.
---
More gold will bring me closer to getting Lionheart Helm (as a warrior) so that means I need gold. And if I need gold that means I get to need on every single item that drops so that I can make this gold.
---
Still sounds like you regret it and should go to PvE
---
Oh that's really interesting I had not thought about that. My pet doesn't have 100% uptime on frenzy with 5 points at 2.0 though.

Looking for tips on grinding for someone who started too late and had to help too many guildies lol. I'm a 39 Ally rogue and about halfway to my mount. I tried the swamp jaguars but it feels like the drop rates are significantly lower than what some sites were saying but still doable. Cold eye basilisks seem like too much trouble in Strangethorn with PVP. With pick pocketing, is SM worth it? I don't mind getting it later than 40 but sooner would be better than never. I'm leatherworking and herbalism but low on herbalism and need to work on it. Any tips would be appreciated!
---
Tried this today. You won't get XP unless you are close. Getting through the mobs is difficult without you dying. At 60 the mobs won't ask agro to you. We did it one time successfully but getting killed on the way for you is a real risk.
---
Just move on, don't give him anymore thought or effort

Trolls like that are just annoying and probably would get a kick out of seeing that you made a Reddit post about it

It's incredible, 15 years ago we stopped doing DKP to stop the point hoarding and now even with loot council people are trying to not take items thinking we'll reward them with bigger items when they throw their hats in the ring for them. We keep telling them that's not how it's going to work, passing on upgrades even if they're not your ideal item looks bad to us and we aren't going to reward that behavior but they still do it.
---
God damn you really are a nosey fucker.  Did you really just assume my age based on a username?  Here’s a tip, I read.  One of my favorite books is 1981 by George Orwell.  But excellent job detective.

Yeah weird, nothings working. Been about 2 hours now

no you don't.  If you start swimming just as the boat is leaving, it gets to the dock just before you.

Did this quite a bit while leveling.

Exactly this
---
You guys are OP enough, who cares.
---
I love it, its the little things like this that make Classic so enjoyable! Too bad my pummel missed lol
---
Technically true, but layers make it playeable for more people. If they remove the 2 layers to 1 they will also reduce the cap, because that would make the game unplayable for everyone (like having 8500k people online). Instead they will reduce the cap to like 4500 max I think.
---
Lol. You spend a lot of time trying to rationalize why Holy is better. The final sentence is all you needed :).  If you're just lazy (or just enjoy it more) that's awesome. I just wanted to let you know you were misinformed.  It does NOT require you to have a solid party. It does not matter if the tank doesnt use a shield (the tank I run with most often doesnt use a shield either). We blaze through dungeons, and have no mana issues (Just finished a ZF run, and I never needed the group to stop - they were fast pulling, so I just drink when they fight).
---
Shadow is not just "perfectly fine" ... it's better. There is literally nothing that a holy priest can upgrade on a shadow healer in a dungeon run before L47 (and counting). I also often get to dps, and have run with holies. The only noticable difference is they do less dps than I do when I'm healing.
---
And, like I said. At heart, I am a holy priest. Is all I've ever been in WoW (tbc onward). I'm defensive of the class. But, legit. There really isn't any reason to be a holy priest pre L50 aside from "I like it better". Which is a totally fine answer. The rest of what you're saying is garbage though. ANYTHING a holy can do at these levels, a shadow can do, and often can do better.
---
It is but there's usually only 3 mobs that drop it for the whole dungeon.  It's highly possible at that sorts of drop rates to run the instance 50 times without ever seeing a drop. Bits also entirely possible to luckily have the pattern drop on the first one you kill in the first run of the dungeon like I did.

This comment section will probably be a reasonable one not at all filed with weird reactionary comments about Greta Thunberg....
---
Yeah, it's only Tribute chest. Not him, but my Hunter buddy did about 7-8 runs between all of dire maul and got two rings, the mail hunter chest, and Barbarous Blade.
---
Pickpocketing sm is not worth it. Maybe while waiting for a group to form.
---
Why did you tell them you were feral MS? When you say you’re getting gear from your bank and they ask, just say you like to level as a cat, but MS heal for dungeon groups.
---
That's some infantile whining. Scrutiny is the 101 of science. If they're proposing I lower my living temperature to 15 celsius on winters of course I'm gonna scrutinize the reasoning.

Fascinating, but I don't have force of will, I've got a standard 21/30/0 holy build though

Kids? But you're the only one acting like a child here!

I mean *he* probably never has. What kind of dictator would get their own hands so bloody?

And here you are wasting all this time continuing to try proving a pointless point.  The book is 1984 you idiot.  Just fuck off already.  You’re not doing anyone favors pulling this whole white knight bullshit on a message board.
---
I was in Redridge doing some leveling, and I was on the quest where you kill board, birds and spiders. I ended up grouping with another mage, and so, we simply pulled alot of mobs and spammed arcane explosion. Lots of fun, very effective.
---
I tank endgame dungeons as fury/prot all the time and have no problems finding groups. Idk what you're on about.
---
A certain amount of spell crit is very helpful for Enh Shaman. The gloves that give crit, spell crit, and AP are primo. You can also pick up the mp5/spell crit ring and the spell crit neck from DM.

Would you rather bang a female Centaur with the horse bottom half and top “human-like” half? Or human bottom half and horse top half? 🤔

Druid smart travel form. Cancel any other form and change into Aquatic or Travel form but only if it os possible to use them.  
---
I recommend slapping a spirit weapon at the end of questing or heal weapon if you do PvP for a free weapon swap.

Reminding you that we're talking about forcing people into specific policies. You need to dive deeper and see if it's fair and reasonable. Some of these suggestions she represents create suffering, we need to know if that suffering is really necessary.

I’d say just try and farm SM for a few days. SM is always my go to farm spot. 
---
The humanoid mobs drop cash, cloth, BOEs to sell, and blues to potentially vendor. 
---
Hardest part about it is just finding a decent group.
---
Please don't be a dick, HoJ is insanely good for any melee class, but for a hunter it\`s easily replaceable in a week (2% crit trinket from UBRS quest+class trinket from Dire Maul)
---
Undead gives no PvE advantage. The main reason to pick them is just ganking people.
---
I mean to each their own I guess
---
But I don't really get that so many people talk about "earning" in classic.
---
It is not hard getting to 60
---
It is not hard getting your basic or even epic mount
---
Max profession is a days work
---
When Killed mythic archimonde THAT is an achievement. That was something 99% of the wow players havent done at the time. As I said everyone is free to their own sense of fullfillment but for me getting 60 after mindlessly grinding for 6 days played really isn't that great.
---
And what I really meant is that classic might seem great and all right now, and I mean I'm enjoying myself but I'm 100% aware that in 2 months I won't be playing it anymore cause the game simply doesnt have content. What do you do when you're BiS, have epic mount... And thats basically all you can do.
---
Ofc everyone is enjoying themselves but Classic simply doesn't last, and that will be a shame for new/fresh players in 6 months.
---
Already this afternoon I was the only person only friends list online on classic, this was 30+ a month ago
---
just dont join the groups then?
---
Hmm multiple posts in the same thread, seems we found one of the members!

Running laps around 1k needles?

That dose not equate to a bot, literally have gathermate (or similar) and figure out a route, and run around mining, and people will gather for hours on end...no "bot" required.
---
I'm not wasting any time. And how can my point be pointless?
---
What's the big deal about taming him? I'd want to kill him for loot.
---
Most people don't farm lotus for gph, it's clearly less as it's not guaranteed gold. Also, many people aren't selling their lotus now, they are stockpiling them.
---
ZG, DM or even brd runs are obviously faster and better gph especially as a mage, but that's not why I personally lotus farm
---
I got my epic mount 3 weeks ago and haven't sold a lotus since, but I won't have to buy a flask for the rest of classic wow (and I'll be able to provide flasks for my MT during progression )
---
If you want gph, lotus farming is not for you.

You're not gonna like the answer but... Faerlina.

Sell your leather now and invest it in some BiS recipe or item. Leather takes up too much space for how cheap it is.
---
Are you calling yourself a child?
---
Yeah, hunters don’t suffer as badly as ferals when it comes to hit rating. You guys can’t be parried/glancing blowed either!
---
Being stuck with leather as my ONLY option to find hit rating also makes it considerably harder than plate/mail wearers who have a larger item pool to work with.
---
I’m thinking my next goal is indeed the elven ring and getting the truestrike shoulders that have eluded me.
---
I want to start out by saying it’s my first time ever playing wow. 
---
Now for my question. What is the best place to grind for a swift potion recipe? Like I get that it’s rare. But is there a spot that would up my chances if I got on and farmed there for days?
---
Yeah, that sounds like it could work. I do have the Shadowforge Key, and maybe some parts of it could be made safer with a Gnomish Cloaking Device as well. I am not that well geared yet.

Why remove normal raids? It's not like classic raids are hard so what's the reasoning with that one

Whitemane has a lot of racism against the Taiwanese that play there. Whitemane also has a lot of trade chat bullshit, people selling dumb-ass runs.

You're literally just making shit up because you don't want to accept the undeniable proof I've provided lol....  the server cap DOESN'T CHANGE.

What's the mod to change chat to show level and class etc?

It did change since the launch. At launch the server cap was around 15k-16k. Now it is around 8500.

Mograine EU PvP. I think its 50/50
---
Yeah horde on my server are going to be bored af in phase 2.

I don't know. Waiting for first raid to see what's going on. No rules down in stone which is another red flag.

I acquired the [pattern: bottomless bag](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=14510/pattern-bottomless-bag) a few weeks back. Haven’t been able to sell it for as much as I’d like. Is it worth holding onto? Anyone know how much it’s worth about?

He should give you the money he won't need to make up the difference. You are a leveling team right?

I think you can right click your chat window and join it through the settings

If a pala would get the mageblade before mages/wl I would leave the guild.

It’s the biggest upgrade for a mage, the only slot where the difference between pre raid BiS and raid BiS is enormous.

I dont always do, but when I do...they deserved it

---
Like dps even matters right now. Youre such a tool
---
I'm on thunderfury thanks for the heads up
---
A lot of people say it's not worth halting your exp gain to farm gold for a mount. Keep questing and leveling and you will get the gold passively if you minimize your spending.
---
And that's why I clarified which order to use them in.
---
You may not be trying to be a douche, but you certainly came off as one with that comment. I was asking myself the same question and was glad someone asked it. You also didnt add any kind of thoughtful response, only derision. Cmon.
---
Thanks for the feedback. I’ve never posted to reddit and wasn’t sure on how the community is about posting someone else’s stuff. Cheers!
---
Yes it was
---
There's also tons of "of healing" weapons on the AH. When leveling my pally I would always check for them on my bank alt every day or two. Other healers have it easier because there's always "of healing" staves at all levels, but the "of healing" maces at high levels are rare. I finally nabbed a L50 one that had a ton of healing on it for fairly cheap.
---
THANK YOU!!! I have been in so many arguments about this it's crazy. So much confusion around this.
---
Great so you're arguing against blizzards word with your word and you want me to believe you.
---
You have to have insanely bad ping, like 500+, and it's very easy. Though at that point you are not really "frontstabbing" and you are more lagging so hard that the server and client cannot properly communicate your location fast enough.
---
Retail is different.
---
Blizzard did say they upped the server cap and lowered it with layers.
---
FeelsFuckingBadMan. That sucks dude, but that is what undead rogues do unfortunately.
---
All of that money to play with and you don't invest it in bettering yourself.  Tragic.
---
The choice is on you. Buying the mount means you get one huge goal out of the way. While I do agree that bis epic items are more important to invest in, there are always blue pre-bis alternatives that are just as good. Farming out another 1000g without luck on your side can be quite hard. Not every class can aoe farm like a mage, stealth farm like a rogue/druid, or kite like a hunter/warlock. Unless you plan on respecing Shadow to earn some gold, it will be very hard to do so as a holy priest. 
---
From a personal perspective, I say buy the mount and get it out of the way. With the current patch we're in, and the spell/healing power gear we get early on, it makes raiding a joke. You don't need fully BIS boe epics... You're a holy priest, and a valuable part of a raid. Gear will be funneled to you either way, since gearing tanks and healers is first priority of many raiding guilds.
---
Blizzard does not set the server caps based on server capacity, but on how many players they want on the servers.
---
Blizzard is okay with 5000 players being split on 2 layers, but they will not have 5000 players on 1 layer. So in that way, layering DOES affect capacity. Not because the servers can't handle it, but because blizzard will hardcap the servers.
---
Lmao back in 2005 I swear I was the only one with that pattern; they sold like hot cakes!
---
Interesting, most people just tell me LOL SPELL CRIT JUST GET YOUR PHYS CRIT DUMBASS LOL but I figured at least some should be useful for Elemental Devastation AND also because lets be honest in PVP a shit ton of damage actually comes from Shocks since keeping up melee range is not always possible when people are kiting you hard. So yes, nice I’ll get the neck and those gloves for sure. Also, what about Heliotrope Cloak? that one is a bit too “castery” I guess.
---
My undead priest is rocking the female gnome mask :D
---
Paladin - Seal of light to mob and me. Tab out from wow for 30s to continue doing whatever, come back and see mob alive. Repeat until mob is dead. Jokes aside i really like being able to just basically afk while leveling. Leveling as prot is slow and steady, but you can tank or heal instances quite well.
---
It matters for good players...
---
The worst part about this is that he thinks he was doing you a favor

Warlock is probably one of the easiest classes to level. How are you doing it?

Edge masters since death bringer

Good thing I continued reading comments because I almost said something like "you should post their names because they can just create a new one when they realize that people avoid them". Personally, I still stick by that but apparently that is a no-no around here...
---
Hey actually. Check this out... looks like layering does not effect server cap after all?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dk6gx5
---
Your projecting. I think he was just pointing out that she looks weird/fetal alcohol syndromey. He didn’t say anything about her ideas.
---
Same thing, except obviously spells &amp; effects included damaging spells whereas healing done is just for healing spells
---
But yeah same thing
---
LOL yeah, if you opt out of an easy to get guaranteed prebis maybe not.  But if everyone takes that attitude then it makes a difference.  WoW is about working together and everyone doing small things to make a big impact overall.  When everyone takes the attitude of "I'd rather spend my gold on something else than prebis/enchants/consumables" then it ends up making a pretty big difference in how long it takes overall. 
---
And honestly, you think you really wont make 400 gold in the next 2 months?
---
Remember that Druid has a 30 min cd on res. So it’s not a given that it will be available.
---
This, really.
---
A very small percentage of people know what they are getting into phase 2 lol
---
You can heal brd as shadow as long as the tank isn't under leveled. It's not that hard... Just might take longer
---
This is proof that layering does not effect server cap.
---
What a beautiful horse. Looks like straight out of fantasy movie. It's even being ridden by a gnome.
---
QQ moar

He kinda looks like a gnome on a horse.
---
Sure, but it's still worth a thought, if true.
---
Proof that layering is slicing the pie...
---
is it just me, or are warrior skills more expensive?
---
You're missing the point also you're using caps an capacity as different terms when theyre literally the same. 
---
The layers is based on the capacity th capacity isn't based on the layers.
---
Cap=capacity
---
i'm not buying edgemasters purely because of deathbringer lol.
---
I just want to know which x2 items i should use which i listed above.
---
Traps AYAYA
---
Making an alt for the enjoyment could be a great alternative. Since you're a priest I think Warrior, Rogue, Shaman/Paladin or Druid would give you the most variation.
---
Have fun!
---
you DO realize that the internet isn't perfect right? there could be dozens of problems between you and the server and almost all of the time they are closer to you than it actually being the server.
---
All you have done is partially trouble shot the issue, and you are now assuming that 
---
a. your router is not faulty (power cycling the router dose not always fix it all).
---
b. that the problem dose not start just outside your home (i.e the box outside that provides the whole street).
---
c. that your following hop and the 2 to 6 more through your ISP are fine.
---
d. that even if they are fine the hops your ISP hand off to (another 2 to 6) to finish the connection to the server are ok.
---
e. that there isn't maintenance or cable breaks causing your connection along with thousands or hundreds of thousands to be routed through a lower quality line causing congestion (like an accident would cause on a road and surrounding roads) or that the route that they are giving you isn't making the whole ping take hundreds of MS more (usually an asia thing where connections are forced to the use before routing back to the asia server but it can happen elsewhere)
---
f. that you are not getting throttled.
---
Short of it is, call your ISP...if and when there is an actual connection problem you'll see here or on the forum via dozens of posts made within a few minutes of each other.
---
it isn't possible in classic.  It technically was possible in vanilla but was fixed VERY early on.
---
Can someone verify that you couldn't get manaburned back in 2005 in feral forms? The manaburn behavior in feral forms seen on private servers doesn't count.

Level 34 skills are 1g60s. Level 36 skills are 1g80s. Is that more than others?
---
Not back when I rolled the character it wasn't.
---
As others have said enchanting takes a large investment before people start paying you serious gold for rare enchants. It may take a long time before that investment starts to pay you back. Also, something to keep in mind is that players dont need a lot of enchants over the life of their character so your market is smaller than a profession that creates consumables like engineering or alchemy. Though engineering requires engineering to use the good stuff so that's a huge market either.
---
Is this an alliance guild? I am on Thunderfurry lets go hunt them down !

Shadow priest - knowing that I not only do damage but am constantly topping off HP with vampiric touch. Healers are constantly whispering me about how much easier my class makes dungeons

you are wrong
---
I have at least 13 lvl 120 as well on retail and some lvl 113+ also. I did also have 3 lvl 60 during vanilla. I’m just lvl 45 but I feel zero fullfillment in classic. It is just painful grind. I had epic mount with two chars in vanilla. The first gave me massive fullfillment but the other was just okay. I don’t think getting lvl 60 and gettin some bis will give me massive fullfillment. 
---
Getting 36 mage tower skins in retail was way better than getting these 45 levels ans profession points in retail.
---
Can anyone recommend me an enemy CD tracker for pvp? Can’t seem to find any on twitch app
---
Also, it's the best or maybe close to the best PvP chest for a warrior who doesn't have Savage chest.  I have the other BIS chest pieces and still took the valor chest piece for PvP and mob farming, don't want rogues armor class on all my gear while grinding and pvping, that is for sure.
---
no you can't
---
Go to a pve server
---
There’s certain preBIS items I’ve been trying to farm for 20+ runs. It helps all my runs leading up to the preBIS drop if I secure the upgrade now instead running dungeons with worse items.. people are fuckin dumb
---
&gt; Its because threat in retail works different
---
No, it's because the average player is just bad at the game. Doesn't use a threat meter, doesn't take the time to learn threat calculations, and doesn't stop to ask why they keep pulling aggro and dying. To them, if they die obviously the tank is bad for not holding aggro.
---
*laughs in Warlock*
---
No. I wanted to help you and I no longer care what you believe.

That depends on the source of the electricty you use

PVP on a PVP server?  WHAT IS THIS
---
Hahaha this guys knows
---
You are not a clown but the whole circus.
---
That outfit is awesome. The only problem here is that you are a gnome.
---
Man, that looks hurtful skipping some of those. I wasn't able to afford my mount on my hunter right at 40. But, the quest rewards get pretty good and vendor really well starting at level 40ish. I was able to get it with 6 or 7 gold to spare right after dinging 43. I skipped buying 4 skills and I didn't do any crazy grinding that lasted longer than 20 or 30 mins; just kept questing.
---
You're talking about the problem with retail. The only way to feel any sense of achievement is to finish a final boss mythic raid.
---
There is so many things that gives you a sense of achievement in classic, leveling, gearing up, raiding, pvping, earning gold etc
---
thanks, seems like you hit it on the head there, didn't know it affected crit.  Thanks :)
---
I got mine running some low level dungeon. Just level and if it comes it comes!

There is still another person on the other side of that screen, getting subjected to bad behavior and trolling isn’t acceptable.

Yes he can leave, but even if he did or didn’t that doesn’t change the outcome of what he experienced in the slightest.
---
At that point, why twist OPs arm about it? It’s stupid and doesn’t change the behavior he faced. Just makes this sub look shittier than it already is
---
So dumb man. “Go spend countless hours on an item you probably will never see drop” no respect for your real life at all
---
Phase 2 needs to introduce AV and AB as well. There's zero point in enabling PvP ranks without them. 
---
We already have people whining over rushers being 60 already and they are pushing back telling people to level faster. That's way too much divide in community as is.
---
There's loads of players still in the 30-50 range. What phase 2 will do is make 50+ zones unbearable. Level 60 people will farm players 5+ levels lower for easy honor and it's gonna be hell.
---
Releasing DM this early is proof that Blizzard is aware of this issue. They know world PvP alone isn't gonna keep players interested. If anything it will do more harm than good. 
---
People farmed the fuck out of this game already. A lot have already got bored of the content. World PvP won't solve this issue.
---
didn't know this affected it, thank you!
---
Why can you get banned? Is that common?

You don’t need to use a disability as an insult here. You are now the asshole in this thread. Congrats.

One of each to be safe.
---
I remember in vanilla that not only does ignite stack, it stacks with other mages ignites too, so if you were the first mage to land ignite in a raid and 5 other mages added ignite it was added to YOUR ignite and you were gonna pull Aggro real fast
---
hmm, but did they program her in game version before? it started development in 2001
---
Pet passive before you attempt to feign death and it will work every time

There has been a level 60 gnome mage doing this for 2 weeks in gadgetzan on Incendius. Literally every time I go there he is killing horde.

Exact same thing.
---
10% more love then the next leading brand in fact
---
It's not my belief it's what blizzard said lol..
---
Eldritch leggings and Flameguards only provide 10 ap and 9 agi over devilsaur (as well as some armor) at the cost of 2 hit. Since you want to hit the 9% hit breakpoint you go devilsaur here every time.
---
This is so true, today I was searching for stone guardians in ungoro on my epic mount and this random enemy rogue instantly vanished while killing a mob when I ran by
---
I’m trying to teach Prowl (or whatever it’s called, the skill that allows the pet to go stealth) to my BT, but it won’t learn it. How do I teach it prowl? I already learned it from a previous pet and also successfully trained it to another eligible cat pet.
---
Incendius?
---
I think it depends on server.  I’ve been playing with my buddy who has no WoW experience. He is a warrior and just now getting the hang of tanking (we are lvl 41/42) but we’ve had some great patient groups.

I understand all that but wouldn’t that affect every other game as well?
---
The RP pvp servers in both America and Europe is very balanced and populated. No need to RP. Join them
---
Do you find mind soothe to be too risky in case they resist?
---
If you're a Dwarf or Gnome, Stout Company will welcome you with full Beards and Brews!
---
GNOMES. FUCK GNOMES.
---
ESPECIALLY GNOME ROGUES! K.O.S
---
I never even heard this fucking word in WoW when I played (Vanilla-Cata)
---
I also called and there are no issues they said
---
It only works on humanoids I'm pretty sure
---
This is my first ever toon. Chilling at 47. The only drawback I have is everyone here has played this game so much it seems like some of them are forcing themselves ?   Plus always being talked to like I'm supposed to know what's going on lol like last night I was asked if I had the mallet?  I'm like bro what mallet ? The one for ZF.  And I had to say yeah I have absolutely no idea what you mean we're in the hinterlands why is ZF relevant right now.
---
Says the wl
---
This seemed like a waste of time...
---
Yeah I have been
---
If you\`re a hunter or a feral - sure. But for, say, warlock - you just spam shadowbolt, not much room to screw up.
---
Yeah mage rogues had a very high skill cap but the infinite reset possibility got some of them pretty high.
---
My favorite part is how none of the bis guides seem to give a rat's ass about fire resist which is super fucking important on the rag fight unless you want to keep shelling out 10g per attempt on fire pots
---
Does he have four active skills already (probably bite/claw/dash/growl)? They're like pokemon, only 4 slots for active moves.
---
That's so sad on my lock I got it on my first ogre kill I think my 5th run and I saw it many times after helping guildies :(
---
Thanks you so much! Could only figure out how to do it in 2 macros, this is much more convenient. :)
---
I know, thats why im asking how does spell crit affects the dots. If 2 warlocks use agony (the first wl has 0% spell crit chance and the second has 10% spell crit chance), will they do the same total damage?
---
Not so humble brag?
---
Prat
---
How many training points does your BT have? It might not have enough.
---
Well that doesn’t really help me at all lol since mine is the only one I’ve seen on Bigglesworth
---
Consecration, Blessing of Sanctuary and Holy Shield is all a paladin tank needs. 
---
If I need Holy Shock for taunt I'm not doing things right to begin with.
---
After trying deep prot I can't imagine going deep holy when my goal will be 5mans and PvP.
---
what a dumbass
---
Or because they look cool, or for PVP reasons. PVP =/= ganking

---
Yeah youre right im sure he was i was just explaining the other guy saying this
---
I’m not sure why you are downvoted. I guess dumb people don’t know what downvote button is for, either. I wish I were dumb.
---
At least 1 Shaman should be tank healing imo for the 25% armour buff
---
Oh right, forgot the satyrs are demons.
---
You aware of how many horde dominated servers there are in comparison?
---
&gt;Have you ever tanked?
---
Yes.  Quite a lot.
---
&gt;Dps is really chill compared to tanking
---
Only if we're talking about a bad tank and a bad DPS.  Being a good tank is equally as chill as being a good DPS.  The only real difference between tanking and damage dealing is that as the tank you set the pace and direction of the instance, but that's a bit daunting for like two runs while you learn the instance and then a perk for every run thereafter.
---
I skipped devilsaur. Trueaim gauntlets from LBRS are like 4% hit all on their own and there's 0 competition on them. Crazy how much people are valuing things because they're told it's the best
---
&gt; I have so many vanilla first time kills which anchored on my Spirit leveraged darkmoon card: blue dragon priest.
---
YOU'RE GOD DAMNED RIGHT
---
Fire mages hate him
---
You 100% do. I've been running DM and often regenning for 8-10s while I wait for the tank to hit about -1.5k to queue the next heal
---
No dawg
---
15 lotus a day since launch date? I have my doubts, you wouldnt be able to pick them instantly and it feels like we're assuming legit 0 competition. I might be wrong but dont think so.
---
It's different for everyone, so I respect that with you. You might not find enjoyment in the game like how I don't find enjoyment in reading books or going to a concert.
---
I don’t think Earthfury is dead. I’ve been leveling for several weeks and everywhere is populated and I can always find a group.
---
I think strath. The difference in sides is pretty cool. 
---
Let’s be honest, I’m just being nice hoping it helps my gear drop.
---
It’s not an official chat. Anyone can create a chat, but /world is a common chatroom people join, but since its unofficial whatever player is controlling it can do whatever they want with it
---
oh THAT much later. now it makes more sense, probably not worth him holding onto the cage until classic wotlk tho
---
I believe sulfuras isn't bad
---
Yasss hunny werq that harness betch
---
Just realized I need to go through and fix the styles for mobile today XD
---
They all do.. It's not possible not to. A macro can't check gcd and you can't shift in if you're on gcd. You're looking for the impossible.
---
Still, better than a j*nnie
---
The best is still the toon called Azerothprime that's selling subscriptions to weekly packages in the mail containing flasks, food and consumables for raid tailored to your class.
---
There's 96 per day per layer. 
---
15 a day is not out of the realm of possibility, yes it's lucky as FUCK, but OP obviously puts in the work and is probably not on one of the top 10 largest servers. 
---
I've found 7 in a day on 2 seperate days, if I was looping for another 6+ hrs it could've hit 12 or even 15 if I was insanely lucky that day, and I'm on a top 5 NA server for population
---
It seems unlikely but this dude is legit he even streams
---
Based on your post history get him a ball fondler
---
which item is best? edgemaster's is best. Deathbringer is literally THE reason to buy it for human
---
See I'd argue the opposite. I don't want to play as a rotting corpse lmao
---
Honestly, and I don't mean to be rude, but I can see why a person would want a healing spec for a level 56 healer for, say, an Emp run in BRD.
---
cringe
---
These type of world drops are in some ways impossible to farm up yourself.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=2555/recipe-swiftness-potion
---
It’s drops over 200 different mobs, with a .03% drop. Things like that are entirely random. Farming only makes sense when something has a specific set of mobs that can drop it and a somewhat respectable drop rate even .5-1%.
---
These typically don’t sell for that much because it drops of low level mobs and the sheer number of people killing them makes it a common thing (thousands of people killing thousands of mobs).
---
You’re better off just buying the thing from the AH and grinding the gold for it. It would be faster.
---
You play a class that specifically is incredibly good at tanking large groups of mobs. Use a druid or a warrior tank and a mage makes their job a lot easier.
---
I had the same issue and this worked for me. Open up terminal and type in: defaults write com.blizzard.worldofwarcraft disable-expose-fix -bool YES
---
lol u okay dude
---
He’s such a happy little dictatortot
---
Yeah and you need an acorn, but hopefully you aren’t wiping every 10 secs haha
---
I think in later expansions they made him an elite boss? Someone else can write the sequel. Classic Gamon is my Gamon
---
Only if you've specced shatter. Someone on an AOE blizzard leveling spec very well may not have given the fact blizzard can't crit.
---
It could be trained but not on the pet bar.
---
I'm not talking about any sort of technical limitations.
---
Awesome advice. Thank you
---
Did you have to do anything through the Razer app and add-on or only this?
---
Why did you stay with them?
---
That’s pretty boss.
---
Broadband is used for many things other than gaming though. High resolution business conference calls likely account for a large percentage of the broadband streaming footprint. Netflix and similar services would also have a big chunk.
---
If you aren't streaming your gameplay, the amount of data transmitted back and forth between you and the server while you play is relatively miniscule. Gaming is a drop in the ocean compared to the bandwidth requirements of video/audio transmission, and gaming streamers are a similar drop in the ocean when it comes to the bigger picture of streaming services.

So I'm 3 bars away from lvl 40 as a Undead rogue. Got my mount money ready and still enough left to train al untrained skills. Is it wise to train them all now or Just the ones I use most (evis, ss, garote and instant poison).
---
My profs are herb and skinning. My plan was to catch up with herb because I forgot to level it during questing. Is this wise or is it maybe better to switch it up with another proff.
---
Also as a combat rogue, where should I be questing from lvl 40? Or is it maybe better xp wise to try and do some meleecleave/farm runs?
---
Thanks in advanced.
---
As the GM for a casual/relaxed guild, it's hard to find new members. Our only req is that you use Discord, because we have a lot of fun in vc and it makes coordination easier. That and help out guildies as you can.
---
That's it! Want to rush to 60? We'll cheer you on! Want to roll your 6th alt? We'll help run you through stuff. We just want to find a group to have fun with and of all the folks on our server, we have like 15 active members. It makes be a bit sad because I'm afraid we'll die out shortly due to not being active enough. But we're all casual adults with jobs and families and everything else. We just want to have fun.
---
The weird part is there are plenty of other belts with +healing so essentially he is wasting an equip attribute. I’m glad I won it and really wouldn’t rage if he did but just thought it was weird.
---
I surely did play more on higher level and every single post you made here just proves it. So yes, I won. Not only because I have more experiance and kknowledge, but also because you have no valid arguments and starts to be offensive. You may want to reconsider your life and attitude towards people who know just a bit more than you do.
---
You can also fish the pools for a full 2 hours, the pools will still spawn even if someone already won the contest for the week.
---
I would go for the mount asap. As people have commented before me time is money and that extra 40% is really enjoyable. Especially if you are a miner/herb picker
---
Does this please you :)
---
Is it mildly infuriating :)
---
Man you aren’t kidding, even at low levels. I was going to heal an SFK run on my druid alt with my girlfriend who is a mage. She’s brand new and the class fits what she wanted, she doesn’t care if it’s good or not. So we look for DPS. Immediately get another mage, ok, fair enough. Another mage asks for an invite. I ask them if they’re fine with having a third one, but then I see a request from a rogue and immediately invite him. Turns out he’s a level 40 and wants to carry us through for loot. No thanks. So I go back to asking, and someone asks for an invite. 
---
What do you know,
---
It’s a mage. 
---
Really smooth run though so whatever. But they are just everywhere.
---
Of course but that’s not nearly as funny
---
I've tanked LBRS as 57 with little to no problems, at least problems relating to my tanking capabilities.
---
fuck that oust the pedo
---
He said you DONT need a second healer. You missed that one completely..
---
And hes right, the healer vs dps demand is entirely level and server related but its NOT as you assumed at every level on every server. I know plenty of dps that will heal to get easy groups and the healer demand is not nearly as high as youre making it out to be. Specifically in endgame dungeons caster dps are CONSISTENTLY higher demand than healers and in MC/ONY Warlocks specifically are THE SINGLE highest demand class in the game. 
---
You just lookin for an excuse to be a contradictory asshole bruh. Your fuckin WC groups dont count
---
It's all due to the lying loading screen telling players here is no cow level.
---
If not for that a lot more people would go there
---
Only equip BiS. You should be naked level 1-60 and only wear the best items for each slot. When Naxx comes out, no loot from MC anymore. Do it naked because best is in Naxx
---
This is false though. BiS for shirt is pink mageweave; for every class, min/max, or casual. You may not like it, but that is reality.
---
It seems you again failed to comprehend. If you want I can help understand what inference is.
---
Old school like what? Prior to the digital age, any social activity required its participants to be in the same location. So unless you only want to socialize with the people in your own home, SOMEBODY has to travel. Travel has a larger footprint than playing a game online.
---
Just do the ones you use most unless it’s a ridiculous abundance of gold, repair costs will go up. But now that you have the mount. You’re not really saving for anything for the next 15 levels go crazy
---
Banned from that chat channel by another player who currently has ownership of the channel. Not a ban on your account or any action from Blizzard in any way, it is completely fine to use.
---
On Whitemane, there is a guy named Shirt who does this.

10/10. Shirts made by shirt is a better theme.

Oh ok
---
Centaurs have two rib cages
---
I can join any group as tank or healer, or solo out in the open world at \~90% of optimal efficiency with a single spec, all it takes is a gear swap. Makes it really easy to socialize. (Druid)
---
Makes no sense that ita gonna get worse in phase 2. People who want to grief are griefieng now and people who want honot wont be camping dungeon entrances for sure
---
Off with ya!
---
Google USS Liberty
---
That's how I got my key.  LBRS is not a very fun dungeon and I don't think much of anything worthwhile for a tank drops there other than the gloves off Wyrm which are a DPS item anyways.
---
However there are a lot of really desirable items for healers, rogue/fury and casters.  
---
Personally I never spam LFM shit reserved, but it isn't exactly rare to see groups only needing a tank, and if I need something from a dungeon, especially a dungeon I don't enjoy I will always ask about the loot situation and that will be considered when I decide whether or not I want to come.
---
/hug
---
Strange considering i've done it and had other people tell me they've had it happen too..  I must be playing a different classic than you are.
---
Hey stop being mean to this poor Tauren woman.  HOW DARE U

On PVP server looking to swap to pve because PvP just stresses me out.

Really hate leaving multiple level 30s and all that gold but I just don't enjoy PvP as much as my friends.

This is on Netherwind, everyone was poking fun of Lacoste in lookingforgroup chat last night for his ads

being super mad for no reason and unironically calling someone a casual. nice contribution

Another great video! Mages should be throwing frosbolts though. (Source: I am a Mage)
---
Yes back in the day we used to socialize with people in the neighbourhood and got there with a complex method that required moving our legs.

And distances below 2 miles are easily walkable ( at least on one side of the atlantic if statistics are to be believed)

WHOA WHOA WHOA.

Ease off the racism guy.
---
that makes sense, but that was the only think i could feasibly think of. maybe there could be a modifier of the area you’re in?

https://imgur.com/a/axMA2QL
---
Sorry bud but as usual I'm right.  Layering is for overpopulation in specific areas and has no impact on the overall server capacity or queues.
---
You cannot as it is not an official channel. You can join LookingForGroup this way though which is the official global channel.
---
Since you brought it up: Yeah tanking... I'm not sure how I feel about it anymore. I mean, being a tank in a nice dungeon group (or raid) where everyone follows the markings, CC's accordingly, is able to think for themselves etc. is imo the best feeling in WoW. 
---
On the other hand, tanking in a group where the mage jumps around doing arcane explosion constantly and then whines when he dies, the warlock does a 1500 shadowbolt crit before the mob you carefully range pulled even reaches you, the fury warrior charges in and does a whirlwind before you've had a chance to hit the 2nd mob in a big group... Yeah you know... Embracing the chaos can be pretty hard some times :P
---
Guess you were wrong and I was 100% right
---
I had something peculiar happen with loot that could be the cause. I had plenty of space in my bags, we all rolled, and chat said I won. By chance, I saw the loot sparkle on the mob and thought it had dropped something else for me, but when I looked it, it was only the item I just won the roll on.
---
So I won the roll, but the item wasn't automatically looted, I had to manually loot it from the corpse.
---
Why are only two people needing on a belt with intel?
---
That's after spending 30 minutes looking for a healer because they forgot to put healer loot in the tribute chest.
---
Are you a hunter ? How do you « jump » on someone ? I’m a dwarf hunter and I’d like to know how to do that

Go herbalism/alchemy. It\`s pretty easy to level (esp. compared to smth like BS or, god forbid, enchanting) and demand for potions will only increase in later phases.
---
Ah fair my bad, learn something new every day thanks
---
Firemaw has been getting 2k queues again so I'm not quite sure about that
---
The issue with what you're saying is that you are the 1%. You don't make a game for the 1% because it's not sustainable. And trust me, I'm someone who made my characters to raid and to parse. I want that 99% ranking because that's fun for me. I boosted most of my characters because I fucking despise leveling in retail. But Classic is a different kind of enjoyment.
---
The beauty of classic comes from people who enjoy DnD and tabletop games. You aren't the 1% in most of those games, and yet you don't care. Trillions of other people have killed orcs or have gotten that +1 sword, but you don't care because it's YOURS.
---
Retail doesn't have that same magic feeling and I really can't explain why. Maybe it's the same reason most DnD 5e games don't go past level 10, once you become the center of attention, it becomes boring.
---
ask the warrior discord instead of randomers on reddit.
---
All I did was install Razer synapse and run that command. I don’t think I did anything extra
---
Two words... Mind Control.
---
Great in pvp, great to mc adds in a group and figure out what cool spells or buffs you can add to your group.
---
sure, i just don't count dungeons at level 60 content. Given how long an instance is you of course will regen naturally sometimes. Just that in raid you mostly either cast or drink.
---
We really can’t. the only way we can kill you is if either:
---
1. we get lucky and somehow manage to kill you before you nova/blink/whatever
---
2. you suck and don’t time your blinks and novas correctly
---
mages should never ever lose to a warr 1v1. the entire mage kit is basically designed to hard counter warriors
---
I don't think haste even affects cast speeds in classic. It's just attacks
---
Meanwhile your raid in MC is like, "ok everyone inside? Let's ready check to pull".
---
Lvl 31 arms warrior. I tanked RFK, rolled need on Corpsemaker as it was a massive upgrade to the staff I was still using from WC. I win the roll.
---
Shaman immediately drops group, calls me a loot ninja, blocks me and starts spamming general that I'm a loot ninja and should be blacklisted.
---
IMO I did nothing wrong here. Sure I put on a shield for the run, but 90% of the time I'm using a 2h so it was a significant upgrade for me. And obviously why I was running the dungeon, having organised the group myself. Thoughts?
---
Congrats brotha!
---
He got you good good
---
So people aren't allowed to ever roll on non BIS?
---
How would anyone ever get upgrades if there are only 17 items in the lategame worth having lmao
---
I'm just curious here, but how can you tell they're bots?  From what I've seen (read here) it seems like blizzard has been cracking down hard on TOS violations.

I enjoyed you giving credit good job

The main hand dropped on my first 2 runs :p

And you can MC stuff since you\`re not healing. Do you know that shadowhunters in ZF and witch doctors in ST know a version of Hex that doesn't break on damage?
---
then they pop wotf and just charm u
---
Tusks brother not fangs
---
Lmao relax people, give a quick look on this guy's comment history first. Just an actual sad person with internet access.
---
So, you and the tank leave group and re-form together, then find some more.
---
....what
---
This is mind blowing
---
Jesus Christ dude. Whisper the tank. You both drop the group and form one together. The headache of find another 3 is nothing compared to that
---
Not on hit gear. I'd roll in spell damage upgrades but never with hit on

---
The guy's behavior was dickish no doubt, and I agree with a lot of the comments here about the end game content in Classic being easy which means you don't necessarily need the best gear to complete it, but there is a rationale to this type of loot prioritization. Here is the etiquette I respect and appreciate.
---
For one, I appreciate competitive gaming, to me it's a fair to seek to acquire the best gear for your spec. For that reason, imo, someone for whom an item is BiS has priority over someone for whom it's not. Along those lines, I think it's a bit of a faux pas to just spontaneously need on an item because it's an upgrade without considering that someone else may be running specifically for it, especially if it's a much more significant item for them. If an item drops and it's BiS i'll go for it, as is expected. If it isn't BiS and it's BoP, however, I find it always best to state you want to need. Most of the time, if no one already had their eyes on it, people will be glad for you and tell you to go for it.
---
Either way, mistakes happen, some people are new to the game or play it for different reasons, so i think it's just best to go about things with clear communication (ideally ahead of time) to avoid misunderstanding and to stay polite no matter what.
---
T-bagging is soooo 2008.
---
Also cry me a river for someone messing around with MC. That shit is always hilarious no matter the outcome.
---
I did this last week, was in cat form. Was able to pick up the letter
---
Lol.
---
Saw it the the first time at 70 runs. Since I only ran Angerforge with it reserved, i got it at 70th run.
---
How efficient is boosting in dungeons for leveling? I plan on leveling an alt on my second accout and ive been think about using my lvl 60 warrior to boost it trough dungeons from like lvl 1-40. Is it a reasonable ammount of xp or am I better of questing/doing dungeons with equal lvls?
---
Yea but people abuse the shit out of it so it’s not used as intended no matter how mad you get.
---
Wtf... Ok, tyvm for the warning. Much appreciated.
---
No one can help you because it's value is subjective.
---
It’s clearly a joke though...
---
Ok lol
---
I agree. It all depends on how they say it. If they're like "Hey it's my bis. Can you not need?" I'll pass everytime.
---
It's the ones that basically say "fuck you it's not bis why would you need" that I end up needing. Though, it's only if it is a straight upgrade for me.
---
There is no world chat, just use LFG
---
You literally are incorrect.
---
Making Alts is so you can have other professions, have another bank, and fill roles in dungeons that your priest can’t fill. Maybe roll DPS this time or another class. Instead of mining smithy go herb/alch or make an enchanted to disenchant items for your other charecter. I wouldn’t see it as grinding again just adding another horse to your stable on the server.
---
Should be in in AQ patch I believe
---
Damn man, making me feel for the guy while I’m chopping..eh..goddamn onions over here !? Not cool.
---
Says a lock lol

I had one of these last night on Thunderfury. Doing SM Library wing with three members of a guild. The rogue needs on the dog whistle off Loksey. Couple of us question why the hell that was a need roll but whatever. Then he ninjas a BoE Blue out of a chest he was unlocking, and rants at us about how it "isn't fair" that he has to give it up when he was the only one who could unlock it. To top that off, we start getting realy hectic add-in pulls all over the place in the last stretch, including the boss getting pulled on us while we're already fighting two packs. I see the Guardian Hyena from the dog whistle running out of the room, and the rogue tells us he "hopes we die in pain and fire."
---
The upside to this story is that I managed to find an officer of his guild to report the behavior and the guild officer was very open to talking out the issue and filing my grievance, so hopefully something comes of that.
---
TL;DR: Avoid Grimtooth on Thunderfury. Loot thief who tried to intentionally wipe us.
---
Is it ok? Yes, I did fine at 59 but getting invited in the first place was the hard part so it's better to start groups yourself.
---
  Also be prepared that if you have a pug group of 60s that are bad they may unfairly lay blame on you for them being bad.
---
Brother this post has nothing to do with that.  This post is mostly at the people who think when a server goes from 2 layers to 1 that the servers player cap (and therefor queues) are affected.  The cap is unchanged
---
well it's not straight botting but i've seen people running in circles with very "mechanic" movements, basically turning in one go like when you hold right mouse and turn camera then left click. Tried to pm him, didn't respond for hours before telling me it wasn't a bot but a macro program (i think it was razer

I do. I just didnt put the growl skill among others

This is not nearly as stressful as /roll-ing. There’s not the same buildup/back and forth/anticipation

I think a leveling warrior has good need for a 2 handed, specially at lower levels. Bulk of the time you're soloing missions in two handed mode.
---
They fixed that over 14 years ago. You're only now getting upset over it??
---
Wait what. I grabbed a lvl 50 mace of the healing the other day and it was +22. Does it have a range?
---
Mage, these kids love spending ten minutes telling the the whole group how they like to do ZF and how it’s the best method, also get mad when you kill a mob that is “not necessary” to there ZF run and complains about every little fucking thing... usually has whole group wipe, while making us wait in certain points instead of just killing mobs.

I have Hermès dude.
---
True, but after filling out the necessary points for the AoE spec you're about level 50. Those last 10 points don't offer much to improve AoE, so you might as well go for other great talents, such as Shatter. Great for PvP, great for single target and honestly also great to finish off an AoE pull via Nova -&gt; (Flamestrike -&gt;) CoC -&gt; AE all critting instead of going for another Blizzard. And also great for situations like these in BRD.
---
But there shouldn't be a "house" in gambling between players in an online game. Look at the other gambling in other games like ppl staking for runescape gold and whatnot
---
*Side effects might include disregard for said life, growth of beard in the neck area and voluntary loss of sleep*
---
Yeah, it's pretty easy tbh. Around 20 minutes per run, as long as you don't get any resisted FDs.
---
Enha Shaman. Pure RNG class.
---
Movement is a big giveaway as mentioned below, instant direction changes with no camera pan. That and people ignoring messages, pvp etc while running the exact same route (like 100% the same every time I see them)
---
Oh man the go guy kills it hahahah
---
Your explaination is very helpful. I've been in a rut with my currently lvl 36 pali. It's hard to realize that if I want to raid later on, I will have to be a healer instead smiting with a huge hammer. However, I should be fine if I find the right people and play the way I want to. You weren't exactly giving me advice, but thanks anyway (:

It is going to be freaking amazing! Soooo many people think they ate going to get rank 14 and most are going to get a hard reality check. This guy is right too, horde are goin to harvest alliance to extinction. I'm not going to say that will be good for the game but it sure as hell will be entertaining!
---
He knows why he got flamed, he literally states why he got flamed more than once. The discussion is how pathetic it is to flame someone for taking an upgrade just because it's not BiS.
---
People are saying your mentality is sad, that's it.
---
I was thinking that as well, but haven’t gotten any haste to confirm or deny, thanks :)
---
Tldr; you suck at the game and dont know how to play hunter. Hunter is amazing in pvp.
---
[This says it all buddy.]

---
First time reading someone say hunter is a shittier mage as well, hahah, hunter curbstomps mage everytime if you are semi-decent. If you're really 8/8 giantstalkers I feel.bad for the other hunters in your guild for losing t1 to a baddie bfa player.
---
Class checks out lol.
---
Cheers mate
---
On a spreadsheet (the warrior DPS spreadsheet by Steppenwolf of Fight Club discord), the devilsaur set gives you +2 more dps, without consumables, when otherwise in pre-raid bis, as a human. Devilsaur is the answer here. Also...
---
Deathbringer in your offhand with your gear is bad for a human. It is a substantial DPS loss. The quest reward Mirah's Song gives you +21 dps over using the Deathbringer. The slow speed of the Deathbringer does nothing for the offhand, and not being sword/mace hurts a lot.
---
Edgemaster's is bad for you, since you have Ironfoe already - there isn't really a way to shuffle around the gear to make Deathbringer better for you as a human than using Ironfoe with an offhand sword or mace. If trying to min-max dps, swords and maces are best for now.
---
Can\`t pop it if they\`re dead.
---
Thanks.
---
That worked thank you so much! Razer support was never able to help me with it after 3 different requests
---
He's talking out of his ass. Ion said in an interview that each layer was the size of a 2005 sized server, which means roughly 3000 players.
---
With one layer 3000 people can be online at the same time, with two layers it's 6000, with three layers it's 9000 and so on.
---
Laying exhausts soley for certain places to not be over populated? 
---
You argue for that but the fact is, is that it doesn’t get used for its purpose it was intended For. Therefore it’s just an extremely easy way for people to abuse the game and farm items endlessly like we have already seen.
---
I feel like there is PvP and there is attacking people who have no chance of fighting you back
---
And you don't happen to see the irony of you calling them a crybaby over having fun at someones expense?
---
For a loooooong time I was the only armorsmith and dragonscale leatherworker on Eredar server. I had every single pattern fron Lionheart to Storm gaunts to dreamscale armor to the dark iron patterns and exhalted by TB
---
Well you definitely can even if youre not supposed to
---
Ok but this thread isn't about layering abuse.  Go froth at the mouth somewhere else
---
ok forget the deathbringer.
---
im using ironfoe and mirahs song. what items do i use which i listed above?
---
Just ask joker.
---
No to Edgemaster's and also no to Deathbringer, for single target dps, because human and Ironfoe.
---
Gettin' a BJ =/= bestiality.
---
Tappin' that = bestiality.
---
For anyone wondering at home.
---
It's not tgw Legion client, it's the BfA client. This was changed like a year ago, where have you been LOL
---
Just keep reporting, blizz will get them eventually.  A dead giveaway for botting is the turning thing you're describing.  Generally slow moving, kill, keyboard turning in the direction of another mob, attack, pause, loot,pause,keyboard turn again to the next mob.  
---
Back in vanilla I used one of those third party "services" to level a druid for me on a different account.  One day I set out to find it in westfall, and this is what it was doing.  A day or two later the account got banned.
---
I feel you, just putting in my opinion on what you said about your post. It’s mid leading and seems like your a big fan on layering. No need to get hostile buddy I can post here if I want thanks.
---
She doesn't look like she has fetal alcohol syndrome. Please grow up.
---
Do ambush dagger leveling! It's way more fun than combat and if the druid is tanking youll get hella backstabs and ambush which is great for short fights
---
Yup, not a hunter, playing a warrior. You can only charge out of combat, he left my in polymorph long enough to charge and defeat him :p
---
IT WAS A GUILD RUN AND EVERYONE AGREED TO GREED IT, HE ROLLED LAST AND ACTED LIKE HE DIDNT SEE THAT
---
Who asked for 1.12?
---
People were basically shouting at them to do 1.12 with no changes like private servers, so that's what they did
---
That guy's not tryhard, he's just stupid. 
---
There's solid reasons to roll on dungeon set gear. T.5 later on requires it, for example. Needing it isn't unreasonable, if it's your classes' dungeon set.
---
What server are you on?
---
I know Discord turns a lot of people off as they aren't comfortable voice chatting.  I am halfway there as I don't mind voice chat.. but I don't enjoy it when playing a MMORPG.  I much prefer to be listening to some music, an audiobook, or a podcast.
---
Hope to never play with you, you're clearly toxic.
---
We just had 4 people Gquit after our 3rd guild MC because we moved from free rolls to loot council. The people who left had multiple T1, T2 helms, TOEP, Mana Ignited Cord, all acquired during our guild runs. People are so greedy and don't understand how loot works in vanilla. Sigh...
---
On my realm healers are overpopulated for making up a 5th of a party.
---
LFG is generally people asking for either tanks or dps and on the rare ocassion a healer spot opens up you are lucky to get it if you instantly message the leader because multiple other people have too.
---
I will buy one if you’re horde Herod
---
Why does AP from items grant Range AP but not buffs?
---
Way worse getting Briarwood trinket. I think Reddit because I yelled AAAAAAAAAAAAAA and got it on the first drop.
---
Yeah I always say im needing on items. Unless its obvious. OP doesn't mention if anyone else needed on the item.
---
Love the vids. What server are you on? I saw the &lt;Heavy Drinkers&gt; guy in party and I may have found my people.
---
You massively misunderstood what you read.
---
That is the classic experience.
---
Stupid sexy Night Elf...
---
most times a healer gets aggro it is because some moron rips a mob off the tank so the tank has no threat on that mob. tank is dealing with the rest of the pack and congratulates the dps on tanking that mob. sometimes the dps drops threat and the mob goes to next highest on the table which is the spamming healer rather than the tank who has had no time or globals to get threat into the ripped mob.
---
tl:dr hunters and mages rip shit then block or fd and boom dead healer.
---
He could do herb + skinning or mining then switch to alchemy at 60. Stealth runs for herb and mining at 60 would be pretty nice
---
Weeps-Greymane here

You are fine and nta
---
Its not being a dick, it's 3rd BiS for a Hunter. I gave HOJ to the warrior TANK when it dropped, so yeah I'm not a douche. But yeah if it drops and a melee doesn't need it I'm taking it, I don't really care if u want to vendor or DE it. I can use it either way.
---
youre so 2000 and late
---
Findings are not inconclusive. That's a factually wrong thing to say.
---
I'm a hunter, have DM north on farm right now. I've run 10 times this morning haven't seen one book spawn. WTF is going on? Any idea on the spawn rate. Literally scouring this place with my king buff and cant find shit
---
Half of razorgore where I am is filled with try hards, so sad to see the game being spoiled by stupid behaviour.
---
It's not misleading it's an extremely clear factual statement that has nothing to do with people abusing layering.  Your own bias makes you think everything is about that.   Blocked
---
thats what im saying man. id rather fucking wipe and disband at the top of the meter than wait 5-6 secs and not be first.
---
your mom is a shit stain
---
Down ranking is a thing at that level I promise you. If I didn’t I’d be in the same boat as you.
---
There’s almost no way at level 48 that you don’t have any plus healing/. SD items... there’s extremely cheap in AH most of the time, and increase the efficiency of down ranking spells. 
---
Started healing ZF at lvl 43 and have had no problems at all.
---
how can mage loose to a warrior\^\^ just kitte him like a mob
---
So basically warriors are the new hunters? They get all the str AND agi gear?
---
This is factually incorrect. You can test the greenhouse effect on your own with simple materials.
---
You don't need a "good resource online" when you can see it ingame or on wowhead.
---
Clearly he does not, shit if I was the spriest and died I would have shared the video exploiting my stupidity lol
---
You know it's a fucktard you're dealing with when they speak in memes.
---
While spell hit is admittedly less useful for paladins than it is for other casters. It still has its uses. And yes. There are plenty of plus healing belts. But I know at least my 57 pally doesn’t have one. And I have been trying to build a healer kit since I was in the 20’s. May have been the same for this pally. Stat priority’s in no particular order for holy pallys is plus healing/magic, spell crit, int, and stamina. Hit slightly increases crit and makes it less painful for us to solo content in between dungeons and raids.
---
But it’s not my mentality. It’s common god damn sense
---
They may just go by "red equals dead" like many other players.
---
Teleports &amp; Portals.
---
My hearthstone is currently set to Feathermoon so I can quickly join in DM groups. :)
---
You might check out this video! It has some info about the mechanics of totem twisting, then some potential hybrid builds like the one you're talking about.

---
I was like half asleep if I recall, but any part of the body is due for a good ole clam slam
---
This. Items like HoJ have 3% drop chances. Briarwood drops off a rare mob and EVERYONE in your 10m generally needs it.
---
Sure, aspiring to the items is good, put there are many more reasonable stopgap pieces, especially now with DM released.
---
That sounds like way more fun. I want to be able to just stealth onto people together and blow them up lol. Do you have any recommended builds?
---
*DM. Who the fuck is calling it VC?
---
Mount all the way. A good guild will help you get that bis stuff but your mount is all you.
---
Yeah no. Bounce the minute this crap starts happening. Why waste your time?
---
So like 
---
/cast Pickpocket
---
/cast Garrote
---
And it’ll pickpocket then garrote?
---
Best thing I've found for pet management in combat is scroll wheel up for pet attack, scroll wheel down for pet retreat.

you earned this upvote
---
It's clearly projection.
---
That's not a source
---
Come and camp me, I'll be waiting for ya.
---
I feel you.  Having a competent tank is generally much less exciting than a tank who spends three minutes analyzing every pull when the healer has only been using 30% of their mana per pack and still has 50% left, or who falls into a weeping pile whenever a DPS pulls threat from them because they're so insecure and high-strung that they can't help but see it as some kind of personally frustrating experience.
---
In ZF at lvl 48 this guys should have no problem keeping EVERYONE AT 100% throughout the whole dungeon. Mana conserv is so easy in ZF, even when I wand almost every mob at lvl 44. 
---
Get some good water, cast a max rank greater heal/renew and drink right after in the same game tick and it will let you drink in combat.
---
Don't really see a point in posts like this.
---
"Some guy took a shit on my table at a restaurant, AITA for asking him to clean it up?"
---
48 rogue now, but I was 40 only a few days ago (albeit on Alliance side).  I finished all of SoS, StV, and Arathi around that level, plus an SM and Uldaman run.  Got me to like 43, where I could realistically start doing Tanaris.
---
Ouch someone is a little salty and defensive about here post... sorry to have ruffled your feathers there boss lmao
---
Feign Death
---
It's common sense not to take a gear upgrade nobody else wants because there's better items in the game...? Fuck me you're hopeless
---
Most probably where the parents got the name from lol.
---
When you say potting, are you referring to drinking a potion? I ask because I was under the assumption you couldn't do that when shape shifted
---
Thank you for this, ive gotten downvoted and argued against for saying this. 
---
Also i dont get how people can misunderstand this post and start arguing about other things you arent even saying. I guess a lot of people just likes to start fights.
---
You think you do, but you don’t
---
Jep. Add #showtooltip Garrote at the beginning to keep the icon and tooltop of garrote
---
100% just do dme drop farms it's a lot of exp but once you get used to it you can plvl someone that is just able to enter the dungeon
---
&gt;A Fury Warrior said that Truestrike was BiS till AQ.
---
I'd replace them with the 20 20 19 shoulders from BWL, thb.
---
Ah yes, the human shield for politics. Poor, poor child.
---
In Legion (previous retail expansion) they were forced to make master loot only useable by raid groups because *every* run would have reserved loot. Towards the end of WoD it got ridiculous, the only way to get good gear was if you made groups yourself. 
---
It's so sad that the gaming community has changed so much that they had to do that. Also, it's a bad sign for classic if things develop like they did in retail. At the start of WoD you'd see a reserved run here and there, but it just keep spreading and eventually it's all ruined. Despite what people here claim, the community really isn't that different, but hopefully somehow we can stop the reserve tide.
---
If I loose no portal
---
If I win free portal

The prick just wanted a free portal
---
Horde scum. It's reasons like this I go on horde killing sprees in Hillsbrad and stv. I used to let the lowbie be but now I kill them likw I get paid to.
---
You don’t level as a heal spec. You level as int dps or keep a seperate int set. There is no need for healing talents in dungeons. You’re making it much harder on yourself in all aspects of the game. You can’t quest and you can’t find groups. No idea why anyone would level as heals.
---
But it has to be terrain abuse right? An ally was camping the Qia vendor in Everlook and sitting a corner where they don't get aggro from the guards. They kept griefing horde trying to get the tailoring patterns. Is that bannable too or does it have to entail some sort of "exploit"?
---
Or during the run itself.
---
Udderly underrated.
---
The rule defines "first to roll 1", nothing more - nothing less. Such is life, unfair.
---
Unlikely
---
&gt; I just say "It's better than what I have, therefore I'm needing. I don't care about your bis."
---
I think that while you sure are allowed to roll on it, rolling on someone else's BiS just because it's an upgrade for you is kind of bad manners.
---
Hoj is Shit for huntards if you don’t know that.
---
It does not apply to range attacks
---
Get brightcloth cloak, great for leveling tailoring. Bags go green anyway well before 300.
---
Establish the rules at the start. 
---
I lost out to the sword from VanCleef to a tank. Next Deadmines run I said in Party chat I won’t Need on anything other than the sword if it dropped. Kept to my word and the rest of the group was happy to pass when the sword dropped. 
---
Agreeing rules at the start is always the best way to go.
---
okay for levelling go for full backstab builds both of you. and just pull a mob or two, and backstab whatever mob is attacking the other guy.
---
 Screw combopoints, you won't have time to use them shit will die so fast, just maximum backstab.
---
let druid get herb/alch, good buffs while levelling, also good money from some herbs.
---
dungeon is easy with druid, druid can do anything, but mostly tank.
---
I can’t recommend Bloodsail Buccaneers enough. It’s a RP-PVE server. Nothing but positive experiences there
---
Dude. This change was like over 10 years ago.
---
Apparently you get downvoted if you provide proof too lol
---
Yeah, give me my fucking key ring.
---
Ohh, that makes sense..
---
I would say yes and no, the game has a lot of grinding and stuff as a part of it, and you can definitely find some tryhards out there in the world - you should also probably join a PvE server instead of PvP otherwise you will likely constantly get ganked (Killed by much higher level players). Other then that its great, its a good challenge compared to retail and dungeons and questing is pretty fun. theres also a ton of resources out there to help you out such as wowhead.
---
Set the radius to whatever you like, there is value to expanding your social circle to include people in other geographical regions. I don't think advocating for people to remain in their homes and only socialize with the people in their own neighbourhoods is a good direction in which to lead society. As Mark Twain said, travel is fatal to prejudice. Broadband allows people to effectively travel the globe in seconds.
---
Furthermore, without the ability for climate scientists to instantly communicate and share data globally via broadband, we are truly fucked in trying to combat it. The solution to mitigating climate change is not to stop using broadband, but to transition to clean energy sources to power said broadband.
---
Holy fuck man dude use your brain

Me? Was that rhetorical?

I'm on the Ashkandi server.

We don't require any specific amount of talking or anything, but we've just found that it is easier to get to know one another over voice, where people can be busy in game but still hang out and chat if they want. It's harder to type when you're running a dungeon, etc. 
---
It's not a hard and fast rule, but we do try to encourage it in folks who've been in the guild a while but not yet joined. Our guild chat just isn't as active since we use Discord sub servers for chat, bank alt stuff, events, etc. 
---
We also have a lot of folks across age groups and are will to help some one get discord set up. We don't haze them into figuring it out on their own. I don't know. I'm hoping things work out. I enjoy our little group so far, but know we'll need more people for multiple dungeon runs or raids or if the MT/Healer pair wants a night off, etc.
---
Beast mastery is the leveling spec
---
They're goblin up my profits
---
As far as class balance I agree. Faction balance? BS. It isn't "ok" to be on a 80/20 server, for EITHER side.
---
Hmmmm. Idk what I did wrong. Perhaps I was stealth?
---
Unless you like downvotes I wouldn't even try that here. The neckbeards on this sub are a different breed
---
Have you soiled yourself? 
---
... Maybeh...
---
Depends on gear stat, for heal switching you shouldn't down rank and use 5 second rule. If you aren't heal switching the 5 second rule is barely used.
---
Mp5 is still better if you need mana regen though.
---
Yeah they dont like to be wrong
---
Grow up.
---
No reckbombs for you
---
\&gt;playing ret pala in the first place

He didn't cast frost bolt once that was his first screw up, then he left me in poly which gave me an opportunity to charge again
---
What server because I also have the Patten and make the same shirts
---
https://youtu.be/HME0qPX3mUg
---
yeah usually does, like some parts of ironforge where u wont aggro guards that's not considered exploiting
---
This is VC
---
You’re a piece of shit

I'd rather take these grainy crops than phone pictures of screens any day

and none of them lost a wink of sleep bc you're killing casuals 🤡🤡
---
ok have fun giving vis'kag to ur tank ya fuckin drooler. i think we are done here please dont respond anymore just downvote me and go on with your life as a moron
---
ahh the appeal to authority fallacy. so far your degrees look worthless because some rando on reddit just made it look like yo don't know what you're talking about
---
&gt;level 1
---
The people who actually ran it back in vanilla?
---
And at the end of the instance everybody gave you 100g and clapped.
---
That's a really good idea. I'm going to try that out.
---
Realistically there should be 3x more dps waiting in chat than healers. Thats normal because they fill 3x more spots.
---
I have found that it was pretty difficult finding pugs as a healer. Because most forming groups are looking for a tank. 
---
And even if you are in a group say 1 heals, 3 dps.
---
There are usually 1-3 other groups looking for a tank, and as a dps you can switch pugs as soon as another pug say "LFM 1 dps gtg" 
---
But your kinda stuck in your pug until a tank decides to grace your group.
---
At least this is my experience on my server.
---
Since ive repected to shadow priest i have found it much easier to pick up pugs, because i can quickly fill a dps role for a tank searching for groups.
---
So difficult to read for me. The colors. The colors make it rough.
---
Alchemy is for your alt, not your main.
---
It could be called Alt-emy.
---
41yd range
---
Anyone who thinks a leveling warrior shouldn't roll on a 2H axe is a complete idiot.
---
People above level 20 that know what they are talking about.. DM is diremaul deadmines is VC (VanCleef)
---
Just get remorseless attacks from assassination, up to improved backstab in combat, then up to improved ambush in Sub. And since neither of you have great CC going up and getting improved Sap would be good for big groups. Then from there you could just freestyle. I would grab prep from sub since youre almost there, and then make a run up combat for the 5% hit, dual wield spec, and blade flurry.
---
So bad that three only reason you okay then is for their memes.  Bubble-hearth.
---
I don't rp and don't want to ruin someone else experience.
---
Lul.. Go Guy is the best😂
---
Okay?
---
Sorry, you want us to sit at 60 doing nothing? No. 
---
If I'm online, I want to geind gear or progress my character. I'm almost full prebis ir equivalent, and starting to chip away at raiding gear. I'm not playing fast, i'm playing at my own pace. It is not rushing to be in prebis+some raid gear if you have 13+ days played on your character. 
---
There is no rush, just natural progression that results from a high time played, while focusing on character progression.
---
That goes for every individual in the raid, except maybe the tank if you only have one.  You're not going to finish the run because of the mage either.
---
That would require leveling an alt though.
---
Haha say you are a fury warrior then and still roll on tank gear cause no one else is going to need it
---
Same. Hope you were a cow and not a filthy nelf. Either way o7 fellow drood.
---
Dude. I smell a series over here.
---
what do i care? i can't get herpes TWICE
---
Yep
---
Druid. 
---
I topped the healing meters in MC four bosses in a row and everyone was whispering me compliments and questions and shit.
---
&gt;Then he ninjas a BoE Blue out of a chest he was unlocking, and rants at us about how it "isn't fair" that he has to give it up when he was the only one who could unlock it.
---
I'm with you on everything else, but this is actually something to be discussed at the beginning of the run. If you're not bringing the rogue solely to unlock boxes, they should be considered theirs because he's right: without the rogue that box is nothing. Personally I'm in favor of giving it to the rogue cuz I don't care that much, but there is merit to his argument on that part.
---
Took me longer than i care to admit to figure out what he meant by that.
---
You’re in the right on this one. You can use 2H axes, too, and Corpsemaker is awesome for its level. To stretch it a little further, I’m fine with warriors rolling on whatever they want. Tanking is a thankless gig, and while leveling they should be able to roll based on their preferred spec and their dungeon-specific spec. That changes when you approach 60, but it’s nothing that cannot be talked through at the beginning of a run.
---
BiS shirt, though.
---
It is fun!! I hope you get a chance to join us!
---
I wouldn't want any of these changes. The only thing I agree with here is that there *is* a faction problem that nobody seems to be addressing. My server is most likely either 80/20 or 85/15 ATM and yeah, I wish they didn't open up transfers. When census came out it was 70/30, but it honestly wasn't *that* bad. There were still people to group with, people to help once in a while, etc. 
---
After they allowed people to transfer for quick, a huge portion of the already dwindling alliance left. Now that I managed to get 60 it's at least do able, but everyone's already left because it absolutely sucked to level when you die that many times a night and get camped that frequently. Ended up starting a Horde on a balanced PvP server and it's much better group and PvP wise. Hoping they do a merge or something in the future on my main server so I didn't waste my time.
---
I don't care either way. I'm not into pvp so it doesn't really affect me. But if horde could have paladins and I knew for a fact that alliance would be outnumbering horde, I'd roll horde for the faction balance yeah. Not REROLL though, because with a game being 15 years old most people who aren't completely new already know that horde is the dominant faction. If you then roll horde anyway and then complain about faction imbalance you've got only yourself to blame.
---
Mimimimimi
---
Faerlina = VERY HIGH POPULATION
---
Horde 55/45 Alliance
---
Benediction = Med-High population
---
Horde 50/50 Alliance
---
ghost mushroom goes for about 1.5g each on my server so it's good money in the long run. and tomes go for 50g+ if you get the blues not counting the epic book that goes for about 700g+. dream foil can also spawn in some of those spawn points.
---
Either they are being sarcastic, or they are fucking insane. Who gives a shit how often a casual player logs in or not.
---
Lol, did your character die while distracted reading the advert?
---
lol nty better not run any instances than run with entitled idiot like you.
---
I'm genuinely SO excited for the classic version this year! I've been like a kid on Christmas to experience this route again!
---
I remember resing a dead tauren buddy in ratchet and the guards instantly crucified me. Literally died for someone else's sins

I learned riding and got my mount! Turns out it cost 90 gold and not 100 (rep discount I guess). Did you get yours?
---
Stamina, always. Your mana regen comes from spirit tap, which feeds off your stamina.
---
Chain fearing Gammon is a habit that has been missing from my life. Every time I visited, fear-fear-fear while I check mail, visit the AH or whatever. Then some fucker kills him in one shot. /y NOOOOO! /cry.
---
A couple of times, a low level rogue would ask in /1 where the hell Gammon was. I'd always go give them 10g or so for messing up their quest.
---
Switch. I just deleted a 60 Orc Hunter and rerolled a lvl 1 NE Hunter.
---
Same issue. I like NEs more.
---
If you're capped on hit and can put 5 percent crit into daggers and roll combat/daggers, have 1.4 speed on your off hand, you'll be throwing out a huge amount of crits on hit to make up for the much slower sword speed proc.
---
No but it seems like you are EXTREMELY butthurt over this lmao
---
Here's a tip - remember this is a social game.  Other people need the same quests you do, so put out a shout and see if anyone is forming a group.  I killed the STV sea giant way below recommended level because I shouted if anyone was going to it, and a group that already had 4 was about to start and invited me.  Be social, you'll get those red quests done so much easier.
---
There’s a huge difference in the social aspect between Classic and Retail. You can be alone in retail your entire journey and never see anyone you met in Dungeon finder. In Classic, u have to be social and group up to complete a lot of quests. And you might see those people later on in another dungeon, city or out in the world. Classic is everyone remembered it to be.
---
Amazing!
---
bad bot
---
Nice. Cool. Think I’ll be adding this. 
---
Thou I’ll keep pickpocket on its own too. Get some gold whilst tank builds threat.
---
Holy shit. This is insane!
---
For pointing out the subs rules?  Lol....
---
There's a checklist of things blizz suggests to do.  5 or so things for "connection issues." Involves allowing bliz to bypass your firewall, router stuff, ip configuration are a few.  Check those out?
---
Most just shift out to drink.
---
She didn't tell me anything about CO2 taxes!
---
I'm aware? It still has AP. That's why if no melee wants it I'm still gonna grab it to replace that fat 3% mount speed. Or wait, sorry this sub says I shouldn't even if nobody needs it, I forgot
---
Thank you that will actually help I’ll check it out on how to let blizz bypass the firewall
---
I know what can see stealth and what can't. I'm not talking about dogs I'm talking about this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7BDymBKj0
---
I wouldn't want to hurt some dicks' feelings. I agree with this retarded logic!
---
I started playing classic WoW for the first time last month.  Helps a lot having a friend to explain the basics but ,either way, you wont regret it. :) I have no life anymore lol
---
LoL!
---
Yes you’re clearly the asshole, good luck finding raids
---
Wasn’t a waste. You said it yourself that you enjoyed it.
---
What’s a waste is playing now when you’re not enjoying it. 
---
*transforms into single mother Instagram model* 
---
It’s all about the journey. Not the destination.
---
So you believe that no matter how idiotic the rules are, they can never be changed?
---
t. Every generic internet troll.
---
But they’re talking about him now. His brand is known cross server now.
---
Hunter = Pet
---
Go spend 50 hours in BRD and you'll have issues just like everyone else.
---
Yes. I gouge, then let him punch me for a while as I run my errands. It's always ruined by an L60 who thinks he's helping me out, but he's not
---
And without the group the rogue wouldn't have had the chance to open the chest. Just roll for it.
---
Warlock - I'm not very social, and my availability is limited from work, and my family, so I love how I can pretty much just be on my own.  Solo group quests, not super gear dependent, and I love playing the only class that could be considered evil.
---
For whining like a little bitch
---
tooltip dps doesn't really mean much that's just how much your autoshots do
---
RP servers are a lot more relaxed than you'd think on that front. You can go years without RPing once, and as long as you don't go out of your way to ruin others time by emote-spamming in their face, or throwing engineer bombs where they are chatting, no one will really be bothered. 
---
You don't have to RP to be part of an RP server, as long as you behave like a decent human being to those who are RPing.
---
I have that but Shift + Scroll
---
It's blizzlike because energy is in decimals. If you for instance dodge an attack it'll be a decimal, there's at some point you bound to "get" more or less. It's like this because it works as it should where it doesn't round numbers up or down.
---
You were paid 20g to not roll and then you asked why you didn't get to roll on it? /confused
---
True, but you only need to be level 35 to become an artisan alchemist. And you could be funneling herbs from your main.
---
Then you get the best of both worlds.
---
Sulfuras, high population, no queues, one of the best balanced servers
---
Hey!  
---
What server did you end rolling on?  
---
IM still making shirts in classic, on whitemane
---
It's pretty insane how useful ranged weapons can be on mdps. I can't recall how many times I've finished off rdps with my bow.
---
Running around with my troll mask as a human warlock trying to buy weed on an RP server.... i have only been /rude twice.  One guy even sold me some bruise weed.
---
West fall chicken pet 
---
Defias Mask
---
The afkers are annoying as fuck. Ive had that happen so many friggin times.
---
He was born with pre bis on
---
I use usually arcane shot and multishot as possible as well. Pet is wolf/boar.
---
I'm a rogue and fuck that because it cuts both ways.  Sure they can't open it without me, but I can't get to most locked chests without a group.
---
MOTW spec can do that
---
I quit during cata and returned for classic. I booted up retail the other day and enjoyed dungeon finder and I see myself casually playing retail while doing classic on my main.
---
You do realize that rule is beyond fucked right?
---
same, i literally only get 20/21 energy ticks, never 19... guess im finally lucky
---
its been a few weeks, it mighta been 22 and i was mixing it up w/ a different one
---
I just pass on locked chests

Vanilla: Warriors hating on Paladins for rolling on Valor

Classic: Warriors hating on Warriors for rolling on Valor
---
Herb Alch has been awesome on my mage. 5-10g per day with Fire -&gt; Earth xmute or 5-15g every 2 days from arcanite bar, depending on AH prices. Stacks of mountain silversage are fetching 10-13g and other herbs are worth a lot too. Frankly I don’t even use many of my own potions outside of raiding but they’re there when I need them, and it’s a steady gold maker.
---
I got bad news, pugs get kicked for guildies all the time.  
---
It's one of the main benefits of being in a guild.
---
Reality and real world aren't the same thing though
---
You can do this but the thing is. You don't group. If you have two accounts. What you do is take your level 60 and just put follow on the char you're leveling. No group. You can pull mobs and just not worry about anything. When you are getting low just tab over and heal your other char. (Or kill the mobs depends on what class the 60 is) as long as you're not group I'm very certain you suffer no penalty.
---
Are there any items I should stock up on before phase 2 releases?
---
Sadly it's working "as intended".
---
But they need to fix mobs parrying from behind. This isn't a fuckin' anime.
---
This isn't true at all, by that level he should have blind, meaning he could have just killed the group guarding the chest and opened it, waiting for cool downs between. If my group is being chill, I'll open the chests that are locked and let people roll, but if they're assholes I'll just tell them my lockpicking isn't high enough.
---
Swap the order you equip the slots I think is how you fix it.  Equip the slot the shield uses first.
---
that's vanish, and it's working as intended. Stealth definitely does not do that, as I've been frostbolted/shadowbolted/mind blasted out of stealth dozens of times after trying to Stealth mid cast to avoid them
---
you should never use arcane shot unless you are forced to move, it doesn't scale with ap, hit chance or crit
---
I chuckled
---
Rogues should get bound chests.
---
If there are two rogues they should both duel outside the instance,  naked, and using skinning knives.
---
except when there are 2 people from another guild in your group and you are the only person from yours in the group, even if you are a leader you are the pug lmao
---
Yeah, because we are here to talk about our favourite video game, and noone would be so stupid to try to push any political agenda
---
I’m am on the side of it being an open roll, but that’s just me.
---
Valor is de bestz for warrioroz.
---
Why the bollocks would anyone do this when you can 3-4 man stealth tribute runs for your bis?  Talk about a waste of time.
---
Take out the /equipslot and just /equip itemname
---
First and foremost , Dire Maul is DM period no discussion.
---
Second congrats and good luck on your grand adventure.
---
Considering that fury warriors need high crit to proc flurry and keep it up at all times and agi gives them 1% crit for every 20 agi fury stat priority is agi&gt;=str&gt;stam
---
I think things will work out for you.  Maybe find your server's reddit/forums or advertise on the guild posts that show up here.  I don't know your advertisement methods but maybe treat it as a small business in terms of marketing for a couple of months.
---
I asked your server in hopes that your guild was on my own so I could join =). Unfortunately, you are not.  Which sucks.
---
Again, you sound perfect.
---
Or just a mob as they're running away. Rather than Chase to kill just pull out the gun, drop him, and tab on to the next mob.
---
Unless it's 100% asked for up front, I assume every dungeon that any kind of profession gathering nodes are 100% first come first serve.  I don't bitch when people don't share with me, and I'd tell them to fuck off if they bitched at me for not sharing, unless it was specifically asked for in the beginning. This is a retarded thing to whine about.  I also don't share mining nodes in the open world, if someone else is standing close to it.
---
Is there way to make macro so it dont cast wing clip if it is applied? So its not RS / WC / RS / WC (unnececery use of mana using WC )  Or coz of RS cooldown dont cast multiple WC when spamming the macro? So its instead RS / WC / RS / RS  ?
---
Yeah I just rerolled on a new server but making another alt does seem necessary at some point.
---
You're a little slow huh Xd
---
AH, THAT’S JUST A DICK MOVE OF HIM THEN. IF HE WAS ABLE TO SPOT THAT IT WAS A BOE, HE DEFINITELY SHOULD’VE BEEN CAPABLE OF READING CHAT
---
On a website!
---
/cry
---
/wave
---
Better off with equal levels. There is a significant XP drop off to prevent boosting like that.
---
Lotta projection here. Not sure why a second healer was ever brought up still but I did read his post correctly thank you. Sorry if you’re struggling to find groups I never struggled to as a healer. See dps searching all day long. Super hot take I know, there’s more dps looking for groups than anything else.
---
I went for the mana regain talent in the arcane tree so I can have 45% of my mana regain while casting.
---
Got a warlock with engi and tailor max. Robe of the void is up. But I can’t drop tailoring I need my mooncloth bags. I also do mara runs a lot. Help me!
---
And the rogue wouldn't ever have gotten the chest's content without the help of his group.
---
get good m8 why u teabagging his ankles?  u have to position urself over their face first
---
Could you of made it to said chest without the help of the group?
---
I see what u are saying thanks
---
I'm sorry I upset you.  Bye friend
---
I think if you fee that way you can pass on it. Personally I always pass on chests because I don’t really care and a lot of people do. Plus I’ve won chests before and had people bitch at me endlessly until I gave them loot that they wanted but I won. I just avoid the chest drama now.
---
As someone who doesn’t really game, I am addicted so be careful.
---
I’m on windseeker and it’s pretty solid.
---
Not this again
---
And that’s no problem, but I’m curious as to why you feel that way?
---
I never blame the healer for anything. As a tank, the healer is your best friend and should be number one priority when it comes to protect.
---
...It’s not pre BIS.”
---
"It's not BIS, that makes it pre-BIS. STFU."
---
What’s better to use while raising/duengon at 60 for a rogue while waiting for your dal rends to drop? Skullforge reaver or thrash blade?
---
Oh interesting! Thank you!
---
You may remember my highly voted gifs, people wanted voice actors so I gave it to you!
---
it's rolled between the group, literally costs the rogue nothing to open and it's not like they were able to get to the chest alone
---
Nice private server
---
Could you have made it to said herb or ore without the group? If not, should the herblist or miner not have to give it to the winning roller?
---
Tbf I usually just pussy out and vanish.
---
Sadly none of my friends play WoW i might get someone to start with me though
---
Troll shaman shirt
---
DM - Deadmine. 
---
DM:N / DM:W /DM:E - for dire maul
---
Is it really that hard to wrap your head around it ?
---
The server imbalances should kind of sort themselves out. It won't be uncommon for players to open accounts to switch sides because world PvP is dry. HC Pvpers just want to Pvp. Most really don't care for who.
---
I'm talking about 60.
---
Looks like it.
---
You potted during a duel...
---
Yes we all are. Accept it!
---
thrash blade / mirah's song!
---
Just hope they don’t kick you after the run is over just to make sure(if you can’t make it back in time to unlock).
---
BiS has become a meme for me. I just use it anywhere I would normally say best. Even sarcastically.
---
yeah. there's a guild bank right between the AH and mailbox
---
/r/unexpectedfuturama
---
He means he’s never played paladin before, or has only played it poorly and it gave him a bad impression of the class.
---
It costs them time and effort like leveling up any other profession. If you were an herblist unable to get to that gromsblood in dme alone, should you be expected to roll it off and give it to the highest roller?
---
he means in ur party i believe
---
Is it water closet? I always thought it was wash closet
---
Definitely not on Reddit.
---
Ew. One of these.
---
They are standing in front of VC, yes.
---
/s please I don't want to do this actually
---
Time is money, friend!
---
The best advice anyone can give you is to get an addon that tells you your experience per hour and then experiment with that. There are so many game based and individual play-style variables to take into account , so your best bet is to play around and figure it out for yourself.
---
The chests can still contain items that are relevant to the rest of the party. Like weapons and armor but usually whoever wins the roll in my experience, if they don’t need the items would give them to someone that actually does. It really depends on the group. I’ve been in groups where people needed on everything just because they can. But I believe they can contain boes which I think everyone should have to roll for.
---
The problem is that there was no actually moderation for behavior on pservers. It was the wild west for shit like safe spotting, cross faction cooperation, and account sharing. The attitude of "win by any means necessary, and fuck everybody else" ran rampant on pservers.
---
Classic is a lot better.
---
Also, pservers had a selection bias already for fucking assholes. So the whole culture culminated in a fuck-storm of shit-birds.
---
So you accepted 20g to not roll, and then you rolled?
---
Sounds like your an asshole
---
The suffix items do have a random range.
---
Spell Hit gear is basically the only gear in the entire game that I don't think Paladins have any business rolling in ever.
---
I feel that since it is a class skill you should be willing to use it (if leveled).  To me it’s equivalent to a warlock not giving out health stones or a mage not giving out water.
---
60 druid here. I have about 20ish macros.
---
Most of them are just (psuedo macro language here):
---
Showtooltip ability 
---
/dismount 
---
If not in correct form, cancel form
---
If not in correct form, enter form
---
start autoattack
---
/cast ability
---
Super simple stuff.
---
Doesn’t matter. You aren’t entitled it even if it’s 1%.
---
Rogues are not the only ones who can open chest. Also, without the group, that rogue is not getting anything. That is why it is etiquette to let the group roll on it.
---
thats just the wrong attitude to have then. if you see someone else in the instance with the same profession, you share.
---
WARRIORS AND MAGES ARE NATURAL BORN ENEMIES LIKE WARRIORS AND ROGUES,
---
OR WARRIORS AND HUNTERS
---
OR WARRIORS AND WARLOCKS,
---
OR WARRIORS AND OTHER WARRIORS!
---
DAMN WARRIORS THEY RUINED AZEROTH!
---
I'm proud to be on the same server! Good job!
---
I have bad news for you: If you act like an asshole in Classic, you'll find yourself unable to form groups with anyone except other outcast assholes.
---
It's one of the main benefits of playing Classic.
---
&gt;There are a lot of wannabe tryhards who think BiS items are the only items that matter. They're too dumb to see otherwise and are really insucure as a result. They look for any opportunity to bully someone over dumb shit. If it's an upgrade, go for it. Valor is literally a warrior set.
---
The same guys that comment on "This item is also BIS for warriors" to a comment made in 2006, lol.
---
I always vanish things when I’m sure nothing is going to do damage in the next like .2 seconds and I’ve never had it not work, however I am not up to brd yet (almost).
---
That pot costs less than a gold
---
Yep, already done, so we'll see. :) Thank you, though!
---
If you ever feel like switching, let me know. :) Ashkandi seems like a fairly casual server in general
---
Lol why is this on reddit?
---
Lol, fuck no. To each their own. If that's how you want to play, go for it. But don't assume everyone is "wrong" because they don't play the same way you do.
---
Good example! However, the problem with that is, a mage and warlock turns it at a trainer. There is no leveling it up. We didn’t spend hours in our in the world looking for footlockers to level it. Rogues did.
---
It's great for leading mobs to your traps
---
come back to me when herb nodes can drop epics
---
This is the correct answer.
---
Your 9% Hit BiS lists are wrong.
---
I've never seen a rogue not offer it up for roll
---
Joke's on them, I only make my own groups.
---
I thought it said drugs and read the whole story and was confused.
---
u/LiterallyABlackBear
---
Shamans are good healers offspec... for about 10 seconds til the mana runs out.
---
Is there new information somewhere or did you mean to just link back to the conversation? 
---
Because I would be interested in new info.
---
I think I need some new macros.  
---
A scattorshot/petpassive/cheetah button, also a petpassive/fd/frost trap button.
---
Do you have any screenshots?
---
IMO, rogues should get bound chests, and I pass on them.
---
Already had this argument here a few times before.
---
Even though it is a class skill, I consider Lockpicking to be more akin to a profession, as it must be leveled with resources outside of your base toolkit.
---
Many disagree outright, and draw comparisons to warriors leveling all of their weapon skills, which I think is comically disingenuous, but whatever. People aren't going to change their minds.
---
Cat for single target, bear for multi target. Use mana exclusively for healing. 
---
You gonna solo quest all the way to 60? Level as feral with all talents focused on cat dps.
---
You're gonna tank dungeons all the way to 60? Level as feral with all talents focused on cat dps.
---
You're gonna heal dungeons all the way to 60? Say it with me damnit. Level as feral with all talents focused on cat dps.
---
Research HotW/NS and use it.
---
its highly desirable because its great at murdering priests/mages/warlocks or just casters/healers in general. Its THE BEST PvP pet you can get.
---
He also should have backed off much farther after the nova and frost bolted.  You closed that distance so fast
---
See now that there is an extremely valid point. Monetary gain.
---
I bought that crossbow a few levels ago for \~10g on the AH and can't wait to use it man. That 3.1 speed is just too sweet to pass up for those aimed/multi shots. Stats/proc are great too. Not looking forward as much to spamming serpent sting rank 1 to level up crossbows from zero once I ding later today though haha
---
Video of this?
---
I've seen one person solo tribute run in classic and it took him way longer than 20 minutes.
---
I definitely do
---
Didn't even matter. He rekt that mage
---
Am I doing something wrong trying to find a RFD group? I need a coldbringer kill to get my vanquishers sword. I have been spamming LFG and barrens general for an hour and even offering to pay a higher level to run me through it once but no luck.
---
hoof*
---
I think it’s for the rogue. Do you roll mine veins ? Herbs , and skinning ? I know I don’t, so why is it different
---
Most do. I have seen 2 so far on classic that were not open to a roll though.
---
I think the difference is that it's really not the same as a gathering profession, not everyone can train lockpicking profession if they want, just rogue. So that makes it more of a class skill, and the point of dungeon groups is that you are all agreeing to use your specific class skills to the benefit of the group. The mage doesn't refuse to give party members foods and water just because they are the only one that can summon it, so why should the rogue refuse to share loot just because they're the only one that can open a chest?
---
About the experience in late game pally healing. If not speced . We oom with little heals not making a difference. Good gear can mitigate this. But still not very optimal.
---
We let the rogue open and keep it unless it's a blue or higher BOE. If a blue or higher item from chest drops we then roll on that item only. Green or lower he/she keeps.
---
But healthstones and water don't take fairly sizeable amounts of time to level. You just purchase them.
---
In the level 15 stress tests I wanded him, sheeped him, wanded him, ..., all the way onto the blimp platform. I was trying to take him to undercity. He won't follow you onto the blimp.
---
6%
---
In that case you should probably google world of Warcraft before you watch the video and do some light reading. When you're up for it maybe even install and try it out first!
---
A lot of legit victim blaming here, almost entirely. Sucks man, hope this helps get the word out.
---
A tutorial wouldn't do me any good. I can't draw stick people well.
---
You are Horde, aren't you?
---
Dont forget the fact that it isnt exactly easy for rogues to even find dungeon groups
---
Oh my, godson ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
He can get the loot and give the green if someone needs it.
---
SMASHING!
---
Healing seems so much easier to me now. I have a 31 disc priest and a 28 enhancement shaman and the challenge is paying attention to the tank's health from time to time while I wand or melee. I just forget that I'm healing.
---
Groomed by her ex actor and global warming activist parents. Yeah her thoughts and ideas are 100% organic
---
hey all. all of a sudden, when i press enter to open chat and press the up key, it wont cycle through my previous messages i sent. i did install the newest version of elvui but i dont see why that would change it. any help? thanks!
---
Barny and Snackybox are the best classic content creators rn
---
Haha I'm on flamelash eu mate :)
---
I quit retail a few months after Legion came out and have no intention of touching BfA.
---
Enjoying the hell out of classic and intend on sticking with it. I’d probably quit if it progressed to WoTLK or Cata though.
---
should have just went resto then. their group their rules
---
Can confirm will avoid
---
You'll find out that there are a lot of nice people playing and almost everytime there will be players  wanting to group. Its a very sociable game
---
If true that’s very interesting as I was planning on solo farming him for bracers on my Mage.
---
Never ever EVER heard anyone calling it something so bad as VC, must be NA server thing
---
Although that’s a fair example, I think there’s something missing here and that’s that like every other spell, conjouring food and water is a learned skill, where as rogues have to spend hours out in the world looking for chests, doors and footlockers to skill up this profession or ‘class ability,’ just like a miner has to spend the time and effort seeking out oar, or an herblist looking for flowers. It takes time and effort to do so.
---
I remember the first character I made right when WoW launched.  I was running around killing mobs and slowly collecting copper.   I could see that "Silver" and "Gold" were currency options, but I hadn't gotten any yet.
---
[Gold Bar] drops from a treasure chest, and I lost my shit.  I thought I was rich.  =(
---
Well yeah, its not hard to walk 3 feet, lol.
---
That will be a nice change most online game i play have toxic players xD
---
How did he do that?
---
These videos are so simple and so damn funny.  Keep em coming! :-)
---
Hemo + mace specialization (0/26/25) is hilarious in pvp. It doesn't have as much on demand burst obviously, but all the combat talents make your autoattacks scary strong along with the unlimited stuns. Cheap shot, kidney shot, and mace stun are all on separate DR tables for anyone that didn't know that.
---
Shouldn't have backed up at all. He should have turned around or strafed away. Too slow.
---
jeez oh man are you the priest in the video? why so upset?
---
holy shit that was worth watching to the end LOL
---
I managed to level to 60 and heal as feral specced just fine and everyone believed me when I said I could heal well. 
---
I dinged 60 last week and thought I was slower than most during leveling. If you're not 60 yet, you're at the same level as a lot of people who play casually. Much more likely that these dudes are going to be uninformed or bad. Shake it off my dude.
---
Giving up a few $ a month of luxury inst suffering..
---
I suggest using /equip [noshield] for your tank set and simply /equip for your non tank set.
---
The other one is just a useful idiot being propped up by the burning legion to enslave all of Azeroth.
---
Do you have any clue how fucking long it takes to skill up LP? 
---
Rogues deserve the vendor trash from boxes for their effort. Obviously if anything drops that someone needs he can have it.
---
I abandoned my 57 alliance character there cause I got ganked non stop in all high level zones. Horde is extremely aggressive and more organized and Alliance seemed too not caring to fight back in numbers. Your milage may vary though
---
Yikes, you dont play classic - do you?
---
Again battleshout aggro was removed in classic due to exploitation
---
Also made a new friend today.
---
Actually if Taurens are based of bulls, they reach sexual maturity by the age of 2 I believe
---
Shadow priest talent question. Does the % chance to stun from blackout proc on every tick of SW:P, or just the initial cast?
---
I’m confused.
---
Did you roll after taking the money not to roll?
---
Everyone is too busy spamming SM cath to bother right RFD even though it’s a pretty well thought out instance.
---
Just keep on trying is all I can say.
---
Also are you just posting LFG? If so, then you need to be the change you see in the world.
---
Find a tank and healer by using /who and then look for individual members on LFG.
---
Yeah but that’d be like counting the time spent in the womb towards your age.
---
bath water
---
Nah, DM N, DM E Etc are the names, not that VC crap
---
Or... you know people who realise a lvl 15-25 player is not talking about Dire Maul and a lvl 60 is probably talking about dire maul. Not to mention MOST of the times it is accompanied with a T, N, E or W... I never heard VC on any of the EU servers I played on.
---
Better to level from 1 to 255 than 1 to 300! It actually happens faster than. You would think though. I had a lot of success by getting like 80% of the way there solo and then running an instance the rest of the way where missing isn't as annoying as it is when you're soloing
---
Seems to me the most obvious solution is give rogues advantage on chest rolls. Imo etiquette since vanilla should’ve always been this. Person/Rogue who unlocks the chest gets to roll twice and use higher roll.
---
Cheers! East US for me, so I'll keep enjoying your vids from over here. Brilliant work!
---
I think the rogue should open it, and if there’s anything of value that the group could benefit from those items should be rolled on. Everything else is the rogues to keep. 
---
I’m curious what people think about using skeleton keys to open locked chests.
---
Warlock: nightfall procs are Just too damn good
---
This alt doesnt leave the city
---
Block me too please
---
Don’t care about that port. But the walking vending machine is always nice. Water isn’t cheap.
---
Imo anyone who thinks the rogue should get the chest is an idiot and it's the most entitled and spoiled way of thinking.. Just because the rogue can open it, why should he get it when he would never be able to open it, if it wasnt for the help of the rest of the group?
---
Locks can port you, mages makes you water, the healer heals you and so on, its a group effort, classes brings different things and you use those to help the group.
---
When I played vanilla SGC was a legend. There was a wide rumor that it had been removed from the drop tables or was pointlessly rare, like Ironfoe. There was certainly never an expectation that every warrior would farm it like the Baron mount.
---
It’s VC
---
Oh my god that's amazing.  
---
I'm Blaumeux Alliance now, but it's great to see you haha.
---
Right, am I missing something? OP makes a post saying he played wow today, followed by three people congratulating them.
---
Rotation isn't standard and completely depends on the timing of your weapon.
---
You never want to clip auto shots
---
While it does take an investment, its a [free] skill you can choose to not level or just say you can’t open it.  It’s up to the person unlocking the chest ultimately, but to anyone I know it has always been a /roll if the rogue can open.
---
i dont see how that entitles a rogue to free loot? espicially to green/gold.
---
Good question I've been looking for answers too
---
Okay, I think I'm gonna go with this build since it sounds like a lot of fun with my friend tanking:  [https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/wow-classic-combat-daggers-rogue-leveling-talent-build-1-60](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/wow-classic-combat-daggers-rogue-leveling-talent-build-1-60)   
---
Anyone recommend any druid builds? Something capable of tanking 5 mans while still doing decent damage in cat form for pvp
---
I’d avoid surefooted and use items with plus hit.  It is not worth dipping out of the beast tree for raiding.  Although, atm running survival will allow you to farm gold from tribute runs solo more effectively with the feign death 4% less resist trait for the multiple feign deaths required and the trap duration for the beetle paths.
---
No problem - thank you for creating content for the rest of us :) If you keep posting I'll certainly try to give you .ore feedback as and when I see it, I critique a lot of writing through work (though not for comics) so hopefully it'll be useful to you.
---
Keep it up!
---
Hmm still too old for me
---
6% with 305, 9% with 300.
---
This is only for YELLOW hit cap, this means abilities and heroic strike(since it's a yellow). Auto attacks has the same hit chance with 2handed, but with duelwield an additional 19% miss chance is added.
---
See above advice
---
I'm suffering from a lot of misses so right now it's still shield time! One day, one day I will out shine all the dps!
---
This guy has never lived 10+ miles to the closest other human being...
---
If there are other melee dps we cannot walk away from a rooted mob. It will just kill the rogue.
---
Glad to (hopefully) help.  When I first started classic everything would be fine until I started grouping with other people, whether outside or inside dungeons (continuous 2k-4k latency).  Might've been because I'm playing out of the time zone my server is in, but I took every step listed by blizz and connected by ethernet and only run into issues every now and then.
---
I understood it as: he took 20 gold to not roll, then didn't roll because he couldn't.  Like say he had it on already and it was unique, so it wouldn't let him roll?
---
Also it is important to not have the three pets you want until you learn all the skills from higher level mobs!  Otherwise you have to ditch one!
---
Vultures are the best tanking pets.
---
Screech has aoe threat gen.
---
They can learn two focus dumps for damage.
---
They take no negative armor / health modifier.
---
I disagree with the “nobody can help you” answers. While it may be difficult to determine the max profit you could make, you can use prices of other, similar goods as a base point. How much are other rare bags selling for? What’s the most comparable item? As a rule of thumb, I always start with an outrageous price for something that nothing really compares to. You might lose a little deposit but over time you can dial in the right price. Never sell for what you think is “too low” unless you really, really need the gold immediately. The worst you can do is sell for a low price now and find out you got screwed. It’s pretty rare to come across items worth 10+G each. If it’s that rare, then don’t settle for anything less than what you want. Just make sure to keep it on the AH and check if anyone else has listed the same item every day.
---
Damn, that's a bad guild name :/
---
Happened to me last week, I reloaded the UI and voila it was in my bag :)
---
I would suggest using Item rack and (alt left clicking?) ur gear to make shortcuts
---
I leveled an Alliance  rogue on Herod and I swear to god, Orc Warriors were ALWAYS the ones to start shit. UD actually didn't seem to bother me as much. But if I saw an Orc Warrior trodding along on his stupid ugly wolf mount, I knew my ass was about to get charged.
---
I've played both factions for 15 years lol. Alliance usually pvps in groups, waits for you to be low health to 1v1, camps quest mobs etc.
---
As someone who has never played a rogue, my sentiments exactly.
---
&gt;   None of them ever complain.  We rez and move on.
---
Good DPS =)
---
Also it feels like when scatter is effecting a mob you have to wait in feign death until scatter is about done to be out of combat.
---
Also to journey on foot you often have to set up camp for distances, burn wood releasing Co2.
---
Very true.  But lock picking is like leveling a gathering or crafting profession, if you want the skill level it, if you don’t want to then don’t.  At 300 it’s a profitable skill to have opening lock boxes for people so why not open a chest here or there?
---
Truefaith is bis until p5 iirc, so definitely worth it. But you're only 58 and can prioritise getting everything else first. I did this out of neccesity since I'm also poor AF. You do get a lot of gold from dungeon grinding, especially if you do the quests also.
---
This is an ongoing thing. I’m not 60, but 40. I did a RFD as DPS and the rest was a guild run, with a warrior tank. Of course the chest drops from the first boss, myself and the tank needroll on it since both of us have a mailchest from pre 40. Turns out I win it and suddenly the healer is all over me, saying that I’m stupid that needs it, it’s not a dps chest and so on. Tried to explain what I had and that the chest is a major upgrade. Turns out he and the rest of the group had me on ignore. 
---
Now, they let me continue in the group and we finished it smoothly. However, I feel that some people go nuts when they miss out a loot piece. Usually I tell them to chill out and that we can do it again, but most of the times it’s to late since the message “xxxx is ignoring you”
---
If you use this macro it will change the groundclutter for 5 seconds making it super easy to find your herb and it will change back to pretty automatically :)
---
/run SetCVar("groundEffectDensity", 16);
---
/run C\_Timer.After(5,function(self) SetCVar("groundEffectDensity", 256) end);
---
But blizzard might reduce the server cap when they remove layering to avoid overcrowding.
---
Can I have more info on your charity like how much of the proceeds go to those in need vs the charity organizers overhead etc?
---
I have seen both
---
That's the funny part, Valor chest is not "pre-BIS" for literally anyone. This guy was just bitching about not sharding loot that someone could use, fuck him.
---
Locks learn summons, mages learn to make water, healers learn to heal. Rogues have to spend hours out in the world looking for doors and footlockers to skill up on. This is not an ability they can go to the trainer and learn the next rank of ever few levels. 
---
You’re not expected to roll for herbs or ore. Why? Because it’s a profession, well lockpick, although a class ability, has to be skilled up like a profession. A rogue has to spend time and effort doing so, just like the herbalist and just like the miner. 
---
The rogue may not have been able to get to it without help of the group but the herbalist never would have been able to pick that gromsblood in dme without the group killing that death lasher, so why not roll for the gromsblood?
---
I can't find anyting named nicker on wowhead
---
It's called stance switching. Get good.
---
Complete newb question. Do melee hits add to your combo points? I’m a rogue if that makes a difference. Just wondering if it’s only Sinister Strike and Gouge that are giving me my combo points or if melee is a factor as well. Thanks :)
---
Its a shame it was removed from retail, best part of playing rogues and warriors is the use of ranged weapons. And they can hit really hard!
---
Yes it does.  Check out this calculator to play with and plan how to spend your pet training points! https://www.bobo-talents.com/pets/
---
Being a dps means you don’t just have the option to leave the group when it’s bad IMO.. first of all if you’re not a mage you have to basically submit a resume to get an invite . Second when you do get invited it takes about 10-20 minutes to even get the group ready for the dungeon. It’s a huge time investment especially when leveling and only having a certain amount of time to play .
---
Saying this, you clearly haven't played alliance.
---
It’s a unique item and if you have it already you won’t see a group loot box for it when it’s being rolled on. That’s the only way you wouldn’t have seen it or been able to roll.
---
Bad mannered.
---
Travel form
---
Can Ravagers WW proc Fiery Enchant?
---
Yeah, only brainwashed people would ever possibly think the world becoming too hot for humans to inhabit would be a bad thing.
---
Ok few things. 
---
Mage was terrible.
---
Frost nova you BACKPADDLE few steps and cast spells. god damn bro get some range on warrior..
---
You use health pot in duel. IDK if u know about this but one of unwritten rules  in duels is that you dont use pots in them. 
---
Either way good job on getting gold.
---
My veiw as a mage while in a party. Should i charge for my water?  No, should you charge for a unlock? No. Its a class feature to be shared with the party. Idc either way but the cheat should be rolled on otherwise i should charge you to nake food if you need it.
---
So tell me this, layers have a maximum number of players they can fit, which Blizzard can dynamically change, right?
---
It’s called VC stop projecting your own mistakes on others
---
I make them on my main and pass them down to my alt :)
---
Right back at ya, I consider the idea that you have any claim to loot in chest that may as well not have existed if the rogue weren't there is entitled thinking.
---
Briarwood is common enough that you should go for it. All you do is fish for it and then you have a 20% chance. Hoj runs r popular enough where going for it is not hard. I agree but those are bad examples
---
From the calculations I've used, I got +2 weapon skill turns into 0.8% hit and +4 is 1.2%, where do you get your number from? Just curious because I keep seeing conflicting information all over.
---
Why thrash? Just wondering
---
lol, the reason? u ever play warrior before? give me good reason to switch stance as fury as I present very strong facts above
---
This is about to blow your mind.
---
Look the direction you want with the camera while moving.
---
Right click and slightly move your mouse up or down (or at all really).
---
Bam!  Instant turning.  
---
The "camera pan" is if you turn on autorun and hold down right click and make a nice little turny motion with your mouse.  It is completely reasonable to anyone make instant turns.  All you have to do is know how.
---
Also, if some dbag kept calling me a bot while I was trying to get my farm on, I'd probably ignore him - that's only partly true - I'd mock the shit out of you in public first.  But that's just me.
---
You can also eyes of beast and pull mobs out of the ship manually to kill them one by one.  Very helpful in tight hallways to get the right positioning while soloing!
---
Lol since when are there duel rules? Anything goes
---
The mage isn't OP. 😒
---
I leveled as shadow until 59. 
---
Did MANY BRD runs only healing as shadow. It’s just fine.
---
Exactly my thought. OP, want a cookie?
---
I  guess rule #3 just doesn't exist when we want it to :)
---
You didn't have a healer?
---
Intercept. +3% chance to crit. Whirlwind is an instant attack.
---
yeah you should use all three stances more or less regardless of stance. for any role.
---
Phase two hasn't dropped yet
---
I would never join a guild that uses a loot council. It is almost always just a way for the officers (who are most likely friends) to gear themselves before anyone else.
---
As a rogue, I never even considered holding a locked chest "hostage." Never saw a rogue do it before, didn't know it was a thing. Sounds like some new age metagamey shit, something that someone like Asmon would ironically encourage people to do for lulz. 
---
Although while I was leveling my lockpicking was garbage so I couldn't usually open them anyways.
---
Don’t worry I’ll be downvoted by all the other people that make “look at me” posts on here.
---
I don't know, I don't watch streamers.  Have you tried going to curse or somewhere and typing in the word "trinket"?
---
So you expect miners and herbalists to give away their herbs and ore too?
---
Looks you have a point, but take off the blinders. Her activism is no coincidence nor act of her own volition. She has been heavily influenced and even funded from outside groups. She even has mental disabilities that attribute to her zealousness on a subject she focuses on. Let’s not kid ourselves here. I’m not dismissing the problem but using a mentally disabled teenager as a prop is sick.
---
Lockpicking is incredibly easy to level up, it is not comparable to any other profession
---
 - There is no competition except from other rogues (which is virtually none since no one farms locked boxes in the environment) 
---
 - The rogue trainer will straight up tell you exactly where to go level it up 
---
 - Costs nothing 
---
It's up to the rogue, but you should let the group roll. If the rogue doesn't want to share and the group isn't ok giving it to him then just skip it. No one gets it, problem solved. 
---
Every class has their perks and its up to them to use them selfishly or to aid a group. locks have to spend shards to summon, warriors have high repair costs, shamans and paladins have costly reagents for self rez and DI, etc etc... 
---
If a rogue wants to go around demanding locked chests go to him or charging money or whatever then so be it. But I'm willing to be you'd get more out of it in the long run by working with your groups and just rolling for a 1/5 chance
---
Sorry, the last release with dire maul
---
I am literally having that exact same problem. There has to be a way it works, though, because the file here is a file people link to me repeatedly.
---
Deviate delight
---
I guess so, but again it's not as if there is nothing involved in getting a spell, obviously it's more of a basic mechanic of the game but it still requires time leveling and money spent at the trainer. Honestly I can see valid points on both sides, which is why I think it's such a devicive topic that nobody can agree on, kind of like the need vs. greed debate on high value BoE items.
---
I'm not a rogue, but I guess at the end of the day I just wish people would generally have more of a group mentality when running dungeons. A rogue refusing to roll on a locked chest, whether he deserves it or not, always leaves a bad taste in the mouths of the other group members and probably isn't worth the bad karma.
---
You're part of the problem. Come from retail, did we?
---
Melee hits do not add combo points. Only moves that specifically say they add points do.
---
Blizzard "might" do anything but they haven't done that nor said they're going to do that.  They specifically didn't increase the server cap when there were many layers because they knew when the layers were removed it would create an unsustainable scenario and theyve literally said that in a blue post.  This sub is nutty it's like being in an alternative universe where facts and reality don't matter.
---
All three stances have their uses. Unless you're bad.
---
Not only that but ranged weapons became pure stat sticks in... I'd like to say Wrath? Except rogue had that nice-ass Deadly Throw ability.
---
People who are saying paladins shouldn’t take it are wrong. They might want to defer to a dps caster but if it’s an upgrade they should use it til they find something better
---
3% extra crit chance no good for you?
---
I mean, when you try to find a group, I think it's easier for you (as a shadow priest) to go as a healer and not as a dps
---
Fwiw, after 2 weeks of farming baron for the 1h sword, cause it looks awesome and is decent, I got the sword off ony.  So what happens literally the next day when I'm doing ud strat to help friends... The sword drops, yeah its my oh now for everything but raiding, I have pbis in every slot that doesn't have raid gear, still don't care, it looks cool despite being a terrible oh.  This shit ain't hard, have fun, fuck anyone that gets in the way of it.
---
Lol, I've been playing this game since day 1 on vanilla, you presumptuous child
---
The epic book is the only real prize. The blue tomes are basically free already on high pop servers.
---
Alt+up
---
theres one thing to kick a pug before you start and theres another to do it at the instance when the pug spent time to get there
---
Lockboxes are different. Everyone should roll on those, since you still have those when you leave the dungeon. You can get other people to open them. Once you leave the dungeon, the chest is gone. So I’ll agree kicking rogues who do that is fine. 
---
I don’t see what doesn’t entitle them. They spend the time and effort skill up lockpicking. Just like any other profession. Now, it’d be nice, and probably more widely accepted to let the rogue keep the chest as long as he offers up the boe inside to be rolled on, or gives it to someone it’s an upgrade for, but I personally don’t think he should have to do that. He’s using his class exclusive profession to make money. Just like the herbalist of the group. You aren’t expected to roll for dreamfoil.
---
3% crit dmg?
---
Yes I did :D
---
Not everyone has thousands of hours to pour into it. Most nights I'm lucky if I can get one group going and all of us make it to the dungeon, then after that I only have time for a few quests then I've got responsibilities to handle.
---
We've all been in bad groups and tried to make it work just to not have to do it all over again. Ever moreso in classic, where it takes way longer to 1) find a group and b) get everyone there.
---
Oh my gosh I think I spaced on linking it in the classic post, lemme give you the info on The Pink Fund that they gave me from last year. :) 
---
[Here we go!](https://imgur.com/a/0ir0Mkd) This seems to be a pretty fair breakdown of their financials for the year of 2018. 
---
They're not yet on charity navigator and stuff, but they're newer. I did meet and know a few people in the community who have benefited from them and similar charities over the past few years, but The Pink Fund seemed the most well thought out.
---
Suggested solutions *are* reasonable because doing anything less means we're screwed.
---
Even if this was true, and ignoring that you seem to be discrediting what she said just because she has autism which is super shitty.
---
Why do I care? Her getting her ideas from her parents or having autism doesn't make what she's saying wrong. It's just character assassination and ad hominem.
---
Who are you foolin, we all know they're alts at this point
---
see this is why some people like u r really funny, u just think for no reason, cuz people all say that, so u must think its good. If everyone start jumping out of windows, would u also follow?
---
I bet most people reply me here never play warrior before
---
Suppose if you compare it to pservers.
---
You just need to go to the meeting stone, right click, and it brings up the LFG
---
Free Action Potion
---
You should know better, then
---
Thanks for the feedback! I find it annoying that you can only see the timer in game after you're already locked out and my guild tends to do it the day before reset. Wowhead's timer works but I'm more interested in quickly being able to see the reset day and kill window for the following week so I don't have to figure that out by looking at a timer for reference.
---
Even if it wasn’t an upgrade, most people like to collect their tier 0 set just for fun.
---
“Furious bite” kek
---
As a rogue I roll on them. Also if there are multiple herbalists I roll for the herbs too. 
---
None of it is have gotten to without the group.
---
Or, maybe play the game how you want, and I'll play how I want

I tried to name my guy slowdive but it was taken :(

oh no way? I didn't know that! That doesn't work with dungeons, so I assumed it didn't for raids. Gonna try try that, I can't raid yet, but im curious and im gonna check it out, thanks.

There's a guild on our server called &lt;Greta Cthunberg&gt; so I guess it's already too late
---
As an off tank, hovering at 6-8th in p1, I've been hit by 4 consecutive fireballs in a row following this strategy. I had approximately 100hp left after the 4th one hit. 
---
Makes me wonder if there's a seperate  p2 threat table in addition to the p1 table but p1s receives priority. 
---
With this experience I've had, it's impossible (unless we admit it's bugged) that the fireball is a threat wipe or static numerical drop, it has to be a percentage similar to her p1 wing buffet.
---
The thought process behind two tables is that it would be impossible for me to consecutively hold top threat for 4 fire balls in a row unless it happened and the beginning of P2, and it didn't, it happened when she was around 46%.
---
Anyway, I find it fascinating after 15 years I've never seen a completely accurate statement. It's interesting to say the least.
---
Nah, When someone rolls on a herb I just pick it, don’t be such a fucking loser.
---
A chest I’ll roll but a node Is first come first serve.
---
Are you using the LookingForGroup and World channels? I see PuGs for Ony/MC every week on my server (Herod), though it might be different for you.
---
According to Blizzard:
---
Hitcap for 300 weapon skill against lvl 63 enemy with 315 def rating: 9%
---
The first 1% of your additional hit chance on ur gear is negated if the enemy you are fighting against has more than 10 def rating than you got weapon skill.  So this shouldn’t apply to humans with swords/maces or orcs with axes. Which means, if i understood correctly, that 305 weapon skill simply requires 1% less hit rating? Could be wrong though, the blue post i got the information from is a bit cryptic lol.
---
Source: https://www.wowhead.com/news=292085/hit-cap-in-classic-wow-clarifications
---
I mean, usually when there's more than 1 warrior in a group it doesn't work that well anyway. The dps warriors can't seem to be able to hold themselves back and just pump damage and steal aggro off the tank.
---
As a healer I try to give them a hint that they should chill by only healing them with renew or not at all.
---
Stamina. Stamina=Health and warlocks can convert health to mana at a profit with life tap.
---
If you have a question not answered by any of the blue posts provided or in my screenshot maybe you should ask blizzard.   If you want to try to make a point please make sure it holds up against reality and facts.
---
Wolf/worg has furious howl, deathmaw has the tied fastest attack speed of any wolf.
---
Bezzle was a douche but the question is dumb af both sides are valid
---
He's trolling you. Best way of finding a raid is with your guild, or looking for pugs (usually for Ony) in the world chat or lfg channel.
---
I'm 60 alliance on Noggen, STV and Badlands were hell to quest in, rest wasn't so bad and at 60 it's pretty ok. It's a horde dominated server for sure but you don't notice it as much at 60
---
For me it is pretty obvious. As soon as you are in a party for a dungeon or raid, all classes throw their skills and talents in one pool. So it doesn't matter if the rogue is the only one who can open it. Same to mage with water or the healer healing people.
---
You’re projecting by assuming I have hatred of her. I do however dislike the politics propelling her into the spotlight for points.
---
He's not wrong. People are way too obsessed over BIS gear.
---
that isnt even working either :(
---
But even then broadcast conference calls are much more environmental then flying a private jet around the world for a meeting.
---
I think it’s a matter on logging on at the right time. I’ve seen most raids start around 7:30-8pm. So the recruiting for pug raids might happen earlier than that.
---
Yeah sorry, not biting.
---
misclick on their behalf probably (invite/ignore)
---
As feral Druid at level 31, im a rogue with heals. So it's not bad, I dps as well as other classes single target, often #1 on the board for now, I enjoy the mobility, and PvP capabilities when it comes to cc/poly. And I can spot heal. If the healer randomly afks or leaves a dungeon grp so we don't wipe. Versatility is my middle name.
---
I’ve always been a priest and tried out warrior as an alt. I fell in love when I first put on some mail armor and heard it jingling, been playing warrior ever since haha.
---
Sure. Fair enough.
---
You should let everyone know which server you play on and your character name - so they know to avoid you.
---
I assume someone has a lot of hatred for someone if they're making as hominem attacks against them and calling them mentally disabled.
---
If you don't like what she's saying, make an argument against it. You can't because it's climate science though, I think we both know that. Hence the irrationality of the hatred.
---
I can main heal BRD, LBRS or Strat/Scholo and then change gear and go DPS to raids.

"Most of the common folk know little of Dwarven reproduction, as Dwarves are famously taciturn about matters of sex and procreation. However, it is clear to everyone that something is different about Dwarven courtship. There are no Dwarven couples, no visible Dwarven courtship rituals, and, crucially, no Dwarven women. Every Dwarf in existence is male and, by all appearances, solitary, until he shows up with a tiny, bearded baby strapped to his back and flailing a toy hammer. A plethora of humorous theories and jokes about how such a child might come to be born can be heard in any alehouse on Arth, provided there are no Dwarves present."

Honest question, how do you put up with all that? I’m not super into pvp but even if I were this doesn’t sound fun at all. You can barely play the game you’re paying for every month. What keeps you there?

---
Rolled for 2 onyxia bags. I got a 99.. There were 2 100s
---
I did 14 am arm just go get ravager. It level me from 38-43 with a few quests in between. I was so determined one of my friends thought I was crazy.
---
Plz block me too
---
Lol, I figured. Good thing I haven't opened the game yet. I was like "no way?!" but kinda knew it was bs lol. Thanks though. I rarely see people lfg for ony or mc on world chat or lfg channel tho, im in Azuresong. It was a medium server pop until like 3-4 weeks ago when it turned into a high population, but still can't see any. I'll be more attentive to it now.
---
See? You're doing it again, making no arguments because you can't.
---
I think if you want to be a rational person, you should look at yourslf, ask why you can't make any arguments against this and perhaps re-evaluate your views?
---
Wondering the same thing myself lately, with as bad as it has gotten. If you stick to dungeon grinding, it’s hardly noticeable but that is boring.
---
I came back for classic.  Hadn't played in 4 years.  I find myself leveling my main in retail just for the story.  I'm not liking any of the other aspects of retail though.  I miss playing a death knight, and I miss my green fire on my warlock
---
Yes, this is called multiboxing and it is allowed, as long as you own both accounts (account sharing is not allowed)
---
delete this
---
Staying until next patch rolls out.
---
Yes I run 5.
---
I thought you blocked him? Oh I see, you're just being a concern troll and you don't actually care that he posted the name of the guild. I'll do you a favor and just block you, so you won't have to take the time to do it yourself.
---
Yeah that's the thing, I rarely see them in world channel or lfg channel. Might be a server thing, I'm on Azuresong, where it was a medium population and turned high population only 3-4 weeks ago. But I'll be more attentive and look for raid lfgs.
---
Yes.  Launch the game from the .exe file instead of the launcher.
---
There is also a multiboxing software that will do it for you for a click of a button for small cost.  There's many actually but just find one that you enjoy they will load 4-8 instances for you at once.
---
Maybe so, but you don't get a message if another party member resets or get invited to another party. 
---
Try writing "/fl r" to reset, does it work?
---
bet you are the kind of person that steals a chest or important Quest-mob while another player is clearly getting rid of other mobs to get access to it.
---
"My your a tall one"
---
Just google "Fantasy map making" and there should be plenty of youtube videos, it's actually alot like drawing stick figures :) No artistic skill required!
---
Usually people pug for Ony more than MC because it's a shorter raid, and pugs tend to be a bit special clearing all of MC. 
---
Check your realms discord channel aswell
---
Actually, I’m not making a debate or argue Kent against it because this isn’t the place for it. Reddit is also widely known for far left group thinkers and any attempt to use non left sources is immediately rebutted by calling the source fake or propaganda. Climate science is far from settled. And MAN MADE climate change is negligible. How do you propose to change that which we cannot affect?
---
I’m a level 52 warrior wanting to dip my toes into BRD. Is there a specific type of run I should be trying for at that level? Is it useless to try getting a group until I have a couple more levels anyway? Because the level range is so big and I don’t have prior experience, I’m not sure what i should be shooting for.
---
Playing classic until I get bored and then quitting wow completely.
---
Ilyena ravenoak has always had a huge aggro radius
---
Salvation. Makes raiding so much easier.
---
Read the names champ.  I'd tell you the blocked guys name but I can't see his post.  This is a new guy.  Reading comprehension 0/10
---
Ugh, spotted the scumbag. I was hoping you were just out of touch in this one scenario but looking through a couple of your recent posts show that you're generally awful. I feel sorry for anyone who has to deal with you in daily.
---
Durotar for nostalgic reasons.
---
It appears that it has been recently cleansed and looted by someone else. You need to wait for the respawn. The plants dont disappear after being used, they just become uninteractable
---
If mobs are gray for one member of the party - rest would be getting ~5% exp from kills.  
---
Boosting is only efficient if booster is 6-8 levels higher.
---
But world drop rates are actually lower because you can farm just one mob, but everyone is farming everything and it's that low.
---
then maybe they should just make a guild-only group, instead of wasting the time and effort of other players like a bunch of assholes.
---
We found the priest in the vid, everyone!
---
I too think when people say DM in Westfall at level 19, they mean dire maul.
---
Growth potion recipe and devist fish. Way easier for horde
---
It’s apples and oranges man.   Yes, lock picking IS a profession, but it’s a class skill people are expected to level as part of playing the class.  If you don’t want to level it, don’t, doesn’t bother me man.  I haven’t leveled lock picking in 12 years so I don’t recall the investment, but when I level my rogue I personally will level it again and give away free rolls.
---
The whole giving away herbs/ore is an argument that just doesn’t hold up when chests can contain things pertaining to other folks too.
---
Yeah other guy just seems like a contrarian, I mean it was painfully clear why you mentioned the 2 healers thing.
---
I'll agree with your argument when miners and herbalists start asking people to roll on nodes. Until that happens, this argument makes no sense.
---
Yea she's a hunter with eagle eye radius
---
Hi, I’m Patrick!
---
Regular melee hits do not.  Only abilities that add combo points do.
---
And, not sure for rogues, but druids have a talent that give double points for a critical hit of an ability.  Assuming rogues have that and more.
---
Seriously, every Horde coming here whining I invite to roll Alliance on literary any pvp realm, even the so called balanced ones. It’s an eye opening experience
---
Arena runs are what you're looking for. It has the potential for good gear for you and it's appropriate for your level. Expect to run arena multiple times in a row with the same group because it's so short.
---
Also consider doing a low-level quest run and a key run.
---
Hey again.
---
Dunno if this is related but another poster messaged me at the same time as you with a screenshot from a GM they asked about layer. We are disagreeing about what was said and I am asking that poster to contact the GM again for clarification.
---
I was thinking maybe that was what you were referring to. If so, or even if not but you are interested anyways I can keep you in the loop if I find out anything more. Even if it shows I was totally wrong and you were totally right.
---
 Let me know.
---
What server is this? I swear I had the same guy in my lbrs group
---
In that case I forgot my lockpick tool sorry no chest for you.
---
I mean. The rogue can always just lie and claim they haven't leveled lockpicking and claim the chest after group has cleared dungeon. And would it make any difference to the group? Same thing for a group without a rogue. Those chests just don't exist to a group without means to open them, so I feel that a rogue is just entitled to it. Think of it as a brick that only one class can get value out of. I'm not going to demand that one class hand over that value just because they are in a group.
---
They need to be no more than 3 levels lower than last boss of dungeon.
---
And I will agree with yours when I start getting epic gear from nodes.
---
Lockpicking actually is a leveled skill though that involves its own isolated grinding from 1-max, making water is something you just get by leveling. The two aren't even remotely comparable lol
---
Fiancée and I are on this server. However, it’s tough finding a guild that’s active and mature.
---
This issue is bigger and older than WoW. Back in the day in MUDs, organization leaders would police their own PvPers or else similar faction dominance and imbalance would occur - PvP requires targets and multiplayer games have struggled a lot with a healthy and engaging player balance.
---
Stealth running tribute carries was the most stressful thing Iv some in this game
---
Yah we called it DM in Vanilla, Dire Maul wasnt out so it made sense to call Dead Mines DM.
---
Just do quests.  
---
At 42 there will be 4 quests in Uldaman, each of them getting 2-3 gold reward plus items that also sell for 1-2 gold.  
---
Higher level -&gt; faster gold farming.
---
*The gun is good*
---
I'm excluding less people so ya that feels better.
---
Best part haha
---
He's almost 60 on kurinaxx. I have him added as a friend. (Yo it's Deadlift, Thex!!)
---
ive found an owl works well for threat. screech adds a lot of threat, and after a few screeches you can usually multishot multiple mobs or mend pet.
---
Probably some videos on youtube. Bean, Jellybeans and Ahmpy have been running them a lot on Twitch lately if you want to check their vods.
---
Well, what addons do you have?
---
Stamina.  4 mp5 is just so unnoticeable in most class play but especially for warlocks who can convert already and life drain.
---
It’s only available to alliance players because you need to talk to the librarian in Stormwind iirc
---
As soon as there's another warrior in the group I'd even tank with my ww axe...
---
As a ret paladin who is only just hitting 40 and has no intention of raiding in the future, I have no idea how I'm going to handle looting. A lot of pre-raid Bis for ret paladins are mail and leather but I can already feel the drama that may happen. 
---
Haven't joined a guild probably will at lvl 60 so I can farm dungeons in peace
---
Well, you seem too far gone for reason. But just try not to be abusive in the future.
---
That's not gonna work. I have trouble reading my own handwriting. 
---
I wasn't trying to insult you by guessing you were Horde. You missed the Rebel Camp.
---
HoJ and Brairwood aren't ultra rare items.
---
No group is better than a bad group.
---
Herod?
---
What addons are you using?
---
The most annoying thing about my level 60 hunter is my inventory is FULL with food / arrows  ... I do however enjoy controlling my pet and making sure he’s attacking the right mob or not face pulling
---
FYI, I have an account where it’s sole purpose is to snipe any cross faction gold/item trading.
---
Be smart about it or you might get burnt
---
Exactly
---
The reason I don’t try to debate. Ears are closed, heads are in sand.
---
But that gain doesn't exist without said rogue unless you have a BS with a key for it. So it's effectively worthless without the rogue. That would also raise the argument then should herbs and ore in the dungeon also be rolled on by all party members then as well? Same thing.
---
That means rogues should pay for portals, food, health stones, summons, and any other class utility that is given to them.
---
&gt; Findings are inconclusive. 
---
No. They are not. This is a lie. Climate change is real, we are causing it. Period. 99% of the world's fucking scientists are not in a conspiracy against fossil fuels.
---
&gt; "You do what we tell you or you're an ignorant moron." is not a proper argument if you want to reach a decision.
---
Good because literally no one said your strawman. Stop being willfully ignorant and listen to the rest of the world and not a tiny subset of politicians with huge bias.
---
I'm definitely the go guy. But since I'm the healer, I  think I have the right to be. I know I can keep the group alive and moving. There's no point in stopping if we can keep going.
---
Not that many,
---
Details, atlas, atlas loot, Mik's scrolling combat text, RealMobHealth, Weakauras, TSM, Elvui and questie
---
Remarkably self reflective of you.
---
Love the Cindy Crawford reference. Guessing OP is &gt;=mid 30s.
---
It's a 15 year old game, every farming spot is known and documented already.
---
No but check out mightymorps response for an example of a strong one
---
Roll-off tournament
---
You still gain about 10-12% dps using your pet. If you aren't stupid you're using a Wind Serpent or a Wolf.
---
The wind serpent will still do about 60% of it's damage just spamming lightning breath and will net you around 5-8% of your total damage. 
---
Wind Serpent and Wolf can be used on any boss.
---
And now you’re simply trolling.
---
This guy gets it.
---
It doesn't take that long to level up lockpicking its it's easier than other professions.
---
I have an alliance character on a pvp server but want to go horde on the same server.   
---
Do I need to delete my alliance character to go a horde?
---
You can't really farm for it like you would a lot of drops.
---
You'd be better off playing the game naturally and using that time to farm gold so you can buy one if it pops up.
---
Beware, with phase2 on the horizon it may cost more now
---
It... is.
---
Suggestions range from few dollars to completely giving up electricity. I stand by my original point.
---
&gt; ahh the appeal to authority fallacy.
---
Ya that's not what the fallacy is. If he actually has the expertise, his opinion is more valued. The only people that actually think the fallacy works how you do are people too ignorant to bother with educating themselves so they choose a copout.
---
I'll try anything four times.
---
Did he get Thex on the new server too?
---
Details or Miks would be my guess.
---
The exact same thing happened in old school runescape
---
/u/imod3 made an edit because they are afraid of downvotes
---
&gt; I love Blizzard. ❤️
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Keep politics out of gaming.
---
&gt; I'm super excited for Diablo Immortal.
---
&gt; Downvote if you agree!
---
What did the original say?
---
Miks scrolling combat text sounds like the obvious one.
---
I don't know though. I don't have any of those apart from questie
---
He's just a dick, but I understand because it's just as good for him as it is for you.
---
Here, I’ll give you just one. https://electroverse.net/another-climate-scientist-with-impeccable-credentials-breaks-ranks/
---
Let med guess, you have this opinion, but also think tage mage is an idiot if he dosent give water or make a free portal after the dunken, if the lock wont summon you, if the druid dosent buff you? 
---
The chest wouldnt exist for the rouge either if the rest of the group didnt help him, right? I hope we can atleast agree on that? So why does he as the only class in the game have a speciel right for his class specific thing, when no other class does?
---
Actually most chests you could in theory stealth and get it that way, also the chest might as well not exist without said rogue so it's absolutely not a group effort at all lol. Particularly since theirs also no guarantee that the Rogues LP is even high enough to crack it or they just lie and grab it later.
---
Ya OP isn't allowed to share an opinion that isn't yours.
---
Go to retail
---
I'm sorry if he's dying to unavoidable mechanics then it's not his fault but I'm glad your ignorantly ranting like it is.
---
If you’re leveling herbalism get to picking briarthorn and mageroyal, those two have a chance to drop swift thistle. On my server a stack goes for 7g. I think briarthorn is  herb skill 50 and mageroyal is 70.
---
My priest hasn't been able to mana burn bear or cat druids
---
Could you open it without the rogue?
---
I've seen people do rolls on the arcane crystal and the end of DM E
---
Head to Desolace.  Before you go stock up on water breathing pots or find a low level warlock and get a pair of 15% swimming boots.
---
On the docks at the horde area is a guy that will take 5 shellfish for 55s.  Plus a lot of other drops.  Crazy gold income for that level and also got me my mount + a lot extra in only 8 hours
---
Same thing for Chaos Theory guild on Atiesh Alliance
---
And yet if you check Warcraftlogs rankings there can be 100-200 DPS difference (20-25%) between #1 and #10 in the all star list for warlocks. All those players are stacking world buffs, and you can see that ilevel isn't the be all, so the only difference is player skill.
---
Soul stones, I am not going to farm these for hours?
---
I mean I'm 20 runs deep and have never seen even the offhand drop. On the other hand I've lost two SGC's in the process of farming HoJ.
---
Yep, (or transfer them if transfers are available)
---
Awesome, thanks! Been hype to finally give it a try and I’m sick of quests that either barely give xp or are a pain in the ass to solo.
---
Ilyena has crazy long aggro radius.
---
But yes the other mobs are strange, they somehow have way longer range than on pservers, despite pservers in every other case on classic has longer range. Something is rly odd with those mobs.
---
Even more sad for her sister, she has nothing to do with it and is still gets harassed like crazy. 
---
This world is retarded.
---
I, too, completed a dungeon. I shall make a Reddit post so everybody knows that I completed a dungeon.
---
God people like you are so fucking dumb
---
you can do this with one account although i’ve only watched it on stream not done it myself. 
---
invite a friend to a party, promote him to leader, then log off while staying in party. jump on an alt, and have your friend invite the alt. friend leaves party. now this is the only part i’m not sure about but the streamer i was watching converted the party to a **raid** (not sure if you need xp too or are just gold farming) and proceeds to farm the instance. when you’re done, log out, and log back on to the alt. after two minutes of your main being logged out, your alt will automatically become the party leader and you can reset.
---
wolf isnt going in to attack and a wind serpent most definitely is not going to be 10% of your dps just using lightning breath
---
I'll make sure to look out for you in the comments, thanks for the support mate!
---
In every situation I've seen someone try and explain it, the answer is "because!".
---
Oh
---
I paid a rogue to camp other hunters for the hour I knew broken tooth was going to spawn.  Best gold spent ever and saved me a week or so of checking!
---
what class? :D
---
\- someone who never played rogue
---
when herb and mining nodes can drop epics we will see that happen
---
I just see professions separate.  The rogue could also have mining and be the one benefitting from keeping his own ore or skins.  I see this analogy a lot but that works for all classes, roll off multiple miners for that ore whatever.  Lockpicking isn't a profession, it's a class skill and if you don't want to use class skills for a group you shouldn't be in a group.  I never ask for the silver cost to port people after a run, I'm in a group so any of my skills are yours to use if you need them.  Doesn't even cost the rogue anything if he has the skill.  And he makes tips in town doing it, just like I can make tips for those ports... when im not in a party in town.  If we don't have a rogue I will use seaforium on a door, again im not going to ask party to help pay for those mats, that's something I had to level, had to buy recipe, get mats and make... but again, in a party I'll use for the good of the party.
---
The mask looks like a flattened Nigel Thornberry with a beard.
---
print screen.
---
There is multiple levels of stupidity but not allowing someone to roll on D0 set items because it’s not BIS is a special kind of stupid.  
---
Last night on my lock (drain spec) was asked by tank in dungeons why I didn’t do more damage since we killed mobs in 15s tops half my Arsenal was unused.  
---
And I tried to hold back so I didn’t steal aggro.  
---
Well I switched to my succ and started dotting everything and hell fire.  
---
Needless to say I was asked to stop doing that /S 
---
A guild member getting a decent gear is 100% better then a shard in the bank.  
---
Hell if you want shards for the Guild 10manning LBRS is really fast.  And would net a lot of extra shards.
---
Rogue player here.
---
I prefer to roll with others mainly to avoid drama/internal conflicts as it is much more conveniant this way and keep the group focused on the dungeon.
---
And since I do not provide AoE abilities (not even playing Combat tree) to speed up the run I can provide those chests
---
Yeah, especially if it's bad on your class and only an upgrade because your gear is bad.
---
Damn, he looks just like Dagoth-Ur.
---
I had 3 similar once to that along the way to 60, funny every time.

For just doing dungeons I would go with a 11/31/9 build to get consecration, holy shield, and the remaining points in ret for some parry.
---
Yea, I leveled up my druid to tank and the fact that bug is not fixed by now is not impressing me much. Blizzard felt they could push out DM but not fix several huge bugs that effect certain classes. Shows that they have no real intention on replicating Vanilla WoW, just milking nostalgia
---
You have to do 2 lvl cap dungeons and a quest to get 55 mage water, rogue can just afk next to a few boxes...
---
I didn't roll, as I already had the item
---
Wait, so druids are not supposed to lose mana if I viper sting while shapeshifted? Wasn't it always like this? I'm honestly clueless, I thought that was how it's supposed to be
---
What are you talking about? What does that even mean? Do you also blame basketball players for being way too obsessed over jumping high? Some people commit a lot of time to the game and want to be the best as well as provide the best outcome for their guild. Jesus christ, man gimme a break.
---
No, I didn't have an option to roll
---
If you’re casual then I wouldn’t because the most sought after enchant formulas are dropped from raids or faction rep grinding.
---
&gt; Since a whole political party denies science is real
---
and the other party says there are infinite genders. How about no poltics and we stick to world of warcraft classic?
---
You can transfer your ally character id transfer is ipen, then create a horde on that server.
---
Your other options are to delete or create a new account and let your old one expire the monthly until you wanna play the ally
---
Correct and to add to this they have a 25 minute respawn which I have confirmed Myself
---
TRICKED
---
"2: Trade: WTS gamer girl bathwater, 3g, pst"
---
I'm talking about the main toon ofc.
---
We did it Reddit!
---
Eh, if I'm in a group with some especially shit people on my rogue I'll just say "my skills not high enough" and then come back and get it after we're done. Only done that like twice though and Holy shit those groups were assholes.
---
And I won't bring you again.
---
Warrior shooting a gun, this is why I love rather free set Classic lol
---
Not by everyone...
---
Runescape for me. I went with my mom to buy wow one day. Was so excited, then realized you had to pay $15 a month to pay.
---
I had a hard time convincing her to pay $5 with her card to jagex. I had $5 but she thought it was a scam. 
---
For some reason she was more okay ordering the membership over the phone though. Still was not happy.
---
Fuckin’ dweeb
---
do your own research and stop being a chode
---
good thing seaforium charges exist
---
I've heard SM graveyard stealth runs can be profitable.
---
Your wrong.
---
If you noticed I said it would be doing 5-8% using lightning breath alone, if the pet is able to stay on the target in melee it does 10-12% of your total damage.
---
I haven't used a Wolf in raiding yet so I don't have logs for it on how it affects your overall damage, but I have all of the logs from the raiding I've been doing the past month to back up my numbers for Wind Serpent dps and it always comes out with me doing more than the other hunter's who usually are using cats.
---
Yep, just last night I spent forever forming a group, then one asshole went afk for like 10 min and said "gotta go I have to make diner."
---
Like what the hell, why even join a dungeon group if you know you have to make dinner?
---
I say I hate it and despise it but I know ima hit 60 as a healing priest and not give two shits if someone is reserving HOJ or whatever. 
---
Orbs on the other hand, I’ll probably let my tank snag the first one but that’s about it.  Haven’t raided much so I can only expect more reserving, witch is reasonable to me I guess.
---
11/31/9 is the standard tanking allocation of talents at 60.  I went 11 holy to start to get consecration, swapped it out for 31 prot at 40, then got conc back at 51. 
---
It seems to work fine for PvP. I can't do much against a mage, but I can usually escape. It's incredibly satisfying to be able to out-duel a rogue or warriors in epic MC gear when you're not even 60 yet.
---
I can't tell if your having a conversation with yourself cause all of your answers are applicable to you and only you.
---
"I don't debate on reddit" proceeds to debate people about climate science and far right insults aimed at a child. 
---
"You're a troll" proceeds to be the only political talk in a sub that isn't politically oriented
---
"Everyone else's ears are in the sand" proceeds to shove head in the ground because climate change is inconvenient. 
---
Shit man this isn't the shower stop debating yourself you already lost.
---
I did.  Carefully read thru 32 comments.  No luck :(
---
I said that time spent != Difficulty. I didn't say anything close to "the game has too much of a time investment requirement" or anything remotely close to that. 
---
I played from release through the end of BC, i knew what the time investment would be before the classic launch. I only just got 60 last night (first time dual boxing, didn't choose the best class combination). 
---
I'm only saying that people keep on spreading the narrative that "classic is harder" and that's objectively false. It's more punishing, and it punishes you by taking your only real resource you bring into the game with you : time.
---
Eng goes not?
---
OK bud.
---
What kind of stupid logic is that haha.. The lock will NEVER EVER be able to summon himself, so he learns summon 100% for the BENEFIT OF THE GROUP. The mage will never ever need to portal himself, it costs 2x the ammount of just teleport, so he learns that FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE GROUP.
---
Lockpick is not a fucking a fucking profession, it is a class unique thing that you can use for your own or THE GROUPS benefit, so if you are in a group you use it for THE FUCKING GROUP.
---
Just because you have to skill it up does not make you some kind of fucking hero because you did so, there are places all around the world that you can easily skill it up and you can even make decent money opening boxes for people.
---
Why does rogues get some kind of spoiled brat benefit on their class specific thing, when literally no other class does? That would be the same as not expecting a portal from a mage after the dungeon because "Hey if that mage wasnt here I would have to HS, so totally cool from him not to make one.." Even tho it actually costs the mage money, he is considered a huge asshole if he dosent, but no man not rogues, they have some exclusive right to be selfish assholes.
---
I'm so happy to hear that you've had a wonderful time at the runs! Like, it just means the world to me that my silly idea that turned into this big thing is fun for people over time. :) Thank you so much for the kind words!
---
Lol, you sound like the smelly, weird guy at work who always talks to himself and creeps the everloving shit out of the women in the office.
---
Same. Also as a Warlock, not having an itchy trigger finger is the best habit for raiding.
---
I understand valor being a bad chest piecr, but an upgrade is an upgrade.  Grats in the upgrade and good luck on the arena/anger runs for savage and HoJ
---
I only just got 60 last night, i get it. It does take a lot more dedication. I just meant to say that classic isn't "harder" -- it just feels more rewarding
---
no choosing sides. They all die.
---
More attractive than the new Greta ;)
---
Oh no not 2-4 hours tops of your time while you can also get pre-raid BiS gear how awful! Because that's exactly like having to grind up a proff that requires zone moving for 1-300 levels worth of it lol
---
The title said "Dungs/Raids" - I wasn't arguing, just pointing out that if I got locked into a raid ID tag, I sometimes decided to stick with a bad group longer than I should have.
---
I love tanking in classic. It makes me question why I played pure DPS classes for almost my entire time playing retail.
---
The one thing burning me out right now is the PUG groups. I'm legit scared to bring in warlocks because the last 4 (no, that's not an exaggeration) all decided we were a spellcleave group and tried face pulling 10+ mobs. I feel like once I'm out of Scarlet Monestary, surely it'll be better; but some of the other warriors in my guild keep assuring it won't.
---
How do you do it?
---
You know, I thought I was just unlucky as I’ve seen him 3 times in maybe 50 runs.  What a joke.
---
I assumed all bosses are on an  equal spawn rate, but is Gorosh rarer?
---
You are in a party. You are part of a team. Open rolls. Get that selfish mindset outta here
---
Tank:  Sorry I need to repair, I am all red.  Don't come back for at least an hour.
---
Also in my opinion, objectively better than retail for me, personally, bc classic isn't built with "consumer retention" in mind ; it's built with "let's make something cool" in mind
---
I LOLd Hard
---
Oh noes, I'm rly scared of /u/badasslemons blacklist!
---
I have played both factions for 15 years lol. There is literally no difference in how shitty the players are toward the other faction. The only difference is some alliance players think they are the good guys for some self deluded reason.
---
The rogue doesn't roll for dreamfoil either, he can herb it just like anyone else.  You say that like the rogue doesn't have professions of his own.  Lockpicking is different, it's a skill that you are brought for.  Rogues can't cc reliably, don't buff anyone, don't do great at aoe.... you take away their ability to help groups get into chests and I don't see much reason to bring a rogue over a more useful class.
---
Is Feral Instinct needed to tank lower level dungeons efficiently? I’ve had issues holding aggro in the few dungeons I’ve tanked.
---
Your entire post stopped being worth reading the second you compared it to mage water. After that why would anyone give a damn about the dumb shit that comes out of your mouth?
---
I do this, and DE greens that are worth it.... but god damn do I hate waking up every morning to go through 50+ items on both my banks so I can make that good profit.
---
ADDONS are a must, or else it would take me forever just to lose even more profit.
---
 Classic.wowhead.com ... theres a timer on the mainpage for EU and NA server..
---
Lol it’s so easy it’s ridiculous, I’ve done it and the amount of bs people are spouting about how hard it is... it’s easier than piss, afk and click or afk and post.
---
8 hours AH timer took it down, no one is buying a non-BIS sword for 2200g.
---
60 rogue here never take chests always roll its just common decency were in the group together then you work together chests are just a bonus
---
keep acting like you actually bring them, you look real tough
---
Everything is a hunter weapon isn’t it ?
---
The answer to climate change is currently: quick everyone, give up everything to the government and we *might* be able to prevent apocalypse once all control is centralized.

Sounds political, no?

SI:7, OPEN UP
---
You heard it here! Playing alliance is the easy setting of wow! 😏
---
Human fellas!
---
Again, read my above comment.
---
An epic that literally wouldn't exist without the rogue lol, also good enough Arcane Crystal drops would be close monetarily depending on your server so not sure what you're getting at.
---
There's about 5 people who try to sell them for 2-3g a piece but people still come for the mom tag. I post them on AH for 6 and advertise 5. I sell 3 or so a day at least still. Waaaayy more if I advertise more!
---
Sauce
---
to a gnome no less. disgusting
---
Unwritten rules are for sore losers
---
Why the down vote?
---
Yes. Because of the firegun I thought he was a hunter. I guess it’s not exclusive to the hunters ahah
---
I agree those 2 dungeons are really easy and it's ridiculous how much people run them, and the BS people are spouting about how hard running them is. Basically just AFKing, especially as a mage.
---
That’s when you call the client to tell them your car broke down and made you miss your zep. 
---
Goddamn rentals man
---
It doesn't have more players than retail.
---
DM?  All I see, is VC.
---
Your just jealous of pally buffs. Be honest.
---
A random group has to conform to anything other than what they want in both games.
---
Well no BiS comes out until AQ and Naxx guess you gotta run around naked until then
---
I wouldn't roll for the arcane crystal I just mined. However, I am willing to roll for the NODE if multiple miners are in the group.
---
Cool, thanks!
---
&gt;Climate change is real, we are causing it. Period. 
---
What is being scrutinized is the effect human action actually has on the phenomenon. You're still sitting here writing on a computer that has a carbon footprint, what's your excuse to draw the line there?
---
&gt; No. They are not. This is a lie 
---
Then why is the climate projection changing almost weekly? It's inconclusive and by no means "basic science", we do not know exact causes or their weight, we don't know exactly what and how much needs to be done to even the scales.
---
Pray tell, what's wrong calling for further study, more funds and resources to the problem before we start enforcing laws about it that affect everyday lives?
---
This type of shit has been happening to me lately (someone rolling low on gear so they start flaming and just leave the group halfway through, refusing to heal because they don't like something you did) really ruining the leveling experience tbh.
---
Everything you wrote are things two or more coordinated players can easily achieve. Nothing mentioned here is abuse of game mechanics.  Was the etc you added an attempt to fill in more bullshit you couldn’t think of?
---
Yeah I keep hearing about jump runs. My gear is getting there...I think I have around 5 bis. How long do jump runs take?
---
55 lvl water is not done by a trainer and takes 2 lvl cap dungeons, Soul stones are not given by the trainer and warlocks will farm them for hours through out their time.
---
nope but you still need sword and shield and switching weapons causes the GCD to go off on shield bash.
---
Jesus, did OP slap your mother? 
---
He's just asking a question about a boss he clearly has experience killing being seemingly stronger.
---
On top of that it raises the point that we really deserve better hotfix notes because there are so many ninja changes going on it's hard to keep up.
---
It definitely leans Alliance, but as it's the only RP-PvP server it's fairly uniquely balanced. I think the server is about 60% Alliance, 40% Horde. Still, Horde raided Stormwind last night, and wiped a Thunderbluff raid the other week.
---
Let me guess, you think the lock is an idiot if he refuse to summon you? Or if the mage refuse to give a portal at the end of the group? You realize that the lock and the mages will never ever ever benefit from thoe spells themselves, it is gold only used to help others.. But nono, rogues have to skill theirs, so obviously they should be assholes and only benefit from it themselves.. jesus.
---
I clam slam where I please
---
The official term is terrain exploiting per the blue post they put out on this back in 2005, yes they do ban for this, report the players involved.
---
dude go to retail we want classic with no changes
---
I'll probably play retail agian when 9.0 hit
---
When I was 10/11 I was an asshole, so a buddy and I used to do this on Runescape. We managed to trick countless people into giving us their passwords by pretending we were Jagex staff. We never actually stole gold, cuz we worried it would get our mains banned, but we’d usually play on their account for a few days until they recovered it - we were total noobs so for us it was fun to just play on higher level accounts.
---
Lol, ironically, I literally am that person. My best one yet was running into a cave and seeing a player finish a mob right beside a chest, he proceeded to try to open it, so I sprinted to him and opened it trade to break the channel, then opened the chest myself.
---
&gt;  Layering has ZERO impact on queues because it has ZERO impact on server capacity.
---
Then please explain the following:
---
How queues decreased dramatically across many realms when they added layers to them.
---
Why server capacities were several times higher than in vanilla despite them telling us they wanted us to have the same server caps
---
What the fucking point in layering is.
---
So you want a redditor to research world pollution himself, instead of getting the source to the research that SoC175 claims to be citing from, which he wants a link to? You're the chode.
---
How is it possible that i cannot find a sm armory group, wtf did the game already die?
---
Gehennas EU Horde
---
L2P
---
Will it be entertaining when those Alliance on your server stop playing? On my server almost 40% of our playerbase on Alliance side stopped playing in phase one. Imagine what will happen in phase 2.  At every dungeon/farm place/quest are 8/10 horde players. I’ve seen how brutal and lowlife horde players jump on Alliance players who are even leveling at their own. It is simple to say to roll on another server or even join the horde but that will make the balance even worse. But hey, your at the safe side so your ‘Classic experience’ will not be harmed.
---
it depends entirely on the situation, the people who reported being warned were ones who never actually killed anyone or only killed 1-2 people, the folks who sit up there and farm the town seem to get banned on the first go round, there were a handful of reddit threads about a month ago of people complaining they got banned without a warning for doing this in gadget, rachet and booty bay.
---
just say you haven't leveled lock-picking.  Finish the dungeon, then go back and take the loot.
---
Haha that's awesome, and very encouraging to hear. One of my biggest worries (I personally wanted to go alliance for this reason) was open world pvp imbalance and queue time imbalance for BGs. Now, we can't speak for the second yet, although I think we will be okay, but for the first though I am constantly seeing 5-10 alliance guarding outside dungeons "owning the spot" essentially. It seems to be a battle between horde and alliance as to who can hold the spot for summons etc. I've noticed this outside BRD, LBRS/UBRS, Strath, Scholo, and DM, essentially making it every high level instance. I'm very excited to see where our server goes!
---
Everyone spends time and effort getting to the dungeon,  I dont see how the ability to lock pick gives rogues the right to free loot when everyone contributes to get there. 
---
Most rogues get a tip to open lock boxes anyways so it's not like it's really a bane to them to lvl it anyways.
---
I just don't see why you think your entitled to free greens and gold for an ability that makes you pick worthy over saying having a mage of someone else, it's like charging for water/food for a mage.
---
I'd just pick another rogue instead that will contribute  to the group instead.
---
Every group i've ever been in, we have rolled for licked chest and the rogue has absolutely no problem opening them for whoever wins. i've yet to run into an issues with the rogue not wanting to roll for it and to take it themselves.
---
I was speaking about lock-pocking, but you obviously knew that and wanted to look clever. Gl trying to make the one of the smallest investment in the game, lock-picking, try and look hard.
---
Same problem here. My internet is fine, still 250 down no problems. Tried a bunch of other games no problems there. Seems to only be WoW for some reason, I've restarted the router, the game, etc and nothing seems to be working.
---
this was really good. that pocket watch twist was great
---
yeah
---
its true. she's not worth hating. her parents and mentors/teachers are despicable for making and/or allowing her to be a proxy for politics she doesn't understand.
---
You won't know, the GM's don't tell you they banned people you just won't see them up there doing it again after you report is read.
---
Wrong. You may not be able to play with the SAME close friend again, but you can make a new close friendship by playing with someone else
---
Eww retail.

No need to get so butthurt about a subjective opinion.

Maybe it's time to get off reddit for a few minutes and calm down.

Getting burnt out on the grind of questing, I am a level 42 Enhance Shaman. Should I switch to resto and just push my last 18 levels in dungeons?

Level 32 alliance Warrior here, I've kind of hit a wall I started playing during the end of vanilla/start of BC when I was younger. I dont really remember leveling being this hard I think there was more quests. Ever since I hit 30 finished up darkshire I have been having a really hard time finding a place to get in a questing/grinding groove. All the quests everywhere are pretty hard to accomplish Solo + being ganked everywhere by packs of horde is really killing my vibe but that's kinda besides the point. Where should I go for quests?
---
&gt; Thank you for this, ive gotten downvoted and argued against for saying this.
---
Thank him for providing misinformation?
---
If you knew what gender was you’d know it had nothing to do with science....classic uninformed talking points
---
Did you play RetroWoW? On that server, there's an extra swing at the end.
---
I started playing in May 2005, but with big breaks I've never been raidind in vanilla. So Classic is like second chance for me to do that.
---
And still me a third time.
---
Nevermind about that info. The guy got butthurt when I asked if he would be willing to ask the GM to clarify.
---
Citation needed.  Citation needed.
---
&gt;What the fucking point in layering is.
---
From my op: 
---
&gt; Layering exists solely to make specific areas not be flooded
---
From blizzard response:
---
&gt;Layers were put in place to help balance the amount of people in a zone at a time, making times like the start of the expansion flow better.
---
Pls let this become a thing
---
Same, and I only saw it once and I don’t even think I rolled
---
People usually tip me 1g for 120 45 water or 20s per stack for 55 water. 1g for a darn port or 30-50s for sw or if.
---
These are really getting annoying. Congrats. But honestly, nobody cares. Enjoy the game to the fullest and stop posting everyday stuff on the subreddit (not just you).
---
Is the Greta in game a puppet as well?
---
1g/teleport is common. 50s/water (min 2 stacks) is also common but I tip 1g usually.
---
Hope you reported that second guy.
---
Lol someone has some serious issues. Way to dodge fucking up.
---
In many situations being a healer doesn't seem much easier.. Only tanks have very easy times finding a full team. Dps classes like mages for example I imagine can have as much or more ability to find groups compared to heals
---
Princess runs are easily solo'd at 60.
---
You can solo dire maul tribute runs as well but it needs a bit of practice to get perfect
---

We mock the people who try to reserve in groups. That and refusing to run dungeons with them is what it takes to solve this.
---
It seems if your under level 40 I’ve only had to pay 50s but if I run to the mage on my mount they seem to ask for 1g for a teleport.
---
Rouge main here. 
---
I have no problem unlocking a chest for the group to roll on. 
---
With that said though I also spent about 6 hours leveling my lock picking from midnight to 6am. Pulled aggro from my fiancee. Also, running around finding footlocker on the ground is not fun at all. Especially with multiple rouges doing the same thing. 
---
I also main a mage. I spent about 2min porting to a city to buy my spell for food/water...So basically anyone trying to say that mage water is anywhere close to rouge lock picking is ignorant.
---
Or legit getting to every dungeon first then waiting for 2 others to help summon.

Obviously being rolled for

What happens when they smack a whopping 33s in the trade for 120water? Accept? Decline?

Yes that's how it is on Mograine. We on the alliance are just not interested in pvp.

I didn't have any evidence to report him. It was all private messages. I hope she reported him though.

"I hate this game so much I want it to be over the most quickly as possible."

How the hell can u possibly know that by lvl 10? Newsflash, every server will appear dead at lvl 10, because everyone is still in mains mode and havent moved to alt mode yet. You've gotta give it quite a bit longer than just lvl 10 to get any type of accurate feeling on a server.  I think your problem is something else than thinking the server is dead, maybe wow just bores you and isnt your type of game

My server in vanilla was Alliance-dominated. They were considered the best faction for raiding due to paladins, iirc. I went into Classic having no idea that this had changed over the years because I quit ages ago.
---
You want to blame someone really badly, it seems. Perhaps the blame is on a game that leaves this choice open-ended rather than funneling players one way or another.
---
Put another way, should I blame the alliance for not stepping it up and recruiting all their friends to Herod to preserve balance?
---
Wanding and dancing
---
Oof that first one. I've seen a couple of priests turn almost fatal pulls into certainly fatal pulls. Not fearing in dungeons is kinda like not looking down the barrel of a gun, you kinda expect everyone to know not to do that but somehow you still find those people who don't.

And he aint even repping his guild &gt;:(

&gt; From blizzard response:
---
That's not blizzards response, that's a fucking low level customer service agent. GMs talk out of their ass and lie all the time and what could possibly make you think he would know anything about this.
---
Also his response makes no sense, the server caps were explicitly designed such that this wouldn't be an issue at the playercap, so it would be completely unnecessary unless server caps were raised.
---
You also missed a question (granted do to my slow edit)

How it solves the issue of tourists, the problem it was explicitly created to fix, if it doesn't increase server caps?

---
You upvoted this exact same thing 14hrs ago
---
The group should be able to take advantage of class specific abilities. Just like mages giving out free water, rogues should unlock things for free, such as doors and chests.
---
I read a comment on here recently that resonated with me, and it applies to this situation perfectly:
---
"While leveling, we're all DPS"
---
You did nothing wrong, mate.
---
I use Mik’s, it doesn’t do that. Has to be Details.
---
you type like someone who got divorced at 23
---
Leave it for the Rogue! They leveled the skill, should be for them ;-) 
---
My two cents.
---
(Warlock here.)
---
Gender is a self imposed identity, not backed by anything other than a persons feelings, which is valid and okay. Sex is a division of people based on their reproductive functions, which is a different thing, and to my knowledge cannot be changed.
---
It is political you potato
---
Aside from neither missing 15% over one minute or ten minutes being worse, you just made and countered your own point. Short fights allow for variance. If a fight is long enough, the same fight done over and over again will produce the same amount of damage. I don’t think we disagree on anything other than the “worse” statement.
---
Basically this. I see it happen all the time.
---
Do you have to get into master looted UBRS runs to actually have them run? End game classic seems really toxic and not worth it tbh.
---
Yeah the whole 45 min it takes to lvl lock-picking is so brutal, no way I’ve spent that at dungeons waiting for help to summon.
---
I just hope these people will die in eternal fire of pain and agony. Annoying c\*nts.
---
Gamon is Prometheus!

Naw man

---
Thanks for this great refresher!
---
Does this work for resources? I would assume not, seems really OP
---
Lol you are almost certainly a fat disgusting mess of a human
---
&gt;The rogue should keep it because he’s the one who has to spend the time and effort leveling lockpicking.
---
Sitting in IF getting paid to open boxes,  how terrible
---
Are you sure they aren't using Immolate? I've never seen a single lock use Searing Pain once let alone tab target groups and you've somehow seen it consistently thru multiple runs in a row? Idk man.
---
More like smooth brains who cannot use context clues.
---
It wouldn't surprise me if he is since he is also a higher level than the others.
---
Please feel free to attempt to explain what the problem is.

hopefully

&gt; What is being scrutinized is the effect human action actually has on the phenomenon

Again, no the fuck it isn't. This has been determined. It takes two seconds to look at the data lol.

---
Don't enable people to make up their own facts
---
Do female centaur have udders in addition to boobs?
---
The lock will spend more time each week farming shards for summons, Healthstones and so on, the mage will spend more gold on making portals/learning the skill for portals, than the equivilant time investment that the rogue did all time getting to skill 300, you are not a hero because you leveled lockpicking, it is easy as fuck.
---
ok, well that confirms it. You really havent played classic. It has nothing to do with conforming. He could be any spec and be able to heal any dungeon his level pretty easily. And with the amount of gold it takes to respec its rediculous to demand someone drop that kind of cash to respec when theres no need too. So its not as simple as “just respect like they want lul”
---
It looks almost exactly like the map I'm the game. It's like 99% identical. And you were wondering if he drew it from memory?
---
It’s even better since they’ll log out, switch characters and fly their stronger toon to your location.
---
He made fun of your intelligence, in the most grammatically unintelligent way.
---
Accept.
---
Watermark your work or its definitely getting stolen and thrown on an online graphic tee shop for profit.
---
Looks great though.
---
And once you hit 225 its easier instead of harder lol just sit in IF and get paid to skill up.
---
I remember Thex. Good to hear he's almost 60.
---
What about Chestnutz? He's the one I wonder about. We need more like him.
---
Those calculations were shown to be wrong from Blizzard, they came back stating that this was incorrect.

Yes, Dire Maul *is* DM. Deadmines is also DM. For anyone that  honestly has trouble figuring out which one someone is talking about in world chat, I feel sorry for you.
---
I've noticed just why I personally hate tanking against a lot of rogues. Cheap shot openers. 80% of rogues will cheap shot my target before it's even hit me once. Which I hate cause I get very little rage and consequently lose aggro immediately
---
Because Blizzard cut a lot of corners 🙂
---
Not even a mediocre mage should lose to a warrior.
---
I say this as a stance dancing, free action potion popping warrior.
---
Short of your stupid planning or over confident; i should never kill you.
---
But my god so many mages are exactly that; stupid or over confident.
---
The damage modifier is pretty big since most hunter’s level BM. Maybe if a hunter is your second char and you can get blue bows while leveling and go MM it would be faster overall
---
Is thread based on the damage you deal and how do you dps in Classic?
---
I went to MC yesterday for the first time, we made it into Baron Gedon and today we'll try to finish it. The problem i have is that i brough consumables ( +Shadow / + Spell DMG pots ) as a warlock but i barely could did any DPS, i'm full Pre-Bis and as soon as i threw 2/3 Shadow Bolts+ Corruption + CoA i would be at 80% Aggro or more according to the Addon, so next all i could do was stand still wishing my dots dont steal the aggro.
---
Should i just not bring any Consumables and that way do less dps so i dont steal the boss? That way i'll spend less time doing nothing and end up dealing the same amount of damage overall I mean what's the point of being top dps for the start of the fight when there will come a point in which i'll just watch others do DPS.
---
Winterspring. I had the frostsaber in classic, and I just love the zone in general. It's beautiful.
---
As a Mage, I don’t charge for water (but take tips) and ports I charge for the mats (again tips are nice).  But I don’t charge people.
---
Warlocks dont facepull in spell cleave groups...
---
If you were a rogye you wouldn't be posting this. In rooms with only regular auto-attacking mobs, this still happens all the time. No dots, no stealth detection, nothing.
---
Somehow a single mob just gets a hit through on you which breaks your vanish stealth immediately.
---
&gt; is comically disingenuous
---
you know what is comically disingenuous?

Just straight up ignoring the fact that locks have to farm shards, that the mage has no use for portals thelselves, they could just not spend money on learning the skill and 20s for every portal.
---
Each week mages and locks spend more time getting those rescources than the rogue did getting 300 lockpick, unless the rogue did it in some stupid ass way.
---
Lmao imagine being this fucking stupid
---
As a 42 warrior who only contributes as a tank and dps(until I lvl bs) I see no problem with letting the rogue take the locked chests, being greedy fkers is kinda their main character trait
---
Imo if a rogue opens a chest let roll it out. I did it this way back in vanilla. If there is no rogue around I’ll use my Powerful Seaforium Charge and keep it. If the rogue is clever he just says: doesn’t have skill and open it after the run. RPG like :D
---
Biggest bug I’ve found is how mobs do not act at all how they did in Classic. They’re clearly BFA mobs in terms of behaviour.
---
At least it's better than HoJ. I've been helping guildies try and farm gear and we've seen two savage glad chains and no HoJs in our last 100-150 runs. We may also be cursed considering the warlock in our group hasn't gotten his sash (which isnt supposed to be rare) in that number of runs, and then there was a bug where he couldn't enter the instance and it dropped. We also saw the omnicast boots drop something like 50-100 times in a row so no nagerling for the tank. Literally had group members laughing histarically when we see the boots drop now just because it's so hateful to see the same item so many times. We're either riding a statistically improbable wave of bad luck, or some asshole at blizzard is altering our loot tables and chuckling maniacally as they see us run it over and over again for some crappy minor upgrades.
---
&gt; If you have questions for blizzard feel free to ask them.
---
No, I'm asking you, because you're the one making assertions that make 0 sense if you consider those questions for half a second.
---
&gt;  I've said provide proof.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-GobXQTf6w
---
Cannot. It definitely is a bug.
---
Devilsaur is pretty over-rated for hunters in general.   I'm at 8% hit wihtout buying it, its not at all needed and HIGHLY over-rated.    I refuse to spend 300g on a set, especially when I'm gonna replace it with Giantstalker anyway.
---
And thus taxation is theft.
---
Voids have a taunt.   It can be on  autocast or not.   Not sure it works against bosess have to try it sometime.  Void is usually not out for groups.
---
I bring them for when rogues can't open chests. No reason to waste a chest
---
I'm keen to copy paste the comment you replied to in hopes you would read it :)
---
With 58 you should spellcleave lbrs almost double the xp of brd
---
Lollipop eating children don’t generally roll pvp servers.
---
samesies
---
Come join my guild! We’re looking for more members
---
Owl definitely gets my vote. I believe they have 7% dmg modifier but neutral armor/hp.
---
No taxation without.... rolls?
---
Yeah that's my struggle too. But I cant get gold for it if I cant sell. Hopefully in a week or so it get more lively
---
Balances? In retail? Yeah you don't even play retail if you are saying that shit. The retail population is 80/20. Horde/alliance. It took alliance 6 weeks longer than the horde to complete their hall of fame achievements.
---
Calm down lol
---
&gt; Locks learn summons
---
Which they farm shards for, which aren't bought from a trainer. 
---
&gt; mages learn to make water
---
The first few ranks are form a trainer, but the good water, the water people expect and ask for, they have to do a quest line to learn.
---
&gt; healers learn to heal
---
Sure, the mana pots they drop to keep the group alive in a clutch though, has to be farmed for. 
---
______
---
In a pug should the Lock not summon, because they have to go out in the world to gets shards? Should the mage only offer the group level 45 water, because they'd have to go to effort to improve their class for the benefit of the group? Should the healer not drop a clutch potion to prevent a wipe, because they had to farm that potion?
---
Everyone shares. Every time someone drops a group buff it costs them their own money, for the sake of the group. 
---
Why should a rogue be any different? 
---
And sure, why not roll for Herbs/Minerals? No one asks for it, but I would happily share my herbs evenly across the group.
---
Join a guild thats the best way
---
yep Details was the culprit. Something in the recent update is causing this.
---
Well they are probably gonna ask a mage for a free portal or a lock for a summon to make it faster and get mad when they refuse. I cant belive what those rogues have to go through.
---
I got both of mine in 3 runs.
---
So making fun of idiots means I need to calm down? I think you're projecting lol.
---
Never say never, but I'm enjoying classic while retail was just a time sink. Really looking forward to BGs.
---
Haha had a guy ninja the tribute chest cuz he thought everyone got their own chest
---
I always pay a gold for a port anywhere and i gladly pay it lol usually do a gold for a stack of 100 water if I have a lot of healing to do that day and I’ll use that much water
---
If I come to the mage, I tip 50s for 60 to 80water.
---
If the mage comes to me, 1g.
---
My hearth to grom gol makes ports not worth my gold.  And if the mage wont do that price, plenty others will. It is easy money wthout cooldown.
---
Ports are 1g. Water unless you ask for like 200, I'm happy with whatever tip for lvl 45 water. Now if you want a TON of water and or food (which is fine) I charge 1g as well. It also (slightly) depends what lvl I'm at.
---
If i just hit Lvl 50 (when you get lvl 45 water) and you ask me for 60-80-100 water and I can only make them x2 at a time I expect a decent tip.
---
 Purely because YES i just have to click a button its "free" water but when i have to sit there and hit that one button 20-30-40 times PER PERSON, that takes up MY play time (especially when people feel your obligated because you play a mage) and I expect at that point to be compensated.
---
I think that's fair to an extent, doesnt always have to be 1g but consider how much you would spend overall without mage food and water, plus the time I've taken to make it and tip appropriately. 
---
This is just my opinion though.
---
Since proposed "scientific solutions" cost trillions of dollars with very little discernible benefit
---
Your feeling are irrelevant here. Pvp will happen in pvp servers regardless of how fair you think it is.
---
At least that is a honest mistake! Not this taxation for leading a group that was doing just fine.
---
I stopped heading to dungeons if I don’t see others heading over, and I say it now.
---
How they treat the other faction is no different. How they view themselves is different.
---
Let me know if you have any other questions
---
chance on hit proc is simply too good. especially if you're combat sword specced
---
Because that’s just how it works???
---
Seriously lol Ive never understood that. Its literally apart of the game, and my main has alch so I give my warrior health pots for obvious reasons haha
---
Does it matter when the message is pure? what good have you done?
---
Very nice warrior pvp. I’m so bad compared to you!
---
I would use alt + f4 and not be out for too long.
---
True that man I didnt expect to win at all lol
---
Portals are fucking expensive as abiluties and mats. Locks have ti farm shards and always walk to dungeons whioe the rest get to be teleported because of our class. Everyone has downsides to those things and trying to stretch leveling lockpicking as hard or expensive is laughable
---
5 hunters in my core guild raid, sigh.
---
I played BDO for 1.5 years and left with resentment. It is everything that everyone here describes it as to be. It has nice graphics, open world, fun action combat, and great character creator but aside from that it has no substance at all. You end up doing the same thing over and over again with terrible rewards and their cash shop is the most disgusting shit ever. I wish I quit sooner but now at least I can warn people to not fall for the bullshit. I could go on and on about the negatives with bdo and the crap that PA/KA pull on their dedicated players.
---
Yup
---
If it takes you more than 2-4 hours to level lockpick to 300 once you are lvl 60, you are doing it hella fucking wrong.. A lock will spend more than 2-4 hours EACH week farming shards to summon and make HS for people.. This argument is about as stupid as they come.
---
Did you watch what you linked? What exactly do you think it's saying that supports something you've said?
---
I don't think it works like that. 
---
Equip: Increases damage and healing done by magical spells and effects by up to 22. ([Omnicast Boots](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11822/omnicast-boots))
---
Equip: Increases healing done by spells and effects by up to 26. ([Boots of the Full Moon](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18507/boots-of-the-full-moon))
---
I'm pretty sure only the first equip bonus increases your spell damage. Both increase your spell healing though.
---
This comment should be a help tip on the loading screen. So true.
---
Okay well explained. I will judge less with wisdom now^^
---
You should be using ironfoe over Mira’s anyways, and it’ll solve your problems.
---
Its uldaman who cares
---
&gt; slaves groaning
---
you realize in classic both warriors and rogues have specs based on what weapon they have and you change it based on if you get a bis weapon?
---
Okay, you said that alliance only gank in groups or 1v1 when enemy is at low health, and then you said alliance and horde are the same.
---
That's the contradiction I'm referring to.
---
You wont take aggro untill you're at 130% threat if you're at range, so you could have done more than 50% more damage without taking aggro.
---
You're hard
---
I'd say it's probably the best mmo for new players since you can play it however you want, from having to figure everything out yourself including where some quests are to having everything pointed out to you with addons and wowhead.
---
A bump if I can!
---
They should still be able to get mana burned.  They still have mana.
---
100% this, if people have any other view on this, they are spoiled brats who watched too much of asshole streamers.
---
Etiquette matters. WoW classic is very much a social game
---
It gets even worse, there is /more/ competition because you add in paladins to the list of pepole that want it too. Sorc dagger? They can't wear it.
---
lmao got his ass
---
You should have given the 20g back imo. He payed you to pass on roll, but if you can't roll at all then you shouldn't take any money, you're not eligable for the item.
---
Seems to have been the area on the map. I left the zone and lost all issues... really weird been talking to blizz they are trying to figure it out
---
wow thats incredible, I really like how you did the bunches of the trees and what you did with the solid block of mountains on east side. PLease do more zones
---
kinda like Koreans?
---
The sad part is this is probably going to be the highlight of your life.
---
Prot paladin might be able to with a very very specific gearset that unfortunately I don't think is available yet.
---
You're actually mentally challenged.
---
These aren't pserver calculations, and they weren't shown to be wrong. The data I linked was gathered entirely in the Beta. You have an 8% miss rate and 9% hitcap against +3 enemies, which the data I linked also displays. Hell, the blue post you just linked is one of the first things linked on the page.
---
Did you even look at it, or did you just dismiss it right away?
---
Well let’s try the 2$ first and see how it goes, rather than do nothing with thumbs up our ass. If you see a guy bleeding from his neck, you don’t go “damn I wish I had some gauze and stuff to clean the wound w/“ you run the fuck over and stop the bleeding and goddamned way you can. You use a napkin if you have to, but you don’t sit there and watch the person bleed out.
---
hes got the path, the instance isn't in game yet so fine to leave it out IMO
---
... it depends on your current rep lol
---
Reminds me of LevelUpLifting's Overwatch and MK videos. Great stuff.
---
It's gotten to the point where I just refuse to unlock any chest, and just leave it. There's so much drama associated with locked chests that I just don't care anymore. 
---
I personally thing as a rogue, I should be able to get the contents of the chest and decide if the item should be rolled or not. I spent around 10 hours grinding lockpicking during peak hours, so I treat it as a profession.
---
If you have any issues with that, then I just don't open the chest and leave it locked forever.
---
hey! as per the warcraft rpg lore, taurens reach sexual maturity at 15... or 50. don't ask.
---
Yeah ... No
---
Good to know for sure. Thanks. 6% is low. I'm already sitting at 8%. Got some bis decisions to make now haha.
---
hard as salt
---
In Classic nothing gets added to your action bars by default. You have to add the different spell ranks manually. In retail new stuff just gets added to your bars as soon as you learn it so this may be why it was confusing.
---
Where did they get that idea? Probably from interacting with them on private servers.
---

How to make bots work for YOU with just one easy step.

Yes.

The fulfillment I felt makes my loins tingle.
---
The irony.
---
It\`s more about luck with gear drops. One of them got lucky with perfect +hit slots and can now use more powerful equipment, and the other didn't. Maybe the first one got 2 debuff slots for corruption+CoA just because he\`s so cool or he is raidleader or something. Maybe he got pumped by innervates and didn't have to use his CDs on lifetap. Many things can be done if you aim for that top-1 spot in the all star list.
---
This comment right here, Paladin.
---
Very compelling arguments. I stand, defeated.
---
Greta is a puppet that doesn't even understand what she is fighting for. Anyone should feel bad for her being dragged around like this.
---
it was not in classic, it's a sad side-effect of running on a modern client
---
Nice job, hope Blizz hands out a ban.
---
I’ve played Warrior and Pally a good bit now.
---
Really appreciate the Speed at which I can pull in 5 mans as a warrior. Definitely the premier MT in any content. You’ve consistency down to the t and charge, intercept and range weapons are a god send
---
As a pally being able to heal or tank 5 mans feels good. And with blessing my tools actually positively affect everyone and often in unique ways. I don’t know if I’m playing the pally optimally when I bless myself with Light and the port tank with Sanctuary but it feels cool to do unique shit.
---
Gonna try to keep this short. When you are against racism (could be that you aren't but that's my interpretation from reading ur comment) then you can't simply blame the "WHITE" kids. Do you seriously believe that only white people can be racist? I am white but I still have an immigrant father, does that mean I can't be a victim of racism because of the colour of my skin? That seems like racism to me... ? This is quite offtopic of Wow Classic though and I believe there are better platforms to discuss these topics :p.
---
Not as clever as you think you are
---
&gt;This has been determined.
---
Literally latest IPCC reports report that projections made on July do not hold. You seem to be missing what inconclusive means.
---
&gt; Slippery slope arguments are dumb. 
---
Nice dodge, care to answer the question: where do you draw a line what measures are acceptable? Because my local political parties are suggesting stuff like tripling electricity tax and removing public transports from sparse rural areas. The effects of these policies would be devastating to economy of those areas and as such merits further study.
---
You seem to be making the argument that we know everything we need to know and that enforcing any policy is acceptable.
---
Being able to read off a paper is not the equivalent of understanding.
---
Again, you saying the question is dumb af is implying myself and anyone else with the question is dumb. The question is valid: people used to make detailed maps by just surveying the land and actually walking it. Is it not possible OP did the same, but virtually? OP even mentioned youtube tutorials on how to make fantasy maps. In my mind perhaps OP walked the whole thing and drew out the outlines then filled it in with the details of the in game map. Either way, the fact that myself and others posed the same question means that it is not in fact dumb af. Either that or you're just soooo much smarter than everyone else. Get off your high horse.
---
I rolled 98 on band of accuria from Ragnaros, and then someone else rolled 100 ;)
---
Getting a real strong poop sock vibe from that guild chat, you're better off finding another guild. Either this one implodes or just gets worse with that kind of mentality.

It's very apparent she's being used. But people agree with her, therefore it's okay!

Every tutorial emphasized how rivers don’t split, didn’t it?

I don't understand the mentality of passing on upgrades because they are not bis.

I reported 4 bots on my server since week 3 of wow. They are still farming, I don't think blizzard cares about that stuff.
---
Dire Maul came out literally a month after launch lol.
---
Mine sort of stopped, i turned on command to show what add ons had errors, turned them off, then went on to discord and turned off the over lay and the newest stream mode "disabled it", closed discord restarted my blizz client launched the game typed this in to chat and push enter /script SetCVar("rawMouseEnable", 1);
---
this is the command to show script error, then do a /reload
---
/console scriptErrors 1

I have a G500s mouse turned off my mouse memory featured to see my poll rate options and then turned that down also.

I believe you need to gather around 473 stacks. One stack for each and every human bringa time you've wasted. 
---
Hurry up though, you'll have to gather more if you let people read your question.
---
And you were right in more ways than you expected!
---
Lame.
---
The key is timing. Most pugs will happen on wed, sat, sun. The majority of them start around 19:00-21:00 server time.
---
You will want to look up to 3 hours before that to catch pugs forming. Just keep an eye on world/lfg for those times.
---
Other guy said he updated details and it started so I'm gonna guess details

Armory is typically the worst in terms of XP for grind groups. Library 32-38, carb 38-44.
---
Armory tends to be done by a group to get ravaged and that’s it. Try starting your own.
---
They do in theory -- and recently did a banwave of AH bots afaik.
---
Ah yes such a hero that Voldemort is
---
Your mistake was getting into a neckbeard argument.
---
Yeah man, I think the max weapons can roll is 33 healing. But different level ranges has set ranges, not a set value.
---
yoo wtf that was happening to me in BRD, I don't get it. I popped 2 vanishes and was sprinting away from mobs that are green for me and they just kept on me. Regular dwarves, not dogs
---
By your logic you should roll on ores and herbs because you are in the group so you use it for the fucking group.
---
Hmm. It's a bit difficult but I've had some good offers but I've been so busy I can't really commit to a good guild rn like I'd like to. 
---
Honestly it's just weeding through some stuff. I think the main Bloodsail discord is a good help and so are the forums. Going for a guild with some history isn't a bad thing. :)
---
its not the dogs, its the dwarves themselves. I've had it happen to me many times
---
This comment section is a shit show. Did someone brigade already or are wow players naturally this toxic and ignorant?
---
Practice makes perfect! I use macros that help for switching between sword/shield and 2hander
---
The best part is that if an NPC kills you, that adds to your repair bill. :)
---
I've used sprint and run away and they still follow you while vanished. specifically BRD mobs seem to be bad for this
---
looks like you're griefing some kid
---
Great map! You'd be set if you ever get into a DnD game :D
---
No one wants you here. Go play hello kitty island adventure.
---
I tried to get my fellow alliance to report him with me, but didnt get any traction sadly...
---
Hehe dragon prince :)
---
What you said about warlocks is not true at all. If played correctly u have veeery low downtime while leveling.
---
Destroyed a warlock two times today. If he can't get my pet Away fast enough he is death. But I guess on lvl 60 with way more life it's way harder
---
Calm down pedophile she isn't even of legal age
---
Found the hunter.
---
Herod alliance rogue - at first I left questing horde live and do their thing because I wanted to punish ganking horde. Now I stealth to avoid 3v1 fights. Even in cases where areas were not horde dominated i would run into multiboxers with twice as much kill threat so the 1v1 gank was not possible without griefing.
---
No rolls on taxation
---
Nah man... hes on a very defined loop and ran back to waypoints regularly to continue. not even kids play the way this guy did.
---
I don't know much about the situation. I don't really have a problem with giving the book to the tank or having everyone roll need for a boe. It should be discussed among the group and resolved there.
---
why didn't you sac vw after the first hit
---
I accept any tip for water, doesn’t matter how much they ask for or how much they give. I’ve also given it for nothing plenty of times. I just stick it in the trade window and hit accept. That being said, the cost of 100+ leve 45 water from a vendor far exceeds 1g

Everyone has their own style. 10-15 silver rarely worth the time. Sometimes you miss out on 1-3 gold. That means faster epic mount. You’ll get your time back that way.

I have a bank alt that loads up on stuff and I like once a week. Since mail has 30 days, sometimes I mail stuff back that I’ll want soon, but just have it rest there.
---
It's saying classic will have tourists and to solve that issue they were at the time considering using sharding, they changed sharding to layering and implemented that.
---
So now, the big question becomes: How would layering solve the issue of tourists if they weren't using them to increase server caps?
---
Nope. Avoid Classic til they fix it (but they won't since that costs money).
---
Vanilla and consequently Classic are _bad_ games. Bad. BAD.
---
Vanilla was shipped in a completely unfinished state, the Horde areas are so bad, so under-developed that the only saving grace is that if you enjoy really hard games, Classic might be for you. So little of the planned content is in the game, and the missing parts are what killed off vanilla. And Classic will suffer the same fate.
---
Not only is Honor not in the game, even tho it was released by 1.12 - neither Alterac Valley nor Warsong Gulch is anywhere to be found, and won't be released until the last few days of *April*, even tho the lag between the Honor System and BGs in vanilla was 8 weeks. There will be nobody playing Classic by then.
---
There are only (as of 1.13) 4 viable specs in the game - Fury War, MM Hunter, Combat Rogue, and Frost Mage (fortunately no class requires all best gear to do content as of now, but that all changes when BWL hits, which will mean vanilla will be the same ghost town vanilla was when BWL released).
---
These Classic devs have somehow managed to delude themselves into thinking that even tho vanilla was on life support by the time BWL showed up, that Classic will not suffer the same fate.
---
I'd go play another MMO if I were you.
---
If you think you'll have fun doing that why not? You can probably find SM groups fairly easily to level with
---
Shit like this happens thousands of times every day on servers.  It's just human behavior, it's also pretty tame.
---
I sure do like hangin our with other humans and talkin bout things like money and startin wars!
---
no, nelfdelphine
---
I disagree. According to what you said, he wants Atlas loot. According to him, he wants different gear sets for different situations, which is just a BIS list already made by other people. Not a great question.
---
Teleports 1g but don’t even tip on water I’m a mage and I never expect tips I mean if they do cool but if not big whoop
---
What is the difference between +Shadow Damage and +Damage and healing besides the obvious. Os there a reason to go for shadow damage over the other?
---
if only you were named  NelfDelphine
---
lol.. Wait until 60 when your tanks are getting smacked for 60% of their HP randomly and your Rogue is pulling aggro every other pull and popping Blood Fury.
---
I spent 6 hours of grinding from midnight to 6am to avoid peak times while I level my lock picking. During this time I pulled fiance aggro.. I did it all so I could open locked chests for my group. 
---
Then I come on reddit and read ignorant ass posts comparing lock picking to easily bought skills. Makes me not want to open chests anymore.
---
Yeah, and the AH spammed with the same 4 or 5 people spam selling them  for over 50g each. I see the same 3 or 4 bots there 24/7 since I first went to the zone
---
Spells and effects, so does it increase pot and bandage too? That would be a difference if it is so.
---
Asking the important questions xD
---
He was packing the fudge

---
It's a huge help to have when your dps doesn't know how to wait for you to get threat.
---
We had 12 hour queues now we have mostly no queues.  Why do you think that is?
---
Don't even have to respec, you can just heal it and start picking up heal items and it'll be fine
---
 Only the max level dungeons really require you being actual heal spec to heal them
---
Wait, what? How was this related to keeping everyone topped of in dungeons? Argument was that it is usually not needed to top off.
---
Also, can you drink mid combat by macro or what do you mean by drink same game tick mid combat?
---
&gt; They're too dumb
---
They're playing classic for the end game, of course they're dumb.
---
Great name
---
I for one didnt realise it was 99% identical, i don't have the map memorised and didn't cross reference it with the in game map. Having said that, I thought that perhaps OP found some tutorials on how to create maps by walking the zones, which i would have thought to be extremely cool. I didnt wonder or expect that he drew it from memory, was just curious as to his actual process which i felt the question posed was relevant to.
---
I thought I wanted classic but I don't... not because the game doesn't hold up. The game is amazing. But modern gaming culture is so toxic and full of elitist assholes.
---
I honestly don’t know where to come down on the climate thing because there’s plenty of evidence on both sides from people who are far, far smarter than I am and it’s a very advanced topic.
---
I do, however, know which side is trying to shut down any and all discussion and belittle and shame people who think differently.
---
I also know which side is displaying clear synptoms of dunning-kruger.
---
Unfortunately human pieces of shit can still be right sometimes, so that does nothing to inform any viewpoint.
---
Yes it was, the link is taking me there? Weird. Definitely seems like we have conflicting info from blizzard about layering
---
I know stuff gets BIS status due to some spreadsheet calculation, but honestly, the technical "BIS" items are NOT that much better than a lot of other options and the difference isn't going to make or break you.
---
There is absolutely nothing wrong on rolling for stuff that is a huge upgrade even if it's not "the best."  The silver lining in this situation is now you know who to avoid in the future.
---
Undead of classic are the Night Elves of vanilla.
---
VeadCines?
---
A lot of tourists have left?
---
Yes, FBI? This comment right here.
---
Honestly, both is rather disturbing... but if pussy is the only thing that counts, why even differentiate?
---
Atleast the female head could consent, so i have to go with lower half horse upper half human.

warcraft logs are pretty scuffed tbh i dont get why people quote them so much... boss dps is affected a lot by mechanic rng. Also if your raid is more geared on average, the fights will go faster; meaning cooldown classes will get a significant dps boost and classes like warlock and mage that need tap and evocate will not have to waste time with non-dps spells
---
I do not simply blame white kids for racism. Nor do I assume only whites can be racist. I am against racism so you are right about that.
---
I wasn't blaming these white kids for all of racism. I'm just assuming the racist comments cam from bored white kids because bored young people are those most likely to say edgy things to get attention and because whites tend to be the most ignorant about racism. Minorities generally don't have the privilege of ignoring racism.
---
Trol racial alone is moves your hitcap from 9% to 6%. The +2 from Marksman Bands would only give you 0.2% hit.
---
I’d imagine it’s been brigaded. So many people are terrified that a 16 year old is speaking up about a very real threat to our world. And because they lack her zeal, they just go into every forum they can and rant about her.
---
Yeah i guess i didn’t think this through...
---
you killed an equal level enemy and thought it was worthy of posting on reddit?
---
Thanks, kindly.
---
Then later its just the tribute chest, and later its just the domo chest.
---
Better luck next time, friend! =)
---
He’d be ignored and blacklisted from any group/raid  I ever healed forever.  I’d drop grp before he received a single heal from me :)
---
So true, and should you get a nightfall proc from a corruption tick WHILE you're almost done casting a juicy Soul Fire... Ohhh Lawdyyyy!
---
Not magic, just science and engineering

So why are you confused?  We had massive queues tourists are leaving queues are coming down.

“No need to RP” don’t roll an RP server then.

And he can share it if he wants because it’s fun, fuck off.
---
As a 42 rogue who just pickpocketed his way to a mount through SM, can confirm Vanish is NOT 100% effective. I put in a bug report every time it happened
---
Rogue: sap and tickle .. Best done when they are low health right after fighting mobs.
---
He's basically agreeing with you. Even in a quest group you'd still have to stop clearing to go back and turn in immediately - it's just a lot more likely people will be okay with it
---
I feel like I’m the weirdo since I hate one bag addons. I like manually sorting my bags so I know exactly where to look for my items. Last bag has trade skill tools, hearth, and food. 4 has quest items and alternate trinkets, weapons. 3 has overflow quest items, pots and ah bound items, 2 and backpack have are trash and overflow ah/tradeskill mats. 
---
Spent about a week with bagnon on. Hated every bit of it. I wouldn’t mind a bag add on that still kept bags separate and changed the skin to run inline with the various UI addons.
---
Welcome to playing an MMO for 300 hours within a month of release. Take a break or play an alt.
---
Nah, flame stiking/blizzarding the two mobs.
---
Gamer Rise up in this thread for sure. 
---
A lot of far right people who seem to get off denying climate change hang around Reddit. 
---
The post is fine, people just happen to feel real strongly about a teenage girl (which is on par with reddit men's normal creepyness ofc)
---
Honestly it’s sad and I pity her. Just adults using her for their own political gain I hope she gets the help she needs after this shit storm
---
Wolfshead helm is permabis for feral druids, which is kinda nice cause it's a cheap leatherworking lvl 40 blue. So I wouldn't try for hit on a helm.
---
Also if you really wanna tryhard then manual crowd pummeler is important so you'd rather find hit outside your weapon I think.
---
Belle Delphine has nothing on my Essential Night Elf Oils. It's made from only the purest Moonwell waters.
---
I'm not confused, but please answer my question, what's the point in layering if it doesn't increase server populations?
---
Wow, what a piece of shit. Add him to every blacklist you can find
---
Halloween event! You can trick or treat once per hour and my inventory was full when I did it so all I got was an hour to wait until I can do it again 😮
---
What stats should a lock focus primarily from Stamina, int and spirit? Im lvl 49, always ignored spirit and went for the other two
---
What an asshole
---
&gt;And I would be willing to bet that there are a lot more age 25-40 males living in their parent’s basement in 2019
---
Jokes on you, we don't have a basement!
---
/s
---
no, this is just to farm any items you want off the first boss as most classes assumed that only ice block mages could do it.... till now.
---
lol touche
---
Well the unwriten rule is no pots in a duel, Thats what I know! Sure everbody could use it, but when everyone does a wrong it doesnt make it right.
---
I only have the info in the video and the research and data cited by it. I see what you mean and you make a valid point about it raising the amount of crit you want to get on your character sheet. I guess it's a matter of semantics, since we're thinking of the same thing in two different ways.
---
People don't realize that the single most important item in the game is time.  Always be respectful of other's time, it's a small server and they will remember.
---
Absolutely, it can be very frustrating, and maybe im just a lucky sob but i havnt had any of those dreadful types so far, atleast none so uncooperative that they be reasoned with by saying i can allow them to do even more dmg if they give me a little time.
---
Only if for some reason you don't replenish the one or two soul stones you used during the run... During the run, I guess..
---
Join another guild\*
---
If you are in contact with that guy you could ask him if he would recontact that GM. 
---
I don't want to be wrong obviously but what I really want is to know what is going on. 
---
Fucking Blizzard fucked up this launch so badly.
---
so many unfriendly players on Shazzarah-EU its sad
---
Mobs can parry from behind.
---
The earth shocking, rock biter using shamans make it really tough. 😂
---
&gt; I honestly don’t know where to come down on the climate thing because there’s plenty of evidence on both sides from people who are far, far smarter than I am and it’s a very advanced topic.
---
Ehh... some might disagree about the exact degree of the problem and consequences, or how to best address them, but I think there's at least a 99% consensus among actual smart people doing research that climate change is happening quickly, potentially catastrophic, and caused by humans.
---
That doesnt make it better, since this char doesnt made them. Like he said unwriten rules etc. :)
---
It's a tough sell, because the materials for the item it makes are so expensive. I don't know about the pattern, but there was one of the bags in the AH on my server last night for 500g. I can't imagine anyone is willing to pay that right now for a bag, but 12 mooncloth forces the price to be pretty high. You might have a hard time finding someone to buy the pattern simply because the bags are so hard to sell.
---
I pay mages who port me at end of group, every time.
---
Warlocks are a little different, and it depends on the context, but I have paid them for summons as well.
---
Sounds familiar. I had a handful of 60's in vanilla.
---
PVP game.
---
&gt; Well let’s try the 2$ first and see how it goes 
---
I would be all for that. Not what the politics want though, extremists vs extremists. There are no moderates.
---
They have, they're just tiny
---
Sounds kinda like a joke.
---
wat? is it that hard to understand mass human extinction and why that is bad for you?
---
How on earth to you come to that conclusion? Lockpicking is NOT a profession, rogues can choice herbing, mining or whatever aswell, if they think getting that mine form a dungeon is so awesome. Noone else can choose lockpicking, just like noone else can choose portals, summoning, healthstones and so on..
---
That is class specific things, if your class gets picked for a group, you use those fucking benefits for the group, otherwise you are just an idiot. People dont chose a "miner" or a "herber" for the group, they chose a rogue, a mage, a lock or whatever, so you do what the hell your class does for that group.
---
I really really dont see how you guys can be so dense, that you actually dont realize that a Mage and a lock has ABSOLUTLY NO reason to waste money on learning portals, summons and so on for themselves, it is 100% for the others. Locks spend time farming shards to help the group, mages use money to make portals, rogues a not special because they spend time leveling lockpick. It is absolutly stupid and entitled to think the way you do.
---
Yeah Winterspring is absolutely gorgeous
---
Redditors have notoriously shit reading comprehension. You explained in your post that you passed on it for a melee but would take if nobody else needs it. 2 people then respond explaining to you why it's better for melee then hunters...
---
/facepalm
---
Just ignore the morons and keep doing you. You sound like a good hunter to me.
---
Unironically an aesthetic picture
---
I'm a rogue and my friend is a feral druid. What would be a good druid build for tanking 5 mans and ganking people in world pvp?
---
I don't *expect* portals from mages, so I'm confused what that has to do with anything.
---
Warlocks are generally perfectly capable of farming the soulshards they use at the start of an instance during the instance. I will pay warlocks for their services in some contexts, but generally a summon is saving them as much time as it is me.
---
1 every 30 min for a SS, 1-10 throughout the run for health stones, 1-3 for summons, 1 every 30 min for minions during the run. So for a 1 h 30 min dungeon I need like 10-20
---
This one is ugly too
---
Agreed. I’m a tank anyway, but regardless. I’m a casual, and will not have time for full raids. T1, 2 and 3 are out of my reach. My entire end game goal is to build and upgrade T.5. If someone yelled at me for wanting it over a shard he can stick that shard in a happy place. OP was absolutely fine wanting the piece of a warrior set he didn’t have, regardless of its status as an upgrade or BiS.
---
I only swapped from valor chest because I got dm n chest. I still have it in my bank though.
---
Glimmering mithril insignia is worth it for some people to pick it up, but most drop it after making the item.
---
when you hit 60 you basically need things that are upgrades as you wait for BIS to drop. 
---
the guy is a retard
---
My whole point is both factions treat each other the same. I dont know how to say it more clearly. Horde are dicks to alliance. Alliance are dicks to horde. Horde spends days camping redridge. Alliance spends days camping stonetalon. Horde has a meme to kill gnomes on sight because they are ugly. Alliance has a meme to kill undead on sight because "they are probably dicks in real life".  Alliance puts a raid group at the DM entrance at launch to farm horde. Horde does the same thing.
---
I personally like horde better because they gank because wpvp is fun. I dont like the self righteous attitude some alliance players have where you gank because "preemptive revenge" or "he plays an undead rogue you know he deserves it". At the end of the day both sides are just ganking low level players. At least horde tends to be more real about it.
---
pvp is supposed to be against other faction not your own.
---
ohh yes that makes sense
---
That’s sounds miserable to farm every week
---
.no-ip.biz
---
It's my fault , I read nonhumanoid/orc as literally nonhumanoid/orc thinking you actually meant orc.
---
I bought edgemasters as an orc but that's ok it will serve me well if I tank with anything other than an axe.
---
You mean the character I am playing, in another window, at the very moment I am replying to your illiterate post?
---
Storm winds been sitting there past 15 years.
---
So?
---
Says who?
---
Have you ever read barrens chat?  I fully expected this to turn into a MAGAt rally.
---
Hunter - it just feels like theres always room for improvement and thinking outside of the box in wpvp against multiple enemies. Lots of different ways to go about the class. Just fun.
---
Not everyone pvps
---
Except I'm not a mage and that is also not how that works. But impressive you took the time to post bad math.
---
You should probably learn what logical fallacies mean before you try to use them.
---
Literally every other profession gets to benefit from their crafts in a duel, no reason an alchemist can't use their potions.
---
Flavor of the decade, really.
---
so many casters wear +dmg/healing greens it's actually fucking funny.
---
it's fine though, i won't mind farming scrubs with barely 2k hp once honor ranks come out.
---
Druid goes feral until he has 5 points in heart of the wild (maybe get Furor from the resto tree earlier, but wait until after feral swiftness if he wants that). Focus on talents that help both cat and bear form (which is most of them). He'll be fine for tanking while leveling, just make sure to get the charge skill and the faerie fire (feral) talent when they become available. 
---
Once he has 5/5 hotw, he can consider speccing into the resto tree as well to help with dungeon healing (which, as long as he keeps some caster gear in his bag, he can heal dungeons while leveling as feral too, should you happen to need it). Alternatively, there are some good pvp talents early in the balance tree (nature's grasp).
---
Ah, fair, I did forget about healthstones, but I usually don't ask for them for this very reason. I use my own pots.
---
I carry my own water for/pay mages who give me an attitude about water, too. Meh.
---
server wouldn't even work half the time, most just ran a shitty 2006 client and you would get 99 skills in like 10 minutes.
---
I already answered that question.
---
Drinking pots in a duel..... You lost
---
In Classic?
---
&gt;Gender is a self imposed identity, not backed by anything other than a persons feelings, which is valid and okay.
---
There’s evidence that there’s more to it than feelings. Brain scans of transgender individuals have revealed that they tend to have a brain physiology you would expect to find in the body of the gender that they identify as. 
---
Tl:dr, transgender females often feel female because they literally have a female’s brain, for example
---
Warriors can use weapon except for wands.
---
&gt;ack, but sell
---
like on my server thats why i asked.
---
sold it now
---
Watch out, keyboard warrior thinks an underage girl is ugly
---
He couldn't roll because he already had the gem is all I can think of if it wasn't his first run.  In which case he got paid to pass on something that he could never roll on anyways and should have told the guy that instead of taking his gold.  That's why the other guy got mad, should have just given the gold back if it was a mistake and he didn't know he had that gem already.
---
!Remind Me 10 hours
---
Did you only play the first month of vanilla? Because the change from DM to VC happened pretty quickly but apparently there needs to be an actual debate about something so simple
---
I'm on Ally but I guess I shouldn't be surprised since our servers world chat is often filled with similar bullshit. Although it's kinda died down now, I figure a lot of the edgy kids gave up or got ostracized. Like we had one guy who kept going so full blown white supremacist in the chat that he got kicked out of every major guild at one point or another and had to switch servers.
---
Private industry causes climate change and spends millions on propaganda that climate change is fake.
---
I found it weird how nobody cares about those. If I could get edgemasters without paying for them I would take it
---
The climate alarmists are getting really hyperbolic. "Mass human extinction?" Really? Not saying climate change isn't real but jeez man get a grip
---
Or you didn't just play during vanilla...
---
She looks like she got dropped on her face lol
---
Our house is on fire. It dosent matter if the living room or kitchen is 800 degrees or 900 degrees. There is no doubt that the house is on fire
---
...or you could just grind them untill they all ded
---
No dude don't you get it? There can never be enough low effort screen shot roll posts. It's high quality content you just don't understand and are being a big old meanie. Don't you the HUMOR. LOL DUDE LIGHTEN UP DUDE THIS IS SO FUNNY.
---
r/classicwowcirclejerk
---
Just remember that as you are kicking party members for not doing enough DPS. I literally had to explain to a group I ran an instance with (as a warlock), why you didn't want my DPS to be any higher. They laughed and kicked me... Idiots.  
---
The mage in the group was doing top DPS (obviously), but was continuously pulling off the tank.
---
Sure, but he was, according to WoW (Strath Undead chapel, specifically) the first Paladin of the Silver Hand, so he is a prime source for what a Paladin should and should not be.
---
If you change your loot system you cant really complain about anyone leaving. Some people dislike certain systems.
---
Hmm yeah, clean air and water is so hard to understand isn't it
---
If it’s a low level player (under 40) all I expect is 20s for the mats for a portal, 60s pay 1g. Water I don’t expect anything, I’d rather be tipped 0 than under 25s.
---
The fact that you believe she built her own boat as if she's Noah really pushes home how ill-informed you are.
---
That was super subtle, I didn't even notice it.
---
If you already had that gem and that is why you couldn't roll.... yes you are the A.  Should have given his gold back as you were never in contention for it with him, simple misunderstanding but once you keep the golf you become the A.
---
&gt; Literally latest IPCC reports report that projections made on July do not hold. You seem to be missing what inconclusive means.
---
projections needing to be realigned do not change the larger point at all. They are trying to be MORE accurate and you are using that as evidence to throw it all out entirely. 
---
you don't understand how science works. good lord
---
&gt; You seem to be making the argument that we know everything
---
You seem to not understand what my argument is since you think that. Good lord you are the definition of arguing in bad faith.
---
Youre done. Bye
---
Griefing your own faction is bankable dipshit
---
So say I have a lvl 40 and a lvl 60 in Cath. there is a huge xp penalty. Will 3 more 40s improve or lessen the xp or no change?
---
Shitpost only the top quality for reddit.
---
I had low expectations, but I'm glad I watched that
---
So, to clarify here: neither Greta nor her mother claimed to be able to "see" CO2 in the air. It was a mistranslation from a german newspaper.
---
We've had weeks, and months, of doing very little moderation in the past. Back when we had few mods other than myself, SoupaSoka, iDylo, and Spearmints, we would regularly be caught by rushes of traffic when we were simply too busy with more important commitments to deal with the Subreddit. 
---
It was noticeable, there were numerous complaints. There is a reason we've taken on innumerous mods over the past few years, it has typically always been in response to users directly complaining about a drop in content quality. 
---
Those complaints are the reason we have the rules we do, they've all been directly influenced by the community, through direct feedback, indirect feedback, and polls.
---
Just upvoted it back to 69.
---
There's also this frustrating trend I've noticed where people try to hide their ignorant or bigoted views by pretending to care about how "genuine" the message is. Like people wont attack her arguments but have issues with her by calling her a "puppet" because according to them it's better to do nothing than to do something but have it potentially be construed as being disingenuous.
---
Lol, y'all are salty as fuck.
---
Grow up
---
You may not wanna MT with it though. In Ony our MT had 6 piece Valor on. I have Savage, HoJ, brigam, edgemasters. I was catching him in aggro all the time just by auto attacking. 2 times I basically got aggro when his dropped for some reason. I had to stop aaing for several minutes to let his threat build up
---
Yet u still took ur time to look at my illiterate post? for what? a moment of trolling saying people r bad to make urself feel better?
---
man, u r pathetic
---
&gt; Maybe all the horde that complain about not having enough alliance to kill should roll alliance ?
---
If they made not-boring races/made races not matter for faction allegiance, then sure.
---
I've used that macro since it's been posted, it's been great.
---
Wow. You kinda deserve it
---
lol did you accidentally comment your password?
---
Put your graphics on classic you coward.
---
Oh look, its doubling down. How embarrassing
---
Gnome!
---
Only specific things are bannable not just anything you decide is griefing.  I didn't watch the vid tho so idk what he did
---
I always wondered why Horde hate Gnomes so much, now I understand, they are what Undead are to the Alliance. The fucking damn annoying rogue who gank you out of nowhere and keep breaking you leveling flow.
---
If I use the item restoration, it should be able to remove the:
---
"Crafted By:"
---
Text right?
---
it's a tranny lol
---
Normally I don't like all these screenshots of the same thing. But I just can't get enough of these :D
---
God damn! I thought I had hidden my race very well!
---
You toxic savage. Lol
---
What’s the math on this? 1% chance to roll a 98 and another 2% chance that someone could beat you?
---
Just keep at it, it will happen, you will get it.
---
Call him Rain Wilson
---
Spell power/shadow damage &gt;&gt;&gt; stam &gt; spirit &gt;&gt;&gt; int
---
She is in most of the world... but that's besides the point. Adults calling a teen ugly as of that discredits are beyond pathetic.
---
Wait you aren't lebronjamez are you? I remember seeing someone named lebronjames on 2 private servers and he would host MC pugs, and I actually ran one with him. I'm just wondering cuz of ur name.
---
I quit retail in the beginning of Cataclysm, I tried it again when two expansions ago, and just couldn't get into it.  I'm enjoying my time in classic wow, and could give two craps about retail.
---
Maybe the dumb ones do. It happened multiple times in Scarlet Monestary.
---
I've yet to see any ostracization.  There's just too many of them.  I've never really seen reputation punishments in wow.  If anything the targets of their harassment and bullshit are the ones that go quiet, quit guilds, or quit wow.   
---
You have to go really fishing to find guilds that won't put up with the bullshit because they don't tend to advertise on wow.  They use offsite software to vet and recruit members.
---
hE nInJaD mUh GrEeNs
---
I think a lot of the advice here is good. Raid on your mage and make an alt for fun. Or play another game while you wait for raids. Imo once new raids come out that part gets more fun. You definitly run outta things to do other than farm more gold.
---
It's the obvious.  It's just different itemization.  Shadow damage might as well say warlock/shadow priest only, +damage only tells healers to keep off, and +damage and healing is a caster free-for-all.
---
If you're interested in doing shadow damage, there is no actual difference when you equip the item.  The only thing to be aware of here is your spells that that aren't Shadow dmg when it's +shadow only.
---
Take a deep frost PvP spec w/ imp cs and remove the points in frostbite and put them in imp blizzard. You can do decent in everything with that.
---
I'm only here for classic... Stopped playing retail a few expansions ago
---
Well I was just quoting you. Besides anyone can be a blacksmith/engineer and unlock those chests.
---
It's a quick road to turning duels into who can throw away more gold per hour. Health pots are cheap, but then you bring LIPs, flasks etc etc and it can completely tilt the tides and make it a battle of wallets instead of skill (or whatever it implies with shitty classic balancing).
---
While leveling? Sure why not, they dot one mob and then lifetap into bandage. However, when a warlock dies in pvp, the amount of time it takes for him to get to full power again is hilarious. Summoning a demon, demon armor, spellstone, healthstone, healthstone for your friend, and don't even get me started on farming soul shards. Maybe you should reread my post because I never said that warlocks have more downtime than mages while leveling, because they certainly don't. (Unless you want to get into the whole aoe farming thing and then this entire argument gets flipped on its head. Which is why I said it was SITUATIONAL.)
---
Btw, the abbreviation of "approximately" is "approx.", not "app."
---
What’s with all the demo shout and tclap? Lmao
---
pretty sure I won and got 1 gold :)
---
Mage "lol no, wisdom please"
---
Me: "lol no, you get what you're given unless you want to tank"
---
These are incredibly well put together, thank you for taking the time to make them!
---
Only relevant reason here is that the item budgets usually allow more for a singular school. So two items of similar level could roll +10 shadow or +7 spell, for example.
---
Have you raided molten core? Please name one ability or boss mechanic that should be killing this fury warrior because he doesn't have stam on his shoulders..
---
Sorry, you can't!
---
Im think there's just a big overlap between wow gamers and basement dwellers.
---
Congrats! One hell of a grind.
---
Epic mount.
---
That was the best part! I killed my own, and he killed a bunch for me, increasing my leather farm significantly!
---
Some people just do these kind of games for fun you know..
---
&gt; we need to know if that suffering is really necessary.
---
I'm glad you would rather see future generations suffer and see the world end rather than be a little uncomfortable.
---
There are some toxic players in classic as well, but overall I would say the experience is great and most people are nice.
---
Best tip is to talk to people you meet, especially in dungeons. People become much more agreeable once you've exchanged a few words.
---
"I need an adult", *you are one* -2019
---
Youd go for +shadow damage because the values will typically be higher than healing/spell damage value. Most of your DoTs are shadow dmg as well as drain life. So where armor with +healing/spell dmg value might be +21 one with pure shadow dmg might be +34.
---
Caer Darrow and Scholomance. It's like an evil Hogwarts.
---
I make all of my own pots and flasks, and I made gold from the duel...so I made money and won against a mage who could have used a health pot or better yet used frost bolt and kited me to death
---
Maybe people just don't enjoy Redditors pushing politics onto their favorite video game.
---
Maybe
---
Assuming growl, claw, and bite are must haves, you'll have to choose between prowl and dash.
---
I’m curious if you’re considering deleting an item and getting it restored just to get rid of that text.
---
One of the big weaknesses of a Paladin in no range attacks.
---
But if you learn Mining and Engineering, you can make dynamite and throw it at the enemy ...
---
ive done it with shred a few times. its doable, but its a lot harder because the servers are quite nice (at least compared to the private servers that allowed it to become popular)
---
Ya i agree, I since the same could be argued about literally every profession by your dumbass "at 60" logic. And you can make any class seem hard by cherry picking the most absolutely asinine thing possible
---
Nah thats some hardcore slipper slope falacy stuff though. There is no way to compare a domo chest to uldaman chest, and no way to say that somehow this would become omay because of an ulda chest. Its a ulda chest with 3g max of items get over yourselves reddit isnt meant to be a support group. Report it to blizzard if it bothers you.
---
3 more lvl 40’s will make you share the xp among them as well, so it would be less xp for you.
---
I DONT HATE ANY PARTICULAR CLASS. I JUST HATE UNDEAD. EXCEPT FOR THAT ONE UNDEAD MAGE THAT WAS IN THE YETI CAVE. HE WAS COOL AMD SHARED MOBS WITH ME, AND EVEN HELPED ME KILL ADDS THAT WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE KILLED ME. SHOUTOUT TO YOU BRO. IT WAS LIKE 20 LEVELS AGO AND I FORGOT YOUR NAME BUT YOU ARE COOL AND I WILL CHERISH THAT BONDING MOMENT FOREVER.
---
BUT FUCK UNDEAD MAGES OTHERWISE.
---
Look at you getting offended by an opinion.
---
A 40k Player?

https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/21/Appeal-to-Authority
---
here ya go buddy
---
Sure it sucks but its an ulda chest, get over it. Better yet report it to blizz. This isnt the place to witchhunt or post your gripes about petty things like a chest in a 40 dungeon.
---
Honestly, unless you absolutely love your guild, start looking elsewhere. Usually World and Trade both have plenty recruiting. There is always looking around discord too. PUG groups tend to be very much dependent on day and time. Later in the week, you’ll See more with people who got waitlisted or just never did it looking to cram it in prior to resets. Anytime between 5-10 
---
(More like 6-9 prob) ST is usually best.
---
I agree with you, but we're not going to drop a mod over a single incident. Hopefully it won't be repeated, but when you're trying to clear a queue of 110 messages, many of which are rude or insulting (when you are giving your own free time for to try and provide a positive, useful, entertaining resource for the community of a game that you love), it is not unreasonable to sometimes not care to give an in-depth answer or elongate your message with pleasantries. 
---
Of course, that's not what we should, what we should do is step back and leave the queue for whoever next takes a crack at it, but we don't always do what we should do.
---
Lol "only 4 viable specs" :D
---
Yeah, the game is unbalanced af, but it's not like you need optimal groups/raids to do the content... I would say most specs are viable, though not optimal :)
---
On most servers there is a private world chat that everyone can use. Its usually crated by someone
---
Mount no question. You just do literally everything faster which means accelerated gold.
---
Yeah that's what I said, sorry if I wasn't clear enough lol
---
Any mana using melee like Ret paladins or shamans in your melee group?
---
[If only you were right](https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/42673)...

&gt;Behavior that intentionally detracts from others' enjoyment (**such as griefing, throwing, feeding, etc.) is unacceptable**. We expect our players to treat each other with respect and promote an enjoyable environment. **Acceptable behavior is determined by player reports** and Blizzard's decision, and violating these guidelines will result in account and gameplay restrictions.
---
Do you enjoy the RP server? I made a level 1 alt on there and was wondering if it was any fun
---
This is really cool!!!
---
Used to play quite a bit before my son was born
---
I was looking at these and stockade shoulders and I decided neither was big enough upgrade to justify so now I’m waiting for that epic ring to fall into my price range.
---
Zandalar tribe is totally fine! Horde or alliance lol
---
Move on and stop farming it , there are other trinkets
---
Yeah I’m not asking for a witch-hunt so don’t say that. It doesn’t matter if you think the chest is worth it or not it’s still bad manners at the end of the day. Principle matters.
---
You bunch sure seem to enjoy yourselves,  I think this pretty awesome.
---
Lol wait till you l can’t fit through the doorway on your mount
---
I did this still nothing. I do have a pc but i use my MacBook at times to play at work ect.. I’m so use to being able to hit 1-10 on the side of my mouse and shift 1-10 as well. If anyone can help please i would really appreciate it. I did the command and i get an error i also downloaded razor synapse
---
&gt;  Will 3 more 40s improve or lessen the xp or no change?
---
No change.  
---
If for one person in party mobs are grey - everybody else will get ~5% exp.
---
\*Sips\* Climate Change? Yeah, I just bought a new AC unit, chills my house great!
---
Lol you did scam him. You should have just said nothing. If you have the item already you can't roll so you tolk 20g even though you would autopass by default.
---
But the dark side has cookies!
---
no there are no alternative trinkets for fury warriors that are viable
---
That's really interesting actually, I wasn't aware of that. It makes sense though, considering the vast majority of transgender people suffer from extreme dysphoria. It's an unfortunate thing to be born with, and I hope people start to better understand what makes others need to transition. It takes a lot to live in a body you know you don't belong in, but it takes even more courage to change yourself for the better and take the steps to a more comfortable and fulfilling life.
---
I am, but a little nervous too so I wanted to ask if someone already did this before and can confirm.
---
I mean, strictly speaking, multi**box**ers use multiple computers.  But I guess the majority of software-assisted multiboxing is just done on a single machine these days.
---
Nah Rogues and Warriors can use ranged weapons in Classic, however they're limited to auto attacks only
---
It doesnt matter what class. It comes down to excluding an entire class or just excluding people who want the reserved item
---
I like how you bold stuff that isn't even about wow lol...  Oh man better not throw or feed in wow..  then you leave out "and blizzards decision"
---
You don't decide what griefing is blizzard does.  Someone being mad doesn't mean it griefing
---
I've been saying this for months but nobody listens. They argue this shit to the death for some reason I dont understand why.
---
I don’t think that’s true. This week I’ve been trying to get the arena chest but there’s been a gnome guild of all 60s camping the spawn the entire time. Every now and then a horde 60 shows up trying to go for it but they stand no chance against ~10 lvl 60 gnomes. They’ve had free rein there for a while now. 
---
I know this isn’t indicative of the entire server btw, just saying that that guild is making some strong twinks atleast. While horde doesn’t seem to care
---
Wash yer back
---
There is no evidence for corruption of felwood being a demon-made phenomenon, fel corruption has occurred before and is part of Azeroth's natural cycle. In fact, an Archimonde institute funded study recently showed that the corruption around Timbermaw Hold is actually receeding. Even if it were true, fel corruption is actually a good thing, it's better for important consumables like whipper root tuber.
---
Holy Shock is really only useful for PvP. It's too weak to use offensively and too inefficient to use as a heal. If you're going prot just commit fully to it and get Holy Shield. You can still get 20 points in Holy to pick up Illumination and be able to heal in  raids since you probably won't be tanking them.
---
No haha. James is my middle name and I have a superiority complex.
---
Which ? I’m on skeram
---
That completely ignores gear getting better, warriors scaling with gear, and is total ignorance.
---
How much DPS Do you think naxx players would do in MC? like 5k?
---
Yoooo thank you!! You’re the best!
---
First problem I see here is that someone is master looting UBRS...
---
Thank you but I actually just joined one. However doesn’t mean I’m not available to heal you once I get a few more levels!
---
There's always going to be toxic people but - I think due to an overwhelming percentage of people playing Classic having returned just for nostalgia - no one is taking any shit from the few trying to ruin the majority's fun.
---
I haven't run into a single person yet that was a dick about me asking questions and, as someone else said, [WoW Head](https://classic.wowhead.com/) is your friend.  Don't try to absorb all of it at once, but keep it handy as you progress.
---
Add-ons:
---
There's all sorts of things you can use to modify your game-play.  Things like Questie will mark where quests are on your map, Auctioneer scans the in-game marketplace and gives you real-time prices, there several that let you customize your layout (I'm a fan of Titan Panel and Spartan UI,) just to name a few.  What's awesome is that add-ons can all now be managed in Twitch.
---
[This is my current layout](https://i.imgur.com/F3X7Qam.jpg) managed with Spartan UI.  Please ignore the shitty crop job.
---
Always one
---
It's nice 'cause there's fewer systems you need to learn than in modern mmos. On the other hand, after the first couple of zones there's very little guidance from the game itself on where to go. Luckily, wowhead + addons has all the info you need, and of course you can ask people in the game or on this subreddit.
---
It's a slower game than most modern games too... Personally I enjoy that, but it's not for everybody. Try it for a month and see if you like it :)
---
The real great thing is that the subscription for classic and retail is shared, so you can try both and see what you like best.
---
80% is normal aggro for DPS.  
---
I even changed thresholds in my addon from 80% to 95% for raiding)
---
Given that this is vanilla id say you are doing yourself a bigger disservice by trying to make a jack of all trades build but you are also a mage so its probably possible. 
---
   What I dont get is why not stay aoe build and grind in the open world, pve in raids with aoe spec because in reality its just mc and ony so its not anything difficult. Then when phase 2 and 3 roll out you can be pvp spec during that time. 
---
    This would mean youve stocked up on and resources in the previous phase and can now do w.e in the next 2 phases because you planned properly and didnt spread yourself thin. 
---
Food for thought.
---
The propaganda has reached its full success in you.
---
Great belt for pally healers, don't want your heals to miss.
---

---
Only Horde spies call it VC !

---
And I think its bad manners to break this subreddits rules
---
Ya I'm aware it's just not worth my time personally.
---
Hahaha please look at mythic azshara, then compare it with anything in classic. Then try to argue that classic is easy because of it being known for 15 years.
---

---
Just literally follow word-by-word and you will get 60 in no time.
---
Not really for warriors
---
Look at you not realizing an opinion can be shitty
---
Scientific facts aren't propaganda.
---
can you repost that macro please? :D
---
Principle matters. Bro gl, you better find a guild and only so runs in that guild cuz ima tell you that principle does not matter in this game to 90% of people, and it was like that before and now. Gl
---
Yeah this post doesn’t violate that rule. Bro.
---
Look at the prices at you will find out.
---
You aren't the only one who doesnt have one. Why is this your argument?
---
Cringe
---
Didn’t break any rules
---
Back in the day we just called it WoW
---
Shaman - totems allow me to really be a support class. Theres a different totem combination for just about every situation you can find yourself in. Healing is really fun and the limited damage I can do questing is even offset by that.
---
want me to call the wambulance for you?
---
Suggested solutions aren't scientific facts.
---
Thanks have had luck in 95% of my runs and interactions so far
---
For some farm you want two things.
---
Int and sta.
---
You posted this to show us 2 low rolls, or am I missing something
---
&gt; If you act like an asshole in Classic, you'll find yourself unable to form groups with anyone except other outcast assholes.
---
Or I could be in a guild and still get groups no matter how big of an asshole I am to pugs.  
---
RFD is unfortunately kinda forgotten about unless you are a rogue or warrior looking to get their weapon upgrade. It's a mix between the gear available and the placement of the dungeon .. whereas SM is near a capital, and there's like 4 dungeons in one place.
---
Bars all the way
---
Nice ill try that. I had a cheap Logitech mouse ($30 or so). Switched to that and 0 problems by super awesome wireless Logitech g900 something still has the problem.
---
i’ll pay 2g for a port if out in the wild at MOST. 50s minimum and water is as mentioned
---
No shit, they're ways to deal with what we know is coming from scientific facts.
---
&gt; I like how you bold stuff that isn't even about wow lol
---
It literally shows at the top which games it applies to. (It's all of them btw)
---
What are you talking about against the spirit of classic? This sort of thing was always extremely common when competing for mobs back in vanilla.
---
Wow he used the ressources he had.
---
Can you believe he used charge ? Omg
---
Look at you thinking your opinion of my opinion will have any effect on me or my opinion
---
Yes there are, plenty of trinkets are viable.  They just aren't your prebis, that doesn't make them not viable.
---
god damn horde
---
Lol anything goes in a duel, is he not supposed to use some spells as well ?
---
&gt; Deadmines is also DM
---
But where did that capital letter M come from?
---
Your own spells, agreed, but the pets spells have done so so far. Even when resetting the pets abilities. But growl for some reason didn't
---
&gt;You are playing literally the only thing you could actually sort of be IRL.
---
Not sure if the combination of "literally" + "sort of" in the same sentence give something like "mildly" but in any case the look of the race is mostly cosmetic and only play a small factor in the world building of this game. For the Warrior class, I don't play Warriors but a WoW warrior has absolutely nothing to do with a real life warrior, the abilities that it use are almost more magical than what a mage use.

Hunter - I love being able to do a lot of content solo. I also love being able to kite mobs in dungeons/raids. Having a unique ability that other classes don't make me feel special.
---
Feign death is also amazing. I hardly ever die when my raid wipes
---
I wear Valor with 100hp enchant for like 80% of the MC trash.  Fuck that clown.
---
I still mog full Darkmantle in retail, it looks that cool on rogues!
---
Way back in '05 one of my favorite duels as a warrior against a mage I won the same way. Both our healths were super low and they frost nova'd and ran off to cast something and I remembered my gun and pulled it out and got the kill. It was someone in I was in the same room as and they were right away like "What the fuck was that dude?!"

i was HOPING for this comment. thank you sir or ma’am for giving me life 🤣
---
Disgusting, how awful of me haha
---
That's actually great. Thanks for info.
---
Probably play both. Classic is just not vanilla as I remember it. People seem to be minmaxing even more than before, hybrid classes are forced to heal even more than before, minimal world chat apart from LFG and WTS posts. Still, has some great points. Looking forward to BWL and beyond. MC and Ony kinda suck.
---
On retail every spec has a use, the raids are quite fun. But it feels more like a quick fix action game.
---
the ravager ninja hits too close to home :(
---
You really don’t know how good hoj is then lol.
---
If you get 100 less armor but 10+ agility, which would you take?
---
The only way you will get blizzard to care about bots , is to say the bots are supporting hongkong in the report.
---
Y'all forgetting blizzard literally created an entire island dedicated to being a dick to your own faction. 
---
Also how is this any different than yall posting videos of rogues stealing the herb loot from those tree mobs?
---

---
Threat is an ideology that was thrusted upon us by the man. It's all mumbo jumbo created by the corporations to control us.
---
No I’m having a ton of fun with it. The first server all anyone in any guild I joined complained about how empty it, then after looking it up it’s a notoriously empty server, then the second server I went to had a massively unbalanced horde / alliance population, so I switched again and saw a reddit post last night about that server being horde heavy and that there are never any alliance in any neutral zone because they’re all scared of getting ganked. I’ve loved each character I made but one of the main reasons I play this game are for player v pluer interactions, and I don’t want to waste my time on Character/server just to find out the server is dead or unbalanced
---
But where's the fun in that
---
I’m getting lots of Infos in my chat, I guess it’s from the last Details! update. “parser” and then info on miss and doge. How can I disable this?
---
no you took his offer. you held up your end
---
Also are you spamming in lfg or "lookingforgroup"? LookingForGroup is the games default group finding channel and while they both are used, LookingForGroup seems more populated
---
Sometimes I do, especially for looting random quest items that u cant see because of all of the brush and tall grass lol

From some other stories I've read on here you are about to get banned...
---
Meh, it's not as bad as it sounds, the droprate is relatively high, and you can only run 5 an hour anyway (which takes about 15-20 minutes). So you can do your 5 runs, go do something else for a while, do another 5 runs, rinse and repeat.
---
Yeah if you're drain tanking then spell power over all
---
Do mithril spurs and carrot stack?
---
But I don't think that's what OP means. I think he's talking about the random enchantment "of Healing" you can find on greens and on some blues. That "of Healing"-enchantment works just like the +healing bonus of the Boots of the Full Moon. The healing part of the Omnicast Boots works like that too.
---
But I'm pretty sure only the Omnicast Boots increase your damage with spells. The Boots of the Full Moon don't and the green boots of Healing don't either.
---
Seems neat I guess but wouldn't this be considered exploitation of game mechanics.
---
The other day I just barely missed the zeppelin, so close I tried jump on as it was leaving but missed by inches. I figured I had some time to wait so I went and made myself a sandwich and got a drink and got back just in time to see it leaving again.
---
31 ally priest on Faerlina, 27 horde shaman on Benediction
---
haha I was honestly falling asleep, I was turning in a quest right before going to bed. The t clap was because my pummel missed and wanted to do some damage...no excuse for demo shout  lol
---
No to 1, no to 2, no to 3. Blizzard agrees and so does the community.
---
Now you're just spewing complete nonsense. Blizzard confirmed in the very post you linked that the hitcap was 8% + the first 1% hit ignored, effectively making the hitcap 9%.
---
&gt; This means that the so-called “hit cap” is in effect 9% rather than 8% for a player with 300 Weapon Skill fighting a level 63 monster with a Defense Skill of 315.
---
It isn't 8.4 like you're trying to make it be.
---
Beaza's formulas were correct, as they calculate your *miss* chance. `(5+(315-300)*0.2)=8`, which checks out as Blizzard confirmed the miss chance cap to be 8%.
---
Hey everyone, I’m having troubles keeping my player and target nameplates in one spot after moving them. I like to have my name portrait and target portrait right above my abilities, but after logging out and back in they go back to the default position. Is there any way to fix this?
---
I had a Warlock doing this to me in Felwood while I was trying to quest. I asked him if he'd stop. He said no. Then a Horde UD rogue ran by and I waved at the rogue, pointed at the lock, nodded at the rogue, the rogue nodded back and ganked the shit out of the warlock. I thanked him and went on my way questing. Its pretty bad when you have reasons to kill members of your own faction.
---
So by that logic you shouldn't even use bandages?
---
What ranged weapon are you using in this video?
---
Yeah it works
---
It's good but it's not mental destruction good. There are other trinkets that do just fine. 
---
Classic isn't hard.
---
This is all very cool information! The only thing I would disagree with is the reason for the Burning Legion employing the Scourge - the Undead Campaign seems to suggest that the entire purpose of ravaging Lordaeron was so that Kel'Thuzad would have the opening required to destroy Dalaran and summon Archimonde.
---
These guys were really playing some wild 3D Chess.
---
You missed ez mode pvp you mean?
---
Did you have 5 prot warriors on the party? Lol
---
Haha thats awesome man, it was definitely a satisfying finish and I bet he didnt expect to get shot to death with rend ticking
---
I remember watching all of these on my xbox360 xD thanks op 🙏🏻
---
QUALITY
---
I dropped retail years ago, and everytime I've tried to pick it back up I got bored after a week or two. I expected the same to happen with classic, but we're almost two months in, and somehow I'm still having fun. So I'm expecting it to last a good long while, perhaps with some drops in activity between phases, but that's ok.
---
I made a playlist for everyone to listen to during the run.   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmNgptwhSEQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmNgptwhSEQ)
---
I just found this guy...and I am just here waiting on new content but he just moved so might be a minute :D
---
Bars and bolts, other classes need them for things too so you will have a wider market
---
Full valor amazing for solo farming as a warrior regardless, dudes a moron lmao
---
Please mark this NSFW
---
It's intended to be harsh tbf, especially in retail when gear can really trivialise levelling. There are different levels, like the green version for nothing better than green gear.
---
He was not expecting those gunshots.
---
For the emperor
---
Shatter is not required for aoe as you won't get crits from blizzard and you will cone of cold before you nova so it doesn't break the freeze.  Shatter and the one that makes them freeze you avoid for aoe spec.  If they freeze they stop being grouped up nice so you only want them to freeze when you choose with nova.  Shatter and the freezy one are good for pvp and solo beating up elites or something. 
---
Also your concern with improved blizzard is null.  You only want 2/3 into imp blizzard that way cone of cold can reset the slow.  If you have 3/3 it's a more powerful slow that coc will not reset so if you hit them with coc with 0.1 second left of the blizzard slow they will immediately be unslowed and ruin your day.  2/3 they allow to the same speed so either one can reset the timer.
---
This is clearly a group of dps warriors waiting for dungeon invites.
---
Dude. Taking someone else's bis is a dick move.
---
For most people, tribute runs will be less efficient than mara farming though.
---
I'm saying their examples aren't for wow lol.  Reading comprehension plz or maybe you think feeding your pet is griefing
---
Generally it smelting the ore can get you levels (silver and gold) the ore will sell better.
---
If it's in a raid or a situation where there's more than one rogue, I think it should probably tend to be rolled for since it's not unquiely your ability to open the box.
---
But if yoyre the only rogue fuck that your skill your loot if they wanted locked boxes they should have rolled a rogue.

why is it always warlocks the ones who afk
---
Man, some people settle for sub par while some people go for the best. Why is that a hard concept? 
---
Other trinkets are nowhere close. If you settled that’s fine but don’t act like hoj isn’t miles ahead of other melee trinkets.
---
Hahahahaha no judgement was just suuuuper curious
---
It amazes me how many don't understand this. The gear I'll use for other activities isn't necessarily the gear I'll use for raids. For many, though, it feels like raids is their entire worldview of end-game content.
---
Only an idiot would try this shit on a rogue lol.
---
Except that this game isn’t actually alliance vs horde. 90% of the content in the game right now is PvE.
---
Always roll need on world epic drops.
---
You are not quoting me, how can you possibly think that you are? Im literally saying the exact opposite of this..
---
The game quite clearly says "You can only have 2 professions at a time" And rogues can have 2+lockpicking right? So it is NOT a profession.. Thats the same as saying weaponskill is a profession and everyone going "Hey lets all go unarmed, cause thats the only thing everyone can do, fuck you im not using the bow skill profession in a group, that shit is only for my own benefit"..
---
Why would anyone do that?
---
Very strange indeed. Do you have the improved mark talent? Haven’t heard of this one before
---
You made my day!
---
You can down rank before 60, but you don't use it to maximize +healing into Health per Mana spent, you use it to heal 25% of someone's HP instead of 50%. 
---
If you only use max-rank, but heal people from 40% to 100% instead of constantly topping up from 75% to 100% you'll like finish having spent slightly less mana.
---
Exactly this! "200g cheaper than AH" can basically mean both 200g less than what it the current price it, and it can also mean 200g, which is less than what it costs on the AH.
---
Any background info in this?
---
Yes they do and afaik riding skill enchant to gloves stacks with them :D
---
Well ideally you can do it in ~12m but more realistically without an amazing group and if you stop to herb and stuff, probably more around 20
---
Yeah leatherworking gives a built in floor of about 7.14s per thick leather.  Something like that I don't have the math handy... maybe it was 6.14... anyway...  Any leather you can buy under that price is profit after crafting and vendoring, accounting for vendor mats.
---
Wtf are you even trying to say? Im presenting you a fact, it is not exclusive to rogues to have to spend time on their class shit.. Why do you think you are so special and entitled?

Hah, so every mage should loose to a warrior using FPA? Do you make this shit up or what
---
Need to go straight down combat. Riposte is super important and so is the wepon skill and chance for second hit for swords.
---
I’m not sure but I would say it’s probably not, just seeing as how you have such a low hit rate early on that a lot of the crits you would get would miss anyway, so it’ll probably balance out to being about the same as having the more consistent overall damage. Someone correct me if I’m wrong but that’s just my thought on it. The crit is cool for seeing big numbers here and there but I can’t imagine it’ll increase your overall dps by anything substantial

Just wait a couple seconds.  But yeah, warlocks will be limited by threat more than anything at first.

yeah, I recently rewatched all seasons while leveling.. Was like a time machine. So satisfying.

Sure you are that 0.0001% that dont think a mage is an asshole if he dosent make a portal after the dungeon, im sure you just go "What a fucking great guy, that portal stuff is a mage excusive thing, top dollar guy for not sharing that with the group"

yes because rich thorium nodes are in so many dungeons???

The mage is loose after that duel, I made sure of it
---
Druids on shapeshifted forms have no mana (except moonkin, is that even classic?) so cannot or should not be able to receive mana burns.
---
I healed mauradon at 45 as shadow spec... You may just need some practice. Mana management.
---
As a warlock who consistently out dps other locks with twice my gear your full of shit.
---
Wow soo tough for you huh.. Warlocks dont have to farm shards for hours every week, mages dont have to spend gold porting people and learning the portal skills, that they wil literally never ever use for themselves..
---
I cannot belive how tough it is being a rogue, that you actually have to spend time on somthing.
---
Yeah Improved Mark. Whats also strange is my buffs fall off too.
---
Why would that be hard to assume that if he does it once, and not just by accident but with a really bad excuse, that he would do it again?  It isn't about the gold value it's about the moral value of a ninja.  Once a ninja always a ninja and they found out cheap not to run with this asshat again and maybe even blast him in chat for it.  Reporting to blizzard does nothing for this particular situation.  He needs to be reported to classic community and we ostracize him from runs.  Classic justice.
---
The entire article refers to WoW. In addition to all the other games listed above.
---
So *you've* decided that the entire article refers to WoW except for a part that we aren't even talking about, because *you've* forgotten that people can throw and feed in WoW? And that now means that the griefing example doesn't apply to WoW either, because...?
---
Honestly you aren't making yourself look good here. What is happening in OP's video is *clearly* griefing, which you would be able to see if you watch the video (which you admit you haven't), which is a bannable offense.
---
Wolf on passive is way worse than wolf attacking.
---
Even if it dies in 30 secs it still does more dmg that way than just howling on you.
---
Shadow damage only affects your shadow spells, whereas +damage affects all spells. As a warlock the only non shadow spell you use is Immolate, so you can treat them basically the same
---
That or classic content is an afk snooze fest until AQ and grinding 120 BRDs to get a trinket in retrospect isn't that important.
---
Late reply, but fury/prot only really starts to shine and outpace normal prot builds with world buffs and/or great gear.
---
I dropped arctic reach and it seems fine without. I also dropped cone of cold which I definitely feel missing, only using level 1 as a snare but never a damage dealer. I put 1 point into permafrost rather than 3. I skipped winters chill, other mages in Raid have it so its unnecessary. All this so I could go deeper arcane and still grab 3/3 frostbite which allows you to solo elite 60 mobs, and obviously a huge advantage in PVP as well.
---
well remember hit above yellow is still good if you are duelwield
---
Healing potion on a duel ...
---
I got mine first run and won the roll vs 3 other people. Dont know what your talking about.
---
Is there a reputation discount for training skills?
---
Imo you want that 5% hit from precision asap. My little rogue couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a shovel until I started getting points in precision.
---
i mean it doesn't just howl on you

Ran Mara, black stone ring and the 2h mace dropped from princess. Hunter lost the roll on black stone ring to me. Got triggered and rolled need on the mace, we had an arms war in the group.

GM of the guild in question here and let me clarify;
---
No one has play requirements. We have over 200 active accounts. We do a Sunday purge of inactive accounts to keep the roster clean.
---
All we ask is that if you are going to be inactive for over a week to message an officer to set a note that you will be away so you don't get hit with the purge and need a re-invite.
---
Seems this was blown way out of proportion haha. Still funny though!
---
Fast attack speed, arguably one of the best classic Hunter pets.
---
Ahmpy is doing runs right now on Twitch if you want to see.
---
Sixty upgrades let’s you build gear sets and has compare capabilities I just learned about it this week it’s very cool
---
There’s no I in alchemy
---
Trying to compensate something?
---
I dont know why people who ask in guild chat don't give it a min or two then recruit. easily avoids these types of situations.

That mage was awful
---
look up fury slam spec, its really only good as horde though because of windfury
---
Hehe I hav small pp cuz I like 2 grief
---
The voice acting really does make this
---
It’s a meme.
---
Since wool cloth is in some weird bubble on my server, I ate a respec cost and just grinded out Stockades for wool and SFK for Shadowfang drops
---
I really like Arathi Highlands, just for the way it looks. At least with ground clutter turned all the way up :D
---
Feralas is decent too.
---
Fuck that rep grind in particular
---
The blue spider is like 50%
---
I didn't say griefing isn't banable I said only certain things are considered griefing not just anything that upsets you lol.
---
Can't watch the vid right now but that's not the point idk why you're so mad that I said only specific things are griefing then younlink a quote with specifics in bold that don't really apply to wow

🤣😂👌🤮

Slam spec is the only 2h furyspec there is

---
Which one for the "advanced" stats window?
---
Why?
---
Who does it howl on if it's on passive? Who in your group is standing within 15 yards of you and doing physical dmg?
---
Unless you're melee weaving, most likely no one.
---
You have not run BRD 290 times lol
---
Finding ninjas early and cutting them off from future runs is great for the community.  The fact that he took 3 gold to ruin his rep is good for all.  Blast him in chat and never run with that clown.  It's more about the info you gain about someone than the value of what they stole.  This info was cheap and OP should blast this in chat.  Most people will forget seeing a name one time but if he does it again and people see him in chat again getting blasted vaguely remembering the name it will stick.  Gotta hunt the ninjas.
---
Can't blacksmithing or engineering open them?

Depends what role the druid wants to play, for ganking take a look at the 0/30/21 build (or is it 0/21/30, can't remember) basically allows you the most flexibility. He'll want to stealth in cat form with you to open up then switch to heal if needs be in the fight. This would also be a good build for 5-mans as it allows him to heal, tank, or dps, but if he wants to focus on any one (or two) of those roles then a different build might squeeze out just a little bit extra. For example I'm almost exclusively tanking dungeons atm and I'm using my own build the that's mostly feral but takes a few points in resto and balance for talents that work well with a tanking build. I've also heard that although balance is subpar for PvE in classic, it's pretty good for PvP as it has insane burst damage, but I can't really speak to that personally.
---
TL;DR it depends how he wants to play, look up some builds, choose one and modify as appropriate.
---
If you are horde don’t use slam look up spamstring it’s easier and still competes at this lvl
---
Download questie add on, it shows you where all the quest givers are in a zone, and what level they are. Very helpful, good luck!
---
If it's not BiS, it's piss
---
Dungeons its harder getting into groups since most of the time there will already be a warrior/rogue that don't want a hunter rolling on gear.  Raids you get invited but expect at least 5 hunters per and its really hard to get into a guild that only recruits a few, otherwise get ready to roll against 5+ people.
---
Rp on retail actually play classic.
---
Ehh I hit gladiator as paladin warrior in tbc in season 4 when druids and rogues were at their most OP with glaives and dream state. While it was certainly an up hill battle I would not call paladins a laughing stock by any means. And I certainly wouldnt say ret was easier than holy. The thing was druids just had infinite mana and paladins didn't so you had to actually score kills which took coordination. A druid rogue could just keep mashing and eventually they'd win paladin warrior took cc and burst coordination at the right times in the match.
---
Nodes drop arcane crystals that are worth quite some gold, so what's your point?
---
Same as the rest, macro 9% hit for yellow. A little variance given a few might have shadow resist from class or buffs but I don’t think there’s any priest mobs there.
---
hahaha -- i dont know if they will do anything, but i tried my best.
---
they would be 4% hit if ranged +skill worked exactly the same as melee +skill, which it does not.
---
Sure, hunt the ninjas. Just not here
---
There's only two good gold farms you can do as a priest solo without including things like fishing playing the auction house and other non combat stuff:
---
The best gold you can make is farming maraudon in shadow spec, check oozespriest on youtube he has a good guide on it. Basically you farm the bosses in there solo and pick every ghost mushroom and blindweed you can find inside.
---
Aside from that there's a less useful farm that doesn't require you to be shadow,  farming lashers in dire maul east by aoeing them with holy nova. They are trash mobs that drop some vendor grays and there's a lot of herbs inside that instance.
---
I recommend you to respec shadow and farm mara, you can pay for the full respec cost in about 3 or 4 farming hours and it's really good but if you don't have the time to farm that much and want a quick easy farm lashers are very solid.
---
Aside from that if you don't want to farm solo you can also group up with a tank and do DME jump runs in which you 2man dire maul east and vendor all the loot. I don't like it personally but it's also decent gold
---
I would keep skinning, but lose leatherworking - you can literally get anything you need made for either of you by collecting the materials and asking a leatherworker to make it. Add mining for more cash flow - trainers are expensive.
---
I would definitely have alchemy and herbalism - potions and elixirs are so useful, and can even make money.
---
well i did  and dont have the trinket so?
---
Ever heard of battlegrounds? You can feed and help lose your team the game by doing nothing
---
Uh, I mean its your show and all but I think you're pretty wrong about shatter.
---
Ony doesn't wipe threat at any point.  She fireballs the top threat targets but it doesn't seem to change threat. 
---
It may or may not be intended but it's not the same as vanilla or servers.
---
Fishing in STV for trunks - sell mats from trunks == profit - made me 50G in last 4 days.  I only fish for a couple of hours each night.  And there are plenty of level 35-42 mobs to kill nearby - im also a 39 ally rogue.
---
but it seems like it
---
Why switch 1h/shield? It's not like there is a reflect yet!
---
As far as know, there is basically no spell haste in classic. With few exceptions like berserking. And yes, even when haste was introduced it didn’t scale with dots until, I think, cataclysm.
---
Wow classic is probably the best starter MMO. It sticks to the core of the genre while being casual friendly. 
---
A lot of MMOs either stray from the core of being an MMO or are fairly intense to dive into.
---
and what does bring me this information? nothing
---
Why do people like you even play classic? Fuck off to retail where this attitude belongs..
---
bdo blows wow out of the water its not even a question
---
So did I miss the part where they actually farmed a single dusty tome or herb?
---
Don't listen to him, he looks like a ninja advocate.  Most runs people do have tegridy.  You should blast chat about the ninja on your server.  Don't go overboard just a few times or people will get annoyed with you more than the ninja.  That guy probably does the same thing himself and thinks it's ok because it's low level things.  The principal matters and calling out ninjas is good for all.  Trusting that he will change his ways once loot is more valuable later is just idiotic and he should be dealt with now so more people don't get burned.
---
out of curiosity, was it a free roll on the carapace, or was priority given to people with 30/31 mats? i'm considering chasing that one and plan on running ubrs groups where the carapace goes to whomever brings the most mats to the run, declared at the beginning, of course.
---
People are way too obsessed with bis/pre bis shit. 
---
Wear the stuff you get and try to get the best. Passing upgrades just because they arent the BEST is stupid. You look way less stupid than some guy insisting on wearing either a green or Savage Glad.

---

---
though as a healer its a pain when a rogue rolls on a mace with +healing because it has additional dps on it

got mine after 170 kills, and the chest after 312 :&lt; it feels bad, but it will happen brother \^\^
---
I don’t think the damage part is up for debate. Ofc nothing will increase spell damage if it only says healing. And ofc damage is boosted if it says damage and healing. 
---
Fact is: +healing = increases healing by up to X

This is exactly why I’ve completely lost interest in the game after hitting 60. It’s not the same game I fell in love with when I was a teenager, mostly because of the people. Great game ruined by crappy people which is a pattern I’ve been noticing in most mmos these days
---
screencap or gtfo
---
Awesome. Thanks!
---
come on dude its clear sarcasm.
---
What is your source that they havent changed server caps without announcing it?
---
As long as the group is high enough level to dish out some decent dps, that fight should be pretty smoothly imo. 
---
Rogues can pop evasion to offtank the first slumber, mages blink/kite and then iceblock, etc.
---
Your spec is essentially correct but it sounds like you need to learn about weaving aimed shot and multi shot between your autos. Look up a YouTube guide on how to do this. 
---
Don't use arcane shot because it shares a CD with aimed shot and scales off spell stats instead of your normal gear.

It’s pretty cool he started making original content (or maybe he is stealing again, but I wouldn’t know the source); he used to be the biggest dunkey clone by the name Keyori, but changed it after he started getting huge backlash. I throughly enjoyed his zul’farak video.
---
Yes, absolutely, give it a shot. Classic is not the best MMO by any stretch, but it's going to be a great entry into the genre. Classic was a hastily slapped together mess that had amazing bright spots. 
---
The main two issues that new players will have is pressure to level and theorycrafted optimization. Most of what people are doing and talking about is life at 60 - and speeding through every quest to get there is probably the dumbest way for a noob to play. Forget leveling guides, forget optimal specs - if you need help, they are there, but initially read the quest log. I zoomed up on my main because I've done it all several times over and I can pretty much without a guide. But even now, on alts, I'm reading everything, taking my time, and enjoying the world. Slow down, there's no pressure for anything atm.
---
Second is too much reliance on guides and gear lists. We didn't have that in Vanilla, so feel free to ignore that for now. Have fun with your talent trees, level crap professions, and play the game badly! When you want to not suck or hit a roadblock, then look up the "right" way to do it. Even those aren't the best ones for everyone all the time. For ex. Warlocks have 3 builds in endgame, 1 for pvp, 2 for pve. But leveling and fuckin around, you can have lots of fun with an alt spec - I go heavy affliction drain tank with dark pact, something that you can't raid with, but allows you to melt pretty much everything as it hopelessly fails against your face.
---
I highly recommend trying it for at least a month, playing at least two characters to 15-20, and try to get in a dungeon or two. If it's not for you, you'll know. Then go try retail, or spend a month with other games like ESO before writing off the genre.
---

That's not even fun. Dress up like a farmer like I do. I used my Polearm skill level 1 Pitchfork, while wearing overalls. Pretend you're a mob with aggro range and leash range. What's the fun in just full geared ganking some level 26.
---
Just treats and wands and masks! Useful food (apples) that can heal you, and for higher level players a 16 slot bag drops from level 50+ undead mobs. And if you're doing the quests for the event there are guards that can be killed and can drop useful Regen items! This is all I've read from the web so far as this is my first time experiencing Hallows End as well! Stay Spooky my friends

Use the "Questie" AddOn, it shows the quest givers on your map.
---
Azshara! It's so pretty!
---
If you read what he wrote, it says "effectively". Yes, it means in order to hit cap you have to be 9% in order to not miss, because it is not possible to get a fraction of a hit without increasing weapon skill.
---
It is confirmed that each level of defense above your weapon skill increases the miss chance by .4. I don't know where this .2 number is coming from, but it is wrong.
---
Beaza's formula's are inccorect. The blue post shows this is incorrect if you analyze what was written. The post refutes the earlier statement, it says that there is 1% hit ignored if the difference is 11 or more skill points in defense above your weapon skill. If it worked the way you are saying, you would only need 5% hit to cap against an enemy of 3 or more levels if your weapon skill was 305 or more, this is not the case.
---
The math for this would be, if we used Beaza's and your incorrect calculation, ((5+(315-305))\*.2)=3, this **IS NOT 8.** If you take this number as being a reduction in hit cap, it would still be incorrect because if you have 305 weapon skill the extra 1% does not count because they are at 10 levels of difference.
---
At 305 weapon skill, the hit cap would be ((5+(315-305))\*.4=6, this is the hit cap for 305 weapon skill. My math is correct.
---
Your math does not check out and the .2 modifier is not right.
---
Rogues are a common class that people make, so they could be full - but if guilds are still combining runs or pugging there's a pretty good chance you could get an invite as a rogue.
---
Alternatively, Shamans and Paladins are definitely the most requested classes right - but only if you're going to heal.

new to making videos but I didn't loot any because i was trying to make the video as short as possible. I mostly made it just to show my guild. The Tome spawns where the high elf warlock is the one that pats around the fire.

From the screenshot, i can see you're a druid.  From one of your comments, i know that you are Level 56.
---
I play a druid to.  A Fully Spec'd Resto Druid, in fact.  I'm 57 atm.
---
Can you heal without being spec'd into the healing talents in the Resto Tree?  You most certainly can!  Without a doubt.  You still have your Rejuv, Regrowth, and HT spells.... with, or without being spec'd into the healing talents.
---
Betcha my heals, heal for more than your heals.  Betcha I can save a group wipe, more often than you can.  Betcha I can suffer an under-geared, ill-spec'd tank, better than you can.  Betcha my mana lasts longer than yours.  Betcha my group spends less time waiting for me to regen mana, than they do you.
---
Can you heal?  Absolutely!  Just no where near as well, as a fully spec'd resto druid.  Let's get that straight!
---
If a group prefers properly spec'd Healer, then I don't blame them!
---
The goblin near the boat dock has a really good quest that's not too hard
---
If you use shatter for aoe grind you are doing it absolutly 100% wrong and just making it harder for yourself.. Shatter will fuck up your stacking of the packs and making it nearly impossible to use blizzard as you should.
---
You can't put a single point into it until 46, max it out at 50. So arms would be better unless he's not planning to ever run dungeons until 50.
---
Costs like 40s for a 5 stack at vendor for a comparison.  30s - 1g.  Somewhere in that range good tip for your water/food needs.  For the port the reagent is 20s, 18s with honored rep.  So minimum 20s for a port so the mage isn't paying to do you a favor.  Up to 1g, more welcome if you want to make a mage smile.
---
Go back to retail then, it's people like you who belong there anyway
---
"Retail is not bad" ... No it really is. There a reason retail numbers are bombed to shit while Classic numbers are above it.
---
Variety is the spice of life. You can heal fine as any spec for the Leveling dungeons. I wouldn't respec, especially because alternating quests and dungeons will make the game more enjoyable
---
I would suggest getting crit instead.
---
I have Benediction, but between Bene, Force of will, and Holy Specialization. thats a base of +12% crit off the bat. And if you manage to get the crit from either Ony, or a Tribute run. Its very reasonable to hit \~25% crit, and if you can guarentee that say on average every mob gets crit once or twice, thats essentially one or two more novas for free.
---
If you use shatter for AOE grind, you are just making it way way harder for yourself, it is absolutly THE worst aoe grind talent. It is better to just not use those 5 points than to have shatter.
---
that's wrong, primary target of fireball gets their threat wiped otherwise she would just continuously fireball the highest threat person
---
I'm the same way tbh. I pass on shit that's an upgrade for me all the time if someone else is there I feel it's better suited for
---
I appreciated the advice and know it would be helpful - but I’m not a fan of addons.
---
Nah, it was overtuned at first and now it's at the level it was before. You still get threat from it.
---
There's also no good reward for healer or cloth DPS, apart from the quest that requires you to kill herod at least once
---
If you have to misspell a word to get the name you want... don't. Just let it go and come up with something else.
---

Stop wasting your time doing shit you dont want to do in order to have the exact same gear some guide tells you is optimal.
---
This minmax slot optimization shit is toxic and was literally never as big a part of vanilla as people are making it out to be, ahit even during early TBC people just ran shit they wanted to which has various upgrades and did entry level raids when their schedule permitted.

You're investing way too much mental effort and time into a tiny increase in your DPS.

It's not a weird bubble, it's supply and demand.

Wool cloth drops in a very small level range that people move through very quickly. And if you don't live in stockades, you may not even kill that many humanoids in this level range. But everyone who wants to level First Aid or Tailoring (and even some other professions if they want to be efficient) needs it.
---

I had a rogue from one of the raid guilds call me a shit healer before dropping out of ZF the other day.  I was healing in enhance (not usually an issue) and our warrior tank was level 42.  The only reason we made it as far a Gazrilla in the first place was we had three good mages that were sheeping and kiting because the tank could not hold aggro as he couldnt hit or taunt anything.  One of the mages had to bail after the endurance event and instead of getting a real tank like we asked (there was a 46 war lfg) the leader got this asshole rogue who whinged the entire time.
---
No its not good.  If you want that kind of playstyle play an ele they do it better.
---
Nice! Many adventures still ahead!
---
Ok but if you're going 2h fury 2h arms is still way better since it actually buffs your weapon skills.
---
And MS is vastly better then BloodThrist until you get like..900 attack power.
---
Join a raiding guild.
---
You won't enjoy your time spent in pug raids. Some of them can be really well organized and others, well...It's not even worth the effort.
---
It started becoming a thing in Wrath. But yeah.
---
And if you knew you were on a bad server, would you stay?
---
Thats why they dont want yoy to knoe
---
Phase 2 threat keeps adding up but she doesn't care who is highest during it.
---
This is why raids have trouble when she lands for phase 3 if the tank isn't attacking her during phase 2
---
Why? I have seen clips of both it seems to me that they just both one shot?
---
playing with hit is kind of hard if you dont get nice rings and guns tho
---
the standard lion + trustrike + devilsaur is hard to replace and if anything I'd replace devilsaur first with flame and cloud keeper now
---
and if you had to replace two pieces to get 2 hit then typically it's not worth it
---
Rematch me again tonight for another gold,
---
Albiny
---
Same. Every 4 or 5 ticks I get 21. I've never gotten a 19 as far as I know. The other rogues in my guild complain about getting 19s and never 21s. Its very weird. Maybe I just lucked out at character creation.
---
Looking for a priest spec that will allow me to grind dungeon exp as a healer but also quest efficiently. Any tips?
---
Yes it's literally too much to ask since the entire foundation of the game is "no changes"....
---
why are u even asking
---
Good effort, but the one and only BiS shirt is [[Captain Sander's Shirt]](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=3342/captain-sanders-shirt).
---
&gt;I feel like 80%
---
Tough luck; facts don't care about your feelings 😉
---
&gt;It doesnt matter what class.
---
It really does. If its a mage like you said i'd be excluding shaman/druids/priests/locks/mages all so I could get my item. I'd be excluding most the classes with your strategy. With mine i'm exluding part of one class and they aren't harmed because they can instantly get into any group. My way excludes no one while yours excludes most everyone.
---
If your raid is putting more than one hunter in any group, there is something very wrong with your RL lol. TSA doesn't stack.
---
Why didn't you just give him his money back and say sorry, you got confused for a sec?
---
Yeah this is how it's gonna be in classic.
---
The whole "Lol it isn't your BiS why are you rolling?" is super common.
---
Don't fall into the 2/3 imp blizzard trap. 3/3 is the way to go. The mobs will be in the blizzard for longer which means more damage done to them. Also you can Nova, wait for blizzard to drop off and then CoC. There's no need to make CoC overwrite blizzard.
---
With a key good enough BS can, but I've yet to see a person that really carries keys, or at least ones that actually use them on chests.
---
Haven't met those, but ww axe or ravager arms warriors are about the worst, with regards to overaggroing my arms warrior tank.
---
And especially those that exclusively DPS, which I don't understand, and try to avoid as much as possible.
---

---
Why are you even in a guild if you're not logging on in over a week?
---
I personally just use the one from the vault myself.
---
It's got less stats then savage chain but it has 2% crit still which is pretty huge
---
Because every locked chest drops epics???
---
ive been using this one search engine called google for years it’s amazing. can even be used for non-wow related things as well
---
I saw a hunter a few days ago in the graveyard botting too
---
things only go for like 20g on my server
---
does gehennas eu server have a discord? ive googled but the one i found only has like 500 members
---
Because he runs at mount speed on classic. Its doable for great hunters, but really hard for all other hunters and all other classes
---
Havnt played since cata, and won't play again. 
---
Classic only
---
Wait are you serious?
---
"You can't roll on that because it's MY LOOT"
---
You're gonna want to change that mindset like, right now.
---
"""facts""" and "special and entitled" to do the thing they specifically leveled a skill to do, and that you didn't/can't and yet somehow feel you're "owed" it? What a fucking moron lol
---
You're probably wondering how I got here...
---
Hmm ok well my advice would be to actually do the things you say in the video :p no offense but this video is just you walking through dm. At least talk and say this is where the time would spawn, you can grab this herb without agro etc.
---
POM+arcane power is the best single target specc for mages, so yes?
---
It was for a gold! One whole gold.
---
so you just let people take stuff from you? lol nice
---
If you double tap it, you wil RS / WC / WC because raptor strike will be on CD

Unfortunately I haven’t found a way of making the macro any smarter. You can spend a lot of unnecessary mana if you spam the macro on extra Wing Clips. If I do find a way to adjust it, I’ll edit this comment.
---
no lol
---
And you based this
---
&gt;  Idiots who only cares whats good for themselves and dosent give two shits about anyone else. 
---
off what exactly? I just want a tiny gold reward for the effort I put into leveling lockpicking and now suddenly I'm selfish and don't care about anyone else.
---
I saw a bug about improved mark not giving the right buff but nothing about a mana drain. Is it only when you thorn first ?
---
If each run took you 30 mins, which realistically they would probably take you more closely to an hour, then you would have spent 6 days of game time farming... me thinks you lie
---
But that's not what the guy I replied to said, right? He specifically mentioned damaging spells being included and I replied to him that I believe they aren't. I even got two downvotes for that comment (it was at -1 a few minutes after posting).
---
Or did I completely misunderstand him when he claimed that obviously damaging spells are included in the healing done by spells and effects?
---
Cause it's been 15 years and things change.
---
I think its a meme haha
---
It’s not an instant ban. A GM will kill you and warn you, then ban you if you continue.
---
No it is not. It's a nice pvp montage spec, and it has some uses for WSG if your premade has trouble with taking down flagcarriers.
---
It's a shame how sensitive some people are, that was clearly a meme
---
There's one that uses hamstring in the rotation.
---
Umm, they said no mage should ever lose to a warrior, not whatever you read.
---
its just like it was  in 2005
---
If you are a tank, boots of avoidance is a great pick up for like 30g. If you are saving for myrmidion, I personally wouldnt.
---
Stockade are pre bis tank shoulders
---
Seems same on lota of servers. One way the community changed is mob tagging. More problems with my own factions lvling up than horde on a PvP server. Sad indeed
---
&gt; It is confirmed that each level of defense above your weapon skill increases the miss chance by .4
---
You can't put forth your belief as a fact and then claim it's "confirmed". You have absolutely nothing backing your nonsense reasoning and arguments.
---
&gt; ((5+(315-305))*.2)=3,
---
5+10*0.2 is 7, not 3
---
&gt; (5+(315-305))*.4=6
---
5+10*0.4 is 9, not 6
---
I suggest you try to understand basic order of operations before you try refuting formulas.
---
I have no idea how in the world you managed to think that 5 plus a non-negative value equals 3.
---
&gt; ((5+(315-305))*.2)=3
---
You can keep spouting nonsense as much as you want. You are completely incapable of basic math.
---
What parts? Alsing for a friend...
---
You are not special because you put time into something, you dont deserve shit more than anyone else for that time. Anyone put time into their unique things, but only rogues seem to think yours make you entitled to shit.
---
I really wish people like you had some special tag, so we knew how to avoid you people like the plague.

I just started a human warrior after switching from drawf warrior (because i kept regretting not going human) so what are the best professions to pick up as a warrior? Ive heard mining and blacksmithing are good as they go hand in hand for a warrior, I also heard first aid is amazing also, though im not sure if that will really work without having skinning (never done it before). Im also wondering if I level all the way to lvl 60 as a warrior, can I swap back and forth in dungeons/raids as a tank/dps without having to constantly change my talents? Im ok with having to change gear obviously.
---
Neither of them realistically 1 shot and the ele shaman doesn't give up all their survivability and a lotof sustained damage to have access to it.
---
no a hunter should never be rolling on that over any melee class end of story
---
I’ll probably get hate for it but look up jokered aoe spec( I took 2 points in imp frostbolt instead of frost ward). It’s great for dungeons and aoe grinding mobs on your own. You will do less damage in single target fights because you don’t have full improved frost bolt cast speed but it’s negligible until raiding time where you will want to spec more into a single target build
---
If you ever accepted a summon from a warlock or a portal from a mage, you are one huge hypocrite.. I hope you realize that.
---
I've been wondering this myself. It does proc sweeping strikes, that I know.
---
Yeah. What if I have no intention of raiding either. My BIS could be for PVP of a fashion show BIS.
---

---
I mean poly shuts down FPA hard, so yeah mage shouldn't really lose to war ever.
---
Hahaha imagine getting this offended.
---
Hunters are garbage u snowflake
---
Not on Zul'jin it was not. Granted PvE server but your own faction respected someone mid cast not to tag his mob with an instant or w.e BS
---
There is another.
---
Daily chores, rng stats, and class homogenization.
---
It depends on the vein.
---
Ores has no use other than being smelted into bars, so doing that work usually adds value and it also condenses the mats as ores stack in 10's and bars in 20. 
---
However one of the best ways to skill mining is through smelting in the early levels. Copper and iron usually sells more as ore than bars, but it can vary depending on the market.
---
Could just stop wasting the majority of your waking hours farming a trinket and do something you actually enjoy - in game or out.
---
Classic is full of REALLY helpful people at the moment. Way more than back in the day. 
---
I would ask whether you thought yourself a patient person. If so, classic is for you, if not you might prefer retail. They're both great games, but there is a slow burn feel to classic that the instant-gratification set might not appreciate.
---
Want to sell GOD TIER NAMES on FAERLINA:

pst for details.
---
Something.... has awakened IN ME.
---
"hypocrite" for you using a skill that I didn't ask them to use and one that they simply get for leveling that class that costs a minor reagent? Fuck your logic is next level stupid.
---
Great point that I forgot. I farm lower level dungeons and if I have 30+ mobs meleeing me FD resists a lot (warning message that pops up, not batching), but if they’re further away it almost never happens.
---
people griefed in vanilla all the time is what he's saying tho
---
Nah farming MH Dal Rend is the real challenge.
---
Amen. Gotta have peeps just having a good time in Gchat.
---
That's fucking awesome lol
---
Blizzard let everyone beat the game. Part of the reason why Classic and BC was so good was that the end of the game was way out of reach and felt like you never will see any bosses in naxx or sunwell.  Now they let everyone beat it and if you want something harder you can do the exact same bosses on a harder difficulty witch most people don’t care to do. When you give everyone what they want in a MMO,  you take they’re drive from them. If you randomly got 100 mill would you keep working at your job? Very few will but most wont.
---
I don't get it.
---
Telling them to only heal the tank is not productive, if I was a dps dying to unavoidable AoEs like in BRD mobs Arcane explosion, and I wasn't healed and died to an AE while the tank was fine on heal and the healer was sitting there watching? I'd be pretty pissed. Only reason you shouldn't heal a dps is if the tank is dropping at a rate that healing the dps would get him killed, or if there is no incoming AoE.
---
Its been a few months......
---
The ability to have a 1500 damage combo (ignoring crits or +spellpower) up every 6 seconds while being beefy definitely edges it for shamans.
---
They have their own issues, but they definitely fit the role better.
---
Damn you salty too.
---
No, the two of you idiots believe your experience rushing to level 60 (with literally nobody higher level to gank you) is the same as other people who are just now get level 30 with a large portion of the playerbase having higher levels than them.
---
hikey, you are both retarded.
---
[This is what the build looks like](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LMhxbhbZVV0VMEoVo), but honestly don't bother your crit rate wont be high enough to keep up flurry.
---
Ah that definitely could be it! What a neat bug, but annoying for priests
---
No bandages, no blacksmith or engineering gear. Obviously no items with charges. 
---
Food is out. Yeah I don't buy these unwritten rules either. They seem arbitrary.
---
Please stop insulting and namecalling each other. Thanks.
---
I'm conflicted.  For most of the life of wow I've played resto shaman, but my first 60 was actually a hunter with broken tooth lol.
---
Feeding is totally a thing in wow look at alterac with reinforcements
---
Absolutely, I got my friend to start classic after he saw all the fun I was having, he’s loving it so much and has three toons above level 30. (He’s still figuring out which class he likes)
---
It is odd that you would want that piece as a fury warrior. It is also not that great for protection warriors either. 
---
We should all be nicer to eachother.
---
Level of enjoyment for that lock was like a 7/10.
---
You posting on reddit bitching makes it 11/10 enjoyment.
---
Doesn't sound like you rolled, the terms of the deal were upheld. You're fine imo
---
You can get blizzard to hit the whole time either way if you do it right won't miss a tick.  Having coc reset can save you more than having a little slower blizz.  But that being said yes full blizz works too.  It helps more leveling if you get into aoe spam groups with multiple mages.  So much easier if all are 2/3 with less problems.  OP is trying to make a hybrid though so saving a point the idea beneficial to his build also.
---
A lot of the quests show up after you complete some of the initial quests in feather moon. But that's always your hub for acquiring them.
---
Thank you for the advice! Will do if I ever make another video. I guess doing the swirly thing with my mouse to point out spawn points  wasn't enough haha.
---
If you're leveling then it's best to use FT and a quick dagger with shield. You'll have much less downtime.
---
Why are you dodging the question, how do I not value his time?
---
Sorry I’m not familiar on diremaul at all- if this better definitely go for it
---
The main thing is Blizzard became a soulless corporation only interested in trying to maximize "player engagement" instead of making a good game. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AxZofbMGpM
---
I'm sorry, it's been a long day.. FT?
---
No. Spell hit is of no benefit to a holy paladin. Do not take something like that over a caster. If you have reasoning like this, you're a selfish asshat and don't actually understand what it is.

Was it an upgrade for a fury warrior?

---
I have Peon, Bone and Orc on Faerlina
---
Well you can remove your points in Winters Chill unless you're the assigned Winter's Chill mage for your raid. I'd put them into imp CoC.
---
You can have first aid in addition to any other professions. Bandages are made from cloth so you don’t need skinning. Mining and blacksmithjng probably best.
---
Feels nice once you have all 6 timers and you run around farming them easily. Just got 220 couple days ago in anticipation of the PvP release. 
---
Getting the first one is always the hardest.
---
I think the problem is with blizzard's streamlining of the game.
---
The problem is pretty simple. Yes, no one likes long wait times for mobs to spawn. No one likes having quests unsolo-able. Yes, no likes having to spam chat to get groups for dungeons. Yes, no one likes having specs that are useless for raiding.
---
The problem is, every time you take out a little inconvenience, you make the game less gratifying.  Every time to cut out a wait time or add in an automation you make wow less of a world and more of a game. 
---
If you keep sanding long enough your eventually left with nothing other than a flat board and blizzard has kept sanding down wow for 15 years.
---
I think the player base will change their mind once phase 2 plays out.
---
Its medium pop now. But it's a newer server
---
Yeah I played on skullcrusher US East alliance, it was DM for us, but my point was that Dead Mines was out before Dire Maul was out so if you’re wondering why people call Dead Mines DM is because it was the first instance that was out!
---
The important psa is to pick up world buff ... 25% mana, health regen and stamina. Some people don't even know it exists.
---
Might as well add $5 worth of wood polish for the fucking cross you're on because listening to your posts it sounds like it's getting used and abused on a regular basis by your selective reading to be outraged is this strong and the "it only takes 2 hours to level it!" Hyperbole when it doesn't, hell more time in travel alone than that for it nevermind the time in actually unlocking them all. We also bring the second highest single target DPS, amazing threat control, and CC options, all you bring to groups is a whiny shit attitude lmao.
---
The gear excuse doesn't work when there are sub-60 ilevel Warlocks in the top 10 rankings for popular servers. Debuff/Buff issues also don't fly when several characters from the same guild are placing highly. Most people claiming that Classic has a really low skill cap so there isn't much room to just play better aren't even putting out DPS close to #10 on the rankings.
---
Eh I will pass on an upgrade if it is someone else’s Pre-BiS and just okay for me.
---
Gratz, buddy.
---
You. I like you.
---
Why do you want a healer in every group? What's the benefit?
---
The fact that you can't attack them and PvE servers don't change inra faction play from pvp servers...
---
Nah, don't want to respec for it. Finally got him once and barb to drop and tarnished ring lol. Found out the reasons I was failing and finally got it. A big part of it is having mistakes happen so much that you don't see ever again. But correcting the big ones makes it easier. Right after I got it done I made it to the end first try second time.
---
Damnit
---
How? Can’t use it in combat.
---
I love giant numbers........
---
But I love actually doing damage more so I think I will switch out my weapon as soon as I can.
---
What nameplates addon are you using? Or is that a weakaura?
---
No idea about alliance guilds, were chill on horde side lol
---
Are you including talents, spellpower or crits? I wasn't, and raw fireball + fireblast = 620+470ish damage.
---
Mine/BS is good, but engineering is also something to look at if you’re going to be active in PvP. First aid is a secondary prof that you can take that doesn’t count toward your two professions (cooking and fishing fall under this too). Skinning doesn’t affect FA because cloth drops from mobs — skinning won’t get you more of those mats.
---
tried to pummel but it missed =\[
---
Gph?
---
yes and yes
---
I've been 2h fury tanking dungeons for multiple weeks now with breastplate of valor on instead of death dealer breastplate, it's good to have.
---
Anyone else having an issue when they hover their mouse over an enemy, red text appears saying unknown unit and sometimes out of range?
---
I do earth shock quite a bit especially since the stormstrike increases it's damage for a good little bit after cast.
---
Found the caster.
---
They won't in phase 2, maybe late phase 6. You basicly want classic+ already?
---
While I get what you are saying I have passed on upgrades because the item wasn't a prebis and I was gonna replace it anyway while it was good for someone else.
---
It depends on your mentality. Even if someone is a pick up for me it makes more sense to let someone else get their final item.
---
Because to be honest that chest is pure trash for dps and I would've never rolled it. Even if I was wearing a green questing item. Of course the reaction from the other guy was loathable, but doesn't make him wrong.
---
My shield bash missed, but thats why I swapped sword and board
---
I play druid so I can't speak for rogues, but I've never noticed a 19 tick while leveling up to 60. To test properly I've sat in town now for 15 min spamming Tiger's Fury and watching the energy ticks. With no miss/parry/dodge to mess up energy ticks I did not get a 19 tick even one time. Lots of 21 ticks but no 19 ticks at all. 
---
Why do some people like me never get 19 ticks while others get them all the time? Can someone link a video of a 19 tick with no parry/dodge/miss because I've never seen it.
---
What's your total +heal, and which class? Are you down ranking? Are your tanks using 2h?
---
is legal
---
Try healing with only green +healing gear without any stats. Stats aren't irrelevant.
---
Thats unspecced. Specced would be 1700+
---
This, but Enh really is about WF. That's why you need to push for hit cap in order not to miss - as you describe, a hit can result in a huge DPS drop. 
---
Other than that, the Ele talent that gives +melee crit after spell crit is good for adding Flurry proc rate.
---
That chest is pretty worthless tho, I wonder how many people defending the greedy option actually managed to get their gear sorted. I think the difference in mentality just shows some people are more oriented towards being efficient and some aren't.
---
He didn’t get it at first but the guy who did let him have it.
---
Yes, to all the above.
---
It went away but it happened when I wasn't even buffing.
---
They’re different games for different player bases. Classic is for you, that’s fine, retail is for plenty of others. “What went wrong” isn’t really a question we can answer for you, what do you want from WoW that retail doesn’t give you anymore? That’s your answer
---
Had plenty of those.
---
Oh yeah thats why than. People are in farm stage rather than consumer
---
I am practicing this right now! Thanks!
---
well anyway i'll be sure to post a reply when i'm in queue the day phase 2 releases on my server which had no queue for the past month
---
Please don’t.
---
Spec?
---
Farming lashers unfortunately is no longer viable as they nerfed the loot tables in Classic and made them tougher to kill. It is still possible to do it, it's just simply not worth the time anymore.
---
Just a question then, what is your spec? 0/30/21? Or deep feral? And if 0/30/21, is you aggro good enough without omen of clarity?
---
So here we have an argument between price fixing and an organic economy. Screw that guy.
---
Switch to rockbiter for more consistency and more avg. damage. 3.8 is slow but slow is good for avg. dps. It's a bit more inconsistent yes.
---
Its the adjustment from low level instances where you can do pretty much anything to end game where the tank needs time to gain threat, dps need to attack marked targets/ interrupt and follow mechanics. Hopefully your tank takes charge and marks what he wants killed. If not, take the lead by marking mobs for everyone and call out what needs to be interrupted/cleansed/ prioritized. Pugs are painful, so try and run in guild groups where there is a modicum of control.
---
As a warrior if you are abusing the heroic strike bug hit is less important, however if that bug didn't exist it doesn't matter that you aren't fighting a boss, hit capping yellows isn't the only goal, rage generation is the main thing, and you cannot hit cap anyway.
---
Also tbh who cares about fighting anything that's not bosses? I haven't done any other pve content for like 2 weeks now, makes sense to optimise for that.
---
Sounds like DPS needs to back off their damage. You really shouldn't have to heal anyone other than the tank.
---
How about for 5-man dungeons?  Is Winter's Chill necessary for those?  There won't be another "assigned" mage for those, and it seems like it would be a pretty substantial boost with the +10% crit...
---
Shadow, your normal skills are more than enough to heal dungeons.

Im a mage I do everything better than you do and im not a 12 year old selfish kid.. And you do not bring 2nd highest, mages and warriors are both better ST and they bring something to make others better aswell.
---
You still dont realize that over less than 1 month rogues are the ones who have by far the easiest class unique thing? Over a year it becomes a joke how easy rogues have it with LP over the entire classic expansion I dont even know what to call it..
---
But boo fucking hoo for you rogues that you ONE TIME have to invest 2 hours into lockpicking, must be real fucking tough.
---
If you're dps spec, you go for the gear as it helps you farm gold faster, but if you're a healer, you're better off with the mount speed.
---
apologies if its been asked before - I have questie because I like being able to see the markers on the map, but the auto-accept and auto-complete is a bit much, I'd like to be able to read the text - is this easily configurable in the addon? thanks
---
I count a raid of 6 people. Can't do quests in a raid group :D

Its amazing and fun af
---
I see reading comprehension isn't a strong suit of yours. I specifically said belt, not other slots. Belt is a weak slot for healing outside of the new DM belt (whipvine) and phase 3 belt (corehound).
---
Try reading what is said first.
---
It also costs the warlock time and effort to make it to the dungeon, farm soul shards and then summon the rest of the party. It costs the mage reagents to cast a portal (or multiple) at the end of the run. But I've never seen anyone demand compensation for it. In my experience group cohesion works much better if everyone accepts that they're in it together and pool their skills.

Wasn’t there a bug mentioned the other day where bosses in BRD/BRS were level 62 rather than level skull to 60s? If so, this might be a fix for that.
---
Oh, ya that's a bug, 1 of 3 things happened all of which are (potentially) bugs.
---
1) it didn't loot to you "because" even if you had the bag space and you'd have to corpse loot it off (bug) , sometimes I know it won't happen correctly if someone is trying to loot that particular corpse exactly when the roll completes, but that's EXTREMELY unlikely since I've seen it happen a handful of times ever... 
---
2) it got "looted" and it'll just randomly show up in your bag in a few hours. (Bug)
---
3) it just straight up vanished and you're shit out of luck (bug) :/
---
Yes. I was honored with Orgrimmar and friendly with Darkspear, skills were cheaper from the orc trainer than the troll trainer standing next to him
---
Are you going to merely base the comic book around wow loosely or are you going to set it within the wow universe? Blizzard is known for sending C&amp;D after people making wow content.

Alright... if you want to play the spec war shamans have a talent that lets them guarenteed crit all of those for 3000 damage with good timing. More likely two crits for 2500. Shamans also have better scaling off spellpower in that combo than mages do, and additional talents give them +11% crit on lightning spells.
---
There's a reason mages fear shamans.
---
Higher populations on a big patch day?
---
For what it's worth, an angerforge run definitely isn't 30 minutes. You can hit lockout on them.
---
Looking for a priest spec at level 56 that can allow me to heal higher level dungeons but also quest efficiently.
---
Well done!
---
I don't think the auto-accept is from questie? At least mine doesn't do that, and i can't see that in the options
---
It would eat at me, knowing there was another guy running around on the server with the real John name
---
kind of hard to tell with only that limited info, might be a bad tank or two, might be stupid trigger happy DPS not letting them get aggro, might be your gear if you aren't keeping it at least somewhat close to your level or just using the wrong stuff.
---
Why would I have void walker out while questing? 
---
Furthermore, the succubus is clearly the better pvp pet. 
---
The ONLY reason I need to use voidwalker for pvp is when I **KNOW** that I will be dueling/pvping a rogue. And even then, felhunter is arguably better.
---
So your recommendation is just always be prepared for one class. Even though it will give me a distinct disadvantage against any other class.
---
Tell me, what do rogues have to do to fight a warlock? 
---
Oh right, you're invisible so you just chose your fights.
---
So me as mining/skinning, my druid friend an alch/herb? That seem like the way to go until 60? What should I do with the leather and ore, vendor it for cash?
---
Obviously its not the BEST, but its a great feature and something that shouldnt have been removed since it adds versatility to melee classes
---
Name is not blurred though
---
Here is a pro tip. Inner Focus -&gt; Prayer of Fortitude.
---
Then a dps tab targets wrong mob and pulls 3 more groups and it's your fault for being a *retail* player.
---
Why would you HS out when you have a mage? It is just a logic that i will not understand, the game was made so that certain classes can make things easier, fucking use it like it is supposed to.
---
Im not upset about anyone helping eachother, im upset about entitled rogues thinking they are so special because they have to spend time on lockpick, like others dont actually have to spend time on their class. It just screams that people are 12 year old and dosent know what a group is for and I wish people like that had a tag so reasonable non selfish people could avoid those idiots.
---
Ruthless but smart.
---
The best thing I've seen all week.
---
Sure, ok.  That's what the last guy said.
---
Why can't you walk away?
---
I have grinded it for countless hours and never seen it drop, the guy is a dick about it but he is 100% right, it's the chest to grind, it's literally the only drop you need outside of raids (the rest can just be bought). Do you have something to do while not raiding :P.
---
yep, master looted and any desirable item "on reserve". I've actually seen Jed/Rend runs where both Dal'rend MH and the Jed trinket is reserved. so basically everything anyone could need from such runs.
---
It is worth every minute. Ravager is the best item in the game in my heart.
---
Haha seriously, now if they set rules to the duel thats a different story. But a regular duel, anything goes
---
Hurray for Kurinaxx am i right. Now if only i kept playing. I got a shaman to 30 and then mh came out.
---
Played a druid after the first couple patches in Vanilla and raided through the first few expansions. No mob mana burn worked on druids in forms  and they fixed viper sting in 1.4 to not effect druids in forms.
---
Nice gunna use this for sure thanks man.
---
Wtf that teabagging was so hot
---

---
False. Alchemy uses thorium ore in a recipe.
---
Orcs are space aliens that are so uninteresting that their own Warchief aka WoW Jesus didn't  wanna be around them anymore. 
---
Trolls are so worthless that when one of them was made warchief he couldn't even last a whole expansion. 
---
Tauren are just Hamburgers with some fight left in them. 
---
Undead are some dumb they can't even build elevators that don't kill their own faction.
---
Amazing good job
---
Imagining a Hunter getting the proc and just.. spinning there after trying to get a quick Wing Clip off makes it so sad.
---
Yep. Right as you zone in the group starts going ham, begging for brilliance, begging for water, asking why you are oom when you did little to go damage. 
---
And some wonder why mages act how they do.
---
Default Questie setting definitely don't have auto accept and auto-skip.  
---
But why you ask here, instead of checking settings by yourself?
---
disempowered people in real life can be super obnoxious online.  he probably is a file clerk at some government office or serves you coffee in the morning.
---
Bars sell faster and alot more volume sold. Sometimes ore can be abit more than the bars oddly most cases not. Even than the bars tend to sell and you know you wont waste gold posting.
---
Haven't happened to me yet to be fair.
---
The players I've been playing with have been keen to admit their mistakes.
---
Yeah it can be, I can’t remember exactly how it works but even your single target heals are multiplied by the number of mobs. Even with the threat talent I get aggro all the time. But see how you go man I’ve seen a bunch of 60s with basically the exact build you posted.
---
That’s a weird bug. But nothing in Classic surprises me anymore.
---
I think getting damaged from that torch while mind controlled counted as a PvP action and so triggered the guards?
---
There is.
---
This sub is filled with negative and toxic people. Don’t ask me why
---
Pretty much, yeah
---
Frost nova into flamestrike + coc is pretty huge damage.
---
Let's take the ZF farm for example: You blizzard twice, frost nova into flamestrike + coc, a couple of arcane explosions and it's done.
---
It’s almost like blizzard named him after a real person 😱
---
Tbh the game is this easy because we have 1.12 itemization. People seem to forget that but we are running like double the stat quality in our gear compared to MC release.
---
You will see how many of these guilds stomping MC hit a wall on BWL. Of course those doing the content for 15 years will destroy it but the average population will get stuck for sure.
---
Also remember MC wasn't even considered hard back in the day, not sure where the reputation comes from, we used to pug this in phase 2 in my server with literally 40 random people.
---
it takes 5 frostbolts for you to get the full benefit from that though and in most dungeons you won't be casting that many on the same target unless it's a boss. Sometimes you're just unlucky and won't crit too.  Imo it's not worth when you can get more guaranteed damage via imp CoC. The less you have to rely on RNG the better.
---
What is the difference between the stat "+x Healing spells" in white text, and the "Equip: Increases healing done by spells and effects by up to x" in green text? Or is there no difference and its just because one is from an "of healing" roll?
---
Here's a couple of tips:
---
- use rockbiter when questing. It does more overall damage because it also increases stormstrike damage directly.
---
- to avoid having to drink too often, use your spells in bundles. When solo killing mobs, you're gonna be using 3 spells: Stormstrike-&gt;lightning shield-&gt;Earth shock. You should virtually always use these 3 together, don't refresh lightning shield afrer you kill a mob or if it's still alive as it will cost you precious free mana regen. It's better to auto attack it down and then be ready for the next than waste abilities just to kill it marginally quicker.
---
-afrer getting stormstrike in the talent go into resto. At 53 you should be able to get 3/3 of the increased hit % which is very good while levelling. Get the trinket from hinterlands if you haven't completed the quest for extra hit. Afrer that you will have very few issues with misses unless your weapon skill is bad or mobs are high level.
---
they just....kept doing...why wouldnt they stop...why...whyd they keep going...
---
For whatever reason on my server, thorium ore is selling for a higher price per ore than thorium bars. I have no idea why since smelting the ore doesn’t give skill ups.
---
So a run for a 3% drop where the only people going also want it making it around a 1% or less drop. 
---
Yeah, really reasonable.
---
I had a level eight last night that I decided I didn't like the name but then didn't want to deal with starting over. I don't get a lot of time to play so I guess at this point eight is my limit lol.
---
No, you did not, you pretended to answer it by giving an answer that doesn't make any logical sense.
---
Depends. Im on a full server and the priest books are still 100+g
---
Man, I've watched this whole series a few times now, and I love it. My memory is hazy... but I think it went downhill a bit after the Games-Con Arc. Especially the last season. The Games-Con Arc and earlier were great though! :D
---
Yes. This is why every Druid will train skill in his city and not Moonglade, that is easily accessible for Druids.  
---
Rep farming for Cenarion Circle come very late.
---
Warlock: fear is hilarious and OP as hell
---
How is pvping griefing?
---
came here for this
---
Oh wow really? Genuinely thought you didn't
---
What are your warriors doing on? No reason for a warrior to not be first in most fights.
---
i dont think you are understanding what i wrote very well
---
Not really. I just think its really idiotic that redditors and forum goers shit talk people who actually play the game. 
---
The game has been out for almost 2 months. You don't need to have poopsocked and totally no lifed to be in prebis and raid gear.
---
Uh, this video literally shows pvp within the same faction.
---
Epic, then you can make much more gold faster, and anyone trying to kill you with theirs now has trouble...
---
I took herb/alch, because pots really help with Leveling, but I'm a bit sorry to have left out bs, because shield spikes make tanking so much easier...
---
Massive burst dmg is always useful for PVP... 
---
Are you doing to be the best in duels... No.
---
Are you going to top the BG dmg charts... No.
---
Are you going to kill some squishes... Probably
---
Are there better specs.. Yes
---
\*shrugs\*
---
Battle Stance macro
---
* /cast Battle Stance
---
* /equip "weapon name here" no quotes, use this is using a 2 hander otherwise youll need to use weapon slot macros, see below
---
Defensive Stance macro
---
* /cast Defensive Stance
---
* /equipslot 16 Smite's Reaver
---
* /equip Burnished Shield
---
Reason I had to add the equipslot 16 is because the weapon kept trying to equip as an offhand which left me with just a shield.  /equipslot 17 is offhand, or shield. But shield will default to offhand so you can just use /equip
---
What do you expect from a DoT class with pets? Being AFK is part of their normal rotation!
---
5 points in spirit tap, 21 points to divine spirit in discipline, then 25 points in holy grabbing improved smite and your healing abilities , then 57 to 60 in holy as well. Smite hits hard and you have a decent crit rate with holy spells.
---
Basically holy fire pull, shadow word pain and smite a few times or wand them down. It's good enough for solo play even though not the best.
---
I purchased a charm. Never lost a roll since!
---
You just tried to argue that there are plenty of ppl who make unmoderated subs then conceded that they actually don’t exist and are moderated LOL. How low is your IQ? Like, you’ve always struggled in school/work, ya?
---
Inb4 you get roasted for not sitting in a city handing out water for 8 hours a day
---
331 runs here. 28 spawns of Gorosh. No chain.
---
Aren and angerforge take 12 mins~ when I timed it
---
I mean you better not do it on my server or I'm gonna come clap some cheeks boi
---
Sorry this is over your head. Just drop the thread if you can’t keep up. Fucking lemmings, lol
---
You drank a health pot though so, no props from me.  Not that I'm against drinking health pots in pvp, but seems like something you shouldn't do in duels unless agreed upon.
---
Oh I’m doing it on your server alright
---
If you love her, you gotta let her go.  Thanks for the memories G.  You are the only girl I ever loved.
---
I've had some bad eggs, and they really stand out in my memory. But taking a minute to think, I have dozens of runs without issues or with people owning up to mistakes.
---
Perspective is important to keep.
---
that made me laugh :)
---
You're a god and a scholar. I never would of thought of this. Wish i had more upvotes to give!
---
&gt; Behavior that intentionally detracts from others' enjoyment
---
This is the key right here, this action does not fit that description.
---
Regardless of how good it is having other trinkets is viable, OP is claiming they arentm having no trinkets is viable
---
How important is fear ward?
---
I like human priests for the spirit and rep buffs. But ive heard that if you're a dwarf with fear ward you can raid pretty much as soon as you ding 60 because its that valuable...
---
That's good for you I guess, but i've ran UBRS some 10~ times attuning guildies and getting rend loot without a single Reed. 
---
I agree that its not bad enough to opt out of, rend runs are fast and can honestly be done with 5 solid players at a really quick pace. 
---
HoJ is more debatable, but its BiS until Naxx for many classes, so its a hard sell not to pick up, even with its 3% chance.
---
haha my thoughts exactly when I was looking at him after
---
You on Grobbulus? Dont make me have to get on and Fly to Redridge and embarrass you.
---
What do you replace with after 55?
---
He's rarer. Around 8%. Ok'thor around 15% and everything else in the 18-20% range. 
---
Source: 331 runs so far.
---
it's literally the answer in the picture.  im sorry you don't understand it but Im not at work anymore and so Im ending all my reddit conversations.  bye
---
That makes their death much more satisfying
---
I thought they had just meant UBRS, since BRD doesn’t have skull/boss mobs (or maybe I’m forgetting)
---
Yeah dude I’m headed there now you’re about to get so totally owned dude
---
Alliance is just raiding Orgrimmar and they are friendly to us Horde. Meaning that you cannot attack them.
---
I am on a PvP server. Why is that? Bug?
---
This makes me thing of the group I had the other day in SM Armory that were basically jerking themselves off over how well the group was running, how big the pulls were, talking about their big dick dps.
---
I was the only person running a damage meter. No one was over 100dps. They were all mediocre at best and really not that great at worst. O could beat 2/3 of them with just Consecration and melee. If I didn't seriously overgear the instance with almost 150 healing power, there's no way in hell I wouldn't have been OOM mid-fight every pull with how slow those packs were dying.
---
Not a single world of encouragement for me, just buff demands. Keeping my mouth shut in that run was *hard.*
---
Jack of all trades, master of none? 
---
With this spec you might as well go full AoE. You won't be no where near the same damage as if you went full raid/dung spec anyways.
---
I mean it depends, yes, certain pieces are getting replaced relatively quickly, but something like the robe of the archmage will remain bis until at least phase 3 (so several months at least)
---
The gear can help you acquire more gold (or gear) faster, making it a decent alternative.
---
For me, I'm prioritizing robe, engi, and epic mount above all other gear/stuff because these things are gonna help me make more money (or do pvp which I love)
---
Oh okay.
---
Fuck around and find out
---
Okay, then answer me a simple question.
---
Why would you believe the word of a low level customer service employee over the word of the game director?
---
I don't believe you and im to lazy to get up to sit in redridge for nothing
---
No, I'm saying they don't exist because they don't work.
---
Please, try and keep up.
---
How is it pvp when your doing it to your own faction? Sure technically it is i guess but thats like saying that in a shooter team killing on putpose over and over again is ok because pvp mate
---
Statistical noise
---
Rogues have every tool needed to beat warriors. Hard CC &amp; control. Unless the warrior gets lucky with RNG, I cant see many ways a warrior will beat a rogue.
---
gold4win has invited you to a group .
---
Not that important unless you trying to join a hardcore guild.
---
I've never seen her go after whelp group in p3.  Only healers and dps attacking her before we figured out a strategy to transition more easily. 
---
Our tank is able to maintain control if he can gain rage from whelps and attack during p2, even if he is fireballed.
---
I have seen the same two hunter bots on my server. I have reported them multiple times. Seen a number of others as well. They are almost always hunter, tho I did come across a mage behaving much like a bot once. You can tell because he wasn't aoe farming XD
---
Anyone know a ball park price of Freezing Shard wand ? 
---
Boe,
---
Lvl34 mage only
---
Increase damage by frost spells and effects by up to 10
---
Haven't seen anything on the ah on my server 
---
Ask for a shaman in your group and have them drop tranquil air totem reduces your threat gen by 20%
---
Lol you just don’t want me to embarrass u hehehehehehe
---
Easy to get hit on ranged slot and ring.  If you’re already in BWL then it shouldn’t be hard to get onyxia pendant either
---
I don't see the need to reply to anymore, because you've said it all. And my line of thought is almost similar to yours:
---
I also don't see why it's weird to create the maps from walking a zone or by walking through real life. I can imagine the creative journey and a pleasure to the mind to map something. How were the first maps of anything made? By the creative human mind. Yes after thinking some more about my question it might seem a bit far-fetched, but I was just hoping he might combine in game experiences with drawing. I was just curious about the creative process..
---
"can't do that" "no enough rage" no idea how ppl don't go crazy with error speech on
---
Post a screenshot when you get there
---
It used to be everyone wanted full valor and that was it.
---
These kinda posts right here, mods.
---
I’ll post up on ur corpse hehehehehe
---
I mean, who wouldn't put some idiot running a mild joke to the fucking ground for an hour on ignore? I feel bad for the priest getting kicked like that.
---
&gt; Ony doesn't wipe threat at any point. 
---
She does though. Fireball target gets their threat completely wiped.
---
Same but with head, rolled a 98 beat by 99
---
Rep can be earned with a little bit more work, 5% spirit is slightly helpful for leveling and combat but hardly even noticeable honestly, fear ward will save your life and save your party many times in dungeons and pvp
---
If you say so
---
Fire blossom from trash packs.  Lava splash from rag. Annihilators.
---
Generally you want stats over spell power when aoe farming anyways. Proc is low enough that if pulling mobs correctly wont go off often but would still prob get in the way once in awhile. Best just use other rings as spell power scales bad with blizzard.
---
kinda just get used to it especially after playing for so many years lol
---
For me it's once they leave that first zone: Elwynn, Durotar, etc.

Depends. Are you full shadow tree? 21/30 and I’m still able to get around 35g/hr farming. My answer would be, you’re full shadow tree, then 45ish. If you’re only spirit tap in shadow, then 55.
---
Anyone got bag from a beast yet?
---
Or is a highschooler
---
Man I thought enhance finally got fun at 42 after picking up SS at 40. However enhance is very weapon dependent and can be a drag trying to get one. Like others said you can generally heal fine as enhance just start grabbing +healing or mp5 gear. If you wanna go for a switch I’d recommend going ele and healing with that. Then you’re efficient inside and outside of dungeons.
---
Hunters make great bot characters because the pet helps the bot with wayfinding and largely prevents death because it tanks for them. That combined with the small mana requirement for dps makes it a low downtime and safe class. In pre-bc, they were allll over the place.
---
Was the teabag necessary? I'm happy to be on pve server. If it is to experience the worst out of people in video games, no thank.
---
Why wouldn't you just get the icefury quest reward wand?
---
Sigh. You just ignored my argument. I’m saying they don’t exist because people don’t make them in the first place in large enough numbers to overcome the luck factor involved in subs getting popular.
---
The type of person to create a sub is not the type of person to want an unmoderated sub. You’ve yet to refute that point. You just keep ignoring it.
---
If you kill your team in a shooter, that goes objectively against your own interests, in this case it's in his own best interest.
---
If I undercut someone on the auction house so I can sell my item, is that griefing?
---
Found the alliance player bad at pvp
---
Well you know, at least he is providing something substantial and not just his own words and theories.
---
How would that work if WoD introduced personal loot?
---
True, but some people like bigger numbers (like me) and it's still not a waste of money even though it's probably going to be a bit worse than getting the mount
---
Yeah i respeced at 54 ran brd a bunch and got some healing gear from there and lbrs now i can heal just about everything but mc really in shadow
---
It's honestly pretty surprising how much damage a warrior can do with a random gun and low level bullets. I've killed quite a few mages and ranged classes that were trying to kite me with my gun. Shooting down pve mobs has kept it skilled up unintentionally, so it's pretty lethal when they are low health and you just need to finish them off. 
---
Even if you can't kill them with it outright, they usually panic and run away instead of killing you, like they would if you just sat there CC'd and doing nothing. Also good for interrupting bandages.
---
Its for pvp.
---
Because... That mage didn't want to open a portal for me, and I have a tool designed precisely for similar situations, and getting all butthurt accomplishes literally nothing?
---
In any case, you seriously need to chill out dude. It's a game.
---
In the zf farm you start with a nova so not going to be ready again when they are at your face after 2 full blizz.  Not to mention other mages going to mess that plan up.  Also you are going to break the freeze with flamestrike which is cool you'll slow them with coc... unless this is after a blizz and you are 3/3 blizz.  Then your coc won't slow them unless you wait it out, but should be almost done with fs cast time included, that means a stack of non slowed not frozen elites in your face.  Either way a mage can make it work, it's easiest to not think about it and know that your coc will get a full slow on in my experience.  If you don't agree cool, I tried both ways and I do like the extra slow blizz but I also like coc being a reliable slow without waiting for every target to get out of slow.  It's just a preference pretty much can't really say one or the other is wrong but op is going for a hybrid and is short on points so that is just one point that can be saved.  It's not a must and to some it's worse to put it there.
---
If you using rockbier an earth shock in dungeons will it generate a huge amount of threat?
---
Watch it again, they're not fighting.
---
Up you go
---
I need more of this
---
Plus when they put out tier .5 you will be able to upgrade it. Hopefully by then you have actual tiered gear but it’ll be fun to have anyway.
---
Another rolling screenshot...
---
Why do these keep getting upvoted?
---
it's very useful but if you've been doing dungeons you should easily have gear enough to raid when you hit sizty
---
mh?
---
You want to know what's substantial? The word of the game director claiming they added layering explicitly to increase server capacities.
---
&gt; so many casters wear +dmg/healing greens it's actually fucking funny.
---
It's called PvE gear.
---
&gt; it's fine though, i won't mind farming scrubs with barely 2k hp once honor ranks come out.
---
By then they'll have raid gear they got with that PvE gear, so good luck with that.
---
As long as your tank isn't crazy undergeared, shadow's fine for healing brd.
---
Any place you know where you can check those quests? Im planning to get the night elf mount on a gnome and would love for it to be at 40.
---
Preferably auction house, but vendor if you need to.
---
Get to know a blacksmith as well - there are some worthwhile daggers and so on they make, and you'll love sharpening stones.
---
Basically, except for a small number of 'bind on pickup' things, you don't need a tradeskill. You need to know people with that tradeskill.
---
Regarding alchemy, I'll just say one word. Mongoose. And two words. Healing potions.
---
no exaggration only facts that happens to me whats whiny about that?
---
I mean that's kind of on you for swapping to LC rofl.  Absolutely toxic garbage system.
---
If you're in a mage vs mage duel or something, sure but in some matchups it'd be unfair to NOT allow potions. If im vsing a good rogue as a shaman, if I don't have a fap I will lose. Im more than happy to let them use a health pot in return
---
Have you tried /join LookingForGroup or sitting in the SM area. I’d agree a lot of people might have moved past the farming level but should be plenty of groups.
---
You used to be able to in TBC with this macro:
---
`/cast !Cat Form`
---
That same macro no longer works the way it used to. It doesn't do anything if you're already in cat form.
---
Soon as you hit BRD dungeon farming is a good time to endgame respec for healing. 52 for golem runs is when I started.
---
Reed isn't but HoJ has a crazy low droprate.
---
HoJ is a very good example. I ran anger 98 times before I got it. Not everyone has that much time to sink between other shit you need to do in game.
---
Care to clarify the difference between the two?
---
Same thing happened 5 minutes later while helping a group of 2 Allies farming Guardian stones.
---
Wtf is a fpa? You mean fap?
---
I've been farming MC for weeks in that leather bis gear and I'm sorry but I have yet to die to those mechanics. I'm playing a DPS class not a tank, I'm going to prioritize DPS over survivability. Any DPS should be playing like this.
---
Yep let’s saturate this spot with more people. Gtfo
---
Windrunner
---
This has been "confirmed" several times a day for weeks
---
Well it's simple, if you're fighting other player it's pvp, if you're fighting non player characters its called pve.
---
pvp isn't "any time you compete with any other player" because otherwise rolling for loot or bidding on auctions would be pvp lol
---
He's trying to make the druid leave so he can farm alone.
---
Lets pretend for a second they were opposite factions, would you consider killing him be griefing?
---
Yo they made Hemingway from classic a real thing! 😂
---
Raptors are just as cool! I was originally planning on rolling orc then going for raptor but my friends were already well established on an ally server.
---
This is why you KOS all alliance scum.
---
If its agreed upon before the duel then sure, other than that...anything goes.
---
Itemrack
---
Listen close and don’t be stoned...
---
Haha that too
---
HoJ is 3% and the only folks that need Angerforge runs are doing it exclusively for the trinket. There's basically nothing in that run of value except for Savage Glad Chain and HoJ.
---
Reed, yes it has a higher drop chance, but it's also on a rare spawn that doesn't come up every dungeon, and Jed/rend runs are gonna be full of casters that need it.

According to this its H:55 / A:45
---
Really fun active realm, sometimes kinda big queu though.
---
Never argued that lockpicking was or not a profession. Simply stating that there are professions that can open locked chests and it's not just a rogue that can do it.
---
What makes you say I need to chill out, im very chilled, I just dont want to play with selfish people who think being an asshole is cool, as you just said it is just a game so I dont want to waste it on playing with people like that.
---
People with a brain should have HS in kargath, so as a mage im obviously gonna give the group a portal, I gain nothing from being an asshole who refuse to make one.
---
Must be the classic booty
---
Definitely a good place to start, and will give you a good baseline for other MMOs.
---
It's not like modern MMOs. The focus is more on the RPG part than the MMO part, so be sure you like RPGs first. It's done well enough that the people playing with you sometimes feel like characters in the game.
---
I have no other choice now. Lok'tar O'gar.
---
Yeah and it usually gets taken over and people are too stupid to understand what has happened and start blaming Blizzard
---
It sounds to me like you only get yelled at for rolling before checking with the party.
---
I wouldn't consider 5% crazy low or ultra rare myself.
---
It’s not really worth for pve because it’s almost 1000g for 2 rings. There’s slightly worse rings you can from dungeons and in MC you will get a much better ring.
---
Can't, password protected
---
is that a Ring of power on a ret paladin ?
---
&gt; Well it's simple, if you're fighting other player it's pvp,
---
He is fighting another player though.
---
&gt; pvp isn't "any time you compete with any other player" because otherwise rolling for loot or bidding on auctions would be pvp lol. Mining would be pvp lmao
---
That's exactly what PVP is.
---
you make absolutly no sense at all, I didnt say anything close to that at all.
---
Damn right! Plus they have a Shaman. That’s one of the best classes. Also easier quest line.
---
Cannabalize helps sustainability for farming humanoids, which are the best target to farm because of pickpocketing, gold, and cloth drops. Orc is definitely the superior race for pve and pvp.
---
If he was from the opposite faction he could defend himself so no.
---
On my server you can't join it without a password so everyone uses LFG instead since it's built in to the game.
---
Something that works on private servers but not actual classic?
---
I've seen your guild around and ran dungeons with them. I never would have guessed this as they all have been pretty chill. PM me and we can get you in my guild.
---
Yes Im a shaman.  Tank is using shield.  I dont down rank much but that doesnt seem to be the issue.  The main issue is I get aggro after I a few heals and my casts keep getting delayed when I need to put out big heals
---
Yes. So I mainly use windfury and frost shock in dungeons.
---
Rip out the pages and hide them throughout town
---
What's so great about it? I didn't see the original post
---
I didnt expect it honestly because he didnt have me attack a guard yet, they just went at...I think it was a hate crime haha
---
i highly doubt it. the only reason hunters are able to solo it is because you can bounce aggro between you and your pet. the king is too fast to kite. even if you could do it as a druid, it would be really, REALLY slow since most of your time would be spent running from platform to platform. especially if cho is shaman or priest, cause then he'll heal the king.
---
Horde has an alternative trinket in the hunterlands, but Alliance is straight fucked. Any melee basically needs to farm our HoJ, which is bad because ONLY melee que into the arena anger runs.
---
Is the adjustment really that bad though?  Like I've been healing BRD no problem and I wasn't even resto spec.
---
Hahaha imagine getting this destroyed and not knowing how to respond.
---
Another hunter went 12-2 just now in the tourney, getting #1. Oh thats 80% now in top 3. Yeah hunter is a top tier pvp class. 
---
You suck and you are bad. Why are you still commenting after being publically embarrassed like that though, embarrassing for a monkey like you.
---
&gt; you can use for your own or THE GROUPS benefit, so if you are in a group you use it for THE FUCKING GROUP.
---
Ish nu dal deanne
---
I like how you're ranting at me like I'm a problem player in this regard, but I play literally none of the classes in question.
---
I just don't consider myself entitled to the benefits of another player and their class.
---
Meh.
---
Get rid of Winter’s Chill unless you are the assigned Mage for your raid. Add another point to Improved a Blizzard and max out Improved Cone of Cold.
---
Wait? Did I just acquire power?! As a god I command you to hand over 7x Essence of Water.  
---
Worship me! Or face dire consequences! Dire as in, you will have to help me in Dire Maul West.  
---
Seriously, I want new pants.
---
Not sure what that post was about but I guess there’s some deep meaning
---
When you consider that the item is 3%, and all credible sources say 3%, and the only groupies you'll find also need it, yea nah. It will take most players a very, very large number of runs to see it.
---
He can defend himself here too.
---
None of this is verifiable. This is basically another "I got my epic mount!" post. Of which there are already entirely too many.
---
so true
---
One big example that stands out to me about how well-meaning changes can end up moving things down a bad path:
---
The dungeon finder was implemented at the end of an expansion cycle. It was introduced to a population of player who were mostly familiar with the dungeons and were also used to behaving well in groups. It was a fine addition to the game at the time.
---
Over time, the cracks in the system began to show. As players got used to this new type of dungeoneering, their mindset changed. They no longer experience consequences for bad behavior. They come to expect a fast, smooth run with chain-pulling and no need for communication. By the time Catalcysm heroics hit (a great time for WoW) players suddenly couldn't handle the dungeons that actually required effort. Mass whining ensued and Blizzard caved (listened to their customers) and nerfed the heroics. 
---
Eventually, the system created terrible situations such as: the only rezzer in a group dies, he doesn't know how to ghost run into the instance. The group has no choice but to disband because there is no way to progress. So Blizzard has no choice but to cave to that as well and start respawning people alive inside the entrance to dungeons.
---
At no point during this chain of events can you look at a particular decision and conclude it didn't seem to make sense at the time. However, in retrospect, it's easy to look back and say that Blizzard should have put their foot down and told players to suck it up. We don't deserve instant teleports to 20-minute dungeon clears that don't require communication. That does not make for a good game.
---
It ensures enough healers for the entire raid?
---
Ignoring the great cloth belt and healing trinket to suit your argument doesnt actually make your argument better. Saying jed doesnt come up every dungeon is super disingenuous as well and you know why. Once again you ignore the drops for other classes and the fact that Rogues Warriors and Hunters are all going to be interested in those runs also.
---
Easy enough diagnosis, none of us have good gear and they ran oom before me because they didn't downrank appropriately and overhealed too much.
---
That being said, my point stands. Having everyone expect you you to lose is awesome when you win.
---
Orbs are live side.
---
I did this yesterday on classic. 
---
Why are people still under the impression that reckoning isn't useable in classic? There are plenty of videos and streams that showing it.
---
Pretty sure troll&gt;undead for pvp spriest
---
My theory is that travel was the single biggest thing.  As soon as you can teleport in and out of dungeons just by joining lfg, or can teleport to and from BGs (yes I know it was in vanilla and I disagreed with it) it kills several things.  Sense of scale of the world, forced interactions (with mobs, players, and environment), requirement for coordinated efforts
---
It became closer to single player and this has a knock on effect
---
Had me in stitches, subbed!
---
Depends on the item. A tank druid will never replace warden staff. A cat druid will never replace Wolfshead healm. Im sure other classes have similar examples. Isnt lionhearth healm bis for all of vanilla too?
---
Yea i've noticed how much people preach down ranking but I've never really needed to.
---
Looked at the video you linked. 
---
His words:
---
"The first few weeks, when everybody is packed in to the valley of trials. When everyone is packed in to Elwynn. We think we can use sharding there in a limited, time limited way to solve the initial launch day load problems."
---
 Its there to give people a better experience by:
---
1. Minimise lag and rubber banding, just look what happens when people put together large pvp events right now, its a shit show. Hoping they will somehow fix this as it was way better on p-servers. 
---
2. Not having to fight over a few mobs (Still happened lol :))
---
I see how this is confusing with him using the words "load problems", but i feel that since he also mentions people being packed in one area it becomes way clearer.
---
Female horses don't have udders so why would a centaur?
---
Yeah.. I mean I find the video funny but I can imagine it might have been very annoying and if he just wanted to see what other people were typing he might have simply ignored him for clarity of the chatbox.
---
I'd love to see your sources on 3%.
---
I went there and invited the only other horde inside there for that quest. He declined, and I got the rod on the first mob I was killing while all this happened. I got out safely (this time)
---
Its 3% droprate, add in rolling against someone and the effective loot rate goes even lower. RNG is RNG. I have anecdotal evidence that counters yours but I'm not silly enough to bring it up like it's relevant.
---
I trick or treated before heading out with wife. Gone for hours. Still had debuff. Also had trick debuff still on. So I wonder if you have trick debuff or if to soon after doing it, it won't tick down. But I saw same issue.
---
Another reason not to play a pvp server.
---
So I'm quite happy with my current UI set up, but I am looking for a recommendation for an add on which can add my party member's targets to the default unit frames.
---
I've tried Shadowed Unit Frames which seems to disappear my entire party unit frames for some reason (not helpful) and Unit Frames Plus, which sort of does what I want except the buff slots reset every time you log out/in, meaning you have to enable &amp; disable them to get it to display properly.
---
Basically, I want to be able to see what my party targets at a glance. As well as their buffs &amp; debuffs ideally. But I'll take just their targets at this point.
---
Everyone knows to never pvp in neutral towns.
---
This is so true. The BiS lists all seem to place zero value on stats that improve survivability. We have the same dps’ers that constantly die on trash and certain boss fights because they are complete glass cannons.
---
I run a fury/prot spec so I can OT when needed and have zero dps raid drops but still often end up as highest melee dps just because so many of them die.
---
Boss has a cleave? Make sure I’m wearing as much plate as possible. High aoe damage? Make sure I don’t drop too much stamina. Fight has threat wipe mechanic and I’m having to hold back on dps, then prioritise gear that improves survivability. Chance I might end up tanking the boss for a short period (Onyxia) make sure I’ve got plate and stam and throw on a shield if I get agro on phase 3
---
Instead people just stick with their BiS gear as they don’t actually understand how to play their class or adapt to specific encounters.
---
Huh?
---
Viper Sting currently does NOT drain mana while you're in animal form. Only mana burns from NPC's work.
---
This bug has no effect on PvP.
---
Are we fighting now? Is this disagreement PvP? Lmao, you must realise how absurd you sound
---
as if scrubs know the difference. bis must mean best.
---
just go camp a dm entrance and see how fast people die.
---
but yeah i'm sure the majority of the playerbase is going to farm mc and ony on a weekly basis for the next three months.
---
Like a fucking catfish
---
It’s sooo much fun.
---
each run tooks 10-12 minuts
---
Yea, who actually has a sit macro.
---
Some comments: Art good as always
---
Other comments: Horse sex
---
You didn't actually show the spec
---
Wowhead’s BiS lists even include Rank 14 rewards. Yes, it is BiS, but imagine everyone going rank 14 to get them lmao
---
No. There were no BRD bosses that were level 62. Emp is the highest level mob at 58.
---
It's funny how carebear most WoW players are now. 6 days of farming isn't a lot. Go look at games like archeage, BDO and other mmos in the genre now. 12 hours a day+ of grinding the same mobs just to stay relevant. Then a guy says he grinded (roughly) 180 hours in the last month and a half, and you guys say "that's a lie!"
---
Holy fuck I thought classic would push the carebears away, guess not.
---
is it really that good? seems very RNG reliant and it's not good to only boost frost damage
---
This bug doesn't affect PvP mana drains, including Viper Sting. Only NPC's can drain your mana while in form.
---
It's a mild annoyance at worst. Definitely not the biggest bug in Classic.
---
Catering to carebears. The day they nerfed the original onyxia fight because literally no guild could down her.. That was the day wow began to die.
---
for what purpose did you post this here
---
Un'Goro turned me from a pretty passive and even friendly PvP person to someone who wants to see every Alliance player their dead at all times
---
Was fishing in the river near Tarren Mill when a same level 30 gnome warrior came close to me killing turtles.
---
I put a freezing trap down incase he statted anything and when he got close he ran through me and hit my trap.  I could (should) have killed him then but I didn't and it would have been an easy kill starting with him in the trap.
---
10 minutes later I'm outside the yeti cave when a mage attacks me while I'm fighting a yeti.  I'm almost about to kill the mage when douche bag mcwarrior fuckface (same war I let go earlier) charges in and they kill me.
---
So I run back, res and immediately attack the warrior (the mage fucked off somewhere else I guess) and kill him.
---
Never going to assume alliance arent pieces of shit when given the chance ever again.
---
You and me both, mate. You and me both.
---
Just look at the poor Diablo franchise.
---
The dps line at which one is more effective varies based on the rank, so dont take what I said as gospel, for what you're doing. The most important note you should get from it is that your average dps overtime with windfury will not suffer because you have a faster attack speed. You just wont delete something from existence with one hit every once in a while.
---
Addressing these issues, famed game creator Shigeru Miyamoto recently talked about the gaming corporation's shift from attempting to appeal to all gamers to their specific core audience. Speaking to Edge Magazine, Miyamoto had some harsh words for casual gamers, saying:  
---
"Their attitude is, 'okay, I am the customer. You are supposed to entertain me.' It's kind of a passive attitude they're taking, and to me it's kind of a pathetic thing. They do not know how interesting it is if you move one step further and try to challenge yourself [with more advanced games]. - https://gamerant.com/nintendo-casual-vs-core-gamers/
---
bite is not a must have you should choose between bite and claw, bite for wolves, claw for cat imo but you don't need both on your cat
---
Yes, do not use freezing band while aoe farming. It's not worth the risk
---
Lets entertain the thought for a second that it isn't pvp.
---
Is taking actions that negatively impact other players not allowed in the game?
---
Swapped at 52 when I started BRD.
---
If you’re using blizzard in ZF and not flame strike + CoC after nova for double shatter and then AE spam you’re doing it wrong...
---
Ok, frost nova the warrior and kite them with rank one frostbolts.
---
Wars have no way to even catch you smartass
---
FYI sometimes it takes *ages*. Bite rank 4 I learnt on like the 3rd use, Claw 4 took multiple uses on dozens (maybe over 100) mobs.
---
This subreddit is a joke. Im here to laugh at the stupidity of people.
---
it is, but if you are the healer and MC and some1 else takes dmg, you can‘t heal them :/
---
You'd be surprised how many "tanks" do this.
---
First time seeing a bugged mob?
---
It happens to be I’m no elite T-Rex that fears people. He’s a frost mage, I’m a rogue. Good luck killing a mage once you’re frost nova’d.
---
Good luck chasing a hunter in aspect of the cheetah
---
I said accurate.
---
3 warlocks in the world have rag logs above 700 dps, and i highly doubt you're one of them lol
---
People can’t read. “Defer to a caster” beyond that upgrades are upgrades
---
Reroll to full pop server.

---
That is a great way to look at it man! Appreciate the comment!
---
No gaming mouse, so many easily accessible buttons, no durability on gear, always have to be fully red, in fact, no gear at all because in the end it comes down to who spends the most gold on gear and enchant as well as dedicate time to raiding. The unwritten rules clearly state you have to duel naked at level 1, but in the end it comes down to who can afford a computer and who can't, or even a subscription. Throwing rocks at each other is the only fair way. 
---
But then again, it comes down to who have the superior genetics or who bought enough steroids.
---
Least to say, I don't like those "unwritten rules", if there are "unwritten rules" I want rogues to acknowledge they can't use vanish or blind, or even poisons because you need reagents and in the end it comes down to whoever can pay for those reagents.
---
Damn I can't stop, it's too dumb.
---
Ashenvale and Un’Goro basically.
---
Wow you sure showed me, my point is totally invalid now because i mistyped
---
Me-flavored water!
---
"Changes" themselves are not what killed the game, changing TOO MUCH is what killed the game.
---
TBC was great, commonly agreed as the best expansion. WOTLK was also pretty nice. It wasn't until Cata that shit started to hit the fan. Classes got homogenized to high hell. LFR was added. LFD was expanded upon and used for everything. Questing became hyper streamlined to the point of feeling like an on-rails guided tour. Like seriously, questing is just an endless loop of "do 2-3 quests in one area of the zone, move to the next area, repeat". It's boring and soulless. There's no exploration or adventure here, just endless repetitive bread-crumb quests.
---
Class homogenization is another big flaw. Blizz adopted a philosophy of "bring the player, not the class" and as such, classes got homogenized so that everyone can do everything. And when everyone is good at everything, nobody is special and all the classes feel the same. When everyone is super, nobody is. Yeah, Vanilla might have "bad" class balance, but that's what gives the classes flavor and makes them feel fun to play. Every class has their strengths and weaknesses.
---
Furthermore, gear is now bland and soulless as well. Everything is just "mainstat + stam + (random secondary stat)". It's like every single piece of gear is "Of the ____" gear from vanilla. Boring as shit. On top of this, main stats are so powerful that often times, whatever item is higher ilvl will be an upgrade. So you don't even have to think about gear anymore, literally just equip the highest ilvl item and you're good. Another RPG element removed from an MMO"RPG". And don't even get me started on Titanforging shit.
---
Just.....overall, retail WoW feels more like a 3rd person shooter with light RPG elements, than an MMORPG. They've streamlined the game to the point where nothing presents any kind of challenge or requires any kind of time investment. It's just go-go-go-spam-spam-spam-clear-clear-clear with no player interaction or communication or real RPG elements to it.
---
Same. I don't recall a single 19, though 21s happen. Sometimes energy ticks also skip and give you 40/41 on the subsequent, which is really freaky. Also, frequently enemies get off an attack on me after they are sapped or cheap shot. I can also proc poisons on sap. Many strange things.
---
I have LTP and had no idea this was a function, I'm an idiot. Thanks so much!
---
Negatively impact? No I don't think there's any way of actually taking something that someone else owns without their consent within the rules of the game.
---
You've probably done like 40 runs
---
Yeah post that breaks 2 rules at once gets removed big surprise.
---
Its in the title. Reckoning is the only relevant talent in this video
---
Aww yeah! Getting to fist a mage AND get paid for it? As a warrior? Hell yeah.
---
That's what you get ya carebear. Reroll PVE.
---
&gt; You think the 8spirit/15 heal Cath mace is better than the 31 heal BRD mace?
---
don't remind me.
---
i tried farming for it after that, but... it didn't drop again after another 10 runs. :(
---
Warrior McWarriorface got you.
---
Taking action is a different way of phrasing "do things".
---
Is doing things that negatively impact other players in this game not allowed?
---
In my opinion, it was inevitable.  The only way to add content to MMOs is adding new areas, raids, and dungeons.  The problem with this is that it makes the previous content less and less relevant the more content that is added.  Eventually so much content gets added over the years and you just have so much irrelevant content and the devs are forced to heavily streamline the game.
---
2 blizzards is often pretty much exactly the cool down of frost nova (assuming you have the nova CD reduction, which you should)
---
You can make weakauras displaying the CD of spells, choose any icon you want, and then have the actual spell on a hidden action bar with your keybind.
---
This. And atm going into the bm tree doesn't really help ur dps that much since ur pet is gonna die or be forced passive in just about every raid fight. Just did MC last night with my tribute run build and was always in the top 5 and #1 hunt
---
Can I get a list of working macros please?
---
My feign death/trap/pet passive doesn’t seem to work
---
I ain't homies with the no-changes crowd. I want duel spec.  
---
Doing anything outside dungeons/raids as holy is fucking slow.
---
i'm dipsy
---
Wtf does aoeing down the opposite faction have to do with this?
---
Oh god I’m on run 18 and this literally scares the shit out of me.
---
Fair enough
---
Me neither.. I said this in a Reddit post on here the other day and had a guy flaming me telling me there were in fact BiS lists and it was known what was best back in vanilla/tbc. No , just no.. there wasn’t
---
I can't think of anything you can do to negatively impact same server players. The competitive aspects within factions are limited to obtaining things you don't already have, rather than other players taking from you.
---
Conjurers hood is just +20 with no stats right? And whitemanes gives you 14 int and sp and some stamina? I would definitely choose whitemane's chapeau for any situation except dungeon runs where I will be primarily using single target spells
---
6 days? more like 2 weeks
---
Your favorite breakfast cereal is Corn Flakes and favorite sex position is missionary too huh?
---
Mage bwl trinket gives haste
---
&gt; It's a 15 year old game, every farming spot is known and documented already.
---
HoW dArE wE
---
Healers are just simply lower priority when it’s an item that dps need as well. You might be able to get away with getting to roll on robes of volatile power but I don’t see any loot council giving away mageblade to a pally before dps. 
---
More healing numbers are just simply not needed for clearing the raids at the moment while dps increase will lower the clear time will most likely be the rational of the loot council
---
Dinged 29 on lock. Had hoped to run BFD for that incredible wand, but not a popular dungeon. Time to start running Scarlet Monastery? How long is each wing? And finally, what loot should I be looking out for? Still rocking robe of moccasin and crescent staff...
---
I see..
---
So if OP isn't negatively impacted by this, what's the issue?
---
Look up spell coefficients. Armor rating is meaningless for a clothie my friend. Take what gives you power!!!
---
Allies have helped me before. That mage had no honor.
---
What pre60 levels are best to find groups for the endgame dungeons?
---
oh cool. I skipped that one, fuck looking for a million pages.
---
He's being denied access to something he wants access to, it's annoying for him but it's not PvP.
---
It procs a lot and it’s a 5 second stun that benefits from Shatter.
---
At what point do we draw the line of how valuable something is and should be rolled need. Why not just need roll everything at that point.
---
While leveling int/stam/spirit are more preferable to spell damage. In the late game raid context spell damage is king.
---
you said you pitied him for not being able to solo it
---
Oh yeah I'm sure.
---
I have fury tanks in leather gear in my group. I have no problem with that since they asked me beforehand and I am very confident in my healing skills and we can easily do this. But let me fucking drink at least.
---
Yeah, but Fàncy Jòhn has the fuckin Hammer
---
how about don't make political posts on a video game subreddit instead?
---
The game was designed in the early 2000s, kinda hard for them back then to anticipate the player base in 2019. Of course they increased server capacity, they even stated that a 2005 "full" is like a todays "low/medium". But the hardware is of course multiple times more powerful than 14 years ago. 
---
And since there were way too many players in at once, they had to introduce layering. 
---
[https://www.gamestar.de/artikel/wow-classic-layering-content-phase,3347913.html](https://www.gamestar.de/artikel/wow-classic-layering-content-phase,3347913.html)
---
Thats an interview with Senior Software Engineer Omar Gonzalez and Lead Software Engineer Brian Birmingham. In it they mention *"We want to shut down layering as early as possible, and at the same time release as many layers of a server as necessary." Vanilla needed to go to a store for the midnight release, buy the game, drive home, install, patch, and It was a natural way to get the players into the game more spread out, and in"* 
---
\^ This is google translated so the english is a bit off but the point is clear. 
---
And I think you know as well as I that they have removed layering from a lot of the servers. And the bigger ones only have a few left. As to why they haven't removed them completely, I dunno but neither do you so ask Blizzard. 
---
No amount of layers changes the fact that they are still running on the same hardware. 1,2,5 or 10 layers still work on the same CPU etc.
---
Lets pretend the server CPU is running on 100% workload. Splitting this to 10 layers means you have 10 instances using 10% each. Thats still 100%.
---
Try hitting the x key.
---
Where's your source? Attacking mine without providing one.
---
&gt; But it's not PvP, you missed out the bit after that where i said "but it's not PvP"
---
I did not miss out on that part, because it's irrelevant, as the point was made under the (hilariously dumb) assumption you are correct and it's not pvp and I asked you why it was an issue.
---
You then gave me a reason that fits nearly everything we can do in the game, so I don't understand why it's an issue in this case, but not in all of the others.
---
&gt; Here's a question, if any competition or negative interaction with any player is PvP why is it allowed on PvE servers?
---
Take a minute to think about this for a second, would the game function without pvp? No, they'd have to make it a singleplayer game. pve/pvp server refers only to combat, it's like asking "why are we allowed to kill mobs on a pvp server".
---
No pot rule didn't apply in Vanilla. #NoChanges
---
It says "blacksmith 225 required" on the item tho
---
just find a new guild 4head when most guild roasters are estabilshed now 4head
---
I have belledel
---
Things in the present can't feel nostalgic,  which is some, if not all of the charm for some people
---
Nobody really calls Dire Maul DM anyways. People always specify which wing.
---
You'd be surprised how many "healers" complain about being oom with 30% overhealing
---
The whole thing about using Retail as an insult like "Go back to Retail" is genuinely so cringe inducing. That's all my post was about. Pretty sure you're chatting shit too tho.
---
Yes the hilariously dumb assumption that PvP is PvP and not "everytime you have any Interaction with any other player ever"
---
Is sitting in the queue PvP? That's some great PvP content right? We should get honor points for it
---
The 'x' key togfles sit by default.

Some classes would definitely benefit more than others, for instance warriors could have mortal strike and death wish concurrently. Shamans could have an instant cast guaranteed crit chain lightning. PVP would become even more bursty with just 1 more talent point.
---
It’s not just a caster staff! It’s also the best weapon for any class that uses 2hers.
---
im only level 38, but so far Ive  put all my points in arms and use a 2h while questing.  Buy the tanking abilities and equip sword and board and you'll be fine for leveling dungeons
---
I was doing the mining rounds in Arathi when little shithead warlock, who was a few levels below me just starts casting on me at an iron vein. I'm not sure what he was trying to achieve, when I was happy to just ignore him, but feral druids tear through cloth wearers like a cat ripping up your toilet paper.
---
Leathers are so common lol, you can just farm them in dungeons too, not worth hoarding, I used to just vendor them
---
I think there was a dlc recently cuz my friends been mentioning mh lately and I'm like ????? But you won't try wow?
---
YOU CANT HELP STUPUD, AMIRITE?
---
Why would you pick someone else's name?
---
DPS should also remember bandaid spec. In Vanilla, it was common for healers to not even touch DPS in some occasions. You're responsible for your own survival. Dude probably had an ice block and was too careless to use it.
---
Fury with sweeping strikes would be another option
---
sorry to hear OP. this post makes me really glad I got mine on run 1. Sounds like aids grinding it out. Hope you get it on your next run.
---
I can't even imagine asking for water in a city. In an instance, sure I'll ask nicely and be very thankful to get it. But outside of that water is my responsibility.
---
When you mind your business and someone throws a fear at you... It’s not a good start.
---
I'm trying to fix this issue with an addon that keeps showing something like:
---
parser Creep Name MISS: Melee! | DODGE | false | nil | nil
---
I have Auctioneer, details, AtlasLoot, Questie, and a few others. Anyone know how to fix this?
---
VC\*
---
dont worry i got you, typos are ok
---
Don’t know about the other two but Ashbringer and Mograine are really balanced pvp servers, very close to 50/50. High pop too with max queue times of 20 min this week and that was during dire maul hype.
---
Mikehawkman 
---
Oof

Ah another hunter, learning how to hit need so he can roll on everything

Do you want SL/SL locks in classic?
---
Because that's how you get SL/SL locks in classic.
---
You can't criticize one mindset only to follow it up with presenting your own as fact. (I say fact because your "it's a game, nothing really matters" statement wasn't presented as an opinion, but instead a fact.) 
---
Different people have different mindsets. Some people run for upgrades, others run for fun. People should be able to run an instance for whatever reason they deem fit. You say it's just a game and gold isn't worth anything, meanwhile people have paid hundreds, even thousands in real currency for in-game loot. Hell, Blizzard themselves eventually gave you the ability to pay hard earned cash for gold. Clearly not everybody shares your mindset.
---
Are you timing it with energy ticks?
---
Yeah, I couldn't get SUF to work at all but a friend uses it and it looks roughly like what I'm after. Do they also have a separate UI add on too?
---
As a warrior, are there places/aspects of the game where you notice you are a highly populated class or feel some competition?
---
I’ll never be able to unsee this
---
It's okay kill the lowbies while you can since when honor rolls around we will be corpse camping you 
---
Sincerely
---
The Horde
---
It’s not even a misconception when it’s literally in the name.
---
When no matter how hard you try you still fail :-(
---
And people still think playing tanks is the shiet in classic. Try playing any healing class beside priests .
---
Yesterday was running tribute run with a arms warrior playing tank cuz our prot tank had to leave.
---
The man just put up a shield and charged everysingle time letting me no time to drink. On last boss he jumps over the platform los me and then instead of running the other way..went into the boss. He dies ofc , we kill the boss , gets the loot and says ‘your a bad healer’.
---
Thats it folks. So my experience is..dont play healing beside going with guildies
---
This gives me a great idea, I could help out low level warriors (and other classes who have it relatively tough) by boosting their confidence and giving them some gold.
---
Again, mythic is very different from heroic. Sure the bosses aesthetically look the same, but the strategies are mostly very different.
---
39 lock here, drain tank spec’d. What should my rotation be in dungeons?
---
Elevator boss is still the hardest boss even in 2019
---
Aside from locks it seems to be just a way to make classes more diverse and interesting without breaking anything.
---
Are gorillas actually bad pets? I used an owl on my first 60 hunter on thunderfury and I'm making another one on grobbulus and I feel like they'd be a good pet with bite/thunderstomp
---
Hey you are absolutely right! Of course there are those situations where you heal the DPS!
---
My tips were meant more as a general rule of thumb! :-)
---
Yeah, no there's no way anybody doesn't instantly rebind that key to something more useful, that's prime keyboard real estate
---
Simple, fill your toolbar with macros like this:
---
    #show Rejuvenation
---
    /cast Renew
---
The first line sets the tool tip and the second one defines which spell to cast.
---
First of all, why does everyone make the same “I’m not waiting 10 seconds for the tank!!” argument? For one, as I’ve said many times, the vast majority just want you to let them pull and have 1-2 seconds. The norm these days is the DPS don’t even wait for the tank to pull.
---
Second? If you don’t like the tanks pace then you go find another group, or you do it yourself. Maybe they’re bad and learning how to get better, that’s the chance you take with randoms.
---
Being a dick about it and making the runs unfun and stressful because “waaaah efficiency” is pathetic. Don’t do it.
---
always axe or chest :c
---
I do not know this exists. Please explain more.
---
Have to agree. I do the same thing or go farm something or do literally anything else if I’m getting griefed in whatever form it comes as.
---
For anyone else attempting something like this, I strongly advice not going through Ashenvale. Take the boat to Theramore instead, and swim from there to Ratchet, It’s a ridiculously safe (albeit boring) journey. Did it around level 7 as a human warlock, since I thought I’d be needing access to warlock/engineering trainers while levelling in Teldrassil/Darkshore. 😊
---
You horde deserve it. Helped a group of 3 horde kill an elite they seemed to have trouble with. As soon as it dies  you little shits gank me.
---
Damn If they had cardboard signs you would be holding one standing next to the flight point beggin for gold!
---
Yep. I don't understand why that counts as an aggressive spell...
---
To people saying tiger is better, that might be true, but its vastly more unique to be a night elf on a non-tiger.
---
Yeah it is built in.
---
That was really funny
---
I would greatly appreciate it if you shared it :)
---
Yeah that’s exploiting pathing lmao.
---
People say this about cata all the time but I feel like the quests and stories of each zone were awesome. Cata fell down as soon as you were out of that experience and forced into choring and waiting for raid resets. I left when they pulled the new 5 m an in favor of more daily quests and raid content (my fully geared pre-raid BIS shaman couldn't get a raid slot, even though I was topping DPS meters and better geared than almost anyone in the guild). There was nothing to do so I quit.  
---
I think one of the advantages of classic in endgame is that 40 man raids (as opposed to 10 man) have a lot of space to let people come in and do their weird thing, so you can at least see the content and have something to do. Also a lot of other things but that is a big deal. Daily chores are not fun, especially when they never move anything forward.
---
That. Is. Awesome. lol
---
I think some aoe heals like circle of healing or chain heal only affect group members.
---
Never even played retail lol
---
If you use the rigth macro and do some research it works it is just not as straight forward
---
Keep in mind this is a company that thinks they lose subs because people no longer have time for the game cause we are older and have kids and jobs. Also the same company that thought we did not want classic to begin with. They are out of touch with what their customers really desire. Hell I mean look at last blizzcon, the only announcement of a new game period was Diablo immortal and that was supposed to carry them. At this point it's all about the money and we are just expected to like and want whatever they want to put out to make that money.
---
Netherwind?
---
I have to disagree with dm not being as good as Mara, I used Mara to farm my epic mount and DM has become my farm of choice. From my experience they both give roughly 30g per hour, Mara might be a little higher at 30-35 and dm 25-30 in vendorables. But dm has useful herbs that go on the ah for much higher as drops and spawns in addition to sellable blues/greens such as travelers backpacks, essence of life and book spawns.
---
An extra note too don't follow oozes guide for Mara blindly he solos rotgrip on a private server where it can be blackout stunned and just tank n spanks it, on real classic he is immune to blackout and you will need to kite him.
---
i thought the same haha this is awesome!
---
HOJ is boss though, its something you can wear deep in to BC as it scales like a monster.
---
I was thinking just being able to put 3 points into Elemental Devastation while still getting stormstrike would be very good for enh without breaking balance.
---
Thank you for this
---
Anyone saying you can just look in game has never done back to back onys
---
If not resets Thurs, then it resets again Tues morning with MC. That means between Tues raid days there's a lockout and many people miss it due to the confusion behind ony timers and the lack of a clear reset time
---
Don't let anyone say this isn't needed. Thank you for making this it's appreciated
---
I was hoping that someone way smarter than me could calculate exactly what the odds were of this happening like it did
---
Instant gratification mentality mixed with participation trophy mentality
---
Watch this shit happen post-classic... erm never.
---
Ian also specifically said this is an integral part of the vanilla experience.
---
&gt; You have no recourse here and you knew it. Therefore you had two choices:
---
How is killing the warlock not a recourse?
---
Not CH at least, but unsure about priest.
---
Mages don't get blink until level 20 LUL
---
I don't understand anything here
---
We are witness
---
I remember how good it felt to beat TBC dungeons, because they were actually hard. Then doing the heroic dungeons was like "holy fuck how is this even possible?!" But eventually you beat them.  
---
I logged onto retail and used my char boost on my paladin tank. Went into dungeon LFG, instantly popped, and went into the dungeon. No one talked. Everyone just GOOGOGOGO NOWNOWNOWNOW without waiting for me and there were no consequences, the dungeon didn't really need a tank at all. Pretty much killed my interest right away.
---
False, I got fireballed 4x in a row this week.
---
Had a togue vanish my blind the other day. Pissed me off.
---
I'm overcome of joy from this masterpiece.
---
And she does do this... 4x fireball this week to my dome.
---
DM or VC who cares! Deadmines also works
---
Fights are so short that rng is huge.
---
For consistency faster weapon is actually better with windfury because sometimes the mob is at low health and then you massively overkill it with windfury.
---
Yup, you're right I found out shortly after I posted
---
It was at this moment he knew, he fucked up (in character creator)
---
(Laughs in Warlock)
---
This.......... Who eats up prime hot key real estate so they can sit?
---
I, Gamon, will save us.
---
Alright dude you know what, lets just agree to disagree to be honest. This is starting to take too much time and energy.
---
We have this blue post that you choose to not believe as its a "lowly GM" even though its a very clear explanation of what layering does and he states he did his research. Your beliefs can obviously not be changed so i'm not gonna keep trying.
---
Same. I tried doing the panadaria zones and it just was the worst content I've ever seen in wow. So I tried doing the next expansion content and it was just a bunch of random shit going on and I felt like I was riding through the old school Hall of Presidents in Disney Land. Nothing I did mattered, everything was on rails, and it was just me meeting random big name people who had enough power to crack the world in half before, but now were afraid of a few dudes with blowguns in the jungle.
---
I'm glad you liked it  🙏  🙏  🙏
---
You seem like a fun person
---
Strange, what route did you get? 1st time I saw  sw as night elf was after exiting the tram.
---
It doesn't have to be a specific addon but any addon that has HealComms library integrated, such as Grid2, HealBot, Luna unit frames (I'm sure there are more). This library allows the healers to passively communicate their healing actions to others, so yes, you're only going to see the incoming heals from a person if they have somethjng with LibClassicHealComm.
---
Same faction I think
---
Go to an innkeeper at an inn and choose trick or treat. If you are lucky you get a treat bag which can contain a mask. You can do this once every hour :)
---
*Ricardo flick*
---
SUF? Nah everything you need is installed with it, just have to tinker with it for a while. (If I’m understanding your question)
---
Is it really that weird that my views cannot be changed when your proposed reality leaves open so many questions you can't come up with a possible answer for?
---
Uncanny
---
The guild rule of requiring a person to submit a fromal request TO NOT PLAY A VIDEOGAME. Honestly, if you don't understand what's wrong with that, there is no helping you.
---
I love this guy. Found him a couple weeks ago and every fucking video is hilarious.
---
Sure, as long as you’re not buying it
---
I think the changes they made worked to an extent. That's why BC and Wrath were so popular. But the game reached a tipping point where too many changes were made for the sake of change. Too many system were introduced and then scrapped for other systems no one wanted. 
---
There's no one defining sweet spot, as that'll vary based on opinion. But I think most people say it's somewhere between vanilla and wrath, and we're definitely so far past it with BFA that there's no going back.
---
Hunters have tons of tools. When someone attacks you can respond a variety of ways to interrupt them and take control. you can feign death and drop freezing trap, eat up, then pop rapid fire and aimed shot. Scatter shot has a lot of versatility as well. concussive shot and wing clip (and aspect of the cheetah) let you kite, and viper sting can remove a large amount of mana. Raptor strike with a 2h can finish people off, and wing clip can be used at the same time. If you can manage having less mana efficiency, improved concussive shot is hilarious when it procs, especially if it happens multiple times in a row. Also flare to unstealth rogues (and feral druids), as well as fear beast to fear shape-shifted druids and hunter pets. I'm probably forgetting something, and engineering/consumables are another whole world.
---
It wasn't part of any melee dps
---
Tank was going to shard it anyway. 
---
Not to mention it’s relevant for PvP with the armor and Stam values. Or if, you know, you want more warriors who can tank 5/10 mans because they have decent enough plate to do so rather than having 5 fury wars in LFG for a tank.
---
I've tried to follow the Lore over the years but as an old school horde player, the whole "Thrall is just gonna randomly give up being Warchief and give it to someone who is obviously a murdering lunatic" bothered me, and then it just went totally to shit, and then they followed it up by completely ruining the character of Sylvanas.
---
Retail sucks.
---
You understand he's in an area that contains mobs right?
---
Brb rerolling rogue
