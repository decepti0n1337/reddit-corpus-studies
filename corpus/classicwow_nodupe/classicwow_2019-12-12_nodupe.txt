At least use proper grammar if you’re going to do this.

---
No raiding. Tanking 5 mans, healing 5 mans, aoe farming with my mage friend.
---
You can pick it up outside the portal but the turn in is inside the base.
---
...Because there is extremely high demand for the exalted rewards. Once all of the PvEers get exalted, there will be a significant decrease in demand, changing the formula as queue times grow exponentially.
---
blue pvp reward doesnt require as much effort  
---
personally i dont care if its 50% faster for the rep to bum rush drek vs 3 time more honor, the rep is already fast enough for me
---
well blame everyone who yelled out NO CHANGES
---
I can see where they are coming from, doing your own thing away from the team and contributing to a loss is not ideal. However, id also really like to have some actual fun in AV, do all the quests once just to see what they are about, and enjoy a little bit of an all out 40v40 pvp brawl.     Perhaps once the min/maxers get the rep/honor they’re grinding for I’ll get to enjoy that.     But for now I guess both sides of the argument make sense to me.   ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
The first faction to kill Belinda/Galv gets the honor/rep while the other gets none.
---
Horde usually have a ton of people immediately go in and kill Belinda, meaning Galv is a waste of time for Alliance. It seems like the best method is to simply kill lieutenants/commanders on the way to Drek, which a small squad can do without adding much time to the BG.
---
It used to sometimes last a day.
---
Bro I feel it. Shitty factory job working 12 hour shifts for just enough money to pay the insane cost of living, and a bit left to save. But WoW Classic time? Nothing quite like it.
---
So the don’t play?
---

---
Actively griefing when you could simply not queue up is sociopathic.
---
Thatll work until rogues start remembering to use expose armour.
---
Haha, that's so cool. With castsequence macros I could see it having a lot of potential.
---
Zul'farrak. Your next leveling area is BRD at 54.
---
Your definition of skill is somewhat odd. You're suggesting if something is scripted it doesn't take skill to over come it? A dancer's performance requires no skill because it all scripted?
---
If skill does not exist in PvE (Mainly retail as that is where challenging content is), then what is the difference between the top guild and a average one?
---
It's the people who changed, Classic wow isn't going to fix how people play the game now.
---
This was me last night.
---
Me: walks up to bank. Notices orc INSIDE banker area. *surprisedpikachu.bmp* So then I proceeded to jump in myself and my brain just low-key exploded.
---
No
---
All the other plays on words too, like the Turtle escort quest where he's lost, his name is "Torta" and the wife's name is "Tugah"..  Tortuga is turtle in spanish/portuguese if I remember right..
---
av premade exists
---
Are you on Herod? 
---
I am.
---
I have no idea wtf you're talking about.
---
You should do questing and run each dungeon at least 1-2 times for all the quest. They give really good exp. Google which quests are available for the Dungeons, some are hidden behind prequests and cause of that not sharable!
---
That's false. You dont have to min max to accomplish stuff, you just want to. Then you blaming external factors to make it seem like you're some helpless puppet.
---
Cant remember correctly but i think you'd need wolf riding unless you're an Orc.
---
[removed]
---
Yes.
---
What fish are you getting in av?
---
Said "player not found" around launch when I tried this.
---
Aada
---
It is a symptom of how gaming has morphed from early 2000s to today. I will tell you a couple of reasons why.
---
People have this expectation to min/max these days. They do it with everything, including single player games. 
---
 Part of the reason is the modernization of single player games where they are used to wasting no time in going from point A to B with quest markers. Another reason is some games are so long that people with a life have to be efficient in order to just beat the game. So they don't dive into the world, they just complete a checklist, which can be fun. You see this in games like Skyrim, Ubisoft games and stuff like that.
---
Another reason is people feel like they need to play every critically acclaimed game that releases. So they can't waste time in the games they do play, and they just want to blow through the content as fast as possible. This is part of being an adult, as a kid you have limited resources in the games you get, so you have to enjoy them. As an adult your limited resource is time. For example, when I was a kid I must have beat Ocarina of Time like 15 times or a game like Prince of Persia (Gamecube) like 10 times. 
---
So because of these things, people are always looking at the goal rather than just playing a game and having fun. The goal is usually completing the game or to get higher competitive rank in some game, or in WoW's case I guess honor. Nothing else matters, when in games the journey is really important. Like if you don't enjoy the grind, it might be ok to "force" it for like an hour, but not for 20 hours.
---
Lastly, developers show with short patch cycles in games like League of Legends that you better use the meta build quickly or it will be replaced by something new in a few weeks. Instead of players learning how to counter such things, they wait for devs to fix things and that leads to constant imbalance.
---
It took me a bit, but I overcame my desire to play as many games as possible, beat as many games as I can, because eventually I just won't remember the game anyways if I blow through it. I play games that I want to play and games that I enjoy. Start another game of Civ VI? Sure why not? Like right now I am playing through KOTOR 2 for the first time. Taking my time and enjoying it.
---
TL;DR: People don't enjoy games for the gameplay they have and the journey, they care way too much about the goals in the end, competitive rank or the reward. A quick patch cycle of games today discourage people from innovating and playing things naturally, and cause them to look up stuff quickly.
---
Yeah a lot of people in my guild want to rock AV and grind it out that way. A group of us made a WSG premade and had the time of our fucking lives. We clear MC in 2 hours then go back to WSG. It’s too much fun, especially as a rogue.
---
Lol truth
---
TIL teabagging is savage and cruel.
---
Seems how i recall, it was always janky
---
But that requires more coordination than a pug can manage.
---
With PUGs, you have to expect everyone to do the same objective.
---
Easy I hate myself, and I keep putting myself in Antifun situations so I can hate myself even more.
---
how about hanlon's razor instead:
---
"Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity."
---
Ignorance is bliss
---
EU or US? Because when playing solo queue, I certainly had more games where Alliance still rushes Drek, ignores all Lieutenants and most of the time fucks because they end up pulling too many elites in Drek's room, wipe without having any GY apart from Snowfall (yikes) and the game turns into a 30min turtle. Sometimes it works and we end  the ends the game with 900 honor, and everybody is like "yea another win, this is great". So I started to queue with two friends (Warri, Priest, and me Mage) and we just 3-manned every Lieutenant while the rest ran through to Drek.
---
HoJ is pretty easy to get tbh, and is amazing. LH is a lot harder to get but you will never replace it.
---
It did. It was put in place because before that there was no way to get rid of real AFKers.
---
Haha :) hence why I added the ‘preface’.
---
because they're a bunch of fucking losers
---
Yeah.  This game needs some minor tweaks in more than just this situation.
---
For what it’s worth, if you’re in a mythic+ when it starts you are eligible for loot when the final boss dies; dcs, kicks, and leaving be damned. You get your goodies in the mail if you would’ve had a drop.
---
I appreciate that, it's been so long it'll be nice to get back in the swing of things with someone. I'll be on tomorrow,
---
Damn I really screwed up not doing legion, i've always hated that people could pve for better gear than me, and I hated having to gear out a character that then becomes useless with one patch. PvP vendors were tons of fun though, and you could still outgear people while not needing to be a no lifer to do so
---
&gt; make yourself feel better
---
cause I'm salty.
---
I had a 19 rogue twink by the name of Hindenburg on Aggramar
---
It definitely is the same as Vanilla.

If you can't afford a Skullflame Shield, you could use  [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13243/argent-defender](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13243/argent-defender) with a shield spike, or  [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13375/crest-of-retribution](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13375/crest-of-retribution).

---
You seem toxic as fuck
---
what percentage is rank 12? 1%?
---
The vast majority of players in Vanilla never came close to Rank 14. Most of them were perfectly fine with that. Not every possible achievable thing in a game needs to be something everyone can get. If you can't accept that I honestly don't know what draws you to Classic.
---
That's pretty much what I was saying. I like to come on here and browse when I don't have time to play, but seldom have anything to contribute, because I'm mostly happy with the state of affairs.
---
I'm just worried we're never going to see TBC because of the vocal community.
---
No, blame everyone having jobs, and less time.
---
That shit is funny though. Dumb ass noobs lol
---
pservers replicated the original versions of AV and people still used the rush META it was just a little bit harder but still short zerg games no different than this.
---
It's not the design its the players who figured out the best way to benefit from AV.
---
Theyre never going to change it to anything that wasn't like Vanilla so no point complaining.
---
Your rant is on point.
---
Imagine how terrifying that must of been to witness that accident.
---
They changed it to 10g at some point can't remember when.
---
A horde warrior complaining about and alliance warlock? i cant have any less pity for you than i have, its impossible. stop whining
---
Not a complaint
---
Is this post not the pot calling the kettle black?
---
That's what RBG's were for
---
Hi erect.
---
It is true that the mega servers are a big change. But that is not a mechanical change to the rules of the game.
---
It will be really hard to be one of the first people to rank 13, since it's based on what percentage of the population you are for honor and rank.   There are just so many people attempting to achieve it. 
---
But your rank declines if you don't work to keep it up, and once you have the title and gear, there's no reason to keep it up.   So people will fall off and new ones will go up.  If you keep at it religiously, there's a decent chance you might get it come spring or summer. 
---
Even then though, you're going to be dedicating some serious hours.
---
Wow I didn’t know it worked like that. Back in BC there was an add on that you had to stand next to the battle master and it would que everyone in the party at the same time. I kinda figured they used a different more random system this time around.
---
Any chance you’d upload your controller layout?
---
What
---
Just derp around and fight horde.  They won't be able to kick you and they won't have your help on drek.
---
Not even the same person you've been replying to
---
Vanilla wasn’t designed to start in 1,12 either. This isn’t vanilla. Some people, like you, just can’t comprehend that. You aren’t happy because you wanted a hamburger and you went to dominos.
---
Wotf does nothing when the warlock can 100-0 me in a Conflag &gt; Shadowburn combo.
---
People care about the rep more than the honor
---
Fellow poopsocker here
---
The more the match is dragged the higher the chance horde will win.
---
I mean you do seem pressed. So maybe stop acting pressed if being called out for being pressed upsets your sensibilities.
---
If I could redo it over again I'd 100% make a warlock for easy High Warlord but I'm not doing 1-60 again.
---
&gt;C'mon dude. Doubling down doesn't somehow trick people into overlooking how much of a blithering dickhead you're being, you do realise that right? 
---
Calling replies stupid is being a dickhead? I mean, you called me stupid, so that's much worse, right? 
---
&gt;Literally everything you had spelled out for you was found in the main msg from OP.
---
Nothing I said is in there. Literally nothing. 
---
&gt; and that other people were taking the piss out of ya?
---
So you are now agreeing with me that those *2* people gave stupid answers? Are you for real? 
---
&gt;Most people were able to extrapolate any gaps in the information
---
I thought everything I said was in the OP? Can you decide what you are trying to say? 
---
&gt;they did it without getting upset too
---
Only one getting upset is you though. 
---
&gt;Because ya know, they're not dumb angry dickheads haha.
---
Again, insulting me is much worse than calling a comment stupid and unhelpful, right?
---
What was the point of covering up Bommi - Mandokir ‘s name?
---
I agree this would be fun but right now I just want that sweet sweet purple ring man
---
hero
---
Yeah 100% back in vanilla my step dad and I got his warrior to 13, he played 3hrs in the early morning, I'd play 3-4hrs after school then he'd play another 2-3hrs before bed.
---
How is a 2.5 hour AV fun? it's mindless turtling.
---
It's just as boring with next to no reward.
---
The only way to play AV is get exalted then go play WSG and never look back. It was like that in Vanilla and it's the same now. It's just not a fun BG in any form.
---
For you to have a 60, and multiple 40’s, even assuming a modest 15 days/played, it means you’ve played on average 4+ hours/day.
---
I know personally, between going to the gym, socializing, networking,  reading work and family, in left with 4-6 hours/week to play at most.
---
I think a lot of us knew the population wasn't ready for this game to come back, but to be fair if we had this extent of communication with blizz back in 2004 we probably would have bitched too.
---
New to the game I see, yeah the caster ring isn't in the game yet. Sorry bud
---
This hits soooo close my thoughts on the game. The same people crying about the bad stuff are also doing the bad stuff! Just enjoy the game and don’t be apart of the problem.
---
Alliance warlocks are broken. Blizzard completely overlooked balance when they decided to put paladins and warlocks on the same faction. Nothing is more OP than a Warlock with holy paladin support.
---
&gt;Idk about those stats but seemed like it was pretty common based on all the “just got both bindings” posts.
---
How many people are posting "I didn't get/see a binding" after every raid? One of those is going to far outweigh the other.
---
Hi, completely happy on PvP here.
---
Gaming subreddits are now full of a vocal majority of feckless whiners. It's hilarious how much of a circlejerk reddit is. (Not you, just in general)
---
Lol hoj "easy* 
---
Cries in 100 angerforge kills
---
didn't they say it was originally added in a later patch?
---
The long turtle AVs are the fun ones too.  And the rep and honor rewards for long AV's actually aren't that bad.  I had a 41 minute game give over 1000 rep.  I would have probably gotten in ~3 zergs in that same amount of time, which would have been ~1200 rep, but infinitely less fun.  
---
Those long push and pull battles are awesome, getting out of there with over 200hks doesn't hurt either.
---
It depends on what you consider fun. I'm not sure how this is a problem. You have fun, this is a great thing. I have fun also, also a great thing. We probably wouldn't have fun being in the same raid team, and that is also fine.
---
Thanks, I was getting 5fps when I zoomed in on myself with the WSG flag carrier gfx effect. 60fps again now, and you've fixed a guildies game as well.
---
It's blizzards fault because the game is tuned incorrectly. Players do too much damage vs too weak NPCS - this is not the players fault. AV is almost totally empty compared to its original version and the mobs that are there are empty shells. I shouldn't be able to practically 1-shot seasoned guards at the graveyard flags with multi shot but here we are. My team still had like 9 people kill drek w/ all towers up while others were trying to have fun camping middle, that should not be possible.
---
It is , and it isn't.   
---
With just 1.12 talents, yea everyone is a bit weaker with 1.1 items. And on private, bosses were a bit harder and tuned up as well.  
---
But in the end, MC is still easy as hell for competent people. BWL was tough for many guilds on private, but also very easy for others.   
---
There are casual guilds out there still unable to kill Ragnaros, taking 2.5 hours to half clear MC.   
---
I expect that despite the gear improvements, you will still see good guilds breeze through content and bad guilds struggle. I don't think its that different from private because of the items really.  
---
But we will see how easy BWL ends up being.
---
Some of the most fun I had playing WoW wasn't the dungeons or the gear. Its was getting up to clowny shit with my friends. 
---
Playing bodyguard to Alliance members questing as a horde.
---
Starting a ruckus in general chat about someone stealing my ore node that I stopped mining to heal a person about to die nearby.
---
Naked Warrior Duels.
---
Exploring and Climbing out of Bounds.
---
Making a train of people wearing simple linen dresses and run through Org.
---
Blasting through low level dungeons to farm green items that I wanted the whole set because it looked cool (pre Xmog).
---
Now peeps invest so much in it that they're fun sucking grumplords that need to get over themselves.
---
There's literally a discord for warrior discussions. Fight club is a better resource
---
Of course I understand that but you shouldn't have the ability to remove someone from the game lmao
---
I mean, you aren't required to know any of this just bc other people pretend to.  I have more money than I could ever spend, with 100% comfort, but I still enjoy playing wow.  I still travel and go do stuff, but wow will always be a part of my life
---
What do you think originality looks like in a 15 year old game?
---
Well, in the current AV vs WSG situation, the proportions are different. AV seems like 80% more effective, then 80% less fun doesn't look as bad...
---
He is saying people who min max used to be the minority, where as now with popular streamers / content creators almost everyone is min maxing. He never said it did not exist. Your guild creating some shitty Ragnaros timer doesn't mean you are the majority.
---
I've tried DBM and Capping and neither work, so at least I know it's not just me...
---
I saw a streamer with working timers. No clue which addon.
---
I would claim its the changed version of it. I dont know for certain but im fairly sure the marshals and vanndar/drek dont have any buffs related to eachother, which makes this  a cakewalk... pull them one at a time and kill them.
---
I recall doing AV heavily in TBC or a little later and it was literally impossible to kill the last boss without clearing atleast 2 bunkers (because they  buffed eachother, the meta was to kill 2 towers and then go for boss... while preventing alliance from doing the same). Now it  seems that even with all bunkers up we can just kill them one at a time if we have enough players there.... so its essentially a zerg race.  
---
I cant remember what we had pre-1.12 in AV but if we had more powerful elites and the tower bosses in the last boss room then it would most certainly stop the zerging, excluding premades with full raid gear... most games arent against premades anyway.  
---
Ive done about 20 matches today, didnt count tho... and i only faced ONE premade, every other game was against randoms and lets say 85% of the matches were zergs. The rest of them were half-zergs with a wipe on either side or  then the most fun one ive had so far: 40+ minutes of pure PvP.  
---
People at this point are at most rank 8, (maybe a few rare ones are rank  9 or 10... prove me wrong, ive yet to see anyone  above those) which means minmaxing honor is stupid as you dont need to do it to reach higher ranks...  just have fun playing the game.   
---
If you ever reach rank 10 and beyond, then you should worry about minmaxing honor gains tbh. There were a couple people (the loudest ones ofc) in that 40 minute AV match who whined alot.
---
One of them literally said "wtf you  doing this isnt PvP", when it literally was PvP...  its not pvp when  you zerg the boss, but it actually is pvp when you fight other players (its called Player vs Player for a reason)... how can anyone be that stupid? :D
---
Anyway those guys left and the end times was alot of fun pwning allys and we ended up winning.
---
I understand people who dont have the time to grind alot and want to do it efficiently to get the gear... but if you are doing it because you dont  have enough  time to play, then youll never reach rank 14 let  alone rank 13 anyway... and that kind of minmaxing was never required to reach most of the other ranks. 
---
Oh  well, its a bliss turning off the battleground-chat for the most part and enjoying the pvp that unfolds. Its a game after all... enjoy it.
---
He really does suck
---
Re roll to an RP PvE or a low lol RP PvP realm it's a lot less pure tryhard and more "for fun", which I imagine is more like a vanilla experience.
---
I didn't think I needed to make that distinction because I didn't think it was complicated!
---
with the backside jump, skipping the bridge and all the elite in the alliance base you can rush the boss faster then the alliance in theory.    
---
I solo tapped the alliance main base graveyard quite a few times this way.    
---
If just more then 1-3 would follow this call.    
---
Well got placed with my guilds maintank in the same bg twice, we won both going there asap and asking for a healer and random dds to join.

Private server players are the fastest levelers.  You clearly have no idea what you’re talking about.  Unironically get good.
---
They look at reports and watch the bots too learn the scripts and patterns to further their detection AI against botters is their reasoning
---
I tie it in part to changes in gamer culture over the past fifteen years - obsessive competitiveness, min-maxing, optimization above all else, etc. You can see it in how players have reacted to everything from class choice to PvP.
---
Since there are no successive patches and the state of all classes is fixed in 1.13, you see players overwhelmingly picking the most "optimal" classes. Mages are more "optimal" as ranged dps and outnumber both hunters and warlocks across servers; priests are more "optimal" as healers and outnumber paladins/shamans and resto druids; rogues and warriors are played more heavily for the same reasons.
---
Similarly, forming gank squads, targeting lower level players who couldn't fight back, camping BRM, corpse camping, etc. were the most "optimal" ways of farming honor in phase 2. Now that AV has been released, zerging the enemy general without even trying to engage the other team is the most "optimal" way of getting honor.
---
I'm still enjoying Classic, but the approach of a lot of players seems to be this aggressive - even anxious - rush to wring every "optimization" benefit from new content as quickly as possible (new gear from the honor system, etc.).
---
Honestly, if everyone slowed the hell down as a whole we'd be having a lot more fun. Hopefully the community will unglue their foot from the accelerator a bit with time.
---
I've got smaller problems and i live for raid days. Helps me forget about life for a while.
---
K
---
It is now (finally) working as it did in vanilla.
---
i want greta to suck my thundercock
---
What a surprise
---
I agree, its much more fun. Nobody enjoys the honor  grind but  everybody enjoys playing the game... right? I dont see any reason to play a game if you  dont enjoy it. :P
---
Especially a game with no impressive achievements you can brag with. (thats not my  opinion, every  elitist claims Classic has easy raids and all... i dont, i dont care, i just enjoy the "challenges")
---
Eh, who cares
---
yes, that's what you need to accuse me of.  thank you for admitting it.

need 2 queues "Optimized" and "Fun"
---
go to advanced settings and changed your graphics setting to your gpu, its running on your cpu most likeyl
---
for those who shilled and craved **#nochanges**: check how many paladins and druids you have right now on AV! It's usually one or two, rest are "premium" classes like rogues, warrs and mages. You can't expect many people actually play a class that has only one viable spec out of 3.
---
Have you wondered why warlocks and shadow priests are so much more abundant on horde side? Well, it's because UD racial WotF makes 1 class and one solid spec literally unplayable in pvp. Orcs have 30% passive stun resist chance against standard 5%, and one of the best pve burst racials on top.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
So yeah, screw these nochanges, i wanna play a hybrid class in a non-healing spec and enjoy the content same way as other classes.

I'm at 19w:41l as Horde, so about 18/19%

xD
---
should we tell him? 
---
hint: blizzard dont care
---
doesnt seem to be working on my warrior i just tested an hour ago with some items off ah, i wonder if it only works on classes that benefit from healing power. also can druid or sham even equip a 2h sword? unless they just patched or broke this yesterday with the bg release
---
Ah, the Bardock parable
---
Ohh why? She's aweful in every sense of the word lol... 😂
---
I've heard there's a cap of 250k per day. 
---
If we assume you're alliance and getting ~1.5k honor per AV win (10 minutes) then we divide 250 by 1.5 which gives us 166.66 AV wins per day to cap honor. 
---
~167 (number of wins needed) x 10 (minutes to win AV) we get 1,677 minutes of AV to honor cap per day. 
---
Turning minutes into hours gives us around 27 hours of AV per day to cap honor.
---
Obviously there's only 24 hours in a day, but assuming some people zoom harder than 10 mins per AV, and some AVs yield more than 1.5k honor, you can expect that if you would like to compete with the top-tier pvpers, you should expect that you need:
---
250k (the daily cap) x 7 (days in week) = 1.75million honor.
---
As a veteran Vanilla raider from '04 on, you are deluding yourself if you think you can put the genie back in the bottle and relive that time period.  It came, it went, I am sorry for those who missed it, but there is no way to recreate it.
---
Blessings to your poop post.
---
I too poo.
---
I actually used this strat in TBC. It took just one person to prevent a tower cap and they'd usually stall for 30 seconds. IDK why not people aren't doing it.
---
Not til phase 5?
---
Is English not your first language? I’m asking you why I’d be salty if I don’t have a stake in this.
---
Yep, seen 40 man russian premades few times already.
---
Just because you dont like something doesn't make it Retail, experienced players who value efficiency and their own time went for spellcleave.
---
Also know as hardcore players
---
If you were the person who did this with me last night on Heartseeker... hi! This is Bonesies! 
---
Took some convincing but we had 4 priests get the staff in one event!
---
I started playing on release and I'm not even level 60 yet because my buddy and I have been playing exclusively together. 
---
We've both been busy for the past couple of months but we were hoping to get back to it soon and hit 60. This sub is making me not want to do so very much, but the adventure has always been what it's about for me. That's what I love about classic WoW
---
I would say unstoppable force and Don Julio's band will be good for a while on warrior depending on how likely you are to get epic weapons from raids for them.

FYI the report system was requested by players back in vanilla and we were happy to have it.
---
Dedication right there. I'll have mine come next week.
---
You said gameplay and that has an enormous effect on every aspect of it.
---
Yes, there are 6 brackets for WSG 10-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59 and 60
---
AV is 51-60 only
---
To join ask a guard in main city for a Battlemaster. 
---
But the queues for low levels might be pretty long, even when its a cross-realm queue
---
You can do it as one group! No reason to do it one at a time! :)
---
Gamers and people in general always cry for having maximum freedom and zero opression/restriction. Yet in such conditions, we end up doing the maximum that we can which doesn't break the rules (but is quite often immoral). When getting caught or called out we blame the system instead. "If this shouldn't be done, then it shouldn't be possible and it should be banned." But once these restrictions are put in place it's all "fun detected", "X doesn't trust its players" and other conspiracy theories.  
---
In general, there seems to be a lack of empathy and morality in some gamers' actions. They need to maximise their "fun" at the expense of others. In addition to it, they consider their "fun" to be the correct one. If we don't enjoy their fun (game, activity, etc...) we get laughed at and called casuals. When we point out the moral/ethical aspect of their action we get called carebears or pussies.
---
It's like drivers who get tickets for speeding and risky overtaking. "But officer, the other car was going to slow. I HAD to overtake them..." NO, idiots. Don't blame others for your actions. The reason for your choices doesn't matter. What matters is that you chose to assholes. Noone did put a gun to your head and told you to farm Flamelash Alliance to the point of their exodus. Noone is forcing you to gank a player 10 levels bellow you. NOONE except for YOU. Your excuses don't make you any less of an asshole. You excuses just make you a hipocrite...
---
What? I sign up solo and volounteer as tank every run as that is my usual role. Figured it would be nice while i farm the rep for a decent 2h. What is wrong with that?
---
I was just kicked 10 seconds after the game started. Was mounted and moving south with everyone else. That is some bs.
---
Well based on that criteria and excluding mage it's gotta be hunter and lock, in that order.
---
REEEE STOP HAVING FUN REEEEEE
---
About two weeks ago I hit level 49 on my human rogue and could no longer quest on Sulfuras a high pop horde dominated server. I decided to take advantage of the free server transfer I did little to bo researched and picked Anathema. It is the lowest pop server on NA (or close to it) and this is the vanilla experience. I'm not even 60 yet but I see the same people every day and regularly interact with familiar names. World pvp was a thing but in an organic fun way. I could level the market is healthy and thriving and you learn what players have certain rare patterns. This is the Vanilla experience, so I highly recommend anyone on a high pop server either make an alt on a low pop or transfer when it becomes available and try it out I think you'll be very pleased with the differences. Also smaller community means people are more friendly as reputations are gained more easily.
---
#somechanges
---
I mean flipside, there are plenty of players who'd rather do it "the fun way" as oppossed to min/maxing, sure you wont be clearing BWL on day 1, but is that really important? I've enjoyed my time in classic immensely and am running around as an Enh shaman refusing to use non mail items, I've never been kicked from a group or had trouble finding a place due to my lack of min/maxing.
---
  
---
They can play the game the way they want and we can play it the way we want.
---
They made the afk reporting system aggressive because people were abusing AV during Burning Crusade.  
---
Matches would start, and people would mount, hit the auto run button and gallop off into a hillside for the entire match.  
---
   
---
An update made BGs flag you afk after something like 30-60 seconds with no key pressed, but people cheesed that by blindly pressing their jump button.  They were near their computer - surfing web pages, doing homework, whatever - but they weren’t playing.  
---
I knew a guy who abused AV for a full set of PvP epic armor, weapon and mount this way.  Riding into a hillside somewhere, smacking the space bar once a minute while really watching a movie.  
---
Blizzards answer was to make the afk reported removal much more aggressive, which led to it being abused.  Which is where we are now, having come full circle.
---
You buy honour items with them from the pvp vendors
---
Your main contribution to the game will be shouting at people in raid chat so they stay on mission tbh.
---
Blizzard favoring Horde shammies confirmed.
---
Me too, there were some times mobs would shoot me through a wall but nothing like it is now. As have been having mobs just run through walls to get away like it’s happens once a day now.
---
Well yeah, if I saw a junkie on the street I'd be worried too.
---
it's your accusation.  you can't make a coherent argument so you need to accuse me of being bitter or tell me "you need to make yourself feel better".  it's your script.  are you really that clueless?
---
also, being condescending doesn't make you smarter, it's just makes you a dickhead.
---
thats it? gl
---
Ight bro
---
IT was harder on Pservers to end this fast because the bosses actually had the tower buffs. Only premades were able to win this easily, random games always ended up in 1-3 hour slugfests
---
Not really, but there's nothing enjoyable as Horde in AV.
---
You rush Captain Balinda, kill her, then wait around for a few minutes for Alliance to End. It's boring and there's virtually nothing I can do to win without forcing a stalemate for 20 minutes, so I'd rather farm some rep in the meantime and not be forced to basically afk.
---
Dude this was always the way, information has just become more readily available and stuff has been figured out for 13 more years. 
---
Don't people remember elitistjerks and all the theorycrafting?
---
My bad, I meant honor, but rep.
---
It’s fun this way.
---
The modern mindset is why I always believed that the classic community would crumble.  We're no longer a legion of fat nerds that are into scantily clad night elves.
---
Instead a tight squadron of Chad's willing to sacrifice everything to achieve peak performance.
---
Im not much into drama but i seriously cant wait to hear in a few months of so many people whining who legit tried to do the rank 14 grind and failed. :P
---
Most people will  never make it... especially since its only one per week per server. Most people dont know what they get themselves into.  (im fairly certain you need to do legit premades all day long, and even then youll probably be fighting against other premades for the top spots)
---
But i also cant wait to see who  the first rank 14 will be on my server.
---
Eitherway,  im not  going for it myself seriously... but i will do my best and see where i get to because back in the day i never even  knew what i was doing, got to rank 7 and regretted it in hindsight... because rank 7 doesnt open the transmogs on retail, only ONE rank too low... fml. (but  then again i never knew the transmogs were even coming :P)
---
I agree it is dumb that the spell ring isn't in, but that is the reason.
---
Honestly this is just sad to here. 
---
An MMO RPG by definition is about the journey. It should be a bloody RPG adventure and not just a pure effeciency loot and grind simulator.
---
-.- ruined my night
---
Sadly it appears that this method of snapshotting has now been patched with the release of PVP.
---
Ah, one of the classic blunders
---
Turn them in for rep
---
Thank you! We’ll have to give it a go. There is so much we haven’t done.
---
All the different forms of optimization makes us get in the way of each others fun. I'm there for rep, and rankers hence annoy me, and casuals who're there to experience AV as it was meant to be played hate both of us.
---
Or some people find min maxing fun. I know I do
---
How fragile a man one must be to threaten sexual abuse against a minor
---
It's not about the buffs being there, it's about the meta of speed running it for honor. I meant it'll slow them down in the sense they have to make pit stops to kill the marshals but that's not going to add 20 minutes to each game unless factions start playing defense. 
---
And as long as losing fast and re-Qing is good honor that will be the strat and the buffs won't add so much that it changes that strat.
---
I mean if no one has key that's how you get it
---
I mean when you go on some irrational tangent that “all griefers are just psychologically damaged” or some shit, then yeah, most people are gonna interpret that as salty. 
---
Some people are just assholes, doesn’t mean somethings mentally wrong with them like you posit.
---
Agreed people didn’t do gank squads every single night in EP, WS, Felwood and the other lvl 50 zones. You would only see that in Saturday’s sometimes. Also for the most part people left you alone.
---
Post Malone and Postmaster Malone are actually separate both references to a basketball player.
---
For AV you save them for when you're honored. Before that guards give you 5 rep each, so you want to make the most of that.
---
The thing I don't understand is that even if they kick people to try and get their friends in.. there friends are going to be so far behind, and will probably be picked off by a huge enemy pack that sees the one or two new joiners as easy picking. 
---
Doing this AFK kicking is only screwing them. 
---
But know how those people operate, they will probably blame it on everyone else. Not themselves, for handicapping their own side at the beginning of the match.
---
Is there an addon that alerts you when a rare mob is spotted (e.g. broken tooth)
---
Yeah but my lvl 40 character has about 3 days played. If he's played less the next 3 days in a few months, that's just barely ever playing.
---
The trick is to not spend time with family I guess.
---
Just got mass reported and got a 60 Second Debuff saying i should be active somehow. 10 seconds before the debuff ended i got killed by horde and the debuff vanished. A few seconds later i got kicked from the game with 15 min Deserter debuff. WTF is this shit?
---
Even then we were failing to queue for the same game even when we clicked button at the same time.  That's when I realized how hard it was to find a specific game.
---
Yup, people for some reason don't seem to remember elitistjerks/insane theorycrafting. It's just figured out now so the masses have access to the information which ups the lowest acceptable standard..
---
No you don't.
---
I’m pretty sure that meme is from before Napoleon rose to power
---
Hopefully this next expansion will
---
Are there any online games out there just for fun and adventure? 
---
I wonder what Devs could do to make a game like that with modern gaming attitudes.
---
its not casual bgs its random bgs.
---
cant blame people for playing as a team ina mmorpg
---
Yeah because there is no pvp vendors
---
Av is literally instant and wsg was under a minute in a premade but I havent qued it solo yet.
---
Fun is subjective.
---
No problem, good luck with that.
---
Unsure if sarcasm, but no it is the elemental boss of the Horde.
---
But if you were new to the game and had a bunch of things you didn’t understand, the quickest and easiest way to learn would be to know someone that knows everything. Or at least all the general knowledge
---
I have a warlock and a warrior already and I'm trying to decide my 3rd alt right now. Hunter or Shaman. 
---
If this were TBC or WoTLK I'd pick shaman because I like to play enhancement/elemental and while I know ele can be viable in pvp and enhancement can be decent in pvp with a lot of gear, I feel like picking a hunter is the safer choice. Plus I wanted to do the rhok'delar questline I just am not sure if hunter is enjoyable at max level. I like both class fantasies I just think I like shaman a little more.
---
Why not? Because you decided that the meta would just be base-rushing?
---
When did bgs come out
---
He may have played private servers for the last 10 years I have been for the last 5 before classic came out
---
Sad but true. BGs are filled with incentives for honor grinding, not PVP. People actually avoid PVP as much as possible, dodging other premades and such.
---
Which is why customer support is minimal for classic.
---
Im trying to say they can
---
Whats your dream set?
---
Of course Mr. "normiesreeeeeeee69" comments this
---
THANK GOD time to hit 60!!! Weeeee
---
Playing a lvl 60 feral druid, I tried AV and it seems that I do no damage. I have a good mix of PVE BIS gear with a few epics, but I feel like I do very little damage compared to being 3 shot by most rogues with worse gear at the same lvl or many of the caster classes. Any tips?
---
I have a more than full-time job and 3 kids. Still have not grown out of WoW. It thrills the heck out of me to scramble a gnomer run together at 9pm on Friday night and play until midnight 1am if I don’t work Saturday. But I don’t give myself a lot of expectations because that might be the longest and most lucrative playtime I get all week. I don’t play mon-thurs usually. I just chill and have fun.
---
Lmfao what a complaint, there PvP in my PvP waaah.
---
Are you fucking serious?? I just got this too, damn it.
---
Jesus christ
---
Welcome to the last 10 years of gaming.
---
Did you just start the internet? This has been a thing on every forum forever. The vocal minority runs the show.. EVERY TIME.
---
&gt;all griefers are just psychologically damaged
---
stretch out what I said.  I was calling them stupid.  still am.
---
That balding piece of human waste has is the biggest cancer in the game
---
Joining maybe but you have to pass a gear, profession and consume audit to be able to raid.
---
It’s how it’s always been in vanilla.
---
What riding skill is needed and what's the cost of it?
---
The next time you are in Orgrimmar waiting for a zeppelin to Stranglethorn and playing a male character, talk to the goblin zeppelin master. She will hit on you.
---
My experience is different. Numerous game based subreddits I go to aren't toxic like this, and are pretty positive in general. Make no mistake, not every sub is like this.
---
Fuck this made me want to level up my priest instead of my paladin for healer alt.. but priests are so boring to level. Paladin too. But paladins can do so much more. I just want a lvl 60 healer to play a different role than my mage. Idk what i want with this comment. But maybe tell me what you did to make leveling less boring?
---
19w:41l is 46.43%
---
The most healthy way to enjoy classic is to completely disengage from the out of game classic community and avoid private server players whenever possible. 
---
Much of the out of game classic community is particularly combative and vile, and its difficult to really interface with, while private server players have spreadsheeted all the fun out of the game.
---
The actual in game community is mostly alright, which is weird to me, most of the toxic behavior seems to be relegated to forums and punkrats youtube channel.
---
I rarely come to this subreddit, because a lot of the commenters actually make me not want to play, and I have to remember that they do not represent the vast majority of the classic community.
---
Try equipping some gear that has the words +xx stamina written in the item description. That should solve the problem at hand.
---
Wait... 650g mount?! How!?
---
We got our first binding off geddon last night. Clearing mc from the 3rd week of classic
---
Isn't it 10% discount?
---
I wouldn't know, I only see him talked about on here. But seems to me if people don't like him they'd be better served not paying attention to him.
---
And that means what exactly? If he had been 48 back then he would be 60 now with raid gear. So then is still better ...
---
Omg thank you so much!!!!! All fixed now
---
They didn't care much about BGs in 2005, they don't care much about them now. That's what I call #nochanges.
---
Yeah but at This point I raidlog on my main and spend time leveling up my alts. I already have 6/8 Might / a bunch of raid gear. People spent more time farming pre-BiS then I have in MC - and it had no affect on progression cause we had Rag down on the first week we raided.
---
Don't get me wrong some of that stuff is great but most of it is junk to a raider after clear.
---
So when does the fun part of Classic WoW start ☺️
---
&gt; All metas in all games are completely irrelevant outside of the highest echelon
---
weird...sure seems like the vast majority of average players copy the meta trends set by the 1% regardless...sure has been that way for a long time...doesn't really seem irrelevant then does it
---
imagine thinking having a BiS list is a bad thing. "Wah why don't people allow me to be bad."
---
I don't get it. What is the difference if they get their 7 minute win in your group or another group? Why do they *need* their dumbfuck friends in there? IT'S NOT PVP!
---
I don't think it would look like self promotion, it really comes down to how the post is titled most of the time imo.
---
Yesterday.
---
so i totally missed the main point of the op's post lol..
---
knowing this yesterday would have saved all of us a lot of time!

---
If you can skip 95% of the content because it's the most optimal, then you're not experiencing a lot of the game, if they wanted people to do that then they would have just had that 5% be the entire game, AV? Nah it's just a runway with a boss standing at the end, first one there wins good luck. Questing? Nah you just Melee / Spell cleave one of these dungeons for 8 levels then do the same thing in the next dungeon. Earning gold? Nah killing these bats is the objectively fastest way to make raw gold so that's the only thing we added.
---
The game would legit couldn't be any more streamlined than that, it's not even a MMO anymore, it's just a multiplayer online since the massive is gone, and the RPG is gone too, so it's just 'WoW ~~M~~MO~~RPG~~'.
---
Best thing for Alliance would be to have 5 to 10 doing Galv, have rogues ahead to tag Drek Towers so they burn while you're killing him and his lieutenants.
---
Don't forget to tag Drek GY as soon as your bus arrives.
---
You can do this in 10 minutes.
---
Unfortunately blizzard has never done anything about abusing kicking. They always throw up their hands and say this is the best system we have.
---
How much rep after honored?
---
Complain all you want. But the truth is that this AV is a PVE battleground. Not participating in the commonly accepted way of doing it is griefing. Just as much as hiding under the water mill thingy in WSG with the flag is. You might think you are being the only one correct and that everyone else is wrong. But thats not true. This is not the 1.5 AV, so you are the griefers now.
---
I want to agree with you, but we as a community don't have any way to control this kind of behavior. We can't control roaming ganksquads. We can't control minmax. The community is doing it, but those who realize it's a problem can't really do anything about it. Shouldn't Blizzard want to help the game be more stable, fun etc?
---
Killed Galv with 5 guildies and none of us got anything. No honor or rep. Horde had killed Belinda already by that time. Seen this happen on several other occasions as well.
---
You think you want it, but you don't
---
Any class wielding a 2H can crit for 300. Even a Druid with a staff.
---
The downside of everything trying to become a competitive thing, e-sports mentality everywhere.
---
It's kinda the game developer's job to make the game fun. Players shouldn't be forced to gimp their playstyle to make it fun.
---
Obviously this is why Classic WoW is such a strange game. So much of it is a broken mess but we'd rather have that with its flaws than trust Blizzard to "fix" the problems.
---
Maybe garr?
---
Because I have no intention of getting anything beyond maybe rank 10 nd even that’s like if I can make myself do a couple hours of bgs a day. Also that ring man yumyumyum
---
I use Bagnon, and was able to drag and drop my keys onto the keyring icon.  I can't look at the contents, but they're there.
---
Will probably be downvoted for this post, but I don't understand the logic behind complaining about people with this view point. People derive fun in different ways, and Vanilla/Classic WoW in general is a grind so some people prefer to tackle this in the most efficient way possible to achieve the end goal of that particular grind then they enjoy the item or whatever it may be. What's mind blowing is that people don't understand that different perspectives on the game exist and there's no definitive way to say one way is better than another. And I'm not saying the average min-maxer isn't just as guilty of this, I just don't understand the complaints and holier than thou attitudes that eminate from both sides. Play the game how you want to play it; seek out those with a similar mindset while ignoring those with an opposing view.
---
If it's the multi-day long AV's you're seeking out, I hate to be the bearer of bad news but those just aren't a reality in the current iteration, and that was changed because people did not enjoy it. If you want an hour long AV then queue into the AV's at the top of the battlemasters list, those are the ones that have been running for a while because if you notice all the newest games that start are added onto the bottom. Regardless, aside from the fringe stories of the vote kicks, 99% of the time if you don't rush and want to play defense then you can do just that without any problem.
---
It seems like if enoug ppl report you, you get kicked instantly with deserter debuff.
---
I know its a breeze to level them. But its so boring. Dot and wand. Thats it. No variation at all.
---
Classic would be fine without all these tryhard asshole guilds... I'm so sick of all these douchebags min maxing everything. Just throw them all on their own server and let them rot in cheating hell.
---
- Make sure you have the classic option installed  
---
- Make sure you have the 'auto pass' tickboxes unchecked  (/rc config)
---
People say classic is easy then anything that requires a slight bit of individual play, people cheese.  If you can’t do it solo, you shouldn’t have the staff.  The quest shouldn’t be difficult now that you can have a few pieces of raid gear and DM to work with.
---
This is the internet, where people believe you need insane sample sizes for your statistics to be relevant. They'd go crazy if they knew how most political polling operates.
---
Well thankfully Blizzard didn't use the terrible verison where it takes 24+ hours to complete a single game.
---
Doesn't it fit perfectly?
---
I think you mean vocal minority. But yes
---
Yeah, it's the same with the "community":
---
Classic hype: The reputation will matter. If you do wrong, you won't get invited anywhere.
---
Classic reality: Blizz plz, ban this exploiter and this ninjalooter. They can't go unpunished.
---
A naked dwarf
---
Numbers only show for current active BGs, you need to q first available and join the next new bg
---
when I go to /rc config the screen is just blank.. it shows RCLootCouncil but no options at alll
---
Is your goal the journey, or the destination?  I’m taking my time this go-around.
---
I’m in the 50-59 bracket and I’m getting ~5mins for each BG.
---
Yes, because rogues can kill warriors in PvP significantly easier.
---
Jesus christ..... this is horrible. Free xp/epics for literally nothing.
---
Meanwhile you posted this.
---
&gt;god damn participation trophy generation
---
You dont know how to use chat? Jesus
---
I'm not complaining, this meta is great for rep and honor lol
---
&gt;The way people talk on here would be flat out disrespectful in the old gaming community. 
---
What are you talking about?
---
The old uberguilds from EQ1 routinely dunked on the devs back then (and were subsequently hired on at Blizzard) and the amount of bitching about *everything* on the old Vanilla forums was legendary, culminating with a parody post regarding (IIRC) C'Thun tuning that mocked an old post that Furor (Alex Afrasiabi) made talking about the shitshow that was Planes of Power/Plane of Time.
---
I'll upvote the shit out of this opinion
---
In 15 years we got really good at blaming games for our behaviour.
---
We used to not watch other peoples screens on split-screen goldeneye. WTF happened to us?
---
On this forum you mostly hear from people who have a problem with the game. theres a large demographic that is just having fun doing whatever the hell they're doing that stays largely quiet.
---
Either do as /u/yuareapirate suggested and join a premade or have some patience, a lot of people are farming av 100% for rep atm, once they start finishing they'll stop and the density of rankers will increase.
---
He did say sorry when he killed me the first time xD
---
Can confirm. Saw a troll riding it tonight.
---
And then I sit down at my computer
---
Try doing an item restore. It’s on the blizzard website.
---
Meh sucks that on my server herbs are taken 24/7. Even Icecap is just perma farmed on spawn even in like 3:40 in the morning. Its fucking insane.
---
I've seen more boe epics drop in the last 3 months than I did in the years of vanilla and TBC.
---
I've suspected loot tables were wrong for quite a while.
---
Mage AoE leveling is something that gets easier as you progress.  
---
22 is where most people advise you to start, but I find this too early since you don't have a lot of spells/mana/talents. 
---
26 is where I'd say is the minimum since you get CoC which is an nifty little ability that can save your ass and put out some decent damage.
---
At 30 you get Ice Block which can make the process a lot easier, allowing you to get enemies, and giving you a method to group them up while your CD's tick.
---
At 40 you get Ice Barrier + a mount, which means you can grab MUCH more mobs.
---
That being said, you can definitely start at 22, just try for monsters like 3-4 levels below you before moving on. One resist early on is all it takes to completely ruin your AoE.
---
I get fun out of min-maxing, we each get something different out of it.
---
u truthin?
---
Yes. You tame rams.
---
This has been the case for quite a while mate. Seems like you just obtained your 5set, so congrats.
---
i'm glad you concede. it's great when people admit when they're wrong so others can learn from it. thanks for making the world a better place.
---
I literally just said "win trading *before* bgs" as in before they were released.
---
Started at launch day. Taking my time. 43 War/30 Druid. 
---
If people want to min/max, that's just how they'd like to approach the game. I'm playing casually and I'm not having any issues. Telling people to stop playing the game how they'd like to is stubborn.
---
Lol keep it up this is great content
---
Also the whole honor system doesn’t appeal to me.
---
This is the dumbest argument. No one is disagreeing with anyone. Just two different points lol.
---
And yet they went with 1.12 AV, so......
---
I'm a little confused. I have downloaded the dev version, and I have also tried the official update for Elvui. I don't see an option for the keyring anywhere.
---
Haven't played much rogue, but the fun part of being a warrior is basically living the class fantasy. Charging aggressively into a group of enemies and dealing death all around feels AWESOME. Of course, if you don't have friends with you, you'll probably die first against a group. But the big mortal strike crits aren't bad, either
---
Double check you haven't downloaded the retail version.
---
If all else fails, re-download the classic version and try it again.
---
So let me get this straight
---
Your claim for druid is all AGI gear - which doesnt effect AP
---
Mail has abundant strength gear - which does
---
And in your ever expanding wisdom, you think druids can white hit just as hard?
---
Rewatch my link
---
Holy shit, i wasnt up on things and didnt know what Spy is. 
---
How in the hell is that allowed? Its seems completely broken and against the spirit of the game.
---
will try it out thanks
---
Some of ours do portal roulette at the end of raid night, jokes on them though my hearth's set to kargath, any city's an upgrade
---
I did, but only once in like 30 games surprisingly.
---
Once the game is a turtle it shocks me that anyone cares what I do.  :(
---
Not really even rep grinding its literally the best way to farm honor, lose av 4k honor win wsg ehh maybe 1.5k
---
You can so some great dps with the claw i use the claw + mc dagger and doing top 3 dps on ony in my guild and was  First in a random pug by like 50 dps more than the next I Like to Tank with aswell dw with IT the fast attackspeed is great for tanking and rage Generation. I would recommend to put the good sharpening Stones on them. 8+ dmg gives Most of the time +50 extra dps. Its great for PvP too agaist casters with the Cast interruption of the Low attackspeed. Just dont use ww becouse of the Low Base dmg
---
Horde just always lose because they play terrible.
---
Honestly, full judgement with hand of rag.
---
Realistically, probably full judgment, with the unstoppable force.
---
Oh we did, this was just 1 of our 4 games we did as a group. We went up against 2 premades that were solid 30 minute WSG games. This was never about winning, this was about having some fun.  
---
Then we all went into our own AVs to just idk.... run around for 15 minutes getting 10x more honor.
---
BRAVO!!! 20/10
---
If you see it make a ticket and report it.
---
thats just gamers in general. I like classic and will keep playing it at my own pace. F off to the rest of you.
---
Fuck me I've had so many of these. Either braindead pulls when one person grabs the whole room with no warning and yells "DO WE HAVE HEALERS?!" when he promptly dies, or people doing nothing to control the adds letting them mow down the healers straight away.
---
The exalted AV rep mount is only 640g or 650g And is Epic
---
Can confirm, was apart of the horde that summoned this monster in an hour and 20 min AV ealier.
---
So, I’ve been thinking about this a lot. And I’m going to give my take on it.
---
I think that generally people nowadays are just in their 30s, and they just don’t have the time to play the game as much. For instance all my friends have careers, multiple kids. They have to make the most of the small amount of time they get to play. So it’s frustrating for them whenever they don’t accomplish what they set out to do or what have you. 
---
The game has changed very little. The people playing it have changed a lot
---
If you don't have fun doing something in a game, don't do it. You can't blame the devs for not having fun. If you invest 100h/week or even more, having no fun while doing it, for a reward, you should ask yourself if the reward is worth it. Don't blame someone else for putting the reward in the game. It's clearly for those, who enjoy the 100h/week. If you don't, it's not for you.
---
It just exacerbates the honor system issue in vanilla of time spent being more valuable than skill. 
---
When WSG premades were the best method by a large margin you could outrank people by playing less than them by simply getting a spot in the premade and waiting your turn, you could cap out at 10 hours a day and still beat randomers pugging 16+. 
---
With AV 5 min zerges being the best you're now stuck competing against people solely based on time spent and with the kick function being so easily abused we will see a ton of people removed from AVs because they are a threat to X groups brackets.
---
I hope you continue to afk out of matches then if it means less base racing
---
Same, my dude
---
I agree the alliance are just babies as always and can't get good.
---
IDK, it can be that it was just less people raiding in general, on my vanilla server there were like 5-10 guilds raiding and none of them had multiple raid teams IIRC. And one a single guild raided nax.
---
Looking forward to your 19 twink Druid PvP video. Be sure to PM me once you finish it.
---
Thanks will check this out tomorrow. My character lagged all day stance dancing in pvp. I would Rez at the GY and finally get my overpowers. Some of other abilities acted like I still had a full rage bar. Goofy thing is I didn't get lag on my pally after I relogged.
---
I couldn't agree more and god damn is it annoying considering (in my experience) these people just *have* to tell you you're doing things "wrong" by not doing the thing that makes you like 2% more efficient. Like, I really don't care if you do that because you find it fun or whatever, but let me do my own shit and shut up -- especially if the content is being beaten just fine.
---
You mean J Allens’ Crack?
---
What no it isn't, it's 31.66%.
---
I was rank 11 in vanilla so I know what it takes
---
&gt;and fuck you for hiding behind shitty excuses for griefing other players. 
---
Lol there it is.
---
We're playing the game as intended, my friend. Don't like it? No one is forcing you to roll a PvP toon.
---
It was super fun. PVP and shenanigans went on all over the map. 
---
THIS AV? This is groups of people rushing towards objectives and not PVPing. How is this fun?
---
Are we not supposed to be able to queue as a party for AV? I'm pretty sure we were able to back in vanilla. Just not as a raid.
---
Nope, haven't been ganked yet in open world, rode on by a few horde, took the boats... There may be ganking in brm but it's no where near as bad as phase 2
---
Nearly one of the originals.
---
Expect base racing is less honor but okay.
---
Im fairly sure afking at the entrance doesnt give you as much honor as fighting in the frontlines.
---
The bonus honor is the same but not the honor you gain from HKs.. so slowly overtime you will  fall behind those who actually  play 20 hours a day. Even if you afk 20 hours a day and somehow not get banned, youll be behind honor... and as we know only the highest honor bro gets rank 14 per week.
---
If you afk 24 hours a day then thats easy alarm bells  for blizzard and they will ban you... probably  right after  you get rank 14 and about to buy your gear. :P   
---
Imagine afking rank 14 only to get banned for 3 months and when you login  next time you cant buy the gear because your  rank decayed before you had the opportunity. (incase  they dont outright permaban you)
---
oof.
---
And your point is? I am a millennial, have know lots of them over the last 30ish years and stand by my statement we are the god damn participation trophy generation.
---
the ones enjoying it arent posting as much cause bgs are fun as fuck
---
Is the answer to your first question not obvious? And is your first question thinly veiled insecurity?
---
ME AND THE BOYS
---
Had a multiboxer report me today on all his toons to get me out of AV. Feels pretty shit.
---
What does it mean. I’m to stoned
---
Samsies.
---
You'll get way more 1v1 in WSG.
---
I blame the rise of \~e-sports\~. everyone thinks they're going to become the next big twitch streamer, \~pro gamer\~, or monetize what should be just a fucking fun hobby in some way. esports and twitch have been a cancer on the entire gaming industry tbh.
---
I’m just here to give those Alliance players a hug.
---
That's why back there in WoD I did not care about my Garrison and in Legion about AP. It did not matter, my guildies still saw the value in me as person and player.
---
Now in Classic there isn't any fucking Brazilian guild (not to be heard of) and everyone hates everyone, and so I quit.
---
People fucked up Classic by employing there "tactics" for which modern games are actually prepared and made for.
---
Again I understand, but that's completely besides the point. You shouldn't be able to kick people from your group just because you don't like them lmao
---
Could be they turned this functionality on when they launched BG's in the same way that WorldDefense was borked at launch
---
ah yes, Nixons vocal minority argument
---
people who have fun playing don't bitch on Reddit. you're seeing a vocal bitchy super minority. that's reddit
---
Its the exact same AV and it ends the same exact way, 8 minute games with no PvP at all.
---
Arugal players (Oceania's equivalent to Herod) have also been doing this, in particular targeting players from the one PvE realm in the region.
---
Because I enjoy other parts of the game? I like to raid, and DJB is the best ring in the game right now, so I have to sit through hours of AV rush to get it. Sure you could argue, if you don't like it, just don't play it, but think about what that even means. The game COULD be fun if you avoid content.
---
you sure showed him
---
&gt; the group queue system was originally there and it's missing.
---
That's really disingenuous though because it was so broken that nobody used it.
---
When is av weekend and where can we see the rotation?
---
Karma.
---
do i need to be 60 to use it?
---
Hardcore. Did you smash it with a hammer or something?
---
Frostbite or mirah’s song for off hand, i’m an orc fury warrior? I have brutality blade for mh.
---
19 out of 60 is not 46.34%  
---
Wow...
---
Yeah this is Herod
---
You can see him blowing alliance up yelling DIE INSECT!!!! in searing gorge. Gotta love it.
---
&gt;  I'll still be trying to get higher honor ranking well after I am done with the rep grind.
---
Right... so might as well just grind out the rep as fast as possible to get the items, then you can care about honor after.
---
Unless its actual work. Then they mostly prefer to do most fun ineffective stuff they can, while pretending to work. :D
---
As a boomkin, yeah no. Even the guides for boomkin shit on boomkin.
---
Tag yourself
---
Those guys will be gone in 6-12 months - then the community will truly be back.
---
We appreciate you! We are on Windseeker. It’s a PvE server so we haven’t seen much ganking. 
---
We are loving the experience, but trying to understand the end game. Maybe we are overthinking it and should just enjoy it as we go.
---
Hold this Blind while I restealth rq fam
---
I upvoted anyways. Pretty damn close
---
I use the shield from ulda
---
We are also more chill and dgaf about most of the noise coming from the US and EU servers.
---
Did your guild get extremely lucky with DPS warrior loot or are you in the loot council? My guild has seen 1 band of accuria, 3 flameguard gauntlets, 2 onslaught girdles, and 2 BREs.
---
Nah usually the cpu shuts off with the rest of the computer when you push the power button.
---
No, 46 is the level required
---
They aren't going to change the game so that's a pointless argument. The only thing that will fix it is if people stop trying to sabotage the strategy. After a few weeks people will have their rep and more will be willing to play the side objectives for honor and stuff.
---
I'm a 90's kid and as such I know that his name was in fact Turd Ferguson, not Burt Reynolds.  I don't know who the fuck you think YOU are, you're just a cheap imposter.
---
Sounds like you're losing  a loooot, huh?
---
I'm just over here on my PvE real having a great time. PvP server was just too much try harding and not enough have funning.
---
You can't really "save" them very well, they are unique(20).
---
Why shouldn't you cap graveyards?
---
Dude I fucking feel you so hard on that last sentence. I didn't pursue a hard line guild in the beginning because I didn't want to do this but even the mediocre guild I ended up in cares so much about all that shit. 
---
I haven't bothered raiding with them but I've watched them stream and they just aren't good enough at pushing buttons for me to understand why they count the beans so fucking hard.
---
Can I haz cheezburger?
---
Nothing like picking between shield spec or a resource you don't use most the time only to use a talent point on the ability to parry later on
---
&gt; I'd say that the vast majority of people aren't playing for honor at this point. Even if they were
---
That's clearly wrong when you look at the current meta.  I mean, it doesn't even make sense to say that.
---
&gt; honor between the factions is completely meaningless since you only compete with your own faction.
---
This is also wrong.  It means the people grinding have even more of an advantage over the people who don't.  I supposed if you're top 1% or something trying to stay at the peak it's relevant, but that's not true for most people.
---
The part I don't understand is why people care about rep.  I'm halfway through honored.  Anyone who wants exalted will have it long before it's necessary.  It's just a random thing people decided to start saying to make themselves feel better.
---
I am here enjoying the salt.....and shitting on horde players.
---
The community was this way from day one. The only difference is the people who are still the type to play Classic also have a large overlap with the try hard crowd.
---
There are just less casual types to dilute them now.
---
Harrison Jones:D
---
Calm down, Greta.
---
If its a premade twink group, you most certainly can rely on full buffs.
---
AV lasts 6 minutes. A couple of minutes is the game over
---
This is so insanely despicable to me. Such a massive chunk of this community are such horrible people, it's nuts. The level of entitlement, selfishness, lack of self awareness, coupled with immaturity and at times rampant stupidity is mind boggling. 
---
Just play the game you love and be nice to people! It's not that hard
---
Now, I can only say this in the context of mages, but most self proclaimed mage minmaxers have absolutely awful damage relative to their time investment. My opinion is that mages are one of the most "min-maxable" classes, because there are so few variables compared to every other class. I'm absolutely loving playing it due to the level of "customization" in their gear options.  Problem is minmaxers have a bad name because a lot of them are the right/wrong type. Everything's bis or not bis.
---
 What I'm fucking around with right now is stat weight break points for different combinations or lack of consumables/buffs, then designing gear swaps around them with the gear choices I have. There isn't a static relationship between spell hit, crit, and power. If you use a flask and arcane elixir, you've just sent the  value of hit and crit through the roof.  I've never seen a guide acknowledging this.
---
They can't do shit to stop you from getting honor and breaking brackets.
---
That means you did not receive loot. The 2/3+ items that were randomly distributed to group members did not land on you.
---
Same thing happened to me.
---
When they can make real money selling gold. All Private server streamers are secretly gold selling mafia
---
One sick thing about the new Pokémon game was how fun and accessible it actually was for everyone. It may not have been crazy content wise but my roommate who was new to the series and myself returning loved it. The Pokémon Official sub went crazy over how the game was garbage and there was so much bad content, but over at the SwordandShield subreddit people understood the negatives but spent the time sharing fun memes and having a good time over all the positives it brought.
---
I loved being on reddit with the people celebrating the good times. I hope that we are able to do that with classic wow but I feel the majority of the community have moved past that stage of fun and are now focused on the progression and min max that comes with today’s MMO standards.
---
Well I ain't no software engineer but I do have this thing called google and i do have my own personal memory. Google 4minute av kelthuzad and you will see van pulled separately. If you are curious I'm the shaman with the t0 shoulders.
---
I do now thanks to a kind mage named Jimsum. Take your poor attitude elsewhere. Jesus.
---
the Hindenburg was a zeppelin that crashed and burned in like the 30s
---
Nobody knows
---
That the problem with games that have been around this long. Minmaxing has become such an automated thing, people have done the math, made the lists, run the sims etc thousands of times. We know what the possible best we could do is, we're not guessing anymore like we were in the original classic. We know how abilities work in-depth, we know what 1 stat does heck we know what 0.01 of a stat does and guilds and groups expect you to know this of at least your own class and to do your very best to meet it, typically on your own before you can get invited to things.
---
Except the rep will come as I do the honor grind ez fucking pz.
---
They get mailed to you after 20.
---
The problem is the rewards that are gated behind AV reputation. Some of the best moments in wow are when you are a top performer either in PvP or PvE. Both require gear.  Consequently the gear that is gated behind AV will give you a better chance of being top dog. AV is a means to the end so naturally player will optimize the journey to get to the end faster.
---
It's not a problem with the community, it really is a problem with the developers. Blizzard could have put in AV 1.0 but they decided not to - they put in AV 1.5 and called it 1.12. that was their decision and now the community is not having fun, so rightfully Blizzard is to blame - they had a choice between giving the more fun AV or the less fun AV - they chose the less fun version.
---
The community is still progressing towards their goals of being top performer but now they have AV loot to help them. Reputation stands in the way.
---
You ask - 'why are you guys zerging?' it would be better to ask, 'which of you are willing to sabotage your game reputation, dps, performance and fun to play AV the way it should when the 39 people next to you will not?' the answer is no one - that's why there's a Zerg.
---
Aren't the marks unique (20)? 
---
Unless you store them in bank if that works? 
---
I've heard of people deleting unique boe items they had equipped when they had a duplicate drop in world. They then loot the new one, send it to a bank alt to sell on AH, after that they go on item restoration and restore the original already bound item. I wonder if that works for this situation?
---
Ditto
---
Well shit I didn’t even know zeppelins were a real thing. Damn
---
Holy shit...how I didn'tnotice that.
---
I mean... it isn't a bad idea. And it's not really a 'change' either. Just a statement of intentions by the player. They should do that.
---
Gonna grow a full face beard to hide my shame.
---
&gt; Nobody is forcing you to zerg in AV
---
Say you have to run stocks 1000 times to get gear and MC was "just for fun", would most people run stocks or MC?  Exactly.  People play this game for loot.  You need to make proper incentives to make the best loot or people will just go the easy route.  This is 100% on the devs.
---
It'd be like if you rewarded people for camping other cities and flight paths with pvp gear.  Oh yeah that happened already and see how that went.
---
if you play ultra-ultra casually don't care about AV or anything that people are concerned about regarding the game then why are you on the classic wow subreddit? what content do you expect?
---
Huh!  Well, thanks for the info!
---
your ease will stop once harder content comes in, your most tryhard members will go to better guilds, you may even dissolve.
---
I agree 100,
---
I’m one of those min max players that “suck the fun out of the game” but I genuinely enjoy this play style and never complain about the meta nor yell at people for wanting to play their way.
---
Players not enjoying the game this way listen to OP. Most likely your not hitting 14 or being the top 1% so just enjoy the game the way you want and stop forcing yourself to play the most optimally.
---
Slim
---
&lt;Shady Dealer&gt;
---
You are required to grind the hell out of AP nowadays though.
---
Can confirm, am enjoying game. And pooping.  Not at the same time though as I put all my points into Enjoyment tree and only a few in the poop tree, for all the good shit in that talent tree!
---
I’m just wondering why this is? Why are people prioritizing these things if it’s not fun for them?
---
Eww. If AV is taking more than 10mins to win you’re doing it wrong
---
“The Boys are back in Town. The Boys are back in Town!!”
---
Yeah fuck him for wanting to play the game and not just grind numbers.
---
and yet in the pvp discord on atiest discord people are discussing organizing pvp and weekly honor gains so "random people dont get GM/HW. The irony is palpable
---
Couldn’t agree more. I get into AV’s and people have a text macro explaining to “cap certain bunkers and let alliance win, that way we get more HONOR”. Like fuck the fun of playing in a BG, it’s all about the min/maxing. I hate these players for trying to make the people just trying to have fun conform.
---
Level 60 Alliance feral tank druid on Whitemane looking for a guild that raids in the morning. I live in Germany at the moment and would like to raid at a time I would be off work here. I am open to respecing as well.
---
Nicr job covering his name doofus
---
What? I feel like you don't even know what you're talking about, or your english is dogshit.
---
I'm not avoiding raiding, I just only raid once per week. I can't do more raids than that, it's literally not possible.
---
Everybody is complaining and now you started to complain about complaining.
---
Anyone has idea how much blood he needs ? :D
---
Yet the 5-piece set bonus for mage T1 and Arcane Subtlety in mage talents already provide spell penetration.
---
Hello casual homie! Glad to meet you. Keep trucking yourself. :)
---
Why wasn't it 15 years ago?
---
check if you have ctrl for your keybind bound to pet or secondary action bar or something, that'll prevent it
---
Giver it a month. Everyone will be max rep and Haven given up on thier r14 ambitions.
---
Oh no, are you saying that your PvP experience has been unbalanced? That's really a shame, I'm so sorry that you have to deal with being beaten in PvP by something that you have no control over, you know, kind of like getting bum rushed by 10 people and being corpse camped for half an hour going from Thorium Point to Blackrock Mountain every day for a month.
---
Yes, it's enough, just look toward viskag and the mc sword.
---
This wouldn't be possible with a normal macro. but maybe with the addon GSE.
---
I shot you not I got bitched at for weeks in .y retail guild for using Divine Purpose over Inquisition. They were summing within a whopping 1% of each other, so I decided "hey being able to react to an extra button push on the fly &gt; being punished for forgetting to hit inq"
---
Nope. Apparently there's a point where you "have to stop having fun". This was during heroic progression on g'huun. Fuckers killed my desire for retail even before the bfa rot set in.
---
But you can sit through av that much to get your ring?
---
I've seen that clip at least 20 times, it's amazing watching him smile like that lmao.
---
I also put individuals at blame. People choose to watch e-sports and listen to content creators.
---
That’s the point of the whole game. Gearing up so you can be better and dominate, be it pvp or pve. Do you think once you hit 60 everyone is all of the sudden have the same gear and is on equal footing? No, and those 60s are always gonna want the best gear because dominating is fun and not everything should be fair. People who put in the work to acquire things get to have a better time. That’s kind of the point of an MMORPG.
---
I understand 10% of what you wrote here (I know what farming is!) but I’m having a great time playing classic wow. I never actually went all the way through it when it first came out.

Is this an edit of the JOJO post?

---
Remember, you are the only one in this thread that believes the stupid shit you're saying.  And if AP was negligible we'd all be stacking STAM you twat.  
---
And don't forget enchants
---
Yeah it's pretty fun.
---
Big reality slap for a lot of classes who have blown heaps of gold and time getting their non hunter twink ready, just to be slapped and kited by 7 hunters haha.
---
Yeah this is a huge issue.
---
This system was not in vanilla and I believe it was implemented so people couldn’t afk bot or similar methods but ultimately created a worse issue. 
---
#nochanges
---
I mean, yes?
---
If you didn't do all your dailies and repeatable quests, you were behind other players. Sure that doesn't matter in a Single Player game, but it's a fucking MMO.
---
I actually enjoy optimizing everything in this game. I already had the journey of discovering almost everything in classic but back then I didn't optimize a whole lot.
---
The bigger problem is people trying to tell other people how they have to play. This goes for elitists but also a lot of casuals tend to do that. Everyone should play the way he wants to and surround himself with players that think alike.
---
No. You met your almost namebrother.

its ok for us to kick you for not going to drek

---
I didn't think you'd double down, but here we are. 
---
Bravo, you're an inspiration to us all! Once you get exalted &amp; buy your maxed our pvp gear set you can finally rest on your laurels and...uh...well, definitely not use it for pvp. We know that. But you're gonna use it for something!
---
lmao. I still like 19 bracket cuz it allows everyone to be on equal terms if we are all twinks. Btw, I am a priest twink. Do we still hold up well in this bracket full of twinks?
---
Why didn't you take the free transfer??
---
It took me some time to decide but I transferred my characters on the last day and it had been the best decision I've made.

First time in 15 years I can roam in the wild without getting ganked by 20 hordes.
---
You had your chance and it sounds like you chose to not take it.
---
We've been saying since the start that the pvp system is absolute shit in vanilla. Not only the system, but the pvp itself is a mess. This isn't a surprise. Don't like it? Don't play the game. This is why I'm not playing. Should have read about the system before leveling to 60.
---
Eh, just throw a knife every so often.
---
EVERYONE min/maxed in vanilla dude. They might not be working with raid tier all the time back then but trust me, everyone was still min/maxing their stats with the gear they could get. In a way, the fact that everyone has easier access to top tier gear more easily due to better knowledge and organization makes the game more balanced and fair than it was back then.
---
When I occasionally run into pugs against people in pre-bis or greens I remember just how unequal the combat was in vanilla, except only a small number of people with raid gear were going around wrecking. And it's not that much work to get... the only real work is getting some of the pre-bis and then you can literally play once a week to raid and get geared out.
---
It's much better than having a massive disparity in power levels among different people in a battleground like WSG or AB.
---
It’s not a bad thing, but when you’re so driven to only get that gear, starting groups to reserve said gear, and thinking you can’t raid until you get that gear to maximize your DPS is absurd.
---
I hit 60 on a private server on a warlock. Next day I was in Molten Core in shitty greens and blues. Sure my DPS was below average, but the group worked together, we killed bosses, and I slowly started picking up loot. And in no time I had gear.
---
BIS lists are pointless. Just get to 60, get some decent gear and then go raid. It’s not hard, but people want to make it seem like it is to sound like they know what they’re talking about.
---
Well, I feel stupid. Really stupid. lol.
---
I cleared all keybinds that could be close so it shouldn't be that. I have noticed that if I put it on 1 instead of 2 it works. So you might be on the right track...
---
Lots of us love helping others out too. WoW should be social! At least that's what I think.
---
That is true but most rankers queue up simultaneously  with other people from the faction in order to "premade" which makes things faster. So at the very least you can ban them from doing that.
---
Ok, sure. I get that. But it seems that just because the fastest way for PvE players to get their gear is to rush Drek doesn't imply that the rest of the raid should go along. Lots of people are there to pvp and couldn't really care about less about maxing rep/hr. Should they not play the game how they want?
---
I don't know why people act like Min/Maxing isn't fun. It's honestly the best part of any MMO.
---
Enjoy it while it lasts
---
r/GrimDawn would like a word with you, I haven't seen a lick of negativity there
---
Why would you lie? It's well known that it increases geometrically for each DK. A lot of people have downranked from R10-R14 to R0 in less than a day by only killing trivial civilians.
---
Haha. I love it. We're all skipping the 19/29 brackets on our alts to avoid the twinkfest. So now twinks are on a level playing field and there isn't anyone to obliterate.
---
Haha! A lot of stupid people downvoted your post...
---
No thanks
---
Priests are amazing, but nothing matches thebkilling machines that are hunters. I have a rogue and hunter at 19, twinked, and prefer the rogue, but there is no denying the hunter is far more effective.
---
A rogue can open up on someone and hugely chunk their hp, but a hunter will kill you from a distance and you can't do anything. You'll try tonget to them but die to a barrage of arrows and cc from the melee in front of you.
---
&gt; Streamers, youtubers and the likes have raised the bar and set expectations which are, imho, absolutely unreasonable.
---
The problem is that the content they create is only interesting to a wide audience if it is something *special*. It really isn't that interesting to watch a normal person playing the game normally.
---
It's like a movie, you don't try to make it mediocre and bland because then why make a movie in the first place? So I don't think it is fair to blame the content creators.
---
The interesting things will always be on the fringes. The problems start when every streamer do these fringe-things. Because at that point it seems like a normality to the viewer.
---
This has always been the case in WoW though. There has always been a meta. Top guilds doing something a certain way becomes the meta, since everyone naturally assumes it is the best way. Even though it might actually be worse for everyone *except* the top players.
---
My favorite example of this was in Dragon Soul, back in Cata, when arms warriors did the whole stance dance macro thing. In short Berserker Stance gave you 5% more damage vs Battle Stance, but core abilities demanded the latter stance and you also lost rage switching between them. *If* you did everything perfectly and *never* messed up you would therefore gain around 2-3% dps. But the vast majority of players could not do this perfectly of course, *however* they still claimed to gain huge amounts of dps by using this stance dancing technique.
---
But it didn't matter that they likely were *losing* dps, because to admit that they were losing dps would be admitting that they were imperfect players. They were doing the meta and the meta is never wrong at the time. 
---
This is a much deeper issue that can't just be blamed on streamers.
---
In general, you don’t bother queueing in the bottom half of the bracket because of the power difference. Even not twinked, but with full stat appropriate gear at the top half of the bracket makes a world of a difference compared to a quest-gear equipped character at the bottom half. 
---
I’m a 38 hunter and I’m waiting to hit 39 so I can equip all my enchanted twink “of the monkey” gear, and I still destroy most people. I do have a bow of searing arrows, though. Today, I one-shot a level 30 mage for 750 with Aimed Shot. Why bother queueing at 30? It’s not going to be a pleasant experience.
---
Even if you aren’t a twink, I would not bother queueing for BGs unless you are #7-#9 lvls on your bracket.
---
I hate leveling
---
This. I started doing this early and people actually follow. Now every game i get into we have a solid 10-15 people stopping the 60%andys and actually having fun in AV.
---
I got decent toons on a pve and they were horde. My heart was set on alliance so I rerolled pvp 😭😭. But I've been sick since p2 hit and haven't been able to play anyway 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Yup. Warlock T1 is garbage for pve, as in there are better BoE greens on the AH for some slots. I wear it around IF for fun and sub some pieces in for pvp or parts of mc where i need the +hit, but yeah.
---
Nah, it's not like that. You should see some of the other fury warrriors and the rogues. A lot of our casters/healers call us Strictly Melee!
---
another tip is that someone other than the priest can draw the skellies with heal aggro, and won't trigger the cleaner so long as they don't take offensive action.
---
A prot pally is ideal. Just turn on ret aura, hang out near the cave, and heal yourself.
---
that's insane, I had just a premade start kicking a ton of people
---
I'm not saying this is fun, but it's also not the horrid slog of old AV. If the majority of the people really loved that style of AV they wouldn't be zerging every game, they'd be trying to fight.
---
Yes
---
Horde can also skip the Alliance base. :)
---
av is fine anyways
---
The community feeling was always a toxic cesspool and everyone's glasses are rose-tinted as fuck.
---
Well, what else is there to aspire in PvE content? There is literally nothing to do in Classic other than end game PvP. All one can do for endgame content in PvE is to speedrun MC or see some progress in your character, and believe it or not, you won't see progress in your character unless, you know, get the best gear possible to see progress. 
---
There is plenty of originality, you can be the best geared int wearing cloth warrior if you really want to, but don't be upset that people don't want to be a part of that. There is this thing that is called a guild, try it out, they tend to be very lenient depending on what type of guild it is with what gear you decide to use, but don't be upset that a complete random stranger doesn't want to play with someone who won't be carrying his weight compared to the other 10 bis players looking for the same spot.
---
No it's obviously the player's fault for obeying the meta, abusing OP abilities, and not having fun.
---
If you don't have fun spamming A, just don't use it right?
---
/s
---
but priests are still necessary for a team right?
---
More people need to watch Raycevick
---
Ah, yes, the "people's server" living up to it's name.
---
Yeah It's a fantastic weapon for how quickly you can get it!
---
It's available, price is 640g.
---
Yup. It's actually a term from tabletop roleplaying dating all the way back to the '80s. 
---
This isn't new shit at all.
---
It's all ElvUI.
---
Doubtful you will see this in the sea of  comments, but I DO NOT play to win 😁
---
I play for funzies 😉😆😁😀
---
In a perfect world, with equivalent end game gear and equal skill during AQ &amp; Naxx, this is what your DPS chart looks like (give or take):
---
#1 Mage with ignite
---
#2 through 5 Fury warriors and Warlocks
---
#6 through 9 rogues and mages without ignite 
---
Look up logs and every AQ/Naxx raid videos on YouTube, you will see that proof with your own eyes. 
---
This is how the developers made Vanilla WoW. Doesn’t mean X class was “bad”. It just means that every expansion had their “favorite” class and Vanilla was probably the era of the warrior across the board.
---
I'm just worried Blizzard is going to make the same mistake they did in the past and listen to the emotional whining playerbase instead of make an objective decision that benefits all players.
---
it's not. In fact you can scoop a very decent set of gear from BGs rep and BWL items in a few months. Aq20 and AQ40 off-set items put to shame r13 gear, especially with abundance of +hit.
---
Outside the legs and shoulders which are awesome, it's mediocre or crap (chest, bleh). I use tabards and shirts to try and coordinate my character's look though.
---
If it's less honor then why do u want to play that way
---
ok what about people who know they're bad at pvp but queue anyway  
---
are they griefing by hurting their team's chances at winning lol
---
&gt;Many mechanics in MC are ignored because the damage they cause is trivial or the boss doesn't even live long enough for an ability to be used.
---
Which ones? I can't think of anything that gets "ignored" other than Rag submerge.
---
&gt;Yes, harder content takes more time than easier content.
---
Time spent =/= difficulty. If you made each boss have 500 million health and take 4 hours to kill, that wouldn't make it "hard".
---
This \^
---
I was speaking about the quest to get 10 supplies and turn them in. Not the quest to just take control of the mine.
---
If you think of it, Blizzard tried to appease everyone by retail, so clearly it's the subscribers fault of how retail came out...
---
To be fair, it's age is why I didn't know about it, looks like it peaked in 2005, and I was 5-6 years old at the time
---
Yeah but you don't need that ring to raid. If you get the ring in a different way, there will be one less potential drop to be thrilled about in the future
---
As I have always said, the WoW community has never changed. It's always been like this.
---
Best thing to do is just ignore it and play the game for yourself.
---
You can't optimize if you have no idea how the game works. Game info was scarce back then.
---
Is it because you like bumrushing the final objective and winning by default?
---
&gt; Shazzrah can sometimes be killed before he even teleports.
---
Not everyone is a world-class guild doing bleeding-edge minmaxing.
---
I did AV for about 10 hours and saw 5-6 wins for horde. So a 10% win rate at best.
---
I am EU tho so it might just be that people haven't had the time to learn yet, since we're a day behind.
---
YET. When we hit naxx they will.
---
Also, to save a bit of money you can get exalted with AV to get an epic mount for 640g (with r3), also gives you access to Don Julio's.
---
THIS IS A BUG. PLEASE REPORT
---
&gt; Though it is annoying as it doesnt detect how many you have on you 
---
Huh? It works just fine for me. It doesn't "do it every time I open bank".
---
Wednesday’s me and the boys play rocket league.
---
Nah. 3 weeks would be enough, I think. Long enough that they're stuck subbed, but also almost insurmountably behind in Honor and Rep.
---
Yeah I got to lvl 22 and I feel like I’m done
---
Fuck a Papa Doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer
---
Fuck everybody! Fuck y'all if you doubt me!
---
I'm a piece of fucking white trash, I say it proudly
---
The vocal minority argument is legit thing, though.
---
&gt;  We're also not the people that aren't complaining 
---
Should that "aren't" be an "are"?
---
You're pretty bad if you think Evasion is helping the Warrior more than the Rogue. Crit Overpower vs dodging 50% of everything?
---
Have you considered consulting a mental health professional instead of taking your problems out on people in a video game?
---
The Vashj'ir preventive project
---
99% of the people leveling wont be joining a level 10-19 WSG.
---
They're irrelevant in the fact that most people will never get to the heights of the 1%. 
---
Min max to your hearts desire. But there's usually no point since you won't get the same out of it as those top 1% do.
---
I guess I didn't pay enough attention to what AV would be in classic release but it is a major let down for me.  What happened to peeling the onion?  I thought it was going to be the war I remembered from vanilla going back and forth fighting for every inch and slight advantage.  It's not even pvp, it's a zerg to the boss and who can kill it faster.  Im so disappointed and will not queue for it anymore because it is zero fun imo.
---
From what i've seen, they are buffing each other. I've noticed in some games the Marshals seem to have less HP after some bunkers are destroyed. In one game, Vanndar absolutely melted after we destroyed all the bunkers in a 50 minute long game. But using Detect Magic isn't causing the buffs to appear, which is odd, not sure whats supposed to be intended here
---
I blame the game being 15 years old,and everyone knows everything about it(or they can google 1000 guides) but thats just me.
---
I don't raid for loot you idiot.
---
i enjoy raiding with friends/guild members and trying to have fast clears.
---
Where can I find the Korean one? I play on Korean servers
---
Also the fact that we had free character transfers made even worst.
---
OP chose not to take the transfer and instead he/she is crying about the game being "unplayable"
---
G.i.r.l = Guy in real life
---
Like that GTA V speedrun skip? Still cool as fuck
---
Because RPGs are jobs now.
---
Did you miss my point?  Everything he advocated advances a win condition.  He does not suggest fishing or picking herbs or grinding npcs for gold/levels.  The activities suggested, turn ins, defense, skirmishing, all these have their place in helping your team advance.  No they don't contribute to the immediate zerg.  And that's my other point, the zerg is a fragile thing and if it gets thrown back, if you truly want to win, you will appreciate the guy who got enough scrap to upgrade your npcs.
---
All your posts are suggesting to do the singular thing the rest of the raid is doing, or else you are doing it wrong.  And when that singular thing is not focused on winning, your argument literally falls apart like a pair of suspenders in the middle of a moth storm.
---
Being bad at something isn't trolling.
---
Intentionally going out of your way to make things worse for your team is.
---
&gt; you are being a cringey selfish casual that only wants people to play the game YOUR way 
---
&gt; Stop being so damn selfish. 
---
Oh the irony
---
This is what happens when you take a retail mindset into a classic game. Or, the reason why retail went the direction it did in the first place.
---
I have a series of alts that i use to bum gold by the mailbox in town.
---
I really, really hope he gets banned on stream.
---
That doesn't change the fact that longer fights still make bosses harder cause there is more room to fuck up and you can ignore many mechanics altogether.
---
But you chill av for loot? And I definitely gave you a reason to offend me as an idiot...
---
I would love to know the best way to use these as well. When I turn them in ironforge all I get is honor and no reputation, is this the right way? Or should I be getting rep for them?
---
 Eu side - av has been great. Some long some short
---
Had an hour long game earlier and this is exactly how we won. Everyone is chat was saying it was the best AV they had played in a LOOOOOOOOOOOONG time.
---
That's not true! I'm enjoying it but I can't let myself play until I accomplish something productive, so instead I'm here procrastinating.
---
I knew this was going to happen once everyone was raving about those addons to auto accept quests and shit tbh. The lore of World of Warcraft is one of the best parts of the game that has gone completely unnoticed. So sad.
---
&gt;Like, I really don't care if you do that because you find it fun or whatever, but let me do my own shit 
---
Lmao, ironic considering people like you are in this thread shitting on others for having fun min-maxing.
---
No it does not, you report him.
---
He was detected by you, a human.
---
There is no need to do it in 'a wave' as the detection method was a human. "You were banned for botting after looking into 200+ individual reports of you botting"
---
Always thought it was 200 but only using retail AV and Korraks for reference. Might have changed in this version.
---
Apparently.
---
Because it helps me raid better..... how are you this dense.
---
GRIZZLY-stalagg
---
Society as a whole I think....maybe when the last few expacs in retail came out and blizz made it all about getting to raiding as fast as possible, or so it seemed. maybe that set a bad example. Thats why I started Classic, and why in both I just play to have fun. It really isnt the product its the process. Same thing in life.....
---
Man-childs who wish they have quick reflexes like they did 15+ years ago are punching the air rn.
---
On the other side of the coin, we summoned Lokholar in our game and a small group of Alliance rolled over and killed him as nobody wanted to defend him. RIP ice buddy 2019-2019... err, 2004-2004? 2004-2019?? 2019-^(LETS DO THE TIME WARP AGAIN)2004???
---
How do you group queue? I see no option for it + trying to join at the same time gave everyone a different bg
---
I truely, honestly, from the bottom of my heart, couldn't care less.
---
Lmaoo
---
Yes and in my opinion, it's not really the players' fault, and it can't really be blamed on the gaming mentality. The role of a game designer is to predict what players are gonna try to do and make the game as fun as possible for as many people as possible. What's happening was really not hard to predict, in fact a lot of people predicted it.
---
However, unlike retail or any other modern game, the shitty design can be excused by "hey that's what you asked for". If they really want to fix all the design flaws, they'd have to make an entirely different game. And that's not the point, since that's not what the demand originally was and mostly because that would take a lot of resources and would involve risk, which is obviously not the current standard in the gaming industry.
---
But in any case, imho you can't blame the players for playing the game. Basically, "don't hate the players hate the game".
---
It seems like doing the best at WoW (or games in general) is really important to you. Maybe it’s the only thing you feel accomplished in, or maybe you’re just naturally competitive. Regardless, it’s a game that people play for fun. I hope you find more important things in life to invest so much emotion in.
---
Gj telling everyone dumbass
---
Yeah exactly,everyone is so shocked but what did they expect from a 15 year old game thats figured out a long time ago?
---
&gt;Who are you to tell someone that they aren't having fun by getting reputation and honor at the fastest rate?
---
Because I've been there, and can look back and see how much not-fun I was having when I thought I was. And I've seen too many people make the same realization. I'm not saying that applies to everyone, but a significant number of them are just doing it because they're caught up in the farm.
---
Idk I get enjoyment out of mix maxing. I get enjoyment out of pushing for number #1 guild on the server in PVE rankings. I like racing for rank 11 for a 90g epic mount..
---
Lmfao this is exactly why J Allen infamously said you think you do but you don’t.
---
It is a particular graveyard just north of mid for alliance.
---
The thinking is that if Horde caps it fast, allies will start spawning all the way up in their base. And since that is where the horde is going they don't want the extra problem of more enemies there.
---
The problem that tends to occur is that if the graveyard is left to allies, they will spawn right by a choke point in the map. Since they spawn many at once most of the time they can cut off any reinforcements streaming north for the Horde using very few people. Resulting in the horde people up north not getting enough reinforcements to do the final boss.
---
The opposite is much harder to pull off for the horde since the south side isn't as easy to choke off.
---
How do you know it’s a premade? Honest question
---
People rage about AV premades.
---
How do you group queue? I see no option for it and when we tried to join at the same time everyone got different BGs
---
Go into keybinds, and go to something that has no binds: click one of the empty bind spots, hold ctrl and whatever button you have it on. If it says "unbound &lt;something&gt;" then you know it was a binding problem. If not, it probably needs to be rewritten or checked for errors.
---
Welcome to the new generation.
---
Guild name? Wouldn't be surprised if it starts with a T and ends with an -e
---
38 hunter, it makes me so happy chasing flag runners and just OOMing them with viper sting. Eventually they just keep running unshapeshifted  😂
---
You should submit a ticket about the battleground. They'll have that information.
---
325
---
/remindme 2 days
---
Everyone just needs more MEGADESK.
---
who knows lol. Just call yourself Sylvanas, Thrall, Arthas, who cares
---
People really don't understand the whole vocal minority thing.
---
There's always a very casual player who comes out of the woodwork and tries to argue that you don't *have* to do stuff in the game, like they dont understand that there is a consequence for not doing so.
---
In Phase 2 it was (and still is) people saying you don't *have* to get the epic mount, and then wondering why they aren't being invited along for world PvP.
---
30 minute BWL? Really? That seems very fast for that full instance.
---
This.
---
You know what's fun? Being succesful. We all have different criteria for what that means, but if someone's criteria for success is minmaxing, trying to force them to HAVE FUN!!1!!1 by doing something they find boring and best and awful at worst is just inane.
---
Do be careful though, some people purposefully stay at lower levels and use the best gear possible to win those fights for whatever odd reason
---
That's why I just play classic for the fun now. I take my time and just try to enjoy the journey again. Retail is for minmaxing, and even then you should find a way to enjoy it.
---
2 eyes, 3 bindings (got both halves in 1 raid then another binding from gar last week), 0 bre or spinal reaper, 1 OEB
---
I'm playing to win the Battleground and get honor. I'm killing Belinda, capping the towers, killing the Lieutenants/Commanders, and then I go to the enemy base to kill the boss. 
---
It's Alliance that are base racing and getting no honor. Horde generally are playing AV how it's supposed to be played by taking / killing the objectives. Meanwhile Alliance are mindlessly base racing.
---
this is embarrassing. Dude he pvps all day, he dies. like wtf.
---
Yeah... "raid better"
---
Wait what, you needed someone to teach you how to use chat? Damn, did you have someone have to teach you how to breathe through your nose too?
---
Literally what do you want? If there are exploits, a non-zero number of people will use them. This is true in every game, forever, and was true in vanilla. There is no community so good that noone will use exploits like this.
---
Bullshit you are. I sat online a ticket that was 2 hours past its estimated answer time, and then I got a canned response in an email and the ticket got closed without a GM even bothering to whisper me.
---
Nah I’m gonna go back to camping level 20’s in hillsbrad and making their lives hell lol
---
RemindMe! 2 days
---
Id uss to troll people, go into UC and pop out of stealth start fishing(as ally rogue) one time was fishing with almost 10 horde.
---
No emulation and piracy are not the same, that’s why they have different names. Nost wasn’t shut down, the key word there is threatened, I’m assuming nost is the one server out of hundreds that you are referring to. Are you aware of  the laws in other countries? Nost was also invited to blizzard headquarters to discuss te game and how they did it. Show some respect, your playing classic because of private servers. But like I said keep groveling to blizzard.
---
Hopefully all this has long settled down by the time you get to 51 so you can enjoy Alterac Valley (AV) properly. That battleground was one of the most fun and memorable parts of vanilla for me, I loved it. But from what I hear, people on both sides are now just optimizing it by rushing straight for the boss, without bothering to actually fight the enemy faction along the way. That was just depressing to hear, takes all the fun out of it. Haven't seen for myself, though, taking my time leveling up.
---
It takes 14-18 hours. Thats 6 hours a day for three days. That's not no lifing. People having exalted today is no lifing, but not in two days lol.
---
You're forgetting that this was basically what the game was before blizzard changed anything.
---
This was the entire game. You didn't realize it was happening because we didn't have reddit or discord. We had MSN messenger and other apps similar.
---
Ninja looting was rampant all the way up until midway through lich king when blizzard changed literally everything about looting.
---
Horde/alliance heavy servers were always a thing, this is why blizzard introduced that crap where you'd interact with players from other servers, so you didn't feel like you were alone as a lonely alliance player filled with nothing but horde on your server..
---
People need to stop crying about the world of warcraft that they play because this is what they wanted.. They wanted the classic, vanilla experience. Blizzard removed a lot of these features BECAUSE people cried.
---
I've been constantly saying it but I get ignored. Ya'll just a bunch of babies.
---
Only on level 40+ it seems.
---
The effect goes off showing you getting healed, but no numbers show up, as you get healed for 0,0,0,0 ect.
---
Had the exact same on oceanic, a mostly full raid from yojamba did the same to me :S
---
Yo wtf that man actually bear grylls'd that in his mouth
---
Yes and no.  
---
    
---
Yes it's very much about time.  
---
No it's not *all* about time, still need to be efficient with it when all the other turbonerds are putting in just as much as you are.  
---
You also wouldn't really be able to compete with your server's top WSG premade if yours had a worse comp and less skilled/experienced players.
---
I used to fish in vanilla AV all the time while the rest zerged.
---
Side note: Wowhead seems to be saying the WSG purples are later phases, with the bracers in phase 3 and the legs in phase 6??   If that's true, well, the rep grind may still be easier in the 49 bracket but don't expect the big rewards right when you hit 60. :-(
---
Wtf u don't know how to use chat?
---
Tell that to 95% of the real world population... they will totally agree with you
---
Stealth? You don't get cat form til 20
---
3% chance though. Would take some really high sp to make it worth over a better shield like Malistar no? Unless "struck in combat" works with spells and dots and shit too.
---
Yeah, otherwise if they had queued for a specific # then they wouldn't have to do this.
---
It's not dependence, it's community. As a warrior I went through food constantly while leveling. I started asking mages for food, and found they were quite glad to help. People enjoy giving you a helping hand if you're polite about it.
---
When all ten are from the same realm?
---
Realistically you will never reach rank 14 unless you can do the following. 
---
- Take off work for **Minimum** 3 months
---
-Wake up 7am 
---
- Go to bed at 1am 
---
During the 18 hours a day, 7 days a week for a **minimum** of 3 months that you will be PvPing, remember you have NO breaks to afk.
---
I loved MoP and I hail it as one of the best expacs, however dailies were slight problem due to one major factor. Golden Lotus dailies were the ones you must do to unlock other daily hubs. People burned out on them faster, when reaching other places. But yeah, it should not have been that big of an issue
---
I don't know if you know this but "off one's rocker" means "crazy"
---
Here's the thing, we can tackle this from a punishing player approach, or we can just give the people what they want: group queues.
---
Thing is, you next level cell dwelling piece of shit, if you read the opening post you would realize that the "AFK-emote-prank" isnt the issue. Hence you are the peak of stupidity because you dont even comprehend the message OP is trying to get through, now go back to shutting the fuck up.
---
Capping a GY isn’t griefing ever, sorry about your pve honor grind tho
---
Ive worked/done all nighters at both a desk job and doing construction, I found construction easier to pull all nighters with because I kept active all day while at the dwsk job I would fall asleep at my desk
---
TBC
---
Isn't it just a standard option? My raid frames show class colors and I dont use any addons atm.
---
We just start AV and a 10 man premade gets mad at me for disagreeing with their strategy to kill Galv before Drek.
---
one of them whispers me "STFU bitch" and then "Bye" and then i suddenly receive the afk debuff where you have to attack a player within  30 seconds or you get kicked. They obviously banded together to report me AFK. A clear abuse of the system.
---
Ofc, the game only just started, so there were no enemy players around and i was kicked with deserter debuff, locked out for 15 mins.
---
I have also seen people doing this to other players in AV for almost no reason other that they dared to disagree.
---
Don’t forget you can do this with a squad in warsong OR right click to report the fc for name if your whole team does it dude should get dc
---
Would be cool to get a cheap mount that can be used when silenced
---
I gotta say that the factorio reddit is an exception, but other than that I agree. Combine that with a game that is locked into how things were 14 years ago for no other reason than nostalgia and it’s going to be bad.
---
Welcome to modern day gaming, this was always going to happen and anyone that thought different was living in denial.
---
Afk report merctanko, come on guys only 3 more votes!
---
Nice use of punctuation.
---
I hope this shows that infinite whining doesnt mean retail is bad either ;)
---
Wow classic can't be no changes cause the players have changed
---
As a hunter who hasn't done any real pvping yet because both the death groups and the battlegrounds seemed pretty lame, I feel this. Like this game is going to be around for a long time, why do you need to min/max to get to max rep/honor RIGHT NOW! Why not play the game to have fun instead of trying to rush through it.
---
But then why did Blizzard put a pool of water into AV that you can fish? Because they want you to fish, else blizzard would just make it too shallow or make it none fishable.
---
When one person queues and gets given an instance number, everyone else can then race to join that specific instance.  Might work, might not.   There was another thread about some unscrupulous behavior to try and get additional friends into your instance but hopefully that doesn't continue without repercussions.
---
Hey man, thanks for making this write and these videos. Much appreciated
---
Frostbite over Mirah's for sure, because you're an orc with axe specialization.
---
Twitch.tv
---
Crazy how obsessed people are with streamers. Streamers they don't even like or watch. 
---
Sad stuff.
---
Really? I'll take a look at the options then, thanks
---
People keep parroting this but they never actually say which mechanics get "ignored".
---
Mostly because it's false and the only mechanic that gets "ignored" is rag submerge.
---
&gt; People fucked up Classic by employing there "tactics" for which modern games are actually prepared and made for.
---
This was always going to happen, if you didn't think so its incredibly naive.
---
/thedivision
---
Uhh, I was under the impression that classic was built on a foundation of spite and ego?  It was never about fun
---
I work 60 hrs a week, take 2 college classes and am married, i put in about 35ish hrs into classic a week. But it depends on how you want to play the game. I have a lvl 56 and a 34.
---
You don't get invited to raid over the 100s of people of you class who did do the grind.
---
Its all come full circle. We wanted Classic so much we destroyed it ourselves.
---
I genuinely think people might think what I'm saying is a little crazy lol
---
Do you have proof that it's intentional, and do you have proof that they were nerfed at all?
---
Your comment made me glad I woke up for night shift thanks Horde friend 👊🏻
---
It's a good challenge to see just how fast you can "zerg"
---
So much this.
---
Guy sensei aproves
---
That’s not how it works at all. Bots are obviously reported   and are also detected by anti-cheating systems but not banned on the spot, then, on a certain day a HUGE wave of bots will be banned.
---
Most MMO’s do this, even Valve fuckin do this with CSGO
---
Okay I'm gonna spend all of AV completing the quest Empty Stables, which has me capturing Frostwolves and turn them in to an NPC. I'm obviously not griefing right? I'm obviously helping my team.
---
“make a sham move to mislead an opponent.”
---
Juking is a term that pre-dates wow
---
&gt; It's about getting there and completing your checklist as efficiently as possible
---
That's the part that gets me the most. Wasn't that one of the biggest complaints about retail?
---
I JUST WANNA GRILL FOR GODS SAKE
---
PvP is pretty rock-paper-scissors, not just between classes but between solo/small group/raid contexts. Enemy warlocks are a middling threat in group PvP since I'm a good healer whereas Shaman/Fire Mage/Shadow Priest become scarier than they are in smaller groups.
---
is that a pog?
---
Hunters get geared super quickly in classic, but on another note, while nothing is confirmed, it seems likely that we're getting TBC. I don't know if they will let us port characters or if it's completely fresh, but if they let us port, having a 60 shaman could be handy since you like them in TBC. Ele shaman for PvP plays out very similar in classic and TBC. Might even be stronger in classic tbh.
---
The quest is already ridicilously easy, i have terrible mana regen and only used a superioir mana potion. You just need to prioritize renew
---
At the moment, reckoning is bugged and it's not doing what it's supposed to be. Besides that, you should be leveling with Ret. There are a lot of talents in ret that will help you kill enemies faster. Prot/holy isn't worth it while leveling as you won't have the gear to support it unless you want to spend all your time in dungeons.
---
I guess it depends on if you played other MMOs before vanilla. I played EQ and DAoC between 2000-2004 and considered WoW easymode at the time. My friends and I certainly min maxed stuff back then as well, and I was an early rank 14 rogue on spirestone. For me, it was always honor per hour (that is the nature of the PVP ranking system). I didn’t raid much until BWL and Naxx on my Druid because I was really against PVE instances at first haha - that’s the norm now of course and as I learned recently on the EQ progression servers it can absolutely suck to not have instances or enough layers. 
---
Prior to the honor system, there was still theorycrafting talent builds and itemization. I suppose once people get used to MMOs that’s just how it goes no matter what.
---
Lol salty horde dont like to lose i see. Oh how the turntables have.. turned. You know what I mean
---
Priest are awesome levelers, never have to drink, never die and crazy good in world pvp while leveling so you dont get ganked or die from ganks very often
---
Everyone is zerging to get the honor and ranks so they can join the complainers to force blizzard to switch somthing up so everyone else gets really far behind.
---
Probably because it was added later, it also has spell penetration on it which only appeared with AQ iirc. As an Ele Shaman I can't even get it so I'm not too mad it's not available tbh
---
Its the same level of minmax its just that minmaxer's voices can get hear more and information is more readily available.
---
We are arguing the same thing then.  When u said you afk out of long matches I thought u were arguing for base racing because what you just described typically takes 30 to 40 minutes at least
---
Reddit is mostly complaining, though. You don't really come here and post much if you're in the game having a good time.
---
I’ve had physical jobs and desk jobs. It’s much easier to push through the physical work than think through something complex when tired.
---
How am i selfish when i cater to the fucking majority? Explain that
---
We see that happen in retail over the years. This spec or class is garbage and you shouldn’t play it. This type of content is horrible and you should cheese it this way. Do this build because it’s optimal. Play this faction because racials increase DPS by 0.2%. 
---
It’s unfortunately part of RPG’s and MMO’s now because the systems and gameplay was so complex and people raise their profile or make money handing out this information. And Information is cheap.
---
I think the point is that it's just a game at the end of the day. The "consequences" are not real. I mean people can argue that the "consequences" are real to them but I would say those people might have an unhealthy relationship with Azeroth.
---
Like, I'm not even mad. I don't think it's fun for any reasonable alliance player either. It's super boring. The fun matches are where the alliance wipes and their respawns are back at their base. Then it's fun.
---
Yeah that's my conundrum right now. I keep thinking ahead knowing I won't be playing my hunter in TBC but I would play my shaman. I like enhance more than ele but that's good to know. Think I might level up my shaman after all since I don't have a healer already.
---
Thanks.
---
I've seen one single epic drop in 3 months of playing.
---
They just become obsessed with achievements, clout and just being able to say "I played this and beat it." Eventually people keep going through games quickly and realize that at some point, they simply don't have the time to play everything, and that no one cares you beat XCOM2 or not. 
---
Hopefully when they realize that, they start enjoying the journey rather than the result. Which is why I find it funny when people complain about long grinds. The grinding part itself is the main gameplay, it should be fun.
---
&gt;pretty fast grind
---
Says man that has 10 epics and just grinding AV for 14 hours straight.
---
I see what you're trying to do here and I appreciate it. I agree with you.
---
This happened some time around 2008ish or so when people using the internet to stay meta started happening. Everything is hyper competitive now. There is no wonder left. Everything is datamined to death and mathed out within days, sometimes months before release of new content let alone super old content like classic. 
---
People care way more about rewards and getting a statistical edge over other players than just having fun. Its why games now have to balance reward incentives to get people to play certain things. Its like people enjoy the skinner box more than the game.
---
It's not just about "needing" the best gear possible. It just makes it cleaner and smoother and should be expected of members to come in as prepared as they can.
---
The majority are casuals who are just playing to play. Not min maxers. What happened to all the "WTF PHASE 2? IM ONLY LEVEL 30 WTF BLIZZ!" Now everyone here wants to act like they don't exist.
---
Join at around 25+ as you will not have fun getting killed by 29s in that bracket. 9 level difference is huge.
---
I am not saying ban person because of X reports, but if a person gets a shit ton of reports for botting, look into it.
---
...has world "PvP" (aka endless gank squad corpse camping in 48+ leveling zones) actually cooled off? I want to level my alt some, but would rather wait if it's going to be what it was like in P2.
---
Are you ever going to change this weapon in the future?
---
Yes. I am aware. But they are by far the most boring class to level. Which is lame, since they look so much fun at 60.
---
I tend to agree, but the colors with rag would look sick with judgement I think!
---
this is not good news :&lt;
---
am i the only one that's going to miss being in a alive world ? back to dead azeroth...
---
You can join in your 20s but the lower level brackets are usually very unfun for normal players because the lower level Bgs are  mostly filled with twinks (characters that players have leveled to the highest level of a certain bracket for the sole purpose of playing  battlegrounds, they will have the best gear available at that level with end game enchants on all of their gear).
---
I don't get the hype with fight club. It honestly leaves a lot to be desired imo
---
Thats why smaller servers are dope. Deviate Delight citizens for the most part arent sweaty try hards.
---
it was on faerlina as well i think
---
won't do anything, i reported 2 people recently(with evidence attached to the report). you won't get a reply for at least half a day, and the reply will be the standard "we're looking into it" with no action actually taken ever.
---
I genuinely think streamer culture has poisoned gaming. Remember when people played for fun? But now so many people worship these streamers and think they need to be try hards like them to become popular and it's just awful.
---
Why the fuck is everyone a try hard now??? Just play the fucking game yall
---
OK ZOOMER
---
I don't know if that's true, I'm pretty sure every guild has struggles of that nature, including top guilds on most servers (maybe not top guilds of classic as a whole though idk).
---
Stop clicking links to free shit
---
Its way more fun to rush it than to have long battles for nothing where no one wins.
---
I'm not sure how those things could be compared in this way
---
All click next available at the same time
---
OSRS is a prime example of this. It's not the same game it was when it was originally released. Hanging out in Camelot chopping yew trees was the epitome of a good day of video games back in the day.. now if you're not max efficiency, min/maxing everything you do, you get looked down upon. It's just a whole different world.
---
Everything in the game had been done, and has had the opportunity to be fully optimized is the most efficient way possible. Honestly what I think it boils down to, is everybody wants to make it a competition. Why waste 4 hours in AV having fun and getting 8k honor when you could get 50k honor in that same 4 hours? (I dont know realistic honor/hour just using those numbers as an example)
---
This thread, saying everything I’ve been telling all these idiots, but they get 2000+ upvotes.
---
Meanwhile I get the lunatic look and this person gets gold, fuck this shit.
---
I was a former officer in workaholics, lets just say you should steer clear.
---
That makes sense, horde are not winning the games. In the last 10 games I did, 9 wins went to alliance
---
yeah man, that's legit fine that's part of the BG
---
Grats on the depression
---
It's a pin, about one inch in diameter.
---
I haven't been. I use an older email for my WoW account with an old password that's probably been picked up in a few major hack leaks. Stupid on my part to not change it or setup authenticator. Just never thought about.
---
You can steer him after the pull and get him without Hyrdas 90% of the time. 
---
To do this I'll first describe the position. It would be standing on the overhang, facing the tunnel he'll swim into, on the far right side. So after pulling him you'll run over to this position and you can get him to kinda follow you and go to this side. This usually means he does not pick up the hyrda since he will not swim near it as he enters his tunnel.
---
Ding ding ding ding
---
And if u dare suggest they just chill out and have fun you get screeched at for not being mega ultra epic gamer efficient.
---
No joke somebody was doing the Great Masquerade today and several ppl told them they're bad at the game and they should've done the questline 2 months ago. Like wtf kinda attitude is that????
---
I got kicked too, it was kinda deserved though. Since i figured that as the raid leader you can turn on master loot in AV. People caught on fast and i got kicked xd
---
Yeah no thats a flat out lie. People were furious about Halo 2s ending. The only things that changed are:
---
1) Gaming is more mainstream, so we have more people.
---
2) Information is more available.
---
3) Mega sites like reddit exist.
---
The people who flame were there too. Theres just more people period. More angry people and more people blissfully unaware.
---
Also acting like game designers know everything is ridiculous. Several companies have designers who are actually just Ok or bad at the game. And the pro players are the ones who are able to go "Hmm this shit broke".
---
So do you play around 5 minutes a day?
---
Yeah don’t do it. Rush to Drek or get out.
---
Mobile authenticator is free.
---
That was it! They were bound god knows where but not anywhere visible in the Keybindings UI. Thank you!
---
Yeah I don’t pay anything more than cost to buy the reagents. Fuck mages entailed attitude. I don’t charge you for summons or stones.
---
One of my guildies had farmed anger 150 times for HoJ and when I told him he really really didn't need it he lost his shit at me.
---
I swear people have become brainwashed by these Bis lists
---
Not according to the site you linked. It's wrong, but hey, according to your link, not BIS for Rogues.
---
Got kicked for getting kicked from AV?
---
song?
---
Lmao. That sounds awful. Sounds like a job. A shitty job at that.
---
Does your GM know that pugs are clearing MC in quest greens?
---
Completely agree.
---
But the difference is **way** more dramatic for twinking. It's not even remotely close.
---
A twinked out 19 against regular 19s is straight up absurd.
---
This is what happens when everyone wants fucking reddit karma and tells everyone noob in the world. GG
---
It's like how the stats say something ridiculous like 1% of players raided Naxx but 85% of this subreddit did it and it was e z mode. 
---
The game sells the dream of being a hero I suppose. There's nothing wrong with that. Everyone goes in thinking they're going to be that hero who opens the gates of AQ, or gets a world first, or gets rank 14 or becomes best friends with Asmongold, or w/e. When it becomes clear that they might have been being a bit delusional they get angry.
---
One of the reasons why I canceled my sub. (ONE, the other being I don't have time and then there are a few more that aren't relevant to this thread). This game suffers from the same problem as every other recreation of an old game. Everyone knows it.
---
There is no journey. There is no discovery. There is nothing unknown. Therefore, everyone knows on horde you roll orc or undead, everyone knows the mage does it all, everyone knows the tactics to win. Winning is only really fun if you don't have it down to a science, otherwise it becomes a system.
---
Yeah, I hit 60 fast, within 2 weeks or so. It wasn't that I hit 60 fast it was the community in general in and around the 48-60 range and on my alt I eventually worked on to 30. Even though I didn't remember WoW because I never played it seriously back then, I knew at that level what to roll on and what isn't worth it. I just ended up chasing BIS automatically since it was known this is what's required to make life easier. Also, I didn't really have a choice because groups only wanted to run certain dungeons, certain bosses, etc.
---
Blizzard was right. We are our own worst enemy.
---
I ran into the same problem playing Agnarr EQ server.
---
Easy, the players. Don’t listen to people saying it’s about the info available now, it was all available then with addons and all. The only thing that has changed is the players and their expectations and sense of entitlement.
---
This is called "addiction"
---
av zerging is fun though.
---
Bandits and terrorists you mean
---
I got an account stolen back in bc era.  When I got it back my alchy was replaced with 300 mining and it had like 1k gold on it along with gear upgrades.
---
I know. Didn't bother setting it up and that was a mistake.
---
Damn, showed him too.
---
Really depends on the mage and maybe the server.  I think most portals are 1g where I am, water is open tip unless advertised otherwise.
---
Yup. All these pvp try hards farming honour will never beat that one guy who will no life it. It's genuinely pointless but won't stop the toxic mindsets
---
[Decalescent Dirigible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jH-mhZLuGRk)
---
This is why I want a level-less MMO.
---
That’s what happens when a game is the focal point of a persons life.
---
Unfortunately that's a mentality you should expect to find rather frequently. A larger faction of min-maxers exists in 2019 than in 2005, and to those people, acts of charity or general decency presents to their grey matter as a waste of time and resources.
---
IQ test. Their spots were better off vacant :p
---
And yet they did ban people abusing layers in dungeons....
---
 classic is not about clearing, but speed clearing. sure everyone can clear 2h MCs. but only very few can do 35m MC.
---
People will always complain about something
---
LOLOLOLOL ORANGE MAN BAD
---
but it is though because it literally puts the team at a disadvantage to cap that graveyard. youre griefing.
---
I always thought of Cookie as female.
---
AV is the fastest rep by a mile. The top players got exalted in ~12 hours of play, so normal players can easily do it within a weekend. Doing it on mage or warrior first would be the best option. If the warrior is an alt, you're probably not getting a rag weapon any time soon unless your guild has been tremedously lucky with a lot of them dropping, so getting TuF is very valuable as it's the next best option after a rag weapon. For mage, the off-hand is BiS until you can get the staff from nefarian in phase 3. Every caster DPS needs the staff and it has a relatively low drop-rate (less than 10%) so the AV off-hand will serve your mage really well as there's really no guarantee that you'll get the staff before AQ is out. I'd say hunter is only worthwhile if it's a character you play a lot. If it's your main, do it, if it's not your main you should prioritize warrior and mage over it.
---
Because they wanted to put a pool of water in AV? There isn't some 200 iq chess move reasoning as to why it's put there, it's just some artistic design that a developer thought would fit with the surrounding area.  
---
Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should. There is a chat in the game, and it permits you to type whatever you want in it, but that doesn't mean you should spam slurs to everyone, and definitely don't be suprised when people report you for it.
---
Natural selection, if you're stupid enough to click on a damn mage portal then you deserve it
---
Same as vanilla i guess then, 19 and 29 brackets were always just 5-8 hunters a side in WSG, you'd then have a few rogues and as I was a priest there'd always be 1 in my games. 
---
I twinked a warrior at 19 before raging about the hunter epidemic, then moved to 29 where it's actually worse due to their level 40 gun, then finally to 39 where I stayed as that.
---
Only like 3 specs are top tier in each bracket till 49 where things get more than simply viable for a lot of classes.
---
&gt;People used to trust devs and game developers to make good decisions
---
and then companies started to farm that trust for profit and now there is neither trust nor good decisions
---
Update your mods......
---
I don’t understand what WoW Classic is disguised as.  A rock?
---
Which is a lot more fun so win/win
---
I have to agree I'm so tired of trying to tank a 5man only to have some people trying to rush me or the run.
---
Thats awesome, thank you so much :)
---
Yeah, AV is just the same bullshit as world PvP for rogues, let me get my exalted so I can avoid PvP until AB come out. Now that is a place I could live in forever.
---
This is extremely dumb. There should be a middle ground. Players should have the power to kick others out. But not so easily, not even close. Especially since these AVs last only a few minutes now.
---
&gt;Took a ton of screenshots because I was going to hit the fucking roof and report (ironic, but legitimate!) them   
---
FYI, GMs don't care about screen shots at all. Literally of zero value.
---
"Gaming behavior" didn't change. People think it did because they had positive interactions. People have always complained and bitched. People have always corpse camped. Assholes and people who dont give a fuck have existed for a long time. Waaay before the internet.
---
The consequence is that you don't get to enjoy the game. "It's only a game" is a meaningless statement, I knew that already before you said it. Yes, it's only a game. A game that I want to have fun with and it's not fun to ride away with your 60% mount if 5 guys with epic mounts are chasing you. Some things *are* a must if you want to enjoy the game.
---
There is no "completion" in MMORPGs. That's the whole point! If there were, no one would play, and it would just become MORPG.
---
Such is the life as a paladin. It's the slowest class to level as in the entire game. Notably slower than warriors which people use as the example of a bad leveling class. I'd really just respec ret and do some hyper relaxed leveling, just sitting semi afk hitting quest mobs.
---
["There are no girls on the internet"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU7G8cR4D2U)
---
Golemagg stacking debuff, Shazzrah teleport, Magmadar stacking melee fire damage, respecting Garr adds vs just mass tanking them until the boss is dead, Golemagg/Baron soft "enrages" at low health, Sulfuron's add buff, not missing a kick on Sulfuron, respecting damage shields on Domo, Ragnaros's entire submerge phase, and tons of other damage spells on random raid members that are trivial and not life-threatening.
---
There's a ton of shit you could buff to force raids to pay more attention/play better or suffer the consequence of death/wipes.
---
There still needs to be a base amount of time spent for there to be a decent level of difficulty. Everyone that argues "adding health/damage does nothing" ignores this. If you only have to perform for a handful of seconds, that's a lot easier than doing the EXACT SAME job for a few minutes. Because the longer the fight lasts the more opportunities there are for the player to mess up.
---
Of course that doesn't need to be taken to the extreme of FFXI bosses taking 36 hours or whatever, but over time WoW has shown that fights lasting in the 3-6 minute range are acceptable to and enjoyed by the large majority of raiders, with final fights stretching out closer to 10 mins.
---
You do realize that a great many people among the Classic WoW community are genuinely new players, or otherwise players from later expansions that want to see what the hype is all about right?  
---
You're being selfish by denying them the opportunity to experience aspects of the game, such as the minor objectives and quests within AV, in the same way that was considered completely reasonable 15 years ago.  
---
The magic of exploring a game world for the very first time may have died for you a long time ago, but if your agenda is to kill it for the new players of today, you can feel free to go fuck yourself.
---
Honor gain means nothing. The Zerg actually benefits the alliance because we are focused on getting rep. 
---
So once we get our re and never queue up again? Horde now can’t get rep OR honor. 
---
It’s win fucking win for the alliance.
---
That's why I only play with friends.

Raid starts in 5 minutes, just got called to go into my night shift early.  Was supposed to be done these back in november, but here we are.
---
This sucks but the big premades are going to run their course over the next week and will very likely be rare from thereon.
---
you guys like to miss out on honor even with wins. strange
---
Doing the wintersaber trainer rep grind makes you a lot of gold while you do it. I've probably made 500 gold and I'm only just about to hit honored. The original gold for my mount though came from selling Nightslayer Bracers for 500g.
---
Time to slap those tim allen cowboys back the mayor of goldshire. Eat those cigarettes boys, eat those cigarettes
---
Thats so sad.
---
Blizz can prolly get everything back if you open a ticket.

maybe for frost mages ... still, its a mere +5 sp over an AH green. hardly bonkers.
---
Freaking MVP. I was to lazy to find this myself.

---
\*Anakin Skywalker intensifies\*
---
Its all up to Date actually.
---
Same with the D4 sub and the game isn’t even out yet.
---
 The only reason why people accept the penalties of classic is because they were there from the beginning instead of being introduced later.
---
So why the fuk would you want to add penalties later if this is your logic?
---
I beginning to think WoW hasn’t change all that much, but the players have..
---
Preach that shit, my man
---
So far I've made a ticket, tweeted at BlizzardCS, put authenticators on all my accounts and changed all my passwords.
---
See my addon said 2.5 it was live which threw me
---
No accountability in a 40 man cross realm match
---
And yet you savages slaughtered him.
---
He authenticator is complete garbage
---
Nah blizzard does not even consider subs as viable revenue source they said themselves they are banking on micro-transactions of which there are none in classic.
---
Well yeah, he’s from Grobbulus server. He’s one of those weird role-playing shits
---
Sounds exactly like retail
---
a 51 warrior joining AV to quest and wonders why he gets kicked... k
---
Yeah some things are a must but the epic mount grind isn't that bad. I think OP is talking about trying to get rank 14 and by extension other feats that are unrealistic for most players.
---
brown must be druid

Jay Allen Brack is laughing in his grave right now.

Oh eat a shit sandwich. Those few do NOT outweigh the wants of the majority. Ill kill that "magic" and spit on its corpse and lots of other even more edgy things!
---
Does losing gives 125 rep? I only see 12 Frostwolf Clan appear when the game ends, and in my chat. However winning does cause 350 Frostwolf Clan to appear on my screen and in my chat.
---
oof sorry, does this work?

i bring potions for emergencies though

They are deleted. Advertise admits to it even himself on his own video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNpL-kGwL-A&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=37 which he then privated.
---
19 "Feral" build is not optimal at all compared to FC or healer/root machine. Buuuut, counterweight on Smite's hammer from Deadmines and a Str/Stam build can be done for fun. 
---
Old 19 druid 1v1s always came down to who weapon swapped better between counterweight weapon for damage and spirit weapon for regen. It could take an hour before someone was oom so you had to min/max for the longest, most boring duel ever.
---
Woot nice sheet! Thanks!!
---
Hunters can make 100-150g an hour on tribute runs. Until ZG croc farming with mage nothing touches that.
---
The think you but you don't argument is where you went off the rocker. Blizzard is purposefully making classic shitty and pushing people to BFA deliberately. Blizzard doesn't want classic to succeed because they don't know what to do with it. They either admit fault and make a better game or they try and kill their own kid because they like the new one more.
---
there's a point where playing a game becomes too much work, and having to deal with people like this is that point for me
---
How can you play the game the way you like if you can’t do premades for AV? You can’t
---
dookie brown druid
---
He's just another gankster that gets triggered by people not paying $15 to get camped by him every month, one of many.
---
If you haven't yet, give guild wars 2 a try. While there is leveling it's more of a tutorial. Originally they didn't want levels, but decided it wasn't the right time to try a levellesss mmo.  Start with free to play and if you like it there are 2 expansions to get for more content.
---
There’s no single reason for anything. People came in with an idealized version of what classic should be. For some they still have it, and didn’t let others take that away. For others, they came in with a completely different outlook.
---
Really? I've had way more pleasant social experiences than the opposite. What server are you on?
---
This.Evertime small group defended we won,max in 20 mins And honor was nice 4-5k
---
Nah, Blizzard has produced so much greatness that the way people disrespect them on reddit is unforgivable. I almost assume anyone ranting and raving against blizzard at this point to be mentally unstable.
---
The report system is just bullshit. It saves Blizzard alot money, cause they dont need do it themself. Problem is the judgement is in players hands, specially groups over solo players. 
---
I dont see a reason for a afk report - if the system can detect afk players. everybody has to take the phonecall for 2min sometimes.
---
On retail its more worse. Players que for Dungeon with random players, but than votekick the random. Report system was abused for disconnect enemy team in rated battleground. 
---
Its a bad system that allows groups abuse for troll solo players. Wasnt in Vanilla #nochanges
---
How long dose it typically take to get exalted?
---
In what way? I've never had any issues with it.
---
Where tf are the priests?
---
So youd rather get a 15 minute timeout plus not get the honor from finishing than spend an extra 20 in the bg
---
I've responded to you once dude. I haven't "kept saying" anything. Please chill out at least enough to realize you are talking to different people in this thread.
---
The game is the way it is. Classic is a re-release, nothing about it is surprising. If you want a sweeping change like a change to the honor system that's just not going to happen. I'm not saying the system is perfect, or even good. I'm saying that as players we can either enjoy the game despite the flaws (like the honor system), find a game where we enjoy more, or complain fruitlessly because Blizzard is definitely not going to change the system. Personally I don't mind that some content is going to be unreachable for me so I plan to keep playing, and keep pvping, despite the system's flaws.
---
It was, people just had no idea wtf they were doing and information was a lot more scarce. You still had Bradgames selling shitty guides on  things that even an average 2019 player will find common sense
---
You're talking about yourself right? You can literally raid MC as a lvl 58 - you don't even need a full raid. Pre BiS is honestly a waste of time
---
&gt;over 10 years of changes in gaming behavior.
---
This is the REAL culprit people ignore. It's not the game, it's not the genre, it's not the developer. It's the culture of gaming, nearly everything is like this now. People min-max absolutely everything, there is ways to minmax god damn Minecraft and people do it.
---
Since when did you pay his subscription and are allowed to dictate what he wants to have fun with in the game that, let me remind you again, he pays to play?
---
Ya. I had a 10-25 min AV turn into a 70 minute AV earlier because of people capturing wrong graveyards and forcing a turtle.
---
Defend with me in Av brother
---
Living up to your name you absolute spud.
---
Warriors will be welcome to just about any guild. There's almost no such thing as "too many warriors" in classic. Most realms have around 15-20% of the population playing warrior, but an optimal raid team can have as many as 15 warriors in it. A lot of your BiS pieces are BoEs, albeit expensive but you can work towards them in a very predictable manner. Another benefit of playing warrior is the fact that a lot of the BiS/close BiS gear drops in MC or dungeons. You can right now get 7-8 pieces of gear that will easily last you until Naxx. And once phase 5 hits, you're also going to be able to craft a pair of legs which is BiS the rest of the game.  
---
The only class in the game which has both low gear competition and can easily get a raidspot is druids, and even then they're going to be competing with other classes for their "actual BiS" but they get tier really fast.  
---
Out of the classes which has competition for gear, warriors has the most "predictable" gearing curve as there's really no way that you're not going to be decked out in mostly BiS gear by the time AQ/Naxx is out, because half your gear is either BoE or drops in early raids. Rogues doesn't have it as good as warriors. Not only do they compete for the same weapons, but rogues barely use any BoE gear once they replace devilsaur. They need the same armor as every other rogue, and pretty much nothing is BoE.  
---
Mages are even worse off, being by far the most popular class in classic for some reason, they also compete for loot with warlocks and to some extent paladins since mages need spellcrit post AQ patch when they go fire.  
---
While priest isn't nearly as hard to gear as a rogue or a mage, it's by far the hardest healer to gear as you're stuck to only using cloth armor, and both druids and paladins/shamans will be competing with you for loot.
---
Pickpocket and solo killing SM cathedral is supposed to be easy braindead money making while watching tv.  I don't know how annoying the selling run is as alliance.
---
Everyone wanting WoW classic for the last few years is like missing an ex girlfriend after she cheated on you. After that happens and you break up the person you knew is dead. A few years later you don’t miss the person itself. You miss the relationship and who the person was when you were together.
---
I mean sure, but how is a dumb example since it is literally bis *forever*
---
P3
---
EVERYONE MUST KNOW THE SAME THINGS AS ME
---
If you have been keeping up on Reddit, you will o ow we predicted this long ago, horde can't beat alliance in bgs lol
---
No it's not, drop the bullshit. Drek/Van will have nearly 16x their health by having towers still up.
---
Or you push vanndar after balinda, and start winning some games because allies keep fucking up their zergs
---
Just wanted to zoom back in here and say I gambled a good price in a purple BOE I had on a death roll... won 45G
---
I wrote a huge reply and deleted it, because reasons. 
---
“You think you do, but you don’t.” 
---
Proven utterly accurate - however Ion was pointing the finger at the industry and GAMERS in particular, not at people with nostalgia or the now-initiated masses that called for it. 
---
2005 &gt; 2019. Even with having to listen to my sister’s shitty mtv blasting 24/7 through the house, fighting for the sole phone line, and starving myself from saving chore/lunch money to pay for my sub.
---
imagine thinking that i made a mage so i could spend my time making portals and water for nothing
---
Send a ticket. My account was hacked In wotlk and I ended up getting everything back including the leather the hacker used my account for
---
Yes that's the other build. Looks more like what I would use. Sucks to miss out on vengeance, but that's how it goes
---
If we are being totally fair, you could easily take people purposely trying to stall a game as toxic.
---
Like not capping the flag in wsg.
---
I have the same one. Bought it at Blizzcon 2009 and still have it on a bag.
---
I was in the same boat as you. Did combat up til about 53ish. I respecced to sub then and don’t regret it at all. The amount of control you get is worth sacrificing the pure dps in my book. Especially now that BGs are out.
---
If you haven't found one yet, I saw Tribe use a Weakauras config, you can find the string here: https://pastebin.com/WUDCfg1A for AV TIMERS.
---
I started using it and it works great.
---
There's a two hander and a dagger from AV rep.
---
45 mins is nothing
---
I blame this thread for anything that comes of my gambling.
---
Not only this but people from arugal report spammed me after I cleared the debuff and I got silenced for a day. Honestly this is the most cunty thing you can do
---
My biggest annoyance are people mindlessly following BiS lists without even thinking and trying to understand why these items are (optional)BiS, and actually end up being worse of for it.   
---
The worst I see is usually DPS being way over hit-cap or players in general not realizing that the BiS list requires you to be using all consumables and flasks....
---
Which they don't because it's to expensive or they can't be bothered to farm for materials.
---
For some that's entirely the point. Having a limited skill set requires you to be creative about how you approach certain fights.
---
Lmao this is a lie.
---
If you haven't found one yet, I saw Tribe use a Weakauras config, you can find the string here: https://pastebin.com/WUDCfg1A
---
for AV TIMERS.
---
They deserve to die if they're wearing leather in PvP. DPS/Hit Rating just doesn't matter there, at least when compared to PvE. Same goes for spellcasters. I could wear my legit +40 spell damage robe that has 0 stamina on it, or I can wear my dungeon set 1 robe with a +100HP enchant on it.
---
Bad play isn't griefing. If I want to run around with a zapgun because  its fun for me, or try to carry with a hero, I'm not griefing you.
---
What do you mean? They intentionally bombed the launch so they could offer you a $25 transfer now that you've invested 3+ months into your character.
---
You are right, with a lot of games it is within the developers power to create systems that force compliance and foster different ways to play. 
---
I do appreciate that there are two very different ways of looking at this issue in gaming though. Some say the devs need to fix it, others (this subreddit) say its the players that should. 
---
My issue/inquiry is less so with separating the hardcores from casuals and more so, how did we get here? Why can we not count on players to play the objectives? Why do we feel efficiency and paths of least resistance are the way to go 100% of the time? Why do gamers feel they need to always reach for the 1% now? 
---
I see it as a human issue as much as a balance issue and that saddens me to some degree.
---
No not everyone can be as awesome as me I get that.
---
But how does someone not know how to use a chat system in 2019.
---
Wtf
---
Because it's just so unnecessary and try hard. This dude spent 10x more time needed to do raids than actually raiding.
---
But when you point that out to people they get defensive af.
---
Half the time ppl farming pre BiS don't even want to be doing it (at least that's what these people tell me when I ask them why) and never stop to think "hm I'm not having fun and I don't rlly need this... Maybe I should just... Play the game... For fun???"
---
I genuinely think there's something wrong with people who force themselves to not have fun and be angry and frustrated in order to be like... 3% better at killing. It's just so fucking toxic
---
Actually it is, its 45 minutes.
---
Bingo. I see it everyday
---
Not sure to be honest
---
And you live under his desk blowing for dono readouts.
---
Its like instagram reality except in video games.
---
I've played both rogue and warrior extensively, their playstyle for PvE is pretty similar, albeit warriors are a little bit more complex and requires you to use cancelmacros and keep track of both swingtimers, not just mainhand. However, for PvP they're completely different. Rogues often camp objectives, waiting more than actually fighting, whilst the sole purpose of a warrior in PvP is to smash, and the harder you smash the better.
---
Starting a rogue alt anything I can get for it to make leveling easy besides bags?
---
Same here. I don't know what's "min-max" or most of the acronyms people use here. It's taken me like 3 months to get my pally to 45. I'm just enjoying the game, leveling my skills and professions, running around with guildies, exploring, this sort of thing. I'm having more fun with this game than I thought I would tbh, there's so much to do
---
It's not a community problem.
---
Starve ten dogs and then throw a steak in between them. Bad dogs!
---
So those of us using staves are just fucked, I guess. Qq to us.
---
Hour long stalls sounds like the least fun thing I could imagine in the game. If I wanted to do that I would have joined in the hillsbrad shitfest in the first week after phase 2 dropped.
---
Mages have it easy in pve, no lies there, but a warlock doesn't take much to fear, dot you up and destroy you either.
---
You also mentioned you're a rogue, they didn't call it World of Roguecraft for no reason. Perhaps you'll understand why rogues have been despised as well.
---
Similar searches of "Heavy junkbox" in r/classicwow and old wowhead/twinstar comments from 06-07
---
You are not mistake,  you are DeadTime4.
---
Editing the game files to a different region/language so that game will accept names that normally won’t be allowed. 
---
I have a rogue named “Nuts”.
---
&gt; Because #nochangers were and are still always wrong, and don't know what they are asking for..
---
I think this comes down to the grand irony of #NoChanges being the single biggest change of all. No one back in 2006 was saying "Please don't change the game, Blizzard". They wanted balance, fixes, tweaks, improvements.
---
Hell, look at how badly the phase system screws with the original intent of the patches of Classic. Certain pieces of gear like the ST class quests were added specifically by the devs because it was fixing gear holes, such as the lack of decent pre-endgame trinkets (Which the ST Class quests had a lot of). As well as things like the 2 currently missing AV rep reward items. Those were added later, but they were added to help with gearing issues that existed thanks to hindsight. But now those fixed items are being held back to match the phase they originally launched in, leaving us stuck with the gear gaps they were trying to fix in the first place. Yet we're still rocking 1.12 talents and reitemization because... that's a fine exception I guess.

Why I stopped playing WoW and started playing Halo mcc

The same community telling me the community is killing my Classic WoW community killed me r/classicwow community long ago and now parades its corpse around to taunt me.

I shudder to think that someday I’m going to hear adults unironically walking around saying “omegalol”

Bit late to the party now that BG's hit :P
---
STV is a hippy camp at the moment.
---
Sounds like an ally is bad at pvp
---
in the video he admits of targeting Asmongold while streaming (stream sniping) but what op claimed is that Advertise during his stream was watching Asmongold to gather information and the video doesn't prove any of that
---
You do play a lot. There's always someone else, but Classic has been out 107 days and you have 312 hours. You've played an average of almost 3 hours every day. There's 24 hours in a day so you're spending over 12% of your existence playing WoW at current rates.
---
Griefing in Wow was the only fun after Mists.
---
you are going to need nature for AQ40 and you are going to need a shitload of shadow for Naxx.  BWL is mostly some more fire, on tanks, but I don't think you will need many as a ranged.
---
What macros do you have in mind? I enjoy making em
---
When are you gonna git gud? No one gonna give you loot for being casual
---
Ugh I always get cut off by that graveyard spawn, it’s so frustrating just trying to get back up north.
---
Glad I played wow before social media was such a thing. See wow on the front page is similar to fortenite and modern warfare, everybody just bitching.
---
Really? Like alliance wiped 4/5 times when I played now.
---
Look up the recommended leveling spec for your class on icy veins and stick to it.
---
Fire mages are not the best spec for leveling, group is mad that they can't do a lot of AOE dmg.
---
When we idiots decided to not change classic content to be more balanced and long lasting if you don't minmax someone else will for you... we have literally had 13 years to prepare for minmaxing and well this is kinda what we deserve.
---
AV probably feels like a godsend for warriors. You never have to respect from fury and you get a ton of honor.
---
There's no sure way. Premades typically do a countdown and everyone queues at the same time. When the queue pops you say your BG # in chat, and if enough got into a game you enter, if not you drop queue and try again.
---
You'll commonly have everyone in one discord, then split to different channels based on what BG you get in.
---
There are limited 'completions'. 
---
For example: Getting an epic mount, getting the best set of raid armor, getting a certain rank in pvp, etc.
---
In most respects these sort of things that used to have an end completed state no longer do in retail WoW. You can never get the best gear. You can never finish grinding AP, etc. This is done on purpose to keep the players hooked, but it really makes the game unfulfilling to me.
---
Queue at the same time and keep dropping queue until you get into the same game.
---
also in vanilla people are more likely to post about their hand of rag or thunderfury on their realm forums or guild forums, rather than general forums
---
I thought they banned people when they abused layering inside of instances, specifically, Jed rend kills.
---
don't CoD it. with high price itmes like Krol Blade your competition will try to buy it from you but need it CoD'd. they won't accept the item, leaving it in their mailbox for 3 days until its finally sent back to you. those 3 days suck
---

It is.. https://old.reddit.com/r/ShitPostCrusaders/comments/e98bxo/o_my_god/

i guess he didnt know there is an original

It didn't slowly become like that. When you listen to what people did back in the day, this is nothing new. It's only that the reactions are amplified.
---
I guess we'll have to just disagree here.
---
and im exalted? alliance is getting the better end of the deal
---
This applies to everything in life. Politics, work, money, ideology, religion, fast food.
---
The problem isn't solely with them being russian, the ones that play on english servers are fine. Its when you play with russians that play on russian servers that you encounter problems.
---
This subreddit had alot of potential before the mods opened the meme floodgate.
---
I literally don't know where to go to talk about the game I play the most other than my guild's discord.
---
Anybody have any suggestions for Classic WoW discussion that doesnt center around shitty meme pictures and streamer talk?
---
The others mats drop in BWL and obv a guild will help fund the mats. And farming 2-2.5k gold before phase 3 is not difficult at all
---
This is more of a societal problem than a a game one. People love to complain when things don’t go there way. Any kind of adversity comes? Let’s cry and complain about it. 
---
It’s a game that’s very well made and nothing has even come close to it. People need to stop complaining and enjoy the journey.
---
I wonder howuch of this is PvP servers only. I gave up at lvl 50 on one and rolled to a pve server. Pallies outnumber priests, hunters outnumber mages. People seem mouch more laid back
---
mythic progression in classic wow? amazing!
---
Not too sure. Especially since I've seen a guy on my server named Peatymenis and he's okay! Sorry man. Here I am wishing I could get folks to flag my name for a free change, and I can't lmao.
---
Idk about you, I still have no set goals in the game and just do whatever content I want at whatever pace I want. 
---
Once I told myself that I’m not competing against other players for rank of any sort, it made the experience much more relaxed. Wanting the best of the best will force what you are stating, so you’re either with them or against them, but also have to endure the consequences sequences of going against the grain.
---
&gt; It's a downgrade in most cases
---
LOL
---
Priests
---
The exe name was changed to wowclassic.exe. If you can set that for these programs it should fix them. I had to do this for my Logitech mouse software.
---
this guy wants 2 day long AV's and he wants to force you to sit through them to force his definition of fun on you
---
fuck off
---
if you actually pvp and loot players' bodies, you can turn in everything they drop for rep after wing commanders have been rescued. it gives both AV and org rep.
---
Great post
---
Yeah only getting to 20 in almost 4 months does not seem worth the price of subscription. This is obviously the attitude the post is talking about, but 20 isn't really that time consuming to get.
---
Yeah I bet people don't even give out free bags anymore.

"Why do you have str on your gear? You're a priest. Fkin noobs."

You have been removed from the group.

I was leveling enchanting.

nah :)))))

My guess is bad troll and some poor soul just kept feeding him. Paragraphs of being totally wrong about how a class works in the 19 bracket. His points on 19 druid are like saying 1+1=3 and arguing with the poor sap who says it's 2

https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dcc6i0/chubbys_quest_to_get_a_permanent_ban_removed_for/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share. this is the multiboxer case
---
The Zerg is for rep, it’s not very good honor compared to fighting it out. 
---
Also AV is only really good for ranged classes. Rest just get blown up without being able to do anything.
---
mage
---
Maybe those UD grenades from Strat
---
Same thing. I got kicked as soon as the game started.
---
Awh this is bleak. I got hacked in TBC and noticed a few days later, rang and got it locked. When I recovered they'd been using it to farm Kara trash (at a guess as I was outside Kara with tons of trash loot) and I was like 3k richer. 
---
At least they didn't delete you mount, my mate lost everything when he got hacked in TBC too. Literally every slot empty, bags, bank, etc. Blizz rolled the account back though but it was a shock  for him at least.
---
and you get 2 bomb ass weapons, my warrior lvl 51 with ice barb spear.. OP, and ill have the TuF before im 60 easily
---
Some gamers are just extrinsically motivated like that, and the chase isn't always better than the catch.
---
 Mount is showing up on the vendor here. The spell pen ring is not. [https://clips.twitch.tv/AbstruseSolidArugulaSwiftRage](https://clips.twitch.tv/AbstruseSolidArugulaSwiftRage)
---
I thought people wanted classic to get away from this competitiveness and for the journey??? Am I missing something here?
---
My whole guild is spamming AV rushes but I'm just here like "guys? Premade WSG? It's actually really fun!" 
---
Nope that's SHIT honor/hour
---
Wish I could actually use him then &gt;_&gt;
---
Last I checked it's only allowed if it's one person over the legal age and the rest being minors. Once one of the minors are legally adults you're supposed to make a new account for them. But that was how it was in BC. No idea if it's changed since.
---
Horde generally kills and caps more on the way. Ally zerg straight to boss.
---
&gt; People nowadays seem to have minmax OCD.
---
I send admiring whispers to the level 60 folks who I see running around in really rad looking gear sets which are based purely on looks and NOT stats. 
---
I don't give two shakes if I'm picking the best talents for my character or grinding out the best gear. I play WoW to have fun, not to have a second job.
---
theres more than that too, charging as a warr to a mob or /forfeiting a duel will stop you midair
---
At least with paladin you can jack off during leveling.
---
My thoughts exactly
---
And I believed he meant enjoy sarcastic because warriors roll on gear he needs.
---
Grobb is a garbage server with garbage people. Stay away.
---
Don't worry, 6 more months and you'll have AB! :D
---
The parent comment is about colluding for honor.
---
Feels good being right
---
It happens, and then you get vote kicked from the game for capping the GY that fucks up the corpse runs.
---
if i start a new alt and don't get 20 in the first session I feel like a failure
---
The wsg armor was available phase 3. So should be when ony drops
---
It's funny because op rant could be a forum post back in 2010
---
lol I thought I was the only one doing this back in the day. watch out for that yeti!
---
Yeah, this existed in EQ and DAoC long before WoW came out. Literally sitting in specific camps grinding AAs for 40 hours straight just because it was the most optimal place to be.
---
It’s perfectly safe if it doesn’t explode in a vast inferno and burn your body to ashes, and the Scourge doesn’t outbid the Horde’s contract for the zeppelins by so much as a single copper to send your level 60 asses straight to Icecrown.
---
They added this in Legion for the Paldins Artifact Weapon Ashbringer as a Skin "Corrupted Ashbringer". 
---
You need find both parts of the NatPagle Book (from the classic drop sources) to turn in at a NPC for a really wired "hidden quest" designed around the "speculation from classic".
---
Found the guy who camps flight paths
---
&gt;Maybe I'm generalizing with too broad of strokes,
---
It's called projecting. You're projecting your old problems onto the people you're currently having a problem with, and it's completely normal human psychology.
---
you're a failure for thinking that /s
---
Ye I was thinking the red error message in top middle of your screen, which is usually from addons.
---
Tell me what you replace it with.
---
Because you are wrong.
---
Feral is a really bad spec for PvP.   You have no real way to catch up to people or slow them to do damage in cat besides shifting in and out.  And when you shift a few times you go OOM and die.
---
I would suggest tanking for the group if running AV if you are dead set on playing feral but every other Druid spec is much better for PvP.
---
Their*
---
Idiot.
---
Im sad to see firemaw represented like that :/ Atleast it seems to be hord side.
---
we honestly should be able to queue just your own server, not that this is ok, but cross bgs are silly if thats the only queue, i like my server people
---
This is why I made a twink. Having a blast in WSG in the 29 bracket. I have a 56 warrior that I farm gold with and that's all he does. Will probably make another twink and just spend the rest of my time in WSG and AB when it's released. Having a great time.
---
At 19 Paladins are as tanky as druids, have pushback resist, don’t have to form switch to heal and have freedom for root removal parity. Druid twinks  are the poor faction’s paladin twinks
---
I just got kicked from one for not zerging
---
&gt;Because it's just so unnecessary and try hard. This dude spent 10x more time unnecessarily gearing to do raids than actually raiding.

The point is that you aren't only gearing for raids, you are gearing for the next 2 raids.
---
That is the whole thing about classic. You can actually complete a lot of slots with gear right now and labeling stuff like hoj/lionheart/sgc as 'pre-bis' is misleading at best.
---
Whether or not it's a projection of something I've experienced does not change the validity of the statement. Even if I haven't experienced this, it still does not change the validity of the statement.
---
PvE wants it for the competetive herb/ore gathering spots, so you can beat that dirty alliance/horde player to the node.
---
The tragedy of the commons strikes again
---
Yeah, my bad.
---
Retail is for you brotha.
---
I'd suck a dick for 3 things to 'fix' av. Tethered marshals, marshal buffs, and party queue (but NO raid queue). I feel like this would fix a majority of the issues people have had with it.
---
WTF
---
/r/blackmagicfuckery
---
AB is the most favorited BG because there's no chance to get stuck in the bg for hours for no honor when you unluckily find yourself in a turtle AV
---
Exactly.  Now he's bitching about classic so he can go back to BFA.
---
He's in it for the cash, and that's it.  I'm baffled more people can't see through his insincere enthusiasm.
---
How does this work? Is the exalted mount cheaper then the faction mounts?
---
yea except the opposite is more likely but good luck honey
---
I can tell you as one of the level 48 alliance players who couldn't put in the time required to hit 60 by the time honor went live, things got extremely demoralizing really quickly. I was doing my thing as a less-than-badass priest then became a farm animal. 
---
Until this week it had been next to impossible to efficiently level. Sure people found ways, but I basically had to give up my main until battlegrounds began.
---
If you have a job or other real life responsibilities I would just give up now its not worth it.
---
You will be playing 12+ hours a day for a couple months at least.
---
Do you think you would also be completely happy on PvP if you were on flamelash or something?
---
i thought the gamer dads quit but i guess they were just in hiding from p2
---
Begun the premade wars have
---
It is, and a lot of the players doing this have come from retail. This mentality has been retail mentality for almost 10 years now. I'm not surprised at all that players are coming to Classic with this mindset, as it's all they have known.
---
For non-combat abilities specifically you have to just use the ability over and over again.  Like for dash, you don't even have to be in combat just keep using it until you learn it.  Can take a while with the cooldown and all.
---
A hecking men to that my dude.
---
wrong on literally every account, congratulations!
---
Yea noone wanna join wsg just to be farmed by twinks.
---
People seem to have forgotten retail exist. If they dont "have time to be in x amount of times to play" then dont whine about minimizing what's already grindy to get to the max as it is. That's why retail is in its current state
---
Lol thank you !
---
I think they should get a nice 30 day vacation for that
---
you seem stupid as fuck 
---
need an /s lil dummy?
---
Thank you for fighting the good fight but this guy has to just be a troll. Everything you said in this chain is absolutely accurate and you obviously have played a lot of 19 druid. As someone who played 19 druid through vanilla and BC, I appreciate your effort and hate to see your expertise wasted on a troll. 
---
Did you like to run imp roots build? I used to skip imp roots and put those points into Furor for the 40% chance on shift to get off an insta bash. I prefer imp roots if I'm support or pugging with another FC but the insta bash was really helpful when FCing. Used to argue this with other druids in my battlegroup.
---
That's what I thought it was
---
I agree, but that describes a large percentage of this game. A lot of it isn’t skill based. That’s why so many people like it. Appeals to a larger base. 
---
Most of the things you can accomplish in this game as a whole can be done simply by playing a lot. Grinding a lot.
---
Are you Horde?  It's probably &lt;Storm&gt;
---
Oh Damn awesome, I’m farming the rep anyways for the off hand so two birds with one stone!
---
There were min-maxers and there were, especially in the ABs I played all the time, pre-mades that came in and rolled PUGs. But it was every. single. BG. 
---
I knew I'd be behind, too. But I also thought there'd be a few moments here and there where I could escape the min-max shit, like it was for me, at least, in vanilla. But it's only been dungeons where I found that, which, I've had fun in them, sure, but they're not all I was hoping to have another shot at.
---
Nodes were removed from AV in 1.12. Considering Op even addressed the fact that it wasn’t on a private server I’m guessing you’re just being an ass.
---
That backpedal is the stuff of legends!
---
But spam running Maw of Souls was unironically really fun.
---
NOOOOOOOO SPEND 5 HOURS GETTING LOST IN BRD OR YOU'RE NOT HAVING FUN
---
STOP IT STOP RUINING MY GAME EXPERIENCE REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE MY WIFE SAYS I CANT PLAY ANYMORE STOP IT
---
For the r14s 1 million + honor because everyone’s going ham for AV rep
---
Sometimes we go two weeks without playing at all. Is this supposed to keep me from playing? We’re busy people, and only play when we can play together.
---
Well, lets be honest. Heartseeker is full of the "just let them win" crowd. They did all transfer because they were scared.
---
Its the same people who complained about retail wow only being about end game....and here we are in classic wow l m f a o
---
No need to cheat and buy gold, and be dumb enough to use the same login details on their site?
---
I've had this happen as well. Mix/Maxers are nothing but neck beards who watched a youtube video or two. Honestly I feel sorry for them, they've been given a gift and they're squandering it.
---
What phrase do people in the horde AVs say?
---
For alliance, they are saying "Don't be a kek, rush straight to Drek".
---
I like the sound of "Be a man, go straight to Vann" but people probably say something else.
---
Maybe this is that was meant by "you think you do, but you don't"
---
He's having the last laugh...
---
&gt; Why do we feel efficiency and paths of least resistance are the way to go 100% of the time
---
I dont think thats true, most competitive games like Dota 2, CS:GO, League, Overwatch, TFT, Hearthstone, etc. Have Normal games and Rank games, in normals people play things they dont really know how to play, weird, troll builds, do stupid things, laugh with friends, etc and in rank they follow the meta and tryhard. we could theorize all we want about a way to make this happen in Classic BGs but i think it defeats the purpose, this game is 15 years old and people want to play it exactly because of that.
---
&gt; Why do gamers feel they need to always reach for the 1% now? 
---
If we talk about competitive games then people want to win, that's part of the fun, when both teams are tryharding and the match is hard then things get heated, it's exciting, its fun, even if you lose but in this boomer ass game tryharding means losing lmao. Also i dont know if people really try to reach the 1% or rather just play to win and get better, you can have fun in very different ways. It does sadden me too about how people are playing this game, as someone who didnt play Vanilla, Classic was really fun in P1, leveling with friends, the WPVP encounters and zones i had never seen but after hitting lvl 60 the flaws of this game became really noticeable, still enjoyable but after P2 the game died for me, the way people started playing just wasn't fun and i'm a horde player on a horde dominated server, right now i'm in the WOTLK waiting room or at least P3 because i have never done BWL and raids are fun for me, even if they're easy.
---
The caster ring is only usable by Priest, Warlock and Mage.

---
you seem angry over someone being right
---
i played this shit when i was 8 and was able to figure it out, how do grown ass adults need 'help' with a fucking chat lmao
---
At no point in the past four months did you accidentally hit the enter button? Idk man, the internet has made a lot of us pretty jaded. Seems pretty unbelievable.
---
When I played during Vanilla, the only real comparable games were things like Everquest and Star Wars Galaxies. People understood not just the value of a community that wanted to have fun with each other, but that the fun came from valuing the community.
---
We now live in a time of genre over-saturation and speed-running optimized endgame content. People’s priorities have shifted, and the majority of today’s gamers are not the kind of folks who used to have to map out their game with pencil and a pad of graph paper next to their keyboard. Quality of Life was created client-side; not demanded server-side. 
---
I was hoping the prevailing communal attitude would be that of Vanilla—that enough of us would be welcoming those who came after to a version of the game long gone. Instead it’s the other way around.
---
Where'd you get the idea that I cheat and buy gold?
---
This made me lol
---
They broke you
---
Welcome to the Sociopath Social Club
---
Honestly, I think the answer is to unsubscribe from this terrible subreddit. If you were to just play the game w/o this cesspool of griefing, it would be incredibly enjoyable.
---
take your poor brain elsewhere
---
Winning isn't important, getting the most honour is, have you never noticed how Horde almost always have twice the honour by the end even whilst losing? You're not going to convince people to be less effecient.
---
or maybe theyre just too simple to figure out something a 6 year old could
---
what discussion? your projection over your failures as a Content Creator?
---
Yeah then you waste 20 seconds of your time and 400 seconds of enemy time!
---
I've done around 50 AVs so far, I've had exactly 1 AV become a real BG and even that was just until our rogues stuck behind the Alliance turtle and capped their graveyard, where we proceeded to just zerg their boss again.
---
 When did this community become less about the journey and more about the destination? You aren't going to get rank 14, and you are ruining the game for people who don't want to min max. 
---
Truer words have never been spoken
---
I've opened up two tickets now for this, first one, basically he said well dont be afk... thanks dude. And now the second one told me well you should report this harassment ingame by right clicking on their name... which you cant do after its happened since its crossrealm... thanks blizzard
---
I have been doing tribute runs with 5 piece set of GS for a least a month before this started happening. I noticed it too and it makes the run extremely longer and annoying having to coordinate them... I believe it's a threat bug from the last two patches. Because before them I never had any problems with this.
---
Part of the fun is griefing players, don’t tell me how to have fun
---
This is the type of person who still plays this game after 15 years. It is how they are and it is how they will always be.
---
Rep &gt; Honor.   When everyone has 200k honor a day yours literally does not matter.
---
When it spread enough blizz made something, i hope.
---
2k? Those are rookie numbers. 3k or bust.
---
im about to snap. why is there nothing on google showing where to queue up for av? Im running around alterac mountains, cant find it. Im horde.
---
Haha. This is me. An Alliance player even came and fished next to me yesterday at the south pool. Then one of my horde team mates killed him. I was so sad.
---
Even got some nightfin fish in the evening. Mainly salmons during the day. Quite a few lightning eels.
---
Appreciate the insight, maybe I’m over thinking it. Cheers! 
---
Ps: Wish you coulda seen the 12+ hour AVs, they were something!
---
That jump doesn't work
---
Having a ton of stam looks cool.
---
Huh yep. 15 years. This is the first time I noticed he has purple eyes!
---
I don't have those?
---
I used an example for the sake of argument.
---
I'm a software engineer.
---
I don't care about content creation LOL.
---
Are you okay buddy?
---
Been kicked from multiple games in a row now, waiting for the gates to open. Really shitty of people.
---
lol sure buddy, keep up the youtube videos!
---

---
Get a life, dude.
---
But he told me himself he was miserable doing it. If that's what he wanted to do Idc but it's the fact people are going out of their way to have less fun in order to get some arbitrary number increase that rlly fucking doesn't matter in the long run
---
I'm in the same boat, man. I dabbled a bit on pservers, got a character to 75 in WotLK, and stopped playing. Classic is more or less brand new to me, and I've been having a blast with it (even if p2 sucked).
---
GROB MOVB
---
Ignorance is a bless. The more you know, sometimes the worst it gets. 
---
Who are the happiest people in the world? Just generally happy? Why teenagers are so angsts?
---
Ironic.
---
 And you can click and drag them to the key ring icon as well.
---
i've been playing since they implemented that and i've always had that debuff before being kicked. have not played classic, though.
---
I would guess also since MC is cleared hundreds of times each week the eye drops more frequently than vanilla with 10-15 clears every week
---
Watch out, the more you know...
---
Oh you didn't preface it with competitive raiding. I thought you were talking about everyone
---
I am half way through honored and it just happened to me the 3rd time, in US
---
That's one of the reasons I stopped playing people kept sucking the fun out of the game
---
Can you link that optimal farming moonfury build please?
---
Really? I rolled around all the spots in Silithus and found 3 rich veins the whole loop. With the drop rate of crystals and other valuables being so low, I figured this was a red herring for moneymaking.
---
Lol ya, reminds me of a quote my buddy told me when I was in college: “Procrastination is like masturbation: seems like a good idea at first, but in the end you’re just fucking yourself.”
---
And you can't just erase 15 years of that community as much as you want the nostalgia to work.
---
&gt; The reputation will matter. If you do wrong, you won't get invited anywhere
---
The biggest lie people still believe. Nobody gives a shit if you ninja something, you might get some spam in tradechat or whatever which is promptly forgotten. Big deal if your resident boomer guild blacklists someone from their weekly Scarlet monastery runs or whatever.
---
First I had to deal with the horde on Stalagg, now I have to deal with the sweaties from Faerlina :(
---
I think this is a "Your Mileage May Vary" situation. I'm having a great time raiding with  my guild, and yeah the content seems easier than it did 15 years ago, but if you can find a good group of people and just have a good time doing whatever content you want to do in classic I think you'll have a blast. Not always easy to find though.
---
It doesn't matter if it's already set to passive, it will bring your pet back to you
---
Oh my surprise to see a windseeker, alliance? My wife and I played there, stopped for now.
---
what does that have to do with peoples obsession with min/maxing/speed running/etc? corpse camping has never been a minmax thing.
---
Go play retail
---
LOL so mad you link me shit i dont care about  
---
whats wrong? someone finally call out on projecting and lying after your failure?
---
Holy mother of projection, your comment history is nothing but nerd rage
---
atlas loot addon has relatively accurate loot tables for dungeons, as well as other useful info
---
Cool. So what happens when you want to kite something? Have to start using the passive option now instead of Call Pet? I think I'll have them look at this because its not just myself seeing issues with the patch.
---
games are a no fun zone...you didn't know that?!?
---
I played 15 years ago. Was super hyped about Classic. Played way too much after release. Leveled to 60. Started an alt and made it to 39. Gave up. 
---
I gave up because the people at 60 were no fun and trying to recapture the magic on an alt was impossible. I told friends that I would not be one of those who fell off in the first few months but I was wrong. Min/max and direct routing and stuff really ruined it for me. The BiS obsession is out of control. But I guess I logged off for the last time when it occurred to me how insanely stupid the Spy add-on is. 
---
To those of you still in Azeroth, I wish you luck fighting the scourge of BiS Min/Max fun suckers. May your blades never dull.
---
But why is the game more fun than retail, then?
---
I'm serious. I tried playing retail. I can't have fun with it anymore.
---
Despite everything, I'm still having fun. Even through the worst of P2, it was still fun. Why?
---
Ya, kinda ironically, I originally used WoW as a way to stay away from other addictions (going to the bar, lotsa drugs).. so it helped save me money and got me out of some pretty bad habits I had formed.
---
Yeah but like how it’s a rock
---
That's why I made a 19, 29, 39, 49 and no 60. People fight for the battle and the victories in WSG, it's not about the honor and loot so there is far less toxicity. I love the PvP in this game but people ruin everything.
---
How to win ah as horde with while gaining massive amounts of honor
---
Step 1: kill Alliance tank
---
Step 2 : do AV things 
---
Step 3: win
---
If you're not getting 150k+ honor per day then you're not going to be competitive for R14 on my server.
---
This is /r/classicwow , not /r/wow . It may occur in retail, but I have not seen it so far in classic bgs
---
I'm not mad - I'm kind of surprised.
---
I figured that any rational person when presented surmounting evidence would accept that they're delusional and move on with their lives.
---
Yet, you're still here.
---
I hope everything's good at home, man.
---
The things your dad said or that girl at school said aren't true, and things can get better if you hang in there.
---
go back to playing your clicker game baby boy
---
&gt;*it has less to do with media folks and more about ease of information*
---
Who do you think is propagating the information and mindset?
---
Even if you run where you’re supposed to, they’ll probably kick you for having a slow mount. There’s no winning.
---
I’m just happy my comment bothered you enough that you’re still here
---
Yep. I figure: if I never knew what that keybind did before now, I won't miss having it.
---
This happened to me to. I just made a macro that casts call pet and commands it to follow. Not sure why it started happening.
---
Well seeing as all U.S. servers are linked in matchmaking, it's not like they all had to wait turns to get their AGMs. These guys are mostly from different servers as far as I've seen.
---
&gt; When did this community become less about the journey and more about the destination?
---
Hard to even enjoy the journey when you’re being ganked constantly and the server imbalance makes the game unplayable for a good number of players.
---
I love WSG. How is WSG not about skill? 
---
&gt; AB requires individual skill to win the small skirmishes that come with fighting for each point 
---
and WSG doesn't? If you're returning the flag and its you vs the flag carrier with the game on the line its not about skill?
---
The point is not that it should be impossible to kill someone while feared. The point is it should be impossible to take someone from 100% to dead in a single fear. 
---
I'm kinda speaking too much in absolutes, but yeah. Fear still has plenty of utility if it breaks after X damage. Use it to bandage, use it to run away, use it to heal your pet (or whatever warlocks do idk), use it to just burn time on some other cd you need, etc. It should _not_ have the utility of "if you happen to get the jump on your opponent and cast this, you win"
---
im just happy my comment bothered you enough that you looked into my history
---
keep on being a loser
---
Because you think you do but you don’t,
---
As much stamina &amp; intellect as possible.
---
Not a bad thing, but I enjoy games with an RPG aspect. I love trying to come up with new fun specs to try, using gear I think has synergy with that, or fuck just doing/using what looks cool to me. I ain’t about trying to be the best, just trying to have fun. The only problem I have with BiS lists and optimal specs is that you will be ridiculed for not using them. Is this not an RPG? I also have no problem with someone wanting to be the best but those of us just trying to play a fun game shouldn’t be disrespected.
---
I think this was around TBC launch at various stores like gamestop and whatnot
---
So my add on says the av rings are live in 2.5, but many online say it’s 5. Anyone know for sure?
---
i do! but i really enjoy real AV real fights instead this shitty race to kill the boss
---
I was thinking the same thing. Taking a quick 3k Honor in AV every 8-10 minutes seems a lot better than queueing into a bunch of Ally premades in WSG. I predict the number of Ally premades will also be very high since it's most likely going to be the best Ally honor/hr and Ally already has shorter queue times to make scouting a more viable strategy. Time will tell.
---
They never really took off.
---
It has been 1 day since BG's released. Of course everyone is going to be spamming that in the beginning.
---
Pretty sure you can do a lot of things in wow besides compete with other players for rank
---
It is? I thought that mount was much cheaper, hence it being so popular.
---
Butthurt much?
---
LOVE this post
---
The only way to win is not to play.
---
An alliance server has a mod in one guild but they’re hoarding it
---
I’d never charge a level 22 anything. Yes, they probably have a main with gold, but if they don’t, that 55s means they might have to wait to train and that sucks.
---
Why do they do this? is it not possible to join a specific av instance with your whole premade? Sorry for the question but I don't fully understand how queueing with premades works and why they choose to resort to this?
---
Ya that’s why I quit months ago. You could tell early on that the meta was going to be toxic as hell. It’s not the same game.
---
Wait, you guys are having *fun*?
---
&gt; i got stuck in a match fighting in the middle, took 45 mins, but then we (horde) won - way prefer that than losing 4 or 5 times
---
Honestly I'd prefer that to _winning_ four or five times with no effort, variation, or actual pvp.
---
Seems like someone had enough....*whistles away
---
I think it's a younger generation thing. Every game is a competition to be the best and have the best. Hell, with social media, even life is like that.
---
They dont know any other way to play.
---
PVE Moonkin checking in. Having a great time doing what I want. Nobody gets to tell me that my fun is wrong.
---
Zerging and winning is efficient for rep farming. This is the alliance strategy for AV exalted items. They dont care about honor despite horde getting 2 to 3 times the amount of honor per most games done this way.
---
Listening to even people I *enjoy playing with* parrot on and on and on about "BiS" every single time we were going to do anything whatsoever ingame really killed a lot of my excitement in Classic... like guys can we just do a Scholo run 'cause we wanna kill some skeletons n shit?
---
Well what we’ve been saying in the battleground chat is to go do Warsong Gulch for PvP if you want that. AV is for rep. 
---
“Rush Drek or GTFO!”
---
I have to say, from all the 40 AV's I've played, there's probably only been 1 to 3 cases where Stonehearth GY was left alone. There's always someone who captures it. What's often worse is that there's always someone who pulls all 4 of the cleaving dwarfs by Vann, causing a wipe 99% of the time.
---
AV was literally just released, so a lot of people are probably still learning, and there will be many more of them when weekend starts.
---
and its not against TOS either!
---
2 minutes
---
3 of the these things literally kill instantaneously, and the other is WoW.
---
Well. Shit.
---
You cant name urself nuts? I played with a guy from late vanilla to end of wotlk with the name pungkulan basicly ballsack or testicle in Swedish but he got legendary weapon ina tryhard guild so eventually someone reported him lol. But damn it took som time.
---
He's an entertainer.  He knows what he's doing and anyone talking about him, good or bad, gets his name out there.  He's probably making more fans from all the people that seem to shit on him.
---
When you had the Corrupted Ashbringer and went to Scarlet Monastery to do the event there, and resurrect Fairbanks, he even hints at going to Outland to forge a new Ashbringer. I don't know why they dropped this storyline
---
blame blizz for not giving us group q
---
is it a specific animal mount, or do they have choices for each race?
---
I'd gladly go do WSG if afk'ing in AV killing 3 NPCs didn't give MUCH better honor. As you say, AV is for rep. The rep is piss easy to grind. Once most people are exalted, they'll start playing AV for fun and we'll have longer games with actual PvP. The fact that we get more honor for afk pve in AV than real PvP in Warsong is the real problem here don't you think?
---
If he wasn't a streamer he would do the same thing. All serious players roll with a premade, I don't get the condescending tone.
---
Resto druid fulfils the criteria.
---
Damn thats nuts! Im so glad that when i joined a anger spam group i got it on my 2nd run lol. (Probably killed him 5-6 times total)
---
#NoChangesUnlessIPersonallyDislikeIt
---
Elvui? Details? Those I've had issues with blocking some functions.
---
Your fun is wrong!
---
- Nobody (me)
---
When one strategy becomes the dominant way to play esp in AV there is not much to do. Also graveyard spawns, the layout and the fact that NPCs and lieutenants do not damage at all (you can solo lieutenants) makes it not much better. Blizzard needs to intervene when it comes to AV. Either just give us the 1.6 version or nerf honor by like 80-90% from AV. Nobody wanted this 8 min rush shit.
---
The first time a topic on which one could be legitimately considered an expert IRL (long-standing profession, advanced degree, etc.) gets a lot of traction in a non-specialist subreddit can be a pretty eye-opening experience.  You're used to reading a lot of commentary couched in emphatic, highly confident language all over the place on here, and maybe you kinda just take that at face value like I did.  But suddenly, on this one particular topic, you see a lot of that same forceful certainty—often highly upvotes and repeated frequently—that you know to be incomplete and misleading at best and flat out wrong much of the rest of the time.  
---
Now maybe I'm just particularly naive or whatever and others are already sufficiently skeptical before they have this type of experience, but people are commenting this way and others are upvoting it.
---
I've had free water with port. I pay 1g. There are plenty, ignore asshats
---
I raise my glass to you, a PvE gamer dad carebear, for being proud of having rolled on a PvE server.
---
Silvermoon is from tbc...
---
My only thoughts are that it's either a meeting stone or that I'm getting Indiana Jones vibes
---
Asmongold has no skill and life, so it’s ideal for him.
---
same reasoning applies if you kill harpies in the cave. People do it for the quest/exp yet it contributes nothing to the raid. So you should be kicked for that too.
---
You don't get rep for the BG itself but every win will yield 3 tokens which can be turned in for 3300 exp. Given a victory can be often 8 minutes (Round it to 10 for the pre-battle + queue) and you're looking at 19800 an hour. That's pretty damn hefty given the extremely low effort it requires.
---
No, that was Spruce Goose.
---
You wont be able to play anyways.
---
You’d be surprised by the names that blizzard restricts you too, or else you’ll see people with names such as Jaina, Thrall, or Arthas. Yeah, you can have names put names such as ballsack or boobs but def run the risk of someone reporting you. That’s why i always name them something that most likely won’t get reported, like nuts lol.
---
Additionally, sounds like the last ban wave was about a week or so ago. You can generally tell when a ban wave went out because botting/cheating forums ERUPT.
---
For fun: [here's an album](https://imgur.com/a/ZzSGi) of cheater anger from a ban wave in Overwatch some years ago. It's delicious.
---
you can't enter AV till 51, so how does that even make sense
---
We started reporting the reporters afk. If everyone does this, hopefully they’ll stop. In our bgs, they’ve been open about why they’re doing this so it’s easy to tell who they are.
---
they likely have 40 people and will kick everyone until the premade is in
---
Let me go grab my cane.
---
I watched Nolan Ryan pitch when I was a kid playing little league. But I never expected to play like him. Streamers are just Nolan Ryan. Play at the level you can attain and have fun.

I always remember when patch 4.3 came out in WoW and it removed the floor in Icecrown Citadel before the vampire boss.
---
That is how wierd WoW coding is.
---
Or Ion, the current lead dev for retail and classic, used to do a ~60min video talk with some community questions bi-monthly. I really enjoyed those, but they stopped because (i assume) people were always bitching about them because they did not care about specific questions or they saw the info on wowhead ptr 2 weeks ago
---
Its not a rock its wow classic
---
The community ruined classic.
---
Gotcha. I think I’ll stick with it then. That was very helpful!
---
This has already been posted. Yes it broke totem timers and add ons. The macro to cancel your totems is also broken so don't rely on it.
---
I think this is the main thing that prevents adults from enjoying games as much as they did when they were younger.
---
This isn't Original Classic. Tell me how it is when someone here gets it.
---
I agree with this post, if you're not rushing Drek you are a bot.
---
You gonna cry?
---
AB takes less skill than WSG lol
---
And rank 14 doesn't mean that much it could also mean you play 24/7 and make you look like a loser
---
You can enter with a krol blade equipped at 46
---
It's such a weird concept to me. I've never played mmorpgs to compete. Just to have fun.
---
Eots seems like a good idea on paper but in practice its lame. You essentially get the worst part of both ab and wsg.
---
My mistake, I assumed you were the other guy since threads this deep typically keep to two people. However, the main point still stands.
---
I'm not saying that they should change it, but the entire point of the thread is to discuss whether or not it's a good system; which it clearly isn't. If classic plus happens this is a system that should change. I'm okay with not reaching things, in fact the majority of the time I've spent playing WoW I haven't achieved most things. However, being okay with the system doesn't make it a good one.
---
I didn't say they had no impact, I'm just saying they're far from the only or main reason. Pretty much anyone just wanting to google a bit about their class will find min/maxed talents, bis gear, and leveling guides as the top results. It's extremely easy to fall into that min/max hole
---
Min/Maxers and their behavior ruined it for me.  People bitching and moaning about optimized specs, BiS, and the non fucking stop ganking.  Not worth it.
---
Stop sperging, you little shit. You sound so fucking stupid.
---
But that's an extra 5 av runs! /s

I mean they technically are summoning their guild if you click it.

It's sorted by time of creation. The new ones are always at the bottom.
---
Well, happy to report that this is going well, haha. Managed to have a couple games already tonight that have gone closer to what I'm hoping because of doing just what you're saying, so thanks for that. Even got the Drek wipe and turned it into a win, was a fun BG.
---
I wonder if this comes from the focus on STEM glorification as of late. If you're pruning everyone to be engineers then they're going to look at everything as an efficiency puzzle. Just a theory, anyway.
---
Name checks out
---
Definitely. Most of the time I run south and die, then just try to slow up the horde with novas/blizzard on the bridge.
---
And since edgemaster's exist, any race  van easily get weapon skill.
---
Thank you very much! 
---
Wow was using the wrong graphic card.
---
Honestly i never believed in stereotypes but this is true, grobbulus is full of private server kids who think they’re better than everyone else
---
Which pservers did you play on?
---
Never had the need to chat. My only other party members was sitting next to me. Believe what you will lol.
---
I do this on my druid but rogue is better as you can vanish and avoid fighting the bugs but point is, only 2 classes can access these veins efficiently and with little herbs on surface and many people in BGs there is very little competition for veins or herbs in this zone. Take up herbs and check black lotus on your loop around the zone and you can make a lot of gold here. I certainly have.
---
Truth!

Hahaha.. love little yoda

bloodseeker is BIS until you get rok

I honestly doubt many people who play games now could ever get even a single 99 on Runescape. Toxicity is also pretty popular and people will go far and wide just to ruin someone else's day.

Hello fellow Windseeker! Yes we are both Gnomes. She’s a mage and I’m a warlock. Let me know if you guys start playing again, would love to have more people to play with casually.

Even easier solution --

open up your bank, right click the key from the bank, it will auto-move to your keyring.  Or if the key is in your bag currently: open bank, right click from bag to move to bank, then right click from bank and it moves to keyring.
---
Might have to wait for the add-on devs to update their stuff. It seems like the patch changed some things that interact with several add-ons and all that needs to be done is for the add-on programmers to update accordingly.
---
So I realized just now that the warlock symbol has a hand reaching out

Which graveyard?

know what will be dope? the next two expac re-releases. we're in for a great few years here.
---
Wrong hut.  There is no way to bypass this hut in question afaik without having faction collusion to charge up a slope.
---
How is WSG not about skill? I mean yeah if u get pug teams that tunnel vision mid and just fight there uselessly while EFC runs by I guess you are right.. But movement with the flag IS part of the skill required. Protect FC, coordinate on EFC, move as a grp while fighting back, call out incs, kite and not die with flag... I don't agree that AB is more skill intensive. No way.
---
The real answer: once they hit 60.
---
My only complaint is being stuck in my mid 30s... no love, except the love Desolace gives you. At least it's good for making money.
---
This guy gets it. We didn’t know about party chat, whispering, or all the / shortcuts. My only party member had been sitting next to me the whole time. We had no need to learn how to chat until we met a friend.
---
This is a gaming problem in general. Gamers have ruined gaming. It's all about topping meters, leading k/d ratios, hitting diamond game masters, world firsts, and a whole host of other shit that has nothing to do with fun.
---
Blizzard can't fix what is truly killing WoW and gaming in general. They can't out design the hive mind, the meta public perception, warcraftlogs, or raider.io.
---
Games, especially those that focus on multi-player, would be in a great place if it wasn't for the players that play them.
---
Lootboxes and micro transactions aren't the enemy. Other gamers are.
---
female is where its at my man
---
Explain? Stealing rocks?
---
Sorry but as someone who raided in class wow and made rank 11 for pvp, minmaxing was always a thing. The people that came into wow with a determination to be server firsts were the same folks that previously raided Planes of Power and Omens of War in EQ and they had raiding down to an art. 
---
There was no optional builds if you were pushing content. You either did the raids with correct build or you were told to fuck off and replaced with someone who would.
---
I think I read somewhere that you can queue as a premade for wsg as normal, but not for av for some reason. Could be wrong tho
---
Metabitch
---
Thus is wow PvP so it doesn't take skill. You are playing the wrong game if you're looking for skillful PvP.
---
I’ve 100% been telling people at start of AVs that I’m gonna be questing and they can come with
---
I mean you're not wrong. world chat was just a bunch of doomsayers for 2 weeks during the transfer window.
---
rotation changed some, but not much.  im mostly talking about the change from int+sp to pure str based.  i liked stacking int as a prot pally.  i liked actually having a mana pool.  lol
---
High skill WSG can be controlled by 2 people with 18 people attempting to stop them.
---
Me and my fourth form chums thought it would be quite corking if you'd hand over your mine too the local alliance resource concern
---
It was inevitable IMO. There was this idealized view of vanilla that was bound to disappoint some when they saw it and played it for real (again). Plus, peer pressure is a bitch. Lots of people were adamant they wouldn't get tempted to rush through the game, and instead would enjoy the journey. Then the pressure to level up quickly to raid took over.
---
Even from a social side there's a decay. My guild has resisted the leveling race pretty well, and focused more on content and camraderie. But the novelty of classic has started to wear off, and most people (including our GM, who was very hostile to retail and pro-classic) have basically quit classic. Lots of excuses, but ultimately it boils down to the shine wearing off for various reasons. And as more people drift away it creates a domino effect: fewer people online means fewer people to socialize with, which means less draw to play.
---
Not saying you're wrong at all. Lots of crumby attitudes throughout the classic circuit that deserve to be called out. But I think it was bound to happen. Oh well, it was fun while it lasted. And for some it is still fun and vibrant. And at least we all have a nice choice now.
---
Interestingly, I popped back onto retail today because my son wanted to play a race-class combo he couldn't do in classic. And he wanted me to run with him. It was a lot busier than I expected it to be.
---
Crest of Retribution with thorium spikes, Mirahs Song, for armor Deathbone set/energized chestplate/chitonous leggings/basically anything plate with stamina and intellect. Spell power is useful for consecration too if you have it on trinkets and rings. Really you just want as much damage mitigation, hp and mana as you can get. Nothing else matters with the build I use. Half of the gear I was wearing was mail +healing gear or random blues I'd held onto from dungeons. 
---
Use this build. https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/550001-053250230001-05005050202
---
Use ret aura, blessing of sanctuary, and consecration on cd. Pull big packs into a corner to keep them all in front of you so you can block and do more damage with crest and spikes. Keep seal of light up. The amount of parrying you will be doing along with the fast attack speed of Mirahs Song will keep you healed. If you need more healing judge and reseal light. If you need mana, judge wisdom and reseal light.

I farmed SM GY using this method and made enough gold for my epic mount in a week. I could have done it in less if I started charging people for runs, but I didn't feel like dealing with people being idiots and pulling pats and slowing me down. I wrote this up really quickly before bed so any questions about gearing or the build let me know.

bahaha this gave me a good laugh
---
I’m sure others have already said this. I know because darkest dungeon sub was mentioned. But there are a lot of games people are still passionate about that aren’t mired in such complaining. Terraria and Stardew come to mind as well. And even the Xcom subreddit is super fun because the suffering is the meme. It’s like a support group xD
---
Just my personal opinion, but i think you should absolutely stick with the hit items.
---
In my opinion, every % of hit we get pre-ZG is almost vital (even then with ZG it's still vital, just a bit more obtainable). 
---
If you want to PM me with some logs if you have them, I'd be happy to go over them and see what's causing the majority of the difference
---
I want to say lockboxes got hit with the (1.8 or 1.9) patch that nerfed world chests.

We aren’t really concerned about the subscription costs, we just like it. Sometimes we don’t play for weeks, but we keep coming back.

That’s the beauty. There is no right or wrong way to play. We are playing at our pace and have a lot to learn still.
---
We do too but it’s difficult if we mess up and don’t split the groups right. Last week was rough with 7 heals lol

R14 wannabe guys aren't actually good players, so they can't get gladiator or do mythic content. what they lack in skills they make up for In time.So how do you make yourself feel superior? You play an very easy game that all you need to be the "best" is unlimited time.

Assuming you were right at 5,000 RP, and you gained the absolute maximum possible RP that week, the highest you could get is to 17,000 RP, which would put you 40% through Rank 5. The only way Rank 6 would be possible is if you're almost to Rank 4.
---
[Boomers must rise up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cihyP5bAcc)
---
I get the sentiment, but I think there is something to be said about the feel bad gaming creates when you aren't going the most efficient route.
---
Like, knowing I'd need to spend an extra 100 hours doing something if I don't go the efficient route is a buzzkill.
---
Imo a properly balanced game leads to more fun overall.
---
If everyone can reach the finish line around the same time, efficiency matters a lot less.
---
&gt; I don't know why they dropped this storyline
---
Wonder how many time that's been asked over the past 14+ years.
---
The best way to do it for yourself would be to casually grind like 5ish hours a day until about rank 6-7, then do 5-6ish hours a day with hardcore gameplay on the weekends(prolly only need to do this for 2ish weeks) until rank 8-9. And then no life the game for a week to make the quick jump into 10. It’s not too demanding in this honor system to hit rank 10.
---
Time is money friends
---
BRD pickpocket killing two bosses like guzu golding farm and others brd tutorials.
---
It's the job of the game to account for this, period
---
With Classic of course, we all want them to not change anything, so it won't be accounted for
---
I still think Classic is MUCH, MUCH better at accounting for this behavior than Retail. For me, I haven't felt the urge to min-max in Classic at all.
---
Don't make me get my main
---
I have fun. I stay off reddit for the most part too. Probably has something to do with it
---
It starts with Blizzard. If they give us shitty versions of the game to play on people will only make the shittiness of it worse.
---
If they dont do them, they fall behind the curve, which also isnt fun. Thus; Forcing you to complete all the quests to keep up with said curve.
---
A ton of people know what to do now.  It will be harder than MC but it will definitely be puggable.
---
i was 48 when honor hit. made sixty in 10 days. It was really hard. I'd level an alt when my quest objective was being camped. The only respite was being in a dungeon but of course you had to get to it first. I got pretty much pre-raid BIS, had a couple MC drops, few ONY kills... rerolled PVE a few days ago. it really really made me not want to log into the game. 
---
I originally played on Mannoroth, the biggest PVP server in NA vanilla, first PVP server to open the gates. it was nothing like this.
---
Okay so I’m a horde rogue. I started doing some AV today and after like five games I’m bored out of my mind running with the zerg. I don’t know enough about AV to figure out what I can be doing instead.
---
Is there some sort of back capping objectives or assassinating single targets in key areas where I’ll be able to contribute without running with the mass of people?
---
Yep it's not based on skill but based on time played
---
so what you're saying is...
---
i can actually, like, continue leveling my character instead of standing in place for 10 mins every 30 seconds to tap mobs?
---
how are you in full epics and very competitve. i call bs a lot of bis are blues
---
Honestly, I'd wager it has more to do with people wanting to do good in a video game because they believe they didn't do good in life.
---
You can kill some lieutenants while they zerg so the group gets more honour.
---
But that sounds like... having fun! Nooo way.
---
What was he doing in AV anyway? Multiboxers are useless af without /follow, you should report them on sight as they'll drag your team down harder than that lvl 54 farming harpies.
---
I wanna kill some skeletons n shit
---
Don julios is available. Don rodrigos is not until phase 5
---
And every race class combo you see is the same in pvp, every ally priest is a dwarf and mage a gnome... these people are so boring and unoriginal it’s scary.
---
What's great is when all the whiners leave and all the actual PVPers are left and you just grind out the win.
---
Good call, I’ll try that. Thanks
---
Mining+herb, easy loops through high level zones, easy access to nodes with cc and stealth, i burned tonns of money on ah before getting my mount thanks to gathering. Switching to different spotting buff is not that annoying once you memorise the general spawns, especially for rich thoriums

There's like five different posts about this on the front page, we get it.

They yall need to stop cutting our 60% mounts so we can get it over with!
---
In your eorld it is a must. The rest of it is fine with out own pace and way of playing the game. I feel bad for you. Must be hard to stay competitive in an imaginary world. And you even pay for the stress you put yourself in!
---
It hurts, but I’m very close
---
I don't have proof it was intentional however each Warmaster/Marshall is supposed to have a buff:
---
&gt;Effect #1 Is an Aura that increases damage for Drek and the other Warmasters by 40%.
---
&gt;Effect #2 Is also an aura that increases maximum health of Drek and the other Warmasters by 30% .
---
&gt;Effect #3 Is an affect that decreases the target's dodge by 10%.
---
The aura used to be visible and it had a tooltip. This was the already nerfed version of the aura where the original one was a 70% damage bonus. 
---
With this buff it would almost impossible to fight multiple Warmaster/Marshalls. You would have have to burn the towers which is the intended way the BG was supposed to be played.
---
No, blame cocksuckers for being cocksuckers.

There is a reason you see whining and bitching everywhere. Ever consider this?

Alliance going for honor in AV is silly though.

Yeah sure am hour long aoe grind that does not give anything if you lose

It's the same drop rate as any world-drop epic.

It's sad coz they really have become extremely entitled.

The problem is that game devs aren't professionals in making a game as fun as it can possibly be. They are professionals in wringing as much money out of the playerbase as they can. I'm sure they are good at that job, but that's not what I want from a game dev. When I say I don't trust them, I mean I don't trust them to act in my best interests. And of course they don't, I'm not their boss.
---
are bindings soulbound and given to one person?
---
Kind of agree this is what comes out of everything becoming over corporatized.
---
are the bindings the same? doesnt matter where we get them right?
---
i thought that's what we were supposed to do while pooping? catch up on reddit, swipe some tinder thots and then get on with life.
---
I think this is the general mindset irl too. You have to be competitive to get your slice of the pizza.
---
Rank=time invested not skill pretty much
---
Amazingly I pointed this out weeks ago that the community at large are becoming worse than retail players after saying they want classic to escape retail and retail mentality. Go figure I was downvoted into oblivion ..now I just sit back and shrug knowing how right I was. Smh.
---
As it turns out, the honor system is actually dog shit for real pvp , but nochanges guys
---
They're still in the game, however, polluting whatever else they get away with.
---
You should run stamina and spell power. I've never been able to "spam" SB tbh. At least in small group. In AV you can go over geared as it's mostly over anyway.
---
The problem is that you are effectively penalized for attempting to win battlegrounds because Blizzard implemented wrong iteration of Alterac Valley, so if you aren't spam queuing lieutenant/Balinda/commander runs, you're falling further and further behind on the honor system and may never achieve rank 13-14. 
---
If you choose to defend AV, you end up stalling out the game and gaining maybe an extra thousand honor, whereas you could have lost perhaps 2-4 games in the same time and gotten 3-4k honor for each of those games.
---
If you choose to play WSG, you sit in a queue for 10-15 mins and you could have won an AV during that queue time and probably finished another in the time span of actually playing the WSG game.
---
I’m level 51 Druid with no Mount (choice, going straight for that 100% when I hit 60) and not one person has said anything to me or booted me. I’ve been in about 20 AV’s today.
---
Paladin, that’s why there can only be 1
---
Because it's a better game in this iteration.  It's fun.  Have fun playing it, man.
---
Paladins can tank end game dungeons using a holy spec with the righteous fury talents and decent gear.
---
It's certainly not ideal but it's not particularly hard to do.
---
1.  People didn't want a huge war.  They wanted fast shiny loot.  That's why OldAV was nerfed five times.
---
After doing the AV grind 6 times already (on private servers) I don't really enjoy that game anymore. It's a grind and I try do it as fast as possible. Although I don't rage, I just leave early if I see that game might last long
---
He's saying that if you spend time killing all the NPCs leading to you losing (because the other side rushed the boss) you get more honor. However if you rush for the last boss and get the win you get more reputation. 
---
From my experience today you get about 3-400 reputation from a lost game, maybe up to 600 if you get time to complete a lot of objectives. While you get 5-800 from a win, with one game even giving over 1k rep.
---
The sad thing is Skeram never even lost anything close to half of its alliance population.  That was just reddit crying and over dramatizing the issue.  Then, because of the over dramatizing, people got scared and more xferd because reddit told them the server was dying.  The end result?  About 70:30 ratio, but like 90% of alliance players are all extremely experienced tryhards who regularly farm the horde.  The other 10% of Alliance remaining on Skeram are the ones you see still complaining here because they aren't as experienced or willing to put in as much effort and are getting destroyed.

Hi, I'm looking for an addon that includes inputs and what's happening in the middle of your screen i.e (&lt;Leaving Combat&gt;) and shows -"x" amount of damage taken, would greatly appreciate if somebody can name it.

To out it in perspective though, that's a pretty healthy amount of time to spend on something that you genuinely enjoy.

Last Tuesday I raided MC in a PUG.  On Wednesday morning I was asked to join a raiding guild and be part of their group.  They also raid this week.  Will I be able to join my new guild's raiding group this week, or will I need to wait until next week after it resets?
---
We did the same, but we still lost because people have a phobia of closing out the game. The boss was sitting in alli base for like 10 minutes and noone wanted to kill vann
---
What guild were they from?
---
You're scum.
---
Personally, I miss the game.  I was an adult when it came out, and I don't conflate it with being anything other than it was: a really, really good game that I loved to play and didn't at all like what it became.

eh... thats more like people who'd been killing rag on a private server for ten years and have absolutely no issues doing so.

Not sure I joined after they left it was alliance tho

Yea good call :P
---
It looks that way if you just take cursory glances but it isn't really that way, at least in me experience. People buy the mats up to a certain price point and other people undercut the finished product down to a certain point also. Usually on my server I'll see the same thing with prices being close or even the mats being higher during 'peak hours' but anywhere outside of that like 6-8hr window it goes back to normal.

I didnt say it was right, I'm level 60 almost full bis and on board with the zerg strat and I still get kicked. I don't particularity like the system I was simply trying to inform you that it has nothing to do with them liking you and everything to do with them farming honor/rep. If they were able to wue as a premade this would be a non issue.

So what happens in raid when you type “/tar rag”?Does it target you or the boss? And how does it decide!?
---
Both know the same amount about politics also

They’re kink shaming, the pig
---
serious question, if a botter is banned because they were reported how would they ever know what part of their software was 'compromised'? i'd of thought that no matter how good your bot is, if you are literally online in the same spot 24/7 its obvious you're botting/acc sharing

i have been PVE only and I have a guild who is full of player who get on just about every day and we have 2 lvl 60 players of our 200-300 members.

Holy shit babies born in 2000 are already 19 years old!
---
The good thing is, if you report someone, your name will be put in the log entry for the kick on the server so if blizzard wants to they can put some scripts together to just get the names of the people who reported for AFK more than 5 times up until now and ban them pretty easy.

But we are all knowing blizz, they will leave it as it is for a good week or two, they will put up a bluepost "we have received community feedback about the report system and we will closely observe if there is any abuse going on" and MAYBE... MAYBE they get a 72hour ban and thats it or blizzard just says "baaaaad doggy, bad bad bad doggy, dont do it again" and thats it like they did with all exploits who got abused like crazy like instant dungeon boss respawns with layering for example.
---
I dont have faith anymore in blizz to really punish people if they behave bad.
---
There was a thread about a fAMoUS StREaMer that got caught doing this and it was deleted by the mods. He deleted the VODs and all that good stuff too. Luckily the guy this happened to was able to get a mirror clip before that though.
---
premades are getting 3k honor in 6 min, pugs get 1k in 20
---
This is actually funny in a neat way lol. Cool to realize there are people playing who don't know anything and are discovering it.
---
Because this community tried to swear a 2005 game in 2019 was perfect lol
---
There's too much to research lol. I wouldn't have known about this unless my friend who introduction me to wow through classic explicitly told me this. I've watched videos and tried to do lots of research but it's boring af. Would much rather learn by playing the game you know the fun way
---
Banning all addons, maybe on server to server basis, would go a long way.y
---
Nah. Drek rush is easy to counter and horde is already doing it. You're just gonna have to fight.
---
To add, I think it's clear that people with shitty attitudes inherit a biased which results in more vocal behavior.  This whole social experiment that is wow classic has shown me that a lot of 30ish year olds never grew up, and their identity revolves around their "gaming success".  So much insecurity explains much of this Reddit imo.  God damn, so many wow classic elements are being overshadowed by shitty people, with shitty behavior, who are throwing shit.  Just chill guys.
---
yes you can, been doing it all day
---
I will see you in the other side then! I'm horde on razorgore.
---
Classic+ is obviously a completely different game than retail.
---
Recommend waiting until the last possible second to accept the queue. This might help limit the time they have to vote you out before its too late, and you're engaged in PvP.
---
Pugs can get that too. We did it in vanilla rather easily. Doesn’t take a amazing organization.
---
They are cross faction. I'm not sure if you're trying to say that they're not because your phrasing isn't clear. But they are cross faction.
---
have you seen the state of classic wow pugs
---
you didnt play premades? lul
---
Same thing. Your changing the game.
---
Nice.
---
It's your own fault for using Need Before Greed.
---
Pro tip: a mage or warlock can Aoe the skeletts. They need to stay where the questgiver is. They need to stay still and just cast blizzard at your location. Ultra easy mode.
---
Thank you. I seriously don't get what people are so worked up over. It's been a great game socially and gameplay wise. Granted this is my first World of Warcraft experience, I've been having a great time and the people in the servers I play on are generally kind, funny, and collaborative.
---
Literally because you can, in my experience anyway
---
Gold
---
Nice
---
Yeah I've come to agreement that the end game will never be like the same as old days and stopped subbing as of now. People just consume content atm, destroying even servers on the way.
---
It's funny how people turn on the game and seem to completely forget that greedy people are a thing.
---
No not really, warlocks are a counter, good mages one of the hardest matchups, SPs are always a pain even if shaman kinda counters them on paper. Melees are not really difficult to deal with for a geared shaman with pvp trinket. By equipping Skullflame over Malistar you lose a lot of stamina and armor so I’m really not convinced the proc makes up for that IF it even procs. Again it’s 3% so do you want to count on it and sacrifice armor and stamina? I’m not sure at all, even with AQ level of spellpower and even if lifestealing procs scale as well as we think. Maybe it’ll be great combined with Hakkari Manslayer. Maybe Neretzek will be great. But I’m not convinced really. If it can proc on spell, then it’s potentially not bad against warlocks. Against melee though you’re sacrificing stamina and armor for a 3% chance proc that won’t even give you that much health? Even if the heal scales 100% of +healing, is it going to make a difference against AQ geared warrior/rogue? Like, I WANT to buy this shield but I’m really skeptical
---
"Fuck everyone else, I'll make it take even longer than 1k in 20 min so that I can steal your time and get more for myself."
---
That's you.
---
This is an issue that largely applies to gamers in general nowadays. People tried saying it's Blizzard's fault for Retail being "not fun" also when, in reality, it's the player that decided to not enjoy the game anymore and just want to get to "the end." It's why people like me can play and enjoy both, but sometimes I feel like if I express that everyone hates me. Classic players think I'm a Retail fanboy and Retail players think I'm a Classic fanboy. Maybe, I don't know, I can just enjoy the game? Crazy, right?
---
Its on the vendor. We can see it. Why wouldnt it be?
---
I think that is a bigger issue that is impossible to change. Some streamers have put out these shows of how THEY play which in some cases is toxic and counter the real fun of classic. BUT they are getting views for it, they are having fun BY being griefing and it is bad for those who are learning from theses people.
---
Chill, son. Try nofap.
---
If you get too many at once it doesn't even count down, it just auto boots you
---
Let's not be dramatic, you're not being screwed. I won a grand total of 3 games today and still got honoured, rep flows in at a very steady rate whether you win or lose, you'll be exalted in a few days.
---
Remember, almost all weapons are hunter weapons, especially those with agility.
---
That's a pretty good weapon for a hunter at that level too.
---
No he used the report way. Watch video.
---
Bruh I’m playing the game to have fun not chase pixels to make myself feel left empty
---
I'd actually prefer if there was no way to know which match I am playing in. This way, I can't tell my friends, and I am forced to socialize and be nice to whoever I end up in that match with.
---
This meme is an edited version of an edited version where somebody turned the trap into a reference from JoJo's bizarre adventure where there is an electrical socket on a random rock in the desert
---
But thats The classic experiemce - having to figure out everything by yourself
---
Master baiter
---
&gt; the second I hit 60 game got repetitive
---
hate to break it to you but that's how it always works at max level when you've finished the content.  progression guilds end up cancelling subs, logging out and coming back with the next patch.
---
The biggest thing that'll help you level is getting weapon upgrades constantly at least for the mainhand. Bandages also very useful and if you have an abundance of low lvl health potions that helps too!
---
Its so funny how you can tell too, they all have SOMETHING to prove lol
---
Squad Night Gang SHIFT Gang Life
---
Lost 50
---
Nobody is saying you can't try, but if you don't have the time to dedicate to it to that level, which most people don't, it's an unrealistic goal. The mentality that you think they owe it to you to tailor it to the amount of time you can dedicate to it makes me feel sorry for you. They don't need to make it easier or hand it to you on a platter.
---
Fair enough. You probably pay closer attention to the sub than I do. If I'm just seeing the surface, I figure there are others like me (at least 4!) in a similar boat. And honestly it was just exhausting me trudging through it all. I had to get it off my chest.
---
Yup it’s in game, you can buy it from the vendor for 720g saw it with my own eyes earlier today.
---
They never did, but tgey have to be professionals today because the prev generation is what they are up against
---
I only farm them to get those nice throwing knifes
---
Oldest trick in the book, it’s just natural selection if you fall for it! Also opening a portal at the starter cave.
---
The spy addon should legitimately be considered cheating.
---
Oh no I absolutely get it. I had to step back for a few days because of all the negativity was making me not want to play even though I was doing fine. Personally I just can’t wait for all this to go away and post fun stuff
---
Lol nothing but arena can quantify skill.
---
I just wish more people could play the way I do.
---
I have always loved being a raider, killing bosses every week like one of the big boys, being part of a raid team having for for a couple of hours every week, and thats what I do, simple.
---
Theres no min maxing or miserable cries for loot or elitism, I just log on to do raids or maybe a du geoun if someone poked me for it, and thats it. I have never been able to play wow so casually while still keeping up with raids as I do now. Its all classic is to me, casual fun on a regular basis.
---
To hell with all the minmaxing, raidlogs and that kind of bullshit, just play for fun and enjoyment.
---
(We need a couple more people too btw)
---
Nice Day for fishing aint it ? Hu ha!
---
Just stop playing.
---
you can, get in discord and all queue up at the same time, then leave 1 guy in at the end and reque that numbers, then you only gotta kick 1-2 people
---
Nah it's ok, just unsubbed to the game. Maybe Ill jump back in if they change things. Rewards for rep and honor is useless if you can't use the gear for anything. Since there is no PVP there is no reason to grind it out.
---
Yeah - there's no **efficiency** in having fun.. and vice versa .. for me anyway.
---
Honestly, if you are the only rogue in the zone it’s awesome. As soon as there’s 2 or 3 people there you may as well just leave.
---
If you can log in at 6am every morning you can make some good money (depending on RNG for crystals), besides that it’s not very good. 
---
Like anything mining it’s just luck. I went 100 nodes with no crystals, basically made 35 gold for 8 hours work.
---
? queue is instant, you dont get deserter when kicked
---
Lockboxes don't contain epics soo
---
Its easy. You queue at the same time. Wait for pop. If different. The player with the lowest IAMTU has to find the AV of the friend with the higest IAMTU value. Works 100%. IAMTU stands for i am making this up.
---
Good luck!
---
Fuck off, I hope you stub your toe when you wake up tomorrow.
---
&gt; I always roll need because there's always someone in the group nearby that will as well!
---
Tragedy of the commons.
---
This game is 15 years old.
---
If you want new content you have 15 years worth of game to choose from.
---
Leave classic WoW alone.
---
I heard the toxic Yojambros and Arugals have been picking on my fellow Remulosers by doing coordinated afk reporting. Why spoil other people's fun? For some players, WoW time is their precious few moments after work. This is atrocious behaviour.
---
But what is the solution?
---
You were in a game long enough for them to Summon this? I feel bad for you.
---
Hide!!
---
I duelled more warriors than i can count... i pretty much duelled everything.
---
And the fact they dont have deep wounds is already big... all you need is the fluffy to remove rend then you wait for him to get to battle/Defstance you blind and regg completely full to 100%...
---
And you can even do that twice with pvp specc!
---
There is no way you should loose over 30% of your Duels unless youre extremly outskilled or outgeared
---
Did you eat for 15 seconds? 
---
Also: Food that restores both health and mana grants two separate buffs while eating. One for eating, and one for "drinking". Having both of these for 15 sec is required to get well fed.
---
If you drink another drink while eating, it will cancel the "drinking" part of eating f.i. sagefish, and you will not receive the well fed buff.
---
I strolled in the front doors of Orgimmar on Tuesday on my Night Elf Priest, walked to Thrall, smacked him with my staff once, walked back to the front door, got Mind Controlled all the way back to Thrall for a  hour. I was bugged and couldn't die, was at 1 HP, it was a wild time. I streamed it on Twitch, it isn't super exciting to watch, but was fun  to do.
---
Thank you. I'll take a look tomorrow.
---
Eh, I think considering anything less that #1 not worth achieving is a far more pathetic mentality.
---
No, dont tell me have to have fun! Im tired of these oppressive posts.
---
I did too - had a few max level friends who got me into the game, and they ran my first toon through dungeons up through lvl 49 bracket, then gave me gold to buy w/e gear I wanted on the AH. I had a warrior with some awesome gear - some pretty stupid stuff, too, but mostly wrecked everyone back in the day. Was a lot of fun!
---
PvP in classic is going to go down as one of the biggest failures.  World PVP was a huge mess and now bgs.  That's it for pvp in classic time to wait on tbc.
---
Nerd because he finished something as soon as he could so he can do what ever he want now? Green is the color of envy, and you're so green Orcs think you're jesus.
---
You weren’t helping, you deserved to be kicked.
---
Phase 2 is awesome, we knew what it would be like from nostalrius, we have like 95% people having ingi skilled for pvp utility, we pvp in 40 man raid groups, we have scout twinks where we can login to see if opponent faction has a lot of players set up to surprise us...
---
Its awesome, we got destroyed on monday infront of MC and we canceled our raid and instead fought back the enemy with our second and third MC group comming in helping us, we fought them all the way back to kargath where a lot of other hordes helped them so we had an even battle. This was going along for 3-4 hours and it was awesome.
---
Its just annoying if you get 2-3 people in between who wisper you "You killed me twice, thats griefing I report you enjoy your ban", I know the people dont like to hear it but if you roll on pvp servers you should be ready to be killed even if you want a special snowflake safespace and nobody is allowed to interuped your gameplay.
---
I agree if you ignore the shitters who started on a pvp realm despite not liking pvp, the entire phase 2 was great and is just about what we expected from big private servers.
---
Yeah, sometimes I wonder.
---
Like those world bosses in Mop have what feels like a 1 in 2000-5000 chance to drop their mount, with people farming them for years on dozens of characters and never seeing them.
---
legendaries are messed up, our raid grp has 3 warriors with 2 bindings and 3 eyes of sulfuras. They fucked something really bad with legendaries and that 2handers from rag are more rare than fucking hammer.
---
I was named Rupaul for the majority of my wow career, didnt even know who Rupaul was.  it was a randomly generated name.
---
&gt;Take up masturbation and ~~weed~~ meth smoking.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;My two favourite hobby’s.
---
\*\_\*
---
What if you're having fun doing it though
---
That’s not group queuing and it’s not organic. And there’s a fail rate. Look at all the posts on the blizzard forums of people who’ve been trying it for the past two days and not having it work like it should.
---
People need to understand this. The grind for rep is now, as more people hit exalted, que times will climb. Just get this done now
---
What is this about? Captain?
---
The people rushing now are doing that because they don't really like av, but want the rewards or are taking advantage of the higher honor per hour while the games are being rushed. After the first couple of weeks they'll turn back into the drawn out games they were designed for.
---
Around 130 negative. I'm a fucking enhancement shaman how am I going to make that back besides gambling again
---
I’m sure I remember a speech on video game design or a YouTube video and this was a quote from it. Amazingly insightful video about how you can guide players to play certain ways without them knowing but somewhat allow less efficient methods for players who are set on playing different ways.
---
Basically saying player will always run what is most efficient or easiest without thinking about if it is enjoyable, as a result games can fail because of bad design when the game is great but being played wrong. Penalising players who play the game wrong can also cause negative feedback especially when you do it after initial release unless it is punishment for exploits or greifing. The best options were to optimise the game so player can play how they want but it is most efficient to play how the game was designed to be played.
---
I made a quick "thorns" build on my shaman. Didn't work as well as I had hoped but still neat. Have still yet to buy a skull flame to test if it's worth. There is also a trinket in MC that has a thorns effect that I'd like to get my hands on. 
---
Uses [argent defender](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13243/argent-defender) with thorium spikes. Forget the name but the static charge cloth helm thing from last boss in gnomer. Then the dagger from the Godzilla hydra in ZF. (Note this removes that helms buff and replaces it. I have another dagger that does a similar thorns like effect but haven't tested if it removes it. Think it was from a boss in gnomer too.)
---
Then magma and fire nova. I was able to pull about 20ish enemies at once in SFK and AoE them down fairly fast. But totems having agro makes it a little tricky sometimes since mobs will kill them wasting a ton of mana. Have yet to try higher level dungeons.
---
Another note is I was enhance when trying this so mana and lower damage from fire totems was a bit of an issue. Though rock biter solved some of it as long as I hit everything at least 1 or 2 times. Currently ele with a decent set so the added damage might help some. There's some pots that tanks use to help with AoE that might also help speed things up depending on their cost. (Flamebreath something elixir.)
---
Problem is, and what you fail to understand, is that he doesn't care. Not everybody needs to min/max every piece of gear, this man is happy with his spear - let him be happy.
---
what are you TALKING ABOUT?!
---
The only green I’ve even gotten is some level 50 fr ring, myself.
---
I was definitely caught off guard by everyone just rushing the shit out of av to get rep as fast as possible, and outright getting mad/quitting when they are forced to actually play the battleground.
---
It feels a lot like people want AV to be the thing we claim to hate about retail.
---
Wish I could upvote 500 times
---
I don't fall into the category of gamers you describe, but I don't let what others value in a game affect my own enjoyment. Their adventure is not my adventure, it's their own. Who am I to stop them from living their best life?
---
Leaders will inevitably attract followers and they will experience the top content that is afforded them. If that top content or the journey towards it isn't of interest to you, what does it matter to the game itself?
---
That's win trading. Nothing to do with xfaction. Check what I wrote. 
---
Mental exercise: win trading with people from your own faction when arenas break is bannable.
---
Xfaction collusion in all areas is tolerated. The overlap right now is because honor is tied to xfaction.
---
I'v been having a blast playing the game, even though it's so damn mechanically easy compared to retail (the only reason I dislike Classic). But this is because I love the slowed down combat, how chill leveling is, and how exciting it is getting good loot. As for the community of Classic vs Retail, most everyone I've met in Classic has been super nice (minus a few bad apples, but that is to be expected), but this is no different from my retail experience. In retail I've also made wonderful friends and had a lot of fun progression raiding with them. There are awesome communities in both games imo, you just gotta find them. You also gotta have the right mentality when making friends in the game, I mean its an MMO for goodness sake, not a single player game!
---
They existed in Vanilla.
---
But then ure less ppl at Drek and miss the 5 min victory rep
---
Private servers were the same level of toxicity, and no one streamed there.
---
That's the win trading rule in effect. Not xfaction collusion.
---
Well actually honor system did kinds forco you to kill enemy faction on sight, but yeah good point
---
Exactly. Love this game and the only real problem I have is that I still can‘t decide what to play. Tbc would be nice 2. still my favourite time in wow
---
Whenever anything is mildly an issue ingame I think and say to my guild “well, bet reddit is bitching”.
---
Zoomers and spoiled retail players
---
You assume everyone is ally
---
Pretty sure mobs stop giving rep once you’re revered though
---
This game is supposed to be fun?
---
You're not having fun *our* way.
---
That's okay, our enforcers will be around to break your kneecaps and give you the proper enchants momentarily.
---
^This is how AV is done!
---
Except people are just rushing to get it over with, they aren't doing it for fun.  
---
There's nothing oppressive about this lmao
---
I doubt he doesnt care, dude just made an informed decision. No reason to make the game harder on yourself, which is what he did. Its not even min/maxing lmao, nice strawman though. Would you be saying the same to a warrior wearing nothing but spirit gear? No. Youd be like "bro.. spirit sucks for warrior", not defending his informed gear decision. Foh.
---
I believe you, just against my perception so far but no reason to think what I've seen is right
---
This has happened to me two times now.
---
I dont want to be #1, i want to hang with 20-30 other people that all have the same goal of clearing mythic raid content.
---
Acting like that doesnt require you to be in top of every progression system ist just stupid. Not caring for those is like a big fuck you to the ambitions of the others
---
Who is you guys
---
This is already happening. Our premade was paired with a Russian premade last night. They started reporting us and we ofcourse answered in kind.
---
Because I want my Don Julios
---
Maybe u already had a stronger buff that doenst stack? Like u cant replace the spiritbuff from ADrep foos with manaregenbuff fish either
---
I've been complaining for weeks.  I knew the open world would becomes ghost town and players would just sit in cities and queue for BGs between raid nights.  It's boring.
---
Holy shit, "nice strawman" fuck me man it's not a serious debate. Stop taking life so God damn serious for once.
---
The guy is informed, he literally states he needs a +hit bow so he knows a few things already.
---
&gt; You aren't going to get rank 14, and you are ruining the game for people who don't want to min max.
---
Are you talking about ganking on pvp realm? If someone is not hardcore he or she should not roll on pvp realm. I am not hardcore and I am having fun on Normal realm. Normal is the normal. If someone wants more hardcore experience than normal then play on pvp.
---
Haven't had one quite this long, but there have been some great games in the 29 bracket in my region.
---
battLEGrOUnDs WOnt RuiN WoRld pVP
---
Are you suggesting it's completely coincidental then that most of the well-known Classic streamers also played on private servers? Are you seeing a theme, yet? I mean, hello? You do see the correlation, correct? 
---
You inadvertently helped make my point.
---
They should drop new lore new expansions
---
This assumes you actually manage to complete the objectives before alliance wins. 
---
Also, I might be missing something here, but isn't Horde massively favored in a race situation ? I get that the map favors Alliance in a normal fight, but with the placement of starting locations Horde should be able to win every time if they actually race. I even seem to remember people suggesting to move the Horde start location just because of how favorable it is.
---
Dude in my guild got 220k yesterday...so...
---
Ah you think you do but you don’t.
---
Exactly, people are irrational about hit. It’s good, but so is SP. So calculate your hit to SP conversion and you can make an informed decision.
---
Praise the Poop!
---
&gt; blame blizz for our actions
---
Seriously. I just started playing wow for the first time in September and just got lvl 50. I have no clue what 95% of posts are complaining about. But I kinda just do my own thing solo most of the time
---
Neutral AH, accesable for both Ally and Hord, are seperate from faction AHs u see in major cities. You find neutral AHs in bootybay and tanaris
---
But thats stupid, if people we're just about optimizing they would do what you said. The reason they dont is that "normal" mythic progression is already their way of fun &gt; optimization at all cost
---
It’s unfortunate but meta shit is starting to ruin online gaming with any class or rpg based games. It’s part of the reason I think games like escape from tarkov are getting so popular these days. Permadeath and economy based items and gear make an established meta impossible. Yeah you have gear that’s super good but it’s not 100% certain you won’t get domed by a dude with his grandpas hunting rifle. Same goes for OSRS, though min/maxing is still a cancer in that game.
---
The funny thing Is most players dont even need the money from that item as they already have epic mounts. I'm still struggling on my 60% mount and my 250gold
---
Yup, we were talking about this in guild chat today. Apparently I'm wrong because I actually like the AV meta and how it rewards extreme efficiency... Why is it always that they people that want everyone to JUST HAVE FUN!! that are the most vocal and can't consider anyone elses way of having fun?
---
So twinking premades just want to shit on inexperienced and undergeared players and don't want to fight each other?
---
I remember when people were upset about MoP being about Pandaren thinking Blizz was copying Kung Fu Panda.
---
Then blizzard should make a 50-59 and a 60 only BG until then , he shouldn’t be kicked for joining
---
Ya I’m speaking straigit up relatively. I grinded to rank 13 in vanilla and it’s easily the most shameless useless shit I’ve ever done with my life. Thankfully I was only a high school student so I didn’t haven’t to sacrifice a lot. But my grades were shit for like 4 months and I skipped a ton of school.
---
Mannoroth horde side? Any chance you remember a troll rogue named murtagh?
---
Tbc is a much better game than vanilla, but it also lost some of the charm on the way. 
---
Honestly, TBC class balance and itemisation (no pvp resilience gear) in classic would have been the absolute top thing for me. Next point would be to release places like Hyjal and scale then back to level 60 with small tweaks to make them suit classic.
---
Play another game? We have a good 1+years before nax even comes out.  WoW doesnt need new content because it's made its money. Played on private servers for years and year later still wasn't bored. 
---
If you want more content, retails there.
---
Lol no they won't
---
You ain't looting shit anyways
---
I used to do this in burning crusades. Now I wouldn't do it all the time because i'm not a jerk. But if I joined an av and within 5 seconds someone is already screaming obsenities like "why won't one of these fucking idiot(harsher word) mages give us a mana table?"
---
I would just casually stroll up beside that person and drop a portal to stonard. They'd often get got.
---
I'd then summon a mana table for the normal people remaining.
---
Thanks, tips.
---
&gt; most shameless useless shit I've ever done with my life
---
Hey man, at least you learnt life lessons with what's important and what's useless! Not all bad!
---
That's cool, I and most people would never judge you for any of that.
---
But be honest.  When you're in a pug group for pvp or pve and they don't meet your standards of optimization do you lose your mind and explode on them?  Are you mean and condescending or helpful and nice?
---
There's a reason people don't like min/maxers and it's not because they have fun incorrectly.
---
You can model edit, i've seen some clips on here of people that are using things like AQ mounts and ZG mounts, but it's worth noting that only like ~6months ago they put out a huge banwave in retail for model editing that gave people upto 6month suspensions.
---
I feel like the Zerg or get out people are the same people who were, all PvP hApPeNeD oN a PvP SeRver crowd who justified FP and Low level camping
---
A he'll of a lot of multiboxers clone inputs to all COPIES of wow, including movement, it isn't just following a lot of the time, occasionally they move as one, there's a druid on my server that boxes 5 feral cats, if he ravages anyone it's instant death
---
I haven't rolled my eyes this much since my last demonic possession.
---
Phase 2 on Thunderfury has been mostly a blast
---
And I turned it in outside the cave in Alterac so it is available in both places
---
No, because you have to play to understand what you're doing wrong. They might not understand strategy X is bad, but they will after failing at it. 
---
You already know what the wrong thing is, and you're choosing to do it anyway.
---
Better grind the exalted rep fast before this shit takes over
---
&gt;I feel like the minmax mentality is a result of eSports culture.
---
I don't think that's true at all. 
---
The E-Sports players I know (long time Wc3 and SC2 player) generally frown upon the scummy tactics employed here. There's nobody who plays SC2 on a Master level who would think it's acceptable to get ahead by booting people out of BGs, engage in 20vs1 combat, have an overwhelming gear advantage that completely takes skill out of the equation etc.
---
It was possible in vanilla, but regarded as an asshole thing to do.
---
Lmao look at this kid larping
---
It's 2019 you aren't allowed to have fun.
---
Naw dude this has been the case since waayyyy before e-sports etc. Even in D&amp;D groups people would do this shit, and in spreadsheet games back on usenet.
---
What cornpips said. It doesn't require riding skill so anyone can use it.
---
Blizzard should do nothing untill next reset.. then ban for 7 days to decay 1 week of honor sounds fair
---
For horde: cap snowfall GY and the two bunkers near stonehearth GY, but leave stonehearth alone unless a group is successfully turtling alliance. After killing Belinda, this is the best way to maximize honor. In addition, cap BOTH mines. You get additional rep per line, and they cap instantly for gain on end of BG. Unlike the graveyards and bunkers, which you must own (not contest) at the end for honor and rep. 
---
If you're going to lose to Zerg, take everything you can get.
---
As a Horde player currently leveling, getting into WPL was pretty much 15 minutes of running to your body after 6 deaths before you maybe left alone for another 10 before a random squad of Rogues decides to camp you again.
---
i didn't end up getting picked up by the guild my IRL friend had me apply to. I really didn't know how to play the game at all so i stopped playing until TBC after AQ released. The big names were 12 Prophets and Denizen.  I don't remember much else other than having a much different experience.  Some times getting jumped by an ally warrior with Ashkandi to fight over a thorium node but that was about it.  I think everyone was in Silithus so i didn't get the brunt of it!
---
Why do you think ppl that zerg AV dont have fun?
---
how is blizzards broken system our fault
---
Happens in AQ I believe.
---
I play on a PvP realm and there were indeed a lot of cleave groups early on. Still managed do find regular groups just fine tough.
---
i agree, why would I wanna be with pugs getting 1k
---
Thanks for all the advice!
---
What's wrong with Belfs?
---
I thought BC was fantastic, but the only things I disliked about it were:
---
- **Moving to Outland:** started the trend of killing the need to be in Azeroth. It felt less like a living, breathing world where we used to be able to always find players in different zones getting up to something.
---
- **Flying mounts**: Not much needs to be said here. Although convenient and cool, created some major gameplay issues.
---
-**Shattrath**: I wasn't a fan of the central hub for both horde and alliance players.
---
This might be controversial but I think the people that "just want everyone to have fun!!!" while doing all the 60 content are the people looking at the game through rose tinted glasses, this was ALWAYS the endgame community. Just because information to optimize is readily available for everyone now and you can actually experience more endgame than UBRS this time around doesn't make us wrong for enjoying the game our way.
---
People act like we didn't min-max back, YOU didn't.
---
Unless they're a balance druid
---
Just wait til the BG Raid Leader sets the loot system to master looter. That's a fun one.
---
If you put on master loot people will report you afk and you will get kicked.
---
It's always been about the destination. I've quit WoW a few times because of it. I just wanted to play with friends but I'd get to 25 and they'd be 60. Just not worth the effort to try to catch up. Their goals are different to mine.
---
MMORPGs as they are now are an old concept. Next wave of interest will be a VRMMORPG. Until then I'll occasionally play other genres
---
The youth thinks I'm one them. Exellent.
---
It's a symbiotic relationship. It generates the most honor per game.
---
Remember, you're not competing against the opposing faction, you're competing against the same faction on the ladder.
---
I really dont get what people are thinking. Back in Vanilla I was an 13 year old asshole who flamed everything outside of my guild and friends. And guess what? Most people are still like that, its the internet.
---
Either they dont talk with anybody outside their friends and guild or they are assholes. Off course there are some out there that are always friendly, but thats a minority. I am not sure what experiences all you guys made IRL but 90% of the people are assholes, online its like 99%.
---
you are all just blinded by your memories, I also had another feeling when I was 13. I was hyped all day to get out of school to finally play, you know what I did? Duels and Warsong all day. But that was another time, I havent had this hype feeling for a game in years, I am hyped for some new games or releases, yes - but different level.
---
I think the people have to wake up, we are not 13 anymore, we are 27 year old nerds with a job and maybe a family that play a 15 year old game.
---
Yea if they were to nerf it (which they likely won't) doing it on reset day would be the best option, as it doesn't interfere with the previous week
---
Dang that's a rare sight
---
Probably would... I probably would :3
---
A fresh 60 vs a T1 60 is straight up absurd as well, what’s your point?
---
I also task organize my officers into specific roles or focuses to better assist with talent management. Skills I've learned over a very long and expansive career. 
---
It still boils down to a lot of management. Even if it's at the officer level; they are going to filter the issues brought up.
---
It's just social dynamics. This many people in what is essentially a zero accountability scenario (in the grand scheme of things, not -50dkp) can be tedious.
---
No inn there
---
Just make sure you yell "REEEEEEEEEEEE" while you do it.
---
&gt; We had Locks and Rogues tank Onyxia too.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; As long they act quickly and turn her face on tankposition before the next breath, its fine.
---
&gt; They mostly die on the breath, too huge single hit of dmg. I recommend priest shielded before and precast heal the breath.
---
Not surprised, I've seen lock and rogues tank AQ bosses.
---
yes especialy early on hit has very low value with low spellpower
---
Had this happen today, leader got kicked the minute the gate opened.
---
Welcome to classic wow.
---
Sorry kid, I'm not a masochist. Why would I want to waste more time than necessary in that shitty bg?
---
It's a trap!
---
Number of kills has nothing to do with the true drop rate.
---
I talked all my friends out of the PvP servers, they are so happy now. It was great fun doing Arithi Basin PvP marked but still able to keep your buffs to raid.
---
Yeah, I didn't understand why people compared Sword &amp; Shield to Fallout 76 out of all games. While Sword/Shield is light on content (Dexit included), at there are times where the lack of QC shows, the game is functionable for the most part. Compare that to Fallout 76, which was legitimately broken in so many areas.
---
I never watch Asmongold and I dont particuarly like him no. Never donated to any streamer.
---
Simple fix: Make it impossible to right-click-report during the first 5-10min of an AV. Most premades will Win in less than 10min anyways.
---
Lighting shield and earth shock are not efficient use only lightning bolt
---

Atiesh- Horde, bought 2 for 450 each this week
---
they gave us a speed run version, and no wonder people ran out of things to do
---
I haven’t stopped having fun because I knew from the get-go I wasn’t going to do any of this min-maxing optimization bullshit. I knew it’d ruin the game for many people.
---
Don't say shit like "guess i got lucky".
---
If you want to play suboptimally that's totally fine, no one is stopping you, but don't pretend like what your'e doing isn't suboptimal or try to defend it with some dumb shit like "i guess i got lucky".
---
i suggest you to abandon princess farm and go dm east grind. easily doable with 350ish shadow power. takes a bit time to perfect it but worth a lot.
---
Wow. What a fucking baby. I thought we hated blizzard a month ago. That didnt take long to be forgotten.
---
This
---
This is such a grumpy old man post.
---
I work in construction and I’m self employed, the trick is to book enough work in so that I can still earn enough for the day but get to finish around lunch time. 
---
Early mornings and early nights works for me :)
---
Cause it's not a neutral town and it's right near the most used entrance to Searing Gorge(alliance cant really open that gate in Loch Modan their first time through) that's also a crazy bottleneck.  Even in the event that TP was overrun with Alliance you could gather at Kargath and roam in very quickly
---
&gt; Thé hemo debuff definitely ain’t worth it
---
No but the Imp.Expose armor is worth it.
---
how the hell do you make that leap? can people not take responsibility of their actions for once? "Blame streamers, blame e-sports, blame whoever the fuck". 
---
No, its you and you alone who plays the damned game for you. Blaming streamers for having an effect on how you choose to consume content is akin to admitting violent games cause school shootings.
---
The system scales for the high ranks so it wont change anything. When **EVERYONE** is getting high amounts of honor, it just drags out the brackets, doesnt it?
---
Has it occured to you that maybe thats how some people get their enjoyment? Hell, Diablo for example is a game ABOUT min/maxing and people love it. 
---
Doing something for fun is fun once, but then it fades, grinding for that BIS gear is fun much longer and rewards you with more fun later when you destroy in pvp.
---
But if everyone is getting the ring then it doesn't really matter in the end? Competition then also has more DKP to spend.
---
Trashs, geddon in garr room etc.
---
Mind sharing your Elvui profile it’s clean as hell
---
maybe it was right after the gates opened? i am not really sure.
---
But i got the "no rep debuff" way before it would be possible to even see a single enemy
---
And i did not get baited. just ran up to the gate
---
Can't they shift out of roots?
---
Also they're immune to polymorph and tanky while in bear form. Sounds pretty good
---
The difference is, you only do the 6 min run where nothing happens until you can get your gear and then fuck off to an actually fun BG, like WSG or AB. AV is just inherently stupid, it involves PvE no matter what you do so it'll always boil down to some form of avoiding PvP as much as possible.
---
At least it's faster for Alliance than Horde. Get me outta heeeereeeee
---
&gt; blizztard
---
there you have it.. :D
---
I definitely wouldn’t call playing a warlock hard mode for either faction lmfao.
---
Yea plays have some buffs that work better for locks than shamans. But shamans are fucking STUPID overpowered for healing melee classes so it’s a matter of give and take. 
---
Warlocks were broken af in classic and they are broken af today (no changes remember)
---
Warlocks = most op pvp class
---
Godsend for my prot warrior too.
---
Less toxic by the looks of things :P
---
NO IF YOU DONT WANT HOUR LONG AV MATCHES SINCE I AM STUCK IN THE PAST ANS WANT TO FEEL NOSTALGIA YOU AREN'T HAVING FUN
---
If you don't know what to play, the answer is Druid.
---
You start with a priest. Then you get to be a warrior. Then you get to be a rogue. And eventually you can be a mage.
---
Sure, you are an easier (and slightly worse) version of all of these, but when you get bored you can be another one of these for a bit.
---
You can’t do AV at 33. It’s 51-60
---
WSG won’t give you any exp. either go questing or spam run SM
---
You also have to realize that almost every single game coming out these days is a "LiVe SeRvIcE", coming out as an unfinished product and promising consumers years of support, and when such games release in an unfinished and broken state that sometimes doesn't get fixed for months or years even (i.e. Apex Legends/Fallout 76/Anthem/etc etc.) where devs have 0 communication and patches come out rarely and don't fix things that need to be fixed people will rightfully so grow bitter. Before, nobody expected you to keep investing in a game today thats what its all about. Check out normal game subreddits where companies don't promise a game that will keep getting updated years to come and doesn't come out broken and buggy and I guarantee you almost no one is "bitching". Criticism is the only thing that keeps companies that are complacent not to stagnate.
---
I think the OCD has been there a long time. Goodness knows people were seriously trying to "git gud" just to do a heroic in burning crusade. Tanks needed a threshold or they would be creamed to death instantly. Healers needed a throughput and mana management, and dps needed to bring their CC's or stay home.
---
I think the mentality completely exploded when the groupfinder came out. People looking for a quick run were paired with people there for the lolz. That mix makes the "quick run" people want to exit and avoid a wipefest. They gravitated towards guild runs, or shouting at other people to do better.
---
Eventually this spiraled into a "gearscore" where people would quickly be judged and kicked if they didn't have the firepower to carry their weight.
---
I *kind* of understand it. But good grief do I despise it.
---
Frankly though, the monkey is out of the box here. The "true" classic experience may never return. Unless you find yourselves a guild or server where you heavily frown upon the elitist practices together.
---
me: I wonder if it will be fun AV (pre 1.12) and shitty rewards (no caster ring) or shitty AV (1.12) with good rewards
---
Blizztard: Shitty AV with shitty rewards
---
:D
---
&gt; We had a shaman ot in our guild in vanilla. He managed to make it up to zg before he got edged out.
---
If you're curious the max possible for a shaman tank on private servers is Naxx. Also have to remember that pservers were much harder than ClassicWoW...
---
That IS what its about. When you are new that is EXACTLY what this is about. But you have to understand some people played thousands and thousands of hours of WoW so that magic faded for them. Its now just math and stats and they like it that way.
---
So just to get this right, dropping Aggro is intended behaviour or transferring Aggro is, and it’s back to transferring now? Can’t check am on work
---
Could you Elaborate on that?
---
I don't see why it is more dog shit for real pvp (BG's I supposed you mean) than for open world pvp.
---
It has the same dog shittiness all around
---
There are still larger communities who love their games and devs, like r/pathofexile and r/warframe
---
Lmao
---
it works and is a 1try mounted up most of the time.
---
Join the Crusader Kings subreddit. It's all memes and praising the devs
---
It's decent on shaman tanks but not warrior tanks.
---
and other things that werent added until later patches
---
Caster ring was added in 1.09
---
Rank14 spellblade was added in 1.11
---
guess which one is available now... :D lmao
---
Dropping aggro is the intended behaviour.
---
Yuppp it was nostalgic at first, right about upto finishing Tanaris then became a hellish flogging.
---
I cancelled my subscription yesterday and bought a PS4 to play Kingdom Hearts 3.
---
Lol
---
I'm not entirely sure but I think you bet an amount of gold, roll 
---
like 1-1000, then the other person rolls the number you got, then you roll the number he got until someone gets 1 in which case they lose and pay up
---
Let's say you've got 10% spell critical. Improved Shadow Bolt will increase your damage by an average of 6.88% (assuming you're the one consuming those buffs). This will rise to 7.45% with +1% spell critical.
---
This makes spell critical about a 1.5% increase in dps.
---
Shadow Bolt deals 481 damage. To get a 1.5% increase in dps via spellpower, you'd +5.89 Spellpower.
---
However, the itemization budget for critical is 14 while the itemization budget for spellpower is 0.86. The itemization budget for Shadow damage is 0.7.
---
What this means in practice is that you're starting from the baseline stats, spellpower is much better than spell critical. If you're using a reasonable weighting of 6 spellpower = 1% spell critical, then you're almost always going to selecting spellpower gear.
---
As you pile on more spellpower, spell critical starts to look better. In practice, you won't see a point where spell critical is something you should actively seek until AQ40/Naxx.
---
Due to Improved Shadow Bolt, Spell Critical and Spell Hit are approximately equal until you hit the hit cap.
---
However, this isn't the whole story. While we can model Improved Shadow Bolt as a straight increase to dps, it doesn't actually increase *your* dps.
---
Let's say you're one of 5 Warlocks/Shadow Priests in the raid. You get a critical. There's now a debuff on the target that increases Shadow Damage by 20%. Now, given that you just finished casting a spell, who do you think is most likely to consume the 4 charges on that debuff? Hint: It's not you.
---
So let's fast forwad to AQ40/Naxx where spell critical becomes a more reasonable choice for Warlocks. What you'll observe is that the Warlock who 'wins' the meters is the one who does less damage on a target dummy but more damage in raids because they're feeding off of other Warlocks' Improved Shadow Bolt.
---
Thanks :)
---
Confirmed. Got two tonight on about 6 casts before enemy spotted me and murdered me.
---
I’ve been trying to tell people farming honor is fruitless now unless they’re already rank 8 or 9. Nobody seems to grasp it. 
---
To defend the zergers I think it’s the design of AV that’s the problem: Alliance have far less adds to contend with in the Horde base and thus aren’t slowed down to the extent the horde are.
---
Hmm i dont know. Maybe something that casts drain soul on a target below 5% HP when the amount of soul shards in your bag is lower than X?
---
Ironically enough, you cant attain Rank14 if you **do** attend school, or work, or any activity what so ever that isnt wow:D
---
So there was this thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e9aul0/alterac_valley_afk_system_abuse/
---
TL;DR: People from the same server kick people from AV by voting them AFK, to fill up the BG with people from their server.
---
I skimmed through the thread, and couln't find a explanation to why they would do that. 
---
Seeing that a round is usually below 10 minutes, I can't explain for myself why this is a thing.
---
Do they want to play with their friends? Highly unlikely, doing this setup for a few minutes of playing together and then having to repeat it. Does it make sure people from their server get more honor? Could be, but then again how much faster does this make the queue? Anybody sitting in the queue will get into the BG within minutes, so this will maybe shave off a few seconds of the queue times.
---
A full reset back to rank 0 sounds about right?
---
I'm 6000/21000 and I've lost a total of 6 bgs, 5 of which were longer than 20 minutes. However, horde got wat more honor than us in most of them (750 vs 3100)  was the most skewed one)
---
Well then I guess ill see you at the Drek
---
Crafted it at 60. Bought most if the mats and recipe (back when it went fir 250g). Unlearned tailoring immediately after crafting.
---
You're complaining that people know what they are talking about regarding a 15 year old game. Stop acting like an incompetent boomer and GOOGLE it.
---
What about the post is toxic from your perspective? 
---
The overall gist was intended to be uplifting to those who are probably getting worn out reading the sub where every other post is shitting on their experience trying to convince them they made bad life choices. It can wear on a person.
---
Is don julios the melee ring?
---
Maybe you'd be 60 if you knew how to use google
---
I can't say I feel the urge to min-max for myself, but I definitely feel the pain of the terrible design. Playing a class is a lot of fun in a 5-man scenario, but feels terrible in a raid. Love healing on my priest getting to use all of my abilities to keep the party alive. Raiding I feel like I have to hold back and remove abilities from my bars in order to play with others. Hots not stacking, debuff limit, and classes/specs being half as good as others makes the game straight up unfun to play. So I personally don't care about min-maxing with my gear, but when it comes to party comp or how I play in a raid, I will definitely change the classes I bring or the way I play due to terrible design. I want to be able to bring a boomkin to a 5 man, but when a mage also wants to come, why would I put myself into that pain when the mage would make things 10x easier? Just because retail took it too far in making every class feel the same, doesn't mean in theory it can't be made better for Classic.
---
That's from retail. For me at least he only rep I got was 350 from killing last boss plus 125 to first one who kills the mid boss. And 100 from the 3 tokens. I'm a human so I get 10% more.
---
Same here, portals are also free to new players.
---
1. Make a twink
---
2. Get 15 HKs
---
3. Profit
---
Herod is actually a bad ass server if you dont count the sweaty try hard guilds that think this game and everything in it belongs to them. I've met lots of good people and theres some very good guilds. Herod is the server all the pserver guilds decided on, then last minute alot of them jumped ship. But it was supposed to be the streamer free server, but obv asmon and mcconnel  like to play here for content (more so McConnell). Other than that it's pretty poppin over here. A bunch of the trihards got caught win trading recently and they held a court hearing on the server disc with over 100 people all were found guilty of the charges (except Mcdarnit ofc) even provided everyone with public defenders (all McDarnit ofc). Our alliance is something else tho suuuuuper toxic lots of racism ninja looting and overall bad vibes but they are good opponents none the less. You should guve herod a go if you're ever bored with your server.
---
Swords is slightly better, however as Daggers you get gear more easily. Swords is also better for farming outside of raids.
---
Hmm, I never said it was. Lol
---
Who are you quoting?
---
My biggest complaint so far in Classic is that it's hard to find/make dungeon groups because everyone is Lazy and wants to Spellcleave.
---
I've leveled a combat rogue and it's been tough as balls, I'm only level 49 too but its a challenge, people have been much more friendly so far too.
---
I finally got a dungeon group for Maraudon the other day and passed on the ring from Theredas because a warrior needed it, maybe it was stupid of me but just enjoying the game is what it's about if you ask me.
---
o7
---
ironically retail players are significantly more friendly which is hilarious to me since classic is all about the community  
---
the first 2 months or so were fantastic though
---
well played
---
It is to make space for their friends. I know because I’m in a premade and our leader does it (even though i hate it)
---
You want to rush galv or ignore him as he only he's rep and honor if you kill him before balinda dies.
---
Or protection
---
Yes you do
---
and a month long debuff that grants 20% honor.
---
Unless its Factorio. Then the fun never existed in the first place, only the factory. And the factory must grow...
---
You should prio stam and spellpower. 5 piece T1 and the 2 piece of t2 works well for me. As SM you want to be dotting everything with the occasional SB. If you want burst damage run conflag/nightfall, ill never go back to sm after playing conflag.
---
Same, I started actually reading the quests in retail a few years ago and picked it up again in classic. It's a lot more fun than rushing, I used to hate questing and now it's really the only thing I enjoy
---
It’s a pretty massive issue
---
Only an hour long? Pfft.
---
Players in bracket 1 on my server ended the day with 400k average
---
Bartender, the add on
---
As long as you have fun and find the people who are fine with you being a boomkin that is great. If I wanted to pug as my main source of grouping, I would imagine you won't have as much success as another class/spec would. I have found that way too many people are picking the "bad" specs and are upset that we don't see them as the snowflake they are and bring them anyways. For every good "bad" spec there is playing it, there are 9 that are completely terrible. I'm not bringing a druid to my 5-mans because I don't have any fun when they are there. At this stage of the game their dps is terrible and their healing is sub-par. 
---
I won't tell you your fun is wrong, if you won't tell me mine is wrong. A lot of people have told me I am wrong for not wanting to bring a terrible player.
---
People who rush for drek without doing towers/elites are absolute morons.  700 honour and win rep in 7 minutes or 4K honour + max rep in 10-12 minutes. It’s not hard to comprehend.
---
It isn't, but no one has bothered to report him yet, i'm guessing.
---
Sounds like someone has had a bad night? It's okay little buddy, things will get better for you.
---
You get miniscule amount of av when pve mobs die iirc. But you do get her (80 or 90%?)  Raid penalty an it's divded amount all people in range. First quest turning are decent xp
---
Spectacular example of being unaware of the issue at hand.
---
Sry was on mobile! These are the guys:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=5278/sprite-darter
---
Can easily be combined with the surrounding mobs for cloth since you might kill them off before they respawn.
---
It makes me laugh everytime someone has to drop group because of "wife aggro or crying kids" times have definitely changed
---
Right now id say the point is to grind to honored rep with warsong, and to get rep you need flag caps. Premades are the best way to commit to the initial rep grind, in order to finally get all of your BiS.
---
After that? Yeah solo queue to kill randoms.
---
Curious, What profession did you switch too after? And what’s your secret farming gold as a priest? Thanks for the reply
---
This might be an unpopular opinion but it should go to a rogue tank.
---
Good to hear, I love dungeons. And as a casual player I’m on a slower pace clearly =)
---
But is sounds cooler.
---
Usually 10 or 100x the bet amount for the initial roll ammount.
---
Spellpower is unimportant. Get the maximum int you can get.
---
I've heard this is what happens on pservers.
---
how on earth would you even make use of it? I mean AV is pretty big and it would require you to basically run around as a lootgoblin nonstop.
---
Herods the shit but like every server you have some bad people.
---
I was tailor / enchanting while leveling. Switched to Engineering/Herb for PvP and money. I'm now Engi/Alch. Farm professions are on my twinks.
---
I made a 19 twink priest as a dedicated healer and it’s been a blast keeping my teams alive. Turns out I’m just a scrub in a scrub bracket, darn.
---
You dont dot wand to be optimal. Maybe from 5-14.  After that you start doing a lot more casting.  Check out hydras leveling guide   I did 1-60 in 5 days on mine. (Granted i had 30 spellpower on a skinning knife.
---
Hurr durr repetition. I disagree with you, and OP is trying to tell people to cut down on the toxicity.  If that is your definition of toxicity, thank you for your great contribution. I wouldn't mind if there was less salt and grief on this subreddit, but that's just me.
---
And the obligatory  
---
"Good job blizzard"
---
Yeah if you have a tank buddy getting you orbs or will run the instance with you, that can save a lot of time and money.  Good luck with the farm!
---
I guess if you've either won the jackpot or are under the age of 18 (and don't go to school) this must be the life, indeed...
---
Then why play classic? Retail seems like its more of a product for you. Genuine question, no hate.
---
I dont care if you disagree. I'm right.
---
around 14 hours for human.
---
You have a house at 31? Call that lucky!
---
Well at first i did not know this was a thing haha. spend my whole night doing the same 3 repeatable quests. man i felt like a dum dum after i found out haha. it at least gave a pretty good exp and i did farm a lott of leather. so i am not complaining
---
Well you're definitely in the vast minority with that idea
---
So the game got repetitive the second you hit 60 but you have 30 days /played in less than 4 months.
---
Getting into any fights bigger than a 5v5 is not fun. One side has more people, more healers, more spellcasters... and the outcome isn’t really the result of a battle, but an inevitability.  I don’t get why people think large scale massacres are fun.
---
If you have time to post here you're not going to make it.
---
I just crafted them at 57, this is how 
---
As soon as I had the required tailoring I purchased the mooncloth recipe and started buying felcloth to transform. 
---
At about lvl 55 I started checking AH for any righteous orbs or golden pearls that came up cheap. 
---
Once I hit 56 I farmed Fire elementals for about 150-200g and used that to buy the rest of my mooncloth/orbs/ghost mushrooms 
---
And finally me and a mate spent over 8 hours farming big mouth clams for the last golden pearls I need. 
---
All up yeah it cost a lot, but feels good having a true piece of BIS at 57
---
Well not giving the opportunity is what good game design is all about.
---
I'm honestly not sure if you are a troll or not but here let me try to explain.
---
1) Battlegrounds are not regular groups. There is a queue system and you join, you do not invite people yourself like with groups. You do not choose your teammates, that is the point. Being able to kick people you don't like whom you happen to queue up with is stupid.
---
2) You are not just kicked, you are punished with being unable to queue up for another game for 15 mins, and the reason that you got kicked could be literally anything. all it takes is 5 people who team up together and they can kick you for any reason like what server, your name, whether you want to defend or attack, literally anything.
---
3) It is possible to sort of premade. People just queue up at the same time, and if they get the same BG they join. This is another reason why people might kick you, some people still in queue? Just kick random people so the rest gets in
---
4) Who's talking about getting carried? I picked up a fucking quest and didn't get a chance to play afterwards.
---
When they installed wow-classic.
---
Pickpocketed for an epic mount and some afer that, all in all somewhere around 1-1.5 k gold. I think i got about 5 greens
---
Pro Tip:  You aren't gonna hit rank 14, 100,000+ honor is worthless.
---
I onlt discovered while eating sagefish, and never attempted to drink mage water at the same time when eating nightfin soup because of it. 
---
It might be only while eating sagefish, but it seemed like the most plausible explanation. Worth testing, at least.
---
Yeah mate check out holyfrog’s YouTube vids on reckoning to understand how it works a bit more
---
Well, but thats not really your problem now is it?
---
This should be a healer thread
---
I mean, jesus this is LIGHTSPEED stupid. Didnt the older system give you a debuff and a timer to go engage in combat to keep yourself from being kicked?
---
This one punts a guy whose IN COMBAT BEING SHOT. The fuck is this lazy bullshit.
---
And if I don't want to level through quests ?
---
No they weren't you were just too young to notice them around you.
---
You shoulda always have floating combat text come on now
---
I'll see your "Wizard Cleave" and raise you a "Furry Bear Flurry"
---
I'll try to remember testing it once I get home later.
---
That plus "summon pls" with a bunch of IF portals seems to be the norm.
---
BG has brought a lot of our raid-logging healers back to playing on their mains with us. A good healer or two can easily turn the tide in WSG and make your team outright stomp your opponents.
---
I ran Strat live untill I got 4 orbs and on my last run to get the last orb the pattern also dropped. I bought 20 ghost mushrooms for 15g and then mats and had a guildie make the dye. And I bought a golden orb anytime it went below 10g. Got one for 6g50s. Bought last 4 mooncloth cause I didn't want to wait.
---
Truesilver breastplate is good for low-lvl dungeon farm. Also Mark of the Chosen (maraudon quest trinket) in a trinket slot.
---
I like the game, not the stupid min/max culture. Optimizing everything. If I wanted to play AV the way I want, I would get reported for afk and kicked, from what I've heard.
---
Got it at 60 with all the gold saved from dungeons, farming essences from elementals in silithus, and braindead fishing while watching netflix/youtube
---
Id recommend lasher farming with herbalism, u dont need to respec as long as you have holy nova and 6k mana
---
1692. Bad year. Plague. No fun...
---
I haven't.  I quit Classic because after level 40, it became less of a pleasure cruise journey down memory lane and more of the gritty, grinding task through less than attractive scenery.  And from what I keep seeing in this sub, I am sure as hell glad I never picked a PVP server.
---
I work 60 hours a week and have 39 days played lol. I was adamant about passing on classic after no life-ing it in Legion but I found myself resubbing hours before server launch
---
I’m hoping you weren’t playing during the days of the “African turtle cleave” arena comp. Youda really lost it then.
---
nah just callin out your lie
---
The top player I saw on honorspy was 240k yesterday for horde side stalagg.  I'd say 2 million is a damn good estimate.
---
I always run a mob health addon - no differences there While I can't talk about Vanndar as I'm Alliance we did some testing with guildies. There is no buff present.  It's just an issue of how many dps you have and how they are able to do damage. When we're going with the guild group our tank can facetank boss + all battlemasters and he won't die. Problem is the cleaves of all those battlemasters will kill of your melees and the charges and cleaves your ranged dps. So the kill will be slower. There is also the issue that rush meta requires you to run past multiple towers and npcs, dps can die here while healers and tanks have better chances of surviving so you usually end up with a higher ratio of healers and tanks.
---
Oh come on, r/pathofexile is a fucking pain every pre-league week, everyone is bitching since the Manifesto, even Mathil is joking about Reddit being a bunch of crybabies...  Yeah, we love the game and the devs, but damn this community like to whine...
---
so? it still means hooray. and not only used in battle.
---
like a programmer may say Ura if he beats a bug and everything works now. and so on.
---
It was down backup now
---
Hahahahhahaha original
---
They do this because they apparently can, and because they are assholes. People who are actually AFKing should of course be removed sooner or later, but abusing this system should be punished.
---
Wrath still had 71-80 bracket I think? In cata and later they changed it to 80-84 and boss seemed to be tuned for 85s so it was almost imposdible to kill and all matches went until resources ran out (it was way worse in IOC with raidboss siege engines).
---
How do you think Horde got lvl 55 elite guards at zeppelin towers? By whining on the forums.
---
I'm only saying the argument above applies to people who have played private servers.
---
Those that haven't have other reasons, many of them legitimate. 
---
The game will never be as we remember it from back in the day, we already have 1.12 gear in molten core so everyone is severely overpowered compared to actual vanilla, and i believe community led changes to the game would be a good place to be in the future, that is after the game has ran its course through Nax and the purists have gotten their enjoyment.
---
nice video! Caperfin here.    Im the author of the guide talked about in the video. **https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=1150**    If anyone has questions send them my way. I've also raid tanked successfully as a warlock, priest, rogue, hunter, etc...
---
Any idea what the average number of shaman there are in a guild raid group? Theres like 5 in mine and it feels like a lot but maybe it isnt. Wondering how many shaman dps and healers you guys have?
---
This happened on nost but it was because nost had original AV, not this. Therefore players would go back to other battlegrounds after hitting exalted and on non-AV weekends to get better honor per hour. While it will certainly die down to some degree, we won’t see the same kind of dropoff in classic.
---
That sucks hard for raiding. I had 2 Addons that could display the timers. Now it will be painful to refresh Manatide after a minute without missing too much manareg. I just checked curse for any totem addon that has been updated last days, did not found any.  
---
But would it be theoretically possible to track the moment you 'cast' a totem to start a timer? Ofc it will not display if the totem is being destroyed, but at least the timer would be accurate.
---
I know it sucks, but blizzard nerfs everything after those that get there first abuse the rewards. You have to participate before they merf the rep gain into the ground.
---
**SIMPLE FIX  #1:** Deactivate right-click-reporting for the first 5-10min of AV. Most Premades will have won in this time span anyways.
---
**SIMPLE FIX #2:** Hire *actual* people to police reports instead of having the ban-o'-bot-3000 doing it automatically like a killer drone.
---
Yap
---
Yeah, because rep/hour is somehow tied to honor.
---
So join a guild without that dumb system?
---
I was not lol thankfully. I'll google it later but i'm guessing the African turtle cleave involved a 3 feral bears all facing each other popping bark skin, and this strategy originated in Brazil.
---

Cloudkeepers dropped for us last night. Our war was happy
---
This phase is awesoem so far; significantly less ppl outsoor but not empty at all; all ally ive met so far and there was not a single conflict yet
---
I’ll definitely try to run with guildies as much as I can. Maybe it’s me but I always feel a bit like an ass reserving in a PUG group even if my bf and I run tank/heals
---
Yeah TBC was WoW's peak. It fixed many of vanilla's glaring issues (broken hybrids, useless specs, lack of meaningfully challenging content for different levels of play, lack of a skill based PvP system) while ADDING things, instead of reworking everything like a lot of later xpacs, including WotLk, did.
---
The complaints about it are usually just extreme stretches, and that's coming from someone who absolutely hated Outland and would much rather have stayed in Azeroth. It simply brought too much good to the table to handwave away by saying "but Shattrath!!"
---
&gt; We can pull just Drek and Iceblood master from the get go.
---
I just realized that yesterday. That's maybe the most broken thing balance wise honestly. Makes it even more fascinating that I actually won like 25% of games yesterday.
---
Ghostmouse.
---
You could easily check that i'm a mage.
---
 I'm just not an idiot and know that when I 1v3s and stall zergs(sometimes wiping 10+ zerglets if a couple fellow mages join), it's not only because I'm good, but also because I'm playing the best class.
---
This is me. I die inside if im being too inefficient.
---
I am forced to play a certain way in AV. If I cap SH GY i get kicked from the game for playing how others deem is incorrect. And who's fault is that. Yet again blizzard fucking shit up. What a great company. They have been at this for 15-16 years and they can't even get that right. It's not the communities fault that blizzard gave them the power to dictate how others play. I'm so over this shit
---
&gt; Sub rogues depend on openers to deal high burst damage. Literally the antithesis of what you want for raid pve dps because you can't use any of your opners except say ambush effectively and raid pve dps is about high sustainable white damage. High initial burst is a great way to pull aggro off tanks and die.
---
     It's interesting you say this because Ambush rogues are actually very strong on 15-30sec fights, which is common in boss speed kills. Naturally, this later in the game. I talk about sub rogues constantly on stream, if you care to stop by. There's more to them than most people think and there's a lot of false information out there from people who have only played in 2004. A lot has changed since then...
---
You just described me, apart from waiting for a caut band to ever drop and the odd missing pce of T1. Currently leveling an alt lock as we speak and loving it.
---
Classic has been quite pleasant for me. Playing on a RP server, I've really enjoyed the community and most interactions with other players have been super friendly.  Haven't seen or received any abuse at all. Five minutes into the first AV yesterday I was whispered by a rogue, telling me that I'm a "fucking moron" for not healing him (I did my best, but had two enemy rogues taking turns keeping me CC:d). 
---
I don't do a lot of online/multiplayer gaming. Of course I've heard about this kind of behavior being common, but I was still kind of shocked having it directed at me like that. Like, do some grown-ups really think this is an acceptable way of interacting with other people? Who in their right mind will hurl abuse at a complete stranger over a damn game?
---
I just wish people would take a deep breath and ask themselves *"would I get punched in the face if I said this IRL?"*. If the answer is *"yes, possibly"*, then don't say it.
---
"Hmmm this AH in Tanaris has very few items"
---
Alt+tab and google Gadgetzan AH
---
"Oh the first short paragraph explains to me that this is a neutral AH only for trading between factions"
---
If you try this it will take you less than a minute which is at least 5 times less than waht OP needed to create a new thread on Reddit.
---
See how you're trying to minmax their way of playing? Stop that. You don't know what will bring them most fun. Trying to kill higher level players or win despite the level difference can give you some of the best experiences you can have in this game.
---
You have to pretend you're having payment issues
---
I'd you got tank heals at least you could run it daily probly lol. It took me a long time for those 8-9 runs due to my schedule and never finding a tank. But then I'd only have 1 or 2 mooncloth lol that stuff ain't cheap.
---
That's not true.
---
This is some next-level delusion, gz.
---
wow.. I don't think I had a single game *over* 20 minutes yet..
---
You should 'keep it' to facebook
---
And it would be so easy to get all av to be klike this. Just remove the ability to pull any guy out of the fortress and have them buff everyone aroung with 50% dmg and 50% health or some dmg taken reduction.

In a game called "World of Warcraft" we can't even have open world wars without the server going to shit. That's why bg's got released early.   /clap blizzard you continue to amaze players with how bad and lacking in insight you really can be at something you are considered the best at. I believe they call that shitting the bed.
---
Seen it coming.  I predicted it would go the way of OSRS with the community being more about efficiency than fun.  It just makes finding those fucking wackos doing goofy shit in the main hubs even better, though.
---
Cloudrunners our guild looted yestreday say otherwise
---
The problem is you are not guaranteed to join the same BGs as you cant sign up as a group, its boring as hell healing randoms who you can't communicate with in a meta that frowns upon taking objectives.
---
Min-max so they feel better of themselves, in real life whether they are super rich and poor, all goes down to one point, to feel superior with others while they can’t do it in real life cause most of the people usually avoid confrontation. 
---
On the internet however, u can do whatever the fuk you wan and get away with it, esp if you are nobody.
---
Why though. Fucking why?

My own fault for playing the game?  Take that crap elsewhere.  There simply is not enough pve content currently.  We clear MC and ony in 3 hrs or so what else am I supposed to be doing?
---
nah you prob feared wolves into the warmasters or something and don't realize it because you're bad
---
Technically it does make it more efficient as you require fewer GCDs to get the same amount of mana back.
---
Fucking sad dude get your shit together
---
People won't take you to raids.
---
Guessing you didn't play back in the day or only went to Blizzard forums.
---
ElitistJerks with their spreadsheets and the dps meter add-ons have always been around.
---
I’ve been loving AV!
---
Indeed, This is a public space where everyone can share their opinions.
---
Bots are banned in waves not assassinated one at a time. 
---
Be a good man and find ways to get it killed and take the nod your self!
---
You dont need to be american to know that EVERY GAMING COMMUNITY is trash.
---
They definitely have as one of my guild OT’s got banned hours before raid night on the second week. 
---
Fishbotting he says, he leveled another 60 up and it wasn’t even a perma-ban just 6 month suspension IIRC
---
it's ok for now, once everyone's revered who knows. 
---
get your levels in asap imo
---
You can join WSG as a group which is what the comment above you was talking about. Your point is only relevant to AV.
---
It’s called “Filthy Neckbeard Revenge Fantasy.” Most of the people who do that sophomoric shit are working through some kind of weird power trip and worse yet, it helps them nurse their tiny, fragile egos. 
---
Go to the gym, do a mile on a treadmill and get the last laugh by outliving those fat, lonely adult fetuses! 
---
Also, fuck Blizzard but just in general.
---
On to *
---
That had way more to do with 1.12 itemization and talents than anything else.  Killing rag pre-submerge was flat out impossible in 1.03.
---
Its details. In turned it off and magically, I did not get the warning/message any more.
---
And blizzard decided to allow people to kick you. 
---
Back when av lasted hours and there was tons of stuff level 50s could do it made sense for you to queue. When games are 10 mins long and it comes down to 1-2 mins it doesn't make sense to bring someone underlevel and under gear.
---
Pretty sure in classic it is 1 person per faction each week that’s gets r14.
---
The problem is, with the internet, you "have to" live up to the standard other people are setting. In 2004 you could probably do whatever the fuck, because the only one you needed to compare to was your friends. Now you have to compare to people who literally play this game 16 hours a day as their job. Thats not sustainable unless its literally your job, because everyone who is not a streamer have real life responsibilities
---
As I asked about the honor, does 'harder' version give less honor?
---
&gt; I think it was less your rogue tanking and more of a tankless run with a decent healer. Thing is tanks aren't always necessary. Sometimes it can be better to not have one, or have an untraditional one like a shaman. Lots of 5 mans don't need them and that rogue can hold aggro and be very survivable in 15 second bursts of a boss fight.
---
As you get better gear, healers will less and less need to constantly heal you. Contrary to the negative stigma out there, rogues can actually raid tank if they get the right gear and buffs out there. I talk about this on stream constantly, essentially rogue tanking is capable to reach passively 48% dodge all the while retaining a decent amount of stamina to survive magical spells. Enabling them to tank many raid bosses in WoW.
---
Heroics, Karazhan / ZA for smaller guilds, daily quests for casual players, harder raids for hardcore players (that weren't just consumable and gear checks), actually meaningful PvP, better battlegrounds... TBC had something for everyone, with appropriate difficulty levels. No wonder it was so loved.
---
Tbh Alterac Valley is exactly as I remember. I was back then in on a heavy alliance dominated server and we had instant queues. Everything horde did was kill balinda and wait for the allies to finish. In the meanwhile flame the shit out of everyone who tries to put up a fight.
---
Given I was on a very toxic server, but that was at least my experience
---
Don't pay tryhards like this any mind. If you're enjoying discovering things, exploring zones, reading quest text, or even RPing, then you're playing the game just as "correctly" as the world first 60 mega-pro boss gankers.
---
&gt;If you didn't do all your ~~dailies~~ gold farms and ~~repeatable quests~~ honor grinds, you were behind other players.
---
Just because Classic has no daily quests, doesn't mean you won't fall behind. It's just what a MMO is. There's always people sinking more time into it than you are. 
---
Daily quest is a double-edged sword because on one hand it acts as a relatively easy and stable source of gold/exp/rep for certain class specializations that suck at farming mobs, but on the hand it pressures players to log in everyday like a chore (it does boost user activity numbers so that's why so many MMOs have them).
---
Was planning on making a post about this aswell, glad someone spoke up before.
---
Played 3 hours of AV today and I was having a blast.
---
Some games were zergs, in some we clashed for about 30 min, some we skipped bellinda and went through the "backdoor", I was having a ton of fun either way, but one thing that never changed was the chat:
---
"OMG STOP FIGHTING ALLIANCE"
---
"JUST RUSH HERE, DON'T FIGHT BACK"
---
and other "not so friendly" messages were thrown around in chat to the point where I just muted it all.
---
I was wondering why this subbreddit was in an uproar about^(since i forgot about the specifics in the bg's), but seems like it was a false alarm. BG's are still as fun as I remember them from 15 years ago.
---
The same system is in retail, and while i’ve seen abuse there before it’s never been this bad
---
This is just you crying and telling people what to enjoy.
---
Ahh yes, Classic players. The awesomest and nicest community I've heard so many great things about.
---
Yeah. People want different things. Surprisingly, the "level at your own pace / waah I'm getting camped at level 48 i can't play I quit" crowd ain't the majority on lots of servers.
---
Me, personally, I'd love to take my time with the game, but my play time is limited and in order to do the things that I find the most fun I have to optimize everything else. I believe that would be true for lots of people that have a job now, when they were students in vanilla.
---
For the record, my guild has already received both bindings, and a 2nd baron geddon binding. We have more bindings than we do leafs
---
you should try both at the same time. Great experience
---
It can't be removed entirely, it's been part or Blizzard's strategy for cutting CS costs since they implemented the feature in Cata or MoP, inspired by games like League that cut CS costs at every corner, largely successfully.
---
The fact that GMs won't even trade a mislooted item or refund you if you get scammed is all you need to know about how likely it is they'll reverse course on the issue of automatic reports.
---
I don't know man, for some people the fun lies in perfecting their gear, knowing they have the absolute best possible item for this moment in this spot.. I'm not a hardcore nolife but still I enjoy gearing my character as best as I can, I take pride in that and enjoy it, I don't think there is anything wrong with that. So the biggest issue in gaming atm is people trying to tell other people how they are supposed to have fun.. life and let life, if somebody has fun spending months in BGs to grind rank 14, just.. let them do their thing? Your idea of fun is different? Fine! Just do your own thing..
---
I was also rank13 during high school. Did BGs casually during levling so I was about rank 10 when I hit 60. Started doing premades from rank11 and spent my entire summer holiday grinding to 13. 14 hours per day, every day, with a total of 25 minutes for breaks. On a high pop server. While being the only hardcore alliance premade.
---
I keep laughing at the people who think they will get rank14 this time around, with so many people competing. Only people who don't have jobs (other than streaming I guess) or family will be able to do it.
---
But it's double Ony week.
---
Because largely nobody cares about BGs on retail, they are infested by bots and AFK players and that's just par for the course. They're a waste of time, you only do them to leech some free (shitty) gear. On Classic they're a big part of the game, so people will get a lot more anal about it.
---
Let me clear this up : This is me telling anyone interested why the post quoted is a shitpost hating on the community for something it's not responsible of.  
---
Do you understand better now ?
---
I used to respec shadow 6 days out of 7, and lately even 7/7 because we have enough healers for MC.
---
Now I'm not going shadow in the foreseeable future, leveling a warlock for gold farm.
---
And now you understand how stupid your argument sounds.
---
Exactly. He just wants AV nerfed so his retarded premade will be best honor instead. Both have ego-greed as their mission.
---

---
removing it would just cause all BGs to be filled with afkers after free honor /rep
---
Whether he gets the viewers or not doesn't ultimately matter. Asmon has said in the past that before streaming he just did nothing but play WoW anyway, and lives off government funding. He's expressed of streaming never became a thing for him, that's all he ever would have done.
---
depens, if you don't like fair games, I can recommend you the mobile game RAID :Shadowlegends a free game where you can spend shitons of money to prey on noobs. If that's what you like, you'll enjoy the shit out of it.
---
Omg the other day someone made a post asking if he’ll be able to get rank 14 playing 5-6 hours a day. It’s crazy the ideas people have about this honor system.
---
I'm just glad there aren't twinks and 60s camping every quest hub and high traffic area now. I'm fine with pvp but I've never once had a fight I stood a chance in since the honor phase started.
---
what do you mean how bad is it??? Its fun.....
---
We use the cross gambling add-on for when were in groups. One played in our guild is up 800g and some are down 300g. I rarely gamble, but I think I'm up 60g.
---
*insert relatable Batman quote*
---
so a pre tbc version aint the fastest for vanilla?
---
with the AV stripped to its bare bones?
---
Probably priest, but I don't think there is one strongest class in Vanilla, it's probably a contested accolade among Priests, Warriors and Mages.
---
Depending on your addons, it may not show. I know some of my buffs were not displaying (but Instill had the buff) until I updated my elvui.
---
Can I solo dungeon level an aoe mage? Should I team up with other aoe players?
---
I played vanilla back in the day. But on of my playgroup never played WoW before classic. So we wanted to show her wailing caverns (we're alliance). And being that WC is not that frequently run alliance side and not wanting to find 2 random DPS who mostly make the run less fun, we went there as a 3 man group (druid tank, mage, priest). Was the most peaceful run ever. My priest was a little higher and had decent gear, but the other two were the appropriate level.
---
Unfortunately the honor ranking system pits other players on your own faction against you. Minmaxing honor gains is required to keep ranking up.
---
I'm just waiting until AB is released to enjoy some real PvP brawl.
---
They should act asap. It's unfair for people that get kicked and 15min deserted buff.
---
why are horde losing so much?
---
If playing less than 12 hours a month is worth the 12 bucks subscription for you, then go ahead.
---
When Epstein didn’t kill himself
---
Oh you can, because the game allows it.
---
Well to be fair, many people in my guild dont log in outside of raids due to the Honor grind that was happening in the world.
---
Wasnt much of a point being food for the dominant faction.
---
Found the retail player. This is an old wotlk joke/troll
---
Yes, Soul link helps a lot until ZG, after you'll need to respec to generate more threat if you intend to continue 
---
warlock raid tanking.
---
I'm not the guy you ask, but for me it's the *chance* of something happening. The world feels dangerous and you can get into a fight at any time.
---
It's not so much about the actual fight, but the anticipation.
---
Fair wpn choices, go for it
---
I don't understand if this post is going against crybabies for things like people being annoyed by Worldpvp when they have been warned what a pvp server is like or if it's against people doing whatever they want.
---
it seems like the problem is with people not realizing they're actively hurting the progress other people make
---
Well..  that\`s.. just.. like.. your opinion.. man...
---
I mean I gotta get don julios anyways so why not lol
---
One can never have enough Dark / Demonic Runes.

I'd like to remind you that sombody can't reach rank 14 if they're dead.

If in the future someone will invent wish-granting hat, then people will whine about it's color or size or shape.

better, make the honor reward a multiplication of how much honor you won during battle, and make the reward thrice bigger if you win. So people are forced to fight if they want anything, and will do their best to win.
---
If you actually believed that you wouldn't see "being behind other players" as a serious problem.
---
&gt; especially after the first couple months
---
lol no.
---
Ah the int thing is something I hadn’t considered. That being said we aren’t currently running into Debuff slot issues so it would probably work..temporarily ha
---
Dreamwalker updated the art and added him :)

Best thing you can do is quit altogether, sounds like you're having no fun at all, let's be honest that's why we play games isn't it? When it becomes a chore there's not much point logging in at all, go outside and put your energy into something meaningful instead.
---
Discussion
---
I blame this on the change of attitude on the internet as a whole. Back in 05/06 (i was 14-15) everything was much more innocent and the focus on performing 110% all the time wasnt there.
---
As competitive multiplayer games have now become the norm, that way of thinking has gotten into everything which creates a very hardline, and sometimes even abusive, atmosphere.
---
People need to fucking chill.
---
Queuing together doesn't work on horde
---
I'm having tons of fun. The thrill of organizing 39 other mongos into the most effective strategies. Adapting to subtle fluctuations in the meta. Finding new methods of efficiency and eeking out subtle advantages over my fellow players.
---
The rush I feel when I see "Alliance wins" and I've done it in 7 minutes while gaining 2.7-3k honor.
---
Plenty of people complain, myself included, but that's because we feel a great PASSION towards the game.
---
That Hordie I called a slew of vile names is now my best friend and I revel in every opportunity to murder the hell out of each other and grow as players.
---
This is not only a chance to relive the content I did as a youth, but to do the things I didn't do back then, and to have all new experiences for the things I have done.
---
The hour long AV where we summon tree beard, upgrade our units armor, and deploy riders is mostly gone, and it isn't coming back, but that's okay. We have a new AV, optimized down to minutes, where wins and losses are essentially the same, but we still try our damndest to win.
---
My version of fun shouldn't impede yours, but you can't force your version of fun on me either.
---
Backstabbing the alliance healers maybe. If not too many resources are dedicated to that, it might slow them down more than it slows the horde down to lack a little bit of DPS
---
AP farming wasn't as bad as people made it out to be. I cleared Mythic that tier without ever spamming MOS and I was never significantly behind. I even had a couple of top 50 parses. Yes I wasn't in a top 20 in the world guild but they are too few to represent the whole mythic raiding population which in itself is a small fraction of the player base.
---
Oh I kill it constantly lol.
---
be more likeable, easy.
---
How?
---
He taught you how to press enter and type?
---
In game... one of my guildies got it last night.
---
12hr15min to exalted as a human.
---
You could get a billion or trillion honor - as long as others get a million times that you could potentially not really progress at all.
---
Its about your standing, which means your honor relative to your faction.
---
But the colour and size and shape SHOULD be able to change at will? It’s a wish granting hat for gods sake.
---
Lorti UI Classic
---
I do this all the time on retail and people get mad their 15 minute matches become an hour long battle. People even desperatey mass report me afk but I make sure I'm always engaging Alliance right now.
---
Want to be a min/maxing asocial turd that plays the game as efficient as possible? Go play old school runescape. I really hate the gaming culture nowadays. People just want instant rewards. "I'll have fun when the grind is over" except they quit or cry to Blizzard that there isn't any content.
---
I told many of them to just quit playinc WoW if they sign up for a match of PvP and *want it to be over as quickly as possible*

Lives crash within the triangle
---
It can literally be done with a hotfix. It takes them 10 minutes to fix this shit
---
People were also told raids wouldn't be handing out HoR &amp; TF like its Vendorstrike, That they wouldn't be able to raid as a meme spec, that the game would be challenging, etc. Pretty sure 60% probably honestly believes they can push it. The sets are magnificent and you'd be lying (in most cases) if you said you didn't want Grand Marshal/High Warlord armor/weapons/title. Unless they have significantly changed the honor system only 1-3% of the overall population will ever achieve this, but a neckbeard can dream, right?
---
You are wrong
---
It was, it's just that most people didn't know. Now all the information is readily available.
---
I'm surprised nobody mentioned the fact that when WoW first came out nobody really knew what to do, there were no addons to hold your hand and Thottbot was your best friend. The only people that did were extreme hardcore players. Now that everyone more or less knows how to play WoW, all anyone cares about is the end game min-maxing. I refuse to play classic like this, if I wanted to do this, I'd just play retail. I go to classic to have the RPG experience that WoW was initially created to be, I miss that aspect of the game and that's why I don't care to rush to get to 60 or have BiS or have all the raids down in a week. Wish more people had this mindset, and I don't even really get that mindset either, it's not like anything you do in classic matters because it's not "real" WoW if that makes sense.   
---
Another thing that bothers me is how people can complain about "how broken" classic WoW is and how "unfair" it is, like dude, this is what you wanted though. This is how classic was, grinding sucked ass, certain classes were broken, and pvp wasn't fair. Why did you constantly complain how they should go back to "the good old days" and when you finally can, complain about how it is? The WoW community sucks sometimes.
---
World PvP will never come back to the level of phase 2 (and not even close) All the people caring for honor are forced to be in BG all day so all the industrial world PvP farming is gone forever and we will just have to deal with regular skirmishes.
---
It's incredibly hard to coordinate movement without follow. Once you're positioned you can do formation commands and stuff, and for melee teams you can charge the same target, but just moving around the battleground would be nigh impossible.
---
Super weird. We got perds vis mageblade × 2 in the game but no caster ring or wsg epics. I am sorry but those buffed weapons are more game breaking than 1 ring
---
What if topping meters, leading k/d ratios, hitting diamond game masters and being world first is actually FUN to you?
---
We are a competitive species. Its just the outlet which differs from person to person. Some people do sports to find a competitive outlet. Some play videogames.
---
I have a full time night shift job and a 3 yr old... the day I play 8 hrs a day is the day I’ll send you my account information
---
This meta was nerfed on priv servers in various ways, blozzord outdone by russian basement servers once again.
---
Yeah just worried I won't see a drop due to other dps out performing me and "deserving" it.
---
To be honest, there's no correct answer to the TBC "problem" of content being made irrelevant. And it';s not even unique to expansions, like in Classic where the only reason some lower level zones are used are because they've dropped some dungeons in there.   
---
And this is also a good thing IMO, because just look at all of the complaining (and rightly so) when max level players do invade lower level player zones with no penalty for killing players of a lower level.   
---
So, that leaves little room for options to be honest, you have to split the players of different levels up somehow to preserve enjoyment of the game. Personally I think with the current phasing tech, they could re-do Azeroth zones again in a new phase like Darkshore, Tirisfal, Silithus etc. to advance the story which will make the world feel smaller while also have things make more sense for the players who are levelling.
---
But remember all the free water, buffs and 6-slots bags people were handing out?!
---
In tiny letters: “only 1 wish per hat”
---
u/Kaffeinekiwi Both of those shields are a good alternative if you can't afford skull flame. As for the trinkets if you haven't got Uthers Strength then yes, 2 of them you listed in particular are great. The Force of Will &amp; Ramsteins Lighning Bolts are both a great pick. :D I also like the Wraith Scythe weapon too, good choice!
---
Thanks for adding this into the post dude :D I agree with all you've said.
---
Alliance problems xD
---
You said it yourself, only in raids, and some items only (for example we misclicked Tranquilizing Shot tome to a warlock and couldn't trade). In groups if you need by accident you're fucked. It's a service they used to provide, it helped.
---
They refunded your items / gold if you got hacked (not anymore) and would also intervend with scamming like what you described, too. I remember back in TBC I gave a guy mats to craft my rogue a dirge for an agreed fee, he logged out and never crafted it, so I made a ticket and they gave me my stuff back the next day.
---
In the process if automating everything to cut costs, stuff like that gets lost, and problems like people abusing the system get introduced.
---
All I'm saying is that it's your fault that you (apparently) spent so much time with Classic, that you're already at the point where you've achieved all there is too achieve. Might be a great feeling, sure, but where the hell did you get the time from?
---
I'm living a normal life, got a GF, got a job, got a social life. From that perspective, I'm a normal person that's able to play like 2h a day, which is a good amount.
---
YOU basically "finished" the game for now by the time a "normal" person (with said examples) is not even 60, for comparison. And I'm not a newbie, I know where to quest at what level, I know the BiS list.
---
I'm not blaming anyone for getting good at the game, we all want that. And your character obviously is well geared. It's just about the time you've put into this game already that doesn't justify your complaint. There is enough to do. And you're perfectly geared, so take advantage of that and spam BGs.
---
 It's not like your character is useless with his current gear just because he can't upgrade it anymore. Just rock PvP with what you've got until BWL releases and try to have fun there.
---
I hope you are having fun for a long time :)
---
That’s what this game is all about!
---
You are so fucking biased holy shit. Blizzard did not decide to allow people to kick you. Blizzard implemented an anti afk system that people are abusing.
---
**You are wrong.** Max/Min people aren't ruining our game. **You're ruining their game.**
---
The majority of players want to zerg and get rep for items, and get title for items. They don't care about gameplay or pvp. They are the majority and that is how they want to play the game. We are the minority.
---
Here is a whole AV full of players that only wanted to zerg and completely ignored us when we met them at the lake. They just ran through and didn't even fight back.  [https://imgur.com/ZX3jBzD](https://imgur.com/ZX3jBzD) 
---
Here is an AV full of players on my own faction which i'll let the screenshot speak for itself.  [https://imgur.com/5PuQ18M](https://imgur.com/5PuQ18M)
---
u/Spuddie16 Small world dude! lol, thanks for watching them. Glad you can take away some positives from them :D
---
Solo on "dungeon related" level? No.  
---
Solo if you are 20+ levels over dungeon mobs - Yes.
---
Lol why mention blammo?
---
Depends on how strict your guild is on debuff slots, ask them first.
---
But it is viable, if you do go for it and dont have edgemasters go for muggers belt in dm
---
what is your /played time ?
---
Just reduce the enemy to 0% hp and keep yours above 0%
---
The key to enjoying a game is to avoid it's subreddit like a plague.
---
I mean different people like different things. So just because you like classic more and you have fun there and not retail doesn't mean that these problems do not exist. I think as well Brack was sorta right with the "you think you do, but you don't". One of those examples are the streamers, they hyped up the levelling of classic for quite a while and kept on with the no changes and that questing is more fun because you have to read the quests. Only to then just complete the dungeons and make that the only levelling they did. Just to accept gold and items. Now I'm not one of those salty guys but for the people that didn't know better this was quite different then they had in mind. What I'm trying to say is that these problems can exist and people still find it more fun then retail or the other way around.
---
yall still giving blizzard money? fuckin lol
---
It would affect literally nothing if they did it at reset, only downside is it would take more time to get exalted after that.  Wsg optimal play should yield more honor, current bg state is kinda dumb.
---
Yet another complaint about AFK reporting abuse from alliance again. I don't see it happening around horde side.
---
We had an AV against literally only Heartstriker, not a single horde from another server. They might've abused afk kick because they only had 25 people when the gates opened, though.
---
Offhand
---
You're oozing with respect for women. I can tell by your username.
---
Filth.
---
This happened to me just now as well. Trying to get exalted before our raid today this is quite annoying. For some reason I was also teleported to Thunder Bluff even though I queued in Alterac Mountain.
---
Unfortunately I didn't have time to check what players or realm the other people were, then I would have reported them right away. The gates were not even open yet and I didn't expect it to happen.
---
Yeah, this is apart from anything related to classic, but I think they intend to do what some other games have tried, which is to scale people up or down, and let them explore the world at any pace they choose.
---
Personally that's not too appealing to me, but I can see why they are doing it.
---
the people ranning out of things to do are a minority.
---
With their playtime, no game in the world can satisfy them for long
---
Nobody could solo finish a dungeon on the "dungeon appropriate" level.  
---
Dungeons are designed with 5 players party in mind. Alone you will die to first elite mob.
---
Oh..so the mount costs 650g and you still need to pay 800g for the training?
---
Uh, it's the people we are talking about. There definitely will be someone who will say something like
---
"But why should I waste my wishes on something like that? This thing sucks, go make it better devs!"
---
It takes like 18 hrs to get exalted with av.
---
neato
---
Yikes bro
---
It's inevitable, I guess. Having fun, but then the guild I'm in has started to focus on raiding; I absolutely lost my shit on someone about a month ago (which isn't easy to push me to) because he was bitching about loot systems, waa waa waa, what's the point in raiding if I'm not getting loot - "Listen. If that's your focus, you're already doing it wrong. Classic wasn't just about loot, it was about community, it was about getting together with friends and taking on a challenge and wanting to see -everyone- do well and get better, get things, and move on to the next big challenge. Sure, min/max BiS numbers/elitist bullshit is an option, by all means, but keep in mind that that has been slowly killing retail for years..." I've been having fun, until the raiding has started twisting the guild. More people brought in to fill rosters, rapidly acquired, now the chat's gone quiet, I don't know half of the people again, and that's really sad. I don't know much about the BG stuff yet, because I honestly haven't been playing much lately because above reasons. I'm still having fun for the moment, and it might be time for a new guild, but I can see the toxicity in the cracks...
---
Can relate
---
It is. You will rarely be alone and with only 2 people mining its already not worth compared to DME farming or BRD pocketting. Not to mention if you dont get the spawn you will spend at least half an hour trying to find the timer to even start.
---
Sure you would've, but keep on thinking this and go back to retail.
---
If you started at launch and you’re not level 60 you wasted your time.  Even half assing it and taking your time you should have been level 60.  And just an fyi I don’t need to “justify my complaint” as I don’t care what you think in the first place.. keep grinding big guy one day you’ll accomplish whatever it is you’re trying to do. I’ll be back online sat night for raid and then not again till the next sat
---
&gt; Yes, that the problem. Bringing someone just straight up bad is one thing, but man it's a special kind of terrible being intentionally bad. It's like taking a firestone warlock and saying they bring utility. Yeah, but them being that build likely means they don't have the 2 braincells to rub together to use adequate utility.
---
A survival melee hunter can dish out pretty good dps. Id be happy to answer your questions on the matter. I also wrote the guide on Barrens.Chat about melee hunters.
---
10 minutes sounds like a bloody long time.
---
real classic gamers shit their pants while gaming
---
We dont care about exhalted. We care about honor.
---
Idk I’m at work. Can check later
---
Specifically, battle groups existed in Vanilla. 
---
It was PvP against other servers in a larger cluster than just your local server population- but not against every single other person, there was still some familiarity that could develop. No more, unfortunately.
---
wish kids these days would stop being such snowflakes and accepting the apocalypse already.
---
I can honestly say it depends on what server you are playing on. I play on pve server, so far me and my friends have met maybe 7 toxic or bad players since launch. The only time I met the players you describe is in AV.
---
"\[AnotherAsshat\] whispers: u make 12 stakcs of 45 water? 20s."
---
WHAT FUN.
---
In AV you get 5 hk if done fast way, thats extra 200 honor, while in WSG its 30 hk and 2-3k honor in addition to bonus honor.
---
Ranking premade rather loses fast than fight 40min bg after everyone been killed 4 times so its no problem either.
---
Idk what people like about this. If you die you're basically stuck dying 5 more times before you can sneak your way back to your team. AV just doesn't work when half the players are trying to zerg it down and half are trying to stall - it should be either one or the other.
---
You can block channels.
---
Life isn't fair. There is no perfect system and that includes video games.
---
u/Wowfiend73 I suppose it's how you prefer to play really, I've heard loads of different things from people on which is the better option. Although I like SFK, I've still not had any saucy blues drop yet! haha! With that being said,  I'm glad you're enjoying the content man, can't wait to bring out more in the foreseeable future! :D
---
\^ this.
---
One of the big things I've noticed--admittedly anecdotally--is that many of the people complaining about classic say they wanted the same experience as they had back in the ol' days yet then proceed to play nothing like they did back then. They'd have perhaps put in a few hours every other day back then but insist on playing 5+ or even 10+ hours a day now and then wonder why they're burned out on content. To stave off burn out they then feel the need to optimize every facet of the game to eke every little bit of enjoyment out of the game.
---
It's gotten such that people believe they're playing "casually" despite putting 3+ hours a day.
---
I suspect that the people most enjoying the game as those who've been slowly working their way to 60, taking 4-5 months to get there similar to how they'd have done so in vanilla.
---
I'm not saying that that is the only way to enjoy the game; I'm sure there are many people who rushed 60 to farm dungeons and raids who've had a whale of a time. I'm also not saying that the state of the game is perfect and couldn't be improved--although I'm lucky in that Razorgore has mostly been decent, phase 2 has been a bit of a mess on some servers and the situation on Flamelash is shitty. However, I suspect a decent amount of people may benefit if they just consider that their problems may originate from their approach to the game rather than the game itself.
---
classic german
---
wtf does turtle mean, is it a new term
---
Yeah the consensus us on Arena teams being the origin. There are a lot of weird meta names.
---
You took the words right out of my mouth
---
I have no idea how this would happen... But I love it. If you know how to reproduce this bug I would be very interested to know
---
You can solo jump runs as a geared shadow priest. Last boss is a little sketchy sometimes but its perfectly do-able
---
Like every warrior with a shield? :D
---
This is non-sense lol, subscription is one of their biggest money maker what are you on about
---
Hi, my name is Schneaky and I'm an altoholic.
---
I cant seem to decide on a class, here are the facts:
---
* I like playing Gnome (yes I know weird, but I just like it.). I don't like playing casters all that much.
---
* Played a gnome warrior in vanilla and liked it a lot. Never raided, mainly did BGs and dungeon tanking as arms (works fine up to ubrs if you slap on a shield and know what youre doing)
---
* I now have a 46 Gnome Rogue (cause I wanted to try something different) and a 30 Gnome warrior
---
* Rogue: I like stealth and the aspect that I'm able to solo more due to stealth and oh-shit-buttons. I don't like the gear competition at 60 and general difficulty of running a dungeon. also I don't actually like dpsing in a dungeon, feels kinda stale to me.
---
* Warrior: I love tanking dungeons, I feel like it really matters what I do and if I perform well, everything runs perfect. I don't like the slow leveling and general lack of solo ability anything thats more than 2 green mobs. I also don't like the prospect of being shoehorned into fury and leather gear for raiding (does not at all feel warrior-ly to me)
---
What do you guys think? I've also been mulling over the idea of going feral druid, since I then have both so to speak, since I've heard bears are perfectly viable to dungeon tank at the very least and cat is fine to solo with. I'd lose my precious gnomes though.
---
Please help me!
---
&gt; FIRST DAY
---
Horde Queues:
---
Day 1: Instant
---
Day 2: 5-10 mins on prime time AV.
---
That number's pumpin' up boys. The 30 minute AV queues are coming. ;&gt;
---
I kind of get the 'I have limited time now so I play efficiently to maximise the playtime I have'.
---
But I don't see how you go from 'I have limited time to play' to 'So I'll spend the limited time I have running on my mount in AV'.
---
Why not go out and do something you want to do?   
---
If there's nothing you want to do in this game other than grind 12 hours, actively avoiding the content of what you're doing... Well that seems like a weird way to spend your limited time to me.
---
Those are completely realistic standards.
---
Probably because it comes out as toxic.
---
How much does the AV Battle Ram cost, once you hit exalted?
---
This is a week old thread, kinda late to the party huh?
---
honestly it feels like they’ve fucked up the drop rate, feels like every guild that’s been raiding for two months has multiple bindings and HoR
---
Damn thats 120g on my Server
---
what, for 5 minutes of fishing?
---
That's what I've been doing, made 2k in a week before phase 2. Since I need to heal BGs I'm just going to do it on a warlock when I need more gold, they do it faster anyway (last boss without spirit tap is no fun, I just reset him at 50%).
---
You can literally log in and go to the vendor the ring is not there.
---
Yes you're in the minority.
---
AV is not for PVP but PVE.
---
640g I believe
---
Gives 8-10 weeks than we will have fun. Just grinding atm. If you want fun pvp try wsg. You wont find us in there. Sorry for ignoring you but got honor to grind and i also wish wsg was the best method. Now its time &gt; skill
---
Nowhere in your comments are mentioning that you are talking about losses. So yea reading something that doesnt exist is indeed hard.
---
Human racial.
---
Wait was that a requirement to play Classic? Oh fuck, I messed up! I did it wrong!
---
Well you definitely dont get cut by enemy rush. I've hardly seen anyone stopping from rushing each others based unless it's a mage trying to stall the train.
---
You have to be the faction with instaqueue, which is alliance in every region.
---
They are toxic _and_ stupid. They could be only toxic and smart by just letting the other faction win quickly (25 people not opposing should make it really quick), however they chose to take a 15 minute break from BGs...
---
Its commonly known that Alcors drops only from 60+ elites.
---
I want to start playing horde. On wich server should i start ?
---
*responsible for
---
And I understand you lack awareness of the irony of your own shitpost.
---
Yes because the difference between Indie games and AAA games is that the devs working for AAA companies aren't actually humans /s
---
The goal of the honor system is not victory, it's honor. This gets you more honor.
---
It's a grindfest to see who can grind the hardest and be rewarded some of the best weapons in the entire game.
---
For me the issue is time - I haven't got time to commit to a dungeon unless I need loot from there. It's compounded now by the fact that I've got great gear but BGs are out and I'm after gear from that. 
---
Now all my time is focussed entirely on getting PvP gear or farming DM East for gold. I'll be running dungeons for fun eventually, I swear!
---
Isnt that like 50g every respec? Is that a lot at 60+?
---
If only this was the case for all classes :/ If some of the ranking pieces werent so insane compared to raid gear for warriors I'd do the same.
---
literally no one has or will ever be banned for abusing the report system
---
Why would you play like that though? Unless you literally play all day and expect to get r14.
---
&gt; Maybe I should just... Play the game... For fun???
---
This is me in AV at the moment - I sit back and defend towers/gank random players and I'm having a blast!
---
I have some int gear stashed on my bank, gotta give this  a try! Thanks for the tip.
---
&gt;  r/pathofexile
---
One of the whiniest subreddits I've browsed... They *do* post occasional love for devs too though, so not all bad, but overall... yeah.
---
The secret is that all these full time big wow streamers are giant man childs.  I enjoy some of their content, but the lot of them seem like ridiculously underdeveloped adults outside of azeroth. Amon is the absolute worst and it makes me sad that he’s the face of the community.
---
I will be the first to admit I suck as Starcraft 1/2 multiplayer .... I'd rather build a pretty base than Zerg rush or other tactics
---
This.Small defense is worth and way more fun for me
---
Same for me. Sure, some of the AVs I joined were nothing short of braindead, but I've had some great ones aswell. Sometimes it felt like players of both factions actively tried to oppose the dumb rushing meta by doing things like gathering in huge deathballs and coordinating huge battles in the center of the map.
---
Haha you make it out some secret club man, it's really not. People will communicate the caps etc with you if you get up in the top brackets. Maybe not in the first wave of R14s but definitely in the waves coming after.
---
Yes exactly Thankyou.
---
Im no longer a teenager. I have a life, business, hobbies, girlfriend. I can't help but feel guilty and that sitting on WoW is a complete waste of my time. Hence the unsubscribe.

Prot Warrior here, same experience. RN leveling an alt Warrior who will be pure DPS PvP, the real struggle is going to be sneaking him into my guilds raid to get geared.
---
Yeah and streamers like Staysafe and Assmon are leading it
---
Absolutely amazing. I can finally fight people of my level 55-59 as all the sweaty 60s have gone into bgs
---
Yeah imagine losing to get more honor. Whats the honor for? 99% of these people are not getting r14.
---
So you are telling me im making 1440g an hour with this farming method?? Damn, im gonna go make a youtube video right away!
---
Skeram... A PvP server. I knew linking realms was going to be a nightmare. It was too much to hope Blizzard would keep PvP and PvE realms separate. Blizzard really finds a way to fuck up everything, and people wonder why we don't trust them to do Classic+ right.
---
I can't remember the real numbers, but keta say every team have 500 points, for a tower u destroy the other faction lose 50 points. For every player that die they lose 1 point. The team that reach 0 or have there boss killed lose.
---
Who are you to decide what's right or wrong. Cupturig a flag/defending from the other faction who tries to get it is part of the game. They aren't afk they just don't follow your philosophy of zerging
---
Yeah but what is the point of alchemy?
---
Buy the mats and then resell the mats.
---
Or... and hear me out this might sounds crazy, people enjoy min maxing?
---
My toilet is on the other end of the house, my PC is in the front room. 
---
If there ever was a time to piss in a bottle, i’m about to find out.
---
I agree. I meant to indicate to the person I replied to that raid dps drops and pvp drops aren't the same thing. I've been pvping in my tank set and killing people I have no right to because they keep expecting 3k hp leather warriors.
---
&gt; insanely competitive
---
We are talking about 1 agility and 2 strenght over a 60 "of the Tiger" bow.
---
I'll take my IBS with crusader and have 9 levels of easy leveling.
---
Well how do you get back from stonehearth to the south part when horde is roaming the middle? Every death and you're back to square one.
---
When I picked PVP, I thought of little skirmishes, kinda like how I experience wow back in the day.
---
Not hyperdense singularities of neckbeard tryhards murdering everything in their path like a swarm of locusts.
---
Thats just ANOTHER reason to NOT log out :) When i cook some food for example, once every 10min i come to my computer and make my character move, so i 100% dont log out
---
and they won’t ban anyone, blizzard doesn’t care about this shit
---
&gt;after people get their AV grinds out of the way
---
What av grind? 
---
There's no way people are getting over 200k honor a day in wpvp so it'll stay dead
---
Deathrolling is type of /rolling on gold, for example you'll bet 50g so you'll roll /roll 5000 and get a number between 1 and 5000, let's say you get 2578, the other bettor will roll /roll 2578, and you do that until someone roll a 1, the one rolling 1 lose the bet and give the 50g to the winner
---
Let's go mind blast onyxia !!
---
I think I was in that group!
---
Didn't even know that jump runs also include a thorium vein! Thank you.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/ProGvkf.png](https://i.imgur.com/ProGvkf.png)
---
Either way, you are staying put :D
---
Why are YOU thinking that honor grinders have r14 as their goal?
---
Here's a factcheck:
---
r10 gives you the best pieces for PvE until phase 6 naxx drops. Many will want PvP helm and shoulders for PvE, not just PvP. 
---
r11 gives exclusive mount skins(black colors, and you can get all 4 of your faction) - pretty cool.
---
r12 and r13 give you epic PvP set. This set is so good that even when you have naxx on farm and full t3 - best classic gear statwise - , most classes will still wear 3 Epic PVP pieces for set bonus over it. It literally stays BiS forever, to some extent.
---
r14 gives you very strong weapons, BUT you will replace those in Naxx, and they are NOT that much stronger than BWL weapons.
---
Knowing that, doesn't r13 look like a very reasonable stopping point for many hardcore honor farmers? Considering that it's also much, much easier to get.
---
That's the whole point of them, there's 2-3 rich veins at the end.
---
&gt;drive my daughter to a school that's too expensive
---
You have to pay for your daughters education? Is it not free in your country, or are you referring to a private school?
---
Not if the person doesn't actually like AV at all, but just wants the purples.
---
I like the concept of AV, and would like to enjoy playing it that way, but oh well.
---
Yeah and all of that is obtainable at any time and you don't have to kill yourself playing a certain way to get it.
---
Depends, if they really are as so "bad" they don't know how to use chat, I could see it taking 30 hours to reach 20, at which point it's $2/hr of entertainment, that's well above average for videogames.
---
You are wrong, they get honor for killing me, an actual resource in the game used to purchase powerful items.
---
Sunwell Plateau did it right. Ahn'Qiraj War Effort was good too. And all we get today is manufactured gating with frequent Store Mount updates to force people to stay subbed.
---
I had around 7-8 rounds in 3 hours or so. Duration from 10 minutes to 20+. Queue time felt like 2-5 minutes. Mirage Raceway, horde.
---
I actually killed my subscription cause I'm so tired of people.
---
I plan to get to 60 just to say I did it (I'm 56) and then go buy red dead redemption 2.
---
Good, I say, this game was taking up way too much of my life anyways. I got shit to do, and this isn't fun anymore.
---
Except it makes no noise untill you do an action
---
You need to think about brackets work. 
---
The higher honor per week everyone goes the higher everyone needs to be to get whatever bracket. It's going to make getting rank 10 ass also. That's why you spam this even if you dont want rank 14
---
Honestly I think the people that think stuff has changed is that the people that never actually did any endgame back in the day want to do it this time around and all of a sudden they're starting to realize our sense of fun is different.
---
Twink warrior here, love the twink healers (when they are on my side at least). Twink priests when played well are very powerful. It's also nice to see fellow twinks who are not just Rogues/Hunters, quite a few of whom seem to be in shock that they are not the uber gods at 19 they thoght they were.
---
Did you miss the massive shift in gaming over the past decade? Every time someone makes an argument like "Why would we do X if there's no reward for it" in a game, it makes you think a little.
---
But that's just how it goes now, and you can't blame anyone for it. Efficiency is the name of the game now.
---
I pretty much remember non stop toxicity in vanilla av chat aswell. Your memories are just diluted. Just enjoy the game and dont give the haters more attention then they deserve.
---
None rolled alliance for a victim card lmao.
---
Yeah 100% but that's because my time is really limited - you're talking one or two dungeons a week because I can only play in 30-45 min bursts most evenings.
---
It's definitely min/maxing my time but I'm having fun doing it. The other day I spent two days helping my guild with Ony attunements, summoning people across the world etc. Really fun.
---
Sounds like a waste of time.
---
Since honor is not relevant to me, I'm just doing it for the reputation. I want those arrows and perhaps the ring, too.
---
It's the same for tv and movies. Everyone wants to be a professional critic and prove they're the smart ones, nothing gets by them! 
---
I just want to get excited about things :(
---
This would fix a lot. Also I think the lieutenants should be made stronger and maybe have a few other guards accompany them. Currently they can be solo'd quite easily and hit like regular 60 monsters. It would be appropriate if they had much higher damage (and maybe then also slightly more hp though the hp feels fine). Kind of silly how they're now just like free 1400 honor or so.
---
It's a pretty unpopular opinion but people definitely don't know what they want, and much less what's good for them. It gets even worse if they have to think about what's good in a long term.  
---
But if you put it that way you get crucified.
---
Farming XP in caves is a legitimate thing. And you can not be AFK for a game that hasn't started yet...
---
You can pretty easily avoid reading datamining information, you can't really avoid unlearning content that you already played through.
---
And even if you don't avoid datamining, it's still more of a surprise than knowing literally a decade of old content paths.
---
Levels 50 ish players complaining about how they cant level couse phase 2 and how are they killed all the time, and now when they finnaly most of them are in AV, but yea ITS FUCKING BLIZZARDS FAULT.
---
I see.  
---
You can have hunters (or mages) assigned to your warlock targets and pull them towards the warlocks, to prevent anyone to get smacked into the ground.
---
Same with pulling towards your offtanks.
---
This also helps against healing aggro.
---
I think video games suppose to be fun, everyone enjoy different stuff and they are free to do what they want to enjoy. Telling me that 1 dude makes 39 people not enjoying the take because he isn't zerging that's a complete bullshit
---
1 guy wont effect your zerg. You can kill the boss at the end with 10 people (done that yesterday), so 39 people can do it even quicker without even noticing there is 1 person who isn't there.
---
its like this with anything, no one cares about writing a review about anything unless they are unhappy, everyone who is happy just keeps going on with their lives. If everyone who was enjoying the game also came and expressed it here, although it would be annoying af, it would show us that not as many players as we think hate the game. And also remember not every WoW player , or any game, uses reddit.
---
Legit my life right now. Sorry guys, don’t be jealous! 
---
I start university in February and until then most of my life is WoW / Sleep / Alcohol / Friends and repeat.
---
Yea because playing WoW is getting ganked by 4 people over and over again feeding them honor, yea i forgot thats 90% of what WoW is about?!?!?!
---
Yeah, seems like reckoning now is totaly broken. It's worse then on a shitty pvt server, why fix something that was "blizlike"?
---
you know why. I dont wanna wait 20 mins for a AV queue fighting the same premade over and over again. With the same exact outcome for all the bgs. 
---
Private servers showed us what happens when you have a small pool of players participating in bgs.
---
for what? pve or pvp? for pve oeb is for sure better.
---
CP?
---
It also gives a lot of rep... Around 500-600 with tokens for quick loss. And sometimes you accidentally win and get like 1000.
---
Anything to gain an advantage. Reminds me of people playing PUBGA on low settings because it's easier to seevl through foliage
---
Because no one likes world pvp
---
You are still wasting your time, you are standing there by your definition doing nothing. If i ressed i couldnt do anything anyways, so now BOTH OF US cant do anything, thats a win still.
---
It's not hard being worse than Retail, where no one ever communicates at large anyway.
---
What race are you? Good axe mh from av rep I believe. It's better than deep woods
---
If everyone is a twink no one is 😂
---
I don't care about the single pvpers that fight in the middle. If you grab SH GY you are actively ruining the game for everyone else.
---
Gamers have always been a whiny bunch tbh (I’m one), but developers interacting with the community definitely made it worse like you said
---
Farming in caves is literally leeching as you're contributing zero effort.
---
Getting kicked before the game starts is BS, sure. But there are often people sitting in the starting tunnel all game.
---
Have you ever seen a tv series? If so by your own argument you are wasting your time and doing nothing.
---
Dude I speak for the community when I say sorry bro. You were right man, from the start. Absolutely fantastic job
---
I play on a PVE server and the vibe I'm getting from all the PVP server players in the cross realm BGs is a very different one, usually very aggressive and selfish. Absolutely ZERO regrets with my server choice, Mirage Raceway FTW!
---
Would you play CSGO and lose purposefully if it gave you more rewards. Serious question.
---
I second this.
---
I am unemployed and my working friend has more hours then my by close to 2x..
---
He plays at work lol
---
What a sick IQ, cant comprehend a simple concept, show em whos boss genius.
---
Why you assume they will only waste 10min killing me, but waste 30min waiting for me, thats illogical, did that sound logical in your low IQ brain? I bet it did :)
---
Then you need to make them fix their feedback and find out what it is truely they don’t like. 
---
M
---
If you are not happy, uninstall game.
---
Or from fall damage
---
I dunno, when you say something is overpowered it's usually implied that you think it's stronger in relation to other things. Vanilla pvp is a cheese factory to begin with.
---
I'm a Rogue anyway so this didn't really apply to me anyway lol
---
I hated Xrealm on retail, but for the purpose of BG's its a logical necessity. In the ideal world, it would be limited to just your server, but that also increases your wait exponentially and likely puts you against the same premades all the time.
---
It's a lesser evil.
---
Your english seems absolutely fine, you just seem to have no interest in improving how you communicate yourself to strangers, so unfortunately yes people will take what you have to say less seriously.
---
Benediction, honestly it could be worse, it's a pretty balanced server.
---
Exactly
---
The uber elite players were trying to win the game at this point
---
I don't play paladins but Google gave me [this](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/reckoning-and-its-functionality/113132).
---
The way you come across in your post and your admittance that you talk shit in BGs, I can see why people want you out. Try not be an idiot. And it's Balinda, not Belinda. I wouldn't take strategic advice from someone who didn't even know the NPC names so there's that.
---
You obviously chose the wrong server. My experience is exactly the opposite to yours. I will agree about Mara though, difficult to find a group for full run but then again that is not a suprise, full mara is so boring.
---
I've been lucky and haven't had any issues with a language barrier yet. Hopefully it stays that way,but I am cross realmed with faerlina.
---
RemindMe! 8 weeks "see if he's hard stuck rank 13"
---
You're free to think whatever you want.
---
Personally I support democracy and if there's someone that ruins the fun of the majority of player I will do everything in my power to have them removed.
---
Okay, thank you, same for me in the EU.
---
Got a chuckle out of me.
---
Also, PERKELE
---
a very important part of the game itself is shit? interesting
---
&gt;Granted this is my first World of Warcraft experience,
---
These are the people who are enjoying classic the most, it seems.  Which makes me laugh.
---
I'm not saying that my imaginary scenario is accurate, but in my head these are all people who form opinions based on the internet trend.  They thought wow was stupid diluted and easy so they never tried it.  Then Classic came out and they heard it was harder, better and more serious, so they tried it.  Now they love wow, but only classic.  Not retail.  That's dumb, even though they've never tried it.
---
That's the story I'm telling myself.
---
Re roll on a lower pop server. You will have more fun there.
---
19/0/32 Conflag spec is really fun, and still viable for raiding. You miss out on the 15% shadow damage from Shadow Mastery, but with good enough gear, people wont notice.
---
I would say, go for 4500 health. Try to get rank 10 for the helm, shoulders and gloves and fill remaining slots with felheart/nemesis. A setup like that should perform well in BG's and WPvP.
---
yeah, it's insane there are literally 1 trick ponies on off-meta champions in the highest rank in League, and then you have shitters in Silver popping their blood vessels cause you pick a character that was only played once so far this season in the pro scene. Then these same players go on to praise pro players for finding good off-meta picks. Someone should make a MOBA without different characters, like CS.
---
My hunter wants those arrows and then he wants that ring! Shouldn't take more than 20-25h of AV!
---
Not bye I want to be friends
---
Ďď 33dzxx is dd4 not 3rd in the z3 and the other is the z and the other two😂 are rd
---
Now play this game and neglect responsibilites I shall
---
No they don't lol :P And I bet that mama blizzard will step in to stop the behavior of people with your childish mentality.
---
Doesn't really work on larger servers, everyone who needs the set has long since bought it from the many leatherworkers available
---
The opposite might also be true. People optimize a game because they optimize and/or are also competitive in RL as well. 
---
It doesn't have to be the hardest or the most prestigious achievement out there, some people feel good only when they play to win, in most/all aspects of life.
---
I think a lot of ppl are gonna start realizing this and only neckbeards without a job and/or family are going to keep playing classic.
---
U better play singleplayer games and enjoy it, thats my way to go at least until Shadowlands.
---
Well yeah obviously it's going to be like that on launch day. Could we at least wait, I don't know, one or two weeks for things to settle before we all feverishly yell "DED GAEM DED GAEM LUL BGS KILLT IT, CLEETUS"?
---
Yeah, we all know about the rules how you should lose the stacks but right now you lose'em at random or if you use judgment/holy light/Flash of light? it's so random haha
---
You can't make a fun queue for AV though.
---
Thankfully «Rush Drek» is pretty hard to misunderstand
---
Priests can duo jumprun with warriors other days ;)
---
Help I'm sinking!!
---
I mean, yeah, classic+ is a risk, but I think it makes more sense to try and apply the lessons they have learned from retail to new content than to just keep applying already released expansions until either the playerbase is completely fractured, or we wind up right back where we started.
---
Me as a pvper.
---
Which fixes nothing. It actually makes it worse since everyone will have to keep this level of honor farm just to maintain rank.
---
Well you remember incorrectly.
---
Diamond Flask is better (for warriors, from a quest)
---
DFT from BWL is better
---
Badge of the Swarmguard and Jom Gabbar from AQ40 are better
---
Kiss of the Spider and Slayer's Crest from Naxx are also better.
---
So it's BiS up to phase 5, which is good, but not for the entire game
---
Thats the true classic pvp server feeling!
---
On EU the atmosphere feels chill. Some people only start raging when it seems the battle will become a stalemate.
---
Gratz man! We just got our second Garr one last night as well. No Geddon ones yet.
---
Really how many of these dudes are seriously looking to rank up past rank 10. Have they thought that far ahead?
---
People still play west taiwan slave games?
---
It's not exactly hard to wipe a premade when they rush a boss. All you need is a few mages with invis pots and it sends the entire team back to the graveyard. The problem is you're potentially wasting everybody's time by doing that. We wiped horde raid at balinda once, they all respawn at iceblood and start the turtle. Never doing that again.
---
Thank you. Been missing my timers.
---
That's not how statistics work.
---
Now thats a women respect name
---
Somebody tune those fucking guitars what the hell
---
Also screw your sense of community. I play to pvp and I dont care about what your gnome name is, I'll slaughter all of you stupid looking midgets
---
Nice binds.. WoW!
---
Why would that make me not fun at parties? I don't understand
---
cake day! :)
---
yes
---
no
---
maybe
---
I don’t play Classic nor do I play retail. After Phase 1 we did all the content. Killed the world bosses. I was super hyped for Classic until I found out about across-Realm BGs. A lot of people enjoyed seeing familiar faces rather than later Vanilla and Retail forgetful battles with servers you’ve never heard of or people you’ll never see again. Many people feel that way. You can down vote me all you like but it doesn’t change the fact that a good portion of people who wanted Classic wanted that feature.
---
Yeah. Honestly that's what I should stick to.  When I was younger and I had more patience, was more impressionable, and a little angrier, I'd probably enjoy 2019 vanilla wow.
---
But nothing you can do in wow compares to the feeling you get when you accomplish something in real life, and both take the same amount of *fucking time*.
---
I used to looove multiplayer games, I love pvp, I think my favorite pvp experience *ever* was the original DayZ mod.  Got my heart racing.
---
But I don't think I like MMO pvp, because it's mostly gear checks. Very little skill expression.   I've not once felt like a fight has been on equal footing. I'm either totally stomping someone or getting stomped myself.  There's no adrenaline, just guilt when I win, frustrating when I lose.
---
No thrill of the hunt, so to speak.
---
RNG is RNG. I had to kill Gehennas 11 times before I saw one pair of GS boots drop.
---
For me, the journey is being ganked repeatedly whilst I try and level.
---
Try weaving in feint or vanish, works wonders.
---
Thats 98k
---
Where?
---
Rogues in AV? Y-y-yeah o-okay...
---
Especially after literally everyone calling for "no changes".
---
Almost like classic wasn't as perfect as you remembered and now you're mad about it
---
Oh waouh ! Never heard of it ! Thank you , i appreciate it :)
---
That satyr/imp pack is because he spawns his Hydrolings when he's really close. If you get him to 50% to spawn his adds when he's far from the pack they will never aggro.
---
I was confused about this for ages but honestly, just get him to 50% near to you, no issues then.
---
Iv been testing some duels and it works flawless in duels n world pvp in Altrc Mountains, this is so strange man...
---
Nice edit!
---
Isn't that mostly full of smut and cringey roleplay though?
---
 &gt;WTF stop playing so much?
---
Yeah, stop enjoying yourself!
---
Did someone get both bindings?
---
Wasn't it the official /r/classicwow non-streamer server lol
---
Korean raiding sounds awful tbh.
---
I've had it happen before and after hydroling spawns, it just seems random if he gets weird pathing sometimes.
---
To be fair though this is exactly how I remember 1.12 AV in vanilla. People reminiscing about AV are mostly thinking about 1.5 or 1.6 AV. 
---
1.12 AV has always been a zergfest, I'm not sure why people are surprised.
---
You thought you did but you didn’t.
---
And your complimentary, pointy "DUNCE" hat.
---
Yeah 30  people in start cave running autoit jump scripts while 10 of us played the game. They just need to fix how the flag is cleared.
---
Opening phase 2 at 3 months was a big downturn for me. I wasn't rushing to cap. Or being efficient at exp gains. I waited for friends and rerolled afew times trying out the first 15-20 lvls of a class or race trying to find what fit me. So I hit 49 on that morning and lost most of the ingame friends in that week. The info was out there but I was hoping that phase 2 wasn't till after the 1st of the year.
---
That's some pretty incomplete logic you've got there.
---
In MC each boss drops just 2 epics drawn from a pool of close to 20 pieces and there's no guarantee that either of those epics will even be for your class/spec and on the off-chance they are something good for you then you'll be vying for it against 15~25 people.
---
In LFR the bosses die and a quarter of the raid is given loot for their class and spec straight to their bags.
---
You're also ignoring the existence of items like savage gladiator's chain, hand of justice, felstriker and so on that will take you hundreds of runs just to see and, again, no guarantee that it goes to you once it does---But once you have them they can potentially last you through multiple raid tiers.
---
Simple fact of the matter is, in Classic it takes time and effort to get decked out in good epics while in retail you'll be throwing away multiple epics a day because they're not even worth the bagspace needed to bring them to the vendor/scrapper
---
Yeah, by now there is confirmation, that the ring isn't there, but you can't "login and see it", you must be exalted and a priest, lock or mage to even have the option of seeing the ring.
---
I’m in your shoes. I’m having a good time and I just hit60 a few days ago. I have a few BiS pieces before raid and almost landed my first random epic from scholo the other day. Had the robes drop but another mage took them (upgrade for me but he just wanted for pvp as he had better pve) but again it didn’t bother me. It brings to light the min max thing. But, I have a buddy who has 2 60s, hates pvp and always had since vanilla but is always pvping now. It’s weird to me what people will do for gear and will make themselves genuinely unhappy.
---
Notice he says himself and the boys not wow as a whole.  Min/max your brains processing speeds while typing you might know what was said.
---
Also Ouro and Battleguard trinkets and Sapphiron's one.
---
This is not democracy. In a democracy the individuals right goes above the state. So my right to farm goat fur, goes equal to 39's right to rush.
---
1-100, or 1-200 is all ive ever seen
---
Those guys where there and they killed of WOW and are the cause ...
---
W H Y
---
Retail is what it is.
---
We could not handle them in the past cause Blizzard listened to them. 
---
We will not handle them today cause they will destroy this game once more.
---
You can't argue with those people. They are closed minded and only see themself in the center of their universe.
---
interface options-&gt;accessibillity-&gt;enable colour blind mode
---
you can configure rgb for enemy/allied/neutral players and item rarity as you wish without addons
---
A lot of people do actually just stand afk in the cave though, even if they are at the computer. He could well have been just leeching from everyone else. *shrug*
---
You people are dilusional, the most notorious clips from vanilla are the vids of people ninja looting, rageing on ventrilo, guild drama, killing people at a wow funeral, ninja pulling and bug exploits. You can use a waybackmachine and look at the old forums. It was just as toxic as now, hell, most game devs have hilarious rage-rants from back in the day, Jeff Kaplan, Ian, Tseric etc etc. 
---
I just assume none of you actually played back then or that you were a naive 7 year old that didn't care.
---
Yep. It costs them between 18 and 20 silver, so with 55 silver, it’s a net profit of 35 to 37 silver to:
---
- Buy the reagent if you don’t have it
---
- invite the person
---
- trade the payment
---
- cast the spell
---
- degroup
---
Still one of the best gold per hour in the game as it takes 30 seconds to do (more than 40 gold doing nothing..)
---
Yes it does. A larger sample size gives more accurate results.
---
*Unadulterated twink hate incoming!*
---
They listened to nochangers. Blizzard was already looking at a TBC and wrath remake before classics release, meaning they could have just made the TBC honor system now to save money.
---
Lemme tell ya.... it was hell.
---
Combat spec rogue for AV good since its mostly PvE anyways?
---
That's like asking if you would take a slap in the face for 500 bucks a slap. Yes. Yes everyone in the world would so that. Until. The. End. Of. Time.
---
That's why I always said classic won't be the classic you remembered. The private servers found out the most optimal way to do everything, and a lot of it is not what people did way back when.
---
Everyone wanted no changes, that's what was obviously gonna happen, not community cries again.
---
They love crying a lot, always did
---
Otherwise
---
Thanks guys! Brilliant pointers !
---
Yoda should be level 255
---
Community mainly. As a whole the server tends to be more mature. A lot of us don't RP, but but the mentality and respect is way better than on other servers. It still has it's hardcore guilds and players, but overall its a lot more relaxed and fun. People are encouraged to play at their own pace and style etc.
---
1 word:
---
streamers.
---
ZF at least until you have every piece of gear you need from it. After that, I'd suggest going into the ST until 52 at which point you can combine BRD with Searing Gorge
---
That's why there is less and less gameplay in modern games and more and more reward types and stages.  
---
Many players nowadays only want rewards, even payed for ones instead of playing and enjoying a game.
---
Actually, you can get someone kicked immediately if enough people report you at once.
---
only if you got a really really good winrate. and most WSGs gonna be premade vs premade eventually so just being a premade is not enough to have high winrate. You have to be good.
---
Strangely enough, world boss drops are not considered raid loot even though it's impossible to get outside a raid.
---
If it is mislooted, it cannot be traded.  Found this out the hard way.
---
As a former ranker on numerous private servers, you are 100% correct. I’m not gonna be suprised if BR1 will be around 1-1,2M honor on really intense weeks on some servers.
---
I'm always a tourist in games. Some games I come back to, but there's never been a game that I've played for more than a few months at a time before I've got my fill of it.
---
I had fun leveling. The closer I get to 60 though, the less fun I'm having.  Also dungeons are fuckin' boring.
---
What ? I queue in SW and I exit back into SW. Stop smoking crack
---
Yeah just make a lvl 60 alt before leveling your main lol
---
Single player game? 100% agree.
---
However, in a multiplayer game the developer should think about how their choices are going to change player incentives. Otherwise you wind up with things like the honor system where the super hardcore are being encouraged to make life hell for casual levellers who just got to 48.
---
The big issue, for me, is that they upped the population caps tremendously. If they had kept the population capped at vanilla levels I would completely agree with the "#nochanges, this is what you asked for" logic. But that was a HUGE change that they made and it has had ramifications across many aspects of the game.
---
Thanks for sharing, I might check it out.
---
Because blizz wanted to piss your edgy ass off.
---
To be fair the modern games industry has turned us all into QA testers with these shoddy releases.
---
What is this farm about? Killing bosses as well? Never studied it since DM release.
---
It really is disgusting, had it happening to me, friends I have, randoms in chat on Remulos are talking about it at this very moment. Arugal is full of scumbags.
---
I'm about 250-400 heavy junkboxes collected, doing rep with ravenhold to exalted and I wish there was a rogue/rogues on my server that would farm them for me for cash :D Pyrewood-village EU-PvE
---
Think he means mages troll people with Darnassus portals inside AVs
---
if it were a mess, people wouldn't play. it's actually a huge success.
---
It’s just a standard PI spec without taking things like mana burn and imp inner fire. Taking everything you need in holy for raiding/ pve. My only tip for marudon gold farming would be to check out hydramist’s solo priest Mara farm on you tube, i just started doing it 3 days ago and I already have more money than I’ve had in the game thus far. As for PvP I play undead so devouring plague makes 1v1s very easy to go on the offensive:D
---
Where's that from?
---
I can only imagine people are reporting you away because of your insufferable BG chatter.
---
Type /gquit
---
&gt;I'm always a tourist in games. Some games I come back to, but there's never been a game that I've played for more than a few months at a time before I've got my fill of it.
---
Would have been interesting in the first lines of your post
---
How do you know who reports afk, it doesn't show in the interface right? Like if they only speak about it on discord, there is no way to know
---
Bloodsail is awesome and doesn't have as much RP as you'd think/ Horde is needing some population too :) People there are pretty nice.
---
You sound like someone the OP is talking about.
---
If you did everything to be done already, you probably went super fast or you have a lot of free time. In both scenarios, nothing the devs can do about.
---
What the OP is saying is exactly that: people wanted the old game but they're not willing to become their old selves. And I'm not talking about knowing or not bout the game.
---
&gt; The designers aren't stupid.
---
[Looks at retail WoW] Uh, I dunno, boss.
---
I nearly did not open the post because of the title, since there have been many similarly phrased ones over the past months. But I read it through, and I can agree with you only on the first point you touched upon; PvP. Granted I've not dabbled in pservers as many others seem to have so I didn't know how it would differ from back in the day, so that took some getting used to for sure.
---
However, based on the other anecdotes presented, you just seem to have run into some pretty unpleasant people overall. In retrospect I can clearly state that I'd forgotten the layouts of many dungeons past ZF, and told people before going in that I'm pretty hazy on the details and would very much appreciate if someone could take the lead and show the way if needed. Cleared all dungeons fully, Mara I remember especially since we ended up running a few Princess runs after the full clear to try and get the Blackrock ring to drop for 2 of our guys. No luck, so we added each other to Friends and ran some more runs over the next days, and moved on to some BRD later on. One of those guys is in the same guild as me. 
---
Me and two other old-timers I know started out on the same realm, we still play there, but have gotten tons of friends and landed in a guild with nice people with similar life situations and mentalities, and we're having a lot of fun raiding and PvPing now. 
---
In Trade there's the occasional weirdo who expects high-end enchants or the like for free with their mats, but who cares about those few exceptions? Overall people seem very decent, I've ran into a handful of trolls or toxic players - but that's what /ignore or blacklists are for. 
---
All in all, seems you've had some rotten eggs come your way, based on your story it might just be bad luck and I can't really know if you've contributed to the issues in any way or not. But if you're not enjoying yourself anymore, you should not waste time or money on the game so cancelling might be a good idea.
---
With this logic, most games are perfectly made, as the players could just choose to play it in a way that’s fun
---
Not how it works. Not how game development ever work or should work.
---
Well I've been playing since August
---
61
---
Why do you always have to grind for R14 when you grind honor?
---
R13 is very much easier to achieve and gives everything besides weapons. A lot of People are going for R13 and R12.
---
Also a lot of People just want the blue PVP gear - or the Mount.
---
It is not always only about R14. :)
---
I've been testing more as well, and the situations in kranttu's link do seem to (sometimes) drop stacks - the problem is that sometimes I lose only a few swings out of the Reckoning it seems; rather than the full 4+1 swings, I'll only swing 2 or 3 times total.  Something definitely broke, but I still can't figure out what for sure it is.
---
Fortunately that’s over now, thanks to BGs.
---
Raised the bar on having less fun?
---
I think the issue is people complaining that the minmaxed way isn't fun for them, while still playing that way and not trying to take a step back
---
It's sad that i stopped leveling in Phase 1 at level 45.
---
Now i'm terrified to go back, and i miss my Wow Friends.
---
&gt;Blah blah blah.  I’ll just do exactly what I want when I want or nothing at all and you can go back to being irrelevant along with your opinions
---
xD I just imagined you as a 13 year old girl, telling that to her mother and dramatically storming to her black painted room, slam-shutting all doors on her way to really get her point across. Followed by dad, taking away the door to your room "I told you what'll happen if you slam doors once again in my house"
---
He's right, you know.
---
People are chasing the dragon. Trying to relive childhood nostalgia, it will never happen and they will always be left disappointed with themselves. And most people today are impatient. It's sickening what the gaming community has generally become.
---
33% of the player base, the other 66% are divided between filthy casuals with job and family (me) and school kids
---
I came from originally. It was about fun and adventure, but unfortunately it's to shallow for me to enjoy currently and has become way too easy and mobile game esque imo. Nothing is meaningful, everything is dumbed down and there is no reason to interact with a lot of the gameplay and systems. Also it's lacking a lot of RPG stuff which I enjoy.
---
Probably killing all the NPCs, multiple marshals, extra HKs, and if you hold the enemy's base you get like 1 rep per second or some crazy shit.
---
Had one game last night that lasted close to 50 minutes and it brought me from 4,000/6,000 to 1000/12000 because the alliance fucked the initial base rush and didn't even try to go for another attack but they sure as shit made sure to come kill our attackers every time we started clearing out their marshals and pulling van
---
get weapon chain if you are not immune to disarm yet. +9 dmg is kind of a waste on such a slow weapon!
---
I imagined you as blocked... Oh wait I don’t have to imagine... gfys
---
This is actually kind of annoying for me as well, I KNOW there are interesting PvE objectives in AV, but I'm not getting to experience them because everyone just zerg rushes. I remember back in Vanilla going to a mine location to try and...I don't remember, cap it? Kill the boss there to turn it into a resource?
---
But even then, people were just ignoring that objective and rushing to a certain extent (although they were capping towers and GYs).
---
There's so much content in Alterac Valley I'd love to experience, but that's simply not how AV is being played, and it really sucks to be honest.
---
Very bad comparison with CSGO... 
---
In CSGO you literally don't get anything by loosing.
---
In WoW you do.
---
A lot of people didn’t want classic, they wanted to be kids with all the free time in the world to play video games with their friends. 
---
But alas they got a game they don’t like as much as they thought they would and didn’t magically time travel back 10 years.
---
I'll take this to mean that you think AV is shit, and you're happy to have it over with quickly? So you are in fact not having fun, you only want it over with.
---
bigger difference than any other weapon enchant for sure
---
Thank you for taking the time to write this.
---
And yeah, WoW just might not be for me.  Chasing tiny incremental improvements while talking with garbage people isn't doing it for me.
---
I miss headshots.
---
You can watch current rankers on twitch and you will see, why they do it. It's a cutthroat business. MN had farmed 75.000 honor until noon. Every second counts for these bracket 1 folks.
---
It does not make the cheating and exploiting better, but it gives an insight on why they do it. If it keeps going like this, the bracket 1 honor will be well over a million. 
---
A minute faster per 6min BG which you do for 18hours a day accumulates quickly into steep honor losses.
---
Boomer
---
You can do some quests in AV for XP. However, you will probably get kicked in the current state of AV.  
---
You will get rank3/4 within 2 weeks if you do 1-2 hours per week I'd assume (depends on how much honor you make of course..)
---
Lol that happened in one of mine, I think 5 or 6 people insta ported out
---
The deathballs are over, but.. I just got corpse camped by a multiboxer with 5 gnome mages.
---
So... yeah still at least a little shit.
---
What add-ons are you using?
---
That stuff is easily obtainable a few weeks/months down the line. People that are following this honor farming meta will get burned out in a few weeks.
---
Most rogues that i see doing well in pvp are like 21/3/27, i believe this is the standard cold blood/hemo/prep spec and iirc can be played quite effectively with swords
---
Yeah server is terrible. Please don't transfer here.
---
I think it's because if you wanna tryhard, you'd never leave pvp behind, since you have to pwn n00bs.
---
I just joined PvE, still low lvl, but already noticing a much more "enjoy the travel" oriented community.
---
Ah the more things change the more they stay the same. Everyone on DDs and nobody heals :D
---
people who don't min/max and get grouped with me ruin the game for me because they kill the second chance I have at fullfilling my childhood dream of r14
---
 People tried to do as good as possible back then too, but you probably were 11 and was running around clueless, guess that "fun" element you are missing, if you dont understand how naturaly game evolved with information availability, general higher age of players etc and the fact game is a remake not a fresh one then idk what to tell you. 
---
 How is it griefing to rank in wpvp if thats the only way to get honor before bg's? Or you think noone should rank before you think its ok to?
---
?????
---
class design
---
gear progression
---
Honor system
---
40 man raids
---
Nostalgia 
---
it's just fun.
---
Community aspect is a positive but its at best like 5% of why people play classic not like it matters with how big some servers are
---
If you want to get a feeling of a queue just go to BG once per 1-2 hours yourself. If you want others to have queues then sorry but no.
---
Well your math is garbage then xD or you counted wrong :P
---
4x40 = **Who's that Pokemon?**
---
"pre-raid BIS"
---
Oh snap u told him babygirl dayuuum
---
Horde also optimize for honor and rep/hr. Horde trying to turtle win 20+ minute games slows down those per hour numbers.
---
Weapon chain is really nice. You don't notice it much until you destroy a rogue.
---
I kinda stopped playing because of that phrase. The "play how you like" mentality went out the window
---
I felt as I hit lvl 51 that I was being told "if you want to keep playing you have to be doing these things exactly."
---
No, they haven't.
---
You can replace addons in your Interface folder just fine. Or use twitch client if you don't want to do it manually. Settings are stored in WTF folder so as long as you don't touch that everything should be in order.
---
Good to know we're making genocide equal to kicking grifers ruing other peoples fun in a videogame.
---
Thank you
---
Ur wrong
---
Laughed way to hard at this
---
Mages probably. Best solo-farmers, a must for any dungeon-group, incredible in both WPvP and BGs, and in high demand for raids aswell.
---
Achiever type player, when toomuch ruin the game.
---
Majority Rules :)
---
A full PVE specced premade should be great for AV in theory if you're looking to maximize honor/hour.
---
Combat is also very good for blade flurry, you're going to be grouping lieutenants a lot.
---
Minmax doesn't equal less fun for all people. I still enjoy the game a lot and looking forward to every way I can optimize my game in raids, dungeons, solo/duoing content, making gold and pvp.    
---
I don't have much time and won't become the best geared or richest person. That's not what I'm after. But I do like the competetive element in the game.
---
while that may be true, it was still a bad implementation for the game in the long run. Look at the state of the game today..........
---
Of course not.
---
ok boomer
---
This is the exact situation  that im in. I rolled a tauren warrior on launch on hoping to start tanking when 60, but ended up in a guild that needed dps warriors so i started playing fury on my taure. I got close to pre bis blues with few epics and i've loved the game fron the start. Still having fun everytime i play. And thats like 3-4 days a week since got alot of irl stuff going.
---
I'm in this post and I don't like it.
---
Maybe re-read what you just wrote. Noone said it was perfect but that is exactly how people play games. The player figures out what is fun, not the developer telling you what's fun or guiding you to it.
---
Mmorpg as a whole genre has kind of turned in to this over the years. Everything is about the rush to end game and then progress gear better and faster than other players. I assume its to feel superior to other players. I myself just found out I was guilty of this while playing ArcheAge unchained.
---
While I loved mmorpgs and have probably the best gaming memories playing mmorpgs in the past. I believe its time has come now.
---
One of the biggest selling points of mmorpgs these days is how addictive it is or how hardcore it is. With most of its player base unemployed people wanting to forget about life and responsibilities by diving into another, cyber, world.
---
This is unreal. People are in favor of easy rep and honor.meanwhile on retail they cried that everything was handed to them and nothing was earned. Classic players are a hypocritical bunch. Fucking hell. They don't care that it ruins the spirit of the game aslong as they get what they want.
---
The only issue is min maxing info is easy to come by, harder to understand. And situational parameters is even harder to factor in.
---
So you have a bunch of people running cookie cutter min maxing without any afterthought how that effects their unique raid composition of roles and personalities.
---
they succeeded

---
I'm having a great time, the ganking over the last month was really annoying but it seems to have completely stopped now the try hards are fighting each other :)
---
That's the whole point, there's no "wasting my time" in a damn video game. x)
---
Just don't complain that there's nothing to do in the game. Otherwise, have fun raiding.
---
Good shitpost except I'm pretty sure a majority of countries in the UN was against it.
---
I've had some people in my guild tell me they want to go for r14. Since our guild is mostly people in their late 20s early 30s, with most of them having a family, I just laugh and say that they'll never get there. Many people are just extremely underestimating the grind.
---
Or maybe we just have a lot of free time and don't like to play like we're shit cause other people in the group rely on me to do the job right. Simple concept but I play with others and not myself so I don't want to be bad, I like to carry my weight.
---
1 eye, no BRE, no Spinal, no Onslaught, 1 quick strike ring. I think close to 3 months of clears. Also no bindings.
---
I don't min-max and have fun :). The rest of it comes down to being used to trash people online, they are also drastically different, this is why the zerg and maximum efficiency is stronger.
---
I think the minmaxing decryers have mostly been trying to tell this subreddit to cool it on the flaming post, not necessarily trying to attack the concept of minmaxing.
---
It tends to be the more hardcore players who come here and spawn negativity about the current state of the game, ruining the general vibe and stuff, when most players are actually just looking for fun memes and shit.
---
RET spec does use spell damage
---
as soon as im exalted ill come back and fuck you up
---
Damn you're really thin skinned lmao
---
Huum, haven't played mop, but if you increase the number of quest an incresed the cost of items accordingly, to make you play at least x time. Then I can understand. Also repeatable quest, I just never liked the idea, horrible farming mecanic.
---
Most of them are still leveling as they are refuges from pvp servers. They may stay or they may leave. But we try to offer them help.
---
Your post makes no sense to me. Come visit me at my house. It's called WSG. I'll give you something to do. : D
---
I agree with the idea of fun coming from novelty. For me, the novelty in classic is playing it casually, after grinding raids, faction rewards, etc back in the days to the limits. For me, this means that I don't care about honor, I don't care about getting exalted in AV, I don't care that I don't even have an epic mount yet, etc.
---
I would've loved to play some AV with epic long battles. Looks like I can't have that because most people have other priorities, so while that's unfortunate, I just cross it off my classic ToDo list and move on with other things I still enjoy in the game.
---
I'm probably done with classic soon, because I've done everything I wanted to. As you said, when it's no longer fun, just stop playing \^\^
---
I used the ship in Menithil harbour without being arcane exploded to death by a group of mages.
---
I'd say it's better..... For now
---
No 2h drops for u either? We have been raiding mc and ony since week 4 and clearing rag since 6... no warr wpns have dropped. Not 1 single piece. 1 p-blade, 2 cht. No swords, no 2hs, no deathbringer
---
yes, u can't get russians in teams in BG if u're from eu, but u still can face them in enemy team
---
Pretty much this for me.
---
The rewards are great for PvE. I dislike PvP so i just rush through AV while it's hot and be done with it. Once i hit exalted you can bet i won't touch it anymore.
---
Yup its people from Herod
---
hiding gold cuz u broke
---
Very good points. There isn't a sense of non-optimized blind wonderment and adventure, because the majority has already been down that road. I have a few favorite singleplayer games I'll replay, and everytime, I play it better and I get more efficient at beating said game. It's only natural. Same thing is happening here, and if you don't enjoy it, quit the damn fucking game - life is too short.
---
I'm having a blast killing alliance left and right after and before the bgs
---
I never charge anything for portals, i leave it up to people to tip me. On average i get 1gold per portal
---
How did this go?
---
Ou shit, didn't know that. It's my all time favorite christmas movie to watch every year :)
---
What did it cost you?
---
all true, but they had their way
---
I'm alliance and I think the zerging in AV is dumb. I remember back in original it used to be an epic battle that could last a while. I had one game out of 8 yesterday that was a battle and when I said "this is great" I was told to go Jack off a dog by other players. I feel like this is a job for people instead of a game how the community has acted.
---
It's just not the min-max culture, it's people trying to get ahead and do anything necessary. You compete for farming spots, you start not buffing people around you because you just want them gone. You report people in AV so they get 15 min debuff and can't rank up. You want to top charts you want to farm that level 55 guy who yields honor. You reserve stuff, you ninja items. You do anything necessary to get ahead and it's just not fun.
---
Yeah most of my games have been quick win BECAUSE of mages slowing alliance down, they cced them after they ran past balinda, then at entrance to drek.
---
You can report people AFK after the game starts. Before the game starts is 100% abuse.
---
Imo, it's a question of time investment vs. reward. If you still have something concrete to gain from your time investment (e.g. a BiS item), then it makes sense to focus on that. This is what I did after hitting 60, I farmed all the dungeons that had items I was after, until I had everything. Now I am full pre-raid BiS (+some raid pieces) and just go dungeons for fun or to help guild members.
---
To me, fun depends on different variables. Progress is fun (i.e. getting a BiS Item), which usually also coincides with the fact that running dungeons and playing with your guildies is fun. As soon as the issue of progress is out of the way, I still do and enjoy the same things and I root for the others to get what they need (while hoping I can make some gold or rep on the side).
---
In essence, "fun" is subjective. To some people theory crafting is fun, I do that a bit, too. I am also devoting a lot of my game time to managing the guild, which is fun to me. Some people enjoy farming mobs endlessly and some do not.
---
Yeah I am a fury warrior, I get no loot, I spam buttons.
---
But isn't the content super easy? Isn't it fun, in one out of your 10 dg runs, to have a boomkin and see how it goes? 
---
I mean, it's not like the dg is suddenly impossible to do with them in it.
---
30 Mage quest for Ice Fury Wand will take you to 60 then you can upgrade to the wand from Scholo.  Other than that Polymorph Pig is a thing, get that at 60 too.  Be sure you're using the correct rank Blizzard(from someone who struggled to AOE grind due to using too low rank Blizz).
---
How long would it take to get rank 10?
---
Ah my bad I misread that part. Yes I agree that it shouldn't be possible to report prior to gates opening.
---
Arugal players are such cancer in Bgs I'm also so happy a left when I did.
---
I cleared everything in naxx but the horsemen, because that fight was bullshit and can go to hell. Now that I have watched it for a decade though.. gonna be cake.
---
About 15 Euro a month.
---
Those are items you farm up over time if you care. Nobody goes into their first raid with those unless they're lucky.
---
Lmao yea true my bad
---
More enjoyable, for the most part. At least they didn't have the trashy emulation of "spell batching" that Blizzard threw together and failed to even beta test. Also, at least the devs gave a flying fuck about the state of the game. Blizzard can't even be bothered to do bug fixes or post reasonable patch notes, for fuck sake.
---
People can min/max if they want, that's not the issue. The issue is that some min/maxers are trying to force their min/max meta™ onto other people who are just trying to kick back and have fun. The AV PvE meta and afk report abuse are prime examples of this crap.
---
I mean, you're not paying for my sub, you're not investing hours into my character, so stop pretending you have any right to dictate how I play the game (this goes both ways by the way).
---
Do you still want shadow damage for the conflag build? Since some of the main spells are fire or are you just pushing + spell power. Or are you going crit and fire damage.
---
Combat swords
---
People will 'optimise', especially after a decade and a half of being trained to grind mindlessly. This is the result of playing mmos for so long, the grind is all that matters, people don’t run instances for fun, they treat it like work, where they expect to be paid....not s hobby they do for enjoyment.
---
This is the result of reward grind gaming.
---
Perhaps level 20 in 4 months doesn’t sound worth it to you. But if they’re having fun, taking their time, making friends, it can put a lot of value on that cost of subscription. 
---
Not everyone is in it for the end-game. These people are enjoying the journey not the destination.
---
As a side note, I have a few friends that put value on video games based on the hours they get out of them. What I mean is that they want $1 an hour entertainment, so for at $60 game they need to play it 60 hours or it’s not worth it. I’m really starting to hate this mindset, it feels so toxic and ruins the experiences. The value you get out of a game should be the joy and quality of entertainment instead of just the duration.
---
Wrong. Its the 5set bonus.
---
There are ways to pull them without aggro linking. Stop talking if you dont know how shit works
---
ok TheDuderinoAbides
---
I killed countless players mid-air during TBC. Invincible you were not- especially on the initial 60% flyer.
---
This community is just toxic, more so with classic if anything. Nothing is their fault or the player's fault it's alway blizzard's. Just look at the current whining with server ratios, somehow people have turned it into it's blizzard's fault and attacking them when it's something that happened naturally and would even if there was one server, one of the factions would have a higher player count than the other.
---
Nah just the people on this sub are the vocal minority.  Most people love it and play, or don't and they quit without desire of bitching online.
---
great I hope I'll never get teamed with useless hsitbags like u
---
How does one actually get into a battlegrounds?
---
*Laughs in Halo: The Master Cheif Collection.*
---
Both are annoying and bad at the game, how can people get entertained watching those guys... I'll never get it...
---
I've never played WOW in my life, but I got here from r/all.
---
You're so right, though. In fact, the reason I clicked on this post at all was to commiserate with the plight, *because* I needed a reprieve from the fact that *every single gaming sub I am on is nothing but bitching.* Every. Single. One. I can't stand it and it makes me resent the communities I tried to be a part of, but found out we had little in common, anyways. But it just gives credence to your argument that I was able to spot the "tone" of the post here, because you're right, all of them are like this. And I'm sorry that your community here has the same disease.
---
is that ingame ticket? i remember on private servers getting a response within 15 min
---
Is there any way to speed up leveling on your alt, apart from potions and bandages?
---
I'd love to get to 51 this week (just 39 now) so I can win an AV and get Rank 1. 
---
My goal is to get HoJ before phase 3 and eventually make the warrior my main.
---
I got full prepraid bis and epic mount as holy priest at 4days of /played at 60. There really isnt much to do for a pve mmo.
---
Same. I dont mind it.
---
I'm on Benediction as well ( alliance ) and have not had the same experience.  I've always encountered friendly people and 60s who just run dungeons for lowbies in return for the unwanted items ( farming gold for mounts ). It sounds like your faction is kinda full of asshats. Which tracks with my experience in phase 2 lol. Defect to the alliance my friend! We have cookies!
---
I’m close to exalted with AD  but I don’t really care.  I’m never doing pvp again because I hate it.  I atk farmed those reps in retail years ago for the mounts I won’t be doing that again.
---
If you aren't 60, and have played since August. I'm surprised you have stuck around this long. It's time to put it down, this game isn't for everyone. Skyrim is a good game you might enjoy
---
But players in mines can gather resources for their team, which would be useful if games went on long enough. Real AFK players don't contribute at all.
---
They did give us the speed version.
---
You realize the current preraid bis has like 300 more spellpower for casters and talents are insanely better too.
---
We are playing vanilla, but with catchup mechanics from the start.
---
You either find the battlemaster and queue. Or go to the location of the entrance and walk in the portal and queue.
---
First world problems...I'm happy to help folks like that!

Just get a more casual guild.

Less complaining on reddit would help too you know

My score as horde so far is 1-12 in alliance favor. So I would say so. The layout of the horde base is just very easy to go through. The towers don't really shoot because of LOS and most of the NPC's you skip right away when you enter. Alliance base has towers that pummel everyone no matter where you are. They even shoot you trying to capture the graveyard. All the alliance NPC's are on top of each other right inside the base and near the keep. It's a lot safer to be in the horde base than the alliance base.
---
Untill i started farming dme i never seen an arcane crystal, even tho i mined around 40 rich veins in a week from burning steppes. Screw rng now i have 2k gold thanks to dme.
---
Have you considered tanking raids on your warrior when you're 60?
---
Thanks for giving this person your permission to play video games
---
Gonna need some context here
---
So what was the reason?
---
You're cool. I'm studying computer science right now, and the stuff in your first post was very true for me. I used to be a useless piece of shit that only played games and smoked weed. I'm a lot less useless right now, but could be doing better. Mostly _hate_ studying and often fail courses
---
Too bad you have no idea how to play properly
---
Yeah my last battle had 5 or so alliance fight us on the way. Then 8-10 horde went to our base after they died. Then one horde tapped SH which lead to alliance respawning in their base. With that they wiped us. However, half the Alliance was still in our base and thus they couldnt push us to SH. Instead we had a long fight on the bridge to get the GY in front of the keep, which the alliance won.
---
Meanwhile their people were fighting a losing battle in the horde base, but we already got SH. Now the Horde and alliance were fighting in the crevice after the Bridge GY. We were slowly pushing the alliance in at which point some of them decided to get to our base, all while we managed to have a small team destroy both their base towers. 
---
We were almost pushed out of the Bridgr GY as well, when Alliance send the druids, but they hadnt had any escorts for them so nothing came of it. 
---
Then we killed Van.
---
Raiding is the end goal for me in wow. Too bad its very easy in classic atm.
---
Yeah, I'll be grinding AV just for the melee ring. I just hope it won't be as bad as this subreddit suggests, I am on a rather chill server, so there is hope.
---
Bingo, TBC was the golden age of WoW history. WoTLK was also a blast. The lack of a skill defined PvP system in Classic really leaves a bad taste in my mouth. To be honest, however, with how massively Blizzard (Activision) managed to fuck up Classic, I'd rather just find myself a pserver. If Blizzard releases a version of TBC with this sad excuse for "spell batching" emulation, it'd be an insult to the memory of a great game.
---
Buy him nice items
---
I think a lot of people, especially this OP, don't understand a simple fact; everyone is playing to have fun in their own way. So you can't argue from that point of view. Think about it, you are telling them to stop having fun so you can have fun. But if you are having fun then they aren't having fun. It's the system itself that forces this all in on one side or the other.
---
Now if the way that 40% of the people on a server has fun ruins it for the other 60% so that they can't have fun, that's an argument you can make. There's enough people that have fun zerging AV that it kind of ruins it for the people that have fun NOT zerging AV. The way to solve this isn't to just shout louder than the other side, it's to realize that a compromise must be made so that everyone has as fun as possible. 
---
The easiest way to compromise is for blizzard to make simple changes. All one side cares about is the best way to farm honor. One side cares about playing the bg it's meant to be played. Seems kind of obvious that they just need to tune a couple numbers so that "playing the bg how it's meant to be played" and "the best way to farm honor" are obtained by doing the same objectives. That's why people ask for blizzard to change things.
---
Fuck of with that infantile elitist crap. You can do whatever the fuck you want.
---
Literally pooping now.
---
Does he really need one?
---
Guys AV wass never fun. This whole old style AV enjoyment is one of the major rose tinted syndromes issues of this game I love dearly that is blowing me away. 
---
I didn’t hit rank 14 or clear naxx back in the day. I did hit rank 10 though on a druid. AV was never fun, not when you had 2 day matches and not when you streamlined it. It was always a big groan during AV weekend in my pvp guild. WSG and AB were/are the 1v2 2v2 3v3 2vX wild matches and skill and strategy always took place. This circle jerk is the most infuriating one of the classic experience, it’s not based in the reality of the past.

This post very well summerize my main reasons for playing classic. Back in 2004-2006 my fun in WoW was had from the novelty of exploring the world I Had familiarized my self with in Playing the warcraft RTS games. I was a complete NOOB at MMORPGs and had no idea what I was doing. Today in 2019 I have already explored the world, both in retail vanilla and on private servers. My new objective isnt exploration but rather to "beat the game" as I never did that back then. Part of "beating the game" to me is doing everyone as best as I can, by optimization, speed-killing, min-maxing talents, etc. This is how I get my kicks from playing Classic the 2nd time around.
---
Pickpockering BRD. I think I've earned around 2k total from there. Started out at an inefficient 30g/h but now I can get 45-50g per hour.
---
It is a social game, the guy was friendly and offering to pay. Doesn't seem like it is too hard to help someone when it takes very little time to do.
---
Yeah for pve only players this game lacks a lot of content tbh. Entirely different from TBC/WotLK.
---
You gonna go chide that dude for calling me selfish for not playing the game his way, or is your moral outrage selective? Golly gee I'm real sorry that I like pvp in my pvp background but tell you what. You go in to AV and start policing all the people screaming at people who don't rush drek for forcing their gameplay on others. I'll wait patiently. Who am I kidding? A righteous warrior such as yourself must surely already be doing that.
---
You could be right in a sense, I just doubt it's that good of a story. People have a way easier time being 'negative' than 'positive' so I'd say if they do it cuz irl isn't going well, they do it out of revenge/spite/disgust/etc.
---
Grobbulus hosted a server-wide pvp battle/event before BG's were released for a last "hoo-rah" to world pvp.
---
This was a clip of the horde walking the bloodstained sands
---
I wish you could duel my mt. I’m not sure he loses to anyone.
---
I was in the one! We messed around in mid a bit, summoned the ice boy and lost as he was strolling up to vann.
---
Classic toxicity. Telling someone to get off the game when he or she has a different opinion. Class act mate.
---
Join an active guild. Make friends. Try bribing tanks with reservations and/or straight out payment.
---
All of the servers are going to get less and less populated. The initial hype of Classic has died down a little and it will die down further. If you're really having trouble finding people it's better to reroll now than later when you've invested too much time.
---
It’s actually insane, probably the most toxicity I have experienced in online gaming being in BGs with Arugal.
---
This post does not have so much to do with that, to be honest. There is actually no reward for surviving a PvP server. People do it because they think their progress is illegitimate on a PvE server.
---
I have the minor speed enchant, but princess catches me alllll the freaking time. I ran it 8 times with no issues, and then bam she kills me 2 times in a row. Was beyond pissed.
---
Ok plumber
---
I’m always swapping to 1H &amp; shield, def stance and usually die tanking while no healing has been performed on me. So, yeah, about them apples?

Then why comment? Get a job

---
I was in a toxic skeram group yesterday.  They were bragging about their premade group too, except... They didn't have any healers.  Me and another random were the only people healing (what kind of premade has zero healers??).  We lost and then they blamed the dps.  That means they must have queued as like 10 tanks???? No healers AND no DPS?  Dumb
---
I totally am not experiencing what you describe.
---
The alliance had the crystals to summon their raid boss but nobody would go to summon it, so it just faltered. We were pretty good at upgrading our units though.
---
You guys also rescued your wing commanders and summoned their mobs, which we weren't expecting.
---
Eventually people realized that we had to all-in and try to race the timer on ice boy doing his push. It could have gone the other way really easily if you had a few more defenders.
---
Alliance gets a mace, which is even better for human.
---
Hahaha I just got mass reported for encouraging a turtle and not wanting to just Zerg.    People really will throw away all the fun they waited years for to lie to themselves that they’ll hit r14 lmao
---
Last night I saw the boat arrive at Menethil with a living Alliance player on it for the first time in one month.
---
Anyone experiencing add ons malfunctions with new patch? Maybe i should re install them
---
I actually like punk rat, and his videos are helpful as fuck.
---
Definitely not the case for all weapons.
---
Thankfully I haven’t had to pug a single dungeon, and don’t expect to. The best part of Classic is getting my Vanilla/BC raid group back together again, and they’re more than happy to have me along. The people are why we are here.
---
Just use proper party/raid frames which show if the hunter is actually FD?
---
WSG right now is literally just premade vs premade. You're lucky if the enemy is just a 6 man premade and 4 randoms instead of a full 10 man. There's zero incentive for solo players to play WSG, because you're just getting rolled over game after game and the honor gain for a loss is pretty much zero. All of them will be in AV, for much better honor per hour and the chance of actually winning something every now and then. That means the premades in WSG just meet other premades, and their honor per hour will be bad. 
---
WSG used to be best honor per hour with a good premade, because you would roll over random opponents in like 5 minutes most of the time, and the occasional premade-premade matchup you'd just either dodge or play out. Now all randoms will be in AV, and all top rankers will be in AV, leaving WSG pretty much only to players who like playing in premade pvp for fun (which is good enough for me, but will lead to rather long waiting times).
---
there was a problem with communicating (objective points)
---
yeah you should just get a heal set going and then get into WSG flag carrying for premades!
---
Played vanilla lots and i am still having fun like first time !Pvp is great ,i am actually having fun defending in AV with small groups and pvping getting wins as horde!Dont care about "optimal speedy " ways tho honor and rep seem great as it is 4-5k .
---
Wsg is also blast ,tho considering how many full premades i am meeting will need one as well and premade vs premade is best pvp
---
If you're filthy rich you could opt for Kang (lvl 44 I think?), otherwise there's not much you can do before 40 aside from getting Ravager.
---
Iv done the av exaulted grind 7 times, this insta que to rush a 10 min game is bliss. In a week or two all the rep farmers will be done and you can enjoy the field of strife clashes/ 45 min games.
---
Alliance have always complained more.
---
Sounds like you are telling everyone how they should play the game while saying that you play the game however you want.
---
Just let people play how they want to.
---
“Life before death, Strength before weakness, Journey before destination”
---
I don’t see whats fun in anything at all
---
WPVP is actually great now! For the first time ever as a sub-60 I've been killing a lot more people than have killed me. Because when I see people it's actually someone around my level in a 1v1 instead of just getting 5 man obliterated by 60s. Leveling is so much nicer and fighting players is actually fun. Even if you die at least its usually a fair fight.
---
We're like an AI
---
Different journey for some folks. You get a reputation as best geared or top dps and that's good enough for people. They'll go back on a future character on an established server they don't have to scrape by on to make money.
---
I played the first day because I wanted a fresh server experience but many people waited until you could just buy a wand to level faster with or until their group of friends could all queue.
---
“Proper”? I haven’t changed anything about the party display.
---
Agreed, but to my experience this sub is a lot more toxic then the actual game. Now this also has to do with certain servers of course. But my experience in game is 100% joyful. And then I come here and it's post after post complaining about x or y. 
---
This whole complaining to have the game changed to your wishes is what turned Vanilla into current retail.
---
&gt; I am now stopping questing to start getting professions going
---
&gt;My goals right now are just to get to level 60
---
Well....
---
Seriously, keeping your professions up to date while leveling is a good idea. Secondary professions are easy:
---
- Fishing: Do it whenever you have to wait (e.g. for dungeon groups), as long as you have water nearby.
---
- Cooking: Save all meat you come across. As you are Alliance, in addition to visiting the cooking trainer also check out Kendor in the inn in SW Old Town. He sells a lot of recipes. If you find yourself stuck at a certain level, check Wowhead for the meat drops you need, and grind a little (or do some fishing).
---
- First aid: Save any cloth to make bandages. Once you are done with a certain type of bandage (i.e. it's green or grey in your crafting windows) you can sell the cloth. Check out the steps required for higher levels (trainer in Theramore, quests, books...)
---
If you want to make money, remember: The big money is in the goods, not the service. Go with at least one gathering profession (Herbalism, Mining, Skinning). The crafting professions (Tailoring, Leatherworking, Blacksmithing, Engineering, Enchanting) usually cost a lot of gold to level, while the rewards are negligible. To make money in the endgame, you would need rare recipes, which a lot of other people already have.
---
Blade of kill is the puppet guild of oWN, a horde guild, who also works with earthsinger and TB meat Co to lock down BRM for both factions, whilst win trading on the side.
---
This is par for course, and probably part of the meta to monopolise the top ranks on this server.
---
Hemo swords should be ok for leveling and is a viable pvp spec. I'd avoid daggers because trying to backstab mobs is not fun.
---
&gt;If you want my opinion Min-Maxing is over rated, just stop playing (as much) and I'm sure you'll enjoy the game more too. 
---
"My way to play is better", no thanks, i'm fine with min-maxing and i have plenty of fun.
---
You'll eventually spend the money and/or time anyways. It's not a good practice to have 2 gathering professions at level 60. And at the end of the day, engineering isn't really that much expensive to level up, at least until skill level 225. Tailoring and enchanting are the real money-drains because they don't pair with gathering professions.
---
I mean I get that but some people on this reddit are wayyyyy to obsessed with them. Plus half of it is their fans. They will always have people who are willing to do stuff for them to get on stream. Trust me, I’m in asmons guild but I never joined to play with him. I just wanted a large community to play with but some of the people in guild will do anything to get him to interact with them.
---
Agree and I don't think I can slim it down any more.
---
That's like everything in life: simply try not to be a dick towards people you encounter
---
The reasoning behind it, whether you find it good or not is, the sooner you have the best gear, the more damage you will deal (because other people have comparatevly bad gear at the time). The longer the game goes on the more people will catch up. I think it's just about wanting to be the best at any given point in time and that's nothing unique to WoW or video games in general, it's just how humans behave.
---
If your goal is to farm honor then rushing the commander is the way to go. My fastest round was 8 minutes. I've played other rounds that lasted 24 minutes where we actively PvPd against the horde. I'm not gonna say one run is more fun than the other because PvP can be annoying as well but one run is definitely better for honor farming than the other.
---
Private server idiots bringing their meta gaming has not been healthy for the game. Look at Faerlina. People like to talk about Asmongold and other streamers having a negative impact on the server, but I would argue that private server people like StaySafe, TipsOut, Walmart Ron Jeremy, etc have a far larger negative impact on that server. Shitstains like Unbind are part of the devilsaur mafia and they do not even stream. I’m not a fan of the streamers, but they aren’t the sole reason the server is full of drama. 
---
Before he deleted it, StaySafe has a VOD of him counting down his premade reporting someone in AV as afk, which removed the guy. I didn’t care about the pserver idiots before, since my server doesn’t have many, but now I have to deal with them in BGs. I got removed for being afk a few times yesterday even though I wasn’t afk.

LOL what sense of community
---
and GG win traders
---
Did they nerf it again? Because I got shit loot from running it 3 times. Like not worth it at all it felt. How’s your luck been?
---
Non-prot tanks and off-spec healers are 100% fine for all 5-man dungeons plus UBRS.
---
These matches can take days, though. I don’t disagree. I find the rep grind stupid. Back in the day I could be happy to do one or two AVs per day for 1000-2000 rep.
---
Rn I am using the fact that it is actually possible to carry AVs by taking charge. I quite often get those 2970 honor losses as horde and it happens pretty frequently you actually win (as long as there is one competent healer).
---
I will hit exalted today and then try to turtle the shit out of AVs.
---
Where do you even mine? I seriously have run around winter spring and un goro for hours and never even see a vein
---
I think at least part of this is due to the recent industry being dominated by class-based multiplayer games. You couldn't minmax Enemy Territory no matter how hard you tried.
---
I'd love LOVE to see Classic (then BC) updated with the current graphics and models of Retail.
---
He’d need to provide proof of this for it to hold any water.
---
Offhand as shaman for pvp kek. And have Malister's defender anyways.
---
Yeah its nice being able to see and interact the same people horde and alliance while out in the world or in town. Retail has lost server community feeling years ago and im finally getting it back now in Classic WoW.
---
Money is far more valuable while leveling, though. It's not particularly expensive and as a paladin he could get away with that, but for any other class that would be setting back the mount by a lot.
---
It doesn't matter if you buy the bars or mine them yourself, it's still time you spent mining the ore and gold you could've made selling it on AH.
---
Yeah like that bastard on the left hasn't been empty for 2 days...
---
Badass ;)
---
Keep on schizoposting bro
---
Orange man BAD!
---
Sure, if you can catch them low to the ground. But it makes getting out of wPVP trivially easy. It's just not the same.
---
I'm not saying flying ruined the game, TBC is my favourite xpac, but the amount of wPVP compared to Vanilla is laughable thanks to flying mounts.
---
&gt; Try to get your hands on Gatorbite Axe from Mara.
---
It's annoying, I can do Mara solo with my main yet I can't get that item to said main. 
---
Not sure if it's worth farming when I'm just three levels away from Ice Barbed Spear at that point.
---
Why is it a rock though?
---
Uh yea, Herod has some of the worst people, people that repeatedly play 18+ hours a day and post weeb shit to the server discord.
---
By proper I think he means a UI that displays more information for example elvui
---
See how unbalanced grobbulus is? Dead server, don’t reroll there!
---
The amount of gold he send you seems a bit lacklustered.
---
This thread became a gold mine for references  
---
Love you all!
---
The part the holding me back is my availability, my days off are never the same which has made it hard to find a good guild as I can never make it weekly. Just starting to think maybe classic isn’t for me cause rerolling and not having the level 60 benefits right away is going to be a pain as i was hoping to be on this server for a long time.
---
I would say combat daggers is likely the best spec. Cold blood hemo is the stunlock spec but it doesn't really work with daggers. The strength of daggers is the amount of burst they bring. If you're really trying to lock someone down you can use sinister strike as a cheaper alternative to backstab when building combo points and gouge is also great to buy time for some more energy ticks while still generating a combo point before a 5 point kidney.
---
It should work with any stackable item in your inventory.
---
Is there any level requirement?
---
It’s not really *by definition*. That is just not what ‘by definition’ means.
---
I'm using Bartender, it has no keyring symbol.
---
For any PvE speced class. I raid every week and I was hesitant to respec my Sacrifice/Ruin lock because I wanted to PvP. I don't need to now.
---
Fun is subjective. Who are you, I, or anyone else to tell people how they should be playing the game? Obnoxious post at best.
---
You can get enchants, which are quite powerful at a low level. To my knowledge, there is no minimum item level for enchants, so you could get Crusader on some low level weapon. If it's a white item (i.e. not soulbound), you can even use it on other alts, rent it out to friends, or sell it.
---
My troll rogue is lvl 25 and he's fishing around Ratchet every evening to send some clothes to a guildie tailor, blackmouths to an alchemist for FAPs, and actually having fun helping random players with quests around. You guys are missing something, the fun is around! Peace and love everyone.

Do I need to “use” a trinket or once it equips the effects should take place?

Unless it’s Minecraft.

I don't play this game. My buddy does though, and he loves this shit. He loves min maxing. He loves being a part of one of the top guilds. He loves spawn camping those randomly spawned bosses. That's just how some people play games. Idk the full extent of these issues OP is discussing, but do try to keep in mind some people like to be able to say they're the only person on the server with a non-tradeable pair of pants.
---
Don’t wanna sound toxic but have i just been getting unlucky with my pug groups then? Seems like every time I pug I spend at least an extra hour on wipes or people argue on specs etc.. i don’t find it hard to run a dungeon and do my part to help not wipe but some things have been out of my control sometimes. It’s frustrating.
---
Ah, Heart of Courage. Excellent choice!
---
Yes. You're useless and put in less effort than others.Thanks for realizing, maybe you can go play Hello Kitty Island Adventure now.
---
I see nothing wrong with using a guide if you think that would be a way you enjoy playing (some enjoy the exploration, and figuring out vague descriptions, others do not, both fine!). However, I do not think paying is the best option.
---
Consider using an addon such as GuideLime:
---
 [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/guidelime](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/guidelime)
---
i feel just like you except i'm investing and flipping.
---
Time spent mining the ore is negligible. You're doing it literally on the way from point A to point B and it takes 5-10 seconds per node. 
---
Gold is even more negligible. On my server, even iron ore/bars are vendor trash (they're really cheap on AH). And until he gets to mithril, he'll have a mount and no need to worry about money.
---
It depends on the trinket, eye if the beats for instance is a passive effect, but the Barov Peasant Caller is a use effect
---
You will.
---
You seem mad
---
Pre-mades are a perfect example of this. They only want to face pugs and never another pre-made. Yeah, it's more honor to stomp a pug, but wouldn't it be more of a fun challenge to face another pre-made?
---
A fucking men sir. Fuck level 60, I’ll get there when I get there! It’s my first fuckin time playing WoW and I’ll do it how I fuckin want to!
---
Elvui also says “dead” on the frames. Granted this is by default and may be able to be changed, but haven’t looked to confirm it can be.
---
Nice!!!
---
Man, OG Guild Wars was such a good game. I really miss it. Maybe it is a good time to give GW2 a second look...

You better farm your rep as a horde ASAP cuz ...

When ally will get their exalted rep ... queue for AV will be around 30-40 min ... for me it is already 8 min and yesterday it was 2 ....

Can BG be used to do cross-realm trading? Imagine there is a large price difference between realms on some item. Couldn't you make some profit?
---
I don't think university will change that
---
Cartman’s mom can help
---
You need her to catch you every once in a while so you can turn around and mind blast. You gotta time your shield 15 seconds before she gets to you so that weakened soul falls off for another shield. I also carry little health pots on me in case shot really goes south. The speed enchant is obviously a plus. And selling the ring is stupid good money too. You get tinkerer right?
---
Just FYI this isn't me it was a guildie who posted in the exchange in discord. He didn't give a port because he was in a dungeon group and was about to get summoned. I didn't expect this to start a controversy, I just thought it was funny.

Eventually you will have a 2nd raid group ready or a pug, don't worry about it

Which is exactly what she said. She is only saying that she wishes not to see the planet burn and people to die because of global warming.

That isn't politics. These are basic wishes. She literally said that it is up to the politicians to perform the politics for that to happen.
---
Understanding that the climate change is real is science, not politics. Accepting that it is going to kill millions if not billions is also not politics.

Try to at least come up with a criticism that she doesn't already flat out address herself.

Either way having mining or not does not make engineering any easier or harder to level. If iron bars are vendor trash, it would cost you nothing to buy them. Mining is just not a very good profession in mid levels since it takes more time than herbalism and gives no profits like you mentioned, while some mid level herbs can still be worth decent cash.
---
Ya, I pretty much could never make it into the Alliance base if both Dun towers were still packed with the NPC Archers.
---
...I also recall them being above lvl 60.
---
Oh well...would have been grand to have 'day long' AVs; would feel much more like an actual battle.
---
Every MMO or GaaS is now doomed thanks to the community in my opinion. Forums and subreddits are loaded with new posts about how the developer changed something and messed it up, or they haven’t changed something so it’s messed up, or complaining that a new free update makes didn’t do enough, or they need to add more of x y z. 
---
Every so often the developer will do something liked by the majority, but then if their next update isn’t good enough they riot again and bitch about the developer. 
---
You’re only as good as your last update and even then it only counts for like 3 weeks. 
---
If I was a studio I’d avoid these types of games only because of how toxic these players are
---
AV was not *this* bad on Kronos. I blame the community. It manages to be even worse than on private servers.
---
Blizzard could change this. But then people would have to actually play the game. We can’t have that.
---
She isn't. What's annoying you is to hear a feelbad truth. She is the illustration that people shoot the messenger, always.
---
My point is; as per this subreddit, people are complaining about they way the game is when they are trying to play how they want to, then passing the blame to Blizzard when they aren't having fun.  
---
It's tough to see who is at fault here, the new AV AFK issue seems to clearly land in Blizzard's ball park but if that's the issue stop trying to Min/Max with the Meta, run WSG or wPVP, start an alt, just stop complaining.  
---
I just can't honestly believe people are that naive to their own actions having an impact on the game...
---
Just tell them you're getting the flag for the quest
---
You can be reported AFK while waiting for rez in the graveyard, and you'll be kicked before you can re-engage in combat.  I think you can report AFK before the match even starts and the gates open.
---
&gt; Eh if you play Alliance on heartseeker you deserve to be bullied by Skeram imo

Eh if you play Horde on any server besides heartseeker you deserve to be bullied by heartseeker imo

I have the whole necrophile set too but for princess runs I always just stack spell power since I got it down. Since I have the gear and the mana I’d like to try lashers too. I don’t have herbalism though which makes both farms much worse... would you say lasher farm over Mara farm?
---
Fun is variable. It's different from person to person. But the fact is most people who play the game have fun maximizing their time. The minority of players that don't want to maximize time tend to get in the way of that and eventually alienated from the game.
---
my last one 58m haha
---
I hate those try hards joining rp servers for “easy time”.
---
Wow, literally that exact situation happened to me when I was a kid. I played a shitload of starcraft, beat my friends at it all the time, and then proceeded to get absolutely, mercilessly shit upon online until I couldn't handle it anymore.
---
Spell power increases the damage of your seals and judgements. About 12.5% on SoR, 20% on SoCom. The judgement is a 50% coefficient. I'm told.
---
Agreed.  I played some BGs, but as a holy priest I get wrecked.  Not much fun.  Hoping my alt can take over some duties at lvl 60 to give me something to do besides raid log.
---
I made a chat specifically for BG/raid. Not ideal, but my eyes dont get aids.
---
Ive mined 2 in  2 months.  RNG is neat.
---
the average player take 12 days to level up to 60. And definitely isn't full BIS+epic mount in 4 days as well. Especially when most of the players who raid since months don't have half of their BIS.
---
If you are one of those guy who just spammed dungeons with spellcleave groups and abusing sharding to level up like a madman then you just fooled yourself and the game is indeed not made with people like you in mind.
---
both my grid &amp; luf frames show feign as a regular death (are the proper frames?)

granted, you could probably setup an indicator for feign with grid, but 🤷‍♂️
---
Oh dear, I'm glad I stopped playing at WOTLK when the BG's were full of bots... that was a clear indication that Blizzard had stopped caring.  
---
Perhaps they should of offered us more accurate server choices:

Min/Maxers

Casuals  
---
RP'ers? :P

What is the reasoning between not letting parties que for AV? Me and a buddy que’d for WSG in a party.

It is the very best, if the circumstances allow it. Otherwise it will just hurt the group.

I’ve been twinking at the 29 bracket pretty constantly since Tuesday and I found bears mediocre.
---
Paladins seem to be the best for alliance and rogues for horde. Bonus points for having eng
---
I guess unlucky. If the tank is a bad player, it wont matter if they are specced for DPS or prot. The other way round, if they are skilled, they'll have issue tanking in a non-prot spec. Thing is, if you are not a guild's designated main- or off-tank, there is really no reason to spec prot. In raids, you will be asked to slap on a shield to tank the occasional add in some fights, but gear prio is usually on the few (2-3) tanks the guild has. So I don't think people tanking in off-spec is a thing that only happens on your server.
---
Lol you look like a fucking freak

I'm not saying that, I am merely suggesting if YOUR way of playing isn't fun because of X stop doing X.  
---
There are plenty of other ways to enjoy the game without killing it off as quick as possible with the Min/Max Meta.
---
They’re one and the same, they have been for longer than they have not.
---
Wrong. It comes down to how u pull them. You need to aggro both at the same time, i.e. with a body pull, else they tether. The 5set makes is easier to get them tethered from my experience, but it's not what causes it.
---
Totally inaccurate.

Full Resto as well! :D

Only sub that I've seen that isn't full of whiners is the one for monster Hunter world, they're shockingly helpful and supportive from top to bottom

Meanwhile shadowbros are farming 8 min Alterac Valley victories and pulling aggro from Drek’Thar.
---
Melt faces yeaaaaaah
---
Best part about twinking is that you only need to gear the character once; and it’s easier to gear than a 60.
---
If you like pvp and have a limited time to play, it’s faster to set up and be competitive on a twink than on a main.
---
Pretty much, only boss if you need a specific piece of gear
---
The servers have been open for months. This is a total b s statement .
---
Don Julio's Band is in the game.
---
Source: I have exalted rep.
---
i have also heard that this weekend will be av weekend
---
Well I started playing in late vanilla so AV has always been the exact same rush to the end that it is today, that's why I never played it. It's a terrible battleground in it's current state and that's not because the people are different now it's because the bg is poorly designed.
---
So if I want to get the gear I want I can either grind it out in 12 hours while chatting with my guildies as we all do the same thing or I can grind it out alone in 50 hours a month from now when everyone else has stopped queuing for AV because they are already exalted. At that point I spend the same amount of time in AV (probably more if the games take longer) but now I also spend just as much time sitting in a city doing nothing waiting for the q to pop. That sounds pretty unfun to me so I will get the grind done quickly then get back to what I want to be doing.
---
To use your jumping analogy, yeah maybe I would stand around and jump while watching netflix for a few hours if the gear was really good and there was no other comparable gear that was easier to get. But there are limits to everything. WSG rep gear is good but takes like 1000 games to get and high warlord gear is amazing but you need to be a complete slave to the game for months on end to get that. So in comparison a few hours in AV is really not that bad. It's up to you to decide what's worth it to you. For me AV is worth it, for your it's clearly not.
---
But let's not forget about the fact that a good chunk of this is Blizzard's fault. Maybe not all the modern dev teams fault since they are just implementing what was originally in the game but it's definitely the original dev teams fault. The honor system is complete garbage and the only way to "win" in it is to play more than anyone else. You can only do raids once a week so that puts a natural cap on the amount of work it takes to get geared. Sure you can spend hours grinding gold and mats to get the best consumables every week but that won't make you get gear any faster if you already have MC on farm like any serious guild does. But the honor system is literally just: have the most honor at the end of the week and get the most points for it. So maybe if the system was different where you could cap out the amount of rank points you get per week without playing 20 hours a day every day then people would actually play bgs for fun because it wouldn't be any faster to play the most efficient way 24/7. Unfortunately we are over a decade too late for that possibly so you live with what you got. 
---
My guild could probably do MC in under an hour and a half if we were super focused and skipped trash and stuff but we prefer to go a bit slower and shoot the shit between pulls and have fun taking silly group pictures so it takes us a little over two hours. But we still get our gear at the same weekly rate as the crazy people who clear MC in 45 minutes so there is not much incentive to go that fast. The honor system doesn't give you the option to go a bit slower and still get all the gear. Rank 14 won't take you 2 or 3 times longer if you play less hours, you will just never get there due to decay.
---
problem is the min/max av tactic gives way more honor than wsg premades
---
Just regular trashtalk, not much to worry about
---
No. Blame yourself.
---
That actually has nothing to do with common sense. Good one. You played yourself. Typed that from phone. Shit happens. Original post still applies. Thanks for stopping by.
---
Yes, but if you find yourself with some of it in your bags you can use your AV trinket and teleport quite close to the turn-in locations.
---
Theres AV daggers now that are good enough. And 20-25% crit is also good enough. I'd also recommend watching Pshero if you want a good rogue player to watch.
---
I had 1k rep lost match before (~25mins) with over 5k honor. I usually gets 350-400 from a quick lost match so it's no biggie.
---
Kudos to you, if I could then maybe I would too but I don't think I'd be complaining about it...  
---
That's a shame but at least the community in game seems stronger than on this Sub.
---
23 days total 13 at level 60
---
For Alterac Valley I think you have to be lvl 51 minimum. 
---
For warsong gulch I think there are brackets. 10-19, 20-29, 30-39,40-49, 50-59, and 60.
---
Or even if they do take a step back, have the feeling they have to do the thing they don't have fun with, or fall behind.
---
On top of all the other comments you will be able to farm Barb Blade from DM:T solo later so I would not recommend ice barbed spear. Just got blood seeker to tide me over until I get my ony sinew and it was a huge upgrade even from Heartseeking Xbow.
---
Although it used to be Snowfall that was supposed to remain untouched. Alliance would always cap that one, giving them a respawn that would not force them through the horde main zerg. Horde and Alliance would always get Stoneheart and Iceblood, respectively. With the Horde tunnel being much more forward and out of the way than the Alliance one, and Alliance having Snowfall, you'd make sure that both sides could actually return to the push forward after dying instead of being stuck in a turtle zerg. Horde capping Snowfall would inevitably end in an hour-long zerg on the Alliance bridge and was frowned upon for that reason. 
---
It's really just in Classic now that capping Iceblood or Stoneheart is also considered an issue, mostly because the BG goes down so fast that Snowfall takes too long to flag for Alliance.
---
The complaints about retail are the neverending ones. Infinite AP and titanforging. The only thing close to this is honor.
---
That\`s what happens when you get a game designed for the previous generations and delivered to snowflakes. Enough said.
---
So you can't use it to pull anymore?
---
i am down 30c
---
So you're not suggesting that 
---
&gt;  go at your own pace and enjoy it rather than feeling like you need to complete every single little thing.
---
Sounds fun?
---
This is how I feel about game community in general, especially ones where player vs other players. I just avoided them in general and now I avoid these games just because I hate ppl who are too proud and too serious.
---
Not anyone elses fault if you're so unlikable that no one in your guild will help you.
---
lol.
---
No. It was possible for a couple hours but they already hotfixed it.
---
Yeah. Or put differently: Because the goal is playing the battleground, not the rewards that require you to grind out many of them. In the former case you want it to last, in the latter you want it to be over.
---
not really
---
just had a 16 warrior 2 healer av. nothing got rushed that game. well they got to the last boss but forget to escort the healers with them
---
Finally an intelligent post in this subreddit
---
99% chance they’re right click-&gt;invite a name in a chat window, which takes about half a second.
---
In an interview about PoE, Chris Wilson said the same thing. No matter how hard they try to make certain elements fun, they will mostly be ignored as people aim to do nothing but farm as efficiently as possible. Even if that means ignoring 99% of the game, building a very specific way, and doing the same repetitive task for 10 straight hours.
---
If it helps, the WSG exalted epics aren't in the game yet.

"I remember the days before the wishing hat, when you were forced to try something new and go through with it, even if you didn't like it. It was a true test of character and skill, and we bonded in the hate for unwanted features. Now we only get everything we want. Where's the challenge? Blizzard really ruined my game experience with the wishing hat. Games used to be part fun, part terrible. Hating new features were some of the the happiest moments of my life. Now I just enjoy everything. Well, not anymore. If I keep being given everything I want, I'm going to vote with my wallet, and delete the game. Someone needs to take a stand."
---
As a resto/boomkin druid wanting to pvp, i can't seem to find any information on how much +spelldamage gear you want instead of +healing. I want to keep allies alive of course but i want to be able to hold my own kiting/nuking.
---
Can I farm the same amount of honor/rep per hour with my level 40 priest already or do I need to be level 60 for it to be efficient?
---
Yeah, pve seems to be where it's at.
---
It's definitely not worth a debuff slot. That said, it's most likely a very low tier debuff (if i understand correctly, all weapon procs are low tier debuffs) that can't knock off high tier debuffs (curses, faerie fire,..), so your guild might not even notice. Unless they use weapon proc debuffs that are useful, such as annihilator and nightfall. To clarify, the debuff "tier" system is the built-in system that the game uses (serpent sting can never knock off a sunder armor, for example). As far as i know, there isn't an official list will all debuffs and respective tiers. Luckely, the debuff tier system is quite good at prioritizing important debuffs, with some exceptions.
---
+Spell damage is trash for AoE leveling because the spell damage coefficient is really bad on all Mage AoE spells.
---
Having more intellect to cast an extra Blizzard or having more stamina to be able to pull larger is going to be infinitely more effective than making your Blizzard hit for a couple more damage; both while leveling and while AoE grinding for gold at max level.
---

Welcome to nostalgia lane,  where you get to experience why the WoW's experience declined over the years: it wasn't just Blizzard's mistakes,  it was as much if not more the community turning toxic. No amount of WoW classic will fix entitled assholes attitude.
---
I don't play wow, but if you changed some of the names to Zulrah, Dharoking, or Wilderness, you could post this on r/2007scape.  
---
It's just a small group of toxic people who ruin things for everyone else, and you'll see it anywhere you go.
---
I disagree I thought the original version of AV was pretty fun.  Games  could last for days.  It was epic.   But I also didn't care about honor or trying to  min/max.  I was just there to have fun and I did..
---
We are much more into organizing than we were back then. We live in a day of discord, streamers, and tons of games with in depth communication. WoW lacked a lot of that back in the day. We learn a lot faster now because of it. That being said we can watch the evolution of meta happen before our eyes. 
---
Just today the alliance rushing down AV on the west side of mid started getting camped every run by a small group, we organized going LEFT...(I know wild) and avoided it and won... we will see how long surprise left zerg works for. Or when Horde come fully loaded with sappers. 
---
The important thing is that people learn to keep their chin up and reorganize, it does require some leadership skills.
---
Beginning of time
---
Alliance wins 100% of the matches where both teams rush, just because of the layout of the bases. If you want to win as Horde, you must defend. Or you accept that you lose anyways, and try to gather as much bonus honor from secondary objectives, and that seems to be the consensus right now.
---
Honestly, it's not funny though. It just makes the mage look self absorbed. The guy in question asked a friendly question and got an abrupt response. If he didn't want to give a portal that's fine, but it takes all of 5seconds to say "sorry I'm a little busy right now".
---
It says far more about the mage than the person asking.
---
completely true grobb is such a shitty server.
---
Good points. I remember even back in Vanilla/TBC people were clamoring for something new, and there were regular threads on the forums saying the game was getting stale.

You cat use keyring if you have a bags add-on right ? (Bagnon for example)

That works until they threaten you with account closure because you open tickets or continuously escalate about the same thing.

Until they do though no harm in trying again

I would go with spell power in most cases. You will still be doing dots and occasionally shadowbolt.

Take my upvote, because it's tng.

No it was fun, but it was fun at the time. It was fun when we were discovering it.

You know you gotta mine for them right :P?

You should have rolled a horde rogue then.  Redridge ganking is the best!

Alright, I'm no mage player. But it seemed to make sense to me. But now that you describe it like this I can see how Stam and Int could indeed be more usefull.

I’m super familiar with classic wows set up and even I use a guide from time to time. I don’t use add ons but I do consult nightfalls guide on my phone while playing on Warcraft tavern to give me some general direction and ideas on where to go and the order to do things. This was probably my 4th level 60 in the vanilla world and to this day I still discover quests and stuff I didn’t know where there.
---
why is my mom here
---
Are they away from keyboard? Are they playing? If they’re not away from keyboard and doing something, they’re not afk. If they run around circles in spawn? Sure. Afk vote.
---
Here's a crazy idea: have fun while min/maxing!
---
Fun isn't mutually exclusive with productivity. We farmed SGC for our GM for like 90 runs. He never got it. A couple of weeks ago, one guy wanted to farm it on his alt and I wanted to lvl my fresh Broken Tooth, and he got it on the 6th run.
---
That was a super fun night. Everyone laughing, people getting fake-salty (not real salt, but you know they're a bit jealous).
---
Fun can be had while min/maxing with the right people. Look for the right people.

---
Here's one of the buffs, sadly WoWhead doesn't list what patch NPC buffs were added in. According to the only comment posted during patch 3.3.3 Wrath of the Lich King:
---
&gt; From a hotfix, this buff now:  
---
&gt;\- Grants -10% enemy dodge  
---
\- Increases hitpoints by 30%  
---
\- Increases damage done by 40%  
---
&gt;This is up from 25% increased health and damage. The auras still stack, so having all 4 towers up will negate 40% of the tanks dodge rating. 
---
Sadly i'm not finding a ton more information that has numbers to really go off of. Definitely not saying you're wrong, just that it might not be worth raging over this without hard facts. I WANT this to be fixed, I want AV to last ages, but if we want to convince blizz to fix it we need proof
---
Golden Pearl Stats:
---
1st Session farming about 2-3 hours, on the 50th clam, I got a Golden Pearl.  The next one I got 6 clams later.
---
2nd Session farming 3 hours: 0 pearls, over 50 clams opened.
---
3rd Session farming 2 hours: 1 Golden Pearl, got relatively quickly did not keep track this time (I saved the clam meat earlier to level cooking, but I got it to 300 with all the clam meat, so I ditched it for vendor junk lol.
---
I bought the last one off the AH. (I'm not holy disc, but I'm tri spec pvp, so I'm good at nothing but messing with casters in PvP).
---
I have 2 orbs now, we'll see if I want to buy the last two orbs or just just run some strats for it, less concerned with that because we know where they drop and you usually see at least 1 a run.
---
Was more concerned about pearls because they are so random.
---
Heal in BGs! Everyone will love you
---
There are definitely more power players in the game then before. My best guess is: 99% of people sucked during vanilla and now they want to relive vanilla, but without the sucking part.

Not really. Ranged weapon is one of the best places to get +hit. It opens your item choices to stuff like Omokk's girdle instead of Brigham or Vambraces of the Sadist instead of Battleborn's.

I'm perfectly happy, haven't had to deal with any 'le epic gamers' that seem to infest the PvP servers as well as to some degree this subreddit, haven't had to deal with anyone on the spectrum yelling at me, pretty similar experience to what I got 15 years ago too.

Yesterday one of our mages accidentally teleported instead of making a portal... I shouldn't have laughed at him so hard, because like 2-3 avs later I accidentally clicked the port :(

I didn't want so many servers and layering during launch.

I don't want so many servers and layering now.

Just pick one randomly and let the dice decide.

Don't pick Paladin or Shaman unless you REALLY want to heal, that leaves seven classes. For instance:

Warrior 1-2

Priest 3-4
---
Hunter 5
---
Warlock 6
---
Mage 7
---
Rogue 8
---
Druid 9
---
//random 1-9

And you have your answer.

Nah fam, you're wrong.
---
Disc priest bis PvE/PvP spec
---
You need to find a group.  Your team is supposed to protect you
---
Yeah but as a 52 priest, I couldn't even play more than 5-10 minutes at a time without getting ganked in Un'Goro. I played 3 hours straight yesterday and only got ganked once. All other 48-55 horde left me alone as well, because they probably had the same mentality as I did - they just wanna level in relative peace.
---
No one minds getting ganked once in a while, but Phase 2 was total shit for those of us in the 45-55 level range
---
The main takeaway \~\~I’ve learned from this sub\~\~ is that \~\~no matter the state of the game,\~\~ people always bitch.
---
bro im level 15 bro just enjoy the game bro i have 17 kids at home and i have no arms or legs bro, my life is a waking nightmare bro but at least i got this cool screenshot of Mulgore bro here read this 75 paragraph post about it
---
Disc is better than deep holy for both pve and pvp. If you don’t want to run power infusion then you can still run 26/25/0 disc/holy so you can get the +10% mana talent without giving up Spiritual Guidance. Spiritual Healing doesn’t scale with gear so while it’s not completely useless now, it’ll become absolute trash once you start getting more gear.
---
Oh fair enough, good luck :D

Nope

Classic Community is cancer, your examples show it.

&gt; The issue is that some min/maxers are trying to force their min/max meta™ onto other people who are just trying to kick back and have fun
---
You mean like all the people crying "MINMAXER! MINMAXER!!!! OH MY GOD JUST PLAY THE GAME AND HAVE FUN" at everyone they disagree with, trying to force their Ret Paladin meta onto other people?
---
I'm not sure exactly what it was, if it was increased objective honor, greater disparity between points and rep for win\loss, out something like higher hp\lower damage for NPCs, but they could change it back to how it was waaaaay back.  I'm not sure they should.  Maybe people just figured out always a race is best for winners and losers alike.  
---
Make a premade of 5-10, wipe them on boss with no grave.  The world only makes sense when you force it.
---
&gt; It's definitely min/maxing my time but I'm having fun doing it.
---
Hey man, don't worry about me I'm having a blast. Min/maxing parts of WoW **is** fun to me.
---
You can check my post history, I'm the same as you. Let people do what they want and have fun - it's not impacting my gametime.

Should have rolled Dwarf to get a little thicker skin.

One AV started, and one guy said in raid warning "All rush Drek! No graveyards!" followed by someone saying "calm down dude, it's a premade." The premade wiped 6 minutes later and they all left at once. I laughed my ass off.
---
A bit later I was in one with a LOT of players from Faerlina. It confirmed to me that the streamer server is full of zoomer twats. They *literally* said "ok boomer" in response to anyone offering strategy or criticism.
---
In short, sorry people on Faerlina. I hate your server and pity anyone that has to play in that environment.
---
If you're using swords and are specced combat you should have sword specialization, not daggers. Sword Specialization is actually insane damage, especially over longer fights. That one talent is the whole reason Combat Swords is considered the "best" raiding spec (well, and Adrenaline Rush is an insanely powerful cd).
---
Take a look at the two builds i linked, though. They look interesting as hybrid builds. They will certainly not perform as well in a pure pvp situation, or a pure pve situation, as non-hybrid builds, but they look like a decent compromise to me.
---
*jinxing*, seriously?
---
Service fragmentation has gone too far in all kinds of streaming. It's stupid.
---
I absolutely disagree with your thesis that it's an adult Vs child thing - tat adults can't do something without incentive. I'm playing WoW absolutely for fun. Even the supposed incentives of the game are not themselves tangible items. The moment the game is turned off the honor I have, or amount of epics I have doesn't impact my life in any way. The only purpose for playing WoW is a sense of enjoyment. The in game rewards can contribute to your fun, but if you're playing the game for the incentives, not the fun, then step back and realise none of this has any value unless you're enjoying it.
---
If as a ten year old you could have fun "just playing" but as an adult there has to be a "reason" to play, then stop and think about how flimsy that reason is. It's just pixels in the screen. At the end of the day we are just playing, that's all any of us are doing the unhealthy behaviour I see comes from thinking that isn't enough.
---
I have been, and will until the event is over in a few weeks. 
---
Then back to the good version of WoW ;)
---
&gt; Just thought I'd ~~break up the monotomy of this whinging subreddit.~~  post one of the most frequently posted things on this subreddit even though it has no value or substance whatsoever
---
ftfy
---
You just need to stay with the majority
---
I call those people, elitists. I farm AV for rep but sometimes when I feel for killing a few people alone, I do that. I catch some people off guard and waste the enemies time to help my team win. I'm almost always the only guy defending the capped graveyards to help my team spawn further up the map. 9/10 times when I leave them open some rogue just caps it back and its lost. Yesterday I followed one lonely lvl 57 to the mines to help him out, we had a chat, killed some rats and had fun. Good post my dude
---
lmao this is amazing.
---
This is the shitpost we needed this morning on this dying subreddit.
---
I hope you realize that this mainly stems from the problem that there is nothing to explore. Nothing new, nothing exciting. The only "content" left is player interaction. And in this area, "competition" is what interests most people. Which is nothing new btw. people always compete with each other, be it, friends, in sport, people in school, etc. etc. every topic will eventually be an "I did X better than you".     
---
Classic's giant problem is that everything has been beaten to death and is known. Even now, just being in P2 you KNOW what gear you will wear in 2 years during Naxx. You know it EXACTLY. No mystery, nothing to explore, nothing to learn.     
---
This "can we just ignore this min/maxing and play like we used to" (back in 2004-2006 where it wasn't "as heavy" with min-maxing) is simply wishful bullshit. If you truly want a classic "experience" you would have to play a game where even with Datamining no one knows what's hidden in the game and a system where you can't theorycraft your stats/gear.    
---
But you won't be able to achieve this, partly because people don't want to be left out. I'd say we will never see something similar to classic for multiple reasons. Except for maybe the first few weeks of new content releases.
---
I just worry that I'll miss the rush to farm it, and be stuck with a much more grueling grind to exalted due to work+family :(
---
Hit honored last night, but that is still a long way to go.
---
I’m loving Classic.
---
You´re free to minmax in AV all you want, just dont expect me to join in.
---
You dont need to take a ret paladin in to your raids, if you´re in a minmaxing group it wont be an issue anyway.
---
Karazhan as the 20 man equivalent to Naxx in difficulty. A way to cleanse the corrupted Ashbringer to create Ashbringer Legendary. A new raid above Naxx with T4 gear (other then the TBC T4 gear) Maybe introduce an extra battleground. So many great things are possible.
---
AV epics will quickly become outdated.
---
Wait until more raids start to come out. You will see a huge difference in gear between raided and non raiders
---
Tier one main pieces (5pc crit maybe) and damage off pieces. The int and Stam will probably matter most.
---
i see nobody bought your stuff on the AH and you opened the mailbox
---
If you want rank 10, would wsg be enough?
---
But these were legitimate complaints that Blizzard addresses with fixes....
---
Horde took away the rain on my server
---
That's when I quit raiding when Cataclysm came out.  Server first 80 hunter in Wrath, realm first in literally every raid that expac, as well as hard mode raiding.  It turned into a second job, and when my IRL friends were out at parties or the bar, meeting women or whatever, I was home every night from 6:30-11:00 for raids.
---
Eventually my FOMO for real life beat out my FOMO for WoW, and I  quit raiding.  Still with the same guildmates I've been with since 2005, but I don't raid.  I go nuts at the beginning of the xpac, because pulling an all nighter on launch day is still exciting as fuck, even as a 34 year old.  But aside from that I just level alts and do pet battles now.
---
Wait, don’t you have to be honored to be able to summon him?? In less than 2 days? Wow...
---
How? Half our raid went afk because the bg lwad did it, is there a way to call a vote kick?
---
You can collect Blood vials (forgot their name) and turn them in in a cave next to a blacksmith as a horde.  
---
If you collect 250 (I think) the quest giver will ride with you to the middle of the map and begin summoning ritual. If I recall it correctly you'll need 5 players to summon it there.  
---
It starts as a small elemental and it grows with every player it kills.
---
Considering the experiences I've already had with Faerlina, there's a good chance he meant it, then passed out due to too high an intake of Bang energy before he could finish his comment with "ok boomer"
---
They announce it when they’re doing it. As soon as they get their guy in, they say stuff like “yay, it worked, you got in”.
---
My thoughts exactly. I play this game casual but each day I feel like my Classic adventures are coming to an end :*(
---
Weapon procs have the lowest priority on Debuffs, they will get knocked off by almost anything else. So no need to worry about debuff slots.
---
For solo levelling, the best specs are combat swords. More specifically, the specs make use of Riposte (spec 5% parry then 1/1 riposte). The reason being is that, at 10% parry chance, you proc Riposte a lot and it only costs 10 energy while doing a lot of damage. This obviously has no application in dungeons or raids, but for pure solo levelling it is crucial in order to keep up with classes that are much better at levelling.
---
Then that's nice! Keep doing what is fun for you and enjoy this journey!
---
You forgot the bathroom...
---
Strongest? Or just benefitting the most from the AV?
---
Well that is an average of 5 hours per day in the 100 days since release
---
Yeah I mean everybody knows the best thing to do with your mistress is to make her sit there and watch you play WoW
---
Winterspring. I only do mining runs early mornings when im off works or gotten home from night shifts. Would never try during peak hours.
---
&gt; Pve loser, learn to pvp...
---
Imagine the level of neckbeard you have to reach to call people losers for not wanting to play a video game the way you want to play it. Giant yikes.
---
Report everyone. We should all just make everyone go AFK so they can see the flaw in their system.
---
One known toxic person leading the toxic premade = server is toxic, interesting
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/520459513
---
Shit quality but hope it helps.
---
Actually... a family member can hold the poty while playing.
---
Last night on Herod I pugged with &lt;Hive&gt; and both bindings as well as the Eye dropped!  
---
Those boyos got the famed trifecta!!
---
you forgot "nothing personnel, kid"
---
Actually really impressive
---
As someone who predicted every single problem with Classic WOW. I'm happy as a pig in shit watching people flip out.
---
Except some never got sick of it. They *wanted* the drawn out battle. Just like in current AV, things other than winning gave you reputation. And to be a part of a push that finally broke the other side and take down the General... you felt powerful. You felt like a member of an army that was triumphant that day.  
---
AV wasn't for people who wanted honor, AV was for people who wanted the battle.
---
Honestly he's not that powerful in Classic if you form a small group and attack him early, he gets more powerful whenever he kills someone. He was buffed in later expansions and now starts off pretty powerful, and in BFA he isn't a very rare sight. I summoned this guy just yesterday in AV on Classic but a few alliance rolled over and smacked him down :(
---
Played an hour one last night then a 30 min wsg.
---
Reddit is just an echo chamber filled with whiny bitches, the rest are busy playing
---
My favorite use of baby yoda yet lmao
---
Yeah. The earliest I have got on is around 8:30 am server and it’s full up then. I move back to night shift soon so I’ll try in the wee hours after work. Cheers!
---
Fuck this baby Yoda shit. It's just advertising.
---
The rush to farm hasn’t even started. Wait for the weekend and it only takes half as long.
---
who needs heals when you're horde
---
Classic players are modern WOW players who are swayed by veterans waxing nostalgic about the old times.
---
Sounds like you are old enough to understand that gamer bitch and moan in every gaming community about everything. There is no escaping it.
---
Also it's super funny that you are trying to play the generation card. The post I linked you was a well written argument from the side opposing yours. You can stay close minded and not try to learn anything or you can try to understand that
---
EVERYONE WILL PLAY THE GAME HOW THEY WANT TO AND YOU CANT FORCE ANYONE TO PLAY A GAME HOW YOU WANT THEM TO.
---
Did you even read the parts about multiple playthroughs and how a lot of the people min/maxing are doing so because they have already played the game the way you are playing it now. They already went through the noob phase and are at the point with wow where the fun for them is in min/maxing and rushing and trying to optimize everything.
---
Really sounds like you read the first paragraph or two, saw "fallout" and said "this cant possibly relate cuz it's not online". Its not like they are both massive open world RPGs or anything.....
---
One final thing. Ok boomer
---
The thing is i dont know where i need to quest or till what level i can quest in that particular area.. It feels like you need to hob so much? And also seen People who say that you can grind from 36-40?
---
I mean... yeah, if you just wanna use your money to make money that works fine. 
---
It just feels more reliable to me personally, based on the normal non-peak prices to actually craft the potions. But it may just be subjective I guess.
---
Oh neat, now I can use the eye to scout and not pull the whole dungeon!
---
I'm in the same boat, even tho 10m AVs ain't fun, it's still super efficient for the items and I'm feeling the FOMO.
---
Just a Star Wars quote, my man.
---
51? You better be farming ST/BRD for full pre-BIS. Also, do your attunements, have your epic mount, and full consumeables (to include flasks) because you're attending raid tomorrow night. Also, quit your job and don't sleep so you can hit 60. 
---
If these ~~demands~~ requirements aren't met, you're getting gkicked, black listed, removed from the discord, and not invited to my birthday party.
---
Zygor's is dogshit, they admit themselves on their own forums that it's not intended for getting to 60 as fast as possible. In which case you wonder why they'd even put out a guide in the first place. Honestly, just installing questie and using some common sense is far quicker than Zygor.
---
Shadow priests might want to grind it earlier preparing for  Lok'amir.
---
"""" except ambush """"
---
Is a dagger sub rogue can use 3 ambushes in a fight and a pair of cb eviscerates that's really good damage for even a 2 minute fight (which most of the front 8 in MC are).
---
Sub rogues with a really good slow 1h like teebu's or even with good top end like vis'kags is ganna do a ton of white damage with WF weapon. It won't beat a vbat rogues damage especially with snd but due to hemos non-normalized AP, with raid buffs and either orc or troll racial they can break 450-500 dps, which is enough to honestly clear up to bwl, zg, and aq20.  Hemo depends extremely heavily on getting enough +hit to yellow cap and obscene amounts of raw AP through buffs and consumables. If you get all 3 ( hit% softcap, ludicrous AP for rogues, and WF + slow main) its possible to perform well.
---
However, this is the same argument for any hybrid spec (except paladins) to do good raid pve dps. And if you cared that much about good raid pve dps, you'd respec to combat assa to optimize your raid pve dps in the first place...
---
Maybe because it's a different game?
---
You do realize that you are essentially saying "Oh man, I looove Battlefield but I can't stand CoD, why is that? They are both FPS!" 
---
Modern wow and classic wow only share a name and a genre. They couldn't be more different.
---
I know.
---
People don't realize hitting revered is less than halfway...
---
Pro tip for running to DM:East: 
---
Fly to thalanaar or camp mojache. 
---
Run to back door DM:east(the one by Pusilin boss). Get naked.  
---
Die (Half of the time there will be a ghost mushroom in the area, if so, fear mobs,herb, then die). 
---
Run back to front door DM:east
---
Profit.
---
A lot of people are exalted already
---
Really? Cuz I'm gonna play this game exactly how I enjoy it. Arnt you? Isn't everyone?
---
Sure sounds like he just wants people to not be so hardcore and min/max everything. Guess what? That's the fun of wow for a lot of people.
---
Unless the game goes long, you won't see the turtle breakers like Lok and the air force.
---
You understand that the real police 99% only exists because of that right?
---
Oh, I see. Yeah that defo wouldn't work then. Though you could always just click the name when it pops into Spy to target it. No guarantee you'd actually locate that way though.
---
Yeah it's so boring getting to kill Alliance while my team farms me more honor and I get solo kills, bring back BRM camp where I compete with 15 other players for one Alliance level 52 every 20 minutes.
---
How am I addicted ? Scrolling on reddit sometimes making me addicted? Okey thats some strange view you have there. Did I hurt your feeling by calling you a nerd because you know its the truth ? Stopped trying to lose your virginity cause you cant talk to girls :(? Dont worry mate, internet games is your cure for that!
---
JokerD, why is his name so fitting?
---
AV is a battleground. So more like nothing about pve.
---
Everyone I don't like is a pserver player!!!
---
/u/synli
---
LMAO totally you
---
If you are not really after speed then I do not see the benefit of a guide at all. If you just can be doing with not finding quests or not knowing where to go I think the add-on Questie may be your solution.
---
I’m on herod. Alliance are dominating AV.  Last night it was 4:1  win-loss.
---
It really depends on your premade size too, if you don't have enough players, then a stream of respawns at iceblood will ruin your day when you pull all the lieutenants there + that french dude on the tower.
---
5 minute game. Glorious
---
If yall put half the effort you put into this game into your lives the world be an entirely different place
---
lobo and gutgore are low prio debuffs
---
 
---
they get knocked off by everything, and wont knock off anything important. go ahead and use them
---
Which turtles do you kill?
---
Well to be fair here, that tank in Olympus that was win trading was banned and Asmons reaction was “good, he deserved it”
---
He is obviously not reading your posts and thinks you're claiming 4d played from character creation to 60 prebis.
---
It's your problem. I'm more important than you, because I'm a tank and you're DPS. You either adapt or will be replaced.
---
Go queue for warsong then.
---
That's not relevant to my point at all, we're talking honor and how much time you spend playing. Even if people make more honor now the brackets will be the same in relation to time invested  (mostly) so not much will change on that part.
---
This is so much bullshit. Retail WoW exists because the devs decided they wanted to reinvent the wheel every single expansion.
---
What gets me is that 90% of the things people complain about have been fixed on retail. I still play both and still have fun on both. I haven't experienced much toxicity, but it's almost like people expect it at this point. My main is only lvl 38. I was making a group for SM. A guy whispered me asking if we would take a boomkin. Like he's getting denied groups at lvl 30-40 because he's not playing an optimal spec. I told him no problem as long as you have plenty of water lol. It's getting to the point where I try to avoid grouping with mages because they want to rush rush aoe everything. I'd rather play the game as it was intended.
---
Honor =/= faction rep
---
Faction rep comes from quests, AV battle mark hand ins, killing Galvangar/Belinda before the other faction does, winning the game, capturing objectives, etc.
---
I joined an AV round yesterday that had 15 warriors, 14 hunters, one priest, one Druid. We lost badly.
---
His name has "1337" in it.
---
Clearly he is more "1337" than us, and we should listen to him.
---
Anyway, I signed up to play classic to play WSG. It's everything that I remembered. I'm sitting here now with Popcorn watching everyone complaining about AV. (I also pointedly hit 60 prior to Phase 2, because I knew it would be a shit show, just not to the extent that it was).  
---
This reddit has been absolutely ridiculous with the amount of people feeling like they need to prove you wrong. Like the first day of BGS was people making posts about how "LOL NO QUEUES DUMB ALLIANCE" and prior to that it was "LOL THERE WILL STILL BE DEATH BALLS, BGS WONT CHANGE ANYTHING" anytime anyone posted a rational argument it was instantly swarmed by negativity. 
---
Just be comforted that there are some chill people still playing, and I'm sure a majority of them don't use reddit.
---
We need to collectively stop posting this.... I know everyone is frustrated by it but you're honestly planting the seed in everyone's mind.  The "hey if everyone is doing it I might as well too" mentality is taking hold...
---
&gt; in life as well, they *have to* just hide it
---
Otherwise there are consequences. Not on the net, though. It's the lack of negative feedback they get.
---
There is satisfaction to be had from enduring hardships and frustration, if the reward is sweet enough.
---
Our physical dps are low key expected to get atleast the AV ring for phase 3 in our raiding guild. I dont mind though. As a well geared alliance hunter, its all very relaxing for me.
---
Survivability is not about healer mana. It's about getting gibbed in a burst damage. If healer does not have enough mana, he's playing wrong and should fix his problems.
---
Monkey see monkey do twitch culture
---
As far as I’m aware, yes. Your +healing from gear and effects gets added after the boost from spiritual healing
---
I come to game subreddits to discuss the game and fuck right off when it inevitably devolves into low effort memes and about a millionth post of the cake you made, your cosplay or yet another art piece.
---
So hell even on this count there's two sides to the coin.
---
Absolutely. My fun is the only reason I'm playing this game.
---
Yeah man, you sure arent emotional about anything rofl. Wtf is "stanning"? Anyways, I guess we are not going anywhere, I hope you find the help you need dude. 😂
---
So much for multitasking
---
Thank god the ring isn't BiS for rogues, I don't have to set foot in a BG.
---
Remember, you’re not allowed to criticise the groupthink - I’m sorry, ‘scientific consensus’ :D
---
Vanilla had much less timegating, even Pre-Raid.
---
Classic Phase 1 and Phase 3 will have MC + Onyxias Lair or BWL and Onyxias Lair. Two current content raids for more raiding and more Loot. Phase 4 will add ZG for more Loot and phase 5 has 2 Raids and Phase 6 adds Naxxramas with 4 wings to progress through.
---
In Modern WoW you have 1 linear current content raid so only 1 lockout to get your difficulties loot.
---
Overall this is more raiding, more chances for loot than Modern WoW.
---
In Classic Dungeon gear took longer to farm, but wasn’t artificially gated by Blizzard. Azerite gear and some Essences are artificially timegated. M+ is a good system for loot though.
---
In Classic Reputations gave you profession recipes and professions weren’t entirely useless giving you another non artificially gated by blizzard way to progress.
---
Professions in Classic have always been their strongest point offering a variety of utility based items that stay relevant the entire game, Legendary items and Raid/Pre-Raid BiS items such as Robe of Archmage and Truefaith Vestments.
---
Professions in Modern WoW have been neutered to almost total irrelevance in the utility and gear progression since after Mists of Pandaria.
---
Classic has more farmable BoE epics that aren’t artificially gated by Blizzard such as the Freezing Band.
---
I agree with this. I was talking to a friend I used to play with the other day and we basically had a conversation where I realized I didn't even fully understand how the decay honor system fully worked. I was just recklessly doing BGs cause they were fun. Even turtle matches defending that bridge and (as a rogue) trying to sneak past to recap towers to pull horde away from the bridge. It was just fun. I can see how that's rose tinted glasses because then I was naive and now I know that I should be looking to farm honor. 
---
That being said, then and now, my expectations are not to get r14 or anything like that. I didn't have time then and I sure as hell don't have time now. So the goal has always been to just queue for BGs to PvP, get some PvP rewards along the way, and have some fun.
---
Herbing again...mmmmm.  Its like a god damn ghost town out there.
---
I'm a HotW/NS 60 Druid with a bank full of old gear I've upgraded over time and essentially don't use any more. 
---
Mainly stuff with high raw stats but lower + healing which is my focus as a healer. And I keep my tank/dps set in my bag with me.
---
Should i look to keep anything particular for future content / phases, like certain resistances or stuff that would help with longer fights? 
---
I'm mostly just an in-game hoarder and need someone to tell me it's okay to vendor my stuff haha.
---
thanks for #NOCHANGES, bois! Horde racials are so much better and the class balance is so screwed that you usually see barely any paladins or druids on AV. But a shitton of *war*s, *rog*s  and *mag*s
---
Its a "subconscious process" you "don't think about", but I'm the vapid one.
---
Harping on spelling and admitting to abusing right click reporting lmao
---
That wasnt remotely the point. 
---
Before mop, people were annoyed that there was such a low daily limit. Then pissed in mop because there were so many.
---
Awesome, i appreciate the replies!
---
You can do it if you want. But I predict you'll get reported for AFK and kicked pretty quickly.
---
Also given that most AV are sub 15minute, that's not a lot of time to fish. Remind me, does AV have particularly interesting fish?
---
Just see if they have buffs still. Propper dead hunters lose their buffs.
---
Almost every single change made over the years was their attempt at addressing complaints.
---
I could hide everything except chat and grid I suppose.  
---
But that one time I need shackle, I will be fucked.
---
I see you mean now. Yeah for what it's worth your current build is basically a mini version of what i use for raiding. 
---
I love playing a Rogue, but I've found the pure pve builds to be a little boring compared to the pvp builds. 
---
The one build I've raided in that i find to be the most fun is Seal Fate Daggers, but you really need like 35% crit for it to work. It can be used in PvP as well, although not as effectively as something like Hemo/Cold Blood.
---
Ah ok. I thought they could make changes. My bad. well this was way way more optimistic from the community than I thought. lmao.
---
People stopped wanting to have fun when everything became about showing how leet you were and how much better than everyone else you were.
---
Change in mentality is the main issue here.
---
My guild complains about this version nonstop but I’ve played the PServer AV and it’s a dumpster fire. Bugs aside, it’s a horrible experience you want to try maybe once.
---
2 hunters/Mages can turtle the AV as long as they want. NPCs are so strong as long as they CC anyone near them your entire raid gets deleted. Archers kill you in 3 hits and at least 3 archers are in range of you at a time so you get globalled constantly. Mines. Oh my god the mines. Walk slightly off the road? Boom. Literally invisible mines that KO you or take 80% HP. 
---
Trying to get through that garbage when you’re just trying to get rep is maddening.
---
Should Blizzard have done the old version of AV? Probably, just so people see how horrible it was and stay loyal to vanilla. Do I want old AV? Hell no
---
You need to have Improved Backstab if you're using Daggers.
---
Evolution doesnt kick in after some generations of safety. Thats not how evolution works.
---
You can easily get rank 1 in WSG or in world pvp. It's just 15 honor kills.
---
that's my jam
---
That's some major projecting. There's a healthy portion of the playerbase that was and had been playing vanilla WoW for years, up until days before classic launched.
---
Really people asked for BfA systems? What did the AP system fix?
---
In practice I'm doing fine. It's enough to shout once at misbehaving DPS and everything stars going smooth. Very rarely I have to kick bad DPS.
---
One of the reasons may be because I never invite warriors, mages or rogues, unless they are my friends. Most of those guys are terrible players, they have no idea how to manage threat. Get few hybrids and get rolling.
---
In later expansions he starts out larger, but in Classic when he spawns he's pretty weak and small until he kills a few, so you have to babysit him for a while. Takes 10 minutes of him standing here before he goes towards the ally base
---
If you’re just turning 60 I wouldn’t recommend this spec until you get 400+ plus healing (and I’m at work and can’t figure out how to link it). I did the deep holy/disc with spiritual guidance because it really helps compensate any lack of gear. I’ll holler back when I get home hopefully about both specs.
---
“I know” 
---
- Han Solo
---
You didn't read this did you?
---
He was talking about the opposite and how why people are doing this.
---
He might have been one of the first lvl 60s
---
JoJo's Bizzare Adventure. The rock has an electrical outlet on it. You'll get magnetized if you touch it and eventually die from random metal objects flying at you.
---
Someone just slapped the Wow logo on it.
---
And you get to exalted within less than 48h of doing this? I feel so far behind the curve compared to the no lifers. Think I’ll look for a different game
---
You used to not really be able to stand that far away without being ganked by a rogue.
---
I mean even if he did have an aura like that nobody would get the ranks from the honor until tuesday ;)
---
Oh wow.. 40 minutes of AV now? I remember watching my friend play before we went to school and then after school ended (6-7 hours) he'd queue up and was still in the same AV.
---
I waited literally half of my lifetime on earth for this game. 
---
I cancelled my sub a couple of weeks ago, sitting at lvl 58 in IF, with a no thanks facial expression when looking at the WoW icon on my desktop. 
---
It’s still the same game. 
---
It’s just not the same people. It’s fine to say goodbye.
---
My toons name is Urizen so I did a double take there, but I'm on stalagg
---
Who?
---
Lol I guess. It's do obvious that people aren't allowed to have an opinion on something or someone.  Honestly, she comes from a rich family that has a massive carbon footprint.. so she's taken some sailing trips...that saves the world?  I'd love to see her sail to Walmart...
---
Too each his own though 😁
---
Nah *he* isn’t
---
Yes the Horde kill Balinda and the lieutenants and maybe hit the towers if there’s time. 1/4 games or so you’ll actually win too. Horde have done some turtles that have worked. The rep doesn’t seem as fast as ally but I have a full timer job and raided Tuesday night and still hit reversed.
---
Also in it for flower power :P
---
&gt; Expose armor prevents warriors from using sunder if the expose armor reduces the mobs armor by a larger value, so I'm ganna go ahead an not do that.
---
Naturally you have decent a fury tank in the front line.
---
Comparing something that takes what, about 10 secs(?) with something that could easily take 2 hours depending on the group.
---
Just pay for the rune and the mage should stfu.
---
It's definitely not just people who haven't played WoW before that prefer Classic
---
That's something people forget.  All the "bad" things added to retail were added because they were shit in the old days.  They went too far, but everything was added for good reason and Classic is showing *why* those things were added.
---
Anyone who refuses to take a certain spec &lt; 60 is an idiot (and often at 60 too depending on content) who doesn't actually understand and is just parroting "durr boomkin r bad" nonsense from the cancerous min/maxers who ruin everything they touch.
---
Current incarnation of AV is almost entirely PvE, tho, lol
---
I actually liked the farmers stuff. I suck at the end game stuff(I just worked up the nerve to do m+ last week) and I just had fun relaxing and taking care of my place. But damm there were a looooooooot of tiller dailies, yall
---
Same... lost roll 2 times already (we don't do DKP in our guild)... it hurts :/
---
You're not playing priest are you? Cuse priest have a much more versatile set than just 2 ranks of 1 healing spell.
---
There is one glaring issue with this approach though, and that is that with such a smooth power curve it makes the game much less exciting and much less of an experience imo. For example, when you're level 11 and you manage to kill a level 14 it feels like you've achieved something, similarly, if you come into a zone a bit higher you get to steamroll through it.   
---
I think it's this change of pace which really helps with the feel of the game and it's something that the level scaling overlooks. However in retail WoW it's actually double bad because due to the various stat squishes, heirlooms, and the high level cap, your characters power is also very smooth - and for me this makes leveling an extremely beige experience. I understand that some players want to finish the storyline of the zone, but maybe the scaling could be implemented a bit better/differently in order to help with the monotony.
---
Still do.
---
r/Rimworld is a beautiful sub. Full of low quality shitposts right next to awesome comics and fan art and everything in between. There are some “min maxy” type posts (How to Build best X type of base), but most of the time it’s just people loving the game and sharing their experiences. They actually seem to get some kind of sick pleasure from getting screwed over by the game lol.
---
How you can fail to see this wasn't targeting his arguement, I have no idea.
---
I was honestly thinking about jumping to retail yesterday. Seems like Classic is a lightning rod for a lot of the worst elements in the community.
---
if someone caps stonehearth gy I'm hearthing out
---
Mmm ye, but pretty sure these rings are unavailable for ele shamans forever?
---
is that a new show?  never even heard of it
---
I'm there for the +shadow damage offhand and mount. I could care less about honor.
---
I for one enjoy trying to take my play to the highest standard possible, of any game I play.
---
Casuals and Tryhards exist in every game, and their respective ideas of fun are not the same.
---
Esports is pretty cancer and did a lot to fuck up the video game community.  Same with streaming giving people "stardom" for playing video games.
---
Something similar happened to us in MC last night. Lootmaster was still distributing Majordomo drops while the rest was doing trash on the way to Ragnaros. Once we went far enough random drops could suddenly be needed/greeded for again.
---
Wanting to play with your friends/guild is fine.  Intentionally flagging players AFK who are trying to play the same game as you, is a dick move.
---
This is actually the reason I stopped playing Oldschool Runescape. Every update is voted on by the community. amd if more than 25% vote no, the update is just canned. This leads to every player thinking they know everything about what makes Runescape great, and they “know” that this and that update will “ruin” runescape. Obviously none of them know anything about making a good game, but they have all the power anyways.
---
The internet and the people on it have irrevocably changed since back in 2004-2010
---
Those are rookie numbers, you gotta pump those numbers up!
---
Golemagg had double those players in the same spot :D
---
If it has lower stats and doesn't look cool / isn't part of a set you want to collect, and/or if it's not a rare item to have :
---
it's ok to vendor your gear
---
What I wanna do is compete on the meters in raid with my guild mates. Which I can only do 2hours a week anyway. I have a bit more time than that, especially on the weekend. What there is in av is an upgrade, a damn good ring. And a decent xbow. Honestly, the only other fun in vanilla would be pvp (because the game is simplistic to the extreme outside of it) but I don't have the gold for engineering and potions, and I play a warrior. So raid it is.
---
Well RPG stands for Role-Playing Game. By definition, they are " games in which players take on the roles of imaginary characters who engage in adventures, typically in a particular fantasy setting " which envolve your character's progression throughout a journey.  There is no need to be a snarky pedantic little arse about it, your comment doesn't actually refute anything and is kinda pointless.
---
Also, you anti-circle jerk lot are incredibly un-self-aware. You only seem to complain about "circle jerk" when it disagrees with you, yet ignorantly partake in anti circle jerk circle jerk yourself.
---
Some say 19 is the \*most serious\* bracket.
---
Because even if you can't play you need your WoW fix, either by videos, forums or anything tied to it. And you take out your frustration by being a douche online, like a lot of other people with irl problems. No shame in that.
---
And you never called me a nerd =) So now you're starting to get delusional as well, are you all right mate?
---
Right? Alliance are happy "winning" AV with their 700-900 bonus honor. Sorry, Alliance, Horde are the ones winning AV with their 2800 bonus honor. Imagine thinking you're winning when you're actually losing LLLLLLOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLLLL
---
Strat and scholo are great for money. Maybe not the best but I've been grinding both for rep and getting 15-25g per run for doing something I was going to do anyway
---
Manga started in ~1987. But recently they started animating it with a proper budget. Give it a try, first season is a bit slow. (Only 9 episodes, don't skip it)
---
Yea Twitch culture has ruined gaming and not just WoW.
---
Yes, that's correct.
---
The renting here is very bad - mostly just really out of comission places, where owners want to extract money. Costs comparable to paying a mortgage.
---
For a relativly small appartment (not even a house), that will need some work, you will have to assume about 150k.
---
And yea, most people don't even make 1200. Even if we were to get a loan (probably wouldn't get it in that case), you need more than a lifetime to pay it off.
---
I think if you were to compare US-EU, costs are similar, but you have about 5-10 times as much buying power.
---
I think this is a cool document: https://mgmresearch.com/us-vs-eu-a-gdp-comparison/
---
Regardless, IDK how to even go about it. I see people in US pursuing early retirement - I don't think it's even possible where I live.
---
Addons should have been disabled for the first couple months, we know too much
---
I think a large portion of this toxicity is amplified by steamers
---
True that, but you won't get av exalted at day one with questing. Q with your friends / guild, run through the av, kill some leutenants, win - repeat
---
Often enough you play stuff like Settlers of Catan, but if you get double teamed or just have bad luck, the game may suck for a round or two.
---
In the grand schemes of things you enjoy it, but once in a while you get majorly pissed off at the game.
---
Same applies to Risk, monopoly and lots of others you can probably mention yourself.
---
When you get a key.
---
i hated gothik so much more than horsemen
---
god damn that fight was boring and took forever and its someone fucked up you just wasted 20 minutes
---
&gt; kick you out of AV
---
this is not a "minmaxer" problem, it's an "asshole" problem.
---
&gt;kick you out of a dungeon
---
A "minmaxer" just wouldn't invite you in the first place, they wouldn't kick you out of a dungeon.
---
If you're using daggers you must  have Improved Backstab, and Opportunity. There aren't exceptions to this. So [these talents are must-get to start out with](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/02-3203-05), then either get Blade Flurry asap, or go up Sub. If you're going combat, and you're level 46 [it should look something like this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/02-3203052020550100201-05) (with your next talent being Adren Rush at 47). Then just keep going up Assassination, [ending with this at 60.](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/025300104-3203052020550100201-05)
---
This right here. I'm a filthy casual and I love random PUGs for dungeons and BG's. Sometimes you wipe, sometimes you crush it. That's part of the game for me. It's nice playing with competent min-max tryhards sometimes, but those tryhards gotta understand that a lot of people just play for fun (hence all the bitching from low 50s after phase 2). The phase 2 debacle has calmed down, and hopefully the BG zerg rushing calms down in a bit too once there are a few rank 14s running around.
---
Different generations. Back in 2005 people didn't get triggered by anything and everything. Now they cry if someone calls them trash when they die from an exploding minion on Garr.
---
So you're saying I'm basically a social worker for doing this prank?
---
The brackets won’t be the same if more people are participating in them and more people are grinding honor. The amount of participating players are part of the calculation and more people will participate when there’s a structured event such as bg’s to participate in. And it’ll be easier to grind honor in a structured event like AV. 
---
Most people I know that want rank 14 actually waited until bg’s released to begin with to start grinding. You’re not neccesarily wrong that rank 10 can be obtained relatively casually to the other ranks. But it’d be pretty faulty to assume that the brackets and time investment required to achieve good standing for them aren’t going to change at all with the inception of battlegrounds. 
---
I’m curious to explain what exactly you mean by “the brackets will be the same in relation to time invested”? Are you under the assumption that everyone’s going to invest the same exact amount of time now that bg’s are released and that no additional people will be entering the pool?
---
Well, yeah, having easily visible characters and textures is fantastic in a competitive game.
---
I started my mage alt about a week ago and I’m specing fire because I rather blow things up than slowly AoE a group down (yes I know AoE is more efficient). I just buy mix gear of int/stam and fire damage and go to work. Can down most mobs my level in about 2 fire balls and an auto
---
The game hasn’t changed but the times have. The shit people do for fun in classic now is different than in vanilla 15 years ago.
---
Yeah but we did gothik, horsemen whipped us because we were dumb.
---
Can you elaborate this? Maybe a screenshot?
---
As someone from a PvE server, I've never seen so much toxicity/anger in this game than I have in crossrealm AV matches, and its always the people from PvP servers. Almost everyone on my PvE server is super chill.
---
Yeah i agree. I definitely think that streamers sort of amplify and provide a positive feedback loop for shitty and toxic metagaming.
---
??? I'm not saying you're wrong, I just don't understand why the set bonus would affect this at all
---
So funny watching the tryhard alliance from my server leave AV after we kill half their raid in the field of strife.
---
It’s 40v40. You can do whatever you want during the match regardless of if your team is trying to Zerg or turtle. Ignore the chat and do what you want in there
---
Where countless semen disappear without a trace?
---
the amount of upvotes represents the true A/H ratio. X-realm BGs heavily favor horde with it's extreme overpop.
---
While I like this idea, it'll have no effect. The people that are zerg pushing this right now don't care about the honor, they care about the AV rep for the items.
---
If it doesnt stay best honor for horde, it will start to dry up and flare up every AV weekend. Then you will be able to farm it easily. In between weekends it will indeed get more difficult
---
There are only two Rogues on my raid team (out of six) who don't have Perds yet. Myself (daggers) and a sword guy. He said he wants it for pvp but won't roll until i get it. So I'm basically next in line. Just need it to drop.
---
You just described what having a Y chromosome is like
---
Thanks, best one.
---
Let me correct that for you: The WoW private server community*
---
BECAUSE WE LIKE TO FUCKING PLAY THE GAME 
---
PLAY THE GAME
---
PLAY
---
Not waiting and waiting and waiting for the "MAH COMMUNITY" to gift us their precious time to do a fucking a dungeon or a BG. 
---
Yes an LFG would be fucking wonderfull for people that actually want to play the game and not wait around for every god damn thing. 
---
One of the reasons i loved AV back in the day it was because I could play almost instantely any time I wanted because the games were always running.
---
I don't want to play retail, because it has a lot of other issues I dislike, but giving me the option to not waste more time than needed is great.
---
Hahaha please stay unsubbed. You're a douche.
---
People complained about daily quests in BC as well, having to do 10 quests a day was insane.
---
Oh. You must have mistaken my obvious satire post as a a serious one.
---
I'm playing Druid which means I decurse and use Hots and BR as well.
---
This is exactly the way it works.
---
45 minutes is not a win in my eyes. come back when you've enjoyed a 7 day long one :)
---
This is why I decided against priest and now am fully embracing my hotw druid.
---
Yes I'm not the top healer in raids, but it was worth it.
---
Not if they report people not being part of the Zerg ...
---
Bye dickhead
---
When you put it like that, ill highly reconsider, thanks :p
---
I keep my main on follow with my alt.  Please try me.
---
Cool, later man.
---
Rod of the Ogre Magi
---
I think this change in gaming was engineered by devs, with “achievements” being pushed so hard on so many platforms. It’s like the reward centers of our brains have been totally warped to the point where a lot of people play games entirely for results as opposed to experiences.
---
AV is a great example. Two raids queue into a “pvp” instance, avoid each other like the plague because efficiency, get their honor and rep and eventually gear, then stop playing because they’ve gotten everything they can from the grind. What did any of that have to do with pvp? Did they even want to pvp?
---
Except Hillsbrad was never 100v100 because of how skewed every server is faction-wise. This was a place you could go that actually ensured that. That and the lag were the main reasons Hillsbrad wasn't more fun
---
You know what you are right. I think reading this sub is detrimental to my classic experience. Think I'll cut down my time here and live in ignorant bliss of everything that is "wrong" with the game.
---
I mean, I absolutely do. I know it's 9,000 from neutral to honored, and then another 12K to revered, then 21K to exalted. 
---
Hence my worry. In two days I only got enough playtime in to hit only about ~20% of the grind. I worry about the drop off as each day will probably show longer queues. 
---
Maybe that is an unfounded worry? Eh. I'm just being greedy and want the offhand.
---
if you give everyone that asks portals water and food, at some point you want to play the game. if I give everyone water that asks in AV right now I'd be spending half my playing time drinking. so I resort to ignoring everyone, don't think there needs to be another reason.
---
This is beautifully said.
---
I specifically find Classic WoW PVP to be the worse thing in gaming.  It's been changed and balanced for 15 years.  Why would you want to revert the PVP changes?  Why do you want to be repeatedly sheeped for 8 minutes?
---
Why do you want to PVP in a 15 year old environment anyway?  Try CSGO, Overwatch, LoL, Dota, Apex Legends or Starcraft if you want a player vs player game.  Blizzard is not going to balance or patch Classic PVP, so the dogshit you have is the dogshit you're stuck with.
---
I find pleasure and fun in the old raid content.  Optimizing and pushing top 1% parses.  I don't even have the time to attempt high rank PVP, nor would I want to do that grind.  But pushing top dps numbers on my server is something I can strive for in Classic.
---
How much +shadow damage do you have? My warlock is 58 and I'm looking forward to farm Mara and get rich (:D) I thought affliction was the ultimate spec for farming Mara.
---
On day one I won the majority of my games as horde by killing bal and vann, on day two nobody even wanted to try to win. It was a bizarre shift
---
Because you never played in low pop servers, that had 1 or 2 raiding guilds at most, and BGs queues were 45m+ most times.
---
for some reason on my computer back then the gate in gothiks room never loaded so I always had a blast running back and forth between the sides.
---
&gt; I would've loved to play some AV with epic long battles. Looks like I can't have that because most people have other priorities, so while that's unfortunate,
---
Amusingly, over half of my AVs so far have been these giant half hour, hour long behemoths---I played AV for about 4 hours last night and got just 6 matches in.
---
So far it seems like it's entirely up to the alliance whether or not they want that to happen as it only happens when
---
1. alliance fail the boss rush
---
2. alliance then decide to turtle
---
Also being a human gives you 10% bonus faction gains so that helps. But like some of the other comments have said, people essentially rush the highest rep giving bosses, kill them and end the game and instantly start a new one.
---
I understand, was just pointing out the facts.
---
Blade of kill are always doing dodgy stuff. Had a few times where I've been jumped on the way to BRD and a few Blade of kill members were just sitting there and only engaged other horde players coming through. Because they "saved them from a group of 20 horde earlier?" lol what? What does that even mean?
---
Sorry son, papa needs his off-hand. Go watch paw patrol for 8 hours!
---
I know thats how it's supposed to be but the numbers dont add up.
---
I never said it wasn't. And I never said they weren't aware it's a dick move. I just said they are likely not doin it for min maxing purposes as the time it would take to organize and the time spent under 40 people while trying to get your team in would be a detriment for sure. They likely genuinely just want to play together for fun and people are making it out to be some min maxer mentality. If they knew it was potentially ban worthy they likely wouldn't be doing it. I guess I'm just trying to say that I don't think there is as much maliciousness in their actions as people are reading into it. If blizz would just allow premade vs premade games this wouldn't be happening
---
Raids are great but only happen once a week. Once more raids are released there'll be more end-game ckntent to tackle, but right now we only have onyxia, MC and PvP for eng-game.
---
Quick before Spunkrat makes it!
---
My favorite thing in the game is killing people in PvP. To facilitate that I need good gear. To get good gear, I need to raid and collect honor efficiently for the time that I play. I have to min-max to collect gear. 
---
Fun is directly related to me min-maxing.
---
LEE, RUN TO THE CENTER!!!
---
I’m super disappointed in AV right now. It was a completely different beast in vanilla and even in BC I remember summoning the zone bosses. Now it’s literally garbage where you don’t even need to interact with the opposing faction.
---
Literally neither of the things you said apply to Classic. There are no tank one shots in classic. Fury/prot tanking is super popular all the way into Naxxramas specifically because very very few bosses  hit hard enough to mandate a shield.
---
And seriously? Healers go oom in Classic, that's reality. This isn't retail, Mana bars do not last for 2-3 minutes  of nonstop  casting and fill up  in &lt;20s. Mana pots and dark runes are mandatory consumables for healers in raid specifically because healers go oom quickly.
---
I mean considering there are comments like "found thunderfury in an iron ore node" I'm assuming most of those comments are just as trolly as they would be if made today
---
Lmao this is great
---
Someone mentions ElvUI here - don't fall for that. It changes every-fucking-thing UI related, and you will spend hours to modify it to look less obnoxious. 
---
For some decent and customizable player/target/party frames look into Shadowed Unit Frames, and for party/raid healing, get Grid2 - all you will ever need. Coincidentally, it displays "FD" on the grayed-out health box of feigning hunters, as a bonus. I can't recommend that addon enough, it's great.
---
Also, mouseover macros make healing a lot more reactive, I'd recommend looking up those as well if you haven't already. The addon Clique can fulfill the same function, but I rather go with macros so I'm depending on one addon less.
---
Again tho, it's not actually the right click report that is the problem, it's the straight up retardation and automation without checks that comes after it.
---
Right click to open a pre-filled form with their name/server is fine. Do you want to go back to names like iliilililii or Õ°╚±‗ that can basically not be reported unless you are a numpad savant?
---
Right click good, automation bad.
---
How many blood does it take for you to be able to summon him?
---
And a good portion of people who wanted classic also wanted cross realm bgs, and 99% of the people on small/low pop servers wanted.
---
Snowflake :D
---
Lmfao for real.
---
There was no requirement, just everyone trying to keep up with the Joneses. I easily found multiple guilds that didn't require that kind of bullshit.
---
But muh "NO CHANGES"!
---
PvPers are toxic? Outrageous.
---
Of the eagle gear. Stack stam and int.
---
lol WTF that's amazing
---
at the end of the day you play the game the way that you find fun, if thats min-maxing or just taking 6 months to get your first 60 that is down to you to have fun.
---
What a lot of the posts are saying is about the fact that a lot of the Min-Max players will do things like, not take tanks to SM farm runs as the optimal way to do it is 4 mages and a disc priest, thats not fun when you are a warrior that needs to do SM for kit and XP and it takes the fun out of playing if you cant get groups to do things that you need to do, and in classic some things you really do need to do if you want to progress at a normal pace.
---
there are guilds our there taking clear times for raids to the extreme to the point that if you are playing like a normal player and not a min-maxer they will kick you from raid/guilds.
---
I get that mentality if you are aiming to be the best but lets be real its classic its content that people have been farming for 15 years on pservers and retail when it was the main thing getting a sub 1h clear is impressive but its a bit like winning the egg and spoon race at primary school and tell the other racers they should be better if they want to do what you do, except you're an adult gloating to kids. if you want to min-max thats fine but you need to understand that not everyone does and as such you start to look a dick to people that dont want to min-max when you try to force it upon them.
---
as i said at the start the key is to play how you want to play and not enforce that on other people, AV is a hard one as you cant choose who you get in with so you will get a mix of people from both sides of the coin so there will be no perfect solution for that you just need to work out how you are playing before it starts and not have half the group rush while the other half wants to take it slow as they will just get trampled by a more organised Opposition
---
Your kids are either young enough for a bedtime or old enough for you to teach them wow.
---
What is the maximum possible rep you can gain in an AV match?
---
Boo freaking woo is someone a bit upset. God damn you are pathetic. But I will and I will play classic because I just have fun doing what I find fun. Now go one ahead little one and do what you find fun.
---
A+
---
&gt; Every subreddit for every game I play is people whining and bitching primarily.
---
Isn't that the truth?
---
Whenever a new game is announced, I join the subreddit associated with it and watch every day as people praise it for every snippet of information they get about it. 
---
But as soon as the game is released in a state that doesn't fit their exceptionally high standards, it turns into nothing but a gripe-fest. I totally understand not enjoying design aspects of a game or making legitimate complaints about things that are either inherently broken/unbalanced or poorly implemented. But as soon as that one bad thing is found about a game, the subreddit devolves into a lynch mob that brigades any positive post about the game.
---
The whole thing is tiring. The perfect game doesn't exist, and I don't think it will for a long time. Get over yourselves and try to enjoy what *does* exist.
---
No it's stupid. This is a WoW sub. Not a star wars fan club
---
Nope. Its just as much companies making the massive push for esports and shit. Many companies are pretty much indoctrinating theirplayers in the way they want them to think. The most obvious example is League of Legends. Where a large portion of the playerbase are esports junkies and Play the game 7 hours a day while hating everything. People are angry 80% of the time but they. still play because the games are designed as addictive as possible.
---
The community did change as the internet changed, but another big part is Gaming becoming way more mainstream and turning way more into a corporate scheme than anything else
---
You aren’t required to follow the Zerg? Why would Blizzard put quests in AV if you’re not allowed to do them?
---
Enter AV, go to bosses room, mind control opposing faction players to boss, profit. 
---
Most times they run out and wipe their raid because they were not ready.
---
If he doesn't wanna sell him a port he doesn't have to. 
---
A shopkeeper/bartender can refuse to allow you to purchase items at their own discretion for any reason whatsoever.
---
Dank.
---
nice,
---
im revered and i have not been in a game where ali has killed galv yet
---
Wrong sub.
---
My theory is that these are retail players who went along with they hype and weren’t really interested in the spirit of Classic the way pserver and nostalgic fans were, and here we are.
---
It's not BiS but unless you have the Rag ring and the Nef ring it's pretty goddamn great.
---
I rolled on a pve server in the first place because I knew I wouldn’t make it to 60 on a pvp server. I hit 60 barely a month in and I’ve been having a blast since, especially with AV :)
---
doing your part in what? you're associated with gold sellers?
---
and the 100g respec costs QQ
---
Horde losing in my experiance is getting them more honor than alliance winning as they actually kill balinda
---
Nah, history has shown that making a lot of noise about something people are abusing gets Blizz to do something about it.
---
Alternatively, you can drop your keys into your bank and pull them back out. They'll automatically go into the Keyring, which if you're running the default UI or a UI mod that supports the Keyring 'button'. It should then show up.
---
Also, most of the bag UIs have yet to be updated....so they won't show the keyring. :(
---
You’re the only one I’ve seen mentioning all of the above and I’ve been here for months
---
Blizzard are the ones who implemented the broken system to begin with
---
I remember this logic blizzard spewed about classic. How players had out grown the old systems and that nobody would stick with classic. Any accuracy Brack's statement has this current state of classic is coincidental. 
---
The game is flawed and doesn't endure under the scrutiny of a million players wanting to find the best road to their goal. But classic has already achieved its purpose in my eyes. It has seared the power of community driven game design back into blizzard and every other mmorpg publisher. In the years to come we might finally start to see mmos that are more than ding max and treadmill. It won't be all of them but I only need one to say thanks to classic.
---
But how are they making premades? I just want to group with like 5 people
---
There is a spot at the beginning like in the water you can have your buyer stand ( there’s a video on YouTube as to exactly where) while you run it. The video also shows that you have to kill princess in the right area for you to be able to master loot it to them. There is a patrol hydra that will walk into the buyer where they stand so make sure you find which one it is, mark it and kill it when whoever you’re running it with. I go by the honor system and only charge after they get it. no one has been a dick yet :D
---
I made this video from a few days ago - check it out starting at 4:17 (until 5:47) - you mean locusts like THIS?
---

Well, hopefully I won't experience it either.

Sorry, I didn't mean to imply that you downvoted ... I just though it's weird that it got downvoted in general.
---
Train Wreck
---
QS gets you 19 extra AP, but you lose 1 hit and 3 stam from Don Julios. Not sure if I'd say that's better.
---
If duo leveling this is the best spec but solo you want swords
---
I'm aware of that. What I implied with *relatively safe and wealthy* was the abandoning of tribal life and subsequent formation of the first real societies.
---
classicwow.live is free and pretty good
---
I swear, it amazes me how so many people just lack complete capacity for intelligent thought.
---
What this subreddit says: Giant gank squads camping people all night is toxic.
---
What you hear: PVP IS TOXIC THEN GO BACK TO PVE!!!!!!
---
No one is going to complain about picking on lobbies in a battleground and get upvoted, so dont straw man like a dip.
---
Because mage sl lock and spriest and hpriest are broken and fuck you thats why.
---
Although my username would tend to the idea that my thoughts and opinions are likely unfounded and without substance. My previous comment was simply an observation of what was probably the reason he did not like Greta.
---
There's always going to be shitty elements of any video game or any PvP server, etc - the fact is BGs have reduced the pain by like 75-90%+ (anecdotally) so i think we're significantly better off than we were before. Do you agree?
---
Sometimes people are held back by the environment in which they live. 
---
I don't want to just give you the advice to "leave your country and move someplace more reasonable," because that's not always possible. 
---
But i will say this. If it's something you decide you want to do, then you need to make saving money for that purpose a priority. Make it your goal and work towards your goal. 
---
Here's an anecdote, which i think is relevant. 
---
My father was a Hungarian who immigrated to the United States when he was 10 years old, during the Hungarian Revolution against the Soviets. He came here with his little sister, mother, and father. None of them spoke a word of English. They had no money. No possessions except the clothes they were wearing, and my father and his sister each had one doll. 
---
My grandfather decided he couldn't let his family continue living in Hungary. He knew the Hungarians would lose the revolution and continue to be oppressed by the Soviets. So, he made a difficult decision and smuggled his family out of the country, and eventually into the United States. 
---
My father and his sister leaned English in school here, at 10 and 6 years old. They taught it to their parents, who were able to at some point open up a Hungarian restaurant in California. My dad and his sister worked in the restaurant when they got older. The family lived above the restaurant until they find afford a bigger place, which they eventually did. 
---
My grandparents owned that restaurant for over 30 years. 
---
I'm not making any of this up. It's a true "Cinderella story" about the American Dream. 
---
My only point in telling you this, is that you have every advantage that my father and his parents didn't have. You speak English, and from what i see here, quite well actually. You seem educated. I'm making an assumption on this next one, but you almost certainly are not living in a war torn country in the midst of a revolution. 
---
I'm confident you will find a way to make a better life for yourself. Whether that would be in your own country or another, i don't know. But i know you will figure it out and make it work. Good luck.
---
No worries, it’s not showing your post having any downvotes on my end.
---
They said it was too hard. Too many NPC that were too hard to kill. 
---
Yeah, 15 years ago MC was “hard” too
---
Because you're incapable of adapting yourself?
---
The whole rush meta is just dull as can be. And I mean that in all respects of the game. The irony being that some of my friends who took this approach have burned themselves out and don't enjoy the game because they are treating it like a job. The problem isn't with the game, it's with the players.
---
What if that is fun for them? Since fun is very subjective.
---
Are you out of your mind? 2 str is 4 AP!?! It's literally almost a third of a DPS. Won't somebody think of the parses?! :'(
---
I took a break for a bit at 52. Came back post BGs. Everything is so much better. Just dinged 54 last night.
---
And now I have a 38 alt on a laid back Pve server which is fun too
---
Depends on server, economy, time of day, which way the wind is blowing. Download an addon that gives you previous sales and you’ll have a ballpark idea.
---
Lol Hunter Feign Death to take aggro off. Freaks every healer out the first time.
---
Lmao its the same story for 29s. I just did a wsg with 5 other 29 hunters and we just deleted everyone who came close, cause the STV gun is like lv45 gear
---
Same dude it’s painful. My RMG on them
---
Is a joke
---
Thanks
---
I wish I started uni when Wow classic dropped. I would've no lifes the shit out of it. Also, classic is an easy game to play while lowkey listening to online classes.
---
Atleast I did get a full 7 days off at launch in between the end of uni and the start of my job.
---
I did this in CS 1.6 lol. Fps models
---
Person Min-maxing = good and fine
---
Person Min-Maxing expecting everyone else to min-max and telling them they are playing wrong or are bad players if they don't = bad and annoying
---
Bully those that won't do what you want.
---
Oh yeah that too + consumables for both pvp and pve.
---
But yeah the gold i made from that day went into buying nightslayer belt. I dont expect to make that much in a day or a weekend any time soon tho.
---
You literally were happy that no pvp happened on a pvp server. Downvote away, I’m just suggesting maybe it isn’t for you. I think the death balls are stupid too, but if I see red it’s dead.
---
Blizzard was right classic was a mistake.
---
Honestly glad i quit playing it the toxicity in BG and pvp as a whole is just too much, its not a minority thats abusing the system its rampant and large amount of players are doing it and its utterly shameful.
---
Priests is pretty powerful in pvp, cause of despell!
---
Despells are classspecific, Mages and Druids can decurse, Druids and Shamans can anti-poison, Paladins and Priests can despell magic and disease! May not 100% right, feel free to correct me.
---
So at least for Horde, Priests are the only Magic-Despeller.  In PvP there is alot of Magic Debuff, for example sheep, frostnova, corruption, fear, ice trap, hammer of justice, ...
---
Most CC a Priest can remove with a global in range and your teammates love it. Stay with em, so the Warriors and Rogues die on trying to kill you.
---
This is so true. I’m not into gaming culture anymore but the scene has changed from “having fun” to “maximizing efficiency.” The play turned into work for some reason.
---
Ivus the forest lord can be summoned, wolf/ram cavlary charge, air strikes from rescued commanders in towers....you can also upgrade armor of the guards.....but yeah...you are not going to get that in today's 5 min AVs  
---
PS: There was also Korrak in mid field -  [https://wow.gamepedia.com/Korrak\_the\_Bloodrager](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Korrak_the_Bloodrager)
---
\*you're
---
Yes it is my opinion, and its likely the opinion of the vast majority of people who queue for AV. People don't want to zerg rush AV and people enjoy it. It gives them the fastest reputation
---
Hydra, it says so in the title.
---
And in the middle of this holy trinity is masturbation, holding it all together.
---
This is “no changes.” This is 1.12 AV. We’ve known this is coming for months.
---
Having a loot council that funnels all of the loot to their friends and “girlfriends”
---
I mean everyone knew we were playing 1.12 why were expectations different?
---
We aren’t all that strong. Only with the best gear can we do anything right now. Casters just stuff us.
---
A few horde race/gender combos have only 1 casting animation, Tauren male and female are both examples of it so that encompasses all Horde druids. Off the top of my head, female undead is another example. Note, they do still have multiple casting flourishes that happen at the end of casts, so once the Hearthstone goes off you do see the Tauren do a Wrath-style flourish instead of a healing style flourish, but at that point it's too late to interrupt of course.
---
One hell of a fatass
---
50 DKP MINUS!
---
Mind control often resists and has a very short range and a long cast.
---
It is indeed the best spell for the lolz, but leveling a priest for it will disappoint you a bit :)
---
Take caution guys. Be nice to socially awkward mages in their safe bubbles. And god forbid - don't even whisper anyone without their permission! O:
---
The good news is, every person who wins it is one less person you have to compete against.
---
He probably just can’t see it because of his class
---
Wow, talk about blaming the sheep for what the wolves do. None of US are making hundreds of millions of dollars. None of US have the power to change the game. None of US can influence player behavior en masse. Maybe think before you touch your keyboard, OP.
---
And that children is how eSports was invented
---
I completely disagree with that. Quests are full of lore and the story of the area you are in, they help me actually get into the fantasy universe instead of feeling like a peon that grinds XP as quick as possible to reach max level. I've been playing WoW since release, and have never enjoyed questing up until I started reading them. I used to spam dungeons and battlegrounds and even in retail, reading the quests brought the game back from the dead for me. I wouldn't mind if WoW was a text based adventure game like the really old ones, it has an intriguing story.
---
The problem is that server pops are WAYYY higher than in vanilla. and xrealm appears to be all realm. So you're dealing with a higher volume of the same type of population. that means more min maxers. And in vanilla min maxers always determined how the game was played. So while you also have more casuals a casual, by nature, will never be involved enough to steer the game in their desired direction... except when it comes to subscription dollars. 
---
Which is why wow walked the path it walked. Like it or not, this version of wow, grind city for min maxers is 100% more popular. That said, you still have a lot of freedom.  You can run WSG. wPvP. City raid. fuck up the AV zerg with just a handful of people (I did this once last night after I ran a few zergs and wanted to do something else).  
---
Vanilla's "meta" will always be determined by the min maxers, but what's great about it is that it's open ended enough you can still pursue the type of game you want regardless of everyone else's cooperation.
---
If you're only grinding AV for the ring, why wouldn't you want to help the zerg? Get that ring and get out lol AV is a shit show
---
/r/forza is pretty happy with Horizon. Very little bitching.
---
That’s not me man, people don’t listen. Some are trying to draw the game out as long as possible. I’m just there for the honor because apparently blizz wants us to pve for the quickest honor gain.
---
I'll be stealthed right behind the priest to fuck up your day for picking on a healer.
---
https://youtu.be/jrJap2Kx-qs
---
Watch the first couple minutes of the video.
---
I didnt know Blizzard made people zerg AV.
---
I hardly feel like grinding 100+ AVs should be considered free. Sure it's not the most difficult of task but it still takes time to get for those that can't play 16 hrs a day.
---
Yeah, Razorgore EU. You can send fanmail to Kranen. :p
---
Got mirmidons signet like that. But from an owlbear
---
LoL you can tell the OP didnt actually play vanilla. Because this is the experience. LoL why did you think it would be different?
---
The flaw in your argument is that fun is not ***exclusively*** tied to novelty. Fun can be cultivated many ways, and many familiar things to us can still be fun. 
---
Personally I do agree that the min max bullshit is ruining many aspects of the game that I enjoyed. 
---
* I somehow landed in a hardcore raiding guild that fields multiple teams to clear MC and Ony combined in 2hrs or less. We are forced to acquire specific gear to gain entry to the raid, and also which upgrades to spend points on. We move at such a breakneck speed it is not enjoyable in the least. As a healer, I fucking hate it. After raids, our logs are parsed and people are publicly shamed for errors. I would prefer a 3 hr run that is smoother. Because our raid leaders are always pushing the boundaries, there isn't room for error. Error is a wipe or somehow not recoverable. 
---
* World bosses are a big deal. The bragging rights are huge and we are proud to have denied the ally ANY loot from Kazzak or Azuregos to this day. But the Best in slot gear is the driver. Its all about that stupid hat from azuregos or whatever the thing is for your class. 
---
* "LF Healer for Rend Runs" you know what? Fuck everything about that. This notion that people are only willing to experience a tiny slice of content that yields optimal rewards is a shitty, cancerous, selfish mentality. As a jest, I quipped that if a warrior was going to charge to tank a dungeon then I would charge for heals. Dudes didn't even blink. Handed me 15g on the spot. 
---
* Min Maxers have ruined AV. Ok ok blizzard ruined it lol. But we've settled into a scenario where everyone hates what should be an epic ass fun battle because schlubs only care about the rep or honor per hour
---
Or old enough to have them defend the home from the roaming wolf packs.
---
&gt; Classic was supposed to be a reset
---
You can reset the content, but you can't reset the mentality of the players.  WoW wasn't a min/maxing shitfest in 2005 like it is now.
---
Priests are BiS class in WSG
---
Level 4 with a key ring and no keys. Weird.
---
Is it really being killed if people like you are not min/maxing and you’re still playing?
---
Haters gon' hate
---
I got AFK reported because Iam port spec and got picked off in the mid field during the Zerg. Guys from Herod we’re actually whispering me saying how shit I was then I got booted and the deserter debuff. Also had it happen when the small premades get in with tanks they report other tanks right at the start.
---
&gt; When you're new, that enjoyment will mostly come from discovery - but you can't discover the same thing twice, or thrice, and expect the same level of enjoyment.
---
Agreed.. but after *15 years* you do have a lot of things to discover again.
---
I think a big clash of interest comes from the fact that a lot of people come directly from pservers and it makes sense for them to focus on minmaxing and optimizing everything, because it's the 5th character they lvl to 60 this year. At the same time you have the people who just want to replay the Vanilla they haven't touched for 15 years because they didn't really fancy the idea of pservers. 
---
I'm having a mixed experience. Getting a lot of enjoyment out of rediscovering the game and just playing how I feel like at the moment, but also enjoying to now play it more optimally and just knowing more about what I probably should do. Had I played a bunch of pservers before this I probably would've spammed spellcleave more and all that.
---
that I don't know. I'd have to google around.  I would strip naked, equip it, run out and get hit by a low level mob and see if you recover anything above baseline.  
---
then put on some cheap +healing green gear from the AH and repeat, see if you heal more per 5.
---
I know we're kinda deep into the game, release-wise. However.. I almost feel like it's becoming imperative that perhaps we either declare a server as the de facto chill out server, or instead we come together as a community and just simply start mass reporting people who are being this toxic, raise awareness (something we've been doing..) to Blizzard that toxicity is killing this game. 
---
I've had a few toxic moments happen to me during classic that's frankly derailed my path to 60. I won't get into details, but I was level 48 in October. Today I'm I think level 52? See I don't even know. I just lost interest in something I had so much hope for because of the constant barrage of toxicity. I'm not even on a PvP server.
---
Damn. When i turn bagnon off i can access the keyring tho.
---
I am under the impression that doing the AV quests will give you the most rep. Is that not true?
---
Simple fix #3: Make the ban-o'-bot-5500 with build in detection on whether the report for afk or similar is legitimate by analysing positional data over time and movent patterns.
---
And then when they see that the subreddit is flooded with complaints, they go "SEE, we're the majority!"  
---
No, all the sensible people unsubscribed from the sub-reddit/ignore it while you bitch for a month straight about a new patch.
---
&gt;Someone in my guild said the spell penetration would be too powerful at this point in the gearing cycle.
---
This makes no sense. Spell pen is only powerful in pvp against players with resistances ... except people are running around in *updated* gear that has more resists than it originally had before spell pen was added.
---
You’ll get over it
---
All arguments aside, I simply had significantly more fun in the pre-nerfed AV than the easy-mode AV that is currently in Classic.
---
I'm really disappointed that they didn't want to include the original rendition of the BG. Because it was incredible fun.
---
"Disarm warmasters"
---
\*crickets\*
---
A puppet guild Jesus Christ this game has come a long way this hole is deep
---
Well shit theirs 6 phases!? Why did I even bother leveling to 60 yet!?
---
I wish i had time for raids, although i'll be Pvping mostly, raids will help with gear.
---
It also doesn’t help that so many on reddit are PC babies
---
Are the WSG rewards good for shadow priests?
---
It's too late. There are people that already are exalted and I don't. Getting the slow version of AV now would screw me over.
---
Ur mums sad because she has become extremely entitled.
---
Alliance already wins 90% of the time, why do they even need a premade?
---
There is a popular raid heal spec 30/21/0 that lets you get all the essential holy talents and blessing of sanctuary from the prot tree. You can tank 5 mans with this just work on a tank set while getting BiS, ask for plate pieces the tank doesn’t need. Leveling wasn’t that bad honestly
---
As far as pvp healing I haven’t respecced, but if you’re zerging in AV like everyone else you’ll heal well
---
The asking prices are ridiculous, so they will lose money from frequent posting
---
"Why not three years earlier to save your dad?"
---
It's all of the people selling stockades runs. I'm not sure how it is on horde side and if selling SFK runs is common but as an alliance player I run my characters through SFK from 10-15 and 15-20 in stocks and I have 5+ twisted chanter staves and 5+ witching staves so I'm pretty sure all this twink gear is coming from selling dungeon runs
---
Lol the rogue stealth noises always use to trigger me, but now they do even more lol. Hunter pets drive me insane. lol.  I run around holy nova-ing the minute I hear the noise.
---
I’ve been critical of the way Blizzard has been handling API changes to their game because the removal of the the ability to send to channels directly impacts the way I was building out a sync feature for a World Defense-type addon I already released. 
---
I don’t really enjoy gatekeeping gatekeepers. Some have the required background. Do I need to forward you my resume?
---
That's what it's all about for a lot of people!
---
Well that is good, i thought Its a bit too crazy but then again this is classic so i thought it's working as intended.i don't have one but couldn't believe my eyes when i saw the regen in action
---
Probably around the same time competition was invented
---
Imagine AV the best honor farm and you can't play it with people from your server. 
---
Nice MMO.
---
If anything I liked the AP farming from M+ because it incentivized you to consider doing certain lower keys just for AP since the chance of you getting something useful was basically zero. It made lower keys relevant (unless you had like HoV then your key was basically done). 
---
But now in retail, that incentive just isn't there and it made mid-level keys into basically a purgatory if you don't have friends because most of the pugs who will even look at a key less than 9 are either super undergeared alts or people who are so bad they can't even get into a 9 let alone a 10.
---
What are we looking at?
---
I'm usually trying to get from kargath or felwood (saving song flower buff duration etc). I say "usually", but probably 50% of the time I'm just paying to not have to ride a zep from uc to org or vice versa. Having to run outside the UC only to see the zep to org flying away isn't worth saving 1g to me usually.
---
Why respect a streamer in the first place lol it's just a dude playing video games people get way too invested in this shit
---
What the actual fuck?
---
I honestly think it's the non-minmaxers who are the issue here. Don't get me wrong. I'm not talking about all the dad-gamers who know they're noobs and have accepted that there are people who are nolifing this game excessively. I'm talking about the noobs who want to play with "the big guys" but start crying when they are confronted with the reality that they suck so bad that they just aren't fun to team up with. 
---
Those are the ones who are posting shit like "eyyy have fun, don't minmax kk??".
---
Fuck that.  We are having fun but you suck and you're ruining it. 
---
Down vote me. You know it's true.
---
I enjoy zerg rushing far more than pvp
---
My gutripper.
---
Shhhhhh let people enjoy things
---
Meaning?
---
I've just been hitting the side quests.  It's fun.  Run into one of the mines and try to collect 10 supply boxes before the invisible random 6-14 minute timer declares someone the winner!
---
Honestly this version of AV and the way play it makes it inevitable. I'm Horde and won only maybe 25% of my games yesterday at most, and after just 3-4 hours I was Honored. It's not hard to see how people could reach Exalted very quick.
---
Running people off boats can make me giggle in between the boredom though
---
I don't think so, most of what made classic a friendly atmosphere was ignorance to min/maxing. Very few people rushed anything and majority of the vanilla player base just played to have fun. 
---
These days everyone wants to rush to everything. I'm sorry but Jay was right, "You think you do, but you don't". The constant and consistent negativity to classic is the You don't part finally coming to light.
---
I'd say that Sunwell Plateau island (the name escapes me) was the template of what we hate today. The only saving grace was that it wasn't necessary to do whatsoever. It gave you something to do, and top guilds could do the raid. 
---
However, the template of going to the zone, doing the same set of dailies day after day, to finally get that one epic piece at the end. They took this, and then shoved it in front of a LOT of content. In MoP, to get pre-raid gear and other bits to push progression. WoD was that stupid fort they made you live in. Legion backed off on mandatory rep a little, but greatly emphasized the WQ grind. Eventually it ended up being in front of major advertised parts of the expansion. (I'm looking at you, allied races)
---
AQ was cool though.
---
Randomplayer has reported you for being AFK. Type /afk to dispute.
---
Don't buy guides thats a complete waste of money. They offer nothing more than free guides some times less.
---
Sure but be ready to accept the consequences.
---
100str =200 ap= 14dps= 42 extra dmg/swing/instant attack on a 3.0 wep, more if its slower.
---
Good luck to shadow priests trying to get it.
---
When it happens 1% of the time, someone is bound to record it, hit front page, and claim it happens 99% of the time.
---
Because they want you to fish duh
---
It was worthless
---
Ret pali or shadow priest?
---
While this is completely fine as long as you're having fun, there is something to be said about prioritizing the experience of people who are playing a bit more often. If you're only level 20, even super casually you've played maybe 20-25 hours in 3.5 months? I think this thread is more talking about people min/maxing the shit out of endgame compared to just enjoying it at a normal pace.
---
If only you could have it for shaman tanking
---
True.
---
They thought they wanted this, but they didn't
---
[twinkinfo.com](https://twinkinfo.com) risky click of the day
---
Your attitude is worse than his. Why do you think PVE servers exist? A shit ton of people don't PVP and calling them losers for their decision in a fucking video games makes you out to be nothing more than a pathetic neckbeard.
---
Theres a clip on twitch of someone opening them during downtime in mc getting the Lionheart helm pattern
---
How do you even do this without losing after 10 minutes anway :P
---
Kekw salty undead downvoting. 😂
---
Good news: AV is PvE.
---
You should've farmed gear while leveling.. May not be as efficient but you can start farming HOJ at levels 55+/-
---
I follow the T0 BiS so i'd just go for LBRS at 57+ and Scholo at 59-60..
---
Of all the dungeons i'd farm Scholo fresh from 60 cus its the easyer one and gives 3 t0 + offhand sword.
---
While waiting for group for those places you could start farming Jujus + Winterspring water.
---
Also, buy the DM Lib trinket quest item and get it asap since it's great and cheap and you can solo grab it.
---
If possible, buy 2 DM N Tribute Rings, hunters solo that shit all the time and sell the rings for 25 to 50g... 100G for 2 bis items is just too good to let it go.
---
After scholo farm, focus on UBRS + Strat runs for the last pieces.
---
They did. 
---
The problem never was the game. It’s the people.
---
tell us how you really feel, normie
---
Why do people want AV to last 2 days?
---
Imagine calling your guild fucking Blade of Kill, jesus christ.
---
This a valid point as well.
---
But. 
---
The fault is not on munchkins aka minmaxers. The fault is on Blizzard for making bad design decisions. World of Warcraft is a brilliant leveling game, but it has an awful endgame design. 
---
Have you ever asked yourself, why Barrens (including its glorious chat) remains the same through the years? I have an answer for you. It has a steady flow of players arriving and leaving it. It's just like a running water versus stagnant pool. You don't level in Barrens forever, you go and leave the place for the new players to come. And there are a lot of such places in the game, basically all locations can relate, especially low-level ones. A it's not about locations also, there a lot of hubs like these that's just accumulate players for healthy leveling, be it dungeons, sets of elite quests, occasional PVP areas etc. 
---
But it gets worse when you approach last levels, starting around an infamous level 48. All players are put in the same stagnant water. And there is no way to move one, you either having fun or you are done. 
---
It turns out that the both PVP and PVE require gear (by guild, by battleground, by your own ego etc) and gear require minmaxing. There is no other activity designed other than minmaxing. There is no quest or activities that are not bound to gear. You can think of RP but it's something players come up with by themselves - it is not endorsed by Blizzard in any way. And if you don't want to minmax - sorry - you either quit or just not considered as a serious player anymore by the game itself. This is the exact point when the fun impression starts to diverge for different people. 
---
The topicstarter mentioned a new game+ concept. That would bea thing similar to healthy leveling and it might be wonderful, but, alas, there is no such concept in wow. A 48 level and a hardcore player are bound to play the same game and we just have witnessed how awful it can be. But what's interesting, somehow that issue was addressed in battlegrounds with a notion of brackets.
---
As I said, it's a brilliant leveling game and I am glad to see a lot of people start to give leveling more credit. Previously it was all about \_game starts at 60 \_ stuff.
---
Who's "we"?
---
REEEEEEEEeeEeeeEEEEE people aren't playing on PvP servers the way I think they should
---
If you dont post a screenshot to social media every time you enter a zone with the label "this game is so beautiful!" you arent playing the game right!
---
We're talking about the "report player afk" feature.
---
I mean, the simple fix for this is to not allow reporting afk until 30s to 1m after a match starts.
---
/r/classicwow comment scores are hidden until 6 hours after commenting.
---
For rank 10?
---
Really? Because I don't think the hardcore players are complaining about world pvp or av zergs and that's currently all this sub is.
---
Since my buddy went into the hospital, I’ve been on a. Classic hiatus, and tbh, I’ve been a lot happier without it in my life. No more wasting time being griefed, no more boring raid mechanics and no more guild drama.
---
Make money lol
---
Your incoming rep diminishes after revered. So the numbers are equal, but there’s less filling the tank.

all we are useful for huh... ? helping others (=

Don't watch his looser stream then

I wonder what Shazzrah is like in EU..
---
Blessing of freedom will be dispelled immediately by any priest that isn’t brain dead. What’s the cd on freedom vs druid shift?

Who actually said that? I heard it in a Mark Brown video, but I think he was quoting someone else.

Shit in socks and piss in bottles.

Realize that the mobs in there are hard.
---
It takes me a minute or two to kill one.
---
They give little rep in comparison to the win/loss but I mean that’s going to happen anyways so do you mate, I was with the Zerg at first but now I just pvp at choke points and catch stragglers
---
TIL
---
Well no right? Because that happens when you try to chase the money. You want to get the most amount of players even if some quit that don't like it.
---
Blessing of freedom will be dispelled instantly by priests twinks.
---
But I am? Like yes Blizzard makes decisions about classic based on cost. But this particular case wouldn't make sense in that discussion.
---
League of Legends right here.
---
Those guys are fucking assholes
---
Tried that, you need to hit a player.  These small brain orc warriors get so pissy when I run up to them, unstealth, wave, get 1 white hit in, then walk away.  Stupid brutes charge in when I'm obviously not interested in fighting.
---
Is it to early to start a pug MC/Onyxia guild with just MS&gt;OS loot rules to the more casual crowd can start raiding without so much commitment to a super hard core guild? Do these type of guilds usually fail and that’s why i never see them?
---
Winning/Losing doesn't mean much, look at the HONOR gained.
---
Horde always end with more honor, 90% of the time.
---
I don't recall having right-click reporting in 2005.
---
How do some of them even get in the same AV instance to begin with? I’ve been trying to time my queue joins with a friend since AV release and it hasn’t worked once. :(
---
The ring is Best in Slot.
---
Paladin tanks are NOT okay for DM:W, that's about it.
---
The mana burn in that dungeon is fucking real dude.
---
Well I can.
---
Minmaxin killed WOW and lead to Retail.
---
We all know what pathetic state of the game... Blizzard diden't listen to the players they listened to the Minmaxers.
---
Minmaxing leads to toxic behavoiur.
---
I say it is very inefficent not getting the maximum fun out of a game... But toxic behaviour + forcing Blizzard to do stupid things + grinch the game for all others leads to a game nobody wants to play anymore.
---
Those people did not learn from Retail.
---
"But I have so much fun"... no you haven't. You are patting your ego.
---
If that is fun then maybe video games is not the right thing for you.
---
Report everyone rise up against these BFA changes!
---
If I work with four other people, I can put my lunch in the fridge and rest assured that nobody’s going to steal it, probably. If I work with 39 temps that rotate out every 15 minutes, I’m not eating lunch if I put it in the fridge.
---
Nobody cares about his moronic reasons, but thx guy.
---
Yea no not even close
---
This is claimed a lot but it does make me scratch my head over all the well geared dps out there performing like ass on the parses, how do you explain that then except they are shit and skill is a bigger factor than people admit?
---
"ive lost respect for him" why respect any of these camera monkeys anyway.
---
What???!?
---
Thanks for this Comrade, 10$ has been added to your account.
---
Can only move up one rank per week. Should read up on the honor system before burning yourself out.
---
Doin gods work my man keep up the goodwork.
---
Remember if your catching flak it means your over the target
---
If I had any gold you'd get it for that comment, 10/10
---
Sure, but I'm very confident that no bean counter is putting in any input on the cost of changing the AV queue limit. I've been working in a large, publicly traded, tech company for years now. I've worked with the bean counters. They are not that tuned in to minutiae.
---
I always feel a small moment of guilt when I charge and hamstring a guy on a poverty mount... It doesn’t last long though
---
He said the first time you experience something, part of the fun is novelty. Which dissapears after you've done something a bunch. Then you find new ways of making it fun minmaxing, speed running, etc. Or you stop playing.
---
You are falling big time behind if you try to rank in WSG, due to the massive honor intake you get from AV.
---
Surely you'd love AV, its literally 100% PVE
---
Hahahaha haha ha. Dude, our first priest was livid trying to the quest for 3 weeks, ganked incessantly. Finally got it done. We got another eye the other friday, the dude had it Saturday. I was wondering why he was being kinda coy when I asked him if he thought it was hard. He had help.
---
As a lvl 53 Hunter I took the Spear because it was a much better upgrade (+2 agil +20 stam) compared to the bow that was (-1 agil, +3 dps)
---
Got 2 Arcane Crystals on my way to 300 mining skill.....haven't seen another since.
---
I hope you don't end up wearing a skirt like a lot of paladins do. We're fighters not dancers.
---
I don't join AV to pvp, I join for honor and rep. If I get more by afking out, that's what I'm doing. If I want to actually pvp I'd rather go into WSG where it isn't self-sabotage
---
It's mainly for blizzard. Arcane Explosion and Cone of Cold actually get a decent damage boost from spell+
---
Old AV sucked. I played it when it originally came out. It was a boring turtle fest that could last 3-6 hours and winner was usually determined by which side had the most players get tired and /afk out.
---
I literally played one Saturday 5 1/2 hours of AV and never got into one that ended. I afked out.
---
Oh yea, thats the worst. 
---
I get really bad strings of being mentally tired for weeks while at the same time having trouble sleeping.
---
Diet and exercise has helped but sometimes i just feel old regardless.
---
I have no idea, never played pally in vanilla or classic but holy pally sounds like a blast
---
Right now parses mean basically nothing. The fights are way to short to balance out the variance of crit/hit (let's say for warlocks). A few weeks ago Lucifron hit 30% or so before I was able to get my support curse up because I got 4-5 resists in a row. We are 4 warlocks in our raid and every fight there's a different one on top who got lucky with hit and critting.
---
I'm more surprised you had any respect for him in the first place. I'm not at all shocked by him doing this, he seems like the type.
---
Well people covered most of it.
---
Just remember that hit benefits you even over the softcap.
---
And base your spec on weapons you get.
---
So if ya get good daggers, use them 
---
...same with swords
---
Thanks for the offer! I’ll keep you in mind.
---
You tag until having the same match ID.
---
90% of the reason I want a paladin is for class fantasy! Lol
---
One of my friends are like this. Saying what is BiS and shit and he playing A LOT. I'm a father now so I get to play on weekends at best and, sure i have the addon that tells me what BiS is but I forget to look at it most of the time. Also I don't look at what is in each dungeon so I do them to level and hope something for me drops lol. Sure i can look it up and only do the dungeons that has my BiS but I love 5 man dungeons in Classic. I played retail for a month and half the dungeon is skipped....they even made it an esport smh
---
hahaha pvp players !
---
When did people stop blaming developers for poor game design?
---
When did people start blaming players for "playing the game wrong" instead of questioning why incentive structures aren't in place to encourage better behavior?
---
If Blizzard don't want people to spam, they can change the systems of incentives to discourage spam. Why haven't they done so?
---
Why are you blaming the players instead of blaming the game?
---
Yeah dude!
---
Really? damn i never thought of that.. too bad i can't rank properly on a big server with everyone spamming AV for 2x the amount of honor in the time i can finish 1 wsg with a good premade.
---
More of a zoomer thing, since a boomer would be well aware of what turtling is, as it just isn’t an aspect of pvp anymore compared 10+ years ago.
---
Minmaxers, are by concept, hardcore players, I suppose we could argue semantics, but minmaxing does not come without effort, understanding, and ability. The people who are going to put in the effort and time to min max their gear and stats, at least to an extent, overlap with the people who are most likely to critique game state because it effects them the most.
---
Regardless, my point was that everyone is just trying to enjoy the game in their own way, which is perfect, but the competitive side (hardcore, grinders, minmaxers) are flooding this sub with negativity. The casual players, I was suggesting, are just coming here for neat content, and are possibly tired of it. 
---
Casual players often aren't able to even participate in that sort of content (discussions/rants/flaming over gamestate) because they are completely removed from it, so it bars their enjoyment of this sub and they feel they have to speak out.
---
It's circular, and I think these posts aren't going to help anyone.
---
Either you play 24/7 of you're at a disadvantage
---
Talking very narrowly about the honor system, and PvP rewards, and rewards oriented play.
---
A game like factorio is super fun to me, but a lot of folks feel the game is over once they’ve launched a rocket or gotten all achievements.
---
I agree generally about open world games.
---
If you have fun ranking then play AV. If you havd fun playing WSG then play WSG. You can't have both.
---
After all that you spelled it rouge
---
Do you mind explaining what parsing is?
---
Mind linking your actual spec? Didn’t realize spiritual healing worked this way!
---
Yet genuine threads about spec discussion etc are removed by mods.
---
Your server is shitty, that's all.
---
What do you mean, AV is pure pve?
---
Awesome. I’ve heard dagger rogues will usually still go combat and use backstab, but I guess mainly combat for the extra weapon skill. Is that true?
---
By all i assume you mean like 50% and the rest are a bunch of lvl 13 and 17s , cause twink bgs are far from being all premade vs premade....dont care much foe lvl 60 wsg but thats how it is. Lot of peeps dont care for min maxing, far more than 50%.  I do wsg for fun.
---
What's your point? I said bgs would kill world pvp. I never said bgs were fun or better than wpvp.
---
I even tried to tell people that world pvp is more fun than the av grind or war song premades but they never listen. They didnt listen in 2005 and they are repeating the same stupid complaints now.
---
Yep, rolled on a RPvE server and I've only had *two* bad experiences out of hundreds good ones
---
Yes, you are the only one.
---
Speak for yourself I guess? I have more fun rushing AV bosses than derping around a middle gy essentially not changing the state of the game
---
Trying to force fast wins is fun for some people
---
Quick tip to have fun, run a dungeon with a group of players that is lower level then you. It is a fun light hearted experience. You have little to gain other than having fun with other players.
---
That's probably true, but the thought of five felhunters nomming my butt while I tried to run made me instinctively flinch.
---
I really hope the slow response to this is due to them finding and sorting all the abusers (sorting out legitimate AFK kicks and Defensive removals of abusers), then preparing a 10-day banwave this weekend and rep rollback of the offenders.
---
You are talking about RP not CP
---
at least with items like raid gear you can borrow or grind up gold and recover your gear, but 100% it was better when there was actually customer service for world of warcraft.
---
All I have seen for classic are various ways of GM's telling players to "fuck off; deal with your own problems".
---
My favorite is all the macro people who spam "GO BEL/LTS THEN LOSE! MAX HONOR AND REP" 
---
There's always at least 4 people with different macros.....
---
I hate AV as Horde. Thankfully I'm close to exalted
---
when was pushing ranks fun
---
Look at sandbox games like eve and albion, they are "player-run stories"
---
I had to beat cancer the old fashioned way. This cure is a complete slap in the face to everyone who had to actually struggle with cancer!!😖😖😖😖

Seems like terrible luck. I think mine's been pretty average, I started logging it at some point.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mOpqgeb7AOT6fReevEJVvd-q634nU3ws9adTiFycDOc/edit?usp=sharing
---
Yes? Browsing a forum about a topic you're interested in is completely different from no-lifing WoW 10 hours a day which I did at first.
---
This subreddit has been in my task bar every since the day it was created (one of the first 2000 subscribers back when I was here 2 hours each day) and I never really got around to removing it. I like seeing the game evolve like with BG's coming out now.
---
Any pally gold farm tips? Just mining arcane crystals or?
---
Do you play like 5 minutes a day? How tf are you still 26 lol
---
MC is getting cleared in under 30 minutes because we mostly have 1.12 itemization. Same for gold generation and 1.12 talents. 
---
Now, without that, would people still be killing MC? Sure. And they'd still be making gold. But the extreme it is taken to is a result of not using the standard phased approach that most private servers settled on to mirror the actual classic rollout. 
---
Also, as a druid, I disagree with HoT stacking making the abilities useless. It just requires marginal coordination in raids. I don't mind the idea of classic+ at some point, but I am concerned that too many changes would open up everything, and every class ends up lobbying for buffs.
---
Wait, people are useless because they joined a PvP battleground and actually try to PvP? That's a brand new take on things.
---
People don’t understand that what made classic great back in 2006, was because it was so ahead of its time and people were struggling to keep up. That’s why when someone hit rank 14 or got tier 3, you were in awe, like you couldn’t even grasp the idea of obtaining these yourselves. It’s not that games got more boring, it’s that us gamers got smarter, more competitive and more resourceful. 
---
The unknown is now known, and the unobtainable is obtainable (and made easier to track your progress through guides and adding). The excitement is gone. 
---
It’s fundamentally impossible to recapture the nostalgic experience of games from back in those days. I’m honestly surprised that so many people don’t understand this.
---
I play very casually. I'm not trying to max my character out in a week (impossible). I have played since BC but I have missed the last few rollouts so I'm behind in retail. This can be a fun way to play if your not so serious about it.
---
I read your post from a priest view and thought, hey crappy priest. Then I saw a reply below, and realized you're talking from a Druid view. You're so close to accurate it hurts.
---
I had a relaxed raiding guild for many years and recruitment is always a need and constant, more social play style tends to have people take breaks, burn out, quit alot more.
---
Everyone here hating on the av zerg. Like staying in the same Bg for an hour is fun, hell no
---
The important thing is to not cross them, it would be bad if you did.
---
I don't know if I really want to do the grind on my horde alt after breezing through so far on my alliance toon. Most of my groups don't bother with Galv, so the BGs are super short.
---
This is the exact opposite of my guild. Loot whores are gone rather quickly and we play not for the loot, but because we have a blast playing with each other. We got rid of our last loot drama person this week, and honestly, the guild is so much nicer without them. Imagine loot whoring in a game where we killed rag the 1st time we walked into MC. The loot will come. Relax.
---
Yeah, this whole min/max culture is kind of draining. I've enjoyed classic, but I'm not sure if I'll stick around much longer. It's hard to enjoy when everyone around you is all about min/maxing and you just feel like you're getting further and further behind. The minute you try and PvP or PvE with people min/maxing you just get wrecked. Luckily I don't mind getting carried so it doesn't weight on me too much.
---
However, it's easy/nice to be casual and raid because you only need to set aside one night. My guild is clearing Ony/MC in one night in under 3hrs. Not sure what will happen as more phases are released, but I'm glad I don't have to have 3-4 nights of 3-4hrs+ dedicated to WoW.
---
Okay so I guess I'm better of doing it in 2 weeks since top10 would be a bit too much. Thank you :)
---
Damn hopefully they fix it. Along with bartender. I kinda wanna try a new action bar addon anyways. I see some people with the same setup as me but their bars show cool down timers and gray out a little or turn red when not in range.
---
You care too much about a random neck beard on the internet playing the game... you're biased and holding him in higher regard than what he is. A Dude playing a video game.
---
Certainly. I've considered running a private server myself if classic ends up getting ruined in some way. The major concern is legal standing. It isn't technically all that hard to run a server.
---
I thought pally had free mounts?
---
Is there a BG holiday weekend this week? If so, when does it start and should be save our BG marks until then?
---
There is nothing fun about AV? It's just a PVE simulation of avoiding every enemy player as much as possible and run to the npc scripted boss at either at the bottom or the top of the map.
---
GM: I get about 10 hours of sleep
---
Guild Officer: I get about about 8 hrs
---
Veteran: I get about 4 hrs of sleep between play
---
Recruit: you guys get to sleep?
---
Oh hey there r/2007scape
---
Upping the server caps didn’t change individual player behavior. Yeah blizzard isn’t completely innocent in all this  since upping the caps allow a lot more surface area to be camped but to just simply blame it on them and act like there isn’t a huge culture problem going on where you’re expected to have “BiS” everything is ignoring the main point, which is player behavior. Honestly everyone on this subreddit is blaming blizzard 24/7 while everyone on the blizzard forums are blaming the community 24/7.  It’s like neither side want to believe they fucked up somewhere.
---
There is a RP cap but no rank caps.
---
The first 4 parses I'm near the top.  Then gear got shunted to the other mages now I'm near the bottom.  Seems pretty obvious to me, but I also don't care anymore.  The week before I got cut we split into 2 groups to do ony.  I was on what was clearly the B team, out of 8 officers in the guild we had 1.  We downed Ony first try.  The A team missed out on Ony loot that week after failing for almost 2 hours and giving in.
---
Then next week, I'm cut.
---
Also, by revered most people will probably have completed all the AV quests, instead or saving them to turn it at Revered.
---
A good wsg premade wins faster than a AV rush, sorry to break your bubble there buddy.
---
I disagree. Logout now, you've peaked.
---
my game has been experiencing this lag all morning where it looks like I completely DC (clicking a button to cast starts the cast but then it just doesn't do anything, Won't let me dismount, like the game is just running with no connection and about to time out) but my chat and global chat is still going in real-time so I am connected. It has been happening nonstop after being logged in for like 5 min it happens over and over and over and I have to keep force closing wow and reopening but it keeps happening
---
I think your reading comprehension is bad
---
Everyone leaving a guild, especially a raiding guild, are often in certain ways jerks. At least in the eyes of those that stays. With that in mind. A guild that barely raids or do other stuff together is barely a guild.
---
With that in mind, you should be clear to the guild why you leave and state it so they have a chance to handle the situation. A guild should always be able to handle the loss of players.
---
You have two options:
---
1. Pvp for fun 
---
2. Push for rank which means maximizing honor over anything else.
---
Welcome to the vanilla honor system with Classic server population and try hards.
---
I’m on Herod alliance and I agree there are toxic guilds but most people recognize where the idiots are and everyone in my guild is social, helpful, while still being competitive.
---
I imagine there are bad people anywhere you look, I’ve been grinding AV and certainly run into plenty of premades from other servers who seem to be full of negativity and elitism.
---
We can use more alliance, please consider our server, it’s quite healthy since the release of bgs
---
I always liked DME lashers
---
*Looking at my 40 demonic runes*
---
I need more?
---
I think u/Taelonius has it right. 2 sides, but both probably deserve some content. I think this sub is a little overrun with compaints, but not enough actual discussion, lot of finger pointing at Blizzard and each other
---
Now we play the game with people who identify as sexually confused military bases from Iraq.
---
r/brandnewsentence ?
---
Whoops, you’re right.
---
Have you ever heard the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise?  It's not a story the Jedi will tell you.
---
Alot if people are doing this tbh lol
---
or you could just fight back
---
I mean... did you see Kung Fu Panda?
---
In that analogy, the non-minmaxers go back to school dressed as a 15year old trying to blend in with all the kids even though they are full-grown adults.
---
Report AFK and rush!
---
Do you need to get it in a single week? The honor system punishes trying to progress a lot at once - In these coming weeks, I doubt 7 hours of wsg will be enough for 3 ranks. Maybe instead spread them out over 2-3 weeks? :)
---
Seems no one in this thread can read.
---
The hilarity
---
Which instance is this? My hunter with herb needs $$
---
lies. theres pvp every time you rush
---
If you can sell the ring that should be good profit alone in maraudon.
---
hardly 90%. Maybe 90% of the people on 10+ hours a day so they get more visibility
---
Just be like the colonel and get a shit bucket.
---
No idea. We should find out tonight if they're implemented at all and which one is first if they are (it should start at midnight thu-&gt;fri).
---
Because you want to write a Drama Time story for Preach.
---
Luck is one component, but the culmination of a multitude of items points to a large time commitment, statistically speaking. Note what's also in his bags - Lionheart Helm, BP of Chromatic Flight, Savage Glad Chest, he has both Striker's Mark AND Blastershot. Is that a Vis'kag? Could be Krol Blade. AND a cross-faction mount. As OP replied, he has &gt;40 days played. So it is time.
---
Such a grizzly joke he just couldn't bear it.
---
To defend big companies it’s just easier to manage and works 95% of time probably. Edge cases should be marked for manual resolution though and algorithms detecting frauds should always be improved
---
thank you for this
---
i'm here posting on reddit because i can't queue for another av for 9 more minutes because i was killing a lieutenant instead of being in drek's room.  :^)
---
This is kinda asking for one of those rage comics with a raider crying whilst being camped by a R14
---
Shadow reflector isn’t entirely necessary but it’s nice for that fight. Dense dynamite also helps a lot with the last boss. My warrior and I greed all the BoPs and I get the dark runes. We round robin crystals and split sale of big ticket items like forrors
---
I really suck at pvp. I don't think I've ever won a 1v1. I never got the hang of that thing melee do so that you just can't target and hit 'em. Even with mouse turning, I can't react fast enough to face correctly and get a hit off.
---
I'm just old. I'm in my late 30s. PVP is a teenager thing, I think. They think and react WAY faster than I can now (although I've never been that quick, I've never had the hyper twitchy reaction times that some people have).  Classic WoW raiding, dungeons, farming, and crafting is more my speed. I'm on a pve server in a fairly social guild, having a good time, and making connections with cool people. I'll never be one of the elite.
---
You can play AV without min/max.  It's very possible.  Defend a tower, defend the general.  Back cap.  Rushing with the zerg is not the only option.
---
Lol is that a pvp server?
---
Yeah, I had a hunter alt in vanilla, there's a lot of things you can do to mitigate. So I didn't mean it like a negative. &lt;3
---
A lot of WoW can be boring or irritating stuff but we grind through it to live through those amazing moments we love. I personally love the grind and pushing things to their limits or doing ridiculous things for sheer entertainment. I mean, I put crusader on a fish on my lvl 20 warrior for humor and I killed a horde rogue with it. This game is fun when you are open to it, just be open to it. Dominance gets repetitive and dull, but creative solutions to problems gets interesting and entertaining.
---
It makes a lot of sense on there tbh. It's crazy the disadvantage you have on there if you don't. You may think your are completely covered, but cut your settings down and you are literally out in the wide fucking open.
---
Ok so 'at all' was hyperbolic. Sure, I'm slowing down 39 players slightly, maybe they win in 12 minutes not 10.
---
But I never get to play AV normally.
---
&gt; It's not a one-way problem, it's a two way.
---
Sure, but to me there's seems to be far more shit coming my way than being sent their way.  
---
P2 lead to every 48+ zone being completely unplayable for anything but zerg PvP.  
---
BGs are just rep/honor grinds.
---
I'm sure that sometimes the hardcore min-maxers are inconvenienced when I accidentally get in their dungeon group and it takes 20-30 minutes longer. For that I apologise.
---
But I'd like to be able to queue up for a normal game of AV. Apparently that's not possible and likely won't be.
---
Probably not. But I'm not going to sit here picking out every individual that plays the game like a moron am I?
---
Blame the toxic 2019 efficiency OCD meta slaves for destroying your game.
---
Mage in my guild got ram last night. Its out.
---
which fight do you mean exactly?
---
Well you stack spirit, you get spirit tap and you only wand to finish a mob while letting the 5sec rule play out, so when you get spirit tap - you are gaining full effect.  
---
Just youtube hydra priest leveling.
---
Reroll a different class because finding groups for dungeons as a rogue is near impossible.
---
Sorry, people organized enough to get 25 people in the same AV can figure out basic math. You're full of shit.
---
I ran 3 AVs and got in one fight that was 5 vs 1. No deaths, just farming mobs
---
You realize you're arguing for longer que times? How does that make sense? Either way Blizzard has the numbers and waiting to do content just leads to people quitting.
---
So you don’t really like to PvP, you just want to PvE while using the PvP rewards? Got it.
---
Did you read my comment at all? I never shat on people who min-maxed, nor do I get mad when I "get stomped in pvp". I just said that I min-max so that I don't get stomped...
---
* You don't understand, something something competitive.  
---
* If you don't completely blow though all new content and run it so many times that you hate it within the first 48 hours your a [scrub, noob, casual, etc]
---
* If you aren't min/maxing, you might as well not be playing
---
* Ok boomer  
---
It's too early for me to come up with more responses you'll likely see.
---
Can't get camped on a PVE server bro
---
I feel a large portion of people complaining should just take a month off from the game.
---
Could grind for dal rends swords.
---
woosh
---
This is going to be a bit of rant to pass on some knowledge to help fellow pallies. This is a perspective of a holy paladin. Here is my brain dump, if think something is wrong or could be better please comment below **it only helps the community**
---
**Get GEAR:**
---
First and foremost the for paladin the BiS guides, they give you a baseline, but that is pretty much it. Instead of telling you what your BiS is I am going to teach anyone that reads this how to pick out your BiS. As a Paladin you can wear any level of armor. cloth, leather, plate, and depending on the activity you are doing different things are better! 
---
For pve, Crit Chance &gt; mp5 &gt; Intel, The reason for this is  you want crit chance over anything else, the illumination skill is no joke,, it AWESOME! Mp5 will help you maintain your mana pool also since you are constantly casting as holy. Lastly intel gives you a larger mana pool and every 54 points in intel gives you 1% crit chance!
---
For pvp, Stamina &gt; armor &gt; intel, The reason for this is that pally can wear plate and absorb hits from casters due to a high heath pool. After that having more mana is icing on the cake! You become the bane of everyones existance,, a healer with plate and tough to kill...
---
When picking gear think of this items carefully and pick. For pve I personally think crit chance is 10x more important than the other stats and same for stamina in pvp. Make this character how you want it to be not what someone tells you it should be, **even if it means ignoring my advise above**.
---
**Learn Playstyle:**
---
Holy pally is a very complex character, the best thing to do is to learn its tools over time.

There is a massive skill cap beyond just spamming flash of light. For example: At this moment what should i change my aura? Who needs what blessing? Is a cooldown coming up? Is an alley running out of buffs? Should i change seals? Holy light, flash of light, holy shock next? Should holy shock hit the enemy or an ally? Does someone need a bubble?  Are we going to whipe should I kill myself by using divine intervention?
---
You get the idea and this can be daunting. Start small add things on over time and you will kick butt in the long run. Nuff said.
---
**Community**
---
Last thing I want to say is people love having pallies on there team. Two of the most important words I will say are to follow. **Create friends**. Try and find people that you like playing with and do so regularly. Sometimes they even seek you out. I did this and I have people asking me to join them every night I log on.
---
If you see someone and you have mana, drop a buff as you are walking by, people love you for this. When you are in towns your mana should NEVER be full as a priest, mage, druid, or pally. This makes our community,, a community!

Yes but the alternative is getting less honour for your win - in which case your standing will be lower due to WSG premades and groups that do decide to lose for more honour.
---
So no, you're not entirely correct.
---
You know what I miss? Huttball from that Star Wars mmo. Just the best mix of pvp, 3rd person combat mmo mechanics, and competitive game mode. Too bad that game just died out :(
---
This is how horde wins now. 
---
Basically you can only have strats in pugs that revolve around yelling simple orders to people. 
---
So alliance all yells rush drek. And horde is just like kill the slow mounts. And then it’s a 30 minutes slog. 
---
Why horde is incapable of winning in 8 minutes like alliance and getting this shit over with I don’t know. They spawn closer to the final guy and should be able to just rush him down. But nah let’s kill the alliance so they turtle and the game takes 3x as long.
---
Run live with orbs on res. Or pick up herbing or mining.
---
If anything that's the worst part. If it was just people grinding to Exalted I assume the majority would just stop after a few weeks.
---
But people who want to honor farm are going to be in there PvE rushing forever.
---
Gotta farm alanna's embrace. 20sta/int/spi/spellpower.
---
&gt; If they actually wanted to optimize, they'd be in a high tier mythic+ guild optimizing clears and producing content. They don't. But they do want purpose from something, and in this case, it's revisiting old content for the sake of fulfillment.
---
mythic optimization and classic speedclearing are 2 totally different mindset tho.
---
mythic raids offer new encounter, new mechanic, stuff that has never been beaten before and even playing optimally, you are second away from a hard enrage timer ( or a crazy tough overlap)... you optimize the sh*t out of your raid cause you need it to beat the raid.
---
However nobody optimize to clear content in classic; the content is easy, thousand of guild are clearing it, your alt are clearing it, Killing Rag is kind of the norm on your 2nd or 3rd week in MC... so people optimize to speedclear it; skipping pack, shaving seconds of a kill by using sappers... it's a different mindset.
---
I don't know any mythic raider interested in split raiding in Classic, even if they do 4/5 splits on retail.
---
*zing*
---
I did the last two as shadow, yeah thanks I'd rather heal.
---
Most people do not want old AV, only the loud ones on social media do.
---
Proof that in your 30s you can still be infantile
---
This, how can you not be showered in Loot as the MT? Also they need you more then ever. So stacking up the MT should be prio no. 1. Otherwise you won’t be progressing.
---
I'm not saying it's not possible. I am definitely inclined to believe that too
---
Thought the premades only in AV is the meta for alliance now?
---
I knew months before launch happened.  I just didn't expect it to be this fucking bad.  Skip everything kill drek.
---
You can only do as well as the rest of your raid, really. It's about the uptime of important cooldowns like (for rogues like myself) blade flurry, adrenaline rush, and blood fury, among others. If a boss dies so quickly Ad Rush hasn't ended, you're going to be dealing a lot more damage per second than if you press all the right buttons but have to slog through 2-minute boss kills.
---
I really liked the multi day tug of war AV. Definitely one of my fondest memories of vanilla. It felt like an epic siege, whether you were pushing through Frostwolf Keep inch by bloody inch or defending the Dun Baldar bridge. 
---
Not sure if I went back a lot after exalted, but it was still pretty grand and a defining memory of vanilla for me.
---
It can be if you're an elite premade that is absolutely stomping PUGs. But even then it's probably just barely better.
---
"Modernization! But no changes!"
---
You can do whatever. I did a bunch of games last night. I’m still riding a poverty pony so it’s basically impossible for me to contribute to the push, since I fall behind and get picked off. I got the ice barbed spear and spent multiple games just training up my pole arm skill on harpies. I think I lost one game all night. It was a good time (for alliance).
---
The groups before beast kicked our asses, and then beast also did :D
---
The only people calling for rep nerfs are folks that are already exhalted.  Aint exactly fair for the others.
---
I think this will change in a couple of weeks though.
---
Based on this entire sub since launch, he was right all along.
---
OP is a troll, nothing to see here.
---
You'd be right if it weren't for WSG premades.
---
Hit at 6% is what you want to aim for as prot warrior iirc. You need to hit with everything possible to build rage
---
Because when you don't hit, it really sucks.
---
I actually enjoy defending Galv, back capping towers, defending towers, etc. I know I’m the minority but I feel like PvP with an objective is actually fun. Fun is subjective for sure, and most private server babies just wanna efficiently suck the fun out of the game, and I’ll never understand  why, but hey that’s show biz baby.
---
Well that's simply not true.  There's minor differences.
---
No, you need rank, which is obtained through honor contribution, honor itself is not a resource, its a point system used to determine your place in a ladder, determining on how much toward the next rank you gain (its weighed vs everyone else on your server in your faction). Once you obtain a rank, you can purchase gear with gold.
---
He's Horde, right? Whether he's afk or not you lose. GG.
---
As someone who plays on Yojamba, I can kind of attest to this. I can't think of many complete wankers on Yojamba. We have our celebrities here but mostly it feels like a dad gamer server. I raid with some boomers every week and man I fucking love it, best time I've had in WoW since I started back in 2008-ish.
---
based on "Guide to Reckoning V2 (Current 1.10)"  
---
The following things can cause you to drop your charges:  
---
* Ending a Duel   
---
* Mounting up (including gryphons)   
---
* Autoattacking too early (e.g. from out of range)   
---
* Switching Continents   
---
* Switching Weapons   
---
* Losing control of your character (Fear, Scattershot, Blind, Polymorph, Mind Control, etc.)   
---
And I've done several tests. What I can confirm now is:  
---
Mount won't drop reckoning in 1.13.3  
---
Switching Continents and Switching Weapons will correctly drop your reckoning even before 1.13.3  
---
CC won't dorp your reckoning. However, CC with autoattacking on (/startattack) DO drop your reckoning(tested sheep and fear, stun won't drop your reckoning which is the same with 1.10)
---
Autoattacking from out of range won't drop your reckoning. However, autoattacking from out of range while get another crit DO drop your reckoning.
---
For horde priests are the only defensive dispeller, for alliance they're the only offensive dispeller (not counting felhunter in either case), so they're invaluable to organized pvp.
---
Maybe the thermometer has a left and a right button
---
Bosses are higher level than you at 60. Its scaled to work well at level 60
---
Just death rolls lots on your major hubs most popular area and spread the word when you do.
---
Why would I invest potentially hundreds of hours farming a drop that I might not even win the roll on, when I can spend that time PvPing? Thats the type of marginal min-max that just isn't worth doing.
---
There are tons of them here on reddit out in the open... they defend the spy addon viciously.
---
&gt; At the end of the day - if someone isn't having fun, they'll quit playing; so accusing anyone who's still playing classic of "not having fun" just because they aren't playing your version of "fun classic" is silly. 
---
Here is where the whole thing breaks down, though. No one is accusing min/maxers of not having fun just because they aren't playing how I play. We're accusing them of that because they seem fucking miserable. Constantly bitching during AV. Constantly whining that their BiS hasn't dropped yet. Reporting people for doing things in game because it's not optimized.
---
Honestly, a lot of you people need to just move on. WoW doesn't make you happy anymore but you continue playing because you have nothing else or maybe just because it's where your only friends are. But it's sad to watch.
---
Thanks for the input!!
---
&gt; nothing of that makes any sense at all
---
You know there is other things to do outside raid night ya? PvP, dungeons, exploring, crafting, gold making and so many other things you can do together.
---
For Hunter it’s bloodseeker. Because it’s BiS till Rhok’Delar. Spear is nice but there are better options before raiding. Like Barbarous Blade from DM:N.
---
Have you ever been in a six hour AV? That stuff happens and I have bills to pay.
---
No one here is speaking about reputation.
---
Had a 50 minute one last night, good honor, not so much for rep.
---
Ruining stuff for others, heh fun
---
Yeah, it's a great game, but very time-consuming!
---
well put! I'd expand and say that thelling other players to stop minmaxing is a really stupid argument, but asking other players to tell me that I,should minmax is a valid argument.
---
there's the hardcore end of the input distribution, and some exponents of the extreme minmaxing culture are shitting on casuals because they dont play the game alao in the minmaxed way. then there's the casual end of the input distribution, and some exponents of the extreme casual culture shitting on minmaxers because they don't play the game also in the casual way.
---
both types of players are toxic d*cks and should stop forinc the others to see it their way. yes it's an MMORPG, so you can't avoid interaction with the other side (e.g. in AVs), but your side is no more right than the other side.
---
Do you understand the problem when i’m the only tank you got, but i’m essentially a DPS wearing a shield.
---
Even though ive been asking for stamina, and there’s 5+ priests at times, and ive stated i will tank, yet no one can bother?
---
What happens when you have like 1-2 tanks, and due to Horde turteling, they get caught and killed on their way down?
---
That’s right, you have people crying at Drek’thar that it’s a lost game because you lack tank.
---
Maybe i should’ve put more emphasis on it.
---
I know you can’t buff everyone, atleast not without reagents.
---
But then buff the ”key” classes, this case the tanks, since AV is between 80-100% PvE.
---
So would the +36 sp monocle top a +1% crit headband given the conversation factor provided?
---
Just did that, pretty nice, but I'm already going to be the same (disc) spec for pve and pvp for the foreseeable future anyway.
---
There is so much to do end game.  I dinged over 2 months ago and last night was completing my UBRS key chain.  Seriously, there is so much to do.
---
Exactly, youre spouting nonsense
---
Personally I enjoy the tears because I could barely level since honor hit (still at 53 atm..). So people afking in AV is good for the open world at least.
---
You know what.. you have a point.
---
Until then, casuals are forced to play AV the way min/maxers play or we get kicked.
---
Me and my brother coordinate "join first available", press at the same time, then he tells me what number he got, if we got the same we join, if we got different we re-queue.  
---
Only done it like 3-4 times so far, but 1 time we had to re-queue 1 time.
---
Choose your action op
---
The honor you get from AV is so much more than you could get out in the world.
---
If you don't care so much about rankings, you could just Grind reputation from AV.
---
Once you're exalted you should also have the rank 3 PvP discount and can buy the AV epic mount for (650?) Gold.
---
Wait, they closed bg for a week.?
---
So you understand Honor and that you get rewards depending on what Honor Rank you currently have (1-14)
---
Battleground (AV, WSG and AB) give Honor as well as Reputation to their relating faction.
---
Getting Reputation in AV is very easy. For Warsong and Arathi Basin it is a lot harder tbh.
---
Those also have Reputation vendors where you can get awesome rewards too.
---
You gotta check out what they sell online - I don't know it off the top of my head.
---
But in AV (which is easy) you can get an epic Mount when you are exalted. It is the same Price AFAIK. But it is quite rare right now so go for it :P
---
It is an expression from old rts games which means you would build a huge base with defenses and such.
---
the first fight was a shadowburn crit, the dc went into his ice barrier @ the other fight no dc crited I cannot find what you are saying sorry.
---
I’ve gotten one since being able to mine rich thorium. It’s been 2 months.
---
They started cracking down on advertising gambling through public chat channels at some point in wrath, would be surprised if they just let it go on in classic.
---
The saddest part about this statement is that it's completely logical.  The honor system is so bad (especially combined with this version of AV) that it literally rewards people for not PvPing.  What a joke.
---
I would say no.
---
and it always has been
---
I'm mind of there with you at this point. I've had fun, and I definitely want to get into AQ and Naxx. But honestly I'm just not having a great time waiting for that point.
---
I more and more realize why I enjoyed BC so much more than Vanilla. I'm happy that Classic exists for sure, but with the way everything is played now, it's just not for me as much.
---
Yeah, after thinking about it I realized that it's good to get to drain life faster, so it's still strong. Just wish it were better described.
---
It's based upon experience. The majority of the time, if there is a split in the group, horde will attack whoever is split. Now you're fighting horde backed up by archers and npc's. 
---
You make some large assumptions that people will take certain gy's, leave others, not run off and afk, quest, take certain objectives, etc... The reality is, it's easier to issue one simple set of commands that you hope 50% of the people can make it south. There is no ultimate authority here, you don't have the ability to force people to follow your strat. But, people do understand what they've seen work. What they've seen work is a fullish southern rush. Then they've seen the risky strat of splitting for the extra kill. 
---
My experience has been, if people are playing during off hours, they're generally a more "hardcore" player. That generally equates to people who want a fast game. That means they don't turtle, and primarily play pve. You can do your strat then.
---
However, the exact opposite has been true in my experience during peak hours. Horde run an intercept party, boss room defence, and mid map skirmishes.this is when the majority of players are going. 
---
So you can say all you want that people don't know anything. I do know one thing though, a 6 minute win is a hell of a lot better than a 45-60 minute strugglebus because communications are teppid, orders are optional, and you're likely to arrive south with a small group left.
---
Yeah, 71-80.  Also some of my alts skipped TBC content, because I started doing AV as soon as I could.
---
Stuff with higher stats and lower healing is usually good for pvp if you're into that.
---
People do it all the time on my server and after awhile people just know you deathroll if you stand in the same spot
---
In pve it is.
---
I didn't mean av (it is tho) I meant the honor race
---
It is absolutely essential in Vanilla PVP. You unfortunately did not get a lot of experience with this because WPVP was probably less active on your server. But basically you will find yourself in big open spaces with no LoS about 80%+ of the time. It is therefore essential to have someone in the back lines AS WELL as in the forward line in order to mitigate the fact that the person in the forward line is a sitting duck.
---
Yes, or is that not allowed by the fun police?
---
Where am i complaining that we don’t win AV’s?
---
I said we’ve had matches where we came like 3-5 seconds short of winning, and buffs could’ve been the difference.
---
That was merely an example, on how buffs can help, not a complaint on how alliance never wins BG’s etc.
---
Because that would obviously not be a reasonable complaint.
---
Surely you’re not that stupid?
---
The only color I see is big yellow.
---
n O c H a N g E s
---
How does that work?
---
Think again
---
This is what I dont get about the bitching about AV. It's not the *players* fault that blizzard released a bg where the most efficient way to win is to just zerg the boss. AV is not fun because of blizzard, not the players.
---
Ironically, you can still do an hours-long turtle. It's just that nobody wants to.
---
I saved them but idk about most people
---
Well^^you^^done^^fucked^^up^^then
---
Because some of us want to win, don’t care if we aren’t min maxing, and like to have fun???
---
I have won the last 4 AVs as horde from just forming a group to wipe ally at drek after we kill bal and commanders. We win a good 15 mins after and its much more fun then honoring farming the commanders and bal and losing in 6 minutes.
---
I have got 7times the off hand glaive so i feel the pain
---
You can just turn in that quest where you queue for AV in hillsbrad/av
---
Any ideas on how to approach this with a guild newer to raiding without seeming like an asshole? I've been de facto picked as our MT due to skill and gear, but the current idea is to let people that haven't received loot open roll. Last week a Drillborer went to our 4th tank and I'm struggling to see how that's of any benefit to anyone but him.
---
as someone who did R14 in vanilla just fucking deal with it, its what we did back then as well
---
you either do AV or rank slower/not at all
---
Sorry I wanna play with my guild, and they dont get deserter unless you kick in the tunnel. We dont do that
---
Disagree rep rewards diminish at revered it's halfway in numbers only not time investment
---
I'm horde and trying to get the mutants on my side to actually defend and not just let the Alliance win is so damn tough.  Whatever happened to the Horde who didnt want the Alliance to get jack shit? Why are we essentially working as a team together to farm rep/honor?
---
I totally agree than min/maxing has ruined AV, atleast for the short term.  I truly dont understand why people would rather have a 7m loss than a 20-30m win.  I get it, it isnt efficient for rep farming or honor farming, but what happened to good ol pride?  A loss is a loss is a loss, IDGAF if we "GoT mOrE HoNoR THo"
---
STV gun?
---
At 35 I think I am the oldest in my guild.  It is very very strange.  Some of the memes and slang are strange but I'm figuring them out.  I would really like to see a poll on how old people are playing WoW classic and what they want out of it.
---
Should be a 3 month ban for abusing the report system.
---
Shouldn't even really be in the game in the first place but I digress.
---
Perhaps blizzard should start handing out more punishment and hire more GM staff to get the particularly cancerous part of the Classic player base under control.
---
i like how our only tool to stop this is a gm ticket, but hey this was the response to my second ticket  [https://imgur.com/Eo0HfDe](https://imgur.com/Eo0HfDe)  Blizzard, you are terrible at everything
---
You can't really have raids above naxx itemization.  They pretty much cap how the game works with mechanics in vanilla.
---
You can, however, have 2-3 raids that have off spec gear/sets and minor upgrades.
---
The issue is, the first new content needs to take place around the AQ40 tier.
---
There are plenty of holes in itemization at current endgame even if you farm AQ40/Naxx till your heart is content.
---
You could fix some of the issues with alt specs with set bonus' on new tier pieces.
---
Alliance-Skeram.
---
Just stack all damage/healing and high int/Stam and maybe a few tier pieces. Should be enough to heal people. As feral I use all feral gear and then t2 helm/legs and a healing weapon for a bigger Mana pool and some extra healing.
---
I was out in burning steppes last night and this warlock ran up to me, dismounted inches from my face. 
---
I clenched my cheeks but went with my default action. I /greeted him.
---
He /waved at me.
---
We /hugged each other at the same time.
---
He then went about his business elsewhere.
---
Thanks for saying it.
---
When I want to grind rep I go AV.
---
When I want to PVP I go warsong.
---
When I want to properly PVP I go Arathi basin in the far future
---
Have any proof? I remember it just cancelling the trap out like it does now.
---
Alcors razer or whatever its called got master looted lastnight in a bg i was in
---
“Top 10 in standing” is slightly incorrect. Ranking brackets are percentile based so it depends on how many other PvPers are on your server. You are at 22500 RP and will lose 20% of your current RP at the end of the week taking you to 18,000. You need 30,000 to hit R8 which means you need to be in the top 0.3% of active PvPers to gain enough RP this week. If there are 3333 active PvPers, then the top 10 would get 12000+ RP. If you are on a large server there will be substantially more people in the top bracket though.
---
&gt;That's some pretty incomplete logic you've got there.
---
No, it really isn't, it just goes against the circlejerk.
---
&gt;In MC each boss drops just 2 epics drawn from a pool of close to 20 pieces and there's no guarantee that either of those epics will even be for your class/spec and on the off-chance they are something good for you then you'll be vying for it against 15~25 people.
---
Yes, it may take a few weeks of doing trivial content two hours a week to start getting top tier gear.
---
&gt;In LFR the bosses die and a quarter of the raid is given loot for their class and spec straight to their bags.
---
Yes, bad loot. Not worth considering for *actual use*.
---
&gt;You're also ignoring the existence of items like savage gladiator's chain, hand of justice, felstriker
---
Because you can easily ignore them and do just fine in the highest level of content in classic. Because classic has no challenge.
---
&gt;In retail you can play for 2 hours and walk out with 2~3 epics from world quests and your weekly chest will spit out ilvl upgrades like crazy.
---
World quests drop trash tier gear. Your bitching literally just comes down to the color of the pixels in the name. The weekly chest is not trash tier gear, but it is one piece per week chosen totally at random from a pool of *all* of the current items.
---
&gt;Classic it takes time and effort to get decked out in good epics
---
It really, really doesn't. You can get into a guild on totally mediocre pre-raid gear, and once there it's two hours a week of no effort to start the trickle of gear. It may take a few months, but a few months of two hours a week with no effort. I know from experience, because I've been raidlogging for quite a while now.
---
It's also dishonest to compare getting items like sgc to LFR.  The difference between LRF and Mythic gear in retail is bigger than the difference between dungeon gear and MC gear in Classic for many classes. You're comparing the effort required to get good epics in classic with the effort to get trash throwaway epics in retail. The only reason you even mention the shitty lfr gear is because of the color of the name LOL.
---
Make it 3 months and you have a deal.
---
People maliciously and systematically abusing the system and game need to be made accountable for their actions.
---
The pops are a good point, that's fair, and would go a long way to explaining the difference, because, and this is just a gut feeling really, I'd imagine there are still a lot of casuals around relative to min-maxers on a given server. And sure, the casuals, by nature of their approach to the game, need sheer numbers to push back against the min-maxer influence. 
---
But, and while you're right that you're free to pursue the game how you want, the fact is that unless a whole AV, in this case, responds to a group of people forcing a turtle, no one gets the kind of BG that some of us have fond memories of. Now, it'll happen, hell, it happened last night in one of the handful of AVs where I was disrupting the zerg and was a blast. But the fact still remains that vanilla's open-ended nature is limited by the way that min-maxers tend to skew the meta pretty heavily. Not much to be done because you can't tell someone how to play, but it's still the reality. 
---
Another example is the death squads, there were a ton of casuals that straight couldn't play their 48-50s characters for almost a month if they were on a poorly balanced server. That's not playing the game how you want. 
---
At a certain point I know it sounds like whining, but it's just not the reality that the game is a free to play to whatever extent you like if you're resisting things like the AV zerg meta. You can do things to get it closer, but even in the AV I mentioned earlier, there were people salty that the zerg got busted bitching the whole time. In almost every AV, while you're waiting behind the gate, you get a wall of text/spam (to the point any other chat is unreadable) to varying degrees of begging or demanding that everyone just suck it up and zerg "because I want it now and then you can have what you want."
---
I'm ready for the down-vote storm. But it had to be said.
---
I'd argue its corporate interests that's causing this to be anything but an emergency issue to be tackled immediately. Her being a pawn is patronizing and is just a sad attempt at silencing the issue. The oil industry REALLY doesn't want to be held responsible for dooming this planet, and they really want to keep their profits going so they can get as much as possible before the bubble bursts. They've got the money to pay to keep the industry going. A tune to which the corrupt are more than willing to dance to.
---
It's not about actual AFKing.
---
If 5 people report you as AFK then you're instantly booted from the match.
---
People keep abusing it to open space for their friends to join or just for the hell of it.
---
Fucking Star Ruby
---
agreed
---
There is still a clear pattern in people who consistently are top, or bottom. I've seen a lot of lousy players who underperform every single raid while hoarding items and simultaneously claiming 'parses dont matter anyway!'.
---
You owe nobody anything in life dude. Learn this, free yourself, and be happy.
---
BGs didn't exist at first in vanilla either.
---
&gt;useless people
---
The "serious rankers"?
---
Lol please keep commenting. You make yourself sound even more like a fool each time you do
---
So, if you go that route I'd do something like this (I use this site because it lists the talents in order):
---
https://www.bobo-talents.com/?c=priest&amp;t=vjvkvlvmvnvqvwvxvrvvvtvQv0v1v2v3C8C9C_C.C~wgvYv4vUv9vVv7vgvCvDvovfvEvFvGvHvuDeDfDgDhC-DaDbDcDdDip
---
If you are on a pvp server, I would swap out 2 points in mental agility for mana burn, and swap all instances of power word fort with martyrdom. I would also swap imp. renew with blessed recovery. 
---
Healing focus is the #1 healing talent for non-raid priests. It is still good for raid priests, just not #1. For any kind of pvp or small group healing, it's an absolute must-take. Depending on how much group healing you plan on doing vs. solo content, I would *very heavily consider* taking 2 points in healing focus and 3 points in holy spec as your first 5 talents in holy; and then finishing out holy spec at 32/33.
---
Inspiration is a raid-only talent IMO. I would not bother with it for leveling, it's pretty situational, the buff isn't huge, and you can't proc it consistently.
---
There are a few issues with the build that you need to consider though. One, if you plan on doing any significant amount of solo content, you will *really* still want to put the 5 points in spirit tap. It is just so good, and kinda hard to pass up, even though it puts you 5 points behind in the rest of your progression. If you know you can avoid a lot of solo content, and will mostly be duo or group, *only then* would I recommend not taking spirit tap. It is very, very powerful for solo.

Second, I don't think rushing inner focus and then switching to holy is a great strategy. It's a good ability, but not a real splashy leveling talent. Instead, I would swap to holy immediately after getting wand spec so that you can get the really good holy damage talents (which is the core of the smite spam build), or I would stick with disc all the way to PI so that you can get power infusion early. Power infusion is such an insane ability, and will make crazy aoe pulls on the mage much, much easier; while also being extremely good for pvp.
---
If you plan on having ANY amount of solo grinding/questing, I would rush holy after wand spec (or possibly after spirit tap, depending on how much you will be solo), if you plan on exclusively grouping, I would rush PI.
---
This is a silly argument if it's not an exaggeration. Your friend out doing 60s at 56 is an outlier, and a crazy one at that. 
---
The fact he'd have gone barely a level and managed to pick up his two prebis weapons &amp;&amp; had gold to burn for double crusader says he's either buying gold and insanely lucky, or he's min maxing on a level the 'try hards' don't even compare to.
---
He's not a fair representation of 56s and acting like him not getting dungeon spots is some kind of huge mistake is just strange.
---
He's a unicorn if he's not benefitting from grand exaggeration, and it's not unreasonable a group wouldn't want to bring some random person who'd likely leech the whole way.
---
It's all good, I communicated unclearly. I've been playing since Vanilla and my keybinds essentially haven't changed since I first rebound everything. If I don't know 'em by now, I never will and the more buttons and random bullshit I have on screen, the more distractions I have from moving out of the fire :p
---
There's something so amazing about topping up the warriors and rogues followed by dishing out a big Chain Lightning crit.
---
Classic is a wonderful game isn't it.
---
Differences of opinion.  You say the community is ruining the game,  I say they are improving it.  You enjoy wasting hours playing the game inefficiently.  I enjoy being efficient and reaching my goals as quickly as possible.  The reality is that neither position is right or wrong.  The one thing that is true though,  is that the game is different now,  and why wouldn't it be?  It's been nearly 15 years since AV originally launched.  This is how the game plays out these days after a decade of gameplay and strategy refinements. The people expecting a 2005-06 style vanilla experience simply dont understand the effect of meta-creep. If you go back and look at Counter-Strike or Starcraft meta from 2005 it look very different from today. The same applies to sports or chess or pretty much any other competitive endeavor. It's impossible to freeze a game in time and expect the meta not to shift as people's understanding of mechanics and strategy develops.
---
How about you are wasting his time when he has to queue for 75 AV's just to find a single one that's actually any fun
---
Every rank except the first one is previous + 5000 RP, Max RP you can get is 13000 ish, So you can theoretically skip 2 ranks in a week.  
---
That said, decay on rank 5+ will prevent you from skipping 2 ranks. Decay on rank 9+ will prevent you from skipping any ranks
---
Okey you guys are really pushing me to play classic ! Stahp ! I have pharmacology exam next week :’(
---
&gt; "I played a couple hours and I'm revered"
---
lol ok
---
It's not hard to solo if you prepare properly. Guys, don't cheese the best priest quest in the game. It's so satisfying when you earn it yourself!
---
The AP system fixed people being bored and not having a constant goal to work toward.
---
PvP rank offer a blue set as well as an epic set at higher ranks, those set are a mishmash of all stats which means they aren't good for a healer, can be good for a an healer/feral hybrid.
---
BG rep offer different rewards based on the rep (honored, revered, exalted), AV rep is very easy to grind to exalted and offer a very good off-hand for healer  [https://classicdb.ch/?item=19312](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19312) \+ you can buy the AV mount for 640g once exalted saving you a bunch of gold.
---
Warsong rep is a far longer grind but reward you with a good ring, cloak and bracer.
---
You can check here the rewards for each Rep :

&gt;[*I'm shocked!*](https://gph.is/15yxaLe)
---
If only you could see if they have 100% mount too you could kick all the slow poors too. Reddit pls find a way.
---
And you can't play with your guild the next round, which is literally 10 min in the current meta? You really have to kick them and waste their time?
---
I need this template for science.
---
Who caresssssss
---
Mining ooze covered thorium veins, the bugs covered them in their ooze so it's theirs, but you took it...so you stole the rocks from bugs...
---
Like Mindshattered said.
---
AFK'ing is not even a Problem tbh.
---
It is the premades that abuse the Report function and Report you when you actually try to do something in AV which is anything besides "Kill Drek"...
---
Some premades even Report you just for not being in their premade so they can get as many of their own in the BG as possible... 
---
What jerks to be honest... Some People just want to see the world #burn^^TM
---
That’s exactly what is meant by reflecting trap... you reflect the incoming spell with sr or ground it with grounding totem. Net result is the same thing, spell is cancelled out. Sorry, think I had interpreted the above wrong, cause looked like you were trying to say that you couldn’t sr a trap.
---
I picked the spear because it vendors for 7g.
---
I'll keep using the nicker.
---
bearing in my warriors are hybrids:
---
tank warriors get shield + raing
---
dps/pvp warriors get 2h mace + ring
---
What you guys think, just got medallion of grand marshal Morris as a drop and it’s pre raid BIS for tanks, leveling a warrior who’s 48 right now. Should I sell it for mount money or keep it as a bis tank item?
---
Pallies too :)
---
I mean, 54 traits was pretty damn important in NH for progression on Krosus and others. You can't argue there weren't break points that weren't vital for raiding which required you to clear the world of AP every day. You may not needed to live inside Maw of Souls to do mythic, but at the end of the day it didnt really matter the exact week on when you got all your traits. It did matter eventually, but it just turned into a binary pre raid check to raid like having your legendary cape in MoP
---
It's funny because this will always happen but I think in the long run this is why turtles happen lolol
---
Sucubbus give a lot of trouble but its all perspective, dreadlord is the biggest problem since its beyond the eye, its painful and it reduces you to a worthless version of yourself while you just stand there and watch unable to fight.
---
Some people just wan't to watch the world burn.
---
I had a good game like this too. Even summoned lok the ice lord.
---
Much more fun than just zerging to vanndar
---
Theres no way to get everyone in without kicking
---
Elemantal shaman here.
---
Can confirm.
---
Staysafe rolling 15 man pvp thinking he's hot shit lmaoooo
---
Warlocks are probably the best class to solo farm dungeons when you reach 60. If you get minning and herb, you can easily farm close to 70g/h in DM east. I have a friend who's warlock and does jump runs with me but he can easily do it on his own, he just does it with me to help me farm gold.
---
I usually just say I am a healpriest and it works fine.
---
Dungeons are piss easy anyway and you just throw some bandages here and there and all good ^^^^/s
---
That was pretty much my night last night.  Funny thing about the 7 to 10 minute runs is the other side has to play along too or it doesn't work.  
---
What made it comically terrible was the people trying to force the 10 minute runs.  They just kept trying to stay mounted and not fight, while everyone around them got picked off.   It's one of the stupidest things I think I've seen in WoW.  Lemmings comes to mind.
---
Almost every AV ended with no win and almost no honor 20-25 minutes later.
---
Exactly. If I pull threat on something. That's *my* mob now. I'm taking him on an adventure.
---
Sunder is shit threat, its a filler ability if everything else is on cooldown AND you have enough rage to use it.
---
Offtanks &amp; fury warriors should sunder first global on pull while the maintank uses his globals smarter.
---
I wish shit players would learn themselves instead of further contribute to misconceptions.

The reason my ranking team had to ditch WSG is because AV grants alot more honor than a WSG  
---
During the time we do 1 WSG, you would have gained 2x the honor in AV.   
---
We play on Firemaw, which is a very big server, there is alot of competition and everyone is just spamming AV, so if WE don't do the same we won't be able to get a good standing weekly and fall behind by playing WSG.
---
imagine having respect for a streamer
---
lmao
---
As a PvEr alliance side, first night of AV was a lot of fun because both sides avoided PvP almost entirely. Last night was not fun for me because of all the horde trying to push PvP in mid and messing with alliance at Drek, dragging games out to 15 minutes-20 minutes every time.
---
 I've had some what you would call "nice fights" with 2-3 of us pushing back against groups of 4-5, because I play a healer. But it's not fun when very few other people assist and I'm easy pickings when caught alone as a healer. I have noticed a lot fewer healers in AV last night compared to the first day, too.
---
I pvp in Pve combat swords because I'm too lazy to farm gold for respecs. You essentially play as a squishy fury warrior and even though I'm pretty geared I can 1v1 anyone except a human rogue or a frost mage.
---
Its around 500 rep for a win, 42000 needed for exalted.
---
Thats 82 wins for exalted. If you do 10min per Win, 6 per Hour. Thats a 14hour grind.
---
I just watched a video on how a guy got his epic mount in a day death rolling and I’m just in a mood to try it out to see if i can get lucky. So far nobody on my server death rolls but I’d like to start a guild that gains rep so people know it’s safe
---
This is me lol. Yet 12 raids and 0 upgrades, you gotta question what you are doing as a priest lol
---
i play alliance on pve and when i see a tauren it always warms my heart :)
---
Classic! 👐
---
na, this version of AV is complete dogshit
---
ive played a ton of korrak's revenge so that's where my mind has been regarding AV for the past month.  i've had a decent amount of fun in it because towers are important so you actually solo influence games a lot with clever backcaps (so many knockbacks) or small skirmishes.  i went into classic AV for the first time and it was actually disgusting how bare bones it was in comparison.  thought i would get some rep grinding out of the way but i gave up after one 10 minute game and went back to leveling alts in korrak's.
---
I fish in AV, AMA
---
to ostracize people who don't want to follow the other 39's strat in AV. yes.
---
people were also jerk in 2005... that hasn't changed.
---
Is it a reference to something? An inside joke? There has to be a backstory to such a stupid name.
---
This is so well written
---
If warriors are hybrids then every class is a hybrid.
---
It's more fun as a twink.  In my ideal world, BGs at 10-19 and 20-29 would just be all twinks.  It's infuriating when I join a WSG that has like 6 lvl 23s in it or whatever.  Really hoping as more people create twinks and the novelty to levelers wears off, the concentration of twinks vs non-twinks increases.  My fav time playing WoW was in TBC when WSG at 10-19 and 20-29 was essentially only twinks
---
Just wait until they add in the Stonard portal with the rest!
---
My highest crit so far was 1300 :( feels like throwing cotton
---
Lobotomizer is decent, but you should not be allowed to use it in raid.  (It's proc takes a debuff slot)
---
Why cant we just let people enjoy things?
---
You like to min-max? cool.
---
You like to go your own pace? cool.
---
Just relax and find people who play your speed
---
What about the fact that sunder makes them take more damage, which makes you generate more threat.
---
Hey fuck you
---
I am afraid to tell my guild how old I am. LOL
---
"Cleave", in relation to arena, just means a comp with double melee DPS.
---
seems legit
---
I thought epic mounts were 1000g. That good to hear they are cheaper. Also sucks that we can't get the wolf. :'(
---
"Online personalities" are devoid of any
---
I was excited to watch this, but being on a PvE server takes most of the challenge out of it.
---
How can a character in white gear solo Ragnaros?
---
I'm asking for a friend...
---
People would stop queueing for AV if they were all like this. They are fun on occasion but most people are in there for honor/rep, and you can get 1.7k honor in 6-7 minutes as alliance.
---
I think people need more realistic goals in game. I’m a PVP guy, I know this. But I also know I need weapons (as a WAR) and I know fuck getting High warlord (I already got GM back in the day and I’m not doing that again). So that means raiding. I got super lucky with PUGs and got OEB. Happy as a clam. 
---
Now I really want Spinal reaper or BER, but is it worth trying to PUG RAG kills just for that? Probably not. 
---
When BWL rolls around I’ll go back into raid mode for the (tier 2 weps) like the axe (forget name) or untamed blade.
---
AQ has my first end game item with edge of insanity. I know it’s Cthun so it mig not happen. Then it’s the axe from Patchwork. 
---
Those are my goals. Get weapons and PvP/ raid a bit with friends. Having a blast so far.
---
Well I’m currently playing a mage but I much rather would have gone lock or rogue. I Mained rogue from vanilla until cata. Rogue is great raid dps and really only need weapons and understanding of rotation to pop off. Everyone in vanilla gets their time to shine at some point or another. Except warriors, they are always good.
---
Hard disagree with your specific example. The *majority* of 56s trying to run high-tier dungeons are often going to pull a ton of extra mobs. Their aggro range is simply bigger, and you can't be stealthed all the time. If I'm trying to run 20+ Scholos to get one item, I don't want to pick up one person who is likely to make each run 5+ packs longer because of his bigger aggro range.
---
Try Stormwind next time :)
---
Well for many people the rush strategy isn't 100% winning, it's about ending the match as quickly as possible, move on to the next. They'd rather have a quick loss than a long win. Which is why it's such a counter-intuitive meta for a competitive gameplay format.
---
&gt; relatable.bmp
---
been playing lol since season 2 and I can assure you people are less minmaxers in competitve league of legends than in wow classic, in a sad way, its funny
---
Just bind interact with target
---
wait until the meta turns into getting rank 11+ people kicked to you can rank faster than them
---
I played a Guardian which as I remember made a pretty solid ball carrier.
---
I had to go look up what the class was called and it turns out they just released a new expansion in October. I might actually go check it out since there's a bunch of expansions I never played that's available to f2p.
---
As soon as I get Lei of the Lifegiver, I'm out.   I'll go run the flag in WSG all day...but healing AV is hell.
---
Especially if they're not great at the class to begin with
---
You know you cant premade in AV right?
---
Should we follow this advice they spam?
---
Exactly the kind of pathetic response that is really getting tiring to read.
---
Mage.
---
Best post on this sub in months
---
For future reference, you can /target the NPC, and then use the interact hotkey to talk to the battlemaster.
---
Which professions for a Gnome Warrior?
---
Ahaha i got rank 5 at 1%
---
You are still missing the point.  Blizzard is trying, through the years to remove the "get fucked" mentality.  You don't have to exclusively raid to get epics and legendaries.  You don't have to log 40 hours a week to get amazing gear.
---
Players are pushing for the 1% upgrades, the best possible gear and exhaust all avenues to do so.  Blizzard gave multiple ways to gain gear and players are attempting to do all of them, burning out fast.
---
Not saying that is or is not the right way to play.  But when the dev is attempting to appease multiple groups, they are inadvertently creating systems that a growing minority (min/max) are finding hard to keep up with.
---
If you had 10 ways to get epics and legendaries, would you pick 3 and stick with them?  Or would you push yourself to do all 10, as much as possible to avoid falling behind the other people also doing all 10?
---
Because people that aren't the tank also go "buff plz" "wtf buff plz" "trash priest"
---
And I'm not here to be your personal buff machine.
---
I have inner focus, and I'm sure most priests do, so I will fort flag carrier, the tank in AV, etc because its free.  It's just that we're tired of people acting really entitled regarding buffs.
---
I don't have sound at work to watch this but all I can hear in my head is Michael, Dwight and Andy saying Parkour! over and over again with every jump you do.
---
Thank you for the big nose exhale laugh.
---
Everybody is just trying to get the rep grind over. Most AV games will end up like this in a week. So if you're expecting it to be like that, just hold off a bit and wait for us to get done our rep.
---
You forgot waiting in queue...
---
I'm not playing classic but I remember this debate from raiding back in retail vanilla. Back then the consensus was that it wasn't that clear-cut, even with great gear, deep holy was still a competitive choice due to the way spell coefficients worked. Renew and Prayer of Healing in particular were so greatly enhanced by this talent, the gear scaling argument was dismissed as irrelevant.
---
In the end it all boiled down to preferred playstyle, raid composition, amount of downranking, mana management, as no one could reasonably prove which spec was better.
---
I didn't expect this debate to make a comeback though.
---
Oof, based on my probably-incorrect math, having mined this much, there's a 91.5% chance that you should have gotten a crystal.
---
Can someone check this for me? Assuming each vein has an average of 3 taps and a 3% drop rate I did:
---
1-(0.97\^81)
---
Promoting abuse of reporting sure you can have that one Thanks for the paragraph confirming your toxic trash
---
All i do is afk in the caves
---
Premades last about 7-10 minutes, 1400 bonus honour with about 35 HKs each giving about 45 honour each = 2975 honour
---
and he conjured a boat when he did it!
---
This is simply not true. 
---
Everyone will know that if/when an AV pops, it will be the fastest honor possible.... meaning everyone will always queue for AV in case it does pop .... and if everyone is queueing then it will have short queues.
---
You dont have a clue what you are talkng about.
---
There is at least ~250 "active" pvpers per week on my server (bracket 7-14), i can imagine that there is as much people on other server, which means enough people that are here for the honor grind, and when the meta for honor farming will be established (it's been 1 day since release so i don't consider it being the meta yet), people will use and abuse it. Not saying that you wont have some people with other mindset, but the those "random" will follow the pack imo, and the norm will still be the 7-10' game.
---
Lol if they had any brains about min maxing they would go for the quick runs. The honor / hour is not even CLOSE.
---
damn OP. grats
---
Maybe go read the old WoW forums again  they were preeetty toxic
---
Lost value ? Improved life Tap is a premier talent that almost every build takes.  Locks should constantly be using tap throughout every facet of the game.
---
It’s had me upset for years..... gg jay
---
&gt; There's also a couple ghost mushroom spots which you can sneak to in the rooms to the east
---
You can also solo hydrospawn with SWP by abusing a pathing glitch. It's slow, but the axe he drops vendors for 5g.
---
His statement is contradictory
---
I am not so concerned with the one guy, but rather the numerous just plain stupid people that hand him stuff just because... To me, this is the worst part of it all.
---
I have the same problem
---
I'm a tri spec priest so I'm running around mana burning everything that has a blue bar. My thoughts are, if they have less mana, then I dont have to use my mana to heal the damage they are doing lol.
---
But you can tab sunder and get aggro on multiple mobs way faster than you can tab heroic strike.
---
then you realize a single person can kite it into guards / vann / drekk and your precious OP golem you spend 30 min collecting stuff for, escort, feed, nourish... is gone.
---
For sure, but of course when those guys have to play with guys like me (who goof off and sometimes triggers turtle matches) then we're bound to come into conflict. But I think that should be expected in MMO games. You can't control everyone, and you can't control everything that happens.
---
That is ranking points... not honor.
---
I'm currently a level 21 troll priest currently mainly specing Disc until late 30's when I will switch to shadow. I have almost cleared out the quests in the Barrens. Where should I head next to keep leveling quickly?
---
The whole “this was the dark ages of PvP thing” is some whiny drama queen shit. During this era most of us were totally content playing wsg and AB(which isn’t released yet) with our friends. People had talked about wishing old av was back but no one complained about it on this level. You guys are just whiny bitches. If you wanna PvP just go fucking play wsg.
---
Most trash in scholomance is lvl 58 or 59. The larger range isn’t enough to make the difference you indicate, compared to a lvl 56. It’s about 2 additional meters.
---
You need to do what you need to do to have the gaming experience you want to have.
---
I'd prolly just leave and find a more stable guild, once an implosion happens it will likely continue to be a problem.
---
&gt;kids
---
That's a negative ghostrider
---
It will die when Blizzard have stopped releasing content in 6 months, no doubt about that.
---
If you think this is bad, oh boy you would hate the original AV with all the people trying to rep grind.  At least this way people are playing it and mostly "trying" to win.  The most effective way to rep grind in the old AV was to still do pve, but not even attempt to try to win.
---
The question I have is, what do you actually want and how could Blizzard have given it to you?  It doesn't matter what version of AV was put into the game, people would be doing their best to rep grind.  What you seem to want is for people to not rep grind but go out and have skirmishes all around the map.  People wouldn't be doing that either.  Original AV was terrible, but in different ways.
---
Is the issue you are mad is that AV is the most efficient way to get honor and thus rank up so you feel you have to do it instead of WSG?  It only matters if you feel like you HAVE to do AV to get enough honor to rank up, and if tha tis the case you are just mad you can't rank up the way you want.  We don't always get to pick the "best" way to do something.  Getting to r14 isn't something everyone can just go do, the system isn't designed that way.  If you are mad that you get less honor for doing WSG or something else but you don't care about getting r14, then who cares?  Are you mad that people will get to rank 14 doing it a way you don't want to do?
---
What I wish people would do before they make these big complaint posts is state what they actually want.  Not some shit like "I want OG AV" or "I want a better PvP system", I want to know why.  What are you trying to do that is ruined by AV?  What is it you want out of AV or the pvp system in general?  Anyone can just complain about something that they don't like.  Complaining is empty if you don't sit down and think about what you actually want and why the thing you are complaining about is affecting it.
---
You don't like doing AV to get pvp items.  Ok, why does that matter?  You can do Warsong.  Maybe you won't get there as fast, but you can get there.
---
That's why I like classic as much as I do.  If I need to disappear for a few weeks for a life event I am literally in no worse position than I was when I left.  In retail I have to fucking grind azerite power to catch up in most guilds.
---
What's your guild loot system?
---
1300 is like a haircut.
---
I’m having a blast.
---
Biggest gold sunk are Arcanite bars (6), diamonds were cheap for me. And u have to farm stratholme for waters, or more like one run, DM West first boss and Scholo 2nd boss aka Rattlegore.
---
If doing the tier 0.5 quests appeals to you I'd say keep the tier 0 stuff just so you can do that!
---
the issue is that dps is super common. wanting a 60 dps is hardly dismissive/rude, its just a common thing. I dont mind taking rets/ferals/spriest (some of my fav specs to have), but taking someone lower level can often be a recipe for disaster. "I wont pull anything" is usually said right before someone pulls.
---
&gt; It's not what you would call fun PvE though, is it?
---
In light of my experiences in P2 as a healing priest so far:
---
I sure hope it isn't.
---
It's up to you to engage in PvP or not. 
---
I start off by charging into a healer, hamstring, then intimidating shout, then trying to kill the healer i hamstrung. 
---
I usually end up with the most deaths, but I have a lot of fun.
---
What if he is geared now and only needs to raidlog + maybe consumables?
---
He’s not falling behind, this isn’t BFA where if you miss out on precious emissaries / rep and AP you are just behind..
---
Its fun to report people like you out of the bg
---
Omg id love that axe, i can only dream tho, stuck with a single binding and no wpn beyond av rep items
---
 I can give you an exact time and date.
---
I was off in my own little world farming golden pearls from naga when one of the officers in my guild, a reluctant raid leader, pm'd me. He then proceeded to verbally abuse me over discord for 35 minutes and, like an idiot, I let him.
---
Took a while to process, but wowclassic died for me that day.
---
♥️

More of this please!

Resource: a supply of assets that can be drawn on to operate effectively.  
---
You don't draw (see: spend/consume) on Honor, you gain honor, and that is turned into rank, depending on your overall contribution for that week. Gold is a resource you use to obtain the gear.

What you described here is the difference between macro level skill and micro level skill.  An example that comes to mind is a jungler in League that requires a strong dose of macro level knowledge to know when to be where during the whole match in comparison to a laner that stays in their lane the majority of the match till team fights start breaking out.  You can account for shortcomings in your micro skill with strong macro level knowledge and application of said knowledge.
---
Bummer...
---
Hey, unrealated to this topic but what is your addon called for that trinket meny on your left side?
---
I want to reroll a female troll Warrior.  I can not decide if I should stay on Razorgore (PvP) or roll a PvE realm.  I don't have much playtime anymore and want to get stuff done when I play. I would have preferred to stay on Zandalar Tribe because I like the idea of RPPVP because I get to PvP but people are more laid back. However, I don't want to delete my lv 40 ally character.
---
I have a lv30 with some gold on Razorgore. The Horde population is quite big on Razorgore and the gold will help me level faster. However, I kind of feel that the server is filled with more hardcore players and I am looking for a more laid back player-base. But maybe my judgement is wrong? Idk, maybe someone here on Razorgore can judge 'how hardcore' the population is? (Toxic, edgy, not noob-accepting)
---
As for the PvE servers, they are a lot more empty than Razorgore. Idk how much the lower Horde population on PvE is an issue when leveling from 1\~60 and during endgame? Maybe someone could give me some insight? Would be shame if finding groups for dungeons takes forever etc.
---
(I judged all population based on characters present in Ogrimmar)
---
Unless preform AV comes out soon, it won't be. Too high of a possibility the game stretches out beyond what is worth it.
---
Just tell them you're quitting WoW and that's it. Sucks, but it happens to every guild and it happens all the time.
---
Tim has always been a piece of shit player. Noticed that a long time ago and apparently he still is.
---
Yea, my play time is much less than it was, the while wife/kids/family thing.  It helps for sure.
---
&gt;You can do Warsong. Maybe you won't get there as fast, but you can get there.
---
You clearly dont have a clue because no, you cant, not with AV the way it is. With 1.12AV the way it is the only people that will get beyond rank 9-10 will be people doing AV. That's what happens when you have a BG that gives 3x the honor in 1/3rd the time.... which happens to only require that you PvE.
---
Hey, every minute I'm grinding AV is a minute I'm not bitching on reddit. And bitching on reddit about how bad the game is is the real endgame.
---
Dons ring is great to have for threat. 
---
It also pays to do ah till rank 8 (tank 10 preferably) to get the 4 set pieces so that you’re good to go for WSG FCing on wsg weekends.
---
The only actual difference between the AVs is which color gets the fast easy wins.
---
You said you lost all respect for him..how could you have respect for him to begin with if you dont watch him?
---
Awesome. Thanks.
---
Yes precisely when aq hits se get an op one hander
---
&gt; I feel like I've only got to this position due to them not having any other option, 
---
No shit, Sherlock. Having a Pally tank raids is clearly out of desperation.
---
&gt; My question is, how much of an asshole am I for just leaving them high and dry and moving on to other games / more time doing RL hobbies?
---
You're not. Games are meant to have fun, if you don't have fun, don't play.
---
You sort of remind me of a Fury Warrior in our guild. The guy dies all the time, and he blames the healers for it, and then he went as far as saying that healers won't even heal him anymore because he complained about them. Not only that, but he gets pissed when we give priority to Tanks for tier pieces he openly admits he'll only use in PvP...
---
And then he stopped showing up in our raids because he said he wasn't having fun... If his idea of having fun is being the #1 priority for healers and looting tank gear, he should've rolled a tank...
---
Back to your case, if the guild is falling apart, you might want to find another guild, maybe go back to your healing roots, since that's what Paladins excel at and see if you'll have more fun that way. If you don't, move on to some other game.
---
What your spreadsheet fails to mention is cooldowns, spell prerequisites (Revenge) or only proccing on your next auto swing. As Era555 states, Sunder Armor is your most efficient crowd threat ability and it's also the most efficient for trying to achieve aggro quickly.
---
Hah, god damn are you my old guild master? That dude drove me nuts with that, lol. However he was the only one who cared about fishing enough to unlock the fish boss for us in ZG.
---
Why can't he hearthstone or use the auto unstuck?
---
I agree with you to some extend. Except for me, Retail is just too boring to hold my attention and has been for years. At least I am having fun in Classic even though I occasional find myself saying "X is one of the changes that I actually think was for the best and wouldn't hurt Classic"
---
That’s what I love about my guild. We know how to poke fun and no one gets bothered by it. We’re all grown adults and are more concerned with killing bosses efficiently and having fun.
---
This is him, claiming the alliance base 
---

---
It is certainly an issue.  I know people don't like the idea of people afk farming or bots, but the other side of this is people getting kicked out for no reason at all.  I've seen people afk report other big pvpers on their own server to put them in "timeout" to slow them down.
---
I might be stupid but why would you click a portal in av?
---
I won't lie. So far my classic dungeon experience has been remembering exactly how long it takes to run them from finding a group, to corpse runs getting in, then actually running the thing which is usually long af with tons of trash, then finishing and not having hit any loot after 3 hours. Lol
---
Same. Hopefully polishing off exalted tonight. Looking forward to the new books
---
rogues, mages, hunters and locks aren't hybrids
---
priests, warriors, paladins, shamen, druids are hybrids.
---
So just 640g total right? Is this the cheapest epic mount you can get?
---
100%
---
Well they are collectively fucking each other cause honor is relative. 
---
If every horde is trying to get 4K honor in 10 mins by killing lieutenants then everyone has to do that to compete. On ally we just all collectively get like 1k honor a game plus the reputation. 
---
Most people are just rep grinding av because they know they aren’t getting rank 14.
---
Yet they still do play. Why would they play every single fresh vanilla server if they didn't find the game fun? The release schedule shouldn't even affect you anyway. Over 50% of vanilla players didn't buy the game until after BWL.
---
The current accelerated release is fine. MC through BWL content was always going to come fast because it was virtually on-release content for the majority of vanilla players. I'm willing to bet it'll slow down after BWL. I don't expect ZG for 3 months after bwl, and then AQ for 3+ months after that and Naxx 3+ months after that. I think 14-18 months total instead of 24 is a perfectly acceptable timeline given the nature of 2019 mentality and speed. Just because you aren't completing content as quickly as other people doesn't mean they should slow down content for you, because the content will still be there when you reach it.
---
Any lack of enjoyment isn't due to the accelerated content. The people that are complaining are people that think they should also be ahead of the curve but can't because of time/skill/etc and hope complaining will make Blizzard decide to make a change that benefits them.
---

Hardest raid boss in any game.
---
Let em all go to hell except for cave 76.
---
This is a good idea. What kind of gold per hour can 3 people make?
---
quick note, luna shows them as feigned when they go in and during the channel, but sometimes flashes them as dead when they cancel it ( likely because they no longer have the feign death buff)
---
Sorry I misunderstood! It does indeed suck the life out of the experience, and then they complain about the game and the way it is played. Can't wrap my head around it. Just go and dive into the story. I couldn't believe that I never paid attention to the lore, it's so interesting. YouTubers like Nobbel87 revived my love for the game by telling me the story, I get incredibly bored with the game nowadays unless I'm questing really
---
I like how classic has a few puns sprinkled throughout the game, then you go to retail and EVERYTHING is a pun haha
---
turns out in a 40v40 match a single player has very little impact. Neat
---
It's around 80-90 games.
---
No we don't please change it. I want the 8-hour+ warfronts they used to be, not this PvE for PvP rewards garbage.
---
Right back at ya nerd
---
He was making the group. People didn’t want to run alongside him, despite a raid-geared healer with him, my raid geared warlock in the group, and another decently geared warlock so we could double up on Soul stones and all the cookies in the world. 
---
But “56” is the problem despite all the tools in a rogue’s kit to prevent it being a problem.
---
"TOO MANY PEOPLE SOUTH.
---
YOU'RE WASTING EVERYONE'S TIME"
---
Downvote for pve server
---
Yeah you should stop for now. When I farm all day I get 1 crystal maybe. If I farm for 20 minutes like 3x a day usually get 1 per trip.
---
I used to get 70-80 killing blows before they nerfed it
---
If your goal is warlord or high warlord u kind of have to
---
It's a toilet tank filling.
---
That's bannable
---
I’m thinking about unsubbing because of this. This subreddit was really cool when it first launched but now all the complaints are affecting my view of the game.
---
Then do it.  This comes down to, I want to play the game my way and rewarded the same.  If you don't want to do AV then do warsong.  If you are just trying to rank up, maybe you should understand this is why the honor system was fucking terrible.  It doesn't reward being good.  It doesn't reward anything but raw playing time and efficiency.  It wasn't about having fun, it was about grinding.  You are complaining that the most grindy thing wow ever did is too grindy and not fun for you?
---
If you do anything besides RP walking you are not possibly having fun. Take it slow, man!
---
A horde defense meta isn't unlikely though, and even though this isn't the 1.5/1.6 AV, it's still pretty easy for just 5 players to disrupt a rush. That's why I wonder if it will really keep up. We're doing cross-realm BGs here, and to my understanding it's on a larger scale than our old battlegroups. I just wonder how many AV instances will \*not\* have those 5 guys.
---
To each his own I suppose and I am not gonna throw shit at minmaxer's but rather applaud them for thinking smart. Me on the other hand, I decided when it was announced that I would play WoW very casually and not think of it as a race. And so far has been very good to me, I take a lot of things in stride and play with my older brother cos we played when we were kids and it just feels great. :)
---
I'll agree it's not a strict generation thing in the sense that age isn't the only factor.
---
But it is 100% the twitch culture. The Venn diagram between people who watch toxic streams and spam shit in chat all day and the people who are ruining online gaming communities is pretty much a god damned circle.
---
No need to spend money. There are plenty of guides. Just compare a few of them and use different guides + Questie to get a feel for where to go at each level bracket.
---
You just reminded me of a rogue named susan on Spinebreaker way back when. Gold farmer that was swapped between a couple people at a cafe or something, but they were all either silent or really polite. They couldn't really speak english but would emote and be considerate when farming, and they were quite popular and would always draw attention when they entered IF to vendor/auction off loot.
---
You clearly are a moron. The developers put quests in AV and people doing quests are playing the way the zone was intended. 
---
No one is obligated to play the way you want them to play, and abusing the AFK report function to punish people who don't want to play your strategy makes you absolute trash.
---
I hope Blizzard takes action against every scummy toxic piece of shit who abuses that function, resets their rank to zero, and suspends them.
---
Nope. Just your luck. Any rogue that decides to run with us (we have like, zero in-guild) gets geared out the ass.
---
So you are wasting 15 minutes of everyone’s time. 
---
Why don’t you just rush to Val. You are closer. You will win. 
---
I guess it’s kind of funny that in alterac the alliance wins by just being better at pve than horde and the horde will win by actually pvp’n. 
---
It’s the perfect example of the differences in the factions.
---
They are, but you get 10% discount from being honored and 10% from being rank 3. Otherwise AV mount normally costs 800g.
---
Still it was never good.
---
Wholesome
---
I played PvP servers across multiple games as a healer, so it's really old hat to me. It just sucks when not running as a coordinated team with voice chat, shot calling, assists, peels and cc. But I've had a few decent fights as a healer that ended up with me getting a killing shot on 4 horde on me at once before I died. It's still not fun because I wish I could queue up with my guildies whom I know are good and coordinated.
---
3 manning it is more realistic before you get good gear and go fury prot
---
Yikes
---
^ This, one million times. This guy nailed it. I 100% agree.
---
Wait... what is death rolling?
---
Well maybe some of us enjoy group healing in a race scenario.
---
Legit getting tired of the complaining about zerging, as if enjoying that type of gameplay isn’t valid.
---
No bud. The people at the top were doing the same thing. YOU were just unaware of it then. Just because YOU have learned something recently doesn't mean it didn't exist years ago.
---
worthless for BG's its 15 seconds of you only being able to heal (can't dispel, shield, manaburn) and not move (catch up with flag carrier) and depending on when you die, you could be up again in less than 15 seconds with full mana and health.
---
People are having fun without posting it on reddit.
---
I like the honor system just before tbc dropped. It actually let me obtain pvp items without resorting to poop socking my way up the ranks.
---
Was it a more casual version? Absolutely.
---
Did I enjoy it more? 100%. Fuck the honor system it's terrible.
---
Classic streamer entitlement.
---
As long as these people have fans that worship them they're going to keep doing scummy shit because they live in an echochamber where people are constantly telling them it's OK and giving them money.
---
Same here, man, same here...
---
We humans are collectively hedonistic, minimalistic, and individualistic.   If you dont go with the grain youre classified as a conspiracy theorist, given an 'ist' classification, slandered, deplatformed, and squelched.    This is even if youve done everything right and are proven with time correct.  Youre still classified as a pariah.   Case in point, go with the grain and sit silent for now.
---
What sorts of things are there to do? 
---
Obviously Dungeons, Raids, Exploring, PVP but does it go beyond that stuff? 
---
Is it worth getting onto a PvP server and finding a guild or staying PvE?
---
No, it comes down to "PvP rewards should require PvP". You missed the **entire** point of the post.
---
I would't say it requires griefing but can give you an advantage indeed.
---
People need to understand how to enjoy a video game instead of treating it like a job.
---
Good insight.  I always wondered how popular the 10-19 Bracket was.  Is there that big a gap between budget twinks and BiS twinks?
---
I would suggest doing research into the hit tables for classic wow as well as fully understanding what each stat does for your class. This will help you not only understand why a BiS list contains what it does,  but more importantly it will help you make decisions on alternative gear,  or how to gear for some thing meta-alternative.
---
I would rather have to do actual pvp than to do a pve sequence in AV for 2 months.   
---
Which is why i am incredibly sad about not being able to do WSG, since our team has to follow up with honor.
---
As far as I'm aware it's the cheapest you can get, not counting the potential of warlock/paladin mounts being cheaper. But if you don't already plan on grinding AV rep for gear and you're only doing it for rep, in the long run you'd end up making more gold just by farming gold for the 20 hours or however long it takes to get exalted instead and buying a regular mount. If you are going to grind it regardless though then it's definitely your best option.
---
Damn, TIL one of the most complex PvP classes, Druids, are "faceroll". 
---
It just sounds like you're not good at PvP and  are playing against other people that are. Play more, watch other good players, understand why they do the things they do.
---
/r/thathappened
---
Pretty much. I can still enjoy classic tho
---
Can we get the set at this point?
---
Journey is a horde side druid. Horde does not win, therefore does not need to care racing to the end boss. Half the raid can AFK and still do the objectives you need for best honor before losing.
---
On a slow 2H weapon yes, it’s a big DPS increase. If you have a faster weapon however, Lifestealing is better for PvP as all the damage happens instantly and Crusader requires 2-3 swings to pass it in damage.
---
You can only hold a max of 20 though can't you?
---
Actually there's a whole industry around that.
---
On today's episode of "Shit Well Adjusted Adults Already Know Being Explained to the Cry Babies of /r/classicwow" . . .
---
Every 3 minutes take a break from healing to pop cds and vaporize 2 or 3 allies.
---
And get ganked by a random level 60 while I'm mid 30s.. kinda seems like it would be impossible
---
People farming mobs for exp are not AFK. The developers put quests and mobs in the zone to farm. It is also intended on being a zone for 51-60. Noit just 60's who want to zerg. You are trash.
---

---
Step away from teh subreddit! I quit checking this place out 5X a day (a habit I picked up while waiting for release) a few weeks ago and my enjoyment of the game has dramatically increased. Just pop in once or twice a week now and look at the most popular posts and then go back to your own classic wow experience!
---
I wish I could honestly say that I couldn't believe blizzard would allow players to kick each other from games that give honor when the honor system pits these same players against each other to accumulate said honor, but nothing dumb blizzard does surprises me at this point.  
---
Completely idiotic that this is allowed to happen.
---
god damn rogue t1 shoulders look so incredibly stupid
---
I have a guild hunter who is always “brutality blade is my bis” - dudes about to not get it outa spite.
---
Rank 14 weapons are better than everything until Naxx and even then are better than a lot of Naxx weapons for rogues and warriors.
---
You can downvote me all you'd like because I wouldn't bring your friend to Scholo, but that doesn't make me wrong. If we're using meters, same-level aggro range is around 18, and 60s to 59s it's 17. As a level 56, your friend would be sitting at 21 against level 59 mobs. Your friend's aggro range is more than 20% wider than everyone else in the party. An average player in his position is going to be pulling more mobs that wouldn't have otherwise been pulled, period.
---
Get off of PVP servers, 90% of your problems with the game will go away.
---
The face roll was more for the arms warrior, but druids really aren't that complicated lol. Granted, it's probably a lot harder these days now that everyone knows how to counter everything.
---
we had a premade in AV today that we all had to leave in order to get to azuregos in time.
---
Ah, I was just asking. Don't have Twitch, probably won't install it and just continue to move the folders manually.
---
Then go pvp, no one is stopping you.
---
The issue isn't you would rather do warsong or you would.  You want to do warsong to get the items.
---
Here is the newsflash I think far too many people are hitting right now.  THe honor system in vanilla was fucking trash.  Far too many people didn't understand what it involved and it is hitting them right now.  They are seeing what is actually necessary to rank up for those items they thought they could farm in a couple weeks.  They are looking at what they actually have to do and they don't like it.
---
This is the honor system.
---
stop blaming the devs for the shitty actions of the people
---
Go pick up the end of silverpine and then do Hillsbrad, run a bunch of SFK while you're over there,  some good caster gear there
---
You can get full set at r 8. Rank 10 gives you the most optimal set.
---
You can't queue as a premade in AV.
---
I've taken Alch/Herb, hopefully that will be enough!
---
Go to system&gt;advanced&gt;Graphics card, and pick the graphics card you want your computer to use.
---
Do this while in-game, fixed it for me.
---
I second this. Seriously, fuck u OP.
---
OP: guys you dont need healing I've already killed the whole enemy team.
---
Thanks for the info!! That sounds like a rough farm. Fortunately I feel like the golden pearls are the cheapest of all the mats.
---
I see tour point but don’t really agree. I went hard at wow when it first came out up until AQ was released. I’m playing casually through right now (only level 38 after months) and everything seems new to me. Sure I vaguely remember areas or dungeons but bro it’s been 15 years. I can’t even remember what I had to eat yesterday.
---
Honestly I don’t even know what this post is even about. Min maxing and all. I’m just doing my thing and having fun, and yes on a pvp server.
---
This is why WoW2 needs to happen.
---
Start again fresh combining ideas from both classic and modern WoW. The current game is irredeemable without massively changing parts of it that would deter the huge casual part of the fanbase.
---
I think you can also still summon him in retail, I saw a post about it on r wow a few months ago
---
When has Asmon ever been pvp focused? Why does he care? I have NEVER thought to myself, "man I hope Asmon releases a new pvp montage soon" I always thought he was just a crowdfunded neckbeard tv character for the lulz.

holy shit i felt this one in a bad way 10/10

---
Everyone told me to get honor spy, 350,000 honor in two days shows me loosing rank at fucking rank 2.
---
Right? Its not an earth problem its a humanity problem. This big floating rock will be here long after we've killed ourselves.
---
Report AFK, if horde: continue loosing, if alliance: win in under 10 min. Bag the honor, next game!
---
&gt; You realize you're arguing for longer que times?
---
You realize you're arguing against bathroom/food breaks, right?
---
I partly agree with this, although we cannot put the entire blame on the player's lack of responsibility, I think streamers and content creators should set an example of what is possible doing (or not) in a game, but that would it.
---
Instead they push this mentality to their viewers and the viewers unfortunately take it personally and react to it in the wrong way.
---
&gt; Dungeons are short enough that you can do one without commiting three hours
---
Maybe this is a problem for something like DM, but I've done a lot of dungeons up to level 30 and none of them took more than an hour to get through
---
Verbally abuse you for what?
---
MS&gt;OS, they can’t really do dKp before having a full raid from guild.
---
Also did some pug ms&gt;is +1 but was unfortunate with 7 other priests in the raid
---
I can beat that. Doing 2-man DME jump runs the day before BGs launched. It took 28 runs (tracked by DMB, so no exaggeration) before 1 crystal dropped. I got 1 sapphire, 3 large opal, and 3 azerothian diamond in that time. Worst session ever.
---
dont let a handful of neckbeards ruin your experience. none of this is new.
---
I feel like some people watch and complain about streamers playing a specific game more than they actually play it themselves.
---
My bad I added the link now.
---
The macro is:
---
/stopattack
---
/cast slam
---
/startattack
---
You have to time it.  There's a gif of how it works.
---
Yeah OPs argument makes no sense when you realize most of us are here to chill and not to minimax. Most of us played quite well before and are falling into the trap of playing too well until the game is basically a waste of time
---
Ye I guess it's the easier option than a full 'ironman' but it's hard enough not to die as it is in classic.. I think the ironman rules are more designed for retail playthroughs
---
Added the link.  Dunno what happened.
---
Meanwhile I am happy that I can rank up without getting obliterated by 10 mc, ony and rank 8 geared hordes.
---
i like wow classic for every reason he listed 
---
the only second thought i have is i play with a good guild , i feel like maybe i should have gone with a mediocre guild to make the content more of a event. i would not want to play with bad's but a group that had never seen any of the content would have been cool. though im about 10 years too old to be playing with people who had never seen any of this before
---
I put that book up for 100g in the AH. Wish me luck brews. 
---
🥴
---
Yep unfortunately that's about all you can do
---
Lol, wasn’t this the same argument the horde used in wPvP? It sure didn’t stop the allies from crying their eyes out though.
---
Yeah I'm gonna grind it regardless. Still pretty broke as I recently bought a couple BiS items, but it's good to know I can save and get it for 640g. Much better than 900g.
---
And there is the exact attitude being complained about by more casual players.
---
It's not about rank 14. The players that do mostly PvE content just want rep for the faction gear. In time they'll get it and stop playing AV. Once the bulk of players have doing this stop a zerg strat will be impossible and you'll get what you're looking for.
---
Fair enough
---
How tf do you make money as Tank? Besides mining/selling tank. Is that it?
---
Why am I an herbalist?
---
I prefer Druid tanks over warrior ranks in dungeons.
---
MARK YOURSELF!
---
Same but it’s because my computer sucks
---
At the same time, trying to fight human nature as a designer is silly.  You will always lose in the long run.
---
Aww cmon. What about shadowmeld. That's p cool right?
---
Not my customized version of Spy. You do know there's a market for a lot of add-ons most people who consider cheating right?
---
There is a system in place to mitigate this. I hear you that it's not "good" for the game, to have such a "popular" streamer propagate this behavior. But I think you are a bit dramatic in your reaction.
---
I literally cannot think of AV without thinking of AFK'ers lol. It's just par for the territory. Some dudes pseudo AFK some don't, welcome to AV! 
---
The thing that sucks is you can't queue with like 3-4 friends (atleast I have not been able to) and be an agent of change and carry the game. You are forced into this retail-esque solo-anonymous PVP mode. Where you can't really build relationships with others. After the game, they just fade back to whatever server they were on.
---
Going back to the streamer thing, fuck em. It's some weird bastard-child of Kardashian-esque culture. I like watching a highlight clip of some streamers, I just don't get the deification component. I hate to say it but it's like the male version of influencer worship culture. (yes woman play games and they are awesome, just cut some slack here)
---
There are two sides to that coin. People are trying to force min/maxers to force their vanilla idea of the game.
---
I am 10k/21k reverted with AV. I want to get exalted so I can stop doing stupid AV and just enjoy some WSG pre-made groups. Don Julio's is just too good to not grind it out quickly.
---
I want to be done with AV before the que times increase once everyone gets exalted.
---
I am happy AV rep is fast. I played AV in vanilla and the hour long AV games got real old real fast.
---
I think a lot of the wannabe Rank 14's will drop off once they realize that they can't keep up with people whose characters are doing AV 20\~ hours a day.
---
Stop blaming people for taking advantage of a busted system.
---
Wtf was the point of this post, Imagine if raids dropped 25 peices of a gear a boss... why idk
---
mind linking the logs?
---
Yeh I'm in a guild with dkp/loot council which is why I said what I did in the previous response. I've been running loads of rend runs where sometimes I'm reserving or people don't need it. Never seen it
---
We're currently using suicide kings, and the wipes are the exact reason I want to bring this up.  Our healers don't have great gear yet, some of the longer fights I end up dying as they run OOM. 
---
What do you think about gearing 3 tanks as priority? Add another Warrior besides myself and a third druid that won't need warrior gear?
---
The real problem in retail is every class does everything. While some classes still do it a bit better than others. Yes the combat is more reactive based which I think a lot of people enjoy
---
Right up until they realize that all classes do the same thing. All stun, mortal strike, gap close/escape, ohsht buttons are all nearly identical. Just some are a bit better than others. Its almost like playing a mirror match in overwatch.
---
My favorite guild to date was called DeathAngels Of Death
---
As internet went on people realized more widely and deeper that anonimity= freedom. Nothing changed from 2004 except people becoming aware just how much of their true, inner shitty selves they can put forth without consequence online.
---
Thank God i thought im the only one lol
---
This is not my first time around the rodeo, been playing pservers.
---
But... but... i can first have fun and chill and play the game like it should be AFTER Im geared to the teeth.
---
Wow a downtown apartment! Oh golly! How much you make in a year? We can play this game but you'll lose
---
AV is so dumb lol. It amazes me how many people run it all day long. To each their own. WSG is super fun though.
---
Drop totems, start blasting.  Hey I dropped my totems!
---
Look at the anti-vax movement... It's basically this in a nutshell
---
What about trinkets? That's mainly what I'm going for. Those are BoP, right?
---
You need rank 10 for helm and shoulders.
---
Isn’t that Reddit’s Slogan?
---
Wow that's some life advice right there, thanks man!
---
I'll try to consider it!
---
Rolled on a PvE server. I seem to be surrounded by lovely people whenever I log on to play. 
---
Not met one person in a pug with an attitude I found worrying or disruptive.
---
Guild is doing great. Basically the same people I played with 15 years ago, and we still have a good time.
---
WoW classic is the most fun I have had since WoW.
---
Padaren were in Lore before hand.
---
Also I like Jack Black and I don’t think the first one was a bad movie.
---
.... Do you really think the phrase is "B-line" rather than a "bee line"
---
Dude. The Spy addon was nerfed. It's completely worthless now..
---
I think things like +200 HP from librams matters a lot for 1v1.  But playskill will always matter a ton.  Especially movement.  
---
In other brackets you have abilities that allow you to set up combos and such--scatter + trap, intercept, etc--in 19 it's all about having crisp movement.
---
At the end of the day, we're playing WSG, not arena, and a budget priest or druid or shaman is probably swaying the game in your favor more than the 6th fully twinked rogue.  Just my two cents.  Gap is def big between budget gear and not, but playskill and class composition matter more.
---
Its called discord, you have 1 guy say ”3 2 1 queue” then u check if every1 got the same AV.
---
Mind blowing shit i know
---
"how do you leave?" lol. it is cool seeing lok tho
---
Fact people that brag how much they make IRL are really on welfare.
---
Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should lol. I get that it's just a game but ruining other people's fun for your own sake is kinda the basis for shitty morals.
---
The problem is that to do this, you literally have to sacrifice your health. If you want rank 14 you have to hold in shits and give up other parts of your lifestyle.
---
It's not unreasonable to tell people that hey, if you stop caring about rep and maybe dick around in AV a little bit you'll have some really fun pvp encounters
---
It's fine to claim that everybody min-maxing super hard might not actually be playing how they would rather be playing, when they hit exalted and realize it was just another grind and they missed out on some potentially fun experiences.
---
Meta slave is a great term to describe it. I saw it in gw2 as well. People sweating bullets over assigning Meta builds in spvp. At least there everyone is wearing identical gear. 
---
Being a meta slave in wow, doing a gear chance on top of sweating over every talent point, sounds horrible.
---
lol, I've stood there and mana burned a mage down to nothing. I think they forget that it does damage too, so they never CS it.  And if they do, I just heal myself.  If they poly me to reset, I wait til im full and trinket out of it and then dot, silence or fear, depending on the situation. 
---
One even stood there and wanded me. I was like really? and then a guildie rolled up and flattened him.
---
Are you implying that blizzard can make the game 100% grief free?
---
Because that would be wrong.
---
Go back to retail.
---
Here is every old AV.
---
There is a blob of people shooting back and forth, almost exclusively ranged because any melee would die the instant they ran out.  Then a bunch of people doing nothing but gathering wolves/rams or looting corpses for turn ins or clearing the mines for supplies on the off chance you got a cavalry charge or summoned the boss.
---
It would go on forever because no matter how much you did you could never gain much ground.  The only progress which was ever made was when a bunch of people left the game and new people wouldn't come in very fast.  It ends up the same, something people do for an hour or so the kill time and then leave.  The current AV sucks too, but that's because AV sucks ass in general.  Always has and always will.
---
Wrong. While I get the idea that esports and sports share elemental similarity in the spirit of competition, they are not the same. 
---
I can play football in my backyard, but I will never be Aaron Rodgers. People watch Aaron Rodgers because he can do things other people can't.
---
I can play WoW, I will never waste time watching a stranger play it live instead of playing it myself.
---
is this marked as nsfw cuz you got fucked by the iceboi??
---
Excellent distillation of the situation. This subreddit is not even close to being a representation of the way most people feel about vanilla. It is inordinately populated with people who have idyllic views of something that many people even at the time considered deeply broken. 
---
Vanilla is not great because of the indefensible class imbalance or tedious bullshit or broken and exploitable systems; it is great in spite of them. I would say a good argument can be made for a better game that maintains the broad pillars of vanilla but fixes much of the broken shit, but I don't have to because Blizzard already made it lol.
---
I FREAKING LOVE YA!  
---
ty, it worked :D
---
Can I get an invite to the discord?
---
I am assuming your Ony buff, Trubute buffs, as well as the cleansed flower all fell off at Rag.
---
I miss Thunderstorming people off EotS.
---
Are you not supposed to be feral? 
---
What spec are flagrunners? Resto?
---
As a hunter this still gets me now and then...
---
It will be a while before BWL is here. You're a Druid, so getting gear for you should be somewhat fast as there are so few of them. If you continue to raid til P3 you will be fine.
---
Prolly just go on an rp-pvp server or pve. Pvp servers are pretty cancerous.
---
It's used for breaking roots etc, it doesn't really matter if its dispelled. It's use is more reactive than proactive. Have you actually played many 19 twink games?
---
Of course it's a bit more complicated then just people being upset about it being a game they aren't interested in. There's so many things about that announcement that were just horribly organized. 
---
I'm not even going to get into all of it because it's old news now and it's been talked about to death. There's literally a dozen things wrong with the way Blizzard handled that entire announcement.
---
I don't think so. With that aura buff they had stacking x4 you wouldn't be able to fight one if all 4 were up.
---
&gt;He wasn't accidentally right, he was just right.
---
Bullshit.
---
Imagine your favorite food.
---
You think you like it, but you don't.
---
Proof:  I guarantee you that if I cook it, you won't want to eat it.
---
Is that proof that you wouldn't actually want to eat it if it were prepared by a competent cook?
---
Blizzard have absolutely not made a good faith attempt to produce an enjoyable game here.
---
Hm I have an 18 Hunter is too late to turn him into a twink? When do I need to go for gear if not? It's been 15 years
---
Where do you farm?
---
Tryharding yet doing less dps than i did week 2 in blues. Ok mate.
---
maily just cause its 19.5 dps, compared to 17 blues and 14 greens that youd get at that level
---
This is incredible.
---
&gt; killing random idiots who just want to run to the last boss isn't "pvp"
---
ahh so you have a strict definition of what can be considered PVP based on your own opinion, very interesting...
---
I was in several AVs on Nostalrius that had lasted for over 20 hours.
---
Predictable or not, it's an obvious exploit and the people doing it are assholes. That's my bottom line. It's obvious that I could benefit myself by doing something selfish and detrimental to others in many situations, both in video games and in the real world. That doesn't mean I'm justified in doing so because it's technically possible to do it.
---
No need for anyone to respec really, like you said AV honor meta is a quick pve fight.
---
impressive
---
the amount of people who start whining about wanting the game to end or who actually start leaving after like 15m is just so fucking sad
---
Exactly.  A lot of people play games to escape their life or to seek challenges and rewards for "progression" because they can't find it elsewhere.  Unfortunately, modern game design thrives on taking advantage of people that are unable to find happiness in real life.  
---
There was a time when a buddy of mine showed me his insane min/maxed all classes maxed out account.  He was expecting me to be impressed, but instead my reaction was "What the fuck are you doing with your life?". He took that as jealousy, it wasn't.   I probably could have reacted better, but seriously....  he didn't play any other game and was ducking out of hanging out in real life.  We aren't friends anymore.
---
It sucks.
---
Speaking of, since AB is the only great BG, when is that released? P5? No projection for how far away that is?
---
By the time most regular Mythic guilds reached (Or more like had to go to) the true DPS check bosses like Krosus or Star Augur they already had 54 naturally as far as I remember.
---
That definitely didn't happen.
---
You are going to town on each other's base...
---
Gaming as a whole is super toxic. The release of classic was not goin to make everyone magically nice again like it was 10 years ago.
---
I would love to play that.
---
8/11/32 is usually the spec. Being able to self heal is pretty important.
---
By looking at that image alone I'd say Priest.
---
We did this all the time in vanilla and not just for one games but whole nights / days
---
Whatever man.
---
Well, I guess once we are exalted with AV, most of us will do WSG. It way more competitive. But I am not after rank13-14 so... you know.
---
Other than the people literally doing exactly that right now for honor and rep...  At least in the old AV it was interesting to see if you could figure out how to pull off the impossible/damn hard victory for no other reason than to know you'd done it or brag to others that you'd done it.  Ultimately that's all WoW or any other MMO is.  Enjoy the journey.  Stop worrying about the destination.
---
Still quite a hard concept for people to grasp
---
*clicks second nice*
---
Also tanks, you dont need to run 40 yards to grab that one mob from me. There are like 14 different things I can do to handle the situation.
---
that Star Ruby is what it's all about.  Grats man!
---
Bad advice!
---
Load up on loot and find a new guild when it falls apart.
---
I'm AFK honor farming tons of honor and rep. Get it while the gettings good boys.
---
I only actually "participated" in about 4 games and I'm almost exalted.
---
Blame Blizzard.
---
Yeah I totally agree that the "conflict" is natural given that you both prefer different things that are a bit at odds with each other. I agree that it's just a normal part of an MMO.
---
As long as nobody is a dick to each other hopefully, then it's all good!
---
Tier 1 gear is not good for PVE healing . Blue items from dungeons are BiS.
---
She got blood in her eyes damn
---
As someone who played the original Resident Evil 2 at least 50 times with my friends, but couldn't even get the  group together to play the remake once due in part to everybody having responsibilities and commitments in life, this resonates with me
---
Oh man. This is super cool. This one is an absolute unit!
---
If you feel bad about it, simply leave them quick message telling them how you feel. Everything you just mentioned makes perfect sense. Either way, you are not the asshole. It sucks in a situation like this because you not being present affects other guild members, but that's not your fault. You didn't create this problem, and you shouldn't feel bad about it! The whole point of playing this game should be to have fun, and it doesn't sound like you're having fun right now...

I am having a similar issue.  I ran probably 30-40 AVs yesterday getting 2k-4k bonus honor from each, and when I checked my honor this morning it shows me at approx. 12.5K honor.
---
I got kicked for taming rams
---
&gt;I for one have lost all respect for him 
---
You had previously respected an obese video game streamer covered in tattoos?
---
I literally have had zero bad interactions with anyone playing Classic.
---
How ? Random out, premade in. Even if the premade gets left behind its still better than a random getting left behind
---
That's exactly what I use.  Shadow+Grid2 for frames, and Clique for bindings.
---
Perfect setup for me.
---
How dare you
---
Does it hit hard? How many hp does it have? Is it hard to kill?
---
Shrug, I was in a premade myself with about 15-20.  No, not everyone made it in each time, but we would always have at least one tank of the 3-4 make it in, along with 2-4 of the healers.
---
Choosing a human was your first mistake in classic
---
step 1: be alliance.
---
profit.
---
Yeah, there were pandaren. They weren't anything like Kung Fu Panda. Now both they and their areas are *exactly* like Kung Fu Panda.

---
I've been doing a bit of strat live tank service, reserving all orbs. Depending on the time of day the time to get a group together will vary according to players online as well as how many others are doing something similar. I'm a relatively geared prot warrior so I haven't had any major problems getting people but due to the stigma against bears your experience may be different. On my server an orb sells for ~30g, so getting 1-3 per run is very solid. Our main tank got 8 orbs in a run once, so that was an easy ~240g.
---
I have had framerate issues since the last patch for no reason..
---
&gt;We’re all in the same boat after all.
---
Yup, which is why I don't mind forting the tank. And I understand your situation/scenario, its just that your post started off really condescending, like priests aren't doing their jobs and that's part of the attitude that just makes you kinda sigh.
---
I suppose you are fine with corrupt politicians then (after all, they are just taking advantage of a busted system), or consider that a thief isn't to blame if someone didn't locked properly the door.
---
The AFK system is shitty but it take a really asshole to use it to fuck with other people
---
Yeah and theres also fights where certain people just get unlucky... getting mind controlled at insta killed by cleaves on the first boss, for example.
---
Nostalrius was 4+ years ago and it was most people's first time playing vanilla again since retail vanilla.  It was extremely rare would any AV on the most recent private servers would last longer than 20 minutes.
---
If you say so.
---
Here is what I am getting out of all of this.
---
I am a rogue.  I really don't min/max.  I don't really try hard.  I don't think I am particularly good or super well geared.  I am probably average.
---
Despite all of that I can crush someone who parses as the best ret paladin in the world and that means they aren't THAT bad?
---
There’s not much by default, but addons can get pretty nutty fast. Just gotta stay on top of it and keep it clean.
---
This is the kind of shitposting I want.
---
What does parsing mean in this context?
---
I agree. I log in, play, have fun... make another alt... play the same things again... yet still having fun.
---
The flaw with your defense is the notion that everybody knows how to play to create fun experiences for themselves
---
This is wrong - some people are undoubtedly pressured into grinding or "minmaxing" in opposition to a different strategy that might end up being more fun for them.
---
If you zimply zerg the final boss in AV every game, yeah of course it's going to get stale. If you try something different, you might realize that *your strategy was wrong*, and that you were playing in a way that isn't as fun for you, and you change your behavior.
---
I've had a blast in some AVs, even if many are just quick caps - which is fine too, I'm certainly getting rep faster than I did in vanilla
---
For Alliance it's Dwarf.
---
having one point in imp enrage will let you charge -&gt; bash way more easily when shifting to bear. if you wear wolfshead during pvp though, then you don’t need imp enrage at all. i would move one point into insect swarm and keep the other in imp enrage unless i knew i’d always have wolfshead on.
---
Dude, what kinda crazy false equivalence is this?
---
World of warcraft is a game where you are *supposed* to work toward your character's benefit. Blizzard is *incentivizing* the system that screws over other players. And then *you* are *blaming the player* for *doing the only thing you're ever supposed to do in this game*.
---
I think the reason is that there isn't much trend to be seen in rep per time. Think what you can see is that if you are going to lose then lose fast for rep. Otherwise you need to win to gain more rep. So maybe we are seeing 2 different lines in the rep per min, the "loss line" that trends down as time goes. and the "win line" that also trends down, they are just offset from eachother.
---
&gt; I can play football in my backyard, but I will never be Aaron Rodgers. People watch Aaron Rodgers because he can do things other people can't.
---
I can play League of Legends all day but I will never be Faker. People watch Faker because he can do things other people can't.
---
Look how easy this works?
---
How do you find that much plate healing gear?
---
You are not the majority, you are the exemption.
---
There's always one like that, and in vanilla it was usually a fury warrior.
---
&gt; If 5 players vote you afk before you exit the starting tunnel at the beginning of a match you get auto kicked. This isn't like the debuff when the game is running that gives you 2-3 mins to engage in pvp. 
---
&gt; Premades are doing this to get slots for their members, guaranteeing slots for themselves. This won't be fixed, and it sucks, and I've seen it usually targets non level 60s atm. Just throwing a heads up for everyone. If you can't get out of the tunnel before 5 of them vote you afk you're done.
---
Just wait till people start getting closer to Grand Marshall / High Warlord. You will be seeing people do this to people competing for it just to screw them over.
---
No, I'm not running honor spy.
---
I’m not calculating my honor, it’s what the blizzard honor tab shows then all of a sudden doesn’t.
---
No, its pretty much all of you tbh.
---
Solid comeback yeet boi zoomer.
---
Idk that rank 14 gear is way better for me than most of my pve BiS
---
I've got all my pre-raid BiS and my epic mount so I there's not much point in running 5-mans, plus the 1.5 hour it takes to find a tank and then body run to the instance has taken all the fun out of it. I don't really need the gold so I don't care to farm mara or SFK. Don't really care to zerg AV. Maybe when AB comes out and I can do some pre-mades.
---
Who gives a shit though if someone wants to play ret or enhance?  It's not some massive sacrifice to bring them. 
---
It's just so lame of an opinion  tbh.
---
Frenzied regeneration might be handy for that
---
nah complicit would mean he's actually hitting the report button, alot of people dont want to stop playing with a premade because its the most efficient honor yet strongly disagree with the idea of reporting people afk
---
We do 2 to 4 Onys per week and usually get 2-3 T2 helmets, all our Rogues have it already... Only 2 Vis + 1 Brut + 1 corehound + 3 perditions since day 1 of raiding, overall is OK, we do have 12 Rogues but we split in 2 cores so 6 in each.. We're doing ok!
---
There is no 5 man content that is so difficult you can't bring a Ret pally, Boomkin, Shadow Priest etc. I'll bring people with a good attitude every day of the week regardless of their chosen class/spec. I main a tank so it's mostly on me how smooth the run is going to be anyway but I could care less if I fill a dps slot with a boomkin as long as they're a chill person.
---
You should have a "main" tank regardless, and then the rest of the tanks should be put into a tank pool. There's so many fights where there's really 1 person taking a disproportionate amount of damage, and so having 1 really geared tank makes a lot of sense.
---
With SK, the way this should work is:
---
&gt;Loot drops
---
&gt;MT has first prio, regardless of position on the list
---
&gt;All OTs have second prio after MT, based on their position on the SK list
---
&gt;Everyone else can roll, based on their position on the SK list
---
&gt;Whoever gets the item gets booted to the end of the list
---
So just because an item has tank prio, doesn't mean it's free. This also means that tanks won't be able to stack DKP for rare, good DPS items; which is how it should work. They get the advantage of getting all the tank gear, and the disadvantage of basically being at the end of the list all the time and are unable to get DPS gear. This also balances out the OTs, so that you aren't resorting to loot council; you just do it based on DKP in the SK list.
---
Succubus will not stay if the bar has been agroed. 
---
She does give a quest to help drug her love interest. 🤣  
---
The bar has 4 different bosses. 
---
1 in the store room when you break the kegs
---
1 wanted goblin with bodyguards, talk to the goblin pull him into the store room
---
Barkeep - drops ok rogue gear but best to do him last if you plan to. Req pulling some of the close patrons before you kill him
---
Bouncer - who will open the door to kick out the succubus love dwarf out.  
---
Over all its a great place!
---
Yeah, a big issue is a lot of people try to get in underleveled and that makes it take longer. Not a big issue for healers, since we can’t miss heals, but tanks and dps making fights take longer really tacks on overal time.
---
&gt; While I get the idea that esports and sports share elemental similarity in the spirit of competition, they are not the same.
---
&gt; ...
---
&gt; We don't watch Aaron Rodgers practice football, why would I watch a streamer practice a video game?
---
First of all, e-sports and streaming are not the same thing...
---
Second, you think you can even come close to the skill level of professional e-sports players even if you invested your life into it? Probably not.
---
This is basically why I preferred TBC.  Most of the worst flaws of Vanilla were corrected, and most of the questionable (to be charitable) game designs hadn't come into existence, or at least hadn't been dramatically over-done.
---
That said, there were still new flaws and improvements made every expansion and so there's certainly room to debate where exactly things truly went "wrong" with WoW.
---
I wasn't going to start until 60 so thats not a problem. Right now I only have 200 +shadow damage. Would you suggest playing sm/ds Or you think ds/ruin would be enough with 200+ shadow damage?
---
“Hello fellow n00bs”

At the rate at which people is repping up, expect to see a shitload of pig heads everywhere all the time now.

tfw OP has a downtown apartment and my Belltown Seattle apt is some old 2016 build that's only $2.2k a month in rent and I only make $170k TC with 2 YOE bc I'm a poverty level SDE1 at a FANG
---
But OP apparently makes over $2 million a year so that's impressive kudos
---
I don't know about his but here is mine: [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/500132131-2305013-050232410301](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/500132131-2305013-050232410301)

My time has come. For too long I have needed to be in a group or fear my life in open world PvP.
---
Today is the day.  30/0/21.  Now they won’t look at me and see free honor or a helpless healer.
---
All they will see is 3 spells hit them in the span of a second as they die. 
---
I am become death.
---
Tons of my old guildies coming back to retail and crying for their raid spot...
---
Sure thats a opti case. If you take longer for wins or lose you can add extra time.
---
"An argument against having fun"
---
&gt;You're trying to dictate what specs people can and can't play and being offended when they call you out on it.
---
I've never "tried to dictate what specs people can and can't play".
---
Meanwhile, the anti-minmax crowd constantly screeches and cries about "DUH MINMAXURS", proclaiming that anyone who "minmaxes" is wrong and bad and terrible and playing the game wrong.
---
I guess it's a difference of philosophy. Ive always enjoyed pvp games where the gear wasn't the overwhelm deciding factor of a match-up. I realize in the minority though.
---
30/0/21
---
It's an ele build with strong healing potential because of nature's swiftness, or you could pop NS and Chain lightning some people in the face. It's flexible. 
---
[Link](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/elemental-shaman-dps-pvp-classic-wow)
---
Because you're saying that the only reason theres whining is because of a vocal minority circlejerk. I'm asking you if you would be whining if you where on flamelash where the game had become literally unplayable
---
Say something that legitimately discredits anything I suggested and I'll happily listen and debate. Ad hominem attacks dont add to the conversation. 
---
You did want to add to the conversation right?
---
You might find spots as an off-tank for more casual groups - main tanking raids sounds like it will be hard for you in 40mans, but also could be possible in 20mans when we have ZG and AQ20.
---
Now that is an old meme.
---
I respectfully disagree.
---
If the shaman KILLS the enemy, then all that dps the enemy was doing becomes damage prevented= good healer
---
He did the same thing in retail raids. He would have his guild pull him through and get him gear while he played Fortnite on stream. 
---
Streamer do this shit because they have sycophants who will do it.
---
Shit! you are right, editted my original post.
---
Everyone I don't like is a pserver!!!
---
Yup and recording gameplay now puts it in a folder named "_classic_"
---
I hit revered in around 10-12 hours or so. I did the quests with the exception of getting the tools in the mines. Those are a waste of time. Just queueing up and rushing drek. The true skill to not waste time is realizing when it's going to turn into a turtle and akfing out to keep up quick games. Sometimes the 15 minute deserter is way better than getting stuck in a 30 min game
---
That's... not a reboot, that's a sequel. Like EverQuest 2, or Final Fantasy 14. WoW's the most successful MMO of all time, it's just ran its course.
---
Never say never because it was possible... before phase 2.
---
Yes like 50% of the playerbase since pvp gear is mostly useless for most chars except for a few items.
---
Yo this is illegal. Mods ban this man.
---
How about honor-efficient BGs that require PvP to win?
---
Too much to ask? Damn.
---
Private server AV's had to be a different version, as the current meta is completely unique to Classic. 
---
Something about just the two raid groups just passing each other in the Field of Strife feels so soulless to me. I ran in and dropped frost nova on them and got AFK voted out by the Horde, it felt awful man. I hope that when people are all starting to hit exalted and the rep grinders get more serious about honor that it changes, I got to experience one sort of "true" AV last night and it was really fun. It's a shame, but I'm not necessarily mad at people because it's crazy fast and the rewards are really good, so I understand.
---
 Gotcha
---
Grind the grind somewhere else, like learning an instrument or building something. Games give that instant feedback but as we get older we often realize nothing in the game is real or has any meaning (except the experiences/social bits, like memories of raiding). 
---
I say this as someone who's been waiting for classic WoW since..... vanilla WoW and now that we have it the whole thing rings hollow to me. I played for a few weeks and realized that none of it really matters and I just quit a while back. Whenever I played I felt guilty I wasn't doing things that i'd get more out of (programming, woodworking, guitar).
---
I hear what you're saying, though.
---
That's because you are one of the douches corpse camping, and you're killing the enemy more then 3 times. The system doesn't take in account at the time how many times you killed the person (you should be), and they are taking away the honor you didn't actually earn.  And you are admittedly at being quite the tool for losing that much honor.  Jesus, show some compassion to your enemy.
---
1300 is like an Indian massage
---
Never blame the user. They are doing what users do.
---
Blame the system and then fix it
---
You can buy more arrows than the quiver allows, it will just end up in your other bags but you still benefit from the quivers attack speed increase.

Why should I bother clearing a raid for some fucktard who isn't pulling his weight but rolling on gear? If we can steam through it with 20 people, why take a 21st who doesn't do shit but still wants gear? Fuck that guy especially.
---
low level mage isn't great, like each mob takes your entire mana bar so some bad resists and its game over. But on my alt I'm now 36 and that problem has disappeared.
---
Wowhead lists 23 mobs that drop them at a .02-.04% rate.
---
You sound like somebody i'd put on my ignore list.
---
Yep it's super helpful. And with pvp trinket/form shifting I can get out of most things that stun/stop me.
---
&gt; Yeah, but you can also play with Faker and in the same league as him. 
---
No I can't because he plays in another part of the world and I'm garbage at the game.
---
You should give them the same respect you give any other normal person.. but to put them up on some kind of peddestol is gross.
---

My guild master averages 4 hrs of sleep a night. Will totally hit HWL. It’s very possibly to live on 4 hrs of sleep. You just have to be wired that way.
---
I’ve been running AV non stop asshole
---
He literally said esports.
---
You're already wasting your time playing this game dumbass
---
Nobody is interested in healing anyone other than the FC it seems. I caught a heal maybe 3 or 4 times at most during last nights WSG binge.
---
So more accurately given that you had a 4man stack, a tank who is in high demand and can join whatever group he wants didn't want to run with a lower level play as there was a good chance it may hinder him, and no way in hell they'd be offering anything a level60 dps couldn't? 
---
This seems like a weird hill to die on in that case, tanks can be picky, it is what it is because no one wants to do it and it's not about min-maxing, it's just about having too much choice.
---
Some people can't fathom that some of us *want* the drawn out battle. If it doesn't conform to their view of "fun", then it *cannot* be fun. The "rose-tinted goggles" argument is the same as the "you think you do, but you don't" mindset.
---
This is such a mess that I'm just glad that I don't have to play with the people arguing.
---
Crazy people are grinding something that has BIS weapons/off hands/rings before warsong
---
Needs more night elf flipping.
---
There's a massive difference between bringing a 58 to Scholo and bringing a 56 to Scholo. I'll bring a 58, but I won't bring a 56. With a 56 you're clearing noticeably more mobs.
---
i disagree. theres going to still be tons of people over the next month wanting to hit exalted. based on efficiency like ive said 3 times, drek is still faster and going to remain the meta. Horde rush Balinda and get a ton of honor for a 7 min loss. Most of the time they get balinda first so galv is actually useless. and if you dont have coordination with 5 people getting LTs or the entire team rush galv then drek, its not going to work. dont expect anything to change man. sorry thats how it is.
---
Herod was astounding p2 and I feel bad for pve players that missed that wild ride of wpvp.
---
We did 40 this morning, usually ended up with at least 5 in a different BG.
---
Blizzard replaced the GMs with a automatic report system.
---
Thats what happend.
---
Now groups of players can judge over solo players. 
---
but just bully minoritys, its not racism.
---
Stop trying to use logic. The PvE carebears can't compute logic. They like their easy rep grind and that's all that matters to them.
---
I missed having the nature alignment crystal and zhc grab beserking pop both. pew pew.
---
It's pretty amusing how people blame everything on "pserver players", conveniently ignoring that pserver players are the entire reason why we have Classic in the first place.
---
The design of the game requires a level of policing that is basically untenable for a community this large. Maybe it's easy to snuff out shit like this on one server, but the fault lies with the design of the game 100%. 
---
This is why games like this do not get made anymore. This is why many of the changes to WoW over the years exist explicitly to make the game asshole-proof. 
---
It is an entertainment product that exists to earn money for a public company. It is not a life simulator that must achieve a level of integrity so high that it warrants hundreds of people working around the clock just to prevent the community of subnormal losers from breaking it. 
---
The game is busted from the ground up.
---
Pretty sure it's just a Weakaura. There's dozens of them for every class and spec online :) Super useful for customizing your UI, especially resource bars and procs.
---
The fact that blame is placed on the system rather than the dysfunctional sociopaths attempting to exploit it for gain is mind boggling to me.   This is no different than a psychopath stealing a gun then using it to murder someone, then being told it's the guns fault (laws) not the person's.  Exploitation and disregard to all other cultural aspects is the norm today.  It's pathetic and no matter how hard anyone tries it cannot be justified.   An entire world of people who live believing the ends outweigh the means to it regardless of who it effects on the way.
---
Fap + Sprint. Laugh at the two rogue defending the flag.
---
[Elemental advice](https://imgur.com/a/jsXsnjZ)
---
One consideration: gearing will be very simple on a warrior and much more challenging on a rogue.
---
As a warrior you have plate, mail and leather options - you also have the option to use axes - you can also use both one handed and two handed weapons (2h DPS is perfectly viable for casual alliance players).
---
As a rogue you will find it much harder to find dungeon groups. If you are interested at all in damage meters (and let's be real, most of us care a little bit) you will also find it frustrating that warriors tend to outperform you.

---
&gt;First of all, e-sports and streaming are not the same thing...
---
The original comment I replied to connected watching wow streams with sports.
---
&gt;Second, you think you can even come close to the skill level of professional e-sports players even if you invested your life into it? Probably not.
---
I'm not a professional esports gamer, but I'm also not streaming my daily play of world of warcraft expecting people to treat me like I am. That begs the question, why would anybody watch many of the WoW streams out there. You're trying to equate wow streaming with competitive tournament esports play, and they are absolutely not the same.
---
Feral is fine they are faster then restro (cat speed increase+ dash) allow you to take a alternate ways through the tunnel. Faster.  
---
Best is if you manage to do cat -&gt; speed buff -&gt; dash down out. Followed by a hot / cheetah. 
---
Yes NS allow you to do it safer but feral is fine.  
---
0/30/21 is a good option.
---
Pretty reasonable mistake for someone who's only heard it out loud. Funny that you're able to be this pedantic and still make the mistake of writing "beeline" as two words.
---
But if you cure cancer you are contributing to the rapidly increasing world population! /s

---
Okay, but i'm not on Flamelash. So how could i have the perspective of what it's like to play on Flamelash? You see what im saying about reddit being a circlejerk?
---
Yep my thoughts exactly. In my games he died once and sat in the graveyard the rest of the game.
---
There are people who play video games who are just simply better than you, play better, play smarter, play more efficiently.  Same reason people like to watch football, there are people playing who can do things you simply can't.. talking streaming in general.
---
You are comparing to people in the 99.999th percentile of their chosen "sport".  It's the same thing.  I'm not good enough to play with Faker and i'm not good enough to play with Rodgers.  Idk why you think it's any different.
---
Also, you realize that the NFL practices are open to the public right?  People actually do go and watch.
---
&gt; Because the player base didn’t exploit every single min/max advantage capable back then.  
---
Theorycrafting was big then, too.
---
WSG is my favourite BG after AB.
---
If you were putting for the same effort in on a non meme melee spec, you'd be pulling double the numbers. [98% Rogue for example.](https://i.imgur.com/nZub79t.jpg)
---
Don't get me wrong, my guild intentionally runs meme specs because it's fun (we have the best ret and feral dps on the server, and are actively searching for a boomkin), but they are typically MUCH worse than the traditional specs they're replacing.
---
I haven't found a blue sapphire in weeks
---
I have heard advocates for 62 level cap, and using those 2 levels to correct scaling issues while not invalidating prior raid content.

As a horde, I wouldn't express it in wins. I won 1 game out of 19 thus far - am honored.

Oh damn, my phone loaded it wrong the first time and it was just a horizontal line of data points. I see it now, and yeah it paints a pretty clear picture. Thanks for the info!
---
You're right it isn't a comparison, TBC is a far better game in every aspect. But Classic will suffice for now.
---
Hold up. Are you saying I should have taken the crossbow?
---
I think watching people play your videogames is the most zoomer thing I've heard 🤣
---
What's fascinating is the fact that the above commenter said nothing against casuals' desired form of play, yet you still felt the need to attack them for existing.
---
Seems like your name is contradictory.
---
I can’t tell if you’re serious or not, but just having “Chinese” based characters in a fantasy setting does not equal bowing down to the CCP. 
---
I agree that Blizz are Chinese shills though.
---
I did the same in BC when the reflective dmg disc shield was top level.  Just outhealed people for 10 minutes and eventually they stood there and let us kill them
---
but muh honor/rep gainz
---
Oh I'm talking about ret, enh, boomies, spriests, ele...
---
Not understanding your spec is a different animal.   IMO as long as you're trying I'm happy.
---
My whole argument was simply that WoW streamers are not involved in anything that could be construed as esports competition and therefore the comment that people watch wow streamers for the same reason they watch sports is flat wrong.
---
Honor Spy got broken, so it can no longer effectively communicate across a server and is therefore non-functional right now.
---
That's what happens when people are doing it for the rep rewards.
---
Who's this fuckn live lord mage
---
Yo for real I can barely find people to group with for WSG cause everyone is just trying to rush exalted for AV.... like what’s the rush of getting it one day faster. “Id love to play wsg but I just want to get AV over with.” Lol what!!?
---
Weak
---
We have rolling for loot, but we at least limit some gear to be Main Tank rolls only as well as a few other exceptions. 
---
If a guild/raid doesn't understand that gearing the guy between them and raid damage isn't the best idea... then find another one.
---
Loading screens were my pee breaks you silly goose
---
You're acting like ALL min/maxers are like this. It's a generalization and it's inappropriate.
---
Idk, I felt pretty good until I hit 35. The heartburn is real though.
---
Battlegrounds were pretty cool, IMO. Exploits like the one here are not, but hell, that's not even an exploit that was possible in classic.
---
This is an issue of what is spammed. It was always gonna be something, but how things are tuned, it will be an AV zergfest.
---
"MOST EFFICIENT WAY AT WASTING MY TIME PLEASE"
---
It sounds like you still have a love for the game but the guild situation is the cause of the apathy. This solution is to find a new guild and rekindle the love for the game. If you have a healer and a tank with good parses in logs to back up your claims then you will be snatched up by any guild.
---
Ab and wsg are where the pvp is at. Av has been a zerg rush for a most of wow's existence.
---
Like the NFL draft? That is a professional event, a feature show. WoW streamers do not broadcast competition, nor do they really attempt to feature anything beyond their own brand as an influencer.
---
Vambraces of the sadist are 7 more strength and 6 more stam than battleborn.
---
Bloodseeker is 8 more strength and 4 more agility than Satyrs bow. Blood seeker+battleborn is definitely the better combo for PvE damage.
---
Either way IBS for a warrior that is under level 60 is 100% the right choice though. IBS is an insane 2-hander at level 51, it's basically the best pre-raid 2 hander available (that or demonshear). It's better than vendorstrike a raid 2 hander (which is a shame because vendorstrike model is fuckin sick).
---
51-60 is a breeze with that weapon.
---
One of the Twitch streams for the retail world first race brought in discount Ron Jeremy to be one of the hosts. Method and Limit were on break and the other hosts were talking about Limit's strat and he tried to derail the conversation to Classic. Unbelievable that this guy was somehow seen as a representative of the Classic community. All of his talk about the journey that is Classic and what did he do? He just spammed dungeons with Asmongold to get to 60. He's not a mentally unhinged, raging jerk like other streamers is the only positive thing I can say about him.
---
He's a low skill player playing a low skill ceiling class poorly. I saw a video of Advertise spamming him with rank 1 SWP so he would OOM himself and got him to waste a bubble and other heavy cooldowns before killing him. My guess is Advertise did that as a reaction to "All Advertise has is MCing people off bridges" comment. I generally don't watch streamers, but I went down the wormhole watching Advertise's YouTube after seeing the ban thread posted here. It's pretty funny watching one guy getting multiple streamers and their guilds ticked off and highlighting how bad they are.
---
Got a 100g recipe in there.
---
To be a bit serious for a moment.
---
Honestly Its been a bit wierd. After i finally got both Perdition’s blade and core hound tooth. I have felt a much stronger want to join random pugs for dungeons i got no loot in.
---
Its fun earning gold that way and you kinda become a savior to them when you join with your 450dps.
---
&gt; Wrong. While I get the idea that **esports** and sports share elemental similarity in the spirit of competition, they are not the same.
---
These are your words.  You might want to edit your original comment.
---
Funny enough programming is one of the things I’ve started to grind. I want to make my own simple game and go on to more complex ones from there
---
The new game I started to grind is competitive Smash Bros. I’ve been getting a lot more fulfillment from seeing my skills in it grow. Plus going to tournaments are such a fun experience that it reminds me of raiding. Especially when you live in a state like Georgia where the scene is really strong
---
Oh, let's imagine that honor=money, but price for ranks based on amount of money of other people. 
---
So on dead server you can get br1 with 200k, on active server you can get br1 with 1000k
---
You don't blame the people in the prisoner's dilemma, you blame the people that put them in the dilemma. In this case, Blizzard. They purposefully chose to add this feature that was not present previously and it has a detrimental effect because people are assholes. People are always going to be assholes, you can't prevent that. You can prevent giving them more tools to be an asshole to others though.
---
what if :((( i dont get :((( my guaranteed exalted rewards :((( as soon as literally possible :((( what if i have to :((( play a 30min BG???? :(((
---
With bgs, the world is back to normal. You can go back to your 50 if you want. All the griefers are in AV still not having any fun.
---
reality: all versions of AV are bad
---
Yeah that’s probably true.
---
I didn't say streamers couldn't be entertaining. I merely dismissed the idea that people watch WoW streams for the same reason they watch sports and I am basing that opinion on the fact that WoW is not even close to an esport.
---
How useful is +frost damage for AOE farm mages?

I found a green bracer with +8 frost dmg and I was wondering when INT would outpace it

&gt; be active outside of gaming.

What does this mean?
---
If you got robbed and called the police and they said "it's not our fault it's the robber's" would you think that's acceptable?
---
Yes, that’s the best way to do it
---
Well there goes my plan
---
they do a lot of shady SEO tricks, but youtube don't mattee because they turn a profit
---
Druid then you get to be both a warrior and a rogue.  Bears are not only viable dungeon tanks many actually prefer them for 5 man content.  The warrior tank doesn't truly shine until you're doing raids and even then a guild is likely to want one of their tanks to be a bear.
---
You got streamers reporting people afk in AV that aren't actually AFK but they just want them to get deserter to slow down their honor grind because said person is solo queuing and is close to their honor brackets.
---
I’m exalted, so I’ve ran allot and won allot. I have over 1000 kills in Av this week. I did log out and log in and 167,000 honor has returned. But today’s 30,000 is still missing
---
**Alliance PvP player here**. I loved WPvP during Vanilla, BC, and WotLK. This Classic WPvP is not the same. It seems that most people agree it is because the server population is way above what Vanilla was meant for. It has been just so extremely frustrating. However, the last two nights have been fun, questing with some organic WPvP mixed in, so it may be fixed now.  
---
**Also, this AV sucks balls. People that say the old 1.5 - 1.7 AV was garbage are just the** ***extremely vocal minority*** **that wants to mindlessly farm honor and are afraid Blizz might take that away from them.**
---
Why is it questionable when my guild came to me and said they needed a ret paladin in their raid.
---
It's not like I am trying to top dps. What you are saying just doesn't make sense in my case.
---
It's been 2 days.
---
fInAlLy!
---
I'm on firemaw EU which is a relatively competitive server I think, pretty large at least, with queues ranging from 30-90 minutes during peak hours. I've had people not want to join because I had reserved all orbs, but I haven't had anyone message me and say that I was in the wrong. An alternative is splitting orbs 50/50 with a healer so that you only need to fill the three dps spots. Makes getting groups faster but of course cuts into your gold/hr as well.
---
All fun and games until feign gets resisted...
---
If you use the twitch app, it should in theory pick up the addons in the folder and apply/update them automatically.
---
Worked fine for me when I did it. It's much easier with the Twitch app.
---
I can't find it either. My speculation is: auruas then buffs then passive spells/abilities, then stats
---
&gt; I was off by 1 meter. That's not as big of a deal as he makes it. He took that one number and made it into a load of stats and values, putting min-max attitude into it, when the rogue player knew to play it safe and did.
---
When people say things like this I realise just how unwinnable these conversations are. People have made up their minds that anyone with a different opinion than them is a min/maxing turbosperg and use it as a basis to dismiss any dissent.
---
Toxicity is the core attitude here, just like OP said. There are toxic people. Min/maxers who are toxic will ram it down your throat. Casual players who are toxic will ram it down your throat.
---
You're the latter here.
---
The full rewards are not in the game.  AV is missing the caster ring, and WSG does not have any of the wrist rewards.  Blizzard made a post yesterday or the day before stating that these items would be released with BWL in early 2020.
---
So this is inherently a problem with the honor system, and it doesn't change unless AV and WSG(and eventually AB) all consistently always reward the same honor per hour.  
---
And further more regardless of which BG happens to be the best for honor grinding most people will never get high ranks in honor anyways so it doesn't particularly matter.
---
Most people are smashing AV right now for rep not honor.
---
They are tuned to 1.12. Your issue is you don’t like what is technically the most honor, so you want them to change it. Sorry bud, not everyone gets their way.
---
This seems more and more common with the younger generation
---
Upvoted.

The premades are arrogant as all hell, but they're not doing anything special or difficult. This isn't exactly rocket surgery strategy here.

It's just banter btw, I think its dope y'all run with a retadin.

Execute is meant to be obscenely high numbers, that doesn’t mean much.

It’s been a boring unenjoyable grind
---
I dont understand why either side needs convincing or to defend their point.
---
Like grinding BRD for weeks for ironfoe? Do it up (shout out to liteninghoof, king of ironforge, veteran of 60 seasons). Like fishing in the middle of a dungeon? Your party sure doesnt but you do you!  Auction house boss? Fuck yeah, ya rich bastard!
---
BiS is the fun for some. But ffs if I hear one more lv 24 talk about a dungeon blue as BiS for 22-27 resto imma snap

Staysafe keeps bashing this subreddit when it doesn't go his way.
---
He's trying to portray himself as a god in-game. It's easy to do when you have a guild full of sheep following you.
---
Having negative posts here hurts his ego so much =/
---
But let's be honest, I would be mad too if the only thing I had in my life was this 15 years old game.
---
Play games to have fun? What are you, some kind of casual scrub? You'd better reach AV exalted rep so that I have your numbers for the corporate meeting on Monday...I mean, our next MC speed run.
---
As a gnome warrior on a pvp server I can only say: YES, we are the worst race, despised even by other races in our own faction. We are truly despicable and  will gank everyone, given the chance. If you see a gnome, just kill him first because I can assure you, he is up to no good!
---
That's a great analogy! Yeah I'm on one of the most active servers on EU so I could imagine getting higher PvP ranks is very difficult.  Wasn't planning on trying but would like to have something better than "Scout" infront of my name.
---
I'm having trouble with my Addons since the patch. I downloaded a few new ones and updated everything on Tuesday, but none of the new ones are showing and the updated ones are still out of date. I'm using Twitch to manage them. Has anyone else run into issues like this and know how to fix them?
---
But to actually progress in the shitty honor system, you actually have to treat it as a job (2 really)
---
HURR DURR NOCHANGES

No problem! I also added 2 new graphs that pull out the win data vs the loss data for RPM. More clear.

Download and install the Twitch Desktop App, go to the Mods tab &gt; Wow classic &gt; Update all Mods.

I did this a few days ago. Twitch found WoW and all my mods automatically. Was able to update while keeping all the settings.

You Mean 4 spells right? 😃
---
The comment I made is in response to the idea that people watch WoW streamers for the same reason they watch sports. My response is they don't because WoW is not even close to an esport.
---
I know people watch esports - they are not the same as regular sports, but WoW is neither of these things.
---
Just as easy to turtle gulch if you have the right comp. Had a premade not want to get 3-0’d in 8 mins last night sit roof with 10 for 40 mins.
---
TBC without flying would be perfect.  The vast majority of classes and specs actually functioned and were viable.  For as good as Classic is the fact that you can't pull decent numbers on every class is infuriating.
---
shady SEO optimization, if you watch any wow video on youtube he suddently bwcomes half of your recommendation feed
---
Thanks pal. It isn't, I came up with it.
---
I used to have improved mana burn but I found Blessed Recovery + Silence to be more helpful especially against rogues (they love priests).

Nah on retail I got mass reported when I capped snowfall graveyard too. People have the same mentality there.
---
This is why I identify them as hunters beforehand......and even if they do need healing they are ignored. STOP PLAYING WITH MY EMOTIONS
---
Petopia classic is a phenomenal resource!
---
&gt; The original comment I replied to connected watching wow streams with sports.
---
No, they were saying people who watch sports also watch streams/other people play.
---
You said that sport and e-sports 'are not the same' but your reasoning for that is because you said sports have elites while implying e-sports doesn't?
---
&gt; I'm not a professional esports gamer, but I'm also not streaming my daily play of world of warcraft expecting people to treat me like I am.
---
Entertainment video game streamers are not treated like professional e-sports gamers.
---
&gt; That begs the question, why would anybody watch many of the WoW streams out there.
---
Why watch any talk show, mukbag, or any other form of entertainment?
---
I can see your point 100% but in terms of rep grinding, if you’re gonna still run BGs after, what’s the rush Ya know?
---
I think it's level 200 so  with the +75 lure and +25 nat pagle rod you can do it at 100, I'm not 100% sure. I was doing it at like level 130.
---
It is not available, nor are the WSG wrists.  They are being released with BWL.
---
You are worthy of rising to the rank of subbing r/wholesomeclassicwow

---
DME jump runs I get 1 crystal every 100 thorium hits. I swear they stealth nerfed it
---
All your healing shamans are in AV getting exalted. Give it a couple weeks and we'll all be over in WSG having your back. Gotta get the AV rep stuff for raids first, broham.
---
I disagree with your post and I’m going to do my best to explain why. 
---
In every video game, (or non video game for that matter) of any kind or type, there are going to be exploits. When you’re playing a game, your activity takes place completely inside of the rules and framework the designers of the game have created. 
---
There is literally ZERO obligation for the players of any game to not explore every possible scenario that may benefit them within the rule set and framework of the game they’re playing. Whether it’s a board game, a card game, or a video game. 
---
When you’re playing a board game or card game with friends, if someone finds an exploit that ruins the spirit or fun of the game for others what happens?
---
You just condemn the person? Yell at them? Berate then how they’re ruining the game? SURE YOU COULD do that, but obviously that means the game is over, because either you or they, will get up and stop playing. 
---
There is a better alternative though, and it’s something most people would do. You make new rules. You outlaw the exploit. Everyone agrees, and (this is key) you ENFORCE those rules. You can not play ANY game when the rules are not being enforced. There is no exception to this. 
---
Now with video games, the players don’t create the rules. We don’t create the bugs, exploits, and we certainly aren’t in charge of enforcing the rules. That is the job of Dev/Mod teams. No different that referees at professional sporting events. We don’t expect the players to enforce the rules on themselves. We penalize, flag, and adjudicate when players break the rules.
---
If you were watching a basketball game and the refs just stopped calling fouls, when the fouling gets out of hand over the course of a game would you say it’s the “players fault”? Of course you wouldn’t, because we understand the nature of games, competition, and the NEED for over-site. 
---
This brings me to the point I really want to make that underlies your post, those who agree with you, and the other posts of this kind. 
---
You would rather condemn players than the billion dollar company that refuses to moderate this game in any way it and it’s players deserve. 
---
I don’t think people truly understand that wow has generated billions of dollars. I don’t think people understand how much Classic is making Blizz a month, and MOST importantly, how little they have spent on this relaunch of a 15 year old game. 
---
The AFK issues, the wide spread use of exploits, the obscenely slow response to reports, the lack of bans to those who are taking advantage of them, can all be fixed by money. They never wanted this game to happen, and they aren’t going to spend the necessary funds on people and support to ensure its not an exploit heavy fuck fest. They are the designers, they make it what it is, every day, the players just play. They can make literally any changes they want, it’s simply a matter of money (time=money) and Blizz ain’t gonna spend a dime more than the absolute minimum on this old game they didn’t want to re-release and it’s REALLY showing.
---
Slam the desk and fart 😂😂
---
I bet you could pop a rogue distract and turn their whole raid around and they wouldnt notice
---
I was actually given 2 Runecloth bags and a Mageweave bag the other day.  I love the guys on my server.
---
Yeah, the honor / ranking system is so inherently flawed it's absurd.
---
Everyone’s favorite xpac is the one where they had a bunch of guildy friends they played with.
---
The social aspect seems to be the only really important part of an MMO.
---
Compare PvE wow’s “slap the 1 key” game play to any actual video game you enjoy, and you’ll see it’s not the game that makes wow good.
---
I demand he s banned on this sub.
---
Sorry, as much as the players that exclusively min-maxing AV are cancer.  Blizz fucked up as this would've been the only situation to invite min-max players outside of WSG scouts ---&gt; which would've been really hard to do compared to server exclusive BGs vs cross-realm BGs.   
---
Developers of Classic WoW have shown to make some good decisions. But they've shown they also make bad decisions. Stubbornly sticking to 1.12 in all aspects because it... apparently is the best representation of the game to them, was not a good decision. This version of AV is just as bad or worse than retail, and previous versions of AV would not have allowed this cheese strategy. People would've had to actually interact with each other like it was intended. We literally have had the same shitty version of AV for almost 15 years now. If we would've gotten the real version of AV, people would've hopped over to WSG and actually had to participate in actual even PLAYER VS PLAYER aspects of the game.   
---
Fuck the sweaty no-lifer world PvP griefers that min-maxed on already overpopulated servers, they should've coupled BGs with the honor system release. Fuck the afk, braindead min-maxers in AV currently, they should've released the original AV as it was originally intended to be played by Vanilla.  But mostly, fuck Blizzard for propagating these opportunities ---&gt; Some foresight could've simply prevented them.
---
With the new dual wield rotation hit is a lot less valuable.
---
Thank you, main reason I posted this lol. I get a good kick out of old comments that said classic will fail and it always irked me at the time. Thought some others would enjoy it as well
---
It is, yea. I just like the Tauren and their homeland a lot.
---
What I wouldn’t give for a proper AV.
---
And that is why loot council is the best system.
---
Agreed, most of the games I did last night went similarly.
---
What you're saying is logically inconsistent. An argument is not made true simply by believing it to be - its truthiness is also not negated by not believing it.
---
What you're saying only stands if and only if there exists no condition where the belief can hold true. Obviously that isn't the case.
---
My belief that it is the case is not what makes it true, but it is true that there exists people that do think in this manner. Of course it may not be all people or even most of them, but the statement is still sound and valid.
---
in pvp ? always been ?
---
In pve ? All your dps could be elemental shaman and you would clean the raid anyway, so yes
---
I feels ya
---
&gt;What do you think the pvp tournaments are? Or racing to world first boss kills?
---
Opportunities for insecure people to exchange time and effort for temporary validation with diminishing returns?
---
I notice that your wins take significantly longer AND give a lower rep/min than many of the losses. Not always true and this is a small sample size, but interesting nonetheless.
---
I assume true PvP enthusiasts mostly want arenas or AB
---
Except they do any anyone who's tried to idle and keep their character online for 30 minutes would know this because if you don't perform enough actions in a set amount of time the game disconnects you without warning. Happens every time.
---
&gt; If one gives 10% more honor but is way less enjoyable, most people will play the fun one. If the less fun one gives 300% more honor, people are compelled to play it. High Warlord players may decide that 10% is critical, but for most, it just needs to be close.
---
That is not how the system works. If you're serious about ranking up you go where the honor is greatest - fun has nothing to do with it. If you wanted to have fun, you wouldnt be ranking up to r13-14 in the first place.
---
That’s how me and my friends do it. The newest servers are at the bottom, so someone joins first available the rest of us scroll down and join the number they tell us on discord. Works about 80% of the time. Just don’t join battle until everyone gets the option to join.
---
People will always raid all tiers regardless of the current tier, so eventually you'll get some purple, but I doubt you'll really get anything that's Best in Slot from the current tiers.
---
Getting fully decked out in gear takes a long time in vanilla and you can get absolutely screwed by drop RNG. Because of this it'll always go to the dedicated players first.
---
thats a necklace
---
This may be the case with a lot of WoW players because of the content you’re playing/watching, but when you’re talking about the top competitive players in any video game, the competition gap is no different than that of you and an NFL player. I promise 99% of society can’t even comprehend how fast these players think, much less pull off what they do.
---
No. Right now you can pug both raids (MC+ony) on any evening that fits you.
---
No, no one knows except Blizzard, and they haven't said anything about it.
---
Feelsbadman
---
idgaf about that. I'll take practically anyone at 60, make fun of them for being shitters in discord, but still tank the damn thing.
---
What’s funny? Besides you being a fuckin nerd ass forum mid?
---
Of course people in OG AV didn't do anything selfish. Mining thorium and fishing in AV totally helped the team and wasn't at all just as bad as straight afk. And it's not like people didn't leech then either.
---
As time goes on, you slowly realize start to realize that a majority of streamers are very bad representatives of the game. You have provided one example. People can provide examples from asmongold. Plenty of people exploit game mechanics to get ahead (whether this was through layering or other means). Countless streamers use spy addon when they themselves say its bad for the game.... The list goes on and on... Honestly the only big streamers I remotely watch are Esfand and Swifty.
---
No problem at all! Good luck man, and thanks for the silver!
---
I believe there are honor sets that are pretty good that don't require high ranks, I'm not sure if there is much else. In classic once you get the BiS you are done with that slot since there isnt random rolling to increase its stats.
---
I’m just sitting at work, thinkin...
---
Does anyone play a smite/Power infusion priest build that’s viable in PvP and Pve? I’m not a rich guy so I don’t have the ability to respec back and forth every week for raids and BGs. I’m currently playing Holy.
---
I only ever played DPS classes in Vanilla, and since I’ve been doing BGs I’m kinda feeling like holy is handicapping me. I’m great when I have people who realize I’m keeping them up, but most of the time I just get zerged without peels.
---
Thoughts?
---
Oh ofc! I know what u mean. 
---
I think personally, Im gonna rush AV rep for now and when i got my Don Julio imma chill.
---
The revered mace and mirah's song is probably the way to go if you don't want to compete for in demand items like dal rends. It almost beats lobotomizer + distracting, especially as you get better gear and if you have world buffs.
---
I feel as though this is more of a gripe with this subreddit than the actual game. BGs are flooded with dumb chat messages because nobody cares who they fuck over on another server. Otherwise in game I’d say things are just fine (especially since IF is safe to roam again)
---
Its gotten worse in that last 5 years.
---
People have used their brains for over 10 years to discover that the AV rush is the best strategy.
---
It sounds like your guild is dying. If you want to continue playing your character in the future, I'd recommend not ghosting them. Offer to tank one or two more weeks while they search for a warrior main tank. 
---
If none of your "officers" can find a warrior tank in that time period the guild isn't worth saving imo. Plenty of warriors are forced into dps'ing and would rather have main tank prio on loot (stuff like thunderfury and other incredible items usually go to main tank and then offtanks first).
---
Assuming you're a druid tank, this is when you're at your prime. Future raids won't go well with a druid main tank and you're better off gathering healing gear as a healer if you want to continue raiding throughout classic.
---
Fuck yeah!
---
You misunderstand me. As a warrior I am not worried that the hunter has pulled aggro on one mob by multishotting on pull. I’m worried about the healer getting punched if you feign death since the mob is no longer in my melee range and the healer is close behind me in aggro so early in the pull.
---
Ehh it kinda depends on how much hit you have, and they’re VERY close in EAP (counting hit as ~20 eap and Crit as ~25) and QSR fury war prio, while rogues get prio on BOA after MT
---
I love that you talk down to him about his selfishness, while calling it the worst version of AV that exists like that's not just your opinion. He just said that he likes it lol
---
There were people who were 60 the first week the game was out, too. 
---
Don't try to match those people. Nothing good comes of it.
---
Lmao its horde complaining about AV. Sub needs more shadowbans to avoid these shitpost spam.
---
Might be decent mate with weapon skill improvement. Revered comes super fast. 600 ish rep an AV? 3k+6k+12k = 21k so approx 45 AV'S? Not long for a good mh
---
Druids aren't faceroll but they're not this impossible class to play
---
You should look up the requirements to unlock Vulpera and get what you can finished.
---
I use qualifiers because I'm generalizing a large group of people.
---
Someone that paints a large group of people confidently is an idiot. It is also received much worse by a large group of people unless their biases are also aligned with the person's biases.
---
A lack of confidence is not something I struggle with.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEE WHY ARENT PEOPLE PLAYING THE GAME THE WAY I WANT
---
I’m on Fairbanks and I haven’t noticed any below 50g in a while. They are often around 60. If it wasn’t such a crapshoot to farm them, I’d do it just for the gold as an alternative to lasher/Mara runs.
---
"I'm oom but they are all dead except the shaman, gogogo."
---
No you are missing the point again.  Read it.  He is essentially saying some one is buying into a system of playing they game that they do not enjoy.  Then they complain about not enjoying the game, because they feel if they go against the system they are punished.  And there are people that are punishing others for going against the optimal strategies for playing the game, such as being reported for being afk when you want to get the Stormpike or Frostwolf insignia for your first game of AV, because you couldn't log into wow during the work day, week nights, until getting vacation days or whenever.
---
I haven't touched retail in more than a decade and I have no desire to.  I quit early in wrath when it became clear that Activision was catering the game to be appealing to casuals by streamlining the leveling and raiding, and prioritizing class balancing around around PvP in a misguided attempt to turn WoW into an esport which led to class homogenization.  I was disgusted by what I saw, sold my account, and didnt touch the game again for years until I found out about private servers.  The current state of retail is so alien that it doesnt appeal to me at all.
---
You missed my last and probably most important point. We like to have fun. It isn’t fun rushing to van in a straight PVE zerg.   I think you are salty because people aren’t playing the way you want them to and they aren’t min maxing.
---
Ninja looting as well, what is your point ?
---
Imagine that accompanied  with shamans!
---
&gt; A minute faster per 6min BG which you do for 18hours a day accumulates quickly into steep honor losses.
---
For reference, if you play for 18 hours and do 6 minute AVs you would do 180 AVs but if you did 7 minutes you'd do 154~155
---
I'll ask again - there are organized competitions being broadcast by Blizzard or professional media for World of Warcraft?
---
Overwatch - sure
---
LoL - sure
---
Fortnite - yeesh, ok I guess :)
---
WoW is an RPG, not a tournament engine. The streaming content is not tied to any official tournament or product and is primarily focused on "look at me" fixtures like Asmongold.
---
The exalted cloth items aren't bis by *any* stretch, but depending on what gear you currently have they are certainly cheap enough to consider grabbing if they are upgrades
---
You right!!!
---
Welcome to vanilla.
---
It's leeching, sure, but it's not AFK.
---
If you're on an 80/20 server, AV is the best place to level outside of dungeons.
---
[He's one of the 10,000](https://xkcd.com/1053/)
---
Choose to celebrate the chance to teach someone something new. Don't mock people for not knowing something.
---
So far today I've had a lot of success in games where 10-15 people defend and try to wipe alliance on Drek.
---
If you wipe them they almost always go on to lose.
---
I'm hoping the meta is shifting to some actual strategy to win. It does seem like more people are catching on to it.
---
I had a premade AV group shit talking me since I had BRE with crusader enchant and valor chest piece. I didn’t bother responding because I knew where it would lead. Better to not respond and feed them.
---
You don't have to lol.
---
Glad I’m not on a server where that shit happens.
---
Right now im in &lt;Dark Hunters&gt; and my rank is 'Dark Hunter' so my characrer sheet says Dark Hunter of Dark Hunters
---
It’s not about the skill level of whoever’s playing it, it’s the mechanics of the class itself. We’re meant to be healers in classic and all our end game gear is with that in mind. Even if you take warrior dps gear, you’ll suffer from lack of int and spell power. You just won’t have the mana to do a lot of damage in a long fight with a set rotation and your holy damage will be weak. If you love the ret spec, you can destroy people in pvp (recommend specing into a ret/reckoning build), but you have to know most raids would rather get the utility from a holy paladin and maximize dps elsewhere. I’m rocking a holy reckoning build that allows me to heal in raids for the tier set gear and still do damage/support heal in pvp effectively. Once I get all my gear from raiding/pvp, I’ll be going back to ret/reckoning myself.
---
What phase are we in now? 2 or 3?
---
Oh I did. Already did the quest line for voldun and exalted, just need the patch
---
The problem isn't min maxing, it's the attitude players have now.
---
They refuse to have fun anymore. You join dungeon groups and people are silent, you join guilds and people are silent. The whole point of an MMO is that you play with other people, and that's where a lot of the fun comes from.
---
You may not need anything from say.. BRD for instance, but a friend does. So you go with them anyways to keep them company and for the good times that can be had.
---
People have largely forgotten this and are getting burnt out on the game because they're trying to do nothing but play/beat the game instead of experiencing everything else along the way. It's great that you got all your Pre raid BIS after 4 days of grinding.. but did you do anything else in that time? It's great that you're max DPS, but did you ever once think another build might be more entertaining? We don't need to min-max in this game anymore, we know these bosses, we don't need to have perfect builds with 20 consumables and buffs to make sure the raid goes as easy as possible.. people are downing onyxia with 10 people ffs. Get that stick out of your ass and enjoy the WHOLE game. Not just bumrush dungeons.
---
If i had to clear 5 extra packs every time I've cleared scholo it would add up to hours.
---
So no.
---
Level up to at least 58, preferably 59. Then I'll take you with whatever garbage gear you have. I've done probably 50 scholo runs and taken a bunch of shitters.
---
True.  I guess to me it feels like a half hour to an hour should be normal for any BG.  Anything less is just feels like a disappointing waste of time to me (especially when the queue for the BG is longer than the BG itself)
---
This is precisely what I was expecting honestly... I make my own fun in BGs and seek out PvP anywhere and everywhere I can. Would I prefer the average length of an AV to be longer? [Sure.](https://Sure.Do) Do I care that much about the zerg meta? Not really. I just go out and PvP and play how I feel like it. I personally enjoy it.
---
All the top-voted comments are pretty accurate, aside from underestimating the number of people who only play Classic.
---
Xxxxxxxxtreme
---
I doubt blizzard will do shit
---
Keep it up, man. It's never too late to turn life around, and as long as you keep at it, things will change. People usually only despair because it feels like the despair will last forever.
---
I'm proud of you :)
---
&gt;your game is poorly designed
---
Welcome to vanilla
---
Bruh, I need an AV bot.
---
Personally, I am going with the crossbow since it would replace Gorewood and I am already hit capped easily.
---
Probably in phase 4.  BG weekends were originally released alongside ZG in retail vanilla.
---
PUGs happen if your server is big. If it's small, just join a one-night raiding guild.
---
MC as a whole takes around 2.5 hours if you're slow. That's shorter than a bad BRD run.
---
Most guilds don't require your 100% attendance. They'll mostly expect 70% or so.
---
It's a lot more relaxed than Retail.
---
To be fair I don’t think(and could be wrong) that most who enjoy actual pvp would say that AV is more enjoyable than WSG. I think what the op is talking about is that a perfect WSG is putting you far behind a shitty AV in honor gain and closing that gap would be nice. Having to choose between high rank and very little actual pvp(AV) or climbing the PVP ranks with actual PVP (WSG) seems obvious to me. Was to blizz as well but it just took a while in vanilla.
---
Careful unless this is sarcastic in which case you are probably ok.
---
I have apparently drawn a dangerous line in the sand and infuriated the sensitivities of many people who seek validation of their recreational habits.
---
I always take emblems for this reason as well! You slow mounters will learn to get outta av and farm gold. And if you wanna do AV you’ll learn sit in a GY
---
sort of?  i messed around with a 30/0/21 spec in MC, would get top 5ish dps on individual trash mob pulls but only the non resistant to nature pulls.  i'd be completely gassed after each pull though and would have to chug water while we pulled the next pull.  I didn't dps on bosses because technically i was a healer for raid purposes but the basic rule of thumb I've seen is that if you have mana, you'll be competitive but you'll oom pretty damn fast.
---
It’s not that hard at all one person picks first available and tells the others the number the rest scroll to the bottom of the list and select that number.
---
That's not the reality though. AV as alliance with a few decent people is 0 min queue + sub 10 minute game with around 2500 bonus honor + 400 honor for the token turn in. That's 3000 honor in 10 minutes.
---
Winning WSG gives like 400 bonus honor and 400 for tokens. So you somehow have to win a WSG and farm at least 2200 honor from kills reliably on under 10 minutes. I don't think that compares.
---
Dude, 80% of players in AV are mindless zergs, just get 5 people to follow you to take one tower, and they will follow you to a masive 30 minutes battlegrounds. Stop whining and do something about.
---
10 minute zergs were also part of vanilla.
---
You like it because it's easy to farm rep.  If the only thing you like about it is how little you'll have to do it then you don't really like it.
---
5 hr AV?!! With all these rushes going on?!! How???
---
As i said for the majority. As it stands, if u want to hit rank 8, play all AV, if u want to hit rank 10 play all AV. If they were close, for most ranks u could do whatever. For R 13-14, as i said you are probably correct.
---
Ah I gotchu
---
Pretty alive here. The guildies in my guild that dont get in our raid always do it by themselves later with a pug.
---
If your catching flak you know your over the target
---
Funny thing is, from what I hear retail AV is quite the opposite of rush meta
---
if the rest of the AV group wanted to they could force a turtle and prevent the Horde from winning. Better to AFK out than risk it.
---
I voted no changes and i would do it again, I also had zero intentions of fighting for rank 14.
---
I don’t know why you feel Blizzard could just tinker with bits and pieces as requested and not completely change the fundamentals of the game. If they had of reworked the honor system people would be pissed!
---
2/2 sample size, nice. Conversely I ran WSG for about 6 hours last night, not 1 premade.
---
Monster.
---
I'm 300 in skinning and leatherworking and I spent an entire day in Un'goro until I had enough Devilsaur leather to make 4 sets and sold them in trade.
---
This is the best.
---
Yeah, I guess judgement of wisdom doesn’t count as unique utility that’s good for mages. Btw, holy can’t keep the same amount of uptime due to the  mana expense and having to eat a global to reapply.
---
That’s one fat fuckin crystally boi
---
Alliance Kromcrush you say?  I hope I didn't have anything to do with the corruption of your girl :P
---
Elemontle
---
Test out that macro, it's a pretty huge increase cuz u get to slam every auto in between bloodthirsts
---
All the details come out.  As a tank I wouldn't have gone either.  I can find a dozen groups with all 60s that won't make me clear twice as much trash in the run.  I wouldn't call myself a min/maxer, but I am also not trying to waste what time I have to play risking a group with a 56 when I literally have 5 other options right there in LFG, and two of them are going to pay me.
---
Presumptuous for you to claim that your speaking for the majority of players 
---
I durn and Korgrel of mankrik oppose the zerg feast. Reminds of the BFA players who would rather forfeit a match if they don't immediately win because they only care about exp per hour
---
It says who does it to you. Make sure to report them for cheating and explain what they did.
---
Call it whatever you want, I could literally not care less how much money and production value they throw at it, to someone not invested in the sport  it's nothing but a strange and really boring ritual that serves the same function as a recruitment sheet paired with an announcement, the point is that you need to actually care before the point of it all becomes evident.
---
I really like this mind set and I'm going to try to get my guild to adopt it. We've talked about a point system as well and point hoarding is something that really worries me, not just with tanks. I can already see rogues passing on upgrades to try to have the most points when their weapons drop.
---
Any suggestions on how to bring this up? I like my guild but we're newer and learning. I don't want to be a dick, but at the same time I can already see we're wasting time not focusing on tanks. We might down rag eventually but no way will we move forward in harder stuff.
---
I said something similar in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e9cnap/when_did_people_stop_wanting_to_have_fun/faj2etn/).
---
It's hovering around -4 karma, including a reply that says "wrong on every count, congratulations". People are *so bitter* about radiant quests, and I don't get it.
---
This is literally the 15th or 16th thread about this in the past 24 hours. We get it.
---
Ya the new horde meta seems to be intercept and force a turtle thus hindering both the Honor and Rep per minute of BOTH the alliance and horde. Yes it sucks to lose every time as horde but it is far better then a turtle. Its also not like horde walk out with nothing, 95% of the time the alliance let horde get the bonus from balinda since they are busy rushing drek.
---
But for most people hitting rank 8 or whatever is not super important.  Until you get into the rank 11+ gear there are equally good pve options which take much less time to get.  
---
And that'll be even more true when ZG and AQ 20 come out which will likely be pugged just as readily as Ony/MC are.
---
I'm listening to you, and you aren't responding to my points. Your point is valid, there's plenty of people who are having a great time on PVP servers. But there's also plenty of people who aren't, due to server circumstances or other things. And what I'm saying, is that you are dismissing their criticism just because it doesn't fit how you've experienced the game, and you are unwilling to step into their shoes to try to see their criticism as valid. 
---
Does that make sense? I've never once said that you're wrong, your experience is valid and I bet there's a lot of people who have been loving their pvp server!
---
Peace out homie, can I have you gold?
---
&gt;If you have 1 hour a week to play, dont play any game with a persistent world. Go play games with rounds and resets, like CS GO or LoL or DotA.
---
&gt; Oh wait. Those punish being bad at the game even more.
---
&gt; Just dont play at all. Go play Minecraft.
---
Wait a sec... do I owe you any IRL $$? Because unless I hired you to tell me how to spend my time, why the fuck are you telling me how to spend my time?
---
The game is fun again
---
&gt; play a persistent world **RPG**
---
&gt; complain about minmaxing and time investment being advantageous
---
This sub is a laughing stock lmao
---
I think you're good to go with a bobber. I'm 300 and dont use a bobber and I dont think I've missed catching any fish
---
The issue though is you can still have efficient honor per hour while making the game last 30-45 minutes or at the very least not a PVE zergfest. But that would require changes.
---
Its a little tricky to get the timing down and imp slam gives u more leeway to use gcd but i always top dps on onyxia just slamming as arms spec (no need to respec for loot sack ony)
---
I'm just sitting here on my 29 hunter enjoying WSG until the honor grind wanes a bit. I plan to get rank 10 eventually on my main, but I'm not even going to bother trying to compete with all the no-lifers currently grinding honor/rep. Except for the most dedicated few they'll all give up this insane grind once they get max rep or run out of steam and head back to PvE.
---
Getting rank 10+ is a marathon and all these people are treating it like a sprint.
---
My nephews (20+), talked me back into playing being a busy “adult”.  Now I still grind at home when my family is asleep, and they’re off doing other stuff.  I feel your pain dude.
---
Caster offhands are phenomenal for AV though so I doubt casters aren't bothering with the farm
---
Druid has instantly gone to cat form.
---
ZG and AQ20 were made for players like you
---
The honeymoon period is over. People are realizing that part of what made classic "classic" is the time period. Most people didn't know how to minmax, find their best in slot, download all the latest addons and have the game basically tell you what to do.
---
the warlock mount cost me 800G in materials, so this one is still cheaper.
---
And all i got is demonshear
---
Do you need to be, or can you be, in a party with other priests?
---
Idk what your on about but if your suggesting you can go to bed with your character logged in and wake up to the character still logged in - no that doesn’t happen.
---
"I'm masturbating, they can't catch me"
---

---
Yeah I messed up.
---
I'll know better for next time  :)
---
They announced literally MONTHS AND MONTHS ago that AV would be nerfed into the ground, even on Classic Beta AVs lasted less than 10 minutes most games,
---
HOW IS THIS STILL SHOCKING TO PEOPLE WHEN THEY'VE DONE NOTHING BUT TALK ABOUT IT?!?! AHHH!!!
---
Jerk and jog
---
this happened to me in retail a few minutes ago. I was tabbed out waiting for the BG to start, looking at some loot drop locations, soon as I see the gate open  I tab back in click to move forward without seeing the fucking portal. looked like half the BG left. played myself. can you imagine if blizz left portals like they were originally intended? proximity teleport, no clicking required!
---
Is that you Stormed?
---
If I didn't read this sub, I'd have no idea what to expect from AV, pvp realms, or any of the other things people say that about.
---
I'm an Alliance player on a Horde dominated PvP server. World PvP in phase 2 was the most fun I've ever had in WoW and it brought my guild closer together. I wish it lasted longer.
---
Talked to the guys getting bracket 1 each week in my realm. They said they did 16 hour wow days every day since pvp came out and plan on doing 16 hour pvp until r14. R14 is literally eat-&gt;sleep-&gt;wow-&gt;repeat, because if you don't spend every waking moment someone else who does will get that bracket 1.
---
Damn you're an idiot
---
Just give the raid lead to someone else.
---
&gt; Some people have been through the game a dozen times and are finding enjoyment in optimizing it and beating it - a sort of personal New Game+. Others are enjoying it for the first time, getting lost in BRD or Stratholme for 12 hours or wearing int/spirit gear on their rogues. Both of these experiences are equally valid; but you can't shoehorn someone into your ideal "fun classic experience" if they aren't in your shoes, experience and personality wise.
---
There's a huge middle ground between these.
---
&gt; Fun in video games is subjective and comes from garnering reward in a novel way.
---
For you. I'm just here to level a couple characters - one of whom is the same class as my old main, and jump into BGs every now and then. I'm not looking to do anything particularly novel, just enjoy the elements of the game that made me like it so much then.
---
&gt; At the end of the day - if someone isn't having fun, they'll quit playing; so accusing anyone who's still playing classic of "not having fun" just because they aren't playing your version of "fun classic" is silly. The fact that some people become toxic about it is unfortunate, but if a toxic person is using SUBOPTIMAL AV FARM!!! as a vehicle for their toxicity, that's not the minmaxing demon mind controlling them - that's just a toxic player being toxic.
---
100% agree. But the biggest problem is that the people playing for two different goals are being forced together when they want to AV. They were forced together when they wanted to be in the world before BGs (but post honor system). Just saying "my way's valid, too" doesn't change how incompatible the two ways of playing are rn.
---
That just doesn’t sound right. If murder suddenly became not legal are you really going to say it’s the governments fault that individuals are going out and murdering others? The truth is a lot of people are shitty so when you add the anonymity of the internet in than it turns into a cess pool. This is 100% the fault of the player base and all the issues that pop up on this sub are the player bases’ fault. Saying it is the devs fault is like saying the devs are sitting next to you with their hands on your mouse and keyboard.
---
You know what's cool?  The other side of the pillow.
---
Hey thats my clip
---
I had exactly the same issue. I played at 60 for a while but without friends (irl friends) is just wasn’t as fun and I tried rerolling on another server where I had more friends playing but I didn’t have the heart to grind out another 60. If they would add in paid realm transfers especially to servers with huge imbalances like the one I’m trying to go to, I would come back.
---
I think it is pretty simplyl run fast. At that bracket especially nobody can touch travel form as nobody has mounts yet. Kitty sprint could help get out of room as well
---
I literally never get tired of the "I started blasting" memes no matter how many times they are recycled lol. Love it
---
It's my least favorite BG right behing AV.
---
DD is alliance heavy but its not too noticeable. WPvP was insane right up until ngs came out. It's not a ghost town now but it's waaay quieter in world now. Don't let the RP fool you, it's RP Lite. Mostly the people are cool as hell.
---
He isn't if he's using in-game methods of finding him. Having someone else watch a stream and tell you where he is in-game isn't stream sniping. It's morally wrong though, but it's kind of how it's not burglary to buy a TV you know is stolen.
---
You're
---
Look at the lack of wpvp right now. The flying killing wpvp narritive is a farse. Incentivicing honor farm through bgs, and later in tbc having arena to get the best pvp killed wpvp.
---
I'm a hunter and passed on a dal rend since we had a rogue in the group. The other hunter said fuck it and won the roll lol!
---
only way it could be better is if you played a hunter too
---
&gt;raw honor farming.
---
the 5th kill on the same person... wether it's solo or in a 40-man raid, yield no honor.
---
such a stalemate would give near-0 honor after the first 20 minute.
---
Toss in the constant abusing of the reporting /afk system that allows streamers and large guilds to dominate the honor brackets and the system is broken. Blizzard made the /afk reporting system far harder to abuse in vanilla because of this but in classic it can be abused by large groups of people still. If you have not heard about this issue yet its because every single time it gets posted here the mods instantly delete it despite none naming names and no attempts at witch hunting on the posts.
---
People have been getting booted like crazy for the past few days for everything from questing to not working with others on their servers honor cap system not just for being /afk.
---
People use to kick you from an MC run if you did not have full T0. The misconception that the dungeon set was good was very common.
---
Why is this a layered jojo meme?
---
So stop complaining how the majority play a fucking RPG
---
&gt;I barely recognize the social community aspect of this game from my days in retail vanilla.
---
And here i am on the european RP (PVE) server getting greeted and given free water by basically any mage i meet.
---
Then again i don't pvp and i don't raid. So that's probably why my experience concerning the community was actually surprisingly friendly and fun. :p
---
No snide remark here, just pointing this out.
---
There used to be an addon called Preform AV Enabler which did this for you. Not sure if it's still available but you can give it a shot.
---
dude fellow Kromcrush alliance here. The horde are turning us into an evil I don't think they are prepared for.
---
I don’t give a shit and most people don’t. Give me my rep and honor and move on to the next new content. As long as the wPvP mess has stopped I’m happy.
---
This was probably the best and most detailed guide to the BRD stealth runs I’ve seen. Thanks for taking the time to write all of this out for everyone. Really really nice of you.
---
I saw WAY more afkers in av back in vanilla than I have in classic
---
You don’t have give everyone a port role players
---
Certainly not in digital life, in a game.
---
Blizzards internal systems track pretty much everything. I'd bet the system knows who reported you. Please people swamp the ticket system in tickets when this happens to you and get these people rightly punished for abusing games systems.
---
Fucking boomers tricked the kids into thinking AV was epic just like they tricked them into thinking taking out huge loans for college was a great idea.
---
Jack &amp; jog
---
Tysm for this
---
Having played off and on since beta, all those old funky quirks and bugs are more like old friends to me now. I am never going back to retail lol.
---
We organized a huge battle in Silithus right before battlegrounds came out. We marched together after a stunning victory over the Alliance
---
It's in this game now.
---
An AV last night summoned him too. We (Horde) had been stuck on fighting for the last graveyard at the Alliance base, so a few Horde base defenders left to summon Lokholar. I joined in, because why not help summon him, but no Alliance showed up, and Lokholar never does anything except run in a circle in the middle of the map. So we all gave up, to help retake the graveyard and win the 1 hr AV.
---
I feel similarly, except I lost interest when I saw folks saying they played 14 hours straight patch day and hit exalted.  I don't want to be paired up with those sweaty people.
---
You’re dead on about people will quit if they’re not having fun. IMO, that’s all that needs to be done if people genuinely want to see change, not all this reddit bitching. I loved phase 1, hated phase 2 and subsequently quit. Does that make me a casual for not wanting to minmax? No, just waiting for the current game state to change a bit :D
---
Then report your leader when he does it.
---
and hopefully they temp ban people who are abusing it
---
Sadly that was the magic of Vanilla, playing with friends. 15 years later most people can't devote that much time to an MMO.
---
As someone who went unemployed for 3 years, no thanks.
---
Discord for rogues https://discord.gg/H6Ufwf
---
It’s classic wow with 1.12 context, and we know what’s already in there. So we are able to acknowledge the best shortcuts you can take to get a certain result.
---
Like I play the rogue as my main now, and my final target is to get 5T1+5ZG(including necklace and trinkets). I’m a min/maxer and I make plans about the optimizations. But I don’t rush to get things done as I know if I’m playing classic for the next 5 years why do I rush in a hurry. I got the Tidal Charm when there were layers as it will be hard when there’s just 1 layer of the mob. I wait for ZG comes out so I’m play alts and other games while waiting. I don’t need R10 or R13 so no honor grinding for me.
---
I know a lot min/maxer are grinding wildly but they’re technically not optimizing anything. Like do a 100 runs for a BIS in this phase, yeah cool but you can find an easy replacement next phase so why so thirsty to get it. And a lot people grinding the honor for no reasons. Just because they believe honor is good and find the most efficient way to get it but they don’t realize if they really need the rank gear.
---
Pretty much. I turned trade chat off in 2005, i turn trade chat off in 2019.
---
I can not tell you how bad the shit in there has become though, since, well, i turn it off. :p
---
 Very well said. I think some issues arise because one party wants the other to play the game the way they are, and vice versa. I’m guilty of it too and try to stop myself. With the AV rep grind Zerg Zerg Zerg strat, I can’t get mad the the players who want to play AV as a battleground and not a PvE boss, but it’s frustrating when players want to do the complete opposite of what you want to do and I guess “force” you into playing the game in a way you don’t want to. Both sides are at fault when it comes to that and I don’t think it’ll be solved. I think people just need to understand it’s a multiplayer game and everyone is spending their free time on this game and want to play it the way they want to and that’s okay.
---
It’s really stupid to think that way though. “These people putting in way more time and effort than me are ruining the game.”
---
This is how you end up with the balancing and casual friendly systems in retail that classic players love to hate on so much.
---
Thing is, I don't think the community is all that bad, at least not for a gaming community. there have always been assholes, and there will always be assholes, but I've had a lot of really positive experiences with the wow classic community. I learned a long time ago that most people who only care about BiS are not fun to play with, and the one upside to massive server pops is that there are plenty of more reasonable people to play with.
---
I understand that and I think part of the fun is in playing with people who are trying about as hard as you are.
---
All that shit you mention is basically the distilled essence of vanilla wow.  It was the wild west and the wild west is dangerous and cruel.  That's what makes it so fun.  
---
If you think this isn't how vanilla was you probably never played vanilla.
---
Why is AV harder for Horde?
---
Still waiting on Savage Gladiator Chain, 70 runs in...
---
I'm aware of the sample size but the queue time was about 15 minutes. I prefer WSG too but the part of no premades just isn't true for everyone. Are you alliance or horde? I suspect alliance have shorter queues.
---
There's a bot user on my realm who's farming the undead mobs at the winterspring lake 24/7 for weeks already. Saw him when I've been here on my priest, now seeing him again on my hunter after like 2 months. Reported him again, but Blizzard won't care anyway.
---
Looks like he had an update though: he starts to mount up occassionaly and spergs around, making him look like Marc Zuckerberg trying to act human.
---
I got him killed a couple of times luring mobs into him and feign death, but its pointless.
---
Who cares if he gets banned now, the damage is already there.
---
Tbf you don’t have to be good to kill undergeared/low level players so you’re just saying your bad which seems about right
---
So fucking stupid. I like it.
---
Imagine if everyone in your raid did that, warriors come as arms, priests as shadow, druids as moonkins, paladins ret, rogues cold blood/prep, etc. 
---
People who run shit specs, and do not do the work, rely on others to carry them through content and to give them free epics for it.
---
Okay...the why go on to try to defend a fundamental difference about an average person playing with Rodgers vs and a average person playing with Faker?
---
You didn't finish reading their comment before reacting. They clearing say (This goes both ways.)
---
Why even keep him around then? Sounds like a toxic ass.
---
Same problem, except the only person I know and still plays is horde... on a pvp realm.. and I am in a pve... and alliance...
---
Inviting a 56 rogue, no matter how geared, to a 58+ dungeon means you've got basically dead weight that will slow everything down - his stealth is useless, he can't hit any of the bosses, and he's going to die much faster. Most of his CC will be resisted too.
---
I would take a 60 in all greens over a 56 rogue in preraid bis anyday of the week, and what's even funnier about your situation is that a 56 rogue in mostly preraid bis is likely a hardcore minimaxer to have all those farms done already, while the average fresh 60 would be a much more casual player.
---
At this stage in the game, the dungeons are still rough even in good gear. There's still a real chance of wiping in scholo or strat even in a good group of 60s because of how punishing they are. Especially strat for your rogue, because he couldnt even damage the physical immune mobs even if he was 60.
---
Level is a HUGE deal when it comes to running dungeons - every level the mobs have on you takes a huge chunk of your dps and survivability away. Glancing blows, crushing blows, misses , dodges, parties, and resists make taking a 56 into a 58+ dungeon a bad move, especially since DPS are so plentiful.
---
I mean if people were good at the game they'd be playing it instead of on here crying.
---
Oh Jesus, you can do that? Lol
---
Didn't you know? Unless you're as good or better then r/aristTV you shouldn't play, otherwise the REAL gamers will laugh at you in their "serious forum or discord", like any of us give a shit.
---
Can confirm in AV
---
I mean fair enough. But to me you sound like one of the Mean Girls mocking someone in high school. Not a friend casually joking around.
---
I don't have any use for your post, because none of these issues plague me. 
---
However, I really enjoy posts like this, it's why internet fora are worthwhile. You're a very considerate and inquisitive person, thank you for sharing your perspective and experience!
---
If youre getting downvoted, do you really represent the majority?
---
don't forget that reddit also wasn't really a thing during vanilla.
---
So true, been having an absolute blast in WSG so far.
---
Hopefully this AV zerg doesn't last forever as the nooby hour long AVs were actually my favorite BGs.
---
They would assign a number to each. AV 13, AV 17, etc. Also, people in major cities would talk about how long certain AVs had been going. Then once you zoned into the AV you could see the stats.
---
i have not had that experience at all
---
This was my first post on the subject buddy
---
As a druid tank main, I enjoy the class versatility keeps things interesting. If you choose to go the HOTW/NS Route you can efficiently tank and heal instances and even raids too. You do lose slme threat but almost all the mitigation is there. Also 2nd best healing spec IMO or at least mana efficient wise. If you don't like the idea of healing then full feral tank spec gets you 90% of what you need for cat form dps and 100% what you want for tanking. 
---
Druid tanks shine in terms of the #1 Threat generators. They don't get a lot of initial aggro but give me a few maul hits and it won't be easy to pull it off me. Having the option to do starfire+moonfire or hurricane pulls is good for threat st a distance or on casters. An option warriors don't have. Druids also (in same gear level) as a warrior will have more health and armor. The main downside is no parry/block so except for cettain fights you will take more damage for the most part. On the other hand almost All of druid BIS tanking gear is in instances so you don't even need to enter raids to get 90% of your BIS gear. I have 2 items from raids that arnt that big of an upgrade and I have over 11k armor soft and 6000hp. Will take a lot of instance grinding and getting multiple piece switches tho as you want to have gear options for situations. I keep healing + dps + various tank gear on me at all times which does take about 30 inv spaces. If you don't want to heal that's about 16 pieces less tho
---
I ran CS 1.6 on 640x480 resolution until the day the game died!  Low res for FPS is the way to go!
---
That's the point of a streamer though. You watch them for the personality and what they bring to the mix than the gameplay itself.
---
Just look at the likes of the Games Done Quick marathons or how huge posts on the likes of generic gaming subreddits are and the attached clips of streamers breaking world records in old games that, relatively, few people play.
---
Usually the meta is what the majority of the community is doing or prefers. If the meta is to rush to Drek then that is what people prefer to do. 
---
If people want honor then go play warsong. Clearly people are only doing AV for the rep. Split off from the rest of the group and go do PvP if you want so bad, but good luck with that shit. 
---
So who’s in the minority now?...
---
Healers running OOM could just be a DPS problem. I'd check your fight duration compared to other guilds and how the members of each class are doing comparatively. You're obviously not looking for top parses, but you shouldn't be doing grey parses either.
---
r/shitpost
---
Yet another reason 1.12 AV needs to get nerfed. You may not like what it took before then, but at least they couldnt AFK their way to 14
---
I want AV rep like everyone else but I can only do so many boss zergs in a row without wanting to blow my brains out
---
(Some) people on Herod have a very hard time understanding that reserving is perfectly legal and that they don’t have to join a group that has loot rules they don’t agree with.
---
Pugs especially.
---
pffft. Mark of the wild and innvervate the good healers.
---
I don't think you are the unspoken majority. I think the majority of Classic does not want the quick and easy gameplay of the current AV. I think the design philosophy that makes AV the way it is now is the same or similar to the design that makes Classic players dislike retail.
---
"I play this game for fun" = "I suck at the game, won't put in any work to learn my class, get gear, or contribute to the team, but gief epix plx"
---
It is, but it’s still something Warriors have that Shaman’s don’t.
---
looks like it - a horde that wanted to look human and have a weird looking cat
---
Guild raiding has been particularly rewarding this week. Why? We switched from MC to AV.
---
Woah I relate! My GF is leveling her main through STV as we speak as Alliance on Kromcrush... She turns to me and calmly says something along the lines of “I am the most angry I have ever been in my life.” Kromcrush horde are actually making some real psycopaths lmao
---
Errr, What? Onyxia?
---
When did i swore to destroy something and what is it? You may wanna elobarate on that very broad statement.
---
We can just cleanse it with poison cleansing.
---
they don't have kids, they just moved on to other games like RDR2 after putting 150+ hrs into Classic they got bored, thats it :/
---
I don’t understand your point. Lot of people play both classic and retail. Retail will get a nice boost when 8.3 launches and classic will get boost again when bwl launches.
---
Well at least you don’t have to deal with being endlessly camped going into BRM
---
It's a small mistake that won't have lasting consequences that teaches you more than it hurts you!
---
I would have definitely still reported them, I always report the people who do stuff like “you were reported afk please type /afk”   This is griefing and deserves action
---
But I don't want it to be over.
---
I have a non+ healing oh and lei would be swell.
---
I don't need to get lei this week. I'll get it. Eventually.
---
But Id rather summon the forest lord and send out npcs than run straight to drek.
---
I think with the state of AV - IE the PvE conditions, 30-60 minutes would probably be common if the BG didn't start out with a zerg. Shit, I was in a 45 minute AV last night that got there because the ally wiped on Drek before getting Frostwolf gy. It's not the same kind of epic as OG AV, but it's still fun and actually feels like PvP/BGs.
---
rich whitegirl gets paid to cry about climate change
---
more news at 11
---
I seem to recall them going red and stats not counting previously.
---
It's toxic ally kicking PVPers from AV more like.
---
I feel personally attacked
---
Ewww 45 minutes? Yeah you guys are doing it wrong. AV shouldn’t take more than 10 mins. If it does then you might as well go AFK
---
elemental shamans aren't really meant to be main healers in bgs. Your offensive power and burst is so great that you can tear teams apart with the proper support. You're an offhealer at best.
---
Like not at all because Blizzard and all instant cast spells dont scale well at all with spellpower.
---
However (I leveled an alt only to 36, maybe its different later), but int is kinda useless too. You always have enough mana for your pulls and you always have to drink after so a larger pool is fairly whatever too. Honestly I would use spellpower gear if you do any quests at all because it helps so much. I would prioritize int &gt; spellpower only if like 95%+ of exp you get is from aoe farming mobs.
---
Nice, that's a good one. 
---
"Literally everyone in the raid got epic loot this week, it was sweet."
---
Raids and dungeons are engaging? o.O
---
We're short a few people to fill our 40-man roster, but once we're full, he'll certainly be one of the firsts to go...
---
Professional gamers suffer from the same performance peaks and declines that professional athletes do.  Experience and practice can only make up for so much due to your reaction times getting slower as you age.
---
Yeah from turn ins. In my longest game the alliance decided to turtle at the graveyard across from the bridge. The back and forth lasted for about 10 minutes and once we finally broke through I ported back to base with over 500 armor pieces. I'm pretty sure I single handedly summoned the blood dude (I must've had around 90 blood?). I also triggered the flight leader and the cavalry leader's events with the beacons. All told I think I got around 1000 rep for 30 minutes in AV.

Thanks Ivan.  In other news, Poor whiteboy creates new reality for himself because this one upsets him.  Now here’s Tom with the traffic update.
---
I spell that on purpose every time and every single time someone takes the bait.
---
What happened?
---
My 2 cents about AV. its boring as hell, its not worst BG blizzard have made but close to it. Im kinda happy that its fast to farm rep so it over faster. And after that I can PVP in WSG, and then later play on best BG blizz have made AB.
---
Freedom of speech is freedom of speech.
---
av honor is better than wsg honor.. Wsg will only be spammed in wsg weekend by people going r14 sadly..
---
It's not an exploit? It's just one way to clear the content. That's like saying guilds burning Rag before first submerge is an exploit. It's just one way to clear the content (that happens to be fast and efficient).
---
Fact is, a lot of us have significantly less gaming time than we used to and we enjoy being able to complete the content without dragging it out unnecessarily. No matter what version of AV, some people are going to get to exalted for the rewards. And of those people, lots would greatly prefer that grind to take days instead of weeks.
---
"Unspoken majority" God your head is so far up your own ass
---
Click to help summon!!
---
you have got some mental issues
---
They're not talking about AFKers, they're talking about 'premades' reporting players not in their 'premade' as AFK to boot them and replace with players from their 'premade'.
---
Premade in quotes because its not really a premade, but players from the same guild/realm that queue together.
---
Try to find guilds that want to raid, but are too small still to field a whole MC group.  That way you can get a couple groups with 10-15 people who are already familiar with each other, and round out the group with true PUGs.
---
That seems like the most successful strategy for PUG raids on our server.
---
I want an Enhancement Shaman running with me, nothing more satisfying than vaporising people after strom strike, healing my friend ... And when WF procs... No need to cast because target is already in the next dimension
---
It’s a Star Wars reference. 
---
The youngsters call it a joke, I think &lt;3
---
AV is going to change in the next patch whether you like it or not. This is undoubtedly the worst version of AV, looking forward to the next update.
---
lol like sleeping I guess
---
Just about everything is better for Alliance.
---
Better Towers
---
Better Choke points
---
The Bridge
---
Better base layout to defend
---
etc...
---
The problem with classic is that actually clearing the dungeon is a small part of the time you need to invest. You need to find a group, get over there, wait for everyone to be there and then start clearing. 
---
And it's even worse when there are quests involved. Something like strat UD takes around 1 hour to clear from start to finish, but if you logon to the game in Ironforge, you should probably plan 1.5-2 hours until you're looting Baron Rivendare.
---
Yeah, but it does mean that no one can just avoid people that don't wanna play the way they do, hence all the frustration and tension.
---
yep, and there are games for you, literally almost any other game. stfu about this one pls
---
That's exactly why this is a problem. A few people playing together get into the same AV, then abuse the afk report button to get other people kicked out of the game while the rest of their party is queued for that specific AV instance.
---
It's unnecessary is all. Gear check, sure,fine. Consumable check? Overkill to the max. You can kill rag with a raid half full of non 60s
---
I crafted mine at 60. Waited for the pattern to drop in cost and picked it up for 25g (currently selling for 5g on my server).
---
I saved all the runecloth from BRD prison farming. Easily would get 3-4 stacks for a night (3-4 hours).
---
I farmed turtles off the coast of Hinterlands for Golden Pearls as they were selling for 45g a pop. Took about 6 hours of farming turtles to get 4 pearls which I thought was very lucky considering the drop rate. 
---
For the Righteous Orbs, I was able to barter with the tank to run Strat. I would get the first orb and he could have everything else. I ended up buying 2 orbs for 25g each.
---
Mooncloth... I farmed DM:E for the belt and would usually get a piece of Felcloth every other run from the demons. Fortunately, Felcloth is selling for 1.9g each on my server so I would just buy it if my CD was up and I didn’t have any. Ended up buying 2 CDs off randoms in trade chat and traded 4 Felcloths and 15g for the last 2 pieces because I got impatient.
---
No ragrets. They look really nice with the rest of T1 and will last long enough to justify the price / effort put in.
---
Leave the channels, ignore the conversation, or ignore the people who are always talking like that.
---
Are you all just reading the last comment in this chain? It started with me saying you can bypass the dinner by using afk scripts, them some guy gave anecdotal evidence how scripters are getting booted, so I replied how the script works, he says he's seen people get boot, I then tell him I've personally done it successfully, now you come in eager to be outraged that someone doesn't know the 30 min log out dinner even though that was never the topic to begin with, using afk scripts to bypass it was.
---
That's what I'm on about since you couldn't tell.
---
How far are you currently getting in MC, and what are your barriers? Is your progression stuck?
---
*A lot* of guilds have no clue how to function, it starts out as a handful of people who are friends, and decide "Hey let's make our own guild!" without really understanding what all that entails to do it well; and there aren't a ton of resources that go over all of that. It's really book-keepy and takes a lot of organization, accounting, and scheduling.
---
First, look at leadership and class leads. Talk to the raid leader, guild leader, assistant GM, class leads, and the DKP accountant. Try to talk to them 1 on 1, to get *that person's* opinions, and not the opinion of the majority that people are willing to go along with. Explain to them why the current system is not sustainable: tanks are dying too fast because they are undergeared and the healers are undergeared. You'll be able to clear more, and faster, with just a better geared tank. That's why every good guild puts gear on tank prio.
---
This is really hard to do as a tank, as you have to be extremely delicate in your wording so that it doesn't look like loot whoring. That's why I really recommend you talk to the leadership first and get their opinions, and make sure that they understand that tank prio is something that everyone else does for very good reasons. Then, find someone to be the spokesperson. Like I said, healers should be your friends here. Priest class lead should 100% be backing MT prio if they have any wherewithal at all.
---
Reinforce the idea that "better geared tank &gt; further and faster clears &gt; less money on repairs, and more gear overall". It is in everyone's best interest to have as good of a tank as possible. Note, this only works if the MT really knows their gear and itemization... You will need to do A LOT of research about BiS, threat gear, mitigation gear, different tanking specs, and know what all of the other tanks in the raid have for gear, their specs, etc. MT-ing is a ton of work.
---
That sounds like a nightmare. Not thanks. I like winning AV in only 5-6mins. 
---
If it goes past 10mins or I die more than 2 times I’m just going to stay in ghost form and run around or go AFK and watch a YouTube video
---
Gnomer, Uldaman, Maraudon, and BRD all take god damn forever when the entire party is at the minimum level. These are all dungeons designed around doing "half runs" which is why they have backdoor entrances that start in the middle (BRD has short cuts via locked doors). Because of this they have a crazy wide range of mob levels.
---
Imagine starting Uldaman with the entire group at level 41-42, struggling to get through the last half when all enemies are orange, then realizing no one does any damage to the last boss because he's red at level 47 and the healer constantly pulls aggro from the tank.
---
All you need is a like-minded guild on the opposite faction. Pick a night to battle at a location of your choice, and have at it. 
---
If youre more of a solo player, hang out by some valuable resource nodes and wait to ambush unsuspecting farmers.
---
Its not a huge deal at all.. missing 3ish str certainly wont be a big deal.
---
What server? On Fairbanks alliance it’s never like that unless you’re in /world
---
...
---
... If you die first, then all the damage was focused at you, so the others on your team are not taking damage, so when you die there is nothing to heal, because the team mates alive are at max health. It will take a few GCD's before someone else starts to take damage. At which point you target and start casting. You might get a couple of heals of if your lucky before the fight moves from the point you died. Then you are a pretty angel doing nothing.
---
/akf?
---
But it probably would...
---
Here's some actual data for you. Excluding outliers that represent the top .01% of players doing insane dps.  
---
 [https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/statistics/1000](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/statistics/1000)   
---
RET PALLY - Maximum = 49.57 Points  
---
ROGUE - Median/Average = 51.52 Points  
---
Warrior statistics are a bit skewed because there are some DPS tanks that are being lumped into the data (Fury/Prot specs)
---
TUF is great and easy to get. I'm working on it for my resto shaman. I'm not terribly concerned with what is "bis"
---
Well we are alliance and thalnos
---
"game killing cancer"? Hyperbole much? Phase 2 was awful and still didn't kill the game, now you are saying a BG will kill the game because people play it in a way you don't like?
---
Raid guys are 2-3 lvls higher making you miss more. It’s a bitch when you miss shield slam and the dog breathes fire on the raid dps. Hit makes it’s so your abilities won’t miss.
---
Trust your instincts.
---
Correct.
---
&gt; Phase 2 was awful and still didn't kill the game
---
Tell that to Flamelash
---
Just following this sub lately it feels like if it’s not one thing it’s another. People have to right to complain but 80 percent off the posts on this sub are people complaining about some aspect of the game.
---
THANK YOU
---
imagine being this delusional 🤣
---
thank god i dont live in america
---
For sure and that’s the only one that really matters.
---
Huh? 2500g? It's like 90g on Noggenfogger-Alliance.
---
Every warrior looked like that at lvl 34
---
I get plenty of action inbetween galv and our base as horde. Its the players choice if you pve or pvp in av.
---
What are recommended levels for healing end-game dungeons? My shaman is 55 now and I've done the first half of BRD. Wondering when I can get into Scholo/DM/etc without being a burden.
---
You think you do but you don't. Retail WoW never killed WoW, the players did.
---
I didn't know Flamelash was "the game". You are aware that other servers exist, right?
---
Sometime in AV yesterday told me that grinding R14 should be easy since you get so much honor. I didn't have the heart to tell him the truth.
---
Yes im going broke listing items for 1s each day
---
Most of the time the 9 others are not hugging you, and if theres like 2-3 around you, its still 100 honor per 1st kill, 70 next and so on.
---
Awesome pic
---
Can’t tell if serious or shitpost
---
They don’t care about rep or honor/hr. They care about killing you and thats it.
---
Vanilla WoW wasn’t a game. Do you mean original WoW?
---
There's two ways of policing that work.   
---
Police few, but punish them harshly
---
Police everyone, punish fairly.   
---
What Blizzard does is police no one, punish randomly. That never works.   
---
If they don't want to pay for the expensive method, they at least need to do the first one. e.g. ban Staysafe forever from every World of Warcraft version (and watch what he does in turn), so everyone else thinks twice about doing stuff like this.
---
You disagree with the "report for afk" button is meant for reporting afkers instead of people you don't like?
---
I have nothing further to say.
---
For real, though.   
---
I also love the tanks that don't panic when a mob yo-yo's back to me and lets me A) Feign death, B) I'll bring it TO him or try to trap it, or C) If it *can* be kited, it probably *will* be kited.
---
I'm 17/11/23 (Manaburn/Holy Nova / Silence) How you get there is your preference. The only problem with this build is that its really mana inefficient. But combat drops pretty fast, so I run around corners to sit and drink and resume fighting.  
---
My gear priority is Stamina right now, as simple HP helps survive the initial burst. (like for a rogue to stunlock down, or a mage to pyroblast down). 
---
My gear was also mainly DPS gear as I leveled shadow with a friend as a healing priest, so I ended up passing the healing gear to her.
---
Let's be real, this isn't the majority of the community that does this and that it only takes a few bad apples to ruin everyone else's time.
---
Had 2 games in the 30-45minute range last night and they were 10000000% more fun than the other 36 games of "Kill Balinda and Lts, pray alliance wipe on drek so we can get van".
---
Been trying to get the Horde to actually PVP but it's been a struggle thus far. It's quite ironic that the "red is dead" mentality from WPVP is completely gone now.  Alliance and Horde friendship tour in AV.
---
It's more like going back to the arcade you used to go to as a kid and finally beat that one Simpsons' game that just kicked your ass for years on end, but you never really knew how to play it.
---
nice
---
Yeah, I honestly like it.  It's analogous to blitz chess for me.  A slower, more strategic game is what was intended, but what we got is pretty fun, if different.  I do acknowledge that there's not a lot of real pvp happening, this is much more of a speed dungeon clear with a pug.  For the moment though, I'm enjoying it.
---
I don't think hand of rag is BiS for anyone, honestly.
---
BiS - What does it mean, I see it all over this sub, I have no clue what it is?
---
Imagine giving a fuck about hunters
---
I don't have to heal my team if the enemy is dead :)
---
Quick weapon question for ud warriors. Which would be better: 2h fury with tuf or dw fury with Av revered axe mh and mirahs/glacial blade/ lobotomizer offhand?
---
Communication platforms with a rating system are the worst possible form for this sort of dev-player interaction. Hell they are terrible platforms, period.
---
Way too easy to manipulate, by design marginalizing minority opinions and creating "bubble" structures. Yeah, i don't really know why i'm still here either lol. :p
---
However, i know of games where the studio itself moved communication over to reddit (The game i originally made this account for is one). So this is not something exclusively wanted by players.
---
I would actually go so far as to say some studios (And i explicitly use that term because i'd wager it's not a decision the actual developers come up with) go to reddit with the entire purpose of having a cheap way to interact with the community. After all, who needs all these community-people when one guy browsing reddit suffices? Gotta reach the quarterly goals, mate.
---
Where was i going with this? Ah, right, there is more to this than just impolite douchebags yelling for nerfs. Now that might be annoying, but it's only a facet of the fundamental problems we currently have with online communication.
---
Man, that was a rambling essay. Fight the man. \*drops paintcan and runs away\*
---
58, unless you have a raid geared tank. A lot of groups will only invite 60s, though.
---
Shameless plug.
---
WOW... Look at this article I found from 13 years ago that shared a small tidbit of my old guilds dominance back on the original Eonar 
---
https://www.engadget.com/2006/10/11/guildwatch-yoko-broke-up-the-band/
---
"Testimonium on Eonar-H is farming most 40 mans, and wants help for AQ40 and Naxx- a warrior, a hunter, and two druids"
---
Dang ... Memories. Yup, we couldn't finish AQ40 but we said screw it and went straight to Naxx. Meanwhile everything else was on ez mode farm status lol
---
37 is the lowest level you can look like this. But yeah, it still feels like an accomplishment.
---
&gt; Retail where they actually have hard PvE content to speedrun
---
Actually agree, there's challenges you can do with guilds iirc, and also the mythic dungeon difficulties with certain affixes. Not my thing really, but it's pretty cool for those that like it.
---
Pretty hard to do when they are all in leather.
---
If I put my full effort into an AV  I am still pretty much leeching rep and honor
---
Afk will be disabled today
---
Very easy fix. You just make AV give the same (or less) honor than other battlegrounds.
---
thats cool
---
tim is an idiot.. he does stupid stuff all the time and uses joke/comedy to cover it up.. why this guy is popular at all I will never know.
---
I'm pretty even.
---
Guidlie had about 8k and forked over someone's epic mount in a loss.  Biggest win 2k, the rage is comical.
---
&gt; I specifically find Classic WoW PVP to be the worse thing in gaming. It's been changed and balanced for 15 years. Why would you want to revert the PVP changes? Why do you want to be repeatedly sheeped for 8 minutes?
---
The entirety of WoW has been changed and balanced for 15 years. Why would you want to play any part of the game of Classic, by your logic?
---
Also, DRs exist in classic so you can't get sheeped for very long before becoming immune
---
Gotta add the humor tag bro
---
You on thalnos? Im on thalnos. I uave a guild you can join. I’m the only one of all my friends who still plays. But i have a guild where i made new friends
---
As someone who tried to run naxx at level 70, this is completely false.  MAYBE you can get a few bosses down with ~20 people, but 3 is not nearly enough. Turns out the patchwork dps check is still tough at level 70.
---
Disclaimer : this was with a team that was geared enough to clear black temple.
---
Assuming you're actually resto, 57-58 you can start healing 60 dungeons.
---
Even if the difference was 1-2% minmaxers would flock there because ranking system is stupid and masses would follow so you'd be in the same boat. There would always be something a tad better and most people would go there even if the differences were marginal.
---
This is why we need a prediction post... People DID say it was gonna be like that and people, probly like you, sayd it was not gonna be or flammed...
---
It helps their rep per hour if they can disrupt you. That's how they win the zerg: stop it and counter.
---
Totally. Been raiding as elemental for months now and having a blast. One of the best DPS casters for the short, cleave heavy fights.
---
Layering caused literally no negative experiences for me.
---
Unless you were a streamer that could utilize layering complaining for "content" it didn't really have any measurable impact on the game. Even on the economy, it had an insignificant effect. But it made launch much smoother than expected.
---
I guarantee you more people would have been happy to see the honor system changed. Because it's just poorly designed.. couldn't really make it worse
---
I have to assume this is sarcasm. Complaining about PvP in a battleground. I can't believe people kill me when I have the flag in wsg. It's just rude is what it is.
---
Yeah that's what a lot of us old school people refer to the original WoW lol.
---
But yes, pretty much exactly that.
---
Yet this whole thread is about blaming the victims instead of the only ones with the ability to stop it, Blizzard.
---
That would be great in all honesty. If it allowed 5 man groups to qeue for AV.But you can only solo qeue and pray to huesus that if you time your qeue that ur mates gonna join into the same.
---
In vanilla and even retail (i stopped playing after wotlk) u could join as groups into AV. but not now for some reason.
---
It has you grind all the time - everyone I’ve talked to has said the same and that it’s a waste of money
---
Because your magical utility hybrid argument doesn't work long term.
---
You can heal people right now because everyone has tiny health pools and you don't have to maintain your mana over a long encounter to do decent DPS.  
---
What are you going to do long term?  Are you going to wear judgement for spellpower and fill the rest of the slots with plate DPS gear?  Mix and match?  How are you going to maintain the ability to effectively "save people" beyond a single lay on hands every hour?  What happens when the random flash heals and holy lights you toss out crater your mana pool and you're standing there for another 3 minutes of a fight barely doing anything?  Is the DPS loss worth it then over it then?
---
You can bring up one magical scenario where it works out, and I'm well aware of the idea.  That is literally the thinking that made Blizzard design around a 'hybrid tax' and gimp all the hybrid DPS specs for multiple expansions.  But the problem is your argument doesn't make sense out of the vacuum you're making it in.  If hybrids are so useful and magically prevent all deaths.  Why not just take more and more of them?  Surely just bring all the hybrid DPS and no one will ever die because you have all this utility to save people.  But people don't because the specs are all mechanically deficient due to the hybrid tax such that you can't justify bringing that many of them. 
---
What happens when you're out of range to save that mage on Rag because why the hell is a mage in range of melee on Ragnaros unless they got punted to the middle island anyway?  Now the raid is down damage because they took the hybrid DPS and didn't get anything out of it.  I can play this game too.
---
I don't care that you play Ret, and you can make some degree of argument for a single Ret Paladin in an optimal raid.  You could bring more, the content is easy and I'd rather have a good player on a Ret Paladin than a shitty Warrior.  That doesn't make the spec good or well designed.
---
Shit you’re right
---
Hey it works for will ferrel
---
One of the contributing problems is the lack of a ranking system in classic PvP. I am a casual and I’m fine with that. I don’t have time to play five hours in a row to do a raid. I don’t really care about having the best gear, however the problem is I will be forced to play against people that do have the best gear and will be stomped by them regardless of how well I play.
---
 In a ranked system the players with good gear will move up and the players with bad gear will move down until they face similar opponents and win around half the time. In classic, people with bad gear will continuously lose and lose even harder when future raids are released and the try hards get even better gear. This might contribute a lot to people worrying about “getting the best of the best gear”.
---
For me, I will probably give up on level 60 pvp after BWL is released and just make some twinks where it is possible to get the best gear as a casual player.
---
For ENH shamans ATM it 100% is bis, For PVP that is. no question about it, I know Arcanite reaper is nutty but I dont think you can get it yet? not 100%
---
So, decent blues then? That doesn’t sound very tryhard.
---
Classic wow players have incredibly high rate of mental illness. Get off the virtual hamster wheel and do something with your life.
---
Yeh, to vanilla players it means AFKing in the cave leeching honor, but now its to game the system and boot people :(
---
Fuckin gottem
---
So you are blaming us?
---
yea, fuck him for playing how he wants to play
---
&gt; I can see how that's rose tinted glasses because then I was naive and now I know that I should be looking to farm honor.
---
What? Why? I mean, if that's what you want, more power to you. But you had fun doing it and it's not rose-tinted, plenty of other people report the same kind of shit. It's because they DID have fun doing this, but that AV isn't even the version Blizz rolled with. Rose-tinted has become a by-word for "I've decided I think this sucks now, you should to." All to say, if you wanna grind ranks now, do it. Don't do it because you're "supposed to."
---
FD?
---
Vent/Gripe
---
a  lot of sad people here who have to put down other to feel better about themselves.
---
But you need to upload a Guide in this addon No? And joanas guide? How you use this then Just to check what area he goes?
---
Seems like every AV that lasts longer than 12 mins alliance loses, I’m alliance
---
WTF?
---
Finally?
---
LOL...  you are everything wrong with the current community.
---
I mean shamans can kinda do everythingish. They are good healers. Enhancement is a fun pvp spec that can do okay in Pve. And the caster spec can do huge numbers in pvp. So a lot of variety if you want to mess around with different specs.
---
if games go long, it seems horde wins, but its a very slow and painful experience for alliance because of all the bickering.
---
Can you share your thoughts on those possible changes? I feel the same.
---
&gt; isn't everything just set to 1.12?
---
No. Mounts, for example, are not, nor is gating AB or many of the loot gates.
---
&gt;so it would make sense for them to just stick to the 1.12 version since that's the overall content patch that people wanted?
---
Lots of people had lots of different opinions about how to progress through content that could all be considered "no changes" depending on the person. Setting everything to 1.12 from the beginning could easily be considered a huge change (It most definitely is from a gearing and talent standpoint).
---
So I have three addons that are broken after the latest patch that I literally don't want to play without. Anyone know if there is an update for them coming soon or a working alternative until they are fixed?
---
\- Auctionator (I don't like Auctioneer/TSM. Maybe there is another? I have little hope this one will be updated so I wouldn't mind changing...)
---
\- Wardrobe (for quickly switching gear using macros. I dps and heal and sometimes tank. Itemrack bugs for me a lot). 
---
\- Bagnon. The big bag :(
---
My mage is also 31. Lol
---
lul
---
But BGs are now available, and now you are complaining that the arrival of BGs (AV specifically) is "game killing cancer".
---
Complain all you want and I do agree AV isn't fun with the current meta but gross exaggeration ensures no one will take you seriously.
---
How much it takes to farm the rep grind in AV? a week of cheesing that bg or more?
---
&gt; even suggesting changes might bring a reign of holy terror from the neckbeard militia.
---
Let's keep in mind that this works out just fine for Blizz. The less work for them, the better.
---
If you want a massive war, go to BRM. The long AVs are fun like one time, then you never want to do it again.
---
I had strong suspicions before release that the community just wouldn't be the same. Most people back then were totally new to the genre and hadn't seen anything even close to the scale of the WoW world. Nobody knew what they needed to do or what they were aiming for and just enjoyed spending time in-game with their school friends and meeting new people. These days it's all about getting ahead and who has the highest gear score. People just want to troll and create memes...
---
Depends on the tank mostly, but the general rule is that it's 58 for Scholo/Strat/UBRS, and 55-58 for DM/LBRS.  At this point if you're tired of BRD you can expand your runs to include DM/LBRS...DM has alot of resto centric gear like Padre's Trousers and Bracers of Prosperity....highly encourage that.
---
you can most definitely parse grey while also supporting the guild in mc. Mages on majordomo immediately come to mind. Don't get me wrong, the better mages aren't going to be parsing grey in that fight, but I've seen sheeps cleaved on accident and other bullshit happening which causes a mage to focus primarily on not having the raid wipe over getting a blue parse. 
---
It's fucking stupid to look at a parse in MC and judge performance solely based on it, because MC and to an extent BWL weren't designed with this playstyle in mind. Parsing really didn't become "popular" up until Wrath.
---
Just wait a few weeks man. Things will go back to normal once all the grinders get exalted and move on.
---
This is just the first example that came into my head.  There's a lot of stuff we've seen 0 of that are supposed to have similar drop rates.  This isn't bad rng, it's drop tables being changed.
---
&gt;Yeah, if you need a metric ton of mitigation. But without 9% hit your threat will be inconsistent, and getting 9% hit without mask of the Unforgiven is hard.
---
Well yes... that's pretty much all feral tanks have to offer ..... a metric ton of mitigation.  And given in the most cases they wont be tanking raid bosses they dont need 9% to be hit capped.
---
&gt;And orbs. Orbs are always good.
---
Only for selling, or for enchanting your healing set.
---
Every server has toxic players, herod is just the 2nd most populated US server so of course the amount of toxic idiots is more than other servers proportionally.
---
Oh damn, I forgot that it used to purge 2 buffs. I'm so happy that I'm on horde side.
---
Sounds pretty normal to me. I wouldnt expect to play more than a couple hours a week if that was my life.
---
Have to keep engineering but it’s the one profession that gives warriors a lot of tools to win 1v1
---
I just think its silly blaming AV.
---
This guy I was in a bg with yesterday was freaking the fuck out last night, calling everyone on our team trash and garbage, saying we should quit, you name it. We were in WG and the score at the time was 1 : 0 us. 
---
At one point I had enough of his negativity and basically said dude... were level 30s. Chill the fuck out you whiny butt baby. 
---
The bg lasted around 35 minutes and honestly after he shut the fuck up it was the best one I've played so far. Alli went up 2:0 us, and then we shot back up with my druid flag carrying and my hunter friend right behind me. We got 2:2 and it was just 10 long minutes of two hunters guarding me and the rest of the team trying to get through to the Alliance base. 
---
We ended up winning and that game was SO much fun. Bitchy whiny baby shut up, but man when people are like that it's just like dude, you're seriously ruining everything here. It's just a game. Calm down.
---
Thanks. I hit 53 last night. I think I’ll go ahead with sub. Gl and thnx for replying!
---
I do it during non-fights just to freak healers out
---
The only reason to go to AV is rep. No one gives a fuck about honor.
---
&gt; most Classic players are Asian who take minmaxing games to the extreme
---
Proof?
---
Don’t use a 2.1 speed 2h.
---
Less and more, but that is entirely besides the point. The point is shamans completely negative viper sting on any target. Not only warriors love them, now mages love them too!
---
Blade of Hannah
---
Yeah I think it’s between warlocks and mages honestly
---
Hey that is my realm... But I keep rage quitting and haven't made it past lvl 36 :(
---
You don't have to wear BiS in one area and you won't be super gimped, but you'll look badass and actually enjoy your class better. Play how you want and find enjoyment in the game how you want to.
---
Wanna know how youre in a premade?
---
Dont worry theyll tell you.
---
Wanna know when someone is a vegan?
---
Dont worry, theyll tell you.
---
Oh I'd much rather spot Azuregos than pick up a few dreamfoils. We'd have him downed 15 minutes after first spotting
---
How is this version of AV no changes?
---
A level 51 doesn’t have an epic mount and can’t Zerg drek which is the meta. So they aren’t helping the raid.
---
Not one at all. It's just a game. You owe nothing to the people you play with.
---
I guess I just expected some level of moderation in a game that I pay monthly for. If your in a group with friends and want to shit talk that's fine. If you willingly join a guild that is lax about sensitive subjects i have no problem with it.
---
When I'm using one of the games only resource for looking for other players to group with and am seeing people joke about rape that isn't cool.
---
If I'm in the minority then maybe this isnt the game for me and that's no problem =)
---
I mean there’s no evidence to suggest a warmer planet would be bad in the long term (thousands of years) because the biomass the planet could sustain would be far higher
---
Will it though? They're still gonna be there..
---
Yeah, that's why it's a toxic server.
---
Have you seen this place? Any "official Reddit" server is going to be full of whiny sweaty obnoxious neckbeards.
---
I can't even imagine how overwhelming pathetic you must be to want to play a game with a bunch of people from Reddit.
---
I don’t have a rank. Never killed a horde until Tuesday.
---
You can’t say Hand of Rag is the BiS item and then ask what else is BiS. That’s not what the acronym stands for.
---
He would run stuff with like "flask recipe on reserve" or "all righteous Orbs reserved", then just turn around and sell the flask recipes.
---
His point is that if you or another person or two are the only ones PvPing then having an actual battleground experience just isn't going to happen... It takes a big chunk of the players in the BG to decide to actually, you know, PvP for it to happen. But I guess he should just heal the tank at Vann and shut up. 
---
"Brainlessly go defend"? This is what people do when they want to force the BG to actually get played, it's what happened the one time I've seen the BG be anything but a PvE race. They're not stupid, they just don't give a shit about the way you want to play.
---
Right?!
---
I strongly disagree. Your definition of fun is not everyone's definition of fun. Just as you're not obligated to go out of your way and join a hardcore guild, grind for BiS and min/max, nobody is obligated to go out of their way and stop trying so hard and just play the game casually.
---
Basically, everything in this post : https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e9m6e8/an_argument_against_the_stop_minmaxing_just_have/
---
As a shammy you aren't supposed to be healing in premades, your best spec is 30/0/21. Everyone knows that and is aware that ele has insane burst. There isn't a type of situation where a grp would have you go full resto unless that grp is bad since deep resto is a waste.
---
You can expect to throw some offheals every now and then but you'll mostly be nuking the shit out of the other team. The healing job goes to the priests.

I use Auc for Auctioneer and it still works fine. 
---
ItemRack still works fine for gear swaps. 
---
Onebag works for everything but the keyring. Might have to wait a bit for that functionality.
---
I heard there’s talk of releasing bc to people who wish to move to that, if so I’m down but I will stop there bc is my most favorite.
---
You're 100% right, these 2 guys have no clue what they're talking about.
---
Subtract!

I ran a tri spec in vanilla but it was closer to 22/18/11  (mental agility - mana burn / Imp Healing / mind flay,) so that I could raid as well. (the only reason I had mindflay was because if they kicked me I still had another damage spell to cast, otherwise if they kick holy and mindblast is on cooldown there is nothing you can do.) (you can also fish for blackout procs with a low rank of SW:P, which I did to a flag carrier last night)
---
This time I'm (17 /11 / 23, ImpMana burn / holy nova / Silence).
---
I'm specced this way purely for PvP utility. Imp Mana Burn + Silence makes many casters miserable, but its kinda a shit solo farm build, and a shit raid healing build.  I've always believed that Skill &gt; gear &gt; Spec.
---
i.e. If you have enough gear, spec doesn't matter, but if you're a fresh 60, I would stick to one of the more traditional specs to pick up some gear before switching to a PvP utility build. 
---
Hope that made sense.
---
Elemental shaman slowly gets better and better, until peaking in AQ40.  They are already viable in MC.  It's enh which is pretty much garbage.  I main spec an ele/resto hybrid shaman.  Most weeks I lead healing.  I could also do competitive dps in this spec given the option.  
---
We have near the same burst of enh, except it's on demand instead of rng.  And we don't have the range problem that enh has.
---
Would be cool to see him upstage some of the others like asmon etc who kind of seem like they own wow streaming , if he decided to do it more often
---
Using hyperbole like “planet burn” is probably turning people off to her rhetoric, the major human impacts will be migrations and political unrest, which while negative will also be manageable with smart planning.
---
Great job. How are you spec’d?
---
&gt;  But the ultimate goal of the game is to be the strongest you can be by killing the evil bosses and looting their fallen corpses
---
this is a really aggro thing to say. "the ultimate goal of the game" is extremely different for all types of people.
---
WSG is a slow grind though. People who want those wrists should start working on exalted now.
---
So this is why im not reciving any heals in afk valley. All the healers are stuck in terrain...
---
Blizz pls patch magnetic terrain!
---
This is my greatest gripe for sure.  I don't have the same amount of time I did in high school obviously, but I do have way more knowledge and experience, as most people to know how to gear and how to play the game.  In Vanilla, I was in a cutting edge raiding guild that was one of the server first to clear MC and BWL (I quit before Naxx).  Now, I have 57 warrior, using Ice Barbed Spear with Crusader, rocking hit gear, devilsaur set, etc. Light years ahead of how I was geared and how I understood to play the game in Vanilla.  But since I'm 57, I can't get invites to Scholo, Strat, UBRS, etc. because I'm not 60 yet, even though I'm more than geared and knowledgeable enough to handle the instances.  I'll even admit that I can understand why you would want a 60 but the amount of discounting that happens due to level bias is surprising.  Honestly though, I haven't even bothered to ask for invites to any of those instances mentioned above because of what I experienced and see people requesting for those groups.  What does get frustrating is waiting to join groups once you get to the appropriate level and still being turned down.  At this point I'm definitely high enough and geared enough for LBRS but can't find a group because everyone wants you to be 60 to join a group, even though that's overkill.  Hell, I can understand wanting 60s for Tribute or even DM W, but I can't even get into a DM E group because people only wanting 60s.
---
I was glad the other day I finally managed to find a BRD group to do a full run and save princess while I was level 55 and surprise, we cleared it no problem and didn't wipe once.  But needless to say, I see so many people advertising full BRD Emp runs sometimes 58+ sometimes, 60s only, so despite having done it already and saving princess, I have no reason to join these groups or go back, but I couldn't if I wanted to.
---
That's the thing that drives me crazy at the end of the day, most people are more knowledgeable and better geared than they were in the old days when all of us were running these instances way before 60, and now I can't even complete dungeon quests to help me hit 60 because everyone wants to wait till your 60 to let you in a group.
---
Its not a whoosh, its you acting like an idiot.
---
There is a pot for this, I started using them, viper sting no longer works on me....  I have 3 stacks of them in my bag I carry around at all times to remove poisons.
---
well, thats why we need paid transfers (once in 60 days would be ideal)
---
I need to update some addons before raid night...and I'm not using twitch or anything to manage them, just manual.
---
If I delete the old folder for an addon and copy in the updated addon folder...will I lose all my configurations/data?  I'm thinking for my Vuhdo, UI and Auction addons mostly.
---
Lmao the fail at the end but into a win transition I fucking can’t, thank you for the laugh!
---
Not quite as nice
---
This is not limited to only alliance its just mostly alliance doing this atm.
---
I think the core issue lies in the split community. Some people wanted #NoChanges classic, others want a more classic+ type experience. Some are coming back for nostalgia, some are coming back to minmax what they believe to be a great game, and others are here discovering it for the first time.
---
My favorite part about some of these WoW classic streamers is that the ones from private servers tell other people to drop their ego, and sit on the idea that they themselves don't have one ([https://twitter.com/StaySafeWarlock/status/1204777012721676288](https://twitter.com/StaySafeWarlock/status/1204777012721676288)), when they absolutely do and it's cringe af. Imagine having an ego about being "good" at a 15 year old game.
---
Some people are already exalted. I think it’s faster for Ally. For horde probably 4-5 days
---
I remember this AFK thing being an issue towards the end of vanilla. So it was a thing and did happen, it just wasn't an issue until late in vanilla.
---
We've struggled a lot with sulfuron. The off tanks don't have the best mechanics, and even when they do, the healers have struggled to keep me up towards the end of the fight. I've done a ton of research on pre raid BiS, have managed to acquire everything, have my gear enchanted, and come with consumables. Not much I can do besides get funneled tank drops at this point.
---
Our guild is small and growing so we don't have much organization. We have raid sign ups and some partner guilds that we run with but we haven't set up class leads or anything like that. Should that be a priority?
---
Yeah, it was broken. I'm glad it's gone. However, people still feel the need to complain like it was never nerfed.
---
Thanks. That's generally consistent with my assumption but I wasn't sure when it was safe to enter DM. I'm guessing DMW is quite a bit different than a Tribute run. All the Shaman BIS lists are loaded with DM gear, though, so I'm looking forward to camping out there once I can hang safely.
---
filthy noob
---
LB+ChL+ES?
---
One of my most hilarious experiences in WoW was when AQ20 was released and we learned what the Meteor mechanic was via our Hunter pulling an Anubisath
---
He didn't Feign Death, he ded
---
Its not really streamer entitlement, tons of non streamers do this too.  People did this 15 years ago. Its annoying, but blizz doesnt do shit about it.
---
yes, there will always be a meta, but there were times with a more enjoyable meta than the current one and it wouldnt have been hard to accept the feedback and reconsider atleast instead of ignoring the feedback. 
---
they speak up when it suits them and not when it is necessary. \#nochanges wasnt a thing, its just an empty phrase if you objectively look at the current classic version. it only benefits blizzard.
---
Or it was just the way of literally every online gaming experience and it was just white noise to most people.
---
People have finished their rep grind? Jesus. I haven't even hit revered yet and I put in like 6 hours yesterday.
---
If you get offended by words or speech your going to have a rough life.
---
Its not safe spotting when its your guards.
---
Source?
---
okay boomer
---
Damage wasnt a thing in vanilla
---
No. I mean if your planning on grinding rank your going to be doing the same mindless thing either way and going to compete against people with no jobs and bots. So consider that.
---
Holy crap that fast?
---
I did it once because I was mid conversation with a mate and it was a pretty heavy story. Clicked the portal on instinct. Can’t even be mad. It’s part of the classic experience.
---
I found a Black Lotus in Winterspring with my downtime though.
---
If the thing that the game most rewards, using the measures of reward it itself defines, is not the thing the devs want players to be doing or think would be a fun way to play their game, then yeah, that is a design issue. Rewards are part of the design for a reason.
---
How is it besides the point? The GCD the shaman/druid uses to remove it is a GCD they aren't using for something else. If the hunter is stacking int and keeps casting it...
---
LMAO
---
i haven't even been to av yet
---
Pagle is Eastern Time Zone and is probably where you want to be.
---
Such a good feeling!!!
---
Never been on a vanilla pserver and I'm sure it was the same. But on tbc and wotlk pservers, you couldn't bumrush the last boss without capping towers, and while both sides generally avoided each other, you had to compose somewhat of a defense to slow the opposite side down, by recapping graveyards and towers, and when both sides did this, the boss rush would eventually grind to a halt and the battleground would be won with resource points. In short, pvp happened. I think it would've been better with this version.
---
You like spreadsheets
---
I like games
---
That’s OK, I’ll take the imperfections of DKP over the subjectivism of loot council...but you do you.
---
Please translate to American.....Opfer
---
&gt;most rank14 players back in they day were actual trash at wow compared to good arena players
---
You have nothing to base that on.  Most rank 14 players are very, very good.  You get to know your class, positioning and proper fight mechanics because you're PVPing non-stop for months.
---
Same experience for me. AV has always been a BG that kinda failed to deliver a meaningful pve pvp scenario.
---
AV AFK is only exploitable because it is bugged and kicks you whether or not you enter combat.  The debuff will go away and you get kicked anyways.  Sure sounds like a dev problem to me.
---
This version of AV is so intensely boring compared to WSG.
---
People play this game like their prebis and PVP stats are gonna get them laid one day.
---
The desperation to be the best in a world where literally nobody but you gives a fuck about your loot or PVP standing is kind of the typical nerd mind set.
---
A lot more nodes now that people are farming BGs
---
Just quit there's better things in life
---
Please let me know what you find because I took my team and went 50-3 over 14 hours of WSG and got 140k honor and a guy I know afk farmed AV through his phone for 8 hours and got 200k and if this is the case, I'm going to quit playing.  We finished 90 percent of the WSGs in under 8 minutes and still couldn't keep up.  Using hundreds of gold in consumes and stuff.  This is horrible right now
---
This is your reward for not rolling a gay ass undead rogue.
---
"Ight imma head out."
---
So your joke is "5 people like P2" then you follow it up with "I see more of these [positive] posts than rage ones".
---
Ooookay...
---
&gt;*AV was for people who wanted the battle.*
---
AV was the closest we got to the war in warcraft. AV was raiding against the enemy faction.
---
I wish they would add herb/mines into AV.  I just want to herb while leeching honor.  All these scrubs can sit in AV and fish but yet I cant herb....
---
I've been finding I get bored after an hour of av a day. The fact I have to wait until next Wednesday to observe my progression doesn't help. I'm running av for rep but the meta wants honour. I might try wsg because it may offer more fun?
---
For me the thing is, it feels like im always missing quests or only having orange/Red quests and it started to annoy me cuz i dont know what to do. Apperently you need to hob areas.. I dont get the questing system so i Just need something to tell me you understand? I have hard ocd on that it seems 🙂 i dont wanna miss on a thing. So like now, im kinda stuck at my 36 lock..
---
i Can when HOR is over 10k To get. It's a BIS but it takes A lot of time and Luck to get. Once/IF i get HOR ill use that. Point of it what am i using it in the meantime....
---
I'm sure there's some douchers on Herod, but I've found it to be a pretty nice place and it's fairly balanced even though horde has the advantage. Hell, just last week I encountered a female night elf doing the quest to kill the captains of the 3 ships outside of Booty Bay. We both were wary of each other at first and then I proceeded to help her kill the first captain and she stuck around while it respawned to help me. We proceeded to kill all 3 captains together and cheer for each other after each one. It was a truly nice experience during the height of the world pvp madness.
---
If you're not smart enough to understand a fight mechanic and assignments for a boss then you shouldn't be the one looking through parses to assess the performance. I ignore any fight where a dps has a job other than dpsing when determining if they suck or not.
---
I actually wanna have a discussion, not trying to flame you.
---
I'm interested in your use of "incentive" here. What do you feel is your incentive for efficiently gaining honor and rep in a game of AV?
---
I'm guessing you're going to say "efficient acquisition of more powerful gear" or something of that nature. Which is a fair point.
---
But what is your incentive to get that gear?
---
I'm guessing you'll either say "to kill bosses more easily or to make it possible to kill them" or "to kill people in pvp more easily/win pvp matches more easily"
---
But here's where your argument breaks down.
---
What is your incentive to win pvp matches or kill people in pvp? What is your incentive to kill bosses in wow?
---
The only reasonable answer is "for fun." If you don't enjoy whatever you're going to do with your pretty purple gear, then what the hell is the point.
---
So basically the incentive for running around like a dumbass looking for 1v1s in AV and "wasting time" is *exactly* the same as your incentive for doing thing efficiently. 
---
In both cases, *both* people are "wasting time" in order to have some fun in their limited free time
---
The Rise of the Machines - BRD quest is one.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=4063/the-rise-of-the-machines
---
This, it sucks because I love healing but I often am very spread thin during offense in AV because there might be one or two other healers there, but they could be level 55 or even lower. 
---
Also some priests play defense (and honestly ive done it before as priest, it works really really really well). So theres less priests on offense because fear bombing 5 people into dreks room  is way more vialble than doing it as alliance since vanns room is so big.
---
Well those other people expect to talk how they like *in a game they pay for *
---
See how irrelevant that “I pay for this “ argument is ?
---
Right? I had fun from the end of classic through wotlk. That's at least a couple years of fun changes they could make
---
TBH there are a few factors here. If the difference were 1-2% it would be somewhat difficult to prove, so there would be a legitimate debate, and given that player skill could be a factor, would mean potentially it flips for some players. If we were talking something tiny only a small fraction of players would really care. Most of the Min-Max crowd would probably "say close enough" at that point.
---
Put up a defense and alliance crumble. They give up if they get pushed to storm pike. It's not a fast win but it works.
---
Hate us cause they ain't us.
---
why do you care about damage in a 40v40 environment? There are so much dynamics at play that damage tells you almost nothing.
---
a game being well designed is completely subjective, there are dozens of ways to question your statement to make it meaningless
---
is something like dark souls "poorly designed" because people can rush through the bosses? obviously the answer depends on who you ask, but its ridiculous to assume the ability to rush an ending means the game is flawed
---
She is awesome! Get her some chocolate while she's gaming to maximize her bliss
---
It's really boring. It'd be better if the honour updated in real time, but that'd defeat the point of decay and the chase at higher ranks.
---
Perhaps there's a mod which would project my rank?
---
That’s a 19 minute AV. That is not AV in a nutshell lol
---
I’ll never forget how beautiful launch day was. People were so happy and excited to play. Then it dropped quickly when everybody downloaded Questie and raced to the end
---
It was a personal favorite, shame :((
---
I used Guidelime on my lock and loved it. Once you get "up to speed"with the guide it's easy to fuck off and do skinning/whatever and jump back in to the guide when you feel like it. It's not like you HAVE to follow the guide letter by letter, you can skip shit or jump around as much as you want
---
Oh shit really?and yeah I wasn't about farming Treants bane Fck that lol. 
---
Yeah TUF was what i was thinking i just wanted to be sure. If Spinal drops of Rag would you take that of TUF? just trying to get a Grip sorry for the questions.
---
I can't honestly get how people like this shit anymore. Endless grind. Zero skill. What is the point of this game anymore? Only leveling was fun. There is 0 fun in this it's literally an online drug for nerds.
---
So you’re not asking for BiS, you’re asking about what weapon you can currently use.
---
Yeah, start with W and E.  You can certainly do North, although Tribute is both the easiest and the hardest...it's easy to screw up a Tribute run with an "ass pull" because one player has a larger aggro radius.  I'd leave North for closer to 58 if I were you and leave tribute until 59-60 imo.
---
That actually looks like a pretty active pvping match. Don't usually see that many kills.
---
Warriors who aren't cowards, obviously 🤣
---
Up to 30% too, only a 10% difference between that and travel form. I think it also gives dodge or hit % as well but I might be wrong about that
---
As a PvPer, Class Balance &gt; Ease of getting Epic Gear.
---
There's a lot of good healing gear that drops from the second half of BRD, LBRS, and DM E which can easily be healed 55+. People might be hesitant to PUG with a non-60 for some of the harder dungeons like Scholo/DM W, though if you can find a group its generally 58+.
---
FWIW I've just done whatever the hell I want in AV the last handful of games, and some of them get turned around. For instance, enough horde disrupt the ally, they wipe and damn near reset, so then the horde rushing get some time. Or last night we wiped the ally, the horde hadn't pushed so the ally had to actually fight back through us. 
---
That said, I can understand not wanting to fight against what's a pretty strong tide and just ride the wave.
---
I'm hunting for a mh. I feel like I'll never get rid of my +6 stam +6agi knife.
---
Sometimes I hate this sub.... 
---
.
---
And then posts like this just make my day. I love all of you.
---
I've already survived so many pyroblasts. I even survived a double PoM Pyro from a multiboxer while at the AH in IF.  There's only ToEP on the table right now, as the ZHC isn't out yet, so Shield + Renew + Desperate Prayer (if I really need to). I also specced Silence this time around for a reason.
---
And not that I have the gear yet, but in Vanilla I've survived a 4k PoM Pyro crit that surprised the mage so much he stopped to emote to me.
---
This is one of the few legitimate complaints on this sub. Fuck those people, they deserve a harsh punishment
---
Do you mean Aux or another addon? :)
---
Itemrack bugs very much for me sadly. When I first tried it, I could be hitting the switch gear button and it wouldn't do it until 1 minutes later. randomly. It also won't switch weapon while in combat if I had them in a set with armour. Before wardrobe, I used to have macros for all the switching but they have limited char space.
---
Will check Onebag! :)
---
&gt; Everyone wanting WoW classic for the last few years is like missing an ex girlfriend after she cheated on you. 
---
how can i miss something i never had? :) 
---
 first time playing classic and having a blast. not being timegated like in retail feels great. less layers of rng on gear feels great. i do my raid and then i can play other games without falling behind, feels great. 
---
the lack of content in classic doesnt feel restricting to me, it gives me freedom to do other stuff.
---
lmao you ain’t much better if you one of those “free speech unless it doesn’t meet these rules set by me!”
---
Funny how you came in all pretentious and look just as ridiculous
---
Darkhunter, Dark Hunter of &lt;Dark Hunters&gt;
---
It's the boss make up. Vann and the boys are all fury and enrage to hit hard as fuck. 
---
Drek and boys rolled pvp.  They're all arms and we'll... disarm op
---
&gt;You don't have to think about stats [in vanilla]
---
Thanks for confirming you're an /r/wow troll.
---
The only person I know to get in vanilla was 15 years old and it took their entire summer vacation. They basically nothing else but play WoW to get to R14 for 3 months.
---
By making this topic you are now part of the vocal minority.
---
The answer is simple... Entertainment. There are probably people out there who find watching rocks entertaining. 
---
No one said WoW streaming is esports man... Youre the one that made the comparison.
---
I mean it's a known fact that AV gives better honor currently. Doesn't matter how much gold you spend on consumables. Only reason to do WSG is to change the pace that is boring AV games.
---
Kromcrush Bois! (and girls!)
---
Horde is majority but the alliance are no push overs, they come play. It's been a great server so far.
---
Because pvp doesn’t happen in a mystical vacuum where a hunter sits still and spams viper sting for 3 minutes and a shaman sits still and cleanses it for 3 minutes until they’re both oom, lmfao
---
Only reason why you can do that in AV is coz its 40 people, and you dont notice them all. if its 10 people you notice after time that someone is always missing. I belive AV is very bad BG coz as you said it doesnt even requite pvp, but thats the case with any version of AV and not only in this one.
---
Luna unit frames (and I’m sure others) says “feign” over their health bar when they feign death. Definitely wish standard unit frames did
---
Dude, chill the fuck out already. Why are you so mad?
---
WSG honor isn't that far behind, or it least it wasn't for my premade yesterday. We were getting about 2500 honor for a ~10-15 min win, and we didn't even have a strategy. Not only was it more enjoyable than AV, but you don't have to worry about it turning into an hour long turtle
---
U can do that with blizzard options i think. Organize raid by groups or something like that. Way better for those who have group buffs.
---
Guy spent 70 minutes getting about 1/3rd of the honor he could've gotten
---
I was in an hour+ long AV last night that took so long the Alliance all went fishing to forfeit the match.
---
K could you send the actual macro how it’s formatted? And how do you actually use it? Yeah I pull like 750 dps imp spam spec on magmadar and stuff, but my dual wield still seems to outperform cuz of the heroic strike toggle mechanic.
---
From the TOS 
---
Hate speech and discriminatory language is inappropriate, as is any obscene or disruptive language. Threatening or harassing another player is always unacceptable, regardless of language used. Violating any of these expectations will result in account restrictions. More serious and repeated violations will result in greater restrictions.
---
Unless the alliance decides to turtle at bridge for revenge and then the game stalemates until they win.
---
Those welfare epics are bis for pretty much every class.
---
If you are not answering the question why be here...? the question is easy to understand i don't understand how you can't grasp it but ok
---
Actually, the game is bad, and if you don't think so, your brain is messed up and is causing a problem for you. Very sad. Good luck with your insane mirror universe life experience where suffering is good, and enjoyment is bad.
---
I have to reload ui on every queue pop.  First it was HealComm, then Details, sometimes Perl...I feel your pain.
---
What fish do you catch in AV?
---
AV = 40 people
---
40 people = problem
---
AV = problem
---
You have to upload something in the add-on not? Like bustea's or how do you find them/ wich one you used?
---
I hated AV in vanilla. I'm glad that you can just zerg Vann/Drek and end the game in 6 minutes. If I want to actually pvp I'll wait until AB comes out.
---
Explaining the game is different than explicitly telling a person what they can and cant do. Or what they should and shouldn't do
---
./afk
---
Sadly, this sword isn't very good - despite the stats and colour of it's name.
---
This comes down to the reason you use 2h'ed weapons - the top end damage number.  The idea behind using a 2h'ed weapon is to take advantage of the extra attacks (yellow dmg) that come from abilities, such as mortal strike, reckoning, or windfury. 
---
These all do weapon damage, regardless of swing speed of the weapon. Therefore, a fast weapon like Blade of Hanna, will only do 100-150 dmg (+ modifiers) on these extra attacks. Whereas a weapon like Ice Barbed Spear (blue AV Reward) will do 150 -250 dmg on the extra attack. Because of this, you'd likely see that even with 6less dps on IBS, once you use abilities, it will do high dps. 
---
These yellow attacks are why you want a slow 2h weapon - just the same as when dual wielding you put a slow weapon in MH and fast in OH.  The MH weapon damage (not dps) matters for the extra attacks. 
---
Also you should note that for Warrior, Shaman, and Paladin that 100 str is 200ap - it also lasts 15 seconds so will apply to multiple attacks - including the yellow attacks. Haste buffs will also apply to the attacks made with crusader for the additional damage just as much as the +9dmg so those should be left out of the equations.
---
But you can... with addons, had a 26 man crew running last night.
---
Good hunters in AV, pulling 3-4 lieutenants + 2 commanders from bunkers to balindas quarters.
---
Fuck no.
---
&gt;If you're not smart enough to understand a fight mechanic and assignments for a boss then you shouldn't be the one looking through parses to assess the performance.
---
Welcome to the root cause of the issue; where players, regardless of their skill level, will look at parses and judge solely based on that.
---
Annoyingly, any removal or 'nerf' of this feature will only promote AFK abusing. Yeah, you can report people who are abusing report afk, but it still takes time for GMs to look into it and force action. 
---
Its a tricky situation and I'm not sure there's a great solution.
---
If you're not 60 with an epic mount now, you certainly won't be after spending a week in AV.
---
How is Azuregos unfriendly/hostile? He was yellow when I came across him and you can talk to him for a one-liner script response.
---
Wtf is wrong with you?
---
I feel ya, I know for PVE its 100% nightfall forever but just curious what most peeps are doing without the option of HOR cause we know the pains. Most people say TUF its super ez to get.
---
Dispel does two debuffs as well.
---
Unless you do pvp on a pve realm. Then it’s right back to the shitshow
---
When does honor rank update again? Is it weekly?
---
My wife and I rolled horde chars on Atiesh, an alliance-heavy PvE realm and we are happy with it. No world PvP (which is wonderful for leveling and farming) but it exists in TM sometimes when you want it to. There aren't issues with finding dungeon groups, especially if you are in a decent guild. I just rolled a warrior alt level 9 and already see RFC groups all the time. Plus, something fun about being outnumbered by the alliance here. Makes some of the world PvP that much more fun. Let me know if I can answer any more questions for you.
---
Found the grey parser
---
You can still join by clicking the BG Icon that appears on the minimap.
---
 Its possible dw with blues is better for alliance but horde 2h is significantly ahead and id bet its super close on alliance. Oeb is awesome and id 100% be using that.
---
Yea that was sorta my point
---
There's no way a level 56 rogue has 'mostly pre-raid bis'. Most pre raid bis requires level 58 to equip, a lot of the rest requires 56, and if he'd actually spent the time to farm it all he'd be level 60 twice over from spamming dungeons. Also, if a level 56 rogue is actually out-dpsing everyone in your guild, may god have mercy on your poor souls, because a touch of optimizing (or research? Effort?) would do you a world of good. He'd be having trouble hitting the enemies at his level regardless of gear, so I'd wonder what was happening to your 60s... 
---
At the end of the day, if you're level 56 and expecting invites to 5 mans, just don't be delusional and realize that you're asking to probably get carried. You can ask, and it's something that gets done for friends or guildmates all the time, but realize that you're asking for a favor, and expect to be dismissed by people who don't know you.

I agree that it's not necessary to minax, you can have fun playing as a creative spec that isn't optimal, and when you do give players like that a chance it's a more fun game. But most people like your friend would just have the sense to just go get their last few levels quick, and maybe save the double crusader enchants for actual good weapons, etc.
---
Hmm. I'll need to run diremaul for my mount and I cannot face gathering 4 players to help me do it.
---
I've been there done that. Why does it have to be a ballache again?
---
Nah. First, most bis lists in classic aren't even true bis (I play warrior and I lol at some of those lists, despite the fact that warrior's goal: "do more damage" is incredibly straightforward in practice, unlike eg healer classes. All I can say is clearly the bis-creators never ran sims). Second, those that are bis, may only be bis if you have all the items listed, otherwise there are better alternatives. And finally, they're usually only bis for a patchwerk-style fight, which most fights obviously aren't. So, if your goal is to do more than simply dps on a dummy in a vacuum... you should make your own lists.
---
True, a lot of their BiS list is blues; but there's still a half dozen items they should get from raids on top of a decent bit of FR gear. And they should 100% have prio on those items.
---
Perfectly balanced as all things should be.
---
Yeah its perfect haha
---
They're not trying to blend in -- they're trying to walk the halls casually, fond of the memories they made while they originally attended classes. They moved on with their lives and wanted to come back for the reunion but now have to deal with people that trained for a decade on private football fields at home hoping to win the highschool championship they lost fifteen years prior, all while they complain that the high school's field isn't the same as their private one.
---
Crusader is the best melee weapon enchant in the game for tanks or DPS, pvp or pve, does not matter.
---
Crusader is the singularly best melee DPS/tank weapon enchant.
---
No +9 weapon damage is not better.
---
That and sometimes I specifically want to pull one mob off the tank to trigger a explo trap.
---
Are you not supposed to be able to premade?
---
Summed up perfectly. Thank you for the well thought and well typed post!
---
I didn't complain about it because it was still part of Vanilla at one point and also can understand how unnecessarily complex it would be to have rolling updates on classes from 1.1 to 1.12... this is purely from the players PoV and it would be way worse from the devs side.
---
What your asking for is a total overhaul and nothing lIke how it was which brings me back to my point. Right now it is as close to Vanilla as we can realistically get, why go changing that? If you don't like how it is, don't play it?
---
You can find a statement to that effect, but "blizzard" includes people that want it as a museum piece, people who want it as a reformed way to experience wow, and people who see it as just business.
---
Those that think classic can become even better - they think Classic+ is being held back by the NoChanges crowd, who think they're holding back the businessmen from ruining Classic.
---
It is, literally, the best honor per hour. Hence the term "meta"
---
Jesus my dude.
---
Since when was afking minmaxing?
---
As a hunter if I see that happen I will target you the rest of the match lol
---
It would be solved, but the meta of rushing wouldn’t be there. Tryhards would still win, but the overall game would still be more enjoyable.
---
I miss my old 3 min mage. He was super powerful with three arcane buffs in TBC. This time around I rolled a Lock for a new experience...man so different not having blink and frost nova!!
---
play both? play the parts you enjoy in classic and then also play retail.
---
It's 1 iLVL higher than perditions and CTS... 4 iLVL lower than Ashkhandi... 
---
The difference is pretty much nil, whereas the difference between tier 2 set and PVP epics is quite evident.
---
I have not said anything about the AV honor or its nerf. what I said is people will do whats easyest that gives them maximum benefit. If they afk sitting in AB would give most honor, then should you nerf also that ? coz there will always be bg thay gives most honor per h, and people will afk in it. and your solution to afk is to nerf honor. start with av. then wsg gives mose then ner wsg then nerf av then nerf wsg then av then ab comrd out, then nerf ab so it also gives no honor. then wpvp flymaster / harbor camping gives most honor. just  nerf honor gained there. In the end every kill will give 0.5honor and people will still be people  afk in group doing nothing. Dont do anything about afk. nerf everyting around them. Sounds like good plan
---
When I was at my best for high tier gaming, esports was still in its infancy (I'm 30 now). Being a pro gamer then isn't what it is now. I competed in the collegiate circuit in sc2. The 2 games I was the best at were wow arena and starcraft 2. I routinely beat competitors in both games that were/are professional players.
---
&gt; There are physical limitations/natural talent in e-sports as well.
---
I'd agree with natural talent, but as far as physical limitations go the requirements are pretty laughable. You can look at what most pro gamers have looked like over the years. You basically just need hands with working fingers.  A massive portion of professional gaming success comes from game intelligence.
---
This was my thought too.
---
AV should be loading people in at a 1-1 ratio specifically to avoid imbalance. If this isn't happening something is going wrong.
---
It’s also funny, almost every AV I’ve been in so
---
Done has complained about the plan, and someone mentions how much more honor we get than alliance. Well that’s irrelevant, if all alliance are equally depressed values compared to horde it’s a non-issue because they only compete with each other. It DOES mean they probably can do WSG more because the honor values are more in line with each other compared to the 15k+honor you can get an hour as horde
---
Honor and Rep aside, I have way more fun in a quick 5-10 minute zerg rush nuking bosses, than being prisoner in hour long games. I like to do stuff, not be stuck in a tug of war with no sign of victory and most games resulting in a win to the team that has less people AFK out of boredom.

So many people, like yourself, are deluding themselves into thinking the situation isn't so bad, that the people warning that we are in danger are using hyperboles; we aren't. 
---
"Migrations and political unrest" is sugarcoating to say "millions to billions people dying". Yes, planet Earth won't explode because suddenly billions of humans are dying; but tons of ecosystems and species are already disappearing. The situation is completely fucking dire, and instead of addressing it, we have to convince people that are refusing to be convinced because it makes them feel bad about themselves.
---
Go to retail
---
Because classic wow is essentially just another private server now. All their communities flooded to the game and with it, the toxic min max elitism. The game is not allowed to be fun.
---
No, no, I've already got a character there, and I love it.  I just haven't played Classic since a few weeks before Dire Maul came out, and was wondering if DD had shit the bed like other realms.
---
Asmongold is cancer.
---
this morning played around 5 hames of wsg. longest q wasclike 30 sec....
---
The way I describe it is that ele has a little less burst than enh, but it's on demand and at range.  I currently play ele/resto hybrid shaman, and I don't respec for raids or pvp.  I'll respec for BWL progression, but this spec is more than good enough for current content.  If I get lucky with crits I can pump out close to 5k damage almost instantly.  That's 1 shotting almost anyone who's not raid buffed.
---
&gt;If they afk sitting in AB would give most honor, then should you nerf also that ?
---
Yes. But you cant.
---
&gt;coz there will always be bg thay gives most honor per h, and people will afk in it.
---
100% completely false statement and you're just making up bullshit now.
---
Classic was ruined when they chose to go with 1.12, lame excuses like we dont have the data, the game is best balanced in 1.12 all that shit talk.
---
Thanks for encouraging words.
---
While you are right, it's also true that these are very different time. While USA seems like a good choice, there are caveats and the choice is no longer so obvious (that it's necessairily better). Being from you neighbour country, I don't think I could handle USA, if nothing else, the amount of crime, drugs and food quality would be a very huge shock to me. Those are only excuses though. But then again, America isn't the only choice.
---
Thank you and I wish you all the best as well!
---
Most hunters don't even realize its happening, they throw Viper Sting at me thinking its GG and start attacking someone else thinking I will be oom in a few seconds.  
---
Poison removal is an absolute must have on priest, IMO, if you do not have poison removal, you are just doing it wrong.
---
I don't think I can make that jump as a tauren
---
I always play wow shaman. But this go around everyone was Alliance.... I miss my lightning bolts. As a 35 I got crit by a lv38 frost shock for almost 1200. Glorious.
---
You do realize that proportional effects exist?
---
You got 0 honor for more than half of those though.
---
I honestly think very few people would queue for fun.
---
the bum rush is a horribly boring method, the capping method only takes a little longer but it fun, allows for skirmishes and still leads to a victory &lt;- this should be the method established for a fun AV, but BUT -IT NEEDS TO BE COORDINATED-  otherwise enjoy catching up on your shows
---
Except hunter cast it instantly while dpsing you down while healer waste his gcds on dispells instead of healing
---
Triple whoosh
---
???
---
Hate to tell you this bud, but a 16 year old doesn’t know more about climate change than people over twice her age.
---
read the title of this post
---
afking is maxing the amount of uptime you have in game
---
As a moonkin in classic I disagree. I parse in the 95% on some fights in MC and am still doing 1/3 of the dps of an average warrior. The new deformed version of vanilla wow is busted,, even compaired to the private servers. Every person now is a  try hard. The community is not supportive, but toxic. Its been a big disappointment  to me. I enjoy the raiding though, as I started in BC and didnt get to experience it.
---
What if he betrayed his guild and starting hunting Dark Hunters?
---
Have you thought that maybe the problems are a combination of the two?
---
Let's take a look at AV.
---
Could Blizzard have taken steps to make it so AV was not a mad dash to the general? Sure.
---
Could the community also be less inclined to min/max and be world first in the vain hope someone in real life will actually care or acknowledge their accomplishments? Also yes.
---
How about w-pvp? Could blizzard have spared us the pain and released BGs with honor? Yes.
---
Could the community have been less adamant about no changes or taken steps to get their faction to not grief the enemy faction and farm them well beyond honor bonuses? Also yes.
---
Blizzard could have taken *some* steps to avoid issues. But the toxicity of this community tends to find a way to subvert Blizzard at every turn and still grief and shit on other people.
---
&gt; you're talking about 4K honor for 15 minutes.  
---
3.5k-3.7k for 7-10 minutes has been my experience.
---
That addon sucks.  Way too intrusive.
---
Send in VW,  rain of fire, as he’s about to die hit sac and then hellfire, keep a hearthstone ready cause the tail end of the battle can kill you.  Depending on distance I’d get another rain of fire in as the lashers charge me.  Takes some practice but then it’s really easy.
---
Viper sting is WAY more game breaking, than elixir of poison resistance.  Viper sting can single handily shut down a priest in PvP keeping him oom indefinitely.
---
That addon was garbage a few months ago last I used it. Couldn’t even add basic stats like MP5 correctly, so personally wouldn’t trust anything it tells you. 
---
Check out DejaClassocStats as an alternative.
---
Hi, /u/CTULHUFTAGHN
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e9s483/to_galvangar_or_not_tl_galvangar/). 
---
Arena
---
Definitely go PVP.  Its part of the experience.
---
Your the first person to compliment me kn reddit in while. Idk what to say.
---
Yeah we went for a capping run, rushing the inc horde locations and snagging the flags, it takes coordination but its a ton of fun, just avoid rushing mid and causing a clash, noone wants a turtle
---
You can turtle without much trouble, all you have to do is divert enough of the initial zerg.  From a horde standpoint, both forces meet up by Balinda's room.  The Allies always go west side, and the horde always goes on the east side.  If you and say 5 of your friends go on the wrong side and meet the enemy force head on (and stall a hand full of them for a couple minutes) It often throws the whole game off.  
---
You'll notice that over time the meta of BG's change.  When AV launched I played probably 10 games (as Horde) and won 6 of them.  A couple of the wins were 30 minutes long, the rest were less than 5.  The losses were all about 5 minutes.  Later that night when I logged back in, the allies had found their stride and were winning every time, but only with 900 or 1200 honor while the horde were clearing 3600 honor per loss which I'll take.  When I log back on this afternoon, it'll be something else.  
---
Finally, how are you surprised still about stuff like this?  After all of the crying about cross realm BG's and getting the nerfed version of AV, how are you still surprised?
---
How dare I point out a massive flaw in OP's comment portraying the solution as simple. Trying to create an informed and nuanced view of a problem is oh so criminal.
---
The thing you're not mentioning is you can spend a ton of money on consumables to fix that.  That just doesn't really make sense for MC farm.
---
3000 rep isn't that great for 50 minutes though.
---
Depends on time of day, was getting 10-15 yesterday, was getting 3-5min ques about an hour ago
---
Relentless Insomnia. Geez those guys are dicks. Good thing most of the server (Pagle) knows it and goes out of their way to make things inconvenient for them.
---
You sound like a bitch.
---
TLDR: Fun is tied to novelty, and you can't force someone to have fun.
---
Directly from his post that he bolded himself, if he did not intend to say that Fun comes from novelty. He should not write it in.
---
It says in the honor tooltip that you get more honor the higher the level.
---
Its way easier on classic that it was on 1.12 client for some reason
---
There's so many things you could say. I recommend, "supercalifragilisticexpealidocious."
---
Give it a try, if you don't like it you can always reroll something else
---
Literally just time it over voice comms. If you don't get the same one then leave queue and try again. You can  always specifically queue for the one that you friend got. Have your friend not accept it until your queue for that game pops.
---
Yea but it's a domino effect. Someone shoots 3 people in 1964 and everyone within 50 miles hears about it. Someone shoots 3 people in 2019 and the entire country hears about it. Now we've got more mentally disturbed people exposed to such hate. And they start to think that they should go shoot some people too. We've also got a country full of people on very, very strong prescription meds who dont need them. Theres alot more factors than what you're acknowledging.
---
Ah yes, I forgot that soliciting relationship advice from a 40 year old is pointless because Bill Cosby and his 80 years of wisdom on how to treat a woman override the younger man. 
---
You people are using the fact that a 16 year old is saying it as an excuse to dismiss her words.  You are looking past the argument and to the speaker because it benefits your position.  
---
Hated to tell you that, bud, but at least you know 👍🏻
---
Your logic is fucking pathetic. Stop pretending you aren't accountable for yiur actions because of "the system". 
---
Pure cowardice. I've more respect for gleeful trolls and campers than people like you.
---
So anyway, I started blasting...
---
Problem is if you always have that posted, anyone else selling just needs to undercut you to get the sale. Have you seen other people selling that recipe? 
---
75g in your pocket now is much more valuable than 100g in a month or two unless you literally have nothing to spend it on because you have so much gold.
---
im glad this is how people feel. the fewer druids there are the more loot there is for me. they'll see... one day they'll all see...
---
The portal reagent is literally 20s lmao. It might even be 20s for a stack of 5? Can’t remember... either way: it’s dirt cheap.
---
It was clearly sarcasm
---
This is exactly the reason the current version sucks.
---
This AV is horse shit once people are done with rep grinding, no reason to ever return.
---
With nost's av, you could always join av and have a fucking blast.
---
same, i have a lot of fun doing solo shit in av. most avs start with pulling the elites which were skipped to the group then i try to catch people solo. after this i try to (re)cap flags while using all my engineering stuff.
---
hell, once i got into the same av with some friends, we managed to wipe the opponent faction at the boss with sappers and we won after that play.
---
like 99% of the people dont even know the jump into the alliance base, yet they act like the current way is the most optimized way to do things when it isnt.
---
What is there to be big brained about? Lol
---
Rush Drek or don’t
---
Battlegrounds will never match WPvP, shout out to the ones who rolled on a real server. Alliance or Horde!
---
(4 character limit)
---
2 monitors will cure this with ease.
---
It's time for payback. Kill every single horde you see, make them suffer!
---
That's kind of a non-issue for this content tier though.  Drop right before the pull.  Most MC fights are a 1 drop.  Maybe refresh the mana spring since it's 60 seconds instead of 120.  Also I more and more use the end of a spell, when I'm waiting anyway, to drop my totems.  Trick I learned from playing FFXIV.
---
Yeah it’s an anime.
---
Itemization is nice and all but when it comes to loot I want to really really want to have it. I should know the name of gear and which boss drops it. When I went back to retail in legion after quitting in the start of cata I literally never learned the name of my gear. Except the arcano crystal, because fuck withered jim. I can still remember the name of most of the gear I had and raided with throughout vanilla and the first two expansions.
---
Have you purchased your official copy of WinRAR yet?
---
I will tell you what I do.
---
Click on your guild and there is a tab titled "Rankings".  It should bring up a list of everyone in one of your logs.  From there click on yourself and this page should come up.
---
1. I'd still argue if you're saving people 9/10 fights then your raid is probably skating way too close on healing and there are probably people you aren't saving and could save as Holy.
---
2. My recollection is in terms of theory-crafting STR ends up scaling better alongside the fact there isn't enough spell power gear to support a full spell power build.  If that isn't the case I'll defer to you, I won't pretend to be an expert on it.  That being said as far as I know mana will be an issue for you long term.
---
3. Good enough how though?  This comes back to the entire hybrid tax thing.  A raid with a significant amount of hybrid DPS will suffer serious deficiencies compared to one with mostly main DPS classes.  DPS doesn't matter that much now but there are fights eventually where it does.  I mean a huge part of your argument is predicated on saving people who do significantly more DPS than you, so they need to be there.  You're making an argument for bringing a few but not many hybrid DPS.   But the entire reason these stigmas develop for hybrid DPS is because there are a ton of them and it really sucks if you do bring a lot of them.  Ret being one of the most prevalent ones in vanilla and now classic.  If everyone wants to play the hybrids because they're "good enough" then the reason they're "good enough" ceases to matter.
---
4. You're bouncing back and forth a lot on your relative DPS numbers here.  You've said you're a top half of the raid DPS, you've said top 10, now you're outperforming most 'tryhards' while also basing your argument on saving people that do a ton more damage than you.    
---
5. I mean, this all being said you have a better grasp on why you'd be in a raid versus most Ret Paladins who just play the spec like a warrior, do less damage, and hence just end up being a net drag on the raid.  Like I said, I don't really care that people play Ret, and your point of view is easier to defend than people who just argue it doesn't have a much lower ceiling when there is tons and tons of data to show it actually does.  I just dislike the hybrid utility logic because it's easy to conceptualize in a vacuum and was used to really hurt a number of classes design-wise for a long time, and I don't think it's too convincing (which is why Blizzard moved away from it).
---
Or to the Valley and queue inside the Cave.  Quests are also in the at the Cave.

Wow, someones cranky. Did mommy not pay your sub this month?

I have killed angerforge 217 times &amp; haven't seen HOJ drop once.  =(   If I get to 300 without even seeing it, I am parking the character until it also drops off Emperor.
---
Sorry when I see a tank with Ony trinket I just have to laugh at them its pathetic
---
Rofl, comments like this are hilarious. 'Lost my raid group from one bad parse', which only happened because 'I was bored'. So what, you afk'd? Didn't try? Showed up to a hardcore raid PvP spec and no consumes? This one has to be on you somehow rofl
---
Link your Warcraft logs mate. Let's see the numbers behind the story :D
---
what mod does this?
---
It's truly amazing just how much cancer can these people be.
---
Buffed feral tank wins vs buffed furyprot in threat generation. The talents are that much better for threat.
---
I would reply, but
---
*you can’t do that while shapeshifted*
---
I have rod of ogre magi. If I got staff of dominance, I would for sure not be getting mageblade as well (my guild is loot council). 
---
It's just that I may not even get mageblade, and claw of chrom etc. are even further in the future. But I suppose I should just get it out of the way now.
---
There is no link between esports mentality and this... Having good geat isnt esports, being a streamer isnt esport culture.
---
Mana burn comps were huge in TBC due to to prevalence of shit like SL lock and Resto druid.
---
&gt;*people watch WoW streamers for the same reason they watch sports*
---
They do. Entertainment.
---
Just getting a few to take the graveyard would be enough to swing the advantage.
---
Yes and no.
---
With W-PVP people complained about the same problems. Corpse running, flight point and boat camping. But never, ever to the severity of degree that it was this time around. Honor in vanilla did bring around some major griefing and complaints, but nothing like compared to Phase 2 of Classic.
---
Battlegrounds though are largely the same, except there are less complaints about long Horde queue times.
---
No changes, deal with it.
---
Unfortunately, you can't tell people how to have fun. People are going to do what people want to do. I think a potentially better message would attempt to ease the minds of the people who are only doing it because they feel like they are losing if they don't. Many people are just jumping on the grind train because they feel like they must or else they are going to get left behind. This is not the case and it would be nice if the community would encourage these people to play the game in a way that makes it fun for them.
---
I've been spamming WSG since BGs dropped. Having an absolute blast watching people camp mid and chase single players across the map. Those people in AV are in no way hindering my fun. Don't care if they are dwarfing the amount of honor I'm getting. I'll eventually reach my goals one day. I'd advise others to do what makes you enjoy the game. There will always be other players in the same category as you with the same mindset.
---
Its called the backdoor
---
Yes, Ivus the forest lord.
---
FYI AV is only 51+ anyway
---
There is nothing in 'old' AV that would significantly inhibit the zerging. 7 minute zergs become 12 minute zergs. It's not going to make it into a magical turtlefest every time. A few more NPCs isn't going to change it as dramatically as you think.
---
They will start doing it, I am suprised it didn't latch one earlier. Its pretty much the standard on pservers to avoid the bridge.
---
I’ve seen people in the 200s. If anyone is serious about ranking they will stay in AV. It’s a shame
---
Last MC rag dropped double T2 druid legs. Our 2 resto druids had it, so I, the feral druid, got one for each leg
---
You'd have to clear more of that first room, the rest of the instance is pretty much the same. 
---
An extra 1 or 1.5 hours of playtime over 50 runs at an hour each, is like.. 2% more time needed. 
---
Hardly as much as you're exaggerating it to be. Try again.
---
Shocker that a group of toxic people on reddit all playing together forms a toxic server.
---
You didn't read the actual post did you?
---
That's the thing, yeah. When ALL of the gear is "good", it just blends together and becomes forgettable. You don't even remember the names of your gear pieces because it's all the same "stam + (main stat) + (secondary stat) + (secondary stat)" on every piece of gear.
---
Ok, and your point? If you watched the video, it clearly shows that this is a problem that people are facing
---
The problem with this is that you're trading a quick loss with lots of honor, for what is usually a much longer match that doesn't have nearly as big of an honor increase.
---
That is, there's a lot more honor to be earned in killing Lieutenants/Commanders and Balinda than there is in "winning" the match. I regularly see matches where the Alliance "win", but because the Horde were busy actually doing stuff that earns honor, they get 2x the honor the Allies did, or more. So yes, better to do that in 5-6 minutes, than to drag out a match to 30-40 minutes to earn a couple hundred extra honor for killing Vann.
---
On alliance everyone is looking for swords for their humans.  Rank 14 is a great way to up your guild dps and up your own dps because you can get the better non weapons.
---
On Horde, there isn't as much of a fight for swords because orcs want axes and rogues can't use axes, so it's a little bit worse on Horde, but still beneficial.
---
I think having 10 or so guildies trying to get into the same game is fine. Then again, my guild isn’t full of a bunch of shitheads who start reporting people “AFK” when one or two of us doesn’t make it in lol.
---
The item will go red if it is equipped and the stats will not count
---
well, if i dont like a dungeon then i dont run it. if i dont like a dungeon, but it has something i need then i swallow the bitter pill and run it until i have what i need.  
---
if i run it multiple times with the same people then i stick around until everyone has what he needs as long as it has a reasonable dropchance.(not from a rare, 15%+)
---
Just wait a week or two when most of the hard cores get exalted then they will swap over to WG for the pvp and more strategic aspect. Everyone and their mama is q-ing for AV for the exalted rewards
---
When hasint BG chat been a cesspool? Did I just play on a bad server, because all I remember is people being super shitty.
---
Each server is independent from each other for honor calculations. So a random Rank 11+ person from a different server should not be affected. Only from the same server as these dudes.
---
Terrible use of the meme.
---
Do you solo the lashers? Dumb question but I sadly stopped playing my pally before DM but I want to go back especially if there's a decent farm method
---
Am I the only one who doesn’t give a flying fuck how other people play the game?
---
Cut the crap. You literally started the comment chain with an analogy of starved dogs and meat.
---
You're not starving. You're playing a video game. For entertainment.
---
No system is forcing you to be a dick towards other players, afk reporting them in AV for your own personal gains. No game theory can justify such toxic behavior. It IS a community problem.
---
It just so happens that if you pretend 39 random players are going to bend to your will, you won't have fun.
---
The only thing you can do is put yourself in a position to have fun. This is a dynamic feat - it depends on where your allies are and where your enemies are.
---
That's what's fun about AV. I've already had games won because of my own personal decisions - and that's very rewarding.
---
You can scream "but this player finds an increasing the rep number to be fun!" all you want, but I don't really believe it. Nah, you're just grinding instead of finding a way to find real enjoyment.
---
If I immediately just got exalted right now and got number 1 honor ranking this week, I wouldn't call it more fun than just one close 1v1 where me or my opponent performed well for a thrilling fight that gets my blood pumping - true fun isn't quantifiable
---
With this version of AV, only AFKers and bots will reach those ranks for the next 6 months. You're gonna have to wait a while to even have a chance.
---
Im at around 180 and ive lost the roll 5 times.   I can relate.  Ive also only seen the sgc boss twice in that time.
---
Then why are you complaining when they're not inviting you or removing you from their groups?
---
Ah, just overwrite the existing files?
---
This was a 45 minute game though
---
It is. Much better.  WoW classic combat is fluid, quick paced, interesting.  ESO combat is clunky and awkward.  It looks nice I guess, but I don't judge games on looks but on gameplay.  I can get over shitty 15 year old graphics if the gameplay is fun, I can't get into the best looking game of all time if the combat is shit.  
---
ESO could have been a good game if it was designed as a PC game, being designed to be playable on consoles made it garbage, imo.
---
I think you were in my same bg, gz

And in this day and age of instant communication around the planet, with a resource that contains virtually all of human knowledge, there is literally no way for anyone to become educated on any topic ever.

I agree, but instead of responding to the thread that directly references this, I'm going to make my own one.
---
They do a great innervate.
---
Was it common on the regular wow sub for people to write long ass paragraphs with nothing of great value said? Do these wow players just like writing? I mean...go for it I guess. Just seems like a waste of time
---
Quit cutting onions dammit.
---
Its far more likely to happen with the alliance because they need comparatively far less honor then the horde to rank up. So these types of mind games actually can benefit you.
---
Wow this is an actual "OK boomer" moment
---
When you choose to play a remake of a game made in 2004, and then come in discussing about changes to be made - yeah you can shut up and take it how it is, or not play at all.
---
I completely agree with that statement. Take it or leave it, don't try to change it - there's no discussion on the table for changes. 
---
If you want change in your WoW game - go play Retail. Many people look at the PvP honor system fondly and removing or changing the ranking system would be a huge detriment to the experience for those players.
---
They upped the spawn rate to kill this off, which seems to have worked at least on my server.
---
How do you even que together?!
---
Yeah. I thought that was the case. The comment was a bit tongue in cheek, but I wasn't 100% sure that they didn't provide something awesome that holy couldn't. It's telling that my rogue would be getting blue parses with those dps numbers.
---
Yep that's the leveling plan. But if shit hits the fan, you can easily manage it
---
This is some nice wholesome content you guys are a great guild
---
Yes, holy can leep the sane uptime. Stop making up lies to justify your shit spec.

Nah you just get afk kicked if you're not with the zerg group.

...wat?

Not everyone uses discord yo. Don't have to be a douchebag over it

A friend of mine had this happen to them.  He was reported and kicked out immediately and was mad he had to sit around unable to queue for 15minutes.  He was just trying to rep grind.

Quick weapon question for ud warriors. Which would be better: 2h fury with the unstoppable force or dw fury with Av revered axe mh and mirahs/glacial blade/ lobotomizer offhand?

The very first time I downed Ony, Stormrage Cover dropped. I was pugging with a guild since I couldn't make mine's raid time that week, and they said they literally didn't have any druids for the raid, the only druid they had, just one, wasn't Ony attuned yet. The other pubby druid was feral, so he didn't roll on it(he even whispered me to say grats because druids are the best).
---
I bring this up everytime my GM rolls against the other 4-5 rogues in the raid. We did Ony this week and my fellow officer resto druid just got his antler-hood as well. I have only raided a few times but I am gearing up super fast(there's some competition with paladins for leather healing items though). Fringe benefit, but a big one!
---
In an ideal world I'd be playing TBC or WotLK, but since that's not an option I'm playing Classic because I refuse to take part in retail's Warforge/Titanforge system.
---
If you're serious about flag running, grab the nature's grasp talent from the top of the balance tree to root anyone who melees you. Bind a powershift macro and remember that canceling your form also removes any slow effects.

The lack of lifebloom in classic hurts a bit. In BC I had a tank focus cast sequence macro that basically kept the tank constantly hotted giving me time to heal the rest of the raid.

---
Not at all. If anything Alliance has the upper hand but not like occupying major cities of the other faction bad. It's still a little slice of paradise amongst all the crap I read about.
---
No.
---
Reasons druids are good:
---
1. Free and easy loot
---
2. Faerie fire
---
3. Don't have to respec between PvP and raid
---
4. Only hunter and maybe rogue can kill you 1v1
---
5. Laugh at mages as you melee them to death

6. You can use noggenfogger to turn into a skeleton while in cat form and whack people really fast with your 2h.

Ryuk ?

This has not happened to me once and I back cap every av since im a stealthy. I've had ppl in my bg afk at start and not get reported either. All those posts made it out like it is a main stream occurence.
---
what's a good threat meter addon that's not details?
---
I just press auto run and browse reddit. I'm almost exalted and havnt done anything but be a dick to people on here.
---
Tell me about it. At least my wife lets me play and cheers me when I level up. I did a no nut till 60 challenge as well. Needless to say, I wouldn't be surprised if we had twins or triplets.
---
Your post doesn’t even address the points made, you just created a soapbox to stand on to tell people to get a life. If you hadn’t noticed, they’re still actively making decisions on what Classic is to be, and people are giving feedback on what they’ve released so far.
---
“Not playing WoW” isn’t the answer to “how to make WoW Classic better.” Lol.
---
Is the Details threat meter (Tiny Threat) working correctly since the last patch?  We have a raid tonight and I'm wondering if we need to make a contingency plan before then.
---
I run Moonfury druid in AV and run only in cheetah form to trick people into chasing me for an "Easy" kill.  Then destroy them.   It's usually mages and warriors who don't know how to PvP but think those class is God mode who are dumb enough to split off after me.  They realize the mistake usually right as the 2300 damage Starfire lands and try to run away when roots break, and you can't escape a druid....
---
I don't even use any threat meter haha, been raiding for 2 months and still dont use one xD just not sure how to set one up
---
I only exclusively played WSG, and Tuesday I only played 1, 10 min game. I had 2.5k honor.  When I get home, I'll check my score.  I played 6 games yesterday over 1.75 hours. (one premade took 45 mins).
---
It's funny because it's true
---
Those murlocs must have like 10 % chance of actually dropping a head, I feel as though I killed a hundred of them before I was done
---
which shows how dead retail is
---
and when thats done..... your gonna start pvping?
---
against whom honestly? everyones in AV for the most part becasue even the honor gains are better than WSG
---
thats the confusing part to me, ppl gonna get their rep gear and rank up.... then want to have some real pvp, only to find... AV boss rushes are the only thing people are doing
---
Either way.... im doing WSG and eventually AB(when it drops) just to do them.... (After the AV rep rush)
---
Highly doubt they would start putting effort into it when they can just give us 2.4.3 / 3.3
---
And people that automate a program to do this will also have the highest PvP rank! Grats! Nope, nothing wrong with 1.12AV, nothing to see here!
---
I did 2 hrs of WPL questing yesterday and The only fights I had were a couple fun 1v1’s.  I had to skip that zone entirely til now.
---
Played four hours this morning and went from 1500 neutral to 2k into honored so that’s about 10k rep with another 31k to go. Somewhere between 16-20 hours left. The grind doesn’t seem that bad considering the rewards and the honor gained.
---
It's easy. Just create a second meter window, go to the settings, click raid add ons, and click Tiny Threat.
---
Part of it's just lag. There's less of it now on average. Yeah, laggy raid experiences still happen, but back in the day, sometimes servers were dodgy and you'd just keep mashing buttons in your rotation hoping nothing went awry. 
---
That and of course 1.12 talents and itemization, which were a massive boost. 
---
Anyways, Boomkins and shammies are generally benefitted by this. On most fights, if you have consumables, you're gonna be fine on mana now.
---
I'm sure she appreciated your abstinence while nerding out on video games.  Hey just like the old days right?
---
Do people watch streams while they play? I've never been entirely sure where they find the time.
---
Not in oceanic battlegroup at night. There aren't enough people queuing for instantpop.   
---
Also, systematically 16 man often? That seems unlikely.
---
alliance can't summon theirs, it's bugged atm.
---
Give it a week and it will flip once people finish the rep grind.
---
You also get rep for him being killed at the end of the battleground, separate from what is given when you kill him.
---
Don’t confuse the community with the forums. WoW forums have *always* been a cesspool, but the actual community (when it had one) was awesome.
---
Dude killed his mom for a new computer. Nice
---
If those people aren't having fun, they have some options:
---
- get better (raiding/PvP, whatever is the pain point)
---
- reroll on a different server
---
- or play a game that is fun for them.
---
All the "problems" people keep bringing up were in vanilla, we just dealt with them. 
---
It sucks people didn't research servers they rolled on before hand and got imbalanced or a streamer server. It takes at most 4 weeks to hit level 60, just reroll on a server that fits your game play.
---
See you’re proving what you said was hyperbolic rhetoric, some areas have increased fire risk, that’s accurate. But the world is not “on fire” it’s a small percentage of people facing a moderate increase in risk. 
---
You’re acting like a Nuke was dropped on NYC, or Beijing when nothing comparable has happened, the incremental nature is going to lead to populations migrating and lots of costs for governments but it’s not any more dire for most people than that.
---
Other pain points are also going to need solutions, like ocean acidification, but there are real eminent risks to fisheries that are 100% preventable and are not related to climate change/warming.
---
Focusing on the ideology of Climate Change As Religion is detracting political will from actual eminent, and dangerous ecological disasters. For instance, some food basket areas have double digit harvest left before they are unsuitable for agriculture, and the fishery mismanagement will literally cause famine.
---
Technically the Baron Rivendare mount is free, but good luck with that. 
---
Yes, the AV mount is the cheapest epic mount you can buy in the game.
---
This sounds way more fun than getting nuked on the way and never seeing the enemy keep ever, then 5-10 minutes later you either win or lose and did nothing to contribute. I just want a juicy PvP AV match, not this honor/rep farm meta bullshit
---
Probably in asia
---
Yep, and if they brush you off like [this](https://imgur.com/Eo0HfDe) then just open another one immediately.
---
No haste: 
---
\+9 weapon damage: dps increase of 9/2.1 = 4.28. Relative AP worth = 4.28 \* 14 = 60 AP. Completely agree with you so far
---
Crusader: Proc chance is 1.82\*weaponspeed ([link](https://rogerkarlsson.com/blogs/wow/crusader/)), giving you 100 strength for 15 seconds. So a 3.82% chance, giving you an average 60/2.1\*0.0382 = 1.09 PPM, for an average uptime of 1.09\*15/60 = 0.27, and a relative AP worth of 100\*2\*0.27 = 54.5 AP. 
---
You mention Haste buffs, are you playing a Shaman or a Warrior (assuming Flurry in both cases)? The haste buffs will benefit both enchants equally I guess, since you just hit more (giving you more uptime of Crusader, more benefit during Crusader, or just having more hits hit +9 damage). 
---
So on paper I would say +9 seems better and more consistent than Crusader. What makes Crusader better to me is that you can stack cooldowns (abilities and on use items) to capitalize on the buff. Now all the abilities you do during the uptime will have +100 strength, potenitating them more than having only +9 damage. 
---
Hope this helps you out, please let me know if messed something up / something is unclear.
---
Probably just a visual bug.
---
Because people pay more attention to the team fight rather than trying to pad the meters.
---
Exactly. We punish the people who do this shit.
---
We don't simply say "oh well killing and stealing is wrong, so don't do it, then be upset when those people do it because there's no consequences."
---
yah if ur alliance thats partly why
---
Alliance is the ones running premade WSG due to insta queues
---
the ones pushing rank on horde (which would be the pvp'ers that would make wsg groups) are simply doing afk/solo AV
---
hence.. horde premades are less common than allys for WSG
---
I've had the same botter on my friends list for over a month now.
---
There was a blue post saying gear items from WSG are coming next year with the BWL patch in phase 3.
---
Oh, that may be good news for not having to avoid AB pre-mades. Don't get my naive hopes back up.
---
Alliance or horde? I’ve heard horde get better honor but I just sort of dicked around without trying on alliance yesterday won every game but one. With a turn in every win, it feels like alliance is getting mad rep in there.
---
I run a hybrid spec with 2/2 searing light and 5/5 spirit tap. Grab a modest dps set with ~200 spellpower. Farming mobs is as easy as Holy Fire + Smite + Smite + Smite. Don't even bother with SW:P; stuff dies too fast.
---
Farmed Azshara naga for pearls, hinterlands cave for mushrooms (can holy nova farm for money while waiting), then run strat lives until you get lucky with orbs and pattern. All while keeping mooncloth on cooldown (Azshara for Satyrs too, get some sweet demonic runes too).
---
While I was doing a similar farm for my Hide of the Wild, the pattern for transmute undeath-&gt;water essence dropped. It's worth about twice as much as the Truefaith pattern, so I sold it and bought the pattern.
---
I really hope this is trolling............
---
i thought it was the pants that weren't in the rewards yet?
---
I don't think the towers will cap fast enough for a 7 min win. 15 min is being conservative. My experience for a 'full' alliance win is at least 12 min.
---
You can also show friendly health bars and right click the BM's health bar to open the dialogue.
---
Be a rogue, autorun to harpy cave, stealth.
---
Weapon damage for MH dagger on a backstab build is better, right?
---
Two reasons :
---
1. Crank up that backlighting to max in order to recreate the blinding CRT monitors on that sweet-ass 800x600 res.
---
2. It works exactly like a flare - the brighter it is, the easier it is to detect rogues.
---
So how does honor Diminshing honor work in BGs. If I remember right during the wpvp boom after you kill one person 4-5 times for the day you don’t get any honor. Does that work the same way for BGs? We had a AV last night for almost an hour and some people I had HKs on for more then 10times. Does that mean half the times they didn’t yield any honor to me/us
---
The issue is not data, it's how people are playing the game, farming everything to death as fast as possible every day. The whole bullshit about BiS is a straw man.
---
Yes you do! I could talk alot about it but the major focus: 
---
you jump down into garden area and solo the 8 lasher packs, avoiding the elites that patrol and the elite lashers. Blessing of sanctuary is very important here as you will be herding the mobs in front of you and blocking with retribution aura, killing them with reflective damage. I've done this with full t0 starting out and it is an excellent set to use here.  You don't need an offense focused shield here either! I started with draconian deflector with a mithril spike.
---
 I also kill the elite demon that patrols the hallway on my runs for felcloth and demonic runes, but I'd reccomend skipping him until you get into a groove because he slows you down and can be difficult without enough damage output.
---
If you search for 'quissy diremaul east paladin' on YouTube she has a great in depth video guide, and she uses a holy spec as well!
---
PEOPLE HAVE LIVES AND DONT LIVE ON BLIZZARD MARKETING SITES LIKE YOU AHHHHHHH..  Your point is meaningless and this version of AV sucks. Blizzard releases sucky content, people dont have fun. HOW ARE YOU NOT GETTING THIS ?!?!? AHHHH
---
How the hell do you figure you're part of the majority? Did you poll?
---
Trust me. Very possible on oceanic battlegroup it seems. But yeah, will take the next screenshot I see. Decided to quit for the night when I saw it again.
---
Taunt is a spell. It is unaffected by hit%.
---
The only people who fit the reality you're talking about are people like you. You have no clue how people want to play the game, or the time with which they have to play it, apparently. So don't tell them how to go about their business.
---
Excellent, the more people underestimate you, the easier it is in PvP. Spread the word \^\^
---
Do the quests, farm gold off trash mobs, fish or whatever else, the zerg will still happen and you will get your rep/honor but it doesn't feel so mindless and repeated.
---
People don't neccessarily watch sports because they are the best athletes. They watch it because they find it entertaining.
---
Your an idiot
---
If you're raiding as a moonkin and looking at logs, then yeah, you're in for a world of disappointment right now. There's a reason druids are exclusively either resto or feral tank for raids.
---
I like the idea of something like an m+, plus it just being speed running isn't the way, for all the reasons you mention.
---
[deleted]
---
I have only played 3 matches so far, as horde, won 2 out of 3 and one of those wins was a 45 minutes long with several wipes and ending with a push with the summonable “boss”
---
You just replied in an absolute by saying everything is in absolutes lol
---
Time elapsed is shown on the scoreboard for honorable kills and killing blows and honor points.
---
Can you link that to me?
---
WOW. Thank you . It works really great
---
NF/Conflag
---
its gonna stay that way tho
---
15,000+ honor per hour from AV losses 
---
0-5000 hour per WSG, dependent on wins/flag caps
---
...... unless something changes, AV will be where most people "pvp" (if you can call it that)
---
WSG/AB i cant see being popular outside of the weekend holidays..... and for ppl who simply want to do those BG's for the pvp...
---
So if you want to rank up beyond Rank 10, prepare for AV boss rush's for a month or so.... unless they change something (doubtful)
---
Yeah me too. What is devito talking about in this interview?
---
Killing Bal and LT's gives you way more honor. If Allies wipe on Drek it's still possible to win if you get to Van quickly
---
Yeah for sure, I just like how the interfaces are (quest log, map, etc) compared to retail. I like how you pretty much can use zero add-ons and it doesn't affect you much, the one I rely on most is my auto shot timer though, definitely couldn't play without that one.
---
“GMs are not going to ban players for using the tools”
---
&gt; GMs are not going to ban players for abusing
---
That GM needs a talking to, or their manager needs a talking to- that’s as tonedeaf a response as the Blitzchung idiocy.
---
What’s the best video to watch that can help me understand how to be effective in AV?
---
EVERY player needs 12 more buttons on their mouse.
---
&gt; significantly weaker
---
Eh, let's call it ~10-15% between a 60 who's appropriately geared but with no pre-raid BIS stuff, and someone who's spent hundreds of hours grinding out specific dungeon gear.  And that's not even getting into actual skill, which can account for a lot of variation in DPS, and even more in healing.
---
I'll give you PvP, no argument there.  But PvE is about much more than gear.  I can make up a 15% DPS deficit with sparkling personality.
---
Yup. It was particularly frustrating to see the horde going up even though alliance was still at 24 man.
---
&gt;I am not subbed right now, I never played classic more then ~5 levels (and dont plan to, I already experienced everything in vanilla). So I do not actually care
---
Then why bother posting?
---
Firemaw is a very solid server in my opinion. It's about 60/40 H/A but certainly doesn't feel like it. Before battlegrounds came out alliance were practically always in control of Blackrock Mountain or Dire Maul, often both. It has a healthy raiding scene on horde, and probably on alliance as well, as one of the top guilds, Progress, are alliance on Firemaw. It has a relatively large population with queues ranging from 30-90 minutes during primetime which is about 19-23 server time.
---
Yikes.
---
You say this as if people aren't taking these options. Play differently or don't play? Gee, never thought of that!
---
Pretty sure people just favor horde because they're cooler, even in Vanilla Horde outnumbered Alliance a good deal and back then no one even know about racials.
---
&gt;Warsong Gulch vendors will only sell items from their original list of consumables (and one tabard) for now.

Whatever could happen when you give players a free way to kick people and force them to have a 15min deserter, although that gets abused on retail sometimes
---
Oh.  Another one of these posts.
---
God this sub sucks.
---
Last ban wave a week ago? Just saw a bot in AV. Is it really worth waiting over a month or 2 to do a wave just to have the bots be back within a few days or week?
---
The cave in hillsbrad?
---
It doesn't matter what Blizzard's intentions are if it can be abused in another way.
---
Let's say a fighting game company creates a new character that has a special move that sets your enemy to 25% health at the start of the game. This is designed for people who aren't very good at the game to have a chance against their more experienced friends.
---
Obviously anyone who plays this game competitively will use this at the start of the match every single time, but does that make it their fault for using it or the game developer's fault for implementing a shitty design and expecting people to play by their rules?
---
I second nugenergy
---
I kill both the Tauren boss and Plugger consistently and I'm averaging about 20g every ~20mins on good runs. The problem is the amount of resists you get in a run really chunks out your time.
---
Has anyone checked if spell hit gear affects pick pocket resist rates?
---
Maybe fire nova totem?
---
I’m having fun getting rep for rewards. Gonna keep doing it since I’m having fun.
---
None. Just follow the herd and you'll get the hang of it within an hour.
---
3 hours for 50 clams is a snail's pace; 2.8 minutes per kill (including 80% clam drop chance). How are you killing stuff?
---
Lol "I dont play this game but I really feel the need to bitch about it on their reddit sub."
---
The map design (terrain, fort placement, etc.) favors Alliance when rushing the enemy boss (which is the "best"/most common strategy to win.) I can't explain how exactly, but that's the standard explanation.
---
*Assuages downvoted with Windfury totem bot.*
---
Omg ROFL 🤣🤣🤣
---
If a game isn't fun for you, don't play it. Clearly enough people are having fun the way it is now.
---
Alliance outnumbered horde in vanilla. It changed during BC and onwards.
---
I mean....I'm one of the top healers in my guild as a druid...maybe that says something about the other healers, idk, but druid seems just fine to me. I also came in at #1 heals on one of our early Rag fights, AND tanked him for the last 30 seconds of the fight after our other tanks went down at the end. I'm loving the hell out of the class and haven't regretted my decision for a moment. Battlegrounds has made it even more fun. 
---
But I'm also fine if everyone continues to meme about us being shit cuz it means I can continue to have no competition.
---
What exactly is the purpose of this inane nitpicking? 
---
Just like being a dick? 
---
Have ego issues and need to find any opportunity to "win" an argument to make yourself feel better? 
---
What is it?
---
What's the average queue time for Alterac Valley and WSG for Alliance at server peak time (In EU realms)? Just curious.
---
Plot twist: rogues can stealth.
---
I wouldn't care if this was in the game if Blizzard actually punished people doing this. But it's straight up not happening.
---
Comparing laws in the real world with actual punishment to abusing Blizzard's shit design is completely stupid.
---
I played on TBC when it wasn’t a zerg, and both sides start the tower caps and start capping the graveyard closest to the opposing teams captain. Once that graveyard is capped they start the captain battle, while the other team is trying to wipe them and recap the towers.
---
Once the captains are down you rush further down/up the map and capture the next closest graveyards and recap any towers that changed back, and once all towers are capped you go into the enemy base and have the boss battle while the other team tries to wipe you.
---
Most of the time this takes about 30 minutes, though if you get a good turtle going it could last an hour.
---
That’s also why AV rewards such good honor, because they expect you to be playing for about an hour, so they reward you with increased honor to compensate for the amount of time you spend in the BG.
---
So people who do these stupid seven minute matches are basically cheating the system like crazy, yet think they’re being “efficient” by gaming the system this way. It’s pathetic.
---
The game is fine how it is, lots of serious alliance raiding guilds at the top of content and racials don't matter when everyone's farming honor in AV with minimum PvP interaction.
---
Look up skarm, he's a private server player and has made in-depth guides etc.
---
Blizzard will be forced to patch at this rate
---
Or don't play if it's not fun. A vocal minority on the forums just like to whine apparently

Horde are actually killing tower bosses on the way up, while alliance is zerging and ignoring everything. So allies are winning more, but horde have been ending up with more honor.
---
Did you ever figure out a solution to this?
---
It was
---
Duo runs should be alot faster
---
This is so goddamn wholesome. It warms my otherwise frozen heart.
---
You guys are awesome. As much as WoW and other games churn out some of the most lowlife scumbags on the face of the planet, it also fosters some wonderful relationship between people that have the potential to last a lifetime and genuinely add to others' happiness and fulfillment in life.
---
Thank you for doing this for your guildie. You guys are really kind.
---
I've enjoyed the community. It's a 98% positive experience.  I'm also not a deluded player who rolled PvP expecting P2 to be mellow, nah, it was amazing in all the worst and best ways.  AV has almost alway sbeen a poor experience, especially when you can't group for it.  Meh, how is this not exactly what everyone expected?  It's a great reminder to what is better than retail, it's still the same issue when you get thousands of people with different personality types together, not everyone gets along.
---
Just have your hunter detect humanoid or detect beast? This is a strategy
---
I specced ele/resto this week for AV and I may never go back to full resto
---
Note the tasteful bush, these environmental artists have an eye for landscaping
---
Give me that sweet sweet AFK rep.
---
Thanks for all the effort.
---
Because classic is full of toxic try-hard min/max that are already kicking people from AV that arent in their guild.
---
Now imagine getting sapped on your run to take a forward GY then get jumped 30s later by a passing group, respawning back at your base camp, and MAYBE due to a zero party again.
---
3min into AV some elitist assholes watching numbers are going to call for a mass report on "player x" for having near-zero dmg/heal and then you get removed and have a 15min deserter debuff.
---
I used to mass mail piles upon piles of salt to one of my guild's officers in legion, dude hated gnomes so we'd send him the little christmas elf battle pet things, i alternated between the disgusting oozeling/one of the imps as my pet using his IRL name, god damn i miss those clowns.
---
I said I was ok with people doing stuff like that....did you even read?
---
Its not that BIS wasn't a thing. People still knew what was good. Stuff like Arcanite Reaper, slow attack daggers (before weapon speed was normalized) people still sought to get. Its just that not playing the optimal way didn't make you an outcast. I remember dpsing MC as a shaman with TuF and no one caring. Stuff like that. It was just more of a chill environment. I think that's the feeling people are trying to recapture.
---
No i mean all its going to be IS premades for bg's
---
Pugs will all go AV as ... its more honor per hour solo for them ALWAYS
---
Premades will go to wsg and AB simply to stomp people and get a break from the AV grind
---
(on holidays it will shift towards w/e BG is on holiday)
---
Im just predicting here, but when solo AV is the absolute best way to get honor
---
Solo players will go there.... leaving only premades behind in wsg/AB .... making them less "doable" for small groups... and queues may skyrocket
---
I remember watching a video of his back in Vanilla!  His crits are nuts! 
---
Found it:  https://youtu.be/nu3gBXMcD10
---
I wish that were the case for my guilds raids. 7 mcs n 15+ onys and im still only at 3 pieces... Our warriors on the other hand are all almost full t1. Even the dps wars
---
who... the... f\*ck... cares?
---
Same! I top boss fights every other raid usually (Golemagg, Ragnaros when I'm tank healing) with many more in the top 3. I feel the class is underrated, and I also get the variety that comes with a hybrid. We're sub 2hr clearing MC an Ony without even going tryhard mode so the real test will be BWL+. Really looking forward to it though!
---
I did Google feral tank vs fury prot and saw his video pop up, not able to watch it at the moment though. I'll give it a watch whenever I have time though. One thing that does seem to favor warriors though, is that in the situation where you do drop threat, you're able to taunt/mocking blow/challenging shout
---
There's a bunch already out there.
---
Curious as to how long until they're detected/banned, if at all.
---
Not even funny to joke about. Go rethink your pitiful life.
---
Don't forget to sneak a 1k lightning bolt in there before the chain lightning
---
Yes, it's SLIGHTLY relevant but more people will just mean it will be easier, the pool of players will be bigger so the brackets will also be bigger...
---
My guild in vanilla ran av for a weekend to get us all exalted. I can't remember the name of the add on we used but allowed us to queue together. 
---
We also farmed azshara for mats constantly and cleared MC and ony and later AQ and bwl on reset days.
---
We got 4 different people Grand Marshal. It was a farm fest 15 years ago too, we had just as much fun as I'm having today with my new guild
---
You can be a dedicated wow player, who rolled on the original highest pop oce server and NOT be a scumbag. Dont generalise.
---
Because Ragnaros is 1 boss in the raid.
---
If you havent noticed the hardcoreness of classic and didnt see this coming than shame on you. 
---
It's likely only ever going to be av. The good news is once people get r14 they will stop and open the door to others who will get r14 and so on. So there is hope but it will probably be further down the road. 
---
This is why I always preach for arenas since it is actually competitive and doesnt require so much time.
---
I like your style my dude.
---
If u type u will be kicked from bg u filthy casual
---
[Holy Smite/Heals](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/0542001305001-10505103032005-5) works nearly optimally for raiding while also allowing much smoother solo grinds.
---
im OK with the PvE elements as you are sort of racing in that sense. For example in the DOTA style games there is both PvE and PvP and the PvE is super important (boss buffs, gold from camps etc). So the mere inclusion of PvE in a PvP game mode isnt inherently bad
---
Why would it flip? 
---
AV is 15,000ish honor per hour
---
WSG is around 5000-6000 per hour if your min-maxing the graveyard kills
---
After people are done with AV.... (the wsg rewards wont be fully in until AB... wrists and pants are missing apparently) 
---
they are just gonna keep doing AV if they want max honor per week for their time..
---
First comment you replied to is an old af troll used to get people to leave the games. Typing "/afk" will have you leave the game instantly. So yeah that's why you seem to have been downvoted and no one actually engaging in why you think it's a shit solution.
---
How dense are you? That's the whole point of my post, that I'm not playing. Sorry that you accidentally saw some negative thoughts from someone who has played WoW off and on for 15 years.
---
Ah. I must have missed that. 
---
So is it a wasted effort trying to climb rank under level 60?
---
Get a guildie for mage water. Or most BG huds have mage giving out water/food. Usually for free if you're lucky
---
I'm sorry, are you suggesting dpsing as elemental in AQ40 is viable? The NR values in that dungeon are reallly high and if you spend all of your stat budget on spell pen and hit you're going to have no actual spell damage.
---
If warriors, rogues, mages, and locks aren't blowing ele shamans out of the water in AQ40 they're either in prebis or just bad.
---
&gt;alliance fail the boss rush  
---
&gt;~~alliance then decide to turtle~~ horde force a turtle
---
FTFY
---
Looks cool right??
---
Cause farming herbs then rolling on loot is win win.
---
I have been kicked AFK out of AV TWICE before anyone has even mounted out of the starting gate.
---
That makes sense. Personally, I’m fine with it since I don’t really care for pvp. I just want my bis ring and rank 3 for a discount on my 60 mount. I could see that being annoying for horde in the same position though.
---
faerie fire
---
You must not be any good at hide and seek
---
Like I said, I'm not really going to get into it.
---
Average player age is like 28 iirc
---
Swiggity swooty!
---
I think it is more about the alliance you kill along the way.
---
Because it is a great balance of skill + time commitment rewarding your gameplay.  You get what you put in in most cases, save drop chances and other RNG shit, but it is much worse on retail because the systems are so cluttered and uninteresting.   The onyxia quest matters because it awards gear and etc along the way, multiple runs of UBRS to gear up, the Warfront chain only matters because it unlocks other systems that you have to grind.  Just different fundamental concepts at this point and people are too savvy not to see ActiBlizz's manipulation of it's retail players.
---
Since the raids are 80% warriors that don't haev healing spells, thats probably the reason.
---
**Hm... looks like he stealthed his text.**
---
Lfg or trade chat.
---
Druids aren't shit tier but they're definitely the bottom of the 4 healers when it comes to healing in Classic.
---
I also want to go for rank10. But now that xmas is near and all that stuff, and the bg hype is real, I guess I can let it sit for a few more weeks before actually trying it, cause SO many people will left it behind when they see " ohhh fuck I need to do this EVERY week?"
---
So yeah give it a month or so and it will be easier compared to right now!
---
Personally I try to stay on any healer I see until they're oom or dead then switch off. Seems to win most group fights for me but I might be doing it wrong.
---
Anyone knows what addon is he using to have the raid's frames on the left as a colum?
---
I see you've discovered that different people have different preferences when it comes to gaming.
---
Yes that's literally what I'm saying, bc has a lot more thought put into outlands world design, raids/bosses and PVP talents and gear. Comparing a well thought out xpac with the original base version of the game and saying "wow this base version has no content" isn't a stunning brilliant remark.
---
Back in BC we lost AV constantly because half the horde was afk.    It isnt really that different.
---
I love everything about this
---
Ferals don't have the extra abilities but they also don't get ragestarved. Usually taunt and two mauls get you the aggro back.
---
Why don’t you try your servers subreddit?
---
Compared to how many other threads here?
---
exactly! there is 0 downside to the trinket in anyway lol
---
Idk how the guy didn't cry. I cried for him.
---
Vanilla wow was designed to be a casual MMO by the way.
---
Revered after one night...I'll take it.
---
Our ret pally was commonly left out in place of a mage or rogue. Unless they couldn't show up. But he still waited for the chance. So subprime DPS was definitely cared about. Wiping back then was just as shit as now a day and no one wanted to spend hours in a raid they didn't have to.
---
rerolling to this server... which is????
---
horde/alliance? guild name??? 
---
but seriously. thank you for this post.. 
---
but also seriously? pls answer the questions above.
---
Bloodsail buccaneers is great.
---
I get pumped when the dude say that’s a badass fucking laptop dude.
---
Anyone know what build it is? Trying to get one for myself so I can play in the couch and in bed lol
---
On themselves they'll def use Cure poison.
---
Druids tend to ignore others though when it comes to helping them out :P
---
So this rogue is gonna stay in stealth for 100% of the dungeon? Yeah no.
---
I’m the opposite, I like the setup of the maps and quest logs of retail over classic. i don’t need it pointing on a map where to go, but just how it lists them. But that could be because i played from vanilla through to BFA, so i was around as it evolved and am accustomed to it, then hit classics very minimal presentation.
---
Priests seem to rarely do an offensive dispell... maybe because most of them are heal and don't focus on the enemy.
---
&gt; WSG is so dumb lol. It amazes me how many people run it all day long. To each their own. AV is super fun though.
---
Hi, /u/travisbyrdjr
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e9svcm/druid_pro_tip_innervate_those_mages_that_are/). 
---
The real benefit of retadins is how they buff the crap out of smite priests. Super powerful until oom shortly after lol.
---
In general horde gets 3k+ honor per AV by default unless the whole PUG is mentally challlenged. Alliance risks losing if they get honor, so they still go straight to the general. If you want win and get more honor as alliance (getting you ahead in honor race), you better need a premade so you act like a dick.
---
Yeah, there are a handful of talents in Classic that are very poorly worded. The warrior talent "Anger Management" says it reduces out of combat rage decay. But what it actually does is generate 1 rage every 3 seconds, even in combat.
---
I'm horde on benediction and haven't experienced any of the things OP talks about in his post either.  I've made a bunch of fantastic memories with my fellow horde who for the most part all seem to be perfectly pleasant individuals.  I can count on one hand the number of bad dungeon experiences I've had due to "asshats".  In fact, the vast majority of my bad experiences has been getting corpse camped by alliance that outnumber me 4:1 at least.  
---
There's min/maxing neckbeards on both sides that were corpse camping honor farming in phase 2, its just how the game was designed.
---
Lmao this is my favourite comment. I love how people are dumb enough to take this bait.
---
Whats up with these mages I see on pvp with like 4k health. Do they just stack stam or what?
---
I don't run so good either so they captured the flag.
---
Stuff we put up with or stuff we love?
---
I'm sure there is a break even point but considering your average priest has ~5.5k mana unbuffed the total increase in mana is only going to amount to ~550, which is an extra cast or two depending on the spell.  You'd have to Compare those two casts to the amount of bonus healing over the entire fight to determine if it was worth it.
---
You are wrong, but just keep on thinking that. You take the shitty 56 and deal with that and I'll just be over here having a better time.
---
It does but I don’t know if I’d be like, half as effective in raids to be just a little more effective in PvP, you know?
---
Strange, my guild has an abundance of healers as well in MC, but I chalk that up to having 3-4 holy pallies. What do shamans usually do in raids? Ele dps or resto healing?
---
Also, what does this technically BiS set look like? Is it just cloth +healing pieces(such as the baron rivendare chest) over T1 gear?
---
Combustion shatter. Crits from range, crits in your face!
---
Druids are awesome though. Probably my 3rd favorite class.
---
Im almost at lvl 60 on my pvp server... im so tempted to transfer it when transfers come out. I know there are loads of players on the current PVE servers complaining about transfers ruining their experience. But man i have to get away from all of this mindless gamking, minmax attitude people kicking others out of parties because they found a higher level player. I dont understand how people can be wo horrible to others..
---
Dude you are such an idiot
---
He got mugged and was thankful he had his guns to protect him
---
To use the exact same game as an example, my FoNV playthoughs have gotten FAR less tryhard the farther I get away from my first playthrough. Getting to know FoNV and its systems (same goes for WoW here) has made me much less sweaty in trying to get every edge possible, because I know I don't need them, and theres fun to be had without them.
---
At least send Broken Tooth to rough em up
---
Dude with a dead mom here, the dead mom jokes are funny and you need to get the stick out of your ass.
---
I’ll have to take a look at this! I hate crippling poison...
---
Good idea! I don't know whether it's harder on mobile but I've tried searching and I can't find it
---
2-8 seconds so far.
---
That's the greatest WoW video I've ever seen.  The madman.
---
Are you running somthing like https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#bxzGsbbZf0tZVMGpcz tri spec 
---
Or disc/shadow like https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#bxzGsGioZbZVMGpcz
---
You might need to update it, we just had a patch drop and a lot of adons require an update to work properly
---
It's called Auc, I haven't seen it on curse. A guildy just dropped me the files. 
---
The item rack bug might be because you were on combat. If it tell it to switch items while in combat, it waits for you to drop before changing.
---
That's about right - except I don't even have the partial reservation that he does at certain moments. I am 100% full bloodlust. :)
---
I miss Stuart Scott and the days when ESPN actually had funny people with personality.
---
I was rushing Drek (with 100% mount, mithril spurs and carrot mind you) as everyone on the alliance usually do and someone just said "Report naylo44" and I got insta kicked.
---
No reason for that, except that maybe I have an interesting name? Happened twice yesterday. My advice is don't talk in /raid
---
I just cancelled my sub. 
---
I had a blast leveling to 60 and doing all the dungeons. Did MC and ony a few times. 
---
I was pretty stoked for BGs to drop but I don’t want to spend the time grinding the gear out. It’s definitely not what I remember from back in the days. I think I’ve been looking at it through rose tinted glasses a little too hard.
---
As much as it pains me to say it, that’s where retail shines. I just don’t have the time to sink in to it to compete with people who grind BGs 7-8 hours a day.
---
Now that honor is massively inflated, my measly 3-4 BGs a night is not going to bring me any closer to getting ranked high enough for gear.
---
I've tried looking for it but I can't find it :(
---
Buff but no ice barrier, by the time you get to where you need to fight, you have 60% or so mana at worst (unless you are graveyard farmed).
---
Lol yeah im watching it and im like FUCK YEAH MAN
---
it was exactly the opposite because everyone wanted to play the beautiful races. it changed during bc when they gave horde a beautiful race (belf) and when the imbalance started to be known.
---
Yeah, it basically means “facts I don’t want to hear and completely conflict with my worldview.”
---
Nope. Not funny.
---
His not GM so doubt
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Honor_System
---
has science gone too far
---
lmao then they bad at pvp. As a hunter, I never switch off the healer. Hell as any class I never switch off the healer. You playing against scrubs
---
I think I was on the losing end of that one :/
---
We were up 2-0 and lost.
---
People had thicker skin 15 year ago.
---
I would prefer this stuff off of the subreddit.
---
It's more I don't know why people expect it to be different now a day than it was back then. It was the people you played with that made the game what it was back then
---
People just need to find those same people that have the same mentality as back then if they want to recreate it. 
---
I don't think the bitching online that people are doing complaining to blizzard to fix something that's not broken is the way to do it. People gotta find their tribe that fits, can't force blizz to change it.
---
Yeah you'd have to be very set in your guild for them to be willing to give you that role for sure.
---
Twink item deposits are a few silver normally.. they could do 48 hour posts for a year and still make money off their listed prices.
---
because the salt about the server imbalance got so strong when they added world pvp that it spilled over in other subreddits.
---
I'm a cookie cutter boomkin spec'd into Nature's Grasp, Insect Swarm, Improved Thorns, and Improved Mark. While I planned to heal, the abundance of healers has had me DPS half the time. I'm a buffbot, enjoy the class, and haven't been rejected from groups or my guild despite my spec. In fact, I alternate between heals and boomy for MC and Ony depending on the group's needs. Being flexible is nice.
---
&gt;Except warriors, they are always good.
---
Except when they're leveling.
---
Why you put zero dramatic pauses on your text u/aDramaticPause ?
---
Yeah I remember playing cs 1.5 and 1.6 on weird resolutions that didn't fit your monitor to get bigger hotboxes for the head. People have always been doing this it has just gotten worse over time. So an mmo which really isn't designed with competition in mind it changes the way the game is played.
---
How is a first time player blindly following a bis list they found not a minmaxer?
---
I drop posion cleaning totem as soon as I see any rogue or hunter! Fuk boiz!!
---
Anal, Lana
---
That’s what I did. For instance, RFD leather shoulders for rogue/hunter/shaman. I carried a group on my 60 through the dungeon. When we got to the abomination boss, switched to my twink, helped kill boss, needed shoulders, and then switched back to my 60 to clear the rest of the dungeon for the group.
---
IMO bartender is better
---
Man you haven't experienced 4 hour mcs every week wiping on rag sometimes.
---
Good luck getting to r14 LOL
---
You can use the ignore list. You have the tools to decide what you can or cannot see, so use them, instead of expecting Blizzard to do it for you.
---
This whole argument is being overthought. It's a natural tendency to minmax, we all want to get the most out of our time invested and every system in wow caters to that, from leveling to pve gear ranks(.05 -&gt; t1 -&gt; t2) to pvp gear ranks(literal pvp rank and what you can buy at that rank).
---
At the same time, when you have the best gear and everything is figured out, there just isn't much enjoyment to be had because the outcome is all but expected. You need to leave some space for these 'unexpected outcomes', and that means closing that guide and just figuring out a vague quest, or equipping a piece of gear you're not sure is "bis", but gives you nice stats anyway.
---
The DC you eventually get is instant and doesn't have a 20 second logout, that being said this is an AMAZING macro so thank you!! :D
---
Yeah but did you see the jump? That shit was crazy.
---
I'm prot/holy as a paly. I'm having so much fun tanking dungeons.
---
Paly tanking ain't a meme guys, especially for Scholo/Strat, I can usually do more DPS than most non-AOE DPS. (Drinking after every 2 pulls is a pita though, I won't lie)
---
I never woulda thought that AVs were going to be less than 15 minutes and earn so much honor. I couldn't have foreseen this :\\ 
---
Hardcore premading? sure. But this is a different beast.
---
you should read more closely, I said I experienced everything in vanilla, which means many many years ago.
---
Yeah, he made a video of just him speaking his version of the truth, nothing else. I totally believe him now.
---
the day tbc drops.
---
That's a fair question. I stopped giving too much of a fuck at some point and I'm getting away with pretty much raid logging for now. I'll gquit if this becomes a problem again
---
So because I displayed my own preference, without giving any inclination as to how I feel about the other, makes me a whatever-the-fuck-just-typed?
---
*facepalm*
---
I enjoy speed running raids. I enjoy the challenge and satisfaction of spending inhuman hours running a guild capable of competitive speed runs. Don't tell me how to enjoy the game.
---
I know this may be a crazy idea, but some of us have no intention of trying to grind to rank 14 and play the game for fun. AV may be the best honor/hour but is mindlessly boring and I have no intention of ever returning once I finish the rep and hit rank 10. Once you hit you goal rank honor is meaningless, fun/enjoyment/utility derived is what matters  Yes, there will always be a contingent of tryhard players in AV, or wherever is the top honor/hour at the time, but honestly these are the players I am good with not playing with.
---
What, that people don’t realize that the First Amendment protects my right to offend you? Yeah, those people are real dopes.
---
Good stuff. Thanks for the laugh.
---
if you were to make a 40-man raid consisting of only one class, druids would be first by a country fucking mile. The only ones in the region would be pallies but even then you would have nowhere near enough dps for most shit. that would actually be a really funny thing to watch, does anyone know if it’s been done before?
---
cLaSsIc Is BeSt BeCaUsE tHeRe ArE nO wElFaRe EpIcs!
---
Glad you enjoyed it!
---
actually doing the objectives makes a 7 min game a 10 min game. atleast in premades
---
Reasons why Duids are good: No attachments
---
&gt; I am not subbed right now, I never played classic more then ~5 levels  
---
https://i.imgur.com/q7nqBUb.gif?noredirect
---
Do both and everyone wins. Then holy fuck we all have fun.. WAHHHHH??
---
In my experience horde only dominates casual PvP.
---
Alliance stomps organized because Paladins are so damn good at PvP healing.
---
No one cares. Spy accounts/BM accounts are a thing. Good rule of thumb, if makes Blizzard more money, they aren't very motivated to take action on it. Think multiboxers.
---
The worst is warlocks who life taps to keep doing dps then pulls aggro. I can't tell if they need healing until too late sometimes
---
In before removed for cyber bullying.
---
they ARE griefing, stop defending them.
---
regardless of what you want (honor or rep) its better to win (or even lose) fast. I'm tired of horde camping mid ground and games taking forever to finish.
---
i have no interest in engaging you, why do you insist on running after me and using all cc / whatever you have to stop me? what fun do you derive from killing someone that's not even attacking you back?
---
I think you guys are talking about completely different aspects of the game here. OP here was talking about all classes having access to every type of ability in every spec (stun/heal/sprint/gap closer) a like homogenization on an individual basis, you are talking much more meta game I think. Your point makes me think of feeling forced to do dailies in legion and BfA
---
I don't think either are healthy for the game and I think classic is the lesser of 2 evils... idk about the new retail WoW expac though.
---
It's looking like AV is currently the best honor per hour. Better than stomping WSGs. That means WSG is dead. **That is fucked**. If anyone interesting in ranking if forced into soulless braindead solo queue AVs instead of having fun their friends/guild in WSG then something has to change. 
---
AV needs to be nerfed so that being good at WSG is significantly better honor per hour.
---
Ye already checked, the option isn't even there.
---
 Typical american divisive mind.   
---
Lmao we're reaching irony levels that shouldn't even be possible.
---
"welp.. looks like it's an /afk game boys"
---
Good to hear, the rep grind continues then since our raid group has bad rng with 1h weps in MC and Ony. No Vis'Kag, Perdition's, Gutgore and only 1 Brutality blade so far.
---
My 2 man DM:E runs are pretty bad too 38 runs, 3 crystals. No other gems.
---
Yes, you are viewing it one-sidedly. Pathetically so.
---
All I do is spread the word of the emperor's Divinity ;)
---
As long as you are willing to pay out another subscription, Blizzard will happily take it.
---
It's quite useful, really. I have a guildmate who has an 2nd account as alliance. He goes on it to check for big groups of alliance in the world so that we can go kill them wPvP.
---
I liked it best when it seemed the adds and the main boss were all linked. It meant you had to down a few of the towers of your choice at least, then off tank any extra guys while killing the main guy. Now you just pull them out two at a time and kill them then the general. Just relinking them all together would do some to slow down the Zerg meta.
---
&gt; If people want honor then go play warsong.
---
No. AV is better honor than WSG atm. Significantly better. Like, 3k honor per 10 minutes in AV.
---
Anyone who cares about honke is not gonna do wpvp. Wsg spam is easily 20k honor an hour and outdoor farming is like 3-4k an hour at best.
---
I honestly don't totally agree with any BiS list I've seen, but I've been using the Wowhead list. Yes, generally it's a lot of cloth (rivendare chest for sure). The list tends to value raw +healing over any other stat, without making a point of hitting some sort of base intellect or spirit number. The only other stat that seems occasionally prioritized is mp5 on very mp5 heavy items without great alternatives for that slot (i.e. neck).

It would appear, with their definition of stat priority, that many green items should be 'BiS' although they're not included in this list (head, bracers, etc). In fact, if I took this list as gospel in its prioritization of +healing, I would have been better off spending ~80g on most of a full set of green +healing gear and wound up with more +heals than I have even now. My intellect would be in the dumper, but again, this list doesn't seem to care (and you can make the argument that with Rank 4 healing tough prioritization and mana pots, that low mana high +heal is actually most efficient). 
---
So I generally theorycraft my own mix of gear from my gear pool depending on fight length and throughput requirement/heal budget across the raid.
---
uhh, horde is winning most of the AVs in europe
---
Don't forget about the unreasonable number of guild streamers who have a combined audience of 3 views per stream.
---
I wonder if this has all to do with the nature of Classic. Maybe it's inevitable that a closed 15 y old game that has been theorycrafted to death disproportionately attracts people whose idea of fun is bean counting.
---
Listening to the 5% of people who cry that systems aren't perfect is how we ended up with retail.
---
Call it nochanges. Call it stop fucking with the game. Call it whatever you want, we don't want classic to turn into BFA lite.
---
dude... what? you're upset that other people putting more effort in to the game are being rewarded for said efforts?
---
Av til exaulted than wsg
---
racials are fine
---
the problem is horde get all the good ones
---
It's funny because we're making fun of an asshole
---
Hate speech isn’t real.
---
Mines not
---
So now the next time he dies mid-pull and wants a battle rez you can just point and laugh while telling him your not good enough to perform that action.
---
g'night terribad. go to retail.
---
I'd agree than 30-40 min games are where I'd ideally like the BG to be. It's enough time for objectives to matter, to have some actual PvP, to summon a boss to break a stalemate. It's not so long that it's a horrible grind.
---
Nah we arent BoK, just as others said, some randoms.
---
I found out that the easiest way to deal with them is to mind controll them. A lot of healers dont have the trinket yet, and if their bubble is on cd... well.. and if it's not, they just used it.
---
Do people realize millennials are at the youngest 23?
---
Just make it like 3 minutes. By that time, any “friends” that join aren’t going to be able to catch up and help the Zerg. If you’re booting people who are running with you to the boss, you’re seriously hurting your chances of a win.
---
No it's correct, you just gotta find better players to play with. That's not on blizz.
---
You guys are beautiful people. :,)
---
Yeah that makes a lot of sense, that's what I thought mostly too tbh
---
Haha you actually sound just like a retail player.
---
Took 140 runs to get my TS shoulders. 150+ total runs and still have yet to see a MH..
---
I got shit on by several dudes from Hydraxian Waterlords today, sorry to burst your bubble.
---
need the 15 i believe
---
You would lose a ton of honor I guess.  Lol
---
ok karen
---
I've run MC twice and have come out with 4 pieces of Cenarion + Wristguards of Stability
---
Four hour raids go by extremely fast. I’ve been in Raids, like our first Karazhan full clear, where we started at 6pm server time and didn’t finally down Prince Malchezaar until 4am. This was after people had called in sick or ditched their classes for the next day, lol.
---
But we got him, even in our guild of people with busy schedules. The crazy part is it didn’t feel like ten hours. Thankfully we got Karazhan on farm within a couple months and four hours was a long raid instead of the first few bosses.
---
Are you spamming Starfire? I ran some numbers the other day, and found that Wrath spam can do  92% of an equal mage’s Frostbolt spam, at about 20% higher MpS than Frostbolt.
---
Starfire spam is about the same MpS as Frostbolt, but it’s only 88% the DpS. Starfire outperforms Wrath’s DpS at 30% or more crit.
---
Starfire doesn’t outpform Wrath at 0% crit until Rank 7 in AQ.
---
Granted, this is theoretical, but you might see a mild improvement if you take Improved Wrath, skip Improved Starfire and Nature’s Grace, and spam Wrath instead.
---
Take a pet with you to Blasted lands and auto shot those guys that can't be killed without a quest item in Dreadmaul hold.  Mend pet when they get low.  Should be easy to get skill up to 290+ and then you can top off in dungeons or whatever.
---
I do this too. I enter the BG as a resto Druid planning to heal and find myself running around in bear form trying to bash or charge everything.
---
galv is not pointless at all though, 1-2 mages or a hunter trap slow the horde mid rush, so alliance gets to galv firsts. easy rep
---
Hardcore premading for rank 14 would be worse honestly. It would certainly take longer than this to rank.
---
And you thought wrong lol. You never played vanilla did you? If you did and you saw the version of av they were releasing than this would be easy to see coming. 
---
Who cares about honor rank anyways. It doesnt prove anything other than you have no life. Never has made a statement about skill. 
---
That was arena.
---
Glad you are enjoying your first experience! I hope I could have that feeling too. But I still love this game right now. Tauren Druid also! Sounds like you're doing well with your Druid. Glad to see another who doesn't downsize this class simply because it (may) take more patience to learn and play well.
---
It's true.
---
Every realm has its own pulse.
---
It's always sunny in Philadelphia reference, really funny show!
---
Agreed. As a lifelong healer as well, I paid attention to healing parses for a moment in Classic just to see if I was approaching the class somewhat correctly, as I never raided in Vanilla. That's the big issue with our raid, we're clearing so quickly and smoothly that no one would care even if the parses meant something.
---
Beautiful
---
Sounds just like my experience with Classic. I’ve never really played WoW at all and am still leveling but the funny thing is that of all my friends who have been 60 for months, I’m the only one still playing because I’m having fun still while they blew through all the content and said they’re bored and unsubscribed. 
---
I’m playing by myself because I don’t have anyone to level with but it’s still fun, though I bet it would be a lot better with friends.
---
I literally have not tried to get in yet for this sole purpose. I love AV, and in retail it was my fav BG. you know..the 'right after patch, everyone is underpowered so we actually have to do everything' AV. hopefully they all go away and the fun shit starts. Ive always wanted to do legit AV
---
let me plau
---
Druids are good later when saving mana actually matters and you cant spam flash heal on priests.
---
Shitty DPS means your Enhancement Tank can actually hold aggro.
---
Big brain time
---
Yes, I bet it happens for the horde but the anecdotal ratio is abysmal.
---
misleading name; I was thinking it would be cool to pop and protect from blind and other rogue poisons but it looks like it just cures poisons, still cool though
---
I've been playing as a resto druid for about a month doing raids and countless dungeons. In all honesty the only thing I am lacking over other healers is the ability to rez people (other than b-rez). Im frequently in the top 3 for overall healing during most pulls. A druid that knows how to play their class can compete on the same field as other classes. I love the diversity they bring to the table and so far have had a blast playing one!
---
The fact that it's just one rambling run-on sentence, following his post insulting OP's intelligence and using ur, is amazing.
---
You want to know how much you can afk, don’t you?
---
You are the second person I have seen suggest this and I am interested. All the theorycrafting simply suggests spamming starfire. I have build my entire gear set around it, but would swap for improvement if i was accurate. Does anyone have any logs showing this?
---
You can never “quit.” I’ve been on and off the wagon since Burning Crusade, lol.
---
Like it doesn't work at all now, or it's less accurate or something?
---
If you don't understand the joke, don't worry. It's some shitty obscure anime reference.
---
Genius, sir! Help you help me moment
---
That’s the exact same feeling I had, when I started playing Wow. I remember exploring new zones, shit was fantastic! I’m glad you enjoy the game!
---
I think it's the in-between crowd that were the most vocal: the people who were just serious enough to be 60/on the verge of hitting 60, but who weren't hardcore enough to keep up with what's necessary to truly stay on top. Those are the people feeling "steamrolled" by the hardcore players that are out there camping BRM/Winterspring/DM 16+ hours a day to rank up in the honor system.
---
Anyone crying about “hate speech” should be ignored. What’s the likely hood that he has his pronouns in his bio?
---
Thinking about leveling my druid more. How are they at gold farming, excluding professions? Can they solo any instances for good vendor/AH gold, or are they acceptable tanks for reserving strat live righteous orbs?
---
I'd join it
---
Same. I feel for y'all on Faerlina. By far the most obnoxious I've seen.
---
Me: I'm sad I can't spend 4 hours in UBRS cause family.
---
Also me: I'm sad I can't spend 4 hours in AV cause it doesnt last long enough.
---
Horde lose 80% of AV min. It was like that in vanilla and it’s worse now.
---
I used Sage's guide. Iirc it either came with the add-on or was downloaded separately with the add-on through the Twitch app. It's pretty straightforward if you use the Twitch app, just add the main add-on and then whichever specific guide you want. You select which guide and which section you want to be active from the interface options menu
---
It's not This Community. Everyone has the power to create or bring this community anyway they go irl and in games, even if the games are usually toxic. Spread the love.
---
But you will be surprised when they come out in only 7 months 😳
---
I changed faction and class from vanilla — it was definitely different and interesting for a while. Then I decided it was taking too long and got questie + instant quest text. Traded novelty for efficiency.
---
Except this would happen less if it wasn’t 1.12 AV
---
this process can be repeated for maximum rank gains with minimal effort
---
I came back to say I told you so. After announcement, 20g essence of water down to 14g. After ele invasion released, down to 12g. The source? Simple economics of supply and demand. Supply up with content released, and demand dropping as people getting their enchants and crafts.
---
Is that my apartment? Where is this? I'm in Ohio
---
How would 2 levels correct scaling? Genuine question.
---
Sure am gooch boy.
---
Yep. Nothing like "hardcore" gamers ability to completely sap all of the fun and enjoyment out of games by obsessing over efficiency, skipping 90% of the content then complaining that there is nothing to do and that they are bored.
---
Why don’t you prove it then?
---
...because it's a battleground. We're kinda supposed to try to stop you guys.
---
I think also that because you don't see enemy buffs the same in classic and it requires visual/audio queues. Priests should always be smart enough to purge off other priests/mages bubble but most other buffs require thought!
---
enjoy it haha! i have 6/8 t1 and t2 pants, and the other druid in our group has the same but t2 helm. tier is honestly pretty good even if the classic bis list for druids doesn't think so. it's way easier than finding tanks for the dungeons you need to grind the few huge upgrades that do exist, and the additional int/stam/spirit/mp5 makes healing feel pretty low stress, especially if your raid is clearing well and/or you're innervating yourself. it's also solid/preferred for PvP because of the stam/leather.
---
U can, if u are stunned and silenced at the same time it ignores the silence
---
Is this sincere? I disagree and so do the people I've spoken to about this in person. For me, games are about trails and triumphs. The triumph cannot exist without a trial to overcome. I'm not saying every part of Classic adheres to this concept perfectly but it is better here than in retail. The suffering highlights the enjoyment. 
---
As far as something wrong with our brains. I used to agree with you. Winning was the only goal and how I did it or how difficult it was didn't matter. If it was easy, great, if I couldn't lose, better, if it was too hard, cheat. I grew out of that when I was 10 or 11.
---
didnt read
---
Reviewed by a live person is fine. But I don’t understand why it has to be more than once? Ban enough people who do shitty things like this and people will stop doing it.
---
Pretty sure nobody is forcing you to be a Ret Paladin or play with a Ret Paladin.
---
Why? Are you bad?
---
To piggy-back off this post; I had a neat experience last night with a quest that started in Uldaman. 
---
After you defeat the final boss, Archaedus, there is a room that opens up with loot, and these separate Uldaman discs that you can interact with then grab as an item after reading through some lore. This starts a quest chain that lead me to the Uldum gates (which are closed of course) in Tanaris, then going back to IF with the NPC telling me there is nothing more to be done here as we seem to have hit a dead end.
---
Maybe back in the day this quest would've had an unsatisfactory ending; but with hindsight I was really surprised and impressed that they laid the ground work for a zone that wouldn't be fully realized for another 3 expansions/6 years. Not to mention all the Titan related lore that wouldn't really be explored again until WOTLK (by my memory).
---
An asshole that cries when he doesn't get his way
---
I'm quite enjoying Classic so far. Maybe that's because I'm playing extremely infrequently and don't really have a chance to witness all the stuff people complain about in here. 
---
But as it turns out, generally spoken it seems to me JAB wasn't that wrong.
---
Knowing the entire concept of how AV runs wouldnt do much against leashed marshalls and a buffed general
---
Yah sure you can rush to the gen still, but without BWL equal gear most tanks couldnt pull without being killed in a few seconds
---
that was pre 1.8 AV tho......
---
We feel the same way about you.
---
If you're in an AV for more than 15 minutes, both teams lost. They would both be better off AFK'ing and letting the enemy team push.
---
Haha I can imagine, yeah. Wouldn't be surprised if I ended up doing something similar out of boredom. I'd mostly just RP the shit out of it though, since it's a RP-PvP realm anyway.
---
Why would you ever join a battleground and not expect to pvp? Alliance seem to complain so much. It's almost like it's all you guys do lol.
---
It feels different because it's a different game.  Different talents, nerfed bosses, easy mode itemization.  
---
Community didn't ruin av, the devs did, this version of AV can be finished quickly, that's on the devs for nerfing the crap out of the mobs over time.  Imagine if they used a version of AV that REQUIRED you to do the objectives.
---
&gt;Most rank 14 players are very, very good
---
i guess you mean "were" and no, they were not lmao
---
What class are you? Witchblade or Energetic Rod with the AV OH is significantly better than rod of the ogre magi.
---
Sometimes they turn into a turtle.
---
Did OP use any of those qualifiers? No, they just said BiS.
---
They get more honor because they know they can't win the zerg race. Instead of going for the BG win they fight bosses and towers for as much honor as possible before the allies win. That's how I understand it at least
---
**Alterac valley group who does objectives.**
---
I got into one group that did this today, It was nice. Any idea on how to meta joining long running AV-games?

I'm waiting for the "OK Boomer" reply even though I'm a millennial.

Still pretty close.

Simple answer to those kind of behaviors : Reset all their honor [Mr.GM](https://Mr.GM).

Maybe they'll learn.
---
Yes.

And no.  
---
Such things as Hope. Thinking that some greedy money grubber at ActivisionBlizzard HQ sees the potential on making good money due to the success of WoW classic, and the high demand of classic servers before Classic was released. That people wanted the OLD WOW, not retail corrupted azeroth.
---
Classic is my first time playing alliance; I played p much only undead from 2009 onwards. This time I picked gnome because escape artist seemed p damn good (+ I kinda like gnomes).
---
Your faction means nothing about the type of person you are. It’s true that much of the time it’s the alliance who complain (on this subreddit). But this is classic wow subreddit and it’s riddled with crybabies.
---
Some people have checked out of reality and completely lost their minds. I’m seeing 18-19 greens, not even BiS, going for hundreds of gold.
---
OK to further your analogy and adapt it to how I view the conversation.
---
So we're playing football, first to 3 goals. I remember playing football. It was fun. There were tactics, tackling, passing, countering the opponents strategy. Sometimes you get 3 goals, sometimes the opposition did. But either way it was fun to play.
---
You go away for a while and people figure that hey, we just want to win 1000 games of football as fast as possible. Why don't we just ignore each other and just all crowd round the ball and rush past each other. Sure whoever starts with the ball will get to 3 first, but now football takes like 1 minute a game. Not 60 minutes when we played against each other.
---
You come back and see, hey there's a new football field. I remember playing football. It was fun.
---
You join a group and see them just running the ball past each other, no attempt to tackle, no passing. Just 3 immediate goals and next game.
---
That's what AV is. I want to play the game. But everyone else is refusing. This is dumb.
---
You’re gonna have to explain this one. Why are you implying a round of WSG takes 3 hours?
---
It does only pertain to the US government. The problem is these company’s get large amount of tax breaks because they are considered a “ platform” like the phone company. They are acting like “publishers” though when they censor people for words they don’t like. This is the crux between users and platforms who want platform status so they can It be held liable while also acting as publishers. If you can’t give me a hard line list of “hate speech” words than how am I to follow said rule? If it’s at the digression of who is complaining than this whole reddit post is hate speech to me....
---
China is making pig/gorilla/human chimera embryos Joe. I have the documents.

Also being able to heal without OOMing in 5 seconds
---
Enh just feels like you're a slow warrior who relies completely on RNG
---
As a druid, I've been backdooring alliance and soloing the final GY
---
Its really effective if there aren't alliance in base to notice
---
Been playing WSG on my lvl 46 and it is fuuuuun. Haven't faced any premades or any twinks in that bracket yet. I may just level it to 60 in bgs (skipping the early 50s of course.)
---
&gt; Starfire spam is about the same MpS as Frostbolt, but it’s only 88% the DpS. Starfire outperforms Wrath’s DpS at 30% or more crit.
---
&gt; Starfire doesn’t outpform Wrath at 0% crit until Rank 7 in AQ.
---
&gt; Granted, this is theoretical, but you might see a mild improvement if you take Improved Wrath, skip Improved Starfire and Nature’s Grace, and spam Wrath instead.
---
Okay, so i had to go to the experts for this one. 
---
Starfire gets buffed by curse while wrath does not and the level of nature resistance is much higher than arcane resistance in raids. This puts wrath vs Starfire about dead even at this point with wrath getting worse are gear levels improve.
---
I was (already got exalted I don’t care as much now) a huge proponent for getting rep ASAP. I really don’t mind a 30 min AV, as the rep was always amazing and the game actually felt fun. 
---
What really grinded my gear are the fucking rank 1-4 people on servers like faerlina//hero’s//stallag spamming their “kill balinda, lieutenants, and then lose in 8 for max honor” macros non stop. Like those people are actually going to be getting passed rank 8 on their mega servers...
---
How is it not Gnome?
---
I have an Alliance main and alt, and for my last alt I was planning on rolling Horde on another server for a bit of diversity in leveling experience. 
---
Has anyone done this and regretted it (have alts on another faction / server)? Enjoyed it? I was planning on rolling a mage, so gold wise I could be pretty self sufficient.
---
This is the kind of quality content I "pay" for.
---
Feet of the lynx didn't raise up as much as i thought, on Gandling at least, they're going for 40g each, what's their value on your server?
---
Some servers use LFG because it's global and official. Some servers have had problems with the player ran channels banning people from said channel for stupid things. It's also easier for people to join without trying to get the word out about a non-official channel. Report people for harsh language and such if you see it but don't expect people to not communicate.
---
A fellow blaumeux player! Hope to see you out there mate!
---
The endless grind is the entire game. Maybe it’s just not for you. Nothing wrong with that.
---
If AV gave any additional honor right now it would just award Rank 14 to whoever downed a captain first.
---
Take my up vote and get the hell outta here
---
Lol, fair point!
---
Tis. Even in PvE getting a priest to offensively dispel is hard. Helps to have a Mage use detect magic. They then see the buff and go oooooh right this does a thing.
---
Is "heellooo everybody" Advertise's catch phrase? I'm like 90% of the way to understanding this meme

I saw in the recruitment section an add for Holywar HW on Daggerspine Alliance looking for top tier players - they were top tier on that server. I played on Daggerspine in Vanilla and they wrecked content. Quality website.
---
The fact you think dispelling viper sting is a waste of a gcd tells me everything I need to know. I also like how you say hunter casts it instantly, as if it also isn’t a gcd
---
Free for all my lovely alliance players &lt;3
---
Lmao what a loser
---
Stoneform is better than Escape Artist in most cases.  You can make an argument for Gnome, but that's a similar argument to Orc vs. Undead on the Horde side.
---
Lame, but allowed.
---
I did, but during my time were the days of hours long matches. Are you gonna tell me now that vanilla r14s AV farmed? 
---
What if people want to get some of the gear? It's not all about rank 14. 
---
And the thing is it doesn't matter what you and I think. If everyone as a whole is sitting in AV all week, WSG/AB makes it impossible to get to any rank. That's the point here. 
---
I don't see why you're being a dick, I'm just curious lol.
---
**DPS warriors:** what are the best boots without ridiculous drop rates (i.e. not battlechaser's, gladiator's or sapphiron's) for someone that doesn't need anymore hit %?
---
Flavour is good. People being obsessed with min maxing the shit out of a 15 year old game is the problem and if it wasn't racials, it would be something else that would cause the problem for the exact same reason. Tryharding clowns sapping the fun out of everything with their obsessing about progress and efficiency.
---
I'm assuming he means AQ40 gear while doing MC and BWL
---
Can you purge when the enemy doesn't have any buffs? I know my felhunter can't.
---
Feral and resto are pretty comparable, resto can instant heal themselves more, but a feral bear can have well over 7k hp and 10k armor making the need for healing much lower, and feral charge can be incredibly useful.  1/29/21 is the best flag running spec, until you run out of mana shifting at least.
---
The point is, it only seems to happen to alliance.
---
What did you expect? It’s twitch chat-the realm.
---
nice what guild
---
Ali Krom represent
---
I had a couple long games and many short ones, I have more fun with the long ones but I’m just there for my ring and never setting foot back in AV
---
if people want to get the staff using other priests for help then let them. 
---
it's none of your damn business how they do it
---
For what it's worth, mages can solo DM:E jump runs as well.
---
That would be some next level AFKing haha. I was more referring to the current state of the AV meta where a player might do a few runs and think "that's fine for this week" only to have it not be recorded.
---
booohooo
---
Well I said true droprate, not the sampled droprate.
---
This would ultimately help the abusers, because you would be kicking their competition. It wouldn’t hurt the abusers since they have a large enough group to not be effected.
---
I guess the difference is if you are trying to help the group it’s still your best effort.  
---
If you want to fish in AV by all means do it but I also don’t think it’s ridiculous for people to report you afl if you are not contributing at all to beating the opposing faction.
---
The day i hit 300. I got 5 Crystals in 45min on a 60% mount. I was Big balling. Mining was the easiest road to being rich in my head. No fucking joke, i did about 4 days of Winterspring mining the following days and got nothing.
---
Citation needed.
---
its like 60/40 according to the census over the last cpl weeks which is not that accurate but i think that number feels right. hopefully people come back now that BGs are here and the world is a bit safer
---
What a lot of people actually mean by "min maxing" is any sort of competitive behavior.
---
Ah good point, I didn’t account  for debuffs and resistances.
---
Swiftmend is a great healing cooldown. Innervate and battle rez are both amazing raid cooldowns druids have in every spec. No matter what spec they're in, druids can do mundane levels of dps both melee and ranged (feral druids are helpful in p2 ony as ranged dps). One of two classes which can remove curse, and the only healing class which can do so.
---
Obviously their role numbers aren't as strong as other classes (rogues and warriors are better mdps, mages are better spellcaster dps, priests are more desirable as healers, and warriors are typically valued more as tanks) but they bring tons of utility and there's a general lack of druids (at least on my server).

My main is a level 58 warrior, I played WSG on my 29 warlock last night and every character was incredibly twinked, I wonder how WSG 50-59 must be, I am guessing most people don't bother twinking when that close to 60
---
Then dont mention it
---
If you play any ranged class it’s still fun but I agree if you’re a rogue the turtles are boring af
---
Lmao yes dude you are. Are you gonna be a piece of trash for using racial slurs? Yes. Can you freely say them? Yes as well.
---
More HP=more chances to see big numbers without switching targets
---
Report them and get them banned
---
Pretty sure Sulfuras is fairly close to 50-50 and pretty active
---
WSG 20-29 was full of level 29 twinks fwiw

Cap stonehearth (as a horde) and enjoy the pvp

The premade groups that you describe.

Anyway, its nothing to do with "hurr durr Aliiance" so stop your nonsense.

Didnt watch the whole thing, only to the point where he said I got banned for x days... and my first thing that came to my head was " ONLY??!! Should have deserved more!"

What a loser

Now wait 10 minutes until he marches to the ally ba-
---
ANNNNNNNNNNND the match is over
---
I still have mine!
---
Before cross realm bgs, rushing drek was a common strategy on Uther...  So it is not like this didn't exist.

The is the worst SS I’ve seen yet
---
At the fact that he's on Flamelash?
---
And wonder why he whisper you that message. Do people get notified of who reported them? Hmmm
---
If they do classic + they should legit have some crazy location where you can fish up ashbringer. But then have the location alternate so there isn’t 600 meta sluts all fishing on top of each other
---
Your performance level compared to your theoretical best.

I mean, don't get me wrong, I love fights, skirmishes and fun combat in AV but a 5hr turtle gets stale fast

It will day nothing to purge

Yeah, I really feel as if it'd be worth sitting down and making proper BiS gear lists for druids. Our itemization is fairly complex, and while existing lists are out there, the quality varies.
---
That's when someone with balls calls it out and the entire raid reports them back and gets them fucked.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Most people are too lazy to self police or too afraid and thus the undesirables get rewarded for their poor choices. This is literally a two way street right now and everyone acts like its a one way
---
I don’t think so. Maybe if you’re a rogue you’ll like stoneform more to go back into stealth but in every other situation escape artist will help you survive or secure a kill vs stoneform. Plus escape artist is a 1 min cd and stoneform is 3 min.
---
&gt; You have your main bracket ranking which is your current pvp ranks and then you have your currently weekly honor bracket split in to the same 1-14 but that determines how much ranking points you will earn towards your main pvp ranked high week.
---
This paragraph is a bit spaghetti so I'll explain it a bit better
---
There are two classifications of ranking systems. One is the actual physical rank (Private, Sergeant, Master Sergeant, etc) going from 1 through 14.
---
Then you have the weekly honor brackets which also spread 1 through 14. How many people are in each bracket is determined by how many people in your faction on your server have pvp'd that week. So for example; bracket 14 (the highest bracket) might have *one* person in it on a small server. But on a larger server it may have eight people in it.
---
The weekly honor bracket you're in determines how many rank points you get that week - the higher bracket that you're in, the more rank points you get, and the further rank progression you make when tuesday rolls around and honor gets calculated.
---
You are allowed to play a game and criticize it. But if the guy is afking in BGs or afking in dungeons while people powerlevel him and all the other shit, and then he criticizes those things, then thats hypocritical.
---
Well AV will be nerfed as more players get exalted. The weight of the number of hardcores or rushers will shift from 80-90% of the team to closer to 30-50. And if 15-20 of your or the opposing faction turtle itll be difficult to get timely wins. AFking out will greatly reduce your honor per minute and sitting in a turtle will hurt it as well. WSG will be more consistent honor and av will be more theoretical.
---
But I could be wrong, this is just one guys opinion about the future
---
Yeah, when it was zerg meta horde lost because even with 3-4 tanks, 2 marshalls would ww and one shot all the healers
---
Again, nobody here said it's "on Blizz." I'm not sure what you're struggling with here.
---
Second this
---
Can't you join as 2 friends in a party?
---
A lot of people clearly care about honor
---
Im 31/0/20 so that much worse lol
---
Disagree completely. "Bad design" is just a lazy, overused criticism most of the time. 
---
No matter what you do, players will find ways to try and skip actually playing the game in favour of progress. This mythical concept of perfect design that stops players from doing that, well it doesn't exist, and it doesn't make it "bad design" when players are able to do it.
---
Haha loving the downvotes, how dare you ask a question noob! this community used to be great, now it's full of horrible little Hitlers who'd probably spit at you in the street for dissing their k/d ratio.
---
He starts every one of his videos that way by purposely using this annoying ass voice. It grows on you though.
---
15 hour grind = welfare epics. But 20 man, 10 min ony isnt?
---
I think you missed the hidden meaning.  He's using the normal complaints against WoW as direct comparison for how nostalgia about the game will never live up to its original impact, as well as using it as a metaphor about how becoming an adult and raising a family is never what you expected it would be.  Together showing how both things are impacted by time and experience and change people and thus their perceptions.
---
Wrong. The honor from wPVP can't even compare to doing WSG with a premade, or spamming AV zergs over and over. The mass wPVP chaos is over, and from now on it will just be small skirmishes here and there. 
---
Which is fine with me, because that's the fun wPVP anyways as far as I'm concerned.
---
Noggenfogger bear is hilarious, literally no animations while tanking raid bosses (since you have enough rage to never auto attack) except the ghost bear that pops out of your chest when you maul.  Hilarious.
---
You know, I don't remember anyone liked this kind of AV.
---
Video tl;dw: That's a badass fuckin' laptop.
---
*"All the semi guild runs always reserve the ZG mounts and enchant tokens for themselves. No fair!"*
---
Bare legs too fat
---
&gt; MT should always have first priority on tank items, full stop
---
This gets tricky in classic because now we've realized that a ton of stuff is tank items, because now we understand threat is king. Accuria, Ony Neck, Flameguards, Onslaught, Striker's Mark, all tank items. Shit arguably even Perds is a tank item. 
---
Unless you are in an incredibly hardcore guild, if you give all of those items to the MT, you may have a fucking riot on your hands.
---
this one
---
[yea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut_z8pHCgwM)
---
Next time, try using a microscope to take your screen shot.
---
Just start talking to people and make new friends. There are hundreds of people on your server I'm sure you can a couple you gel with
---
The only reason anybody would want this version of AV is if they didn't like any version of AV, but they wanted the rewards it gives handed to them. I don't mind this version being in the game for people to get in and get out, but the other version should be available as well. AV was my favorite BG and this is pretty much the worst version of it possible.
---
Had to simulate my 16 y/o virginity.
---
Grind to rank 10. 90g easy mount.
---
Just get the twitch thing, and turn it off after you update.
---
I mean, unless you live in a coastal town, but who cares about those guys amiright
---
And those aren't even GMs likely, just automated responses with a pre-generared message. I've gotten ticket responses where no human could have read my ticket and misunderstood my problem that badly. 
---
For example, we gave Tranq Shot tome to a warlock by a misclick when a hunter needed it, and 4 days later I get a ticket response saying "you can trade it if he didn't equip it, so I can't help you".
---
Super fucked.
---
I guarantee I’m younger than you
---
You lvl 60 yet? Lol
---
There's a reason outliers are thrown out when observing data sets.
---
Nah they bailed on the game after they got rekt at drek didn’t have a chance to get the whole crew reported. Usually this would be the action taken... now I will just end up reporting anyone from the server =p
---
Something about lacking opposable thumbs
---
Thanks mate! :D
---
I am a 60 priest, and I think if you want to heal primarily, I would go Paladin. They are soooo good. I intended to heal on my priest at 60 but it feels a bit bland. I ended up going Shadow and having a lot more fun, and I'm leveling my Paladin now to heal :)
---
Ok.
---
the bigger issue is AV vs WSG.
---
in vanilla, a single AV game could span over 24 hours, and the queues were often 30min+. Pre made WSG games were the fastest honor if you won all the games quickly.
---
In classic, you can literally lose/afk AV games and make more honor than people who win every WSG.
---
Not yet, nearly 50 now though
---
Nah I don't remember the guilds, sorry dude.
---
Go ahead and call me a racial slur and see if your can freely say it.
---
Agree 100% well said, though many F bombs
---
Pretty sure that’s just Auctioneer; the files show up as “Auc” in the addons menu. https://auctioneeraddon.com/
---
i wish, been going for 57mins still not done.....
---
People still not knowing auto run doesn't stop you from afking
---
Didn't know that there were 4, what are the other 3?
---
Ahm.. Well post like numbers say otherwise
---
You must get 15 HK's to be recorded for ranking.
---
still going ahead, and yea i do but not religously.
---
Just seems so boring.. and you only get a few silver per pick pocket right?
---
Was exactly the same except some servers had implemented landmines as well.

If you die inside you don’t get xp, but do get drops. So let 60 clear up until boss, run in and die (don’t release), let 60 kill boss and get loot.
---
1.  Yes, holy heals people better, but the trade of more efficient utility at the cost of a full dps slot is typically a net loss versus opting for a hybrid class to fill the gap.
---
2. Who knows really, from what I’ve read SP is the higher priority stat, but I’m probably not going to theory craft it that hard, as long as I get the results I’m looking for.
---
3.   Good enough would = boss dies and raid gets loot.  Everything else is just details. That being had, hybrid classes operate in the margins and fill the gap between the specialized classes, and sure, you can definitely overdo it. I agree.
---
4.  We bring 26 dps to our raid including 2 ret Paladins, 1 cat, and 1 S. priest.  I’m consistently 8th on the meter. Which is in the top half of dps, in the top 10, and better than 15 (most) of the “try hard” classes.  There’s still 7 people that out dmg me on a regular basis, and I do my best to bail them out when they make mistakes/catch bad rng.
---
5.  Fair points, all of them.  Also, for every hybrid dps like myself there’s at least 1 hybrid dps like our other ret Paladin wielding a Finkle’s Lava Dredger with no enchants, missing the hit cap, who hasn’t trained judgement of Wisdom.
---
On a side note, thanks for having this discussion. It’s been a slow day at work, and this has been a fun way to spend the down time.

Allright guys... Time for Ony! :D

The best content we had since phase 2 dropped. Thank you and really sweet of you to help him out!!
---
We have literally no real druids. We have one "PvP"-Druid who is only coming to MC to crab all the weird PvP-Items and stuff. 
---
And our Guild-Leader has a Druid on a 2nd Account that just comes with on Follow as a Buff-Bot ._.
---
How? How much money do they give you?
---
It’s funny because a lot of things “wrong” with classic is the community’s fault and has nothing to do with Blizzard.
---
progress,maxima,symbol, unlucky. but unlucky kinda disbanded recently some core members moved to the other guilds and some made a new one called JP or JD cant remember
---
What's the problem of leaving a match early? You don't have to stay til the end. Take your honor and go. But those 10 min rushs are just no fun at all.
---
He means take the gun rather than the bow.
---
The answer is yes. The gun has 2.6 AS, and the bow has 2.4 AS. The gun is better because your abilities will hit harder (35 - 66 damage vs 32 - 61 damage)
---
A good pvp healer will also do as much offensive dispelling and cc as they can. Its not like raiding where all you do is heal.
---
4 out of your 6 reasons are false so I'm gonna assume you don't even play druid.
---
You can kind of do this now.  When you queue look at the instance number you'll be joining, then check whether it's near the bottom of the list.
---
The bottom instances are the newest, so if your game isn't near the bottom it's probably a turtle.  If you want the turtle choose one of the games near the top of the list directly.
---
I hit exalted, went to the vendor and got kicked just as I hovered over the item I wanted to buy.
---
Yo, you're banging Sweet Anita?
---
P4 is ZG, AQ is 5.
---
Yeah I sure love spending 5 hours and not knowing who wins
---
I really need friends like this.
---
OP can I ask what server/guild/faction you are on?
---
Yeah that's why I love to play football in the NFL, though I am not actually a professional player. I must first "level up" past all of the security guards and people on the sidelines and only then does the true game begin where I have to get whichever huge guy is holding the ball to fumble, then run all the way to the endzone of my favorite team. This task is impossible and I always fail, and thats what makes it great!!!!" - weird
---
yes but it also has an overwhelming amount of core changes i do not like.
---
i cant believe blizzard had me marry my wife, way to ruin everything blizzard, good job
---
These guys have better guild mates than I do actual friends. I need to reassess my entire social sphere, Jesus.
---
You definitely can, I don't know if it's a bug or not but I've silenced a mage that was stunned and he blinked out of both
---
Just because I min/maxed IRL by focusing on grades and school to get a scholarship and choosing a lucrative college degree that would make me eligible for higher-paying jobs to be financially independent to be able to buy a relatively new car/truck and afford to buy a house does not mean I deserve to be meme'd to death. /s
---
But really that's what I did.  
---
Just throw baby Yoda memes at me 'til I expire in my corporate sellout comfortable living space.
---
All the same, of course it's at their discretion.  It's their platform.  You want full 1st amendment protections, you use a public venue (even on a street corner, there are certain limits to your 1st amendment protections), or your own, not someone else's.
---
You realize for that to be an issue someone would have to read all that data and it's still totally different from actually experiencing the content for the first time, even if something new comes out when i last played retail and I'd do a quick skim over key mechanics for normal mode raids it still felt new actually experiencing it.
---
&gt; When you choose to play a remake of a game made in 2004, and then come in discussing about changes to be made - yeah you can shut up and take it how it is, or not play at all.
---
The entitlement mentality of these pirate server fake "purists" is astounding. Real WoW was a living game that constantly changed. The fake, fossilized version that pirate server players learned how to minmax and exploit isn't real WoW. It's a safe space where nothing ever changes and the flavour of the month is the flavour of forever.
---
If Blizzard brought real WoW back, a game that constantly changed, that would have been infinitely better.
---
Official forums played the same role (and were far more active)
---
Hahah turns out it exists!! See ya there

1 std (standard day) and 10 mins.

Dude are you kidding? That guy’s a legend. His pvp video made me roll elemental shaman.

"Because the player base didn’t exploit every single min/max advantage capable back then. "

Tell me, is afking in AV not exploiting every single min/max advantage? Did you not read the post?

Stoneform removes poisons which breaks Blind as well as diseases which removes Devouring Plague.
---
So similarly to the Orc vs. Undead debate you'll get more value out of one race than the other based on what class you're facing.
---
I know there have been loads learnt in game design since then. But just looking at the math of getting to R14 it looks insane.
---
They set the decay %, they set amount of points in the highest ranking point reward and they set the ranking point barriers. It's really not that hard to calculate how many consecutive weeks a player would need to attain R14 if they were in the top bracket each week.
---
Surely they knew that R14 demands an absurd time commitment. So it's either by design (why design it like that!?) or it's an accident which was easily avoidable.
---
I love how reddit downvoted the guy with the right information and upvotes the opposite. Some real Einstein’s on here.

1. Sigh, how do people this this thick.

Ya 50-59 isn't bad. I have halfway decent gear and was able to hold my own. Wouldn't want to be a 50 with gear from SM still though.
---
This is sorta true, once everyone gets their rewards the wPVP will resume. There will be folks out in the world recording footage for their pvp videos.
---
Sounds like you were the butt of that joke.
---
Screw that, just ban them. They knew it was fucked up, yet they're scumbags and did it anyways. Shouldn't have to pander to them because they were within their rights to abuse something Blizzard implemented but didn't fix in time.
---
/pray 
---
Bless this post
---
Retail is a totally different game vs blizz keeping a level 60 cap keeping the current patch for core mechanics and just releasing a content patch every 4-5 months that fills in incomplete zones/adds a new dungeon or raid now and then.
---
We used to summon non gnomes into  the chimney in front of scholo
---
He made an emote that said he reported him afk and type /afk to prove you are still there but it actually insta kicks you from the BG instead.
---
It’s a trick that’s been around for 15 years done by virgins like OP.
---
At least he turned into ice and not azsharite.
---
You only like it because you haven't tried the original.
---
It's not alliance pugs, it's alliance premades of course. This is exactly what I said.
---
I can agree with that.
---
Having 15+ afk'ers in an AV was a nightmare.
---
Welcome to literally every forum for every remotely popular game.

Happy customers aren't as likely to come here to proclaim how happy they are; unhappy customers are insanely likely to come here and proclaim how unhappy they are.

What do you mean with passed away? for me that means he died.
---
A majority of people who watch sports can easily go outside and throw the ball around but most of them literally never play the sport or haven't since they were a kid. There really isn't much difference. The entertainment aspect you mention is just like all the sports films that get made. I mean I agree with your overall point but not with the examples you used.
---
It's a trick like when people ask for a keybind and other people tell them it's Alt+F4
---
People do /em to make a custom emote so it ends up saying "/u/nastylep has reported you for being afk. Type /afk within the next 30 seconds to remain active and avoid being kicked from the Battleground"
---
Locs confuse me in raids/BG because I can never tell if they're taking dmg or not. But in raids, at least it keeps my overall heals given up.
---
Most shamans heal and some guilds allow one or two enh/ele shamans, not entirely different with ret pallies. The shamans are mainly there for windfury and fire resist totem.
---
Did you at least get to have sex with her first?
---
hahaha love this fourth wall breaking shit
---
Yes, some people did farm r14 in vanilla by botting. With this version it's even easier. 
---
You could eventually get there doing wsg after the av rush dies out. I would give it a few weeks or months.  
---
Av is the meta. It was long foreseen. And soon bots will be the meta.
---
I've been in a few mild turtle games (maybe 1 out of 4 games) where we turtle, kill all LT and Balinda, PvP some and then kill vann. That was about a 40 min game. I love those rounds when it happens! Since I join AV for the PvP, oh shame on me for having fun within the ruleset.
---
Oh really? Did not know that, thanks. It's always been my least favorite Battleground so I've mostly ignored it throughout my years of playing.
---
I also seems to depend on the time. In our guild we have a saying, "Looks like it's Horde o'clock." because the ratio seems to go very horde-heavy past 9PM and get worse around midnight.
---
Suu xd
---
Oh really?
---
No you need to be able to hold threat for that.
---
Amazing!
---
&gt;Drops enamored water spirit
---
I know it’s not but I’m hoping they stealth nerfed the honor gained by AV so I can enjoy pvp in WSG!
---
Is Unbind the kid that had a mental breakdown saying he didn't want to play with Zoomer and Boomers anymore?
---
If so, that guy needs to see a therapist, legitimately.
---
Just spam LFG chat and ask your friends/guildies.
---
Great work people!
---
well no, only 0.1% of all players can get rank 14
---
Yup, Everyone happy is too busy playing the game, having fun haha
---
And sorry for your loss.
---
How’s it preventable?
---
Gnarly camera work bro
---
Fuck you Jorah
---
To make this even more of a pro tip:
---
-Buy a quiver worth of arrows and mail them to your bank alt. Don't open the mail.
---
-Next time you're near a mailbox in a town without an arrow vendor, log into your alt and hit return
---
-Instant return delivery! No waiting for the mail to arrive!
---
I do this with jagged arrows, Thorium arrows, quail (screw you, UC! Get a meat vendor!), and raid consumables
---
Oh but it feels so good to have some cocky mage walk up to you.
---
Drop Grounding and then go right into EleM CL+ES to watch them instantly die. So good.
---
hes having gf problems to if you can help him
---
If you compare your dps to a warrior you're always going to be disappointed. That being said you knew moonkin sucked and still rolled one what did you expect to happen?
---
This.  You run inside and die and stay in ghost while your runner kills.
---
That takes no talent or ability whatsoever.
---
Would you rather the reddit circlejerk be 'world PVP is great! who cares about flamelash and other servers like that!'?
---
Genuine question, not trying to be a dick
---
I unironically prefer this version of AV over the others. Not because of quick and easy loot but because it doesn't drag on for a fucking century.
---
Depending on your hit and if you are still using devilsaur, the 3 black dragon scale (shoulders, legs, and feet) is a good option.
---
Oh I see. I didn’t know you already had the enchant. I’m an oomkin and saving mine for aurastone hammer.
---
i had an afk in my game and they were reported by everyone but wouldn't get kicked because they die to horde every 5 mins, this NEEDS to be fixed, kick them immediately!
---
No! Your not in a raid group!
---
Also in AV but acting as artillery picking off those 60% mount speed alliance.
---
...I heal *sometimes*.
---
R E P O R T  P L A Y E R
---
It's not great, but considering the rewards from AV and Rank gear it's not bad either.  I went from 57 to 60, dinged yesterday.  That being said, you could complete an AV game shorter than some of these corpse runs even take to walk and rebuff.
---
We both said “Oh man “ at the same time. Nop it’s not tears it’s the smoke going in my eyes
---
So after losing AV "on purpose" for the umpteenth time due to the rush meta, I decided I wanted to change it up a bit.
---
I was raid leader for one AV, I marked myself and told groups 1, 2 and 3 to follow me. Rest do the normal horde strats.
---
I immediate got bombarded by idiotic man children telling me to stop wasting time and ruining the game (by actually fucking playing it).
---
To my surprise though, most of the three groups followed me. We forked off to the west in the middle of AV and met the 40 man raid of alliance head on. 
---
We all dismounted and slowed/stunned/snared/cc'd them. Their initial reaction was to avoid us or try to outlast the damage. A few trickled through and the rest dismounted and tried to fight. 
---
Our advanced party died, but we took a bunch with us and slowed them down a shit load.
---
We spawned and I called for them to follow again, we went to the choke next to the middle horde graveyard and managed to kill the surviving alliance who met us in the middle.
---
The alliance then changed tactics and focused on Captain Galv (this was the first time I've ever seen Alliance even enter the building in Classic Wow).
---
Our defensive party ended up being a nuisance, delaying them as much as possible, eventually they overran Galv and formed up to push our base. 
---
I called our defence party to port to the keep to defend, we hid around the corner and waited for the incoming blob. We ended up defending against it. 
---
While this was all happening, the main raid killed their Captain, lieutenants, destroyed both middle bunkers (but kept their graveyard up) and were fighting a pretty decent turtle at their base.
---
There was quite a bit of back and forth, bouncing around the place back capping, doing small skirmishes, etc
---
Eventually we were able to do enough hand ins to try and summon the boss, but as we were trying to get enough people, there was a call for a push to end it.
---
We all met and managed to take the alliance keep.
---
The game went for 41 minutes, I got 4500 bonus honor and got about 1.1k reputation.
---
It was a fucking awesome experience, I noticed that our raid kept losing players and getting news ones. I'd like to hope that most were people with RL shit on and didn't want to stay. But I know a fair few were rage quitters who wanted to only do the rush meta
---
But this experience all started from a few of us branching off and charging head on
---
We’ve developed some closed-source tools to aid in the process. We have found greater success queueing with 20-25 man groups—its much more likely that everyone gets in and tends to reduce the frequency of the ~50:50 splits between two instances.
---
Just had someone from Shazzrah ask everyone to report someone as AFK for capping a graveyard...
---
Brown rogues ! Eh I mean warriors !
---
&gt; Did you at least get to have sex with her first?
---
Who says the wow community is toxic?
---
Shhhh non rogues dont need to know.
---
The fact that your guild specifically wants a ret paladin is a very unique situation that normally doesn't happen. I can't understand why so I can't really comment.
---
We did UBRS and had master looter on because people kept "Accidentally rolling need" and shit. So the ML was dealing with some personal shit cause his oven was spitting out smoke or some shit, and BOTH Dal blades drop... We talk to the physical DPS and say these are only BIS as a set, We think yall should roll for it as a set and they agreed. Well they rolled, and for some reason one didn't roll for a while and this anticipation built cause the other 2 rolls were kind of shit. 
---
We were like, "awwww shit Flashee" in a way that says "thats a shit roll man"... ML still dealing with personal issues and hears all the commotion about Flashee so he gives him the blades. even though he lost. So we have a guy who isn't in our guild, has nothing to do with us who just got given both Rend blades by mistake, and we go on damage control saying "Make a ticket, no way blizzard would let this mistake go through when we all agreed on rules going in" etc etc....
---
4 days to get told to fuck off on tickets made by everyone involved.
---
sad cunt
---
Hold up.
---
No nut, including no sex?
---
My girlfriend wouldn't mind the gaming, but she'd definitely go bonkers at me denying her sex until 60.
---
I mean you won't be Shroud either. I never watch streams but c'mon its pretty similar.
---
Crying. So, so sweet! What a kind gesture during a crappy time.
---
Yikes this is a mess of a post
---
Racials, zeppelins, dungeon access, Barrens level range and rare mob count, savory deviate delight recipe and fish, best fishing poles. And I'm sure I missed some.
---
Well I don't think I have much say in whether or not I'm flag running in this bracket unless there's another Druid. If it didn't seem like the best possible class then I wouldn't really want to be the FC. I prefer support roles, which Druid can certainly do as well, but it would feel like a waste if I wasn't the one trying to get the flag. 
---
Kind of rambled there, but anyways, thanks for the pointer! I doubt I'm going to mess with my talent build since I'm mostly focused on leveling but I will certainly keep that talent in mind in the future!
---
Prat, Tukui, Titanpanel, Mobinfo and Spy have done it for me so far. same if you want to report someone afk inside the match.
---
How much xp do you get in the average AV run and where does it come from in there?
---
You can choose which AV to join. They probably have a scout and then they try to all join the same lobby as soon as the game ends.
---
&gt;I'm so disappointed that everyone actually understands exactly what has to happen in order to get it over with quickly. I fully expected to zone into Alterac Valley on Tuesday and partake in an aimless, 4 hour long ping-pong match - keyboard turning and clicking my spells just like the old days.
---
I understand what you're trying to do with this post but you realize AV isn't days long anymore because it was changed/nerfed, not because people magically understand it better right?
---
Honor to get those sexy Rank12 boots and legs.
---
Those legs have 53 stamina with the HP enchant and set bonus! And 15% more move speed in ghost wolf makes us run at 61% increased move speed. So good.
---
... you uploaded 2 hours of shit? no thanks
---
I've been in an AV that lasted 21 min
---
I'd recommend posting in your server forum, discord, or subreddit (whatever is active).
---
They are sick of battle. Everyone would rather sit in av and watch the counter next to their honour tic up while they watch Southpark
---
Either way, it promotes wildly unhealthy gaming habits. If the best gear requires you to play 18 hours a day for 12 weeks straight, you're directly contributing to a reduction in player's quality of life. It's an incredibly poorly designed system and I don't know anyone who actually wanted to play classic for the ranking system.
---
me and friends queued together and got 69 yesterday.
---
nice.
---
Alright...now THAT was fucking savage.
---
I think I just got crushed by that blow.
---
Sorry then, I misread it.
---
Best post on this sub in a long time. Fantastic stuff.
---
I've never fallen for it but that doesn't make it any less scummy.
---
&gt; No matter what you do, players will find ways to try and skip actually playing the game in favour of progress. 
---
So far I completely agree. Players will always try that, that is predictable. And this is the reason why it is bad design to ignore this.
---
If you make one faction significantly stronger then they will be the majority. Unless you somehow disincentive being in the majority (wow does the opposite, being the larger faction is usually good) this is inevitable. You cant blame the players to behave in a way that is completely predictable and just human nature: players like to win and to progress.
---
There is good design, you dont need to look further then other blizzard games to see examples. Look at sc:bw or sc2 all three factions are the same strength. Some might be temporarily a little stronger (z before the last patch in sc2 had a slight advantage on a very high level of skill) but its usually minor and will be fixed. Also there is no dominant strategy, you can usually play fast cheese, macro games, timing push, whatever. And that is for a simple reason: If it were otherwise, one dominant race, one dominant strategy that is all there would be played. And that would be boring. It wouldnt help to blame the players "come on play something different, isnt flavour more fun?". Flavour is fun, but winning is more fun, to ignore this would just lead to bad game design.
---
Whitemane A (US) is highly active.

---
established honor caps are a joke
---
Yeah for a lot of geared out dps, part of fun of weekly MC runs is trying to beat your previous record. The boss fights are only a minute or two long of serious mode, you can chill for the trash.
---
In 10 hours everyone will be Exalted with AV and will be done with BGs
---
Apparently built-in Power Auras makes the combat more engaging.
---
Im not crying, I was just cutting onions.  For a lasagna.....for one...

Same way you join every group?

join your realms lookingforgroup channel and start looking

I wasn’t aware the Horde was letting us win.  I sort of just assumed they were focused on killing as many captains and such
---
Bring it I'll be 60 by then with good gear I'll be ready!
---
I love tanking. That's why I even made a warrior
---
Only one that got me was the libram of constitution, they were 6g each a month ago and I already had 2 so I thought I might as well wait till I actually needed more as they're unique and I was lazy. 
---
They're 250-300g each now, been scanning for about 2 weeks and they've only gone up in that time. 
---
At the stage where I want 2 more but that is absolutely ridiculous.
---
Bring it I'll be lvl 60 by then with good gear
---
Literally not worth reading the rest of the post
---
Exactly. Also what the fuck is this logic. Its like saying people are to blame for theft and robbery and murder and the government in question has no role in drafting and enforcing the law.
---
Both are to blame but human nature is inevitable.
---
I bet you’ve fallen for the pickpocket one too lol
---
Double honor WSG will fix it for a weekend.

Adulthood nerfs you... hard!

Oh it's Steppenwolf. I remember you defending low level Alliance in STV :D

My guild group beat a Faerlina premade last night. Felt extra good because of their server.
---
&gt;Don't have to respec between PvP and raid

You do

&gt;Only hunter and maybe rogue can kill you 1v1

Druid shouldn't lose to a hunter in 1v1. Ever

But if they simultaneous reported you at that moment, the debuff wouldn't matter, it would've just kicked you right then
---
"you think you don't but you do" - retail devs pushing retail content into classic
---
You can also win in 6-7 minutes. Had a ton of those.
---
Have you ever met a healer that parses poorly all the time but then on progression fights shows up and is a hero? Almost never happens because doing a lot of HPS is generally what a good healer does because you need to know when damage is coming, how to manage your mana, and how to output the most with that mana. All of that is useful on progression as well. I've never met a healer who was trash on farm but a god on prog. So for everyone saying healing meters are irrelevant...They're not going to tell you a full story but they do at the very least tell you who was able to put out the most raw healing in a fight which is still valuable knowledge.
---
Spirit of classic... this version of av was in vanilla.
---
Lucky guy, i was a co-gm of a guild and my co-gm and another person i helped gain power as an officer basically backstabbed me and took the guild away from me by using my issues in life as an excuse. It meant the world to me and i put a lot of work into it we were togerher since elysium. I even considered my co-gm a good friend and confided in him about the chronic pain ive been suffering thru and they used it against me and basically told me no one liked me. :( 
---
Really just needed people to talk to.. really sucked. Sorry for sob story just made me feel a little sad about the situation again. 
---
Ive had trouble finding my place so i basically quit the game all together. Classic hasnt been much of the same since. Cherish your guild mates they are 1 in a million!
---
Set your hypocrisy to stun.
---
Man druids are still so underappreciated ...great healers ,great utility ,great buffs and amazing in pvp.They can even be great tanks if guilds let them no problems
---
Yeah some people in my guild use details and my CTM still picks them up
---
You don't have to farm AV rep/honor, you can play BG's for fun too.
---
I've never even heard of the pickpocket one?
---
You can turn on sound in the background.
---
This warms my heart, you guys are not only great guild mates but amazing friends. I feel that in his time of need in which he may feel alone and isolated you guys and gals stepped up and made for damn sure he would be there with you guys and be surrounded by people who he cares for and who care for him, computer issues be damned. The world wouldn't have half it's issue if more people thought like you did
---
i'm so proud of this community.
---
I thought ya were calling them normies lol; I take it back then sir! /cheers
---
That’s a bad ass fucking laptop. You guys are awesome!
---
We had a sash of mercy drops in av drop. Rolled a 12. Feels bad man.
---
&gt; Who says toxicity stems from the inability to take a joke?
---
Here's the thing.  Jokes are supposed to be funny.
---
Fun IS the reason. It’s a game after all. Everything these days has to have some reward or grind for cosmetics. A (carrot on a stick) so to speak.  Nobody plays for fun anymore.
---
Always herod and faerlina getting salty
---
That user won't be able to reply to you.
---
Yeah, but those r14 weapons look sweet
---
Who gives a shit. It's still time wasted carrying your deadweight ass around.
---
Way longer than that
---
Way to much chance of a false positive. Seeing many different instances of the violation removes the possibility of outliers. Maybe someone announced intent to go afk in the spawn. Maybe they saw someone in their BG who was afk in their last BG. Maybe they have some other 'misguided' reason to actually believe the person is going afk.
---
Do we really want to play a version of wow where any of us can be banned at any time for doing something that 'looks' like we might have been doing something nasty?
---
In the priest vein, I hear tri-spec is a thing
---
Of course there are edge cases that people have to take into consideration like a bad start of a pull or bad rng on Rag. But yeah most of the time hitting green parses is very easy, its just doing your rotation for 1-2 mins(incredibly short compared to retail). If you cant do that than i really dont know.
---
Ill tell ya, stay away from MMO-champion if you dont like the vibes here
---
Good for you guys. Warms my nerdy little heart.
---
Thanks for banning them :)
---
Nothings been deleted.
---
Yeah I feel like that would have been better, and hilarious honestly. Let’s see the world first no tower race!
---
Im saving all my complaining for like 3 years from now when youre all in Naxx gear stomping my face in.

Honest question - what do you think is garbage about the honor system?
---
Any proof in this thread more than a screenshot of you beeing removed from a group?

Why do you think she is so supportive of his grinding? 4d chess here

This is good shit honestly.  Without serious griefing like this nothing will ever get changed.

You should thank them.

Anyone have a link to warrior protection tank weighted stats?
---
You should youtube how to solo farm Maraudon. I leveled 49-55 super fast/easy without having to step outside into the cruel phase 2 world.

Launch dm had different droprates for greys, 1.9 DM was nerfed
---
This is sad. I can't even call this hardcore behaviour. How do you even begin to take the game so seriously you're uploading drama videos onto YouTube?
---
How old are you? People making portal to Darnassus and doing this, why is this fun? "Click, pls help summon" huehue.
---
I really don't get it.

its drops from rangaros just eye item then u go craft with other items u cant buy for money not with money from atm machine or also not if u use card u have to play in top guild and raid alot and get lucky from rangaros

Strath Live is great with a Druid tank because of all the AoE threat required, and all the spell damage. Every tank I've had who reserved an orb sucked though, so I don't run with tanks who do that anymore.
---
It was removed. You can see a mod removed it.

But try again. Since you’re so free to say anything. 
---
I wouldn’t even have known you said it unless I didn’t check my phone notifications.
---
This was literally the meta in vanilla wow. What a self-centered PoV, you realize the game was literally unplayable for anyone who wasn’t ranking right?? I enjoyed the WPvP grind and I got rank 7 doing it on a highly populated server. That being said, it was awful for the Classic wow community.
---
Except this is how AV was in vanilla you troll. Stop calling it retail content.
---
You can literally tell everything that happened by the parse. Sure if you just look at the ranking you get to wrong conclusions, but anyone with half a brain would try find out the reason for the shit dps and see 30 sheep casts.
---
Hidden reroll

Depends on the person, of course, but I think it's a legitimate perspective when you keep coming across comments like this one:

I think they named themselves after the grummle's in pandaria that talk about luckydos all the time.  Fits well for a lore channel I have to say.
---
Ilvl isnt particularly useful for classic since it gets skewed by lower ilvl pieces that are very powerful: edgemasters, flurry axe, etc.
---
*proceeds to grief lowbies in 4K*
---
Pretty alive here, if your realm has a discord or reddit sub I'd try there. There's afew regular runs that look on my guilds discord.
---
Typically the terrain favors the alliance more. They have a straighter shot at the horde base while being hit by less shit along the way. In a straight Zerg, horde end up losing by about a minute or two. The first few hours of AV ended up that way. To counter that, horde developed the Balinda + Lieutenants strategy to at least get something out do the ordeal. They could turtle and probably do well, but nobody wants a long match.
---
Had a premade from grobbulus do the same. Funny stuff
---
Awesome. My guild did something like this for me when I suffered a great personal tragedy a few years ago.  Makes you really appreciate them.
---
this is great lmao
---
How noble of you and your guild to step up and be complete pieces of shit so blizzard has no choice but to patch it out.  Hats off to you.
---
the people who left got more honor/rep than you since you stayed for the hour. that's why a lot of people are doing AV atm, not for the turtle experience.

Congrats, must have been a long difficult wait!
---
you still read that wrong. I did everything in vanilla. Got to lvl60. Did all the dungeons. the big raids (no server firsts, but at least second place on some). Did open pvp, grinded honor and reputation in battlegrounds. I have basically seen everything there was.
---
Then tbc. started arena, became gladiator. then wotlk...
---
Wut?  Would you like to point out where I said that?  You seem to not understand the 1st amendment.  It does not provide you a guarantee of a platform.  That's why they get to decide what they will and will not tolerate.
---
If you want to be completely uncensored, you can provide a platform for that.  There's no legal obligation for anyone else to do that for you.
---
They wouldn't exist without a market
---
Game over I guess
---
I had the pleasure of joining AV 420 earlier.
---
Fuck man. Good luck the upcoming time.
---
It is called the mind projection fallacy.
---
Oh, sorry I thought I was talking to someone who wasn't a dumbass.
---
Not at all, because on trivial fights there is so much less damage being taken that healing said damage is very low strain on heals to the point of inactivity or healers doing more DPS than HPS. Being top heals in that environment has zero correlation to performance in a raid ID where you see more wipes than boss kills, simply because there isn't enough damage being taken by the group for all healers to be competitively efficient.
---
Patch 1.9.3 - "King Gordok can no longer be separated from Cho'Rush the Observer in Dire Maul"  ... it was to prevent people from farming solo, check out the hunter vs world video, cant do that now.
---
Probably mad for playing the objective and not flexing over the gy.
---
The server where the Alliance lost constantly at AV. Took me ages to finally get that "Kill Drek" quest finished.
---
pushing ranks pre 1.8 was fun until 13-14 with my WSG team
---
sadly not much WSG will be done outside of "for fun" in classic
---
AV honor too stronk
---
I have one mc epic
---
I like u
---
Only makes a difference if you do them at an appropriate level. If that's the case you get about revered i heard
---
Just stop
---
Yes, I'm aware. And I'm telling you how I think the game would be better right now, as shown on private servers, nothing more.
---
Hated raising weapon skills in vanilla and I hate it in Classic
---
WhT server you guys on?
---
Even then it only makes an AB win equal to an AV loss (and an AV win is still better)
---
if an AB win takes more than 8 minutes, even at double honor weekend
---
.......AV is still more honor per hour
---
We already know the honor output of all 3 BG's , and AV is far superior for ranking up by a longshot
---
have malistars (not that its special). nice and pointless shitpost, hope you feel better about yourself
---
I don't think first-time player constitutes casual. Going out of your way to find that information is the makings and habit of competitive players.
---
I understand your point though. Not all minmaxers are necessarily good, sorry if i insinuated that though
---
Parent squad on duty, raiding diapers and evil bosses without discrimination.
---
Your pets gain loyalty by just getting fed and spending time as your summoned pet. I don’t think it needs xp
---
Like even if you wanna min max why are you all in such a hurry, level an alt or something
---
Never thought about it like that.😅 I didn't knownl they were called like that in english because I'm german.
---
...MoP and WoD were the last two expansions I really enjoyed.
---
Do you realize that just because something may qualify under a fallacy does not mean that all elements in the set are incorrect?
---
Someone can use a "slippery slope fallacy" and the result can still result in that slippery slope. A fallacy indicates that the basis may not necessarily hold true, but it does not mean that the truthiness of the allegation is impossible.
---
In lay men's terms, I clearly indicate that my justification is fallacious - it does not mean that it is wrong or that there does not exist a person such that their motivations are precisely what I stated.
---
&gt; and most importantly Alliance can pull Drek with only 1 add
---
I can see this being a big deciding factor. I could've sworn I saw a video at some point comparing the two distances showing Horde was favored though, wish I could find the video. As for the tower damage, it's completely negligible compared to the damage the marshals do.
---
But ye, if Alliance can just pull the boss straight away and off-tank one add that's pretty much it.
---
This made me smile 😄. Yall are awesome!
---
5 hours? Pfffft I remember a couple AV games that lasted days.
---
I miss those and want those. What we have now is laughable and boooooooring.
---
From the Ashes? Now there's a guild name I haven't heard in a while. 
---
I used to be in a guild called Imperfection on Frostwhisper and I remember back in WoD and for a while in Legion our guild had a "rivalry" in mythic progression with From the Ashes. They would occasionally "raid" our TeamSpeak server and members from both guilds would give each other the business when the other was recruiting on the general chat.   
---
"From the Asses" was an overused bad joke in our guild.
---
People afking in Bgs was actually worse back in vanilla.
---
I would do it all the time in college while writing papers or doing other homework etc. (just had to hit a key every 5 mins)
---
There was no way to even report people AFK so you could just chill at the stables / blacksmith or a random GY in AV and no one could do anything.
---
Shut the fuck up you worthless gatekeeper. Maybe try to have a single original thought in your life instead of spewing this same bullshit over and over like all the rest
---
As a mage you can single handedly win every AV game if you want. You know what your horde counterparts are going to do, you just said so. What you do is ice nova their backline and kill the slow mount people, cap snowfall (controversial I know, but free honor and forces them to rez and stone hearth). Once you wiped half their Zerg run back to dreks room. They will try to kill you, and try to force them to accidentally pull drek. This alone can cause wipes. Let’s say they actually start the fight, wait until first cleave on MT and Fireblast + cone of cold. That’s one tank dead. 
---
Also try to pick out any priest, Druid or paladins. You’ll give your team 10-15 more minutes and if they wipe they are so far away. If alliance dont Zerg and win in 10 minutes 50% of them quit and afk
---
Majority of those playing WoW arent even 100% human being.
---
They're called "mankind" for a reason.
---
I hate how nowadays i avoid other people in MMOs because of all this, like i can have more fun on my own and avoid all this toxic shit. It shouldn't be that way
---
Yeah I think you are right, and a few other people who replied to me mentioned something similar, that the true hardcore community is silent because theyre out their working hard
---
You clearly don’t understand the differences between publisher and platform.
---
I'm not crying you're crying. Way to be excellent to each other!
---
Yeah it’s strange. I played in Vanilla *and* I’m having fun, but I’m honestly considering unfollowing this subreddit lol. The player base is obsessed with putting their experience in little boxes via BiS guides and YouTube. I’ll be enjoying the game, but after scrolling through here a bit... it makes me honestly want to unsubscribe. Why is it so hard for people to foster their own enjoyment of a game? If you hate it, stop paying blizzard each month. Glad you are able to have a classic experience that isn’t negatively tinged by the posts here.
---
Oh, like shiny Pokemon - I have to say we were pretty confused where Pokemon came up too hahaha! Shirviu does play a lot of Pokemon Go but yeah our channel is indeed named after the grummles in Pandaria who love their shinies and their luckydos ^^
---
Clams were not an 80% drop rate, I was farming in Not Azshara as it was Phase 2 and Azshara was a shit show. But the area I was in had a chest spawn, so I was getting some vendor junk every so often to sell.
---
I actually loved the long matches because it actually felt like a battle, but people are into instant gratification / maximizing with minimal effort now so it feels pretty hollow - kinda like doing necklace dailies....
---
I just hope it sticks like this. I'm having fun again!
---
BWL attunement is impossible.
---
BWL is too easy
---
BWL is too hard
---
Yeah fight consideration is part of the log analysis. Magmadar is a good check on single target, while Baron is for range if you remove the living bomb people. You also consider the fact that some people can cheese the score like with Golemagg: dragging the dogs near Golemagg for extra cleave damage but the offtank(s) will be taking a ton of extra unneccesary damage.
---
Yikes dude. You don’t even know how to take a screenshot. You probably don’t know there’s a version of reddit that can see removed and deleted comments lol.
---
&gt; Only hunter and maybe rogue can kill you 1v1 
---
imagine actually believing this
---
So your glass is half empty?
---
This. This is the post.
---
Yes, that is what I said.
---
Oh which one is that
---
Herod is the anti-twitch circlejerk and Faerlina is the Twitch circlejerk.
---
Either way, they're both fucking terrible and I hate having to queue with the toxic vile.
---
&gt;Do you realize that just because something may qualify under a fallacy does not mean that all elements in the set are incorrect?
---
Yes, but you are straying from my original statement. 
---
You stated:
---
&gt;Whether or not it's a projection of something I've experienced does not change the validity of the statement.
---
I stated:
---
&gt;Actually it does? Fundimentally.
---
----
---
If something is logically fallicous, it fundimentally affects its validity.
---
The dumbest part is you posted it on reddit
---
This is awesome.
---
I'm happy to hear you're having a great time. Also, Barny and UberDanger are a hoot. Their content is great. I wish you continued fun on your journey!
---
I dont like it because when i am done with Rep and .. if av stays this way.. Ranking in AV as well... WSG queues will always suffer as well as AB
---
I bet this was on a Tuesday
---
Brilliant! :) I do vaguely remember this!
---
This video is great and wholesome, but god damn. You Can get a good gaming laptop for 900 dollars in the US? Youd have to spend around 1500 of not 2000 for a good gaming laptop in the EU
---
Sorry I didn't have time to appropriately respond to this.
---
You, and a few others, seem to be in the right about this stance. The vocal minority is usually not representative of the community they let on to paragon
---
Thanks, that's a relief to hear.
---
Its fine. Learn to play, nub.
---
If you want to avoid intense button mashing, I'd recommend Paladin. I know you said you want to go Horde but Paladin is the perfect choice for this. He's tanky, steady and playing him consists mainly of methodic autoattacking with a wide selection of 'save me' backup abilities.
---
Some people find it boring but at the same time, it's very chill. It's almost as if the class comes with a built in autopilot which you only occasionally need to steer in the right direction, and if a crisis arises, you can often instantly alleviate it with a single button.
---
How is rushing down a brain dead boss that makes LFR look hard, fun? its mind numbingly boring. the AVs of old where the mobs had more health timers took longer allowed for strategy and if you got tired of it you were free to /afk and leave to let new blood in, people say the AV is a pve BG and they are wrong it originally was a pvpve you had to do both PvP and PvE to win not just one, old AV is what BFAs battle fronts should of been, this current AV also fucks over pvpers who want to get high ranks because the best way to get honor is by doing pve.
---
TL/DR old AV was an epic battle people did for fun and the one we got was made for people with short attention spans and fucked the ranking system.
---
I never called you the N word though.....
---
This is so refreshing to read, whole damn thing should be quarantined, it's such a shock to encounter the level of dipshittery when you enter a BG.
---
Would have been an entirely different game if subjected to that drivel from day 1.
---
the was how AV ws in the most retail version of vanilla
---
How can he be main tank and not get loot? I'm a shitty priest who barely shows up and got like 5 epics from 2 raids. What guilds are you guys in?
---
Doesn’t work everytime, but horde have been getting much better. Just yell this everytime at the start of the game. “KILL THE ZERG!! KILL THE SLOW MOUNTS!! FREE EXTRA HONOR!”  If you make the alliance Zerg split you have a much higher chance of winning the game
---
I guess that's why I'm consistently in the top 3 heals in raid?
---
Can confirm. Rolled on Yojamba just to try out Horde temporarily and ended up staying because the server is way less toxic.
---
Are you alright man? You seem a little bit upset.
---
isn't the vendor outside AV in open world?
---
Yup. The biggest reason people had to camping flightpoints and eventually major cities was that it gave the best honor. You may have some people camping flight points for the fun of it, but the majority of serious rankers will be in Alterac Valley for the most honor/ hour.

No, it affects the *soundness* of the argument. My argument can be valid without it being sound.
---
My argument is *valid* irrespective of the truthiness of my propositions.
---
My premises may very well be false - if assuming that they're are true, none of my deductions are incorrect. Therefore it is *valid* albeit not *sound*.
---
Thank you for coming to my TED talk.
---
Well the idea behind preraid bis is the fact that theres a limited number of raid drops each week to gear out 40 people. Expecting youd be full t1 in a week or two is incredibly rare.
---
This game does not cater to your kind.
---
Hey look everyone, Blizzard listened to community feedback and fixed a problem.
---
Now, watch as the next time a problem comes up, people start screeching that Blizzard doesn't care and isn't fixing anything.
---
Well if you are the tank generally healers don't take kindly to you rolling on the healing gear they need lol.

Hi, /u/sludgybeast

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e9u6yf/classic_community_in_a_nutshell/). 
---
Yeah they have been
---
That was an extremely kind gesture, your community did for him. I am extremely sorry for your GM's loss, I lost my own mum in Oktober. I bet he felt the kindness and love from all of you, for doing this.
---
Ha! My crew is the same way (though a touch older). There are alway kids running around in the background, wives/husbands asking if the fridge is low on milk or eggs and pretty regularly someone needs to go AFK to attend to something. Somehow we still manage to raid a couple times a week.
---
In case anyone else had shitty FPS after the patch: Check to make sure your wow is using the right graphics card, it might have switched to a worse card, or even your onboard graphics for your CPU. Escape &gt; System &gt; Advanced Grapics &gt; the last option on the bottom left. Don't rely on the automatically choosing the best one, select your good card.
---
both
---
Damn. I was trying to be the czar so bad. Life goal ruined :(
---
Oh jeez, a Euro guild named Axis. Ugh.
---
I don’t care about that weird ‘u mad’ comback. Do better. And work on having better opinions you fucking sheep
---
Horde wins so much now that they defend .had 5W streak yesterday today went 8-2!And its so much more fun then zerg pve
---
Yeah, just a countdown and all click join first available.  My group is pretty low key though, we send a strike team to kill lieutenants while everyone else goes to drek.  We don't yell or call out/advertise that we are actually a premade
---
why do people automatically assume "rank up" is "I wanna hit rank 14"
---
Never really got that concept
---
a lot of people go for rank 12 for a mix-match set of pve/pvp gear.....
---
So the a version of the game that was primarily played by turbo-nerd autists in the EU is an accurate representation of a live classic server?
---
except you're wrong
---
we had plenty fun on nost, it's just that blizzard is shit at delivering a game
---
I used to HoT warlocks so they could lifetap in long boring fights so I dunno in TBC you'll have big dps on your side
---
Some people enjoy minmaxing.... people saying "just play the game" - well playing the game for me means being as efficient as I can be.  That's what I enjoy.
---
If you’re a rogue it’s better to solo him for hoj so this doesn’t happen
---
Right in the feels, good stuff
---
Casual here too, having a blast
---
the math has been done
---
a good wsg premade with 3 kils on each enemy nets about 3-4k honor per 8-9 minutes atm, (remember most enemy teams are still gonna pick up your flag... and waste your time).. and thats with a win.... if your premade ends up against another premade... good luck gaining proper honor per hour....
---
AV = 3-5k even on a loss.. every 7-10 minutes mostly
---
AV's been mathcrafted to death.... its just.. better for ranking...
---
Months of my life I will never get back...
---
Does it give alliance rep or only IF rep?
---
Not gonna lie, it's very amusing watching the entire AV meta switch up every few hours.
---
Shitty buzz. How many runs before it dropped?
---
I think it is like 100.49 vs 100.60. But I don't have confirmation about this.
---
Right if they are done with Bgs then they have no need to world pvp.
---
Sounds like BS to me.
---
Sadly, the PvE hermits are too busy farming rep for easy epics to give a shit how broken AV is. If it doesn't change, PvP for any reason other than a time killer is finished in Classic.
---
Wow only 45 minutes way to min/max the fun out of the game
---
Look, as much as most of us agree with the spirit of what you're saying, we cannot have AV back for various reasons. Also they now cannot make some of the changes your'e asking for without reverting reputation gains of the thousands of people who are already exalted.
---
This was another issue of blizzard's due to the Activision focus of, "spend as little as possible to gain as much as we can without exposure to risk." The days of Blizzard taking risks to make groundbreaking products is over. Apparently even taking risks to slightly re-balance falls into those restrictions.
---
Most of us agree that this isn't what we wanted. Most of us want the spirit of classic with reasonable quality of life updates. Some of us would be happy with new gear. The teams that designed this game with love are gone, some retired. The will of the company to put money into development of innovation and love is gone. It's a pity but this is what we get.
---
What is this sorcery.. you’ve been blessed by the loot gods on this blessed day. Unfortunately that mean you will lose most rolls for epic gear in molten core from now on
---
How hard is it to solo him ? I’m going to be turning 60 and should I wait to gear a bit before starting the grind ?
---
And the distinction, for purposes of the first amendment and this discussion, is entirely unimportant.  Nowhere in the first amendment does it provide you a right to have a place to put your speech.  All it guarantees you is that Congress is not able to make a law regarding your speech.  Hence, Blizzard is not required to provide you a channel for you to write whatever you like, any more than Facebook is required to let you make posts.
---
Have you ever tried to chase a druid down as a class other than those? Good luck. And that's just in general cases; a properly geared FC druid can run away from any class at this point in the game.
---
Sorry I jumped the gun assuming ya were teasing them, huge fan of these guys content, and they are good people so I wanna protect them lol

Oof.

Was 55 when dropped. Just doing a full BRD run :(
---
you right click a dot on the map
---
Whining back in the old days is what lead to the water downed version of AV we have now. So yeah, you are right. Lets get it back to the way it used to be. Long, hard, immersive and with more focus on large scale conflict. Not this pve shit show.
---
mod=god today
---
Yeah now that the horde is defending there are some great 20-40 min games!Love it
---
It's pretty obvious what my question is. But you've answered it, so thank you.
---
I'll offensive dispel flag carriers and healers (priests/druids). I know priests have a ton of buffs so thats a no brainer, and druids are all HoTs.  Maybe on a mage with ice barrier up. Essentially if I see something visual to indicate that they are buffed, I'll dispel. If you're a hunter or rogue or something, I probably wouldn't actively offensive dispel.
---
We'll see when naxx comes.
---
People talk about there being no BIS lists in vanilla, I had one I followed though. Things like that existed, theorycrafting happened on forums and the likes. There were optimal build/rotation guides.
---
The difference is now even the most casual nub has heard of these things and follows them whereas back in vanilla it seemed the majority of the player base just did whatever they wanted and didn't realize if they sucked or were sub optimal.
---
Thats acshually awesome.
---
"Just reached 51 baby!"
---
"Oh please cant you just get to 60 today?"
---
"Rules are rules baby"
---
(she is almost drowning in her one liquids by now)
---
would also work wonders in TBC
---
"Ding ding baby, just reached 69!"
---
"You get better get this 70 today or im doing a 69 with the first man i meet today"
---
What are the specs?
---
Cry more, nub.
---
Ah yes I needed a good cry. Thanks fam.
---
You don't have to kill bosses in MC, you can kill respawning trash for fun too.
---
Might want to repost with a correct title
---
Horde are now winning cause we defending with smalle groups its bit longer but worth it
---
People have been having fun with raid/gear progression and Vanilla BG's/PvP for years without resorting to hacking or cheating. Believe it or not, it's possible to have fun in this game.
---
My posts here tend to go over like lead bricks, feel free to post a PSA if you want though.
---
This is awesome. Thank you!
---
I wish they would at least let us queue with a party of 5.
---
Just super annoying how hard it is to queue with a couple friends or guildies.
---
You're an asshole.
---
nice and pointless brag, hope you do too!
---
I met some of the best people in the world because of this game.
---
You don't need any of that actually. Literally all you have to do is afk in av all day, every day and you will get more honor than anyone that isn't doing that as often as you are.
---
Yup it seems like GMs aren't even in game anymore
---
Honestly Jorah, get fucked.
---
Whoa boys, me too!
---
I refuse to believe that Spinebreaker was the only server where the Alliance lost constantly at AV. Then again, only me and the other Randiem guys in WSG could play in either battleground. Otherwise...yeah, the Horde won.
---
This is what this game can do when you don’t make it your min-max optimization simulation. It’s a game. Have fun and make friends.
---
thank you. i have no idea why reddit needs the bleeding obvious layed out before them, but according to that jeweled post before, at least half of them(/us?) do.
---
personally i didn't play vanilla, so i'm taking it as slow as i can while being psuedo competitive.
---
a lot of peple i know min/maxing it don't even play or like rpgs. they lean more towards dota 2, league, cs:go, mordhau etc. hyper competitive games, and some certainly didn't play vanilla, but got caught on the hype train, and wow has and always will feel good to play. that used to be blizzard's m.o until heroes of the storm, which they deleted, so kudos.
---
Youre part of the problem
---
We had double druid pants, two weeks in a row. Let's just say the guild was pissed, but I have a full set of healing Pvp gear now :).
---
I'll make a helmet.
---
&gt;For the majority of the playerbase
---
Lol wtf is this take
---
I believe you are the one who got wooshed, my good man
---
Yes I assumed yer gender
---
Yep horde finally catching up and defending love it! Winning most games atm
---
Exactly, I'm getting tired of hearing about people complain about no real pvp in AV or unfair honor when that isn't the point lol. It's gonna take horde longer to get rep and they'll have more trouble getting rep after all the alliance get their items.
---
Flask duping exploits were in vanilla, should we bring those back too?... since we're on the topic of cherry picking specifically bad moments in vanilla to make this same stupid argument for the 100th time.
---
Huh?
---
Arkinventory is better than bagnon In every way
---
Bullshit, everybody knows 1.12 AV is objectively shit. Blizzard chose the path of least resistance and released the 1.12 version, when they could have not. You can't force people to have fun if it isn't.
---
Congratulations dude with dead mom, not everyone shares your morbid sense of humour.
---
Sounds like retail might be the game for you then
---
Priests don't want half the gear that druids do anyway. I don't mean to roll against the healer, lol. 
---
I should've clarified.
---
They arent funny a few days after the loss, jackass.
---
No shit? Thats what happened in vanilla too. Bgs permanently ended wpvp. Welcome to 15 years ago idiot
---
We did it back in those days ..
---
One of my fondest memories was of a human warrior in full wrath/Rank 13 mix'd sets
---
walks right up to drekks barracks ... only 1 horde tower burned so far and says "heal me i got this"
---
...... dude tanked 3 of drekks commanders and drekk.... and we just burned drekk down
---
dont remember his name or anything ... just him saying "I got this" and .... getting it done lol
---
Best of luck to ya!
---
&gt; This version of AV is just as bad or worse than retail, and previous versions of AV would not have allowed this cheese strategy.
---
They 100% would have, it just would have taken a bit longer. If neither side wants to PvP you can't make them.
---
Yeah check out Zatar on YouTube. He did a solo anger guide
---
And memes too!
---
You should be able to do all of brd, lbrs and do east. 58 you can do everything as healer (including ony and mc if you can get a group to take you)
---
*Why?*  
---
I cannot fathom how something like this would be preferred off? It's the pinnacle of community spirit around this game. Do you prefer ninja loot drama, memes, and screenshots and that's it?  
---
I genuinely pity you.
---
Does this actually work? I turn into a cat or bear. Skele only shows in elf form.
---
It’s like football! Way to support athletes getting life long disabilities!
---
Wheres the part she shoved a remote up her ass?
---
Jk.
---
Bro put a ring on that issh, been trying to convince my wife for 3 months now...I got 9 days played all after 9pm and I'd relevel a character again just to play with her cause I can see her acting like this too
---
I got mine second run you jelly
---
&gt;I understand what you're trying to do with this post but you realize AV isn't days long anymore because it was changed/nerfed, not because people magically understand it better right?
---
Yeah.
---
Reroll on a pve server, the atmosphere is way more chill and way more social and way more friendly.
---
It was the meta for 2 months after blizz announced the honor system was ending soon after. **IT WAS ABSOLUTELY NOT THE META FOR THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF VANILLA** 
---
why does this need to be said for the 100th fucking time?
---
There's a weird issue I dislike about druids... they're so loud! I hate switching into bear or cat form since that means a stream of annoying growling, rawring and clawing noises that won't stop until the fight ends. I don't want to have to listen to it all the time but I also don't want to play the game silent...
---
They used to do this in vanilla also but only to get their own friends in the instance not to enforce honor brackets. However they fixed it real quick when they realised this was happening.
---
I'll vote for you next time, I wasn't trying to ruin your life
---
I've had the same experience. I just turned down the specs on the game and that helps a bit but it'd be nice to have a better solution.
---
We got a new resto druid last week. For MC Run he was 5/8, had healing ring +mana regen trinket.
---
Online MMO communities/ guilds are family. No one can say otherwise.
---
We would grind losing AV premades all day in BC and each one took about 15-20 mins. It's not irregular to see games last that long now. It's not that different really.
---
Imagine thinking your rank the first week BGs release on brand new servers is at all relevant to knowing BG strategy that has been around for 15 years prior.
---
Wpvp is cancer in the form people were ranking previously. Tons of people have zero interest in that awful system, but enjoy fair pvp and have been playing these same BGs for over a decade. Just because you're a noob who can sit at a flight path for 8 hours a day doesn't mean you know a damn thing about BG strategy...
---
Haha my bad
---
Aye we probably have. I have the same username in WoW. Hmu somwtime!
---
Not talking about fps here . Talking about ping
---
Its tough shit man... i do wanna ask you though... after you lost her... did you start getting more sensitive to jokes about her?
---
Because i lost mine a couple years ago... and i ended up realising that jokes about her (all in good spirit of course) helped me work it out.
---
You forgot r/dwarffortress. The best sub I have ever participated in, hands down.
---
It's bad that the version of AV in retail is a better representation of vanilla AV than the one in so-called "Classic" WoW.
---
Something that Blizzard are not shy to point out.
---
Yes i do. But i just HAD to make that joke. Cuz you know..... the undead do kinda look like meth addicts who have been using for decades. 😂
---
Don’t add a price tag to kindness! Humans helping humans no matter the cost is amazing.

As someone who doesn’t want to spend money on Free Action Potions I am specced into improved spring and the talent that reduces the evasion and sprint cool downs by 1 1/2 min. It’s the only spec that allows me to beat mages
---
I plan to reroll on Bloodsail Buccaneers (North America RP-PvE server) for this exact reason.
---
I don't know where you got your definition, but your definition of validity is not the canonical definition in any model-theoretical semantic system. Logically valid is not the same thing as logically sound. 
---
Validity is an argument with the assumption that the premises are true.
---
Soundness actually inspects the truthiness of your premise to determine if the argument is factually true and logically valid.
---
If Superman actually exists, then at least one superhero is real.
---
Superman actually exists.
---
At least one superhero is real.
---
The inference is valid. If the two premises are true then the conclusion is also sound. However, the second premise is false - there is no Superman. 
---
Validity is a way of appraising the inference from premises to conclusion. Soundness adds the second dimension of whether or not the premises are true in addition to the argument being valid.
---
Sound = Valid + True premises. So, a valid argument with one or more false premises is unsound.

Did she drop any good loot?
---
You got 57-60 just thru AV?
---
Their perspective was that of EQ junkies circa 2004/2005. Definitely not a modern game design paradigm. 
---
12 weeks of constant grinding to hit top rank was probably a “casual” grind by those standards. 
---
That being said, it was a system that was made to be a brutal grind with servers that had a max concurrent pop of 3-4K. I can’t imagine what things will be like on a bigger server now...
---
I would do that if i had the time to mine, pvp and raid on my main and still had time to kill mate. I dont.. druid herbalist alchemist alt is BiS though.
---
I remember before spell dmg was introduced how weak casters were.
---
It's inside also!
---
With a small premade group it's also easier to do objectives together instead of trying to herd a few out of 40 randos and hoping you don't get afk-kicked by report system abusers.
---
I didn't think teebus was in a lockbox.
---
But even if you can get epics it's going to be the same drop % as killing mobs.
---
Some of the mobs i regularly farmed for leather/runecloth have good items/patterns in their drop table as well and I've killed well over 250 (i've probably killed over 2500) of those mobs and yet to see any of those drop either so I doubt it's something you can be expecting to actually see. If you get something good awesome but don't expect it.
---
Something close to the tri spec. I have full weaving for dispel bloat but I would have preferred reach, so I'm just dealing right now.
---
I keep holy nova for rogue destealthing and for stopping AB flag caps (even though AB is not in game yet).
---
In Phase 2 this spec was terrible, because its not suited for World PvP (and not really farming viable or raid viable, I mean you can always heal, but you look like you're afk lol). In BGs its been amazing because of the utility. I can mana burn people until they are useless and silence gives me 5 seconds of uninterrupted mana burning. 
---
Mana however is a HUGE issue. I didn't play a tri-spec this deep into shadow in vanilla and even though silence is nice, the discount from mental agility would probably get in a few more spells.  Dropping combat is quick though, so I've LOS-ed around corners, around tree stumps, etc sat and drank for a few ticks. 
---
I'm a little rusty on timing, but so far I've been happy with my spec. Needs some tweaking but in a pinch I go from healing to mana burning to spamming low level SW:P for a blackout proc.
---
Found the guy from faerlina
---
Downvote this to oblivion please thanks.
---
M+ just sucks as a low tier spec because you can't afford at all to take one with only 5 spots. You can't realistically have that well of a balanced 5-man dungeon speed run comp even if you tried.
---
They all need to be banned.
---
What do you value? Threat or mitigation?
---
AV exalted for lei of the lifegiver. Get lei'd, my friend. You won't regret it.
---
It’s around 50g tip on Arugal-Horde.
---
I can't watch the video because I'm at work, but if you're looking for a beast laptop that isn't that expensive, look at the Lenovo Legion Y740.
---
Mine has a RTX 2060 and 144hz screen. Retail is $1700, but google coupon codes. It brought it down to $1300. I can run Destiny 2 with max settings at 144+ frames in heavy combat.
---
Cause its a good game.
---
Yea. All joking aside, the difference is CRAZY on herod.
---
Basically nobody is roaming around in gank squads anymore. BRM has some fight, but nothing like the crazy hours long battles from before where BOTH alliance and horde would have to corpse hop to the instance entrance.
---
I ran around silithus and ungoro for hours without getting jumped once. On herod. During primetime.
---
For me the experience is more me spamming purge 100 times to get their shield off.
---
or be a druid and go into seal form......
---
Server dependent. Don't tip, ask them their crafting fee. Fight club keeps an updated list of Crafters for each realm.
---
I've won all AVs that have turned from a PvE race to an actual PvP BG. Alliance can't compete when fighting is involved.
---
What's the deal with the constant scapegoating of retail players?
---
Servers have a ton of queues for pretty much the first month -&gt; It's because there's a ton of retail players playing right now. Don't worry, they'll quit.
---
There's a ton of minmaxing when leveling up with all the spellcleave and melee cleave dungeon groups -&gt; It's the retail players who are infesting classic with their gogogo zoom zoom habits. Don't worry, they'll quit.
---
Nearly impossible to find a dungeon group without something on reserve -&gt; Retail players are bringing their greed to classic wow. Don't worry, once they quit we'll be good.
---
People expect you to have pre-bis if you want to run raids -&gt; The retail players need you to carry them through raids. They won't make it through BWL, don't worry.
---
Players transferring off of servers in mass amounts -&gt; Most are just retail players who don't know how to play on an outnumbered server.
---
Alterac Valley is more of a pve instance than a battleground -&gt; Retail players bringing their zerg mentality to classic. They'll get bored, don't worry.
---
Call it a strawman, sure, but at what point are people going to accept that this is just the classic community playing a 15-year-old solved game?
---
See THIS is what i like to see. Even as an alliance player on a horde-dominated pvp server getting tired of all the divisive content lately.
---
the only difference now is that its more noticeable. This shit happened 15 years ago too.
---
This GM isn't gonna see a piece of loot for months.
---
"You really gonna loot yourself that BRE man? After we got together and bought you that laptop?"
---
I did every felwood quest without seeing a soul - I would have been ganked 20 times a week ago
---
Shit, motherfucker. Lol
---
I thought it was alphabetical order when two roll the same.
---
weekly "I have kids post"
---
yes, druids are indeed excellent at running away from players, it's all they will be doing too lmfao
---
Aahh thank you

Not currently leveling but check out &lt;Tilted Gryphons&gt;. We raid around 8PM CST.

Surround yourself with some better lads 
---
I did this years ago and it’s a world of difference
---
I can totally tell that the guy in the black shirt is MT of the guild? Probably orc male as well! Am I right???
---
They have to go somewhere though. Moving entire cities of people even over a slow period of time can't possibly be that much more money efficient than green energy, surely?
---
didn't ask
---
I feel sad for you.
---
In my experience, most WoW players are against the idea that they should be held to any kind of standard in any situation - gear, skill, knowledge, dps, etc. even though rationally, these standards would benefit both them and others. There's a very strong "I don't have to be good enough for you" sentiment that runs throughout our culture.
---
If you aren’t really the czar of fun....does that mean my promotion to Earl of Enjoyment isn’t legally standing.
---
YOU LIED TO ME BRO.
---
And this is why semantic debates are pointless.
---
My first post was working off the definition I posted about. That is the basos for my original post. 
---
Meaning everything you have posted since has been a waste of time as you are using an entirely different definition.
---
All addons work if you load the old version.
---
Aren’t weapon speeds for attacks normalized? I’m still leveling alt number like 8 and haven’t done any raiding yet so it hasn’t mattered much...but it was my understanding weaponspeed was normalized for most yellow attacks
---
got fixed with the new patch!
---
Thanks. 
---
No, didn’t really get more sensitive towards jokes of her. In a sense kinda cheered you up remembering them if that makes sense.
---
Like she would always say “unbelievable”, and had certain way she would always say it. Still makes me smile/laugh how she would say it.
---
This. 
---
I get destroyed by Mages, Hunters, Warlocks and Shadow Priests. I am Moonglow spec so I don’t expect to kill anything but warriors.
---
it requires devotion
---
If it's an issue that u are losing too much HP in pve just downrank and use lifetap 1 instead of 2

The logo looked like asus Rog and it says G edition, so I'm guessing Asus Rog Strix G gaming laptops. Hard to say which Exact model though.

Platform: a company or technology that enables communication and distribution of information.

Publisher: a company or person that qurates and distributes

internet companies have traditionally viewed themselves as neutral platforms. Generally, not responsible for what people post and share on their services.

Number 1: this makes Facebook responsible like any other publication (ex: New York Times), for any non-licences photo that is published or information that could be considered slanderous. They are, as well as the person who made the content, suable.

Number 2: when talking about what is considered hate speech or not appropriate content that they ban, Zuckerberg said that they don’t have a clear definition of that at the moment.

If you can’t define your own rules how do you expect people to play by them?

Yeah it’s a brutal realization when I grinded AV from servers coming back at 3pm EST and played until 4amserver. Racking up 125k honor, only to be at the bottom of rank 9 bracket for my mid pop server.

Keep in mind I'm not determining what's the overall amount of active players, total or by faction. I'm not misleading anyone here. Census done at representative timeslots and during different days are constantly showing similar values. It is a valid sample for what it represents.

You are talking about a very different kind of sampling, to which we have no access because we lack the tools. I'm not conducting a study here and randomness is not must-have component for a sample. You can, and must, add discrimination factors to create samples. If I want to test the effectiveness of a treatment in a hospital, my sample can only be random based on a limited population that share certain traits.
---
I have a background in psychology and I have collected real samples using similar methodology. They are statistically accurate to what they mean. If I sit by the entrance of a mall on a Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday evening from 17:00 to 20:00 and count how many adult men/adult women/other enter the mall, I will have an accurate sample of the gender division of people who go to the mall at that timeframe. I'd be cross checking with someone doing the same of course.
---
What I'm doing here is the same. I'm counting how many members of a population that share traits (Alliance, online) and how many existing members are for the other traits.
---
It's totally statistically valid. I don't want to randomly poll people in Reddit on what server and faction they play. That's not going to help me here in this particular situation.
---
If every evening I count approximately 25% adult men, 65% adult women and 10% other, I will have statistically valid information. It's telling me that the majority of people coming into the shopping center are adult women. If I had further info (time of stay, purchases made) I could assist the owners on creating a business strategy.
---
Same here. I don't know what's the average playtime of both factions, but each time I count, I get a similar split. Both factions are fairly homogenous too, which makes it easier.

Trying to slow down the opposition instead of rushing to the boss?
---
Believe it or not, also jail.
---
I mean I totally agree with you, PvP would be a lot more fun if WSG was the meta but it’s not. There was multiple sentiments OP made that just seems like he wants a game version catered to him/her.
---
Wow cool!  My guild mates are just lootmates to me ahahha
---
You may be losing as far as an actuall win but you are getting the same if not more honor than the alliance
---
Missus walks the dog before work, I do a lap of Silithus every morning. :)

trust me, i'm good at what im doing. once i killed like 7 players in a row

Depending how you value human lives, almost anything is more efficient than today’s green energy
---
I mean if you list something in Org, it doesn't show up in BB.
---
You said "they literally look nothing alike" and then just confirmed 3 visual aspects they share. 
---
They have some things in common and some things not in common. To say they literally look nothing alike is absurd. That's like saying two bowls look nothing alike because they're different colors. 
---
A can of soda and an elephant look nothing alike. Two portals look alike regardless of if they're easy to tell apart or not. They still look similar to eachother.
---
Except it's not irrelevant.
---
Logical soundness and validity are the foundation for all classical logical inferences.
---
You incorrectly applying the term valid to a logical argument is not a me problem, that's a you not understanding propositional problem.
---
If you attend any university that teaches propositional, predicate, or Boolean logic at its most elementary form (Stanford is my source, in this case) they'll tell you the exact same thing.
---
My argument is valid, and you "using another definition" does not change that.
---
Nice caps bro, you seem really level-headed.
---
First av yesterday was me, two more priests, three mages, 2 hunters and 32 warriors/rogues.
---
When the "my mom is dead" response is no longer a joke......  
---
I lost my mom about a year ago. It's easier as time goes on, but there are still times you just break down and cry for no damn reason.
---
Even though I could just use Heirlooms whe WotLK hits, I'm still leveling alts so I can mess around with more classes than just DK like I did back then. I doubt they'll avoid releasing WotLK unless the BC re-release goes poorly.
---
I'll have to take a look. I'm in the middle of the work week and I've just been AV farming.
---
For the record, the player I'm referring to is a Troll Hunter by the name of Nezzabulas on Incendius US PVP.
---
He will be there alone, probably botting, and then I will kill him a couple times and then suddenly a human takes over. He'll also have people escorting him sometimes, or when I kill him enough, someone will come to escort him.
---
The players that come to protect him are absolute dogshit at the game, and I can pretty much 1v2 them (as a warrior lol). 
---
Its definitely an account sharer, but I think its a bit of botting too.
---
They wont. Way to much effort to really check who reported maliciously and who just followed what was said in belief it was justified. Cant really check logs either since most communication is over discord voice anyway.
---
At least the damage was low and it was fixed quickly.
---
Most retail version of vanilla. Lol. Ok troll
---
"We are so lucky that we didnt pick one of those toxic pvp servers that everyone is talking about where its just a million ganks on the way to brd and you cant quest in literally any zone or do any activity including afk in the middle of your own faction capital. Whew really dodged a bullet there, not sure what everyone is referring to with all that. So anyway we picked horde..."
---
C'mon now.
---
When you sees reactions like this to situations like this its cause the person saying something is feeling the same.  He/she needs a friend and a hand reaching out, not one smacking him down.
---
 Dont be a jorah lol
---
Honor system is trash really. I much preferred where you could earn tokens and buy gear. You could eventually get everything if you put in enough time. Having to grind 14 hours a day is just a bad design. With the token system, it took a while, but people who had families and jobs could at least catch up eventually. With the system the way is is now, only no-lifers can get to the top.

Lol druids gear so fast in raids its ridiculous.  We had 5 pieces of cenarion drop in a single MC run and only had one druid, and it was his first run lol.  We had 2 stormrage covers drop and our druid already had one so he got a second one for a different enchant lol.  Our guild enchanter(a priest) has a 4 set of cenarion in his bags waiting to be D/e'd lol
---
My only challenge was not being able to cleanse disease in Stratholme. Resto does just fine otherwise.
---
Depends on your goals bruddah
---
had a 9 lose streak
---
basically, if 5-10 horde rush the gap between balinda and snowfall GY, they can do some real damage to drek rushing.
---
ally never stop to pvp or defend, so we just die on the way while hordies slowly get to ally base and kill the shortie
---
Killing mobs and badge turn-ins.
---
So now we're stuck with afks for like 3 minutes lmao.  Bunch of pussies.
---
pro tip: if you get stuck in the BG you can delete your hearthstone, and use "teleport to nearest graveyard" function from help
---
We like the second thing, indifferent to the first.
---
The problem is not that it’s AFKable. It’s that whether or not a player AFKs, halfway pays attention while watching Netflix, or goes full try hard, has little to do with the outcome and nothing to do with the rewards.
---
The first night of bgs our full premade blasted WSG all night, same team almost to a man we ran in 2006. (9/10). Was the most fun I’ve had in classic. In about 5 hours we never lost a match and got roughly 100k honor each.  Felt pretty good about ourselves when we broke for bed, we’re older now but we still got it.
---
Woke up the next morning to learn that a person in our guild who is only interested in PVE, but had been grinding rep in AV the night before, had accumulated almost twice the honor we had.
---
Everyone of us in that group is trying to rank up, and when we realized that the only way to rank in this meta is to solo queue AV, we all died a little on the inside.  Running our reunion group would prevent us from ranking consistently.  To remain competitive on the ladder we have no choice but to forgo wsg and solo queue the PVE zergfest that is AV.
---
This is going to kill the game for a lot of people.
---
Can you explain this to me? I didn’t quite understand what’s going on with this.
---
just lose and go another game, more honor, more rep. Stop wasting time of 80 people. This is how soem idiot designed the version of av we got
---
&gt; the guild should be OK saying
---
Sadly this kind of long term thinking has been hard to come by in the semi-casual (2hr MC clears) guild I'm helping run. People want loot now, not BWL/AQ loot months from now. Like Classic is just a temporary tourist spot where they check out some content, get some epics, and they don't have long term investment. I'm probably just overgeneralizing based on anecdotes here but it feels like in vanilla a higher % of people planned to play for years and in Classic it doesn't feel like that at all.
---
Not being trash
---
Best advice to finding new lads?
---
Absence of normal rez is a reason why I'm afraid to heal dungeons =_=  
---
Every time someone drop into red health I'm thinking "If he will die and would need to run from the start of the dungeon" ...
---
lmao ok tough guy on the internet. v cool look.
---
I didn't say it was anything to complain about I was pointing out it's not the same thing like you said it was. When book shopping look for the one that says "ABC" because you clearly need to start from the beginning
---
For many players, open-world content is and has always been a complete face roll. 
---
Even in classic, levelling my warrior was *hard*, but I never felt like skill came into it. I never died and said ‘damn if I played that better I would have come out on top.’ The solution was always ‘I should have disengaged from those mobs earlier or prayed harder to rngesus so I didn’t miss three times in a row.’ 
---
Just playing more patiently was the solution to not dying. 
---
8 year-olds can go 1-60. I leveled 1-60 in OG vanilla at 11 or 12 years old, clicking, and gouge-&gt;backstab was a core part of my rotation. 
---
Instanced endgame content isn’t 1% of the game. It’s like, 70-80% of the game for me at this point. Both in retail and in classic. Probably more in classic actually, ignoring travel time. 
---
I like classic for the progression and permanence, the lack of forced endgame grind, and I think I like the PvP more but I haven’t done a bg yet lol. 
---
I don’t really care about whether I can pull 2-3 or 20 mobs in the open world, because the open world is super easy either way. I’d rather be able to pull 20 and get that part of the game over with faster so I can get back to playing with my friends.
---
If I'm not mistaken, druids were the least played class in original Vanilla. A couple weeks after Classic launch, we were still the least played class. People just aren't keen on being middling, I guess.
---
This is the way.
---
No you're crying!
---
I would say 58+ you can heal anything. At 55 now you can comfortably finish BRD, which I’d recommend, tons of great drops for healers, hammer of grace, emperor’s scepter offhand, senior designers pantaloons or the leather pants from Golemlord, gloves from princess, and the ring from saving princess quest.
---
Other 55+ ones are LBRS, DM:E like others mentioned.
---
Nice ty
---
Idk why people get so mad over this. I think it’s fuckin hilarious when it works. It’s been a thing in wow since release. I see people do it in retail to this day too. It’s just something people fall for once and never again (hopefully). 
---
I had it happen to me when I was 12 years old. I was so confused when it happened then realized how stupid I was for falling for it lmao. Ya live and ya learn.
---
&gt;horde force a turtle 
---
Horde better just let the alliance rush their base or they're forcing a turtle lol
---
AQ introduces tokens.  So slightly before TBC
---
Damn I’d be a huge ball of emotions damn
---
Your not wrong
---
If you intend to get exalted, now is the time to do it.  If you wait until 60 to work on it, it will be substantially slower.  If you only care about getting 60, I wouldn't bother with it.
---
Hello fellow Crusader.
---
I can understand this argument as well. I guess by longer fights I really mean like Ony, where the downtime in between healing phases let’s me make really good use of mp5 and spirit regen, plus full self innervates because we’re not really being optimal in innervate targets atm.
---
There are other fights as well that are more conducive to spamming things that aren’t just r4 healing touch, but you’re right, you can basically heal forever if you’re only using that spell and the occasional rejuv. 
---
I guess it’s a flavor thing right now. I agree with you on trash, to facilitate speedpulling. With lower mana pools and less regen, I find myself getting bored of the r4 touch spam, and even keeping rejuv on tanks in between those casts can put me closer to oom than id like. Maybe the real choice relates to throughout requirement on top of just fight duration. Ultimately I think there’s tons of flexibility at this difficulty, but you’re probably mathematically correct even if the playstyle isn’t as rewarding and doesn’t necessarily let you play the meters as much (again, irrelevant but fun)
---
I would shit on my GMs forehead. Fucking dick.
---
He’s hard to solo. Best way is to get another 60 rogue or 2 and just roll off for it. U can kill him 5 times very quickly. Then wait for reset cool down. Took me 60+ kills to get hoj.
---
Ah a worthy opponent. However the damn stun lock is too OP. But it all comes to skill.
---
&gt;Except it's not irrelevant.
---
Linquistics and word meaning is flexible. 
---
If you get stuck on what the "true" definition of words are rather than what I actually said, then yes, it is a waste of time.
---
This, but unironically.
---
Lol av in a nutshell? Thats way too much honor gained on the alliance side to be close to the normal.
---
They normally win but get 1300 honor while horde gets 2-3k
---
Time for more tequila
---
First part is my username, prot warrior for the guild ominous. I think you came with for a MC a couple weeks ago
---
u/Paddlemar damn this is deep
---
No that was Cedx, unbind is actually an intelligent player.
---
I've heard they are headed this way for those trying to rank up.  There is a big discord with players wanting to maintain honor caps that are afk kicking those who don't agree or break them.  If you can queue for a specific AV, it'd be pathetically easy to lock someone out of doing any BGs with a large enough coordination and player base
---
Battlegrounds being fully cross-realm brings out the worst in the community. Join 5 dungeon groups and call your entire team varieties of mentally handicapped about 10 times, and you might get a bid of bad server reputation. Join 5 AVs and do the same, uh, well, next game lol
---
I think read somewhere it was going to start in phase 4.
---
Yep, so far about 20% of the games I play end up being a mild turtle. Which means I actually get to blow up some Ally, and so far I think every turtle has been a horde win.
---
It takes a while to figure out the spawn timers since other rogues would’ve probably cleared it. Spend a solid 2-3 hours and you’ll make your time worth it
---
Oil of immolation helps a lot, if you’re having trouble.
---
Honestly just save quests for instances where the initial boss rush fails.
---
I heard that AV is a 5 minute zerg fest and Alliance always wins. I have been spamming it all day and games average 30-50 minutes and I still haven't finished my quest to win AV. Horde wins 100% of the time by turtling super hard.
---
&gt; If people want honor then go play warsong. Clearly people are only doing AV for the rep. 
---
But this is completely wrong.
---
Negative, it says 'nothing to purge' or something similar
---
wew you're triggered Vlad
---
Honestly seems like they should remove the PVP reward system entirely - have it give rank and that's it. Afterall, the only reason real PvPers pvp at all is the spirit of competition and sport.
---
Saving the pvp respec gold :)
---
Or how shitty the classic wow community is by comparison. People didn’t want small communities to make friends, they wanted small communities so they could punish people they dislike.
---
Alright, is questing or dungeon grinding faster xp then?
---
Wow, thank you.
---
I just came across this issue and was trying to find answers. I'm going to try this in a bit.
---
Definitely threat
---
Shut up Vlad, Tom’s doing the traffic update.  You can rant about brown people making your life horrible when he’s finished.
---
which one is it?
---
shouldve rolled night elf for the epic front flips
---
Classic is over for me. Top many bugs, cheat, layers conséquences, overpopulation.
---
Classic is worst than pservers.
---
I used to play vanilla and really classic is just retail with a vanilla aspect.
---
AV is the last nail in the coffin.
---
Agreed. NoChanges has never made sense to me. What I want is "No Innovations". With retail, Blizzard was incentivized to constantly innovate and revamp things, to keep everything super exciting and new. It brings back old players who quit, because they want to try the crazy new stuff. And it's good for headlines talking about the cool new features in WoW.
---
The reason why I find the NoChanges crowd ridiculous is that the game is going to be different this time around no matter what. Even if Blizzard literally released an old version of the client with absolutely NoChanges. Absolutely. No. Changes. It *still* wouldn't end up giving the same experience as before. Because the first time the game existed, everyone didn't know everything about it. We didn't know how every boss works, and where all the best gear was, and how best to optimize PvP. And because we expected changes from time to time, people were kept somewhat on their toes. But this time around, everyone already knows everything, and we know that no new expansion is coming. So all of that changes the experience. So pushing so hard for something which is 100% exactly the same as it used to be is a flawed concept. It's impossible to get the exact same thing as before, because the world has changed.
---
The NoChanges crowd seem to think that the only alternative to the major innovations and revamping which happens in retail.....is for literally nothing to change about Classic ever. Which is just ridiculous. There's a huge middle ground. It's entirely possible to add new content, and to make balance changes, and to fix bugs, without changing the spirit of the game. The first time around, they changed the spirit of the game when they added new content, and that was done *on purpose* to keep the game super fresh. But with a Classic client, it's in their best interest to keep the spirit the same, and keep the innovations over on retail.
---
So for me, the ideal is for Blizzard to add new content from time to time once the existing stuff is on farm. Add some new Battlegrounds from time to time. Add some new raids once most guilds are getting Naxx on farm. The important factor being to keep these things in line with how Classic plays. Some of the new BGs in retail don't feel anything like the BGs present in Classic. That doesn't mean that no new BGs could be added without "ruining Classic". They would just need to make new things which don't reinvent the wheel.
---
The last two maybe. Hunters are a skill matchup. If you are losing to mages, that's on you; druids are one of the hardest mage counters 1v1 right now. I'd go as far as to say that druids win 99% of the time in am equal skill/gear matchup.
---
Is that award a “seal” of approval? xD
---
So... sports then?
---
I can't tell if this is real or a troll?
---
They can intercept
---
There is no griefing in a battleground aside from misusing the report afk system. It is literally to kill enemy players.
---
This feels a lot more like vanilla in some ways (bubbling, mounting, and swapping weapons used to drop charges) but is plain broken in others.
---
The consistent elements messing you up here are as follows: 
---
1. If you autoattack out of range, you lose charges. Judgement activates autoattack, so if you judge at max range, that will lose your charges.
---
2. Swapping weapons drops charges.
---
3. It's looking like getting crit while you swing resets the "bomb".
---
Some weird stuff going on with losing charges in the middle of combat, though. It seems more prevalent when getting hit a ton or when CC's being applied.
---
Startattack macro no longer works. This might be vanilla accurate, and might not -- nobody did it at the time. But right now it's just you have to keep your autoattack off, right click attack just once, and do so only when you know your swing is up and hope you don't get crit while swinging.
---
I dont know what you expected when blizzard said their basis was 1.13.  The form things had at the end of vanilla would be the most likely thing to happen.  They even said a while back that this AV would not have the summons.
---
Your point about AV is completely wrong.  You werent able to just run to the final boss and kill him without taking all the towers first. The NPC's were also much stronger, to the point where you usually needed to summon the wolf/ram riders or the big ancients in order to get a push going.  
---
They released the easy mode AV version from late vanilla...and they didnt account for everyone already coming into AV in near full epics from easy mode MC...
---
Imagine getting 5 or 6 lvl 60 buffs to grind with.
---
Also the portal in Hillsbrad is great.
---
Okay Guess if you're goal is to hit Rank 8+ ASAP that makes sense and I agree with that, for me its about rep. I got more rep than they did.
---
I gotta throw in something for people to downvote
---
Asking crafting fee is a great idea, and then ill know for sure what is required. Thank you so much!
---
lol, nailed it
---
It is 100% the community. Retail can be toxic and abused but never to this extent. Something about the classic community that just breeds impatience and shitty behavior.
---
Sounds like someone isn't having fun in Bg's.
---
💕💕
---
That’s kinda funny though.

Night elves are too tall to stand on of the ledges for BRD lava runs. It is pretty funny.

---
Tbh Ulduar was just so good that it carried much of the xpac's quality in my eyes. Like, it was as close to perfection as raids have ever come in WoW, in my opinion. The ability to modify bossfights for unique rewards was absolutely brilliant.
---
This version of AV was in vanilla.  
---
And of the three major versions of AV it lasted longer than the original and about as long as the second.
---
Yeah, try playing a rogue in what is just hillsbrad 2.0. It’s not fun.
---
lmao this made me laugh so hard, thank you
---
All the friends I started with quit. Doesn’t matter. Found a great guild and having fun. Don’t make yourself dependent on what other people do... that just leads to disappointment inevitably.
---
I've heard bad things about Herod groups misusing the report afk system. I've been lucky to avoid those groups so far.
---
Literally every person from Herod that has to say something in raid is toxic.
---
You have to be joking, I haven't played much since I'm almost revered but out of all games horde won maybe 3 times tops. There was a bunch of games where it was pushed to 20-30minutes+ but in the end the alliance won.
---
thank you so much man &lt;3
---
What does any of that have to do with your first amendment guarantees?  Read the first amendment.  There's no guarantee in their for you to be given a forum for anything you have to say.
---
Jeez, that is a sad sack of shit of a response. He just ignores the underlying issue. What about when people abuse the same tools to grief their own faction? What about that? 
---
What an actual joke.
---
Aye. I remember it my friend. 
---
As i said. I remember the jokes helped. 
---
I even had a mate make a “yo momma” joke to me. Just after the funeral pretty much. I mean. A couple days. I think. 
---
Hohoho. He felt so bad. I remember actually thinking it was a pretty good one. And then after that when people mentioned my mom by a mistake. I just laid it on thick. 
---
I kept making them feel bad about it... 😅 my own kinda mama jokes. Just mentioned how she had died and how she lived and stuff to people to play with them a bit. 
---
That was good for me. (Just remember to explain the situation and what’s happening. How your just messing around. Otherwise its just being mean...)
---
Hope you get better though man. I’m sure you will.
---
nah your just letting all the drama of stuff that isnt related creeping in, no one should be watching other people play this game and the big heads that people get from people doing just that is most of the drama I see on this reddit. On my server things are awesome and we have a great time, thunderfury rocks
---
why will it be slower at 60?
---

---
I wish this shit would stop and more people would actually pay attention to the game rather worrying about AFKers. You're not helping either by reporting them for shit sake man.
---
Let's all just shut up and play.
---
jesus was a shaman tho water walk and self res
---
Really cool.
---
They get cocky because Ret is a meme spec. Many classes and specs will test Ret paladins. A lot of Ret paladins are also bad LOL. I’ve been playing Ret as a main for 14 years and that’s what it seems to be. When I play my alts ( hunter, lock and warrior ) I don’t get the same amount and type of classes fighting me.
---
what you heard about AV was the strategy until horde realized they cant win a base race because alliance is closer to boss.  What you are experiencing is horde changing the tactics
---

How do you make whip crack noise on reddit
---

---
Totally feel ya there. I am always a little bummed if someone dies and they have to run out. So far though most people don't seem to mind unless it constantly happens. Honestly most of the time when people die in dungeons its because they do something stupid (like pull agro off the tank from not watching threat) and that's not my fault as their healer that they screwed up. I figure if they keep dying from being stupid maybe I'm doing them a favor by having to be more aware of what they are doing so they don't die so much and have to run back haha. I have never been dropped from a group cause I dont have a normal rez though so far so I dont think most people mind too much.

This is brilliant.

just lose so us alliance can get our honor and horde gets fucked with only one 1 mark instead of 3

This is the most stupid ass take I’ve heard in relation to WoW in my life. Please just quit playing WoW and get off this sub.

LMAO! Ill take this as a compliment considering I love preach
---
A blue post back in the day confirmed a hidden tie-breaker roll - which logically holds water. Your theory doesn't because it still doesn't solve the issue of the tied roll. It makes it much more rare - but it can still happen - so it should be accounted for in the code. 
---
Having a hidden roll done behind the scenes is a lazy developer way of handling this. Rolls should definitely be server-side only to ensure no one can compromise them. UI tells server to roll, server collects players, performs rolls, then checks to see who won. If winningPlayerCount &gt; 1, then recursively call the same function with the players who won. Then reward the item to the player who won - but the rolls in the stacks underneath likely wouldn't be returned up the stack.
---
This also jives with the patch notes: https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.3.0
---
Adding in this recursive call is trivial to do after the fact. Returning the roll back up the stack likely isn't unless you're treating everything functionally - which typically isn't common in the C++ dev world.
---
u mad, bro?

In my AV ive had seemingly even winrate, fast games, medium games, long games and stupid long turtles.

Seems pretty good to me. Fuck off with that changes bullshit.

I like the idea of Quickplay vs Competitive modes. Have some different honor system for playing competitive.

I believe Azuregos (non-ghost) is neutral until he is engaged.

It does, though.

I'm not complaining really, but it does seem crazy easy? I'm at 52600 this week and not one bit has been from many player encounters or wins or bunkers or anything. I'm wondering if that's a mistake/bug or people are just playing differently or maybe I just don't know how it all works entirely.

It's nothing to do with spell batching, I've seen it happen a full 1-2 seconds after I silence them.
---
I don't think anyone would consider the grind to even approach anything considering "casual."  It was known very quickly after honor came out how brutal the grind was, and that was before they eased up on the ladder a bit.
---
Personally I'm not entirely sure they really knew what they were unleashing.  WoW was already very casual compared to EQ, it doesn't really line up that they'd intentionally make a system that required you to grind 18+ hours a day.  And even on paper it kind of makes sense: you get honor by PvPing, so the person who gets the most honor advances the most, just keep at it for a while and you get the gear!
---
Except that you end up in a poopsock measuring contest with your own faction over who can steamroll the fastest, and the whole system turns to shit right out of the gate.  The system would be relatively fine if players didn't literally destroy themselves trying to get the most honor, that's why some servers got their PvPers together and instituted honor caps.

I think he did man, and im sorry for your loss as well.
---
It depends on your class for both how easy quests are to finish and how attractive you are for groups.  I'd probably target any quests that get you something you'll need in the endgame, like attunements, waterlords, and good gear.  I personally prefer dungeons beyond that because I like the social aspect and find the content more engaging. Also collecting gear I want in the endgame gives me little secondary goals.  When I'm questing, the slow moving purple bar is just demoralizing.

People seem to be confusing FPS issues with latency. High ping has nothing to do with your gpu. I’ve been experiencing 300 ms ping constantly since Tuesday. Game is unplayable for me.

 **SM/Ruin** I really like that spec, cos I can do PVE and PVP &lt;3

Don't you get the deserter debuff for leaving?

I have 56d9h...

[Ok sure if they let you.](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-games-to-bypass-consoles/1100-6226758/)   It's no coincidence many consider the death of Blizz was the merger.  Here's a few gems of how he runs Activision:  
---
&gt; When he wasn't promoting the company's games or technology, Kotick was celebrating its laserlike focus on the bottom line. He pointed to changes he implemented in the past as being particularly beneficial, such as designing the employee incentive program so it "**really rewards profit and nothing else**."   
---
&gt; "**We have a real culture of thrift. The goal that I had in bringing a lot of the packaged goods folks into Activision about 10 years ago was to take all the fun out of making video games**." 
---
His title may not be accountant but he's a fucking bean counter.  I'm not saying it's a hard fix, or that the direct cost is what's getting in the way, I'm saying they're not allowed to do it because there isn't a clearly tangible profit to be made from that action.
---
It might as well be considered to not, with how fast a majority of games are going
---
One of the most wholesome things I've ever seen in regards to a game, how lovely.
---
this is true! The several times I have run strat the disease is kind of a pain. Although with the 2 HOT's we have I just make sure I keep one on whoever is effected at all times to help compensate for the disease. So far the only time people have died from doing strat runs when I have healed is in the very beginning when there are the big groups so whoever is doing aoe damage pulls tons of aggro. Hard to keep up with trying to heal a tank, a mage with no armor and generally a lock or something similar that pulls LOTS of threat.
---
is he tho? seeing as she filmed this and just had his baby 5 months ago&gt;?
---
I'm sorry, who's the coward in this situation?
---
If I invited my friends over and they got their camera out while giving me a gift, I'd put on a smile, thank them, and privately think they're assholes for recording it and posting it on social media. Especially if they included personal information about me in the title.

I was briefly in a guild that did something like this in retail. Unfortunately I was looking to find a more competitive mythic guild so I left after Uldir, but the bond those guys had with each other was really cool to witness at the time. Basically one of the officers was going through something, and a couple of the guys who live in his city had everyone in the guild take a picture of a nice message/signature. Then they put all of those messages/signatures into a christmas card for him, along with a top of the line gfx card.
---
Yea man I never made it past C+ despite being a tryhard and no lifing the game throughout high school. Hilarious to think there were people literally 100x better than me who would still comfortably get obliterated by the most mediocre Korean Brood War pros.
---
I had a buddy go through something similar with soccer. He was one of the best players I've ever played with, legit ran circles around everyone else when we did nationals tryouts, and was one of the standout players on the Canadian U14 team. He went to Europe to try his hand on a 2nd division English team academy and realized he was completely out of his depth. Couldnt even imagine how good the kids coming through the top club academies are. The level of soccer over there is just something else
---
Honestly this is a great point that I havent given any thought into.
---
Ive seen so many people complain that flying mounts killed wpvo and that is the reason why they shouldnt do the same mistake again.
---
Well turns out that 1. Wpvp just sucks and 2. It was actually bg's that did the killing blow
---
How much ranking points does each bracket give ?
---
There's really no way that Kotick has any amount of input on something this small within that large of a company. He wouldn't even know it happened. Changes of this scale being made by devs I worked with at HP were not being vetted by Meg Whitman. Not as a specific HP rule, but because that would be insane for both us and the CEO. Nothing would ever actually get done, and nothing would ever be changed. 
---
Yes, Kotick can change how Blizzad is run at a macro level. Yes it can lead to changes in design direction, priorities, focuses etc... No, changing the damn value of a queue system isn't going to be sent back to him. Unless there are literally 0 developers allowed to touch Classic's code right now, there's no technical or financial reason for this particular case of theorized corporate greed.
---
It’s fastest rep though, ain’t it?
---
Not that it’s slower at level 60. It’ll be slower by time he hits 60 due to less people playing.
---
As someone that just bought a ROG G731GT. They are badass fucking laptops indeed!
---
If a junkie ran out of money to buy heroine and you gave him money so he could still get some more, would that be kind?
---
TBC really was the golden age
---
13k for bracket 14 and down a thousand each bracket.
---
Hobbies, dnd, sports, lifting, art and more
---
My friends and I literally did the same thing, wednesday night from 8-11 we are absolved of adult responsibilities so we can run dungeons. 
---
It was great...until all 4 of my friends quit before hitting level 40. Now it is just my PuG and a beer night.
---
... but if you were allowed to discuss moderation actions, one could consider him to be banned.
---
I'm sure they'll eventually fix the incredibly broken and poorly designed vanilla PVP system...
---
when TBC Classic comes out
---
Real question now is are you guys recruiting :)???
---
Why would you even gift a Laptop if you have 1k?   
---
Argh this hurts so much besides their positive intend
---
Ulduar was amazing... and I loved how the concept of heroic worked then... It was a different wonky mechanic that you did for the fight... 
---
Once ToC rolled around and it became a toggle I was like : (
---
So turns out that given the chance you are no different from them.
---
Probably the same as with dogs - they're most vulnerable when pooping. So it shat near you because it felt safer than the dark corner of your backyard. Albeit, the stick might have convinced it otherwise.
---
I'm seeing this adaption too!
---
Kindof off topic but ive bee playing mmos since wow was released and i still cant find a good guild for the life of me.. is there some type of trick lol
---
wPvP is certainly not dead. Elemental invasions, AQ release the green dragons and other world bosses will still create wPvP.

BG’s just killed zerging gank squads.

That's a bad ass fucking laptop preach gave that guy. Nice work. Great community and nice to see some positive content on this sub.
---
This is just how online communities work. It's a pretty well studied psychological thing that people are much more likely to talk about something they're unhappy with. Because of that, top level posts tend to be much more critical than the average opinion, and replies to *those* tend to be unusually critical of the the post itself. In other words, forums tend to have a lot of complaints and white knights. Those groups aren't necessarily the majority in either case, they're just much more outspoken. The people who think "eh, good point" either upvote or ignore and move on.

I have a level 25 warrior orc and am currently doing arms but was wondering if I can switch to fury? I know you can spend gold to reset your talents but is that for all talents as in every talent spent so far or just one? Also, if I level with two hand axes the whole time, will I do no damage with 1 hand axes as fury? I notice when I put on shield and a decent one hander I literally will do 1 damage autos and the only reason I can think of is because my weapon level in anything but 2 hand axes is low. Thanks
---
No work, no family, no gf. Only cheap fast food. Sleep at random hours. 
---
Towards the beginning I was on a good schedule and working out everyday, but that went out the window.
---
And no, it's not a satisfying lifestyle.
---
This is possibly the most incorrect and idiotic thing ever posted.
---
I appreciate the down vote because I enjoy PvP. Down voting me for this actually makes me feel happier to know I bother you for playing the game it's also meant to be played. Oh a hit on my reddit account, so fucking what?
---
A large majority of the alliance that wanted to farm rep via zerging are already exalted because of the 75-80% winrate, so that strat isn’t as prevalent as it was on Tuesday.
---
AV has better honor gains than any other method and requires the least amount of effort. Of course it's gonna be the best route to R14,  I don't even know how it's an argument.
---
Gnomes are the master race though. How can you hate gnomes?
---
Anecdotally having more HPS than some healers in your guild doesn't mean resto druid is more effective at healing than priest, pally, or shaman. Priests have more output and scale much better with items (t2 especially), pally is much more mana efficient and with high crit have nearly infinite mana, and shamans are better raid healers due to the nature of chain heal.
---
Can someone explain to me what is DKP? how does it work? Basically anything possible and related to DKP i found little to nothing by googling

30 seconds vs 15 minutes
---
What ever will someone with a computer with internet access do to pass the time for 15 whole minutes I do not know, but I sincerely hope the troubled souls are able to find solace
---
That's a bad ass fucking laptop dude!
---
I hope good karma hits you guys like a truck
---
Yep! When that turtle happens, Horde ended up winning. It's pretty fun!
---
WoW 2 probably won't happen... Peoples pet/mount/cheevo collections are everything to them. 
---
Getting people into a new MMO is already something that's proven to be almost impossible on the scale of WoW...  And given how many subs they still have they don't have much of an incentive to do so.
---
Also given that they're doing a level squish down to 50 next expac.. Seems like they're more in it to just keep overhauling what they have.
---
Yeah I'm leveling by myself as well - my friends are at 60 but still playing, they're hoping I can get to them before they get bored. But for now it's a lot of fun, interacting with the occasional person and helping out.
---
This facepalm is the hat trick on someone explaining the exclusive irony of how inappropriate every one of your responses is to the context of what you’re referring to.
---
I know that's really tough losing a parent, that's when people need others the most. What you guys did is amazing! :) His reaction to the laptop is also very genuine. There's people on YouTube that get free stuff and don't even say "Thanks". This guy deserves it. Wish I had friends like that.
---
I know this will be unpopular, but I find it hard to imagine he couldn't earn or save an extra 50 cents a day.
---
How long did it take you to hit exalted? Was it worth it?
---
Never seen on Horde side once. I troll AVs, start turtles, cap GYs people think are bad to, fish in the pool in the middle with Alliance etc. People just laugh because its just a game and fun.
---
I’m not crying. You’re crying!
---
Was expecting a 420 joke, got some wholesome truth instead. Neat
---
I wish there was an option to sign up for a local realm BG. God I'd love a Grobbulus only WSG/AV.
---
100%, you don't even have to ban them for that long. Do a 2 week ban and anyone that was trying to rank would be fucking fuming (as in well deserved)
---
Well how did you report them? Sounds like you went a bit ranty and asked for them to be banned.
---
It's all about wording, remember you're dealing with underpaid entry level customer service who's metrics encourage ticket volume not number of bans they issue.
---
I'm doing AV the cheap mount. No epic yet. No mount actually lol.
---
Just got to 1k gold and I'd rather use 640g than 900g.
---
I'll be in AV until I get the ram
---
This and warlocks life tapping to .001% hp either mid pull, post pull, or pre pull
---
He has a 5 month old son that severely cuts into his play time. We went with a laptop because it works better for him. He doesn't play any PC games outside of classic. Now he can sit on the couch with the fam when he is doing small stuff in game, and can hook up to his monitor and play at his desk for raid.
---
I have been hopeful that once the rep farming nerds get their exalted then AV can just become a fun BG again, appears that way!
---
Whitemane
---
I did that in vanilla to get fish for the AQ opening event.
---
Might be looking for a couple healers ;D
---
It is, random non displayed roll.
---
So he's a POS is what you are saying
---
No, you found the experience this subreddit \*thinks\* they want. Anyone here who isn't exalted with Stormpike/Frostwolf yet will instantly flip the script if something changes to make every game last this long.
---
*IF* we get them (probably will), it’ll most likely be in phase 4, as that’s when it’d line up with their release in vanilla. They came out in 1.7 along with Arathi Basin
---
I always tell people, "Yeah, BiS for fighting targeting dummies, unfortunately your dps is 0 when you eat that  cleave and since only 2 pieces of your armor have stamina.....
---
When you reset all your talents (respec), it will refund you all your talent points from all talent trees. Leveling 1-39 is probably about even between fury and arms, the main reason to go arms at 40 is for Mortal Strike, which greatly increases your damage since it is an instant attack which deals weapon damage (the only other instant attack before that is whirlwind at 34). 
---
If you're dealing 1 damage autos with a one-hander, it's because your weapon skill with that weapon is really low. Find some mobs that are a few levels below you and just spam hamstring against them to level your skill. Intel also helps level weapon skill quicker, so getting an Arcane Intelligence buff from a mage would help as well.
---
100% of you wanting the old school AV are either full of shit or ignorant. If AV was the way it use to be. You would do games for a week and get  sick of it and bombard the forums with "**change AV - this is a WASTE of time!!!!**"
---
Based on all the AV games I've done so far. I find it incredibly hard to believe this community would collectively work together to complete AV matches.
---
You're going to sit here and tell me people would:
---
\-guard towers and graveyards
---
\-take mines and gather supplies
---
\-farm NPC's / players for Armor turn ins
---
\-Correctly use cavalry assaults &amp; escort pilots and use bombardments? 
---
Alliance in my battle group can't effectively take 2 minutes  to kill an NPC that will yield them a bonus honor, rep. Stopping the horde NPCS from getting buffed and deny the horde more honor.
---
All of this is a joke.
---
It's not only fun or mix/maxing.  
---
People also changed.  
---
10 years ago I could kill same mobs for hours and days, trying to get item with 0.01% chance drop.  
---
Now if I didn't get a drop in ~10 minutes - I'm already bored to death and will abandon idea to get this item.
---
No different than druids, every horde guild especially tended to have a few feral druids since without paladins there is a huge lack of 5 or 10 man tanks.
---
2-3 days isnt enough, you have to force people to miss AT LEAST one week of ranking (for the people that care about ranking/rank at all)
---
Does that mean the alliance need to love shaman?
---
I think the issue is people can be toxic and face no repercussions on their server.  If you're toxic on your own server you can get a bad reputation.
---
Yes because like I said alliance zergs for rep/win/marks and horde goes around focusing on honor.    If horde zergs as well then they up their chances to win 10 fold.  If they don’t zerg and alliance does, horde losses every time without a back cap or something else . Furthermore if horde zergs and adds in the back door to avoid the bridge, this is even better.    Every raid I was in where horde focuses on winning/communication instead of trying to maximize honor has won.
---
They have enough players left to constitute a good chunk at all?
---
Where can I find this list / add my friend to it?
---
Ive noticed this too. With 1-2 orbs res'd its like a 50/50 whether or not the group sucks, but all orbs res is basically guarantee that the group is ASS
---
if pve gear is locked behind a battleground, there will be a lot of people forced to grind AV while hating it.
---
and the objective is to kill the boss; any pvp is incidental
---
&gt;*farming herbs then rolling*
---
Aw yiss.
---
Yeah just no.
---
You cant upgrade it, it looses value, its already extremely bad for the amount of money, you toss away a keyboard and monitor when going to PC or in general upgrading, heat problems, noiseproblems, dust problems.
---
If you arent actually permanently on the go and NEED mobile gamingpower, then a gaming laptop is just a gigantic waste of money. 
---
The only thing that you can take into a new build is the Harddrive, the rest is going to stay in the old rig.
---
I had to quit vanilla very early because I had a kid when I was 20. My daughter is turning 16 now and is pretty independent. I'm loving the fact that I can dive into it now with only the wife sometimes nagging me to come for dinner. I'm super enjoying classic.
---
If this could be the first comment on this post, that would be cool.
---
It's usually 1g for a port but most mages arent jackasses if you're low level.
---
Just keep in mind that they have to buy a Reagant to use a port. So if you dont tip or tip low they low money 
---
But 55s covers the cost so he was just a dick
---
Have you only played one AV?
---
Buy a lotto ticket? Fucking luckbox
---
This. Please take the time to take care of your RL stuff before playing WoW. Its just a game.
---
Could have community designation of AV 1-10 are turtles.  Don't need Blizzard for that.
---
&gt;community bad

The brackets are % based. Each bracket can also have a limited number of players in it until it breaks into the next bracket. Your actual RP gain will be somewhere between the maximum of the lower bracket and maximum of the higher bracket. 
---
So if for example you are in bracket 14 and you are standing 5. You might get 12500 RP. The maximum is 13k RP for the person who got the most honor. It could go all the way down to 12001 before breaking into the next bracket, theoretically. Then the person at the top of bracket 13 will earn 12k RP. 
---
It is not 13k for everyone in bracket 14, unless they are bracket stacking and all have exactly the same amount of honor, which takes a lot of coordination and will not happen naturally.
---
As an alliance on a 60% mount this cuts deep. I was gonna be buying edgemasters but i'm seriously reconsidering.
---
You can't report anyone before match starts, it has to be after the match starts while they are still in the tunnel.
---
Imagine taking things for what they're worth and not pretending that what I said actually might have some validity to a lot of people regardless of your own personal opinion
---
Let it be known that I am not afk, my psychiatrist and friends have been notified and noted that I am not afk. If I happen to enter this battleground and be found afk know that it was not by my idle hands, but by the power which suppresses us.
---
Well... a lot of people find these streamers highly entertaining, funny, and charismatic... that's pretty much all there is to it... It would be a lie if i said Asmon or Tim never made me laugh... also one time Tim was inviting viewers to play mortal kombat on ps4, I was able to get into his lobby and I smashed his ass using Raiden, it was incredibly fun.
---
That’s amazing, well done to everyone involved.
---
The old GMs also probably shared the love for the game that players did back then.  They did random things in game, hosted some fun events, etc.  I doubt we'll ever see that again
---
You have no idea who’s on the go and for people who aren’t on cutting edge technology these laptops last a long time. My last gaming laptop was 3 years old and I gifted it to a friend who’s now used it for 3 more years. Not everyone cares about upgrading stuff and for a laptop to play wow classic, it’ll last him easily 5+ years. 
---
Which is why I say it’s a weird comment. You make a ton of assumptions to even justify why it doesn’t help you, the person who the laptop isn’t for.
---
Part of raw stat scaling occurs on a per level basis. At different levels, it takes a different amount of agi to achieve 1%  crit on any given class as an example. I could go in to more detail, but the short answer is using those two levels to soft nerf bundles of raw stats. Warriors in particular get bonkers when their crit gets to a point where they have near unlimited rage in pve (and to an extent pvp aswell.) Some classes like warlock have their playstyle change at higher gearing levels, where it is barely a dps increase to cast your dots.
---
Pvp at super high gearing levels becomes a bit of a burst fest back and forth, with druid in particular falling off to being way worse than other classes due to weaker scaling and burst increase.
---
You could, of course, still do some sort of diminishing returns esc scaling patch with normal classic stats, but at the end of the day, the problem with classic+ is going to be finding some sort of new endgame progression. The new progression would be some degree of marginal, but the breakdown of some classes at high levels of scaling would need be addressed.
---
I want this on wallpaper engine
---
The glow simply stops before the actual blade. Also it seems that the holding position is off too. The hand in vanilla is closer to the blade in vanilla than it is in classic.
---
I know its not a game breaking thing, but it really bothers me all the time when I look at my dagger :(
---
If you don't consider someone's mother dying to be personal information, we might have found another reason for me to think you're an asshole.
---
This is any public forum dealing with wow since it’s inception. Let’s be real. Most whiny fans ever
---
I mean, Priest definitely has it's moments. But for me those moments were all about the non-healing side of Priest. Mind Control, Mind Soothe, Mind Flay, Mana Burn, Dispel. They are super cool to use. Whereas Paladin feels amazing with support, Blessing of Freedom, Blessing of Protection to save your allies, Divine Shield, Lay on Hands, and your primary heal is quick and feels nice (Flash of Light) compared to the more slow paced healing of Priest (usually Heal or Greater Heal). YMMV though :)
---
this is amazing. you guys are just awesome people. i love these kind of stories from the gaming community.
---
I'm laughing my ass off honestly. I knew people were hoarding all the twink gear. Now there's like 5 Shadowfangs on the AH and they are just dropping even more than they were before.
---
Although i would have prefered another version of av, i dont think you have much of a choice if you want to compete for higher ranks anyway. 
---
By now, Players are way more "meta focused" than back in the days. This means there are many Players, that only Focus on the fastest way to earn honour, not giving you a choice to go another way. To balance bg's perfectly is very difficult and not really worth for blizz. 
---
And one has a choice: dont rank pvp in classic. Have a life, meet people, do things :-D 
---
... for farming rep these 7 min av's are heaven tho
---
We definitely need a system that prevents/discourages actual afking. Vanilla had like 15 afkers every BG on each side, it was horrendous.
---
Hah I actually dont know how the whelp room is actually supposed to work. Every time I killed Solakhar we just tank and spanked the mobs/boss on the ramp.
---
'Can have fun' =\= 'only way to have fun' please be accurate and don't misquote me
---
It's difficult to prove that they would want this as a business decision, but it's hard not to see it that way. They refuse to allocate the proper resources to addressing the core issues people complain about, yet they have plenty of money to do so.
---
Bruh you see his name? Definitely ain’t no coward. 
---
It's a points system used to distribute loot in raids. It stands for Dragon Kill Points.
---
You get points by whatever criteria your guild sets. Mostly based on attendance.
---
Attend a raid get 10pts.
---
When an item you want drops from Onyxia, you spend your earned points on it vs your guild mates. Whoever spends the most wins.
---
Pretty simple system thats supposed to reward commitment to the guild although it has its own flaws just like every other system does.
---
I don’t think this is a product of blizzard. Nor only is this the case with blizzard games. I think the overall gaming community has become extremely goal oriented. So instead of player-driven gameplay, people try to be as efficient as possible. And this is for most games out there. Fun is equal to winning, in today’s society. Increased competition, increased goal oriented gameplay. That’s just how it is now. I think it has it pros and cons.
---
Sub numbers are still fine and people are still enjoying classic. Blizz don't need to do anything just because some forums have people mad.
---
That’s wasn’t the point lol
---
Yes... one side is the classic community, the other is blizzard.
---
Those are opposite sides of the spectrum. Split the difference and go shadow priest.
---
:P
---
In all seriousness how do you like to play? Healer is kinda a thankless and demanding job at times.
---
So you’re saying if WoW didn’t have ranks then PvP wouldn’t be fun?
---
Yeah I'm sure they want people to stop paying them.
---
Archmage robes and borel mantel  are both a lot better than T1. The 5 piece isn’t that great. I would say use 3 piece arcanist and archmage and borel.
---
3 months late but go to twitch.tv/moo_uk and click on his spotify in the description. He's on the profile pic
---
this here is a prime example
---
I know that, but not every raidleader lol
---
Doesn’t start until AB comes out.
---
Yeah, doesn’t work when it’s 90 percent Zerg turned into 90% give up. Good for you though
---
Classic was supposed to be about community and this IS a retail behavior that is anti-community. This just reinforces to new people that they are not wanted. Subs are dropping every day. I want classic to continue but blizzard won’t continue it if it doesn’t make them money. 
---
It’s shit behavior to do to people because it’s not just 15 minutes of deserter status, it’s saying, literally, “go away.”
---
People want to feel like they belong. This says they don’t.
---
Hey that's a bit much dude. I can appreciate your disapproval but I think calling him an asshole is a bit much. Don't you think? I would like to suggest looking at it from a different angle; sharing positivity, whether for personal gain/gratification or not, does good.
---
I enjoy the turtle matches even as alliance are we’re likely to lose. You have to actively think about who to fight and what to do.

That run up the rail of the stairs in ironforge, i swear i do that everytime im there lol
---
*Clever use of developer mechanics.*
---
Flip a coin, roll a dice it doesn’t matter, I think you are going to have a good time with either class you could pick.
---
But 
---
If interested in PvP a warlock is probably the better choice tho not optimal, and a holy priest is definitely a more PvE build. Leave it to fate or pick what you think you will enjoy, good luck
---
theres literally no horde outside trying to pvp they're all in BG's.
---
that’s fair and I’m not saying they have to make changes every time people get angry. But simple communication is a great first step and a sign that they care. And the fact that it’s been missing just worries me.
---
Did you get xp from the caves too or just token turn ins
---
What’s BG weekend?
---
Maybe some people are.  But who's to say they wouldn't also have more fun enjoying things for what they are and not being focused on only rep/honor.  I'm offering perspective which seems to be lost on a lot of people here.  I'm not telling anyone what to do, except try to imagine you could have fun in AV even if there were no rep or honor or gear rewards to be had, enjoying PVP for PVP?
---
Yup, enjoying the game in spite of the horrible class balance, lack of QOL, buggy behavior, and arcane mechanics. These things are bad, but classic still has this strange appeal that overcomes them all that I dont get in retail.
---
I agree with this SO much, and at the same time I am enjoying Classic WoW in a way I have not enjoying a multiplayer game in \_years\_. The sense of community, activity, economy, etc. It's not a tremendous never-ending amount of anything, but it's enough to keep me entertained for a long time.
---
They don’t want it to fail, they just don’t want to put more money into it. It’s only a cash cow if they don’t have to hire more devs to fix crap.
---
It's all the servers.  I'm in a relatively small guild with no streamers(can barely fill an MC) and it's absurd the amount of rando hate whispers I get at the start of AV just because I chose Faerlina as my server.  Most are just toxic and not ban worthy but I have gotten a few bad ones.
---
This was my same battle.  
---
I was enamored with shadow priest back in the day and only played to about lvl 30.  I went holy this time. Lvl 32 right now.
---
Started a warlock tho.  Topped dps in Onyxia the other week, supplied an entire 32person MC raid with healthstones and ss/banish - by myself!!, and have 6 epics and the rest all pre-raid BiS.
---
Needless to say I had more fun with one over the other. To the priest's credit, I didn't have any addons until I started playing my lock.  You should get the addons you want and see which you have more fun with.  Both classes provide a lot of utility to ang group and rock imo. Glhf!
---
The thing is I bet he doesn’t care.  To him it’s a win win “either classic succeeds and we make more money, or it fails and I’m proven right all along.”  I’m just getting the gut feeling he’d rather have option 2.
---
You don't. PvE healers wear whatever has the best healer stats. Cloth, leather, whatever.
---
This is what I've noticed too. Lost every game at first, and the moment I started turtling and convincing others to come with me, we've won nearly every single one. I would love it if there was some way to check your AV win ratio because I'm sure mine is positive by now despite the initial loss streak.
---
And it is way more fun too to play tower defense than it is to just rush, kill commanders and lose like the people always ask you to do in the chat. Extra fun when you read raging allys on discord about how hordes are turtling &amp; winning rather than letting them win.
---
Cool?
---
That’s a fair point too, but certainly makes the player base feel isolated and ignored.
---
Then explain Phase 2. I guarantee a ton of people stopped paying them over that fiasco, but did they say a word about it? Retail is still their cash cow because of vanity items and WoW tokens, plus it’s got way more people playing.
---
Yup, people act like there's not toxic people in the "play for fun"-crowd even though I've had people be incredibly rude and condescending when discussing how our sense of fun isn't the same and that's OK. I don't owe them anything and they don't owe me anything, just do your thing and don't be a dick about it.
---
Didn't even notice the bold on mobile
---
Wasn’t there an issue with the Classic pvp contest at blizzcon?
---
Yeah, it'd be dope. Like getting WW axe at 30.
---
Do priests not a quick in classic?
---
Hitting the truth bombs my man
---
The group from nost said when they visited blizzard that  J Allen Brack was one of the most supportive of classic that they met with.
---
Let me know if it helps you!
---
Your gut would be wrong. Successful people in business typically aren't driven by proving nerds wrong. They are driven by success, ie being as profitable as possible so the company shareholders keep employing them.
---
Like the other's said. Go do stuff you enjoy! Put yourself out there and just be yourself. Eventually someone will come around that you really click with!
---
wow man that list of your past gaming experiences actually made me sad for you
---
i play retail mainly (worth a shot if youre completely new to wow as you pay for the sub anyways) but i love that classic has brought a new wave of people into azeroth
---
new life into an old game is always a good thing
---
All the new player comments i'm seeing are positive though...
---
There are literally hundreds of posts that highlight the “community”- especially the first week. Tons of screenshots of people helping others, a line up of people patiently waiting for a quest mob. And if you ask people what the difference is between vanilla and retail, why they wanted it, it always comes down to “community”.
---
If you don’t understand whats wrong with forcing people out of a bg to make them feel stupid, you’ve got some empathy issues to work on. You probably don’t see anything wrong with ninja-looting, either, because “it’s just a game.”

I might just make this my desktop background.
---
You win some you lose some :) Sometimes you eat shit
---
Can't, too traumatized.
---
Well that makes me feel a lot better then.
---
Getting a mild turtle going is my favorite, good honor and rep. And even more if we manage a van kill, sometimes we even get a ice Lord summon!
---
I currently play on Mankrik. My guild wouldn’t even help a low level on an elite quest. Its nice some people in this community are actually still human
---
And that my friends is how you get an azuresong mageblade on loot council =P j/p enjoy your new laptop dude. Sorry for your loss.
---
Wow, what a meaningful and interesting point you raise. I never thought about it that way.
---
Newsflash: we are here for the rep, turtles are just wasting our time so why fight?
---
There's nothing true about that statement at all though.  There is no valid reason I can't hate another human that I know(which is what they meant by "seen") yet love god, that's idiotic bronze age circular logic.
---
Im not crying, you are
---
Ya, every mob that does give some exp.  The gnolls give like 10 each, some bosses gave 50exp I think.  It adds up to a couple hundred each run even if you're not trying to get exp.
---
Then they made DM where you can solo every boss by wall glitching.
---
Hey I hope so.
---
And that's basically all they can do, some people here want instant changes but there's also players who don't and who are enjoying it being messed up for a bit. 
---
If blizz decided to just whole sale change parts of the honor system they'd have just as many, if not more, people leaving for good to go back to pservers because they want the systems as they were in vanilla warts and all.
---
they're only in your mailbox for 24 hours, which means you either use the ones you have within that timeframe or lose the ones in the mail. They were accidentally set to 30 days, which they've come out and said was a mistake and have since changed them to the intended 24hour expiration time. Best bet is to just use them so that none are wasted, unless you really don't care about rep or honor
---
right, rogue has a few too I believe.
---
ofc, people that would roam around all day wanted honor, how can they compete with the absurd honor AV gives
---
Experience. With 5-6 lvl 60 buffs it’s actually good exp.
---
Plus, There are rarely ques except raid day, no more layers, and wow census sites show a massive drop off. You’re right, classic isn’t going anywhere. That’s the issue.
---
Our guild has a left and right binding... on two different tanks group 1 and 2 got a piece.
---
Nobody will do Wpvp from this point forward except griefers, trolls and bored casuals.
---
Its the way it was and always will be.
---
I think accepting "spreading positivity does good" is an awfully simplistic view of things.
---
Flying mounts kill the "having to react to an enemy player unexpectedly" aspect of wPVP. BGs remove the incentive to form roaming gank squads which I'm totally on board with.
---
"Hey bro, I know you're addicted to this game and it's destroying your life, to the point where you literally can't afford to play the game and everything in life is telling you that you NEED to move on and fix your life instead of playing a stupid fucking game, but here, we got you more time on the game."
---
I assume you mean for PVE? Do you have Edgemaster's? If not, probably Unstoppable Force. Fishing for WF procs with Hamstring isn't my favorite, but it is workable. If you're talking for PVP, go 2H Arms.
---
Don't worry after a week most people will be gone after exalted
---
I dont think you understand the honor system bro.
---
About 50/50. It either happens, or it doesn't
---
Except that I queued as premades on Vanilla with preform av enabler. And that worked in 9/10 cases.
---
Hey it's me your GM
---
congrats dawg
---
I am just curious, but does anyone know why our paladins logs are allways terrible? Like all of them rank bot 15% every fight except like one where they are about 50%.
---
People are not dying and raids are going well for a casual guild so I am not complaining, but it is just odd to me. Do people run fewer healers (we usually run 9-10 with 4 palas) or is our priests heal tanks more or what?
---
Every game I have ever played is the same, always starts with positivity and the this game is the best game ever hype, then the hype dies and the game either dies out or gains an unruly following in which everybody is voicing their opinions about the things they dislike because they want the game to work their way.
---
I don’t think either side really has a winning move whatever developers do is going to puss somebody off and if communities don’t give feedback then the problems never get resolved and the game will eventually die. I think the issue may be the way people communicate in reddit it is hard to express yourself using just words which I think leads to a lot of things being misinterpreted. I am yet to find developers who seem consistently open and honest with their communities and keep the discussions progressing for the better.
---
That’s insane. Thanks for the edited vid...and thanks for using all 40 peoples’ luck up for the foreseeable future. :)
---
-Snowiest
---
no, not quite..
---
Kills give Rep. Farming alliance gives Rep.
---
Nothing to do with being level 60, and everything to do with the popularity of AV since it just came out and people are grinding for rewards.  In the time it takes to level 54 to 60, at least some of that novelty will wear off.  I'd suggest riding the wave of popularity while you can.
---
Situations like this aren't super common(where a guild want's 100% wisdom uptime) so I can't really say, I'd just ask your guild for advice in what else they need.
---
yeah i'm having so much fun lmao.  IG people are pretty nice.
---
Sorry you feel this way. As frustrating as phase 2 has been, classic has been everything I wanted it to be and more. It's been fantastic. Most of my friends ended up on different servers due to the queues following launch day, and I ended up going mostly solo. Along the way I made new friends, ended up in a great guild, and found a raid team to call home. I look forward to logging in every day and kicking it with the new homies I met along the way. I never had this experience during the original game, and this is the most fun I've ever had on a computer. I know that ultimately we'll run out of content and things to do, and this will all be temporary. So I'm enjoying every minute of it while it lasts. I got Kel'Thuzzad in my sights and my guild and raid team are chomping at the bits to get there.
---
Still yet to see one yet
---
Use Arcanist Crown, wrist and boots
---
Most i've seen in a run so far in classic has been 3, last 2-3 runs I did (before honor patch) i didn't see any. I don't think it's been nerfed i just imagine you are getting unlucky with rng.
---
Do I need to link you some?
---
Its a metaphor, not a literal statement.
---
You guys are awesome!
---
AFK AV pales in comparison to premade AV (yes, you can reliably premade AV).
---
It's like 9k honor/hr vs 20k. All the top rankers are in AV premades in my server
---
This is an alcoholic that ran out of money because they spent it all on booze, only instead of getting them the help they so desperately need, his friend bought him a case of Jameson.  Just lookin out for you buddy!
---
Hey I’m DirtyDale! TF here we come. Thanks &lt;HIVE&gt;!!!
---
As soon as you’ve been in your first epic AV battle you wish they *all* could be epic AV battles. Great vid.
---
What’s wrong with large corporations? They make the best consumer products. Are you against....products? What phone do you use? What computer?
---
We only had one crafter on our server, someone I know paid 1200g for their helm (with their own mats)
---
Truth. I've played WoW since Vanilla, majority of the time continuously through expansions after expansions and I've never been lucky enough to find a guild that is tightknit like this one. Most guilds I've been a part of end up dying or falling apart due to irl issues. I'm glad communities like this exist, but why can't I find one. Lol.
