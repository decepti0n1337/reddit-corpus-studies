I like you *also*, didn't address government healthcare rationing.

---
Thanks for proving my point bud. Lemme know when your government decides grandma isn't worth keeping alive üëç.
---
---
---
It was an exaggeration, but my point is that in *Classic WoW* of all things, it shouldn't be looked down upon to take your time and enjoy things at a slower pace.
---
They hated him because he told them the truth
---
Don‚Äôt hold your breath :( 
---
I did the same. I‚Äôve been looking forward to playing classic since many years before the announcement. I didn‚Äôt even get to reach 60 god damn it!!
---
**Do it under 30 days now :p**
---
Agree with Achievements. Loved taking a break from leveling or raiding to work on some of the more tedious ones like /love all the critters.
---
Damn dude, that's tragic. you think you'll be alright?
---
What is this contract you speak of?
---
I still dont get why what other people do impacts you. 
---
If content is there that you dont want, then you dont have to play it.  However there are people who want it, so why should they have to wait for content you dont want to/cant access anyway?
---
You dont have to rush, you can still take your time,....
---
I was 60 1 week after the release and even though we rushed it hard, I enjoyed it as well. With that said, we were 5 man at lan party for that entire week which brought the amusement up alot :)
---
But when I chose to lvl my alt up(48 now), I did it the classic way and I enjoyed it just as much if not more, to just chill and play the game as supposed to without stress is a relief. But being 60 as fast as we did, gives you perks that other won't have in terms of farm and AH control :)

why is everyone always killing gamon??

You can make a macro for it I believe, I played hunter in vanilla and remember having one that would cast hunter‚Äôs mark and send my pet owl Peepers into the fight at the same time.
---
I didn‚Äôt play classic but came back to my sub to try. Maybe I‚Äôm just a quitter (lol) but seeing how fast everyone else is blowing through the content and already getting full sets of tiers and weapons while I‚Äôm struggling like dead ass struggling to level keeps putting me off from playing. Leveling is very slow when you can only play an hour or two a day it starts to feel not worth it if you also want to play at max level. It just shows me that I don‚Äôt have enough time for the game and maybe retail is meant for people like me who just wants a quick game here or there. 
---
Guess I‚Äôm not a mmorpg guy anymore idk

Wanting to hide your talents from other people is actively trolling honestly.

Duuuuuude(or dudette) how could I forget about necros and DF!! Great times :D
---
Okay I'm going to need this explained to me.
---
So-called casuals are asking for the releases to not come out faster than they did in vanilla.
---
By doing this they are somehow doing what turned the game bad?  They literally just want the release schedule to be realistic and not faster than it originally was.
---
Hard pass on Horde. :)
---
I‚Äôll take a look at Westfall tonight. Went to look at server loads a while ago and now a bunch just say Layered. :/
---
I can't tell whether to keep leveling my hunter (40) or start anew with a druid... I know I like dungeon healing in classic (on a priest alt, at least), but I didn't like raid healing in retail and I suspect it would be the same here. I love retail feral but I know in classic it's very different and much more simple - same with hunter, which I've also raided on in retail. I usually like ranged dps more than melee but I'm not a fan of casters. There are pros and cons to both classes and I'm just completely torn, they come out kind of equal. Suggestions/considerations?
---
Yes.
---
That's part of the charm to classic. There will be dicks, and there will be awesome people.    
---
There will be entire groups who know what they are doing, and there will be learning experiences.    
---
Using chat to find people, and put together a group requires you to let each other know your expectations for the dungeon, ask for help, share tips etc. Then you go to the dungeon, possibly fighting the other faction or waves of elites just to get it. You grind through the dungeon and complete it, maybe wiping a couple times, and it feels like an accomplishment.    
---
Sometimes things won't work out but there's no good without the bad. With out the bad everything else is just...expected, mediocre, par for the course. Clearing a dungeon becomes just that.    
---
    
---
If you have everyone sitting in cities waiting for a tool to put them in a group and a pop up to click to get you inside the dungeon, you lose so much of that. As soon as there is any sign someone might die or the group might wipe, people either quit and port back to the city to find a new group, or kick some one out and port someone else in. There's no need for the group to talk or work things out, there's no commitment to the group. When forming a group isn't a chore, the group doesn't try. The first sign of having to put in more effort than someone thinks they should, they bail and try to find something easier. And all the while, since everyone is just sitting in a city waiting for the tool to find a group, there are so much less people outside doing things while they form groups.    
---
I can get why some people would rather have the LFG tool, the reasons are valid. To me, I don't want it. To me, it makes for a very different game. And I know a lot of people agree. We just want a game where the LFG doesn't exist.    
---
And that is my dissertation on LFG
---
Some guy came up to me earlier and demanded 5 silver so he could buy his skills. Got really shirty when I told him to grind a few humanoid mobs for it. I‚Äôm amazed how some people can approach one with a rude, expectant and unapologetic manner and expect to get what they want.
---
Even so. It would take a major portion of the western player base to depart to make enough of an impact to go against China here.
---
Except for, you know, the HK farmers camping BRM on reset night.
---
It took me a bit to get it and only thanks to your comment :D
---
I agree, but there's a difference here. We can easily stop playing WoW and find other games to play. However, you can't stop eating food or wearing clothing, for example. And the food and clothing that is made ethically is often way more expensive, so even if you wanted to support it, many simply can't, and a lot of ethical brands are just lesser known/smaller brands of the bigger companies, so you're still supporting them. Doesn't really make you a hypocrite; we have to live in the world we live in... until people actually start trying to change things, which a lot of people are weirdly against. Unfortunately, there's no ethical consumption under capitalism. Don't call these people out for doing what they can do under the system.
---
I literally just gave you an example of how it can affect someone who doesn't rush. I don't personally care that much, I was just pointing out that there are some effects.
---
You can‚Äôt get it without a group.  All the other stuff you can mine or herb solo.  Everyone rolling is the norm.  If you think only skinners get it that‚Äôs fine discuss it with the group leader/group before it starts maybe they don‚Äôt care.  Whenever I lead groups in vanilla there was maybe once or twice someone wanted to reserve it (before the run started) and I would just boot them out and tell them to run it solo then.  And when the runs over if there were ‚Äúno skinners‚Äù I would boot everyone ‚Äúwaiting around‚Äù to prevent them from going back to the corpse solo.
---
This. Blizz plz.
---
Actually super easy on a priest, easier than a warlock IMO. Facetank goblin with a shield and do priest things. Princess you kite the same as a warlock and proc her dust field with a shield rather than VW.
---
If you do that in a solo pull, fine, but it is the wrong way to play in a 5 man dungeon.
---
YOU might not find it a problem, however you are making your tank's and healer's life more difficult that it should be.   The tank wont have as much rage due to not being hit due to you pulling aggro.  
---
You think you are being super pro with your novas and COC dont you?  Position those mobs right where you want them then blizzard away... you need to understand HOW BAD THAT IS!  ITS FKN BAD BRO.  REALLY BAD.  DONT.
---
You are screwing up the group placement that the tank is trying to achieve.  He is trying to group up mobs in a tight group in a specific spot and you just go an freeze them all over the show.  Now they can't all hit him as they are frozen out of range, costing the tank rage.   Less rage means less damage means less threat means the DPS can do less damage.
---
You wanna be a good mage in a regular 5 man?  focus fire the goddamn skull.  You wanna aoe farm then thats a different dungeon group with a specific purpose and play style and consequently tank style and requirements.
---
So while it seems from your perspective as if you are doing a great job, being and effective mage and blah blah, as someone who has played for countless hours as a mage and a tank, you are not.  You are the second worst kind of mage, the worst being one who does exactly what you do but starts even earlier.
---
You positive they're not using stormstrike?
---
it really dont matter when you think about it since i was willing to roll with the skinners? so its actually the exact same result. Peoples greed made it what it was.

Looking good man! Congrats. I really like it.

I'm still stuck deciding what I want to play highest level I have is 13 lol

As a part time investor with a bit of atvi stock...  BLIZZARD STAY OUT OF POLITICS YOU DUMB SONS OF BITCHES.

Okay well after years of waiting for WoW Classic I'm now deleting my account. Disappointing but even more disappointing is that Blizzard would do something this... well, evil. Really not a good look for them at the very least.
---
I buy Warlock services

yea it's not really Classic when Blizzard of 15 years ago wouldn't have bent the knee to China like this

Okay high school seems plausible. Most adults will avoid getting into physical altercations and this is someone who boxed for 13 years and taught for 3.
---
OMG so much clicking happens on this toon.
---
I just did it too, thanks for putting the idea in my head. It's not much but it was the right thing to do.
---
Rogue is unfortunately one of the only classes who can‚Äôt farm DM effectively
---
Same boat. I play after the kid is in bed, it sort of replaced Netflix or wasting time on Reddit. You just have to change your goals, rather than end game - it's just the game. I may never actually hit 60 in reality, and that's okay. Classic is much more suited to the idea of the journey not the destination
---
Flying mounts are by FAAAR a much larger aspect that limits social interaction and leads to empty worlds...pretty sure walking to a dungeon is pretty far down on that list.
---
I mean, if you like dungeon finder then retail is still there waiting for you at no additional cost.
---
Classic is for everything but dungeon finder and small raids.
---
Fuck anyone of you who still support blizzard
---
Yeah for sure!
---
Enjoy it at your pace, but don‚Äôt limit other people‚Äôs content releases if you decide to be slower than the average player
---
The general consensus is to keep your pet on passive, and I have /petattack macro'd to some of my abilities that I'm only casting on my focus target (hunter's mark is a great example), or I just have it keybound to something on its own that I can hit while I start to cast other shit. Leaving pet on defensive can be handy when just questing though... saved me a couple times while afk or pulled a mob off me when I was just trying to run by and ignore it.
---
HOLY DAMN GOD that took me like 15 minutes to get it !!!

thank me later :D

Id be willing to bet most players want them to rush to phase 3 for battlegrounds.

No one is mad about this because they hate China as a country. It's about capitulating to foreign pressure to censor players speaking out about human rights abuses.

Transmogs. As a lvl 50 lock I still haven't completed my Enchanted gold bloodrobe, and probably never will. It would just take up more of my limited inventory space. I would love to be able to wear it, along with my growing collection of other unique, awesome looking outfits, but I won't ever get the chance.
---
Many reasons. 
---
You have more interaction between higher and lower level players. 
---
Lots of world PvP battles are born from multiple opposing groups both making their way to a dungeon. This is really fun for some people. 
---
It makes the world feel a lot more alive, seeing players in transit to their dungeons. More people on boats, more people riding through towns, more people you pass on the roads. The general feeling of a living community that you actually get to SEE. 
---
You have classes like Warlocks that have teleport, being able to teleport party memebers makes them so useful. 
---
Mounts. It makes mounts so much more important and you get a much greater sense of reward from obtaining one. Not to mention, it makes Paladins Warlocks, Druids, Shamans and Hunters more useful because of their mobility talents. 
---
It also changes the dynamic of dungeons. When groups are harder to find, and dungeons harder to get to, PEOPLE DON'T QUIT! If its easy to start a dungeon it's easy to quit one.
---
Never said I tested it. I was just looking at my combat log to see how I died so fast. And a warrior crit me for a buttload....I also remember when the bug was reported and the following hotfix. I just don't want to do research. Feel free to believe it's still broken and that's why priest are unfair

Seems the only real advantage Druid has over Hunter for you is the fact that you can heal 5 man Dungeons. Eventually, you won't be doing much of that. If you enjoy ranged DPS and not caster, you are describing a Hunter.

Anyone remember back in the prime WoW years when vanilla-wotlk was our people would constantly be wondering what would be the ‚ÄúWoW killer‚Äù? Turns out it was blizzard and their greed all along, to me that‚Äôs poetic justice. It‚Äôs really sad to see what the company turned into though, they were one, if not *the* most player friendly company back in the early days. How times have changed. Once MoP came out I knew right then that they were catering to the Chinese market and would start bending over backwards for them so I cancelled my sub before mop came out. Fuck you blizzard
---
Yea... I havent gotten home to do it yet but... even thinking about this being the real good bye hurts. It's just a stupid fucking game but goddamn a game that's been with me through high school, through failing college, through every relationship. WoW was the only thing that persisted for that long in my life. I never thought it would end this way. I figured the game would always just drift further away from what I loved and I would eventually just no longer be on, no longer interested. I never imagined it would be something like this.
---
I like thinking about how worked up people get.

Dear Target,

Fuck you for cancelling my pre order days before it was supposed to ship

It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that McDonald‚Äôs was well aware that they were serving coffee at dangerous temperatures. There were multiple injuries to employees and guests, complaints that it was too hot, and it was being served well above their standard operating procedure and training manuals stated. This wasn‚Äôt a matter of ‚Äúoops I spilt hot coffee on myself‚Äù it was a matter of something being negligently served after it was known to be dangerous.
---
The woman also originally was seeking just her medical bills (I believe $6,000). McDonald‚Äôs ran such a great PR campaign around it that people still view it as absurd law suits all this time later.
---
Dude I feel ya. You will get there though and it feels great. I‚Äôve been playing for about an hour a night once kids go to bed. Gotta be up very early so I just can‚Äôt stay up and grind like I used to. Now on Fridays and saturdays late nights are a must lol. I don‚Äôt think I will ever raid though. Truly just in it for when BG‚Äôs come back.
---
Ey listen im all for the illusion of freedom but none of this has anything to do with blizzard, if they wanted to get involved they would have payed someone to write up a speech and got an attractive inoffensive person to read it on a nice expensive set right?   or got all the staff armed up with armalite rifles and thier massive .223 rounds and invaded china themselves lmao.
---
my point is blizzard was trying to host a hs event and not get involved, im all for the protesters and wish them all the best and hope no one ends up getting hurt, but its totally irrelivant, blizzard didnt want in, this guy got them involved and he got the boot.  i dont understand why everyone on here is saying about quiting wow over it?

We have a 11 month old so my wife and I came to the agreement that we make time for each other in the afternoons/evening and I do the bedtime feeding and put the baby to bed. Then I game and she does the night feeding and morning feeding while I get us rdy for work in the morning. I stay up maybe twice a week late but work takes it out of me too.
---
Now I got a friend who his gf freaks out at him for staying up late on a waste of a time video game. While she's on her phone on Facebook. Idk how good the sex is but I'd show anyone to the door rather quick if they didn't give a shit about my hobbies

Why the ‚Äú(Insert Racial Slur Here)‚Äù tho

Point is you can say it‚Äôs happening all you want, but without video proof you just seem like a salty bastard cause you got killed
---
Toddlers and youngsters sleep 10-13+ hours a night and you'll easily find a 3 - 4 hour time slot for gaming if you want to. Make sure you work with the bedtime routines from an early age and put the kids to bed early, it's good both for them and you. Kids recommended bed times are well before raid times so it works out. Don't get the kids accustomed to staying up late and sleeping in, this is a terrible habit.
---
Babies and raids don't combine at all though because they sleep erratically and require constant attention. You'll need help from the other parent if you want to raid. But usually the other parent also wants to do "me stuff" every now and then. So you just help each other out like people should and you can raid every now and then.

Just cancelled mine :( I've played Blizzard games since Blackthorn and have played every game they've made. This is just getting to fucked up. Between this and the NBA, China is using it's economic might to for censorship onto America companies for even mention some of the worst civil rights abuses going on right now. It's not just Hong Kong. Between China's social credit system, government oppression, concentration camps and forced organ harvesting of prisoners, the capitulation of an American company for money is just too fucked up to ignore.

 It's the different problem -- not all political opinions are properly banned, as they should.
---
Magisters Terrace had loot that was incomparable among the 5mans dungeons. If there was loot you could equip from there, you wanted it.
---
This is not the case for Dire Maul. Admittedly none of the items from there are super badly itemized (some class trinkets are debatable), like many are in the base dungeons. However it doesn‚Äôt nearly validate the others, like Magisters Terrace did.
---
Mage water and class mounts are entirely irrelevant to the conversation, since it‚Äôs about people thinking Dire Maul‚Äôs gear is some massive nerf to the difficulty of MC/Ony.
---
You cant really deadzone in classic, I mean technicaly yes but the classic weapon leaway makes the gap really small where its possible.
---
TBC Heroic 5 mans. 
---
Making a super challenging, max level version of all the dungeons was a great idea for endgame replayability. 
---
Would have been amazing if they did this for every dungeon in Vanilla.
---
Well its back to Private servers for me. Free classic!
---
Honor kill.
---
It is not.  At all.  Drain Life is resource neutral if you're naked and unspecced until rank 4 where it becomes resource positive *baseline*.  Every point of spell power you have and every talent point that impacts it beyond that makes it more and more resource positive.

You know, I agree, and I say good for you... but nowadays it‚Äôs basically impossible to avoid companies that don‚Äôt value human rights. Clothing and shoe companies are the worst. Yes you can avoid them but so much if your food products come from countries or companies that have little value to human rights. Being extremely overworked for little pay constitutes in my opinion as a human rights violation. I am not saying to not cancel your wow sub... just saying that if you‚Äôre going to cancel it because of this, may as well go the extra mile and do research on the things you purchase so you can avoid helping the other companies screw over more human rights.
---
This but unironically

Not sure where you're getting this from? There aren't any dungeons that have a faction requirement to enter. A Horde player could enter Stormwind Stockade if they wanted to go to the effort of getting there. Are you talking about the portal in the very north of the Barrens at the border to Ashenvale? Because that is the portal for Warsong Gulch, a battleground, which isn't available until phase 3 anyway, and displays that message incorrectly (because it simply isn't available at current).

Huh, didn't think it'd work like an enchantment. But regardless, if you trust someone the mailbox option is super convenient.

Hes spamming anti China stuff and people reported him for spam. Banning him for chat for spamming not for what he spammed, but for it not being game relevant.
---
There are no instances that are restricted by faction, RFC, WC, Deadmines, and stormwind stockade, are somewhat restricted by location. But everyone can enter all of them if you can get to the portal.

Orc females have the best dance in the game.

I don't think "near" should be the requirement as the whole point of the channel being Global is so you don't have to be near a city but I do think if you're looking for a group or as soon as you join a group you should drop what you're doing and work your way to the dungeon.  Unless it's obviously going to take awhile before the group is ready but should still be ready to go at a moments notice.

"What-if"? Lol do you think healthcare rationing doesn't occur?

How many of you are going to stop paying your monthly subscription to Blizzard? If the answer is "not me" then you dont actually care about this situation.

Now try to understand that im using a broad statement that generalizes the vast majority of the current raiding population, im not saying pugs cant do it, its just highly likely that those groups will/are struggling.

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch?  I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and  I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Qaeda, and I have  over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the  top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just  another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes  of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking  words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the  Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret  network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so  you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the  pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I  can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways,  and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained  in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United  States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your  miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only  you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever"  comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your  fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the  price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will  drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo

Before it existed, now the internet has been wiped clean of it. By my understanding forbidden word style, like Winnie.

Damn some mad lad out here dishin out platinums. This is gonna hit bliz haaaaaard
---
Ah dude!
---
Lol. Health stones? Soul stones? Potential off tank for brief periods if needed? Varying types of damage? Different ccs that work off different gcds? 
---
Seriously warlocks beat mages at literally everything (damage, utility, and the ability to swap between burst and sustained dps) post phase 4 of classic all the way through retail. Mages are a joke and have the least amount of potential out of all the casters. But you're right, no reason to take a lock over a mage if they didn't have a summon. Lol Jesus Christ.
---
Only thing I can think of is you're trying to enter Warsong Gulch. Nothing else would say that. The level 20 isnt right though. Think its level 10.
---
My basic understanding is once it breaks combat they were able to interact with it before it ran back. Someome smarter than me can tell me I'm wrong.
---
Mats are selling well even if sometimes you list them higher than the lower price, it's the non-bis gear that barerly anyone buys, if you have generic "pants of  the monkey balls" even if it has something useful like frost damage it's hard to sell except if you put it for twice more than vendor trash in which case it's not even worth bothering listing it.
---
Yeah, that's a great argument. I guess we really do have different life experiences if you're equating people protesting for the right not to be thrown in a secret Chinese prison after a closed-door trial with people abusing retail employees because they're assholes.
---
Here's the thing. If they had just simply ignored it and let it go, much fewer people would've even been aware of it, and anyone who wasn't already interested in his position would've forgotten it by now.  
---
How much of an impact would that have had to their business? Next to none. Now? Social media is full of people posting about how they're cancelling their subscriptions and deleting all their Blizzard/Activision games.
---
Remember when nobody on Blizzard games subreddits gave a shit? I do, it was yesterday. Spare me your hypocritical ‚Äòthoughts and spirit‚Äô.
---
There will never be classic +, they could just release BC to make another bazillion of money, no need to produce a new game
---
Still going...
---
1. this dude wasn't an employee, so the whole "the next level also has responsibility" doesn't fly, because he's not under their supervision in the first place.
---
2. calling an interviewee saying something out of line a "corporate snafu" is more than enough to fully see how fucked up said corporation really is. 
---
 &gt;but don‚Äôt act like this is egregious
---
Oh yes it is. Don't *you* act like this is some common mishap. This is one of the largest players in digital entertainment siding with values that are the exact opposite of those of the country they come from. 
---
"Spineless" are maybe companies who sell out to Chinese investors without having a second thought. This is worse than that, this is exactly the kind of defeatist, no-morals, money-over-everything behavior that enables totalitarianism in the first place.
---
It's no more/less effort to type you're and your... You're the one being the asshole here making other people work hard to understand your communication.
---
People doing this everyday on incendius as well. Two gnomes were doing it I figured it was a glitch or maybe rep. I think the alliance lock and mage just farm rep then go abuse it if it works. 
---
But the funny thing is they were only standing in certain spots for the most part, including that very EXACT same area right outside the arena cage where the guy is standing in your video. Which makes me rethink it and think they are abusing some type of terrain / Aggro bugs idk. If so, definitely reportable offense.
---
Spoken like someone whos never played the game at a high level
---
No you are being toxic. They can play how they want. They got what they need on the action bar. Go outside.
---
It's up to each person whether or not ignoring is needless in whatever scenario. I've got plenty of people on my ignore list that earned their spots based on my own personal set of variables.  
---
There are plenty of people that will let me know within a couple of minutes that I shouldn't interact with them ever again. I see it like a kind of [Lemon Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon_law) for people.  
---
Whispering someone to give them shit or getting "the last word" after already ignoring them is childish behaviour though, that much I agree with.
---
Okay your right. So in keeping step with boycotting blizz i won‚Äôt buy food, electricity or drive a car. Wow i feel so enlightened already

as far as i know, last week (today is tuesday so the reset just happend)  only 2 raid groups went into MC this week on windseekr, one guild i will not even run 5 mans with their members, the other "guild" had 8 memebers along with the rest of pugs able to kill 2 bosses :) i can wait a few more weeks to find a guild and then a few more to help gear up nice guys/gals and find a home
---
Yeah. I feel like the horde alliance ratio on bigglesworth is way off when I go there. Always camped with horde. I had to go back at 51 and destroy my way to getting 10 ( I had gotten 4 from 3 different trips to check if it was camped.....it was) and even then 2 60s showed up to chase me off right after I got my last lesser

Epeen? Bro you're commenting on a 20 day old thread because you got butthurt about my comment. Clearly you're insecure about this and everything I said hit the nail on the head. Grow up you fuckin baby.
---
No, but can tell if a group is ready or not by the LFG message.  If its LF1M, they are probably ready to go so you shouldn't join if you're gonna make them wait 20 minutes.  If its LF4-2 more, you can join but make sure you get on your way to the dungeon so you'll be there by the time the group gets filled

Travelling in classic might take some time and quite often feel tedious, but I think it's a big part of making the World of Warcraft actually feel like a world.     
---
Retail might have so much more landmass, but the combination of extremely fast flying mounts, portals everywhere, and a flight point for every quest hub means most of it might as well not exist.
---
If you make mistake after mistake or just seem clueless people will often put you on ignore. Saves them time and effort because dungeons are somewhat of an investment in classic.
---
Seems like you have yet to meet a frost mage
---
I truly love you for making this post. This comment section is a goldmine.
---
Are these heathen gods?
---
What Blizzard did was shitty, but not any different than what other companies have been doing to appease China.
---
If you want to boycott China in support of HK, you would have to do a lot more than drop your WoW sub. Basically all of your entertainment caters to China. Most of your clothes and appliances are manufactured there too. Any of those companies would fire someone at the drop of a hat to appease the CCP.
---
It means the server still has layers. Blizzard started removing layers on some servers.
---
Enhancement wants all the chance to hit,  crit, and dodge it can get. We already have insane attack power with or without strength. Even with shitty weapons (obviously better weapons is even better dps)
---
My point is that you're a hypocrite.
---
I didn't even realize it wasn't a screenshot until I saw all the QQ about it.
---
Layered means the realm has just 1 layer in prep for world events.
---
Other servers still have layers - means there could be 2-3 instances of a zone running at the same time.
---
I don't worry about it too much considering if you raid and you're max level, all future content will be cleared Day 1 and people will be begging for P5/6 to come out fast. The only issue anyone has with these phases is not being max level yet (mind you, I've only got 1 level this week...)
---
I would, personally, be quite sad to see all phases not out yet by August next year. More currently, though, I want P1-3 out immediately because PvP. The rest can slow down, imo.
---
It doesn't matter anymore, i already cancelled due to their censorship. It was really fun but the future of blizzard games died today.
---
You want me to google it for you? Lol?
---
&gt; Also, is rationing exclusive only to government funded, or government run healthcare? If so, why?
---
And you also want me to explain the difference between market competition and an incentive free service exclusively provided by the government?
---
Bud, go back to school.

---
No king rules forever
---
Too many people are blinded by retail. Content does not get outdated in vanilla. MC and most raids for example will be run for the vast duration of classic. 
---
Infact coming in late is probably more beneficial as you'll gear up far quicker due to less competition.
---
He's not an employee,  he's a competitor. He in no way represents blizzard.  Your argument is invalid.
---
Started with around 14k rep left to go, the rest was from quests while leveling... so yeah :')
---
Yes, but even classic on 10 is still noticeably different from retail.  Not just models, but world textures too.
---
&gt;Sunday night we downed the final boss of this wave of content
---
I'd take it easy with that #1 stuff...pugs are killing rag all day for a couple weeks.
---
No it's not, it's how some people play.  Lots of time is lost doing other things like exploring, PvP, making groups, chatting to people, reading quest texts, searching for things in the world.
---
The reality is that not everyone cares about levelling quickly or efficiently.  They are happy to cruise along at their own pace.  This is an alien concept to a lot of people who are quite focussed on levelling quickly to get it over with, or whatever it is.
---
20 days played with half of it spent not actually earning any XP is fairly reasonable.  I'm sure some of my mates will take even longer and you know they are probably enjoying the game more than most people
---
???
---
Purchasing things made in China is absolutely not a statement on censorship.
---
I'm not going through your post history, I'm sorting by "New" in this thread and seeing you leave the same brained reply on every post.
---
&gt;By the way, anyone who is 60 right now is not casual let‚Äôs be clear about that.
---
Seriously. I actually have a decent amount of extra time and I'm not even level 40 yet; literally just turned level 37 yesterday. So, if people made it to 60 already or in the first week (did they even leave the computer), that's not casual by any stretch of the imagination.
---
Er... they wrote that people with busy lives can be 50+ by now which set you off on your rant about how busy you are only to say you're level 54. So what you're saying is yes?
---
Yup, plus your opener is probably cheapshot, so 2 second stun plus combo points for instance slice and dice that'll last through to enemy death.  Means you're taking less damage and need to bandage/eat less often, thus less downtime.
---
About 1.4g/stack on my server, so its an additional say 60% cost, but its worth the investment imo to get a tiger over my paladin mount.
---
I cannot get in the game my server isn't displayed and i've tried everything.  Not sure why I've looked at twitter and on their news, nothing.
---
I unsubscribed, but they will not let me delete my account! After one try with sms code (I entered it correctly and quickly), email (again, correctly and quickly), secret question (correct), I was told that was too many times for each method. it was just one time each! I was about to scan my ID when my wife pointed out they probably want that on file. Holy crap, this is fucked. I'll call them up tomorrow.
---
In the good ol'days, priests would hide on the huge chains above the lava surrounding the molten core entrance, MCing people to the glorious dive into fiery death...

---
Yea. Had a feeling I spelled it wrong lol
---
... is it not normal for a bank alt's funds to fluctuate this much?
---
I'm so disappointed in blizzard. I've supported them for years and years, since I was a kid. Through a whole lot of drama. If I hadn't won some game time through my guild I would absolutely not play WoW until they remedied this; but I didn't pay for my current game time so I'd feel awful to waste it. But man, I really don't feel like playing right now. I'm so disheartened. And knowing blizzard they will sweep it under the rug and hope people forget about it, because that's what they always do.   
---
I just want them to apologise and re-instate the guy and give him his prize money. I don't usually call for companies to apologise because I think it's dumb in most cases, but this time it'd be warranted. I don't even have the energy to get angry at this point. I just feel sad.   
---
Yeah yeah yeah blitzchungHS broke the hearthstone streamer rules or whatever. Normally I'd agree that yes, it's on him for that. But like, this is a bigger issue than just a game. This is to do with freedom and specifically freedom of speech. Blizzard is bowing to China for the money, and don't care about the actual people who are being affected by China trying to control everything, even international. It's an issue of human rights, not just a slip-up in an e-sports match.
---
&gt; Millions do have a choice, and they choose to stay. China isn't North Korea. Business is business and if you don't do business with Chinese people you are only hurting people, not the regime. The entire world could stop doing business with China and the regime will stay.
---
Hahaha.  Whatever helps you sleep at night.
---
Here, I did some research for you.
---
I liked this tidbit from the Wikipedia article:  [Healthcare rationing in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_rationing_in_the_United_States) is largely accomplished through market forces, 
---
How again is it exclusive to government funded healthcare, if the private US healthcare system encounters it?
---
Oh I have not tried it yet. Been too busy unfortunately. I'll let you know if I do end up figuring it out. If you Google Moonlight ConsolePort WoW there are people talking about their setups but none really talking about how they got the controller working.
---
imagine having friends lol
---
HEY!
---
Sometimes they should be playing fortnite
---
Over the years a lot of people, including myself, wanted at the very least to have the option to play the hunter class without a pet while still being viable.
---
Over time as talent trees grew more and more, so did the specs grow apart in playstyle. By the time of Mists of Pandaria all three hunter specs felt different enough but still resembled each other a lot - Survival was focusing on Dots from Explosive arrow (burst damage with short dot), Black Arrow (taken from WC3 dark rangers just without the add), Viper Sting (every spec still used it) and I believe immolation trap. BM, well, was still focused around pets mostly. And MM was just a weird amalgamation at that point centered around aimed shot. Heck, the class even got their big cooldown in the form of stampede at that point which summoned all  your callable pets. By MoP you were able to have up to five pets with you of which only one could be active.
---
WoD then had the infamous first batch of "pruning" but also helped distinguishing the playstyle a bit more, hence MM being slowly turned into the petless spec. 
---
And then came Legion, where, after 12 years Blizzard decided to give every spec a clear identity (which failed in quite a few cases of course). BM stayed the pet spec, with the idea revolving around the usual very simple playstyle and constantly calling forth random animals while buffing your pet with bestial wrath etc. Short cooldows but constant damage.
---
MM got turned, more or less, into the "sniper" spec. Relatively immobile for the hunter class at that point and focused around "exploiting weaknesses for big aimed shots". 
---
And then survival. Blizzard apparently wasn't happy anymore that it was a very mobile DoT spec. So they turned it into a melee spec, which, during Legion, was actually tied as one of the specs where you have to invest anti-proportional amounts of time and skill to even see remotely decent rewards in terms of damage, together with Feral druids of course. Initially shunned, it was during the Nighthold world first race where I believe Nnogga from Method played a SV hunters, after which a lot of people flocked to the spec only to drop it after seeing how unforgiving the spec was.
---
And yet again with BFA both SV and MM were changed yet again. SV got simplified in order to make it accessible while MM moved away from the vulnerability debuff.
---
Literally the opposite.  Layered means.....wait for it.... it has layers.
---
Just make your own groups of ppl who cant roll on it , im a cloth wearer when im farming gear i just dont let any cloth in ,, simple lol i get all my gear in 2 runs if lucky on drops xP
---
Well you should have told the Paladin tanks that I did UBRS, BRD and UD Stratholme with. They did especially well in UD Stratholme with their abilities that only target undead. This one pally tank in UD strat didn‚Äôt even need to stop for mana breaks and I have never had a faster or smoother UD strat one then that. But hey if you rather keep waiting in LFG for a warrior tank to show up that is your loss.
---
There's a blue post about this.
---
**TLDR** If a server had a low enough population to permanently turn of layering they were and their population value reflects that. For servers currently too large or who are otherwise still using layering their population value is "layered" to reflect that reality to make clear for new players that a certain server is still large enough to need and implement layering.
---
because..... we can?
---
You kind of missed the point, but whatever. It's not really a big deal.
---
kurzen npcs are pretty easy to kill if your class has a kick
---
What? People grind or quest while looking for dungeons so this is not a very reasonable request.
---
Every group I've joined or made we all joined and then made the trip. I've never been LF1M standing at or near the dungeon door unless someone bailed.
---
Username checks out
---
They didn't need to get involved.  They could have let the guys comments go away with the wind.  Ignored them. Instead,  they chose a side, politically. This is on blizzard. Life's not about money,  and we shouldn't excuse them as if it is.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs why I usually stay away but those who chose to do it chose to do it. It doesn‚Äôt diminish the fact they need a group of people to kill the beast as the first step to getting this drop. But the skinner is required to actually get the drop. I come down on giving the skinner a high probability of walking away with it but it also seems like they are profiting off a group effort. So I feel like that should be reflected in some chance of winning for everyone else. Oddly enough I change my mind again if someone needs it instead of selling it. I think that plays in too. It‚Äôs tough I‚Äôm not sure what the right answer is.

There's an add-on called booty bay gazette that tells you the price of everything on your server and also in the whole US.
---
I don't think OP ever said DM release was an issue. He was mostly speaking about pacing for future releases.
---
Wow. Next level strats
---
That's the joke.
---
&gt;Do you think no layering will be the ultimate goal? 
---
They have said all layers must go before they roll out P2 world pvp/world bosses.
---
&gt;If so, when do you think new servers would be coming?
---
They are expecting player bleed to take care of that. There will be almost certainly no more servers going forward. There are still servers that need population to fill up right now.
---
&gt;My bet is when the first phase launches they'll probably release a few because battleground PVP
---
Battlegrounds aren't coming with P2. They could be 3-5 months away easily.
---
Deleted my blizzard account cat ya not getting a single cent from me ever again.

&gt; As someone who really won‚Äôt take shit about my behavior without real good reason, I gotta tell you you need to re-evaluate your idea of a partner.

What, did your terrible wife make you say that?  I can just see her standing there right behind you making you do it.  Man, you are _whiiiipped_.

He looks salty too

The quest gives you a box you open, that contains those.

Classic only needs a potato to play on max... jokes on you!

You should delete your account like everyone else

I've seen a LOT of items at 5 copper over vendor price, or 5% UNDER vendor price. Not worthy my time to flip them due to how saturated the market is, but I'll 100% buy it and vendor it.

---
Doing my part to stimulate the economy.
---
Well, I was having fun with WoW Classic, guess I should stop playing then. Liberate Hong Kong
---
F
---
And I'm pretty sure they said that everyone that is layered just has two.
---
All I‚Äôm saying is that people cancelling subs does matter, it affects their bottom line. I don‚Äôt expect their next few quarters to be bad, but I don‚Äôt see how you can dismiss people‚Äôs actions as useless when there are certainly people at blizzard that care about a ‚Äúmeasly‚Äù few hundred k. Whether the net effect to earnings over time is positive by siding with China or not, remains to be seen but I‚Äôm betting not.
---
It's a portal behind Hammerfall that I tried to enter.

I'm shocked and appalled by his response to me.

He's either Chinese or incredibly stupid.
---
The games been out for like 5 weeks, new people are still starting every day, and we are only in Phase 1 of a 6 (?) Phase content release plan.
---
The majority of players seem to be in the high 40s/ early 50s. Plenty of time.
---
When I was playing Vanilla as a kid, I didn't hit 60 until right before AQ released, and still had plenty of people to do dungeons with, and had plenty of wPvP encounters. Classic servers hold several more players than Vanilla ones did.
---
You're not missing out on anything.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm topping dps at 46 over fury warriors at 53 and beating mages in AOE damage.
---
Its alright buddy i knew you wouldn't understand from the start.
---
people complaining about quest item drop rates when they don't realise these make you level the fastest
---
Because i want to get this item soon if prices are going to go up. I‚Äôm not a huge fan of gold farming but we‚Äôll see.
---
not possible on a priest sorry.
---
It isn't private anymore and man the top posts there right now are a real Riot

I just hate the noise. It's SO loud. Incredibly loud.
---
I'm also grinding Darn rep just to get something else.
---
Ah stinks that they're allowed to average like that.
---
Before canceling your accounts, go into the game and post at everyone there to delete their accounts too. Some people don‚Äôt look at reddit, this will increase the effect of this
---
r/outside
---
It's not like everyone's pre raid bis comes from a single dungeon. It's not like alts don't exist.
---
Cool story mate, say it as it is next time
---
The only important thing in my opinion in terms of how content should come out is raids and battlegrounds. Dire Maul is like whatever  But even still most people would clear the dungeons + raids just to do them and get important gear and work there way up.
---
I personally want time for world pvp before battlegrounds. But honestly if it all came out in the span of six months I wouldn't be disappointed. Because I don't want to wait too long for BGs and other content anyway.
---
I'm 8 days played in game and I'm starting slow down as it is.
---
Got it, thanks for clearing that up.
---
nah im here to talk about classic wow not how china treats its people
---
I only get cc on certain packs in ubrs, otherwise just zerg it down.
---
It doesn't drop agrro like feign death does so if you have a mob on you it won't drop its agro. Go read wowhead comments from actual vanilla and they say the same thing
---
Calm down. Play the game at your own pace.
---
I don't need these specs, but I mean... I *could* play anything on max.
---
What‚Äôs disgusting is that you think cynicism is productive instead of part of the problem. There‚Äôs an obvious chain from not purchasing products from organizations that take specific political stances to creating greater impact on the world. Discussion and awareness through forums is a real means that makes a real difference over enough people and enough time.
---
To put this another way: what *would* you consider to be something that someone in a western nation could do that would be helpful? Because clearly speaking out and creating a financial incentive for western companies to back Hong Kong is not doing it for you.
---
You think china gives a shit about public perception outside of china?
---
I still didn't know this and I played the entirety of legion. How did I miss this?

Yeah this is insane. It's literally two clicks.

This is whooshing way over everyone here.

Louie wont drink humans...

yet...
---
WHAT!
---
Cant seem to kill rotgrip, how do you get him done? And half the time I tried he pulls a hydra with him...
---
Almost every person that does this has that mentality of they are correct because they got the last word in.
---
It's extremely childish and common with the playerbase.
---
See someone advertising a ridiculously high price for something and tell them it's half of that on the ah? 
---
They ignore you and magically it's not true! 
---
These people will never listen to anyone else's opinion because inside their head they are always right.
---
That‚Äôs one of the best zones in the game.
---
That part of the episode had me dead lmao.
---
If you want to take on a warrior, use evasion immediately. Sure they can overpower but they can also only hit you once every 5 seconds.
---
People are asking for the healing addon not the bot.  No one goes looking for a bot that hasn't been useable in 15 years.
---
That‚Äôs why I sleep on a couch
---
#**"CHINA NUMBA WAN!!"**
---
&gt; i wasnt equating advertising a company to be like the problems of a dictatorship
---
I didn't say you were. I was saying that you were equating people protesting for the same rights and freedoms we enjoy with this hypothetical asshole employee who went around verbally abusing the staff at a shop he went to. 
---
You are, in effect, saying that you think that protesting for a democratically elected government and free speech rights is wrong. Blizzard, in disqualifying and banning this player (for not even being a protester but just saying "Hey, I agree with these protests") is effectively showing that they disagree with his statement of support, what the protests are for, and are siding with the opposition. 
---
&gt; also if you think that allowing thier brand to be politised would have no effect? 
---
A simple statement of "While we respect his right to have his own opinion, this is not the time nor the venue for expressing it. As a company, we choose not to directly involve ourselves in political matters, whether individual employees privately support these protests or not. Unfortunately, the competitor has violated one of the rules of this competition with his statement, and as such, has been disqualified from the tournament, forfeiting his prize. We strongly recommend that the competitor refrain from using official tournament streams for his political statements, and instead, use his private streams and social media accounts outside of competition. For the purpose of disclosure, Chinese media conglomerate Tencent is a partial owner of Blizzard-Activision."
---
There, simple, makes the point that it's because he broke a rule without looking like they're trying to silence the protesters and their supporters on behalf of the Chinese government. I believe that the majority of the people who are protest boycotting Blizzard now would have much less an issue with this.
---
Nochanges attitude works toward bugs as well, and sometimes it can generate even more bugs
---
These are my favorite replies!  Apparently you can't read an item description!  Thanks, you're right.  Now go trim your scraggly ass neck beard with your best in slot trimmer and be sure to equip your best in slot fedora before you go catch the bus to your best in slot job serving coffee to your best in slot customer base.  BeSt iN SLot!  Ravager spins you around, which I would know if I wasnt so fuckin dumb, but I dont know how it works because I cant read an item description!
---
100% ignore randoms messaging guild recruitment to me on my alts. Every time. "Hi, we are &lt;Big Cesspool&gt; looking for more members! We are looking to fill our ranks with literally anyone and will probably collapse on ourselves in phase 2! Pst for more info". IGNORED...
---
nah, im just here to discuss classic world of warcraft. and i seriously doubt many will unsub from this. not everyone uses reddit and doesn't share in the hugbox this website has going
---
I always make it a point to encourage tanks, including but not limited to OTPHJs.
---
What server are you on?
---
lol
---
&gt;  as that would be a form of exponential scaling]
---
Quadratic, but that's really besides the point
---
It is.  It's just one that most of us would agree on.  But it's still an opinion, and he hijacked someone else's platform to voice it.
---
Hit 54 ret and I feel absolutely defeated. No one wants to take me as dps to dungeons, I'm a nobody in a guild which only cares about their clique and I've hit this terrible phase where I'm just too low to find a zone to effectively grind out on my own.
---
People are too invested in min maxxing classic because it's serious business apparently.
---
Guess I'll just roll holy and bang my head against the wall with gogogo tanks again.
---
And? Fuck Blizzard for putting money ahead of morals.
---
Cant say I agree with "anything they want."  We do have international law, ya know?
---
Ahh I'd been wondering what kind of history happened between 2009 and now. Thanks for the update.
---
But you see what I mean right? Under all the varied pressures of expansions, userbase shift, changing technology, and trends in game design, these incremental changes made sense to the people who made them at the time they made them.  But to someone who hasn't seen the game in ten years, it's just as impenetrable as starting for the first time, but a little moreso because there's a way I *expect* it to work.  
---
But if I'd been playing nonstop for the last decade, I'd probably want more spec variety too.
---
Now that's a whole philosophy for living right there.
---
I laughed yesterday when someone made a post exclaiming layering was removed when I had just hopped to escape 60s camping.
---
Certain servers will have it for a long time because the population will always be big enough.
---
\#China: correct the mistake
---
Blizzard: \^ok, so sorry high lord

Human rights or WoW classic? The choice is obvious.
---
See y'all in dire maul!

---
If this gets removed, I'm sorry Mods. Guild plays both versions of WoW and I'd been trying to explain the RNG yell to those that don't. Thought it was funny and wanted to share it here. 
---
Long story short. I've been trying to explain how the RNG Gods listen to you if you yell to my guild. A lot of us play both versions, and so some knew what I was talking about others didn't.
---
During our raid last night, when we were on a break, people started to try it out. Some actually "yelled" in Discord (think saying AHHHH at the dentist). Some did "ahhh" and some did "AHH" with semi high rolls. 
---
I said, "Y'all are doing it wrong. It's like this." And it happened. A few seconds later one of the tanks copied what I did and got 100 too.
---
What's the possible bug here? Healing generates aggro
---
Cancelled my sub.
---
That's a great one!
---
I've always had a question about it. Is it useful at max level? As in, could you pop the active, and then swap in your combat robe without losing the buff?
---
If you think archage is even on blizzards radar you are sadly mistaken.
---
can make attempts at ZF when you hit 44 at least.
---
True enough. FUCK CCP
---
Then you either played on a dead server or misremember badly.
---
This absolutely.
---
I am still lvl 14 /shrug
---
I see the tabs but not my server (Netherwing)
---
It looks cool and that means more than stats.
---
Also canceled
---
Pah, rich spoiled brats that you are. An hacked TV remote is more than enough.
---
Honestly, having to navigate around the roads, caves, rocks and mobs that make up a zone really gives you a stronger sense of being in the world than flying over it. Fast or slow, when you have to actually *look* where you're going it keeps your mind in the context of an adventurer moving across a landscape. Flying your hovercraft and landing perfectly on top of quests and mobs breaks this immersion pretty handily. I found myself enjoying BFA zones simply, though not solely, because I was forced to navigate terrain to my destination, instead of mount, fly up high, point at destination, fly straight, then land down perfectly.
---
Are you putting the showtooltip bit as the very first thing in your macro?
---
Yeah, I had an asshat trying to beg 5g off me and when I walked away he started cursing at me.
---
The entitlement these drones think they have is mind blowing.
---
Yay fiery horse of dooooooom , grats x))
---
Man these low effort memes suck.
---
Bear and cat form also currently benefit from Mana Tide totem. They did not benefit from this in classic.
---
There must be something fundamentally wrong with how its coded.
---
Happened a total of 1 time for me.  
---
It almost never gets resisted and if you want to save the group from a pat you can't make it worse. If you don't do anything the pat will add. If you soothe the pat and it doesn't resist (90+%) the group is safe. On the off chance that the pat resisted you add, but you would have added anyway if you hadn't tried.  
---
For sneaking by a group the risk is admittedly higher but you should be on high alert anyway if you take a risky route where a misstep might add mobs, so if the soothe pulls it's like someone pulled on accident.  
---
All in all there are far more positives than negatives for using mind soothe.

Horde, Rattlegore. 
---
Super chill guild, many of us know each other IRL, and we'd like to include others into our shinanigans. We hang out in discord and anyone is welcome to join us, or just dungeon with us if you'd like.
---
While we do have aspirations to do raids, we don't have the numbers, and only our GM is 60 the majority of us are 40-50.
---
That said, we dungeon fairly often, and we ***love*** killing Alliance. Anywhere, any time, men, women, gnomes, we just love killing 'em.
---
If this is the ragtag group you want to join, whisper Gingerslayer for an invite, and a promise for great times.
---
Dude its just fucking dire maul calm down like lmfao wtf.
---
I have to hand it to you, man. Getting that bow is a *feat*. Back when it was OC, that was literally one of the hardest things I've ever done in the game solo. BraVO!
---
I hit 45 and sort of took a break due to burn out. I'll likely be doing 45-50 with full rested, and doing AH / alts in the meantime.
---
Getting past 40 just hit a lot of milestones, and not much to look forward to after. Seems like a natural lull.
---
with great power comes great responsibility
---
100% agree.
---
rip those without a guild tabard
---
It is every pull no matter if I wait 10 seconds or down ranked my spells.
---
build monkey king bar lol noob
---
That's my inspiration!
---
Shitty labor conditions

And censorship of foreign entities

Are different things
---
You can boycott (one company) over the latter without needing to boycott everything manufactured in a country over the former
---
I do not know how to make this more simple for you to understand
---
&gt; There absolutely is something to doing content when it is current.
---
But releasing dire maul does not change what content is "current"
---
It's 60. Had no problem getting a group while leveling. I've been to scholomance once and undead strat once. Hit 60 a week and a half ago.
---
Hearthstone player signs contract to, among other things, not rock the boat.

Said player is banned and his winnings are withheld.

Outrage/cancel culture "cancels" Blizzard.
---
Why slow down at all? It‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre going to be as behind as I am starting retail now after getting 60 in Classic (never played either game before). 
---
There‚Äôs going to be a ton of people left to play with.
---
Well shit. I just started playing wow classic a few weeks back. Never played wow before this so it's all new to me. I'm having a pretty good time and my one and only account a level 19 warrior is progressing nicely. 
---
Now I've cancelled my membership and have about 3 days left before it runs out.
---
I can't morally support a company that values money over human rights. 
---
It's a shame because I was enjoying the game.
---
Are you sure they're bots and not multiboxers?
---
You call retail players retarded, however you yourself are so fucking braindead that you don't even know how DM farming works, yet you feel like commenting dumb shit.
---
I want bg's already. I say hurry them up before I get to bored :(
---
Oh man, I'd almost forgotten that.
---
A lot of the UI improvements. And I don't mind the graphics but I would love to see an option to get rid of the distant fog and increase view distance.
---
Free Hong Kong. Fuck the Chinese bots.

No difference. 20ms is irrelevant in a MMORPG. If it was a FPS then that'd be different.

---
i dont buy chinese crap, lol youre literally defending it?
---
It is claimed [here](https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Attack-table#critical-strike) that the critical chance formula with agility included is BASE% + AGI * 0.05% + (SKILL-300) * 0.04% = BASE% + (AGI - 240 + 0.8 * SKILL) * 0.05%, which is just the formula given by u/shibboleth2005. From what I gather, you found that AGI going below the threshold doesn't reduce the crit chance, so you're suggesting that the actual formula against players is BASE% + max(AGI - 240 + 0.8 * SKILL, 0) * 0.05%.
---
Is this correct?
---
Best thing is to make outside life more exciting, force yourself to do things and eventually you'll just want to play less and some days not at all.
---
But how will they keep top tier no-life players engaged without fresh content!?
---
Oh that‚Äôs right those players played private servers for years without it.
---
My guess is blizzard saw a sub drop after month 1 and went oh shit better open up DM.
---
No ones gonna play that lmao
---
Don't you have an aoe fear, and a shield to dance into and pop shield wall to mitigate a rogues burst?
---
Haha. 
---
I used to main a warrior. Rogues were pretty much the only class I could consistently kill with ease. Dodge, overpower, dodge, overpower, etc. death of rogue
---
There was a great sale and I ended up with 64.  Or in virtual machines like a motherfucker.
---
Now, I gotta make sure the gold I buy is from Hong Kong.
---
I think that some updates should come sooner than others. Dire maul is hardly a major amount of content. It's a 5 man dungeon. If every patch is this fast there is an issue, but phase 2 is very content light. Pvp getting added cant come fast enough. Dishonorable kills make leveling much less trolly, and allow a major part of the game to have at least some point. 
---
BWL is massive, battlegrounds are really big. I'd love to see a long ish gap between 2 and 3, but releasing phase 2 fairly quickly is just fine.
---
You have to bounce around a lot in classic, if you try to stay in one zone you will quickly out level your quests. Plus there‚Äôs a lot of quest chains that start in weird places that are no where near the zone they go to. I used to be against guides but having done it without one in real vanilla and on private servers without one I said fuck it this time around. I‚Äôm amazed how many quest chains I didn‚Äôt know existed and how often the guide has me moving zones. I never run out of quests with it though.
---
I actually have no data on druids at the moment, my guy feeling is staves might have to be levelled but I‚Äôm not entirely sure.
---
At your levels it's pretty tough. You are lacking Sweeping Strikes, Whirlwind, Mortal Strike, and a couple other fun skills. Once you get these, you will want to take 2 mobs at a time for the aoe kills and it speeds up and becomes more fun. It's still tough to solo yellow quests, so I've either stuck to tanking dungeons, grinding green quests / mobs, or grouping up for yellow quests.
---
What? Is Dire Maul Phase 1 out now?
---
*Laughs in frost shock*
---
Isn't there a day or more cool down for each transmute? Would be one thing if you could buy all the Essence of Undeath for cheap then instantly flip them to water for profit. But only a few gold profit every day or so won't get your rich quick.
---
Legit have no idea how people hit 60 weeks ago. I‚Äôm 35 and want to off myself. And I‚Äôve played this game for years, got several glad titles, etc, do not exactly new...
---
You're mitigating their authoritarian behavor by normalizing corporate greed.
---
For someone crying about people not letting you play how you want, you seem to care awfully lot about how others play the game.
---
Yeah I believe I noticed that as well, in pve they don't really seem to target for mana burns anymore. Probably not fixed for pvp, but haven't tested recently.
---
I will say my biggest hesitation is the impact it will have on the economy this early in the game's lifetime. In OG Vanilla, nobody really understood the AOE farming and class solo potential for easy fast gold. This is going to inflate the fuck out of gold really early on, especially with the amount of capped mages we have currently.
---
Damn, Wikipedia. You really got me here.

Got [Ravager](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7717/ravager) waiting for me in the bank but my bro just mailed me [Fiery War Axe](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=870/fiery-war-axe)
---
Should I AH it for mount money and use ravager? Or pwn noobs with an epic axe for however long it'll last?
---
I have about 50g saved up for mount.
---
The warrior threat table is: damage done * 0.8 while in battle or zerker stance, and damage done *1.5 while in defensive stance.
---
If he is trying to just dps them down and keep them off of you outside of defensive stance, he will struggle to keep them all. If he is in defensive stance most of the time he should be able to keep them at least 90% of the time.
---
Pro tip for priest healers: don't power word: shield the warrior unless it's a life or death situation. Absorbs do not give rage to a warrior, and to effectively tank, they need that rage.
---
Same with me.  Lowbers is not a word while ‚ÄúUbers‚Äù is one so I say it as such
---
I'm playing my last days of WoW now, logged in at Orgrimmar@Herod, people talking about HK. Now disconnected from chat servers. What a coincidence.
---
Coming from a filthy horde!? It‚Äôs a never ending cycle of hate and both sides have contributed to it.
---
How much gold/time did it take you? I'm planning to do this at 60 aswell. Any guide to share or something maybe? :)
---
What part did I not understand? Undercutting by 10% is never (very few exceptions) a good idea.
---
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand this mentality of just because something didn‚Äôt effect me that no one else could possibly have a different viewpoint.‚Äù
---
Thanks for the info, came back to the game after a long long time off and had no idea what to make of this.
---
So this is fine, huh.  Guess I need to read up on multiboxing.
---
Thanks!
---
Allegedlys
---
Hey you'd probably know this -- was weapon damage...universally reduced at some point? I noticed the dps on everything in my inventory seemed strangely low.
---
I assume it's made up for by a stat-based mechanic or something.
---
I guess that makes sense. Money drives the game.
---
It‚Äôs sentient, but not too smart. 
---
Also on their land. So it gets the axe.
---
Just wait until you fight t3 locks.
---
Kids are addicted because parents dont pay attention to there kids, park them infront of a computer game to distract them then whey they finaly want there kids attention to for there kid to do somthing else they didn't disaplin them or teach them that binge playing games is harmfull.
---
"lets sue the maker of the games instead of disaplining our child."  
---
seems legit
---
According to my calculations this should help me hit 60 by late 2020 in lieu of early 2021.
---
Thanks bro
---
Wait, you can do item restoration?
---
Renewing before every pull is one of your problems for sure. Your generating threat before you tank has a chance to build any
---
definitely the other way around, if you are using a global chat, you should be aware that they might need to travel to the instance
---
by repurposing/restructuring it.  
---
The last thing i want is for wow classic to repeat the same mistakes of retail. creating an expansion where the only content done by new players is that expansion and they've no reason to participate in the foundational overworld is a problem. blizzard repeated this mistake too many times and produced the asmongold paperplate rant.  
---
Outland can exist within classic, I want people to still have reasons to be within BRM/Silithus/WPL and fighting.
---
Wait, maybe I'm out of the loop, but how do get two characters on the same flight lion-bat thing?
---
Nameplate distance.  Actual threat information.  Focus frame.  Faster server update/tick rate.
---
On the other hand, there are literal millions of Chinese with access to the free internet.
---
I think it's what 90% of gnomes do at some point. I know I am.
---
What does it matter to you if the content you cant do yet comes out? Do you WANT the game to be dead by teh time you hit 60?
---
Can confirm it has those ores, but the arathi cave seems better.
---
OP also included the phase 3 release a "few months later."
---
That's probably the bigger concern of theirs.
---
Get that mount money.
---
You could also hold until BGs come out and sell it to a 39 twink for even more $$.
---
Still preferable to the standard classic quest line.
---
Hey, you see that hill there?  On that hill there are the last three wolves of its kind.  Go kill 12 of them.
---
That's also true for a lot of cases, although in some slots there is some clear cut winners.
---
Funny. I recall an incident in Vanilla YEARS ago, when I still felt like playing as a Warrior. This is like 2005 or 2006.
---
So, there I am, minding my own business and questing a bit in Desolace, when I get a whisper if I wanna go through Maraudon. The group only needs a Warrior, and I'm game.
---
So I get to the entrance. Mage, Hunter, Priest, Shaman and me. The Shaman asks where my shield is, and I go "Never used one". He's all up in the tree and growls that all Warriors need shields, because otherwise they can't tank. Naturally, I point out that they didn't ask for a Tank, but a Warrior, and he goes even more into bitch-mode.
---
When I tell him that it's no hair off my ass to continue questing, while they wait for another Warrior who'll tank for them, he finally equips a shield and takes on the heavy burden himself and is grumpy about it the whole run. He could essentially tank, he just didn't want to. For that entire run, the party chat is constantly filled with pills about how much non-tank Warriors suck throbbing donkeyschlongs and so on. All of it directed at me. The other peeps whisper me why I put up with it, and I just reply "Wait for it".
---
So, at the end and after having done quite allright, we finally get to Princess Thedras or whatever her name is, and we start to prepare. I whisper the others not to move a muscle once he pulls her, and they finally catch my drift.
---
So, this guy pulls the little lady, and we just watch him get whittled down. The second he's down, I run in and start to hack away. The others try their best to heal and dps, and with, like, 10 hit points or so left on my bar we finally down her. As close to a wipe as I have ever been, but we did it.
---
The Shaman is completely off his rocker in the chat for our little stunt, but there's a collective "Fuck you" from the whole gang, before he leaves seething. I got those blue plate leggings I can't remember the name of, and as an added bonus I spent 2 years afterwards questing with the Hunter, until he quit the game.
---
...dunno why I suddenly thought of that episode.
---
Sulfuras
---
I played retail off a usb3 enclosure with a ssd for a while. Definitely doable, but you dont want to risk your job for warcraft. Get the steam link app for mobile and play that way.
---
Play with your friends. The social aspect of the game is basically the whole point, you'll regret being the only one different. 
---
We don't even know if TBC is actually going to be a thing in Classic.
---
This isn't even an exaggeration. If you think it is just look at anything on the Xinjiang "re-education" camps.
---
What is playing Hearthstone to making a public outcry for the human rights of the people of Hong Kong. I applaud this person for saying what the woke are afraid to. Respect for freedom and individual liberty are Conservative Truths!! Down with the communists and death to socialist ideas that lead to this totalitarianism!
---
Well, at the very least, you're replying to me.  That means I can safely assume you have _some_ kind of electronic device-- the components for which were almost entirely manufactured by some poor ~~slave~~ underpaid worker in China, sooo...  Yeah, calling bullshit on that.
---
I have no problem with Chinese goods.  I have a problem with someone driving a Suburban to a climate change rally, if you get my meaning.
---
Agree - 30-40 zones can be everywhere in the world - Arathi, Stranglethorn, Desolace. Expecting someone to cater for your life commitments / requirements is not fair on them too.
---
Perhaps if you cannot commit to a few hours of playing you probably shouldn't be running dungeons.
---
&gt;Challenging Shout is spell hit and behaves like mocking blow. But it is AoE, and still better than Pala taunt...
---
Not hard to do, we don't have a taunt.
---
Lol just move along instead of getting your panties in a twist over internet grammar.
---
Wrong.
---
It is certainly an anomaly as far as video games and ram performance go, but good to point out none-the-less.
---
Which pretty much means its either a bug in the engine or a very dumb design flaw. But you're right that it is indeed the one game in existence where your GPU will be at 30% usage and only go up as you clock your RAM speed up.
---
Well you had one badass pally then. Cuz I don't normally care what the group is but we had a pally who couldn't do either of those. Only because of threat.
---
Incoming Naxx by the end of the year :P /s
---
As a tank I gotta say it feels pretty good to be able to choose groups that are already there or are close to it, can summon, etc. Pop in a "tank LFG dungeon XYZ" and you'll get like 3 different whispers. Pick the one that says they're all already there or they can summon and boom we're all in the dungeon ready to go.
---
achoo
---
I‚Äôm just now looking for it but it looks like it‚Äôs ‚ÄúSpy Classic‚Äù
---
24 days after EU launch though, more than 2 weeks if my calculations are correct, but still, faster than Classic for us EU players.
---
And for every 10 that said they cancelled their sub only 2 didnt resub down the track.
---
Dont get me wrong, I'm cancelling my sub out of solidarity but I cant say I wont be back...
---
Well it comes down to not always using the highest rank spells too. 
---
Renew is fine but use mid pull to keep tank or other party members topped off. 
---
Greater heal generates massive threat unless you spec holy. Flash heal is the most mana efficient spell for non holy specs and gives you, to my knowledge, the best mana cost vs. heal amount. 
---
There are loads of guides online to priest healing. Greater heal does have its spot tho. For example if you were healing a dps class in the group and didn‚Äôt see the tank was getting low, you could shield the tank and shoot off a greater heal.  Just realise after doing so the tank could be rage starved slightly cos of the shield in this example so you may at that point take a bit more aggro. 
---
I also suggest getting a threat meter mod along with the tank so you can anticipate mobs dropping aggro on you. As a healer especially priest, you need to be able to adjust your heals to the effectiveness of your tank. If he‚Äôs not prot or is not experienced in tanking and can be really stressful on a healer.
---
Haha oh come on I've played both factions equally, it literally makes no difference besides people shouting their ideologies. A lot of people joined Horde just because of that interview with the guy from Cannibal Corpse, which is amazing, so fair enough.
---
What's worse, is when your /played time is longer than theirs :(
---
I'm trying to push to 56 on my war before DM comes.
---
money items = need
---
sorry - it's the only way. if you want it so bad maybe you can buy it off the winner.
---
people don't pug to gear others up
---
I don‚Äôt agree with people taking 20+ minutes to get to the dungeon but also can‚Äôt blame someone for being last in the group and having to hoof it to the dungeon.
---
I wanted to write "Nahh warlocks are" then I read "Arm warrior" and was like. Ahhhhh
---
Uhm, what game are you playing?
---

Mei'k Hong Kong great again.

I don't think so. If it's a BOE and it's worth money you should all be rolling. You can't get the item without running in a dungeon of 5 so why should you get priority?

Using esports as a platform to advertise your personal beliefs (as this individual who was banned did) was a selfish decision. Hearthstone has nothing to do with political clouds in the SEA region. 
---
You seemed to have missed the point of my post.
---
Activision Blizzard is a business. It would be completely counter-productive for their business to take a stand against arguably their largest individual national market.
---
They‚Äôre in it to make money, not fight for human rights. Use your logic here to see why they‚Äôd do what they do. 
---
They‚Äôre always going to make business-savvy decisions over anything. They‚Äôre not your or my friend, they‚Äôre in it to make money. If there was no money, there‚Äôd be no company and we‚Äôd have no gaming content from them. So, if it‚Äôs your angle to see them take a stance and have to do mass layoffs because they take a financial hit and gain absolutely nothing of value in taking said stance, it was in vain. Literally, the company would hemorrhage ‚Äî which is good for nobody.

If your server has high competition for mining, you are best to walk through Maraudon.

wat

For PvE you have sapper charge/grenades which offer a substantial amount of burst that raids can use to manipulate fights. You can also craft/drop field repair bots to help on progression nights. Depending on your class Jumper Cables can help with wipe recovery, though I'll admit that one isn't reliable. You craft the highest quality ammunition for your raid's Hunters, as well as scopes.
---
For PvP grenades are even more useful for their ability to interrupt/cc casts. There are trinkets that allow you to reflect enemy spells. There are boots which give you a runspeed boost and a helm that allows you to CC your opponent.

On the flip side i feel like this dilutes the identity of a dungeon.

What should priests be using? 
---
Flash heal for time crunch oh shit moments.
---
Greater for big heals when time allows.
---
Lesser heal for cheap shitty heals when time allows
---
And various ranks, of course.
---
? What else is there?
---
Tbh it's annoying when people undercut by an absurd amount to get a sale. But no reason to get this mad over it lol
---
people still roll in retail? thought everything was kiddy safe so no ninja's could happen.
---
This is me exactly. Hardest thing I have to do is work out which mob my tank wants me to focus when they can't be bothered marking them.

International law is not a "law". It's strictly optional.

Why did they even have to ask if you're in the same dungeon group?

They are doing it because its the same day Archeage Unchained comes out
---
Jump ship from your guild.
---
Start a dungeon group yourself. Help someone out 5+ levels below you and build up a rapport with them. Join their guild. Go on dungeons with them. Better if they are a tank/healer class.
---
Join the lookingforgroup channel and ask there/request to join groups there.
---
Accept that you may need to be a bit over-levelled for pugging - at least until you start 'making friends'

\*Laughs in duskwood worgen\* Was there leveling in a party of 3 and damn wet doggies respawned faster than we killed them
---
I played it on release for like 1-2 months. I loved the sandbox elements of it so freaking much. Creating your own boat with a group of people to explore the seas, claiming your own plot of land to build your house on, a very economy focused game. In the end it was just a little bit too P2W for me, but I did enjoy it for a short time.
---
WTS name Galadriel on all servers
---
Flying mounts killed so much of the game though, the trade off isn't worth it IMO.
---
Depends on what they want.
---
Censoring comments is one thing. They could have issued a statement to not take sides, tried to be neutral with it all, but they didn't. They took a side, and its the wrong side. You can say there is pressure and they would have lost MORE money then they will lose from this, but they would have been reputable and moral. People would also have come to defend Blizzard and double down on their love and support for it. But they didn't, and that is not excusable.

It's supposed to do a random amount of damage per tick between 100-500. Right now it takes whatever 12% of your health is and that is the damage every tick.
---
I'm 52 now, want to get to 56 by DM 
---
XD
---
It is not like DM gear is better than MC gear. Or DM being harder than MC. DM adds some extra to the gear progression but it is really better to release now than later, later on it would just mean a lot of the playerbase won't run it except for Gold Farming.
---
If they don't balance around it they end up being terrible though. If they didn't provide rewards and were just a fun distraction it would be ok.
---
Same here. Good praxis
---
Why should you get priority on gear? I can vendor 
---
How about you roll n those hides even though I didn't level skinning?
---
By your logic I should roll need on everything!

No arguments still, huh?

But cool man, got you covered. You see, Wikipedia has a handy citation feature.

Since you apparently actually have stopped trying, thanks by the way, I'm going to check out at this point. Thanks for the chat. You can scream in to the void some more if you want.

Muh progression! The game isn‚Äôt going anywhere, mate. You‚Äôre free to take as long as you bloody want. If this was about the honor system coming out next week; THEN I‚Äôd be 100% behind you.

Does it work that way in real life? Let us know what you find out.

I stopped after TBC, but from what I remember they were exclusively for level 70's, so by then you'd experienced the majority of the game.

toxic players will group with other toxic players, meanwhile the people who don't mind a recipe going to a priest or an alchemist will form their own groups between guilds and when an boe epic drops no one hesitates to even press greed.

&gt; There were also a lot of people who expected to stroll into MC in greens and get carried by us, despite the fact that we spent 2 weeks getting our raiders into 90% pre raid bis gear, which was a big part of why we got 9/10 so quick.
---
This shit is the worst.  Last raiding guild I was in was just like so many others so once we got into AQ40 we had lost some core raiders and had to recruit.  There's always a handful that just expect to be invited to raids while seemingly doing fuck all the rest of the week to get some gear.
---
To anyone reading this, if you happen to be that lucky individual who just finds their self is a good raid guild before or soon after hitting 60, don't sit on your ass waiting to be carried to free epics.  No one likes a freeloading mooch, and even if the raid can still down content with you in the raid, they would surely like to do it faster each week so get out there and fill in your gear gaps and CONTRIBUTE to the raid!
---
The game doesn't stop at max level though, many would argue that's where the game really begins. Killing world pvp and all sense of scale and adventure was really bad for the game.
---
&gt; Are different things
---
Why?
---
&gt; I do not know how to make this more simple for you to understand
---
Stop acting like you've concocted some kind of infallible argument.  You're making an arbitrary distinction and trying to pass it off as common sense.  Knock it the fuck off.

Do you mean CCCP? Thats the Soviets.

Yeah it would also be awkward to ban someone from Blizzard for talking about someone getting banned feom Blizzard.

i wish i rolled female orc
---
Pretty sure this is Thunderfury. Seen them running around quite a bit.
---
Blizzard banned a guy over voicing support for Hong Kong, fired people who were interviewing him, and kept silencing other players, until the stupidity of their actions became apparent. Now they are going to do what little damage control they can do, before packing their bags and going to China.
---
Players who have cleared multiple lockouts of MC already and players that are still leveling to 60 don't generally overlap even once casual players have caught up in levels. Gating content doesn't fix the issue you are describing. If new content isn't released regularly the players who rushed to the end just stop playing, they don't hang around to repeat the same content once the next wave of 60's come in.
---
I don't understand the entitlement here. If there are not enough players available when YOU decide you are ready to play a certain raid/instance then I suggest finding a higher pop realm. You don't get to dictate when others are allowed to participate in specific content.
---
It's like complaining to mom that big brother is going out with friends and you can't go because you are too young for whatever they planned to do and then expecting mom to force big brother and his friends to change their plans and do something they don't want to do. Play with kids your own age.
---
I was enjoying classic. 
---
Cancelled.
---
This level of pure retardation coupled with unapologetic smugness is a delicious combo lol
---
Blizzard has plenty of those.
---
Oooooo BURN good one.
---
It seems to me that you and others are confusing fury/prot with dual wield tanking. Fury/prot generally means 0/31/20 with 1h+shield. For boss tanking, the only notable talents you'll miss are shield slam and 1H specialization, which are more than compensated by flurry. Shield slam is somewhat better TPR than talented sunder armor, but flurry allows you to hit faster for more threat and heroic strikes.
---
In conclusion, fury/prot generates slightly more TPS against bosses that give you enough rage to spam HS. Deep prot is better for dungeon tanking with improved taunt and tactical mastery, while fury/prot also allows you to deal damage when necessary.
---
Dont forget to innervate your healer while out of form!

Partially because I'm waiting for raid time and partially because I'm new and want to examine pvp consumable use in order to set reasonable expectations for myself, I recorded the number of consumables used by Advertis (the shadow priest) on screen
---
2x Limited Invulnerability Potion  
---
1x Dark Rune  
---
3x Superior healing potion  
---
3x Superior mana potion  
---
10x Iron grenade  
---
3x Heavy runecloth bandage
---
There are also 4 major time cuts (server hours of 7, 12, 11, 8 in order seen) with 5 restocks of consumables, so tracking usage between cuts is difficult. I also noted that an enemy Rogue used bandages in at least one, the Mage used iron grenades in at least two instances, and the Paladin used a superior mana potion (roughly) at least once.
---
I also noted that despite what comments are saying, no fight was more than 1v2. In fights where there were more than 2, Advetis had a rogue party member assisting.
---
Yea that's in there it just seems the trap won't go off
---
Lots of hate on this post, which mostly illustrates OP‚Äôs point exactly. Me, a casual player as well, also interpreted the upcoming release as a sign that we (players in their 30‚Äôs and 40‚Äôs) are behind. Pretty much the only people with an argument saying how OP is complaining about nothing understands the actual impact of this release, which is apparently to balance equipment for spell casters. 
---
News flash, not everyone knows this as common knowledge. I was sorta freaking out about this as well. It just seems like everyone is moving so fast, but the casuals are already being left in the dust. I completely agree with OP, but perhaps due to ignorance on our part because we don‚Äôt truly understand the rationale or implications of these releases because we are casuals....we Barry have time to commit to the game, let alone know/understand what is driving the schedule. 
---
Cut OP some slack. Not everyone knows every little detail about this game. Don‚Äôt hate, educate!
---
When I played vanilla I was in 8th grade when it came out. It took me about 9 months to hit 60. I wasn‚Äôt going nuts. I wasn‚Äôt hardcore. I played when I could and had a blast.
---
Once I got to 60 I really upped my game and started playing a lot more.  By the time TBC came out I was clearing most of Naxx.  But I remember it was a long slow grind over those 2.25 years.  There‚Äôs no need to rush anything.  I really Hope classic is drawn out over 2 full years. Yeah Raids will he cleared much easier but the overall grind and enjoyment is why most people enjoyed the game.
---
I just wish more people had the integrity to say no.
---
Same here! Ugh
---
If you do not want to tank, swap the bear talents for cat in the feral tree to improve your solo farming times. To be an even better healer you can instead go moonglow/NS, losing the feral tree entirely and switch to a more of a caster for solo farming.
---
&gt;Does anyone have a tip?
---
There isn't any tip for this sadly. Enh is just generally garbage at sustain damage.
---
Many people switch to Ele at 40 and don't end up looking back.
---
My mind instantly played this track to your footage:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmkSRC-i3AU
---
WoW has had two stat squishes by now. Due to the exponential increase in damage and stats in order to seperate old expansions properly as well as raid tiers damage numbers went out of hand in a lot of people's eyes.
---
Trvia regarding that:
---
The first happened after MoP, where DPS had skyrocketed to triple digit K numbers and topping a million in AoE scenarios. WoW still offered the 32bit client, so numbers in general were limited to 2,147,483,647 (2.147 billion). Bosses, most notably Thok in SoO had HP numbers just short of it and Garrosh Hellscream (final boss) healed himself three times to 100% in phase transitions in order to allow for the encounter.
---
The next one happened happened after Legion (just two expansions later after the last one), where damage numbers hovered around 2-3 million DPS. Fury warriors had the passive Juggernaut, which increased execute damage each time you used it. By the time you reached a certain amount of stacks at the end of the expansion execute was easily doing 10 million damage or more. This squish mainly comes from the fact that the four difficulties with four different loot IDs still have to feel rewarding, thus having a whopping 15 ilvl difference between each difficulty (LFR is ilvl 400 currently, normal 415, heroic 430 and mythic is 445). Meanwhile, titanforging (random chance for gear to upgrade itself) simultaniously devalues gear from higher difficulties. To put that into perspective: epic level 60 gear has a minimum ilvl of 60 and goes up to the 80s in Naxxramas and ilvl existed already in Vanilla, albeit worthless due to the class design and oftentimes weird itemization.
---
I love this. Thank you.
---
The harpies (and quillboar and centaurs) were there first
---
I wouldn't ignore strength all-together, but i value agility higher.
---
&gt;The game doesn't stop at max level though, many would argue that's where the game really begins
---
True, but most of the exploration has been completed by that point. I remember in TBC that by the time I actually got my flying mount that I'd visited all the areas and explored basically all that I could in Outlands. 
---
Sure there were raids, quests, BG's and other things available at level 70, but typically you just used your flying mount to get to it. 
---
But other than that, the flying mounts allowed you to access brand new content available only to players at that level.
---
&gt;Killing world pvp and all sense of scale and adventure was really bad for the game.
---
As a mage, WPvP was never better than when you could dismount and PoM+Poly someone 100ft in the air.
---
Similar situation for me really, but with whole server.
---
Me and old Vanilla guildie rolled on PvE server at launch as found nice casual guild. We got to mid 30s when more old guildies started to play. They wanted to roll on PvP server and we agreed. Now 90% of time it's just me and my original PvE friend who are online.
---
Really wish had just stayed in original PvE server. Would be raiding by now already.
---
oh lol no it's self recorded xD Was just a visual glitch xD
---
They did pick sides. This is picking sides.
---
&gt; Please, open it back up so the community can go to one centralized place and voice their concerns over the human rights violations that Activision-Blizzard seems to defend.
---
Aaaaaand it's full of low effort memes for easy karma now..
---
dont you realise though that diremaul is gunna make your items worth more on ah, the players mad farm dm will dump their gold on alts and high end mats..prof you get it, they get their mount and then they spend it.   
---
we, the slow ones, profit from them making more gold, i just barely got my mount and made an item that could net me 50g, but thats about it.
---
Yeah that's why I decided against rerolling. I'll probably appreciate orc way more when I get into pvp and start shrugging off CC
---
Wrath actually. Icy Touch spam for burst threat was a thing because of it
---
Fuck all that noise
---
My mage would get trades, and I would close them out after about 15 seconds if no communication. A ton of people just open trade expecting you to know they want food and water.
---
Will there always be the perfect item? Sure. 
---
But that doesn't mean anything less than perfect is immediately trash gear. Had a dungeon the other day where a piece of gear that someone THOUGHT was BIS for the tank dropped, but it was also a big upgrade for myself and another dps. 
---
The 3rd dps freaked out that we needed it, and the end the tank had no idea if it was good for him so he passed it. 
---
An upgrade is an upgrade, your BIS can take from days to weeks to drop, but the sooner you get good gear to improve, the sooner you can help your parties and your raid team. 
---
I have yet to see any group except the most hardcore care if you arent in your BIS or close, as long as you are wearing the right stats for your role and trying your best.
---
What is this pristine yeti hide farm? I thought there was only Runecloth turn ins
---
It was a lot of wiping cause by healers going oom etc and people dying lol. It was a terrible run that only 2 kills happened because of that kind fo shit.  If we're wiping I'm not gonna sit there and continue healing just to boost meters or anything so just quick wipe and get back up etc.
---
You. Are. Groveling. 
---
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre‚Äù works. Unlike your arguments.
---
It was a long time ago,  so I don't really recall.  It took a long time,  though.  I didn't focus on that alone, but I'd log into that character when my guild wasn't raiding and farm silk cloth while I was watching movies and other things. 
---
It was mostly an RP/vanity project.  One of those,  "Can I do this?" things.  I think tabards came out just after I finished and I remember being a little salty about that. 
---
When TBC came out,  I found a new personal mission.  I wanted a Tiny Sporebat pet.  To get that,  you had to get Exalted with Sporeregar.
---
I killed thousands of Bog Lords. Thousands. 
---
I really don't play this game the right way for retail.
---
I'm learning this the hard way it seems lol. All the replies give me faith though so I'm determined to stick it out.
---
&gt; Players who have cleared multiple lockouts of MC already and players that are still leveling to 60 don't generally overlap even after those casual players have caught up in levels. 
---
That has nothing to do with this conversation. The point is clear. People are doing MC en masse right now. If DM is released, people will stop doing MC en masse. Those of us who have not been poopsocking it and are in our 50's right now will just flat out miss the BRD/MC/Ony rush.
---
&gt; Gating content doesn't fix the issue you are describing.
---
It literally does. 
---
&gt; If new content isn't released regularly the players who rushed to the end just stop playing, most of them don't hang around to repeat the same content once the next wave of 60's come in.
---
Dude, it's not like there's this giant mass of players at 60 lmao. I'd be genuinely shocked if 10% of the current, active player base is max level. *Maybe* half of those fully attuned for MC and Ony, and *maybe* half of those having even cleared it, let alone on full farm. 
---
You are not only the minority, you're the ultra ultra ultra minority.
---
&gt; I don't understand the entitlement here.
---
I'll spell it out simply for you. I am a consumer for this product. I, as a paying consumer for this product, am entitled to my consumer opinion of it. They are free to do with that information as they like, just as we are free to do with our money as we like. However the "entitlement" is pretty clear -- we are paying for a service, we are entitled to say our piece on the service. 
---
&gt; You don't get to dictate when others are allowed to participate in specific content.
---
I never said I was. I was giving my *opinion* on what I *think* the release cadence of new raids should be, based on my experiences and observations. 
---
There are two great ironies here:
---
1. You say the above, but *you* are the one trying to dictate when we are allowed to participate in specific content. Because you no lifed this game and have nothing left to do, you are *demanding* that we get more content *NOW NOW NOW* at the expense of 99% of the population, and then call -us- the entitled ones when we say hey, wait a second, that's ridiculous. 
---
2. You haven't actually responded to a single point. We have a pretty concise point: You can never relive the experience of current content being live and everyone doing it. Releasing new content, while not removing the old content, removes the percentile of people actively doing it.  We believe too many people have not gotten to experience this, where the *entire point* of Classic is giving people a chance to experience these things when they missed it before. You never responded to this. All you said was we're entitled babies and made a half-baked analogy. 
---
&gt; It's like complaining to mom that big brother is going out with friends and you can't go because you are too young for whatever they planned to do and then expecting mom to force big brother and his friends to change their plans and do something they don't want to do. Just play with kids your own age.
---
The fact that even your shitty analogy is worded in this way shows your really pathetic superiority complex. No, here's what it's *actually* like: Mom took two brothers to the amusement park. One brother sprinted at breakneck speed to every single ride and ran them all in an hour. The other brother takes his time, going to the food stands, the little performance shows, the carnie booths, and hits up rollercoasters inbetween. The first brother is now throwing a temper tantrum at how he wants to go to another theme park now and how his brother is *such an entitled asshole* for not wanting to sprint through the park like him.
---
Honestly just too much content, which most of it was irrelevant because of how old it was. Also many empty areas and just the MMO vibe wasn't really there, because I wasn't at endgame with everyone else.  
---
And over 15 years worth of content, quests, mechanics, dungeons etc there's just too much stuff everywhere so I found it hard to focus on what to do, what goal should I have, etc.  
---
Of course with classic you can breathe it all in as there's less stuff to do, and you know what goal to set yourself and how to get it.  
---
Just my opinion though, I'm not that well versed in MMO's.
---
Plenty of people at lower levels still. You have lots of time to get 60 before phase 2.
---
Didn‚Äôt even read your entire post but your opening line says it all.. slow the eff down. I‚Äôm lvl 32. Ha
---
We want to play in the World of Warcraft. Having to actually traverse that world is a big part of what actually makes it a world. Dungeon finder turns it from "World of Warcraft" into "Warcraft Dungeons: The Ride"
---
I dont get it either because its the same with faster leveling.
---
For every anecdote that way, there's one other way. My wife and I probably go to bed the same time a few times a month, at most. She knows I'm having fun though, so it's not an issue, my own fault if I'm tired the next day.

---
Deleting my Blizzard account now and never installing anything from them again, good job blizzard.
---
Our guild is the same. We farm MC and Ony in one night on mains and then do whatever on alts. Classic has content, the only thing that is lacking is targets to reach in PvP. Right now other than stealing devilsaur leather there's nothing.
---
ive dropped aggro in fights many times
---
47 is waaay too low for ungoro, mobs are 50-52.

I am still looking for that Defias Messenger.

I was in the 1 camp.

Hopefully P2 comes out in Jan.

This is a useful perspective but it‚Äôs also not true. Warriors can DW tank and outthreat everyone.

Do hinterlands and all the elite quests there. At 48 you can also do searing gorge.

---
Make Nightscape headbands. 5 thick leather vendor for 45s. Should roughly triple your gold per hour. Maybe my math is wrong :shrug
---
On behalf of casuals? As in the same reason we all quit retail wow? Because they catered everything to casuals? Mhhhmmmmm.

Don't you have to pay for each character you make since each would be its own account?

Wait this isn‚Äôt Michael C Hall from Dexter??
---
Does Everquest going to reset progression after everything is released or something? I think WoW Classic should have no resets, so that's why we should have long pauses between content releases. It should take 3 or 4 years to release Naxx.
---
Math!
---
Yeah report him blizz will check chat logs and fuck him up
---
Hmm so you‚Äôre saying that them apologizing means a message wasn‚Äôt sent?  Truly 1000 iq deduction there, Sherlock.
---
DM is being released early so they can use layering without being "in phase 2 yet"
---
You didn‚Äôt notice the other boss had been cleared as well?  I‚Äôve done this before. But realised when we got to the first boss so it wasn‚Äôt so bad.
---
Lawd jesus
---
Badlands, STV, Arathi..?
---
I just want PvP content.
---
Dont do druid unless you really love the class. Pure cat is pretty bad. You can make it work in raids but it requires a lot of work just to do average dps. Leveling is a breeze though with unlimited sustain and the ability to tank dungeons.
---
Ban them or?
---
I agree. I hope classic lasts three years at least so more than one person can get aetish
---
I get it, rogues can seem over powered cuz of the stealth burst dmg they can drop on you from out of no where. But if you can weather the initial dmg they dont have a lot left and a bunch of cds they are waiting on
---
Lmao
---
Im uninstalling the blizzard client tonight and ending all my subscriptions. Hope others will do the same
---
This isn't retail, the entire game doesn't get invalidated every time a patch releases.
---
Not only am I not upvoting this, but I'm reporting you for breaking rule 4 of /r/classicwow's rules.
---
"Do not share or encourage the use of exploits, cheats, private servers, or other illicit game behavior."
---
I'm just curious how long people want the release schedule to last? Is the expectation that it follows suit with the original game? Half that pace? 3/4 that pace?
---
There's nothing to extrapolate from this Dire Maul release. It's one data point. People are really overreacting. Logistically, we're still a little bit away from turning off layering unless a few servers end up with hour long queues. 
---
Blizzard can see the data of how many players aren't 60 yet. Dire Maul is a pretty easy compromise of giving level cap players something to do without rushing the release schedule.  Two of the wings are even technically level-up dungeons. 
---
They're not rushing. Yet. If we see another data point from Blizz that makes it look like they're rushing, then you can freak out.
---
It‚Äôs time for a Market Correction.

Imagine you were a kid and you wanted to start a lemonade stand on your street. Theres another kid selling lemonade a few blocks away. But instead of a stand he's got a big lemonade van, with shiny bells and whistles all over it. He hears about you opening your lemonade stand and instead of wishing you well, he runs over your stand with his lemonade van. Thats not competition, that's just bullying.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt mention /u/Hexxys *pegging* you.
---
Personally I found when DM came out, people stopped wanting to do a lot of the other dungeons. My worry is that when I hit 60, on an already population imbalanced server, it's going to be hard to find groups for the things I want.
---
Well what stupid shit did you do. But also who cares if you're quitting
---
Why do people comment incorrect information on a game that was solved fuckin 15 years ago, I don't get it.
---
Why so down at all? If you‚Äôre casual, you shouldn‚Äôt care how fast hardcore players are clearing content, so why hinder them when you can continue to lvl just fine?
---
Go. to. ZF.
---
Yea im stuck at 32. Because today I uninstalled because of the piece of trash company that owns it.
---
Depends on their history

Pretty much
---
Yeah, it would be full of warrior paladin 2v2s.
---
I remember hunters used to pull all the time, hunters pull one into a trap, mages are supposed to sheep the moon, and tank takes the skull and whatever other adds might left. I‚Äôve run every instance in classic till Uld so far(except DM and stockades), and I‚Äôve yet to see a hunter trap trigger. It‚Äôs just different. Back then, as early as RFD or ZF, hunters were already burning through freezing traps like crazy. Maybe it‚Äôs different at the higher lvl dungeons.
---
Hotfix pushed it to 500% in Cata. It was already 300% in Wrath. That's how you end up with Icy Touch spam generating 300k threat
---
Hey man, which guide are you referring to? I'd love some more structure to my questing.
---
You‚Äôve obviously not been keeping up with the news cycle...
---
Once more people are 60 and honor comes out I would expect this to be fairly common.
---
Yea I agree that as long as it's just classic (no outlands or the like), you'd be able to find players doing all kinds of content.  I do get the feel though, it sucks feeling like you're all alone in big Azeroth lol
---
Wait until you get to the 55-60 bracket. 
---
The 30s fly by, then the 40s slow down because you need to travel and there's just no good places to grind out continuous levels, you are constantly traveling via messenger quests and such. It feels like you only get a few quests in an area at a time. Then the 55-60 bracket is even worse. If you have the patience, dungeon as much as you can during that bracket. If you are a real masochist, just go grind mobs until you ding.
---
love this minimal style
---
Yes, unless you are a well geared healer. Tank or dps would be no bueno.
---
Wasn't it something that would passively kick in after you walked a certain distance, can already see it happening.

On Skeram Undeath sells for 25-35s, Water sells for 13-15g.
---
Might not get me rich quick, but that's a guaranteed ~100G per week for the foreseeable future. Undeath is probably going to go lower as more people farm Strat and Water will go up when they remove our 2nd layer.
---
&gt;Aspect of the fast cat
---
No idea, if stormstrike can do 3 physical attack in the same time with similar dmg(like 198 201 205) then it could be that.
---
More content = good. Making existing content obsolete/pointless = bad.
---
LoL this cut especially deep for those that played since vanilla and play both live and classic.
---
You could arguable do all the quests in those 4 in under 20 hours leaving yourself with nothing to do half way through to 50.
---
Subscription cancelled. Fuck Blizzard.
---
Dude that looks awesome!!
---
In the middle of unsubscribing to classic wow, while I was writing why I was stopping my sub, this text came to my phone saying my account was now locked....... I didn‚Äôt even submit it yet...
---
Now I can‚Äôt post to any blizzard sub unless it‚Äôs a comment...
---
That was pretty common for alliance players. Easiest way to get the weapon skill up.
---
Ok I think I'm thinking of the right one. I remember being very excited for Archage, but being very thankful I never bought it. Gonna have to check it out soon
---
MP5 really isnt that good right now, fights are short and you shouldn't have too much problem with mana. +healing is king by a longshot.
---
The only content killers are ZG and AQ20. If you‚Äôre not 60 by then you really do miss out.
---
Same, honestly disappointed that I had to cancel my sub. Hoping that they make it right but am not holding my breath. I'm afraid the PR tactic they are going for is to be quiet and hope everyone forgets. Fuck that.
---
I actually haven't been killed by a priest ever. I'm 60
---
Why is this person being downvoted calling people out on their daily bullshit.
---
STV is a bad place to be before you get to 35 at the very least.
---
Level 25 here - 2 kids, full career, some weeks 3hrs of gaming, some weeks none, some weeks 15hrs.  
---
What I wish for is a dedicated "cPVE" server ("c" for casual) with a slow progression.  At this progression rate, by the time I hit 60, AQ40 will be on farm.
---
That's not how massive corporations work. Executives and analysts are not paid hundreds of thousands of dollars per year to say "yeah I'm not too worried about that other game tbh let's just sit back, relax, and see what happens."
---
You think that evasion is instant death vs warriors and shouldn't be used? If you do. You don't know how to play a rogue.
---
Hey its me, your guildie.
---
Ash-kandi gang
---
Lots of private server players do since they've become dependent on the addon over the last 15 years and can't heal the way you're supposed to
---
50-52 ZF. 52-55 BRD 1st part. 55-57 BRD 2nd part. 57-58 LBRS. 58-60 Strat Live, Scholo. You don't need to any quests apart from Ony chain and MC attune really. Though Un'goro, EPL and WPL all are awesome for exp and just in general.

---
You planning on buying any Chinese-made goods any time soon?  Or anything made with Chinese components?  I ask this often but nobody can ever give me a straight answer.
---
You're obviously oblivious if you think this is NEW.  Blizzard has been catering to china for a decade.
---
if you're on benediction watch out for your boy SnooppDogg
---
Warriors &gt; Rogues &gt; Mages.  The problem is Warriors can't find rogues half the time.
---
Contrary to this... I hope trangsmog stays out of classic forever. Even if they catch up to retail, keep transmog out of the game forever. The devs actually already said transmogging is what essentially killed aesthetic design on gear and classes. They literally said that they stopped trying hard on gear looks once transmog came out. It literally killed the design side of stuff. Terrible system. Farm for 200 hours on the hardest raids to get a complete heroic set, just to look half as cool as the guy that ran a BC raid solo twice and got a full set. Ridiculous
---
This joke assumes people know the mechanics of every class
---
For all the people confused, this is the Winterspring Saber mount not the Night Elf Saber. Different grind üòÉ
---
Well Tencent has stock in Blizzard, so by extension a Chinese based company partially owns Blizzard.
---
It IS a betrayal.
---
Yep, my buddy is a pretty consistent player and even he is only 49. That‚Äôs a lot of in game time.
---
Unless you have the most +heals or are highly organised in raids you sit there and spam HT which is boring AF to begin with and spamming heals is better done by other healing classes. 
---
Your innervate is for a priest but I'd rather have an extra priest taking a resto druids spot to begin with. Brez every 30 mins is useless for progression and unecessary for farm. 
---
Restos biggest contribution is MotW and you only need 1 druid for that. Compared to the future, resto druids are horrible which is exactly my point. You just have to look at the early tier sets to know Blizz put little effort thinking about druids.
---
I've already done this. I'm asking us all to do more.
---
Thank you for taking the time to read my letter :)
---
4 hours a day is what, 150 hours? How are you not level 60 after that amount of time? I even spent a ton of time doing professions and shit and I still hit 60 at about 120 hours. I had fishing 300 before I hit 60.
---
Pop on a shield when he hits evasion, NP.
---
then you missed out key zones in your late 30s like Desolace, alterac mountains and dustwallow marsh.
---
All involve grinding a lot but you get mob and quest xp so its fine
---
i aint cancelling shit, idgaf whats going on in hong kong
---
Cancelled. Do something before we all do nothing.

Dang really?? I looted this the other day and didn't see any listed in the AH. Somehow got lucky with both this robe and staff of Jordan. Haven't had any luck trying to sell the staff yet, maybe I'll have some luck with this.

&lt;Exhausted&gt; US-Westfall
---
Exhausted is a new alliance guild on Westfall switching from the horde side due to population issues. We are looking for new members dedicated to the game. Currently re-rolling means re-leveling, but during the switch we would like to build a core that is ready to raid in 1-2 months minimum. Our current needs are social members, but also people who plan to strive for endgame content. Everyone is welcome to join, but at the same time we will be looking to build several raid ready rosters for split MC/Ony runs, as well as a community to push PvP rank in phase 2+. 
---
ÔÅ∂    Warriors: Need All
---
ÔÅ∂    Rouges: Need All
---
ÔÅ∂    Mages: Need All

ÔÅ∂    Warlocks: Need All
---
ÔÅ∂    Druids: Need All
---
ÔÅ∂    Paladins: Need All
---
ÔÅ∂    Hunters: Need All
---
Exhausted is built on the hope of obtaining several core rosters to push each phase in classic WoW, and we need people who are willing to persist in that goal. We want like minded individuals who are willing to help others and be a part of a community.
---
These are the current raid times.
---
Sunday 8-11 pm server time
---
Monday 8-11 pm server time

So everyone else should bore themself so that you can get what? On everyones level? What do you lose if bwl comes out next week? What a selfish post
---
how come when I logged in today, instead of the server saying "full" or whatever, it says "layered" now in blue?
---
Drugs. Not even once...
---
I had some kind of mana draining poison on me the other day in bear and cat form. I can't remember where from though. Maybe Azshara?
---
Is it all mana drain effects or just the mana drain spell?
---
How though ? I haven‚Äôt played in 10 years and I can still remember the tab word being faded from targeting and dotting endless mobs. 
---
Affliction days how I miss you.
---
I like to think that everything I can't loot is destroyed in the process. I mean, why doesn't torn fur have a near 100% drop rate from furry creatures? *Because the fur is often disintegrated by my savage attacks.*
---
The poster concerned with this isn't me, I was just reiterating their concern
---
3 no, but it can cause them to hit 2 AA at the same time. 3 AA is almost certainly a WF proc. I've never seen any evidence of what you're talking about. Doesn't hurt to ask support?
---
Usually when something like this happens someone got super unlucky 2-3 times and becomes convinced it's a pattern.
---
That certainly says plenty about you....
---
you guys might as well stop playing LoL and PoE also
---
50-56 I was still getting 3 levels a day and 56-60 I did 2 levels per day.... although that being extreme no lifing of course.
---
Shit. The item I wanted to recover wasn't there. RIP.
---
Literally classic.
---
Most fights start at 0 rage unfortunately. Even with imp charge at 21 rage, that‚Äôs still a far cry from SS+WW ‚Äòs 55rage.

Threat maintenance wouldn‚Äôt be too bad if I had rage at start of fights

Recent post about layering. They changed the login server status to indicate which servers are down to 1 layer.
---
Not entirely sure why though, they didn't explain their motivations iirc.
---
It looks like we have too many coyotes and leopards in here, oh I know make some invisible that should fix it.
---
ZF
---
Naw, a warlock
---
I assume he is survival spec, which was changed to a pure melee build.
---
Im just a salty bastard because I lost a wpvp "1v1" as a warrior. Hope you are happy now.
---
I don‚Äôt think most healers care about healing a warlock when mana tapping during a fight, or a couple times after. 
---
What pisses us off is after a pull, when a warlock will life tap down to 1% hp and stand there while everyone else is eating/drinking.
---
What's they ban the casters for?
---
How much prize money was taken away from this poor dude, not to mention loss of income for 1yr after being banned??? and the casters got fired for just being???
---
bags, low level speed enchanted boots.
---
Same boat, and I like where your head is at!
---
nah. just because you and others will take 2 or 3 months (or more) to level, that doesn‚Äôt mean the rest of us should wait for you to catch up.
---
there is literally nothing to do for many of us without any battlegrounds to play.
---
classic WSG is 90% of the reason i resubbed after many years of not playing wow. 
---
releasing diremaul soon gives me a reason to play some more this month. the past 3 days ive played maybe 45 mins total. i have my epic mount, dungeon gear, maxed all professions, etc. my guild clears mc and onyxia but im not going to raid, because i hated it in vanilla and hate it more now. 
---
they shouldnt slow down content just because you will take 4-5 days to gain a single level in your 50s or because many people will still be struggling to complete the grind a couple months from now.
---
U right, I just felt like nelf was such an under represented race, you know?
---
Yeah, they are categorized by time zones
---
Just hit 50, but man is the grind fun..........................

"i can be your angle....or yuor devil"

Years ago I played Wow during WotLK. I met my husband playing WoW. When our tiny 4 person guild and 6 regulars finally took down Lich king, we were so proud. The memory still makes me smile. Felt like we owned the place, we farmed it till it was literally an art form. Still friends with those guys. Then we had our first kid and life took us away from WoW, but with the release of classic, we seriously thought about getting the gang back together, a few of us never played classic. We even had it planned out,  had logged in the website to check our accounts and the changes, kids start back at school next week, and husband has time off work....
---
I guess now, I'm not willing to sell my soul to play a game with my friends. Sorry, not sorry Blizzard. I don't know about the rest of the group, but Husband and I won't be paying Blizzard when they obviously already get enough from China.
---
Guess I'll go Google what's up with Rift.
---
I'm late but I'm also using Luna unit frames and trying to keep the default cast bar. Anybody have a clue how to do so?
---
It also went away when you were struck kinda like the AQ-only mounts as well as when you stopped moving.
---
If you roll a female, you get invited to more groups and just get better roles of the dice in general :)
---
There really isn't much enjoyment with the first 10 levels. Its fun in the nostalgic way. But I dont know how you could stretch that content out for 6 weeks. Kill crabs. Kill scorpions. Wake up lazy peons. There isn't much to explore
---
They don't dodge much
---
Yep. This guy's WoW bill is $75/month.
---

How will I hide my feral spec when I heal molten core :0
---
This is news to me. I've just started grinding for the Zandalari trolls. Thanks!
---
Ive seen lots saying CCP. Well ok. FUCK THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT. There
---
During prime times about 120-150. Still playable for sure. I'll have to do some testing and make an alt on a West server and see if there is any difference.
---
"Blizzard please don't give us more options when we get higher level"
---
They could release AQ and BWL tomorrow and 3 months from now you'll still need to go through MC 15 times to get geared for the next phase. Chill out. You're not missing or losing any content.
---
&gt; Ion has already said Phase 1 would be the shortest
---
They also said DM would be part of p2, until they decided to release content faster than they initially intended.
---
I would not at all be surprised to BWL end up out by end of year and naxx by the summer.
---
They're releasing DM months before they planned because they're worried people are going through content too fast. You think they're not going to cave when these people whine about only have MC to do for 4-5 months?
---
&gt;2,190 me
---
Great deduction!
---
It was taken down momentarily, removing any comment resembling the words Hong Kong, brought back up, comments disabled, and finally the post is back.

Yeah blizz change all your plans because this guy has to go to work

Can't a hunter just flare on top of the rogue?
---
Yea hunters don't have overpower
---
I agree! I get that I'm not even the average player atm let alone on the high-end, but I haven't even started to think about the end game yet LOL and I probably won't for weeks
---
I got banned for telling them to all fuck off. I guess I went a little too blunt. It only took a matter of SECONDS for me to get banned, was hilarious.
---
P.S. the value of doing this on a BoE white item is that it allows you to unequip it and send it to another character.
---
Canceling my sub,  how long do you think until players start getting banned for talking about Hong Kong in game?
---
Just waiting for that wow mobile at blizzconüòò

What should I be doing in dungeons as a low 20ish Shaman. WC in particular
---
Am I DPS, healing, Tanking?? 
---
Complete wow noob
---
Should be fixed by my first raid. I imagine learning how to be a human being would be a harder adjustment. GL!
---
I did the exact same thing but reverse with my rogue and then warrior. 
---
I think, as tribute, I am going to remake them both now I'm already farming raids, and finally get them to 60 so they can enjoy the classic experience they missed.
---
This is not how classic works. Content does not "outdated". I think that everyone freaking out about this are people from retail who think that classic loot works like retail loot.
---
Mute?
---
Farm tigresses in STV. Make jungle stew. Sell whiskers, tails,  and jungle stew to vendor. Whiskers vendor for 7s each.  Tails for 8s each. Each tiger meat cooked into 2 stews is worth 3s per stew, so 6s per meat. This adds up very fast, especially if you have skinning which makes each kill worth an extra 1 or 2 silver. Good luck!
---
By your own rationale, making a silly obviously sarcastic comment not directed at anyone in particular is what I enjoy so why are you shaming ME bud???

Messaged a guy thinking he was in my brother's guild so I could get an invite. Turns out my brother's guild was "me and the boys". He told me my brother's guild was just a knock off lol
---
... wut? The dude is only relevant because of his hatred towards Blizzard lol
---
I think they mean that we should be able to see ‚Äúhow layered‚Äù the layered servers are. Like, is it so populated that there are 15 layers? Or 5 layers? Or maybe 3 full layers vs 5 full layers?
---
If you got source that would be great

Want to know what‚Äôs the best part about being in America and not China?
---
I can say ‚ÄúFuck America!‚Äù and ‚ÄúAmerica is trash!‚Äù all I want. I am free in this country. China on the other hand is not fucking free.
---
Do you take commissions?

I‚Äôve always wanted to see mei standing up to the tank in tiannamen square. Maybe that robot one is standing with her along with doomfist?

I don‚Äôt play over watch anymore so I forgot a lot of the names.

Yep. Balls. Unlike blizzard

Rogue/Druid stealth tribute runs = 100g+ per hour split two ways
---
A dead zone for warriors is the area between charge minimum and maximum distance. It prevents them from using charge the moment they get out of combat. But the moment the rogue gets out of combat, they can restealth.
---
Just be unpredictable with movements as a warrior, and re-charging is relatively easy.

Then you've answered you're own problem, it doesn't work the same as feign death and only drops agro, so when you're by yourself you're still the only one to agro from

I mean he helped make a game you‚Äôre playing 15 years later so idk who irrelevant in this situation..
---
As a hunter in classic I'd never take an item I get little benefit from that another class gets great benefit from. In my experience it's the other way around. Entitled bullshit warriors taking mail agility gear because "agility helps us too".

I wasn't feeling smug when I made that comment but based on how you responded I'm feeling pretty smug now.

#  &lt;Mischiefs&gt; - Aggresive PvE and Even More Aggressive PvP
---
Alliance | Optional RP | Aggresive PvE pursuit optional | PvP like Gods |
---
**About Us:** Its simple, our goal is to gear up as best as we can, and to cause an absolute pain in the side of the Horde. The atmosphere of our guild is intended to be as laid back as possible, feel free to discuss whatever you like, we're all grown adults so if you want to fuck around and enjoy your time, this is the place. If you so want to have a civil discussion, here's the spot. As long as you don't cause trouble for other guildies, feel free to enjoy the time that you spend playing videogames, especially so if it's being a detriment to the Horde.
---
**Raiding:** Our goal is to gear up as best as a member can get, which means weekly clears of raids and the attempt to acquire BIS for the sake of PVP. As the guild is still growing, we will eventually have a guild wide vote as to what sort of system we will hand out gear, and for raid times that have yet to be confirmed.
---
**PVP:** The good stuff, the reason I hope you showed up to a PVP server, our single goal is to have as much fun with it as possible. I plan to lead the guild through whatever PvP endeavor we want to follow, some days we will raid Orgrimmar and Undercity, other days we may just shut down an entire area of the map until we get an entire enemy raid to fight us. One event I would like to hold constantly is dueling tournaments, where people will better themselves against a class they may struggle against, as well as show off as to who may be the best at their class, encouraging healthy competition between guildmates other than the damage meters.
---
Hopefully, if you're still following along and enjoy what I just posted, you can check us out on our discord and get yourself acquainted, from the best of the best to the lowest of low, in PvP, numbers count and that's what I hope we can get.
---

4chan would be proud
---
Okay then, 2 full layers or 2 high layers or 2 med layers? I mean there is still a noticeable difference between these scenarios.
---
Wow Cant believe I guessed my correct time zone. Sweet.
---
I'm not really sure they could make it visually neat enough to be worth including.
---
Also with mounts in game, I'm not sure where it would fit into the ecosystem. As a racial? But racials are a whole new can of worms.
---
The distance outside of their attack range and inside of the minimum range of intercept.
---
There's a solid 78% chance you'd just be leaving wow to go play another game owned by a chinese company.
---
Just play wow, dude.
---
Whatever company you're switching to would almost certainly do the same if someone used their stream as a platform to put forward their political agenda which is extremely damaging to said company.
---
I think they already said that all realms are down to 2 (or 3?) layers if any at all. So it's still probably safe to assume that any layers means high pop.
---
I could be wrong tho, but I thought I recall reading this quite recently.
---
I‚Äôm personally not deleting my account, but borderlands 3 is pretty fun
---
similar story with my Vanilla guild. Worked our way up from nothing to clearing MC/BWL weekly. Had a couple of officers who were being dickheads. Finally got to the point where we had a chat with them about it they got all pissy about it and started a huge very public shit fight. Emergency officer meeting resulted in them being demoted. 
---
Much butt hurt basically ended up with the guild fracturing into two guilds. That was the last time i was involved in running a guild.
---
Dooooctoooor Knickerbocker Knickerbocker number 9
---
It was an accident, we pushed fly at the same time and so it looked like we were on the same one
---
You also get the gold that was originally the quest reward on top of the XP converted gold
---
He isn't downplaying the skill at all. He just states the obvious. Due to the editing, you can't really see everything. It shows the highlights, which are impressive, but not everything around it.
---
Wow, /u/westhewolf bringing it home
---
Risk not worth rewards in a PUG.  Not even close to worth.
---
You've never seen a 1:13 and you never fuckin will.. 1:12 all the way baby
---
He's lying the real reason why this looks like the map of thousand needles is one of the blizzard Devs went on one of those treasure hunt trips to  glacier point and had to look for a bag with a thousand needles in which  took him a long time to find. He then put the inspiration into the map  of the same name.
---
Pretty much just charge in, use demo shout, pop rage and start cleaving / whirlwind...
---
If they have a couple mages the DPS shouldn‚Äôt be touched anyways because they should be freezing/kiting the mobs properly.
---
Not even sure honestly why those groups invite proper tanks other than to handle the bosses.  When on my warrior if I find out it‚Äôs a spell cleave group I usually respectfully bow out... it‚Äôs just not a play style I like or enjoy.
---
thanks :)
---
If the mages are competent , just keep the bosses and ranged mobs agro‚Äôd.  Mages actually want to keep the agro of everything else in spell cleaves.
---
If the mages aren‚Äôt competent, leave.  The dungeon will be a cluster f*ck.
---
Yes, now it means anyone that gives you advice or criticism.
---
You know, I want to say 'just let the dps-ers die'
---
But - as a war tank - i don't do that. I still think I need to pick up everything despite the dps. Although i will grumble irl.
---
Although i don't follow that advice, you should. it's the only way they learn.
---
you're a tank, you can find another group to run with.
---
I think it still seems safe to assume that if it says layered it has a high population. Ya know, cuz it's still layered.
---
Dungeon grind because solo pveing as a rogue is hell.
---
So much mankrik love in this post, is there a reddit guild or something?
---
Your mother was a hamster and your father smells of elderberries
---
I trap for LOS pulls but 97% of the time someone just ends up breaking them instantly and I usually just give up and stop dropping them. I have also stopped doing it because I have noticed it throws a lot of tanks off and they never pick up the mob after it unfreezes and so the mob just goes to the healer and I have to pull it off them and drag it back to the tank. CC is optimal but most tanks don't seem to understand how to handle it.
---
I felt the same way up until yesterday. Then Blitzchungate happened. Now the Classic experience has become tainted for me.
---
Tanks round up 2-4 packs of mobs with priest bubble on. (LoS if there is casters)
---
Mages rotate frost novas and AoE. 
---
You will lose all threat but don‚Äôt stress with 3 novas the mages can keep themselves safe. Your main job there is to round them up and reap the benefits :) 
---
If Unsure ask mages which groups to pull and to where. Everyone has been shown different ways etc

I don't see why new content even effects casuals really, do it at your pace. People will still be running MC/Ony even when Naxx is out. There will still be content for you do to. As a casual anyway i imagine you aren't going to be realistically seeing more than MC/Ony/ZG/AQ20 anyway...
---
I am fully aware that I ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt be keyboard turning and clicking‚Äù but damn it that‚Äôs what I did when I was 12 and that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm gonna do at 27!

Rerolling currently.  Got a rogue to 37 but tired of the SS spam.  Now I'm a priest

PVP should of been released first, let the raidtards wait.
---
This is very interesting. Logical, the government could not possibly contain the Chinese people in a popular revolt. I'm not sure that any two countries could contain the sheer volume of participants.
---
I have my xp bar only show on mouseover and it is so easy to just zone out and play!
---
Thank you. I did bow out, especially with my last group who just talked shit with out explaining anything. I just want to tank man. I didnt even know why they looked for a tank.
---
Yes, I just hit 60 and cleared Rag on the same day with a pug, topping the healing meters. There were DPS with less damage than the tank, some even went AFK during the boss fight. We wiped 2 times because of too many people AFKing. Some players dealt 15dps in a 5 minute run(5-10 spells casted during the whole time and they lived through the whole fight), no idea how it's possible to do so unless you give absolute no shit about the raid. That was with around 38 players where 5-6 were 56-58. Barely any used GFPP or any other consumables outside of mana pots. You are correct, it's a complete and utter joke, hopefully the future raids provide at least some resistance. Most of the bosses took like 1-2 minutes, I barely got into it before it was over, almost like a dungeon in retail. Thankfully the Rag fight lasted 5 minutes(because of said DPS and AFKers) and felt more complete. 
---
The only way I can see anyone having problems with it is if they're doing it with 25-30 man like you said.
---
no it is not the winterspring saber
---
Raptor is best mount

I was told this is a good rogue resource.
---
Did it in the first week of release, same deal everything respawned bar him so we got to the end and just sighed. To be fair I hadn't slept in three days.
---
Hope not! I‚Äôm trying to level some buddies of mine. Just hope they don‚Äôt get overwhelmed feeling they‚Äôre too far behind. Trying to tell them all my purples doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm lightyears ahead
---
Canceled my sub from USA. Came back for Classic, but its time to go if this is what my money is going to be supporting. Stay strong Hong Kong
---
 No. They‚Äôre transitioning all of the servers to non-layered status. They‚Äôre simply showing which ones still have layering. I believe they said within the next week or two they hope to have all the populations stabilized and remove layering all together.
---
It's insane how many people don't understand that different countries have different rights and laws...
---
If you are trying to level fast to 60 then taking 16 days to do it is incredibly slow. I personally took 6 days and a few hours. Among my friends around 8 hours is average but we all have been playing wow for a decade and played with the intention of leveling fast. My first wow character back in 2005 was a warrior and it took me 15.5 days to hit 60.
---
I feel like this knowledge is lost, never to return
---
I mean he started the fight at half mana. He would‚Äôve wrecked you if he was full lol. Also why even make a video of this?
---
What kind of tips you looking for? They are the best single target dps, best leveling spec is combat, they are mid tier levelers and they have the best skill in the entire game which is stealth. Are you looking for which race to choose and what not? There are a lot of tips to give but not sure which ones you‚Äôre looking for.
---
Does it matter if AQ40 is on farm?
---
If you are casual you aren't going to be doing progression raiding anyway and doesn't that just mean the situation will be easier for you to find gear competent pug raids for the more casual content you will be doing?
---
I just want them to release battlegrounds already. I‚Äôm about to park my character and unsub until that phase.
---
Companies doing this are doing it because of.....capitalism lmao
---
Yeah, so did a lot of other people. They don't act like giant dbags though.
---
That's interesting coming from someone who appears to have no class at all.
---
Yes it is in the same ballpark. It isn't at all clear to private server players which one will turn out to be better. Frostadamus and Jokerd were just arguing about this this afternoon.
---
The friends I sit on the couch and play with are just now lvl45 and complain I have a bunch of epics and already feel behind.
---
Just don‚Äôt want them to get to 60 and feel like the world has done a lap around them.
---
Higher level humanoids drop higher level cloth which sells for more $ on the AH. They also drop higher level grey, green, and blue items as well as higher level potions which also sell really well.
---
Mark‚Äôs head ubrs and hand lbrs.
---
cool thanks!
---
&gt; That has nothing to do with this conversation. The point is clear. People are doing MC en masse right now. If DM is released, people will stop doing MC en masse. Those of us who have not been poopsocking it and are in our 50's right now will just flat out miss the BRD/MC/Ony rush.
---
First off no, they wont stop doing MC. What makes you think that would happen? DM isnt an MC replacement, players will run both until they don't. Secondly, those players that are clearing MC right now are not the players you will be raiding with when you eventually hit 60 yourself. Letting them proceed to the next step has very little affect on a player who has yet to reach the first step. 
---
&gt;It literally does.
---
Why? If a player has finished running MC and got all the loot they wanted they don't usually keep running it just because there is nothing else to do. Some do but most will stop playing or roll alts until new content is released.
---
&gt;I'll spell it out simply for you. I am a consumer for this product.
---
We all are. Just play the game at whatever speed you want and stop asking Blizzard to dictate the speed that other players want to play at.
---
&gt;Dude, it's not like there's this giant mass of players at 60 lmao.
---
So what? It's not like 10% of the players hit 60 first then the other 90% all hit 60 a month later. People are at all stages and there are always going to be players that are multiple content releases behind. It's fine.
---
&gt;I never claimed to have that right. I was giving my opinion on what I think the release cadence of new raids should be, based on my experiences and observations.
---
You want Blizzard to limit the speed at which others progress. I'd call that entitlement. You hold your own enjoyment of the game above others to such an extent that you are willing to ask Blizzard to make changes that negatively affect those other players because you have the delusion that me running DM while you are still running SM somehow ruins your experience. 
---
&gt;No, here's what it's actually like: Mom took two brothers to the amusement park. One brother sprinted at breakneck speed to every single ride and ran them all in an hour. The other brother takes his time, going to the food stands, the little performance shows, the carnie booths, and hits up rollercoasters inbetween. The first brother is now throwing a temper tantrum at how he wants to go to another theme park now and how his brother is such an entitled asshole for not wanting to sprint through the park like him.
---
What? It's not remotely like that. Nobodies forcing you to leave the old amusement park just because the new ones open. Why do you think I would care if you want to stay and enjoy the old one a little longer? I'm not the one telling others how to play here, that's you my dude.
---
Played the beta and then 200 days in a yesrish in vanilla. 
---
Have not hit 40 yet in classic. I don‚Äôt have the time I had 15 odd years ago either ha
---
I‚Äôm not sure how that responds to what I was saying, but I disagree. The concept of ‚Äúbeating‚Äù an MMO is almost nonsensical. There is no end point to classic. There is *always* more to do.
---
Already have an epic mount.
---
60% of the time, it works every time.
---
I'm doing it, but in a banner/badge style, with her from the waist up! (I want people to make it into all sorts of wearable/printable stuff they can wear to the protest, or wear around to show their support! √≤ w √≥ ‚ú®

Yeah, my main is about level 38 now. Please do not cater to the crowd who played on pservers for years. This game is for everyone to enjoy the WoW from back when it was in it's golden days.

I've quit and went to play LoL instead since I wanted to do two things:

1) talk about BlitzChung on [trade]
---
2) do SM Cath
---
This is the first non-Blizzard-Blitzchung post I've seen on any blizzard subreddit.
---
Thank you. I needed a break from all that.
---
why don't you get good instead of harboring feelings of insecurity about your own ability?
---
I don't even feel bad about KOS when I am killing stone elementals. I can almost clear the entire south area before they start to respawn solo. I do feel bad about grouping 3-4 and feigning death near a fellow alliance to get them to piss off though :)
---
I‚Äôm just like you man...long time player, used to be a hardcore raider and clock in over 40 hours a week for years over a decade ago, but now that I have a career and am much older my protection warrior is sitting at level 26 and I haven‚Äôt been able to log on for the last two weeks due to having to travel for work...
---
Seeing the release date for Dire Maul CRUSHED me and made me feel like maybe I SHOULDN‚ÄôT try to keep up with the game this time around, as they‚Äôre clearly going at a much faster pace than most of us fully functioning adults can keep up with. Very upsetting news.
---
Yeah level 41 here as a normal daily player
---
Welp, see you, Blizzard. Classic was nice but fuck that shit.
---
Can they even legally do that?
---
Watching you try to find the correct spell to click on was painful, if you have a disability I'm sorry, but otherwise :0
---
...where it's not wanted or needed, in the form of sarcasm or in a turn of phrase designed to belittle someone. Example A, comparing a behavior to themselves when they were 10 years old.
---
&gt; The double whammy of many players jumping over the last gold sinks and DM farm runs taking off will be pretty huge.
---
I'm OK with this. Midlevel lowbie mats selling for vendor price + 2% makes it a absolute bitch to farm for a lvl 40 mount, as one who is behind the curve.
---
The server-wide gold shortage at the moment causes gold to have more value...thus items sell for less. Vendor price for trade mats is a floor below which an item should never sell. 
---
I'll make a real world analogy - stock options for the future sell for more than the current price of the stock due to time value. That is, if XYZ stock is at $50, a contract to buy XYZ at $50 two months from now has a value of ($50 + some time value of money), which is more than $50.
---
Right now, the server markets that have trade mats selling in the AH for less than or at-vendor prices represents a cash-poor economy (+ irrational/stupid participants) which does not pay any premium for time.
---
The AH on my server literally is too poor to properly pay for the time required to harvest ore/herbs/leather, nor reflect their scarcity.
---
&gt;misdirection 
---
isnt it a BM skill?
---
You killed him. I hope you're happy, you smelly article!

I wanted to pwn some christmas noobs :/
---
Depending on your group it can take up to 3 hours for the whole instance.
---
You can use it to go invisible and get out of agro range of a mob, but if you use it and stay right next to said mob or in agro range it'll keep hitting you.
---
We don't hate Chinese products.  We hate Blizzard's decision.
---
This is a good use of this meme, good work.
---
I'm in a guild with a half dozen relatively try hard buds, and we've been playing together for about 13 years. I made 60 second, on my warrior. Two days ago. With something like 13.5 days /played. Granted, I've definitely burned some time just carrying buds through dungeons, but there just aren't that many 60s yet.
---
edgy
---
i 100% agree with this.
---
i'll hit level 60 this week. and then i have less than 7  days to enjoy THIS current level content before dire maul comes and tops it.
---
thats barely anything. i've spent quite a lot of time playing (not 100% focused on just levelling, of course) but most of my guild are level 30-45
---
nobody is hurrying, and IMO we shouldn't focus on the end game content release, yet.
---
This made me chuckle! Thanks for the post.
---
Same. I don't even have a family, just a 32 year old dude with a job and my main is level 38. The only way for people to keep up with blizzard's release schedule is to either play normally with no job or play every waking hour outside of their job. This is unrealistic.
---
He shoulda won tbh. That was sad
---
Aight. Who let the fucking canadians in. I swear they're ruining online gaming. üò°
---
For duels do you think hardiness has a big enough effect to swing a matchup vs rogue or warrior overall? I heard rogues are a bit nerfed by 1.12 so Warlock should be fine, it not slightly favored vs them by the time they get stage 3 gear and whatnot right?
---
I remember that thing, lived and died by it during TBC. No idea where to find it now though...
---
The druids I‚Äôve killed for this lol. 
---
Run off stealth back in and kill them while they‚Äôre fighting a mob like ‚Äúhey I can be a prick too‚Äù
---
True. I guess I'm looking at it as the person *wants* a higher population. In which case any layered server is a legit option. Not as useful if you're looking for one with less population, but then it begs the question why they wouldn't just pick a non layered one, thus making it irrelevant.
---
The streamer raids where all of the players are streamers or similar caliber players are going just fine.
---
The streamer raids where the streamers are inviting twitch chat and people from city trade and reserving ever item their class can use for the sole purpose of funneling themselves loot are hard stuck on Shazzrah.
---
It's as if world PvP has matchmaking :D
---
classic wow is bleedin players and having trouble keepob players interested. not that hard to see why they would increase schedule pace.

I expect to see BG before eoy
---
Fake news in order to bait the outrage culture cringe kids. OP didn't do his research before posting and probably doesn't even care, they just want to rage about something.
---
Sorry I'm not camping the /r/classicwow 24/7. Thanks for the answer though.
---
I member guilds having to take turns fighting vael otherwise it would lag everyone and cause a wipe
---
Not worth the mana cost, you just stand around.
---
I don't see a big problem with releasin content early if it's rare and just a few dungeons (even tho DM has lotsa gear) simply because the vast majority of people i know will gladly run, say BRD with the people who are not even 56 yet just for the sake of it. 
---
For example, my guildie does MC in pugs right now and has no interest in running dungeons for gear, he farmed his pre raid bis a long while ago but still enjoys doing dungeons. 
---
And now me, i'm a 60 tank but i still run with weak ass groups through BRD and not really farming anything specifically. A HoJ would be nice but i just love BRD and will do it regardless of loot. Even with rando's. Plus, most end game dungeons will still have some items people will want and there will be brackets of players who will need to do endgame dungeons regardless of DM being out.
---
thats what you think
---
You‚Äôre a fucking piece of human trash. Maybe if the police started tear gassing your sister and shooting your mother with rubber bullets before locking you in prison you‚Äôd finally get it through your thick skull how little it takes to take your precious rights away. Grow up and research things before posting you absolute neckbeard asshat.
---
Well, a lot of horrible things going on right now. As I said in other place, there are like ten wars raging currently with ppl dying in the millions. Should we keep reminding ppl about that in childen's game tournament?
---
Haha, Thanks, but I'm an Australian (or as i would prefer to say, desert Canadian).
---
By the end of the year layering will be gone from all servers. If these servers haven't normalized in playerbase yet they will most likely once again have queues as each layer only has room for so many people before it's too much.
---
Phase 2 will not have any layering.
---
I don't see the issue here. You're going at your own pace and you'll run it when you're ready. When that time comes there will be people that have been going at the same pace ready to run it with you. Why does the release schedule matter to you?
---
Nani?
---
May be a bug that it drops agro then, it didnt in vanilla. I'll file a bug report for ya on it!
---
even the people that rush and are currently farming MC don't want content to come out too fast cuz it's nice to take little breathers now and then. HD players need "weekends" so to speak. the weekends are extra time inbetween patches where they can know they are done  with everything, and just have a nice little breather before having to jump on the rush train again.
---
BLIZZ, GIVE US SOME FUCKING BREATHING ROOM WE DON'T WANNA GET STUCK ON THE RUSH TRAIN FOREVER FFS!
---
^^^^^^also ^^^^^^freedom ^^^^^^for ^^^^^^hong ^^^^^^kong!
---
Had this happen to me as well. Needed the rats for a quest, and i told the guy:
---
"Hey can you spare me some rats?"
---
\*He slowly turns and face me\* (I INSTANTLY REGRETED MY DECISION &amp; START TO BACK AWAY) 
---
"Oh" 
---
"Sure" 
---
By then i was quite a distance from him, i felt wrong for disturbing him, like he would turn against me or something
---
Templar.
---
I must be out of it I totally thought dire maul was like a leave 54 instance... and people are already downing rag
---
To be fair, 4 hours a day is a HUGE time investment. That would be more than all of my free time most week days.
---
Loads of people can't manage that.
---
He ded
---
Yeah, I'm not keeping my subscription. Fuck these clowns.
---
I‚Äôve spent thousands as well over the course of twenty years. Canceled my sub today in solidarity with Hong Kong. I‚Äôm absolutely ashamed of Blizzard right now. Good for you op!
---
Hey! this is grobbulus. Just raided with some Nacl members last night.
---
This. And the "p" on superman.
---
I feel like the only thing mechanically intense is the numerous hotkeys I have.  It does become muscle memory though, which opens up brain power to think about the decisions more till those also become second nature.  At 60 for example, I still use every trap type in every dungeon numerous times.  There's also ease of use things you can do.  My hunters mark hotkey is Q, pet attack is ` and autoshot is 1.  Those being close together is on purpose.  I mentally made some close as well.   Aspect of monkey is shift+g while mongoose bite is G.  Concussive shot is E while frost trap is shift+E.
---
The only time i really care about who my pet is attacking is if I'm soloing multiple mobs at a time, or something is going for a healer/cloth and the tank doesn't see or is already occupied.
---
Not sure if I‚Äôm super gullible or this is true.
---
It makes me laugh people can't put two and two together and realize the high level player ganking you is doing it because when he was your level the EXACT SAME THING happened to them.  
---
I just dinged 58 and still get ganked by 2-3 60's while trying to quest, so it doesn't take a genius to guess what i plan on doing when i hit 60 does it?
---
You havent noticed the new genration of no lifers they are crazy savages that stop at nothing and i dont think naxx will slow them down at all
---
So many morons...
---
Fuck off edgelord
---
ZG and AQ20 definitely invalidate old content, though. When ZG comes out, caster BiS turns into ‚Äújust get bloodvine‚Äù
---
1. Tab for timezone.

2. Layered = lots of people needing a layer to share them.

3. Reposted five hundred times today.

I'm sure the device you used to make this post had nothing to do with China
---
you'll be back
---
Getting the name Haliax as a rogue is so perfect.
---
Your screenshot shows you rolled before the message, your "macro" is in the wrong order. You also pressed it multiple times as already pointed out and cropped it for Internet points.
---
I'm not one to hang shit up on my wall. But.... I am moving in a couple of days, and that is a beautiful piece. I would 100% hang that on a wall, maybe even frame it. SOME ONE TAKE MY MONEY
---
8 seems right, in original my fiends and i all took around 10 as total noob new to mmo players without guides or questie or real specs while dicking around etc etc.
---
The only reason naxx wasn't cleared as much was because BC was way too soon after.
---
Fuck China
---
Not sure why you are getting downvoted. This is 100% correct. Specifically for casters at least, there is way more spell power gear that comes from Dire Maul than any of those other end game dungeons.
---
Thanks blizzard for not letting Wow banned in China, bcs politics has nothing to do with games. simple as that. Anyone who uses it as weapon is a bully, like many other 'incidents' that happened between CCP and the other regime, please I just wanna play game. 
---
Games are just games, WoW classic will always belong to people who cares about WoW classic. Fuck the mods for violating rule No.1. /r/hearthstone is already having the discussion no need to open another one in this topic unless you are bumping the influence using your power.  And that defects your authority of being a mod.
---
Thanks for the info tho.
---
Don't get used to him. He'll probably get corrupted by the abyss.
---
True.  Daily quests are time consuming.  Having to do a dungeon to get basic water was challenging.
---
You‚Äôre still supporting blizzard when they robbed a fellow gamer?
---
but what about overpower? ü§î
---
Well maybe the response was too harsh, but I don't see how it justifies ppl unsubscribing etc. There's a point in not letting political statements in sports and e-sports context, I guess everyone can agree to that.
---
F*cking non casuals!
---
I believe that is the winterspring Mount.
---
You‚Äôre so hardcore dude
---
Both on the GCD so not possible
---
Sorry that you are clueless and believe this fake news. Low iq people like you are the reason people post fake news, to get upvotes and Internet credit because they know they post complete bullshit and the outrage culture will fall for it. You are the problem.
---
Right, that's my point.  Speaking for myself, I don't have a 60 yet.
---
My thinking was that as long as it's just DM, we'll be fine.  But if Blizzard plans to release content with the intent on keeping pace with the 4 hours/day folks out there, they are going to move too quickly for the majority of us.
---
"reee im slow reee but i also want to see content when its current"
---
classic players omegalul
---
If AQ/naxx is the next release then casual players are going to face such a shitfest or getting geared. Basically all the crazy good guilds are gonna only accept people who basically maxed their gear out in the first month
---
Buddy you just have shown you don't understand how the world works.
---
I guess just because a country makes many cheap products there is no reason to stand up to the numerous injustices they commit on a daily basis.
---
I'm sure you know nothing of the Muslims they keep in interment camps and secretly harvest organs from because they have a shortage.
---
Grob-mob represent ‚úä
---
Played rogue in vanilla and I can cornfirm this kills even the most stubborn tanks. Garrote &gt; dead zone &gt; reatealth is also pretty nifty against warriors.
---
Remember everyone. It‚Äôs the rich fucks at the top.
---
Herbs, ore, locked chests, skins...  If the node would rot without you there, no one but you has any say in that item's distribution.
---
Only thing to influence this is if the room wouldn't have been cleared, or the boss would not have been killed had there been no skinner in the group.  If the node requires a team effort, inconsistent with the normal flow of the activity, then the whole group should have a chance at the earned reward.
---
In this specific activity, the beast would have been killed regardless of a skinner being in the group or not.  I strongly believe you did the right thing sharing with other skinners while withholding the item from those that could not reasonably gather the item.
---
In raids.
---
In pre raid gear?
---
Nobody is asking for catch up mechanics. In fact they‚Äôre asking for the exact opposite to allow them to play the game WITHOUT the catch up mechanics on the horizon.
---
For leveling as a paladin, would it be better for me to be just constantly running the relevant dungeon for my level range, or to do solo quests? I'm level 20 at the moment.
---
I mean unless they get behind you or stun you, or anything else that prevents dodges...
---
Classic behavior. Working as intended unfortunately.
---
Just leave if you don't like it but that's a dirt move
---
Only if they do a hell of a lot to convince me they stand with Hong Kong. There are other games I‚Äôve been wanting to play.
---
Well, time to never play PoE again.
---
Why can't I hear other players' /train emote? I can see their animation but not the sound. My own one works fine.
---
I hit 60 like a week ago.  Joined a guild 2 nights ago. I've been loving the hell out of classic.
---
Canceled my Sub 30 minutes ago and let the guild know I wouldn't be back online. 
---
Hell, I didn't even give away my ~700 gold just because that might have keep someone who may have been on the fence about staying or leaving from ending their sub as well.
---
holy shit i never realized that
---
RemindMe! 2 Days
---
DM gear trumps some MC gear.

Dirt move on their part?

I‚Äôve got class in spades. I‚Äôm writing this while wearing a tuxedo.
---
I'm seeing on forums a lot of mages rightly complain over randoms in the world or people just opening a window with out saying anything, then i'm also seeing mages in these threads start complaining of party members in 5 mans expecting them to make them water who seem to be missing the point that's their classes utility and it's expected to provide that for a group just like locks are expected to summon/healthstone/ss rogues open locks etc
---
That's a cast sequence which means it will run through the sequence of spells or abilities listed and then start over.  First press is pummel, next press is shield bash, next is pummel...
---
If you want it to be different based on your stance, the best solution is to add something like bartender and just have it swap bars when you swap stances.  Set one bar up for berserker, set another up for defenseive, and don't worry about it.
---
If you don't want a mod then you do what my last suggestion was, and set it up to do a different thing based on what stance you are in (read [this](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Making_a_macro)):
---
/cast [stance:2]shield bash;pummel
---
Or something lke that.
---
Way to necro a month old post.
---
Boycott blizzard ?
---
So.. Anyone else notice how they droped the 8.3 announcement right in the midst of this scandal, instead of waiting for blizcon wich is in less than a month ? Everyone was threatening to cancel their subscription...so they took action. To those saying "oh boy, they surely have a lot more to announce at blizcon if they are willing to give all that info in advance!" : no, they don't. They want you to forget about hong kong and be eager to keep playing.
---
I‚Äôm lost on what to do at 49 right now, doing the beginning blasted lands quests right now but it‚Äôs gonna run out quick. Finished tanaris, feralas, and hinterlands
---
Just day nothing and when the tank pulls start dpsing.
---
Incredible!!! That you‚Äôve missed the other 10 posts that are exactly the same as yours.
---
layered? actually
---
isnt the whole point of this fucking game to be playing with the others on your server?
---
honestly really dissapointed to know that im getting only a portion of the people who are actually playing
---
wtf is that bs? dont we pay 15$ a month to support servers for this exact reason?
---
They should have left the flying mount until level 70 and kept the epic at 60% speed. That way people would still use the 100% land mounts at times
---
I‚Äôve never cared less about anything
---
Just stand around in a popular area and let people ask you for portals (don't even advertise). 
---
I  went to a town earlier after questing and immediately had 2 people whisper me for a portal, the first one to invite me had a party of 4 and they all tipped me 1g each. Then another walked up to me and traded me gold and said "you know what I want", so I left that group and invited him and the other of the two first people to whisper me. That's 6g from standing there for like 30 seconds. I had another ask me shortly after, and that same guy whisper me about an hour later asking if I was still around for another lol - I was, or course! 
---
50g/h farming ZF my ass. I can stand doing nothing and have people throw gold at me.
---
It's amazing that no one else noticed this when they logged in and had to choose their server!
---
It's called a joke lol i guess it requires a send of humor to understand though.
---
I don't know why you would think Communists don't value money. The entire point of it is to create an economic system where they have complete control of all.....money.
---
You cared enough to search for a 24 day old post to comment on.  Good on you!
---
Yeah but when people talk about wpvp, dropping off a flying mount to just gank someone is not what they mean....
---
you are the one redefining it...

I personally dont care, i know what they do to the Uyghur  in the west of China,  and like i said i can assure you you live a life that is very supplemented by the Chinese,  now go away you un subbed  from wow classic so get off this sub
---
I hadn't played WoW since WotLK and tried BfA after it came out. I leveled a mage to 47 and had 3 on my friends list, realized professions seemed pointless, pokemon....really...got bored and stopped playing. The progression system clearly pointed you to get to max level asap. 
---
I started a classic mage a few weeks back and at level 43 am having a blast with no desire to check out, although it seems many are after today's news. I have a long list of friends, a decent (we will see) guild, and the journey matters. 
---
My 2 cent.
---
This has nothing to do with how far advanced the player base is and how many players unsubbed after the first month.
---
Good enough for me!
---
Go to Theramore and farm the turtles along the beach north of town. You can skin them and they have a 35% chance to drop a Speckled Shell Fragment. Stacks of 5 fragments vend for just over 45 silver. Run up the beach then cut over the mountains to the raptor grounds and kill half a dozen or more raptors while turtles respawn and then go back and farm your way back down the beach. 
---
Turtles are 37-38 so in your level range and are yellow mobs so their buddies don't aggro until you are ready. If you are on a PvP server the raptor grounds might be a good place to find gankable hordies.
---
Good human!
---
You got me. I care.
---
TBH I just wished they wouldve announced earlier so I would have had time to level my hunter. Now im stuck at lvl 22 and only got a couple days left to hit 60 to farm with it.
---
Nothing sexual.
---
Hey in other news Foxhole is releasing it's updated zombie mode on the 16th, and Archeage Unchained releases on the 15th.
---
Check the documentary ‚ÄúHarvested Alive‚Äù at 
---
r/documentaries top of all time
---
#nochanges
---
except the changes we want, in which case casuals needs to shut up and accept the easier game
---
Weird that one of the big appeals of WoW classic is that it is less forgiving, yet when it gets made easier posts like this get upvoted.
---
Valve is pulling the same shit, in a different way. Valve panders to China regarding DotA 2. So many Major competitions are being held in Chinese cities and this last The International was held in China.
---
The Chinese website for DotA looks way better than the NA one. There were exclusive rewards for Chinese servers specifically. China HAS their own exclusive server (called Perfect World)
---
There's also the infamous "He was an asshole and we will not be working with him again" - Gaben quote, which happened in China.
---
Only 1 team from NA and SA were allowed through for TI, but China had more than 2 fucking teams. I wonder why.
---
The list goes on.
---
I love that game, over 4k hours, but have not been playing much lately because of some shitty decisions regarding their MM.
---
These are all great points and have seriously lessened my concern. Thanks.
---
ZG is pretty much a catch-up raid.
---
worth, ez
---
Can't there be an exception made, as with why this was posted?
---
Nice video
---
I mean the mage was so fucking bad lol
---
Still don't. Care to explain to a noob?
---
That's fine, I don't mind talking to mods about this (:
---
Haha, brilliant!
---
Its now my goal. I‚Äôm level 44. No where close.
---
&gt;brightness
---
&gt;cognitively 
---
Just stop. Lmao.
---
Mob linking mechanic seems to be different. In classic mobs seem to have invisible perimeter check that chain-pulls anything it comes in contact with (something like 10-15 yards, being checked very fast). In old version I think this "perimeter check" was only triggered on pull plus perhaps every few seconds, so if you pull and FD, mobs that are not leashed probably exit perimeter check before it's triggered again. In current version, even if you reset mobs via FD, they don't leave perimeter check in time and get pulled again. 
---
Fun fact - anything you pull via perimeter breach doesn't necessarily trigger chainpull effect, or at least, not immediately. I have split-pulled many packs like this, even multi-npc bosses, like split-pulling princess away from emperor in BRD.
---
They don‚Äôt support tyranny by requiring people to not side on political or huge issues. The military is the same way lol. You can‚Äôt go around damaging the image of the government. Just like they don‚Äôt want people damaging or implying blizzard supports (x,y,z). People in these comments don‚Äôt really get it, including you.
---
Oh wow....Thanks for answering me!
---
If this were any other phase, I would agree. But nothing about DM or implementing honor is a problem for anyone in terms of progression of the server. We‚Äôre probably still another three to four months from BWL being released. By that point, their should be a very healthy population of 60s who are progressing.
---
As much as I love old school Blizzard, this is the last straw for me.  I am no longer interested in buying their products.  It's clear where their heart is and it's not with us (the end users) anymore.  Fuck them.
---
But his small dog though!
---
The general public started raiding MC far after the release of WSG.
---
See, the thing is the game already is "over" for a significant portion of the playerbase at 60 having already cleared all the content. The games been out for about 50 days when DM comes out. Don't ruin this for us hardcores.
---
I‚Äôve tried the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not here to heals, just going to be DPS‚Äù and then they‚Äôll say they‚Äôre fine with the Druid heals and it‚Äôs clear within the first pull the Druid is not going to keep this group alive.  99% of the time I bone out.  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs wrong to assume that a group doing shit like that will do ninja looting or tell you that the  ‚Äúfull clear‚Äù they advertised early is actually 1 boss clear and reset trying to get a guildy a desired item.
---
We discussed Activision Blizzard in the office today and how destiny is better off on Steam. Now this was the final nail in the coffin. They won't be seeing my money even with the new Warcraft games coming out soon
---
Don't forget all the additional parries you're providing the boss while DW.
---
That‚Äôs just like, your opinion, man?
---
In classic it's fine to tank or heal with pretty much any spec up until around the 50s really. The way talents progress you usually aren't missing much talent wise and it just comes down to having a gear set to swap in to.
---
This isn't right. I don't know what full means exactly, but it does not mean guaranteed queue.
---
6 AM and already the boy ain't right
---
The fix I found was to just disable all addons, move your name plates where you want, then re-enable your addons
---
Pretty sure you can shift click the name from your quest log as well.
---
They still have intercept
---
Agreed.
---
I'm 55 right now and I'm trying to run brd often. But I still have to get questing done while I keep an eye on the world and lfg channels.
---
So I keep my hearth in Kargath.
---
Man it‚Äôs so long ago I almost forgot I played it, you‚Äôre bringing back memories. I think I got as far as owning a rowboat and then I kind of lost interest, mostly because my computer at the time was absolute crap running it at 10-20fps.
---
If you go Engineering on a Warrior the leveling process is 100x less painful
---
So capitalism good or bad?
---
Oh no mate, I wasn't meaning that in a hostile way.
---
What I meant is I've seen the question, but no one has ever had an answer. So even if I don't definitively know it can't be done, it seems like probably not.
---
That's the whole point of this thread, simple questions :)
---
He's not talking about making money on the auction house.
---
You can make 50+ gold an hour simply selling everything to a vendor, and vendor prices don't change.
---
Not at all.
---
Welp, was getting tired of classic wow anyway.  Hello extra $15 month!
---
Honestly the only way to really move up in the service industry, besides getting the best weekend shifts for a server/bartender, is to move to a more upscale/higher volume restaurant.
---
I‚Äôm only 24, so I don‚Äôt need to worry for at least another 10 years, but I would never want to move into management. It‚Äôs actually probably a net loss in income for most.
---
The game died 7 or so years ago so pretty sure that‚Äôs near impossible. Although my wording when typing a post on the fly is that of a 12 year old yes.
---
What did Valve do?
---
i knew about it but now the server i actually play on says "layered"
---
now im just speechless its actually a thing that they're blatantly making known. fuck this shit
---
i dont want this to be the norm, dang
---
Not really. For China they can wipe any mention of this from their media. For outsiders they *want* you to see what happens when you make a negative comment about them. That's the point.
---
How long is your turnaround? I need to set up remind bot.
---
Why? If the end cost is the same why would they not continue eating out? Vast majority tip expected rates and net change is zero. Losing the top and bottom outliers would not kill the industry as many countries without tipping culture can attest. Making it much more stable employment would likely raise overall quality of service... at least that has been my experience eating out abroad vs service at home. Especially in mid to low tier establishments. High end doesn‚Äôt seem to change much.
---
My wife started on stardew valley and I got her into csgo.
---
I agree the quests are more fulfilling but the dungeons with a good group is much faster exp. I barely did the dungeons on my first toon but on alt I‚Äôm leveling now it‚Äôs SM all day
---
People dont want to play endless catchup but want to be endlessly leveling at the same time? Choose ur poision. DM means nothing in terms of content anyways, all it means is that theres 3 more worldbuffs to get before raid. This casual whine is what got us to bfa, think of that before u write another post like this.
---
So when we burn their nests... Oh no...
---
It's 100k+ strong right now via a EMU Relaunch.

That was an impressive put-down. Kudos.

yep

If they sit down while almost dead to drink, it's perfectly fine to blow sprint to get over there in time to ambush them.

Yeah me too Tsirup here, a lot of us are on Herod now with PTA.
---
Hosted TI9 in China, with all the restrictions that carries. Also partnered with the Chinese government to create a censored version of Steam for use in China.
---
Oh I was so frustrated. Had one drop left for the quest. Was at the bones and AoE'd 6 of them with my mage. They were almost dead when a rogue popped out and ambushed me. After the quick run back I found that he had killed them all and left.
---
Did you know you could also aim the camera down and limit your tabbs to the field of view?
---
classic wow had no catchup mechanics and that's what a lot of people claimed to like about it.  it's \*extremely non casual friendly\* and you have to put in a shit load of time to see everything, just traveling around can take hours a day.  Play retail if the pace of content is too fast.
---
she's jeeking DEAD, dude

i can't believe you dooked her in the ooker, varok. have some standards
---
I'm a semi-hardcore player in a semi-hardcore to hardcore guild. 
---
Anyways, noone in my guild gives a shit. We made plans to farm DM next week to get our BiS pieces.  
---
Your guild doesn't reflect all of the "hardcore" players, neither does mine.
---
Awesome!! I can't wait!
---
Join the... *other* servers. Enjoy the game, keep the money away from appeasers.
---
Lol 54 and the GM of my guild, I don't want any member to feel like there is any pressure to get to 60, MC isn't going anywhere.... I have no idea why people choose to not stop and smell the peacebloom as they go.
---
Your talking about WoW right? I honesty didn‚Äôt expect much out of this reddit boycott but it seems it barely even scratched XD
---
That'd be a great way to get this entire subreddit DMCA'd by Blizzard and killed.
---
(sidenote, Reddit is also partially owned by Tencent)
---
&gt; which is not what the majority of players want.
---
It's funny how the vocal minority always claim their voice is the majority.
---
Go back to retail
---
might be sooner. (am staying up all night to work on it, chugs energy drink)
---
Yeah I was doing that the first 2 weeks classic came out and burned out HARD. I‚Äôd put in my 8 hours at work then put 10-12 in wow. By the end I was so exhausted I wasn‚Äôt even enjoying myself so I slowed down.
---
&gt; I‚Äôm addicted as hell to classic
---
That is exactly why you need to quit. There is so much you could be doing with your free time. But you will never see it when all you can think about is the game.
---
You‚Äôre 100% correct about the fix to itemization. The Valor set still has spirit on it, a relic of the past when spirit effected proc rates. All of the tank gear in DM is properly started with Strength (threat), Stamina, good armor, and defense or another form of avoidance.
---
Thanks lol. I‚Äôve been playing on and off and it‚Äôs just as good as I remember.
---
He was embracing the American culture of not knowing about the culture of other places
---
The king is dead. Long live the king!
---
I had the same concern, I love the game exactly how it is but don't even have a level 30 yet.  I want classic to be around for the long haul, not just a year or two.
---
someone might say some good things when you ded tho. which is nice
---
OP you're so incredibly dumb, and this sub is so retarded it should be illegal. Jesus Christ, how do you manage to write so much trash without putting in 30 seconds of research beforehand? 
---
Low qualitiy shitposts like this one are the exact reason why no one at Blizz gives even the slightest of shits about what reddit says.
---
If you can't tell whether or not it's sarcasm you probably think you're making a difference jumping ship while having hundreds of china-made products in your house right now.
---
&gt; Hoping Blizzard acknowledges that hunters are a dumpster fire
---
Cute snarky link tho
---
There are parts of Maraudon where humans and Nelves can walk but gnomes have to swim

Happy to help. Feel free to sell if you want other macros. 
---
Here‚Äôs a bonus macro:
---
Charge if out of combat, intercept if in combat
---
    #showtooltip [combat] Intercept; Charge
---
    /cast [combat] Berserker Stance; Battle Stance
---
    /cast [combat] Intercept; Charge
---
One more useful one: 
---
Overpower from any stance
---
    #showtooltip Overpower
---
    /cast Battle Stance
---
    /cast Overpower
---
Note, this one puts you in battle stance.

you‚Äôre a fucking idiot.

All he has to do is enter from the back gate through the Barrens

If this happens can someone send me the link...?
---
Unless druid is a guildie, it's unlikely they are doing it intentionally (and the guy asking probably noticed druid not having healer gear or smth).
---
On top of that, if druid is hybrid spec (popular build), it's very strong in both roles - tanking and healing, if you swap gear (far better healers than any other offspec healer, like enh shaman or spriest). So the only explanation I can think of is either druid forgot/didn't bring healer gear or he's clueless.
---
LMAO you still support them by playing it and inflating player numbers, pirate all you want your crappy protest does nothing
---
Whitemane.
---
Hi may I ask which add on you have to make your UI have the durability/exp/bag space all on top of your screen in a neat bar?
---
Here for this as well
---
Son't watch watch me too closely! (I get nervous)  √≥ ^ √≤;;;
---
i know its prolly heresy but i would love a bought level 60 upgrade somewhere down the line . I am just not build for the leveling anymore and quit my subscription but i really wanna raid MC just once or twice for old times sake, i had great nostalgia the first of half of this first month of classic . it is how it is and i guess maybe they limit it to a couple servers . idk ...
---
No reason to rush you'll still get farmed even if you're a geared 60 if you're out solo
---
I never played WoW for more than like a month tho. This post is however for those who did.
---
Haha sorry I got your hopes up man :(
---
The word of the week is farce!
---
Blizzard, on behalf of "humanity", please search for morality
---
Mao destroyed chinas history. The country is soulless driven by pure unadulterated power and greed.
---
I hope Hunters roll on all of Xi Jinping's weapons.
---
no you cant
---
watch JRE podcast with Matthew Walker
---
No shit. 
---
But in current retail you can expect to take your time and play pretty casually and still make it through the normal mode raids.
---
Vanilla you won't.
---
My wife saw the 6 legs back during vanilla and still hasn't stopped asking "don't they know what crocodiles look like?", as I run around as a giant magic cow...
---
Sub rogue here, can confirm it isnt as great but still as fun
---
Good tanks are hard to find.
---
I dinged 60 on the 10th day of release with a gametime around 5 days and a half... and I consider myself casual... dunno what are you guys wasting your time on(in game).. even if you have job if you were motivated enough you can easily level up to 60 by now in weekends. You guys taking all your time to level up with a 30 days in game time till 60 yet complaining about fast releases... im sorry. You can literally level up from 50-60 in a day and a half while getting half of your bis pieces.
---
But compare people who cheat in game that is too much
---
It's not nochanges when there's a literal patch note for this...
---
In solidarity from the States. I hope you and yours are ok, and achieve the dream you‚Äôre protesting for. Canceled my sub this morning when I read the news.
---
you know you could just buy it and resell it 
---
omg but yes they are the ‚Äúworst‚Äù
---
Duo questing. Me and my GF level up way slower together than when I play my main. The Exp is halved, the quest exp doesn‚Äôt make up for that. And you have to travel to new zones for fresh quests. 
---
While you got 1 level 60 in 120 hours. They will have added 2 to the pool in slightly more time. 
---
Not to mention their play style. If you read all the quests, enjoy the lore, do the dungeons in appropriate order. It adds a significant amount of time to progress. Not saying they did that. But that is the way vanilla was designed to be played.
---
Yeah, I don't even remember it coming out, and I played Vanilla since release because it took me an age to hit 60.
---
I miss the days where the majority of the community was new to mmos and even RPGs and therefore gave no craps about min/maxing and RPGed for the sake of it. There was something about discovering your own strats for every dungeon in a more organic fashion rather than watching a youtube video that made it so much funner.

I cancelled my WoW sub tonight because of this. This is absolutely disgusting. They won't get another dime from me until they reverse this action, rehire the interviewers, and apologize.  Western companies that enjoy the privilege of freedom of expression and the protection of Democratic government should always advocate for freedom, not tyranny. The DPRC is exterminating and/or "re-educating" Uigher Muslims in internment camps, and using the police to quash dissent among the Hong Kong populace. These are the actions of monsters, the enemies of freedom.
---
Blizzard is supporting them and their "Thought policing" of dissenters with actions like this. All it takes for evil to triumph is for good people to do nothing, by banning Blitzchung, Blizzard is supporting the DPRC. 
---
We thought Blizzard was better than this, they SHOULD be better than this. Shame on them. 
---
.#fuckblizzard
---
Elle bers.
---
On top of all this, the leveling experience is a dream. (My first character I leveled was a warrior) Life as a druid couldnt be better. 
---
But I Gotta ask how you deal with Hunters. Ive been hibernating the pet, rooting the hunter and casting in their dead zone only to be oom in seconds... and we deal horrible damage casting. Alternative line i‚Äôve found is chain feared in cat/bear. Help
---
I am NOT American if that is what you are implying,  I would shoot myself before i live in that shithole
---
BWL will be cleared within a few hours of release. The same will happen with AQ if C‚ÄôThun is released in its final state.
---
Naxx is where things get interesting. Only the most prepared raids will have the chance to clear it Day 1 release.
---
And the raids you will be getting access to only being able to put in 1 night a week you will still be able to get access to while the hardcore are on AQ40. I don't see what your problem even is here. If you expect to be making it through aq40 and naxx on 1 raid night a week that's not a reality. If you are worried that people won't still be running mc/ony then thats not going to be a problem because there will still be groups for that.
---
It was a joke
---
In a **very** long stretch and still mostly unacceptable, I could understand possibly *only* a future 1y ban from pro play.
---
But to strip rank and even take back the prize money is super shitty; even more so that the interviewers also got fired. **That** really cements Blizzard's disgusting stance.
---
Priests and healers in general on the Horde side
---
I am going to install and play this because they are doing this. Morals matter people!
---
Mei is Bei!!!
---
What about pallys? I can kill them sometimes but only if I get a lot of crits. Since they basically have 2 health bars üòë
---
What in Dire Maul is creating gold?
---
No idea this was a thing, NICE!!!
---
Damage control!
---
(didn't even know there was a 8.3 announcement though, so I guess it isn't totally working)
---
I know i rushed my way to the 60 (and i really, really wasn't the fastest even amongs my friends) but I desesperaly wanted Dire Maul. Why ? Because I'm a warlock. I wasn't 60 when I already saw people riding epic mount, and I can't get mine until phase 2. Yeah I could buy it but I'm not paying it twice, I want my dreadstreed !
---
It needed to be released quick. Now I have what I want, I will soon ride my demonic goat horse thing. Phase 3 can wait ! My guild took down Ragnaros tonight for the first time, we don't want BWL to be released any time soon. I just want my demonic pony. And As I saw in the comments it's not filled with high level gear, all sounds good.
---
If BWL is released too soon, then we can talk. But it sounds like it will be "before the end of the year", which mean, in Blizzard's language, "the 31 december at 11:55 PM". So far it looks great
---
Whoever was responsible for this needs to be destroyed.
---
time is a circle. classic too hard &gt; whine for 3-4 expacs &gt; modern wow style &gt; complain it's too easy &gt; get classic &gt; complaing it's too hard &gt; etc
---
stop. you're doing it again. DM is still going to be there, join a guild. back in the day during actual vanilla wow there were guilds clearing MC while some were clearing AQ40. Who gives a shit?
---
This is disgusting.  Video games should be used as escapism from the shit world.  Keep all this political horseshit the fuck outta here.
---
The fuck u talking about
---
Yea, Druids don't actually use their weapons in forms so skill is not relevent. It is why all Druid weapons are just considered stat sticks and the mace from gnomer continues to be a very good option for them.
---
There's so much content you are missing.
---
Veterans will call it pointless but out leveling zones and straight up skipping or dropping quests is jarring for new players. Many want to do it all, in order, or at a pace that feels natural not on steroids.
---
30-40 has SM
---
I did.
---
I got burned couple time too, they lf1m DPS, I said that I am DPSing as warrior then once I joined, the party is like a druid + 3 clothies(mage and lock). Unless druid can tank and heal at the sam time, I am like "wtf".
---
Holy shit... 35 reddit golds for a twitter link
---
Gotta nolife to get it done
---
BWL won't be the same imo
---
Guilds who have prepared and been doing it on pservers will floor stomp it in hours i imagine
---
But we won't see pugs cruising through like they can with MC/Ony
---
BWL was still tough
---
No one said cancelling WoW supports the HK protesters. Everyone cancelling has said they won't support a COMPANY that stands by the CCP in a manner such as Blizzard. You are really missing the point here.
---
Dont deal with hunters?
---
gratz, wonder how many know what these icons are (not a mage thing)
---
I do this like every night and my girlfriend hates it but hey when you get that group that‚Äôll do 4 runs of SM or ZF.... it‚Äôs gonna be 4 am
---
It is now :)
---
why the hell would u NOT want to play on a populated server?
---
they should just get rid of layering period, not just force ppl into playing on lower populated ones
---
Cringe
---
I did this a lot back in WotLK when I had satellite internet. I'm a little sad I can't get it to work now that I have fast internet.
---
Grats, but now your guild isn‚Äôt going to let you touch another 1H for the rest of the game and you still have two more phases to go.
---
...also, I‚Äôd be fine with that too.
---
NAWWWWWWWWWWWWW BRAHHHHHHHHHHHH
---
It can be brought back (:
---
its just a reskinned hawkstrider :^)
---
My sister and I love wow and play together whenever we get a chance (we both have lots of college needs to fullfill first is the thing preventing us from playing) we are lvl 30 now, and my solo account is lvl 20 
---
So I would consider that to be the avg player and their level; ie someone who makes an effort to play but has a ton of stuff to get done first
---
I get that warriors actually use agility. I'm just saying I see why hunters roll on whatever they possibly can since warriors feel entitled to everything but cloth.
---
hey I'm already on Yojamba can I please has :&gt;
---
I love them especially the 100% ones
---
No PvE to PvP.  You could do PvP to PvE though on retail.  It's to prevent people from taking the easy route on PvE servers then switching omce they have everything without the whole risk reward system.
---
this will not be something blizzard would do,   what would happen is people would "level" on a pve server and gear up as a fresh 60 and then transfer to a pvp server, which i am sure you can see why they wouldnt let that happen.
---
It has about 3500 on average. Did it have a spike to that many at some point?
---
I'm pretty sure you have no idea what layering does/is used for.
---
You think this is the only sub that has links to private servers?
---
I'd really like to see an infographic with statistics that shows the distribution/curve of all classic players and their levels.
---
My guess is the vast majority would not even be level 50 yet.
---
Probably the worse thing that can happen
---
I find it no more boring than any other class. What part is boring? Having stealth and sap and the like make it more interesting than some others imo
---
Do you need examples provided where companies changed their stance after consumer outrage. Consumer outrage being, their products getting boycotted.
---
Do you tell Union members on strike the same shit you're spouting off here?
---
OverwatchContenders chat is full of spam bashing Blizzard. Appears to be no moderation currently
---
So overblown, there's people in raid gear that are going to blow through and carry people through these dungeons. It's lv 55 content which get's you to 60, If you're not 60 you should want this content released!
---
Interesting. I assumed you you wouldn't be able to talk to the npc while it was in combat, and assumed it would quickly run back to the inn once combat ended.
---
&gt;  three months into the original vanilla release.
---
*1 month for EU. Actually as /u/qp0n said this is SLOWER than EU release.
---
This post will be removed like the rest of them.
---
Engineering if done properly while leveling will more than pay for itself. Bronze tubes on the alliance side are quest items for two quests, and cost 90c and 2 bars of bronze each to produce. So long as you do your own mining, mass production of engineering items can be decently lucrative as a leveling profession.
---
Harpies in 1k Needles drop Vibrant feathers that sell for 8.5s and spawn endlessly. Gorillas in STV frop tufts of hair that sell for 11s.
---
Just dinged 40 on my mage. After realizing how many undead mages there are I may roll a new toon for raiding, considering a Druid or shaman for healing, help!!!
---
doesnt it seperate players?
---
basically makes it so theres servers within servers? am i wrong?
---
You need to import a string into Pawn in order to use the scaling.  Otherwise you manually type in the numbers.
---
Many reasons:
---
1. Most dungeons are organized &amp; tanked by warriors/druids - neither want any melees rolling on their dps gear
---
2. Rogues don't bring much utility - no buffs, can't summon anyone, can't  cc, can't aoe.
---
3. Even while leveling you'll notice that any melee cleave will take warr over rogue any day (far more potent cleave/aoe once they get ravager/sweeping strikes/whirlwind).
---
4. Because rogues are strong in duels/skirmishes, class is rather overplayed. As a result you either have to take up leadership roles (organizing groups for yourself) or you get left behind.
---
what is sad is you think every other sovereign nation in the world needs to do what the american people feel is the right thing......
---
if its mandatory its not a tip
---
Overpower is a warrior ability that is made available when an opponent dodges an attack. Rogues have high dodge chance and their ability evasion makes them dodge almost everything, so they literally have Overpower used against them more than other classes.
---
Thanks, I saw some tests done on the Beta and the findings were unfortunately similar. Still, even though they don't scale they deal a ton of damage baseline (especially if you go full Assassination poison spec).
---
I get this joke and I haven‚Äôt played since actually vanilla.
---
You only do that once as a rogue.
---
Nah China is definitely bad, but any company would've done what Blizz did in their situation. China is a massive market and a gold mine for them.
---
Does it make it right? No.
---
Hear me out on what would be a good idea:
---
Classic+ 
---
Don‚Äôt raise the level cap, just release a new zone for us that contains a new raid (I think two raids would be ideal) and a dungeon. You have to grind out reputation instead to unlock a VERY LONG attunement quest chain that spans the entirety of Azeroth and all the old raids/dungeons so they stay relevant. Put in a WPVP incentive, where holding sections of the zone provides buffs like ‚Äúincreased rep gain‚Äù or ‚Äúincreased loot drops‚Äù for things like cloth, mining, so on so forth. New patterns, new minerals, new leather to make the economy fair like they do with new expansions, only that this time it‚Äôs locked to one zone so it‚Äôs much harder to farm and it can‚Äôt be flooded in the AH so it makes those materials valuable for a long time. 
---
This helps keep the game fresh because the old content stays relevant and we don‚Äôt have to wait two years for a new zone. Keep adding a new zone every 6/8 months so that content rolls out at a steady pace but not at the rate to where players are either overwhelmed with the new content continuously coming out and the more hardcore players have new things to look forward to. 
---
Obviously there‚Äôs other things they could add, but I think that would be a good baseline start.
---
\*apply dots, then process to heal/shield my whole health bar twice in 10s\*
---
I don't get it
---
\*fear the rogue and apply first aids\*
---
It's not a race. You can level as slowly as you please. You won't miss anything. Stop bitching.
---
You don't have to no life to clear the content lmao. You just have to know what you're doing. Games easy leveling included.
---
You‚Äôre dumb
---
haha I remember some guy from my raiding in guild in Wrath making a big show of quitting WoW, basically calling us all idiots for not quitting WoW and jumping ship to Rift, telling us how we were going to be left in the dust, etc. The week before it launched he basically made himself a pariah on the server because all he did was talk shit about WoW and argue about Rift in trade chat all day, every day.
---
When I'm very tired I'm a lazy grouch so I guess it could be argued that getting barely any sleep isn't the best for everyone.
---
So your argument is that since the average WoW player cancelling their subscription isn't willing to commit a crime punishable by years in prison they aren't doing anything?
---
You sound like a fucking idiot bruv.
---
Had a similar situation a few days ago but not the role bait and switch but the run.  Been through Mara 40 times going for the damn ring.  Got it for many people I just always lose the roll, they might stick around a few runs after to help but no ring drop and they bounce which is understandable and happy they tried for a few extra runs for me each time being their tank. 
---
 Now 2 nights ago a group looking for tank for mara.  I ask if they are doing princess runs and the guy says yes, cool... I'll tank it for you.  Take a boat start flying over then one of them is taking about making the scepter.  I voice my concern saying I was told it's a princess run and if it isn't im out.  They want to do the whole thing so I politely decline and drop group.  Then one of them blasting me with whispers why I would wait so long to leave like im the bad guy for being lied to and I should still tank their run.  Explained as soon as I found out it wasn't a princess run I said something about it and didn't wait at all and told him i was told it was a princess run.  Tries to tell me it is a princess run while doing purple also.  I explain how that is not as it adds 45 to an hour to the run and apologize and say im out as i was misled.  This guy still thinks I'm away fault but whatever, don't lie to get people to come.  I didn't say that part just politely apologized and left it at that. 
---
People are shady, they may or may not have been trying to act that way but it happens.
---
You thought it was u/Silent_Killer093 that noticed but it was actually me DIO!
---
I just use questie and just look at what quest are available and what the lvl req is
---
Broke immersion, quitting wow
---
Apparently a lot of it is straight gold farms. Gold and gray items that are effectively gold
---
Never
---
Does this exist in epic mount variety?
---
That‚Äôs not that unreasonable
---
Many of those levelers are actually alts (mages are probably the best farming alts).
---
I don‚Äôt have a problem with this
---
Let me explain why before I get downvoted into oblivion.
---
Make sure you read this:
---
&gt; 2019 HEARTHSTONE¬Æ GRANDMASTERS OFFICIAL COMPETITION RULES v1.4   p.12, Section 6.1 (o)
---
&gt;Engaging in any act that, in Blizzard‚Äôs sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image will result in removal from Grandmasters and reduction of the player‚Äôs prize total to $0 USD, in addition to other remedies which may be provided for under the Handbook and Blizzard‚Äôs Website Terms. 
---
Understand that it‚Äôs not that the competitor had his views about Hong Kong, but that he essentially went behind Blizzards back, using their stage, podium broadcast,  and used their brand to say what he wanted to say, with full understanding that it would offend a group of the public and damage Blizzard‚Äô image.  
---
It‚Äôs disrespectful to the tournament and to Blizzard. Blizzard wants no part in controversy and they had to make a choice that would affect their brand, and they made the choice to side with the rules that were already established. 
---
I would be upset had Blizzard disqualified this competitor for some of his views he shared on stream etc. But this is not that case.
---
Maybe google winterspring frostsaber before you comment.

---
That's the essence of Vanilla wow though. I can't think of any aspect of the game where hardcore players aren't favored over casuals.
---
OP posts his own prediction that most people with a brain could see a mile away.
---
No; I was going to say that this is a popular subreddit though, but then again if wowservers is allowed to still exist all this time, I guess it's not really a concern.
---
I probably will. I try not to but sometimes it's to cheap to pass up or the only option.  That being said it's more about the fact that blizzard is an American company. Blizzard decides to punish a pro player for supporting protestors who only seek freedom/independence from China.  They also fired casters who had fuck all to do with it.  I mean it's not like the pro player is supporting terrorism or calling for violence. They're literally protesting for what Americans already have and take for granted every single day.  https://youtu.be/L3tnH4FGbd0
---
who cares that the pc was made in china, the knights if morality sure do not
---
Blizz came out in the past couple of days (I think?) And said we should expect Phase 2 before the end of 2019. 
---
That might sound alarming to some people, but if you look at Blizzard's track record in "ETA" releases... they pretty much push them as FAR as they possibly can. 
---
Example: Early on, Classic was announced as "Summer 2019" and we ended up getting it literally in the last week of summer. (I know not technically, but I think most people consider Sept. the start of fall)
---
I wouldn't be surprised if we get phase two the last week of December, which gives us like 2.7 months until we get that content.
---
Yeah, my mind is pretty much, 'I'm a war. Ima gonna die' 
---
I just try not to die a lot. ^_^

South Park nailed it. Sucking China's dick for greed.

What did Blizzard do to hurt you?

There's easily 10k people that have cancelled their subs. There appears to be over 1000 in this thread alone.
---
I woke up from my nap. Saw the article. Read the article. Went to [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) and immediately cancelled my subscription and made sure they knew the reason.
---
This is my life right now.
---
Back in June/July when it launched which is why I said up there \^" You're late to that ship. That was a June Ship... "

Yet whenever I log out in one of the comfy inn chairs, I will stand somewhere in the room when I log back in...

I grinded out a lot of levels in dungeons. So every time I did quest, I pulled a nice 35-40k exp per hour.
---
Rogues can CC..
---
Imagine playing to please a beaver man
---
I'd do the same, but unfortunately, I'm still on the time I got from using my old retail gold to buy tokens.  I'll be letting my remaining time run out but I can't leave a message as I don't have a sub to cancel.
---
I don't think it will. Nothing procs on ravager spin, only ravager itself afaik.
---
All i k wo is i  retail dungroning id just click the button, join the group, nobody ever said fuckal to each other because it never mattered, rinse repeat. All the little steps do actually make a big difference in the social aspect of the game.
---
Slower, but more fun I'd say. Me and my mate have two alts that we only play on together. I'm in a guild with some pretty hardcore levelers so I was pretty much alone the entire way to 60.

pray that blizz fixes viper sting so you can protect your mana, liberally use bear form.
---
True. 
---
Which is probably why I thought there were catering to the fast levellers.
---
We'll see how it turns out though.
---
Hib their pet, then i go bear form and eat them while they struggle to get away from me and fail. Sometimes i even leave their pet active so it gives me more range so i can eat the hunter faster.  
---
If they frost trap you, just dip out then back into a form. If they try and Scare Beast, just dip out then back in. As long as you have mana, you will win.
---
If you don't have a lot of mana, bear form charge into bash into entangling roots(so he cant interupt) then travel form away.
---
Woaaaaaah, were you caught in the onslaught? XD
---
That same mindset is why there is a prison reform issue in the US.
---
Onions like ogres have layers
---
Nice
---
246 why do you no longer want to support blizzard?
---
Phase 2 is next week. Let me find a link.
---
whojamba?
---
On paper, probably, but leveling makes me want to gouge my eyes out so I try to avoid it at all cost. It's most of why I always roll a druid :)
---
Thank god he got rid of that pesky family and job interfering with his wow classic time.
---
I have played wow for on and off since vanilla. Still have yet to find a "guild" or a sense of friends to play with. Since classic is finally out i do plan to play long term again. Do want to find a guild to run with just seem like most of the time you always find a few people in the guild who leave a bad taste. But its surprising when you play solo or if you happen to make your own guild what you will achieve or even enjoy it as you can make it more free in a sense.
---
Wut? Ever since 55 I've been leveling like it is nothing. I only actually gathered XP between half of 57 to 58 now, because I've got all I need from BRD and idiots don't realize that a level 57 deep resto is entirely alright in a 10 man LBRS run.
---
I mean I log on twice a week (Monday/Thursday) for about an hour and clear all the raids.
---
Once you're 60 you can manage the time easy if you know what you're doing.

Is there anything that can be done to griefing( spelling) this person waited till the end to start pulling 5+ monsters and at first he said he messed up or some shit and we didn‚Äôt do anything but then they pulled like 20+ monsters in DM at the very end.  They kept pulling instead of letting the tank.
---
^Blizzard LOL

You‚Äôre sounding like a real loser

Ignoring it would be an absence of opinion. Coming down hard on them is definitely not.

It really is *that* simple.

That's completely fine. Like I said before, you should progress at whatever speed you want. I'm not telling players to speed up and it annoys me when they don't offer the same courtesy in return by telling me to slow down.
---
I'm all for keeping vanilla untouched but keeping to the original release schedule is just unrealistic. Majority of players, including the casual players, will reach milestones with considerable less in game time spent than they would have during the original release of WoW. The player base is simply far more experienced that they were 14 years ago.

I like the Moonglow-balance/restro hybrid for healing. Very mana efficient and still able to do serviceable caster dps while also able to heal.

Meh, I got lvl 42 in a few days and after launch and I got over it. Then all this Chinese propaganda reminded me to stop giving them money.
---
Haha I was kidding :) You're on alliance and I'm on horde. I will /wave if I see you around though!
---
Or you could unsub and stop giving money to a company who is supporting a tyrannical dictatorship.

Awesome post, glad I read it all the way through

Level 40 around went relatively well for me because I still had the entire Badlands. But yeah, I've had the luck of running ZF at level 43.

Haha ok great my mains are Cherries or Ogion. Happy hunting.
---
Honestly? Just keep questing, you‚Äôll make enough gold soon enough. Rewards from quests get much better after 40.
---
No one knows. Curious, why wouldn't you want new content after the phases are done?
---
It's not only itemization, but also knowledge. Back then people had to learn by trial&amp;error. Now all that knowledge is 1 click away.
---
Over the game and this China bs is lame.
---
Every time I take the Deeprun Tram from Ironforge to Stormwind I melee rats until the train arrives. Every extra point of weapon skill is less of a chance of one of my Wing Clips missing., and it's not like I'm really getting them anywhere else. 
---
Also, unlike other critters, the rats in the Tram fight back. I've never seen one do any actual damage, but occasionally your Defense skill will go up too. 
---
When I hit 60 I'm going to grab a quick, low-level white of each weapon type I don't have already and grind them up to max. Leveling multiple weapons should take enough rats to cap my defense as well.
---
I already canceled sub.  Friends are all scattered on different servers because the launch was a disaster like we predicted.  Until server transfers are a thing the game is basically not worth the time investment.
---
BIS fishing pole
---
Imagine pug running suppression room on horde.
---
I fully agree with your post. I am stoked that dire maul is coming out early, but I would also enjoy hitting 60 and being on a playing field with others that don't have everything BiS for months. Its probably very hard for them to figure it out. They want to keep streamers and diehards entertained, but changing the timeline can hurt others who are putting time aside to get to these points. This is not a job to everyone and I hope that this is felt on blizzards end!

Fury/Prot isn't just about getting hit cap and you being good to go. It's more about having a higher crit chance than what's really available in P1. You want a high uptime on Flurry for several reasons. The added damage on your white hits alone is a lot but it's also about the rage generation. BT is 30 rage, Shield Slam is only 20, both are something you want to be hitting on CD with their respective specs. More rage, faster attack speed, also means more HS's. Deep prot also usually has more mitigation in mind. Not just with talents but with gearing. It's your gear, 4% armor, your ability to block and the \~2k armor for the lack of a shield. Yes you could probably find +crit% gear but it tends to be things like devilsaurs. In later phases you start finding more plate with agility on it. So idk where all of this was "thoroughly tested" and why it set you off so badly but man lol just fury/prot is better in later phases, not so much rn.
---
Paying for quality service isn't exclusive to America. Some countries feel it's on the server to go over the top IF they want more money. They will still be paid a livable wage and not expected to break their back. It's a job, not your life. 
---
Keyword livable. I couldn't imagine having such a volatile job where you aren't 100% sure what your next day will bring in terms of cash. It's not healthy mentally.
---
I mean, this isn't retail.
---
It's not the tanks job to run after every single mob that they lose aggro on.
---
DPS don't get to just AFK murder things and expect not to get hit.
---
Tanks need to focus on holding the hardest hitters and the DPS need to understand that they have survival CDs that they will need to use.

Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh thanks lol

In the eyes of most players - they can't. Even if improved sap was baseline, people don't use single target cc anymore - they are looking for aoe slows and roots (frost nova/cone of cold/imp blizzard) to explode mobs within seconds while taking 0 dmg.

Blizzard is about to be as downvoted as EA that one time

---
From their megathread.
---
You're not wrong but if there wasn't layering you would never get anything done. There would be too many people doing the same thing. 
---
Also, layering is essentially dead. The most layers any server has is 2, most have 1. 
---
Where are you seeing "layered" am I missing something?
---
Damn... Not only is this overly presumptuous of "how blizzard does things", it's just straight up wrong.
---
Every major game engine and framework provides a way to structure objects in a game world within a hierarchical context.
---
That means scaling up one object scales up all child objects (which might be one or more models).
---
The best example is when we use Winterfell Firewater or Noggenfogger in WoW - out character, spells, and mount all relatively scale with the character.

There isnt much wpvp goin on right now. Seems like mist people are too busy leveling or farming.
---
Nice try, China
---
I mean sure, if you check you'll notice that I specifically said to use it when you can no longer keep them stunned. Evasion is very useful against warriors though.
---
And I disagree, I'd rather a warrior who can hit me hard once per 5 seconds while I'm at full health over one who has access to all of their abilities *including* that one, which will almost certainly proc given a rogues high dodge chance.
---

---
I agree.  As someone who never really got to play a druid people shit talking them makes me think the community is trash.  Seems like they shit talk everything that's not a mage or a warrior.
---
DM doesn't replace any instances. People will still be running Strat/Scholo/LBRS/UBRS/BRD.
---
I invite you to message me in a month, a year, or whenever to check. I‚Äôm not glad to be unsubbing, in fact I am *really* hoping I don‚Äôt have to. I love WoW:Classic and got several IRL friends to start playing last month.
---
The Chinese government is the root of this problem, yes. As a US citizen, there is a limit to what I can and want to do to aid HK. Get on a plane to Hong Kong? Not quite. End my support of companies that don‚Äôt share my views? Sure, I‚Äôll do that much. League of Legends is owned almost entirely by Tencent, another Chinese company that has made it clear they don‚Äôt stand with HK. I haven‚Äôt been playing much League anyway, but now I‚Äôm certain I won‚Äôt be supporting them any longer. Blizzard has clearly shown they are similar, and I can not stomach the idea of my money going towards that ideal.
---
I‚Äôve been looking into some other IPs owned by Tencent as well as US companies that are bowing to Chinese censorship requests. I‚Äôm only just starting to speak with my money, and I don‚Äôt plan on compromising my morals.

Im using 0 addons so pretty sure its a bug if your experiencing it as well

Blizzard/Activision rushing us through dinner to give us adults dessert. How can you have pudding if you don't eat your meat first?

The Preparation/hemo/cold blooded build can take out anyone even those pesky pallies. It's a super fun build I plan on using a variant of it once the honor system drops
---
Rouges are overpowdered
---
Hong Kong activist bringing politics in a game interesting that in every Blizzard sub there is a post about that even games that has nothing to do with hearthstone. You guys like to push up the news about bad China very fast and effective applying gold status and the people who upvoting it and push comments is very well orchestrated.
---
What dungeon goes for more than an hour other than a full brd run?
---
Try Google lightsaber and it would com as the first Thing.
---
Wait, ‚Äútanking later‚Äù???  Are you not tanking now?
---
The way to make your life easy is run the dungeons for your level (you‚Äôre 29, sfk or sm:graveyard) a bunch.   That way you‚Äôre overlevelled (and have some decent gear) when you go to quest.
---
I‚Äôm a level 24 elf rogue, I don‚Äôt have a profession yet. This is my first time playing WoW so I don‚Äôt really know anything about them, what I‚Äôd actually be doing, etc. I was thinking about engineering to make bombs and PVP items that I could use or sell. Is that a good choice? What would be a good second choice to go along with it? Mining? Leather working? 
---
Is there anything I can do to make my swords do more damage? Like buffs, enchantments, modifications, taking it to someone, etc at level 24? (Something like armor kits but for weapons)
---
I‚Äôm level 24 and have 1 gold, 20 silver, down from 2 gold after buying a new sword. How am I doing money wise?
---
I was holding out hope they wouldn't charge what will end up being  roughly $360 to kill KT. The whole justification of a subscription is to fund new content, which classic obviously won't get.
---
i don't think he means this sunday, but the following sunday after the guild split
---
Ok, thanks a ton for the answer. I‚Äôm pretty enthusiastic regardless of what happens. At the very least I‚Äôm experiencing Vanilla right now, and having a ball.
---
Finally, a like-minded person. Everyone whined about how easy retail was, yet they all downloaded questie because looking for quests is too hard. Reading quests is too hard. Having to think is too hard. I don't get it. The only add ons I have are recount, threatplates, and dejacharacterstats. Nothing that actually changes gameplay.
---
Paladin tanks are fine versus UD and demons...nice even.
---
What I did was the quests in Shimmering Flats then farmed the turtles and basilisks in the flats till 34
---
Clearly
---
My honest opinion is that players in 2019 wants too much in terms of when the content will be out. I am a solo mostly casual player, I complain about what they put out, but I honestly think that we have no point on when. Do blizzard have yo ask us permession to put out content? It seems like we are going on that road
---
I‚Äôm in one of the top guilds currently and I‚Äôm pretty sure we all agree that this is too fast. The only thing that should have been implemented this early should have been the Honor system.. DM is annoying this early because a majority of the loot you got for PreBiS is going to immediately be replaced by gear in DM.
---
Thanks Mindy, very cool!
---
Yeah I tried to play without addons at first. It went relatively well. Then I did my first dungeon as a healer and decided to install healbot. As I was at it, I also got myself Titan Panel, Details and Atlas Loot. I quested to about level 30 where the quest descriptions became horrible and I just had too many quests and decided to install Questie. Also quests where randomly plopping up everywhere, was no fun anymore after I missed my third wanted sign. I also installed Spy somewhere along the way and a better ignore list Addon.
---
At some point i realized just how insanely many skills I got as a Shaman especially with all the totems and installed Bartender 4 to make myself a better interface. At level 50ish I installed Atlas because I had no fckn clue about the Layout of BRD+-
---
When you find out you are on shitty eastcoast servers and never knew there was option to play westciast. Rip, feels bad might quit
---
Right so stuff costs more, but you are making more money. Except vendor item prices are stagnant, so mounts, ammo, food/water, etc become much easier to afford. The one big buy most people are saving for is an epic mount, and an inflated economy makes this save much easier.
---
Fucking cowards. "Every voice matters"

Don't mages already make like 40-50g an hour spamming zf graveyards solo? Plus hunters, priests, druids and warlocks already pulling those same numbers at Mara. I'm interested to see how much of an impact it makes. Obviously lashers generate a lot more, but there's an argument to be made that 40g/hour two weeks ago was more impactful than 80g/hour will be in a month.
---
I would rather wait maybe a month or two more, but I'm pretty sure most people in Classic never spent time at 60 without dire maul being in the game anyway, considering it only dropped a few months after release originally.
---
Intro screen and music are well done but the 'gameplay' is nonsense and has nothing to do with 8bit. It's not just low resolution, that scrolling was not even  doable in 16 bit it looks way too smooth
---
Looks photshopped to me.
---
Got to give them time for threat.  If they didn't have any threat still then I'd check their aggro buff or their talents.
---
UD/demons should be very easy for them to tank.
---
Pallys are top tier healers.
---
Level 19 mage looking for a guild on Mankrik(alliance) I play about 7-11 Est Sunday through Thursday and anytime Friday and Saturday. I‚Äôd be a lot further along if I didn‚Äôt keep changing classes. I‚Äôm sticking to my mage though.
---
NOTHING feels like a DK. Thats why DKs were such a huge hit when they released. 
---
A DK is like having mixed a classic pally and warlock together, so try both and see.
---
So what warrior strategy do you have a hard time with? Any tips I can use as a warrior ha
---
Thanks
---
I actually did it.  I hope everyone else does too.  No game is worth supporting over this.

I use Zygor which you have to pay for but it‚Äôs pretty cheap and the addon part of it is better than most of the others (it can catch up to where you are if you skip quests and stuff). Plus I doubt you‚Äôre supposed to but I share my Zygor account with friends so it‚Äôs cheaper that way. Not sure if it‚Äôs the fastest guide out there but it‚Äôs super easy to use and has some great features.

thanks for doing a little leg work for me, i like my addons,

Disagree. Benidiction has way to many. Can believe every server is not the same though
---
Well then we should make clear to them that with shit like this they risk the entrie western Market. I for one canceled my subscription for now and am done with anything from them.
---
When we went over to undead/Baron side and one spawned, it did the yell, which confused us even more lol
---
Do SM graveyard and library. You can also go out to desolace. But really SM will take you to high 30s
---
Things are only worth what people are willing to pay for them. If the price is truely worth more then the people who are losing cheaply then flippers will by them and the price will move back up. I am not going to post my auction 20 times lowering it by 5% each time. I would rather have 50s in my pocket and ‚Äúmissed out of 50s of possible additional value‚Äù then having to keep relist things.
---
And discombobulator ray
---
i meant bc hunters are dumb
---
So they're rolling tauren?
---
Was there patch notes that said it should be fixed?
---
I'm under the impression that feign death mechanics were wonky af in vanilla and that's why it's not being changed.
---
Its only DM. Its just a 5 man dungeon, its not really a big deal
---
Grab skull of impending doom 60 pct move speed and a trinket from badlands 40pct move speed, youll use em till 60 in pvp
---
Don‚Äôt forget to spend some time in Kali while leveling.
---
Just mages and warriors. There's enough healers where you're never really lacking one.
---
But they must have seen some people leave and felt the need to pump those numbers right back up.
---
That works perfect for dungeons, you can use mind blast but it can‚Äôt be in pull like the priest will want to, mind blast isn‚Äôt very mana efficient so mind flat, wand, and shadow word pain will be the bulk of the damage but mind blast is just a fun nuke. It‚Äôll be fine but it‚Äôs something you have to keep in mind to avoid that exact annoying situation. Gl :)
---
They were...feign death could be resisted in vanilla...
---
Mining is good support for engineering because it will give you materials for your crafting. Also a good thing to sell on the AH. You‚Äôre doing alright, it can really fluctuate based off luck, but it‚Äôs probably a good time to start getting stingy
---
It was supposed to be fixed and still wasn't. It should disengage from combat and drop target and allow pet to disengage as well from combat all in the same two macro pushes. It doesn't disengage pet, for one, and it doesn't always disengage target meaning the total effect isn't replicated.
---
Almost 8 days played myself.  Just dinged 46.  Taking my sweet time.
---
Preach
---
If you want to go engineering while leveling then mining is an absolute necessity. if you take engineering in mining you won't be making very much money from your professions at all. the general wisdom is that while leveling if you want to make money with your professions you should take skinning and either herbalism or mining. 
---
you can temporarily increase the damage of your weapons using sharpens but Stones which are created if you're a blacksmith. If you want to go blacksmithing then it's pretty much necessary that you go mining
---
He said they realised in Armory, where there is only the one boss
---
I say Ewbers and Lewbers
---
I'm a shaman, literally every single raiding guild wants me. No joke, every raid advertisement on my server says something along the lines of "looking for shaman".
---
Theres an option to turn off those invites.
---
Tanks... Just like every other MMO I've ever played
---
You're playing the game wrong. You see you need to spend all your time farming until you get tidal charm.  Rogue pops evasion pop your tidal charm and wait full duration.
---
Block channel invites. Problem solved.
---
City of heroes is great, but its an alt game.
---
The actual game is a joke in difficulty, but you can play through the classes and have fun.
---
Lol, I waved at a hunter as I was going about my travels. He decided to attack me. Thought he had the advantage with range, but a quick bloodrage + intercept ruined his day. I don't understand why people just can't play nice...
---
That's some fascinating stuff.  This is why I came back for Classic -- it's a relatively uncomplicated system that I already figured out in 2005.  I raided a little, but was fairly casual even back then.
---
Thanks for catching me up!
---
Subscription canceled :)
---
Yep. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs sad about it.
---
Here is one for you, if you are looking for a specific target and want to get the quest done before the other 2392 people hunting the same mob you can create a macro
---
/target Fen Creeper
---
or what ever you want to hunt.   
---
I used this to get the Giggler from Desolace for my hunter.
---
I agree i wouldnt complain if they released bgs early
---
YOU ARE THE BEST!
---
I've been clicking various times to make sure to dot the right mob etc. This is a great feature that I didn't know existed either! When I started reading I thought you had just realized you could click tab to target a mob in general and \*poof\* you learn something new that you will use every day! Thanks stranger ;)
---
It does not matter, Play that game at your pace and at the pace of the community thats built around you. (people in your guild and your friends) When BWL come out there are going to be many many people who haven't cleared MC, and you know what? thats fine. because Classic is designed in such a way they even those who are progressing through current raid content, have things that they need and want from older content. just because your running current content does not mean that last patches content becomes irrelevant. so those who are just getting into the end game actually benefit from joining in late. thats the beauty of Actual progressive raid content compaired to the retail version of the game and that gives you this mentality that "new content makes old content not nessesarry"
---
in addition just because DM is coming does not mean your BiS lists change dramatically. we have 1.12 itemization from the get go meaning a lot of the Private server BiS lists aren't accurate. most of the Items from the Dungeons we have now are still going to be Pre BiS. and infact in original vanilla Molten Core wasn't even cleared till quite some time after Dire Mauls release. so this is a non issue. People need to stop and actually look at the game for what it is. You Are Not Behind. your playing the game at your pace and in your own way. that is what classic is about.
---
warning: decent chance whoever you give the account to gets banned for account sharing. be careful
---
Good news! They're getting rid of layering.
---
That has always been the plan. Blizzard has said that they're getting rid of layering, and they're doing that right now. As we speak.
---
Most servers are unlayered now. This is due to people either qutting the game or spreading out around Azeroth to the point that layering is unneeded on those servers right now. 
---
A few servers have two layers. No server has three layers. When phase two hits, all layering goes away. It might go away before then, but it definitely will when phase two happens.
---
If a few servers still *should* have layers in phase two, then those servers will get some larger queues.
---
.d..c hy! hjjjhjijrnxLiuluuluululiulUop7p3jjhh hmm
---
There's only one way to find out ...
---
Level up 15 warriors like that other guy here.
---
I would have gotten away with it to, if it weren‚Äôt for you darn meddling kids.
---
That wasn't what I asked though. Has blizzard said anywhere they're intending to fix it?
---
So with Dire Maul come new stuff for certain classes to AoE farm. But is there anything a paladin can do to also benefit from it? In terms of gold farming I mean... 
---
I'm gonna need a solid 650 gold for my epic mount quest and spending that much on quests or mats would leave me with just over 100 gold.
---
200IQ. Just wait for everyone else to get geared so then you are only one rolling on it
---
Supposedly we're one of the most balanced servers with something like a 52/48 split. I think the layers have kind of done some weird things since I tend to either see mostly Horde or mostly Alliance after a while.
---
Phase 3 needs to be released a month after phase 2 or at least bg's do. PvP servers are EXTREMELY horde dominated and they are going to make our life hell with honor and no bg's. I think dm releasing now is a good sign that maybe they will keep phase 2 but have bg's be released after one month. World pvp is going to be really fun and I can't wait to see it but it will also come with horde camping brd entrance from both doors to the entrances to each instance all day every day and that is the stuff that makes people quit and if the population balance becomes even worse it will effect everyone. Do you want hour long horde bg ques? cause that's how you get hour long horde bg ques.
---
Where do I sign up?
---
How do you come up with 50? Just multiplying all blue drops by their droprates I'm getting around 40 assuming 5 resets (I'm doing about 12 minute runs as shadow priest). Maybe if you have herbalism/mining.
---
I was today years old when I learned it
---
Not sure if i‚Äòm gullible or this is true.
---
It's been quite difficult finding dungeon groups. Will there every be a  dashboard where players can find a dungeon group easily in future i.e. in retail?
---
bro you callin' me gay bro!? you wanna go or what!!? O_O
---
Dustwallow, I also hate it. So thick with crocolisks you could walk across the zone on their backs. Fucking sharks. That huge mountain wall you have to swim around. I consider it an alliance zone with some last.minute horde stuff tacked on. Top it off with my camera constantly getting adjusted by the gd trees. F that place.
---
That's just Vhalken being Vhalken. He's on my server.
---
Best ret paladin in the world I hear.
---
It‚Äôs best in slot for warriors and I think rogues, but it‚Äôs the best hunters are going to see until your group had MC on farm and will have more immediate impact on them.  Either way is fine IMO
---
Darkshore, Ashenvale and Wetlands are all in a good range for you
---
Which they are you talking about? Bethesda and Blizzard? The entire games industry? Just AAA studios?
---
I was having a blast in classic. Subscription Canceled :(
---
Nahh, I'm friends with a lot of good tanks and I always start the group with them and build it up. I usually take off all the work for my tanks and meanwhile the tanks give me the preferred treatment.
---
I‚Äôm a Poohdarin Monk
---
&gt;By the time it was released we were basically playing with the same build of the game with all the associated gear and talent improvements. 
---
uhh what?  BWL was releases in 1.6, which was the same patch they STARTED reworking classes.  It wasn't until 1.12 that all classes had been reworked.
---
So blizzard should ignore their employees expressing a political opinion on the company's broadcast? No matter what it is, any company would reprimand an employee for that.  
---
Use your noodle bud.
---
Tough learning curve but I've been doing it since 57
---
Luna Unit Frames is super buggy atm I wouldnt use it for a while until the dev fixes all the problems and bugs with it.
---
Its not working properly at all.
---
With an Orc wife you are always the little spoon.
---
Wetlands is a good spot to get over that hump, I usually do wetlands and dusk wood simultaneously while running stockades after collecting all the quests, you should come out the other side around 28-29
---
Your gametime remains if you unsub, just don't auto-renew
---
That works well because it's near BFD. Should I just pick up a yellow questline and start there?
---
That gets an upvote. Damn you, China!
---
Carapace Spine Crossbow from Strat is better for hunters. Sounds like the hunter and raid leaders are inexperienced.
---
&gt; It shows the highlights, which are impressive
---
that is literally the point of a pvp video wtf
---
Very low chance to hit a good area, I usually expect a self flare so I just wait it out.
---
Mostly AAA. I generally think that small/indie devs are probably in it for the love
---
[This thread sums it up](https://old.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/9tsn18/people_are_saying_the_deadlock_gang_was_founded/)
---
Nope I played on a TBC server before Classic and it was a fantastic expansions, at no point did I wish I was playing vanilla instead.
---
Fine, if you can have that on your conscience keep playing. I cancelled my sub today and I don't plan on going back.
---
It‚Äôs very possible, I am converting all my gold into materials that will be more value able as the game progresses. BWL will be fun, but AQ and Naxx will be zany for the money potential.
---
nah this is just a NE one.
---
Maybe grinding reps isn't enjoyable for me ? And yes I've made 2 alts both around 30+. 
---
Also yesterday I canceled my sub.
---
Here is what I did and I haven‚Äôt seen one in a three or four weeks.
---
ignore Jessielaniel... taken care of for a day or more. Report the character name and the chanel they are inviting you to join (by name) and the account will get banned. Taken care of. Reporting it to reddit takes more effort and has less effect.
---
Your goal is about 100 times more realistic.
---
You can't remove flying mounts, the zones are designed with them in mind. The game even forbids warlock summons in Netherstorm to prevent players from accessing the flying-only dungeons.
---
They're blocking account deletes now.
---
Goddamn it must be hard to miss an entire point like that. I mean...how?? Wooosh comes to mind lel.

That‚Äôs not a hunter weapon... your guild is dumb
---
Depends. If you have MC on farm and it's easy for hunters to get Rhokdelar (or whatever its called) then give it to warrior/rogue. If you dont have MC on farm and it may be awhile for a hunter to get the bow then give it to the hunters

Anyone gonna point out ‚Äúthen 40%‚Äù? It‚Äôs all I can read. Is driving me nuts.

Yes!!!! He finally got laid.

I cancelled my subscription because I can't support Blizzard after this. I know it's a drop in the ocean but it's more for me than anything.
---
Lol if you really think all of the negative PR they‚Äôve gotten for this means nothing then there‚Äôs little I can do to help you, I don‚Äôt have much experience with teaching people who have special needs.
---
Yeah CoX is not a very hard game unless you crank the difficulty of the missions all the way up or do some task forces but it sure is a fun one.
---
For the horde ? It would be something like this:

:P :P :P
---
Lmao I got yammed on in guild for talking up
---
Seconded!
---
for real? you rolled when a hunter in the raid needed it as an upgrade?
---
Goes to hunter, MS and it‚Äôs immensely more useful for them, only a few stats added to you
---
Played over 1 month, I reached to LV 47. I almost visit every instance which can access by Horde, every zone which can enter without much efforts. Probably they are regarding to recent subscription status, but this game's current status is actually fine, at least very comfortable for me. DM? I can't estimate when I reach to LV 60ish.
---
You should look into 14/32/5. No healing, but it's a stellar PvP and DPS Build, really plays to one of the core strengths of Feral Druids in PvP - Mobility.
---
These were so nice for grinding. Went there after 40 as a warlock, just had dark pact, was at a sweet spot in terms of mob HP vs dot dmg, 40k an hour just killing coyotes mostly.

I'm no defender of the facist regime that calls itself "communist" china, but US citizens really need to open their eyes.  The Reagan / Neoliberal revolution (note the rapid rise in incarceration rate starting in 1980) has destroyed our country.  This is only one measure of its consequences.
---
Depends on your guild. Most mage spots are instantly taken and always full 100% of the time. But depending on big your guild is you'll have multiple 40 man raid groups. 
---
My guild lacks enough 60 warlocks, or warlocks even close to 60, so we search them from pugs.

Why exalted with hydraxian? Sounds like a very weird goal. You'll get it after 20 weeks of clearing MC after hitting revered and there's nothing you can do to speed it up.
---
Hunters will immediately replace it with an item that‚Äôs a 50% drop from another boss in MC. It‚Äôs much better for warriors and rogues.
---
A few servers in the in the server list when you log in have "layered" on them instead of high/full, which makes them worse, apparently.
---
Who cares about blizz releasing classic content.
---
Blizzard needs to answer their PR crisis that they have created by catering to the Chinese government  and suppressing opinions.
---
Every voice matters.

Oh wow the power of money.

How do resistances work? Like is 315 FR a softcap? Does it have Diminishing returns after that or before that?
---
World bosses aren't something you do casually. You need to be part of a raid guild and probably will have had to give them your phone number so they can call you at 3 am to tell you Azuregos or Kazzak is up and to get on before another guild snatches the kill.
---
If you're not 60 by now you're probably not the type of player who's going to see world bosses. Those guys have been in MC and Ony's lair for weeks. For reference, my guild is farming Rag and Ony and we have zero expectations of ever doing a world boss.
---
Also, if PVP camping lowbies was really going to be a big threat, it would already be happening to you. And being 60 won't make things magically better. There's a huge difference between a fresh 60 and a 60 fully decked out in epic BiS gear.
---
At this point you are behind the curve for where you want to be. Luckily for you DM is a catch-up instance, meant to help people pre-raid get better gear faster. This release is actually something you should be happy about, because you benefit a lot more than the raiders who will only be running DM for a few particular rare drops and gold.
---
Uh, yeah, its a stat stick melee dps bow. You're gonna have more leaves than you have hunters in almost any guild.
---
i never said unbind aim‚Äôd shot or dismissing pet, but feel free to make up a new argument and put words in my mouth if that‚Äôs what it takes to find yourself in the right. 
---
 but if your pet is in a position to be body pulling then yeah a smart hunter is gunna dismiss it lmao. if you cant quite tell, the answer is yeah dismiss it just to be safe. its pretty common in dungeons to skip a few packs.
---
I stopped playing my vanilla hunter at 57, then rerolled a blood elf paladin for TBC.
---
It's easily BiS for Feral PvP as well.
---
Ahh I was thinking of library. Where you have the dog boss first.

I have a 23 warrior alt and I get whispered to tank dungeons every time I login

So I got fucked in the ass
---
I saw people in IF today with 100% mounts. Like wtf the game has been out for like a month. It took me like 8 months to get one. I guess some people are just faster than others
---
New player here. If my end goal with my druid is to heal (although I have seen mention successful builds where you can damage, heal, and tank which would also be great to do after)
---
should I be speccing my talents to heal and be starting to practice around level 20 or so in dungeons, or should I wait and use DPS build to level up and then heal later
---
&gt; just like having chinsese made goods doesn't.
---
Well we're just going to have to agree to disagree then.  I think you're 100% a hypocrite.

---
I've been worried about this too, ever since they announced Phase 2 is getting released before the end of 2019.  
---
We had that census data from an addon come out not too long ago that showed the majority of players were around level 30. I can't imagine that majority has moved past the 35-40 range at this point. I've been just a little ahead of that curve myself because I have a lot of time to play but also waste a lot of my time in game with RP.  
---
I'm concerned that announcement of phase 2's release (especially considering that means it'll be around the holidays?) is a bad sign of the release rate to come. I hope they won't just try to keep up with the hardcore streamers so they don't lose that viewership on Twitch. Phase 2 releasing by the end of this year is going to mean a huge chunk of the playerbase will be in that level 48 to fresh, ungeared 60 and they will be farmed mercilessly 24/7. It's not a problem for me personally since I'm on the RP server, but I imagine it'll be more than frustrating enough to drive some people away.  
---
I hope they'll slow it down, both to let the more typical player have time to actually enjoy each phase and to make Classic itself last longer.
---
1.12.1 is a subpatch of 1.12; they are both 1.12. 
---
I understand the semantics you're arguing here, but don't necessarily see the purpose behind arguing it. 
---
They stated the reasoning for maintaining the old mount system was that was how it had worked for the majority of Vanilla: 
---
" The modern riding system was introduced in one of the later 1.12 patches, and as we were discussing it, we felt this system was added to prepare the game for Burning Crusade, which had the ability to ride flying mounts.  
---
For most of the history of WoW Classic, throughout 2004 and 2005, we had the older mount system. It just felt more authentic to that game, to use the older one instead of one that just laid the groundwork for another expansion. "
---

---
As you said, they felt in hindsight it was likely the system had been added in preparation for Burning Crusade (although, it seemed to be more of an inference based on discussion rather than confirmed knowledge of why it was implemented, but that is beside the point).
---
My point was referring to the second line they used:
---
"For most of the history of WoW Classic, throughout 2004 and 2005, we had the older mount system. It just felt more authentic to that game, to use the older one instead of one that just laid the groundwork for another expansion. 
---
That same line of logic can be applied to the cross-server battlegrounds argument, which is what I found ironic. 
---
There was approximately a 30 day difference between 1.12 and 1.12.1; battlegrounds were still server locked for "most of the history of WoW Classic, throughout 2004 and 2005"; which was the only point I was trying to make.
---
I want to be, the very best...
---
For sure not a Hunter Weapon its to fast with 2.5 speed. Even the Blue bow thats pre BiS does more damage because its slow.
---
Its mainly a Rogue or a Warrior weapon, for Hunters just get the Questline Bow.
---
If a Hunter wants this Bow he is literally dumb and for sure not a good Hunter.
---
Or he didnt farm any pre BiS
---
Then I'll have two mwahahaha.
---
How many players will actually stop playing though?  I know theres a lot of vocal people here, but personally I haven‚Äôt touched a blizzard game in like a good decade. I‚Äôm thinking their community of players isn‚Äôt as outraged as these threads would make one believe.
---
You may want to work on basic reading comprehension before calling people idiots, you dumb sack of shit =)

You made the claim that the *single most damaging thing any customer can do* is canceling their sub. That isn‚Äôt true. Sorry you were dropped on your head so much as an infant.

First it's DM, then the guy I replied to is asking for Phase 2. If Reddit set the pace, the last phase would be out by New Year's.
---
I wish I could give you best advice but I mostly play horde. I know that the quests for alliance start in the north near Meastras post and eventually take you down to the main town, you might even want to go to Auberdine in Darkshore to see if there is a breadcrumb quest. You want to start as close to the beginning of the zone as you can so that you don't miss out on any long chains.

Same boat exactly. Played hunter in vanilla and wanted to see "the other side" but never got around to it before cata (and it wouldn't have been the same anyway). Now the quest itself is actually very disappointing compared to the hunter version.
---
Not sure about a new goal, prolly clearing AQ40, but if raiding is going to be as time consuming as it was back in the day then probably not.
---
Aw, how cute. All you have is name calling. Thank you for confirming that I‚Äôm right =)

Its a classic melee dps bow. Castorius is wearing it in World of Roguecraft.

No I didn‚Äôt make that claim, you dumb sack of shit =)

If phase 2 is released in December and they release each phase every 5 month. It'll be more than 2 years until everything is released.

Like. How much more can they chill?

The Point is a hunter does his Raid dps with Aimed Shot and for sure he doesnt want a fast Bow, its literally a downgrade

People still tip regardless of what they paid for the burger. We just don't have a system where someone is forced into tipping or be shunned because a business doesn't want to pay their workers.

I keep kicking around the idea of 1/29/21 or 0/30/21, but I can't get over losing Natural Shapeshifter and OOC, but more Natural Shapeshifter - but my focus is mostly PvP and tanking 5 man's here and there.

If I ever switch to a more PvE focus though I think I'll have to give a */*/21 build a try.

`[@mouseover,help,exists]` is true when your mouseover is a dead friendly target and thus your macro will fail because you can't dispel magic on a dead target.
---
When you have an @ target in your condition, the exists is implicit, for example, these are functionally the same:
---
`[@mouseover,help,nodead,exists]`  
---
`[@mouseover,help,nodead]`
---
This means, the condition in your macro could be summarised as `[@mouseover,help]` notice how no allowance is made for whether the target is alive or not.
---
It was either coincidence or I tricked the Messenger into thinking it was going to be safe ;)
---
I bet the other players were frustrated that you tagged all the mobs.
---
I'd reck you as well.

I Agree !

Level 40-45 is the worst bracket, change my mind.

Strikers Mark isn‚Äôt even good for Hunters, blue crossbows will do way more dps and be better for PVP.

Haha, I never really found endgame stuff fun. You just run the same dungeons to get slightly better gear and for what? To have it all replaced by absurdly OP gear in the next expansion? Yeah, no thanks. I like experiencing new classes and what not.
---
I decided to read all the quests on my troll shaman before classic got released. It was interesting learning the lore about all the different zones. I went from 45 to 100, I think in the 1 month I continued playing him. I might not have breezed through each level at mach 8, but I had fun doing whatever.

You can try anything once without getting addicted really. I know of a few people engage in it once or twice a year. If we lived in a perfect world where people had the ability to decide for themselves I'm sure a lot would choose to try cocaine.

The thing is, one person cancelling (or not buying currency for OW or any other Blizzard games) is the most damaging thing that ONE PERSON can do because the company is no longer getting money from that ONE PERSON.
---
However, if that one person becomes 10 to 100 to 1000 to 10000 to 100000, then it starts becoming a big fucking deal to Blizzard.
---
While this doesn't help HK, if it gets that big, it does let Blizzard know that they can't blindly throw support to China.

I asked for you to support your claims with evidence, a pretty standard and reasonable request when someone makes outrageous claims.
---
You keep insisting that if everyone who was upset about blizzard banning the hearthstone player suddenly canceled their subs then blizz would be hurting due to lost revenue. Yet you can‚Äôt even cite a single point of data that provides any benchmark for what that number of people is. You‚Äôre just pulling that statement out of your ass and assuming that a large portion of blizzard‚Äôs consumers feel the same way you do.

You must do much competetive pvp. 20ms is a huge difference in a pvp match. I just found out I am on east coast servers when I was told sulfuras was west coast. Might have to reroll or quit now. Been tjere, done that, refuse to get fucked over again

No issues with anything you said there but I have to point out the brain-hurtiness that is counting DM as one dungeon when you chose to count strath and BRS as two each.

As a feral druid leveling, will I have trouble getting a group for 5 mans either as a tank (preferably) or a healer? I know druids aren't as viable for tanking in raids, but are they able to find groups quickly for dungeons throughout the leveling phase?

Of course, I plan on speccing 0/30/21 or full resto come raiding.

Great post, I was lead to believe it was Better then the other dungeons. Damn Reddit lying me

Classic is based on Legion that's modified to be vanilla. Notice there's hardly any bugs in the game?

Get a 1hand and a shield.  
---
Have a macro ready where you cast charge than switch to defensive stance.  
---
Sunder is your main ability, as it cause high threat and decrease their armor.   
---
Revenge when available. I advice use it on other mobs, if you already have aggro of your primary target.  
---
Taunt if you have to for emergency aggro a rogue mob, but otherwise I use it once on the mob I'm trying to hold aggro of.  
---
Intimidating Shout if you're hitting multiple target, and keep Battle Shout up always.  
---
Later on you get some more useful abilities.  
---
Shield Block is great against heavy hitters. I didn't need to use it until Maraudon.  
---
You have one that instantly aggros all mobs around you. I use it for emergency reasons.  
---
And a damage mitigation ability on 30min cd. I save this for emergency as well.  
---
The rest comes from experience.  
---
Just realise that don't be expected to hold aggro in Scarlet Monastery runs. Try to, but with all the AOE Spell Cleave, it's near impossible.

As I‚Äôve said in other comments: get out and vote in all elections- local and national. Coordinate with like minded citizens to make sure your elected representatives enact policy that aligns with your political and moral views, and make sure they hold corporations accountable.

---
I tend to think that if people do it'll mostly be the Classic crowd, being older and more mature. Which would probably just re-enforce their "You think you do..." opinion rather than cause them to reflect on this.
---
I disagree that Blizzard is "moving fast".
---
Where are the battlegrounds, in particular? In general, Blizzard should be moving substantially faster than for Vanilla, because for the most part, people will be leveling a lot quicker than before (it took me almost half a year and probably in excess of 40 days played to reach level 60 the first time around. 
---
This time, less than 4 weeks and 10 days played.
---
Of course I spent A LOT of time in Warsong Gulch while I was leveling in Vanilla, which sadly wasn't available this time. I'm glad that Blizzard is releasing DM - they should have released it earlier, to be honest - and they should release the battlegrounds immediately.
---
https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/18695100881  theres a graph linked in the post too.
---
Subscription numbers don't lie. But I'm not here to argue, like I said: it's fine to like whatever you like. I enjoyed parts of every expansion.
---
I don't think anyone should be banned just for having certain political views. No matter what those views are. As long as no one is breaking any rules of the game, their personal lives should not matter. It becomes especially glaring because Hong Kong is such a major human rights issue.
---
DM has SOME gear that's better than MC gear, but not a lot, and what is better is extremely rare like Quel'Serrar (or, rather, the drop that starts the quest chain for it). Most of DM is meant to be gear to help players not yet in MC catch up to a point where they could join an established raid and not be hopelessly behind.
---
As for the ensuing inflation...meh. When I played vanilla DM came out when I was level 30-40. I didn't struggle in the economy, still got my epic mount just fine despite being a warrior and not farming DM.

No, humans, evil. Evil.... what is evil... 
---
I thought they were releasing this dungen because warlocks were complaining they couldn't get there free 100% speed mount till this was released
---
I want my keyring and I want BGs. Doing BGs while leveling up was great..doing it when mostly everyone is 60 already is gonna be...interesting?
---
Yes
---
I haven't had any issues at all tanking as a druid (I am currently 41). No one has complained, and also, I think most people are just glad to have a tank anyway. I doubt anyone will reject you as a feral druid offering to tank. In levelling to 60 there shouldn't be any issues.
---
I just want Phase 2 for BG's
---
No, my point that you completely missed is that if you‚Äôre going to pretend to be an ethical consumer and criticize others for not stepping in line like you, then your self righteous ass better be 100% ethical in 100% of your consumption. You aren‚Äôt.
---
Phase 2 won‚Äôt be until the end of the year probably about 60 days. It‚Äôs not moving too fast most of us have alrdy cleared mc and ony n there‚Äôs not much else to do. You should be able to hit max lvl easily in 1-2 more months
---
The problem with classic isn't a "lack" of content, rather some of it feels pointless. 
---
For example, Tribal LW has a ton of value for BiS pre raid for a ton of classes, whereas Dragonscale LW, although not useless, is kind of just there and doesn't provide many necessities. The fire resistance is nice for shamans / hunters in MC, but it's not necessary or BiS. The recipies and mat farm require a lot of work for very little pay off.
---
Another example: the rare elite giant that roams Burning Steppes offers absolutely nothing fascinating. You'll get more out of it if you kite him to Lakeshire and watch some cheeks clap.
---
There is a ton of underwhelming content in classic, and instead of changing the classic experience as in a "new game plus" sense, they are rushing content that was more fun than what we have now.
---
I've collected the blue dragonscale recipes because it's what I wanted to do, but will the pieces actually add any value to my experience? This is the problem. Rushing content isn't a great solution, but there isn't exactly another one.
---
As a feral druid, when is the right time to use Tiger's Fury?
---
100% just need to farm additional mobs to not hit instance cap.
---
It means nothing just like every other time blizzard, Activision, EA, Ubisoft, or take two fuck up. It‚Äôll blow over after a week or 2. Just watch
---
well depends on what im doing i usualy jsut want to lvl so i dont even bother ganking ppl waste of XP grinding
---
If you plan to level mostly solo, go dps until max level, you can still tank or heal in dungeons most if the way to 60, and questing will be a lot faster.
---
    If you are leveling mostly in a group the being could make things easier overall for your group but it still comes down to preferance.
---

How have I never thought to use my mouse buttons this way. I've been getting 2 actions out of them when I could have like 10! you sir/ma'am have changed my life.
---
I mean same with all raids. We can't reset our brains ü§™
---
It is beyond mind-blowing that a videogame company is bowing down to China. BEYOND.
---
Works fine for me. What issues are you running into?
---
This is what happens when English is the shill's second language... Much wow! Very thanks!
---
Thank you!
---
Yup rend and disarm. Good to know thanks
---
Weird stair glitch. Can other characters see you when this happens ?
---
Cancelled my sub today and put my reason down as their bowing to the Chinese government and that it's reprehensible. It's a pity. I love classic, but compared to the sacrifice other people are making, this is nothing. So that's it. Unless Bliz miraculously changes direction in the next few days I'll really miss my dwarf warrior.
---
I have never encountered this on Whitemane. Idk if it's different on horde side but alliance is usually pretty decent. I've ran hundreds of dungeons so far and have literally never encountered anything that you're describing.

You are joking right lol

Try Spiteflayer when you are a bit higher level - fast all round vulture with dive, bite, claw and screech. 1.2 attack speed and big flappy annoying wings, also will fly over lava etc.
---
Considering that union members going on strike involves more than commenting on Reddit, no, I wouldn‚Äôt. Just like I wouldn‚Äôt tell protestors that they‚Äôre wasting their time.
---
Going on strike involves an actual risk to ones livelihood and also directly and immediately impacts the group causing strikers harm. 
---
It‚Äôs almost as if the 2 examples above involve actual activism.
---
Free Hong Kong
---
So they're trying to impose their moral beliefs onto others? Demanding that the Catholic church or other Christian organizations adopt to homosexual couples is authoritarian, no? You can't demand respect from anyone in society, you can only try to earn it.
---
So your fake-ass argument can take a hike, you are being anti-American if you demand bakers bake you special cakes to celebrate gay weddings or be fined 50k.
---
Not me and not back then but I'll start saying it that way from now on.
---
You are right. LoL mods are a pain in the ass, but that's mostly because they have very narrow and definite interpretations about their own rules. Like, [they do happen to have somewhere where you can talk about HK and China if you want](https://old.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/dex5xh/free_talk_tuesday_october_8th/). The mods even made an [affirmative statement](https://old.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/dex5xh/free_talk_tuesday_october_8th/f30e7gf/) that comments about this situation shouldn't be removed if they also relate to the content where the discussion is happening.
---
Its just an additional dungeon, nothing serious
---
So I can tell that guy's a noob from just his comments. 
---
Rogues can get weapon chains and also their t2 gloves give immunity to disarm.
---
Rend does work but a good rogue will just be kiting you in your deadzone and restealth and cheap shot you before the rend breaks their stealth. You should use shouts to keep them in combat so they can't stealth at all. 
---
You can use the first aid posion cure to remove crippling posion and then intercept them. You can use a shield and distance when you know they will get you in a stun lock. 
---
Rogues should definitely use evasion vs warriors to prevent rage generation and to dodge hamstrings. If you get hamstrung you have to use Sprint to maintain the deadzone. If you see battle stance you just gouge/kidney/blind/vanish to prevent eating the OP.
---
Rogues are really strong right now in PvP specs because people are low gear and health and evis is static.
---
&gt; It's like shooting babies in a fishing net.
---
I can't tell if that's innuendo, or just a recipe for a relaxing afternoon  \^-^
---
lvl 45.. its cancer
---
You guys aren't fooling anyone lol
---
They do it every competitor small or big that isnt some extremely niche game
---
You're the one who chose to comment on this post.  It says clear as day this is the only post like it on the sub. But go ahead and bow out with that cheap cop out.
---
They fucked it with the layering. They need to fix that before releasing any more content. Rag and Ony shouldn't have been up yet.
---
I mean, I understand where you're coming from, I've been playing WoW for 12 years, Warcraft II &amp; III for 20, and Overwatch, StarCraft, Diablo and Hearthstone intermittently; but I've never felt like I needed to give Blizz unnecessary money, be it for cosmetics, pre-orders, or decks. It's okay to love the games and play them, but nobody is holding a gun to your head and forcing you to spend that money. Blizz aren't at fault, they are just a successful company doing what every other company is doing. I'd be more pissed if they charged  separate subscription fees for Classic and Retail.
---
Theres like 5 in the game and you have 25 of then, what kinda sorcery is this!
---
Deez nutz aren't gonna juggle themselves.
---
If someone has a debuff and you hover over him to use a mouseover macro it does not work. If you want to click that player while the debuff is on him you are not targeting the player either like the debuff is blocking the playerframe instead like grid2 where the debuff is pretty much transparent and you can click throu.
---
If you switch a person during a raid or if a person joins the raid later, sometimes the class color gets overwritten and the people pretty much keep the color of the person on that slot before and dont refresh it.
---
Example:
---
Group 1
---
Warrior Brown
---
Warlock Purple
---
Paladin Pink
---
Empty slot
---
and if you know move someone to this group to fill it up or someone joins and happens to end up in position 1
---
Hunter Brown
---
Warrior Purple
---
Warlock Pink
---
Paladin Green
---
This is super confusing.
---
Next problem is if you activate a corner to show who has aggro, it frequently stops resetting meaning if you had aggro for a second you are "flagged" as having aggro for the entire fight and even if the mob dies it doesnt reset until the next pack is pulled.
---
If you use those unit frames solo as well they also showing you pretty much permanent aggro until you reload ui.
---
I am only using the raid unit frames, not the big group or player frames and those are only some examples of problems I run into.
---
I have my version updates a week ago and took it from github directly so I doubt its a wrong version.
---
There are several more issues like with showing pets, I only use RClootcouncil, atlasloot, details, questie and omnicc + titanpanel and gatherer dont know if any of those addons are breaking it.
---
But whatever I do it doesnt seem to work flawlessly.
---
basically never
---
Yeah, you're right! 
---
I'd much prefer a video full of corpse running, sitting to eat and drink, mounting to run around searching for them when they move, etc....

Is cruel barb a unique weapon?
---
I've been leveling my alt as fire and find that most people leave the single target fire mage alone. Of course if they don't, I hide in a bush and deliver a pyroblast to their faces.
---
The ban was inevitable like you say, but getting rid of the commentators was what took this that extra bit further and turned it into horrible PR. It was in no way justifiable and it exposes that their aim was only to appease the murderous government for financial gain. Also, they can be painted as wanting to cover up China's crimes against humanity. They played their hand badly.
---
cancelled mine as well
---
Do you only need to have 9% hit vs raid bosses? Like for 5 and 10 man's can I roll with lower in favor of more DMG?

That's what I've been doing but wasn't sure if it was right, thank you.

Exactly. Right before I read this I was telling my friend about all the mages in our MC run who instantly started frost bolting at the beginning of boss fights. Y‚Äôall ever heard of threat?

&gt; druids aren't as viable for tanking in raids
---
I was tanking both dogs on Golemagg last week no issues. This week was main tank on Sulfuron... (Over 3 warriors). Druids are fine.
---
0/30/21 makes your life so much easier so you can quickly flex between it. Super easy to find groups with too!
---
Link?
---
Here you go, dummy. [The comment I replied to which made the claim](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dez4yc/breaking_blizzard_entertainment_bans_pro/f30ngxc)
---
&gt; Cancelling subs is literally the opposite of just a tweet. **It is literally the most damaging thing a single person could do to a business**
---
I replied with an example citing an action that a person did that was more damaging than canceling their sub.
---
Again, you dumb fucking mongoloid, feel free to show where I actually said ‚Äúsince the average WoW player cancelling their subscription isn't willing to commit a crime punishable by years in prison they aren't doing anything‚Äù
---
Why does every mount leave impressions. Except for my Kodo.
---
0/30/21 is the go-to spec basically. Tank heal or damage all in one.
---
Wait until you are higher level before going to that.
---
I don't think you appreciate how hardcore vanilla's time demands are. You say you have 3-15 hours to play per week total and can raid one night a week. Thing is, a single run of MC can take 4+ hours. There's also a lot of raid content in classic, and at least in vanilla guilds tended to run all of it which required 4+ nights of raiding per week. Guilds also prioritize members who show up most often, not just for loot but for getting to raid in the first place. Many won't be interested in someone who can only play one night a week.
---
And that's not to mention all the time you need to spend farming for gold and consumables for those raids each week.
---
Why wouldn't they support China if that's a massive part of their business, and the country can literally decide to stop allowing their products if a random gov official woke up on the wrong side of the bed one morning?
---
Its for TBC
---
I does completely change the pre-bis lineups though.
---
Paladins can go prot and AOE the lashers.
---
Or just do DM:E jump runs for the thorium nodes and split it with the other person with you.
---
So warlocks should have near 100% drop rate for everything, since we mostly curse things? Maybe melt them from the inside, destroying the intestines, but all outer parts like hooves, horns, ears, eyes should stay intact. I need my class fantasy, damn it. I also needs these spesific drops, damn it.
---
9% is the yellow hit cap against lvl 63 mobs, so against everything in 5 to 10mans you need far less
---
As I‚Äôve addressed in other comments, individuals can do far more than simply cancel their sub. If that‚Äôs as much as you think one person can do then I just pity you for how inept and incapable you think people are.
---
I pretty much ran SM from 30 to 40 tbh
---
For a level 30-40 character? Nope
---
It's class utility. Class utility is for the group. Sorry.
---
So you took a clip of a conversation and posted it to make a point. I'm sure you can get a few streamer haters to upvote this but anyone with half a brain doesn't listen to half a conversation out of context with what may or may not have happened and think anything other than the video is pointless. Unless posting a biased video was the point.
---
Does anyone have any data on the average lv per realm?  I am trying to use the add-on Wow Census but it doesn't appear to be working.  I just like looking at data.
---
He can rage all he wants, if im gonna undercut a price IM GONNA UNDERCUT IT
---
I would personally love for phase 2 to drop right now and then all future phases grind to a halt in progression. Possibly even overtuning current raid content to be difficult so future phases dont need to be dropped early due to the high end players only raid logging.
---
Of the four people I personally know that have hit 60, only one of them currently has a job. Another 60 had a job but lost it because he called in too much to play wow. Need I say more?
---
I've got a full time job, but other than that:  no current SO, very few obligations, spend 4 or more hours a day playing (more like 6-8 on weekends) and yet I'm currently sitting at 55 and I STILL feel like I've been no-lifeing it.
---
I also just spent like 150g on a spelldmg ench app yeah I'm a little pissed since there's better preraid bis in DM
---
30-40 was the fastest part. I want from 30-40 and a 100g for my mount just in SM doing no stop instance.
---
You canceling your sub isn‚Äôt protesting. Thank you for proving my point that slacktivists are self righteous mongoloids who don‚Äôt actually accomplish anything except jerking off to their delusions of activism.

You could have gotten 2-3 levels instead of typing this story out.

Whats really fun is MCing him as a horde priest and then taking him on a nice long walk.

Yeah this games community still seems super toxic after 11 years, sadly. I don't understand how people get so upset over a game.

I see you have never dueled a good druid.
---
god that just SOUNDS painful

I‚Äôm the dumb fuck? You‚Äôre the one saying I said something I didn‚Äôt say. And you just proved I didn‚Äôt say it. Dumb fuck.
---
Thanks man, I think so too.
---
I agree. My guild is 10/10 with Ony down. However there's still a lot of people who haven't.
---
Got a question since these comments are full of people saying they're unsubbing and uninstalled from America/England/Etc to show their support.  
---
Can the American or British branches of Blizzard actually force the Taiwan branch to change anything? It's China - It's got different laws and it doesn't seem like any number of lost subs in foreign countries will cause them to suddenly come out and say they support revolution.  
---
So before I go and join people in deleting the one thing that helps me destress and relieve some of my rather severe depression; can anyone actually confirm it has a chance of affecting the right people?
---
It depends on how geared the warrior is. If one overpower is going to take 2/3 of your health- probably don't pop evasion.
---
"Right wing thought" used to be traditional values, small government, strong national defense, and personal responsibility. These days it's just hating gays, minorities and immigrants.
---
If you want to heal go moon glow natures swiftness.
---
Yes, please link me to the 10,000+ comments made by unique individuals who all claim to have canceled their accounts.

You‚Äôre the one making the bold claim, and stating it‚Äôs obvious. So finding proof should be easy for you.

I believe that is Phase 3. With WSG and AV. AB comes later.
---
There's honestly a lot more enjoyment flying to South shore and then as a party making the trek to SM just for the last final push through a building full of horde into your instance. On the surface if sounds annoying making this ten minute journey and then running a gauntlet where you may be murdered but that's why a lot of us play classic.
---
I dont think you have to worry about telling Blizzard about how many arent even 60 yet. They have all the means to monitor activity on realms, see the spread of levels, activity dropoff once 60 etc. They have much more info than your ‚Äúgut feeling‚Äù.
---
Ah shit.   Now I know why diremaul is coming out next week (and they announced retail content a week after a patch).
---
You're right, WoW actually has stricter chat policies than league.
---
Can confirm, it did not help me win loot tonight, however as the only other plate tank I ended up trading loot back and forth. Maybe there's more to the yelling?
---
Undead build their own mounts and they‚Äôre more environmentally conscious.
---
So what kind of a setup do you guys have?
---
Yeahh? Try to tell it to my paladin. 56 prot/holy vs 60 rogue or warrior? Hold my beer...
---
No. Blizzard easily could have ignored the winner. 
---
My they was a singular they.
---
The casters did nothing one way or another. What opinion are they expressing?
---
You use a lot of words ro convey very little then act all snarky.
---
But this let's them be outraged and use blizzard as a whipping boy all while buying china made products on a daily basis and supporting other companies who do or would do the exact same thing.  
---
One dude said "oh well back to league" lol fucking imagine....
---
Not in a mmorpg. Not like u can 1 shot someone in the head. You're being dramatic. This is not a shooter, it's tab targeting...
---
I wish they had kept MORE layers in for longer, but people had a massive whinge about it.
---
FYI, servers either have two layers or no layers these days. The goal is for all servers to eventually have no layers.
---
I'm on a server with two layers still, and at peak times I just run dungeons because questing is impossible. It would be TWICE as bad otherwise. Seriously, quests to kill 10 mobs can take hours because there are too many fucking people. 
---
So yes, there are two layers on a majority of servers, and you should be thankful for it.
---
For bringing up a good point?
---
I think it's going going well for me. I'm only 42, but 40-42 was pretty fast. Same for 30-40. I can really recommend to only do the green low level quests. Yes, you habe to travel a bit, but quests are finished easily and going from one place to another just takes like 15 minutes most. I even have the feeling to miss some quests because of getting a level up and quests getting gray.

That was very much amazing to see. I am all for that type of engagement. I actually had a similar conversation with a guy who undercut me recently. I told him that it would be better if he didn't mind to relist the sword for 45g instead of 15 and that I would not undercut him. It worked, he sold it f or 45g and I got to put mine up for 45g right after and IT sold. That's a win win rather than us undercutting each other to the bottom. He was happy, and I was too.

nah, makes them hard to sell later...

DM: West (fall)
---
You have no evidence, you dumb fuck =) 
---
It‚Äôs not job to sift through thousands of comments to find a tally of unique individuals claiming they canceled their subs. That burden of proof is on you because you made the claim that easily 10,000+ people canceled their subs.
---
If it‚Äôs so easy to demonstrate your claim, why do you refuse to do so? 
---
You couldn‚Äôt possibly have made a bunch of assumptions and pulled that number out of your ass like the dimwit you are, could you?
---
Hey, I was 14, what can I say. What did I know :-)
---
Well this is the classic wow sub not the china/blizzard hate sub so.....
---
Back in the day I got about 80-90g an hour in DM.
---
 I know a lot of gold farming methods advertise numbers all the time that sound great, but in reality they fall short by many orders of magnitude. DM is no exaggeration. To give you an idea how much money that is... you can easily monopolize markets with that kind of income. I know from personal experience that it fucked the economy up on my very large server in vanilla(illidan) and it never got better. Non Hunters (and mages to an extent) basically had to struggle to do anything gold making wise.
---
What weapons are those?
---
I've had a similar issue, it usually totally breaks combat, but if an enemy had an attack in...motion? (Queued attack explains it well) then it fails. The cloak doesn't force cancel attacks so they can still go through even though they probably shouldn't. Not sure if it's actually a bug though cus it seems to have always worked that way.
---
I won't say the bug about FD is the same cus I don't think it is, they're both combat breaks that have different mechanics. I'd recommend field testing it a bit more, maybe try distancing yourself from mobs and LoS at times before using it. I don't think it's especially effective in melee, it CAN work but if as you see, not always.
---
The cloak is more akin to Vanish than Feign Death. Any rogues have similar issues with vanish not canceling attacks?
---
Just because people didnt show support of some people that are living in an impoverished country, doesnt mean they're hippocrates for supporting others. 
---
The world is a messed up place, and you shouldn't shame others for doing the right thing now just because they may not have before. Theres tons of terrible stuff that goes on in the world every day, but you can't expect everyone to spend all of their time trying to fix it.
---
Don't be afraid of it. They do a good job of teaching you your class, and there's always something else fun to do. Don't worry about being "gud" - just focus on enjoyment. 
---
At any rate, being good won't even matter until you've literally spent ten days in game. So don't be intimidated.
---
Check AH for better wand cheaper than the vendors level 41 bone one.  I found a slightly better damage shadow wand with +6 spirit on it.  It was 50s less too.
---
Nah, that must have been a mod who deleted it. I can happily copy and paste the full text of the comment if you‚Äôd like. Plenty of sites back up Reddit comments in almost real time.

Your ‚Äúgank‚Äù is bullshit, and so is your post. You show up in the questing zone for 20-25 levels being 30 leve

I got bored and mind controlled him to thrall. Harder than it sounds, because between recasting MC people like to kill him. It took a few tries, but with the help of a 2nd priest, we got him to thrall, where he was promptly killed by a random warrior turning in a quest.
---
Amazing work man. I really enjoyed this
---
Yeah I feel that. The worst for me was my mid 30s as a warrior. I didn't get my WW Axe at level 30 like I did back in real vanilla so I was stuck using Crescent Staff until level 36. It was glorious though when I got WW axe and Whirlwind both the same level. Oh my gosh it was so good
---
I pronounce it as oobres and elbris

You must have a death wish to take a battle stance like that.  But I have to say, way to to take charge and intercept this issue head on.  I just hope no rogue tries to take revenge and execute you.

But we can't see it in the picture so we're relying entirely on your truthfulness.
---
I basically disagree with the post you're replying to in tone and content. However:
---
I have to say this concept that a few hours per night makes someone a casual. It's not a no-lifer whose going at it 14 h/day. It's just that...look, of someone was spending a few hours a night in the gym, would you call them a casual gym-goer? I imagine not.
---
I think the concept that a few hours a night is casual is crazy. I know you probably aren't the genesis of that idea, so I'm not attacking you. It's just crazy to me.
---
Fuck that, drop those rules entirely! Think of all the Classic themed China memes we're missing out on! Also, is a government killing it's own people on mass really just "politics" to you?

If it looks like an interesting and entertaining way to spend time, it is just pathetic. If you had wanted to have some interesting PVP experience where there is a chance to oppose you, you would have chosen at least something like 3-5 levels lower, but definitely not 30.

That holy/ret build is fine for PvP and healing dungeons/raids. Especially as you fill in gear gaps and get more +spell crit while healing.
---
That's what I love about some of this vanilla gear. The devilsaur legs in particular let you show off your amazing cheeks. On an orc or dwarf, it is just a delight.
---
Not gonna lie, it was pretty obnoxious to read it =\
---
There‚Äôs a huge tank shortage on most servers. I‚Äôll get dozens of whispers whenever I‚Äôm on my Druid, Warriors get even more since most people still see Druids as the second option. It‚Äôs a tough job in classic/TBC, you need to be on the ball the whole time and be mindful of your entire party. You‚Äôre expected to lead the group and if you‚Äôre not doing it fast enough you‚Äôre almost guaranteed to get shit from someone in the group. 
---
I‚Äôve always loved doing it and did it from vanilla to wrath but it can be a stressful job when you‚Äôre working with PUGs, I generally can‚Äôt handle more than a few runs a day before I get tired from it. Makes finding those good groups even more special though since I can run with them all day.
---
Your offhand dps gets cut in half, so your 10dps weapon becomes a 5dps weapon and cruel barb becomes a 7.5dps weapon. Sure it's better and has better stats, but you might have to spend more than 4 to 5 hours getting one.
---
This thread spawned from someone saying who cares if content is ahead when they hit 60. They also mentioned that Dire Mail is current. It doesn't make any other content obsolete.

Congrats my friend! Although you got the wrong color ;)
---
I'm all about the original green one. Mainly because I have the most memories of it from back when no other epic mount had a unique look.
---
&gt;You‚Äôre the only tank I‚Äôve ever had an issue with so this is your problem.
---
I've heard this so many times.
---
Why would you make the dedicated playerbase wait for you slow ass plebs? Like seriously, your viewpoint is so scuffed. It's not everyone else's fault that you can't keep up.
---
Must be US issue. Never once have i encountered tank tips on eu realms in any expansion ever.
---
Or it‚Äôs a Reddit issue. Somehow people on here manage to have issues I just never see.
---
I already have your mom to level 48.
---
It's now fixed - at least for me
---
Have you not read the comments on every other video game departure post? Why did you feel the need to announce this?
---
Any luck with this quest yet?
---
Last time I tried was last Thursday, a day after EU reset and it still did not work.
---
I normally don't post about art, but this piece is amazing. I don't know what you'd call that style, but I love it. Has a Diabloish vibe to it too. Undead Warriors are pretty badass, just a shame about the small shoulder pads.
---
I really don‚Äôt know what happened in Hong Kong and if I‚Äôm honest I don‚Äôt care. I enjoy the game
---
No it is not ok, when we played wow as noobs in 2005 we all got locked up and barely saw the light of day till 2008
---
I wasn't disputing that, my first words were "you made the right call", I also said that the people who were looking forward to raiding with them can apply to their guild later.
---
As I was typing that comment the thought of the lvl 30/40 guild master looking to take over the already functioning raid team started to bother me so I commented on it. He should have no problem setting up a team on his own later, and the already very well established team can move on.

Sulfuras (flexible) Horde 52 War. Tank or DPS. Open to rerolling class or server. Looking for a casual group to run dungeons and level with and hopefully raid and pvp with in a month or two. Available M,W,F,Sa evenings and weekends during the day.

To "keep the game about the game" is ok, if you can live with that, fine. I won't be able to. Knowing that Blizzard has picked a side, the side that frightens their citizens. Here is a 10 year old child that is arrested by the HKPD, just look at the sheer terror in her eyes:

Seriously man, this is just a game. Morality should be more important.

Although hes basically said he will ignore the HK thing if he gets a good deal, sadly the America first thing has consequences.

Starting a BRD-run at 9 pm. Bad idea.
---
My paladin's hearth was set to Crusaders' Pinnacle for years. The innkeeper was removed in a Wrath patch, I guess to avoid confusing people since the whole area was part of a phased quest. The spot I was at wound up being under the floor at some point but it was still conveniently close to Dalaran while not being directly in the big city if I wanted to hit something local.
---
I am an American. My country illegally invaded Iraq in 2003 based on lies and caused hundreds of thousands to be killed. My country is currently assisting Saudi Arabia to slaughter the Yemeni people. My country is guilty of much, much more.

The purpose of layers is to prevent overcrowding.   Ever stood around 10 minutes waiting for a spawn only to have someone walk past and tag it right under your nose?  If there were 3 times as many people around that problem would become 3 times worse.
---
The alternative is full servers with queue times.   Say they put 3 layers on a server, it can have 3 times as many people using it as back in the good old days, without being 3 times more crowded.  
---
Once the server population declines, it is no longer necessary to have so many layers, and they remove them.   Blizzard intend to remove all layers from all servers before phase 3.
---
While you may not be able to see players who are not in your layer, you can still group with them, chat with them, buy and sell to them on the same AH, and as soon as you group with them you are placed into the same layer.
---
It really isn't a problem at all, rather it is an effective solution to a problem that plagued the early days, which was horrendous queue times.
---
What tank only has 4500 health fully buffed? Most tanks are running around at 5k+ with Fort on.
---
The biggest difference between Skarm in his videos and the people failing at it now ISNT just gear, because gear and content get more difficult at a rather linear rate for the tank. It‚Äôs that Skarm goes into fights with all the consumables needed.
---
I liked achievements
---
I had good luck with the raptors in Dustwallow Marsh. Good for skinning and they drop grey vendor trash that sells for about 20-30s a stack. Not much competition (at least on my server) either
---
There are plenty of totally new players lvling atm:)
---
The commentators knew exactly what was going to happen, yet allowed it anyways.
---
"I would say at least 1k people".
---
These facts r 2 good.
---
i spent 10 days to hit 60 on a druid... Pretty sure half the time was spent waiting for questmobs to spawn or fighting over tagging.
---
I would be pissed if I died from someone melting my intestines.
---
You'll be fine.
---
There is an option under the Frames tab that you need to disable. Cant remember the name right now... Hmm
---
On episode 3 now, these are super cool man, keep it up.
---
Hahaha, you act as if you know what's factually best in an argument of what people enjoyed the most in an online game and youre being derogatory and belittling when someone doesn't reciprocate, I think that I can see why you weren't having too much fun in WoW mate, hope you get better soon though!, Best of luck!
---
They probably are saying that because not all servers have layers anymore.  They remove them as soon as they can.
---
Why you play game instead study 18 hour get good grade? Rule 1 delete this leave China alone nosey people go study
---
its not even better than strat or lbrs xbow lol
---
Very well put.
---
how are you guys acquiring money as a holy priest? i want my epic mount at 60
---
Wasn‚Äôt it also the classic community that was saying that since there‚Äôs so much to do in vanilla and how it‚Äôs so replayable that there‚Äôs no fear of being left behind?
---
It's one fun gimmick available to one class on a 3 minute cd. If you think that's equatable to real pvp fights i don't know what to tell you.
---
We are recruiting 1 or 2 balance druids to please the fuckin mages and warlocks. They have a really loud voice!
---
Its not worth it because of the OH penalty. You‚Äôll get poisons soon and you want a very fast OH so you‚Äôll get more poison procs.
---
More than 1, which is all he needs.
---
&gt; Totally agree. Dire Maul release scares me simply because i‚Äôm playing an unhealthy (for me) amount just to try and keep up. 
---
So take a break ? You don't have to no life it to keep up, you've litteraly 6 month till BWL opens up.
---
Lmfao are you being serious right now?
---
If you ever end up playing on Earthfury Horde hmu:)
---
effing this.
---
Yeah, this is not at all what 'people' or 'most players' want. What you're talking about is what a very small percentage of the playerbase - honestly probably less than 1% - is setting out to achieve. I don't think that groups requirements should be applied when discussing a rogues endgame/grouping potential in general.

Most classes have boring af rotations so that's not unique to druids. Same with class sets.

Progression argument doesn't really hold weight right now with raids being so easy.

They may not be the strongest healers but they aren't shit.

---
Good to know! I was planning on going 0/30/21 for both 5 man and raid. Do you find yourself able to fill the healer role adequately in that spec?
---
Report to the Game Master. It is borderline gambling and that is a no go with Blizzard.
---
just say tips appreciated. some people give you 20s some people give 50s some give nothing it‚Äôs just a gamble and just don‚Äôt care about it and open lockboxes for people when you‚Äôre afk
---
Level 28 here... 2 hours maximum per day... (forget weekends)
---
Report it. Gambling is against the rules.
---
It's just boggling. 
---
As a DPS, I do precisely what the tank asks as they are the engine of the party. The only time I peel away is to cover the healer if they pull aggro. If the other DPS get into trouble...stiff shit. Learn to maanage your threat better.
---
Can‚Äôt handle pvp around your own level so you decided to gank low levels and still lost. Good story though
---
I am a very experienced player and I am still not 60. I have 7 days played and I'm level 55...that's a lot of hours! For someone working a full time job you'd have to be extremely dedicated and diligent in order to be 60 right now. 
---
Where am I going with this... I too was completely surprised when I heard dire maul would be coming out. This dungeon has incredible items and it is only going to segregate the playerbase further. What was the purpose of this? Is there a lack of content? (No). Maybe there is a lack of content for 1% of the population who is already wearing pre bis gear. I can't see the rationale behind this.

The devs who make the games you‚Äôve enjoyed have nothing to do with this though.

Similarly I can guarantee every company buy and use things from this week including the phone/computer you are using right now would do the exact same thing as Blizzard here but you will still spend money with them all the same.

To be honest, I have never believed in "luck" in RL. But when it comes to video games of any kind I have the absolute worst "luck" out of anyone I have ever met. In wow I cannot find guilds that are super  cool and look after each other. Whenever I /roll I roll super low normally.

That's not at all even in the slightest what I said. No one is talking about Canada, I'm talking about 2 locations side by side, same food, one with tips and one without. Fast food vs restaurant food and USA vs Canada are all irrelevant to my point.

58 to 59 I Tanked LBRS, Healed in MC, and then DPSed in Scholamance lol

I've seen it in-game on classic.  I don't remember that being a think in vanilla.

I talked to a tank who proudly claimed that he would drop groups that were going too slow, or if somebody else wanted to hire him for tanking a dungeon.
---
Faerlina isnt an RP server
---
That last sentence is oddly specific.
---
Companies only care if it doesn't affect their bottom line.
---
Shamans help out in every role - you can offtank something, you can offheal when it's needed, you can do damage.
---
And you do these at the same time.
---
Ask the tank to mark what they want you to offtank with a star.
---
Keep an eye on the healer's mana - if it's getting low, stop spending mana on damage, pop a pot and get ready to save the tank.
---
And keep killing skull.

Thats vanilla only

Don't try to play a tank or healing class and you'll be fine. You'll find that people are not tolerant of these classes being totally new players (its a shame, but its true).

870 upvotes? What the actual fuck?

People asking this going on 15 years now right?

Dont you miss out on the anger management talents for switching stances? So stance dancing is not used at all?
---
Was DM a big deal when it released back in the day ?
---
If I remember correctly, stats on gear were not the same until a later patch. ( What Nostalrius tried to do on their server btw ) So i wonder if the impact on progression of the old DM can be compared with the DM of classic ( a lot of items are BiS pre-raid, was it true for the old DM before stats change ? )
---
WoW was released 11th of Feb, 2005 in the EU. Making it ~10.5 weeks after NA/AUS and 3.5 weeks before DM
---
I had a great conversation with plant tonight on the whole matter. Was really blown away. Really solid and grounded person and very genuine. Hopefully I‚Äôll run with them more in the future.
---
STOP MAKING ME NOTICE THESE THINGS I CANT UNSEE THEM NOW :(
---
ÊòØ
---
Lots of options!
---
Duskwood - pick up breadcrumb quests in town, then head to the west side and knock these out - you‚Äôre the right level for them. 
---
Ashenvale - Zoram strand quests, plus if you did the Althalaxx chain you can continue this too.
---
Stonetalon - quests from Ashenvale plus a couple in here for you
---
Wetlands - early quests like Gobbler, croc skins, green warden/tramping paws are all good at your level. 
---
Once those are done, you can go back to Redridge around 24 and knock out the higher level quests there too üëç

There is an addon called swatter which is supposed to suppress such error messages.   Also consider shadowed unit frames, seemed less buggy and more configurable to me.

Well, if you can split that and enjoy the game without thinking of the morality of the publisher behind it, good for you. I don't intend to push my views on you, I was just genuinely interested if you could split that morality from the game and it seems like you can. I can't.
---
Sucks to hear about your wound, everything all healed up now? Have fun with this game, I really hoped I could do the same.
---
*AQ
---
Depends if you'd go oom in disc. Basically you SW:P, bubble and kite princess so it'd take longer without shadow damage. As for goblin, I don't think it'd matter. You can just SW:P, bubble and wand/heal yourself if low.
---
‚ÄúA surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.‚Äù
---
Good shit. What‚Äôs the addon that shows nearly players? That seems broken.  Can you target them by clicking it also? Game changer if so!
---
Anything that allows you to track two different things at the same time breaks ToS. Do not do it. Your only option. Is gathermate

it depends if you are capable of finishing said dungeon quest, some are really easy but others require good groups (some of the BRD ones for example)

Thank you blizzard for caring warlocks, and adding the dungeon with warlock mount quest so soon.

---
Man such a shame a company whose IP I love is such a dictator ass kissing piece of shit.
---
And how easy classic is, partly due to the 1.12 patch, partly to improved skill. 2h tanking was a sure way to die before because healers mostly had int/mp5 gear meaning their HPS were too low to deal with the DTS. 
---
This is no longer an issue thus MP5 is kinda bad compared to maximum HPS combined with max DPS. You can max mitigation as a tank but it mostly implies that your healer lack the proper output/mana efficiency. I've seen so many healers overheal like 50-60k in a dungeon while a good one will have like 5-10k in the same run.
---
If you have enough rep at darna? Do you have to pay for the mount or do you get it for free?
---
This is how you fucking mod. Good work. Truly appreciate it.

Exactly.   This case is much more public but this kind of thing happens all the time.  Money talks!

---
So you made a wow reddit post to tell us that you got drunk?
---
I found a bfd group by whispering people who were around the right level. You can type "/who 20-28" or whatever level range you want to find people, and then just ask politely "hey, I'm getting a bfd group together would you like to join?". Also ask on ashenvale general chat, the whispering thing goes much better if you already have another guy or two.
---
i didn't cancel my sub

There must be a chanel that has winnie the pooh emote we can spam
---
Aahahahaha so no, you don't do competetive pvp. Why do you think na amd EU have sepparated tourneys and if they are against eachother it's in the same room for equal playing field? The difference between 30ms and somone with 110ms is so huge that if they are both equally geared and skilled the player with 30ms will win 100% of the time.
---
I'm not threatened, just curious as to why people think this is such a sacrifice and what good it will actually do.
---
For the record I'm not currently subbed to wow, so....
---
its not challenging, its boring and annoying
---
Thanks for the effort.
---
Unfortunately, nothing of this matters any more, as this game, which is developed by a shit company, that now officially supports the arselicking, genocidal, mass murdering chinese government, is no longer on my list of things I would even touch with a long stick.
---
Blizzard can go smd, but I know they won't, because they enjoy Chairmans Jinpings semen too much.
---
I don't know exactly but I assume the same complaint as everyone else, seems like they're rushing classic along
---
Is this post just a screenshot of some comments from another post in this sub?
---
They increased the drop rate in the bc to 1% so your math works out.
---
The scary part is, for someone out there, this is a true story :(
---
Thanks , went to felwood last night spent my time pvping with no drops lol
---
If you join myzrael I'd be happy to. Going to start a few alts on there

üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

Why does new content matter? In the original vanilla they did not wait for everyone to be up to date and geared before dropping new content. It's the same now. You have to accept if you work that schedule and can only play a limited amount of hours you are not going to see all the content in vanilla. Only like 30 guilds cleared Naxx back in the day, there's videos explaining their guilds requirements for naxx and outlining how much farming and time you need to spend. WoW classic has easier encounters but things are time sinks.
---
In original vanilla all the easier and more casual stuff was still being run, when dm was out people still ran strath/scholo/brd etc. People are acting like those areas will be ghost towns now. That's not reality, this isn't retail.
---
Entitled is an overused word that makes the user look arrogant, as if they have a right to judge people for stuff they themselves do and hope no one else notices. She got mad and by simply listening to what she is saying there is clearly more to this conversation which may explain why she is pissed, and she appears to be speaking to someone in the room who is also playing. Does she get first dibs cause her gear sucks, no. Does she have a right to bitch, yes, even if she is wrong as it should be our right to bitch and moan sometimes. 
---
It was whoever uploaded the clip that has such a sad little life they decided to take a shot at her for literally no good reason and get upset that she was upset. And I stand by calling that person out for sharing like a minute of what she said instead of the whole thing, if she did something wrong it wasn't in this clip.

Tbh lvl 50 to 60 were relatively fast for me. But I don‚Äôt really know why.
---
I think 50 to 60 took me like 2.5 in game days which isn‚Äôt really that much considering I already had 9 days by lvl 50.
---
I did Felwood, the last Tanaris quests, Un‚ÄòGoro, then a few dungeons, Burning Steppes, a few western plagueland quests, then dungeons again, Winterspring quests, then grinded half a lvl in Winterspring for the Icy Chill recipe (and got it). Then I did the rest in Eastern Plaguelands and Silithus :)
---
I also canceled my en my gf's sub. This is way too much.
---
Mods you ever gonna ban this dude?  He's literally just spamming posts like this.

Yeah it is ;D we were waiting for this guy for over 10 minutes
---
The elite quests in hinterlands have some REALLY worthwhile rewards that you should get, there is something good for everyone.  The quests are not easy, you should get a group.   For example there is a quest to kill 20 of a particular type of elite mob.   Not to bad if you have someone to help kill em right? 
---
Well theres another that has you kill 20 of 4 additional types of elites, for a total of 100 for 2 quests.   There are more quests.  You will kill far more than 100 elites and you are likely to be damn sick of that stupid temple by the time you do.    
---
Good loots and XP tho
---
Sw: p and kite. You can shield when she gets close, then she farts and you have full range again. Obviously easier as shadow.

She streamed this live. She chose for people to see this. To say that she did nothing wrong is hilarious. Also entitled is the proper word to use for this.

r/wowservers for sure, there's other places as well but that's a very good starting point.

---
I don't have much experience in wow, however I'm level 60 and I agree, there is already too much stuff for me to do to get bis items. There are like 4 lvl 60 dungeons, without even counting raids. 4 dungeons, so 4 areas to understand, 4 areas to check loots from, 4 sets of boss encounters, 4 sets of quests. That's a lot.
---
People leaving the game seems to be a concern for developers of MMORPGS. But if hardcore players truly have nothing to do, why don't they try other classes? I think they can learn from other classes and it would make them even better in pvp. But this concern of hardcore players leaving the game is totally contrasting with the game industry focusing on casual players, which is a bit confusing, but maybe that's what they want for wow classic.
---
What I want is, let me try to get full bis without releasing new content too fast. You know for a player without much knowledge of wow, THERE IS A LOT TO PROCESS in this games. If you add content too fast, people will get overwhelmed.
---
One thing about ultra hardcore players, do they actually LIKE to play that much? I personally think that they feel pressured to play that much because they want to be first. But if you slow down content, they will have to slow down too, then it will be more relaxing for them too.

Hydra has a video of him doing it as disc on youtube. Obvioisly slower than shadow, since your main damage will be through sw pain.

Yea

Im at 45 and having a hard time doing every quest available to me. And only been running dungeons for quests and once im done I dont touch the dungeon anymore (besides the one time I ran rfd twice for a shot at the robe in an all melee grp and got it). I just finished badlands/swamp of sorrows and still have all the 42+ quests in stv to do. Then theres hinterlands/ferales/gadgetzan to do after that. Horde btw been doing quests the whole time. I think theyre fun and since its my first time ever playing WoW its teaching me the land and pvp well, but dungeons im still trying to get the hang of even tho it seems like healing them is generally easy.
---
Yea, rogues can get weapon chains, but since there isn‚Äôt any reason for pure PvP specs due to lack of honor points and no BG‚Äôs, as a rogue I personally would not have a weapon chain at the moment.
---
Stats because you kill things faster, can take most likely take more damage (magical and physical) because of stam, and more threat if you're a tank. Armor is good but not that impactful in small amounts. E.g. Wearing a shield may increase your total armour by 25% and add 10% physical reduction but swapping plate for leather gloves may only be like 2% max
---
Like Dire Maul can make it even easier then it already is
---
Druid. Equipped trinket are bis for druid tanks
---
I hate myself for not knowing this. Even knowing it was added in Legion.

I'm not sure how that's relevant. If there's no forced social construct to do tips like they do in America, your analogy wouldn't exist.
---
Seriously... I'm not even 40 either.  At the rate I'm going, I'll probably hit 60 when Karazhan is released... skipping all of wow classic has to offer
---
travel form is still 20% slower than a mount, I feel it, being a 43 druid with 50g
---
Unless you are sick of it, keep playing your hunter.   A good hunter is great!  Become one of those.  
---
A bad hunter however.... well.    We have enough of those already.
---
&gt;They will just be like "Wow, the stuff in this game is super expense" and it will hurt their enjoyment. 
---
It filters down. 60s with lots of gold are more likely to buy mats, including low level mats driving up the price you can sell them for. Now you can sell a stack of copper bars for a gold instead of 10s. Your buying power on the AH at low levels is effectively the same, but things that stay at a fixed price like mount or training are effectively cheaper.
---
I started in 1.3 and DM was released when I was still at fairly low level. Things didn't seem "overly expensive". Quite the opposite. I as able to get 18 gold while still running around Loch modan and training costs weren't an issue.
---
you can tank 5 mans, everybody loves a bear tank in a 5 man
---
I just deleted my character and account after hearing the news. It sickens me to no end that the company I once loved  would resort to acts like these. I really enjoyed the classic experience, but there is no way that I can support behaviour like this. 
---
So long Blizzard.
---
I think u/Lam0rak was the mage :p
---
you could delete the addon from your interfaces directory and re-install.   That should do the trick
---
that is what is optimal use for it,  but seeing as people are clearing MC in greens this could very well be much better than what the hunter who got it, had, shit or not for hunters,
---
Cool dude. Maybe instead of announcing it to reddit like you expect a pat on the back, you should just fuck off.
---
If you‚Äôve got a large number (more than 4) of hunters, Blastershot Launcher is arguably ok to take for hunters but they should really use Carapace spine bow until they get Rhok. 
---
Taking Strikers Mark as a guild hunter is a dick move to your rogues and warriors given you can farm Carapace. 
---
Bad luck - your guild management fucked up.
---
I think it‚Äôs fair to say that a lot of people don‚Äôt want to do all that mats, profs grinding, and could be now tired of brd, ubrs, strat, scholo, etc
---
Only works if you have a high enough tank+dps. Just tried it tonight where the highest level was our healer, and our dps were a bit lower leveled.

Could only get him to about 30%

you need to write a macro that includes /petattack.  That will do whatever the macro says as well as simultaneously sending your pet in to attack.  Example below from healslfg is legit, you could make it simpler if you wanted or more complex. 
---
I use hunters mark + petattack on a macro.  If I use shift then it becomes hunters mark with no pet attack.  On top of that I include /petattack on my rotation macro so it's on the same target as me by default.

Yeah I think I'd much prefer to get to phase two with a level 60 rather than being ganked every 0.4 seconds while levelling. I don't mind world PvP but without battlegrounds it's going to be rampant. And I've just hit the level range where I'd still be worth honour to level 60 players who might leave me alone because they just want to  get their quests done.
---
Both...
---
Shame.
---
Just fyi: That is what classic was. Casuals were still doing MC and maybe BWL at the end of vanilla back then. Hardcore players had way better gear and were far, far ahead.
---
I see, thanks! So that applies to weapons as well? Like Bonebiter vs Gatorbite Axe which is better?
---
I see what you did there! üòè
---
Cancelled. All aboard the canceled sub train. CHOO CHOO
---
If Blizzard makes any announcements for TBC/Wrath servers at Blizzcon, I feel it would start putting the thought of "why waste time in Classic when I can wait until the TBC/Wrath servers" in everyone's minds.
---
I'm not mad, simply pointing out what you claim is unable to be pointed out. You need to learn how to evaluate rebuttal.
---
and eye of the beast the maraudon one
---
It amazes me how people suspend their account because they want to (protest?) against blizzard somehow or against the Chinese government. Implying you have done anything before for the chinese people. After this HS player thing, people suddenly cared!
---
Mine is a little less impressive. I goto 58 in vanilla, i wanna ding 60 and do a vanilla AV
---
I've cancelled my sub, and I'm absolutely heartbroken. I played on private servers, then waited for years after they announced classic wow at blizzcon.
---
Why'd it have to be blizzard that released classic wow, of all companies, and then why'd they have to pull this bullshit? I just wanted to play their goddamned video game without supporting the CCP.
---
Absolutely furious. I hope they add microtransactions or turn classic into a mobile game or something so I don't ever have any desire to go back.
---
No one gives a fuck.
---
damages blizz's image? they support a regime with concentration camps, murders protesters, and disappears people for disagreeing with government. blizzard is pure evil and will put money before human life any day. I'll never buy another blizzard product.
---
Average gold per run is 9g 5s 3cc.
---
Asuming you do 5 runs per hour, thats 45g 25s 15cc per hour.
---
But your runs wont be 10 mins, so it will most likely be a bit lower.
---
Princess drops a pre raid BiS dps ring for rogues / warriors, classes thay cant solo the instance. So its not unusual to have someone tag along and pay 15-20g for the ring.
---
Which can drastically increase your gph.
---
Ranged 3 second stun.   Need I say more?  Frost reflector, shadow reflector, goblin rocket boots, goblin rocket helm, dragonling.  Gnomish mind control cap.  BOMBS
---
Hard disagree holy cow this has no effect on casual players. I am lvl 35 and I can keep enjoying the game at my own pace regardless.
---
Welcome to Classic wow, where a fundamental part of many classes are STILL glitched with no end in sight
---
I.e. hunters get destroyed in wpvp by anyone who can close the gap because feign/trap is busted. Pet enters you into combat the moment it runs at something even before hitting it etc.
---
Blizz has vanished from the forums and isn‚Äôt taking patching seriously.
---
Just do dungeons to get gear and destroy as Shadow. 40+ Shadow doesn‚Äôt have to stop for very much and can usually handle 1-2+ gankers easily depending on skill if you keep Inner Fire up.
---
You can do amazing exp/hr if you kill everything on your way to quests and just knock that shit out. Duo questing isn‚Äôt really slower than normal if you do it right. Most people just run to the quest area and finish all the quests in a zone and wonder why they barely leveled up.
---
No goblin mortar? You're missing out...

Not really. The blasted lands mobs that don‚Äôt die and can be only killed by a quest item are much better. They go into a vanished state at 1% so you can auto attack as long as you need to. I believe their name is servant of alistarj

Nope it came in with BC

ok, then cross that bridge when they get there, but at least there trying and making a diff. hopefully they let him stay stupid shit like cosby is innocent. the fans will hate him. the situation here is that most of support hong kong.

I was doing ZF yesterday, and as a healer it is nice to get some water from a mage, so i always tip a small ammount, but this mage just ignored me the whole dungeon, didnt say a word the whole time, needed on an staff without stats but just with a chance on hit on it.. I asked what he was going to do with that. No anwser, i think he just needed the 3,5g i guess. I dont have a point for this just to say that i had another bad incounter with a mages, just saying.
---
At one point you get to ferelas (if youre horde) and theres a quest to kill elementals for some drops. These elementals near the coast drop 1300mana water like it was hot as hell.
---
That lesser elemental quest was awful, the ones after it were so easy in comparison.

it balances out because people will pay higher prices for things you farm.  low level players will actually be able to sell greens on the AH for good prices instead of just vendoring etc, easier to get mount money also so it inflates but it doesnt break the economy.
---
Is there a way to make a macro that casts Ghostly strike, but when it is on cooldown it casts Sinister Strike?
---
Hi mate, and go fuck yourself, and go suck Chairman Jinpings dick.
---
As far as I am concerned, you people are supporters and enablers of genocidal assholes, and I couldn't care less if you remove my posts from a subreddit owned by a company that now literally supports fascism :-)
---
Blizzard tends not to do anything super late in December, so more early-mid.
---
Which, in terms of world bosses at least, is about where they released in vanilla (NA) anyways? So that's perfectly reasonable, and Phase 2 isn't exactly world-altering in general, honestly.
---
and yet, so many people will still *miss* this joke
---
it's unfortunate, but happens to the best of us
---
She is, its the tauren female.
---
That sounds really fun, I was in a guild during legion that had gambling involved, it was fun when you had to wait for people to run
---
Cool dude. Maybe go suck some chinese cock, you seem to like it.
---
Ha!!! That was a nice one
---
According to the United Nations, there is no recognition for Taiwan. It's Chinese Taipei and so it is in all major sports events, such as the Olympics.
---
Faerilina and Herod. Streamer infested.
---
Yeah, Guarm on Mythic in Trials of Valor had a sick damage requirement that had to be maintained even though he charged around the room one shotting anyone in his way. All the meanwhile you had to continuosly stack up and get debuffed with a hard hitting breathe that would kill anyone who wasn't topped. Then dispel groups of two people 3 timds only when they were within 8 yards of each other and 8 yards away from everyone else.
---
He was easy compared to something like Helya.
---
I've laughed so hard on multiple occassions when raid leaders have said that Baron Geddon is a pug killer. If you cant debuff a target (if you can dispell magic) or run 18 yards away from your raid within 10 seconds when you get a certain debuff you probably aren't a raider nor raid ready.
---
The game has been out for more than a month. If it's been taking you this long to get to 60, then I honestly wouldn't expect you to be 60 by the end of the year. Dire Maul being released this "early" changes nothing for you or your playstyle lol.
---
Must be a part of the Ubersreik 5, or four, doesn't matter.
---
Azhaara, but pick up thew quest from IF if youre alliance.
---
No, they did not fix D3.
---
You can of course continue playing, and supporting a fascist-supporting company.
---
Guess what that says about you. Don't bother with a reply.
---
that's like saying the guard just needed to feed his family, don't blame guards. If work for concentration camp supporters(blizzard), and people find out and stop supporting my company(blizzard), IT WAS MY RESPONSIBILITY HERE. I know we're banning people who want freedom in hong kong, I need to work for another company.
---
Yeah, I didn't expect it to go this fast either... But I highly suspect that it is because there are a high player drop off lately.. and blizzard want people to stay in the game. Before this announcement most realms didn't reach full status until evening, now they are getting to full status again much earlier. So that clearly tells me blizzard is trying to keep you in the loop. Their phases will be based on when people drops to a certain number, rather than what would be healthy for the game. Gotta please those who rushed the game, gotta keep them in the loop, give them a carrot and a reason to stay subbed. I feel like this will backfire for blizzard, pleasing the elite, while the casuals gets scared off or intimidated, so they give up reaching to 60, because they look up at the elite, and want to gear as well like them, but some might never get to 60 before DM comes, let alone even gearing, thus feeling like being in a constant cycle of being behind all the time, and just out right quit. I fear it's going too fast and that blizzard only do it to keep people subbed, and not because it's the best choice. 
---
Tldr: I agree, it's going too fast.
---
I think it will present a challenge but not like it did in vanilla. I also think that smooth 60fps and less latency has also made the game easier.
---
You never, under any circumstances, give this to a Hunter. Please quit the game.
---
You aren't comparing your self to a good bear. They easily have more armor then a warrior has when geared properly as well as more health. Bears also output more threat then a warrior does which is important in instances when you want to explode things fast instead of waiting for threat to build up. Combine that with innervate, br, motw, and of healing between pulls and druids are much better in 5 man dungeons then warriors.
---
No keybinds?
---
Don't know why you're being downvoted, I played a lock and I keep an eye on the soulstone situation at all time. It's crazy to think a warlock gets high enough in level to get the soulstone ability and DOESN'T remember to keep a healthy stock of soul shards.
---
Do you level your professions to 300 and sell what you craft the same price it cost you to craft it? Lockpicking is a profession and theres nothing dirty in charging for your time.
---
The stupidity of some of the people who play the game never ceases to surprise me even after 13 years.
---
So you average like 4h a day with a job, relationship and other hobbies? That's very hardcore.
---
Also the sample size o  just orgri makes no sense. People are out in the world, not sitting in town. I'm pretty sure the bell curve would peek around level 40 at the moment.
---
I guess I can‚Äôt expect for you to understand, it‚Äôs clear you are not trying to look at this clearly. The language you use screams bias. I don‚Äôt know what this has to do with classic wow or cash grabbing. 
---
I don‚Äôt even know how you can say that what they did was supporting mass genocide, that‚Äôs a huge lead, multiple huge leaps.
---
From: ‚ÄúBlizzard bans and removes winnings from tournament participant for breaking tournament conduct rules. Removes video as it was not message Blizzard wished to send to millions of their viewers during a video game tournament.‚Äù
---
To: ‚ÄúBlizzard supports genocide‚Äù
---
Have you enabled the advanced logging option in wow system settings?
---
PSA: Blitzchung
---
Majority of servers don‚Äôt have queues anymore, with lots having layers gone as well. I currently play on Rattlegore and it is very balanced in my experience and gets to high/full status at peak times. Great server so far.
---
Just blame all the locks and paladins complaining about their epic mount chain... how dare Blizz expect them to pay for their mounts like the rest of us
---
Get layered noob
---
Dam i‚Äôm half way to how many you have
---
Can't comply as a skinner I love theese quests. Especially STV ones "kill 10+X of those beasts" Free skins and hides everywhere.
---
Me, my wife, my daughter and my debt support this post.
---
I hope all these people unsubbing also stop playing any other game tencent has invested in. AKA almost every game out today. If you are really that affected by the events in Hong Kong then you will stop playing LoL, fortnite, call of duty, and every other game. Otherwise you don't really care about the situation and are just following outrage culture.
---
OK mate, your welcome to your opinion.
---
Remember when they came out with a launch plan and an ETA of phases.  Not only are they starting DM outside of phase 2 time frame, but they are splitting it away from the phase all together.  Some people have upgrades from DM. More things to farm.  It just has no reason to be in the game yet
---
This will probably happen to any game / developer trying to enter / expand in the Chinese market. 
---
It must be rough to have loyal fans derailing the company. I sure hope the fans dont take it wrongly. The companies got bills to pay too. Not everybody and be facebook and google.
---
Clearly not as much as you like self validation.
---
I agree with this sentiment but I think the majority of players prioritise their epic mount over gear.   They probably aren't playing alpha warriors and rogues though and care about such frivolities over being the biggest beast they can be. 
---
different strokes.  Personally I won't be on an epic mount until there are no BOE upgrades left for me to buy.   I am not in such a hurry I would prefer the increased mount speed over ONE THOUSAND GOLD worth of gear like flurry axes with crusader enchants and devilsaur sets.  
---
1000g worth of gear is such a huge power differential I kinda don't see the logic of spending it all on a fancy horse.  That's just me, most people don't see it that way.
---
Gambling involved sure, mandatory or you lose out on a chance to roll on gear next raid?
---
You can go horde on a different server.
---
Deadmines perhaps? Some abbreviate that as DM as well.
---
personally, i'm fine with DM coming this soon, but i was expecting to have a second 60 by the time DM came out since i expected it to be 3-4 months after launch and not under 2 months. my second character is a mage, sort of because i wanted to take advantage of dire maul farming when it came out, lol. oh well
---
Then no
---
Not sure how much of those prices is because there is little gold in the economy vs. there is a huge over supply of leveling materials. A lot of that stuff isn't even cheaper because it gets just vendored at that point.
---
which is better for leveling warlock (50-60), bad mojo mask or shadoweave mask? more generally, how do i weigh int/stam/spirit against spellpower?
---
0.003%
---
&gt; *even Blizzard* did not see any reason Dire Maul needed to be postponed
---
Chuckled at this. You clearly meant "even Blizzard of the past", but the way you phrased it makes it sound like your brain has categorised "today's Blizzard" as a totally different company, which is fair enough.
---
So somehow you care about world first kill of Prince Tortheldrin, but you didn't care about world first Onyxia/Ragnaros?
---
Tried 0/30/21 for one dungeon after tanking in 11/33/7.
---
I missed the rage and threat alot, and threat would be kinda bad in MC no?
---
&gt;this is a game released 10+years ago,in a time where gaming, guides, technology and stuff are no where near as popular
---
How old are you? 2004 was very technological. Broadband came before WoW. Google came out in late 90s and you could find all kinds of WoW guides after release. Gaming guides existed before WoW came out and people have been playing online games since the 90s. Internet use became mainstream around the late 90s and even more so in the early 2000s when broadband became more available.
---
I don‚Äôt support this violence and never will, every time you smash, burn, assault and beat you devalue your cause and if you think that makes me anti-Hong Kong or Pro-China so be it.
---
I‚Äôve marched in plenty of protests and never had to throw a punch, burn a building or destroy public services 
---
Listen to yourself ‚Äòdissent sower‚Äô
---
Yeah i really hope they can delay phase 2, i'm not even 40 and i do NOT want to be honor snack for horde at lvl50+. it will be impossible for me to levelup and enjoy the game.
---
Lmao, coming from the person who proudly admit he would rather support de-facto slavery *completely*? It's pretty black and white for you anyway that you're either a bad troll or an asshole.
---
Just because new content is coming out, doesn't mean you're required to rush levelling. You can't do the endgame stuff and that's okay. This isn't BFA.
---
Not sure yet, but it's been going pretty well so far so it's possible.
---
9 days played time atm says to me you have a job, and you play wow... that‚Äôs about it
---
Canceled. Better games out there by better companies.
---
I already cancelled my classic subscription. All humans are responsible for one another, make the change. Fuck these corporate bastards. I never thought they could ruin classic wow, I guess I was wrong. They ruined their whole damn company. Give me liberty or give me death! FREE HONG KONG!
---
Like.. are you in the US? Europe? Oceania?
---
If you a boy you pick boy, if you girl pick girl. Zug zug don't want to hit on them trans orc girls because you like pretty. Me not that kind of orc.
---
Troll Warrior.
---
*Not a single one.*
---
Berserking is amazing for tanking, and the [lanky-but-strong Troll style looks awesome.](https://i.imgur.com/fjCBIRX.png) PVP will probably make me regret my decision a tad as orc is just awesome for it, but there's a disadvantage to everything. Classic's really fun, man!
---
Locks idk about solo tribute but they can aoe farm, even priests have figured out a way to make decent gold in DM, it's doable for a variety of classes
---
&gt;And a huge change to pre raid BiS lists.
---
That is exactly the sort of thing casuals care about. BIS BIS BIS MUST GET MY BIS!
---
Yes because this is 2004 and encounters take so long that we need 10 fear wards lmfao.
---
If you are playing a specific race/class combo you might not particularly like, you are eventually going to regret it due to the game being so trivial and ‚Äúfigured out‚Äù and when all content is released and cleared you‚Äôll be stuck with that race/class combo you didn‚Äôt like but wanted to roll cause ‚Äúmeta‚Äù.
---
Will it give you an advantage? Yes, for now probably. Later on? Any priest will work out more than fine.
---
HONG KONG NUMBER ONE
---
Most of my friends are 60 and raiding. I'm 48 Warrior, so just taking things nice and easy until 50-ish where I will try to grab some pre-raid stuff at a steady pace towards 60.
---
They claim they haven't played a lot... lol... of course not. Just, you know, entire days and over 5-6 hours a day heh.
---
Lol i literally only tap my TAB key to cycle or select a front target. Say there are two, one in front, one to right. I'll hit tab as i approach or jist hit a melee spell. But tab helps u cycling thru targets and the cross hair thing I never found a real use for
---
WTB Goomba on grobbulus
---
He hasn't started yet, don't stress him with the specifics.
---
Honored was the tabard then to get bonus exp. Or maybe that was wotlk, so long ago I can't recall
---
and here I am ... running a group through SM cathedral as healer .. just to be asked by the tank at the end "why are you even playing druid?" and then moved on how useless druid is in every role ... felt so bad that I finished the dungeon and quit wow for the day ...
---
Want to go Fury for my pvp warrior. I know the sweaty nerds think Arms is le meta for pvp but I like Fury and I want to do my thing.
---
I was thinking about side speccing into prot for Iron Will instead of the typical Arms for the Rage talents. I'm an Orc so 5 points in Iron Will give me an insane 40% stun resistance.  Or I could go 4 points for 37% and go 11/31/9 for Increased Parry, Tactical Mastery, AND Anger Management. What do you think?
---
Twitch chat, any mention of China will be insta ban, before u know it chat will be clear of any conversation.

I have to be honest this whole thing has me confused to fuck.

All major esport hosts; Don't discuss politics on our platform, or you're banned and your prize money will be revoked.  
---
Player: Brings up politics, on their platform.

Host: aaaaaaand banned.

That's literally the chain of events, it just so happens that the majority of us agree with what he said. I guess that means it should have been allowed? I really don't get it lol.

I don't want to tune into HS:WC and see a guy in a MAGA hat endorsing trump 2020, but clearly that's just me.

Thank you

Haha this gave me a chuckle, good old light hearted bants
---
Good call blizzard.
---
No lol. You really think you are doing someone a favor by letting them open your boxes? Its like telling someone to come mine a node for you and give you the minerals because the +1 skill is a good pay for them.
---
For worse. This is when mass inflation really hits us.
---
I think this is a great place to ask this question instead of making a separate post.
---
I would like to make a macro that casts charge and after that rend and then berserker stance. However, if I input 
---
/Cast charge
---
/Cast rend
---
/Cast berserker stance
---
It obviously cant cast rend because Im not yet in melee range. Im kind of a noob and not familiar with the syntax, so is there a way to delay rend until I am in range?
---
I like how you say that when I have done it, fair it has been on a Private server, but I don't see what will be different enough to make it impossible.  
---
The only thing that is difficult is the multi packs, where you have to MC, and let the other mobs kill it, then you have to shield, fade, MC another one, and try to grab aggro of the last mob ASAP.  
---
It can help with defensive potions so you survive longer in case it takes a while to grab aggro back.
---
Got hooked under the side of the ship that hovers over the dock while fishing with my gnome multiple times. Sometimes it pushs you off when switching zones.
---
Only in a well coordinated group with min maxed healers and dps.
---
Oh really? Please tell me then, why did the casters get fired and why did the player get all his winning removed and banned. Tell me, since you did your research and know this article and title are not fake news. Be prepared to look like a moron.
---
Go to the Dwarf and night Elf equivalent of Duskwood which would be Ashenvale and Wetlands. That should be able to get you to 32-34 easy depending how much you do then you can breeze through STV
---
What‚Äôs the key bind for ball cupping?
---
Obviously you have a blizzard's official comment that confirms your claim ? Because blizzard ppl have said in interviews that layers DO have max number of ppl.

World of Warcraft NA Release Date - Nov 24, 2004
---
World of Warcraft EU Release Date - Feb 11, 2005
---
World of Warcraft Patch 1.3.0 ("Ruins of Dire Maul") Release Date - 7 March, 2005
---
Time between EU Release and DM Patch: 24 days
---
Time between Classic Release and DM Patch: 44 days
---
Number of whiners at Vanilla EU patch release: Probably very close to zero
---
Number of whiners today: Way, way, way too many.
---
\&gt; If DM is released, people will stop doing MC en masse 
---
Is this some sort of insight you have to have spend the last 5 years on private servers for to have? because in 2005 we farmed MC into the ground despite Dire Maul being live.
---
Wow I‚Äôm so dumb...
---
Ty
---
This is like a wow version of Dead by Daylight ahaha love it
---
Is it worth buying gear before level 60?
---
Everyone knew that was very likely to be like that.
---
It's not about being in competition with hardcore players, it's more about since vanilla only have so much content (if they don't come up with new content after naxx) and if they start rushing out raids as soon as hardcore palyers cleared it all the content will be out fairly soon and the game would start dying of for PvE players. Atleast that's my biggest fear for the PvE players
---
Most of the wildlife in Azeroth is sentient I think.  You do quests with talking turtles, gorillas, winds serpents....etc
---
Honestly wouldn't worry about it enough to download an addon. Just get one that shows vendor price and maybe AH price and you'll know pretty quick if something is worth clearing a spot for. As time goes on you'll get more bags and it won't be an issue.
---
That's a lot of moving parts and there is no definitive answer between degrees of stats and degrees of armor but from a tanking perspective:
---
armor&gt;stamina because the ROI is better for healers. Agility is crit chance and dodge chance whereas strength is just damage so agility&gt;strength. It gets a little tricky comparing armor to strength as we start comparing different goals and different outcomes. If you find that you can't hold threat, you might need to focus more on agility and strength gear, and if you find that you are unable to tank the mobs you have, then you might want to focus on your armor and stamina. 
---
IN GENERAL, because agility is both an offensive and defensive stat, you should want a healthy amount (though dodges don't generate any rage, let's assume your dodge chance isn't so high that it dramatically impacts your rage), then armor, then strength, then stamina. 
---
And to go back to your initial question, yes, you should wear a piece of leather if it is a significant improvement, but you should probably have a target for your armor that you don't want to drop below. So for example, I think plate w/o shield is about 40% damage reduction? If that is correct, maybe don't go below 35% just to improve your stats?
---
That‚Äôs great.
---
You on Old Blanchy by any chance? Come on over to Champions of Stormwind. A lot of people right around your level that don‚Äôt give a shit what you run. Play what you have fun playing or else what‚Äôs the fucking point of it all. Ya know?
---
I still don't know what's so bad about keyboard turning
---
Vendor Price; If you have your bag up and hit ctrl it will mark a border around the lowest value items in bag
---
Thankfully if you have a guild, you don‚Äôt have to.
---
‚ÄúNo‚Äù
---
I don't care if you are druid or warrior as a tank, as long as you keep your aggro. Paladins suck in 5 man because they lack taunts.
---
I'm a healer btw
---
Winning answer. If she truly loves you, she would enjoy seeing you do things you enjoy. Told my GF these things at the beginning. That being said: all things should ofcourse be taken in moderation ;-)
---
If you‚Äôre blighter on shazzrah your new goal could be to stop being a ninjalooter
---
Opening with Garrote on warriors is fine if you have crippling poison on. Following up with a few hits to build combo points, then land a rupture. Use the cripping poison to stay out of his melee range while he bleeds, but not far enough away that he can intercept you.
---
Thanks, wasn't aware. And Archage is the only MMO that's had a WoW-like feel + other cool stuff absent from WoW.
---
They kind of added too much crap and p2win stuff, but if they've removed them and are launching a new one, that's promising.
---
Paid my last loaned mooncloth back last sunday!
---
Yes, this. For some reason I always specifically visualize it with a high level warrior carefully lining up his mace with a murloc's head, taking some slow test swings like it's a golf club, then going for it and just vaporizing the head. Then he bends over and says "lol this murloc has no eyes never saw it coming."
---
I did not know that!!! Thanks!! Great tip
---
Hit 60 and delete your character, but be sure to post the video of you doing so.
---
So you're just adding random shit for no reason? Weird, but okay.
---
Did everyone forget that vanilla content was released in only roughly one year? And how blizzard wanted to keep this pace?
---
Nah, if you play the game on easy mode you're the soft one. You gank people because you're afraid to fight people that can actually beat you. I mean, how can you or anyone like you actually even argue against this? You're doing things the easy way. The common way. The way everyone says to. You live your life on autopilot. Stop being so soft, ya marshmallow powderpuff.
---
Anyone who played Lineage 2 prior to WoW vanilla scoffs at the idea of playing another ultra-grinder from these clowns. I don't think this is relevant.
---
&gt;- so my expert conclusion after 90 seconds of research is that this is a shitty chinese MMO like every other shitty chinese
---
Definitely not true.
---
**NA Horde Incendius.** Me and my fiance (60 frost mage, 60 daggers rogue) are looking for a weekend raiding guild, alternatively, a weekday raiding guild that raids between 2AM-6AM or 9AM-1PM server time (although, weekend would be much much preferred).   
---
We'd like a guild with at least a few core players - that being said, the size of the guild is not the most important thing as long as daily recruitement is being done and it's active. We don't mind having to pug players for raids. One thing we demand though, is that the GM/RL is on time, that we have shit figured out etc. so there won't be any confusion. Our last guild had 7pm as raid time and we ended up running a 5h MC from 9pm...
---
In addition to PvE, we are also interested in PvP and are planning on farming honor points when the time comes.
---
They are green to 225. Very easy to get there.
---
Typical warrior.
---
We see it as a sacrifice because classic wow is a game we enjoy playing. By unsubscribing we sacrifice our enjoyment, however small this sacrifice is, it's still a sacrifice. The added bonus is that we hurt a company that bends over to a murderous, totalitarian regime like PROC. By cancelling our subscription we send a clear message to Blizzard that we are not OK with their decisions
---
Welp, this took me one or two times to get. Lol
---
Gotta keep Shroud interested, somehow.
---
You charge in after carefully waiting for healermana to regenerate, and you see a small bolt of damage overtaking you. It's a Shadowbolt, your taunt resists...And you wipe since your Mocking blow got parried and the next taunt resists, too, and your DPS is too low to kill the mobs otherwise.
---
And of *course* it's you, the tanks fault that you all wiped since you didn't hold threat.
---
Shit like this is why almost nobody likes to tank dungeons, especially with randoms. Nobody respects them, everyone wants to pad the meters and there's almost nothing you can do to improve it unless you're fine wasting tons of gold on Sapper Charges for Dungeons.
---
Raids at least have people respecting the mechanics and tanks get to call out the folks who refuse to mind threat.
---
This, absolutely. I would probably not do Searing before 49/50, but get Mara done for sure. Awesome sword reward from main q and lots of XP and gold.
---
Supposedly forever.
---
Was the only skinner in wetlands raptor excavation area and really too low level to kill them on my own. Couldn't keep up with all the skins just laying around!
---
Damn that was fresh.
---
They said that they now since they done the work for classic bringing TBC/Wotlk will be much easier since the work is already done. But they said they are still thinking about if they are gonna do it.  
---
Imo its only matter of time. Once all the phases of classic release and are done there will be content drought and people will lose interest. And releasing TBC is super easy money.
---
woot?
---
Dustwallow marsh is the shittiest
---
Honestly the remote would be one of the easier ones listed
---
first of all, 6 weeks isnt rushing. thats already slow. rushing is 1-2 weeks
---
anyone not 60 now, is just slow.
---
second, theres no reason to say "oh well no DM yet might as well not hit 60" you can do brd, lbrs, strath, ubrs scholo. all the while getting ready for and doing MC and ony.
---
theres plenty of content for lvl 60s right now, and for some reason your saying that being 60 NOW is 'rushing'.
---
wtf is hitting 60 in 4days? whats clearing MC in the first week? because to me, thats rushing
---
i enjoyed my time leveling, but it eventually had to come to an end. im a mage that didnt aoe spam outside of dungeons. and the only levels i hard spellcleaved for were 32-40 and 55-60. and these were because i either didnt want to do certain quests (fuck STV) or because i wanted to have access to more dungeons and even then it still took me about 5 weeks to hit 60.
---
i played it slow, if you arnt 60 now. then you somehow managed to go slower then i did.
---
thats not my fault, thats not blizzards fault. thats your fault
---
Ass blacked out? What is wrong with the word ass?
---
Where is this? Crazy how after all these years I‚Äôm still finding new stuff out lol
---
Agree with op
---
I've never used a keyboard like that, but I would presume that your thumb doesn't have the dexterity to reliably hit ctrl alt and shift when necessary, and switching between them quickly would be an issue. Also you lose all the easy index finger hotkeys (e r t f g x c v) so it seems kind of pointless.
---
Bro hunters have a ton of potential to get gold
---
I just found out yesterday that you can rebind "b" to open ALL bags, not just your main bag. Such a huge quality of life change.
---
Actually, I am pretty sure most blizzard devs on WoW for long tenures would admit to making mistakes like catering to player feedback instead of pushing the envelope of what they thought was better MMO design. 
---
The plumber you hire to replumb your house shouldn't go by what you think of as "good plumbing". He should go by what HE thinks of as good plumbing -- he is the plumber. 
---
Devs should listen to feedback and more importantly, understand the feedback. But you never want to prioritize the loudest, vocal, minority. *Blizzard used to understand what players wanted -- now, they just understand what players say they want, which often is not what they actually want*.
---
Do you want to do more damage or high survivability? If youre drain tanking, the +shadow damage/spell power affects drain life which would essentially increase the amount of health given back so both damage and survivability would go up. With dark pact (if talented) spirit isn‚Äôt that much in demand since you would get your mana back going between mobs
---
Don't do that. Blizzard is evil.
---

I like to think of it like this: what's better? 25% with 0 talents 'wasted' or 40% and 10 wasted? I tend to think the former is better, as neither 25 nor 40 percent is insubstantial, yet neither can really be relied on to consistently shift a fight in your favor. As such, I favor going deeper into arms where the ROI on spent talents is generally better.

I don't have to support a company that doesn't think human lives and freedom matter more than profit. I don't have to accept other people supporting a company that does the same. Because if you do you're a shitheel.
---
Ban this guy, please. Just look at his post history
---
NSFW gnomes are disgusting.
---
Thanks for the insight! :)
---
Yeah, I've been playing shaman and it feels pretty obvious to me that they decided to sweep a talent update into TBC. Would love an update that makes enhancement more than waiting for windfury procs, and elemental more than going out of Mana.
---
Typically not. I‚Äôd say the exception is weapons - a lot of classes live and die by their weapons, and if you haven‚Äôt found a good quest reward or dungeon drop in several levels, you may be handicapping yourself and not realizing it. 
---
In that case splurging for something from the AH could be worth it. You pay up front, but if the result is faster grinding, less downtime, less corpse runs, etc...then that all equates to getting more gold faster, and a net gain in the long run.
---
hamstring gets dodged/parried... prepare to run back to your corpse
---
I recomend Guidelime_Bustea‚Äôs 1-60 horde :-)
---
\+spell damage is everything for a warlock since all your other stats are just a life tap or drain life away from being what you need them to be.
---
There is a bulletin board addon. It gets messages from chat and puts them in a list. I think it‚Äôs called dungeon finder classic or something like that
---
Try this : https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/simple-unit-frames-classic
---
I think it will only benefit players sub 50 for once they hit 60, they will be eligible to roll for loot that is better than some of the loot currently offered by raiding.

---
&gt; "why waste time in Classic when I can wait until the TBC/Wrath servers arrive"
---
Which would be completely absurd and I'd be happy to see such stupid people gone. 
---
It's a GAME. You have fun, you play, you don't, you don't. It's not that complicated you guys.
---
I made this argument in a comment thread the other day and got downvoted. Open Reddit this morning and it's frontpage! But yeah, slow content release would be nice.
---
What difference would it make for those people? Three weeks, why? Why do they need to be 60 when  DM hits?
---
It always amuses me when a rogue gets low and pops evasion.
---
When I'm playing on my warlock. DODGE MY SUCCUBUS!
---
Run your own pugs
---
Tell me which bosses I cannot kill without a tank, do you need me to record these kills or what? We've done all the bosses of scholomance, strat live and LBRS multiple times and none of them are close to a wipe fest.

You're probably the type of person that tells people to vote with their dollars when a company does something that people don't like. Except when it's a company you do like or a game you can't give up.
---
&gt; You don't know have to squash something people believe in just to show how unique and superior you are. Why the hell do you care what these people are doing? And if you don't, then fuck off, why are you even commenting?

Because I think people like you are retarded and I love to annoy you :D
---
gimme gold
---
Omg... this is so relatable xd
---
It's not the casuals, it's Blizzard that don't give a shit what content is released when as long as it makes money.
---
Why would OP think Blizzard would give a shit about few casuals when Blizzard CLEARLY doesn't give a shit about millions of ******* (censored by Tencent, China).
---
Might be leveling a weapon skill.
---
Lol a lot actually.  I don‚Äôt fuck with priests on my rogue until I we get a way out of that psychic scream.
---
üá≠üá∞
---
Apparently you also have human decency too.
---
Every other blizz sub, the mods had posts with big multiple paragraph disclaimers talking about how it was violating the rules and telling everyone to stop posting threads and complaining about how they had to delete a bunch of shit.
---
You're just like "yeah no this should be discussed." Heck, you even politely said "this is pretty fucked up." At least, that's how I interpreted "this situation is exceptional enough that it would be inappropriate to forcibly cease the discussion."
---
I appreciate chill mods. It's a thankless job. But you have my thanks.
---
How old are you now? :)
---
Halfway is 47 EXP wise I believe
---
Yeah maybe avoid tanking or healing. Warlocks and hunters are the easiests to level. Warriors are likely the hardest. I think you should play a pure dps class with no tanking or healing capability.
---
Then they can't do raids anyway so why bitch about it? Imo if people want slowed down/casual servers blizzard should have made them (or accelerated servers) exactly how they should have made a dedicated streamer server.
---
Ok thats cool, i would be totally up for a classic Wotlk.
---
Not sure if I‚Äòm super gullible or this is true.
---
I was here yesterday üò≤
---
I'm sure I heard somewhere that they did it to reduce the load on the servers slightly as people would have to manually select their server after getting past the login server.
---
I'd guess they'll change it at some point, maybe for phase 2.
---
If more content bothers you just pretend its not there. At level 40 Diremaul won't be something you can do just keep playing the way you are and when you are a mid 50 if you like you can run DM
---
Post, a lot, on the blizz forums, twitter and via in game feedback. The more people post, the more attention it gets. This is why they suggest posting bugs on the forums and via ingame, to get attention. The more people affected, the more important it becomes. 
---
Best of luck, I hope you get results :-)
---
I know of death coil,what's the other?

Night elves are the same way:

Scum of the earth.
---
I was talking about the announcers and you definately understand that. 
---
Side note, you're way too talented a shill to be working for this shithouse company. But I guess you folks'd be hired on an "as needed" basis. In any case, if the ships sinking the rats ought to scatter. Won't look good on the ol' resume if you know what I'm saying. Just my two cents. Anyways, have a fun night misleading rubes, probably talk to you again at some point.
---
Why is it a goal in itself to extend it as long as possible? I don‚Äôt get it. I just want to play the patches and get it over with, it‚Äôs gonna be stuck on the end patch forever anyway. The game won‚Äôt become better by artificially prolonging patches or waiting forever on people who aren‚Äôt even online.
---
Yeah fuck that shit I would bounce.
---
Don't know if this would work but why not try this macro:
---
/Cast ghostly strike
---
/Cast sinister strike
---
I assume global cooldown would prevent SS if you can GS
---
If your GS in on cooldown assume it won't burn a global cooldown and will proceed to sinister strike
---
Stunning and brave.

I did during first week actually. The game felt way too slow for stimulants. It's far more pleasing to finish up home chores, put phone on silent and disappear into wow for a few hours sober. It's literally more addicting than cocaine.
---
What is a human right, and do people argue about them in politics?
---
Being a mod sucks. It's unpaid, it's thankless, and it's monotonous.
---
Of course, if you're a power addict who can get high off of the slightest flex of authority, then the job is its own reward. Seriously, the way some people power trip with even the smallest bit of power, you'd think they were king of the world. The reality is they're just some ant on a pile of dirt, but they could give a fuck about reality - they're high off their ass on power.
---
This is why good people are rarely mods, or authority figures in general. Power isn't just corrupting, it actively draws people who want to abuse it.
---
Can't even play because the queue is still 6k in the evening

this is some borderline psychotic stuff here
---
As GM a maintank for a guild that has MC and Ony on farm already: **Fuck** those entitled idiots.
---
You don't magically learn how to do AoE threat by getting better gear, either. This is something my guild currently has to learn: Their AoE DPS is becoming crazier and crazier and our tanks have to keep telling em that if they can't burst something quick enough for it to not matter that they drew threat in the first place, then they need to wait for a second.
---
Dungeontanking is *rough*. Bosstanking is *easy*. DPS players keep thinking it's the other way around, which it isn't. Until your tank has Thunderfury and is fine wasting gold on Sapper Charges for dungeonruns, then and only then can you AoE like a madman against a warrior on pull.
---
Fuck your guild, OP. Let them be trash and enjoy their misery. Hope you find a new home, soon. Getting this much shit talked to your face when you built the damn thing is insanely entitled, too. Fuck that, too. It's *so* rough to coordinate everything, and whenever someone even has the hint of "why don't you just" coming on, I immediately get defensive. Me and my officers do a *lot* of work behind the scenes which people don't notice, have plans for everything and are all pretty decent at the game while constantly improving, too.
---
An entitled person going full on toxic by thinking they know best is the easiest way to tick me off. Good on you OP.
---
** Seinfeld music plays **
---
This game is extremely casual friendly. 
---
There just happens to be a lot of hardcore players than min-max everything and go for perfection.
---
You can play this game if you want.
---
Use Auctioneer, it won't hide 1 stack items, but it shows a lot more items at once and you can skip to the pages with bigger stacks much easier.
---
People did political views on blizzards official competition interview (that was streamed). Pretty sure its explicitly forbidden in their contracts, as its in MANY other tournaments, meaning not just blizzard but all other games too. You can have your opinions and voice them in your own time, but NOT use the tournament and blizzards stream to push them out.
---
I get why the player was banned, he clearly broke the rules, but banning the casters that were on the stage too ? How did they participate in that ? Havent seen a vid of it.
---
My viewpoint is that the guy violated a contract and brought politics into a game setting. Don't blame blizzard for banning him and also don't blame them for not publicly damning China. They are a company and don't want to get political with it.
---
Speaking from a tank perspective, I found simply running dungeons the most fun way to optain gold. Grinding is a chore to begin with and much more so when you are not playing a DPS class. Find yourself a solid guild or friendlist so you are not risking *that* group. A tank with a solid grasp of how fast he can pull is most important.
---
If that is your thing, you could also try playing the auction house. Best gold per hour if you rock it, but there is always the risk of losing gold instead.
---
True. I guess yell at 'em to hop on Discord instead.
---
If you're a casual player, the rate that content passes is only benefical to you. It's rather irresponsible for you to say for them to slow things down. We need Phase 2 Asap for the hardcore players because that will be the most fun content to participate in and it shouldn't affect Casual players. If you're casual, you should have already given up on getting anywhere high on the Rank 14 grind. I know I have. And if you chose a PvP server, you knew what was coming. I believe there are still Free Character transfers to get out before your corpse is camped and honor farmed. And no matter what raids comes out, that just means the previous raids will become a cake walk for you to get carried through
---
. 
---
And no, I am not an elitist. I never have been in WoW. I think my only real accomplishment was hitting 2200 in pvp rank in MoP before I quit. But, besides that. I was the casual as casual can be. When ICC came out, I was doing TOC and Uld. When Cata came out I was excited, i could finally run ICC and kill the Lich King and obtain a full set of heroic T10. and When Dragon Soul came out, I was excited my casual guild could take our LFR gear and do Firelands. (That's right. LFR positively affected someone)
---
New content isn't going to ruin you but only allow you to reach new content. Who cares if you're there yet? The people who are are only paving the way for you to play casually and have an easier time.
---
Thalnos has a healthy horde population and is always high at peak times. There were que times in the first couple weeks but haven‚Äôt seen any since

YOU STARTED IT @BLIZZARD AND YOU CAN'T FINISH IT

Then what would you say if I told you I'm prot and only grabbed the chest because the rest of the group were leather/cloth?

It's significantly slower than turning around using your mouse.

Oo it‚Äôs instant cast too. Sorry, last time I was in top rogue shape was vanilla. When I refer to veteran I guess I meant last time I was in top rogue form was 2005. This new breed of gamers though, it took much longer to get the Hand of Rag and there‚Äôs a guild that already has two of them. These kids are insane nowadays. I may not remember all the rogue knowledge that I knew 15 years ago, but I can help ya with a 401k. Now get off my lawn ya whippersnapper!
---
Yes, but in this relationship, who will be wearing the pants? ü§î
---
How does spell power interact with dots?
---
I totally agree with you. I did not rush leveling, picked up mining and engineering so i had to do that to in addition to lockpicking. I even took off from work the first week and played after that 3-5 hours every day and i still am "only" lvl 57. 
---
It's really really hard to manage leveling and having an active life, social life or any other hobbys. 
---
But that's nothing bad, i enjoy it so much, that i actually want to invest these hours after work. The only thing annoying is that i can feel the pressure of keeping up and pushing myself to do things faster. I think it's because i compare myself to other semi-hardcore players and my guild wants to be ready to raid in about 1-2 weeks but the feeling of rushed content may add to that quite a bit. Anyway i do not think that phases will switch way too fast. Maybe add a month on top to their current planning but that's it.
---
I have to agree, I've been on the fence with joining wow again as it shaped my childhood too. 
---
but with the news of content being released only a few months in has solidified my fears of being left behind.
---
What does this even mean? Do you raid for apes?
---
Never wiped I assume?
---
Laughs in stoneform.

The outdoor world is going to be hell from P2 release until whenever BGs are released. The sooner, the better imo. Wouldn't even mind if just WSG or something came with P2, then AV later.

---
True
---
Fuck off with the political bullshit. Dosent belong in here.
---
So u didnt get the joke then. :)
---
I agree with this completely. The thing is, hardcore players are hardcore -- no matter how much content you make, they will chew it up, spit it out, and be hungry by next Tuesday. No pace will keep up. Drop all your vanilla content, they are going to done with it by November. 
---
But, most players returning are casuals. Other than a handful of 60s guilds, most of the life on my server is casuals that have only got to 20-40 to this day. And they aren't the casuals you are used to with retail -- these guys are casual, but they aren't whining and bitching about how hard it is, or how loot isn't dropping, or how they have to grind, or why progression is so slow.
---
These players have the capacity to actually have a really special and good experience with WoW classic. You don't have to "cater to them" as retail caters to it's casuals. Don't speed up the influx of progress, they don't want that. Just let them slowly peel back the layers and experience classic at a slow pace. Hardcore players will be fine, they'll enjoy being the gods of whatever phase they were on. 
---
Players need time to marinate and enjoy a layer of content; because vanilla content actually has meat and bones to it, there's a lot to take in before your 90% of players will want something more. 
---
If you try to make the hardcore players happy, you will always fail. Hardcore players are never happy, because they will always succeed in smashing through the content, and they will always be back with their hands out for more -- and we already know that everything in Vanilla can be smashed through, and the main real gates are farming gear and gearing up tanks, etc. Because with classic we have this drop off, like we have an "end of the road", I don't see what is to be gained by racing towards the end.
---
I agree. Too fast and a sign that they are starting to mess it up.
---
World‚Äôs First 'Insane in the Membrane' anyone?
---
If you are going at a slow pace then what does it matter? If you don't care about reaching 60 in a fast manner then you are clearly casual. Why do you care if end game content gets released?
---
The majority on reddit have no idea what they are talking about, and the fact you think votes know best just makes it worse.
---
You're going to get it whether you like it or not. Deal with it.
---
Is Dire Maul a level 60 dungeon? Just when I looked it up, it showed mobs much lower.
---
Roll a druid and do all 4 roles:)
---
There‚Äôs so much content in TBC it‚Äôs almost impossible to have people in older zones. Thinking of professions, gathering, reagents etc. Also, gear would either have to scale horizontally or be really boring small upgrades. Spreading out people over TBC AND Classic zones will make them feel a lot more empty. I don‚Äôt ever see it working.
---
just create a meme that king gordok in dm looks like the chinese president so blizz cancels the dungeon release

Of course you can MT a pug. Just probably either have to get in the group early or make it yourself.

Im doing the same thing this time around, will join my guilds runs if there is space on the night and I'm on. But I'm not committing my life to raid schedual it's too exhausting to balance with life.
---
*Miss*
---
delete this! less druid more fun for us druids
---
`/combatlog` before you start the raid.
---
Yes, your hitcap does not change beyond the first +5 to weaponskill
---
The thing is though, these casuals this time aren't asking for the epics, they aren't wanting the trophy, they don't want anything to be less hard or take less grind or effort. They don't want higher drop rates, they don't want freebies. What they want is to get enough time to really "live in" each phase of WoW and enjoy each phase. 
---
(And to be clear, I don't entirely agree that this whole DM thing is a fiasco, I don't think it's that big of a deal. But, I don't think it's fair to act like what ruined retail is at all like what these people are saying.)

There‚Äôs a spot east of the badlands with tons of them.

Um, what does this game got to do with what is happening in hk, as bad as it is?

Must be simple to view everything as all or nothing. Then you never have to do anything because it's not perfect. When you mentally develop past a child, you will realize the world isn't black and white or all or nothing. Hopefully this isn't your actual outlook on the world and is instead a weak cope because you aren't cancelling your subscription.

Seriously I think corrupting all of blizzard's IP and forcing the association between it and support for Hong Kong independence would be the best sort of revenge. And while we can never convince gamers to boycott it, we can definitely convince them to troll a game company. It's easy, and it's funny - and against an insane quick to censor authoritarian regime, extremely effective.
---
Sadly, some people makes you stop wanting to even play the game. And sadly, It ussually happens when se envolv too much our selfs.
---
I find that response very ironic considering being pro-Hong Kong is opposing the violence..
---
Blizzard please slow down, simply because I broke my arm and won‚Äôt be able to play for weeks.
---
Thanks.
---
Thats bologna. The real reason it looks like that is that one of the blizzard Devs went on one of those treasure hunt trips to glacier point and had to look for a bag with a thousand needles in which took him a long time to find. He then put the inspiration into the map of the same name.
---
Yeah my dude my approach could of been better. Really though it's just there is a wealth of information available about it all now. I'm almost 30 over here but been playing vanilla pservers for years and years in the free time I do have. But the new players are pretty good mechanically no doubt. I can suggest pvp videos or give advice just message me anytime.
---
There is nothing wrong with this, the box contains the Rotten Apple and The command, you are just supposed to deliver it, it's not a drop.

Sorry a little off-topic but what is the purpose of the literally in this sentence? It has the same meaning as without literally in it. Its a downgrade.
---
So im starting to feel like i made a huge mistake. I did mc today, brutality blade dropped, and i won the roll. I was using a 35 dps axe. Brutality blade is 51 dps. I am an orc so i have axe specialization (fury warrior). At first, i thought "well i do 5% more dps with axes, 5% of 35 still doesnt even compare to this). I didnt realize until now that i didnt take into account losing crit to put more hit gear on to get 9%. Is it still a huge upgrade for me? Everyone was gzing me like crazy and telling me how big it was for me. I feel like a scumbag if its really not a big upgrade. Im pretty sure it is though, i just wanted to know peoples thoughts.
---
Fairbanks?
---
‚ÄúGoodbye‚Äù- yeah, thats what I would answer to that.
---
Because that doesnt work. It will give a 'ghostly strike on cooldown' error.
---
They‚Äôve been pretty transparent about layering being a thing since well before Classic was released. 
---
They‚Äôre not displaying it now to be ‚Äúblatant‚Äù, quite the opposite. Nearly a dozen servers have had all their layers removed this week, so they‚Äôre making the distinction between those unlayered servers, and the ones that still have them. The goal still being to remove layers from all servers before phase 2 drops later this year. This is a positive step.
---
As obvious as that may be to us, that is not the perspective of the Chinese government. Shameful for Blizzard to be siding with them on this.
---
I don't expect blizzard to base the schedule around "hyper casual" players. But I also don't expect them to base their schedule on the hardcore players that may be 60 already either. Go for the majority of players, that probably will reach level 60 before the end of the year. If you cater to the top 1%, the game will be done by next summer.
---
Both after what you got attune to. Mc is the easiet to get attune as you just need to clear grim guzller flamelash and the seven and cross a bridge to get the fragmaten. (While being over 55) onyxia is a different stories as it take about 3-4 brd runs to and prequest and a ubrs run
---
there's a road in dustwallow that is generally safe. There's nothing like that in the other 2
---
that would be one hell of an over-reaction.
---
Lucky bastard. Gz man - you are now a server Legend
---
can everyone stop bringing hong kong's political issues into blizzards business? I mean the hearthstone player got banned, not because blizzard advocate Chinese government political views, but because HE BROKE THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE COMPETITION.
---
If more currency enters an economy it is not just money 'moving around'; it is inflation.

My favorite one I've seen so far is somebody said "They actually disabled Alt-F4" It damn near got me.
---
If you're casual in Vanilla and roll a PvP server, you knew what was up. They wanted to be on a server where they couldn't unflag themselves for PvP.
---
Sure but it's easy to remember.
---
What is your gear like to have 24% crit?!!
---
Bizarre people are defending this - streamers put themselves out their publicly and being judged on silly/bratty behaviour is part of it. She completely seems entitled in this clip - idc if there's more to it lol, I probably won't remember it when I wake up
---
&gt; throwing another ride into the theme park because subs dropped after the one month mark
---
bingo. This is it. I support Blizzard, I respect their devs, but I'll be damned if this isn't why they are doing it. 
---
Look, they have the stats of player levels. They know the "normal distribution curve" of levels and where it's centered. They know it's a small% of people who are raiding now.
---
It does change past +5, but the increase is so minimal that its not worth going for.
---
How do you compare earth fury to Skeram? Liking it?
---
I think the raw dps is the biggest factor tbh, when ony goes down in 3 mins with a 30 man raid you dont have much time to make mistakes anyway lol
---
Grats man - server legend now :-)
---
Seems you selectively chose not to read the ‚Äúdisruptive‚Äù part.
---
Someone on my server was a hunter named ‚Äútrumpisking‚Äù with a pet named ‚ÄúBUILDWALL‚Äù and got a forced name change. It‚Äôs not anti hong kong no matter how much you try to selectively read, its anti political bullshit on a video game.
---
Get a buddy that also has trouble solo farming gold, like a warrior, together you synergize very well.
---
Have you tried a /cancelaura stealth macro? Not sure if thats the right one but try it
---
What? No, so more casual players have a chance to get 60 before world PvP has progression driving it.
---
?
---
You sure you actually want a completely unmoderated forum?
---
Shift-P is my fav keybind

Is this a quest ? Haven‚Äôt seen this before

Anathema had something like a 55-60% alliance advantage back when the census data was available. May have leveled out some with transfers from high pops, but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs still majority Alliance.
---
I'm a horde priest who just dinged 40. I got a few questions.
---
I've been levelling using a disc build as recommended by icyveins. What I've really enjoyed is being able to heal in 5 mans, especially when I get random whispers. Icyveins recommends respeccing into shadow at 40 due to access to shadowform with a big boost in damage. How good is this boost? I like healing dungeons but I'm worried that if I stay disc I won't solo level as well. I'd say I'm 20% dungeon, 80% solo level.
---
I'm also broke with only 17g. Essentially because I sunk my earnings into tailoring/enchanting (despite everyone telling me not to). Learnt the hard way. I do have 300 cooking. Should I farm the gold for my mount, and if so, where/how? Or, should I just keep levelling, be ultra conservative with money, and get the mount when I get the gold?
---
Vender all your gear at lvl 1 and get immolate and punch shit to death pro tip
---
Same applies to the ore and herb nodes though...
---
What about linken's boomerang?
---
I'd guess top roll
---
the same people who end up complaining how there's no suitable quests for their level. Nobody is going to level to 60 with just quest xp, at some point mob grinding will have to be done.

Oh, how is America an authoritarian state?
---
For locking millions of innocent people in cages over the drug war. Creating what is effectively a slave market. 
---
For stepping on our first and second ammendment rights over and over again.
---
Government control of the mass media to spread propaganda and division.
---
Mass police brutality with no consequences because of a broken justice system that protects them.
---
Politicians do whatever the fuck they want and get away with it.
---
Taxation without consent of the governed.
---
Broken voting system used to control the people.
---
Using our stolen tax money to fund wars overseas that kill thousands of innocents a year. Wars that literally nobody wants that just feed the military industrial complex.
---
Disruption of the free market for political and monetary gain. 
---
Corrupt government organizations like the DEA, CIA, FDA, FBI, and NSA. 
---
Government spying on its people. 
---
Anyone who blows the whistle on these things is hunted down and called a terrorist. 
---
Do you know what authoritarian means? How was the patriot act not authoritarian? How can you sit there and tell me we are fucking free?

How the fuck *aren't* we authoritarian?

Don't get me wrong. I love America. I love its people. I love the land we live on and our constitution is a work a fucking art. Best constitution in the world. 
---
But fuck our government. It needs to be dismantled from the ground up and everyone at fault needs to be arrested for treason. Thomas Jefferson would be rolling in his motherfucking grave and you should be ashamed of yourself for condoning this bullshit.

What is wrong with reddit???? Diremaul was launch content for eu.
---
It's a filler dungeon with slightly (ever so slightlu) better gear for some specs...
---
All this outrage is mindless.
---
it will basically never matter
---
Warlocks and mages are the worst about it.
---
Did a mara run where as I cast charge the warlock was already fucking multi-dotting and was confused why they had threat
---
And if you disagree with me you're just nitpicking, so I win you lose. Bye-bye.
---
There is no rotation in PvP. You will probably not be able to beat the shaman at lvl 30 unless you are insanely geared for your level. Without most of your skills and without MS you and the shaman are both autoattack machines only he has healing and you don't.
---
I wouldn't bother if I were you, dueling at low levels is ridiculously unbalanced anyways.

Other then him being a dick about it, he's right. This is not hunter loot.
---
What raid are they rushing? I see a lot of "the sky is falling" but no substance imo. Dire Maul is not even a raid. It's just a dungeon and I don't see how it's rushed. Phase 2 doesn't even have a release date other then "late 2019". What I see is a lot of doom and gloom worry about something that may or may not happen.
---
How is PvE going to die? If there are plenty of casual players who aren't leveling fast then that content is just waiting for them even if the hardcore players already went through it.

The goal is to have all layers gone before phase 2, since having them would fuck up the world bosses that will be part of that phase. Seems like they‚Äôre well on track to meet that goal, assuming that P2 drops in December, and all servers are already reduced to 1-2 layers max.

For everyone who doesn't want to end up stuck with no suitable quests. This site is the only reason I've managed to solo quest up to 58 on my pally.
---
casuals don't lose out on anything with content releasing, which is why it's mostly a good thing.  don't worry, play at your pace, and enjoy the content.  as more stuff releases, if you are ready for it or not, you will still be able to tackle it down the road just fine.
---
I'm lvl 28 and I've invested so much time already. I don't understand how much those who are already to 60 must've spent playing. Like every second they're not at work? Or am I just a slow quester? I'm so confused.
---
Im not a native speaker, but i use this word to point out that its a downgrade
---
&gt;The anti retail circlejerk on this sub 
---
More like the general consensus of the gaming community as a whole. People don't care about retail.
---
Or let's just go with the "guys, please don't rush, I can't play that muuuuuch" or even better with the "I am a paying customer and I want to experience all of the content" which led us to the LFR.
---
This thread is basically casual players (which is fine) complaining about end game content which they won't do or even care about, and doesn't affect them in any way.
---
lol i'm not getting funneled anywhere...fuck retail.
---
laugh in demonic. not the rogue strong but the warriors are weak. til lvl 52 is no problem to kill any lvl semi geared warrior as lock.
---
As a mage, how much spell power translates into how much intellect and vice versa?
---
He considers himself relatively not busy, and as a less busy person, I agree /u/gommerthus seems to have more time with the game than he "should" as a working parent
---
I'd bring it up with the officers and GM, if their response is reasonable then all good. If they act like man children, then best you part ways. Plenty of other guilds out there.
---
Who willingly follows a GM like this?  Rofl... gquit and don't look back.
---
Yea but it only matters when it doesnt align with peoples beliefs, as much as i like talking about politics i agree it should be kept out of wow, even if its for an omportant issue like hong kong.
---
People will harp about the quality of druids in raid, I think they are plenty good but that being said: something to consider is how many, out of 40, will be your class. The other important factor is: is it fun?
---
Paladin is not fun to heal IMO, but getting plate is cool and like their shaman counterparts, their group buffs mean that the raid will often take as many as one per group (so 8). Compare that to Druids where it only takes one to give everybody mark of the wild/thorns/cast faerie fire.
---
Druids have a lot to manage which is fun, different heals over time, swiftmend, battle rez, etc. I think they are really cool. However, their heal-over-times don't stack like they do in retail (e.g. two druids can't really heal the same target, and you can't swiftment another druid's hots), combined with being able to buff the entire raid with just one druid, it is no wonder their raid slots can be very competitive. 
---
Priests are great, but also consider you're going to be rolling against every other cloth wearer for gear and as a result, will often be under-geared and so any priest=best class diehards are kind of mitigated by less than stellar gear if you aren't really on your gear game. Also, their AoE/HoT healing is pretty crappy, and as dope as power word:shield is, it chews up mana and your toolbox for keeping an entire party up when shit goes sideways is limited. 
---
Shamans are weird. A lot of their power comes from under the hood, and you really have a very small toolkit as a healer compared to druids and priests. Your bread and butter is totems, but because you have four totems, most of what an individual totem does can seem underwhelming or mercurial. You're kind of like a good luck charm - everything is just better with a Shaman in your party, even if you're not quite sure why.
---
Same for me. Alt is much more comfortable than ctrl. Shift is ok for me.
---
&gt; I support human genocide to allow everything else on this planet to thrive.
---
I mean, I could tell you who to start with, but then I'd get banned.
---
That still proves his point
---
You don't *NEED* to be the MT. If you are not looking to raid more than 1 day / week, best off as others have said, pugging it. You can be an OT and have a great time. Most encounters call for &gt;1 tank so you should find a spot. Hell many encounters call for 3 tanks.
---
The steamsmith struggle is real :D
---
I did the quests in Desolace for the second time just now, as in the first time I learned to simply skip Desolace unless your a hunter or druid.
---
New profession, weatherman.
---
&gt; Looking forward to being told in LFG "why are you doing [blank] when the drops are so much better in [blank]".
---
But this doesn‚Äôt happen in vanilla ever? If there‚Äôs a huge casual base at around level 40 you guys can run your shit in your own pace. This means that you WILL have people getting to 60 at the same time as you. 
---
Or are you too scared that the casuals will abandon the game/not have time to finish instances and you want to be carried by people already being level 60 for 10 weeks?
---
At low levels you do not really stand a chance against any class that can heal. You will have better chances from 40 when you get Mortal Strike.
---
I usually open with Charge (if they kited, like mage jump or got me into combat faster then Intercept). Build some rage, put on Hamstring asap and try keeping it up, watch out for Overpower procs, shoot off a few Heroic Strikes (I use it less when obtaining Mortal Strike). You could also shoot off some Whirlwinds (assuming you talented for stance dancing).
---
There‚Äôs something called retail that is casual friendly...
---
While I do appreciate the humor of this post, I would like to take this opportunity to give some more insight on why you SHOULD ALWAYS use Evasion as a Rogue against a warrior. And this is coming from an Arms warrior main for 14+ years.
---
Most people would tell you that popping evasion against a warrior, especially arms, is an instagib. I'd argue it's far from it.
---
An arms warrior has 3 main hard hitting abilities: Auto attacks, Mortal Strike, Overpower. The auto attacks are always happening and hit very very hard. Mortal strike hits hardest, but is on a 6 second cooldown with a big rage requirement. Overpower only proccs after you've dodged, so that's situational.
---
We can already see that 99% of the time, you will always land at least an auto attack (white attack). By popping evasion, you are opening yourself to get overpowered once or twice, but you automatically cancel any possible auto attacks or mortal strike hits landing on you. So you automatically cancel 2 out of 3 possible hard hitting attacks.
---
Let's say you pop evasion and the warrior is quick enough to cast an Overpower. That's bad for you, but you can still keep dishing out your damage since there's another 6 seconds before he can cast another overpower. By that time you can do a lot of damage and utility, or you can decide to outrange his swing timer (which is cheese tactics by my book).
---
Anyway, as a famous guy once said: *("If you think using evasion against a warrior is useless, then you don't know how to play a Rogue.".)*
---
I want to say I knew this, but I‚Äôm starting to wonder if i did?!
---
Better level every class to 60 twice, just in case
---
Don't you belittle our brave heroes fighting for freedom by killing children and mothers!
---
What? There‚Äôs a cellar there? Lmao
---
Truly, should be executed....in game of course
---
I think the first few phases should come out a little quicker anyway and as more phases release the gap between them should grow.
---
There's not much to do for some players at the moment, as more phases come out and there's more to do I see no reason why the releases can't be spread out more.
---
Imagine in 2019 thinking that one side is better than the other one ..
---
Alliance ..
---
Oh cool, the next layering conspiracy.
---
What was he protective of?
---
Haha #no changes
---
So whats the problem with that?
---
No keybinds, pet on defensive, leveling as marksmanship. Jesus
---
That's part of the issue, are you sure you're good enough to be that 1/40 druid player rather than just being a 1/8 priest?
---
Pop your intimidating shout. Then, when they WOTF out of it, use disarm or retaliate and you‚Äôll be good.
---
Not sure how people can claim they play 4-5 hours a day and barley even hit the 40 mark. Feels like we got a new tier of casuals these days . People are saying that they shouldnt cater to the 1% of players, but man there are alot of people hitting 60 and starting to clear 60 content that would be considered casual aswell, take myself for instance: Im working a fulltime job 40-50hrs a week, I got a girlfriend that i spend time with almost everyday, i hit the gym 5-6 days a week for a couple of hours and Im going to almost every football game my team plays home and away, yet somehow i managed to get to 60 last week,and i  already got some prebis, cleared most of MC and almost finished my Ony attune. This is not catering to the top 1% this i catering to the active players and not catering to the supercasuals. The problem with retail is that they cater to the supercasuals and that is what has killed it.
---
Had Dire Maul been released any later, a lot of raiders would never have experienced it as MC/Ony along with other dungeon pre-bis is better for most classes.
---
I'm happy about this as it's another dungeon to add to the rotation. Honestly don't understand the ferocity of the criticism.
---
Nah
---
What kind of bitterness is this lol
---
it‚Äòs not cl-ass-y! get it? ba-dum-tsss! 
---
i show myself out.
---
I'm in the same boat. Only level 36, and I've been playing when I had the oportunity, which is not very often. With so many level 60 all ready, I often wonder how they have so much free time.
---
on a somewhat related note, and with the risk of getting down-voted a lot. Some of these comments are really off putting and only re-affirms why I usually don't venture into this sub-reddit, the attitude can quite quickly become hostile sometimes.
---
wars have how many charges? I want to know exactly. I know they have a charge they cant use in battle and then intercept. they have another?!
---
Aint happening. Half of my server is already lvl 60. Those zombies aint going nowhere
---
can you have him as a pet? I don't think I ever saw a hunter with a crocolisk
---
&gt;The Overpower cannot be blocked, dodged or parried.
---
Misses.
---
Dude says "Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age." in a post match interview

Do you even know what propaganda is?
---
Liberate hong kong
---
Lol not gonna get up there bc of all the Hong Kong shit
---
DM was announced for P2 and getting pushed and the fear is that more content will be pushed = faster to naxx and end of content then intended
---
PvE will come die off for hardcores, then semi-harcore and then casuals when there is no more content to do
---
The faster you release patches to faster you come to the end of the content
---
Have you ever fought a demon hunter? If you don't like evasion then get ready for the ability that does the most damage and makes the DH evade all attacks during its animation....
---
And that's fine. My friend also prefers PvE. I myself suck at world pvp but I love it. Love the thrill of hunting and being hunted, negotiating an uneasy truce between random people from the other faction.
---
This is why you should never let people stupider than you dictate who gets loot.
---
Or it's because they'd planned on having P2 out already but they can't because the game's way more popular than expected and some servers are still layered.
---
That state of mind is what led us to LFR!   
---
Demanding from Blizzard and the community to slow down to your pace because you want to clear the content when it's "relevant" is really selfish.
---
As someone else mentioned in the comment section, the good thing about Classic, is that a raid tier NEVER gets irrelevant... So chill, take your time leveling, experience the game and you will clear the content at your pace. Stop trying to convince others that enjoy a certain pace to follow yours. That's retail.-
---
Will people get banned for breaking TOS? Probably. Pretty sure it happens already
---
Personally i'd be fine with them breaking the gold farming aspect, and reorganising the loot drops in the high end dungeon so they are better spread out.
---
Literally Hi- wait wrong sub

I'm going to presume you're being intentionally obtuse.
---
Honor and BGs is what I'm waiting for. I'm not even particularly PVP inclined, but the bonuses you get for doing what we're doing already is pretty great. The raids can wait, but killing horde cannot!
---
He's just a pervert who found a way to ride the hype and get his name out there. He was fired from blizzard and has ran several other projects into the ground.
---
Hehe, i like both but the roleplayer deep inside me had to go purple because it felt more arcane and mage-like ;)
---
The orc racial is only for axes so you get nothing on sword. But since the 5 extra skill gives around 1% extra hit we could assume Obsidian gives around 1.50% ish with +8 2h skill.
---
It's more for humans if you want to min max with it.
---
6%
---
You can! But they make an annoying sound when they walk, haha
---
I find that if you aren't set in stone as to where you should quest, you can simply look at your map(with questie addon) and just go to the zone with the most quests around your level. Everything turn organge? Swap zones. No yellow quests in ANY zone? check again, there definitely is. Still no yellow quests? Grind a dungeon for 1-3 levels.
---
It's also good to leave a zone and come back to it later, something I didn't do back in the day. I try to save my hearthstone for this, not the 5 quests done and hs back to town, as that saves minimal amounts of time compared to going from STV to Desolace with a HS.
---
Also use Mages for portals when in major cities, remember to tip. This has saved me a lot of time.
---
I don‚Äôt get how this guy damaged Blizzard‚Äôs image? What he did had nothing to do with them.
---
I literally cannot get a group. Work nights and weekends. So midweek I'm looking to run some ZF/Ulda/RFD... and I've found nothing. 1 or 2 groups and no response. Back to solo quest grinding. Ugggghh
---
My adult life is heavily intruding on my attempt to recreate the past. Peopl say it gets better post-50 with the zerg still running Mara, BRD, BRS/etc.
---
...but I feel like I've missed the boat and it's solo city here on out.
---
This was specifically aimed at the druid claiming that this pull is tankable. No single tank in game would be able to keep aggro on that many mobs, not even a paladin ^^
---
Yes?
---
**THEY'RE NOT CROCODILES REEEE!**
---
If one's objective when running dungeons is to farm their pre-raid bis gear, DM does massively reduce the amount of time that certain classes will be incentivised to spend running non-DM dungeons. Healers probably get the worst of it. To use shamans as an example, this is where their pre bis is found in a post-DM world:
---
Head: DM
---
Neck: Strat UD or UBRS
---
Shoulder: Crafted
---
Cloak: DM recipe
---
Chest: Strat UD
---
Bracer: Scholo
---
Gloves: DM
---
Waist: DM
---
Legs: DM
---
Boots: DM or Strat UD
---
Rings: In dreams/LBRS (although DM East brings a viable non-unique alternative)
---
Trinkets: DM and DM.
---
MH: BRD
---
OH: DM
---
Asides from that, DM healing gear is incredibly strong for non-raid loot. It's like giving all your shamans steroids. MC is already quite a lot easier than most people remember and pugs full of green machines have been clearing it for weeks. The early addition of DM is just going to make an easy raid even easier. I'm personally pretty happy that it's coming sooner than expected, but I understand the viewpoint of someone who's only just approaching 60. Now if this were ZG, that'd be another story. ZG kills pre-bis farming altogether.
---
Grats my dude!
---
Not just, I had probably 3 days of that playtime from my week off.
---
Spreading out 6 days playtime ontop of that isnt difficult in over a month.
---
They want to release p2 but can't because layering still.   Dm isn't early, everything else in p2 is late.
---
How about those whelps without hearts? got the fucking pet and made half of lvl 41 before the q item dropped.
---
"Random"?! Show some respect to the greatest fisherman in Azeroth
---
Man classic style PvP videos is the one thing I looked most forward.
---
I've been buying a few things here and there and just vendoring them for an instant few silver bonus lol
---
This should be illegal.
---
I'm also interested in this.
---
I use Classic Codex, also without that feature
---
A lot of the casuals already quit
---
&gt;Even shitty pseudo-MMOs like GW2
---
GW2 has a lot of great design in it. I maintain that the Heart of Thorns expac was some of the greatest MMO content I've ever played.
---
The problem is that their content output is slow, and they don't finish what they start, so there's a lot of unpolished bullshit that clearly has potential if they'd just finish it. Regardless of that, for a long time I preferred it to retail WoW for a lot of the same reasons that I like classic.
---
The world felt alive, there were no flying mounts, old content wasn't completely irrelevant, and the map design encouraged players to play together. And I think that map metas, or events like the Tequatl fight, are an unexploited narrative device in the MMO genre, and the solution to the "epic hero character" story which everyone chokes down. You know, the thing that's antithetical to the whole premise of an MMO - where you're one of many. Of course, GW2 does that too. But it shouldn't. It stumbled upon genius and then left it behind - which it does too often.
---
Sadly, the game is in such a bad state right now, and the pop is spread so thin over all the maps that I can't recommend playing it. I think it was perfect just before the release of Path of Fire. The pop was distributed well, and I rarely saw a meta go unaccomplished. These days there's a lot of FUD - and not without good reason.
---
ironically, one of the reasons WoW did so well on launch was because it absolutely was solo/casual friendly compared to the other MMOs around at the time. you had hardcore players calling it the baby MMO on launch
---
Correct,Context is important, but I disagree with shit "just" happens. Sometime people mess up and as a result shit happens.
---
What I am saying, don't group up with people that routinely mess up.
---
Mages are truly the new huntards
---
If he's behaving like that towards you, just imagine what he's like with other people. Are you respected by the guild members or friends with any of them? Go snatch up the core group and make your own guild, you seem like you've got what it takes.
---
I was addressing the irony in that one statement alone.. I specifically picked that one piece of the GMs response. Of course I read the whole thing. Nothing I said was contradicted by the line about ‚Äòdisruption‚Äô.
---
Either way, Blizzard is shit for taking the side of their mobile game powerhouse. 
---
Also, would you care to elaborate about being anti-politics when it comes to video games? Video games themselves are inherently very political, especially in an MMO environment where people try to identify with their character. 
---
If someone was spamming chat, or harassing people; then maybe that would be considerable disruption. People naming themselves after something, most likely meme-ing? You‚Äôre just being sour and probably shouldn‚Äôt be playing.
---
So this be that china white they referring to then.
---
Healers can't save you if you literally die in the span of a gcd.
---
after a certain amount of time they leave banished state and will attack you, though. They remain unkillable.
---
If you boycott every piece of music, art, game, movie or restaurant based on the actions of the creator then your life will be pretty dull. People who also say they won‚Äôt use any company that has involvement with Chinese government or corporations is also in for a surprise when they see just how many that really is. Having said that you should absolutely do what you believe in, but don‚Äôt just talk the talk, walk the walk and stick to your guns.

Wrath saw growth and a plateau.  Cata was when subs started dropping.

Well i much rather have +150 spell damage like i roughly have at the moment which make about 30% more dmg then having +1000 mana which needs to be filled up again while sitting 10-15 seconds longer. I take spell damage over int/spirit/stamina.

Our guild has too many, one is full feral spec tank for MC, we have 2 more dedicated healers, a HOTW ns tanking fights where we need another tank and mainly healing, and we had one switch to balance spec!

Didn't they reach ATH subs during wotlk?

Just release one Battleground and PvP. This will give unlimmited new excitement, while not giving people new raid gear
---
I quit because I have not sufficient time to run classic with this speed. Also #HongKong
---
Gross.
---
Bad advice. Go look for quest items and dungeon drops for weapons, because it really matters and buying anything even half comparable to blues for your level (meaning blue BoEs) will cost an arm and a leg.
---
But you can get great deals on massive upgrades for well less than 1g for most armour slots because of professions.
---
This is insane. Blizzard, of all companies. Sorry, blizzard, I‚Äôve loved some of your games, but they‚Äôre not worth this. I‚Äôm done handing you my money, I‚Äôm done giving you free advertising. You fucked up.
---
We're talking 8 days 7hours. But would probably be a little less if i rushed it instead of chilling!

I found a thread now which says its actually is 5.7% since the first 5 skill is the strong part. The 3 extra sword skill from OEB reduces glancing a tiny bit more

See a patrol about to collide into your already struggling fight? Throw a distraction at them to give your group a few seconds.

There are still tons of "normal" players around. The launch has been a while and I am only 35 on my Warrior but even at night the low level questing zones are quite populated by similar people.

How do you get to 60 so quickly??
---
Gonna do it a couple times today probably but no more. Huge powerspike if i cam get it so it can carry me till i get riposte; currently 22 and a half.
---
It's edited to be entertaining. Looking through comments here people got used to boring arena pillar cuddling pvp videos over the years and have forgotten how entertaining old school pvp videos were. I hope they find a return with classic now.
---
Good! Have fun :)
---
It has always annoyed me that every creature in the game can block.
---
You know, except bear druids.
---
What does that have to do with taking a screenshot?
---
/gquit and find a new guild. That guy is an ass. Perhaps speak with other members of the guild and suggest getting together and forming your own guild without that asshat. Sounds like this clown has gambling issues.
---
This is posted multiple times a week
---
People are still doing dungeons and guilds will always have people trying to get necessary classes caught up and geared. You'll be fine.
---
Lmao, most people aren't 60 yet xD
---
If a dps is an idiot, don't try to make up for them.
---
Let them die.
---
As long as the healer doesn't have threat don't worry.
---
Take the LoL approach, ignore anyone who is an asshat and don't let them get to you.
---
Too many people have bad days irl and feel entitled to take it out on others-fuck those people
---
Yeah, and then she left me for playing too much wow...
---
too bad everybody knows about this and its camped to fuck
---
I can never unsee this...
---
I'm still lvl 26, I can play 1 hour a day or get no sleep and get up early in the morning like a zombie.
---
Do the Screecher spirits quest line starting in steamwheedle port in Tanaris, do Hinterlands normals, elites (Jintha'alor) and get dungeon quests. Mara quest runs are nice around 48ish, around 49/50 searing gorge is nice and then you can head to Blasted lands as well (as long as the zone is not overcrowded).
---
You will likely be 51 or close after finishing, head to Sunken Temple and follow up with Un'goro after - waaay smoother than heading there sub-50. You get the option of starting out BRD first half around 52, then some Felwood/azshara and eventually WPL / Winterspring and EPL. Full BRD around 55ish and endgame stuff from 58 onward.
---
Tell that to Barron geddon....
---
Classic is great and I'm also a bit worried that the content update will progress too fast. So thank you for this post, it is right up my alley. My main is now 42, although I'm one of those players that just can't decide which class to play so I split my time between many alts. 
---
I hope that blizzard is aware, that their target consumer group in classic is different than in retail, have families and other responsibilities and the game is not their only highlight of a day, and adjust their content schedule accordingly. I don't wan't to be left behind just because i'm not playing the game like an addict.
---
Not true for my guild tonight :) We run a dkp addon that currently causes the game to freeze/lag when it updates bids. Then this week we try split raids and one raids looting is impacting the other group in the middle of fights lol. It pushes the updates cross the guild roster I guess. Our team lagged due to the other team looting right as we pull the 3rd to last mc boss, what a spectacular wipe.
---
Intellect = spell crit chance (59.5 = 1% crit) and more mana.
---
Awesome dude, good job!!
---
How is he a judgmental piece of shit wtf
---
Calling everyone with a red shirt. Get your ass to that convention!
---
You can use database searches. Sort by type of item and level required. Not so fancy, beacause it don't show exact drop area and mob, but you can made map on your own with this link:
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?items=12&amp;filter=minrl=2;#0+5+1](https://classicdb.ch/?items=12&amp;filter=minrl=2;#0+5+1)
---
together with dire maul release came the itemization upgrade (catch-up mechanic) which basically makes you skip the first raids (MC/Onyxia/BWL) as the blue items are equal or better than the epics in these select raids.
---
Thanks. But I feel very vacated already and would rather like to start playing.  
---
At first I was hesitant because 12‚Ç¨ a month is a hefty price and I am gone for like half the year but eventually I wanna come back!
---
Yeah someone kicking a can down the road is still accomplishing more than someone laying in bed all day, but they‚Äôre still both accomplishing nothing.
---
Telling some one they ‚Äúprobably shouldn‚Äôt be playing‚Äù is technically violating rule 2 for gate keeping. Telling someone to go back to retail/shouldn‚Äôt be playing the game as a way to dismiss their point.
---
I‚Äôm sorry Blizz doesn‚Äôt classify ‚Äúdisruptive‚Äù the same way you do.  I know they frequently have GM support positions open, you might be able to make a change if you work for them
---
It shows where all types of Nodes can spawn yes. It works great with Find Ore or Find Herb active. Maybe you can set something up to toggle between them so you can see both at close to the same time.
---
Good job!
---
U converted Coinbag to Canadian.
---
Seems like a very nice guy
---
The hunter will replace this inside the same instance with an item that has a 50% drop chance. Denying a +hit chance from dual wielders to give a hunter a 3 dps boost for like 2 weeks tops is VERY bad guild management.
---
~A hunter.
---
Easiest way is to find a high level mob and spam hamstring
---
The druid in the pic only has 2300 armor or so. Granted, he has broken pieces, but leather pieces do not have that much armor compared to plate. Im already hitting 6300 armor. When I get more items including pre raid bis and DM drops, it will be much higher. I also gain 10% more efficiency. Warrior has plenty of tools in their kit to generate threat. I can stance swap, go berserkers, I generate 10% threat in def alone and have revenge and sunder and interrupts. Including battle shout and sunder which help all the damage of physical users. A druid tank just wont be able to to match a warrior. Thats why youre gonna see them as most tank and MT in raids
---
Nice Panda! I picked Panda on my very first WoW Char. I got myself Mini Diablo this time aroung, though. :)
---
What do you mean? I would rather not want to respec and save that coin.
---
How is it any different if the money ends up in the same coffers of the oppressors? 
---
Is it because it's easier to boycott Blizzard than to give up many of the modern conveniences that chinese companies provide?
---
Warbears woolies are kinda close?
---
Care, these brave souls tend to get tainted and go hollow, by losing their memories ever so slightly.
---
They are cursed to be slain and to revive, rendering them basically undying. With every awakening, their memory slips into darkness. 
---
I'd stay away from that thing!
---
You animal.
---
i did not read the post and ppl are answered exactly what I'm doing it but: Dire Maul is not a big deal. it was released less than 1 month after the game was released in Europe.
---
also, pushing dire maul BEFORE pvp is a decision made exactly to help casuals, so you get farm DM before people are perma camping it to farm honor. so if you thing you should be thanking blizzard for this decision.
---
Oh shit, here we go again.
---
Probably a group think decision, all too big of cowards to even suggest anything besides this.
---
Who cares if you don't experience all the content on release? That's normal. Naxx can be out and you can start in MC and work your way up. That's how it worked. So just because they release BWL for example and you're level 30, that shouldn't be a problem for you. You haven't "missed" MC.
---
Ya, I could‚Äôve been less of a know-it-all that doesn‚Äôt know it all. My bad too, homie. Your advise is spot on.
---
We gots to get payed.
---
That's pretty cool! Does it drop for both Horde and Alliance?
---
I mean personally I don't care about this too much since I expect companies to behave this way... but where is the fake news?
---
Do you just use 'fake news!' as a word for "news I don't agree with" now like Donnie does?
---
Then don‚Äôt join the raid.
---
they're op from vanilla and that's a facc
---
I mean that‚Äôs pretty nonsensical. They still put in the /played, and are at 20+ days right now. Are you? Is joe the plumber? Just because (some? Not all or even many, and I honestly don‚Äôt think dungeon spamming is necessarily better but I digress) they put in their time doing it that way, why is that any different from the questing or straight grinding you do? I‚Äôve taken my time, leveled professions, quested, ran every dungeon at least once, grinded out basically 48-54.  I never got the bashing of people who managed to get there quickly because they found an efficient way. When I‚Äôm smashing ogres at 40k exp an hour at lvl 48 is that treating it like classic?
---
Actually thats not how probability calculations are done, so it does not. You would need several hundred runs before the likelihood of getting a 1% drop exceeded even 70%.
---
Specifically name what you're trying to accuse me of, asshole.
---
&gt;Also, would you care to elaborate about being anti-politics when it comes to video games? Video games themselves are inherently very political, especially in an MMO environment where people try to identify with their character. 
---
If I had to guess I'd say "No politics in guild chat." is on of the most common guild rules in use over the past couple of years. People generally aren't playing games to talk current events or be trolled.
---
I retract that statement, they are privately owned and they are entitled to their beliefs. I simply do not support them.
---
Did you know wow backwards is wow?
---
id like to see that too, just to see how badly it will fail
---
Chinese companies all answer to the government because they HAVE to the government controls everything there and companies owned by China or who have big share holders in China have to appease the government if they want to keep doing business with them. You support something the gov doesn‚Äôt like openly, that‚Äôs it your banned no more business in China.
---
Wait for level 40. You will get Wirlwind at 36 and Mortal Strike at 40. Before that your best ability is Heroic Strike.
---
What I'm about to suggest is totally untested so take it with a grain of salt, but this macro works:
---
&gt; /castsequence reset=2 Lightning Shield, Windfury Weapon 
---
that 'reset=2', I THINK, is a baked in cooldown, as it didn't appear to be keystrokes or counting the number of lightning shield charges I had.
---
If that is the case, you can use the cooldown for ghostly strike there and the macro will work, I think?
---
So, what you are telling me is:
---
Unless i can reach high amounts of crit, spellpower is the way to go as long as i can sustain mana for a reasonable amount of time.
---
Loser
---
The curve right now is literally mid 40- low 50's. If you think it's only the top 1% that are 60 now, or will be in the next month, than your perspective is so warped we can't even have a logical discussion. Their are PLENTY of people that play casually that are 60 now, we're 2 months in. The top 1% has 2+ pre raid BiS lvl 60's at this point. That's the problem with threads like thse. Hyper casual players chime in without knowing the reality of the situation in the first place. No, BWL shouldn't come out in 2 weeks, but we shouldn't be catering to people who won't be in MC for 3 months either.

It‚Äôs blizzards rules so whatever but they are an American company bowing down to the oppressive Chinese government.

It wasn‚Äôt out of line. What‚Äôs out of line is what China is doing to HK and what they have been doing to their people for a long time.

I mean, it's true that some of those thoughts started during Wrath, but that the development mindset with those only really started rearing their teeth towards the end, like dungeon finder came in at 3.3 which was the last major patch, and into Cata.  Plus after Cata they barely designed anything around flight anymore, and designs like that started in BC.
---
So there was still a huge chunk of the expansion that wasn't marred by these decisions and even still the "bad parts" are only at the end when people probably started to take breaks awaiting the new xpac or were otherwise busy raiding ICC, which was a good raid.
---
Found the feral tank.
---
Great post üëçüèª
---
Its the economical changes I'm most worried about though (as someone who's not yet 60, playing a warrior - terrible for gold farming).
---
This will greatly change the market and people who aren't yet 60 and haven't got much gold yet I believe will be hit the hardest.
---
Solo farming DM means certain people will make a ton of $$...
---
To be honest, I STRONGLY feel that the release of Dire Maul, as well as all the 8.3 information fo rretail, is nothing but a PR-Counter-Measurement for the PR-Shitstorm they've taken on by firing the two Hongkonger Shoutcasters after what the Pro said on Stream...
---
There just is NO WAY that all of this wasn't intended as BlizzCon News...
---
This is becoming such a cringeworthy statement. 99% of mages I‚Äôve met at level 60 have been decent players and decent people - the same as any other class.
---
First world it isn‚Äôt
---
Well put. Have an upvote.
---
I agree with the DM and with your reasoning. Although I'm more on the side that it indeed can be a "red flag" to future progression speed, you make great arguments to convince me otherwise.
---
And so far, I've been nothing nut happy with Classic, so I think it will be fine.
---
Yeah, and if your just following orders it's all fine too, no need to make a stand ever. Finally someone who gets it!
---
&gt;mproved healing touch, reflection, and tranquil spirit are all good for healing. 11 points in balance only really gives you 10% increased damage. omen of clarity isnt that great
---
care to elaborate on the OoC statement?
---
blow it out your ass, the chinese regime is a terrorist state
---
lol just stop. its easier because the game is easy. items like diana pearl necklace and drak caster dps helm are not even in game. don't try to make it seem vanilla was difficult because it wasn't. it was just a fresh game that people didn't knew how to play, period.
---
What does it mean?
---
Thank you for seeing the european point of view, yesterday I saw a comment by an american Wow player stating that 'europeans got a worse experience', fucking hell lol

Did I formulate that wrong? I would like some tips? :&lt;

Count me among the unsubbed. "And my axe!"

The GM chooses who gets in which raid, so he can tamper with the outcome of the bets. And he forces you to make a bet.  
---
In my reading it's more like a tax, because what stops the gm to group up his buddies with the best players from the guild, and collecting 20g from the other group?
---
Just charge and intercept. Charge in battle stance and out of combat, gives rage. Intercept in berserker stance, costs rage.

Gee buddy, you sure are a great guy. Real service to the community you're doing there

Yeah, Druids are super underplayed and there's a huge shortage at 60 atm. You can walk into a raid group and have zero competition for a lot of pieces.
---
Not gonna lie - they had us in the first half..
---
Wait hold on... you're telling me it's possible to use one spec [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zZxtMscMdLVxsoxo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zZxtMscMdLVxsoxo) and tank fine, heal fine, dps fine, all at 60?  How did you find levelling, I'm levelling a hunter at the moment and loving the speed but I feel come 60 my dungeon life may be a bit painful. As a serial re-roller/altaholic, should I copy you and be a druid??

---
check out this pre-raid BiS list, as you can see for damage, you're trying to just stack frost/spell damage.
---
Don't you get it? Casual players aren't meant to be on an equal footing with tryhard players. That's why retail feels so hollow and you have a sense of purpose in classic.
---
This isn't retail. There aren't item levels. When diremaul comes out you will still want to do BRD. When BWL comes out people will still do MC.
---
What's bad about this? How does this affect classic? 
---
Why is there such a blatant disregard for Chinese culture? Would you Americans find it acceptable if someone from China comes barging in bashing jews, blacks and so on? No you don't find that acceptable and in such cases money is also not given and people get fired over that in the west. In similar fashion the Chinese do not like having their leadership and authority trampled upon.

How are you not stealing the recipe if you deny their winning roll?

Fucking Christ, how much of an insufferable lard-ass can you be? Your first response was a fail at saying that I missed details, yet here you are clinging to this one line I left at the end of my response. You‚Äôre also under the impression that just because a company has a certain policy, that policy is somehow right (?) Or at least you shill Blizzard enough to believe that any dissonance should be halted. I really fail to understand people like you..
---
I will disagree with that a bit (last part). I started with a warlock, got him to lvl 42 then started my tauren warrior. I have never played wow before this (or much of other mmos) 
---
The people are really nice and accept that I don't always do perfectly when tanking dungeons.
---
Can tell you've literally never played Vanilla, this is false.
---
People will be clearing MC and Ony for a LONG time, Rag drops the best 2H wep in the game for warriors, it's usable even during Naxx so...
---
Aren't they effectively stealing it then?  That is a ninja....
---
And an erection.
---
Was a PUG so kinda fair to be FFA.
---
Point of clarification: this is not a ninja.
---
It doesn't miss.
---
My guess is to see if new content creates a surge and if these surges would require layering to return ir if the single layer servers can remain stable.
---
noone sends you mail when you undercut one item XD
---
I just checked and for me it just makes it so I don't need 5 items from BRD, only 1, the other 4 are from DM now.
---
So it turns running BRD FOREVER into running BRD for one item and running DM less-than-forever.
---
&gt;I know this probably won't get much attention
---
So that was a fucking lie
---
I might be one of the few that would like a influx of gold into the economy. Right now im having loads of fun just playing the AH, and more Gold for farmers means more gold i can leech off them wihout moving my butt out of thunder bluff ...
---
Yes, the curve is where you say. Which means just about or slightly above the half way point. After 2 months. So give it another month or two for the majority to reach 60 and then a few weeks before adding additional content. Which would be towards the end of the year, not next week.
---
Players that are at level 60 for so long they already ran out of content and desperately need new stuff are the minority. Maybe its not 1%, but it isn't a large enough player base that blizzard should plan their schedule around them.
---
[That's no moon. It's a space station](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Nho44lGVV8).
---
The point is, I had no aggro issues after the bump to 500%. Before that, it was fun for Warlocks to draw aggro using Searing Pain (which, for whatever reason, was designed to generate 100% extra threat. It even mentioned the threat generation in the tooltip) just to pull off your target. Trolls trying to be disruptive to the dungeon.
---
I really don't understand why you think any of this is a good cool story. 
---
You were "bored" so you thought "I know, I'll act like an utter scumbag to people who aren't bored playing the game at a lower level." And then they joined together to defeat their "mighty" foe and everyone happily after? If you were bored try helping low levels through dungeons or play something else for a while instead of ruining other people's day. 
---
You are the exact reason I don't play anymore. I hope you grow up you unnecessary griefing piece of trash. Take a hard look at yourself.
---
Tough at level 22 tho.
---
I used quest guides in vanilla tho. Then when good quest addons started coming out (end of vanilla/in tbc?) I started using those. Idk I don't think the experience worsens.
---
They cleared mc and onyxia the week after. The first thing you can do is attunements
---
But you are not the Main heal so innervate normally goes to a priest in long raid fights
---
Curious question, what happens if a druid equips: https://classicdb.ch/?item=18537

Slow people wanting them to stop content they can‚Äôt access, typical

You didn't even have to that necessarily just to "High ( Layered )" or "Full ( Layered )" in brackets behind and replace the current text with. Both values in there without changing the preexisting layout of the columns which could be problematic because of set width of the login window or other restrictions.
---
Solo pvp around your own level as a warrior.... That's just horrible unless you wait 30min after each gank for recklessness CD.
---
reported him and it removed it unfortunately
---
Are alterac and arathi really the same level?
---
I‚Äôm deciding where to go to as a lvl 39 horde and want it to be one of those I think :)
---
305 means you don‚Äôt get the hit penalty(1%) against boss lvl monsters and it also gives 0,4% hit per point up to 305 which drops of after that.

New offspec: On-hit mage
---
I‚Äôve been playing pretty casual since launch, as I‚Äôm a single father. Honestly I want ALL the content there. The way I see it, when I finally do catch up and want to run the content, everyone else will already be pretty well geared. This makes clearing it that much easier for me. This content will never be over done and dry as it‚Äôs always been there. We all know what to expect. We all wanted classic for this content. I think the plan they have now is perfect. It highly resembles every 0‚Äùprogression server ever releases for any mmo. The entire point of classic was to have all the classic content. Why complain about it rolling out too soon? It‚Äôs literally not going anywhere. Also I‚Äôm only level 30 and I‚Äôm content with my pace.
---
Yeah but you can use both?

I got flak from my friends not having rebind them... Obviously I use the mouse I just don't need the keys

Do you hamstring kite when he isn't slowing you? Do you switch to Def for shield bash? Intercept to interrupt? Intimidating shout and bandage? Try not to forget rend pre ms/ww. Especially if you can kite him a lil. It's all damage!

As the priest I hoped for the robes, would be poggers
---
Unfortunately nothing. Because we don't know parry, increasing our chance to do so would not change that.
---
People in here should use [Classic.wowhead.com](https://Classic.wowhead.com) more to check up on drops etc. F.x. Hand of Justice doesn't drop from emperor but from angerforge.   
---
But as people write, the archmages doesnt drop it until 2.0 and you will need to farm the 4 x spellbinders that exist in the northern part of WPL on the way to Hearthglen.
---
He is horde.
---
What was your main income? I had around 500g when I dinged 60 and then farmed elemental fire (2g each) in around 20 hours playtime to get my epic mount. Now elemental fire is around 2,4g so I "lost" around 80g.
---
If you don't take damage you shouldn't be taken out of stealth, but I could be wrong.
---
It looks like the [Pristine Yeti Hide](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=7735/pristine-yeti-hide) from Feralas isn't limited to once per character. I did not know this.
---
As if anyone playing Classic ever loads up Retail.
---
&gt;  So give it another month or two for the majority to reach 60
---
If the curve is 50 and you think it's another month to 60 than again, your perspective is so warped than we can't have a logical discussion.
---
My thumb has the required dexterity, and I never have to switch super 
---
Now, the guy above was talking about using the Numpad.
---
I am interested to know how you reach the modifiers, though, with your pinky?
---
Yea, all the people bragging about how soon they got to lvl 60 and complaining about this post just really don't have a life.. probably why they're so bitter.
---
Humans have decent proportions for it imo. Night Elf men are a bit too big and Gnomes and Dwarves are way too small.
---
IMO, this is a delicate subject. Faster paced releases will keep the hype up as streamers that have a big audience will further push into the content and make people eager to follow their example which may/might result in more subscriptions, players joining. However as you stated, playing slower means slower progression equals longer subscriptions to reach 60 and end-game content. 
---
I'm with you, I'm in the same boat, with RL and work and sports I often only have the morning to play, weekends I rarely log in. But I kind of understand why they fast pace the releases, as it will keep the players busy with content.
---
I however see another issue coming, with how "easy" the end-game content is for us today, it might become stale rather quickly, I slowly started to change my mind about the NoChanges, maybe a Classic+ with harder versions of the classic content and slighlty stat modified gear could fix this potential issue?
---
It's just food for thought, great post, take my upvote.
---
If you don't want to bother with addons, I used a simple macro that I just bound to an extra mouse button:
---
/castsequence Find Herbs, Find Minerals

Well you can ignore it, up until the point they arrest you. Then you have to pay with your time.

Yes...in game.

Oof

nope, that's not how it works.
---
You get a hit penalty if the difference between your weapon skill and the target's defence skill is more than 10.
---
Any weapon skill past 305 has no effect on hit chance, only your glancing blow damage which is capped at 95% of your regular damage at 308.
---
Was it a need roll on  a shield  by a priest? Damn
---
Orange Man Bad.
---
be a real man, and dont post on blizzard related subs and  sites as well.
---
k thx bye
---
Already did. I am not a fan of blindly copying things so I wanted to figure out something myself.  
---
Thanks for the links will look at them.
---
I'm kind of in the same boat, I played female orc rogue because of how good they looked in gear, but by the time i got to lvl 24 I was so annoyed by the awkward running and stealth animations. I rerolled to male undead rogue but I'm considering rerolling again to female undead because of their awesome flip and running animation
---
The insane cold blood evus that always misses ;/
---
It's because the system won't let you 'accidentally' flag yourself by helping/buffing someone who is flagged by using AoE buffs/heals. 
---
A shamam who isn't flagged drops his totems - those totems won't trigger for the flagged player. Same for chain heal. Group buffs (arcane int, gift of the wild, paladin blessings) all operate this way. You have to deliberately target a flagged player then cast your ability, and now you're flagged too. 
---
It's annoying because you can't do your job. And if you flag, then you have the opposite problem for those still not flagged. And then you have to remember to un-flag when you leave the instance. 
---
Or you have to stop the dungeon run, have everyone flag on, then flag off &amp; hope everyone's 5 min timer is in sync &amp; didn't get retriggered.
---
So it really just comes down to buffs not hitting everyone, and possibly being flagged coming out of a dungeon when you're not used to that status.
---
yikes
---
Play on a pve server. If you don't like it you have the possibility to completely avoid it.
---
I fucken love how they did this with winter Arathi Basin in retail. Not seeing enemies until they're close to you emerging from a blizzard changes the feel so much
---
/u/Luit__Froops and /u/Bago-2017 too.
---
@cursor does not do what you just described. You're talking about @mouseover. @cursor is for removing the green targeting circle for ground targeted spells like Blizzard and Rain of Fire, instead placing it immediately down where your mouse cursor is pointed.
---
Mark of the chosen uses the same model.
---
Thanks for that input. Very helpful.

Whats your guildys name?
---
Penilla was characterized by random 36 noob hunter running around IF and looking at a dude in full epics and going OMG thats coolople who can only play in sporatic short spurts are also not as influenced by raid releases since realistically they wont be doing AQ40/Naxx and maybe not even BWL depending on the PUG scene.  The future releases will only help them close the gap a little with ZG/AQ20 gear maybe.  Va

And you rolled a 69 nice
---
Three types of players in Azeroth*
---
Well, true. Just that playing an Affliction lock I don't really use any of those spells besides Siphon and Shadow Bolt, and the way I see Siphon working is it's draining their inner life force, which should leave the outer parts intact. Shadow Bolt is a weird one, like what a blast of shadow would actually do?  
---
The fire spells are a no-brainer of course, it's literal fire as you said.
---
fuck transmog
---
the correct term should be IMBA
---
No. People that expect certain rules or etiquettes on the AH market are the worst.
---
People undercutting means a more competitive market overall and therefore better prices for the buyers overall.
---
Yes its not classsic anymore plp want money way to much and need on All the items there give 10g ore more

Do you live in cave? all aspects of technology evolve at an extremely exponential rate, it's not about how mainstream something is back then, it's about how much MORE mainstream it is now.

Personally I don't really think flying mounts had that much impact but I would really like to try TBC without it.

If you are from Europe I would love to level with you on Flamelash as horde. I have plenty of friends playing with me that would also love playing with you for that matter :)
---
My in game name is Underscore (35 priest)
---
Don't you have this 30min CD that Counters all attacks? Shouldn't you be able to kill a rogue that way?
---
Also - why is a class the most overpowered when it wins against you? I mean Mages can kill Rogues. Aren't they more overpowered by you analogy? :D
---
Just because it Counters you doesn't make it the strongest.... Though you are probably right

I play 12hrs sometimes and feel like all I did was go back and forth between 3 zones

A lot of Warcraft was inspired by D&amp;D (particularly the Dragonlance setting) and Paladins having their own holy steed was one of those things I would guess comes from D&amp;D, in addition to Lay on Hands.

Someone tldr this pls ü§£

Well...I mean really ?

I can't tell if you're serious?

The service OP is selling is dungeon boosts. The guy didn't pay for it, after agreeing to pay for it. That's as much as I can connect the dots.

Oh and only a few fury prot warriors are actually good ones :)
---
Dodging means more life to chain mobs and also critics will proc Flurry. More you proc Flurry and more you will proc windfury.

You cannot be full strength with leather stuff anyway, so agi&gt;=strength is something really important for leveling. Shaman ENH is based on proc so make sure to give as much luck as possible :p

There was already no aggro issue for the most part after Wrath tripled tank's threat generation. Coming from Vanilla and BC, Wrath tanking was a total bore. Threat in general is a icky mechanic for Blizzard because there's no way for them to balance it out properly. The Vanilla/BC model that kept tanks on their toes resulted in geared DPS being unable to do anything with lower geared tank because a single spell would immediately take aggro. Wrath added the 300% modifier to tanks, but it was undisclosed, though people noticed it immediately (hence nothing aside from the hotfix notes when it went up to 500% mid/late-Cata). Cata was the point where Blizzard wanted to shift tank playstyle over to reactive cooldown usage and active mitigation, starting with Blood Shield for DK
---
&gt;Searing Pain threat
---
Because Blizzard half wanted Warlock to tank. Twin Emps, Illidan, Blood Prince, that weird Glyph in MoP that ended up getting removed. They've flip flopped with that idea for like half a decade
---
Your last reply just shows how clueless and full of BS you are. You prolly are an orc.shaman on your fourties and never played serious 60 pvp content.
---
A level 60 melee geared shaman has around 2k mana at best. It takes 3-4 ES to deplete it, let alone purging or dropping any totem, wich means you face a single target in PVP and youre OOM (meaning you are useless unless you hide and drink). That also means no priest with half a brain will waste dispells or heals on an useless autoattack tryhard.
---
You also have 0 caster stats wich means your heals are also pathetic thus youre absolute 0 support to your warriors other than totems an Ele or Resro shammy can also drop.
---
To sum up:
---
-Your burst is unreliable RNG
---
-No Mortal Strike effect
---
-OOM most of the time
---
-Weak Heals
---
Compared to Ele or Resto:
---
-On demand burst able to kill someone nearly instantly
---
-Can heal
---
-Can purge without going OOM
---
-Can kite
---
Do yourself a favor and stop watching Unbreakanle videos
---
I'd not use striker mark as a hunter, it will be replaced very fast with Rhok'delar and its attack speed is bad.
---
I would say go for it my man. I was 15 years old playing back in the day, now 30. I still love it. Unfortunately, I am suspended from chat at the moment, because I voiced my opinion about supporting the Hong Kong protesters, and I don't feel like questing solo.
---
also nightfin snappers

1. I don't miss it but I don't care
---
2. I can agree with this but I think it's fine as it is
---
3. hell no, please no, never.

4. I strongly disagree
---
Thats why I sleep in my sons room. :D
---
To raid I have to reach high levels. Maybe I can do raids later. Is raiding must like retail?
---
What classes have BiS lists with only items from DM?  Most I have looked at have maybe \~1/3 of the items from DM with the other 2/3 from the other dungeons.
---
It kind of looks like Trona Pinnacles to me. Also I‚Äôm California.
---
Couldn't you just flag yourself for PvP whilst in the dungeon to avoid this? Not saying it's right, but life is easier without the burdens of anger and hate...
---
I play a warrior. So. I know the pain. If you don't join as the tank, you will be asked and pressured into it inside two minutes of joining.

Niftys Stopwatch

---
You get it after you do three quests where you need to gather items from stone elementals (only the first quest is a pain in the ass, the other ones are rather easy and fast)
---
After that you need to turn in two items, first being a frost oil, second one a gyrochronatom (both can be bought or crafted)
---
These unlock a quest that requires you to kill a lvl 45? elemental after which you get the trinket. 
---
Takes 20-30 minutes after you finished the first quest.
---
m+ is hot garbage imo and I loved the tbc heroics

Some people get all the luck, others get none. It is all rng but some days/weeks it feels like you have a permanent negative luck stat lol.

---
Dire Maul isn't endgame and pretty much every single piece of non-caster gear from there has upgrades in Molten Core. If they wait with adding it then running it at all will be pointless for warriors, rogues, hunters, etc. (outside of gold farming and tribute buffs).
---
I had problems with them until I got an 80% keyboard that has the F keys lined up with the number keys (google choc mini for an idea). Makes them a lot easier to use for me.
---
cause you don't have to have other people involved to kill something for it
---
There's no good reason to use your keyboard to turn your character around, so that frees up A and D. What most people then do is bind those keys to strafe left and right, instead of the default Q and E. So now they have Q and E available to bind to other abilities. You say you don't need those extra keys, but in my opinion that just means you're handicapping yourself.
---
This needs to be fixed, specially if the game is moving onwards towards TBC later on.
---
Shifting into bear form to avoid being mana drained was one of the Druid's strengths in arenas
---
Yeah tabards were Wrath, I really liked that system; earning rep doing the dungeons I liked rather than ones I didn't was ace.
---
I feel as though they should keep pace with the majority if 75% of accounts have a lvl 60 and have been raiding for a certain amount of time move the next phase
---
Hey man, one advice for you: go to Deadwind pass and kill the sky shadows, go in a circle around the area, you should be busy non-stop. Their loot table is pretty nice (trash items vendor for a lot).
---
Let me know how it felt!
---
Yes, but STV is still disgusting for Alliance.
---
&gt;Do you switch to Def for shield bash? 
---
you can shield bash in battle stance.
---
from an eu blizz forum post:
---
1% hit= 10 SP

1% crit = 9 SP

8 int = 1 SP

Don't know if that's correct or not.
---
Hunters don't have the time to pull since they're busy needing on all the items.

---
As a general advise, if you want to deal any kind of damage, look towards shadow. Smite is not cool.
---
I was going to suggest this, I always try to get the lead as tank (doesn't always get it with all these people "reserving" stuff), just in case I need to kick the dps who feels like complaining about the tanking when said dps always drop all his burst immediately after I pull a pack (if he didn't pull it in the first place :p).
---
&gt; Whenever the word casual comes up, people inevitably start to argue about what casual means.

literally never happens.

&gt; In wow I cannot find guilds that are super cool and look after each other.
---
I found my current guild a few days before the launch and have had an awesome time. I scouted through the official forums and some realm discords to find a gulid advertisement that suited my exact needs of a casual raiding guild that helps each other out.
---
Raiding and dungeons are way more fun when you do it with friends! Go searching and hopefully you can find one that fits you :)
---
Personally I play on Gehennas (Alliance), feel free to pm me if you want a link to my guild - not here to just advertise it out lol.
---
Hope you guys uninstalled Steam too. 
---
Oh right you didn't, just this week's outrage. We've had one of these ever since Kony, if not even longer.

Any way to keep the current look of the skill bar with bartender?

I understand and agree with everything you said a hundred percent. I have my own painting company, 3 children where two of them er under age 3, a wife and other adult responsibilities as well. I am currently level 42 and enjoying myself immensely! 
---
I too can worry a bit about what you are saying, about content being pushed too fast. Let's hope they stick to the original plan and dont try to "complete" WoW experience too fast.
---
I thought about something like this, but the problem is that after casting sinister strike once it tries to cast ghost strike again. Then the macro will fail because it is still on cooldown
---
I could no-life a lot with Classic. But that would mean a breakup lol and she would be right, that would mean getting fired and my boss would be right. Given the fact that we're not in school / high school anymore, it's a bit harder to play 30 hours a day. 
---
MMOs are meant to be time consuming, yes, but the game should move with the general player base, not the hardcore player base. And I'm saying this for every MMO, not Classic specifically. The general player base is around level 45-50 right now, maybe a week or two short of 60.
---
WoW saves every setting automatically when you exit the game normally. If it crashes or you alt-f4 out it won't save.
---
yeah undead is literally 50% of all casters or rogues that you come across.
---
&gt;Storm peaks was designed entirely around the player being able to fly, to say nothing of icecrown.
---
Blade Edge Mountains and Netherstorm as well.
---
alliance *is* the pvp faction.
---
What you need OP racials to compete?  Sad.
---
"#nochanges"should also be applied to the original release schedule. Vanilla lasted around 20-24 months.
---
Hunter Question: Can a Pet unlearn it's bilities that I taught him ? a pet has 300 TP at lvl 60 so I am limited in what i am teaching the pet. so can I for example unlear the points that I spent on nature resistance or do I need to tame another pet ?
---
Oh, feel sorry about that situation dude. I did not think Blizzard is that serious about Hong Kong prostest suspends. In other case, I just want to feel that rpg feeling. Want a challenge when I play even 2 hours. I only have two options retail or classic. But retail is like playing skyrim, you always alone in zones, just sitting in cities. So, I will give a chance to classic I guess.
---
I cant even get a group together to show my GF SFK or any of the dungeons I loved and our gear is like bad lol except the few items I've acquired or crafted
---
Same thing happened to me a week ago. I tought it was bartender fucking up  
---
It doesn't do it anymore .. but when it did i just cancel the buff with right clic
---
As a mage I count to 5 before aoeing,  or 3 if single target.
---
I canceled my sub as well. I very much want to keep playing Classic but they don't deserve my money at this point.
---
In the optional message for why I cut my sub, I simply put "I SUPPORT A FREE HONG KONG"
---
Sounds like old-school dkp rules. You bet a number of points, do a /roll equal to the bet, if you win they get subtracted from you and redistributed to the raid, if you lose nothing happens.
---
So why are you in a rush to play the same BGs youve been playing for 15 years?
---
World PvP hasnt existed in nearly 14 years. Ill get off my high horse when you hold yours
---
On behalf of anyone who plays more than 30 minutes a day, please keep up with what you're doing, Blizzard.
---
Yep
---
Can pretty much guarantee MC will be done until the servers die because people will be looking for the legendary drops and people will want to PUG it to gear their alts.  BWL is more likely to be a dead spot due to being a bit more difficulty to pUG and no legendary drops.P
---
But world PvP hasnt really existed in what, 13 years? And it doesnt really exist right now. It will when the honor system releases WITHOUT BGs
---
Charge a fee then
---
You're right about crafted upgrades, but you're wrong about weapons.
---
Good blue levelling weapons are cheap right now. If you're a melee class, it's well worth delaying some skills you don't use much to upgrade your primary weapon.
---
Something like Killmain costs a couple of gold. Enchanting it with +5 costs another gold. And you kill 25% faster.
---
Dude you need to take a look in the mirror and realize that you‚Äôre just casual and that‚Äôs fine.. you‚Äôre getting angry over literally nothing. Level at your own pace and do the content when you get there it‚Äôs that simple. You have this identity confusion of wanting to be hardcore when you just physically don‚Äôt have the time to put in. It‚Äôs making you angry over nothing essentially except your own frustrations at not being hardcore enough to be raiding right now...
---
Mostly I think we just lack any sort of intelligence from people making groups. People need to realize that you do not need a tank for most dungeons. Hell, we ran scholo strat and brd with a leatherwearing 2h warrior in prot stance (sometimes).
---
You only start seeing nasty hits from bosses when you get to last boss in ST and a few in BRD. Everything else can easily be tanked by a rogue or any other class that does not suffer pushback.
---
If you really lack tanks, it is your own fault for not realizing you dont need them.
---
That was released under similar circumstances back then. And DM is just not better than UBRS or Strat. They have no reason not to release it.
---
Wow did it for whitney, that's a name I haven't heard in awhile.
---
Were you even alive back then? I see a lot of young people act as if technology was born in their time. You claimed "gaming, guides, technology and stuff are no where near as popular" but all those are pretty much mainstream in the early 2000s. The console wars were in the late 90s/early 2000s. MMORPG games were all over before WoW came into the market. Quake3, Counterstrike, and Valve were already on the scene. Gaming guides existed before the internet.
---
If you mean computer tech being more ubiquitous compared to 2004, I'd agree with you. Not everyone back then had mobile phones not to mention smartphones. There were still households then that didn't have personal computers. But technology is not limited to computers. Cars, tv, radio, electronics, etc are all technology. We've had technology since men discovered fire.
---
Retail babies, i swear
---
you got me in the first half xD
---
Searing Gorge, Ungoro, Felwood combined will push you to 55 and over. And there is always BRD.
---
I have a macro that prevents it. I use a modifier to cancelaura it. I use it because then I can spam the stealth key and not worry about it cancelling it.
---
At one point they were considering whether Dire Maul should be included in launch lol.
---
&gt;Remember that for everyone that says they cancelled their sub, there's probably 10 more that did it without posting on social media. 
---
Also remember that out of 10 like 5 say it for karma and the other 4 resub a month later. The last dude resubs somewhere down the road.
---
That would be Loda, king of alliance.
---
This would matter if blizzard did not release east mode classic. Other than content dire maul is completely unnecessary in classic wow
---
&gt; For 2-3 mobs,
---
I have an issue with this rotation. 0 extra threat on targets 2 and 3 means that any amount of aoe threat, including any from healing, procs, or buffs, will rip off, since you're waiting until your third gcd to get any threat on X and your fourth gcd for the final enemy.
---
World PvP doesnt really exist right now and hasnt in 13 years. 
---
It does too have everything to do with the other. BGs will be the main way to farm honor.
---
By releasing the honor system WITHOUT BGs, you now have a population full of people PvPing for rank out in the world. This hasnt occured in literally 14 years.
---
That abyss reminds me of wailing caverns.
---
That's on similar timing as in vanilla. And "no life" have hardly anything to get from DM. You're just throwing unneeded and stupid aggression at people that have done nothing to you.
---
A lot of it has to do with player skills, I've seen warriors take on 2 frost mages and win, druid healers kill rogues etc etc, a lot comes down to knowing the class you play and the class you are fighting. Warriors is one of the most demanding classes to master, but when mastered I doubt a lot of players can do anything against them.
---
The game is great but this sub is not
---
I don't know about other "casuals", but for me weekends are usually time when I spend time with my family, go for a trip maybe, do some shopping, do some fun activities with kids, go for a meal etc. Of course, I have free time night time, but even then some fri/sat we have a movie nights with wife.
---
They‚Äôre releasing it because much if the player base is starting to reach this level it is stumbling in the late 40s and they‚Äôre trying to sustain retention and sub numbers
---
You Sir, explained my teenage years perfectly. I agree with you, 100%. Cheers, m8!
---
I highly disagree.
---
Im barely level 30 and i cant wait for them to proceed at a faster pace until the state of the game offers enough alternatives to just raiding.
---
Currently we have two raids, only one full size and only a handful of endgame dungeons.
---
No Honor.
---
No BGs.
---
And the 60 dungeons get boring fast and if you have no interest in raiding, that will just get worse.
---
When they reached the point where most raids, dungeons and PvP BGs are implemented i hope they increase the speed, then they can slow for all i care since then people actually have options.
---
People currently dont even do world PvP and just ignore each other since there is 0 reward in wasting time for it.
---
I also dont have much of a motivation to level since i know once im 60 there wont be much to do for me, with no BGs and no interest in raiding.
---
And im 100% a casual too, i play maybe 5h a week, maybe 10h if i have some free time and some friends are up to play together.
---
40-45 is finishing STV and Desolace + some Badlands quests + Uldaman. At 43-44 you can easily start in Tanaris, compliment it with some Feralas, and once you finish that, it's Hinterlands all the way to 50.
---
Oh Grobbulus.
---
k
---
Gank people 10v1 in BRM and then spam go to retail. Pretty dumb
---
Blizzard, please, listen to this guy here. The mayority of players are not even 60 yet. I've been playing since day one and I'm 37, for Christ's sake.
---
Epic mount imo although I got my devilsaur gear first (as a hunter)
---
As it important as it is to most
---
The only thing that could be faster would be to use Hellfire to aoe down multiple mobs but, speaking of experience here, you'll need a healer with you to do so.
---
&gt; Critting doesn't give you more rage
---
I mean, looking at their models they do actually have opposable thumbs.
---
I‚Äôll be honest, it‚Äôs a children‚Äôs game. People are free to play it however they want within the established rules. You wanna be Grok‚Äôthor the human hating arms warrior who does nothing but pvp, groovy dude. The same goes for Mark the hunter, if he just wants to Netflix and chill while he autoshoots everything, dude it‚Äôs all good. The same thing can be said for the people who play auction house simulator all day, or make guilds and assist guildies, or the people who turn wow into Nat Pagle‚Äôs fishing simulator. If it comes down to it we can all call each other casual, because I doubt the min maxers are going to fish for hours on end during raiding hours. Or that the Chinese gold farmer enjoys it when I reply, ‚ÄòWinnie the Pooh, imma sic Xi Jinping on you.‚Äô, to their spam. Man, I hate night shift and at this point I‚Äôm rambling but I hope ya get my point. TL;DR: It‚Äôs a game, why care what others think about the way you play?
---
I'm right there with you, if only because I occasionally like to actually dps a dungeon. But nope, you join as a warrior, you're the tank, end of story.
---
Tried this, was met with ‚ÄúI always have to go to sleep alone‚Äù you can‚Äôt win folks, all hobbies die in the end.
---
we were all "here" yesterday, that's what reddit does! it sucks you in like a..... oh wait you mean "there" like outside in the photo there, yea I don't do outside....
---
Exactly. Its the retail mentality man. Just because dire comes out doesnt mean that people stop doing brd
---
Content still gets stale, if not outdated, and people, atleast most, will need more and new stuff after a while or they will stop playing.
---
Its already far behind with no Honor, no BGs and basically only half the dungeon roster it should have at this point.
---
People will get bored, some even are already bored since not everyone is interested in raiding most of the time or at all.
---
Thx for that very useful

Trust me brother, you are not alone. There are good days and bad days in classic for tanking. Sometimes you get lucky and get a group that understands threat, understands not to aoe their way to the top of the meter, understands to let you get a few sunders in. Other times you'll have that one or two dps who just... refuse to listen. No matter how politely you ask them to maybe hold back on dps for a few seconds to either let you build threat or get a couple sunders off, they just dont listen. And of course when things go sour you are the one to blame. You are not playing the class wrong you are doing your job. THEY are to blame for being impatient, for thinking it's a retail M+ dungeon in a vanilla setting when in fact it is not.
---
Take a look at Dominos. It‚Äôs very simple to use que let‚Äôs you customize everything about action bars from opacity, to lengths and the buttons you want to display
---
She wants the children to watch their parents be brutally murdered and dismembered in front of them while they watch helplessly, and then they‚Äôll starve to death in the following days. This toddler is a monster.
---
I too, am leveling OPs mom next
---
Yes it is a huge upgrade
---
Boohoo I lost to the class that's basically designed to be annoying in pvp
---
Man I haven't even played for like a week and i'm like level 50 with 8 days played.
---
You mean when heroic trash was immune to seduce to make it nearly impossible without a mage?
---
People think that tanks don't have GCD's, and magically generate more threat on 7 mobs than a mage can with blizzard. This whole AoE zoom-zoom fiesta is pissing me off and i tend not to group up with people that do it.
---
Certain crafted items are made purely to get tradeskills up to the maximum, not to make money. This became a bit more common in TBC but mainly hit it's stride in Wrath and Cata due to the buff for having a maxed out tradeskill.
---
Yes they can. Go to the pet trainer that you learn the different ranks of growl as well as stamina/resistances and they have an option to retrain your pet. It‚Äôs very cheap as well to respec them comparatively.
---
Good footage suffers from less than stellar editing.
---
Please understand that the new raids do not invalidate the earlier ones. There is very little catch up mechanisms in the game (Zul'Gurub comes to mind) so you will usually still have to go to molten core and the earlier raids even if the new ones show up.
---
Regarding PvP, well... if you are not level 60 yet it will be a mess for your. Raid geared players will always and have always been crushing it in PvP and classic has 0 remedy for that.
---
I'm 100% behind this. I'm a vanilla veteran and stopped playing at TBC, started again with WOTLK, stopped at Panda (like rly? what's that shit?!) and started again late Cataclysm.
---
When I heard of WoW Classic, I couldn't believe my eyes. But guess what: My life is going on and also there are responsibilities. With 28, I can't put that much time in playin WoW I used to when I were 14 or 18. I started playing classic last week and it's SO demotivating to see that I can't really get a chance to get 60 by the last phase. I hardly have like 10 hours / week to spend gaming.
---
So yes, please Blizzard, slow your ass down.
---
Epic Mount speeds everything else up.  Travel time is the Big time sink. 
---
Not counting inspecting people in orgrimmar or trying to out bid people with TSM.
---
The pied piper finally had enough of the stupid rats.
---
Sounds like you don‚Äôt know how to play your class, friendly suggestions, how about spamming your ‚Äú Overpower ‚Äú  on rogues? Oh I forgot that you don‚Äôt even know that you have such ability so as a result you‚Äôre here complaining how overpowered rogues are but the truth really is how dumb you are lol
---
LOL I see what you did there
---
Exactly lmfao
---
thanks that means I can't fuck up if I ever find Broken Tooth :D
---
It's an expensive BoE that sells for hundreds of gold. We all agreed on "All Need" before anyone rolled.
---
Bye
---
This honestly is my intend. Being over 9000 lumen holy boy sounds like so much fun! Braking the mold as well!  
---
Luckily I will play horde and therefore no palies available. I will still try to get a warlock or a warrior to go ahead and help me level.  
---
Thanks for the answer
---
Twas a good read. King's honor, friend.
---
Maybe I should charge money for tanking then. Leveling up lockpicking is no ordeal.
---
It hurt itself in confusion. Poor thing.
---
Cancelled my sub as well.
---
It's not anymore and I encourage EVERYONE to go check it !
---
I think the reason battle grounds are being time gated is so large scale world pvp can have a window of existence.
---
As much as I would love to hit some WSG right now, I do believe they have taken the best course of action with this.
---
Get wet.
---
&gt;I liked it when it was a way to write a description for your group or put yourself out there on your server.
---
that's the TBC implementation iirc
---
I don't get why even some modern gaming keyboard leave a gap between number keys and F-keys.
---
It reminds me of learning to play the guitar. The hand seems to be way to small but eventually it works.
---
As long as battlegrounds are not in the game it can't be too early
---
Disgusting
---
I think you missed his point. He's saying that besides PvP, there are other negative consequences to flying mounts. If you are able to get anywhere in the world by flying above the terrain, you avoid the interactions you would have had with other players along the way. A grappling hook to pull players off their flying mounts wouldn't fix the other issues.
---
I honestly don‚Äôt understand this. Blizzard is siding with an authoritative dictator with human rights violations? Why would they publicly come out saying it‚Äôs okay for governments to attack and brutalize and detain their citizens just for protesting? How can blizzard be okay with evil? Take evil‚Äôs side. Not even pay the man‚Äôs winnings like he did something wrong...
---
This is all some kind of joke right? Blizzard didn‚Äôt actually turn insane and evil overnight did they?
---
Do I really have to unsubscribe so soon after coming back to wow... but I can‚Äôt morally support someone who supports China...
---
How was that not a ninja? Dude took it for 50s to vendor
---
Only you can decide that! Is Broken Tooth more effective? Undoubtedly! Is that improvement worth your time? Well... Probably not. If you have to ask, it's probably not worth your time. Also, I doubt you'll actually notice a difference between Broken Tooth and a normal cat, unless you were hardcore PvPing, in which case you probably wouldn't ask the question in the first place...
---
Saw an undead priest MC a paladin instantly after the paladin resurrected his friend, and killed said friend as the paladin.
---
It's going to take you 8 months to hit level 60 as your current pace.  You obviously don't have time to raid.  Why do you want to throttle content for others?  You can't have it so you don't want others to?
---
More dmg/threat from tank = dps can do more dmg = shorter fights, less dmg taken by raidwide dmg, less time for stuff to screw up. What the perfect balance between survivability and threat generation is, I don‚Äôt know, but I don‚Äôt believe there is an objective answer (that we have found) to this. It depends on so much.
---
But sure, the cookie cutter approach is to just go hard for tankiness, which makes sense of course.
---
It's not too fast, its about the same time it took to come out in vanilla.
---
It's funny how they can add original AV to retail WoW during the upcoming anniversary event, but they can't even let us have it in classic, we just go straight to 1.12 AV.
---
I see. Well, it's somewhat surprising to hear this given all the negativity I've heard towards WotLK. But I guess it's just a thing in the circles I frequent. Primarily disgruntled players who stopped seriously playing in WoD and made a brief return for Legion, but really only did levelling content and world exploration.
---
Moist
---
Spy classic
---
it's better to just equip it as it's an insane item that will easily last you until lvl 60... the tiny gold you might get for it might not even be enough to make up for all the deposit fees if you have to list it many times at this point. alternatively, keep it untill battlegrounds come out, it will surely rise in price then
---
yep, nothing wrong with DM itself, but like OP I'm worried this is a sign things are going to be ultra fast, and I also don't want wow classic to be over, or get lost, or have burning crusade classic end up being released while I didn't have the time to visit AQ and naxx, like it happened at the time.
---
I and I think many other players who so enthusiastically jumped on  the wow classic hype, just want to play wow classic, we don't want it to be like retail, an endless rush to finish things and get new things again and again as fast as possible
---
Used to think this too. Then we downed Ragnaros first try without ever getting to the "sons" phase. Vael is a gear check mostly, but with Rag going down before sons with half the raid in greens, I think it will be the same here.  
---
Princess requires resistance gear, if you got that she's very manageable.  
---
Twin Emps could be tricky though, I'll give you that.
---
Yes, just keep the Bliizard Art Bar enabled.
---
I mean, if you're playing something like frost mage any of these are more than adequate.
---
I had a similar experience.
---
The quest mob spawned inside a house and when I entered, I saw that there were already two groups waiting. Both appeared to be made up of 4 people.
---
I asked for an invite multiple times and go no reply from any of the 8 people waiting.
---
When the mob spawned, I tagged it and got the kill. Two people both typed, "omfg" when they realized I was the one who got it lol.
---
A true rogue, makes me proud!
---
[This resource disagrees with you.](https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Attack-table)
---
To be honest, I welcome this addiction. It's the only thing i do with passion.
---
this is IF someone will take you to raid, pretty much as a tourist, compared to their regular raid roster on top 10% players already full geared or close to it.
---
Why they didn't make that channel auto-join is beyond me though.. So many people I've talked to had no idea it existed.
---
Good point.. good replacement until u get that tier 1 set bonus right?
---
During raids, your pet will spend most of its time either next to you, or dead on the floor to AoE damage. Actually using a pet for raid dps is somewhat challenging due to how poorly their AI is and how slowly they sometimes react to being moved or having their stances changed. Having a wolf pet in melee is fine, but in order to actually benefit anyone you‚Äôll have to do a lot of work to make sure it doesn‚Äôt wind up as a stain on the floor constantly.
---
Definitely respec shadow, especially if you‚Äôre on a PvP server too.
---
You‚Äôll heal dungeons just fine too.  A holy/disc build is more effective when things go wrong (eg being able to carry on casting while 3 mobs are chewing on your legs) and has better mana efficiency, but if you‚Äôve got a decent group this shouldn‚Äôt really be an issue anyway. It‚Äôs also worth holding on to some healing gear to switch to in dungeons.
---
I usually tip 25s. I think the item value in there averages around 1.5g.
---
I've been 60 for like 2 weeks and not even i think this is a good ideq
---
xD
---
no
---
Could maybe work with /castsequence?
---
Well because of scaling you can only outlevel xpacs, not zones anymore; so that‚Äôs not as much of a problem. Now that‚Äôs not without its own set of problems, but it‚Äôs nice to be able to finish an entire zone and get xp the entire time.
---
I‚Äôm level 44 and no trinket at all yet.
---
I usually go for mob tank charges first, it‚Äôs less likely to pull aggro to me and by the time we finish this mob tank has enough treat on everything else so I can switch to lowest health mob.
---
The fact is video games back then were perceived as drugs but now as careers, esport, streaming, YouTube let's play are not to be compared to today's quantity/popularity/accessibility
---
I never wanted to cancel, but just thinking about giving this POS another cent of my money and i can't. Liberty or die.
---
Hi. I am currently at lvl 54 with my Priest. Like you I didn't want to go full shadow. I know, everyone says "You can heal all leveling content as shadow". But the reality is: if going with randos, you will encounter SHIT groups. In these runs you will thank god for every point you put in holy. And your group will thank you too. Because they don't wipe three times. (I've actually had quite a few Tanks complimenting me for healing through a horrible add group, saving everyone's day). 
---
Long story short: Until lvl50 I went with this build:
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bVMhsZf0tZxMGp0tR](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bVMhsZf0tZxMGp0tR)
---
Suggested progression: Get Wand Spec and Spirit Tap asap! Ignore Disc tree afterwards. Get 10 Points in Holy then, because you will start to do dungeons, having your 10 Point holy when starting SM can make a big difference. Focus on shadow tree from now on.
---
This is roughly the route I took and I'm doing very well, I feel powerful as a healer and I don't struggle a bit in solo content, despite not having shadow form.
---
You said mid 40 (which is generally accepted the half way point) up to 50. So those now at mid 40 will take 2 more months at their current pace. I said 1-2 months to include those a bit higher.
---
Blizzard stated, that they will release dire maul due to player feedback. So ask them who those players demanding new content now are. But players already level 60 are the minority, and if only a small part of that group is demanding new content now, maybe my number of 1% wasn't that far off. I don't know how many there are, but I don't think those people should be the group dictating the schedule.
---
Let me introduce you to Ngorongoro Crater: https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ngorongoro
---
Those are worgs, the wolves in wow look pretty normal and dont have large fangs. Worgen or Warg are mythological wolf-like creatures originally from norse mythology and later widely established by tolkien. And then sometime later blizzard came and misused the name for a human race of shapeshifters, completely forgetting that they already added worgen to the game...
---
And that's an auto-subscription cancellation from me.
---
I'm a vanilla player, I waited a long time for Classic and I've been having so much fun in the game since released, but no fucking way am I compromising my ethics so I can be complicit in evil.
---
I did find that I leveled through MoP far too quickly even with the scaling. I entered jade forest at 80 and hit 90 during krasarang wilds/valley of the four winds. Admittedly I did have heirlooms on, but it is possible to have to move on before you're really done with content.
---
I've been playing since Vanilla, though it used to be done it wasn't set in stone, usually the tank pulls then hunter pull their trap target and others do their CC. At least that's how it was done on my server 15 year ago. This way the risk of aggroing and taking unwanted damage is very limited, it also has to do with threat buildup. Tanks are usually equipped with a ranged weapon, or can go in hard on groups of melee. 
---
in short: let the tank pull if he makes a mistake at least you didn't cause the wipe.
---
Dome, ez
---
Critiquing the actions of one of the largest gov in the world with a horrible recent history of human rights abuse when they actively apply influence over the companies and organisations that we interact with is not the same as bashing the blacks or Jews. It‚Äôs not even vaguely close. Heck the guy didn‚Äôt even bash the Chinese gov. He just supported HK. 
---
But if the Chinese gov is so pathetically cowardly that a yellow bear offends them then maybe their leadership does need to be laughed at and trampled on.
---
Need for AH
---
:D
---
Because DM will be there the 16, and as hunter doing tribute run farm is very lucrative, we are talking 100+ gold /hour
---
wouldn't work, unless you rescale all Classic gear. Naxxramas gear at 60 is insane to the point of being game breaking.
---
One of the main reasons they raised the level cap to 70 and introduced ratings was to fix the itemization. You can't possibly introduce gear more powerful than Naxx at lvl 60 and not break the game.
---
Forgive me, for I don't see how releasing even all the end game content at once would hamper those that level at their own relaxed paces in the slightest. More to look forward to when levelling I'd say.
---
I came here for this.
---
fuck off shill
---
You are thinking too much into this.
---
Wouldnt work for tbc eithet if they didny make a way to get to tempest keep / netherwing camp.
---
Thanks! Once I'm off work I'll be adding this to my list of addons. I'm going for another run of BFD and that place's variety causes there to be tons of strange trash to drop.
---
I've also had the low level food items and others drop, and what's more, I tend to vendor all food with my priest (who needs food when you can heal?) so this should help clear my bags nicely!
---
Just a reminder that at one time they were considering releasing Dire Maul at launch.  Them deciding to stick it in earlier than expected by the playerbase shouldn't be that shocking as it seems they wanted it out sooner rather than later.  Considering even semi-hardcore players have Rag/Ony down at this point it and you can pretty much join a PUG for a full/nearly full MC clear, it isn't going to be affecting much progression.
---
Quote: Our first phase primarily focuses on launching Classic with Onyxia and Molten Core, but we‚Äôve decided to hold off on Dire Maul for a while. Maraudon is still in the first phase, because it was originally released on December 18, 2004, just two weeks after the first player hit level 60, but we recognize that Dire Maul is in a different category. Some of the loot that‚Äôs attainable from Dire Maul is so good that it would affect progression through those early raids. We‚Äôre also planning to hold off on releasing Kazzak and Azuregos at launch as well, for the same reasons.
---
Wrath dungeons were a breeze because people complained that TBC dungeons were "too hard." That's why cc ceased to be a thing after TBC and didn't return until Cata when Blizz once again beefed the difficulty of dungeons back up a bit. 
---
Threat generation was still an issue when you had high geared, front loaded dps and also, and especially, with trolls spamming searing pain or hunters who refused to turn off their pet's growl. I would have to stop the run until the hunter complied. So I definitely remember having issues and talking with other tanks about it. One of them recommended an addon called Taunt Master. It showed who had aggro and allowed you to quickly taunt mobs off your party. For instance with a DK, you could left click for taunt and right click for death grip.
---
The point of my op was after the bump to 500%, people could do pretty much whatever they wanted and not pull off me.
---
I don't think this is even close to 100g/hour. Thick/Rugged leathers sell for around 6s 30c each. So 100 skins is only 6.3 gold
---
I'm using tilt controls!!
---
What‚Äôs was your average play time during this 2 days ? And did you do ring run to melee ? It can help by adding 25g every 4 run
---
Winter spring j think is best. I know azshara and sos has them but not sure they drop it
---
Oh and just in case you were confused. People are not appearing the Chinese people. They suffer under the Chinese gov as more than anyone.  The government is what is being pushed back against. Not the people.
---
Well put. Absolutely agree.
---
Shouldn't have pledge to protect the Kurds if the plan was just to pull out anyways. Let them all sort it out on their own instead of guaranteeing protection just to show the world America can't keep promises to their allies.
---
Yeah its nuts how many wars there are atm.  My guild is running 7-8/40 at the mo. 2 MT's, 5-6 DPS.  And honestly we could take more easily.  On the flipside, we only have 1 druid in our 40 man.  So if you want a raid spot, roll druid!
---
Took me 2 days to do that shitty quest, and that was when there were more layers.
---
Being employed with a baby to take care, i'm at lvl 43. I dont care being left behind as i know i'm a casu now
---
Imma level with ya, your post struck me as someone who got called a casual and came to reddit bootyblasted. So my long ass reply above is directly on point if that is the case.
---
Thank you.
---
People make it seem like the release of dire maul is the end of classic.
---
BLASPHEMY! praise be the god! HELIX BE THE NAME!
---
In Classic, especially as a hunter, you do three things mainly:auto-attacks from you and your pet, aimed shot and multi-shot inbetween auto-attacks.
---
Over years the ppaystyle evolved and the amount if damage done via auto attacks got reduced, ultimately increasing the skill ceiling naturally. With BFA Blizzard decided to go back to times where auto attacks are literally the number two or three of your sources of damage, instead of being a means to proc stuff.
---
So, yes.
---
Swamp of Sorrows. Boring quests with nothing interesting going on there.
---
Because the moment you dont have to leave the city to do everything you want it stops being an MMO
---
Are there any specific guides for *paladin* DM farming? I could only find guides for mages and priests, with paladins just mentioned as being able to do it, but not explained how.
---
Are you balls deep as you write this?
---
you type /gquit and never look back
---
I feel ya brudda. Level 30 and I've never initiated a PvP fight, only waved. So far 50/60 ally are giving me hell in hillsbrad, continuous camping and killing of quest giving NPC's. Same with ashenvale/splinterwood post. 
---
Inb4 cry more &amp; go play pve server, I just want to be higher level before I fuck with PvP okay :)
---
Apparently it is ok to need for selling.
---
Disarm him from the get go. Toss a rend on. If you don't already have it get an addon to show cast bar. When you see him casting a heal you can interrupt with an intimidating shout. Use this time to bandage. You could also set up a macro to switch to a shield and shield bash for the interrupt and a proper silence.
---
I have a quest in mind for years that I did in classic. It is a quest over a few zones iirc, and one part is in feralas where you have to get in a kind of ruin. I didnt have a key or anything but got in because I somehow jumped in. Does anyone know what quest I am talking about?
---
.....oh my God this joke went over my head. I just got it. In my defense I don't PvP but I still feel like I should have known better.
---
Does this work for *all* dungeons?
---
OMG I didn't know my inner Jukebox was *this* ready to start playing
---
On my server, Alliance side: Tanks &amp; Warlocks. Also Dwarf Priests would be nice, they feel rarer than human or Night Elf which has shocked me.
---
Hey dude, lvl 46 Druid here.  
---
I recommend to just continue leveling like some others already said.  
---
From lvl 40 you will receive way more money from quests and greys. Dont waste now your time for stupid farming.
---
I did one run of WC with no tank and it took so long and was a total mess. We didnt even get to the escort lol I guess I'll roll a warrior so she can experience some "normal" dungeons
---
I do prefer [Brain Hacker] more
---
I mean my guild is already raid logging, but to me thats how it should be. I cant meaningful progress my charactes besides raids.
---
BOOMERS RISE UP
---
&gt;  a regular working person could even hit 60
---
Just because people have work, doesn't mean we can't lvl 60. I have 40 hour work week, and 2 weeks ago i had 50 hours. But i hit lvl 60 a couple of weeks ago + i have cleared MC and Ony.
---
How did you have time to write all this ?
---
So, ***this*** was the inception of Minecraft.
---
True, if play time doesn't go up drastically, he's looking at lvl next summer or fall
---
The Eye of the Beast looking one is Mark of the Chosen from Maraudon

---
our groups killed Ony within like 20-30 seconds of eachother, neither group was stacked
---
Teach it the 120 fire resistance talent, it helps a ton with keeping it alive in MC/Ony (and later on BWL).  
---
Don't take the armor talent, take the stamnia talent instead (a raid pet should not be tanking physical hits).  
---
Unless the boss has a fear mechanic you can outrange, you should get close enough for all of the group to recieve the 'Furious Howl', while you can still attack. This will also let you weave in melee attacks once you get tired of the two-button rotation.  
---
You can force it to cast Furious Howl with macros such as;  
---
/cast Multi-Shot  
---
/cast Furious Howl  
---
Just add the '/cast Furious Howl' line to your abilities.  
---
Lastly, disable the 'Bite' ability so all the focus goes to the 'Furious Howl' ability.  
---
  
---
Happy hunting!
---
I guess he forgot to take his cowbell that morning.
---
Tbh id much honestly prefer tbc's lfg tool, the one that premade groups are searching, simply because of the lfg channel is just spammed to get spellcleave comps and/or tanks, thats basicly 80% of it
---
She was! i played her, super OP in PVP! :D
---
But by saying "Its a downgrade" you're saying that its a downgrade, you dont need the literally.
---
Server exclusive dungeon finder might not be too bad. Then again, you could get grouped with someone who has a precious little note about how you‚Äôve wronged them before, then leaves the group
---
I just got my alt to level 60..
---
To be honest, I feel like flight (besides the taxi system), just doesn't belong in the game. Why create these beautiful zones only to have people hop on their mount, point their character in the direction they need to go and turn on autorun until they get there. It just nullifies so many aspects of the game that it feels like it doesn't belong. I'm just not confident enough that the current Blizzard could come up with a solution that would allow flight without the negative consequences. However, at least in TBC, flying was limited to Outland, so at least there's that.
---
r/theydidthemonstermath
---
Then we must kith.
---
This is wrong on so many levels... congrats though
---
I guess you're trolling now, but I'll bite.
---
As a Paladin you actually have tons of spells you want keybound (including lower ranks). It is a support/utility class and again, you're limiting yourself if you don't use those abilities or are too slow because you have to click them. Maybe not yet when you're still low level, but it's better to get used to them now than when you have to do that at high/max level.
---

If this is not enough for you, then go to retail or another game that have what you are looking for.
---
Warframe, destiny 2 maybe. There u have hub based gameplay.
---
Yes - I'm pretty sure the whole "not-China" market is bigger than the Chinese market right? Not sure of the actual numbers but some quick searching shows that the population of just Europe+USA is about the same as China.
---
Why did you log in on 3rd party sites? For what purpose? Siunds way to fishy tbh. Did you miss telling us some information?
---
Haha nice roll
---
I would indeed be more than happy if I could get a single 60 in 2 to 3 months lol. Currently at level 33, but it's the first time I play WoW ever anyway so I'm also very much a noob. :)
---
I went into CLassic believing BGs were there, because thats such a basic thing... and now i noticed they come in PHASE 3! Thats atleast half a year or more away. 
---
Even "just" Honor isnt enough to keep me around that long, i wont know what to do a few months in the future so i will just take a break until there is more to do.
---
I just wished it would come faster. I really dont care if they slow down raids, but the other option should have been there already or atleast come a lot sooner than currently planned.
---
I'm assuming here the rogue will be relying on DoTs to finish off the warrior, right? I've never PvPed and I don't usually rely on DoTs (I only use it on bosses).
---
That would be a terrible decision... killing instantly almost all social aspect of the game. Some runs are quest runs, some are BIS chase, some are aoe farming, some are ...

On a side note, I got 260 eng with 70g. The 40 more is way more expensive because of thorium.
---
I don't think battlegroundforums/pwndepot exists any more, but there was big threads about these two weapons there back then, also slower weapon increases chances of crusader procc, which you have to take into consideration, level 49 twinking is all about short bursts, where having slower weapon, bigger mortal strikes matters more. I'm sure Kang would be better dps overall in a 5 minute patchwerk sim, but that's irrelevant.
---
Got mine yesterday from a trashmob in Winterspring. Hard to sell tho because it's so expensive.

I'm not sure rolls show up when flying

Im a 60 warlock, and want my epic mount now. Any content after Dire Maul can take forever to be released and I‚Äôll be ok with that. Until then, pls give me Dire Maul!!!!

I mean India alone is a market as big as China, but no company seems to bend over backwards to praise Shiva.

You can't imagine how much I regret rolling warrior. Played one in Vanilla through WotLK and thought it would be nice to do so again out of nostalgia, and honestly everything up to 60 was very nice even though leveling is a bit rough as warrior. Just now I suddenly compete with all those melee cleave leveled DPS warriors who never wore a shield since release, and it sucks balls. 
---
Would absolutely roll druid or shaman, maybe WL or hunter, if I could choose again.
---
This is me on my druid. Laptop broke, can't play. Fml
---
What server and faction m8
---
&gt;It's the same dilemma there was in Vanilla, for everything up to 60 you need a tank per five players, and then in raids you need two tanks for 40 players.
---
Then you get to Four Horsemen in NAXX where guilds wanted 8 warriors with set bonus to get the extra hit chance on taunt back in the day.
---
Wow that is so cool I wanna be like you when I'm older
---
Oh, forgot that one, is in the bank
---
sub canceled!
---
Yea I have heard that solo warrior questing Is really rough. Like the misses once RIPS memes. I'll definitely give it a shot. Thank you :)
---
Who is it that's claiming 40 is halfway? 40-60 is incredibly quick compared to 1-40. Especially considering you can start farming pre raid BiS in your low-mid 50's.
---
Kromcrush?

#FreeHongKong
---
You can clear armory without a cleave group in around 15 to 20 minutes, no big deal imho
---
I understand what the GM was trying to do i think - but the way he executed it was horrible.
---
He probably thought that everyone would view it as a fun competition with the other raid to see who can defeat ony first, but when people said "nah, we don't want that" he should've just accepted defeat and just let the 2 raids be on their way.
---
The part where he commits to his idea and tries to force it through, he legit just had a hissy fit and lit fire to everything.
---
Is there even a functionality to grant full access to third party sites through battle net? If so, that sounds like a major design flaw on Blizzard's end.
---
Outside downloading an addon to tell you where potential spawns are, it's pretty much just down to luck.
---
Looks like "Prat"
---
Yeah nice karma and all that, but also kinda childish to keep camping his mob.
---
I'd just ignore the guy and move one, just my 2copper
---
He spawns a few secs before release. Just coincidence.
---
I really wish I didn‚Äôt know the video your name came from...
---
Funny how this post aged lol
---
At one point he says this takes about 10 minutes, in reference to clearing the floor. I hope he isn't talking about just running groups through that part and bailing? That's the only way I can see his math checking out, but even then...
---
Black dragonkin in burning steppes is good. They drop nice Gold+grey/green items and you can skin them for leather/black scales (will be nedded for warlock epic mount quest when DM go live). I got few rare drops there as Well. I suppouse it because they are elite and have better loot table than normal mobs.
---
Not yet, th ST class quests will be in a later phase (likey 4 or 5).
---
The second one is [Heart of the Scale](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13164/heart-of-the-scale) from LBRS last boss, fire resist and damage to melee attackers for 5 minutes
---
Depends on the item, most days im the only one or close to the only one selling an item thats very niche.
---
Usually i sell 2-6 of these a day at a good profit. But sometimes some other people come in, see my prices and flood the market at maybe twice the crafting cost which is at least half my asking price. 
---
If i bought all of them they would keep making the item and i would be stuck with a bunch of things that would take me weeks to unload assuming they stopped.
---
So instead i undercut them until they fuck off and then reestablish the old price.
---
Yes I also hope you get your gear back. That is a start at least. The rest will come back with time.... The Mount Thing is what really hurts but well. 90g isn't the world at Level 60 at least. 
---
And never Forget not to Login to any dodgy looking and sounding Websites that want your Details. When they do - ask yourself why they would want that first.
---
Also don't downlaod addons from unofficial sites.
---
But I think you know that now :/ GL m8
---
For me it's totally about the social interaction of putting a group together.  When you have people doing everything from behind a menu screen, you no longer have a community.  This has been observed time and time again since LFG and LFR were introduced in latter expansions.
---
Disenchant yourself
---
Wowhead only gets access to: Account ID, Battletag, and being able to view your profile. They can't log into your WoW account and delete your items.
---
50-52 range is the worst. It's in such an awkward place. You don't get much benefits at 50 compared to other milestones, there aren't good dungeons for this level and all the questing zones have the weirdest quest level curve that seems to just skip out these levels.
---
43 Is the other weird one. I remember questing in Hinterlands and going from a 42 quest to a 46 quest in the next part of the chain and suddenly I had to leave the zone after doing the first quest and come back once I was higher level.
---
Now I'm 54 and have made the terrible mistake of trying to quest in Western Plaguelands, the single most janky questing zone you'll ever experience. The quest chromie gives you to kill those worms is complete BS, it's level 55 I think and you use the item to kill the quest mobs and it SPAWNS 3 LEVEL 57 MOBS LIKE WHY, WTF I DIED 4 TIMES IN 30 MINUTES DOING THIS SHIT!
---
&gt; Wow was great from vanilla to Wrath. After that it sucked.
---
It started with Wrath.
---
The dungeonfinder killed the social aspect.
---
Wrath itself was still good, because the people who still played came from Vanilla und BC and still hat that mindset.
---
BGs are in phase 3. When Phase 2 hits, honor system will be in place but you can only gain honor ranks by World PvP. My goal is to be 60 before that massacre happens.
---
Happened to me in vanilla wow. 
---
My gametime was running out, and because I was leaving for a week I didn't add gametime yet. When I came back, I wanted to log in and as I clicked the "login" button I remembered that I didn't add gametime yet, BUT to my surprise the game logged me in anyway!
---
To my surprise, someone added gametime to my account and left all chars naked with everything sold and send away. About 1k worth in money :( 
---
After I opened a ticket, Blizz said they would have to investigate. It took about a month IIRC. By that time I already gathered the same amount of money.  
---
So, after that month I get a few ingame mails from Blizzard, with ALL my gear back AND money! I even got more than I had previously, as it seems they also restored whatever trash/dungeon loot I had sold in that time frame. And the amount of money I got back, was the raw gold I had, PLUS everything they got from selling my gear and bank so I actually got quite a bit more stuff.
---
Finally I ended up with:
---
All my gear and bank stuff back + whatever I sold previously  
---
All my raw gold + the extra gold  
---
60 days game time, the hackers added to my account
---
and if we add the money I farmed till I got my stuff back I ended up with about 3k gold &gt;.&gt;
---
&gt;Healers can't save you if you literally die in the span of a gcd
---
Get more HP. Dying to 4k crashes in Naxx is no excuse when you can have 14k+ HP with capped armor in AQ40 gear.  
---
Nefarian can't really be tanked by druids, that's true - his class call screws druids way harder than warriors. But on Vael, druid is way better, since he naturally has more threat and doesn't need to sacrifice so much survivability for it.
---
&gt; The two major ones that are random places being considered outdoors, so you‚Äôll step on a piece of wood and get removed Fromm travel form, lose cat speed, can‚Äôt use entangle, etc. that bug is actually not Druid specific and it‚Äôs more annoying for shaman since they can‚Äôt instant GW.
---
Wasnt it always like this though? I remember getting dismounted random places.
---
What an absolute dick
---
First you're the best ret paladin, then you start your own cult.
---
Meanwhile Im another race throwing Runecloth at the gnomes to have the glorious riding battlechickens.

An insult AND an apology!!!

How dare you!?
---
I don't think you need to rebind tab, just hold it down.
---
Just found a rakzur club in wetlands (https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12983/rakzur-club). Auctioneer says it is worth 92 gold currently. Is that a fair price? or is it better to sit on this item until BG's are released and twinks want it?
---
I mean, you could say that about almost any dungeon tho? And once there's enough people running/farming DM, prices on the AH will be reasonable or laughably cheap for anything dropping there.
---
I think it's similar to DM loot in general being on the same level as Scholo, UBRS or any other current endgame dungeon.
---
I didn't plays the latest wow versions exactly cous of dangeon finder. It's turn the mmo with an open world into session game, in my opinion
---
Can anyone help solve a weapon dilemma for a lvl47 arms warrior? I got a "Diabolic Skiver" from a ZF run and my current weapon is  "Bonebiter". I thought Skiver might be better, but I forgot that I put points into the Axe specialization talents. Is the difference between the Skiver and the Bonebiter large enough to justify respecing talents to Polearm specialization? Thanks.
---
Every spell has a spellpower coefficient. For dots, usually it's upwards of 100%, but will be divided evenly between the maximum number of ticks.
---
Stones are already there, if you want a summon find a lock
---
But The complainers decide to play a 15 year old game and expect The creature comforts of 2019. I donr get it
---
Ew, get him out of here.
---
Can confirm.
---
Source: Am lazy warrior, can't be bothered to stance dance (I don't PvP and I know that PvE content still has benefit for stance dancing, but I really can't be bothered to have a rotation that includes about a million abilities spread out over all the stances).
---
I scroll down and down here and on Twitter and can't understand what's "standing for Hong Kong" means. I know it's a city in Asia. Why am I supposed to know what politics is happening there?
---
Humans have the rep bonus which saves a lot of time
---
New game +
---
I leveled with Sage and I wasn't very happy with it. It's bugged, fails to mention steps, fails to update, etc., and above lvl 40 or so it can't really be used as much more than a general guideline, and not a step by step superefficient guide.
---
classicwow.live seems pretty good, but a huge downside is they have no addon support so you have to have a 2nd monitor, or keep alt tabbing all the time.
---
TrinketMenu. If you have any trinket equipped, it adds a small bar with 2 buttons you can click to use them. If you hover your mouse over the equipped ones it shows the whole list of the ones in your bags, left clicking 1 equips it on the first slot, right clicking does it in the 2nd one, and doing it while in combat adds them to a queue and equips them as soon as the fight is over.
---
I know but im really interested in getting to 60 as fast as i can
---
Cheers!  
---
So, each time you level up:
---
Happiness level 1: 0 points  
---
Happiness level 2: 1 points  
---
Happiness level 3: 2 points  
---
Happiness level 4: 3 points  
---
Happiness level 5: 4 points  
---
Happiness level 6: 5 points  
---
If it changes happiness level mid-level you will immediately receive the remainder.
---
Sad to hear that bud, but you did the right thing for sure. These people gotta learn eventually.
---
Did not, actually. Good point.
---
It's coming out so we dont have to bitch about using lv 45 water still
---
I totally forgot about "VC" lol, I still have no idea what it stands for and was always forgetting people meant Deadmines.
---
Wowhead is also a different company and does not require you to is your blizzard creds as your wowhead creds, same for curse, wowinterface, and any other non blizzard site.
---
Definitely a dickgun.
---
you want the pve content to slow down, fine. You want PvP content to slow down, fuck yourself.
---
This just goes to Show how much more Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms still had to offer. And Blizzard decided to scrap all that and make a new continent. (Well yes - not all of it - Caverns of Time was still a Thing) 
---
But we get flying! :P Which nobody asked for xD
---
Well I still liked TBC but I think I would massively like all the ideas from that Website. 
---
I genuinely hope we get Classic + instead of TBC after Classic.
---
Or for TBC Fanboys sake - both. Even though that would massively split up the playerbase. Which would be a shame
---
The question is what will happen if they hit content max?
---
Wannabes will leave soon... :) Leaving you with people that are on the same level as you. The only question is: will there be enough players on the servers at that time?
---
Do you know that thing you can do with any cast, where you move near the end of the cast but it doesn't get interrupted? The thing most people do when mounting, you move and your cast is interrupted but you are still mounted.
---
You can do that with the innkeeper as well.
---
Walk to the furthest point where you can still talk to the innkeeper. Then you get the confirmation box to come up.
---
Run towards the exit and INSTANTLY press "accept".
---
You'll have your HS set to a place close to the door than anyone.
---
There is no wrong way to level. You are paying for your sub, ao play as you enjoy. Why rush to 60?
---
Are you doing instances? Those are often quic and easy XP. If you run around for quests a lot you lose time. If you want to look at it that way. I say you should do everything that is fun for you and not care on how quickly one should get to lvl 60. Take your time and smell the roses!
---
Yup, and that is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of potential.
---
This is Canada right ?
---
The talents for polearms and axes are equal, so unless you're an orc and have axe specialization, the damage calculations are exactly the same, so it would depend on item stats.
---
Take into account however that the talent for polearms is an additional rank down, so you miss out on improved hamstring if you go a 31/x/y spec.
---
bad rogues, yes. For decent rogues, warriors are easy cake.
---
Playing a 20/31/0 Protadin is very similar except you have a lot of competition for healing gear. Gearing your tanking set is pretty easy since you'll generally be the only person after tanking plate in a group.
---
Though if you're aiming to stack spelldamage trinkets/rings/weapons you'll butt heads with casters.
---
Thanks bro!
---
It's gonna inflate gold quite a bit and that's absolutely great. The economy is absolutely trash right now. Ghost mushrooms for 1g 50s, shadowpots for 80s... yeah right.
---
Yes that's very slow mid 40s is the halfway point time wise on 1-60.  20+ days played is absolutely nuts
---
I‚Äôve gotten plenty of leveling done instead of watching Grey‚Äôs Anatomy and I regret nothing.
---
Sunken Temple class quest are not implemented yet no
---
I only see three though
---
it currently shows as unbinded, and doesn't do shit when i press it :'(
---
Both would be cool but TBC/Wrath has the issue of having an''end-date''. Since the Classic crowd would likely quit after Wrath or even after TBC.
---
It's because once the npc's defense is more than 10 above your weapon skill, the first 1% of additional hit chance from gear is ignored. Were that code not there, it'd be 8% at +3 levels.
---
So if there are 40 players in raid and I win something, I'm then not allowed to roll for the rest of the raid because of +1 rule?
---
Lol why would anyone go and heal a dungeon then when their main spec is tank/dd?
---
It is a old discussion - everybody should just discuss this Prior to the dungeon. There is no General answer because a lot of People just heal in order to help the Group. They might not even like healing. I don't see why they shouldn't be allowed to roll on it.
---
But as I said. It Needs to be discussed beforehand because everyone has different opinions on this.
---
I view us Pallies as the Warrs who got sick of dying and so sorta cooped out.
---
To be this upset over a post that doesn't affect you at all. Nice
---
or badlands or swamp of sorrows
---
I beleive there is an addon (dunno the name since I never used it) which puts together a group for you but you still all have to go to the location on your own.
---
Everyone goes their own pace. You have 9 days probably because you stayed logged in and AFK a lot / you did professions. My priest dinged 60 at 6 days played but I didn‚Äôt have any professions and kind of rushed through. 
---
Enjoy your time :)
---
It's not that bad, if you don't try to kill mobs you should not be killing. It's mostly that you have a lot of downtime due to eating, you have very low utility to salvage screwed up mob pulls or adds, you're constantly broke due to repair bills, and you're food in PvP. 
---
But with a buddy, downtime goes to pretty much zero, you're kinda safe from PvP, and your buddy hopefully brings some of the missing utility.
---
Yeah, that's my best friend. Whenever he feels overly suicidal I make sure I overheal him.
---
i get like 1-2 dungeons after work, and a bit of gold farming before work, + weekends, so it's totally doable
---
its more about changes to itemization.
---
That's just bartender.
---
2 factor authentication won't save you if you have it set to remember your login.  All it takes is for someone to spoof your IP and session ID and they can get access to your account.  For this reason, 2 factor authentication is most effective if you physically log out of your blizzard client after every session.
---
It's also possible that someone has gleaned enough personal info to trick blizzard into removing the authenticator.
---
Price questions always depend on server economy. You ought to be able to get quite a bit for it, but whether that could mean 50g or 300g depending on demand and server.
---
Same planet. Everything affects you one way or the other and vice versa.
---
If you're playing that much you aren't casual, you just level inefficiently. 
---
Before 40, you can get a level per hour and a half questing, not even doing dungeons, which are even better xp.
---
Bubble Self

Wand till Dead
---
Repeat to 60.
---
had a reverse situation 
---
playing holy/prot paladin, join a stratholme run as a healer, rolling for heal gear
---
they can't find a tank, so i offer to tank if i can roll on heal gear, everyone agrees
---
mid-dungeon someone leaves so we get a replacement, except the party leader never bothers to tell him that i'm rolling on heal gear, and i never get the bright idea to ask if he knows. so then when i'm rolling on a belt with spell power on it, the new guy is suddenly blasting me for being a ninja, rest of the dungeon is everyone hating everyone
---
I'm using "Itemized Deductions" for Titan panel.
---
It show's the cheapest grey item/stack and the amount of money it sells for by default, and you can destroy the cheapest by without opening your bags.
---
It also shows a list, sorted from cheapest to more expensive items when you mouse over it. You can modify it to also show white (or any quality) items, blacklist some items so they don't show up and much more.
---
you're fault for choosing to only play half the game
---
Or maybe they'll figure out a way to restart a new round of classic servers once the current patch reaches the end of the vanilla content cycle. Or continue this batch on through Burning Crusade, while adding new servers starting at the beginning with a refined release schedule in hopes it'll hold classic subscribers around, instead of burning through the whole timeline and quitting once there's "nothing to do"
---
yeah, this ain't retail bud
---
No, only among the players that actually want an item. So if you got an item, and another one drops where lets say 3 other people are interested, you can only roll, if all of those 3 have already won something as well. If not, among you 4, only those who haven't won something may roll.
---
You can google the halfway point yourself with lots of results, here is just one: [Level 44 is the halfway point!](/r/classicwow/comments/bfevz2/level_44_is_the_halfway_point/). Which kinda fits my own observation, each level so far took on average longer than the previous one, as xp required really increases a lot faster then the xp gain.
---
And according to our servers census channel, the amount of players reaching 60 within a month was about 1%. Sure, there are more level 60 now, but are you really going to tell me, someone that reached lvl 60 a week or two ago has already reason to cry for more content because they ran out?
---
I'm not arguing to wait for the last 10%, but at least wait until a third or so of the people are done with the current content before moving on.
---
well, it's simple imo:
---
if you're healing the dungeon, you can roll on any healing cloth, as that's what you need for your current spec. can also take any mail/ plate non-healer items if no one else needs them, or if you communicated it beforehand.
---
if you're tanking the dungeon, you roll on tank items, and ASK if you can roll on healer/ DPS items beforehand.
---
Me too. Also cancelled.
---
No I don't think you can do that. Just have to get weak auras or something to help it show up on your screen bigger.
---
It's honestly really simple. Personally, up until 40 I used PW: Shield &gt; Holy Fire &gt; Mind Blast &gt; SW: Pain &gt; Wand
---
After 40 Shadowform respec: PW: Shield &gt; Mind Blast &gt; SW: Pain &gt; Mind Flay x2 &gt; Wand
---
I didn‚Äôt get my first trinket until about level 49
---
&gt;Agility is crit chance and dodge chance whereas strength is just damage so agility&gt;strength
---
On the other hand, if you run with a shield, Strength is more damage blocked.
---
I would advice you to go deep into the shadow tree. I had never any problems with healing instances  with my spec and you will have a way easier time killing things.
---
But what about Hong Kong? Lololololol
---
Players are qutting, that's why the panicked with DM
---
Unfortunately it *isnt* that simple because someone will always have a problem with you rolling on gear they also need if its not your main armor type. I've had people bitch and moan at me for rolling need on Cloth healer gear for because "Bro wtf you ninja! You wear plate not cloth!"
---
No. 
---
This is how you would like it to be. That is your opinion.
---
In General there would be a lot less healers if they were never allowed to roll for their desired spec.
---
People heal because healers are needed (a lot of the time) and not because they want to heal or desire it.
---
Therefore it is not on the healer to mention that beforehand it is on the whole Group to sort this shit out. 
---
It is as much in your interest to sort this out as it is in the healers interest.
---
So everyone should try and discuss this beforehand.
---
&gt; The dungeonfinder killed the social aspect. 
---
Disagree, cross server rdf killed the social aspect.
---
So I'm guessing you had one Paladin who forgot to use RF and/or didn't have Consecration, then swore off Paladins altogether? Because Paladins are fantastic dungeon tanks, even more so while leveling, because gear isn't outscaling their skill ranks. 
---
If the Paladin tank in a dungeon run is having threat issues, then nobody could tank for that group. Taunt/Growl only snags one target, but single-target threat generally isn't a problem, and a Warrior isn't going to magically hold 4 enemies because he taunted one. Challenging Shout only forces targets to attack but does nothing about threat.
---
LFM UBRS Rend Runs! 5 Caster DDs, 2 Tanks, 2 Heal
---
You know that people at the top end are craving for the pvp system to be released because there is nothing to do right now except for raiding mc for 1 1/2h and farming gold. It's boring without it.
---
Can anyone give me an example of where this would be useful?
---
If you have to aim with your camera why not just click the enemy?
---
Just find a guy soloing the mara and buy the ring drop from him, they go for like 15-30 gold i believe?
---
it's a great tank weap for starting, if you cant get a TF.
---
I‚Äôll play the way I want.  Pvp sucks and I‚Äôm never doing it
---
I suppose you just love leaving comments like that, if the joke in the post went over your head that easily.
---
they drop greys that sell for quite a lot though. it's almost better farming coyotes then those elementals right now because that place is way to crowded. tried to do the quest yesterday and it took me ages because there were so many people
---
Why are you dragging rotgrip to prinvess, when you cam easily do goblin&gt;princess&gt;rotgrip, amd still do the runs so quickly you get instance locked if you dont pay attention? Seems like such a chore and an extreme risk in comparison
---
Exactly. Low level stuff is getting more expensive these days because there aren‚Äôt thousands of people grinding that stuff anymore.
---
Seems kinda mean if you didn't warn them that you'd be rolling on shadow stuff when they weren't expecting it. 
---
On the other hand, if he wanted those he should have asked beforehand.
---
You learn from your mistakes. I did the same thing TWICE, when first playing wow in vanilla as a 13 year old. First time I didn't understand how it happened, and that it was my own fault, thus second time happened.
---
Lesson learned. Now you won't make it in the future. 
---
I wish you all the best in getting your items back!
---
I second this
---
Yes he should have told the raid before the boss. Your absolutely correct about that but you are wrong when sayung when healing a raid/dungeon that's your main spec. Have you read your comment "regardless of talents/gear". That doesn't makes sense. Some people heal regardless of there main spec just to help or get into the group does not make it their main spec
---
No u.
---
Because sooner or later their politics with directly affect you since many companies bow down to the chinese market out of pure greed. Its called Human rights, not American or European rights.
---
I strongly disagree.
---
Ashbringer or Mograine
---
I don't think that's ironic at all. In fact, it might even be the whole joke.
---
Blizzard actually shut down all the vanilla servers they were available and running a lot slower. Kinda funny they spend 2 years quashing all servers they pop up just to blow through theirs again
---
That's just... Wow!
---
The problem is the difference in speed at which players consume the content, you have level 40 players who want blizz to slow down and you have level 60 players who basically only can progress their character by raiding one night each week.
---
You can play the game just for the social aspect but for most people wow is not the only option for social interaction and without in-game progression most people are going to slowly lose interest and spend less and less time playing the game.
---
I personally feel like I have seen all phase 1 has to offer and I probably just put wow on the back burner until they release the battlegrounds.
---
If i toll to far behold ill just quit the game. I really dont want to quit, but IRL stuff is more important. Currently speaking as a lvl 53 warrior who feels like i already play more than i should because i enjoy the game so much. Please dont rush content and lose more players for the once who cant play as much and gets behold theor friends who have no job, not much IRL friends or a girlfriend. Thank you blizzard.
---
If that's the case then make the dungeon finder accessible only at cities lol..
---
Thanks for your input! I have tried to use both addons independent from eachother. I reinstalled wow and only added healcomm. Still Not working tho :(
---
Ive hit 60 in the weekend as a very casual player. And im trying to farm pre raid gear but everyone is busy raiding every night on my server, it takes an average of 2-3 hours to get a tank. Not even joking. I can get 1 or 2 dungeons done a day because it takes 2-3 hours to find a grp, or make one and then another 2-3 to run it, since people fuck up and go afk all the time
---
Yes this is new, if you haven't been on here for the last 12 hours or bothered scrolling through the front page :)
---
Tank paladins are like enha shamans, useless
---
As much as I feel for the super casuals that don't have 1 or 2 days a week where they can sink hours into the game, I don't feel blizz is rushing anything.  
---
P2 is still scheduled for end of year which is fine. Anyone who doesn't reach 60 within about 2 months is also unlikely to be anyone who will have 3-4 hours of uninterrupted game time to do a raid 2-3 times a week. So if you're a super casual, the high end stuff doesn't really affect you that much.  
---
I barely hit 60 this week as someone who's married and working a full week. I do however have much more time than someone with kids so at least I have that.   
---
Also gotta remember that all the "new" stuff, has already been experienced many many years ago and even the leveling part is made a lot easier because of general knowledge of the game from any expansion.   
---
Blizz will likely keep phases on a standard schedule unless they notice a huge huge problem with people either not being 60 (unlikely) or majority of people being 60 and starting to log on less and less.   
---
Left this for last because it's gonna get a lot of hate but I also prefer BC so rather they ran through classic and released their 2nd secret project: BC so teh classic dudes can stay here and BC players can move on to the sweet spot of WoW history.
---
There's no "correct" way to do it. You're leveling *extraordinarily* slowly but if that's how you want to play the game, enjoy yourself man.
---
So you are saying that is ok if companies from other countries come into our country and break the law? Blizzard did literally nothing wrong accept follow the law, I guess it's blizzards fault and the liberal communists who run China.......
---
Miks scrolling battle text has a function that does that (it pops up for a short time). I know you can program events like that in tellmewhen or weakaura as well, but you have to define those events yourself.
---
ProcAlert might be the out of the box solution if that is all you want from your addon.
---
I don't know if you level in a steady pace then you are 60 by now. You just have to know how and where to level.
---
I will respec at 60 anyway because spirt tap is most likely not needed anymore.
---
Wonder if blizzcon will be fun and their reaction in person lmao, there better be questions asked directly
---
Will I get banned for saying "Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age." in global chats?
---
I figure this wouldn't be the case with a friend or two.  
---
Completely solo I support your sentiment.
---
I couldn‚Äòt agree more... I started my Classic journey for two reasons. To play with friends and have fun in PvP ... I was really disappointed after I noticed that there wont be BGs or any real PvP content for quite some time. Just get phase 2 out there asap. Btw I am only level 30 and propably wont hit 60 this year but I would just love some PvP content to brighten up the grind.
---
Strongly disagree! I am a ret paladin and on occasion I will heal to help the group/save time waiting for a proper healer. So by your logic I can't need on a item that is a upgrade because I am a healing? Naa do one mate. Your obviously just spitting your dummy out cause you didn't get the gear you wanted üòÇ
---
Give hearthstone a shot bro
---
Why explain when the internet can do it for me: https://www.engadget.com/2010/01/13/drop-chance-probability/
---
Only one way to find out.
---
Does your healcomm work with blizzard frames ? Aka, is it at all working ? :) 
---
From my experience healcomm works with quite a bit of different ui mods.
---
Whats the FoV in degrees?
---
Uninstalled and unsubscribed. Might not be much, and I don't care if it even makes an impact. I can't keep supporting a huge company that acts on a behalf of a dictatorship. 
---
I understand there are many companies that are morally corrupt and when I become aware I usually avoid them as much as possible. Every dollar not going to them helps
---
Are we a political sub now?
---
Also, what are some good Warrior macros to simplify tanking a bit?
---
I never thought that Classic Wow isn't retail. However I am still confused as to how your message is in any way being helpful other than maybe implying there there are no stat weights - which I would find hard to believe.
---
Daaaamn, love it, big gratz!
---
That's like me rolling on prot stuff cause I can say I'm more arms than fury
---
Enjoyed the content but could not finish because of this. In the long run, the cut-to-black was almost physically painful.
---
Hard to catch a reference you weren't alive for.
---
Still a shit thing to do.
---
Spot on.
---
Play a warlock and LAUGH ur ass off ar rogues. I remember rogues as OP too, but god damn they die in 1 shadowbolt and some dots. I had so many rogues open on me, even had a 60 full prebis rogue open on me at 58 and all i did was: Sac, Coil, dot, fear, dot dot, shadowburn. Dead. Rogues are good vs melee but they suck a fat dick vs any ranged or caster.
---
Lmao I love this comment.
---
Exact same here, quit after they announced Cata, gave BFA a try and didn't last the month.  
---
Resubbed on stress test day and having a blast once again.  
---
Made new friends, have a constant leveling buddy, people /w me for dungeon heals and I have ppl in guild or on friends list to /w for tanking or dps roles.  The social network, as it should be.  
---
Even started an alt group, I bear tanked RFC and my leveling partner, a lock main, healed on his shammy.  
---
For all I care they might as well delete all post-LK content.  
---
This is the game I fell in love with and I'm having such a good time!  
---
Also my priest main is 55 and I'm off work until next Thursday, so lvl60 here I come!!!
---
No, there were several patches during Classic (versions 1.0 to 1.12). The first expansion (The Burning Crusade) came later with patch 2.0 and invalidated all previous content (even the hardest obtainable rewards were suddenly useless), but that didn't happen in any of the content patches (1.0 to 1.12) during Classic/Vanilla.
---
So Blizzard is only recreating the original content patches, so that they don't release all Classic content at once.
---
We are not the target audience. Twitch-drones and Asmongold are.
---
I think you're are vastly over-estimating how gated raids will be.
---
For most guilds it's going to be hard enough to fill that 40 man requirement without pugs, unless you're trying to get into one of the top 3ish guilds on your server and are trying to hit records nobody will really care what kind of healer you are because a healer is a healer and the content isn't even difficult anyway.
---
So you think that Blizzard slightly improving their product in response to (implicitly, according to you,) their superior competition releasing a new version of their product is the same thing as one business literally physically destroying another business in response to competition?  
---
I feel like you do not understand how analogies work.
---
If you always run around with two friends you still wouldn't need all this healing power when you could do dps instead. But i am not saying levelling up in healing spec is not possible, it has been done before. But if it's fun is up to you.
---
yep it is too expensive, the game is incredibly old and I don't play retail
---
Use frost spells. Mobs will never touch you
---
They did **not** try to bring it back to the early times with WoD. It was the first and last expansion to be intended for a one year expansion release shedule similar to how Fifa and CoD get released. You can look up interviews from around 2013 and 2014 and you will see that it was their aim to get yearly expansions. How were garrisons used to bring back the early times? It was intended as a nod to a housing system that never made it into the game before and even that failed as it apparently took so much development time that they centered everything around it. You didn't even need to leave your garrison except for raiding and ashran pvp.
---
The only thing remotely close to the "early times" was the "unknown and savage world" to be discovered in the form of and uncorrupted draenor. All the warlords except had been dead in lore for years and  Horde and Alliance were actively working together all the time, which is why ashran makes almost no sense.
---
 It's generally agreed upon by the community that WoD is the worst expansion (followed by BFA for now), because it offered no incentive to do anything in draenor outside of raiding and instanced PvP. Meanwhile  WoD raiding has been regarded as one of the best experiences ever in this game.
---
This is such a lie. A level in an hour and a half is not possible in 30-40 range without going pretty hard on it and taking perfect routes.
---
Stonespine has a good faction ratio and feels very busy, but without any queues. Good pick.
---
Or maybe he's just making an assesment. As a priest myself, I tend to agree. One class/spec has to be the easiest to play, and I think Shadow is definitely a contender for that title.
---
Arms warriors don't worry about dispells or mitigation, because they kill their target so fast it won't even matter.
---
+ started to happen to me as well.

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dferza/wtt_gold_on_golemagg_to_mirage/). 
---
Does this just increase the fov? 
---
If that is the case i didnt know that you could do that. It sounds like a massive advantage in pvp situations
---
It shaves a whole second? Hmm
---
Please not Caverns of Time... they should just stay away from everything that has even the slightest to do with time lines, time travel, time whatever, Garrosh
---
Besides that I prefer to play my character in his time, not some disguised char in a different time line doing something that already happened or will be already have happened... That just messes with my immersion.
---
Time to crack a cold one
---
Agreed. You essentially disengage, stealth, rez healer so that they can mass rez
---
Mograine, Ashbringer or Zandalar Tribe all very good servers with great faction balance.
---
Not working at all sadly. I actually want to use blizzard frames. Addon shows while in character Selection, but there is no configuration tab in the interface option
---
That's just some good banter :)!
---
&gt;	xD
---
&gt;Shamans are weird. A lot of their power comes from under the hood, and you really have a very small toolkit as a healer compared to druids and priests. Your bread and butter is totems, but because you have four totems, most of what an individual totem does can seem underwhelming or mercurial. You're kind of like a good luck charm - everything is just better with a Shaman in your party, even if you're not quite sure why.
---
I'm at SM on my Shaman (ENH spec) at the moment, and the healing so far is on-par with what a priest can do. You lack a HoT apart from Healing Stream totem, but to be honest you don't really need one, as you main healing spell is quite mana-efficient.
---
The main advantage of the shaman is how broad your toolkit actually is. There's a totem for every situation, and your spells are quite well-fleshed out as you can interrupt casters, slow runners, all while losing no real healing power.
---
I use ultra wide and it's actually already a little frustrating - great for immersion but I always miss chat stuff because I kinda have to turn my head to see it...
---
Its a matter of taste I suppose. As a huge fan of the Warcraft RTS' I always loved going back to some of those moments in history, so much nostalgia for me.
---
I also loved getting the human animations to get a short departure from Night Elf males terrible casting animation :P
---
They're pissed you're rolling on gear for a role you aren't performing in the group.  That's ninjaing, you scumbag.
---
He assumed they just had 4 legs, never noticed the extra pair
---
Wife telling me what i can and cannot do? Fuck that.
---
Beginning is hard, but with your frost tool kit nothing should ever come close enough. 
---
Though remember, you are a glass cannon (to be fair my warrior also feels like one ATM)
---
lol ass
---
I'm leveling my warrior , arms dps for now until 60. This is how my talents look right now.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/0230502133251-0501
---
I think i fucked up with the 1 point in fury for the 8% chance to gen rage. Other than that, I want to go to mortal strike. Should i get 1 Improved hamstring, and 2 deflection? 
---
After mortal strike, what should i be aiming for?
---
That is the way I see it too. Of course it is not right to just roll for that shit when it is not your role. 
---
It is just not a nice Thing to do - People want their loot. 
---
But it is also not correct what OP states in his title and "regardless of talents/gear" is very wrong too. 
---
I guess he knows that but is just a bit salty that he lost his loot. Which is understandable.
---
Still I strongly disagree with OP - as he does with me
---
I tried it multiple time on princess and every single time she just ignored the stealth and came right at me to slap my face
---
The quest allows you to skip the Graveyard. But the other wings need at least one visit, and the reward for handing in the quest is quite good.
---
I recommend berserker stance swap, intercept swap, immune taunt and weapon swap macros.
---
Berserker:
---
# showtooltip Berserker's Rage
---
/cast [nostance:3] Berserker Stance
---
/cast Berserker's Rage
---
/cast [nostance:2] Defensive stance
---
Same macro for intercept.
---
Taunt immune:
---
# showtooltip Challenging Shout
---
/use Limited Invulnerability Potion
---
/cast Challenging Shout
---
Weapon swap:
---
/eq [noworn:two-hand,nomod] name-of-your-2H
---
/equipslot [worn:two-hand] 16 name-of-your-MH
---
/eq [noworn:shield,nomod] name-of-your-Shield
---
no it isnt lol, it just allows people other than fucking mages farming ZF or warlocks/hunters farming mara to earn gold. only 3 classes in the game can earn raw gold for time efficiently.
---
Hard question. As a kid I couldn't decide which to pick because I thought the leftover one would be sad :(
---
You do realize that what you are asking for is in the game already? Exceot that its not only available in cities but is available at only certain locations? What do you think the summoning stones do in classic? They put you in a queue with others who have done the same and assembles your group auromatically
---
Damn you sound like a douche from the ninja loot thread.
---
Hope you realize you have been a moron and will apologize and start acting like a non-retard.
---
Anyone know if there‚Äôs a horde equivalent for this type of quest/reward rep grind?
---
Funny, 30-40 was much harder for me than 40-50. Currently 48
---
That makes a whole lot of sense, actually.
---
Youre breathtaking
---
This is the easiest way by far. I'm pulling Rotgrip from the bridge behind Tinkerer. My dots does all the work for me while I'm on my way to Princess. This time I was just being greedy for the soul shard.
---
I just gave in and play like 12 hours a day when I'm not working. No regrets, enjoying the crap out of it.
---
man I'm still at lvl 27 on my priest, 16 rogue, and 11 wl.. I just don't have the time.
---
iirc it was confirmed to be 1.0% in classic? Not sure though
---
&gt; People are trying to bring politics into video games
---
Have you been living under a rock? The vast majority of video games have some kind of direct or underlying message about certain subjects which by definition makes them political. Some of the more obvious examples are games like The Devision or Far Cry.
---
I like it how it is
---
I'd say it's a rule for almost everything in life: those who are doing more than you are people with less responsibilities  or with an unhealthy obsession and those who are doing less than you are slobs not taking things seriously who shouldn't complain about anything ever.
---
IT'S SO SIMPLE  and you explained it very well
---
I‚Äôm mounting your mom
---
I got butter all over my hands god damn it
---
Not really offended, just a bit baffled with your response as it wasn‚Äôt really answering the question. All you had to say was ‚Äòit‚Äôs a bad idea because of x y and z‚Äô which is what is what I asking. Not sure how telling me ‚ÄòGo tO rEtAil‚Äô is really answering that lol.
---
If you're not finding enjoyment in the process, then yeah you're leveling the wrong way.
---
How cute
---
Casts polymorph
---
Yes exactly. If it has been communicated. 
---
OP said though - "If you go to a dungeon as a healer, don't roll on tank/dps gear. Level 58 Paly healing UBRS won this."
---
As well as in a comment: "regardless of talents/gear you have"
---
Which is just wrong
---

Fuck you, sir or ma'am, and congratufuckinglations.

- salty fuck
---
&gt; Dire Maul SHOULD HAVE been released at launch or 1.1. It's delay had nothing to do with progression as it wasn't any tiers of progression higher than existing dungeons released at launch.
---
False.  Dire maul was not available at release and came out approx 3 months afterward.  The items in Dire Maul are significantly better than a lot of items in the game pre-Dire Maul.  Having DM in the game early makes raids even more trivial than they already are.
---
&gt; which means we have been playing a late-development version of the game WITH the changes to caster stats, but WITHOUT the complete set of loot that contains those stats
---
Which is the point...
---
&gt; People seem to forget that in Vanilla, the release of Dire Maul was rather confusing and head-scratching, as it seemed to be just another fresh-lvl-60 dungeon at a time when everyone was beginning to get epics from crafts and raids.... i.e. when Dire Maul first came out, it was considered to be released TOO LATE
---
Incorrect, the vast majority of people were not 60 before DM came out in vanilla.
---
&gt; If you talk to EU players, all this uproar is confusing, bc to them Dire Maul is perfectly on schedule with their Vanilla experience as EU servers launched a few months later than NA, but Dire Maul was released at the same time there as it was on NA .... which means even Blizzard did not see any reason Dire Maul needed to be postponed until 3-4 months into the game.
---
Again incorrect.  As an EU player the release of DM next week is still far too early when compared with the timeline we saw in vanilla.  
---
Fact is Blizz shoulda stuck to the plan.  The reasoning they gave about needing the content is ridiculous when most people aren't even 60.  Plus even if you are 60 there's plenty of shit to do in the game currently.
---
This would be amazing imo. Very well thought out plan. Love how they lead into each other lore wise.
---
I won't be surprised if they start rushing stuff to save the player base because I imagine a large portion of it is gone already.
---
I mean I dont think the China market mattered 15 years ago so it would be hard to say either way.
---
Yeahhh they play warrior, they‚Äôre just talking out of their ass.  Literally two pieces of pre-BiS for fury warriors comes out of DM, will report back on prot gear.
---
Roger
---
Like noone ever was...
---
just get a pvp raptor
---
Until you find out it‚Äôs bugged and corrupted redpath won‚Äôt spawn and be disappointed like me :(
---
Wait, how do you arrange them in line?
---
I think it would be fine, if:
---
- You weren't automatically teleported to the dungeon
---
- You weren't randomly placed in a group but rather pick a group to join
---
Basically it should be more like advertisements that are posted in a central LFG, and you can join for the spot you want (Tank/Heal/DPS) and if you meet the level requirement as set out by the advertiser. I wouldn't have an issue with it then as it solves chat spam and still requires walking to the instance and picking a group you like.
---
You could've gained at least half a level in the time it took you to cook up that essay.
---
Actually this whole thread makes me wanna go out and farm some low level casuals right now.
---
couldnt agree more..
---
i am watching streamers like asmon gold complaining about saying "to release more content or ppl will get bored"
---
meanwhile im over in tanaris trying to finish quests there and about to hit 49. I play for hours everyday and pull all nighters on the weekend.. still, i am not even lvl 60. Slow the fuk down. not everyone reads lvling guides and exploits the game to hit 60 right away. Plus, we have jobs now, go the gym, have girlfriends etc
---
You need to pay for it. 900g same as your race mount
---
Oh no, a multibillion dollar company making a few less billions in a capitalistic society, how sad. With how fucking greedy companies have gotten I have no sympathy for them whatsoever.
---
&gt;You can tank, but it's difficult
---
Actually it's not all that more difficult than as a warrior at that level.
---
I did the Jaguars on pservers which was great, however in classic the drop rate seems substantially lower, spent a good deal of time there too thinking it was just bad rng.
---
I know this sounds cringe but I enjoy a really nice sunset in WoW

TecHnIcAly I DiDnt lIE. SoIrOlL oN WhaTEveR I wAnT.
---
You might nit have lied, but yoi weren't honest either. Dick move.
---
This is nothing to do with retail.  Diremaul drops are far better than other dungeon drops and so it significantly affects most classes prebis.  The whole reason player feedback made blizz not include DM at launch was because of this.
---
1. Might be a thing but mostly i only have problems getting in groups when there is a rogue group leader. I am on a rp server and tha may change the experiance.
---
2. Rogue have loads of utilety and CC. 2 hard stuns an 2 more interupts kick and gouge. And there is sapp and blind all tho it is rearly needed.
---
3. Most dungeons i have done. I will only fall of on dps in realy bigg pulls but if i have adrenalin rush and blade flury. Its usualy no one hwo can keep upp. I do use a lot of thistle tea and stuff and play  human whit swords and that helps a lot. If you use tea on blade flury pulls when rush is down your dps i still really good.
---
Yess yess i know some one will fed cancer from reading this. 
---
Sorry about the grammar/spelling.
---
Scumbag steve
---
you‚Äôre tellin me this what i was missing when i saw that duskwood was under attack. damn, that sounds like fun too.
---
"In regards to melee weaving, is there a one button macro that switches to melee attacks when in melee range and ranged attack when you are outside of melee range?"  
---
Not that I know of at least, but I'm keeping my macro play pretty light, so it may be possible.
---
Did you even read... i know the stones are there. And locks are rare on my server not exactly a reliable option.
---
You could give dual spec a one time fee to be paid at your trainer to unlock it at level 60. Like 200 or 300g or something. In that way it will still be a gold sink but only worth getting for players that respecc all the time
---
Pop evasion, you'll get it sooner.
---
Server exclusive is how it was originally, in TBC or whenever it was introduced and that already broke a lot of social aspects of the game.
---
SAY NO TO DUNGEON FINDER.
---
Could this be converted to an overpower macro?
---
Fucking boomers.
---
&gt; The rate of gold being created in the economy won't change much.
---
Oh my sweet summer child.
---
It‚Äôs much faster to go rotgrip first. With herbalism and mining I‚Äôm on 10-11 min
---
I have 10 days and I just hit lvl 60 on my rogue. 
---
So yah whatever you‚Äôre doing is definitely inefficient but whether that‚Äôs ‚Äúwrong‚Äù is subjective.
---
At more then 10 points weapon skill difference, the first 1% hit you get is ignored. I think.
---
I already said this at the start of the lfg crying.. we need a system because the lfg and world and trade chat spamming isnt working. There need to be an addon that let me list my group with a description added by me and others can browse it and /w for inv. Every channel is destroyed by the "brd arena run" etc 2-3 guy spamming it and most of the players are left or not even use the lfg channel anymore because of that.
---
How is it fun to one hit ppl? Doesnt it feel like playing a shooter with aimbot or to commit roadkill? I love pvp but would never kill anyone far below my lvl. You are free to do whatever you want but does this make you happy? I would only feel pathetic
---
&gt; Dire Maul isn't a big deal
---
It kinda is though.
---
&gt;  and it doesn't mean that they're going to release all the content in less than a year.
---
No one is even saying this.
---
Warrior doesn't stand a chance if a rogue knows what he's doing and is specced accordingly. The rogue can counter anything a warrior does and there isn't a scenario in which it would be a straight up melee fight. Either the warrior would be stunlocked, or deadzoned, or the rogue will have vanished.
---
Right, I didn't get from your earlier comments that you have some/most of your spells keybound, my bad. I just find it strange that you use both Shift and Alt modifiers, but not use easy to hit keys like QERF. But then again, keybinds are personal preference...
---
Anyway, I haven't played Paladin in Classic (some TBC, but mostly WotLK and Cata), but looking through the spells they have now, I'd probably bind 2+ ranks HL and FoL, some/all Blessings, some Seals, maybe some Auras, all utility cooldowns (BoF, BoP, DP, DS, DI, LoH, BoSac), Judgement, Cleanse, Turn Undead (+ Shift modifier for mouseover), HoJ (+ Shift modifier for mouseover), 2+ ranks of Cons, HoW, mount, maybe RF, maybe Exor and HW, maybe Redemption and then obviously the spells depending on talent spec. So for me those 15 plus the two on my mouse wouldn't be enough. :)
---
People need to stop with this entitled "main spec priority" crap. Yes, that's perfectly fine in Guild groups and Raids. In a normal dungeon, the healer should take both healing and DPS items and vice versa, just like Tanks can take off spec items. There is no "rule" about what items you can take, only a rule against ninja'ing. A need roll is a need roll, no main spec priority exists.
---
Warlock is spellpower spellpower and then more spellpower. Warrior is get hit cap then focus on crit and attack power. Not really a specific stat weight as there are already lists of bis item you can look at and see what stats they have.
---
Me doing this is all from a memory in vanilla where the role was reversed, and i was apart of the skull kill - and its easily one of my best WoW memories. 
---
People can have the stance they want - but the point of placing in rules on myself is to make it an experience for me and others. The walking and only aggressing when im on them fit perfectly with the graveyard scene.
---
I could tell these guys were freaking when they first saw me.
---
 I could tell they were proud as fuck (rightly) when they made thier dash from the catacomb with that intelligent sap - beforehand they had time to plan a strategy since i walked, and they did. 
---
Then when they made the decision to defend thier groupie, and all the other allies came in, that will easily be a WoW memory that will stick with them. They downed the Tauren of Raven Hill.  
---
The primary group of players I discuss above genuinely enjoyed this. When they killed me there was no gloating my them or the other allies that joined in. When i ressed i clapped, and they /cheer - /cheer isnt something you do when you are gloating from bitterness, they were literally happy about the kill. 
---
 Its not me running out there, chasing them down, and killing them (which im not attacking but is definitely a more one sided fun). 
---
Its to create an experience - i saw the amount of allies there, i knew from the start they'd have more than a good chance of killing me, and it actually happened which was amazing. 
---
Like it or hate it, the majority here see the amusement from it.
---
Ok
---
Mods are doing a great job of corralling the off topic enraged keyboard warriors, for the most part. Knowing the attention span of these epic gamers they'll find a new thing to be pissed about in a few days, just wait it out.
---
Until then continue to expect bad faith comments because these americans need to fulfill their white savior complex.
---
Meh, he did nothing wrong, lawyer up. If your worried about a healer stealing shadow bag boots bring a different class....
---
100% agree, this early release is a bad fucking idea.
---
Thats a solid 20g in vendor prices right there
---
To catch them
---
Is there anyway to turn this off? Every time I log in it‚Äôs CONSTANTLY RAINING
---
You are retarded.
---
Ah shit, here we go again.
---
lmao get over it
---
Learn to see the world in shades of grey, and not this black and white.
---
It really depends on the situation.   If the healer advertised as a healer, joined as healer, he should indeed not roll on other gear.
---
But if the healer is really dps and only joined after getting asked, "can you please please please heal for us, we can't find a healer" and he reluctantly  agreed, I would say it's ok for him to roll on the gear for the role he really wants to be. 
---
communication is key, like always
---
&gt;Until then continue to expect bad faith comments because these americans need to fulfill their white savior complex.
---
Today i learned i'm an american

Huntress\*
---
Zandalar tribe have a pretty good alliance community. Helpfull and kind, and world chat is just a big troll fest mostly so its pretty good.
---
We demand more toxic talk in general chat. We asked blizzerd for ( no changes ) to keep the original vanilla.  but we the ones who change and talk maturity now. We used to be savage back then .... MORE TOXIC TALK .. please
---
So if you have been having constant 1v1s against a  rogue, mage or warlock it's worth it to gimp your dmg so you can break sheep - blind or seduce, meaning you can stop their reset/set up.

Druids have a downside in those long dungeons (brd!) as they don't have a normal ressurect. Shouldn't be a problem in most cases and if you have another hybrid, it isn't any at all, but still, some groups might prefer a different class instead.
---
Been a glitch since '04, hardly a first.
---
Strength also increases block amount, which in turn helps mitigation, and still generate a bit of rage. Strength and agility are both important stats to tank, especially because you have (as a warrior) a button to guarantee blocks that you should press on cd.
---
Plate with shield, with mostly preraid bis, reaches 56% mitigation in my case (it mostly varies between 53 and 58% in similar preraid cases). it should be a goal not to drop below 50% with shield equipped. Online guides usually set a goal of "no more than 2 non-plate items", and suggest that one of them be the savage gladiator chestpiece.
---
Horde underdog? When has that ever happened outside of pve
---
Wait. I thought ‚Äúcatering to casuals‚Äù ruined the game the first time around.
---
So brave, they should award medals to freedom fighters like you who have the balls to really stick it to the oppressive man like that. Those darn free speech hating capitalists are censoring your right to feel like you're helping by spamming twitch chat and the LFG channel, down with them!
---
You did, but it's also not a big deal, because Cruelty is the only talent in the first 10 points that you need 5/5 in. The rest are pretty optional. The bigger issue is that you're delaying MS until 46 with this build, but if you're willing to put up with that, then it's whatever.
---
I've never quite understood the appeal behind Improved Hamstring. I'd consider Improved Charge over it, then if you want it, taking one point in Improved Hamstring.
---
I'm planning on [something like this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/023250213425100001-55000131023) for my final build, although the guide I was originally following had said [to do this.](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/023250213305100031-55000131005) Either way, there's literally no need to respec to get out of Unbridled Wrath.
---
Except he didn‚Äôt say yes. If you mean to reserve something lay that down first.
---
Free country
---
I mean this was obvious as fuck.  What wasn't obvious was if it would be initially free or not.
---
By that you mean you like searching a person made chat which is spammed by people and where blizzard won't take any actions against them?
---
there are specific stat weights.
---
Nope easiest way is to go to sfk and spam on that unkillable mob just after that door that needs opening.
---
Why even bother replying a random thing that isn't in the game options?
---
Holy shit youre a moron
---
Legit was in a raid tonight, full pre-bis  2400 aimed shot crits on the reg, huge multi shots, etc... every hunter in my run is multi shot lying the second the warrior grabs aggro trying to compete for dps, and it‚Äôs annoying because they‚Äôre making it impossible for me to dps, if they multi too early then I‚Äôm just gonna grab aggro on every shot that crits... annoys me because they fee great about their high dps but I‚Äôm having to feign death everytime I attack, it‚Äôs like being punished for being the only one trying to play smart rather than just blasting it the second tank gets aggro
---
...move the chat?
---
Tanks are in high demand, and as a healer, I've had a lot of good experiences with bears. At least they don't tank in berserker stance with a 2 hander ;)
---
I was kinda thinking the same thing. I know the stat priority, but idk the weights, is +2 healing power better than +10 int?
---
I think the mount was basically a reskin/rehash of either raptors or plainstriders, and while they did a good job on the reskin, they just left the footprints as is.
---
I like this. I would even like the group finder from retail in classic. As long as it doesn't teleport you to the dumgeon and give you the option to teleport back, it shouldn't be a negative thing for the game at all. But i'm a fan of the billboard idea.
---
Apologies on the incorrect figure for the EU &gt; DM gap, I just used what /u/MkVIIaccount used and didn't look it up myself, so you are right on that one.  
---
Though, it still doesn't change the fact that the _original_ Vanilla went 14 weeks without Dire Maul. That's two of three of the release regions.
---
You already don't need the city to get groups. World is global and flooded with lfg/lfm posts.
---
Really, this is sn arbitrary hill to die on.
---
I can't stand it when people radically undercut things that are already selling. I was happily selling stacks of Superior Healing Pots for 45S 3 days ago and now they're not even worth putting on AH because instead of undercutting me by a couple silver like sensible people my competitors put them up for 25S per stack and the price started falling from there instead. Fucking idiots.
---
Take my upvote coz I agree whole heartedly
---
That moment when you stand in the middle of a genocide and search for stuff to kill
---
Afaik for fleshlight (hrhrh love this typo) you always use max rank thanks to spell power %. Thanks for the read
---
Absolute shit quality but here it is: [Hero takes down Vael](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OScCyzgF0So) 
---
Epic!
---
Quest for thousand needles. I just did this quest yesterday.
---
you need to understand that phase 2 adds extremely low amount of PVE content. Dire maul is like 1-10 hours of content. The world dragons will be highly contested and add 1-2 hours of content per week at most.
---
I'm confused. If most comments seem to not get the joke, how is it so highly upvoted? Are people actually so salty about rogues that they upvote without getting it? :D
---
Wanna level an alt where the main focus is gold making now, once DM comes out and in future phases. Which class works the best for it? I'm thinking mage or hunter now but I have no experience with gold making in classic as I haven't played private servers. What's the best class for gold making throughout all classic WoW and what method? (outside of flipping or playing AH and stuff like that) Thanks!
---
because if he said "level 58 ret pally here for full ubrs" he'd be laughed at. nobody wants that garbage in their group
---
If your heart is still set on another character then I think it‚Äôs best to re-roll!
---
Good post. But to assume blizzard dont know this is naive. Telling blizzard ‚Äúnot everyone is 60‚Äù is naive. 
---
They will be fully aware of percentages of each level and how fast they should release content. 
---
In terms of wow classic, for the moment I trust Blizzards speed
---
It's a demon in disguise. Wanders the Un'Goro crater. For the Hunter epic weapon Quest.
---
It won't be over in the almost-vanila form until TBC is added on it (even tho I loved that expansion. it put an end to vanilla instances pretty fast). I was kinda expecting them to release classic with everything in it at once (Naxx and AQ), and just sit still for years. For a lvl 40 the state of endgame content shouldn't matter much, you'll get there eventually anyway. And to go to Naxx/BWL you still need some gear so it's probably not feasible to skip/abandon easier raids. Lots of people want pvp right now and Blizz is making them wait so long, it seems.
---
You are right. I shouldn't judge the whole class because of 3 guys. Most of the time Paladins are ok.
---
https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-addons/trinketmenu/
---
Except its trash no one uses.
---
OP should just use ClassicLFG. This sub can't discuss these topics because there are too many folks butthurt you'll ruin the game by playing how you want.
---
Just a small formatting tip, four spaces before a line will let you create what the site calls code blocks, and they're what you'll see other people using to share macros. Example:
---
    #showtooltip Berserker's Rage
---
    /cast [nostance:3] Berserker Stance
---
    /cast Berserker's Rage
---
 /cast [nostance:2] Defensive stance
---
Are you having fun?
---
If yes - then you're levelling correctly.
---
People who never played warrior and have no sense of humor ITT
---
Just introduce a 5 min cool down in the LFG channel that will encourage people to scroll up and see what‚Äôs groups are available anyway
---
No, but I know I will put you on ignore.
---
Again, missing the point.
---
Ignore that kind of players, and find better people who know what they are doing.  
---
On the first day of paladin school they give you a robe and say: ' embrace this robe as it is what you will be wearing throughout your paladin career.'
---
Communication is key
---
This is how I do pure fire.
---
Talent priority is longer ranged fireballs, then more fire damage faster. Gear priority is more fire damage.
---
The first thing is you need to structure fights. Go to a safe distance and watch the mobs. Then answer these questions.
---
First, what needs to be sheeped ?
---
Second, what dies first ? What dies second ?
---
Your basic rotation should be sheep opener, then fireball, then another fireball as it gets closer, then maybe fireblast, then frost nova if necessary to keep it off you, then back up. and assess.
---
Is it about to die ? Then wand for a bit.
---
Does something need to be re-sheeped ? Then break it with a wand and re-sheep.
---
Has it got lots of life left ? More fireballs and fireblast.
---
Once it's all dead, have a look and re-assess what needs to be sheeped, what dies first and what dies next.
---
From the look of it, you arent polymorphing stuff enough, and I'd guess your gear has too much int, too much spirit, not enough stamina and not enough fire damage.
---
Oh, and stock up on healing and mana potions. You die from running out of hit points, and when you run out of mana you have less damage output than a priest.
---
NB if in groups, add 'what do I need to do to stay under the tank's threat limit' between 'What needs to be sheeped' and 'What dies first'. Otherwise, mobs to the face are bad, mkay ?
---
They're already rehashing wc3. Let's have some original content.
---
Unsubbed as well. Fuck Blizzard. They could have even just ignored the politics and made no comment on this without taking any action, but instead they treat him like a criminal by banning him and stripping him of his prize. Disgusting. Since when does an American ever chastise anyone supporting a country fighting for its independence and freedom? I can't believe the times we live in. Blizzard should be utterly ashamed.

The guy used his position in an esport competition as a platform to promote his political opinions, which was strictly forbidden by the rules he agreed to. He was punished. Am I supposed to be angry about this?
---
It's ClassicLFG but it doesn't put the group together or port you to the dungeon.
---
Definitely will discuss the loot ahead of time from now on.  Lesson learned.
---
No I think he meant using the Blizzard administered Chat which is used by People to advertise their Group and is usually not spammed by People because of the Report function and because Blizzard will take Action.
---
Are you not usign /LookingForGroup? Then it is your fault
---
&gt;/cast \[stance:1/2\] Berserker Stance; \[stance:3\] Berserker Rage  
---
I tried to change this for Pummel, but it doesn't work in defensive stance...?
---
You did lie. Lying by omission is a thing... 
---
Could have just said you'd heal for them, if you can still need as if you were DPS. Hell, I did that last night.
---
&gt; Lol why would anyone then go and heal a dungeon when their main spec is tank/dd?
---
because they beg you to come heal.  as a druid you should know this , don't you ever get asked for a role that you are not specialized in?
---
1. Make Water
---
2. Frost nova all mobs
---
3. Blizzard
---
4. ???
---
5. Profit
---
It shouldn't be that extreme but after you get blizzard so level 20+ or better 22+ with the right talents its quite easy maybe give us a look at your talent choices that would help maybe the devil lies there.
---
Thanks man!
---
Don‚Äôt use healbot lol. Use Vuhdo instead :) way more customisable
---
I'm using [the version in curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/trinket-menu). It hasn't been updated in 2 years but I find no trouble using it. Just make sure on your addons list you have checked the option to load out of date addons.
---
Why not both tho :P?
---
Ah see you're playing mage wrong. Mage is just the easy mode where you aoe farm all the way to 60.

Pretty cool, just a shame it's not realistic :(

What I think would be nice is:
---
Something like the auction house UI, but instead of items it lists players which can be sorted by their level, class, target dungeon, role, etc. Maybe even let players have a short description next to their name (i.e. 'Spellcleave'). Then you simply click on their name and invite to group.
---
You get it.

People are constantly talking as if games are interchangeable just because they're MMO's. It gives off this weird notion that there are people out there that are hardcore fans of the genre specifically, rather than the games themselves.
---
the constant MMO migration among MMOtubers is one of these symptoms and it just looks from the outside, like a lot of people with empty lives that should just pick up a book, call a friend or play another genre of game to get that same "fix".
---
Come again?

YAS. When it procs you see in the ground around you like a circle aura

You were misleading on porpuse. You could easily said that shadow talent +disc. But you tried to tell as little as possible to mislead them, people like you will be the reason everyone will start to ask for details so they can check talents. Hope they blacklisted you.

He argumenter for the exact same!
---
Blizzard never "said" any of what you imply. They punished a guy spouting political messages in an esports competition.
---
Or OP can download ClassicLFG
---
How can you 'not see' how it will be the death knell? It happened, it literally happened in front of every players eyes when they released LFD. It's not an opinion, it's a fact that it happens.
---
Why is it the first thing I thought of when reading "crackheads" was Asmongold? I didn't even get to the streaming part, just immediately Asmongold. What have I become that I think of him? I think I need to reevaluate some of my life choices now.
---
I actually clapped for you guys. I can't wait to re-experience this again!
---
Our first rag kill in vanilla was very similar and started off with a hunter accidentally pulling Rag by dropping a strawberry on his keyboard...
---
He pretty much snuck his way in as a healer in order to get DPS gear.  If I would have known, I would not have grouped with this guy.  This group took less than ten minutes to form, we were not desperate for a healer.
---
My question of the day: Why are the mods censoring references to what Blizzard is doing with Hong Kong? ([example](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dfeq3f/sending_a_message/))
---
I feel like "No real words politics or religion" doesn't make so much sense when the developers themselves are breaching this rule by censoring players.
---
If anything, this subreddit is now just applying the same censorship as Blizzard and effectively supporting them politically by locking every attempt at discussion about it.
---
What do you mean with being "done with the current content" ?
---

---
It's hilarious that so many people in this thread seem to think that they have an entitlement to control the price of a market and that anybody who competes is an idiot.
---
this guy knows :)
---
Thanks now ill have nightmares
---
it really depends on the situation.   My rule of thumb is.  A healer who joined the group as healer, (even if he is specced differently) should only roll on healing gear.
---
But a healer who did not join, but got asked  (BEGGED even, in many case)   , please please please come heal for us..  'no I am feral druid / ret paladin'  " doesn;t matter, just heal ok?"   ' hm, ok then'    should be able to roll for gear he really wants, because he never wanted to heal and is only doing it to help the group.
---
Yes it is working.
---
What isn't working is people who insist on other people do the hard work of tanking and healing.
---
You look like a moron for telling them to go back to retail. Especially when there's an addon for Classic that does what they want.
---
What's the best place to farm humanoids for silk? I'm level 38 right now
---
Gotta try harder man.
---
Ok then which of the three do you like least?
---
I don‚Äôt think it is the real deal I think it‚Äôs just adding unnecessary steps to an already simple process.
---
And never hit 60. Its one thing to have a few 30 alts. Into the 40s and 50s itll just stagnate
---
What monitor out of interest?
---
I wasn't AoE farming, just questing. It takes the roughly the same amount of time to kill 6 as it takes to kill one, and I'd been riding around looking for them. And there was no one to share with, no one was around and I hadn't seen anyone recently until the rogue popped out of stealth.
---
So what works for me is 
---
Wolf: keybind howl to mouse button on side of mouse and click everytime I aimed shot/on cooldown, send in when only one add is left in packs of adds, use as melee only on bosses that don‚Äôt aoe or curse nearby enemies
---
Talents: max fire resistance, max furious howl, max stamina, invest leftover points into either regular armor or melee ability if you think you‚Äôll actually use it (you‚Äôre pet will die a lot if you do)
---
Cat isn‚Äôt pheasible, I would suggest having a wind serpent in place of a cat for raid dps since it has a ranged dps ability, I would do the same thing that I suggested for furious howl, binding it to side of mouse button and using it on cooldown... this will do more damage than wolf in general. I use wolf because it buffs me, and so I bank on being put in groups to buff melee with my trueshot aura and with my furious howl, I use on aimed shot because if I can crit an aimed shot, then follow it up with a powered up auto shot it increases my dps over time in long fights by a lot
---
Hehe exact same spot I found my BoE epic. Spider &amp; Bear farming in WPL :P
---
Gratz on that ring! I got a Bloodrazor (45 epic MH sword)
---
Is my real test

I do not care for healing. Considering levelling my druid as feral.

---
I've always hated Reddit's formatting. Its such a PITA.
---
HEY GUYS HOWS IT DO?
---
Problem is Blizz is going to rush out content to appease the guys who nolifed it and are now bored.
---
MS&gt;OS was never a thing in regular dungeons. Only in 20+ raids and sometimes UBRS if communicated.
---
There's not really a wrong way to level, but you are leveling fairly slow. Even when taking into account your professions. There's not really a trick, you might just be killing mobs slowly and doing quests inefficiently.
---
Wait till you get up in levels and you go on a quest spanning crossing the continents.
---
Nothing. Keep classic how it is. There's a reason I haven't played retail since Cataclysm.
---
First I was like:  
---
*Maybe he just doesn't know it doesn't work for spells...*
---
But then I saw how he waited with rolling until it was clear if the others were in for another run. Once he didn't immediately need them anymore he selected need.
---
Would recommend ignoring and telling guild mates to do so as well.
---
Take a warrior to 60 so you can DPS or tank
---
It's like you're saying that a dpswarrior who goes along as a Tank can't roll for dps stuff.
---
Just because you go along as a tank doesn't mean that you're only that.
---
Same goes for healers obviously.
---
Right click target does this effectively
---
Considering the guy I replied to mentioned he wanted to "protest" in world chat sounds like he's another drone who pays Blizzard you so desperately despise.
---
Bothering English speaking people in a video game and on forums who are so far removed from the conflict is so laughably out of touch it's amazing liberal brainlets like you honestly think you're doing anything but alienating people from an important cause by associating it with the annoying, loud, obnoxious whiny gamer crowd.
---
In Capitalism, you get fucked. There is no ethical consumption under capitalism. If you're so concerned about human rights abuses and ethics you'd live in a hole in the dirt in a forest. The clothes you're wearing right now were probably made by a chinese sweatshop worker, but who cares right because china = bad. The food you eat and the coffee you drink are harvested by people working for slavery wages, if anything at all. 
---
If you're going to be a virtue signalling moral champion, fuck off and do it somewhere else mate.

A teletubbies game isn‚Äôt the place to try and recruit child soldiers for your glorious revolution. This isn‚Äôt a game and endangering the welfare of children is a serious offense.
---
Tbf I rarely get tipped for making food. Or get 10s for 60 water. Pain in arse.
---
Because of the money that comes from chinese players. Its not hard to understand at all. Blizzard has no moral compass.
---
That is incorrect. Its around 37-38. Mid 40s is halfway XP wise
---
RIP Stockades
---
Is there an addon that prompts me when someone is is inflicted with a dispellable debuff? As a priest it would really help me cast dispel magic/disease soon after the infliction instead of having to peek at player bars individually.

---
&gt;He literally said to have it so it DOESNT teleport you to the dungeon and yes it does, the summoning stone do for your group automatically.
---
This was added in TBC, not vanilla. So...?
---
No one uses the stones in Classic, they are useless.
---
I'm a hunter and I eat Rogues.
---
Unlucky for a 1üòÇ
---
I could be mis-remembering, but I think there was some stage where you would join a lfg type chat for each specific dungeon.   Then a simple /who in that channel showed their you name, class and level.
---
You still had to whisper to ask their spec (and see if they were still interested or had just forgotten to leave the channel), but at least you weren‚Äôt subjected to spam about dungeons way above/below your current level.
---
Even if I‚Äôm totally making that up, it‚Äôs what I‚Äôd like.   More specific lfg channels.  You just join the ones you‚Äôre interested in.
---
Im 37 with 7 days played. I wasted 2 days played helping someone catch up though
---
Dont think pvp is balanced in classic
---
windrunner's howling
---
I'm not sure myself, but apparently blizzard is reacting to people demanding more content already by releasing DM early. In my opinion, blizzard should look at the much larger wave of players that will reach level 60 in the coming month or two and plan their schedule around those instead of catering to the few that reached end game a few weeks ago and are already crying for more.
---
When you've played too much Risk Of Rain
---
to fucking early
---
most players haven't even seen endgame yet
---
Decoy Saurfang.
---
I really like how it is working right now. This sounds idiotic.
---
God damn
---
This isn't about individual developers, it's about the company itself. By "developers", I mean the company developing this game.
---
Basically, if Blizzard censors people to make more money in China, the best thing you can do is to lower their profits here in response, to show them that their customers don't support this decision. Voting with your money.
---
I'm not saying people working on classic are specifically bad or anything. But if a company is making political decisions to censor its players, you can't pretend there aren't politics in the game anymore.
---
Phase 2 is the most world altering change which will ever hit classic wow. When honor is introduced, people  who haven't reached 60 yet and alts will experience a world of pain.
---
Gonna look into that thank you very much.
---
But still something like that should just be implemented instead of heaving stone age ways to make groups.
---
Doesnt it go up to 10?
---
Mists of Pandaria was ok, brought back a lot of the feel lost in Cataclysm
---
Seems like an incentive to make people try harder and stop goofing off. Better ways to go about it for sure.
---
I don't know how good they are, but both the icy-veins and wowhead guides for Holy Paladins recommend using rank 4 and 6 of FoL and rank 6 and 9 of HL.
---
Okay I don't think you understand something here. If there is so many of you who haven't reached 60 yet, then once you guys reach it, you will team up and do it together! while the ones who are now 60 and already have Rag on farm will be doing BWL. Why do you want to slow down the others because you and many others are slow? You will have plenty of people to do MC and Ony with and progress in waves.
---
Of course it was. It's a generic rule for all group content. Unless you're like a shadow priest healing and you tell them you're Ms shadow and are rolling on that gear - in which the group can say yes or no to inviting you - then you roll on the role you are there for. That's how it has always been since original Vanilla.
---
PSA for all the people who have no clue how to find groups.  "/join world" literally everyone uses world chat, don't bother with lfg and trade chat.  Also, this is classic wow, get used to talking to people.
---
Damn, I would do this but my original 3 are all beaten up from two house moves :(  
---
Wish I woulda taken more care of them.
---
Respect
---
Yeah I know - I wrote "why would anyone THEN go and heal a dungeon when their main spec is tank/dd" referencing to his "they are not allowed to roll on gear besides heal gear then" trying to use it as an Argument.
---
I get asked that 24/7 which is why I say - why would anyone ever heal in that case if he is not even allowed to roll on gear for his main spec. 
---
We are trying to say the same. 
---
Why would I ever heal if I can't roll on DPS/Tank gear if that is my main spec. - I only heal because People Need healers and not because I like healing so much :P
---
I hate to break it to you but people are already aoe farming
---
Whats the one for horde rogues you mentioned?
---
So brave!
---
A tournament stream isn't a platform for someone's political agenda even if you agree with it.
---
Uh... you realize how many fewer healers and tanks there would be right?
---
&gt; Youre the tank, so you set the pace.
---
I mean that's only true up until the tank starts pulling when everyone is out of mana
---
Well how relevant do you think diremaul is? It gives small number of upgrades to pre-raid gear and makes nothing obsolete. In my opinion it should have been in the game from the start and doesn't count as "end game content release".
---
Nope as a rogue fighting a frost mage  without a potion of free movement is suicide. Honestly they kick your ass once you are in a frostnova and can't get out
---
Yes it does - it was tested and took about 9-10 reports in a short period of time. 
---
They will then get muted for a couple of minutes or hours or days depending on the frequency of their wrongdoings.
---
Guy with the sword is not level 22, lol.
---
Did you screamed in chat before ?
---
Id remove the WotLK. Thats where it started going downhill fast
---
What is a good opener against an arms warrior, really? I can't seem to be able to dish out enough damage with the standard stun locks.
---
He just told you most of it is some nice roleplay. Nothing wrong with that. And actually completely in accordance to gaming rules and RP.   
---
Also, red is dead.
---
Are you enjoying yourself? If you are, you are doing it right
---
Hey, I have a second account that I'll be unsubbing next month anyway. I'll be sure to leave scathing comments about Blizzard's stance on politics as my reason for unsubbing.
---
overpower? cant dodge,parry or block ?
---
If he spoke in defense of china on stage, he would've been banned just the same. What would happen then, people would praise blizzard and subscribe for a year ahead?
---
&gt; By that you mean you like searching a person made chat which is spammed by people and where blizzard won't take any actions against them?
---
That is not the description of /LookingForGroup 
---
What I wrote is the description of that. What channel are you referring to in your description then?
---
I have an easier rotation: PW:S&gt;SW:P&gt;Wand
---
It happens all the time on this sub. OP's first point is something I've seen debated countless times on this sub.
---
That name tho
---
then you finaly get a mob and when you have him at 30% respawn fucks your ass unlubed
---
Ok, this is how I do it now while levelling when I fight 2 mobs.
---
My pet tanks one which I hit with my ranged attack and in between I right click to melee hit the mob that I face tank.
---
I just thought there might be a fancier solution.
---
OP you are honestly the next MLK, jr. Future civilizations will erect statues of you as a result of the bravery displayed here.
---
post-60? You're not 60 anymore? How did you get past it, I see so many people stuck at 60
---
dont need horse riding skill huh
---
Blizzard is banning people for supporting Hong Kong democracy protests.
---
It's easy to brush off any criticism of anything you like by pretending that the world is a binary choice between "full-on unethical capitalism" and "live in a hole in the dirt in a forest".
---
It's actually not that simple. Companies make decisions based on profit, and if their customers show them that they want the company to be more progressive, the company will be. Blizzard has a big stake in China, but they're not _owned_ by China (yet). What people say here matters, and if enough people make it clear that it's unacceptable, Blizzard can very well change its strategy.
---
As mentioned in my previous comment, I don't like this cynical trend in gamer spaces of pretending that since the world is shitty, we might as well not care about anything and even be intentionally aggressive and mean. People can change things.
---
You don't. You use rank 1, rank 4 and rank 6.
---
Every business everywhere is about making money and staying in business. Complaining about that shows ignorance.
---
Ask? No, you tell them you are rolling especially of you're healing these dime a dozen mages.
---
Thank you for speaking up for the old head original players.
---
i am 59 and at 10 days played as a warrior but then i am done with professions totally 300 BS / 300 mining and 300 secoundary proffs.
---
the mining needed in order to get the mithril to get armorsmith alone was like 12 hours of playing. and the fishing was an other 16 hours and that is not counting the quest at 35. if i didn't spend all that time doing all that i would be looking at more like 7-8 days played.
---
No problem. Once you get used to how they're built, they're pretty simple and flexible, especially for a Druid.
---
nobody cares, keep politics out of video games
---
It was in the terms of the tournament, so, while I understand why he did it, I don't really think much less of blizzard for following their own terms
---
Sweet, mine is a Moonstalker, the trip was long but it was worth it, haven't seen any other hunter with those kind of cats on the Horde side, really want to level this cub to 60.
---
Be a dwarf. 
---
Have piercing howl. 
---
Stoneskin&gt;piercing howl&gt; get in range&gt; intercept &gt; 2 shot the mofo in intercept stun. 
---
Kkthxbye
---
Whitemane, but I will leave out any other info for now.  Until I see how this is really going to play out I don't want to out anyone. This was more a frustration post checking to see if this was a normal thing because I had never heard of it.
---
Woman AND a streamer.. Daaamn that's dangerous combinations. Double entitled to being served by us, the common plebs.
---
It‚Äôs on the front page and has 84k upvotes but tbf it doesn‚Äôt state mega thread it was just converted into one https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dez4yc/breaking_blizzard_entertainment_bans_pro/
---
lol did this guy swap server???
---
People are so mad about nothing in this game I don't get it... 
---
Are they just releasing all the Frustration they pile up in their real life through WoW?
---
I mean probably better than beating up his wife. But still not a nice Thing to do
---
I've yet to hit endgame, but throughout levelling I've acquired a full set of agility gear and a full set of intellect gear just through dungeons and quests, and I can fill any role needed. So I'd say just keep 2 sets of gear, upgrade where able, and you should be good
---
He actually saved you from trying lo lvl as sub rogue.
---
This.This is a retail bug .Mana burn and mana drain shouldnt worknin shapeshift!
---
So what you're saying is there are literally stat weights?
---
Youre an idiot. Let's take warlocks for an example
---
False numbers, but numbers.
---
1 spell crit = 10 spell power = 0.5 spell hit (till cap) = 35 int
---
That's weights. In your nonsense world, 2 spell power is better than 1 crit because higher number.
---
In the original game people progressed a lot slower and DM came out before anyone even killed ragnaros.
---
Lol for some reason I thought you meant where in the game world I was in, yeah, I'm in the US, east coast
---
&gt;A casual should be able to keep up gearing one character while hardcore players balance more than one.
---
Imagine being so narcissistic and delusional that you think other players should level countless twinks until _you_ cought up and _thats_ when its time for new content.
---
Why do you think retail has such an option because looking for groups in chat sucks honestly the group making options ("not meaning dungeon finder") in retail is one of the best things that came out.
---
This is my first post in years.
---
I just wanted to say that it's well written and that I agree!
---
*Go back to retail!*
---
It's okay. Now I know for future reference.
---
Hey! Thanks :) I've been following this guide, at lvl 21 now. My talents are the same as in the guide, I have 2 points in improved blizzard.
---
Mirah's song is a easy obtainable offhand, from the questchain that is started outside scholo.
---
the US, east coast
---
Pretty sure this is missing the /s at the end
---
Did it too
---
Cant remember atm. I just know mine works :P
---
That's just the only thing alliance can kill
---
In Vanilla people were progressing Molten Core at the same time other people were progressing Naxxramas.
---
&gt;If that's the case then make the dungeon finder accessible only at cities, be server only and have it do just that w/o teleporting you to the instance..
---
This was the post i replied to. Clearly says w/o teleporting to thr instance
---
Best thing to do would be stop leveling your proffesions as you wont make money from them for a long while, and keep questing without a mount for abit.
---
You will save more time questing normally until you get the mount than you would farming something and then having to do the quests after agian anyhow.
---
If you are dead set on farming for the mount before doing more quests, i'dd suggest spamming SM cath/armory for a while, good xp + probably your best moneymaker atm.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4402/small-flame-sac 
---
farming these is probably the best way for you to make money grinding atm but those spots are usually farmed by higher levels of both factions.
---
You mean you can provide a source for your claim?
---
That doesn't say anything about political statements as so many are claiming the issue was.
---
And this right here is why most tanks I know end up with either a guild around them or a group of friends that they run dungeons with 99% of the time.
---
The two tanks I generally run with at MOST pug ONE dps or a healer and rarely even that because they can fill a group so fast.
---
If you do not have a relationship with a tank like this, most likely you're the problem.
---
Some people in this game are legitimately mentally ill.
---
Œ§his must be from Nostalrius or some other Private Server Nostalrius Clone.
---
I play at 4k, graphics settings 10, and have also used the "hack" to set the weather effects at max.
---
However, I have never seen anything like this in Retail whereas weather like this was common in Private Servers 1.12.1.
---
I take it you were subbing for Mor'ladim.
---
Not if he jumped off that cliff, he couldn't.
---
So write e-mails, go on Twitter and social media where the complaints will actually be seen, hurt, and fuck them over. 
---
But keep it out of places where like in here or in the game where a political agenda will have zero effect. Blizzard won't care about some game protests, and especially not this sub.
---
&gt; Already did. I am not a fan of blindly copying things so I wanted to figure out something myself.  
---
Thanks for the links will look at them. 
---
I get you 100%, I was like this too, but at the end of the day you only hurting yourself, because the dudes making these guides spend so much more time than you testing out all the talents determining which is the best combination.
---
Don't forget to post here that you enjoy leveling slow to rake in that sweet karma. Games been out for x weeks and you're only level 6
---
If you don't know about the riots you just don't care enough to watch the news. I think it's been covered in almost every western country.
---
Good mods are such a rare breed. Thanks for working so hard to make spaces for people who do and do not want to talk about this.
---
Kang would be better as soon as you can land a second AA.
---
As everyone's saying the speed you're leveling doesn't mean anything as long as your having fun. That being said: 9 days is quite long for level 36. You might hit a wall later when it takes even longer to reach a new level. 
---
Are you questing in the correct zones? Perhaps you're doing gray or orange/red quests?
---
I would argue content releases should be based on the majority. 
---
And I'd be willing to bet the majority haven't spent 4 hours a day since release.
---
It never rains when I log in. I have no freaking idea why altho I have set the weather settings at max.
---
At least that would give us a filter to only see relevant messages instead of all in one chat.
---
This reads like you claiming stones do teleport.
---
I remember pvping in greens and blues at 60, and never really get any good raid gear until later expansions.. because i was.. well bad at the game.
---
But even with that, i remember me being perfectly viable. Im not sure how it will go this time? I mean, people are just in general so much better at the game than back then. I already now have much better gear on my freshly dinged 60(levelup up yesterday - congratulations to me yaah), than i had on my 10 days played at lvl 60 back then. 
---
Im a bit scared of BGs and that they will open with full guild teams with full raid gear at the get go and screw it all up.
---
has he acted that way with other people?
---
This is exactly what I would love to see, I doubt it will happen, but it would be glorious.
---
This is animal abuse
---
Can people stop saying Pre-BiS it doesn't mean anything?
---
undead is by far the best looking race on horde with awesome casting animations on top
---
Implying that the guy has a wife though.
---
Getting the tiger as horde was so satisfying in TBC
---
"Entitled is a overused word"
---
Its being used correctly? Regardless of how many times a word is used to describe something doesnt change how accurate that word is :/?
---
It's the Dell U4919DW. 
---
But it's not a gaming screen. There is no G-Sync or FreeSync and the refresh rate is just 60Hz.
---
I use it mainly for my work (software development).
---
I did set the weather density at max but I almost never get any rain at all or other weather effects and when I do it's weak like drizzle.
---
I play at 4k graphics settings 10.
---
Because they do t want to get political debates on discord server ?
---
This is defenitely working as intended.
---
You should never use Hand of Freedom on a Paladin. You should always opt for Bubble - Hearthstone.
---
Safest and easiest way to get out of any net, snare, fear, entanglement etc.
---
It started with BC. Flying mounts never should have existed and resilience gear killed PVPing
---
Agree, shame now if they rush it through, when the release has been such a success. Like, WOW classic again, how kewl is that?? Shaped my life too, bruü§ì
---
As for DM, i cant wait to run them, just need to ding lvl60 first. Im getting there (lvl48), just not quite.
---
What i take from this: Please dont rush, but keep the good times rolling! The players made this happen, dont take it away from themüñ§
---
Just build the group
---
Ninja piece of shit.
---
Yep: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/classiclfg
---
The release of DM before phase 2 means that players need to play more in order to get BIS gear before the release of phase 2, which means they need to play more before then and therefore feel rushed.
---
Weather is amazing..got nerfed hard later on
---
Have you seen the announcement video? He talks about world first kills, crafting of the first sulfurons hammers etc and then continues that many players are ready for something new. The whole thing is just very worrying, as the only players blizzard seem to see or hear from, are the minority that already have cleared all content and are getting bored. Not even 2 months after release.
---
If you so blatantly ignore the majority of your playerbase that hasn't even reached 60 yet, it is a bad sign. It doesn't matter how relevant that content might be, but what I got from the whole thing was that I don't matter, blizzard doesn't care what I or the majoriy of players do, blizzard will do whatever the server first crowd wants.
---
Got a couple well geared dps in my friends list who can easily top or get close to 300 dps depending on class, no aggro issues cause they wait and if they do get aggro they know how to react, but them peeps who struggle to go over 180 dps have aggro constantly go figure.
---
the only thing i can think of would be, doing a little class balance after phase 6
---
LOL
---
I say: All raid that Discord and discuss this Topic. I want to see how many People they  can ban within a day (as if I give a fck about that stupid reddit discord - the mods are stupid

Zardulu is back!

I‚Äôd argue it‚Äôs the exact things but yeah I‚Äôm a forum about a game you‚Äôd expect strong opinions on either side. But thanks for your social study

Nuh-uh!
---
You should probably never invite a hybrid class into your groups again.... or a warrior who might need dps gear.... or a healer who might want caster gear.... you should probably play solo..
---
Sorry, but I'm just gonna say it: Fuck you, Blizzard, for doing this.

Can someone ban this ninja from flooding his reddit with his toxicity? Thats seconds post i see from him today.

I do gray quests if i have them, then green, then yellow. I never do red quests because i know ill get wrecked. I don‚Äôt group a lot tho and spend a lot of time vendoring when my bags are full, thats probably it. Im in stv now doing quests. I was seeing if there is a blatant thing I‚Äôm missing which i guess I‚Äôm not.
---
Thanks for the response!
---
everyone wants that damn stopwatch.
---
You guys should seriously work on your communication skills. How much does it cost to ask ‚ÄúWhat gear will you be rolling on‚Äù or ‚ÄúI will be rolling on XY‚Äù
---
I‚Äôm blaming both here though, in this scenario the tank/group leader for not asking around what others will roll on, but also the Paladin as I‚Äôm pretty sure in a lot of situations people purposely conceal their intention to roll on off spec/off role gear but don‚Äôt tell anyone in order to not get kicked out of the group in advance.
---
How do you get it to look like this?
---
How do you get a Detect Magic spell on everyone?
---
Is this OmniCC?
---
I also use puggle and its great!
---
It tracks all your active chats for lfg/lfm messages and sorts it by instance with keyword-filter and you can customize the keywords for your need. You don't have to look on chat all the time while playing. Just open the UI and see the recent searches. Another advantage is, that no one else needs to have the addon.
---
I had another addon before (don't remember the name, something like LFG_classic). There you could set up searches and browse through searches from others. But others also needed the addon to browse or search with it and on my server only few people used it. That made it pretty useless.
---
Nice, I'm in 1k Needles now and could use a few more gold
---
arround 20-24 was a bit hard for me because i started learning aoe pulling and died often. But one vs one was never a real problem they mostly get nuked before they get to me. Just remember to replace the low rank skills after you learned new once ... forgot that multiple times
---
Can you get windfury on a weapon that already has an enchant? I know sharpening stones prevent you from getting windfury, yesterday I wasn't paying attention and let my friend put firey weapon on my mainhand. Now I'm worried I might have fucked up.
---
Read the comment with link above, he literaly ninjas everything and says its ok.
---
No one is being ignored. People that are still leveling have content, people at max don't have content. Blizzard wants everyone to have content. Phase 3 should come out asap and after that people will have 2 raids + pvp and you can have a longer break.
---
I farmed the whelps in the swamp of sorrows (you can get a rare pet drop, 0.8% I think?) , rock eles, wolves , and birds from badlands, and grinned SM Cath a couple of times.

Yes he was, dipshit. Spend Christmas with your kids you miserable arse.
---
Seeing that priests are a lot more popular than druids, the ratio might not be as bad as it looks like.
---
Speed leveling is like 4 -5 days. So an additional 72 hours does not seem so far off. Considering a level takes 2-4 hours from level 50 onwards that is.
---
Step 1) Stop posting here.
---
Step 2) Go to r/hongkong
---
Lfg queuing is only for the easiest content in the game?? Just don‚Äôt do the boring easy casual content? Try push high keys and mythic raid without talking to anyone, I‚Äôll watch.
---
Anyone wanna buy some clean exp hasn‚Äôt been cut with anything, you can trust me bro just clean exp
---
If they want players to stick around they should definitely release raid content slower than they did in Vanilla. I never got to clear AQ40 or Naxx. Hell, most people didn't. So most players never got to see the content. A complete waste of content.
---
The thing is that an interface for finding groups existed. No one used it because it was just easier to spam trade
---
No they're not. Most OP were always Mages, totally broken. They can tank 20 mobs better than any warrior and even kill them all.. they can solo most things and farm dungeons and gold better than any other class, same with leveling they are again the best. They have ridiculous amount of CC's with ridiculous short CD's which makes them so OP in PvP they can basically 1vs3 and they can kite forever all melee classes. They have free water/food, they can teleport to every city, make own "potions". Their cloth gear + mage armor still provides some armor while other classes don't have magic resist by default. Even wand is so much better than gun/bow, this is so ridiculous how stupidly unbalanced this class is.
---
Did you complete Sunwell Plateau before TBC ended?
---
Back in vanilla days, it wasn't so uncommon.
---
More tanks for dungs, little more healers in general and more druids for raiding would be great. Razorgore-horde
---
Fascinating, I never knew the PvP flag affected friendly spells like that. Til

FREE HONG KONG! REVOLUTION OF OUR TIME!!!!!

How does one be a hardcore raider in classic? Lol?

Making a character? Yes. Trying to play a character not so much
---
My post that got deleted was a screenshot of me cancelling my sub with a quote of the Hong Kong player. The aim of the post was to let people know that it's a thing they could do, as a way to take profit away from Blizzard while being able to type exactly why. As far as I know, that's the most efficient thing that can be done about it.
---
I'm not talking about posting "#JeSuisHongKong" on /1...
---
Store it in your bank and sell in a few months
---
I plan on going that tri spec. Hopefully my guild will let me be the shadow weaver but I might be too far behind the curve. I would love to not have to respec for pvp constantly lol
---
That really sounds greate can't wait to try that out
---
I know people may think boycotting blizzard is the right thing to do but a quick google will tell you tencent who owns a big share in activision which owns blizzard and also holds major shares in ubisoft, valve, GGG (path of exile) and multiple other gaming studio's. fact is if you want a Chinese server tencent needs to have a share in your company. we may not like it but that's how it is. i am not saying it's right but that is the reality of it. so if your going to delete your account, uninstall or unsub in protest to this situation you may aswell stop gaming online completely.
---
This comments section is the testament to why dumb image macro memes are so popular and get constantly reposted.
---
It‚Äôs a discussion because most people don‚Äôt even realize it effects the buffs and the prayer of healing.... now run along
---
Seriously what the fuck is wrong with people?? You see some random mining and minding his own business, let him be. What the shit?
---
Not at any point in Vanilla was there a main spec &gt; off spec for dungeon items. Only in guild grous and raids, since your main purpose for being there was one thing.
---
You can tank UBRS/STRAT/SCHOLO as Fury/Arms. You can heal the same dungeons as off-spec healer as well.
---
As a rogue main my whole life, thanks! However solo questing can be a pain in the ass sometimes, but doing dungs are really fun.
---
Nah happens a lot on horde too.
---
Tbc if blizzard agree to make classic+ they could simply release thc after classic in order to have 2 years time to make content for classic+
---
Hardcore players can play Retail. Classic is a nostalgia trip for most.
---
Leveling is a dream AFTER YOU HIT 20, before that it's a nightmare
---
Pvp:
---
S: Orc

A: undead, dwarf
---
B: gnome

So why can't we all just stop adulting and live with our parents again and play WoW all day? And just work part time
---
I don't know you but I don't like you.
---
Oh, good to know :D
---
please tell me: am i gonna finish my master's degree in a year's time
---
The guide I read said always Max rank Mmh can you elaborate why you use lower.
---
This would be a major mistake if they were to do this. There is a finite amount of classic content, so it would be a mistake to burn through the well too quickly.
---
Your whole comment rests on the assumption that things do not hit you because the mage drew aggro, but if he waits for the mobs to be grouped and only then begins his aoe, there is no downside. Mobs that stand in nova hit the closest person to them regardless of threat and, you know, that should be you.
---
Your first mistake was rolling Tauren. :(
---
They don't want this particular one. Let's not kid ourselves.
---
&gt; due to hunters and mages farming the heck out of DM.
---
Everyone can farm DM, thats the beauty of it. Currently mages and to some extent hunters and locks have a monopoly on the market.
---
First is a stretch, posted this a month ago!
---
Grim Batol please
---
Also want to know this!
---
Evil streamers! They should all be banished from these lands. The earth is flat too! Also dont forget. 9/11 was an inside job! And Elvis is still alive aswell!
---
Your post here should be deleted, too. It violates rule 1 and 5
---
I respect you
---
Your first concern isn‚Äôt specific to Druids or Shaman. I also think you meant to say some places are considered to be indoor; not outdoor. Some assets‚Äô collision detection are considered to be indoor when they seemingly should be indoor, based on the environment. This is congruent to original Vanilla. Go to the lake just west of Everlook, or the ruins with the Ghazrilla dust quest in Tanaris. If you jump on the pillars that are seemingly buried in the ground horizontally while mounted, you get dismounted. 
---
I‚Äôm curious about your second claim. My first thought would be that the spell batching has an effect on mana drain when switching forms. If a priest casts Mana Burn &gt; you go to bear &gt; Mana Burn finishes casting all in one packet, it would make sense that you lose mana. That‚Äôs not how it should work, but it makes sense that it does from a back end perspective.
---
Literally a warlock. Go solo tinkerer.
---
What abilities should my pet be using? I'm a lvl 36 hunter using a cat with claw, bite and growl. Claw seems to keep my pet focus starved though, and it occasionally loses aggro. This is solo questing, btw.
---
Mograine is horde dominated but not too heavily.
---
Best fun in PvP: find another druid, and never die together. I've had organized wsg groups quitting against my room mate and me.
---
If you don‚Äôt have time to level up your character in a few months. How do you figure you‚Äôre gonna have the time to be on a serious raiding schedule to fully experience the effect of these phases. 
---
I believe these phases appeal and should appeal to the more hardcore player. Because what is coming out of the content? End game raids and world bosses. 
---
Unfortunately that‚Äôs just facts right there. Not to be rude but I believe it‚Äôs this type of thought that has led retail to the place it is today.
---
Mograine is regarded to be the most balanced realm.
---
However, I just hit 60 there (Alliance) and I can without a doubt say that it heavily favors horde. The data saying it's 50-50 is outdated, and only based on a defunct addon that had many faults.
---
In any questing zone you can expect to see at least 2:1 horde v alliance, and in Blackrock mountain, get prepared for 10+ horde to camp every door/ entrance nearly 24/7.
---
What the fuck is Archage
---
Edit: Wow the screenshots look like shit
---
You have issues. Go away and take your shitty tech gatekeeping with you.
---
Are you kidding?  Tanks love telling people how to tank, it's why these posts are so popular.
---
Stonespine, Noggenfogger and Shazzran have one of the worst pvp ratios
---
hamstring+bleed then run away and bandage.
---
I have 50+ hour work weeks too. But Classic wow is all I do in my off time really. Also I was talking about people taking their time versus leveling quickly. I am saying with very subjective information that the wave of people seem to be in the 50 range, and dire maul coming out before the wave hits 60 is why this thread exists. I‚Äôve been 60 since 9 days in and I agree it is surprisingly early.
---
DM loot IS for casuals! Raiding is not for everybody, and not everybody likes showing up on time every night like punching in at work and repeating the same rotation over and over again, usually just hitting one button. And to be honest, many MC loot are badly designed trash, that's why they're worse than a lot of DM or other dungeon loots.
---
This was a lot later. My punctuation might not have been perfect on this one like i already admited. Still doesnt change the fact that you were arguing with me before this reply and i dare you to find a sentence before that one that could even remotely be understood as me saying that it does teleport.
---
He definitely meant to trick them, but the question should have been ‚Äúare you going to roll on shadow dmg gear‚Äù
---
Point is he said he was more disc than holy, which is true, if you let people dodge questions like that in game or irl your gonna have a shit time. I‚Äôm super nice in game because it‚Äôs about having fun, but I do screen groups so there‚Äôs no hard feelings like that. Black and white questions with black and white answers.
---
It means pre-raid Best In Slot.
---
What are you on about
---
Your breathtanking
---
Yeah but the haven‚Äôt banned anyone yet. But since they are Chinese, BOYCOTT TENCENT
---
I'm so jealous.
---
A bunch of people have already posted that before people are well aware at this point it‚Äôs a thing they can do if they wish to protest against blizzard no need to continuously post the same topic repeatedly
---
I have collected bunches of mounts over the years. This is still the one I use most and still the one I‚Äôm most proud of.
---
Cancelled my sub just an hour ago. Honestly can‚Äôt believe they would think doing something like this is ok and would go without consequences. Or maybe they thought that the consequences were worth it to not loose the Chinese market. Nonetheless I really enjoyed classic but I don‚Äôt think I will be coming back.
---
To be fair I got mine recently (took about 3 days) and honestly if you set yourself up with Netflix or summin and just spam the /target macro it isn‚Äôt so bad. Arena trinket on the other hand...
---
there's an addon for it, called Dismounter, just in case you weren't aware :)
---
Oh hey, you've seen one of the 300 YouTube videos about the best items in the game!
---
...but sarcastic smugness aside, Tidal Charm is an absolute fool's errand to farm.
---
Don't. It quite literally makes people go insane. I've seen people delete accounts because they've spent 10 days played camping and miss the spawn by a minute or get no Tidal after 6 kills.
---
&gt; Hard to wrangle 40 nerds and get them to listen to directions
---
Somehow a few mongloids in my raidgroup have a hard time understanding: "stop dps, stand still and take your hands away from the keyboard" on Onyxia so.
---
thanks for your info!
---
I specced full prot at 55 and spent the next 5 levels in BRD, got a decent amount of BiS gear in the process.
---
If everyone wanted to do this it would be fun. Forcing people to do it is something else
---
So a few ppl are bored with a dozen dungeons and 1 1/2 raids in a few weeks. Do you really think, those same people that rush through leveling and dungeons and mc will be content with doing BWL for 3 months before they get bored?
---
No player should be punished for their beliefs but a player who breaks the contract should be punished. This is what gets over people's heads. He was not punished for his beliefs, he was punished for breaking the contract. If he voiced his beliefs off contract literally nobody would have given any shits.
---
I only log in for mc and ony at the moment, more content till pvp is great for me
---
and after you baught your epicmount you do exactly what with more gold, other than repaircosts and maybe a few potions? There is no need to have lots of gold on classic.
---
Ah. I guess I was thinking he was using the wrong spells.
---
Our hunters pull in MC makes it way easier
---
I think most PVP realms are horde dominated. I'm on Mograine and it feels alright.
---
holy fucking shit there's 4 pixels total here
---
Even a disc priest with holy nova can do that!
---
yes the company who owns the stream gets to decide what content and opinions goes on it, not so crazy.  praising the mainland isn't damaging to blizzard.  blizzard didn't punish him because they disagree with his politics they punished him because he used their stream as a platform to say something EXTREMELY DAMAGING to them.  
---
Who within the company would even make the decision to completely burn a market you're heavily invested in?  Even if you go all the way to the top the fucking ceo would be fired for doing.  Anyone mad at blizzard over this is ignorant any company in their situation would do the same.
---
? I read in classic. Wow head Max rank usage
---
Min-maxxing is fun. I like to top meters, thats the joy I get from the game.  I do what it takes, raids are a competition between other guilds and others of your class for me.
---
Ahh the old "JOKES ON YOU, I'M NOT ACTUALLY RETARDED I WAS JUST PRETENDING"
---
I mean... welcome to vanilla?? We wanted vanilla, we asked for no changes, and we got it. If the opposing faction puts together a gank squad then just do the same?? You won't get honor for killing players 10 levels below you. Everyone will be within the same gear bracket until level 60. It will be fair game.
---
If they rolled on a PvP server and don't want the insane world pvp, now would be a good time to reroll on a PvE server. That's their mistake. What did they think PvP server meant?
---
To be honest i hope they don't release content as slow as they did back then.
---
Back in wrath I mined for 12 hrs straight and a GM actually messaged me because he got reports I was a bot... I said nope just no-lifing it... he laughed and wished me luck lol
---
Try Windseeker, I rerolled there from a PVP server.  PVP servers are okay, but when you're mostly solo, it sucks balls.  Especially if you're not a basement dweller or 20 something.
---
What server / faction are you playing on?
---
You know that Paladins and Warlocks can get their epic mounts now right because of this move up. Why should we have to wait months? I'm glad they did this
---
Literally addressed that in my comment. It‚Äôs fair enough that some people don‚Äôt have the time to be a hardcore raider. But that doesn‚Äôt mean that the term ‚Äúhardcore raider‚Äù should have its standards lowered. It just means that someone with more time than you will have different experiences than you. When that‚Äôs all said and done, content so far is so easy that most people will probably experience molten core and onyxia at some point anyways.
---
HAHAHA. What a hypocrite!  
---
So you have no life minning at 10 am.  
---
Hes there minning at 10 am calling your nolifeass out.  
---
OK BRO.
---
The only problematic thing would be if they released pvp asap. Layers would be gone and the level group 48-60 would suffer. Casuals like you especially since corpse running would be the only thing you get to enjoy. So be happy that they only released dm which fits into the current state. 
---
Pvp will be a huge time sink. So later patches can come a bit delayed after it is released.
---
I love that shadow priests can nuke makes, mages can nuke warriors, and warriors can nuke shadow priests
---
If you don't find a way to solve gear inflation breaking the game this won't work.
---
Naxxramas gear at lvl 60 is on the verge of gamebreaking, anything beyond that will be insane.
---
Good thing that horse is already dead.
---
FREE HONG KONG
---
China has blizzard by the short hairs ... it‚Äôs kinda pathetic watching supposedly ‚Äúwoke‚Äù people bowing to an insane commie govt
---
Ctrl+W also loots nearest mob if in range of looting
---
You have 7 days of played at 36? 
---
Even new players hit 60 around that time.
---
This
---
I heard if you do that and your last player can't rez, there's a chance loot will despawn before everyone makes their way back. That would suck so much if that happened.
---
I'm level 49, I've been playing since release day.  I have a life and I'm not giving WoW a huge portion of my time,  I don't really mind the early release of DM, but it definitely hurries along MC because of the buffs.  It is a catalyst for end game clearing.  
---
I don't really mind the timeline, but I'm with you, I wish they'd not reward the content gobblers and keep with the original setup and let people play in a relaxed manner.  Let the content gobblers have their anxiety attacks as they level 7 alts in desperation.
---
In what server are devilsaur leggings 130g?! They're twice that on mine.. :(  
---
Also I wouldn't pvp in pre-raid BiS gear, the stam is nonexistant for the rogues reading this. Just a heads up!
---
That‚Äôs nice what else does he let you do?
---
Solidarity from Czech Republic. Even though our President is Chinas little bitch please be sure that there plenty people in here that support you! Be safe!
---
Sorry for the late reply! I respecced once to get Preparation as soon as I hit I think 35-ish, but these are the end-game talents.
---
When I put points into which talents should be just about correct in there, though I don't recall exactly how I did it.
---
Focus as quickly as possible on the improved Ambush/Backstab crit rates as those are your main damage abilities. 
---
Utility talents such as lower Vanish/Blind CD's and Preparation will be lifesavers. You'll never die if you play your cards correctly while leveling anymore, after getting the right talents/abilities.
---
Improved Sap is a must too, for PvP and PvE scenarios. It's fantastic for those annoying mobs that are grouped together.
---
I'm still unsure on some things:
---
-I rarely use Sinister Strike, so I picked Lightning Reflexes instead. You'll want to be using your Improved Gouge to get behind them, regen Energy (bandage if needed), and go for the Backstab.
---
 You basically cycle from Ambush/Cheap Shot to Gouge+Backstab until you go for the Evisc nuke or Kidney Shot + Backstab 'safe' damage (as in you're not getting hit).
---
Using the stuns/cc and bandage/canabilize (as Undead) meanwhile you can drag out fights for an eternity, while staying safe yourself. With TWO Evasions I've even been able to solo a few Elite quests, though most are still too rough.
---
-I haven't reached the level for Imp. Sprint yet, but having fought Frost Mages I felt it's a mandatory talent to even have a chance.
---
-When I respecced to Preparation, I went from 5 points in Precision to just two, and the difference is definitely noticeable and I'm not sure what the right way to go is here. I feel like I'd rather have higher damage on my nukes, or more utility, but once in a while missing those Blinds or Kidney Shots just feels terrible.
---
-Imp Evisc and Ruthlessness are interchangeable.
---
-Remorseless Attacks seems absolutely amazing for leveling, though I didn't pick it. Simply because I wanted to run the exact spec I want to be using at 60, to get used to things the right way.
---
Hope that helped! Let me know if you have any questions. 
---
Quick sidenote: I am by no means a pro, I never played Vanilla, only played Retail a fair bit but didn't even play Rogue that much there. 
---
I do have a bit of knowledge about the game, and I like to theorycraft things. I made this build to 'perfect' the Rogue the way I want to play it (imo screw those Combat semi-warrior builds, but to each their own), and finetuned things along the way.
---
I'm now level 41 and honestly it's still great. Some important things as well are, for PvP you tend to want Monkey gear, apparently. For a good mix of Stamina and Agility. I, however, as survivability wasn't an issue at all, always went for whatever gave me the most Agility, to maximize my damage/critrates, even though the differences were minimal. If something gave 10 Agi + 10 Sta, and another item would only give me 13 Agility, I would go for the latter one, as the 100 extra Stamina doesn't do anything for me.
---
Make sure you get the pants from the Gnomeregan quest around 30, they're still BiS for me at 41. 
---
I did buy stuff off the AH sometimes, because having those upgrades at times just 'felt' better. Make sure you can afford your mount at 40 though.
---
Sooo yeah, think that's it! Hope that was helpful. Further questions very much welcome :)
---
While I was doing my warlock quest for blueberry last night, I ran past a guy who said something along the lines of "Ask me how to get a free drink in The Blue Recluse". If I wasn't just finishing up before heading to bed, that's something I'd like to explore.
---
"It's weird how you are focusing on Blizzard in Blizzard related forums when there's other companies that are also bad"
---
I need bgs now to enjoy this game
---
&gt;level 4
---
With feral gear, should I focus on agility for the cat and strength for the bear?
---
Thanks for answering my noob question
---
A lot of people stop in the mid 30's because they realize how long it will take to get to 60... is this happening here and instead of quitting, you just make another toon? Just curious...
---
I only made it to 32 before i realized i did not have 60 in me.
---
The game shouldn't cater to casuals? How hard is it? Don't you realize that this is what made retail shite? Catering to dad gamers? If you can't put time into the game you need to be left behind.
---
Server caps are multiples higher in Classic than vanilla.
---
I assume you mean your other 2 Tidals were during vanilla and not later into other expansions cause mentioning that would be idiotic. Back when servers were less populated and no one knew anything so he wasn't being camped.
---
Tidals were heavily contested on pservers and people who already have Tidals go back to kill Nazjak just to deny Tidals to other players.
---
Every casual and their mom has seen the "best items in the game" YouTube videos all these content creators are making trying to ride the Classic wave and know about tidal.
---
It is really a fool's errand to farm this trinket. I know many rankers who refuse to, minus an occasional walk over from Menethil now and again just to maybe get lucky but not invest any actual time.
---
They wont do that man. They wont even do tbc until they see the data related to how many players who were not subbee before classic tried bfa or the next expansion.
---
Only if the number is low and the number of subs they lose after people stop playing in 2-3 years will they start considering their options.
---
Their ideal scenario (to then) is get people resubbed and have then play bfa
---
The backup plan if 1st goes wrong is keep them sub to classic while trying to market appealing features to their taste in the next expansion
---
Fallback plan if  not enough people get hooked on the modern game is release tbc quick to keep all the new subs and keep trying to sell then on the idea of playing the modern game.
---
If all fails, Only then will they start considering classic+ and new content need time to develop.
---
This is all ofc my personal opinion of what their strategy for the next 5 years will be.
---
 Sorry boycotting after Blizzard showed their true colors, really disappointed they would censor and fire casters like that
---
I thought fury warriors were the highest eps on classic?
---
Disney and Ford openly supported the Fascists, yet people never boycotted them. In fact, both are thriving.  
---
There's also Nestle, pretty much all clothing lines like H&amp;M, Zara, tech companies like Apple, that use child labor or slavery to obtain their products.  
---
Just like all of the above, this will blow over when diablo 4, the new wow expansion and overwatch 2 are in beta.
---
One of the definitions of the word "literally" is as a modifier to imply emphasis. Even the phrase:  
---
"I was literally blown away by the crowd's response!"  
---
Makes perfect sense, even if the speaker was not physically moved by a gust of wind. It's been defined like this for many years now, as that is how people use the word.
---
r/AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
So, this is his farming route, but he makes fun of you for having a bad farming route.
---
Hmm...
---
Looks fair to me
---
What‚Äôs wrong with being a slow leveler who‚Äôs behind the more hardcore players? If you‚Äôre not even level 40 mate, I‚Äôm sorry, but it will be months till you hit 60,
---
Content should just be released at the same pace as vanilla surely? Isn‚Äôt that the whole point?
---
Green is not a good colour on you.
---
Based on your comment, I‚Äôd like to see how well you‚Äôve killed these easy ‚Äúscripted images‚Äù...
---
I would say don‚Äôt worry. Happened to be in vanilla and blizzard restored everything after they have done their investigations. It‚Äôs just the waiting that sucks. 
---
Wish you well (from your mortal enemy)
---
FOR THE HORDE!
---
I would seriously just put him on ignore after the first sentence. 
---
I have very little time to invest into the game and can afford to have a big ignore list
---
'not exactly' - yes it is.
---
You are making the assumption people want what you want. Clearly not all of us.
---
I wonder how long it took him to work up the courage to talk to you.
---
so much space for 40-man raid frames
---
Why wouldn‚Äôt you say ‚Äúmore shadow than holy‚Äù, though? Otherwise, looks fair to me.
---
&gt; 2) Players that either have no experience at all with Dire Maul, or have been grossly uninformed or misled about its place in progression by someone somewhere into believing that Dire Maul is some spectacular cornucopia of loot upgrades that makes all the other dungeons obsolete, which it most certainly is not. Currently on live there are essentially 8 dungeons anyone ever runs at level 60 .... UBRS, LBRS, Scholo, Strat live, Strat UD, BRD, ST and (maybe) inner Mauradon. Dire Maul is NOT a tier above these 8 dungeons, it is nothing more than dungeon number 9.
---
This is also a result of years of the retail version of the game doing this with dungeons that drop post-release for expansions. Often times these dungeons become the only ones players even do anymore so it makes sense if someone was unfamiliar with Dire Maul, they'd view it as the same.
---
No, I'm sorry for some reason only replying specifically the content of your post and not the content of everyone else's post on here.   What was I thinking!
---
Those comments are full of dead links now. Kinda funny when many comments link videos and not a single one is on youtube, and of course none of them work.
---
Image 100 stelth rogues around you.
---
don't sweat it, you used the word correctly, reddit isn't a journal article and it's obviously completely fine and practical to use informal language
---
Just like they said there would be...
---
And what can they do without affecting their daily lives that can actually make some difference?
---
Your worry is unfounded. People were doing all the dungeons in vanilla.
---
A post i read in 2005-2006?
---
I basically grinded SM Cath till 44 and I'm heading towards tanaris for quests and ZF for the dungeon grind
---
Right on brother! I too am not 40 yet...aim to it it this weekend. Real life matters. I love my vacations in Azeroth and savor every moment. I too don't want to wake up and find myself fresh at 60 but months behind the try hards and pro gamer types. They are great but they also aren't the majority of the crowd. Love your post OP.
---
Disagree with everything in your post except your last sentence. Sure, you make good or even valid points regarding content, but those are all essentially post-hoc (post-fact) justifications for what Blizz are doing now to the game. What you are saying is there is a change to the release plan, at least in comparison to how it was for NA back in Vanilla (and yes, we all realize the release schedule is different from Vanilla anyway as there are 2x less patches this time around), and are fine with it, not having anything to do with the inevitability of not being able to reproduce the exact same patch/phase release schedule, but rather with other, very contemporary, justifications. That in itself is a change in plan.
---
I disagree because the fact that DM is being pushed out has nothing to do with the reasons you brought up here, as valid as they may be gameplay-wise or whatever (I'm not making a comment on that), but *everything* to do with timeline pressure perceived by Blizz to cater to a specific audience in WoW Classic (the hardcore players/1%ers). They are feeling a bit of the pressure by some "important" people (what they perceive as an important part of the player base) and are reacting accordingly, with some jitters, evidently (IMO).
---
I say, hardcores signed up to WoW Classic knowing exactly what to expect (the content release schedule has been out for a while), and let them alt the fuck up all they want.
---
Releasing DM is perfectly fine. Ya'll are making a big issue out of nothing. 
---
I'm perfectly aware that there are still people who havn't hit 60. Good for you guys and play the game how you want. If you are taking the game that slowly I don't know why you give a shit when dire maul releases. 
---
Part of the reason all of the other expansions slowly took the game downhill was because Blizzard constantly catered to casuals. If you aren't 60 by now you are pretty much a casual, and that's fine, but you shouldn't really be trying to dictate the direction of the game when you probably have a quarter of the /played time of alot of people who are playing the game seriously.
---

And if you have issues, pick up a few invisibility potions from AH. They have long CD but its something.
---
Had a UD warrior for years, quit him because I just cant stand the 2h skill animation. It just looks like he is swirling around with his hands, doesnt feel powerful at all
---
Rightclick
---
That's why I leveled my mage to 60 as my alt
---
IMO the thing about classic is that you get more interactions. They're not necessarily good interactions, but the game forces you into close proximity with other players trying to achieve the same things You can co-operate if you want, or you could try and fuck them over, or just ignore them. The choice is yours, but the game design actively pushes you into these interactions to begin with.

I‚Äôm not supporting the dungeon finder, I‚Äôm just saying there could be a middle ground. They could make it a group finder where it lets you pick a zone (which may or may not contain an instance) and form a group of any size/composition. It wouldn‚Äôt teleport you there, either. I hate having to use the LFG chat because it‚Äôs a flood of people spamming their message (at least on Herod) every few seconds
---
Pretty sure the change from 0.02% to 1% with either the introduction of the timed Baron runs or the TBC prepatch.
---
I see what you mean with Emerald Dream but I think the scarlet one would be very classic'eque.
---
Sorry for the late reply! Copied from my reply to someone else who asked:
---
I respecced once to get Preparation as soon as I hit I think 35-ish and switched a few things around, but these are the end-game talents as goals, and I'm using them for leveling as well. I expanded on the thoughts/sidenotes below.

I think the best place to farm is to just do stratholme runs for righteous orbs, added bonus if you‚Äôre going for cloak from lastboss or mount, and if you can reserve all righteous orbs while forming group

&gt;  How many times have we seen people not able to join full layers? 
---
Many times. Early on, people tried to raid capital cities and could not get into the same layer as their other raid members. 
---
But its pointless to continue. You didnt have proof and you can go google layers, tipsout blizzard interview if you want to see what i was talking about. You made up your mind already. gg hf.
---
Sorry for the late reply! Here you go:

Iirc there already is a feature like this in game, under Social (O)
---
the group finder in retail is OK, I mean that's what I got my classic kick out of WoW before classic was running M+ via groups in the group finder, was as close to retail dungeoning as you were gonna get.
---
I can see no rushing yet. Phase 2 for the end of the year seems reasonable.
---
I am making the assumption that a lot of people enjoyed the concept of CoT, which is definitely true. Also, how is CoT dungeons recycling?Just because they use warcraft 3 voice lines on occation?

As long as the funeral isn't held in Winterspring on a pvp server.

I think this might already exist, under the Social (O) window.

---
Less than 100 Tidals a year for servers with probably more than 10,000 active players and it's "easy". K.
---
And as I said, I have Tidal so your comment about envy is completely irrelevant.
---
Not claiming to be a vanilla expert but how big is the step between each raid? If a guild can clear the whole of mc in under 20 min one week ago, how much time will it take for the next raid?
---
Also not saying I will run out (I'm like lvl 30 something since barely play) I'm saying that some people will run out of content
---
The time isn't the issue in the post. The timeline for progressing is. OP would like it stretched a bit more. Basically want a greater portion of the base to be 60 before actually bumping to the next phase.
---
Uh oh someone on his black list
---
I have been told multiple times (mainly on here rather than in-game) to go back to retail. The last time I played retail was before TBC was released...
---
Got a Cruel barb on my first DM run and got another on the second run. Did DM another 8 times for exp and because is a lot of fun and it never dropped again. I still have them at lvl 33. (rogue)

I had all 4 pvp mounts in vanilla when I got rank 13 on my tauren druid, so they should all be rideable in classic.
---
INTEREST YER IN A PINT?
---
The thing is prot warriors don't do anything better than others, they don't do as much dmg as arms, and even if so then arms still has the heal debuff. They maybe tank as well as a druid in ws but they bring way more mobility to it. They might be useful in clutch situations in av when you really need a tank for the bosses but most druids and arms wars will be sufficient for this
---
It didn't even do this. 
---
It was like 7 million in TBC and up above 11 million by the end of Wrath. Hardly much of a slow. 
---
TS is certainly a country mile off with his revisionist history.
---
It was in TBC for sure. I was farming baron on my level 70 rogue (tough challenge) and after a few hundred runs they changed the drop rate on me. I stopped farming it when the drop rate was upped because the mount no longer had the same status.
---
How chaotic neutral of you
---
Yea, that affects me as I want to play the game, so that is no for me bruh.
---
Just putting it here, you seem to think capitalism is an angel among others. Brainwashing at its finest.
---
Well, there goes my classic wow subscription. Anyone know if private servers are still a thing?
---
You can use your old account if you still have the credentials (otherwise contact the support if you still have at least your old mail, they're usually really helpful). Unlike retail which you need to buy separately you only need a subscription to play classic.
---
People always give mages the edge when it comes to levelling due to their ability to AoE farm (also that's why they are massively overpopulated atm). If you like me don't really care for that kind of optimization then warlock seems like the more chill choice. You either have a pocket tank with your voidwalker or spec into improved drain life and tank yourself while your succubus whips away and serves as a mana battery/CCs, works pretty well as affliction. Dot-dot-drain. I also haven't had bad expieriences regarding the group finding part. Summoning stones don't work in classic so locks are wanted because there's always that one lazy fuck or the hunter that needs to restock arrows. Also healthstones, superior CC with succubus and fear, curse of xyz. For solo PvP warlocks also are (in my personal biased opinion, lock since tbc) miles ahead of mages... But that's mostly because I heavily prefer their gamplay. Mages control and evade opponents to prevent damage. Warlocks either heal through it with their live leech or control the enemies by making them run from them. Fighting against a good warlock is a lot more frustrating  because it often feels like you absolutely can't do anything that bothers him. As said, matter of taste. If played well both classes are terrifying, locks imo just have a "superior" feeling to them. 
---
As last alternative to the two you mentioned I would throw in priest. As shadow they feel similar to (affliction) warlocks just with different defensive options that are more group oriented. Also mind control still is the funniest spell in wow. Let people run into mob camps, the zerg in a BG, jump from a cliff or straight up drowning them never gets old. They also are hilariously stupid in wPvP (similar to SL locks they just don't die but actually do decent damage... until they run oom, then you'll miss life tap). Levelling is pretty idiot proof as you only need the two talents wand specialization and the first shadow talent that doubles you willpower after each kill. Dot, bubble, wand and you can leave fights with full hp and mana while being free to throw in mind blasts if you want to. Big difference is you can apply to groups as both healer and DPS. Your talent choice won't lock you out of a role while levelling.
---
Skinning while leveling isn't really about selling on the ah during "fresh server" time, it's about making more vendor gold per kill. Anybody that expected people to buy leather on the AH
---
For a first time mage (and most others), I highly suggest with the frost bite talent as soon as you can get it.  
---
Melee targets:  
---
Start out at max range: frostbolt -&gt; frostbolt -&gt; fireblast -&gt; frostbolt -&gt; frost nova -&gt; run away for about 5 secs -&gt; start over with frostbolt
---
Ranged targets:  
---
Start out within fireblast range: frostbolt -&gt; fireblast -&gt; frostbolt (until fierblast is back up)  
---
Usually, you will prioritise items with int + sta, spirit as a thrid option until your 40+
---
You can still screenshot on console.
---
Rogues think they are so good until my hunter's mark is above their head
---
Most of us are lower level dude, the majority of posters are going to be nolifers that hit 60 within days. It's tough, I work 50 hours a week too and have a family. I just hit 37, playing often enough for my girl to get upset lol. Hopefully they realize most people dont have the time to get through content that fast and slow it down for us normies. If not, oh well we can save $15 a month whenever were ready
---
do you know what a parody is
---
This sounds great. But I really hope they'll NEVER introduce TBC. No meaning in re-playing old content further then Classic. Just add more dungeons and storys that are more challenging. No levelups past 60, no big gear improvements. Only add cosmetic upgrades for the "champions" that master the new dungeons. I really hated TBC
---
A lot of players don't know about those. Asmongold took a corpse run a while ago because he kept attacking one while talking about something else.
---
I was a day 1 Vanilla Druid Player, playing Vanilla for thousands of hours through BC, where I was the #1 Arena player in the world. 
---
I got 60 in classicbalmost a month ago, got my epic mount, and have been raiding/pvping since :).
---
For leveling - Feral is your best bet, especially in 1.12. Feline swiftness is huge for leveling speed, and feral can heal dungeons just fine (just carry an intellect set of gear to use - cloth is fine). 0/30/21 Is your best bet for all-around usefulness in the late 50s/early 60s as well, as you can tank, dps, or heal anything just fine.
---
But once you've graduated past fresh-60, are out of low level greens, and are ready to Raid/PVP:
---
Resto is your strongest spec. Feral and Boomkin are fun for PvE and PvP they absolutely can contribute - but you'll always rely on guild to carry you. Feral can tank or DPS - but you'll never be optimal. You will have to work 2x as hard, and farm 2x the amount of consumables (hours a day for the MCP) to be about 90% of where you'd be as a true DPS/Tank class.
---
No class can tank, DPS, and heal optimally - If they could, everyone would be a druid. If you are ok with being a sub-optimal player for Tanking and DPS, that's fine, just make sure your expectations at end-game are there (You won't ever be on the cutting edge without being carried by your guildies and will require more time and effort to be "almost" where everyone else is).
---
Resto is where Druids shine. Pure Raid PvE, you need a few druids to cover the shortfalls of other healers. Huge NS burst heals, HOTs ticking everywhere (saving the GCD of other healers), Rebirth combat res, etc.
---
I always ran 8/11/32 spec - The PVP Healer that doesn't lose much in PvE but makes you the (IMO) best PVP Healer.
---
Think of Druids as Support and not pure healers. Your tools are based on peeling and mitigation. You can heal fine (Phase 6 Druids are the most efficient healers in the game), but if you roll up to a PVP battle as a Druid/war vs a Priest/War and expect to out-heal the priest, you're ganna lose. You have more tools are your disposal to impact the game than other healers, but not as many of them are heals. You're expected to FF to lower armor/prevent stealth, Root who/when applicable to peel and/or isolate, know when to spam rank 1 rejvs to bait purge/dispell, know when to Feral Charge+Bash to stop a heal, Know when to rank 1 MF to dot someone, kill totems, etc.
---
Do you use NS defensively to HT yourself, or Regrowth yourself (knowing you can get away to then utilize the hot, and then swiftmend, or do you NS Root, knowing you can walk away and heal/drink/stealth. You can also use NS offensively, to root someone and isolate from their team, or even to NS Hibernate Shams/Druids as well.
---
You need to always position yourself to be able to run away. While druids are the best at running away, when caught, druids have far less tools than other healers to push them away (Fear, Plate, bubble, BOP, LoH, etc).
---
Be ready to lose - A lot. Druids are far more fragile/room for error than other classes. But - If you're willing to put in the time to learn not only your class, but other classes and how/when to use your abilities to neutralize their advantages, the sky's the limit.
---
By whom? Twitch? Very unlikely as is is not against the rules to have a winnie the pooh emote (or mockery of it). Blizzard also is in no position to ban aka DMCA strike a streamer for adding a chat emote, it's impossible to enforce.
---
It‚Äôs a mess
---
I‚Äôve made changes to the lua file to stop getting highlight errors.
---
Heal prediction temporarily stops detecting Renew for a random period of time.
---
Get errors after every kill if my player frame is disabled.
---
This guy is the Webster definition of Projection.
---
Seems he got all his self loathing out though
---
Sorry but what am I looking at?
---
How do I do this? I only knew how to do it by logging out...
---
What other tiger mount is there?
---
You‚Äôve puta lot of time into professions, if you‚Äôd been leveling the entire time then it‚Äôd seem like a long time
---
you don't need to respec to heal dungeons
---
you're not even actually taking that many talents that increase your healing, you're just saying "i don't wanna be shadow" and speccing holy damage instead of shadow damage, really
---
being different for the sake of being different is just a different way of saying playing badly on purpose tbh
---
I believe krol blade is comparable if you can find one affordable too
---
People also have far better knowledge this time around, compared to vanilla. 
---
So ofc people are going to stomp both leveling and raidiing.
---
&gt;Save
---
It's called projection haha. He is upset with himself deep down so he projects it on this person
---
Breathtaking when you manage to avoid screenshoting everything except the sky.
---
Game is ugly af. Which is ok for a 16 years-old game.
---
I am aware, I went all the way to rank 13 though on my druid.
---
Why post evidence of you being a shitty person?
---
And also warlock epic mount
---
Guess none. I farmed the crap out of ZG tiger once it became possible to solo in wrath, no luck.
---
huh? had this in EU for years
---
Hey man. I just want my mage water.
---
shit editing
---
*laughs in warlock*
---
[1.Do](https://1.Do) you ever feel like the class is too mechanically intense? For example, having to constantly manage your Auto Shot, your position, your pet and whatever else compared to another class that has a simpler rotation and/or no pet?
---
No. As a hunter you want to play with a few macros. I have a macro I generally use for Autoshot + pet attack. You get used to range and positioning.
---
[2.Do](https://2.Do) you ever feel like the class is a chore? Similar to the previous question, you have to constantly control basic things like who your pet is attacking in both PvE and PvP. Then you also have out of combat things such as food/ammo/bag space.
---
No. Like I said above you work with alot of macros and or keybindings. Keybind for pat attack, Keybind for your pet to come back,..
---
[3.Do](https://3.Do) you need to use crafted ammo in PvP? My understanding is that you generally use the vendor ammo except on bosses in PvE.
---
So far vendor Ammo is enough.
---
[4.How](https://4.How) difficult is PvE kiting? Is it just a case of keep aggro, don't get hit and know where you need to run or do you need to do more complex things with aspects/traps?
---
Its not difficult. The only difficulty is kiting in a zone with NPCs your level that are hostile and attack you while kiting. If you have a free field its pretty easy. 
---
[5.How](https://5.How) punishing would you say the class is in PvP for the average player? There are many people who will say that the skill floor is quite a bit higher than other classes and that something like a mage is much more intuitive to play.
---
Heavily depends on your enemy and your spec. If you play BM and play against a good mage you have basically no chance since he just sheeps your pet and its over. 
---
[6.How](https://6.How) lazy can you be with taming/traning pets? So, if I just want an ordinary cat for PvP, something like a wolf for PvE and something suitable for solo farming, can I get these without having to tame loads of random things just for the higher rank pet skills?
---
I have the same pet for pretty much all of my gametime. You are going to have 3 pets, but its not a chore.
---
[7.How](https://7.How) many essential macros do you have at 60? I assume scatter/FD/trap but what else?
---
A handful 
---
[8.Do](https://8.Do) you have many more keybinds compared to other classes?
---
Normal 1 - 4 keybinds, x, c, h, t, mousebuttons 4, 5 and every of these buttons with shift combined. I guess its more for hunters since you have to manage your pet. You get used to it.
---
No i 100% about the normal wow-related content. The off-topic channel is a different case though, not? Unless political conversations were already banned in there to begin with.
---
Yes, the change dodge show increase, but mostly you just miss with a low weaponskill.. So you won't proc it consistently enough to form any strategy around it.
---
What an obnoxious human being
---
\*Rouges
---
Generally this is what I'd recommend if you want to level as arms:
---
- 5/5 Cruelty
---
- All other points ins arms until level 40
---
- Respec at 40, getting Mortal Strike
---
- Fill Fury tree again, starting with Cruelty
---
I would absolutely respec to get MS now. It's a massive deal for your leveling speed.
---
Deflection/Improved Charge/2h Spec/Imp. Hamstring are all kinda personal preference. If you're on a PvP server, Imp. Hamstring is fucking amazing. It doesn't sound much, but when it procs it wins you a fight straight up.
---
Who is dumb enough to ninja and then literally post yhe proof to reddit?
---
Who cares #blizzardboycott
---
"ninja looting" is when another player takes loot for themselves that they were not entitled to... like a mage rolling need on a dagger like that. 
---
Stop trying to justify this persons shitty actions. Go back to retail chump
---
I for one haven't touched anything but classic from the launcher since release.
---
Google ‚Äúcolloquialism‚Äù
---
&gt; to reach level 60 by now, the amount of playtime necessary is unbelievable and unrealistic for most people and that should not be the timeline against which content is released. 
---
lol what
---
I got to 60 with 10 days played. I played for an average of about 3 hours in the weekdays (sometimes less, sometimes more) and maybe an average of 6 hours in the weekend days. 10 days played averages out to almost 6 hours per day - but obviously the majority of those hours come from the weekends. I had friends who were level 60 two weeks before me - people who work full time jobs (but no kids).
---
I have NO idea how you're only 23 if you have been playing since launch. 
---
And yeah, reaching 60 takes time. Just like it did in vanilla.
---
No, please no. 
---
What you want is available in retail. I too am a casual with 1 or 2 hrs a night to play if I am lucky. 
---
The sense of community is one of the main reasons people want classic and the dungeon finder was a major contributor in destroying the sense of community and immersion in this game. 
---
Without it the community needs to rely on others to form a group. They work together to make it to the dungeon location. This gives flight paths purpose, creates PvP encounters. Mount are infinitely more valuable because of travling as well. 
---
What your asking for will ruin the game, its already done it once.
---
They had something like this in TBC though and not many people used it.
---
Unpopular opinion here, I would love dual specs in classic. Even as a caster dps, I'd love a raid spec and a pvp spec. Can't even imagine the pain as a different multi-role class.
---
I don't seriously think they can be compared, I mean genre and playstyle will affect how toxic people are. I attested The dota/LoL toxicity as being correlated with the competitive sport nature of those games, the same thing happens in retail on top tier raiding guilds and Arena guilds.
---
Classic has none of that really, and you don't really get thrown in with randoms, since you match make your own group. Any toxic behaviour I've seen in Wow classic so far is on par with living with a raven. People like being jerks.
---
Lol, not for ‚Äòstanding up for...‚Äô whatever, but for violation of tournament rules!!!
---
Premade group finder, dual specs(heavy heavy initial investment), and retuned raid content to make the experience closer to vanilla.
---
I thought that the whole classic community prefered the old game because retail was ruined by catering to casuals too much?
---
I think you're doing it wrong as a mage.
---
5 Years ago the true impact of this choice was discovered, 1996 was only the beginning
---
But posting that screenshot to reddit takes much more effort compared to PC doesn't it?
---
Depends on how crowded your server is. If it's overpop and you're alliance on a pvp server, you'll likely be unable to aoe farm mobs around the world.
---
Warlocks can farm maradon, hunters may be able to farm DM tribute runs, and mages can aoe farm lasher's for essences in DM.
---
I'd wait for DM to drop next week to see if hunters can do Dire Maul or not - which usually is the best.
---
Regardless, mages are always great. They can do far more than farm gold, which they also do as well as anyone's.
---
It's the world we're living in after all, so yeah hehe..
---
Doesn't work if the wars hamstrings you. Stun is the surefire way to kill.
---
It will literally be the other way around. Besides Frost Oil and Strong Troll's Blood Potion, there is very few things a player will want/need to buy off the auction house. However, suddenly a lot of things they earn out in the world is actually worth something on the auction house. This gives them more money, and unless they're running around buying gear from auction house, will make their experience a lot easier. Then they hit 60 and mats for enchants are expensive, that's where they start getting negatively impacted. But at this point, they can as well partake in the good gold farming methods.
---
Grats, now unsub until Blizz stops kowtowing to the Chinese government.
---
Ye got my attention
---
AEO
---
I farmed it with a buddy for a long time myself. It dropped and I passed for the raptor, being we were ally at the time. 
---
Never seen it again. But I got the raptor and panther.
---
Yup, I love WoW and took time off to play it! I don't generally post on this account about political stuff but Blizzard overstepped here.
---
More dots more dots more dots
---
Fury, then rogues, then tanks.
---
DM is not an expansion lol. And who cares. This content ain‚Äôt for you bro. You‚Äôre level 34. Why do you people feel so entitled? Even if they released all the content of vanilla all at once you will still spend the same amount of time getting to these dungeons. Lol
---
careful you dont break your neck when you wanna watch your video
---
in like naxx
---
The guy emailing is not a true trader, people who undercut by a high margin are a blessing and an opportunity to make more money for yourself.
---
If possible, buy them out and resale for more. 1

You just figured out the proper way to level a warrior since about 15 years :)
---
This is a bannable glitch btw, be careful

Yet still every time it's posted there's a 50/50 split of opinion lol.

I am a warrior tank and it makes me so upset when i want to enjoy pvp(
---
Delete that shit rn
---
World of Warcraft was the original game coining game addiction.
---
Hello,
---
As a hunter do I will ever need to play with a firearm ? Because I like bow and don't wanna use firearm.
---
You're all so annoying with your fucking posts. No wonder most of you were bullied in school.
---
Rip whitebeard never forget
---
He got the rare mount drop from Baron Rivendare.  Deathcharger Reigns.
---
lol, that's exactly me!! (minus i must also remember to feed my baby boy too!! xD)
---
The only way classic is hard is if you play using only 1 finger (across mouse and keyboard) while also looking at a different screen, using only sound to find your way.
---
Hunters think they're good until freezing trap is on cooldown.
---
Yes it was deadmine
---
I‚Äôve used this. It‚Äôs decent. But there‚Äôs a bunch of quests it gets you to do but never turn in.
---
It just cost me no time or effort since I levelled it by pickpocketing every mob before I killed it and unlocked the picked lockboxes. That's all I figure - took me no additional effort or anything so I just do it for free.
---
And then there's the level ?? Feral Druid who has been 1shotting anyone he could find in Duskwood for 4 days straight.
---
same i got ashes on my first tempest keep run in cata :)
---
Reeeeeeeee
---
Or just tell people it's MS&gt;OS before you invite them, i've done that since i hit 60 week 1 and i've had 0 issues. You roll for the specc you joined as, if that's not your main spec then find another group.
---
Takes a few minutes longer to form a group, if at all, and covers you in case they decide to ninja by making it reportable and loot intervention possible.
---
I cancel the trade and say I do it for free :P
---
Fuck this made me laugh!! :D
---
Disagree. I've had some lovely interactions in Classic.
---
It is the only rare drop mount in classic until ZG is introduced, then the Zul Gurub Tiger and Raptor are added. Then AQ adds the (not so rare) bugs you can ride inside AQ and the Legendary mount if you are one of the hardcore that will finish the gate-opening quest.
---
Drop rates are crazy low for the Baron mount, Tiger and Raptor though.
---
There is only one other "rare" mount and rather than a drop - the Winterspring Saber. You get it after a long grind in Winterspring (as in multiple months long grind).
---
Same I thought it was my addon
---
China is 12% of Blizzard revenue while the Americas is 55% and Europe 33% we have significant leverage here.
---
Indeed.
---
Hmm ok. I just assumed the most efficient way to endgame would be to quest so that's what I have been doing.
---
I'll run some dungeons when I get on later. Thanks!
---
No you do not.
---
Are you really this naive to think that all these people that are saying that they will stop play will actually stop playing for good? Sucks to be you.
---
Boycott Blizzard.
---
Who hurt you?
---
I'd love to see how all of the people complaining about this would fare in a game like EVE online, where there are no zones where you don't have PvP activated and you lose money whenever you die, even to another player.
---
Ganking is a part of life on a PvP server. I've never done it I don't find it fun, but if anyone plays on a PvP server not expecting it to ever happen they are in for a shock
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Unfortunately yeah.
---
dont whisper people to sell shit, just use trade chat or AH.
---
Who knows maybe classic + will be a thing and they will had some cool stuff to the vendors. Or quests with unique rewards.
---
Considering people already have the Winterspring mount it clearly is not a multiple months grind.
---
I have played a lot of time.   300 cooking/fishing.  Morning noon and night and i am only lvl 45.    I am amazed how many 60s.    Again i dont play in a group.   Maybe thats the key.    Dungeon farming.
---
Sometimes I wonder if our lives are really more important than theirs you know?
---
Every class has a direct opponent in Classic.  For Rogues, it's Warriors.  Speaking in an endgame perspective, good luck getting through all that armor.
---
Having played Rogue in Vanilla, most Hunters were cake.  Mages too.
---
I play on Herod, there aren‚Äôt any significant streamers on horde other than Asmongold but he hasn‚Äôt even played that character he just wanted to make some content and piss people off... originally Herod was the server for people who didn‚Äôt want to play with streamers which is why it‚Äôs so high pop
---
Why should they
---
This is a very nice build, but as you rightfully mentioned it needs a lot of fiery wrath gear to be really successful, maybe it's a bit too expensive for somebody on their first character. 
---
But have my upvote for being an OG fire mage
---
You can't be too far off. All alliance questing zones grant reputation for all 4 major cities. I am a dwarf and I was honored in Darnassus, Gnome and Ironforge plus almost revered in Stormwind when I bought my ram.
---
The fact that you care about Asmon's opinions speaks volumes about you as well. 
---
This is his livelihood and he's an immoral loser. Of course he's not going to promote people cancelling their sub in protest. Hurts his business.
---
Level 50 undead rogue, no idea where to level, done a lot in Ferales and Tanaris. Azshara is too high to do atm.
---
They are, and there are plenty to choose from!
---
My brother got it back in TBC. He was the only dude not from the guild in the raid and they still gave it to him ! He didnt even have the mount comp required at that time !
---
Azmongold has never had any moral grounds. If people find him entertaining to watch, that's fine, but morally speaking he is a discussing human with little empathy or reasoning. There have been vast amounts of instances to evidence this. I personally found some of his videos entertaining, but because I think he is such a vile person, I refuse to support his channel. There are more deserving people out there.
---
Took me nearly 1200 kills to get. Got it mid legion.
---
Go take your pills now, please.
---
Cause most of them are, contrary to popular belief, adults running a business and make there decisions based on that like every normal grown up? Maybe idk?
---
God I wish they would do classic+ but it's way more likely they'll just keep churning out underwhelming retail xpacs and just chuck tbc at us at some point :/
---
we all are, it‚Äôs okay. he‚Äôs just worse off.
---
It takes people out of the game and removes a lot of player interaction. LFG is cancer for an mmo
---
Just got to 56 last night... grinded an hour in denial but after a good night's sleep I decided to cancel my subscription and uninstall every Blizzard game. Got so close to 60 but I knew it wouldn't feel the same anymore.
---
Off with ye
---
Harpies in Feleras are good. They're 47-50.
---
Eventually you're gonna have a server full of people with you on their ignore list and you won't be able to sell shit in trade.
---
&gt; fool's quest
---
you need burst damage to succeed in pvp, and protection does not have it.
---
Better go to retail then
---
They're wonderful, I've helped the poison vendor downstairs collect over 150,000 of them!
---
Ashkandi!! Good server!
---
Nothing to say? What‚Äôs what I thought. Lol. Low level players shouldn‚Äôt give two shits what upper level content is being released because you can‚Äôt play anyway
---
Saves repair costs! Big IQ streamer /s
---
its not the game its the people, also the time you are on matters quite a bit.
---
Guess who is going to be more toxic, some dude who just got off work and has 2 hours a day to play or someone whos been sitting at home all day playing 12 hours a day with nothing else to do.
---
60 with epic mount 10/10 MC and 1/1 Ony, it's over for me and isn't worth supporting them anymore.
---
I mean, great for you man, really. But let's be honest, it's probably not actually good at any of those things, it just barely allows for you to do it. And then you're probably hurting your party by being a sub-par tank or healer.
---
Moreover, this is not even a viable option for many classes. Prot warriors are fucked when they want to farm alone or pvp. Same with shaman and priest healers, etc...
---
And now you know people will remember your name on this server. Gratz mate, just watch that horse's back !
---
I noticed that once too. Pretty intense.
---
I play like this too. Dark souls taught me the fun in lurking around and taking people out like that.
---
some bosses in bwl will be really annoying, the 1st boss is pretty technical, lots of kiting, stopping pillars, fighting bosses
---
I completely disagree.. If you're as casual as you are and not even 50 yet, why should we bother with you in the context of releasing new content, I mean you're barely playing
---
Nah, didn't.
---
i feel you bro
---
Greatest line in all of wow.
---
51 here and Burning Steppes was good. Lots of quick quests. Tbh I'm not sure where to go now that those are all done though.
---
Yea- I've gotten pretty lucky already.
---
Would be boring if we were all the same ^^
---
Scarlet Monastary.
---
MoP made me quit. Dumbed down talent system and too many dailies.
---
There will be no changes to the talents and skills. Fixes are being made for things that aren't working like in vanilla.
---
"What did he drop?"
---
-Proceeds to mouse over his corpse and attempt to check, while dead and 50 feet away.
---
Should allow rogues to cast blind on a second target without losing CP on the first target. Or at least it did.
---
And sent a mug of refreshment with the insult! Now that's quality.
---
The worst is when someone undercuts by like 50% and floods the AH with their items
---
So you should farm every week for over 22yrs
---
I like your youtube vids, but I have to ask,
---
Is every streamer a mage?
---
they changed over the course of vanilla but what we have now is what we will have for all of classic.
---
Cries in warrior
---
So wait.  Are you saying that you expect another individual with free will and independent values to immediately support a cause that you as an individual feel strongly about?  Surely that's your flaw here?
---
I don't particularly like Asmon myself, and fair play to those who do, but  come on.  Seriously?  If he doesn't want to get involved, it's nobody's obligation to tell him that he should.
---
*laughs in demonic*
---
This would be amazing. Doubt it happens but it sounds way more fun than BC.
---
Your jimmies rustled, hypocrite?
---
Should of let his name in, people like this deserve any hate messages they get from Reddit.
---
Is warrior really that hard? i have never player wow, yesterday i downloaded a private server and tried everyclass and the only one that "clicked" and felt right playing it was warrior, but every thread and video i see they say that is the hardest class to level, that it will break your soul, that it will make you quit at 30,etc etc  
---
i can only play about 2 hours per day, and on sundays probably all day, what are my chances of reaching end content as a warrior?  
---
should i just give up for a more casual friendly class?
---
Looks like your jimmies have been rustled, hypocrite :c)
---
thrashblade is still good at 60.
---
Let's have a look at it the other way around.
---
As an esport champion you shouldn't be using the platform provided by a company to promote your own political agenda.
---
Yes it's really unfortunate what is happening in Hong-Kong but it does not affect me as a player and I prefer my games free of politics anyway.
---
Not to mention all the virtue signaling like this post, that surrounds the whole shitshow. 
---

do you like the game or not? If no, don‚Äôt play. If yes, quit bitching

There's literally a whole thread about it with thousands and thousands of upvotes. If you want karma for your screenshot about cancelling your sub, maybe post it there.

I've never been so envious of people as I am now.

I'm not in a realistic sense but in a jealous way.

The guild I'm in has multiple people with no jobs and every time you log in they're another 10 levels up on their next character.
---
And a little bit of me thinks 'I wish I had no job or responsibilities'
---
But then you snap out of it and start chopping into the xp bar with the other 50 people trying to kill the same mob as you for a quest
---
I didn't want to protest, it was my lame attempt at a joke considering the recent news. Still, saying that in Global chat wouldn't be protesting, it would be to show support for Hong Kong.
---
This has absolutely no effect on what I just said.
---
Besides, they way you put out your 'stats' you seem to think the entire Asia is China. How ignorant can you get? If you want to do something, do something more meaningful than sitting in your armchair thinking your little action makes you a hero of justice.

Guildbank. thats all I want.

Then they should ask for a tank.  Don‚Äôt advertise for a role then switch it on them after they‚Äôve made the trip.

Hey Blizzard I am a dad, my message to my kids will be your games suck and they are not allowed to play your games. You may be able to support a group of peoples future getting fucked on but you don't have a say and how I raise the next generation.

Fair enough that does Sound reasonable. 
---
My prediction was that they are going to announce Classic TBC at Blizzcon this year - or next year. 
---
They'll release it in 2 1/2 - 3 years from now. After that WOTLK a couple of years later.
---
My wish would be that they did Classic+ instead of Classic TBC - but I don't really believe that going to happen either.... :/

There is the Blue Light saber sword from Strat chain, it's also pretty Ok... Not as strong as Krol or Dal'rend but serviceable... Also DEADLY agains't undead if you're farming them.

Genocide and layering are definitely comparable. I'd say layering is slightly worse because it affects me though, amirite?

If you think you are entitled to my heals but I shouldnt be able to pve/pvp then I dont want to group with you so I guess were good

Idk man, guides have never been my thing. 
---
Following a guide is efficient and all, I get that. But I‚Äôm just kind of playing to enjoy and experience it on my own terms. Following a guide just feels like I‚Äôm playing someone else‚Äôs game on autopilot.
---
And the typical A+ response, but hey, offense is the best defense they say. Classic

Hey he‚Äôs in my guild haha

Southern Feldwood maybe.

I logged in the other day to a full server. I logged in yesterday to a full server that was layered. What's the big deal?

However, what you are doing is a stupid internet points grab and attention whoring on YOUR part. Nothing else. You also moved against the moderators of this subreddit which are doing a good job handeling this situation.

I'm impressed you have gotten to lvl 60 as a clicker, I clicked until cata when a guild I wanted to raid with made me keybind, I remember it feeling gads, now a seasoned keybinder, I would never go back.

Better build a rocketship and leave earth then, because every other company would probably  take a similar stance and filter political discussion in the same circumstances. So you better not give your money to any company! Oh boy, outrage culture.

Alliance only.
---
I don‚Äôt need to justify playing on private servers.
---
Almost getting to level 50 here. My guildies have been telling me to focus only on dungeons leveling from 50 to 60 to gather gear and start preparing for raids. 
---
Once I'm lvl 60 I can do the quests in the 50-60 range zones to farm gold (since you get more gold from completing quests at level 60).
---
Until now I've mostly leveled in questing areas, so the change-up would be new to me. What do you guys think about running only dungeons before level 60 and doing the leveling zones after?
---
All they say is do BRD, URBS and LBRS now since you're gonna farm them anyway at later levels.
---
Overpower has a 6 second cooldown. Yes you're going to give them at least 1-2 guaranteed OP procs if you use Evasion. *However*, they're probably going to get 1-2 procs on you *anyway*, so you're still better off just getting those procs out of the way and dodging everything else.
---
The cooldown doesn't immediately reset after a new Dodge happens, it still has to come back off cooldown before they can slap you again. Which means they only have 2 chances to hit you solidly over the 15s up time of Evasion as opposed to the 2 OP procs they're likely to get anyway, and the 5-6 auto attacks, mortal strike/bloodthirst, and WW

&gt; Loot council, that is your pro

loot council &gt; dkp for any serious guild | Problem is, you have to have 100% trust in the officers.
---
You just respec at 40 to get MS. Many specs do that, e.g. Shadowpriest go 5 disc, then hybdrid, then on 40 all into shadow for Shadowform. 1g is not really a problem, even while grinding for your mount.
---
I see! Thank you!
---
OP got a rare epic mount, Rivendare‚Äôs charger or what is it called, drops from Baron Rivendare in Stratholme.
---
Yeah because there are so few people with the same mindset.
---
Seems pretty obvious that despite all the cries for content this is one of the most popular thread.
---
I believe you can use your own mouse over macros on the healbot raid frames though I don‚Äôt use healbot. You can probably disable all the healing macros that come with the addon.
---
\&gt;I'll do all I can to protect it.
---
Create a pserver where people have to meet some toxic &amp; arbitrary threshold before they are allowed to log.

Meanwhile the rest of us will be enjoying classic :)
---
Go and play on private servers then lol
---
Dalson's tears from 54, hearthglen from 58, both solo. Didnt hurt to have mining/skinning since level 5 tho. I also ran a lot of different Blackrock instances
---
Thank for for sharing this burden with me.
---
Those don‚Äôt exist, you either raid in your raid spec or you are wasting 39 people‚Äôs time.
---
You had 7 tanks in MC?
---
unexpected Megadeth
---
This is actually the optimal approach for all classes (except for maybe hunters and warlocks), just more so for Warriors on account of their general lack of solo survivability.
---
The fact that you think you deserve a gear drop because you have shit gear is completely delusional, if you don‚Äôt have gear your contribution to the run isn‚Äôt even worthwhile... that‚Äôs like me saying ‚Äúi suck at the game I‚Äôm pissed I didn‚Äôt get the drop‚Äù

Picked up the brd axe at 54 last week, normally avoid PvP so hadnt tried it out, druid tried to jump me while looting a mob and low hp. Never in wow have I 3 hit another player of the same level, makes the warrior grind worth it!
---
There‚Äôs a lot of hate for Druid and I see most of it come from Warriors. I think they‚Äôre just suffering so much from 1-60 they hate to see Druid have such quality of life.  Especially considering how much better Druid tanks are while leveling compared to warriors, I think they start getting salty ;P
---
Eww, imagine using dkp in 2019
---
That‚Äôs some embarrassing reading comprehension you got there. You shouldn‚Äôt expose yourself like that.
---
Lol dude it‚Äôs classic, who cares
---
Arguably the rarest mount in vanilla. Most servers will have 2 to 3 at most.
---
Yeah, don't do this.
---
My thoughts exactly. The original continents had so much potential lore to expand on. Now that the technology has caught up to their potential to open up new zones and lore-lines, Classic+ would make the most sense. Yes TBC was amazing, but I have always wanted more of the original WoW lore to be explored. It probably won't happen because I don't think Blizzard will want to maintain two competing titles under the same franchise (retail and classic+).
---
One can hope.
---
Sitting in stealth, laughing at some guy for the superior GPH
---
Not sure, but I will report you, because we don't need attention whores. We need wow players.
---
Absolutely. Cancelled my sub and uninstalled immediately, despite how much this game is genuinely a part of my soul and all I've played since August...
---
Cant abide such in-your-face bootlicking by Blizzard. I wont support that.
---
Rare drop off final boss in stratholme.
---
So the issue is that the item is Bop and the rogue really needs it, but the mage also selects need because they plan to vendor it? (For 50s)
---
Oh man, yes friendly, i didn't recall this tiniy detail :P, I've been a rogue from BC to Cata and did it but it took me a longer time.
---
I do remember however, how many post there was about such a good premise of a rep for the class which was going nowhere and most rogue would ask ad aeternam Blizz to do something for it.
---
Last hope was Legion but no, imagine if they gave Ravenholdt to the rogues like they gave the Chappel of light to the Pally :( would have been awesome.
---
Congratz! \\o/

Hey there. I have a hunter main and debating on my alt! I‚Äôm mostly thinking Druid Lock Shadow priest.  I love pvp with world pvp and duels. I like the attrition gameplay of all 3. I have a lot of pvp experience over the years playing at glad and hero levels. I want something that‚Äôs going to be fun solo but not useless when I‚Äôm in a group with a couple friends at the stv arena or out getting into fights with small groups either.
---
You seem to spend a lot of time 'correcting' people on reddit. You must be tons of fun at parties....
---
Everyone in here like "some of us aren't 60 yet, I'm not even 40!" Meanwhile I'm at level 28 and still saying to myself "damn I can see my work / life balance struggling because if how much I'm playing"
---
After TBC introduced them, yes.  In Vanilla, no.
---
This is absolutely the direction I would love to see them take the game in. Classic+, the vanilla as the developers would have liked it to have been, would be brilliant.
---
Yeah my threat is way lower than my Feral/Balance leveling spec. NS/HOTW is fine for tanking dungeons but it‚Äôs not a raid tanking build for sure
---
Won a nice mushroom and a glass of milk
---
This is perfect thank you!
---
I would just read the icyveins full guide or summary for each class to get an understanding of them
---
Idk what you are talking about, you seem to be in extreme emotional distress, most likely caused by injury of some kind and so I naturaly wanted to know the cause.
---
Genuine question - Why is Arcane Missiles considered a bad spell for mages? Nearly every mage guide I've stumbled upon has said "nah, you won't be using that" or similar. Maybe frostbolt/fireball is a bit more mana efficient, and the dps is roughly the same. But my main problem is that frostbolt/fireball get delayed when attacked, maybe even several times per spell. Frost nova won't always be the solution either, for instance with ranged mobs.
---
I've been using arcane missiles frequently from the start, as almost all my levels comes from questing. It has been my go-to spell when under attack as I can maintain good dps even if they got shortened down sometimes. I recently respecced at lvl 36 and got 5/5 in Improved Arcane Missiles &amp; 3/5 in Arcane Focus, and it has been fabulous so far. My dps is now 100% reliable even if I get hit (which I will), and I feel I save lots of mana too.
---
My rotation usually goes something like frostbolt (slowdown) - fireball - arcane missiles (they usually reach med mid-spell) - fire blast - nova - fireball/arcane missiles (depending on HP left). Anything I should do differently against single-targets?
---
Exactly how I feel.
---
Did you at least check the contents of the boxes for valuables? I'm pretty certain you can open them and take stuff out as long as you leave 1 item inside.
---
Move this shit to the megathread on the front.
---
No, practically pointless to farm
---
Whitebeard with a grey beard :(
---
Got a nice laugh from this. Cheers.
---
Warrior is totally fine - Just make sure that you focus on green quests and green mobs. Warriors have a huge amount of downtime, spent eating or bandaging, compared to other classes. By killing green mobs you mitigate this and allow yourself to kill 3, 4, even 5 mobs in a row without stopping.  
---
Warrior is very hard from \~25-40, however. At lvl 36 you get whirlwind and at 40 you get Mortal Strike/Bloodthirst, both of which increase your levelling speed immensely.
---
Final tip is to never use heroic strike past level 16. Sunder armour is better for damage per rage (And you will be rage starved). It may not seem like this at first, but heroic strike prevents you from getting rage on your next hit, so it has a very high real rage cost. Sunder armour does less damage, but lowers armour, making your normal auto attacks hit harder, it also has a chance to be dodged, proccing overpower in-between your autos, which is extremely useful.
---
never lost to a rogue while leveling as arms. improved overpower... overpowers them.
---
I am fairly sure that some of them were DPS warriors who still rolled on it. I was not RL, just a PUG Mage minding my own business :)
---
Wtf
---
If you spent time farming pre-bis and some new guy in bad gear gets some armor upgrades, that's fine.  Most of MC armor isn't better than pre-bis.  I would hope at least the weapons, rings and trinkets go to the people who put time in and are carrying the bad geared people.  If that's not the case, I'd be mad too.
---
"Hurr-dee-durr, company make rule, peepole not abide! Rules is rules!"
---
I hope at some point you'll experience some serious injustice and a loss of freedom. At that point I hope everyone around you shrugs and says "not my problem".
---
That or we have been doing roll +1. It's fair because once you get a piece of gear you have to pass on everything else. You get a +1 roll on boss gear and a +1 roll on BOEs. Then we reset rolls at Domo and Rag. This allows gear to be distributed throughout the raid and is tracked on a spreadsheet.  Unless you're the only druid in the raid and get all the drops for your class xD.
---
I downloaded this, yet it only changes one trinket slot. Same bug in equipping trinkets and itemrack. Randomly choses the trinket slot rather than the default one
---
I am genuinely impressed.
---
They never added that as a proper mode did they? That battleground was awesome, it should be around permanently.
---
Just stock up on health pots
---
Do you rogues not get a antihealing poison or am I confusing this with a different expansion? I know palas can just dispell them but they've still gotta waste time doing so
---
Yes, Zul Gurub graveyard repeatable farm.
---
Dkp is the best.. loot council is the worst...
---
I guess it can be done!
---
I'm struggling with the playing urges as well. I'm working full time, I have a long time GF who hates (well not hate, but does not like it..) gaming and we have recently got a puppy (little fella has been living with us for four weeks now) and I hit the gym 4 times a week.
---
I have actually found out, that not being able to play as much as I want might be the best thing yet. I'm only lvl 39 Warlock and I'm constantly counting hours when I can play again. And better yet, when can I play again without distractions! For example, when the GF and puppy are away or something = my chance to hit those sweet dungeons without the risk of calling it quits in the middle of it. 
---
If I could play as much as I want, I would burn out too quickly (like overdosing), but now, due to this stupid thing called adult life, it's like consuming the drug all the time, BUT, in a slow pace. I have something to wait for all the time!
---
P.S only one hour to get home (GF and puppy are away) and I have the chance to undistracted hit that sweet 40 to get that sweet mount!
---
The poor Horse
---
Yeah, and just imagine if I then adopted your toxic personality. Yikes.
---
I see, thanks. :)
---
Only time it was hard for me to see was in STV when it was pouring rain AND misty at the same time.  Very cool and very difficult to see.
---
A good guild will take along even 'tourists', because not gearing someone in the roster and just dusting loot is a waste, since later on that same tourist could be converted to a full raider. You always want bench sitters to replace people that will drop out due to various reasons. Why do you think most guilds that were raiding AQ40 also had raid nights dedicated to MC/BWL/20-mans?
---
Arcanums!! So confused, can someone help.  
---
I'm building my main to be a bad arse 49 bracket pvp priest. I don't consider him a twink as such as he is my main, but I don't intend to level beyond 49 and I want to get him the best gear possible. 49 pvp is basically my version of end game.
---
I want to get him the best enchants possible and the lesser arcanums seem to be the way to do that for the head and leg spots. Now to get them you need to be a level 50, which I won't have. But they don't appear to be soulbound. So could I theoretically pay another player to get them for me and to apply them to my gear? How would that actually work if it's even possible?  
---
Would appreciate any assistance.
---
Of course. Illness does not prohibit you from playing videogames. On top of that, people who can't function in society are usually holed up on the internet, as it's a safe space for them.
---
The winterspring mount is a tiger no?
---
For some people, parsing on a boss fight is what they look forward to even if the content is easy.
---
Just spam Frostbolt or Fireball against single target. Which one you choose depends on your spec, level, spell rank and enemy resistances.
---
Okay thank you I'll look it up.
---
You're missing the point a bit, nobody minded small changes but we fought hard for #nochanges because we know once you give blizzard an inch...
---
Is Heartseeker really that unbalanced? Where can you see stats like that
---
Alternate caverns of time suggestions:
---
Use it for PVP battlegrounds in order to participate in classic WCII/III era battles as your preferred faction.
---
I hate ninja but im so frustrated as an hybrid I always see all t he gear I want just fly by my own eyes. Like when I heal the tank gear drops when I tank the healing gear drops this is driving me mad!
---
Excatly my sentiment. I would love to have classic+ content. I am not playing classic just because bfa sucks. I love classic design philosophy. If a new mmorpg with this much content and similar degin came out today i would play it too. I hate matchmaking, loading screens, instant teleportings for everything, flying mounts, session based multiplayer &amp; sharding tech, class design, the game being only about end game, end gaming only meaming raiding with everything else being useless and gear choice coming down a single number item level.
---
This is not only wow but all online games in the past 10 years.
---
Wth is that rule even? I looked it up and one of the definitions is "Disruption of player events or gatherings." Is that not what pvp servers are all about?
---
This took me a minute, but I see what you did there... Bravo!
---
Not for horde.
---
Unless you are Sm/ruin lock which is the only spec in the game considered viable for both.
---
I want to respec later on to tank pve instances. Is it really worth it? I feel like i can handle 3 more levels. I indeed am on a pvp server.
---
Welcome to the classic experience!
---
When you have 40 people and bosses only drop 4 items each, it takes a long time to gear people.
---
This isnt retail where you can get a full set of epics in a week of dungeons ans raids. Also, some classes just take longer to gear because too many people play them and raids want a ton of them (looking at you mages/locks).
---
It eventually comes around. Same thing happened to me. 2 clears of MC and 3 of Ony...no loot (im 1 of 2 hunters in my raid). Meanwhile a druid that hit 60 three weeks after me got 5/8 t1 in a single clear.
---
Fast forward to last night, I got 4/8 t1 and rhok'delar in one raid lockout. Just how things go sometimes.
---
Im guessing you play a class with high loot competition. Mage/lock/rogue. Eventually you wi get geared. There is a looonnnnggg time before the next raid tier.
---
What class do ypu play?
---
I truly don't get the uproar.  
---
they dont care about the actual message they just dont want politics at their tournaments I dont get why thats so hard to understand for people. They aren't anti-hong kong they just dont want people using their stage for political demonstrations which, in my opinion, is a good thing.  
---
Only reason this guy is getting punished as badly as he is is to send a message to not use their stage for political demonstration.
---
Why is that a bad thing? Must every platform be defacto an open forum for political messages?
---
This is why I always go 4g 89s 99c
---
Same here. Before Classic I couldnt focus playing anything else for months because I was that stupidly hyped. I havent played anything else since it came out. Still cancelled my sub, uninstalled etc.
---
Be the change. If everyone moans and whines and does nothing, nothing happens.
---
Ok, but again, they would not have done this if he was in support of mainland China, and that would have brought him into public disrepute, offend a large group of the public and damage blizzards image.
---
I've got an extra hand if you're jealous. Cmere buddy
---
Emperor, and he died standing.
---
Ew
---
I'm new to WoW but I love the feeling of not knowing what the fuck I'm doing lol. I look up talent guides and just level accordingly. I just complete quests and maybe will do some dungeons soon. Thanks ok
---
Others seem to agree with you due to the way we play video games today. We're far more capable of working out the best and fastest route to level and which gear will give us the best dps and what is generally considered the "optimized" way of playing. After all, playing something suboptimal would be wasting your time being inferior, so what's the point?
---
If it really happened to you, that's fine. I never had that problem. People understood that you can tank/heal/dps regardless of your talent tree and gear is taken by those who need it for whichever specc they want to transition to, regardless of what "role" they played.
---
That's actually the case on European servers now as well. Shadow Priest rolling on healing gear? Of course, there are going to be a single Shadow Priest per 40 man raids, so of course people want a set of gear for both possible outcomes.
---
OP: TRINKETSSSS YESSS BRAAAWWWKKK! (TBC reference)
---
I wish someone would animate this idea
---
Broh! Let me join your quest to conquer Azeroths seven seas !!!
---
You look ridiculous. Congratulations.
---
You realize that if you don‚Äôt think alliance on a pvp server = hardmode, what I just said and what everyone is saying isn‚Äôt targetted at you?
---
Seems like a joke to me. Not sure why you're assuming he's a moron
---
Considering the most likely path China is going to take to end the protests, it seems pretty dumb to jump on their side.
---
Reading the comments, sounds like the guy wasn't forward with his intentions. Got a buddy ret pally who will tank, heal, or dps (has gear for all three) but is very transparent that he's a dps and will be rolling on dps gear if it drops, he also rolls on tank and healing gear that none of the mainspecs need.
---
I disagree with the title, anyone fulfilling a role should merely be transparent with their intentions before joining/being invited to the group. However the pally was in the wrong.
---
BEH GUD.

---
And unless people stop playing the game entirely, what he proposed to me won't work as we will still play until our sub run out, and then which we will resub.

And if you say 'stop playing then', brings me to my other point where it affects me, so no bruh.

I went looking for a simple answer to 'Can Crits miss?', turns out there isn't one. Full explanation here: https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_table
---
But Crits are more valuable to arms warriors than just being double damage. You get a 'Deep Wounds' proc and also double the rage from that attack.
---
So having 5/5 in Cruelty is at least a 5% improvement in your DPS, probably a bit more.
---
Personally though I didn't get Cruelty early. I just went pure Arms till 40 and got Cruelty afterwards.
---
are you on the right wow account
---
&gt;Given the fact that we're not in school / high school anymore, it's a bit harder to play 30 hours a day.
---
&gt;MMOs are meant to be time consuming, yes, but the game should move with the general player base, not the hardcore player base.
---
You just described the change of Vanilla WoW into what it is today.
---
Poor excuse of a man at that.
---
tbf this is true of all classes with hunter being the only exception
---
They gotta cash in that expansion before Winnie the Pooh pulls the plug on them and they get no revenue from anyone else
---
Inb4 separate subs happen. (we can only dream lol)
---
I didn't renew my WoW Classic subscription, because I may not have much time to play this month. It expires it 70 hours though, so I should still be able to play.
---
Well, Classic doesn't care, and refuses to let me log-in...

If I had unsubscribed that would have been a political choice. I didn‚Äôt, I just want to know where the people that did are going. They are much more my crowd then the people staying. Same team?
---
Wash yer dick
---
&gt; never seen it again  
---
&gt; but I got the raptor
---
I did a combo of maintanking and healing for ~9 years, it's piss easy to gear up your OS without rolling over anyones MS as a tank or healer. Take all non-BiS on normal runs, then you just befriend a tank if healing, vice versa, and then stack the DPS so you aren't rolling against them. i.e 3 cloth DPS when you're looking for leather/mail/plate BiS DPS gear.
---
But do whatever, if no rules are stated you can roll need on literally every single drop according to Blizzard.
---
&gt;Why do people keep pretending that games can't be political
---
We aren't pretending that.
---
We are stating that it's a political matter and that this subreddit isn't meant to discuss that.
---
Blizzard has other games. This is something that happened in Hearthstone, there are A LOT of threads on the hearthstone subreddit, the HongKong subreddit, gaming subreddit etc. The biggest thread in this ENTIRE subreddit is now also dedicated to what happened there.
---
So to answer your question:
---
&gt;Why are the mods censoring references to what Blizzard is doing with Hong Kong?
---
Because they are trying to contain the discussion about that topic to the thread about it. And because it doesn't have to be discussed in the classic wow sub Reddit outside of it really.
---
You could say the same about Coca-Cola hiring death squads to kill union organisers in South America. It was the best thing for the company and its profits. It's still a monstrously evil thing to do.
---
How much make-up are they wearing?  Or is it all the vanishing dust?
---
*sack
---
Classic is a side project has they have said already in interviews. They also said that retail wow is still and will always be their main focus.
---
someone asked in a twitch interview if they plan on doing BC and they said no, but if they ever did its 3 or more years down the road.
---
Blizzcon they will prob talk about or hint at the new expack for wow.
---
840 quest hand ins, if you can keep up 7min per quest including riding back and forth then it is 98 hours.

Go 6/8 T0 for the spellpower procc, shaman king plate and T2 helmet and trinkets/neck/rings as appropriate.

It's currently my go-to suit for all things outside dungeons be it PvP or quests.

Also looks really cool.

I was a raiding priest for months..... So long that by the time Prophecy started dropping in MC no priest could roll against me because they didn't have enough DKP.  There will be droughts...   Hang in there, in my example i went from 1/8 prophecy to 8/8 in one run.
---
I can spend fifteen minutes doing it here and there and net 30g or better. I'm polite about it and only message a class once a day. Just wanted to see what others thought about it.

Your essential problem is you are one of a large number of utterly identical enchanters who all know the same stuff.
---
If you refuse to do the enchant, then within three minutes the person with mats will be able to find someone to do the enchant.

Have fun solving that.

It's just people auctioning stuff as they level / farm mobs. When you go outside of that limited range the prices seem normal. Like stranglekelp you can get from fishing sells for 10s each on my server because people aren't finding it questing.

I clicked a great number of my abilities until I bound everything in BC. Most noob thing you can do :v

I would 100% add you just because of your name :D wrong server :/

Not trying to stir the pot, but just curious if anyone other than myself unsubbed yesterday in the light of Blizz tip toeing around to please China?

I'm rather bummed.

Do you guys feel Blizzard was acting appropriate to protect their image?

That's exactly what retail has became.

This dude does NOT like spoilers!
---
Oh, right. I forgot
---
There you go again. You are fully ignorant of the fact that:
---
1. Even with modern technology launching classic at this scale would not have been possible without layering. Which means you are wrong and your opinion about classic WoW is already too emotionally driven to be taken seriously.
---
2. BlizzardActivision getting involved in politics has nothing to do with classic. Period. Wrong /r.
---
Your choice of words is terrible. 'vanilla lovers' lmao are you 12? Ofc, all streamers are corrupt too and probably payed by blizzard etc etc etc REEEEE 
---
You can't even argue. Don't try. Get help.
---
Because it is off-meta, Fiery Wrath gear is ridiculously cheap.
---
I mean just-more-than-vendor cheap.
---
You do when you don‚Äôt want to waste your time in there and keep the run under an hour.
---
Hunters have a ton of tools to fight rogues. I also make sure I always carry 2 stacks of free action pots. A rogue thst cant stun or slow you is near useless vs a hunter.
---
One of the many things I hope they'll add to Classic. This doesn't have to just be a trip back in time, it can be a whole alternate timeline! I'd give a lot to see how Blizz can develop Classic with the advantage of 15 years of tech and experience.
---
If I want to pvp early, should I just keep my pve gear or also collect other pieces with more stam on it? Concerning pre-raid and post raid too.
---
Fine, put 5 or so near the zone border. Make sure to not put in too many though, I don't want them to disturb the coyotes.
---
Your post isn't an argument. Logic 101 not being taught in schools is a real shame.
---
Ask your parents if they can raise your allowance from $5 a month to $15 and you‚Äôll be good to go.
---
I can‚Äôt explain this lump in my pants.

&gt;I had to steal over 4200 Heavy Junkboxes

Did you get any blue/epic BoEs? I've seen some guides say they may contain such items but I've opened probably over 500 of them myself and never seen any.
---
I mean it‚Äôs true. You‚Äôre low level. Lol You shouldn‚Äôt expect others to wait for you.
---
&gt;banning a player over his believes

---
It might be viable, I don't claim to know druid. Still, it surely can't be as good as a proper one-role oriented build.
---
Even if druids can work this way, it doesn't solve the issue for the other classes though.
---
Dire maul originally launched before rag was killed for the first time. It is a catchup dungeon that only benefits people who are still levelling.
---
Missed opportunity.

And this person is making assumptions on what I support/ don't support, or should support/should not support. I'm also free to to do what I want.

You gonna be upset when you realise arcane crown is better...
---
i did this as a kid in vanilla and it wasnt all that bad, yeah i remember it beeing a little bit annoying but its not like i spent months  doing that.

I don‚Äôt see anything wrong with what you‚Äôre doing, if they don't want to pay don't enchant it.

He's just a good samaritan who's trying to help dude

What's the addon for the top bar?
---
Seems like you don't know what happened.
---
If you hit 60 a week ago how are you "out of content"?
---
are you Pre-Raid BiS already? you cant have more then two lock outs in MC and ONy? have you even done those attunements? The second half of the game fricken starts at 60.
---
Go fight people your own level buddy. Glad you're having fun, but that's not fun for the dozen or so people whose questing you're fucking up because you're bored.
---
Holy shit this is exactly what I've been looking for.
---
Why would dire maul motivate you to get 60 more than Mc/only? Every week you're not 60 is a week of no Mc lockout. Why does dire maul matter?
---
Devilsaur set, Hide of the Wild in the upcoming Dire Maul. Those are 
---
the only items that sell, but they should be quite profitable.
---
less about it offending someone more about Blizzard not liking being forced to now deal with the political situation which is what they wanted to avoid in the first place which is why the rule exists.  
---
I dont get why people are in an up roar over this.   
---
And also - Fuck China.
---
It does indeed, deep frost makes your Frostbolts freeze mobs almost guaranteed *and* makes your Frostbolts guaranteed crits on those same targets, along with Ice Barrier which is an awesome shield for dealing with annoying mobs. So yes, you have to spec deep into Frost to feel all the goodies.
---
yikes buddy
---
Yeah, queue means full. But Sulfuras has been showing as full during prime time for a week or so now, with no queue to wait in.
---
Yeah - those interviews and answers I can't take for real anymore :D Too often Blizzard has just changed their minds. 
---
Also in another interview an employee hinted at another exansion after classic - as he said - that now that they downgraded the Client already. It wouldn't be too much work to get TBC etc going on it. Biggest part of the work is done essentially.
---
I meant solo farm. I've seen Frostadamus (mage) on Twitch and he only solo farms ZF. Also, Staysafe (lock) farms Mara and he said mages can't solo farm Mara, only locks, s-priests, and druids.
---
Think high elves for alliance would be more ''Classic''. Horde can get Forest trolls or Ogres :P
---
I'm not the same person but I'm tanking in MC right now without a Warden Staff. It's on my list but I haven't bought it yet, and I'm doing fine.
---
Don't let perfect be the enemy of good. Help where you can when you can!
---
Yep getting the skillup has value to people, so even if they're prepared to lose 10% or 20% of the value of the reagents, that's still worthwhile for them.
---
So you are telling me that i as a hunter am that bad at aiming with my gun while my pet tanks that i disi tegrate 6 legs?

Sounds like me tbh
---
If I can get into a group that'll stay together, will BRD runs be an efficient way from 55 to 58?
---
I'm an alliance player on a PvE server. Under what circumstances can other players or horde NPCs attack me?
---
What would happen to me if I wander into:
---
\~\~a contested zone, such as Redridge Mountains?\~\~  
---
I get this, PvP flag is voluntary at this point. 
---
a horde zone, such as Silverpine Forest?
---
a horde village, such as Tarren Mill?
---
a horde city, such as the Undercity?
---
You should applaud the people who were willing to make a sacrifice and sever their ties with Blizzard. But you shouldn't force anyone to take action (or just "be disappointed about  it"). That's their choice to do so. Noone should be forced to act "morally" about a third party issue. Especially when such action would cost them a big portion of his livelyhood. It's easy to judge from our couches and declare what others should do... it's always easy to make others make sacrifices for the "greater good". I call it "moral communism".
---
I‚Äôm in one of the top guilds in the world. Dual specs would vastly increase my enjoyment of the game, I could spend more time out in the world than stuck in mara or zf on my mage alt.
---
The worst thing is that he enjoys all this attention over the ninja rep
---
Who gives a fuck. Some dink made a stupid comment and lost his money. Thats it
---
Fair enough :D
---
Now you know.
---
Centaur on a horse?
---
Thanks man! Really enjoy making these but wanted to test the waters before I made more. Probably a part 2 coming up :P
---
Actually like the people you raid with?  That would be a really big one.  After you are geared and don‚Äôt really need loot anymore, that is when it can be challenging too.  After content had been on farm long enough, my guild would let people bring alts into runs for gear and let people run offspec.  When I would DPS, it was all about trying to top the meters, kind of like trying to get a personal best high score.  
---
Bad luck with drops was one of the most frustrating things you in Vanilla.  Everyone has their horror stories about how a particular item never dropped for their guild.  My guild had Nef on farm for months and months and we never saw a single Asscandy.  We had Chromagus on farm for about same time and we didn‚Äôt see Wrath drop until the week before BC came out.  We had more shammy T2 drops, Alliance side mind you, than we had Wrath drops from him. 
---
If aren‚Äôt getting drops because of loot council, I would ask why you are getting passed up.  Depending on your class, some of your raid pre-BiS might be your BiS for P1.  If that isn‚Äôt the case, might be time to find another guild.
---
Have you seen the contract?
---
Its basically "Whatever sound comes out of your mouth that we can interepet as damageing for blizzard is ground for termination and the purse getting confiscated"
---
When do people understand that loud != funny. Also the Harry P. and Jurassic Park music do not fit at all.
---
I can appreciate the effort you put into it, but honestly not funny
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm upset! Why aren‚Äôt you upset?!‚Äù
---
&gt;Just not as altruistic as it seems
---
Stop being petty. The action is good, the motives are irrelevant.
---
&gt;Now, if it was
---
If my nanny had wheels...
---
Sorry by waste of time I meant its toxic and not in the spirit of classic. It's a waste of my time cause I wont ever join those groups. 
---
I enjoy more aspects of the game than just acquiring gear. Running dungeons should be a fun social experience with teamwork and communication. Not a business transaction for the sole purpose of getting a slightly better piece of loot.
---
But you can play how you want. Hope I never run into you
---
Fishing Etiquette question:
---
If a pool of fish / floating wreckage is already being fished, is it appropriate or inappropriate to just run up and start fishing out of it. Same faction as well.
---
And we do not want to hear about politics then either.
---
Can someone explain to me this please, totally confused.
---
No one cares
---
Than take your non classic thread over to a more appropriate subreddit yeah? Piss off, this threads about WoW Classic not some streamer who broke his contract and faced the consequences.
---
If you were that concerned about Hong Kong, you‚Äôd get off your high horse and start protesting in your countries capital to show them how pissed you are at human rights being exploited.
---
But no, it‚Äôs easier to fixated on one company.
---
Just curious as to what dungeons I should be running right now? I have a 29 priest and am relatively new to the game.  I plan to respec Holy when I hit 40 but I have a few points in shadow and discipline.  I have been enjoying healing groups and have been running stockade a bit since it‚Äôs so short.
---
It really does depend on your guild. Our gm handles Loot, and knows the bis for every class and who need what most. Any concerns can be brought up but Loot takes 5 seconds per item. People get Loot after a raid or 2 if they haven't, or if others get tier bonuses first, they'll be on a list for next
---
And even if it was true, you can just make a macro of /y AAAAAAAAAAAAA /click GroupLootFrame1RollButton or something, can't you?
---
My first video ever lol some people I know got a few laughs all I wanted. Thank you for the feed back.
---
I‚Äôm almost 60 also a rouge and it‚Äôs also been on my mind if I will make a alt I‚Äôve been thinking about shadow priest or hunter
---
How many classes in the raid that are the same as you? are you a mage along with 10 other mages?
---
on the first one you have somewhat of a point. the second one just describes shitty people
---
Blackrock Mountain mobs give 'em out easiest I find. I started in BRD but was only getting one every once in a while. The guys in Lower Blackrock Spire seemed to give me more, but the rate isn't very stable. Sometimes I might get one every 30 seconds, sometimes I can go 2 or 3 minutes without finding one.   
---
Ye' can turn them in at the Ravenholdt hideout, east of Tarren Mill. Turn off auto-loot, check the boxes for anything valuable and leave a single item in the box, that way you can make a little money while still having the quest item. You'll need 5 of them per turn in. 
---
Have fun and good luck!
---
Mostly likely it's going to be TBC classic in a year or 2...
---
heals in priest.
---
In one of the top guilds yet you believe that you need 40 people playing optimally for MC.
---
Think your guilds lying to you mate.

It took me till level 29 or so to find someone random dude in thousand needles I enjoyed questing with enough to ask for an invite to his guild, and then it took me until mid-50s to start to find people in the guild that I enjoy playing with. Once I started doing some BRD runs and chatting in discord, I started making some friendships with people in the guild.
---
I'm aware of this but I'd rather keep my right hand on my mouse and my left hand on wasd.
---
I honestly thing people that are that rude should be reported, just so we can reduce the chance of then ruining someones day.
---
Yeah I'd bet all my money this guy just opens up full dps the second the pally pull and then shit talks him for not being able to hold threat.
---
I‚Äôm depressed but even I am less miserable on the inside than these people I think. Almost makes me feel bad for them. Almost.

---
Yeah, it really fucking sucks. I've been having more fun with Classic than any game in *years.* But I can't compromise my ideals for a video game. And hey, it just so happens that I have a level 27 hunter on Warmane...
---
Then why do they go out of there way to ram lefty politics down our throats here in the USA? 
---
They are hypocritically playing it both ways, because being political is worth money in the USA, and being political costs you money in China. 
---
A lot of people are pissed at the hypocrisy.
---
Also people are mostly shocked and mad about the severity of the penalty. They could have just made an announcement reiterating the rule and either given him a warning or suspended him for the next tournament. They did WAY more than that. Especially to fire the announcer dudes.
---
Do we know when pvp goes live? I really miss bgs.
---
why you muted homie
---
Speedrun / step by step guides are very commonly used these days, making regular leveling look 'long'
---
They don't ban all political speech, it's selective. If he had said 'I fully support what China is doing' I doubt he and the casters would've received such harsh treatment.
---
Similarly, they themselves dabble in partially political issues all the time - e.g. LGBT month, skins etc.
---
I will have to delete my son's warlock on Westfall, and see if that opens this as an option.  Thank you for the PSA.
---
That's very incorrect. It means A LOT more. 55 water. The entire mage population will migrate to DM. Enchants are introduced. Paladin and Warlock mounts are introduced. It's an entirely new era of the game. It's not 'just' a few new bis items. The face of the game is entirely different post-dm.
---
The no flight path at the rebel camp is what makes STV such a struggle for alliance. If we had a second FP like horde it wouldn't be so bad.
---
And he signed the contract.  Blizzard did nothing wrong.  He made the decision to open his mouth about a politically charged issue that had no place or relevance to the reason he was at the event.
---
Druid life matters.
---
I found one thats about it. feelsbad
---
Loot council is when 5 irl friends forms a guild. They then fool 35 other people that they are working for the guilds best, when in reality they are just working for these 5 guys.
---
They will twist and turn any argument to fit their class and role.
---
because he delibaretly played bad to let that happen. My 48 warrior comes with 2841 hp, and a top end damage of 350. That's up to 1k MS crits. How many hitpoints does a level 25 questing in Duskwood have? That's right, less than 1k. And this guy has five levels on me.
---
Yes it is alright to stay BM spec for a time aftering hitting 60
---
 but you really should gear up dungeon pre-BiS and spec MM to give your melee friends Trueshot arua.
---
Bruh
---
Yeeah, I think that's what will happen. I loved TBC, it's where I started, and I'd love to see WOTLK again too but I'm definitely torn about what I would like to happen with the game down the line.
---
I wish it was permanent
---
&gt; You'd lose the loot to another person and you had to wait A WEEK to have another chance
---
And that's if you even put in the time to have a high enough DKP to be considered for the item.  Otherwise you're still behind everyone who did.  It's a snowball affect in vanilla getting gear, because you not only get stronger, there's less guildies to gear, and then you have less items you need to get yourself.  Every new raid member who joins late is behind the brick wall of your past DKP.  Why would the raid gear the new guy?  They'll gear the person who has proven to be successful, and is capable of providing more utility to the raid.
---
Starting early pays interest.  Attending every raid pays interest.  That is, assuming you want to complete your raid gear, and be competitive in both pve and pvp.  There are disadvantages to being a casual player.  If you are one, you can jump in an MC pug, and maybe slowly get an epic or two.  Hell, with the state of the current dungeon gear, they may even take you along for BWL.  You're not getting into AQ40.  Maybe ever.  Until ZG and AQ20 gives you another opportunity to catch up.  Then you need to spend a lot of time in there, to earn your way into AQ40.  But the problem is the people that have been doing MC from day 1 are doing ZG and AQ20 too, and getting even further ahead.  
---
I never personally even made it into AQ40 for anything more than exploratory visits in vanilla.  Don't think we ever killed a boss.  And the thing is, I wasn't even really a casual.  I just started late.  This time around I'm going to try to be consistent from the start so I can experience that content.  Although my worry isn't that it will be released too quickly, but that it will be too easy with how powerful our current gear is.
---
What server
---
NPCs can always attack you, same as red mobs.
---
On a PvE server, there is no functional difference between contested/friendly/hostile zones. Players can only attack you if you flag (by typing /pvp or by attacking a flagged player). The only exception is if you enter an enemy capital city, which automatically flags you.
---
Preach it brother! Completely agree and well written.
---
I did not unsub.  I'm disappointed that Blizzard took the stance that they did, but I still enjoy their product and that's what matters to me.  It's no different than using any other Western product that is produced in China or altered to cater to the Chinese market.
---
I dont look to companies to be the leaders in political movements so I dont pay attention when they are pro or anti anything because its akin to listening to a celebrity and what they do or dont support.
---
If anyone here cared they can follow the money in regards to what blizzard actually supports. 
---
Of course Companies try to maintain good PR this is nothing new and doesnt apply to just this situation in anyway. 
---
Note Blizzard never actually made a comment (that I have seen) regarding HK.
---
If you dont want to support them thats fine and on you but I really dont get the outrage of them enforcing a rule that is pretty clear cut here.
---
Most of the responses are just moral posturing / virtue signaling and its fucking gross man.
---
They have those at lower levels, and most of them are great.
---
The missing diplomat is probably the only truly disappointing one, because it just ends with no resolution.
---
Keep beating the dead horse. Please unsub because honestly blizzard doesn't care about peanuts like yourself. try to farm more karma on r/blizzard and r/hearhtstone while you're at it chum
---
Still have a GCD for weapon swap, tho.
---
Adventurers be like: CAN'T SEE SHIT!
---
So to kind of set my mind straight on this, let's say that in the least likely scenario, every boss drops a piece of Warrior Might gear. Does this loot council just flat out give every piece of that gear to their MT above all else, even though there are two or three other warriors (one OT, one or more DPS) in the raid overall? 
---
I understand that it's important to gear out specific players above others, but in the overall "fairness" of it, wouldn't that ostracize other participating members? I can remember raiding MC for months, just waiting for specific pieces of gear to drop, and sometimes they just never did. So using my previous example, if all Might gear dropped, and the Loot Council gears up one sole warrior (MT), and the next twelve raids not a single Might item drops, was it worth it to the rest of the team that hasn't gotten a single item?
---
I'm just trying to figure out how this is better than DKP. My issue with DKP was that in my guild, when I was going for a set bonus, but an upgrade dropped, and all other mages had that armor or better, I was forced to spend earned DKP (sometimes going in the hole) because I wasn't allowed to wait for gear. Other than that, it felt more fair than a Loot Council sounds.
---
I bet he's super fun at parties..
---
&gt; They‚Äôre a fucking clown; don‚Äôt bother engaging them.
---
You're wasting your time. Which is kinda ironic given your intention with this conversation.
---
&gt; I'm also free to to do what I want.
---
So you agree they're free to do what they want? Then why are you so vehemently trying to convince them to do things your way?
---
You should have seen Kripp's chat today. Every second message something about Hong Kong, even tho it was cristal clear he wanted nothing to do with any of it.
---
That prompted a lot of people to call him a coward and what not - because if you don't uninstall and delete all your Blizzard accounts on the spot, you are obviously a pro China-shill that likes to drink Chinese semen all day long.
---
Some people can't accept if others don't want to get involved in certain subjects. There are many injustices in the world, and you have to pick your fight. If you feel strongly about THIS subject, it's your right to do so, but nobody is under any obligation to share your passion for that subject, nor your view on it.
---
It's simple for auto attacks, once you add procs, talents and specials into the mix it becomes a lot harder.
---
What do you plan to respec holy for? It's a popular thing to go shadow at 40 because you can finally access shadowform, but there's little reason to go deep holy for leveling, as most of the goodies there don't require many points. 10% healing is nice but not really worth giving up other things for.
---
I also wouldn't focus on dungeons too much until 30, but you're almost there already. 30-40 you can spam scarlet monastery nonstop, you should easily be able to find groups for it. From ~43 or so you can spam Zul Farrak until ~51, quest for a couple levels then do Blackrock Depths (and eventually Lower Blackrock Spire) all the way to 60.
---
I buy local food from farmers. I don't eat meat. I have solar panels on my roof. I don't drive a car, don't even have a driver's licence. When I can afford it clothes that pay everyone in production a good wage. I am a teacher that works with troubled teenagers. I live my life to make sure the world is better when I leave it, then when I came. I'm really not the person to ask these questions to.
---
I have to admit: My tech, yes, I do buy that, because there is none that is not produced in Asia.
---
Evolution has created some interesting combinations at the edges of the bell curves. 
---
Once you accept the fact that ignorance can be evolutionarily advantageous, you really start to recognize some wacky behaviours that exist purely on that basis. People's minds have literally been carved by evolution to see not what is true, but what is useful for their survival. It's quite fascinating.
---
I did that with a group consisting of a 40, 41, 2 42's and me at 44. And I have to admit that was the easiest run out of all of the uld runs. Now first off im feral dps at 44 so I was not doing much dmg. The second thing was we had no clothies in the group, tank and healer was both pally's
---
I feel like it's less mental illness and more being a child with a keyboard and no consequences.
---
I think you can run SFK at that level. If you're dead set on respeccing holy at 40 I applaud your courage, but it'll be easier to level once you get shadow form at 40. I recommend speccing Holy at 50 cause you can heal dungeons just fine as shadow until you start hitting the 50s.
---
This is honestly a pretty clever straw man to throw around, because nobody can really prove you wrong.  Good on you.  Can't prove it correct either though.  I was under the impression that the people who exploited it received suspensions.

Heal prediction

I don‚Äôt have a problem, but you replied to my comment refuting my point and you are clearly wrong. Sorry if that upsets you.

If you bothered to even read my first message, it was to ask what was it that can be done without affecting oneself, which was what OP said, and that is where the discussion started.
---
Vehemently trying to convince my way? Convince of what which way exactly? I'm not the one creating entire topics about the issue.
---
Please, tell me of your unending philanthropy and everything you've accomplished by shitting up a gaming subreddit with political outrage.
---
I'll wait.
---
Shit man I couldn't do it. 4200 heavy junkboxes, shit assuming adequate luck that's at least 500g.
---
Can't you report for cursing? "Language"? Lol probably what I would do. Blizz probly doesn't care much though.
---
Tremor totem.
---
Go round the outside?
---
Yeah, straight up I don't do enchants for tips. I am selling those. Not only is enchanting a pain in the ass to level, it takes a ton of money when you factor in how much gold you lost by not vendoring greens from 1-60. Then the recipes are rare drops and choosing to learn it means I gave up selling that recipe for 50-300g, depending on what it is.
---
So yeah, maybe if someone wants something that came from the enchanting trainer then it's fine to just tip but if I had to get a recipe, I'm charging a lot.
---
Otherwise what's the point of being an enchanter? If it isn't going to make money, I should just drop it, grab mining and then buy my enchanting mats and get my enchants from other enchanters for a measly tip.
---
If you plan to quest a decent amount, shadow is significantly better than holy starting from level 40. You can still heal dungeons as shadow all the way to 60.
---
But if you want to stick to dungeons all the way, then sure you can stay holy if you want. I was concerned that you wanted to respec holy at 40, I hope you're not doing this for Lightwell - it's a useless talent and most priests go disc tree instead, ending up with 21/30/0, 26/25/0 or even 31/20/0 trees.
---
Op? how old are you now?
---
I bet you they end up tape delaying everything by 30 seconds and have an editor/scrubber censoring every single camera feed.
---
Ok that was my original plan. People in my guild seemed shocked I wasn‚Äôt already spec‚Äôd holy so I figured I‚Äôd see what others thought. Thank you!
---
Would have been more fun if they corpse camped you.
---
multiple months long grind?? i saw some 1 with the wintersping saber around last week and the games been out a month to hit 60 and get the saber. how they hell did that guy do it then,
---
Yeah, good idea! I'm tired of making druids named "Cat" and joining "Legolas's Pet" guilds just to sneak in on raids.
---
Most certainly an unpopular opinion, but I'm not going to unsub just because a company enforced their rules that were laid out before this happened. You'd be boycotting many, many companies if you're trying to take an anti China stance. Where do you draw the line?
---
The contract is vague as shit, a lot of it comes down to how Blizzard interprets things.
---
appreciate it
---
&gt; So to kind of set my mind straight on this, let's say that in the least likely scenario, every boss drops a piece of Warrior Might gear. Does this loot council just flat out give every piece of that gear to their MT above all else, even though there are two or three other warriors (one OT, one or more DPS) in the raid overall?
---
&gt; I understand that it's important to gear out specific players above others, but in the overall "fairness" of it, wouldn't that ostracize other participating members? 
---
Not if they value guild progression over themselves. Which any decent raider should
---
I can remember raiding MC for months, just waiting for specific pieces of gear to drop, and sometimes they just never did. So using my previous example, if all Might gear dropped, and the Loot Council gears up one sole warrior (MT), and the next twelve raids not a single Might item drops, was it worth it to the rest of the team that hasn't gotten a single item?
---
Yes, to some extend. You have to balance it out ofcourse. Depending on the content.
---
&gt; I'm just trying to figure out how this is better than DKP. My issue with DKP was that in my guild, when I was going for a set bonus, but an upgrade dropped, and all other mages had that armor or better, I was forced to spend earned DKP (sometimes going in the hole) because I wasn't allowed to wait for gear. Other than that, it felt more fair than a Loot Council sounds.
---
DKP is fair aswell, we use that as our main tool with a lootcouncil on the background if we hit roadblocks. Problem with DKP is members passing on gear and hoarding for their BiS which hurts overal progression as gear actually gets disenchanted instead of being a minor upgrade. Which hurts the group.
---
Haha yea, it's pretty obvious to me that there will be a significant drop in subs/players between the phases if this sub is anything to go by.
---
The sentiment about needing a good reason to do something is echoed in all games nowadays. Mostly gone are the days when people were happy with riding around tyrs hands picking fights week in and week out without rewards or upside.
---
I think people overestimate how long a release of a phase or content will hold their interest. I hope I'm wrong though.
---
Some people are so displaced from logic and reality that they don't realize the same logic they apply to others also applies to themselves.
---
Oh for sure, I'd say etiquette demands asking for permission to need before any roll for an offspec item. People usually appreciate the courtesy.
---
My man, my guild won‚Äôt let you raid without having full consumes(resto pots, Elixirs, flask, sappers, GFPs,APPs etc, world buffs including blasted lands buffs) full pre-BIS warlocks need RoTV not RoWN, spell power enchant etc.
---
We aren‚Äôt going for a smooth MC, we are going for speed MCs.
---
And I believe people would enjoy the game much more if dual spec was implemented.
---
Do you need to buy a riding skill to ride this thing?
---
I've read Gaybeard more than once
---
I feel bad for that horse, getting crushed beneath all that beef

nah aq opening is the most rarest since it only drops once. these will drop more the once.

Do something productive instead of spamming the chat, now you've got time for it at least.

Thanks for your Input! I‚Äôm still trying to figure a bunch out but am loving the adventure.
---
Remember the old healbot just click this one button and it does everything for you experience?
---
You are the hundredth post begging for attention because you are sacrificing so much for the cause, and you will be the hundredth post deleted and forgotten.
---
Same here. I haven't played, looked forward to, or enjoyed a game in years like I have been enjoying classic. Nice to know I wasted my time and money with a 39 hunter and 32 mage on Skeram and a 29 priest on Herod all because Blizzard lost their values.
---
I have a macro for pet to cast growl when I disengage it‚Äôs pretty good
---
I got a similar message a few days ago when killing whelps to level skinning, except that he ignored me right after he sent his message so I couldn't even respond :(
---
Did they up the drop rate for this?
---
I have an unrelated hunter spec question. Is there a certain point in content release where going for 15% agi in survival becomes good/optimal?
---
Is there a way to make your unit frame have the dragon border with this version of Modui?
---
I guess all companies do that
---
You're right but it isn't just that. Games are made to be addictive, designed specifically to influence you to want to spend more time playing and more money on the game.
---
Do plenty of parents fail their children  by just letting them have total freedom to play all the time? Sure. Doesn't make how some games are designed (and monetised) exploitative and needing regulation.
---
This^
---
If you are going to go frost, then for the love of all that is holy learn when *not* to blizzard in dungeons.
---
Mages have become notorious for blizzarding all over the mobs, and being elites they ignore the damage and go after the mage. Oh, as well Frost mages notoriously spend lots and lots of levels looking for the lowest level mobs they can get XP on, so they dont expect elite mobs to actually break thru Frost Novas, and are shocked when they do.
---
They then run. Away from the tank.
---
Don't be that guy. Show patience and discipline, sheep what the tank tells you to sheep and kill what the tank tells you to kill.
---
It might result in less DPS, but it has a much better chance of you getting invited back.
---
Free Hong Kong!
---
Oh really what exactly counters a warlock in classic lol.
---
Ahh nice, that‚Äôs a bop I take it?
---
Im at 47 with 6 and a half days
---

---
305 weapon skill has a large impact on potential DPS, not only do you need less hit%, you will have smaller glancing blow penalty, you won't need to use edgemaster's handguards to be optimal (allowing you to use f.e. the devilsaur set). An equally geared human with the same skill &amp; RNG will always outdps the other races (when using a sword or mace).
---
If this is for a 'casual' character however, none of this matters and just do whatever you want.
---
Quick q. How do you offer/carry out ring runs? Is it just 20g if the ring drops? Or 20g up front and then run till it drops?
---
ONE PIECE GANG WHERE U AT
---
Yeah, I low balled the figure earlier when I said about 500G, It's likely closer to 700G from the boxes and the pick pocketing alone ended up netting me about 2,500G. It's not the most efficient way of making money, but money was made!
---
You can use mouseover macros with healbot. I use them for my dispells, though I use extra mouse buttons for them, not the l/r mouse. There is, however, an option in healbot where you select your spells to instead use a macro. I haven't experimented with it, but it would likely do the job.
---
Play with people you simply enjoy playing with and this isn‚Äôt an issue. If getting loot in your only enjoyment then Classic raiding is going to be painful no matter how you slice it.
---
Go back to the shadow!
---
How am I bragging? I am letting myself be heard. A corner stone of democracy.
---
Should have sent him salt
---
Definitely not as good as TBC, but still had that reeeeal good feel to it. The kind of feel that makes you play for 16 hours a day.
---
Pillows can take it.
---
That's the best strategy I've ever heard, will definitely be including this in my speech haha.
---
Not really a fuck up, thats kinda normal. I never did a whole zone. 3, 4 Quests in Tanaris, off to Feralas for a few quests, back to STV South, Badlands, handful quests in searing gorge, not off to hinterlands. Just quest where you still have quests open.
---
Oh look, a Sherlock Holmes reference. Let's see who gets it. :)
---
It‚Äôs too little for the no lifers, and too early for the casuals. That is all I am saying.
---
&gt; and didn't think about or look it up myself,
---
Seeing a lot of that in this thread.
---
It's going to get way worse. 
---
The grind really starts, once you hit level 53.
---
Wow thank you - you just opened a completely new world of scumbags to me. As if I don't know it could just be fcking bots but some1 still has to set that shit up and decide what is getting banned. I'm sure "Honkong" is not a banned word you fuckwig. 
---
Still I'd like to see how 50% of Classic Players are banned on the classic reddit discord. I wonder how far they would take it and ruin themselfs with that. My guess would be they just unbanned everyone in that case.
---
I don't even know why I'm answering you that because you obv. just came to be a smartass xD
---
I hope you have made you own day by being so cool on reddit :P
---
Welcome to your broken life you cunt xD
---
I thought the DM early release was to give level 60 players food and water that made sense for their level
---
I love it when people call you a loser for playing wow... inside the game. Don‚Äôt get it twisted, you‚Äôre playing a fantasy role playing game too.
---
Don‚Äôt be daft.  It‚Äôs political talk at a video game event.  If he had said something in support of China it would have had the same outcome.
---
I am not sure if these exist for classic. Would need a simulation of your character to come up with good stat weights. In classic there are so few items that for most of them it is pretty clear which one to pick anyway.
---
How do you sell UBRS runs?
---
Duck
---
Some of them might not wanna get assassinated yet. You know.
---
Look at some of the other comments, you need about 100-120h of game time to do the grind (I was wrong about it being timegated, but still). If you want to go through the pain of going at it 12 hours daily without interruptions then sure, you can have it in 9 days.
---
But how you can repeat the same kill quest for 7 days straight for 10 or more hours a day is beyond me.
---
How can you have problems against rogues?
---
Hunters are practically designed to defeat rogues.
---
Track hidden, flare, ice-trap, hunters mark, serpent sting. So many tools against a stealth relient class.
---
Not really since you can't just snipe someone from miles away. Chances are by the time they get close to you, you would've spotted them anyway on a regular screen. Plus it makes no difference in organized pvp.
---
Oh in that case. We wouldn't want someone to make an **effort**.
---
Mail yes, cloth no if they're min-maxing resto.
---
i‚Äôm at work right now so i‚Äôll have to check when i get home but from what i noticed this version is much more crude compared to the vanilla one. i, too miss the dragon borders and also the font on my action bars keybinds looks stretched and low res. i assume a more polished version is on the way, but until then i wouldn‚Äôt count on it. from what i saw you get to enable/disable the custom action bars, not change the way they look atm
---
Lol you're a fool if this is your train of thought
---
Lol, #nochanges
---
Hey there.
---
:O
---
Man, when people complain about the most minor things, it makes you wonder how shitty their life is..... I hope they find what truly makes them happy one day. Like a server where there are mining nodes everywhere and no one to mine them, but him.
---
Who exactly did you think Asmongold was?
---
Is olympus that same guild with the ninja looter neck beard who tried to brag on his 0/10 subscriber stream about it?
---
Is there a Looking For Group addon?
---
Ideally I was looking at something that might just parse the chat windows and filter based on specific terms.
---
to be fair when i played in vanilla on a mage i didn't realise it worked on spells, this looks like a blatant ninja though.
---
when i got it i was the only one rolling on it and had it equipped for a fair while before i realised it was only on melee attacks, no one told me the whole time i had it on either
---
Must admit, when I was questing in darkshire a few weeks ago I encountered brain eating ghouls who have a horrible little disease that drains 5mp5 for 5 mins (10 mana every 10 seconds), this stacks and at one point I had three lots of this on, where my mana pool wasn't even acrost the 1k mark yet.
---
However I didn't feel like it was actually removing any mana, basically I'd heal to full, pop animal form which would net me to 0 mana, then I'd dps for 40secomds whilst waiting for mana to come back up, I knew from vanilla that it never effected you during animal forms but maybe the debuff was too tame to effect me?
---
Does make a big difference though, we're meant to be vulnerable in base caster form, having all our mana drained completely removes most of a druids gameplay, especially in a pvp environment.
---
I want my pvp title.
---
\*Ba dum tss\*
---
Exactly
---
Because it wasn't relevant to the point I was making, and I had no reason to distrust the validity of what he said. My point is still completely valid, the original Vanilla as released in North America and Oceania had a far larger gap than both Europe's Vanilla and Classic from Release to Dire Maul.
---
Guess who's back?
---
I meant as in just generally working towards every rep exalted it doesnt have to be hydraxian first lol.
---
This would seem to be true.  I still might do a cheap proc'ing enchant 1st though for testing.
---
But then he should not have agreed to it.
---
Scholo has nothing of worth to healers, yet people still did Scholo in vanilla. People also did UBRS. Funny how that works. People do things for fun, huh go figure.
---
Ive mention it is around 700agi buffed but i havent done the math yet to be sure how accurate that is.
---
Keep the faith! If you're DPS try and top the meters, despite other players maybe having more raid loot. Same if you're healing, try and keep over healing to near zero!
---
Curious what class you are too...
---
go on den, give us a numbar
---
NE is good for mitigation tank and decent for PVP. Human is best for PVE DPS and threat tank. Gnome is best for PVP.
---
That said, play whatever you want. If you decide to min/max as non human, you would have to drop a pretty sum for edgemaster's though.
---
like day and night
---
They probably skipped school thinking the game would be literally empty during the day
---
I sorta agree, but it makes a great opening for the story. We can find out that we are in fact, in the wrong timeline(or, a different one)
---
The bronze dragonflight can show us hints that, in the future, the horde and alliance forces damage the planet, start the 4th war, and unwittingly awaken nzoth.
---
Chromie sent us back to fix it.

It has the potential to be fucked up, but a man can dream..
---
He can ask for summon:)
---
I dunno. I've heard Heathstone increases your odds of losing your money and job
---
See what you did here :-)
---
targeting one rat at a time is pretty slow. Just go the the starting area and buy the lowest DPS weapon that you want to train, remove all your gear with stats that affect weapon damage and optionally put on gear with int. Then pic a mob slightly below your level and just auto swing at it while you reddit on the other window. It will take a while for the mob to die with that crappy weapon.
---
Hunter for easiness, priest for utility / boring leveling (pre-40)
---
Ive seen this kind of weather all the time on some pservers. Ive never seen it once yet in classic. and yes ive used the console command for weather density.
---
Warriors complaining about rogues... Wait for tbc and Wotlk KEKW
---
Exalted with bloodsails, the real challenge!
---
Ack. Everyone needs to make there own decision, just understand the decision you're making.
---
Not much of a debate if it‚Äôs a bunch of people all agreeing with each other and have the same opinion.
---
Priorities
---
Yah, your right.. I'm sorry I work 60 hours a week and still make time for friends and family even though I dont believe I'm a casual player and try to hit atleast minimum a level or two a day. I'm sure theirs a tone more players that have a maxed lvl 60 character or two that dont yet... 
---
I'm not asking them to cater to me.. but with over 12k upvotes on this post I dont feel like I'm the only one that wants the roll to slow abit
---
‚ÄúBlizzard, on behalf of ‚ÄúChina ‚Äú, we‚Äôre taking Hong Kong!
---
Technically that would be a warlock.
---
It doesn't matter for ME being 60. It matters because it's the best dungeon to farm for Gold per hour by a landslide and releasing it before the majority of players are even the level to do it just fucks with the economy.
---
All those mages that plvld to 60 are gonna have mounds of gold more than they would if they waited for phase 2 to release it.
---
I simply play whenever my son is sleeping then skipping an evening once in a while to keep my wife happy. 
---
I can play from ca. 19 / 20 - 23 / 24, then wake up again at 6 to get the family ready and head for work..
---
So far I have made it to lv50 on my warlock while all my friends are 60 and raiding, but I am having fun and enjoying my family.
---
I'm 100% on the same boat as you, I'm not even 30 yet (dinged 29 just before I headed into work this morning). When I saw the news that diremaul is coming already, not even 2 full months after it was launched, I almost just packed up and stopped playing.  
---
I gave up on playing another game I love a great deal (EQ - specifically TLPs) because its nearly impossible to "adult" and keep up with the content, I was confident when I came to WoW classic that they wouldn't be doing a light speed release schedule, but it really seems that they're willing to sacrifice keeping the game fun for everyone to just pander to the same impatient people who got WoW ruined in the first place - those that rush to the end and want more more more more more more more all the time. We don't need that. Diremaul should be pushed back another 2 months, we shouldn't even be getting a whiff of phase 2 before 6 months are up, but here we are, seeing it coming not even 60 days in.
---
Haha, same and I'm only level 25.
---
&gt; People are over blowing DM loot.
---
They're just repeating comments they hear elsewhere.
---
There is a pattern to it, if you move minimally for around 3h you instantly get kicked out. If you are fast at logging in you don't get queue anyway but I suspect OP just remoted into his computer to keep online. There are ways to get around this though.
---
&gt; Again, please don't think of what I asked as an attack, it wasn't and just my luck to find someone who actually can take the moral high ground and say "well, actually, I do this..."
---
I really enjoyed you comment, since it was a thought out and respectfull reply. I not once saw it as an attack. If wish everyone in this thread would discuss the way you do.
---
Player agrees to rules -- Player breaks rules -- Player is punished exactly as laid out in rules.
---
More accurate to what happened.
---
Except politics is heavil discussed on that discord server all day long
---
For me personally, it's video games. That probably makes me a hypocrite, but when political views enter my games, the line has been drawn. 
---
I'm not saying that only Blizzard was wrong here, btw.
---
No, it looks like it's much easier to fight against those bringing complains and awareness so that you yourself don't have to do anything nor feel bad for it.
---
Don't bring HK up if the entire point of your post is telling people to stop bringing awareness and helping.
---
i literally watch those clips only to feel better about myself LOL

900g is already the reduced price. It is 1000 but since you need exalted anyway I told you the 900g right away
---
Why is this so hard for people to understand?
---
Again, I‚Äôm pretty indifferent to this, but the gold aspect seems to be weak, as people say DM is great money making
---
No fury warrior will ever be able to out threat a bear using MCP, period.  I don't know where you heard this bullshit from but smack them hard.   Also at this point with a DW fury tank your completely removing the mitigation advantage and allowing the bear to be a superior damage reducer based on armor/Dodge/hp alone.
---
There are plenty of guides out there about this exact subject.  Repeating elitism that falls more in line with ignorance seems to be the norm for this meta.  If your guild healers have already the gear to support a fury tank, you should have moved to a bear tank and let that warrior fury dps.  It's straight retard to have a fury tank when the bear is an option.  I mean literally full potato retard.
---
Imagine being on a reddit discord
---
MORTAR COMBAT!!
---
Anything that increases your attack damage by x% as warrior increases your overall damage by more than x%. This is because more white hit damage means more rage, which in turn means more damage. 
---
Crit gives you
---
- more damage on your auto attacks
---
- more damage on your special attacks (+Impale)
---
- more damage through Deep Wounds
---
- higher rage generation
---
So it's probably about a 8-10% damage boost if you add all those effects up, especially early on when you have absolutely no crit on your gear.
---
To be fair, *good* hunters can solo tribute runs. If you check the movies, it requires quite the practice and the dedication. You can't do it while netflixing like normal farms. And you need mulitple runs for the inflation to really hit. 
---
Lots of hunters won't be able to properly pull it off or burn out after a couple of intense runs.
---
Just as Blizzard is free to do what it wants, so are the players/customers. So feel free to help them lick Communist China's boots. The rest of us will stand with the principals of Freedom.
---
I made friends with an awesome tank when I played a survival hunter in tbc. We ran heroic ramparts etc and I would CC 3 mobs for ~45 ish secs and then 2 mobs for over a minute iirc. People would join and not see the typical mage/rog CC and be like uhhhh we can't do this! If he (tank) didn't vouch for me every time, I'm sure I would have gotten kicked from many groups.
---
Prior to pull I would drop a freeze trap and wait for the CD to reset. Then I would wyvern sting on pull and pull 2 more mobs with multishot toward trap. After the trap would trigger I would FD and drop another freeze and distracting shot the mob running back to the tank. If wyvern faded b4 first mob was dead I would reset cds and sting again, FD and drop freeze trap for the next mob that thawed from the first trap. 
---
It was so much upkeep and I did barely any dps until the first mob or 2 was down but man was it fun and engaging. I'm a bit sad that CC isn't used as much in classic, I'm rolling hunter again but it just doesn't feel the same without CC.
---
Man, Ravenholdt was my first server on classic, I was 58 when TBC released so never got to experience end game. Have a 31 Rogue on classic now, hoping I can make it this time lol.
---
Because blizzard silencing some members is totally serious as a company literally killing people. This shit is stupid and its gonna blow over next month.
---
So you‚Äôre effectively gatekeeping me from talking about HK? Hilariously ironic.
---
what happened in 1989 besides a lot of cocaine and whisky?
---
I just don't want to be a dead human, green human, blue tusked human, or a cow
---
Ok. Thanks
---
Breaking news!
---
That's not the point at all. The point is it's a goldmine in DM and the whole reason they didn't release it in phase 1 (according to blizzard) is because of how it can be farmed for insane amounts of gold.
---
They didn't want that in phase 1. Gear is irrelevant, the amount of Gold that dungeon can generate for a single player solo farming it is the reason they didn't release it at launch.
---
Do you think he would've had the same outcome if he made a political LGBT statement for example? Because that's happened already.
---
I meant the real beginning, when your only spell is basically fireball, hehe.
---
Are we a bit touchy, huh?
---
And people fucking hate when they do it. and they usually dont do it while they are under contract / rules to NOT DO THAT
---
Cool. So turns out they they had a phase plan and everyone knew that content would be released slowly. I'm not saying to never add this stuff, I'm simply pointing out to every single person who is trying to speed up the ALREADY PLANNED timeline that this is the exact same shit that people then complain about was a problem with retail. I want these phases to last and if they end up putting out expansions I want those to last. I don't want to rush through the classic experience in 1.5 years and be done. That's fucking pointless.
---
They will Keep it and it is actually quite fun tbh. Watch your rank increase over time:
---
Yes the gear Situation sucks with the  System. But since most PVE gear can be used as good PVP gear it is fine.
---
Only Problem is - to be successful at pvp - you pretty much Need a premade and Need to be doing pve as well to have some decent gear...
---
But it is a lot of fun still - even without insane rewards. The grind is still rewarding (Feeling wise)
---
You're kind of proving his point though.  It'll last until the 3rd 40 man raid (at minimum), and it comes from a 5 man dungeon that people seem to believe will become deprecated.
---
Yep -- metroidvania wasn't even a concept until Castlevania: Symphony of the Night which allowed game world exploration and retracing like in the Metroid games.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt go for the Survival build personally. You don‚Äôt need to be hit capped to run five man dungeons and you will pretty quickly get to at least 5-7% hit. 
---
I would prioritise Strat (UD) to get Mask of the Unforgiven (2%) + weapon drops and pre-bis cloak if you‚Äôre lucky. 
---
Devilsaur (2%)
---
Blackstone ring (1%) which you can farm yourself. 
---
From there you only need 4% more which you can find on Shoulders, Bracers, Boots and Weapon. If you are in a hurry, consider Warmonger (3%)
---
Yes one at a time is better. Using both drains focus way to fast and pet won't be able to growl to hold threat. 
---
I've seen a lot of varying opinions on whether bite or claw is better. But having used both individually, I can say with relative confidence that I didn't run into any threat issues either way so you'll be safe picking whichever you like.

To be fair claw does drain focus kinda fast, but again I don't run into issues. I currently run an owl that auto casts growl, screech and claw and I haven't noticed any threat issues that didn't happen when I ran a cat with growl and bite auto casting - and this latter set up would always have a bit of focus left over at the end of a standard fight, so I knew that it was growling as much as possible.

You‚Äôre always welcome to hit me up with any questions. I‚Äôve remember starting out and how intimidating it is and sometimes guides are missing that one detail that makes sense. HMU with your IGN or btag in a pm if you like.
---
Nope, only Bis for non-human/non-Orcs
---
Those guilds will start having trouble filling the MC run because many fully geared peeps don't want to join and will be glad some tourists can take their place.
---
I always spent time in Un'Goro for Rich Thorium. However, due to the fact that there are an increasing number of players high enough level to farm that area, you may find it difficult.
---
Not sure if Silithus has nodes available in it yet (I know it's not populated with quest-givers), but if it is, that's a good place. I'm sorry I don't know for sure, since I haven't leveled mining.
---
As for the engineering thing, I don't recall there ever being a need for any specific faction. Maybe Steamwheedle, since some of the trainers and quest givers are in their cities (Gadgetzan, I believe). Again, haven't leveled engineering since actual Vanilla, so I could be wrong.
---
Sure sure. Just admit you drank it all.
---
57 warrior here. Expect questing a lot until you hit 60. . If you have a hard time finding a group as a tank than all hope is lost as tanks are hard enough to find already.
---
What the actual fuck
---
Not ironic at all. You're trying to stop people from helping, I'm criticising that. You're not talking about HK, but about how people shouldn't act.
---
It's not the content that I'm worried about or the gear. It's the economy, it's the fact that DM allows certain classes the ability to generate hundreds of Gold solo in a very efficient way.
---
That's literally why Blizzard said it will be in its own phase and not at launch.
---
The stipulation was to have layering gone by the implementation of phase 2, not to implement phase 2 when layering is gone.

This is about continuing giving money(support) to a company that bows down and supports the most vile communist regime in the modern world.

Would you give your support (money) to a company who advocates for slavery and bows to the whim of the kkk?

I hadn't even considered that this might be in response to subscriptions dropping.

Fuck this was painful to ready. Holy hell.

Man, they had to find a server with ALL those names available.
---
One exception and it's "just as toxic as every other game".
---
No, that way someone with a bunch of time on their hand is rewarded for simply being online. Not winning a bunch of matches.
---
First respec is 1g, second is 5g. You don't need to respec Prot at all before 60 (maybe 57 or something if you only level through dungeons from there on), and those 4g you save are not worth the  slow crawl you  are currently having due to a shitty Arms spec without MS at 40.

They just recently added GuildRecruitment as well, so I guess they have a timeline in mind for these.

How come?

Maybe its because I am not a native speaker, but I still dont see it. Thanks for answering though
---
Nah man this is the one from Brill :)
---
We ended up with retail because vanilla wasn't casual friendly. Because casuals had to play catch up. Because casuals never got to see AQ40. Because casuals couldn't get rank14. It was a time sink, and adults couldn't put in the time. My god, the amount of forum posts back then that were exactly like this one.. that's why we got retail. The majority of players were casuals and Blizzard decided to cater to them.
---
Guilds that are actually serious about raiding use loot council. DKP was a dumb system 10 years ago, and it's worse now.
---
Questing is an excellent way to level. Jump around zones focus on green and yellow quest. As you gather quest for a dungeon then try and find a group in your world chat as you continue questing
---
This. And trolls in Hinterlands.

Basically never. In Naxx gear with world buffs it pulls ahead but losing about 300 AP contribution to your group offsets the value to a raid.
---
this is the reason you are disappointed with him and not the 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000 other reasons hes a trash human being?

Gear that is the same level of power as naxx gear but tuned for other specs / play styles maybe? Like a true shadow set, feral set, dps warrior, etc. Could be neat!
---
You know healing classes like paladins and druids don't need to spec into holy/resto to heal dungeons right? I'm feral/NS and I've healed about 60 percent of my dungeons and tanked or dps 40 percent
---
Yeah, quests give same exp regardless, mobs drop off

This is a good breakdown. You get it.

I am glad, tone is not conveyed well through type.

I wish you good luck.

I'd just like to say that if this guy is a rogue farming thorium all day, he could be easily making 50-60g per hour pickpocketing brd with zero competition, all as raw gold.. What I'm trying to say is that guy is not only an asshole, he's also an idiot.

Haha ok you just wrote a bunch of bullshit for no reason. You clearly don‚Äôt know wtf an authoritarian governments means.

---
If you come into my pie shop talking about being a Browns fan. Im going to kick you out and ban you for life. As is my right.
---
Is wanting to play the game without politics and agendas thrown around like so that terrible?
---
what a slimey fuck
---
More solo play for higher geared / skilled players would be nice. Having to group for EVERYTHING gets old.
---
I keep multiple ranks on my bar so I don't spend mana on overhealing. If I'm missing 300 hp I'll use rank 4 Healing Wave for 155 mana instead of rank 6 (highest I have atm) for 265 mana. If I'm missing 1000 hp then yeah I'll use the rank 6 or just stop and eat food.
---
I would say this is generally frowned upon.
---
Nah, I can see retaliation coming though.
---
This comment is predicated on not actually understanding how the vanilla honor system works though.  You get more honor for people closer to your level.  Eventually 0 if too low.  You get more honor for players who are higher pvp rank.  You get progressively less honor for repeat kills, eventually becoming 0.  Why would someone trying to rank up in pvp camp someone who ranks them up slower and slower?
---
Sure, they're probably going to kill you.  Then they're going to move on.  Your option to counter this, which I highly recommend if you're a casual player, is to play on a pve server.  Most of these problems will go away.  It's not really fair to dictate to the people who want a real pvp server how it should operate.

#SquadGoal
---
Idk what the hell you mean by 1% and .01% FPS. Nor has it ever been a question for any other game I‚Äôve ever discussed performance on. 
---
I get a consistent 144fps with minor adjusting in high intensity situations. Really not that impressive in 1920x1080. It‚Äôs a game from 2004. 
---
Do you feel like you‚Äôve won yet? Because the game only runs at 144fps 99% of the time?
---
Since we're doing predictions, I don't think they're going to make any announcement about the future of Classic at Blizzcon, outside of what is already announced. Meaning they won't touch on what's coming (if anything) after phase 6. I think what comes after that will highly depend on how many players stick around, and 3 months after release is still too soon to know that.

They were also on Golemagg, but they merged with another guild.

Kromcrush horde are the scummiest. I've been hit by so many ?? Stealth rogues while eating that any rogue is basically a KoS at this point.
---
&gt; Again incorrect.  As an EU player the release of DM next week is still far too early when compared with the timeline we saw in vanilla.
---
Complete bollock. WoW launched in the EU on February 11, 2005. Dire Maul launched in patch 1.3 on March 7, 2005. That's 24 days after the game's launch. For comparison, it'll have been 49 days since the launch of Classic when we're getting dire maul.

As of last night, I had to not only select my realm, but my region as well. And the Americas tabs are hard to see/click on.

---
So controversial.  Pvp on a pvp server?  How dare you.
---
Well you apparently didn't read my post but instead reply with the same things many do under all ideas to change something in classic. Can't argue with people that have the "no changes at all" attitude
---
That's not the point. Blizzard had a content release plan laid out and is deviating from it. Do you think they didn't know that DM was released 3 weeks after EU launch when they came up with their initial plan?
---
i vendored mine but i'm also curious if i made a mistake lol
---
ubers and loobers
---
Yup, supply exceeds demand.
---
Also, putting a ton of gold into a few people's pockets won't cause automatic inflation. The gold needs to circulate and get in lots of pockets for inflation to really happen.
---
How did you know?
---
Just keep politics out of gaming. That is all I am asking for. On a personal level I condemn everything China does, but it is just not the right place for it. I react the same to every other political topic or shit like soccer, be it here or in lfg chat.
---
If you want to be politically active, that's great and all, but please do it somewhere else.

I can relate to not liking animations, it‚Äôs what pushed me away from ESO.

I strongly encourage all horde mages on Bigglesworth to wear of frozen wrath because of reasons
---
I am partially in that boat, rolled a Priest because I had an Alt priest in retail (WotLK; my main was a shammy, but I am alliance this time).  But kinda getting bored of it at 47. My plan is to push the priest to 54/55 and then just heal in dungeons to level / gear up for raid.  Currently having fun on my rogue alt, but also toying with a mage.
---
That's a very fair opinion, and to be honest I mostly live my life like that as well. 
---
I think personally, it boils down to Blizz losing a lot of my interest and trust over the past 10 years, whether it be a shitty expansion, or just a total disconnect to their NA market in favor of a larger market on the other side of the world (I know it's a business). I don't really have that passion for them anymore, and I'd like to see them change. I feel I can only show them how I feel with my wallet, so here we are.
---
Anyways, that's just where I'm at!
---
No, preventing other people from progressing a quest chain by abusing AI is not even close to what PVP servers are all about. Go fight people at your own level in Arathi and quit fucking with lowbies in a starter zone.
---
itemrack addon does this automatically
---
Warrior lvl36 here. Love tanking. Tanked all dungeons available for my level so far. Would it be hard to find guild to raid with at OT/MT position if I'm pretty casual and may not always be able to login on raid schedule? I know that most raids require up to 2 tanks only and guilds probably rely on tanks being available at specific time slot. Does this mean raid tanking is impossible for players with real-life responsibilities and etc?
---
Want to know what gear (DPS/Tank) should be my goal to farm at high levels. I think it should be easier to find PUG raid as DPS role.
---
Man talking about hard quests. Those guys over in the jungles of Kong sure have it rough right now. You'd it's 1989 or something.
---
nah man no mailbox no nothing still sucks ass, especially you do not have a mount yet at that level. It probably was made to make the alliance feel like the faction being invaded and their continent and living space taken away by the horde. The problem is you do not realize that as Horde. As someone that plays alliance for the first time I was pretty surprised
---
Cool. I need to look into titan panel. Have not used it for years.
---
So, a person violated the terms of his contract by getting political, when his contract states not to get political, then he gets punished for it, and people are mad at the company for punishing the contract violation in an industry that isn't supposed to get political?
---
Typical.
---
Less competition also means less people running those earlier raids right?
---
Hit cap is over rated. Unless you're in a super tryhard guild I recommend skipping the survival 3% hit build entirely.
---
BM is the best spec with bad gear unless you're raiding when your pet has poor uptime.
---
20/31/0 takes over with better gear and in raids. You also probably need to farm gold still in which point this spec is also better for maraudon farming and DM north (if we can do it) so put 2 points in improved aspect of the cheetah.
---
You should try for hit cap, but it's super easy to get with a warmonger sword if you need it for specific situations like tranqing magnadar in MC.
---
&gt; why would you take a fresh 60 or someone close to 60 when an equally as geared person is available?  
---
Welcome to vanilla. It's not designed for casuals. You don't get to raid if your gear is bad or worse than someone elses (unless you're part of that guild and they need to gear you up). You have to put in the time. Can't put in the time? Vanilla doesn't care. Having pre-raid BiS shows commitment, which is what guilds are looking for. But don't worry, you'll get your pre-raid BiS in your own time and you will find a guild who is at the same level.
---
&gt; Also this is being released less than 50 days in. There is an argument that it is kind of quick. Either it should have been there at the start or added with more content. 
---
It was released about 3 weeks into vanilla on EU so it's pretty slow actually.
---
101!? That's outrageous! Very impressive indeed.
---
Pre-STV-Fishing-Extravaganza-BiS...
---
But only for Horde!
---
If you're going to open with poly wouldn't it be better to Pyro then ap/pom Pyro a second one
---
Not so much excuse there. They could be cutting their losses to clear inventory. Maybe they're undervaluing their own harvesting effort: "Free herbs". 
---
Sounds like it might be possible to exploit them by buying the consumables when they're underpriced and selling them when the market recovers.
---
that has nothing to do with what you previously stated.  keep playing the game all you want, but dont knock people for trying to help
---
Gotcha! I must have misremembered what my friend told me. Thanks for clearing that up! 
---
That almost gives me hope, I might try for it...
---
For pvp u rock dmg and healing gear. With some exceptions on high stamina + naturdamage gear. 
---
If u wanna hop in raid you should have a set however with as much + healing on. Assuming we dont have mana tide and such for 30/0/21 u want all the + healing per mana spent u can.
---
I would really love to know how many of us there are who canceled. I canceled mine last night too, and it actually renewed yesterday. I can't decide if I should play out the month or not. I really hope they walk back the decision, cuz damn, playing classic was making me so happy.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community

Thanks for clearing that up for me, my bad!

I‚Äôve found the items it comes up with less than optimal, may be user error though.
---
Oh shit these quotes are sick are they from WoW??
---
&gt; I assume you don't play a lot of mmos outside of wow?
---
I actually do from time to time, and never heard of this one.  I find it very hard to believe that it was one of the most anticipated mmos compared to games like FFXIV, which I imagine almost everyone has heard of.
---
It was a zerg guild. You can't expect good players when you literally invite anyone who asks. That is the definition of "random baddies".
---
&gt; You did something about it and kepenit that way. Not everybody need to follow. Some people like to play a game to enjoy and not get into politic things.
---
I never asked anyone else to unsub. Why are you suggesting I ask people to follow me in that? I only said "we" (people who do care about this) need to keep this heard. Only when people who feel strongly about something keep getting the message out, will something ever change.
---
It's not hard, say "If you don't unflag, don't expect buffs or heals."
---
Unfortunately, most classes in Classic are like that.  Can try rogue or warrior which is more reactive.  Enhance shaman is fun too.
---
Omg, you are going to get the Legendary daggers that fast?, Gratz!
---
Gear doesn't need to inflate, they can just expand itemization. So many specs suffer purely because all the gear is aimed at rogues, warriors, and priests. A new raid could just have enhancement shaman tier instead at the same power level as naxx gear.
---
&gt;a real quest line but like some GOT side stories, it's there and nothing ever happen.
---
Blackfish, Catherine's ghost, everything in the last  2 seasons, such a waste of potential...
---
 Can someone explain the whole tier set system? I see them referenced from tier 0.5 through to tier 6 and as a new player the whole system confuses me. Is it any different to normal gear drops you get from dungeons and in the world? Where do those drops fall in the tier list? I haven't found any conclusive guides on what they ARE, I've only really found videos ranking them by looks, or lists just ranking them by PvP usage.  
---
I'm sorry this is probably such a nooby question but it's something I've heard mentioned regularly for a while.
---
Is this guy named imax because that's a massive projection
---
Why doesn't this apply to talking about streamers in a negative manner thou?
---
It was released 3 weeks after launch in EU.
---
&gt;What are all these carnivors eating?
---
The players.
---
I rewatch that vid once a year.
---
Same faction is considered rude. Especially since it doesn't take long to 'empty' it. kind of like waiting at a mining node hoping you can snag the second or third 'attempt'. Other faction on a pvp server? Kill em and go to town on that sucker.
---
Blizzard is also trying to make bank, which is why they did this.  
---
So saying Blizz is wrong = Asmon is wrong.
---
If you dont like healing you can exclude all hybrid classes already. Except for warrior obviously
---
Not literally everyone, but a lot of people thought it would be cool, myself included..  I'm still kinda 50/50 on it because in TBC I thought flying was super cool.. I know the general sentiment now is that it sucked the life out of the world but I still have fond memories of unlocking my flying and saving up gold to get the epic flying and cruising around the world on my Wyvren then farming and unlocking my drake..  Lots of fond memories of flying for sure.
---
My wife plays a rogue, and I always warn her not to try and evasion on a warrior, and if you see swords spinning around him, just blind and wait.  
---
What does she do - warrior 5 levels lower than her attacks her, she hits blade flurry and dies instantly, freaks out - says he was using hacks he hit her like 5x in 1 second. and I'm like no - you hit him 5x and his retaliation turned you into a cloud of red mist.
---
I want TBC period. I could care less for vanilla elitist fucks telling me i have to nolife 50 hours a week for potions.
---
Yep, that's hardcore by just about anyone's definition
---
I don't think that's true and/or is greatly exaggerated. And the #1 stands - we are the #1 guild horde side progression. We literally downed every boss first.
---
Dang that is crazy. This is healthpotion. I was legit right there when you got it.
---
These people are why retail exist. Everything has to be timegated for casual players, even if the "old" content doesn't become irrelevant at all and they can do it as well
---
I go mind blast, SW:P while strafing/running back, mind flay x1 or 2 depending on health of mob, wand.
---
The new graphics were done with the Cataclysm world. That can't work in Classic. The Character models probably don't have all of the rig/animations/skins that are required for all of the classic abilities and mounts and such. 15 years contains lots of tiny little changes and tweaks that add up to a lot of little nit picky things when you want to retro something like that. 
---
But above all else, Classic is Classic. If you want the new stuff, Retail is still there for you.
---
Like the guy said below, on Heartseeker PVP realm, us Horde are the underdog by a decent margin. Plenty of Alliance to go around!
---
Yes! That's what I've been hoping for as well. If they want to get crazy they could even expand on Enhancement Tank. There's so many interesting playstyles in classic that are limited almost entirely by itemization
---
(There's nothing moral or immoral about it. It's about a contract.)
---
I straight up left the zone just because of how concentrated the quest areas are. Was a total waste of time fighting 10+ other people, some who wouldn't make groups just to do a few single quests.
---
I did arena/grind runs with 3 mages and a priest (me was warri tank) and i saw the boss the 2nd run and looted the chest LOL
---
Is there a website or Add On I can use to see what the general auction price of items are?
---
I wish the guild we left saw it that way. We talked extensively with the officers and just found that their more casual approach was not going to suffice for our more hardcore mentality. For our part, we are still on good terms, but myself and our officers were removed from their discord and banned.
---
Quack
---
Depends on what you use your alt for. If you just want to have fun with another class, i would try something that‚Äôs not melee. Shadow priest is very good at pvp, so if you like pvp you should pick priest, you can also heal dungeon, that makes finding group super easy. I personality dont care about pvp at all, so If i were u i would level up a hunter or mage so i can farm gold for my main rogue.
---
Did you end up selling the potions on AH for profit as well?
---
And wolves I think?
---
I bet if you went to the auction house you would find out
---

---
The last several years it's become common for most benchmark sites to list more than just average fps on titles.
---
It's not about winning or losing. It's about having discussion.
---
Finding willing off tanks is usually pretty nice so the other warriors can DPS if they prefer that, depends on the group. You may also start as an ot, do well and move to move of a mt role. That's what I did.
---
There's a player streaming his road to 10k gold and he's already 75% there. It doesn't take DM to farm gold.  
---
And how that is even relevant to your deliberate slow leveling pace is beyond my comprehension.
---
There was a study a while back showing 97% of all cancer patients had root canal surgery done at some point in life. I think it was concluded that there was no link between the root canal causing cancer, but it was speculated that the surgery provided a breeding ground for bad things that would eventually lead to cancer. 
---
However, as part of that same study, it mentioned that something like 45% of root canal patients had a reduced risk of cancer, so I'm not sure what they were going for. Also, if you have to have a root canal performed, the fear of cancer should not stop you from seriously fixing your tooth. You can die suddenly and violently from tooth issues. It's worth the "risk."
---
Also, this is all from memory so I could be remembering things incorrectly/just in general, full of shit. Do some research if you are concerned. But probably don't be concerned.
---
Well, wasn't remotong, but actually at home. But yes was standing in a tavern and moving in there while I was doing household stuff.
---
I mean the wording of that rule seems to suggest that you can't bring a raid to disrupt an event organized by the opposite faction?
---
What about people abusing the mechanics of Tirion's questline by dispelling your disguise and causing all guards to collapse on you with no repercussions?
---
I just want to know where the line is drawn.

I love my raids HotW Druid

Dude can heal, DPS, tank in one specc, just depending on fight and what we ask of them
---
Please tell me blizzards side and the Chinese side.
---
I think the main problem is in pvp. Ever been attacked by a SP geared rogue. After that you just want to quit the game. This huge pvp disbalance just sucks the fun out of the game.
---
Sweetie we're already triple split raiding these encounters
---
These are so trivial it's not even worth making any preparation for

If you're into the whole WR speedrun community, that's one thing. The rest of us don't give any fucks that your raid cleared in 68 minutes instead of 71

In terms of not liking when celebrities act like they know anything about or follow politics? Fair enough. I dont get the celeb worship it makes 0 sense. Not exactly subject matter experts lol. Hell they covered up rapes in their industry for years while participating in round after round of virtue signaling.

For tanking dungeon as warrior are people still going arms, or specing into prot? Not finding any guides on dungeon leveling.

Is Sunken Temple not considered a dungeon? It doesn‚Äôt show up in my AtlasLoot. 
---
What level should I be in order to do a run? I‚Äôm a 48 orc rogue atm.
---
DM was released 3 weeks after launch in Vanilla EU. This is some american bs. It has nothing to do with being hardcore or not. DM should have been in classic from the start and perhaps the team finally realised that. We should also get BGs in phase 2. Leave the raid content planned as it is, but the other content that we actually had in Vanilla should be available.
---
The butthurt is strong with this one.
---
So he should just go the opposite side of the map, and continue in the same direction as you. Easy peasy.
---
Sure but you still need to convince everybody to run said dungeon.

Have u tried retail?

Look up Tactics rogue leveling guide. I used it 47-55 then switched to BRD/LBRS runs.
---
No idea? TW3 is available on consoles, unlike WoW, so it's a possibility.
---
Warrior is one of those classes that gets better every 10 levels and arguably becomes the most fun and rewarding class at 60. Fury dps certainly has the most engaging rotation in the game.
---
A picture of the game boxes.
---
Good content, OP.
---
Well in AV they certainly had the terrain advantage...
---
I dont understand the Pohh thing?!
---
Shame you rolled the wrong race to take advantage of widescreen.
---
Could be neat.
---
Could also be worthless to the majority of people playing.
---
Who would win in a fight, 1 fully geared warrior or 2 farmy bois?
---
Got mine ninjaed by a hunter who already needed on multiple pieces of loot in the dungeon. Was tanking, hadn't gotten a piece of loot, and was using a green weapon... I hate pugs sometimes man

It felt like early times. That's my opinion on it. Thanks for the clarification tho. I didnt follow the community that much in wod
---
How's the ratio of Dragon's Call?
---
Where to check the ratio?
---
Gnome or  Human warlock.
---
I plan on living in AV but it will be super  slow leveling and likely a lot of soloing due to schedule.
---
Ive boiled it down to a few things.
---
Gnome:
---
-pvp racial
---
-larger mount
---
-superior int
---
-every time i started in DM id always head over to Elwyn and westfall so im kinda looking forward to leveling through wetlands this time
---
-kinda awesome being this tiny terror
---
Human:
---
- diplomacy diplomacy diplomacy
---
- will help rep grind AV, timbermaw, goblin rep
---
- voiceover isnt as bothersome 
---
- rep gainz = money saving
---
Other considerations: 
---
- Im planning out my alts and would absolutely do gnome preist and nelf or dwarf priest so this might be the only human i make 
---
- since this is my first toon back on classic i want one that can make money especially since im going to be my fiances bank when i get her to play
---
- im going to get my fiance to play and ill roll an alt with her and probably co level
---
I meant buy my epic mount, not this mount.
---
Sorry I am not more clear.
---
And trinket from hinterlands if horde!
---
&gt; and I had no reason to distrust the validity of what he said.
---
Do you now?  Now that you know it's wrong.  
---
We're on patch 1.12.  There's tons of catch up gear, and talent changes, already in the game.  The original vanilla was out the window before we even started, and it completely discredits your point.  
---
Maraudon was not in the game at launch.  Neither was most of the gear people at 60 are getting from dungeons.  The talent trees have changed.  Raid content has already been completely trivialized compared to the original vanilla experience.  This should have been obvious when we saw a week 1 MC and Ony clear by a guild wearing mostly green gear.  I don't understand how a few extra gear upgrades (which make it easier for the casuals who are complaining to catch up) make any difference whatsoever.  It's not going to be the bridge people need to clear the current raid content.  Anyone making a meaningful effort is already doing that.
---
try and sell it fast this week because soon DM is coming out and that offers a very good druid tanking weapon. So try and sell it asap. Anywhere between 200-300g is a good price that I've seen. Maybe it will sell for slightly less now if people are canny enough to know of the DM weapon Unyielding Maul. But sell it soon.
---
Beh guhd
---
Nah, I'm just pissed off with hypocritical armchair warriors thinking they are so high and mighty and they only try to do something 'right' when it fits their agendas.
---
It also pisses me off that people think only blizz does this and not the other companies whose products they continue to use.
---
Play the game without politics thrown around, and this shit wouldn't even have started in the first place.
---
&gt;"haha we NEED new content or game will die hahahahahahaha"
---
All of the vanilla private servers from 2008-2019 say "hi"
---
If you want new content, go play retail.
---
this works perfectly, thank you!
---
Auctioneer is very good for this
---
For leveling? Do arms 100%. You don‚Äôt need the mitigation full prot offers until 60. I have a build I‚Äôm using at 60. Give me a sec
---
loot council works better for retail raids imo, as in groups of 20. with 40 players loot council is pretty easily gamed
---
"Youre not tipping for me clicking the button you are tipping for the X hours it took to get the recipe"
---
So ya'll are the ones who had the names I tried to use! I had to use Magmabeard!
---
Indentured servitude and slavery were just contracts. Nothing illegal and immoral about them - a contract cant be immoral it's written on paper LMAO!!! Idk why people would be up at arms about it.
---
Same all i will do is farm gold and do casual raiding. I cant be bothered by those morons to have stupid requirements that were not standard in 2005 and then spam "#nochange# whenever something to stop a CLEARLY horribly designed grind.
---
[deleted]
---
I didnt like the resilience. I understood why they did it.
---
im lvl 45 right now, have been tanking fine as arms and using a 2h. if healer seems unable to handle i swap to 1h +shield no issues so far
---
It's pointless to add stuff not at the end, you don't see many people running dungeons different than those where the bis gear comes from
---
Does equipping the trinket cause the 30 sec cool down that regular items have before you can use there on click ability?
---
I've done the same.
---
I prepaid months in advance because I knew I'd be playing Classic for the rest of the year (might as well save a few dollars). I just went to my account and removed all payment methods to prevent any form of renewal.
---
For now, Blizzard already has my money, so I see no reason to stop playing. One more connection to their servers isn't "showing support" for Blizzard. When the prepaid time is up, I'll see what stances Blizzard has taken since this Hearthstone debacle and decide if it's worth renewing then.
---
I think we all make mistakes and that we should be able to be forgiven if our actions are indicative of learning from those mistakes.
---
It may be listed as temple of altar hakkar
---
I hope people realize this, for the boycott to work we need to boycott Activision games as well.
---
So don't grind? Do quests, run dungeons, help others, etc...
---
I agree with you dual spec would be great and would be even better if you need to complete something first to earn it
---
Not just yet, I suspect I'll use many of these down the line and I'm not wanting for gold just yet. Should I ever need some, they'll be the first to go. 1G each on this realm and they sell quick!
---
It's a golden rule of subreddits that they are at least 30% more toxic than the actual gaming community they are meant to represent.
---
weather effect set to 10?
---
forgot you had to be unemployed to play 2-3 hours a day.
---
./sigh
---
I'm still level 18, I say blizzard should wait another year before  making any updates.
---
Wot's on yer mind?
---
A crit gives more rage
---
it was bugged, only been fixxed very recently
---
Fair enough. I haven't raided since Cataclysm, so I'm not really familiar with how it all has worked in the last 8 years or whatever.
---
Can you link spec
---
I was in the same guild from BC to wrath. I also raided on 2 different servers during both expacs.
---
Maybe you've noticed: the Internet likes to freak out about shit. Companies manipulate this when it suits them, so they should be prepared for when it doesn't.
---
Oh okay haha makes more sense now. Sorry.
---
Casters have hell with rogues.
---
Druids hate warlocks because of fear. 
---
It's the only CC they can't be immune to or shift out of or dispel themselves.
---
Yeah, still can go arms bud. At end game I‚Äôm predominately arms with 15 in prot and 5 in fury for the crit chance
---
All the things?
---
theoriginal28 probably
---
Why does he have to be Mr pink?
---
I make at least 40-50g an hour just mining in Azshara during offhours. Sure, it's not new gold into the system, but its value being added to the system. I dont see the big deal.
---
Also, there isn't a massive incentive to create gold after your epic mount. There are some great BoEs, but from what I've seen they are mostly melee items, not much really good BoE loot for Mages. (e.g. cloudkeeper leggings going for over 1000g)
---
GP knows that, just awkwardly used "the mount" to refer to his racial one rather than the drop... multiple times... One of the rare occasions where someone is wrong but people correcting the wrong thing are piling on confusion. :P
---
why aren't you happy the current 60 are fighting the fight now, instead of you having to do in a week or wathever how long it take you to catch up?
---
Pray to the RNG Deity is all you can do.
---
I think the Firestone adds fire spell damage, so it would increase both initial damage and the tick, but I dont remember the formula for how much. Neither of the stones are really worth it, save for maybe specific pvp situations. 
---
As far as the shield goes, absolutely. Half the shield timer will be gone though unless you specced demonology for the quicker summons
---
I don't think blizz cares if classic dies or not. 
---
From day 1 you have to select the realm you want to log into every time. This is counter to retail, and vanilla. It's small, but it's still an inconvenience. Now you have to select the region and the realm. So the small inconvenience has grown. This leads me to believe that Blizz barely cares. 
---
The thing with only releasing a small amount of servers was either planned(allocating resources after it's clear they are needed), or them thinking the whole "you think you do, but you don't".
---
If wow classic dies, I don't think that bliz is going care much one way or the other. The only the players are going to care... which if they care, then classic isn't going to die...
---
On the social aspect, I think that a great deal of people will be happy if streamers left classic and never returned. The first ones to leave will be the fans(which have a stereotype of being toxic as well). There may be some that leave due to trend following(people who watch). Much of the grief over mages and aoe farming has been attributed to streams/youtube. 
---
Your statement is very general and doesn't feel like it takes into account what's happening in WoW "culture". If we were talking about a newly released game by a smaller publisher? Oh yea, you would be spot on... just not here.
---
I am in the speed running community, that‚Äôs my point.
---
Can‚Äôt wait for front to back timers added to warcraftlogs.
---
Seems like the vast majority of the Classic fanbase are out just out of touch with reality lol. Anything even hinting a positive changes is met with downvotes...like this thread...11% upvoted when all I'm trying to do is have a discussion about what is clearly a broken PVP system

Yes, you can get it from the curse website and manually install. Or if you want the easier route, download the twitch app and you can download and install it through that.
---
Is the gear competition for rogue that bad?
---
No worries man. Good luck on getting the brokentooth! Thats a real struggle since its ‚Äúthe‚Äù best pvp pet Against casters. 
---
For the macro, if it doesnt work u could look online since i did it by head now. Pretty sure it should work like this but there might be better ones. 
---
Some include putting your pet on passive so he doesnt undo the trap himself.
---
Personal tip:
---
KeyBind pet command: attack on mousewheel forward and pet command : follow on mousewheel backwards. Takes some getting used to but its very easy to use mid combat.
---
My dad works for Blizzard and says they're terribly sorry.
---
Sodaboy tell ‚Äòem
---
I'm in the camp that honestly believes Classic+ in the means of filling the OG map with horizontal content and all the cut content is the way to go.
---
Ravenholdt is just one of them. 
---
There are too many straight up missing zones, incomplete content, incompletable quests to be ignored.   Shaman air totem quest, Azshera quests/BG/instnaces, probably close to a half a dozen raids (Grim Batol, Hijal, Uldum, etc.). There is so much potential that I really feel it would be a terrible idea not to.
---
Yes TBC would be easier money from a business standpoint, but it would introduce so much player churn and hated aspects of the game like dailies, flying, resilience and such that it would leave the player base totally segmented and many unhappy.
---
Thanks for answering, I didn‚Äôt know about balance, thanks for infos!
---
The gold I got wasn't too bad, poor by Mage or Warlock standards, but it was alright for me. The opportunity of also getting exalted in a pretty useless, uncommonly desired faction just seemed to fuel my drive for the grind. 
---
One of my friends isn't quite level 60 yet so I'm putting off doing main content until he's ready to do so. There's a lot of other silly stuff to keep me occupied in the meantime:)
---
Yes you can get it through the twitch client like normal
---
Post your UI and we'll suggest something. For me, DPS+Threat meters are in the opposite corner to chat.
---
Removed b4 I could read QQ
---
Want to make a horde alt that can heal dungeons effectively. Already played a priest before, how do druids and shamans stack up if the are not specced for healing. Also, if they are specced for healing, what is the leveling like?
---
gave an upvote expecting a list of mats/step needed, artworks is nice and all but....
---
Well you get boosted through the dungeon without having to do shit, atleast you can pay for the ring.

Tier gear are high level sets designed for specific classes.  Tier 0 is acquired in dungeons and Tiers 1 and up are raid rewards.
---
Overplayed meme, IMO.
---
Can't be solo'd as a druid?
---
I logged on around 10 PM just to check a rich thorium spawn a few days ago (logged out near the spawn). I am on paternal leave and was going to log out again to put my son to sleep. 
---
To my surprise the vein was spawned, and I saw a warrior in loot position on it with a mage standing next to him (opposing faction). I thought fuck it ill go for it, charged in, feared them, mined one tap before getting polyed (mage took the rest of the vein). Warrior charged after me and killed me.
---
Suddenly I get whispers from a level 1, calling me a fucking idiot and whatnot. The warrior I feared off the vein said he had the vein tapped for 20 min so the mage wouldnt take his vein and I ruined it. He was gonna corpsecamp me he said. I said sure.. went afk to tend to my son, more or less an hour later while my son was sleeping I logged on again. Guess who was still camping me. Haha.
---
I had a mature chat with him afterwards (I escaped any ganks), he was actually a decent sounding guy with too much free time.
---
wasn't close to this level of population either.
---
Ya it's a casualty of modern wow players, everyone rolled horde because they play horde in retail is what it comes down too. Orc and undead PvP facials are indeed strong, but alliance racials are much more powerful for general gameplay. I ended up rolling horde because all my friends went that way and I came to classic late because I was overseas, but I really wanted to play alliance, they are just far superior in vanilla, but the masses have become uses to horde dominance.
---
It‚Äôll still be dirt cheap. Supply vs demand.
---
Played through vanilla never knowing. I learned of it in a later expansion.  When I killed one on an alt I was leveling I thought I killed a rare find and told everyone in guild chat.  Everyone said they all have six legs.  I had to kill others to confirm.  I sat there for a while with my mouth open like a mouthbreather.
---
play pvp because you like pvp, not for the rewards.  I agree that the system is stupid and unhealthy.
---
However, pve gear in classic is easily as good and often much better than pvp gear, and you can raid casually.  Do some pve and your gear will be super for pvp, only (high) Warlords will have better pvp gear than you.
---
Yes, thank you for making these points. No, I don't have a problem with Dire Maul being released, per say. As you said, it completes the pre-raid experience, rather than harming it. The only reason I was concerned at all was the potential for Blizzard to be rushing content without thought to the consequences of that.
---
Yeah me too, I really miss that in this version. Because now even when just a normal mob is behind a tree trunk it just won't target it, only when it's completely visible.
---
Did some searching a while back but can't find much about it, seems not many people are bothered by it...

I've actually never really seen a strategy in AV. It's always been this massive zerg. It'll be interesting since BGs will be cross server (right?) so the games should be more balanced and perhaps there actually will be some sort of strategy.
---
I made an alcoholic dwarf on an RP server named Boozebeard. You can guess what his bags are filled with.
---
Break rules   
---
Sees consequences   
---
pikachuface.png
---
On the otherhand. If you go to the patch 2.0.1 honor system, your basically handing purple gear to anyone who can be bothered to que into enough BGs.
---
Thats not going to work either, Unless your going to rig up some kind of rating system like arena points had in TBC for some of the better gear.
---
One Beard, Two Beard, Red Beard, Blue Beard.
---
Sounds like great reasons man, congrats on the hard work to get there in the end :)

---
I feel betrayed.
---
I‚Äôm referring to 5 mans. Pre-BiS changes a lot with ZG crafted gear. Casters become ‚Äújust get bloodvine‚Äù
---
They also have an expensive 5120x1440 144hz Freesync - CRG90
---
Tier set gear give bonus stats depending on the amount of set pieces you have equipped. The tier sets are based on which raid tier they drop in. The raid tiers go from 1 to 6 (or 5?) in both a chronological order and in power ranking. 0.5 are weaker, and drop in 5 man dungeons.
---
Tier 1 sets were the first raid sets, being introduced in Molten Core and Onyxias Lair (this is where classic is now). Every new raid introduced a new, stronger set, tier 2, 3, 4 etc.
---
Hope all that makes sense
---
For PvP maybe, but not for questing/dungeons. Sinister strike is more damage per energy compared to backstab, it‚Äôs easier to keep slice and dice up and good swords are far easier to find than good daggers.
---
This is not the twink weapon
---
Our old main tank in vanilla/BC had a rule that even though he was a dwarf, you always show your helmet while tanking. 
---
Because what idiot would tank without a helmet?
---
How dense are you?
---
I plan on living/leveling my last 15 levels there. Wheeeee!
---
I have looked at different guides and they show different amounts. I know they game had later patches that changes some if the amounts of materials required as well. 
---
Is there any official posting on what the quest is going to require?
---
25 x dark iron
---
6 x large brilliant shards
---
35 black dragonscale
---
10 x elixer of shadow 
---
3 x atcanite bar
---
Or is it the reduced amount 
---
3 x dragon scale
---
3 x elixir 
---
1 arcanite bar
---
If anyone has word of anything official send me that way please.
---
How dare you do something completely reasonable with your own discord!?
---
Woosh
---
I wish it could be the rogue version of moonglade. FP, hearth location maybe. Also, a reason to duel in that little courtyard.
---
It‚Äôs more about identity than getting group invites. I think warlocks are still desirable without a unique summon, but not nearly as flavorful or interesting.
---
I don‚Äôt want to get banned by this sub‚Äôs overlords so just look at the front page of reddit.
---
The above sentiment is normally attributed to Voltaire.
---
I personally prefer Confucious' wording.
---
&gt; Better a diamond with a flaw than a pebble without.
---
Because some guy on another job is Sodaboy
---
The point is that if you want to play through tbc and raid, kara is the easy to get geared enough for 25 mans. So releasing it only to have it change when you go to tbc makes no sense.
---
This is my main reddit account btw. It's a "throwaway" username because I'm not interested in having my personal info tied to a public forum.
---
Your entire point hinges on the fact that because it's a contract somehow that means that it can't be immoral or that you cant be outraged. That's nonsensical and I gave you the most classic example of why that isn't true at all.
---
But you can speedrun *and* still have dual spec
---
Best of both worlds
---
Think about it
---
get killed, use Ankh and pretend you were actually never killed
---
Medio loco en el coco, ^^ido ^^de ^^la ^^mente!

---
how is a level 52 item a good twink item? I'm pretty sure nobody plays in 59 bracket
---
&gt; Personal tip: KeyBind pet command: attack on mousewheel forward and pet command : follow on mousewheel backwards. Takes some getting used to but its very easy to use mid combat.
---
Nice, ive currently got attack on mousewheel forward and hunters mark on wheel back!
---
Yeah, i'll try hunting him late at night when server's quiet.. bet he's got a made respawn time though.
---
Druids are good tanks and good healers , what the hell do you want more?
---
It‚Äôs already easy to farm gold.
---
Back in the day any time I was getting close to a 9 in my lvl I would always take a break and hit bg's for fun, work on that honor, and just break up the pve content. Just made my journey so much more complete.
---
Carry 20 stack of antinpoison from first aid my man
---
Mks scrolling battle text has an addons for classic. Works great.
---
Or you can just use simple math for an average dps value including various buffs if u want.
---
I still have a excel sheet calculating stat weights depending on my current gear which i can select.
---
The math for all this is pretty simple for frostmages. Fire and ignites make it more complex but doable as well.
---
What comes out on the 15th?
---
Samsung has a 5120x1440 144hz Freesync - CRG90
---
Come join us, it‚Äôs awesome and we need some more alliance (not extremely unbalanced but there definitely are more horde on the server).
---
Not sure if you're sarcastic, but there actually is such a rule
---
Hmm, I was hoping for something less complex.
---
Even though it's done in a polite way, many people could find it intrusive. There is AH and trade chat if people want to buy/sell.
---
Writing is the same. This looks like one person talking to themselves. Also 'they' should look up the word selfless and learn its proper use.
---
If all gankers were as interesting as that it wouldn't be nearly as annoying.
---
9/10 times if I get ganked it's after I finally get done running across the freaking zone.  Which means you have to run across it again.
---
Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age!
---
I perfer the older models personally
---
Yeah, you have a point, I will do that. Do you think I should keep the 2 points in imaple, or put should i put them in Improved Charge? Like this...
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/023050213325100031
---
Impale sounds too good to skip though.
---
It won't be the reduced amount. I have nothing official and really won't search for it I'm not even a warlock :D
---
But it will be expensive and not cheap.
---
350-500g depending on server.
---
&gt; And your entire post was based around that very assumption.
---
No it wasn't, it was based on my opinion that *not* giving $15 to Blizzard isn't as helpful as *giving* $15 to support a cause directly, something we've since clarified you still did anyways, making my initial point moot.
---
&gt; I mean this genuinely, you need to re-evaluate how you see people and how you treat people.
---
I'll do that, and then, maybe you need to learn to take internet discussions, and more especially reddit-based ones with a grain of salt.
---
&gt; You can't even see why I reacted the way I did, you're still dismissing it as an overreaction.
---
I can see why. With the first half of your last comment, I thought we could now have a meaningful discussion, but the second half turned the focus back to that one little insult that clearly offended you and now this comment is still all about it. If you're that sensible about people poking fun at you, maybe I'm not the problem...?
---
&gt; No, you do not get to judge people as less-than when knowing nothing about them.
---
But when you're doing it, it's perfectly fine, right? *"What you're displaying is defeatism, indifference, and you're effectively arguing for the erosion of human rights in the world by advocating letting companies give fuck-all about the rights we enjoy in the West."* and *"I am fully aware of how entirely insignificant I am in this world, but you know what's worse? You."* is also pretty insulting and based on erroneous assumptions and expressed by someone who doesn't know anything about me. While I can concede the first part is merely an opinion based on the comment I posted, the same can be said about my SJW quip, but if you get to be so offended by my comment, why am I not offended by yours? And then, calling me "worse than insignificant"? Man, that's a pretty god damned scathing insult. I'm not going to lose sleep over it, because I don't care what people think of me, but man, when you don't lead by example, it really makes you sound like a hypocrite.
---
&gt; That's elitist bullshit on your part, borne, I'm sure, from a sense of self-importance from the volunteer work you do
---
Still more baseless assumptions and insults against someone you don't know. Isn't that what you said I don't get to do, but you get to do it...? Hypocrite.
---
&gt; Honestly...
---
Honestly.
---
Yeah, if you do it too long then it will kick you out. If you figure out how long it takes before the do a real kick please tell me, very curious about it.
---
&gt;Lots of hunters won't be able to properly pull it off or burn out after a couple of intense runs.
---
This so much! People are crying so much about inflation but I'd bet most people will try a couple times and then be over it real quick. I'm definitely speaking for myself when I say I will likely only do it until I can get my epic mount which won't even affect the economy.
---
Gonna download that when I get home. Good for them
---
If you dont sell this for any offer you get over 20pg your crazy. In about a week this staff loses all value to a DM blue drop.
---
Karma farming is no joke sir
---
I mean, comon, that's painted in the most negative light. that's what could happen, but I'm sure there's groups who are mature about how they distribute loot?
---
Feng ShUI.
---
Yes, they really did.
---
Any specific reason besides wind fury?
---
It's unto the person who agreed with the contract and signed on it. Are you telling us that he was forced to sign the contract? Rules and terms are there for a reason, and if it is not enforced, no one will take it seriously anymore. We will all be anarchists then.
---
#mindblown
---
don't listen to them.   you can easily raid everything up to aq40 with 2 hours a week on consumables farming.  If you can't spend 2 hours a week, find another hobby, but you really don't have to nolife it. 
---
source: I have been doing this for years, including naxx.  I spend 10 hours a week in the game (2 nights plus some extras)  and cleared Kel Thuzad.
---
probably 50g at maximum since it's just an alternative to dungeon bis
---
Just note that it comes with a TON of other things and I had to disable a ton of things. Theres like an autodisenchant thing, a read all your mail thing, it was a bit overwhelming at first to mouse over an item and seeing basically a wall of text.
---
You've been  forewarned.
---
This dude logged on in the morning on a weekday expecting to have the entire zone to himself and he's fuming that he doesn't.

As a beta to BC player Classic is bringing back my teenage years. Sadly with a 70-80+ hour job and a family I can squeeze at most 2 hours a day in to play. Yet I've hit 40 even after switching servers 3 times because of old friends who came back. I probably could be in my mid 50's even 60 at this point but playing on Horde as a Shaman (never played Horde) I'm getting this experience of a totally different side of vanilla that I never did. I wish they would add BGs in phase 2 as I have more fun doing PvP then raiding but that's my personal opinion.

Hell I already have 2 19 twinks and a 29 twink ready to go beside a few things that aren't phased in yet and some of the really rare blues.

I believe the crit cap is much higher than 20%...closer to 30%. I saw a spreadsheet breakdown that I think is bookmarked at my home pc.
---
Commenting so I can link it later.
---
Honestly i believe you are correct on there being no deminishing returns on the gain of crit. I might have misworded. 
---
However at what point does the dpsgain of ap outweigh crit? Since every point of crit makes every point of ap more valuable. 
---
There should be a mathematical formula for that, but i cant figure it out.

You actually can, it's called a reserve auction.

Skipping potentially the best expansion to ever grace the game, please god no. TBC was controversial as far as flying mounts goes, but everyone seemed to have loved that expansion.

This is why I play on a PVP server. Sometimes you just need to call in a favor and have someone perma camped.

I‚Äôm lvl 57, trying to grind out until 60. I‚Äôve been mainly grinding in winterspring at the furbolgs/yetis for a couple levels, but hoping to find an area with more gold/hr.
---
Anyone know the best farming spots for those last couple levels?
---
They could really go this way, I hope it's an option they will explore
---
If you decide to level a heal just remember you don't have to spec into healing tree until late game. You can heal dungeons just fine with any of healers even if they are spec into their damage tree. And unless you don't mind levelling slowly it's recommend to spec into damage while your levelling, unless of course you intend to do dungeons as healer exclusively all the way to 60

I think people focus on the simplification of the leveling experience instead of also considering what the OP brought up: there's just too much stuff everywhere, and all of it's outdated. I'm a chronic altoholic, so I welcomed heirloom gear with open arms, and the LFD, too. I \*love\* leveling in dungeons, maybe because when the LFD came out my server was quiet and leveling was boring and lonely. Too many quests required assistance and you couldn't get it because there just weren't many new characters being made. It was also just random enough that I felt safe trying new things (if I was bad I could leave and not feel guilty/I was easily replaceable). I had a blast leveling a prot paladin in dungeons in Wrath, and learning healing classes for the first time. Again, it wasn't lonely like leveling had been for me. The 'world' on my servers in BC and Wrath was quiet and mostly empty. I got angry when 7.3.5 (I think) destroyed dungeon XP and made old dungeons hard again‚Äînot because I didn't enjoy a challenge, but because it was too challenging considering how long people had been playing on EZ-mode (and god knows how I hate change for the sake of change). Leveling in dungeons was easier for me to do, less stressful, and overall it just felt Better. Quests mean nothing when you've done them 1,000 times already, anyway. Everyone knows the Game is the end game in retail, and has been since Wrath. Leveling becomes a hurdle to overcome so that you can play with other people, instead of part of the 'experience.' Leveling via dungeons not only got you there quickly, but it also got you there without breadcrumb quests that don't lead anywhere (because the content is outdated).
---
Classic is nice because there are things to do, but they don't feel eternally far away, and there's not this immediate pressure to Get To 60 To Do Things (Or You Won't Get To Experience It Before It Goes Away/Nobody Wants To Do It). Retail is very much that way. The Game is at 120, not at 65 questing in a zone that doesn't make any sense in relation to the timeline you're experiencing. There really is just 'too much stuff everywhere' in retail for the experience of leveling to be very meaningful to most people.

They pay a hefty penalty when they cancel the auction
---
Mine only cost 90g :D /s
---
Yes it is - some People argue it might be a bit more expensive when you bought everything + the time Investment for the questchain. 
---
If you spend that time farming Gold you would actually have more Gold in the end if you just bought the normal one.
---
But that is just speculation ;)
---
Wait, you can cancel auctions where people have bid on it? I didn't that...

Why would you want a separate sub?

There are certain zones designed to utilize flying as a very cool mechanic that would be a lot of fun to keep.  Give some restriction like "can only be used in Icecrown or w/e zone utilizes this mechanic"

&gt; All i k wo is i retail dungroning id just click the button, join the group, nobody ever said fuckal to each other because it never mattered, rinse repeat. All the little steps do actually make a big difference in the social aspect of the game.

Disagree completely, that's more due to cross server than lfd.
---
At level 60 you are still killing the same mobs with the same abilities.  In fact that is the entire game, the mobs are only higher level.
---
Stamina for bear over str.
---
Depends on the agi tbh. Str ups damage but druid damage is based on level with that talent and as such do hella damage. Stam and armor are super important to bears without shields. Also since no shields dodge is very important so, its not fair to say agi = cat only. Id argue agi over str but not before armor and stam

Around 8 hours. Generally between 7 and 8 has been reported. Since its classic there might be some randomness in it.

He has 3 spawnpoints too which makes it harderen but u can eagle eye em all from the middle on a mountain outcrop.

Misdirect isn't available yet.  That was what enabled hunters to pull safely.

When the sub turns into a meme circle jerk
---
Yeah I mean just imagine every other single players wants and preferences. There is just no way they can satisfy everyone. I think #NoChanges is a good policy. They have done decent so far of not changing to much. Unfortunately the community and other things have changed, but you can't do anything about that.
---
If ur being serious ur a fucking moron
---
Yasss, In my mind the classic period of WoW ended with WOTLK. I'd like to see WOTLK again in classic wow, but the systems introduced in WOTLK are exactly why people wanted classic back in the first place. I'd be surprised if it happened. I'd like it to happen. But I don't think it will.
---
Brevity is the soul of wit.
---
Is there any 3rd party equivalent to WoW Armory for classic? I've seen " [https://sixtyupgrades.com](https://sixtyupgrades.com/) " . Only lvl 30 so not trying to min/man lol, just want to see everything offline.
---
Judgements leveling guide. Either as a text document or in game with GuideMe
---
It's a fairly active bracket that has most of the abilities that make classes feel themselves.
---
I‚Äôm guarantee there are players that do if not for more than simply earning enough gold to buy a WoW token in Retail to fund their Classic playing.  That‚Äôs what Blizzard was looking at, with a hope that some retail players would also play Classic too.
---
This is an incredibly biased take that is just not true from a historical perspective.
---
This, if you wanted to make money you need to have MC enchants most players dont have. Talk to the other players that do have an all agree on a price. Or play when they are not.
---
Please kindly wait for me, you douchebag.

Says the guy who's only thinking about himself and forgets that him and his party are the only ones on the server. Someone else definately couldn't of killed it!

Then hes surprised when he gets ignored for saying:
---
&gt;"Thanks for waiting, d*chebag" and YOU Blockovic message me back calling me an idiot. 
---
What hes missing from here is it wasn't 30 secs. He got invited by two people who were properly sitting at the right spot waiting and then he expects them to run the risk of someone else killing it. Next time be in the right spot!
---
Wind serpents still runs into melee range to attack even though it's breath has 20 yards.
---
If this weeks taught us anything its that Blizzard wants nothing but money.  They aren't going to develop more content for classic, and with the current out of touch dev team would you really want them to?
---
Same thing in wrath, but with herbalism. I had stopped on my route near the Time Lost Proto Drake (Did manage to get him, by just checking and not waiting at his spawn for days on end) and I guess the same reports happened cus people were mad I was looking for the TLPD.
---
its like anything really, you need to work at it to get the best stuff.  You can easily get to rank 8-10 for good PVP gear by playing a few hours a week purely PVP.  GB weekends offer great honor points. 
---
However, for the epics, you need to put in the time and earn the epic gear.
---
Yes. Our youngest just turned 1 and is still not sleeping through the night. We put our kids down and have 2 hours of play time until we go to bed. Sometimes the little one wakes up while we are playing, sometimes he doesn‚Äôt. Therein lies the problem.
---
Pre-raid your rings both change to tarnished elven ring, and you get an easier to get/slightly better ranged weapon in satyr's bow
---
Don't need new raids every single phase, jesus.  
---
Add some new classes, new races, new zones, are all much better ideas that allow new game play without gear inflation. Make some class quests, you can even tie it in with new classes such that you need to complete a class quest with a lvl 60 Warrior or Pally to unlock Deathknights.
---
I was worried because i thought DM would make some raid gear obsolete. But I based that on nothing. Guess I was wrong?
---
For Europeans, if DM will be release next week, it'll still be later than it was back in the day. For us, DM was a dungeon just like any other, it was just there when we were at a high enough level to enter it.
---
No problem. For gear just run brd at 55, lbrs and ubrs at 58 to 60 etc. Spam dungeons and gear shall come.
---
So when it crashes, you're gonna... what exactly? You never actually completed your statement.

This is the main advantage. No need to stand around for 5-10 minutes after each drop when the LC already knows who gets what piece next

Can't tell if you're serious or not
---
Hi,
---
I think you meant barbarous blade instead of brutality blade.
---
Some things to consider, from what I understood. Every monster level above yours will reduce your crit by 1%
---
proof: [https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/bug-berserker-stance/196414/3](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/bug-berserker-stance/196414/3) 
---
Then, with lethal shots, your crit damage is 230% instead of 200%.
---
We'll consider it like so:
---
1% crit gives you 1.3% increased damage, consider this a total of 101.3 % extra crit damage
---
2% crit -&gt; 102.6% crit damage. From 101.3 to 102.6, there is a 1.28% damage increase
---
10% crit -&gt; 113% crit damage
---
23% crit -&gt; 129.9% crit damage
---
24% crit -&gt; 131.2% crit damage. From 129.9 to 131.2 there is a 1,0007% damage increase 
---
25% crit -&gt; 132.5% crit damage. From 131.2 to 132.5 there is a 0.99% damage increase 
---
So, after 24% crit, every extra crit point will give less than 1% damage increase compared to the last. 
---
It's at this point that you shouldn't worry about crit strike any more.
---
However, remember the 3% crit chance penalty against bosses? yeah..
---
So, imo, you should have 27% crit before not having to invest in it any more.
---
I don't know how 1% crit is \~32 ap at 60, but it seems fair.
---
Well, I may be wrong, but this is my explanation.
---
I like attack power since it also increases melee attack power, which will be nice when I weave one raptor strike between autoshots!
---
Reminds me of that murloc adventure game that was in this exact style.
---
If you find a lock who already has the items they can just summon it for you to complete which saves a considerable amount - I believe it was around 350g

I‚Äôll spend 0 hours a week farming shit, cause this stuff is easy and I don‚Äôt need it
---
Just keep healing gear (with intellect, spirit, healing/spell power) in inventory and you can heal instances as feral up to about level 50 or higher depending when you start farming your pre-raid gear.
---
Keep in mind your healing gear can be both cloth and leather. You should not be hit by mobs as healer too often so armor doesn't matter
---
How many years have you been waiting for this moment?  lol.  That's awesome.
---
I think it's sarcasm. Quoting rules misses the point, is basically what he's saying.
---
In the case of the hearthstone player, he's saying that it just being a rule doesn't justify the existence of the rule in the first place. So simply quoting the rules doesn't really add to the discussion.
---
Of course, the guy he responded to didn't just quote the rule - he gave a reasoning for the rule. So the sarcasm may not be warranted. But that was my read on the intention.

Great post, but the Classic WoW experience doesn't end with Phase 6's release. That's merely when Classic will have caught up with the entire content that was released in Vanilla. You'll still get to play at your own rhythm, as long as you want, or at least, as long as Blizzard doesn't introduce Classic TBC.
---
Honestly, I've been 60 for less than 2 weeks, cleared Onyxia and MC the day I dinged 60, and farmed most pre-raid BiS since then, so there's little more to do for me right now than farming MC/Ony gear once a week (or every 5 days in Ony's case), Fishing and leveling an alt. And I'm not even *that* hardcore.
---
Basically, I think Classic WoW's Phase 1 has a lot less to offer, especially without meaningful PvP, than any other Phase, so it was sort of necessary for Blizzard to "hurry" Phase 2 out to keep the entire player base interested in the game. Once the Honor system is rolling, they can take their time all they want, I don't care, but right now? Things definitely feel stale.
---
I levelled a shaman in vanilla and have levelled a priest to \~35 in classic. Also a prot main. 
---
Both are ridiculously easy compared to warrior levelling. I find priest to be boring. Cast a few spells, shield, wand wand wand wand. Slow and steady but with zero downtime. Maybe once you hit 40 shadowform makes it more fun?  The will to level my priest further left me. 
---
Shaman is fun. Big WF crits etc. Ghost wolf is a game changer. You can still heal a lot of instances as enhancement while levelling. You can tank a lot of low lvl stuff with a shield. You can herb in ghostwolf form. 
---
Don't have experience with either at late game - I dinged 60 a week after tbc was released so maybe someone else can help you out with that :)
---
Wow naxx items are insane.
---
yeah and for people without addons a 1c bid 3g buyout will be listed earlier than a 2g bid 2,5g buyout
---
Whenever I hear people say ‚ÄúPeople are stupid‚Äù. I just shake my head
---
You are right totally right, and i should have worded it more properly. I was indeed talking about a stat prio.
---
&gt; in real life when you auction something you can't say "nah that price is to low I'll cancle the auction" after the last bidder 
---
That's pretty much exactly how most auctions work in real life, its called a *Reserve*:
---
"A Reserve Price is a hidden minimum price that the seller is willing to accept for an item. In a Reserve Price auction, the seller is only obligated to sell the item once the bid amount meets or exceeds the Reserve Price. A seller can lower, but cannot raise, the Reserve Price."
---
That being said, I tend to agree that in WoW, being able to cancel auctions that have bids is poor design in general.
---
Mine sold for 50 last week. Didn't sell first listing at 65.
---
Thanks a lot!
---
Any good tips on mining routes / zones in classic?
---
Its true though. They dont want you to say political stuff on their streams and by participating you agree on that. Your cause may be justified, youre still breaking the rules. Only because you are doing something for a good cause doesnt mean you can bend rules to your liking.

&gt; Freedom for Hong Kong isn't political because it was already granted and now China is invading and trying to take it away by force. It's a violent overthrow.

That is still political, as it deals with politics and fighting in another country. Which has nothing to do with gaming, and shouldn't be called out in a gaming arena. 
---

Lolllllllll, I remember you telling us about this in gchat. Glad to get the full story
---
Well, first off, it's clearly too much since you can't sell it and second, I don't care, really. (Skipping "third" since your point 2 and 3 are almost the same)
---
Not at all the same thing but you are entitled to your opinion. 
---
A program in which you can start your own server or even discontinue using is **not** the same as being born into a country.
---
60 mage here who also had the same problem. Jumping to cancel a spell is a retail habit because yes, batching is a thing. Try to retrain yourself from jumping and instead just hit the shoot button again to cancel it. It's far more reliable than jumping
---
Any excuse to feel better about the fact that you're not doing shit. Carry on. I cancelled my wow sub and refunded WC3. It's not much, but if enough people do it, it will put pressure on Blizz and hopefully set a precedent that teaches companies that it's not profitable to kowtow to China.

---
You can't make gnome priest. Gnome lock is slightly better.
---
how could i have been so blind
---
It definitely doesn't replace raid gear any more than some existing dungeon loot may be used over raid gear. The only item I can recall using beyond MC/Ony from DM was the Mindtap talisman mp5 trinket on my priest.

There are beautiful and toxic people. But it‚Äôs one seemless community. When I say I love the Classic Community, I love the cool people, as much as I love to hate the shitheads.

About the upcoming PvP system. Realistically, how viable are the PvP sets? I simply don't have the time to go hard in PvE. Sure, I can always raise gold and purchase future PvE gear, but I'd like something I can work towards without having to dedicate myself to a group that relies on me, when I'm not going to be available. Are they simply trophies, PvP viable or even PvE viable to an extent?
---
On another note, how likely am I to even reach the ranks required for the armor set pieces if I don't even have the time to grind the PvE gear? From my understanding, it required a lot of time and effort put into PvP to keep your rank rising, or keep it from falling. This is all assuming they're going with the old 14 rank system.

Means they've cleared all the possible bosses in each of those raids already, as a guild. So they'll be looking for people to put that content in farm status rather than people to help progress towards defeating end-game content.

Something Id love to see is new low level content.
---
Most people reroll to try new classes and having new zones to explore and quest in would be really nice imo. 
---
That way each new zone/content doesnt need to be a superior version of the end game and can just add to the playable lore instead.

Priest is hardest class to level. Shadow is better in PvP and holy in PvE, otherwise shaman, since talent respec costs a lot.

Because Blizzard is a business and they wrote the rules for the Hearthstone tournament. That player signed that contract and chose to give his support to HK knowing that Blizzard may take action.
---
Blizzard says someone will be banned for political statements, player makes political statement, Blizzard bans him, *shocked Pikachu face*.
---
I play because I want to.
---
Multiple people can have the qiraji mount, not just once.
---
Which one? must have missed that :(
---
I got Coldrage Dagger from RFD the next day after I respecced to combat. This still hurts me inside.
---
Just the riding skill at level 40
---
hmm. Using Twitch is good for syncing and keeping up to date but it doesn't sync local addon data. So I understand why you probably wouldn't want to do that. You said you have a NAS so maybe you could write a bash script in WSL to rsync on a set interval or if there are file changes?
---
Did as hpriest at 53 so I‚Äôm sure u can np as a lock.
---
Everyone says it doesn't drop but I've seen it drop 3 times in about 15 kills. Last time it dropped the dps warrior and rogue in my group already had it so I as the prot warrior got it.
---
Just checked and I got taken straight to my character screen too. I have characters on 2 other realms but I haven't logged on them recently.
---
One per server ....
---
I only had the one to give and it is gone
---
&gt;This shit is stupid and you have no idea how stupid you feel right now
---
I don't have an idea how stupid I feel now? Man, sorry, but you are not really coherent.
---
Lol u seem upset bud

[DJ Cummerbund - Earth, Wind &amp; Ozzys](https://youtu.be/FuOuUixdSvY)
---
Because I enjoy my time when I play the game. I don't play WoW because of Blizzard's political stance. I play it because they made a good game.
---
Classic props up retail WoW's subscription numbers so they can show off to the shareholders, but other than that, yes I agree that Blizzard don't really care for classic all that much.
---
I do think that some people at Blizzard care about classic and decided that this early DM release would help the game, but it clearly doesn't help 90% of the playerbase who aren't ready for it yet, so it seems to make sense that it was meant for the streamer type people.
---
Anyone who ever worked with blizzard knows that politics is an absolute no go. I dont say what he did was wrong. Not at all. But lets not act like he didnt knew Blizzard would never approve it.
---
People are making a stand!
---
But they buy iPhone and they wont go out on the streets protesting...
---
That's awesome lol.
---
I would just ignore you
---
Reminds me of the time some guy ragewhispered me over and over while I was farming thorium in Winterspring.  This was during MoP or WoD and I can't recall exactly why I needed a ton of thorium, but I'd fly around, tap a node, take all the ore and any gems and leave the stone, and move on.  Apparently the guy didn't like finding thorium nodes that had only dense stone in them.  Was kind of amusing because it's like, dude, if you don't want to keep getting my tailings, then change up your route.
---
Priest is easier to level by far. Both good in PvP. Shaman is less squishy and can solo PvP better.
---
Does boot enchant stack with improved AotC? 
---
Genuine question. Considering just buying boot enchants and then having 2 talent points free.
---
Lord of Terror
---
Fuck the guild
---
I raid because I want gear
---
Nothing in classic requires optimizing raid loot except maybe 4h and only for first couple weeks in a worst case scenario
---
Most of the people who cancelled their sub will be back in a week... if that long.
---
Change your name to redbeard asshat
---
I got permabanned from one for accidentally posting a question in the wrong channel. Imagine being an internet mod lol
---
Nah. Casuals start dropping out pretty quick.
---
But you've made your point with the last statement: I'm not welcome in *your* game.
---
some people just weren't aware. Ever thought about that?
---
No place is safe from politics...
---
Holy context batman. I don't even remember what this thread was and you deleted the text so.. /shrug?
---
Because it's fun playing with 39 friends..?
---
What a nice guy
---
there are no training dummies in classic :)
---
I've done this. I don't give a fuck about the market value of some random blue I got while leveling, I just want it to sell and not be back in my inbox tomorrow with a wasted deposit. If people truly get so upset about this why not just buy it put themselves and list for the "correct" price?
---
I always prioritize greens ahead of yellow.  Because once they turn grey, you get no exp for 'em.
---
But IIRC, RogueCraft episode 3 is about that.
---
l2read
---
There is a little button above your bottom left action bar.
---
There is no training dummies in classic. It was added for wotlk IIRC.
---
They have the sweat shops, but they don't have access to the internet we use. There are rare earths elsewhere. Most aren't even in China. We can just make new parts somewhere else.
---
 Hi! I have seen people writing about doing instances together with a level 60, sometimes it is just 1 person and a 60, sometimes it is a full group of low levels and a 60. For some reason I can't seem to find how XP is calculated for this. What kind of XP do you get based on level difference to the highest level in the group, and how is it split among X members? I would imagine boosting someone in SFK (with a \~40 level differential) is different than boosting in SM Cath or ZF. But is that true?
---
Imagine setting a minimum price for something that is less than you're willing to accept
---
A list actors

it's one of the human male ones. It's basically retelling lord of the rings in the world of warcraft (gnomes instead of hobbits, gollum is a murloc, they have to go to the burning steppes, it's not a ring but a bracelet) and is told as a pitch for a movie (or trilogy)
---
I think they have to be coming up from the lava below the boss somehow. They definitely don't come from the hallway you came in from. I've seen it happen several times and it's wiped us once.
---
Holy shit. Get off the cross, we need the wood.
---
Mostly not xd I used it a couple times in dungeons but on those cases you usually get multiple bleeding effects and it only removes 1, so you just save a bit of health and once you have more trinkets, any other tanking one is gonna be better.
---
I guess for rogues can be useful if they gonna 1v1 against a warrior or a druid to remove bleeding before vanishing
---
&gt; This does not mean you need to wait for healer/caster mana to be full before you pull, at around 80-90% maybe even 50% if you are well geared or its a small pack.
---
If I'm healing, and the tank pulls while I'm still drinking, my stress level will rise a bit. It will rise higher depending on how low my mana is. If my tank pulled while I was still at 50%, my blood pressure would measurably increase :-o   I wouldn't want to do that to my healer when I'm tanking.
---
Mara Princess runs are worth it for the helm and necklace if you're lacking on those slots. The croc next to Princess has good shoulders too. Everything else is meh.
---
&gt;Lets not pretend the player didn't know that acting this way would cause embarassment to bliz / paint them badly.
---
Err, they were only painted badly because they banned him, not because of what he said.
---
Again, the point is that they choose when to enforce it (when they can enforce those rules on most players) and how big the punishment is.
---
&gt;but they dont want exactly this type of situation to happen where someone says 8 words on stage and then they are left with the fucking clean up
---
What cleanup were they left with? They have to do cleanup because of their reaction, nobody was saying 'fuck blizz for allowing a winner to promote something they care about in 8 words in their winner speech' before they gave out the punishments to him and the casters.
---
And it's not like anyone's surprised. They were always OP as bollocks in 1v1 when geared. We've known this for over a decade.
---
Being good with other classes just tends to be more impressive, because they have more to do and most have more daunting rocks to their scissors.
---
Give the warrior to 40 or 45 before you give up. early warrior leveling is brutal because you don‚Äôt get any of your core abilities until later on. But by 40 you have a solid kit. 
---
i think execute at 24ish? helps
---
sweeping strikes at 30 is huge. (charge, sweeping strikes, cleave)
---
pummel at 32ish? is big. 
---
whirlwind at 36 and mortal strike at 40 are the key abilities though. 
---
then at 45 you have 5% more crit from the fury tree, plus the 5% from axe spec in arms, you will find the class totally better. 
---
The other piece is: need a good weapon. corpsemaker out of RFD is good. Bonebiter axe from the SM quest at 35ish is good. 
---
If you still don‚Äôt like it at level 40 with bonebiter and MS, then i give you permission to quit. 
---
But there is a night-and-day difference between level 25 and 40 or 45.
---
&gt;the whole reason they didn't release it in phase 1 (according to blizzard)

I think you will have a hard time with #3.  Better to find keybinds that work universally than to have to get muscle memory with different setups for the same skills.  
---
In general, I find 36 keybinds to be more than enough (so 3 bars).  I use unmodified, then shift modified, then ctrl modified.  And I bind my mouse side button to ctrl for easy access there.  
---
With my keybinds I like to find keyboard patterns for grouping things.  Like my warrior stance switches are z,x,c because those keys are right next to each other like 1,2,3 are.
---
It really does though. Unless you're using wind serpent?
---
Because you must have missed the Huge news that just happened and the wave of people leaving. I know what is making people leaving, I can't bring myself to think up what would make them stay. I need you fine folks for that
---
Yeah. Time and place and blizzard games are obviously not the place. Blizzard made that clear. Thank God.
---
It's also fun getting better items and getting stronger.
---
the original is a black man walking into a bar isn't it?
---
No I have not, are they fun to do?
---
To get it in Wrath I levelled a rogue and spent hours pickpocket Tyr's Hand.
---
Wasn't as bad as I thought. Shen'drelar and Dark Moon Fayre were worse.
---
The only reason flying wasn't available in the old world was because it was incomplete. It was indeed requested by players.
---
Because I enjoy WoW, and occasionally Hearthstone. The actions of blizzard and Activision for the most part seem to be to protect investor interests. To which I have no moral issue with.
---
That can be fixed. They can find Hong Kong in their hearts.

For me, it's like: your friend promised to play horde with you so you rolled horde (wanting ally). You're level 44 and he's still 10.
---
Eh you can't think about competing with toxic folks as winning or losing. You win by not having to deal with them even if it doesn't always feel that way at first. I have fought toxic assholes and i've walked away and I have never regretted the second decision except that I should have done it earlier.
---
I like to have 80 drinks on hand for dungeons 
---
There is no set amount of times to drink per dungeon. It's different for every group. Sometimes you have to drink every second you drop combat. Sometimes you can go the entire dungeon and only drink once or twice. 
---
Should be second nature. And always stay OVERLY stocked on drinks
---
And that's why the majority of players won't run them.
---
Assuming you're going to level ret, weapon speed and damage range matters. The slower the better. Sadly swords seem to be on the faster side, but their are some slow ones out there.
---
Well I'm happy to see you learned a valuable lesson. Next time you won't make the same mistake I bet. 
---
&gt;Ah I can tell you're one of those people :)
---
Logical? Absolutely!
---
Bushy tails, large fangs, wicked claws.
---
They're made in sweat shops, the plans to make them are all from the west. We can arrange to have them made elsewhere better.
---
Hunter were nuts in TBC with their crazy dps right from the ding on 70 and all the CC options, I loved playing with my hunter alt probably even more than my main. Moments like that were so awesome, it's also the reason why I quit after Cata because they took away so much of the toolkit that could make you excel among your own class.
---
My main alt is currently a hunter but sadly with the broken traps I'm enjoying it way less than I should. Putting down a precombat frost trap &amp; then going in for an explosive trap is almost impossible, I just can't seem to drop combat even with macros. Also with everything being zerged down and melee already crushing Hunters this early on dps there's not much left to enjoy unless you really love the class.
---
I struggled so hard In 2005 first time ever playing. Was playing a dwarf warrior and I thought you needed to equip your gear into the action bar. So I had my whole action bar as my gear with auto attack and heroic strike.... those bears at 7 were brutal... I died a lot.
---
I have a screenshot from feathermoon like this on my home pc. Not quite as extreme, but I havent used the console command to crank up density. If you want I'll go find it later!
---
I play a druid and maybe I can give you the initial reasoning of why I picked the class and add some of the things that weren't part of my initial reasoning but turned out to become things I really like about the class.
---
I chose druid with the intention of having a PvP-healer that is very hard to kill. I think that abilities like Bear Form, Travel Form and Prowl as well as Talents like Nature's Grasp and Nature's Swiftness are really great for that purpose.
---
Other things I really like about druid:
---
I can fulfill any role, including tank, in a 5-man-dungeons which means I have comparatively low waiting-times to get dungeon-groups going.
---
Thorns turned out to be a tremendously helpfull skill to help tanks keep initial-aggro on large packs of weaker mobs. This not only works for myself but also other tanks.
---
Innervate is extremely potent to deal with acute mana-problems. It fills almost 2/3rd of a bar of myself or even more on a Priest. I'm positive that using it has prevented several oterwise certain deaths and even wipes. Also this ability is so great because it scales with the gear of the receiver.
---
Overall I feel that I really got what I expected and don't regret my choice.
---
Silithus does have nodes. The challenge of Silithus is there are parts of the zone that have elites and they will fuck you up.
---
AFAIK it is only worth it in a prolonged fights, whereas the mob will last over 20 seconds (not sure about the exact time) to make it efficient
---
Except most people who worked on vanilla are gone. There are still a few influential people left, though.
---
and the one you bought where can you get it by yourself instead of on the AH?
---
None except their lack of posting stats. They did boast like crazy when they had amazing numbers after all.
---
LOL!

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dfhvh4/post_dm_release_bis/).

&gt; altering gameplay would be enough to persuade people to farm new gear/sets imo.
---
Only if the altered gameplay is better than the current one. Else people won't bother. So, there is still power creep on top of already insane levels.
---
I've only seen it 2 times, and I lived inside BRD for some days, it just depends on RNG, wowhead says 4% drop, that's 1 in 25

Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of our age!
---
Blizzard and Activition are China's whores!
---
In this instance, not making a political statement means letting people die and suffer. Blizzard is telling everyone in their games to let people suffer and die.
---
Your comment history is weird
---
Its all a game
---
But he moused over the corpse as if he was going to try to right click it and check what loot it dropped himself, while out of range of it and dead.
---
Yes, he can find out what dropped, but the player who is dead and 50 feet away isn't able to right click the corpse and check for himself.
---
When was your funeral
---
But the bird itself isn't. Sadly
---
Not in the case of double agent tho, all he gets is a tiny bit of experience. [Here](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/us/mannoroth/doubleagent) is his armory for anyone unfamiliar, note that he's neither horde or alliance.
---
Considering I've been on a 3+ hour BFD run previously, I don't trust that any group I start with will be efficient and quick.  If it's guildies I know or we well outlevel the place, then sure.  But unless it's SM, I don't slot an hour for a dungeon then have a hard stop.  That's just rude for the group when you drop as it's struggling and claim "sorry guys, gtg."
---
Playing Horde on most pvp servers has turned into easy mode.
---
Have you considered fucking it?
---
You don‚Äôt like my meme? Haha
---
Eh, I don‚Äôt think that telling people to kill themselves should be tolerated tbh.
---
No, nothing like armory. Sixty upgrades just lets you plan for your next piece of gear
---
&gt; that doesn't even dedicate their 1 hour of free time to their game
---
Funny you quoted that when the very beginning of the same sentence is  
---
&gt; That's about 3 hours a day since release  
---
And even when the work day was log, even after spending the evening playing something else with my friends, I pretty much always play an hour or so of Classic to cool down and chill before going to bed.
---
No, your political stance is that you don't matter
---
A weak cope because I'm not cancelling? 
---
Hey, buddy, I don't give a fuck about this political bullshit. I'm not coping with anything.
---
You people are fucking insane, stop telling people what they should do and go fuck yourself.
---
Blizzard should have obeyed their own rules, then?
---
10/10 have my fake gold sir üèÖ
---
What a charming individual.
---
I‚Äôd suggest finding another game. I saw people pushing for a Final Fantasy MMO on other subs. I personally would suggest trying out SWTOR. The FF one has a free trial and SWTOR‚Äôs base game is free and once you subscribe once, you still get all the new DLC even after your subscription ends
---
Because it pisses you off.
---
Sodaboy up in this hoooo
---
Watch me crank it warch me rolllll
---
It's a spell so no inventory slot required. 
---
If you can find another warlock that will do it for cheap or free and farm the other mats it's way cheaper than the real mount. 
---
You also get the training for free when you finish the quest.
---
Around 205g for the gathered materials AH average which will go up.
---
150g for xorothian stardust
---
Then another 250g for the 3 reusable items. 
---
605g total so still cheaper then the  1kg everyone else pays.
---
Yes they didn't.
---
You don't have to group up for 70% of questing, mats farming, rep farming, gold farming, profesion lvling.
---
update, made a character on a West server. 41ms when its not primetime. 61ms on the east server I'm currently on.
---
*Laughs in Paladin Master Race*
---
prolly not because the wifi box was more than likely made in china
---
That's not true. It depends on the auction type. If there is a reserve (a minimum amount)  you can cancel, if there isn't you can.
---
It‚Äôs not even political to say that China has forced Blizzards hand...
---
Their actions are creating real suffering. People are being shot, and Blizzard wants to silence anyone that helps them stop the pain.
---
I tried that but I'm looking for something that isn't somewhat that shows up on the IU
---
If you think it is too low of a price buy it yourself and repost for a profit.
---
Get me off
---
Dude, I think you are, in fact, the very best... like no one ever was.
---
Defias fuckery is afoot in Azeroth!
---
I guess I just enjoy the PP/kill method a lot more and I've had pretty good luck I guess. Even if BRD is theoretically better it's so boring and respeccing to a PVP spec when you aren't even using it for PVP.... Yeah that's a no from me.
---
To each his own though obviously. Like I said from the beginning "IMO"
---
I'm not a native speaker either (though I do have a degree in English philology, for what it's worth). It just sounds like a really stupid neologism to me, and is really annoying for some reason, that's all ;p
---
You probably need to manage the 5 second rule better. I would recommend installing an addon such as [this one](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/addons/five-second-rule/) that will show you when you are regenerating mana and when you are not due to the 5SR. 
---
You want to minimize the amount of time you are in the 5SR so that you spend more time regenerating mana. Let the tank get to 30-40% HP (you can let them get even lower once you get more confident in your healing) and then quickly cast 2 or 3 heals in a row. In general, spend mana in bursts. Need to put down a new totem? Wait until you need to cast a heal and then do both right after one another. 
---
Also you don't need to freeze the entire group just to drink. If I know I'm going to need to drink after the current pull I'll run ahead a little bit during the fight and then as soon as combat ends I start drinking. That way the time the rest of the group spends looting and walking up to the next group is time you're spending drinking. You can even keep drinking as the tank starts the next pull; you shouldn't need to start healing until 5-10 seconds into the pull anyway. By doing this I can often drink a full water without causing the group so slow down at all. 
---
That being said healing WC at 19 as a shaman I'm not that surprised at how much you had to drink. You could probably improve your efficiency somewhat but shaman are very mana intensive healers early on and 19 is on the lower end of the WC level range. If the tank was &lt;20 too then I would expect you to be going oom fairly often in WC.
---
Step one, communicate this to officers in your guild. Figure out what the actual expectations are of you. If you're not in a hardcore progression guild, it's very possible that they won't mind you playing a hybrid spec. Their expectations of what you need to do to earn a raid slot should inform your next steps to take.
---
Is it any good?
---
I'm using a wolf, have you specced into resists on your pet? Do you make sure your pet is getting buffs?
---
This is why gnomes gruin geverything...
---
Dot multiple at a time. Try to overwhelm yourself. Makes it fun
---
U mean RFK?
---
Sfk will be gray mobs
---
Just the typical fucking loser looking for kicks, nothing New.
---
Like Goku turning SSJ3, but fortunately not as long :x
---
Yeah, the warlock set had agility on it partly because the original design was to actually have them melee with daggers and firestones. The paladin set is soup.
---
Please feed your kodo...it‚Äôs all bones.
---
Why?  It's just pickpocking.  Save your heavy lockboxes and turn in every now and then.
---
When you are too high, the quests are grey and give less exp and rep. That is what I said...
---
Proper night time would be nice to for world immersion.
---
Imagine calling blizzard a politcally neutal company with a straight face. are you for real? In the west they keep shoving political correctness down our throats at very oportunity
---
We need you guys so our twinks have someone to pwn once battle grounds come out.
---
Mage tier 1 from MC had between 20 and 50 spell damage depending on the type (lol @ a mere 20 frost damage) .... to give some perspective, my mage on Classic had roughly +200 fire damage by level 56 with nothing but quest rewards and AH purchases.
---
No way am I reading all that shit.
---
I am also married, but my husband doesn't play and isn't into video games. I really try not to play too much during the week, its like an hour or 2 every other day. I play when he's doing other stuff, or if i have down time. 
---
It bothers him if he's trying to hang out with me after work and I just have my face in my computer. So yeah... I feel your pain :p
---
You'll use more water as you get to longer dungeons. In a full BRD clear I'll use in excess of 100. 
---
It's important to seek out a mage when planning to run a dungeon to get water in case your group does not have one. I usually look for a mage guildy in a city, who is probably just sitting around or doing ah/bank stuff. The high level vendor water will run you 1.6g per stack. So you could spend nearly 10g in water in a run otherwise.
---
JoJo's is fantastic
---
That's true. They didn't change that until BC or something, wasn't it? Or maybe late vanilla, around the time of the AQ Gates opening?
---
Yeah. There's a gnome on my server that has it.
---
I'm not sure.  But you will certain have more fun and thus be more willing to run BRD 5 or 6 times then spend 5 to 6 hours mindlessly mob grinding.
---
Dustwallow Marsh is the area Theramore's in.
---
I agree.
---
run around with a 2 hander but they're wrong &gt; the most important part is going to be threat ???
---
If you're on Incendius, I will buy it from you gladly.
---
Pretty sure they're only going for like... 40g. But don't check the AH to make sure, trust me. It's only a 40g item.
---
Don‚Äôt really trust blizzard to make classic like content tbh
---
Hehe, sorry for the snark. It's an honest mistake!
---
Then you buy them all and make bank
---
Not just BiS lists, but also Retail, where utility is completely ignored in favour of whatever has the largest amount of Intellect/Agility/Strength. People don't consider any of the alternatives an item may have, just whatever is muh biggest number.
---
Imo the classic+ kind of concept doesnt work in wow quite that well. The reason it works in runescape is that runescape is mostly a single player game. 
---
Most of wow endgame is social and if we expand even further from the basic line, I think it would work for the most enthusiastic guilds. For us casual players it only gets harder to find dungeon groups for specific runs.
---
But if they would go that route, I sure as hell would play it! Even though Im a casual scrub
---
I tamed Broken Tooth and named him "Garbage" because I was pressured to do it. Never name your pet. Or at the very least don't call them Garbage.
---
The key difference there is with a Reserve it's set beforehand and can't be raised like you said.  
---
I think the problem here is more the way the system calculates the auction house cut.  If people would lose money even with a 1c starting bid they wouldn't do it.
---
Don't do something you hate! There's still PVP which shamans are quite fun in.
---
If yours is a tryharding guild i'm afraid the only way to get accepted into a raid as enha is being the designated nightfall machine , unfortunately shaman dps in raids is just bad  so you have to find ways to make yourself more worth
---
Cooldown, as in your ability has time until it can be used again.
---
Dwarves get guns as their racial.
---
So brave
---
when you get routine with "pulls" and "mana efficiency" the tank and healer have a bit of unspoken communication. 
---
the tank can take some time to get hit before needing an initial heal and the healer can get a few ticks of a drink before standing. This moves much faster and smoother. After a while it becomes second nature 
---
and sorry about your stress and blood pressure. healing can be a bit like playing goalie and is not for everyone
---
I would like to play a melee char with 2 handed spec. I prefer DPS, and mostly solo PvE. I play horde so I'm assuming my choices are warrior or shaman? (Does feral Druid use two handers?) For solo leveling which is better?
---
Tbh you seem like you have a blood pressure problem not a healing/tanking problem then.
---
You should almost never need more than 80% mana for a pull, by the time the tank needs a heal you should be at 100% from the drinking. You don't need to be perfect, stop putting so much stress on yourself, but if you want to be efficient and "more" considerate of the group's time, then your gonna have a bit more stress in your healing/tanking life. I haven't met a single healer in my runs ( I have 2 60s) that had wanted the tank to wait for them to get full mana, most get annoyed the tank waited so long.
---
and here we all are playing their game supporting those things
---
you can complain all you want but if you still keep buying and playing their games why would they ever care
---
Holy shit some people really need to find something better to whine about, this is getting ridiculous.
---
One of my all time favorites. The first season will feel like a slog but it is very much worth it.
---
It absolutely helps in PvP.
---
Remember, anyone who plays less than you is a noob.

I play a fury warr.  My BiS mostly comes from 5mans or is crafted for the first couple phases, other than weapons, so that makes it somewhat easier.  That and I seemed to have a cursed /roll, as I seldom roll higher than 50 and when I do, I'm typically outrolled even if I roll 90+.
---
Low alch or riot
---
That sounds good, thanks!
---
It's entirely dependent on the group. If I'm with guildies often times 50% is fine unless I know it's going to be a rough pull. But an average pull that is enough mana because I won't need to spam heal them. That's the issue, here. I can cast a few efficient Heal/Greater Heals on them and then take a break for Spirit regen while they down the rest of the pack, maybe needing one more heal or two at the end of it. But if you have a group who takes a lot of damage, yea 50% might not be enough.
---
Who
---
Did pservers have actual dark nights when the server clock changed into night mode?
---
As enhance your totems are better so honestly the dps loss from being enhance vs buffing your party should be minimal.
---
Luffa was great for PvP, not sure if useful in any PvE encounters in classic but it definitely made the Moroes fight in BC way easier on those who still had it.
---
The thing that confuses me about "no drops for casters" is literally over half the loot I see dropped is for casters lol. Although I guess it's more healing gear than warlock/mage gear. But mages &amp; warlocks still strong. 
---
Release dire maul it's fine just feels like people pushing this narrative of casters somehow being weak because they don't have this gear baffles me. I played in vanilla and never used Dire maul gear as a caster. But like you said it was released late and I already hate epics back then. But even still just using blues from dungeons I still did beyond plenty of damage.
---
There is this wrong idea that not min maxing is wrong. Druids is a sub class ok. But the difference is pretty small with the other "bedt classes" also the druid buff is nuts compare to like stamina from priest or even bene from paladins. And the HotW spec actually makes you a better tank for 5man than a deep tank spec, instant emergy heal as a tank? Yes please. It also make you a better heal since you sacrifice like 10% more healing and get 20% intel, thats a lot of crit and mana right there. You are also super tanking in case you get aggro which happens quite often in 5 man.
---
Wouldn'**t**
---
Nice try
---
10 minute cooldown on the bag and doesn't produce Morrowgrain every time. Only 50 rep per turn in makes this an incredibly poor way to grind the rep.
---
I have my eat/drink macro bound to shift-D. I sit to drink every single time the group exits combat, I would say this is partly due to playing a mage and not having to pay for food/water. I highly suggest if you find yourself drinking a lot, bind it, do not click to drink. 
---
ALSO - fellow mages; always try to get to dungeons early (we have teleports I mean c‚Äômon) and take the time to make plenty of water and food. Hook your fellow mana users up with 4 to 5 stacks of level 45 water.. and don‚Äôt forget to give your lock and warrior pal some food as well. EndMageHate

Top comments are just dwarf quotes. This post sucks.
---
You can't swap trinkets mid combat, only weapons can be swaped. So when you're fighting something or someone and want to switch to a different trinket, the new trinket is put on a "queue" until you finish combat. And yes, after that there's the 30s cd for switching trinkets. So you basically need to switch your trinkets prior to engaging in combat!
---
Well it is a jungle.
---
SoR is probably a bit better than SoC for that weapon. But assuming you want to level as Ret, don't bother with imp SoR and pick up Command anyway. It'll be great once you get a slower weapon later on.
---
I find a lot of people don't use lower rank spells for healing, and it makes a huge difference in mana consumption. As a 19 Paladin I healed our group for Deadmines with just Rank 1 and 2 of heals, never touched Rank 3, and I didn't have to drink but an handful of times the entire run. Of course that meant I didn't spend any mana on dps, but I still auto attacked when there was free time.
---
Didn't have stormstrike at the time, I respecced to ele right when I could have unlocked it. Ah well mystery for the ages.
---
Oh shit, never doing that again then lol. Thanks for the heads up.
---
Ofcourse people who dont actually play the game are gonna boycot it
---
I got it from a Lockbox on Grobbulus
---
Thank fuck.  Two clicks doesnt seem like much, but it was really starting to get annoying.
---
Saying that Blizzard legally did nothing wrong and that this outcome was expected doesnt address the morality of the issue. Just because they could do it doesnt mean it was the right thing to do. This reeks of lawful neutral "rules are rules" shit that people say when they have the privilege of not caring about what is happening. He was not banned for making a political statement. He was banned because he made a particular political statement. If he said "climate change bad" or "we need to do something about poverty", there would have either no punishment or very little and you know it.
---
As a mage I will drink almost every pull (often for just a couple secs).  But if you're tanking in my group, please feel free to pull even when I am still drinking as long as I have 50% mana as I will just keep drinking while you get aggro.  I only want 100% mana on trash pulls that need a lot of AoE or tricky pulls where shit can hit the fan.
---
Team lead from the original team that developed WoW at blizz.
---
can confirm, I got accused of stalking someone just by being on the same quest, I was like you got issues my man
---
Lol. 
---
That's how I was on my first shaman i got to 60. I actually started as elemental/enhance hybrid with most of my talents in elemental until my friend persuaded me to go enhance because as enhance he was about to beat me really easy. I was in awe and did the switch and I love pvp as enhance. But I never raided, just got all my gear from pvp awards. 
---
Now from pservers to classic, I got smart and from very low levels, I have been healing as enhance all the way to now. Whenever I do dungeons, I switch to my healing gear (gear with +healing, intellect, and spirit.). All of which I obtained from dungeons. Good thing about shamans is it's easy to get gear, doesnt matter if its cloth, leather, or mail, as long as it has healing or intellect, its mine. 
---
Now my other set of gear is pure enhance. I got all the gear from SM. Herods helm, shoulder, pants, etc. My talents is in pure enhance with stormstrike.
---
I have an add on I use to switch between my gear sets in 1 click. My healing is extremely effective regardless of talents, because gear&gt;talents when it comes to healing. I healed dungeons way over my level and my group did fine. As long as you know how to downgrade spells and how to build your gear sets, you should be alright.
---
Pretty crazy even a former Blizzard employee is boycotting the game.  The guy who designed Vanilla even.
---
Uh, just to chime in a contrary answer - no. A loot council would be balancing the gear of the MT and the OTs because MC has a lot of fights that require both. You want your MT to be the beefiest but if you don't gear up the OTs, you'll have a super rough time on all the bosses with multiple adds and tank switching.
---
Loot council, when done properly, usually just looks at the gear of everyone who could use it and decides what benefits the raid the most. So maybe two healers want a +healing ring. One has garbage and the other has pre-raid BIS. They should give it to the one with garbage because that will benefit the raid as a whole more than slightly upgrading someone who got the pre-raid bis gear. Some might see this as unfair because that means someone who didn't "work as hard" (put it quotes because it might just be luck) to gear up pre-raid would be getting the better gear faster but that's what loot council is for - putting the needs of the group ahead of the desires of individuals.
---
There are usually some things that don't follow that trend. Like for the Majordomo benediction quest item, I doubt they'd send that to the priest with the worst staff. That's probably going to the main priest healer first and then the priest class leader probably reports a list of priority on who gets it after that. Same with hunter leaf if there are multiple hunters. Bindings are always going to the MT. Stuff like that.
---
Do we know if Hallows End will be this year?
---
[Yes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-XuTdj2Z6A)
---
importance is pretty relative.
---
some races have bonuses to different weapon types.
---
humans have sword and mace bonus and orcs have axes.
---
dwarfes only have a bonus to guns, and since pallys cant have ranged weapons it doesnt matter at all.
---
now are those bonuses important in general? during leveling not really since you are switching (as you correctly assumed) between weapons with the best stats.
---
at max level it gets interesting because those additional bonuses to weapon types have an influence what weapon drops are better than others.
---
for example the edgemasters gloves are better on a dwarf warrior than on a human. also the weapon priority changes etc.
---
For people who don't know who Mark Kern is - he is the team lead for Classic development. He's one of the people most responsible for making classic available to play right now.
---
Why? If they don't want to, don't do it. Another dungeon gives a new method of gearing alts and new itemisation for new specs/talent builds
---
It‚Äôs just a question of if they will go the easy route, the hard route, or the hardest one
---
Mark Kern helped develop wow, come on. Google man
---
I think they're fun.  Absolutely.  I would recommend Skinning/Leatherworking as it will allow you to make 2 of your pre-raid BiS items.  Pick up fishing and cooking as well.  
---
A couple times a week, i break for an hour, 2 at most, and work on professions.
---
some retard who rides the waves of decades old achievements like anyone ever cared about him in the first place. similar to brevik in that way.
---
I just don't like the narrative that casters are weak without Dire Maul lol. I mean hell mages arleady blowing stuff up AoE style with their "shit" gear... Which is why I don't really see the need for it. But it makes sense to release it sooner than later I suppose so it's whatever. At least warlocks (and pallys??) can get their mounts now.
---
God, you're such a pussy
---
He created it...
---
He... he was playing it, he even helped design Vanilla.
---
Bro, he helped develop the fuckin game.
---
I've done that Alot, the belt buckles made alot of money for me.
---
I think there a plenty of people with 2, yeah
---
So is the rogue the best to go in classic?
---
why tho?
---
What a douche for attempting to project his ideals on a group they already agreed on a loot system.
---
You never played outside of Vanilla? So you have the experience of 2 years and 3 months maximum (the time between release and TBC) of experience in this game? So basically, you don‚Äôt know your ass from your elbow.
---
Furthermore, if you think the entirety of WoW revolves around ‚Äòend game content‚Äô you missed 85% of the game. You SHOULD go back and start over because you missed the game in your flurry. 
---
Lastly, if you think the only ‚Äòend game content‚Äô is MC and Ony, you‚Äôre also missing another 8%. So I guess it makes sense that you‚Äôre feeling disappointed and underwhelmed.
---
My primary point is this: you‚Äôre missing a large part of the game if you‚Äôre just concerned with getting end-game gear for your one character. You either don‚Äôt know what a raid is like from the perspective of a tank, or a healer (because based on the way you sound, you‚Äôre probably a LEET DPS LFG). They‚Äôre all different experiences. And you missed the experience of playing different classes as you leveled.
---
*whoosh*
---
&gt;Their response has nothing to do with the actual goings on in HK as far as I can tell.
---
They could've just baned him quietely, and for less time. Same for the casters. 
---
The fact that they publically executed him so harshly looks very much like their chinese investors wanted appeasement.
---
I think Priest may be slightly ahead of the curve, but I would maybe still say Shaman - my favorite class. Very flexible in terms of utility and healing, although your main tool of choice will be Chain Heal. 
---
That said, you have some nice perks - poison or disease cleansing totems cleanse the entire group at once (and pulse every 5 (?) Sec), offensive magic dispel, a multitude of totems, the ability to restore 5x (your group's) ~1300 Mana with Mana tide totem, you can ranged interrupt or kite every 6 sec with shocks and you get Ghost wolf at 20. While leveling you can choose between Enhancement for some neat Windfury crits, or elemental (best from lvl 40ish) and toss out Lightning bolts like it's nobody's business. Both specs can heal until early/mid 50s as long as you have a somewhat up to date int/SPI gear for it.
---
If your unsubbing because how the htc enforced contract of a player you never heard of until yesterday what your really saying is your u subbing because you dont enjoy/value classic and just want virtue signaling points
---
Maybe for some classes but as a holy paladin I would hate to lose a shield in my offhand in pvp and have bubble to break bad cc most of the time 
---
I get what putting a debuff on yourself can do in pvp, and i get what a sprint could help with. 
---
What i dont get is how its so useful to everyone when when you have to wait 30 seconds to use it after equipping it 
---
and how many classes and go into a PvP situation theyre losing and fight with no offhand waiting to debuff themself on cc. 
---
it sounds more like an item a severely overgeared healer could equip to pocket heal a severely overgeared warrior to become immune to poly/sleep/charm/blind/sap but really in just about any other situation seems dumb and over hyped
---
I do it with single vanish, it's a pain, because you have to wait 5mins for CD or just risk it. Still not sure if +hit% help to not get resisted.
---
I mean if you click the link of the post it literally says who he is in his twitter bio. That said, some of these other responders are being salty and irrational af lol
---
I didn't think it was a big deal either until they fired the two announcers.
---
He broke the rules, so whatever on the money. But firing the announcers too? That showed a deeper meaning there.
---
That was their way of telling China "They took care of it". 
---
It really showed their true colors. They really, really want to launch the new Diablo in China. Consoles aren't a thing there (I think they are banned?) but mobile gaming is HUGE.
---
Just bought a car at auction and the rules at car auctions are as folows;
---
1. Minimum acceptable price is listed in the catalogue against each vehicle.
---
2. If the vehincle fails to meet that price the Auctioneer may say "Sold Provisional" - this means they will contact the seller to see if they will accept the final bid price, or, 
---
3. They may decide the price is too low and say that it hasnt even met the minimum for a provisional sale.
---
3.
---
That seems even more convoluted and grindy? Just accept that not everyone is going to get R14; just like not everyone is going to get ateish, or thunderfury. It's not that big of a deal.
---
Oh great to see the hate bandwagon slip into other IP's.. let's punish every single hardworking soul at this evil corporation for what happened and conform to the masses of reddit warriors for justice.
---
/s
---
The two formulas I found are divided by levels. 
---
Attacker levels 60+: 
---
DR% = Armor / (Armor + 400 + 85 \*(AttackerLevel + 4.5 \*(AttackerLevel-59)))
---
Attacker Levels 1-59: 
---
DR% = Armor / (Armor + 400 + 85 \* AttackLevel)
---
This is from Vanilla WoW wiki, and I cannot guarantee it's accuracy. Although I suppose some quick math for your armor level and comparing to the damage reduction your character sheet shows would probably be a good verification.
---
I agree that you shouldn't be able to cancel an auction with a bid on it.
---
In my opinion adding gear incentives to pvp was a mistake in the first place.
---
What is a good price for Devilsaur Leather on the AH?
---
It's the same arguement op is trying to get through. There's a ton of people at level 60 or near 60 and they wouldn't mind having phase 2 sooner rather than later. Blizzard has the numbers and can hopefully make the right release schedule. There's no point listening to entitled casuals or entitled hardcores.
---
Anyone cringe when they see these? I almost always see them as memes made by kids too young to really know how a meme works.
---
I understand it's your group and you get to decide how it runs, but part of a tank's job is to coordinate and arrange the pulls and pace of the run, not a mage's, this is asking for bad habits and sloppy play.  Maybe you should have rolled a tank instead?
---
Big if true.
---
Good one . Got an exhale out of my nose.

---
It's all gravy, I shudda just lurked hahah
---
It's a joke.
---
Rogues have Evasion, which cranks up the Dodge chance, which lets the Warrior use Overpower. Due to the high Dodge chance, Overpower is the only thing that Warriors can effectively do, as it is a guaranteed hit.
---
You defined a shortage when trying to claim there‚Äôs no shortage
---
this is not healthy.
---
gloves and belts etc do sell because they often only vendor for 50s or so and people will snatch such stuff for 1g50 because 1g50 is something they can miss. Weapons that require huge fees to even put on the AH and you're forced to AH for like 7g to make a profit? Not so much.
---
Its crazy that maggots also share the same base model as these
---
DM should have released with launch.  Its not a lvl 60 zone.  It's requires for lvl 55 mage water and so warlocks and paladins can complete their epic mount quest.  Why should every other class in the game get the option of getting an epic mount except these 2 class's?  That doesn't make any sense.  Why have water at every 10 levels, 5, 15, 25, 35, and 45 and not 55?  That doesn't make any sense.  
---
Fact is, DM was always originally planned to come out with release but they ran out of time.
---
Id say phase 2 in general brings most of the core gameplay.  Anyone forget to bring a key to a dungeon?  Phase 2 brings back the keyring.  Hunters finally get the ability to get an epic quiver to match the epic bow they get from MC.  PVP finally has a meaning and a reason to exist with the honor system.  
---
Honestly i'm surprised phase 2 wasn't part of phase 1, and make phase 2 the BWL phase.
---
Hey there, as a former Rogue Raider back in the day, a pretty good spec in general (PvP and PvE) was combat.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/0052030055-3201052020050150221
---
That's about what I ran with back in the day.
---
Auto-attack + Poisons/Bleeds were nice.  Always keep Slice N Dice up and you did pretty well DPS wise.
---
PvP wise it has good burst, good functionality vs enemy CC.  I'm not sure what race you play, but Human Rogue is pretty nice too with Swords.
---
I'm torn. It's a fine weapon for pre raid, but you can replace it rather quickly once you get into MC/Ony. 
---
On the other hand it looks really fucking cool.
---
On the third hand if you farm the book you can sell it for a ton of money. Money that could be turned into LH helm or an epic mount. Hmmm
---
No, but they're strikingly mortal.
---
That‚Äôs not what hardcore raiding is, at all lmfao. Anything you can do in a day is not hardcore if anything it‚Äôs quite casual.
---
This can‚Äôt be real
---
It's more about Blizzard's specific response to it, which was a very public harsh punishment for him and the casters, rather than a silent ban.
---
Wow!
---
I did my lockbox grind in LBRS in those pretty good packs of mobs, VERY helpful to have a spammable macro for all parts of this.
---
Also insane and congrats to getting this done so soon. I don't know if I have the time this go around to get all the factions up to exalted in Classic.
---
The Scumbag rogue

Steals your chest, steals your mining node, steals yours herbs, Vanishes when you try to do the same, steals your girl, beats you in DPS pressing 1 button, Vanishes leaving you to die in WPVP, pisses off Alliance in low level areas then leave at the slightest sign of danger leaving their faction to deal with the mess they caused
---
Yes, I do remember now. It was WOTLK, I remember our guilds main tank bragging about blowing up some clothie with an 8k shield slam, and yes, it definitely had a dispel effect too. Good times.
---
While annoying I have to disagree. You should be able to get what you want for your item. People just need to use the minimum bid more appropriately.
---
Links not right atleast for mages
---
Think the guy above me misunderstood. Shamans are going to going to be much more enjoyable, fun and viable in solo PvE than Warriors.
---
safe travels!

"no!!! I remember the past this way!!! you're WRONG!!!!"

R10 Stamina and Armor, maybe R4ish Fire Res? Can't remember. It gets whatever buffs are given to the group at the time. I usually send him in and once he gets below 50% I just keep him by my side and have Furious Howl keybound. Most of the fights just have too much AoE around the boss and I'm not wasting mana casting mend pet during a long fight.
---
True, but my theory is.
---
With my War buddy I will be healing (which I like) so 10%int would be a great start. I was then going to grab 70% less pushback and thought I may as well grab conc while im there. I prob will tank if I run something without war anyway.
---
Is this really how Classic players think?? By the time this Classic Wrath comes out the actual Expansion will be almost 20 years old.
---
Classic doesn't, nor will it ever, have enough relevant content to keep people subbed. Getting to the raids takes longer than clearing them, and what about after that, you gonna farm the 60 instances for some Blue Drops or sit in AV all day? If thats the case all the power to you, your time and money to waste.
---
Theres a difference between AoE farming and this though.  I'm not a mage either.
---
Well Final Fantasy is obviously not a fair comparison because the built in name recognition from decades of games lol.
---
Just looking at any list of "most anticipated mmos" though from back then you'd find FF and Archage on any list basically ex: https://www.mmorpg.com/columns/mmorpgs-most-wanted-mmos-of-2013-1000007462

This isn't about "butthurt". Here you are, able to vote, speak out against the government if you don't like what they're doing, protest, hold a job of your choosing, etc... and you're here condemning citizens of Hong Kong for trying to fight to protect those very rights YOU are now sitting here flaunting without a thought in the world...because your lazy ass has never had to FIGHT for those rights.  
---
You're a garbage human.
---
yup. even in pve, id rather have an extra 1k life/mana than 3% more dps. ive seen mages pass on t1 or offset pieces because a green frozen item has 5 more sp.

So I thought this scenario was pretty bad just like any human being, and moved on with my day. After all, it's just another company siding with profit. Then after sleeping on it, it was the FIRST thing on my mind upon waking up. "This is just plain fucked up!" It's not like the players words even impact blizzard directly, he is just one player of a game voicing his opinion on a nation's actions that BLIZZARD ISN'T EVEN FROM. the fact that the newscasters (whose job is to report news) got fired just for doing their job is insane.
---
I have thoroughly enjoyed playing classic wow and LOVE the fact that it is finally re released in a format I can play forever, but I just cannot support a company that could side with China. It's common knowledge to any American, politics aside, that the Chinese government has a vast history of ignoring basic human rights. Saying anything else is revisionist history!
---
Never got to raid BWL and beyond in vanilla, and I guess I never will. Goodbye my paladin, it's been fun.
---
Even LotRO has done this forever. Keeps people from mucking up the sort by posting with 1c starting bids on literally everything.
---
It must be fucking exhausting stopping to think about how every single penny you spend supports China. Whatever device you are typing on was partially manufactured in china you fascist
---
Agreed. Nothing really else to say.
---
Ooph... I got one for 250 and it was a GREAT choice, IMO. DR's is best, but honestly thrash isn't awful to have until you find a replacement, the proc is great.
---
yeah I know I should speak up more often. i have this annoying mentality of sticking with a group until we complete our goal, even if it's a shitty run. i try to be the last one to quit the group. i'm not sure why i torture myself like this, but it does feel good when we can make it through a dungeon as a sub-par group. it does get expensive in terms of water, though...

Seriously wtf.

1000 times this! I tried selling a recipe that was consistently put up on the AH for 5g for days on end. It never sold, but the other 5 were still there at 5g (and 5g10, 5g25 etc).
---
So I put it back on for 3g, leaving a big gap with the 2nd item. Sold within the hour.
---
Yeah that's mainly what I was interested in, but once the energy system was buyable it became completely unfun, even if since I had bought in I had a giant advantage. It's only fun if I'm gaining an advantage from being smart or just being no life lol, buying a win is just shit.
---
Dude, if I make a post about Protoss or something else in the gam in r/sc2 I expect people to know or at least Google /click on the damn link to know what that is. Similar thing here..
---
Ok then, I won't trust Blizzard support again. Thanks fr the heads up.
---
Not a shill, just a rational human being.
---
Oh don't worry, I know I could be faster... but I am leveling with friends, so we stay in a relatively close level range to play together. Given the initial time frame, that would've given us enough time to do everything while it was current, so might as well enjoy the trip.  
---
I didn't have any addon for the first 20-25 levels, and finding stuff on a blank map with vague indication sure takes time. But what slows me down the most is inventory space. I bought whatever I can afford to have more space, but I am constantly going back and forth between the city and questing zones to empty the bags. Between quest items, healing stuff, rogue tools, I barely have 40 spaces available. Add to that pickpocket, skinning and herbalism, with a side of fishing, and the bags fill alarmingly fast (especially with the small 5/10 stacks). And sometimes, I arrive in a zone and there are corpses everywhere, so I take a couple minutes to skin them on the way. All of that adds up very fast.  
---
And for the levels 30-39 I grinded beasts (I heard they were solid gold farming for the mount) but long travel + fast bag filling = low exp gain. Doesn't help that as a rogue I have no good tool to farm faster (only Blade Flurry once every 2 minutes) and finding a good weapon is hard.
---
believe me, I know. I've played a troll shadow priest back in TBC, when their whole power was practically unknown and everyone wanted to be undead... we did a lot of 2v2 with an UA warlock and practically farmed the flavor of the month, high rated, warrior+healer teams.

and it's not just shadowguard... nobody rages as hard as a paladin when he has to work hard to even heal (hex), then finally bubbles under the pressure and you yoink their partner with a berserking + mind control before he can finish a single heal, with the DoTs sealing the deal. fun times.
---
cheers bro
---
It‚Äôs well done tbh.

They used to look like some level ~40 trash, too.

DMN dogs with skinning

or DME  with herb iirc there are some random herbs around
---
I have other comments as to what the classic devs should do.
---
Something like "reset and remove all the retarded shit gimmic crap that was bannable 13 years ago" and "stop banning people for valid gameplay".
---
depends on your server, the general median price across servers is like 8g per
---
Holy. Shadow can use the bracers and mp5 trinket, that's about it.
---
Instead of decay there should be diminished returns. The longer you play the less you are rewarded. After 8 hours the honor you gain should be reduced like 80%. Just add a debuff call it exhaustion every if you get X honor let's say 1000 then it is reduced 10% for 24hs if you get 1000 more the debuff increases to 20% for 24hours.  It caps out at 80% reduced which let's be honest makes pvping not worthwhile for the 24hours period. The timer doesnt reset with each new stack so at 8 stacks if you were doing 2000 honor per hour at the start at 5 hours you would be doing roughly half 1000 which means after 5 hours and still having a 19hour debuff it probably wouldn't be worth continuing to actively grind for Honor
---
Totally depends on the supply and demand of your server. It's impossible to say on here. Your best bet is to use an auction house addon such as Auctioneer that monitors the fluctuation of costs.
---
My mentality is if something you need drops, roll on it as the shit from further bosses might not drop. Like mc last week I got Quick Strike Ring and nothing else dropped that I needed for the rest of the raid. Now I dont need the ring.
---
&gt;amirite
---
r/iamatotalpieceofshit
---
LOL...It's not that bad for me.  No kids, so more just making sure to cook &amp; eat together, hang out for a bit, then log in for a couple hours or not.  
---
Will add that my partner needs to travel occasionally, so able to grind hard on those days.
---
It has to do with politics. It doesn't belong here.
---
Take it to a political subreddit.
---
True, but so far I haven‚Äôt seen a pvp item including in the list the link produces
---
Reserve auctions are stated as such though and the reserve price has to given to the auctioneer before the auction starts.
---
Use Auctionator.  
---
It's simpler and less intrusive than Auctioneer.
---
This is dramatically different depending on the dungeon and the group.
---
I've had groups where I didn't have to use a single drink in the whole run and I've had groups where it was a drink almost every pull.
---
There are things you can do yourself to be more mana-efficient. Like trying to stay within the 5-second-rule for as long as possible and avoiding overhealing like the plague. But when you have to heal in order for the others not to die, you have to heal.
---
Thanks! It does seem hella tough, but I think for me personally the raids might be tougher. I'm playing a us server but I'm 8 hours ahead of ST haha
---
Players in California, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, and Colorado already got the early release.
---
There will almost always be room for at least a couple enhance shamans in most raid guilds that aren‚Äôt min/maxing everything . You might not be able to find a raid spot in the most competitive guilds as enhance , but it doesn‚Äôt sound like that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for anyway. There will be many other guilds that would be glad to have you .
---
All in your own pace, haha 11 days played is average 6 hours every single day since launch
---
The word your are looking for is Vanilla .
---
The problem with Amplify Healing in a raid setting is that even though it makes healing much more efficient, it also exaggerates the kind of spike damage to players which can cause deaths/wipes.
---
The problem with Dampen is it makes heals much less efficient, leading to Healers running out of mana. And any fights where Damoen might be useful are fights where resistance gear is usually used to negate magic damage anyway.
---
There's definitely fights or even phases of fights where Amplify makes sense on some or all members of the raid/party. It is something that requires communication so the healers know they can be downranking more and maintain the tanks health a bit higher just in case.
---
I played on PvE server back in 07 and never PvP much but I'm on a PvP server now. I just hit 40 and respecced shadow because the wPvP has been insane and it's my attempt at solo survivability. 
---
Can anyone give me good advice for PvP, along with a good/efficient PvE rotation? As for the PvE, I can't tell if it's better to not PW:S and use VE and rebuff inner fire every few mobs, or to not use VE and use PW:S.
---
If you want to try it again I'd definitely suggest respeccing to elemental, it feels way better. No reliance on RNG feels so much better, and if you go 30/0/21, once you get Nature's Swiftness you're a super capable healer too. I was almost regretting my Shaman at that level, but it really does start coming together soon or once you go ele over enhance.
---
If I kill a druid in pvp should i be allowed to skin them?
---
Where are the WoW MPQ files stored?
---
Puggle
---
Google blizzard Entertainment, you‚Äôll find news stories
---
I didn't down vote you, I simply asked what they needed to make a statement about, but you (kind of) answered it with your comment. 
---
But to answer your original question: Yes, the statement was to not use their streaming services to push a political agenda that would negatively impact their market share or they'll ban you from their games. Seems pretty cut and dry to me.
---
To someone who comes across them randomly in the world? Not really. All they see is a mage grabbing all the birds in the area and killing them all. They don't know that the mage isn't doing that all over the map. All they know is they needed some of those mobs too and the mage took them.
---
Plus a lot of the times as a rogue I'm already in the zone. I don't necessarily hold it against someone that they can't see me when they steal a mob from me, but if it's a mage taking *all* the mobs I absolutely will kill them for it.
---
Lmao imagine thinking someone actually living by principle as pathetic. I really mean this here. No U
---
&gt; But we get flying! :P Which nobody asked for xD
---
Are you joking? Everyone wanted flying mounts in vanilla and it was feature people were super excited about going into TBC.
---
I have no experience with paladins, but low level dungeons do not expect you to have the optimal spec. Just run them as whatever until at least lvl 55.
---
I doesn't. It has to do with Blizzard taking the hearthstone players money. That isn't political...
---
Did anyone else start a rogue to be endlessly annoyed by how obnoxious poisons are?
---
They last half an hour but if you are in combat they last maybe 8 minutes.
---
You need a bag dedicated to it and it takes a lot of time to make them, it is like having a whole other profession for an 8 minute combat buff
---
No Redbeard 3/10
---
Don‚Äôt sweat it everyone here knows it‚Äôs from the game if there‚Äôs a problem it‚Äôs blizzard‚Äôs
---
You have to put the one in the bank, b4 you send it off, some items this does not work with tho, GL!
---
The Furbolgs also give Timbermaw Hold rep.
---
Loremaster usually didn't require these quests, as they typically aren't major questlines or chains at all.
---
Most important thing as a warrior versus rogue is to get an intercept up with saved rage. You can quite literally oneshot a rogue inside intercept stun also they can't parry/dodge while stunned. The problem is surviving to that point, wear shield and then swap to 2hander before you get it off. A fear or some sort of engi item can put you in range to intercept
---
Well no ones forcing you to use it. Enjoy wasting bubble on CC. Any class vs a mage it is useful because you can break sheep every 30s not allowing him to reset also because you know, you cant block magic damage with a shield so already that doesnt matter.
---
Drain

Thanks a lot for the heads up! I'll get listin' 'em

Mage, extremely good class at everything they do.

I don't even roll on anything, I am in DKP system and don't bother spending it because what's the point?

you're apart of the problem, man
---
More like blizzard wants to silence anyone that will potentially make them loose marketshare.
---
You said EU didn't "zoom through classic" when your talking about freaken vanilla from 14-15 years ago lmfao.
---
Yet, you made it political by including China. So, it doesn't have to do with that, you made it about China.
---
Breach of contract = punishment.
---
Simple.
---
The "hate bandwagon" aka any large boycott based on principles ever.
---
Which engineering specialty would be better for a rogue, goblin or gnomish?
---
Dead like Blizzard's reputation
---
It's called reserve auction and it's very common.
---
Not only can you look around corners and stuff, it helps a lot.
---
Maybe not as much in WoW as FPS games, but it helps as it widens your field and gives a hell of a lot more information that would otherwise not be there.
---
I ran this for quite some time back in Wotlk with Eyefinity and Nvidia Surround and made some comparison screenshots where it "would help".
---
I figured this was the case, but wasn't going to make a big stink about it. I don't fish other people's nodes and just thought this was the norm, until someone ran up to my node and started fishing out of it while I was standing right there with my cast in the water.
---
The incident had to do with China...
---
Until level 30 I‚Äôd say you could. Maybe choose one, heal or tank. Honestly tanks are in high demand so finding a group shouldn‚Äôt be hard.

I definitely don't miss having mana not going to lie.
---
Yeah the ideal Classic+ with all the intended dev-wanted classic features they never had time to finish + depth will never come.

They'll probably lazily just release TBC with #nochanges and just put us 15 years behind on content scheduling and call it a day while they make new mobiles.
---
How do I link a recipe from my profession book to someone in /w?

But not their stock prices
---
You don't get it, he was *representing* them while competing in a contest with a bunch of other people! /s
---
He didn't damage their image, it's a bullshit, vague, catch-all clause so they can punish people if they step out of line in a way Blizzard decides they don't like *after* it's happened.  I get why it's there (you don't want a guy on "your" show going off on a racist rant), but they definitely used it punitively and only at the very outer edge of justifiably.
---
lol this is someone who tried to get something for way below market and the person selling it went, nah fuck that man you aren't screwing me over a silly mistake. Fuck off with that shit. The auction system is exactly as it should.
---
I'm trying to find motivation to use mine too. My Poisons skill is at about 110, but I'm just putting Instant Poison on my main and offhand. Crippling Poison is extremely useful in instances though, in any situation where a dying mob tries to run and pull other mobs.
---
Some, but not WoW.
---
sounds like it doubles as a great wow monitor. no need for 144hz refresh in wow anyway imo, i'd much prefer the screen real estate!
---
I'm a SWE myself and I currently use a 3 monitor setup (one vertical). Have you used a similar setup in the past? If so, how did you like it compared to your current setup? I'm considering switching to just one single ultrawide 4k monitor..
---
If you don‚Äôt like gearing melee don‚Äôt roll SPriest. People will want you to heal instead of DPS and mages/warlocks will QQ when you roll on their loot. Don‚Äôt roll warrior unless you are ok with being asked to tank constantly.
---
It's not the classic experience without someone telling someone else to reroll
---
This reads so much like a Darksouls invasion.
---
Shadow, Elemental, Enhancement, Balance, Feral, Arcane, Retribution, Protection (Paladin)
---
If they could find a way to balance these specs and make them more viable it would be amazing.
---
The incident had to do with breach of contract.
---
You're making about Blizzard &amp; China.
---
Howl of Terror. 10min CD, aoe fear.no dmg or health restoration
---
Grobbulus?
---
It being a pretty weak spell certainly could. 
---
OP should certainly test it out, but Holy Nova is nowhere near enough to match a Mage's AoE potential, even vs greys. Running OOM or dying are likely.
---
Lmaooo those all look Soo bad !
---
do people truly think that quitting classic will make a difference? regardless of who it is
---
Apparently Blizzard should have stood up for human rights and quickly go bankrupt as the income from China is immediately shut off.
---
Would any of these bleeding heart gamers donate money to help Blizzard recover financially?  No?  Blizzard should just do 'what is right' and fuck the bottom line?
---
Are any of these people who are cancelling Blizzard subscriptions also boycotting all "Made in China" goods?  No?  Then fuck off with your false protests.  You are actively pushing for a game company to suffer massive losses while you aren't willing to do the same.
---
Please stop harassing me. :)
---
What's embarrassing is your inability to understand that people can disagree with someone and not downvote them. The literal foundation of reddit depends on this principle for discussion. Downvoting people you disagree with only serves to stifle and censor discussion.
---
Lmao those all look Soo bad !
---
Personally I have limited time to play the game and want to spend the majority of it improving my own character, because that's the main reason I like classic--character progression. I do think people who have more /played are more willing to spare their time for friends/etc., but I'm not sure that those kinds of people make up a majority of the playerbase.
---
Wash yer crack!
---
This isn't a problem and why worry anyways if you're just casually tasting the game.  
---
DM being released is good for sub 60s. It's a leveling dungeon with several nice upgrades and class quests.
---
You still have faith in Blizzard? xD
---
"What about this quest over here, the player need to kill 10 boars in 15 minutes, how many boars spawns should we have."
---
"Uhh, 4?"
---
"Anything else?"
---
"20 bear spawns"
---
Yeah that‚Äôs why I was doing it, although I‚Äôm not sure what either rep gives tbh.
---
Yes people were excited for it I‚Äôm not saying that they weren‚Äôt. I was excited for it.
---
All I said is that nobody asked for it... never seen a post saying ‚ÄûOhhh I wish we could just fly anywhere ourselves‚Äú and even if so - they would have meant flying in Azeroth and not TCB land :P
---
Being happy about something you didn‚Äôt ask for is very common. 
---
If we really needed it people would have asked for it beforehand though...
---
You may prove me wrong but I have not seen anyone ask for it - though the internet wasn‚Äôt as big back then and not everybody was giving his opinion - unlike today...
---
So I might have missed it on the forums
---
Nah man.
---
Traffic should flow like water through a tap.
---
If you are impeding the flow, then you are traffic.
---
Just pay attention to how slow people get off the brake or accelerate and you'll see what I mean.
---
Stockpile a +int set.  You need about 6k mana pool to farm DME effectively.  Spec deep discipline and rotate PI/innerfocus on each lasher pack.  Look up frostradomus priest dme farm guide for more specifics about how to actually do the pulls.
---
I can respect that
---
Best title thus far.  +1
---
i thought i was king shit at 77. take my upvote sir
---
"Some **auctions** have a **Reserve** Price. A **Reserve** Price is a hidden minimum price that the seller is willing to accept for an item. In a **Reserve** Price **auction**, the seller is only obligated to sell the item once the bid amount meets or exceeds the **Reserve** Price. "
---
There is still a min bid that you cannot screw a bidder out of, the fact that is hidden does not change it.
---
No flying mounts, no level cap increase, and add something to keep Azeroth as relevant as Outlands, and you're golden. Keep the dungeons and raids in Outlands to introduce gear for the different specs instead of BETTER gear since you're no longer leveling. People can choose to do the old dungeons/raids for the old specs gear, or outlands for gear for different specs.
---
I think that'd keep vanilla feel pretty well
---
&gt; "Why is every tank I play with completely useless"
---
Look, if I get through the dungeon without a single corpse run, I know I've got a good tank. It helps that I'm a rogue and can't do the cleave meta, but I just don't feel the "gogogo" mentality some do.

Here's what I'm running because I like to switch up what I'm doing and also want to be able to defend myself.

No idea since I quit retail years ago. I just know you can buy a month‚Äôs time with in-game gold. The wow token was created to counter gold sellers.

Look at mage again.  4 pieces are honor rewards.

Take your pants off your head, they go around your waist.

Nightfall might be pricey but not SUPER pricey.  Maybe your guild will help you buy it if the guild has spare funds?  But it might very well be an upgrade for you as a fresh 60 given the difficulty in acquiring good 2h weaps.

Hey, thanks for your quick reply. I think I have had a "recipe" (the part where it shows which mats are required) linked to me by an Enchanter... So I assumed it works for Blacksmithing as well... but maybe it really doesnt?!?

correct, benefits from debuff.

Came back to an old thread to say I saw a couple of you outside Scholo! It's cool seeing the community here on reddit also. If you ever see lil ol' me I always throw you guys a /wave. I was the mage in the pink tabard, name's Seli! :)
---
Yeah but now youre bringing in real world stuff to how it actually functions in game. Like if you could set the reserve then youd set the reserve, but you cant, *so*, you just cancel the auction if you dislike that people arent buyout only bidding.

Get yourself a Rogue friend.

I did this for free for a friend of mine. (Took 15 hours of constant LBRS, but this was in Wotlk so no need to worry about aggro or so)

Farmed TLPD in Wrath, got him in just under an hour - when I made the post "/1 TLPD killed &lt;Timestamp&gt; &lt;Coordinates&gt;" people were super salty. Sort of bummed out they increased the spawn rate since then.
---
On my computer, I did several censuses since the beginning
---
Bravo.
---
The rates in guide videos are often inflated with drops and projected sales on AH  and not taking into account the down time to find a mailbox to mail items/corpse run.
---
It's 60g in a vacuum but the reality is much closer to 25-35G/hour taking in account bad luck, having to go repair/mail stuff.
---
Quite honestly, as much as I‚Äôd love to see them bring more content into classic, it wouldn‚Äôt feel right. I don‚Äôt have enough confidence in Blizzard to think they could make new content that feels like Classic content and doesn‚Äôt destroy actual Classic content (like giving even better gear).
---
It would be best to make BC server options.
---
Mark Kern quitting WoW is news that a lot of people are interested in, regardless of the reason (which is not even included in the title).
---
That's exactly what I am interested in! We should be able to figure out the math behind this, right?
---
Oh boy. The ignorance in this forum is reaching new levels.
---
You can, but he asked specifically for the profession book, so I didn't include that. And as you said, I normally just use Atlas Loot to link anything I don't have, it's more work than it's worth (in my opinion) to go to Wowhead unless you're using it in a macro as you described.

I also wrote a macro to help me inserting item links into other macros, since it's hard to remember the exact text required.

---
If that's the case, I'll simply tell you that I am from Kansas City, and then report you for harassment and move on.

I started with healbot, since I've also been using it forever, but it has just been insanely buggy for me. I switched to clique with raid frames, and it's been great for me. Personally, I recommend switching.
---
There is a quest in Arathi for the horde where you have to get 15 of these things from raptors that only spawn in one location with a total of about 30 mobs and there are always 8 players trying to do the quest.
---
omg thank you
---
I always follow that line up with ‚Äúand keep reaching for the stars‚Äù. Lol
---
If you're going to spend that much on rep it's absurd to me that you wouldn't have gone for a raptor.
---
Gratz!
---
Banning and taking away the price money is overblowing it though. Let‚Äôs compare it to sports players who in many occasions have used a platform to express a political statement. Xhaka and Shaqiri at the world cup in Russia for example. Their punishment was a fine that is rather meaningless to them. Sometimes players get 1-3 matches ban. Because FIFA needs the players. They cant afford to loose them. And the visibility is big. Blizzard on the other hand doesn‚Äôt need e-sports starts as much as keeping the Chinese market. 
---
It‚Äôs clear that financial reasons are what‚Äôs motivating blizzard to act so harshly.
---
Except the problem is he doesn't like being a caster at all. Healing or Damage.
---
No power creep. Instead, include new tier set armor with different, useful, and unique set bonuses. Keeps the game and class roles creative and specific to each class.
---
feels bad
---
Then don‚Äôt do the content yet? Your literally looking for a reason to cry and complain. Your just a little whiny bitch
---
Most groups will only take 60s, but 58+ should be doable.
---
Still, if you can grind out those items sooner. Then that's less to do in the Phase the event was suppose to take place in.
---
I'm concerned that phase releases will be accelerated. In fact, if Naxx released today, I would bet it would be partially cleared by next week. - DPS is waaay higher than it was 'back in the day'.
---
One of the reasons they added Blood elves and Draenei was to give the Horde Paladins and the Alliance Shamans. I'm not sure why they'd just axe that part their races if they ever get released.
---
You could be playing ok. You could also be doing something really wrong. Sanity checks:
---
 1) Are you using the talent points you get from each level of your character? I believe the talent window shortcut key is 'N'.
---
 2) Are you going to your class trainers every few levels and buying upgraded skills?
---
 3) Are you then replacing your lower rank skills with the higher rank skills on your action bar so that you are actually using the higher (more powerful) ranks of the skill.
---
 4) Are you making sure to look for gear upgrades and equipping them on your character.
---
Hahahaha tough life.
---
Once capped with rep you only have to buy the mount right? And not a specific train?
---
Yeah I had one guy flip out at me cause I didn't want to duel him. He followed me around for a good bit just saying random stuff calling me a chicken shit and other weird insults. Was strange.. just wanted to level man..
---
People know why they have the rule. Stop acting like anyone is confused. It‚Äôs not confusion about why the rule exists, it‚Äôs disbelief Blizzard would employ it to silence the specific topic.
---
Also, editing your comment to reference your dwindling karma is always a pretty bad look. Stop caring about your fake internet points.
---
i really dont understand the hate behind this- the guy broke the rules? no politic stuff? i mean i almost might save i hate china but i dont understand the outrage
---
I did it for a while as combat and it's worth the gold to go sub and then back to combat for raids, even if it's 100g for the change later on.
---
The rate is much better in sub and you die less due to unlucky resists.
---
It's not a fund grind tbh, but I want exalted with Ravenholdt, so I'm doing it for the rep with gold as a result of it, instead of my main focus so that I don't completely burn out.
---
Elemental can DPS in raids at least for most of the fight.  Do an early mana pot to get you back close to 100% mana, and then downrank as necessary later in the fight.  You're spamming casts anyways, if you weave in a rank 1 earth shock you will fish for extra clearcast procs, basically waste ZERO mana, and stretch out your longevity while hurting your overall DPS a bit.
---
lmao if reading quest text is too hard for u maybe ur just a brain tumor
---
is there an addon that sorts by buyout price?
---
&gt; which is not even included in the title
---
But it is in the twitter post shown in the post.
---
Rule #5.
---
Are you implying your pointless comments are any better after it's been established from the first response thay I got my answer? 
---
Farm your karma quietly, you're lucky this thread isn't deleted anyway.
---
I would guess with Holy Nova.
---
Firstly,  where does "The majority of players aren't 60 yet" data come from, was it a blue post or some other sort of data collection? 
---
Secondly, is the scope of that data based on characters, accounts, and how are multi-boxers factored in?
---
Thirdly, are accounts that havent played for 2 weeks or a month still factored in?
---
I'm only jelly :)

If it‚Äôs a mistake and you need it then you can just apologize to the group and explain why you needed it accidentally and any rational person would understand and not get upset with you over low level gear. And maybe you can try to make it up to them some way. Yesterday a rogue in our group accidentally ninja‚Äôd a chest because he thought it was for a quest and apologized. No harm no foul. He could have been lying, but he seemed like a nice person the whole run so I think he was being honest. 
---
But in this context, this guy clearly meant to steal it, as he asked if they were doing any more runs, waited until everyone rolled to see how much competition for it he had, and immediately left the party after winning it.
---
Is this Nethergarde Keep? If so, Brownbeard is an awesome guy and a great tank. Healed him in deadmines and it's one of my best memories of classic so far :D
---
So do i, and have to select region and realm on login.
---
Facts.
---
Second. Even just a frame-by-frame cartoon would be awesome
---
1k words, grats.
---
Money is literally the only thing blizz cares about. It's a small thing but it's the best you can do.
---
I'm considering a "how to be a good group member" course for some guild-mates, and codify some group dynamics as well as demonstrating why you don't drop max ranked earth shock on a pull.
---
Yeah, but there are people not interested in overwatch and just the rule 34 aspect. That said I‚Äôm sure there are already a couple of posts that do this the same way a couple of sites do with net neutrality and the like.
---
Does this go for tanking as well?
---
Nah, I'll simply report your post for harassing me and continue to report other posts that break the rules.
---
My report button is getting a lot of work today.
---
Depends on the group really. While Tanks and Healers usually get geared first, in my experience the least geared DPS get the gear first since it buffs the raid more than giving it to the "best" players. It ends up screwing over people who work hard and put the effort in to get their best pre raid BiS's because it helps the group more.
---
As a mage I have unlimited amount of food and my aoe spells are very costly. I have to drink pretty much every pull even if I still have 40-60% mana left (just in case if shit hits the fan). Also in don't mind to sit down for 1-2 Mana tick every time I have a chance. I usually tell tank to not worry about my mana unless he is going to pull aoe pack. Oh yes if anyone interested, I make 100ish bottles before dangeon to share with casters (2 stacks for everyone who ask) and then even more as I use 40-60 every run. 
---
Tldr mages need tons of mana to finish the dangeon.
---
The numbers over spell icons indicate which key the spell is bound to
---
how can you be this dumb
---
I reported it for both (since it is both political and low-effort.)
---
Nothing is going to change FYI. Only thing that will change is you missing out on a fun game you love playing LOL Smart move.
---
Troll hunters are great for pve due to berserking.   Orcs are great for pvp for stun resist.   The trolls plus to bow skill is nice when you're using a bow, but most best in slot ranged weapons are crossbows. 
---
Never played a caster in classic.   But both will have bag space issues cause soul shards for lock and ammo bag/quiver for hunter. 
---
Warlocks get a free mount at 40, hunters get aspect of the cheetah at 20.  Hunter pets are a lot more to manage to warlock pets.
---
Oh, did not think of using AtlasLoot. That will work just fine for me. Thanks for the help!
---
that look like a question?
---
Lmao at archeage being competition to anyone in 2019.
---
Unyielding Maul.  80-90% of what Warden staff is, IMO
---
You're contradicting yourself here. The tank can't dps because the mobs are nuking him down? Getting nuked as a tank gets you rage..
---
No
---
People cancelling their subscription is a fly compared to the revenue they would lose if China censored the game.. They made the right decision
---
If it was a really high level enchant (i.e., Crusader) then he might have had a macro to do that. You can use Wowhead to get the item link.
---
Lol you bitter retail guys need serious help
---
well thx guys i went horde tho lmao
---
OP said
---
Why open LBRS or UBRS when "the vast majority of players aren't 60 yet"? We should have released them in November with Diremaul.
---
Why open Deepwind Pass when "the vast majority of players aren't 60 yet"? It's nothing there and we cannot raid Kara yet.
---
Why open Blasted Land when "the vast majority of players aren't 60 yet"? We are not going through the dark portal anytime soon.
---
And the list goes on...
---
It's not that big of a deal and people are reacting like blizzard is release Naxx next week. People WILL still raid MC and onyx and they WILL still do other dungeons because there is not much content right now let alone the whole vanilla.
---
Haha I did the same thing, also as a warrior!  
---
I remember - all my gear went red and I thought all my gear was permanently broken already at lvl7 so I rerolled right then and there.
---
Unrelated point: yes you can. 
---
Main post: the melee fire damage buff can be nice if you get a melee weapon upgrade and still waiting on a wand upgrade. I would usually have agro using my succubus, so mobs are usually in melee range. 
---
The +fire spell dmg is applied to both the upfront and dot damage. I forgot what percentage is applied to each. 
---
The hellfire thing is BS.
---
"I was totally cool with censoring our art for Chinese money, but this is just too much!"
---
Increased threat gen is not a taunt. It means you gain aggro faster. A taunt immediately puts you at the too of the aggro table. Huge difference.
---
Neither of those is a taunt lol
---
If you're Horde, Desolace cage diving might be for you
---
I drink only water, I exercise 5 days a week (400-700 calories each time), and I am generally healthy -- healthier than most people over 50 (or over 40). My blood pressure comment was half jest, but also half acknowledgement that I just don't like stress in my casual gaming time -- you're taking my comment a bit more serious than I meant it.
---
With killing they'll respawn. People can camp the spawn point. With MC you can take the mob for hours if you wish and hide somewhere nobody will find.
---
I don‚Äôt know about other priests but my shield doesn‚Äôt last long against most warriors. I also can‚Äôt use desperate prayer effectively because of Mortal strike, and forget about casting anything while a warrior is pummelling you once shield is gone. Fear doesn‚Äôt work either so I don‚Äôt have anything to deal with a warrior. 
---
At least I can silence casters &gt;_&lt;
---
Tauren can't use Raptors in classic. The wolf is the only other faction  mount they can use.
---
Mount doesnt require rep. Mount training does.
---
And mount training is specific for every race - meaning if you want to ride wolves AND raptors, you gotta train wolves AND raptors.
---
Dampen doesn't really see use in raid settings, as the healing is more important than the damage reduction
---
Amplify is only really useful when you have a tank that is only receiving physical damage, which isn't particularly common
---
Taurens cant ride Raptors, sad days
---
60 mage here; usually every other pull, if pulls have 4+ mobs. So I can usually go about 2 groups with a few mobs before drinking, if that makes sense. Every 8 minutes I get Evocation and I can skip it. As long as it's not too crazy and my mana is at least around 40-50% the tank can pull the next group, if the healer is also ready.
---
Okay, so if youre arms right now, I would stay arms with such low hit %. aim for 9%, good onehanders, and then swap to fury.
---
Farm dungeons and BRS as much as you can to get your weapons /hit rating gear. once you get to molten core, low hit + arms spec will be weak.
---
Corrupt cache is my bet.
---
Tauren can‚Äôt ride raptors
---
Do you really think that would be healthy for the game? Most people arent 60 yet.
---
Forgot to mention that most runs are 4-5 man guild runs. 
---
Not once have we had a problem due to aoe.
---
For the past few days I've read people saying to spam Battle/Demo shout in dungeons to generate AoE threat and while it seems to work I want to know, which of the shouts generates more threat?
---
Holy nova as a damage/heal spell is awful.  IMO, the best and only use of it is to tag mobs first.
---
8 1/2 days played to 60 on my warrior. Know some people who were in the 6's.
---
That is the right decision, for the company, it‚Äôs workers and the people that enjoy its product.
---
You should have plenty enough heals with your dmg/healing gear and then you have +nature dmg for the extra DPS.  Then just rock straight +healing if you are dungeon healing
---
Not the app.  Just the mobile website.
---
It seems messed up that posts get removed because they're missing functionality that doesnt exist WTF?
---
I think there is a difference between a company mandating political positions and a random person sneaking in commentary in an interview.
---
Oooo got me with the half wit comment again. üî•
---
Depends. I've seen groups/guilds have limits on DKP. once you reach a certain limit you can't gain more, it's a use it or lose it approach. 
---
Basically you get points for showing up, some for trash,  then a set point for every boss downed.
---
I‚Äôm under no delusion that Blizzard will notice the lack of my $15 a month. But if lots of other people do the same thing (not to mention the loads of negative press they're getting right now), Blizzard might feel something, at least.
---
But whether or not they notice me doesn‚Äôt matter. The fact is, I don‚Äôt feel good playing this game anymore because of this situation, so I cancelled my subscription.
---
It happened to me today. I have characters on another realm but as soon as I logged in I went right to Mankrik, no having to select the realm.
---
I hope, a few years from now, you briefly remember what you said here today.
---
And realize how embarassing and out of touch it sounds.

Don't forget half his face melted off.
---
Are you kidding me? These are BLIZZARD fans you're talking about. Blizzard's fanatics will go to the moon and back for blizzard. They are called fanatics for a reason. If they found out blizzard was struggling financially after losing their market in China they would absolutely donate money, buy the most expensive cash shop item they could and gamble away tons of money on loot boxes.
---
This community is proof of the legion of fanatics' devotion. Blizzard just came out and indirectly said "we support the country that is taking away it's citizens' human rights by murdering them and taking their organs against their will" and people are still here, playing the game like nothing has happened.
---
You can also use an app called OnTopReplica for anything that doesn't support PiP (like Netflix/Hulu). Just Maximize the video, set it as the replica, and tab back over the WoW.
---
Warrior struggle is real
---
Their only porn is Dwarven maidens giving the singer Beck a bath.
---
Unfortunate.  But ultimately, game developers are not in charge of financial decisions.  This was 100% a financial calculated risk.  Loss of all revenue from China or minor short term loss of revenue from western players.
---
Why is no one mad at Blitzchung?  He literally forced Blizzard into a lose-lose situation without risking anything himself.  Now Blizzard has to scramble to determine if it is better to be the social pariah in the West or shut off the Chinese market for the indeterminate future.  Losing access to a market, even for a few months makes it incredibly hard to get back to the status quo due to loss of interest and stigma.  Instead of using his own stream or his own platform, he hijacks Blizzard to make a plea that Blizzard has no way to affect change.
---
If Blizzard did nothing and China pushes back, Blizzard has no leverage.  Deny game access?  China can either counterfeit it or just shrug and move on.  Games aren't a keystone commodity that will bring China to the negotiating table.  Manufacturing is.  And not boycotting "made in china" while demand Blizzard support HK is incredibly naive and hypocritical.
---
No way to address this un-publicly. Any action taken would have had spotlight. The reduction of the purse is literally written in the rule. 
---
Got me on the caster thing and I do think that is the worst thing they did here was fire the casters but I have no idea what their agreements look like. I could understand firing them for "allowing / encouraging" the behavior but not sure how their contracts are spelled out exactly.
---
I'm Norwegian, and when I was younger I thought one of the dwarf phrases was just them speaking Dwarfish or some fictional language. Sometimes I would walk up to one and they'd exclaim "imtrest yana paynt?" Years later I randomly realized he was trying to be a homie and give me a beer.
---
I'm NA East and I've rolled on an NA West PVP realm (Whitemane). Being 3 hours ahead of the server means that even at 2 am there's a bunch of people online still. I've seen alot of lowbies lfm deadmines and stocks. If you end up rolling there on alliance, pm me!
---
i was gonna say, why doesnt he make the ultimate move and quit blizzard? but hes not the current classic team lead
---
I was an officer in a guild using loot Council back from Vanilla till Wraith.
---
Basically the officers decided who got what loot. When done correctly it's a great system, you can prioritise the biggest upgrade, you can avoid giving it to a trialist who may or may not stick around. The main reason we used it over DKP was after a while you'll have people with more DKP than they could spend, so they'd use it on side grades. It also meant people wouldn't spend DKP in MC when they were waiting for something in BWL. Even depreciating the cost of items often wouldn't work and we'd have to talk people into the item, disenchanting upgrades, or giving it to them and facing the blowback from people who had bought the item and now were behind. I can't tell you how much pain Rejuvenating Gem brought because all the priests wanted it and refused to spend points on anything in MC until they had it. 
---
It's also a good system for one off items, like the leaf or eye from Domo, or the bindings. The problem is its very easily abused and your officers need to be both trusted and liked by the guild.
---
Because of all these posts on reddit I have found myself being scared needing on gear in dungeons because of the fear of being mistaken for a ninja haha. 
---
I‚Äôm always so confused when I have to roll. I‚Äôm a warlock fyi
---
Wut, Esfand fought a raid last night or night before that were they legit had a massive war underneath SW while on stream. I don't think it's bannable
---
Of all the piss poor takes I‚Äôve seen on the issue this has to top the list.

Wait it's "a pint"? Here I am, thinking dwarves wanted to pick a fight with me for the last 15 years...

Has nothing to do with what's going on in Hong Kong. This is a gaming subreddit, so what's going on in Hong King is irrelevant here.
---
I'm not going to state any position about the situation over there in this subreddit because I'm not going to violate rule #5, and it's also irrelevant to conversations about Classic WoW.
---
I‚Äôve narrowed my class choice down to a melee class, warrior and rogue. If I want to be competitive in PvP with a high skill cap class, what do you guys think?
---
Outside of the obvious lashers that everyone suggests, which will be the best money, There are plenty of ways to farm gold as a priest. If you are an enchanter, at 60 you can do herod runs or RFD bosses to DE blues into Small Radiant shards. Usually run 3g per shard. This will get you 15-25g per hour.
---
Get a guild mage to hook you up with water and you can farm elites, yes we can farm elites, at Tyr‚Äôs hand or I like the cobalts in winterspring. Also in winterspring, you can complete the eko quest chain and farm eko. They vendor for like 3g a stack and you will get decent greys/greens along the way.
---
If not over camped, you can farm essence of water in felwood, essence of earth in silithus (also gets you hydrax rep) (dont rec the air elem as they don‚Äôt drop as much vendor stuff).
---
Other main money maker is farming felcloth in felwood or azshara.  Take your pick and be ready to grind. We don‚Äôt get easy money but we can still make money outside of grps
---
I stopped reading after you said what a brave statement. Thanks? I think it's time to stop choosing humans over the millions of other species we are destroying to just be comfortable. It's time for us to go away.
---
I agree, but... it's against rule #3
---
I do all three roles in every dungeon up to UBRS as a Holy spec'd Paladin. For tanking you need Consecration so at the earlier levels it's probably pretty rough. I'm also not the best tank due to lacking important Protection talents but I hold aggro well enough to get the job done. And most people are fine with it as tanks are in short supply so they're desperate lol.
---
That's what I love about playing a Paladin. It's really easy to make a hybrid spec to perform two or three roles in dungeons. Thus, it's super easy to find groups and get a lot of good gear fast (many times I'm the only person in the group who can wear plate so I get it by default).
---
[This is my talent build for reference](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/05503120501351-0502-050050012)
---
Just like the Nazis made the right decision for them and their families.
---
Deathwing was a metaphore to global warming all along.
---
I have a guild of 300 and probably 15 60s this quote is by all means accurate. There aren‚Äôt truly that many of us that hard stuck with one class to 60 in a few weeks.
---
I was hyped for p2 as well. Cancelled My sub as well.
---
I think another Naxx-level raid would totally work. Naxx is hard AF, and it is also long and with a pretty big amount of bosses. Still, it takes time to gear people up. And some of the later bosses are a much larger hurdle.
---
So another raid, equal to naxx in terms of size and gear, could be suitable.  Guilds can start clearing the easy bosses in both raids, then move to the medium difficulty and finally the most difficult bosses. All while offering some additional goodies, such as: Ofsspec items, pvp items, fun trinkets, new enchants, mounts, reputation grind stuff, etc.
---
he left blizzard ages ago

Comparing yourself to 16 hr a day raiding every single day for weeks including split raiding on 6 alts is laughable my guy

I am a level 47 Shaman. I chose the elemental/Resto route. Will I be able to heal everything in pvp and pve at level 60?

4th question: why do you care?
---
They could have just done nothing? That is actually an option...
---
I mean...thats exactly how it works on WoW.  A seller determines the minimum theyre willing to sell it for.  If it doesnt hit that amount, they cancel the auction and keep the item.
---
I think it is dumb as well. I guess people filter by flairs.
---
Alliance. 
---
I personally feel that Alliance has better leveling zones and experiences, the capital cities are cooler too. There's not a huge difference between the communities, hordies tend to see themselves as being more 'hardcore' in my experience but hey maybe that's just me.

I heard he didnt get a raid spot so he was gonna quit anyways, this just makes it easier for him to justify giving up  /s

An ex boyfriend of mine played a dwarf rogue on Khaz'Modan and I'd watch him play. BC comes out, he's super excited for the xpac, I make a blood elf and noob it up for a while, he quits, 12 years later here I am. He was an asshole and I took the account over that was his, eventually made my own and would use both accounts to run my lowbies thru stuff. Just have my main account now, but I'll never forget that lil noob warlock that melee'd and thought more stamina meant I'd run faster.
---
As much as I dislike what blizzard did, we as westerners must also realize that China makes up an extremely significant amount of revenue to activision-Blizzard. If they wouldn‚Äôt have punished the player, they would‚Äôve risked the Chinese Government banner blizzard products in China would could have extreme financial repercussions to the company
---
To my knowledge you can no longer have all Classic Exalted reps due to a long ago bug fix with Magram/Gelkis reps.

Actually, something has changed. I have denied material support for a communist regime while heading back to one of my favourite games of all time, Elite Dangerous. I haven‚Äôt decided what to do with the nearly $60 I‚Äôll be saving by year‚Äôs end. Maybe buy a few cool indie game free of Chinese influence :)
---
Very smart move.
---
After reading most of the comments on here I noticed no one directly asked this: Do you actually click on all the icons, or do you use the keyboard for the abilities that are bound? I personally use 1 through 5 and alt-1 through alt-5 as my bindings and I click on every other ability or macro. I also know someone who has issues with their left wrist and can only use the mouse. So it's unfair for people to assume what your situation is.
---
What is the best Shaman sub-class to level? I‚Äôm currently leveling a 46 warrior and trying to take advantage of rest exp and get a change of pace. 
---
Is Elemental the best if I also want to be able to heal dungeons leveling? Or should I do Enhancement to solo easier and switch later?
---
Flying mounts are fine and resilience didnt kill pvp, it just changed it. Honestly I find saying that resilience killed pvp to be just absurd. A common complaint was being just getting blown up and literally unable to play the game, so what do you do? you need to lower the damage *somehow* and resilience accomplished that.
---
Its pre bis for warlocks I've see. Them selling for 200-300g.

I dont know if people are really paying that but someone might.

Imo it's not worth it that's a lot of G for minor upgrades.

He took the mob to 50% in one combo, which included judging SoR. Judging SotC would have prolonged his fight in this instance. It‚Äôs typically reserved for longer fights (20-30s+).
---
Well at least in my case, the vast majority of players I see anywhere including cities are not level 60. Starting to see a lot of people between 50-60 though, so it won't be long.

Oh damn, you guys on Whitemane?

Blizzard sided with the Chinese goverment over a hearthstone players beliefs, took away his prize winnings, banned him from competing for a year, fired the commentators who did the interview, and made a statements about the honor of the chinese country.

As the guy below said Ebbnflow is an amazing all around druid with great farming tips and builds. Check out Skarm if you are into Feral Tanking as he knows a lot about the class and items. Check out Shedo if you want to learn Feral DPS this guy is a wealth of knowledge into cat dps and how good they can be. And finally for PvP check out Revery, he is a phenomenal wpvp and duelist.

There are a couple "half tiers" as well, like the 5man dungeon tier 0.5 sets, as well as the ZG and AQ sets
---
And the casters who lost their jobs just for being in the screen? Normally I would give the benefit of the doubt to Blizzard in these kinds of situations but there really is no excuse for this.
---
Not saying it's not overpowered, or insanely overbudgeted stat-wise for a BRD trinket, however saying 
---
&gt;HOJ stays BIS for melee DPS the entire length of the game.

is a downright lie.

I'm shocked blizzard did this.

Dude Baron's mount is not a 1% drop rate.

You could just walk in solo to UBRS and mine without a group to kill something for it?

Lol, dude. Just stop. You realize you are getting bated right. Ignore the twats/trolls trying to get a rise out of you.

You got your question answered, save your breath/anger for a better cause...
---
No, stitches run fast as fuck
---
If it dropped as an actual item and no one needed it absolutely.
---
Blizzard made the correct business decision. Poor guy tried to use the platform provided by Blizzard to take a shot at one of Blizzard's largest communities and people are shocked he was punished??

China will ban every Blizzard game with no hesitation and that would lead to a huge revenue loss. Look at the NBA. A team official made a pro Hong Kong tweet and they lost all their China connections overnight.

Isn't it only dwarves that have the finest wares?

Not going to argue the semantics of a reserve auction, but here‚Äôs a different perspective:
---
I‚Äôve tossed thick leather on the AH and had it sell (buyout) within 5-10sec.
---
Let‚Äôs say I put Wardens Staff on the AH for 40g bid when I intended 400g, just a misclick. I was tired for something.
---
There are likely at least 100 people skimming at the AH at all times between 3 major cities and 2 layers, more during peak hours.
---
The odds of someone seeing that auction (high demand item) and dropping such a low bid within that 10sec window are REALLY good.
---
Now sure, it may get up to 300g in bids before it sells, but you‚Äôre being shorted 100g.
---
Why shouldn‚Äôt you be allowed to cancel the auction for a simple mistake?
---
Everyone gets 100% of their gold back who bids, you lose your deposit. Seems fair to me.
---

Lmao they made thousand needles into a real thing

I didn‚Äôt need you to say it for you to say it. :) I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs just a fun hobby of yours to go around viciously rooting out every single broken rule in every subreddit you visit.

I‚Äôm sorry you don‚Äôt care about human lives. Good luck, find compassion some day.
---
He streams on YouTube most days actually.
---
you get it
---
It's a vicious cycle and one reason I am not pushing very hard to get to 60.  The reality of it is that once you hit 60 you'll raid for multiple months to barely upgrade your pre-raid BIS gear.  Then a new phase will come out and all that gear you worked so hard for will now items that are better - and you will start the grind again on newer instances.
---
So if you like that gerbil wheel - knock yourself out and keep raiding with hopes for gear upgrades.  Otherwise - if you are able to, put your focus on just enjoying the game and the content.  If doing the same MC run every week gets boring for you just stop raiding and level an alt or do something else.  Chances are when a new phase comes out your guild will have lost people and you'll be able to get in at least a couple of raids to see the new content. 
---
Things like this are one of the reasons I originally quit retail (at level 85) and decided to treat Classic differently - I pushed to 60, then pushed to 70, then pushed to 80/85 while grinding raids and other BIS items (from tailoring for instance as a Mage) and Blizzard just kept moving the finish line.  I am aware that is the nature of how they make money and keep other interested and don't fault them for it but now I just enjoy content and if I raid great... if not, don't care.
---
Welcome :)

And here I thought Whitebears was a reference to a song of ice and fire (game of thrones) books, lmao

That's what I did immediately after dropping that group since I was out there already.  Warlock was running it 25g got my ring and no more mara.

Remember your level affects what is generally most valuable to leveling quickly. At lower levels, generally questing &gt; grinding, until around lvl 30. Then, you want to focus more on grinding mobs, filled in with convenient quests that augment your grind. After 45, and once you have your mount and a little more bag space, you can focus on quests again.
---
As a melee class, your ability to hit/damage mobs falls off dramatically on higher level mobs. Their armor is more effective against your strikes, and their defense makes them harder to hit.
---
This is generally why it is quicker to level against mobs at, or slightly below your level - in fact, if a mob is still green, you will find you do significantly more damage, as the role is reversed: your armor is more effective, you can dodge/parry more of their attacks due to your higher defensive rolls, while they avoid fewer of yours.
---
So, if you want to do killquests with mobs +3 levels higher, reach out in general and form up a group! You might make some friends and have fun at the same time!
---
Hate to break it to champ unless you live in the wood's in a cabin and live off the land nearly every product you buy is from a company doing immoral shit for the sake of product's at the cost of basic human rights.  I'm simply willing to accept that playing a game i enjoy in my free time does not equal me supporting china's authoritarian government.  Just like when you buy a pair of sneakers you not supporting sweat shops in eastern asia.  I am simply enjoying the few hours i have a day doing something i like as the rest of the time i'm sleeping/working.
---
Even without the sunken cost fallacy, it gets people engaged in the bidding process and gets them to think hard about the precise value of the item to them and what they're prepared to bid. Which might not happen if you've got a price up front and woolly idea of the value to you.
---
You‚Äôre claiming that you are entitled to win an item by bidding.. interesting.
---
Might as well remove the option to cancel auctions all together
---
Shouldn't fire casters, frost is better.
---
lmao this is so true.
---
It is certainly pretty mind-numbing at times, killing the couple bosses provides a little break in monotony though.  
---
I do enjoy slaying some mobs too I was just trying to prevent OP from farming random humanoids expecting 100g/hour.
---
My situation is that I posted an image tagged "humor" and got a hundred unrelated judgments passed on me for how I chose to play while leveling. I couldn't care less, and I'll consult a decent guide to get better before I take advice from any toxic kid in here.
---
You'll get way less. Dungeon boosting doesn't work, but it's good for getting the dungeon quests done and getting gear without competition.
---
Just get a normal group, as a tank it should take you about 1 minute.
---
2H always unless you're tanking in dungeons.
---
How did you get item rack icon off your minimap? I've been wanting to move the pop-up thing forever.
---
lol dude.
---
It comes in pints?!
---
I‚Äôm real quick to /ignore assholes. I wouldn‚Äôt entertain this dudes bullshit.
---
Yes, how dare anyone take even the smallest of stands against something with which they don‚Äôt agree. This whataboutism is weak.
---
&gt; He was not banned for making a political statement. He was banned because he made a particular political statement.
---
Except you don't know that because a different political statement wasn't made. If Blizzard bans this player for this statement and then doesn't ban another player for a different, equally aggresive statement than I would agree with you.
---
But since we don't have that evidence, "rules are rules" are all we have to go by. Besides, as other people have said, if you don't support a certain company because of supposed allegiance to China than you better stop wearing most of your clothes and using most of your electronics.
---
If I don't have time left on a seal I'll usually pop on SoC and judge it immediately to start a fight then put on SoR. From what I can tell the extra holy damage from judging SoC will combine with the damage of SoR as long as you don't judge SoR. I'm just going based on the numbers I see popping up on screen so this could be wrong but it seems to do more damage.
---
They start lasting the full 30min later on as they get more charges. Always gonna need a full bag for reagents and consumables but its nescesarry to be good on your class. I usually try to keep 40 instant poison, 20 crippling poison, 40 flash powder for vanish, 20 blindpowder, bandages, potions, buff food in a 14 slot bag.  That usually lasts me a few hours grinding and a dungeon.
---
I heard you still get xp, but you get more xp the more you are.
---
So a lv 60 with 4 lv 20-30 will give them more xp than a lv 60 with 2 lv 20-30.
---
I can't confirm or infirm this.
---
Well, if you'd read past the first 5 words you'd probably have seen a discussion of that stance and why I find it flawed, but since you aren't willing to read even an entire paragraph, much less a longer post, I think expecting a thoughtful discussion with you is probably too much.  I think calling yourself  a "basic man" is probably a good summary, although I think you are being unfairly critical of your gender.  I've known a lot of men, even basic ones, who can make it through a paragraph and exercise in some self-reflection.
---
I'm turning off responses and going to class now, but I hope you find some luck somehow in believing that genocide is a practical solution to any problem and not just a savage and ineffective method of oppression that doesn't even make a dent in global population or consumption.
---
I like the slow walk. That makes it scary.
---
Of course you don't. But it's convenient, repetitive, down the line if you gather up with experienced players you end up not having to focus too much (e.g. can watch something on second screen) plus you avoid much hassle, esp. if you are willing to tank. My dedicated tank from ~36 to 39 simply logged inside Armory, past the doors.
---
The only instance where I‚Äôm on the offending side is when people are doing ultra specific Spellcleave runs. Like, no, we need this many mages, this many warlocks, and we pull exactly like this. That does reek a little bit of copying a streamer, but people are normally quick to say that, yes, they copied this strategy from a streamer.
---
Thank you! I definitely regret not starting on an RP realm, I would surely spend time in Ravenholdt just chatting to those that come and go.
---
Originally they were 35-36g. Crystals were about 30g, which matches the price of a transmute. 
---
Now bars are about 56g. I didnt check on the price of crystals yesterday, as I'm not an alchemist, so not sure what they're at.
---
Until Bloodvine, which is a LONG way away in ZG.
---
So I don‚Äôt have a whole lot of time to play, but I‚Äôd like to get to 60 and experience the endgame nonetheless. However with limited time to play I‚Äôd like to not be able to get good gear and raid spots without having to dedicate time I don‚Äôt have.. at the moment I have a rogue, warrior and hunter I‚Äôve been playing around with. Considering my situation which would be the best one to move forward with?
---
Damn, being a hunter spoiled me, I thoroughly enjoy doing yellow/orange quests w/ my Broken Tooth...
---
Do quests
---
It‚Äôs a raiding guild but we aren‚Äôt in a huge rush I‚Äôm playing the longevity game not blitzing tier 1 raids.
---
Thank you guys! You helped a lot with infos :)
---
Your profession book contains spells you learned. In classic you can only link items in chat, no spells/talents/etc that retail allows. So you'd need to find the actual pattern that gave you that spell and link that instead. Recipes learned from trainers or game objects there is no way.
---
As far as I know, it's BiS until ZG.
---
Can't exactly base it off of progressing on  challenging bosses.
---
to be fair the lower level you are the less chance you have of seeing a higher level player simply because the higher level player has acces to more areas to play,  also @ 60 majority of play time for most is spent in 5 man/raids which you wont see them in the "world"
---
Yeah, I don't think this was intentional by the guy that invited me, I think he thought a princess run was just any run that killed her.  The issue was the other guy in the party that after I explain the mixup he acts like im in the wrong for leaving before it even started.
---
Are you talking about the joke guild Method that were in mid 40s while Rag died in the race to world first?
---
Have you tried.. now.. hold on don't get mad.. killin stuff?
---
&gt; The slower the better. Sadly swords seem to be on the faster side, but their are some slow ones out there.
---
You're forgetting than at any given time, the odds of a level 60 character being online is higher than a level 40 being online, because the people who already have 60s play a lot more, and therefore are more likely to be online. Even if at one time half the characters logged in are 60, that doesn't mean half the people are 60.
---
Its mostly the OOM part, holy nova is incredibly mana inefficient for damage.
---
do quests that want you to kill stuff.
---
Honestly it makes sense, PVP gear for PVPing, PVE gear for PVE. Really simple concept.
---
It is right next to Kargarth after all
---
Quest in tanaris. The gold you get from quest will get you a mount half way to 41
---
It also heavily depends on your server.
---
On my server, there are like 3 guilds total with Rag/Ony kills. Most of the server isn't even 60 yet. And of those three guilds, one heavily struggles and fills with a lot of pubs. I am fairly positive no pub run has full-cleared MC on my server.
---
Also, even if two guilds have 10/10 1/1 there can be a HUGE difference in clear speed and cleaness of kills.
---
You want to do green quests first. If they turn grey, you will not get full xp ( less xp the higher level you are above the quest)
---
Good to know, thank you
---
We can both try though, eh? :)
---
Seriously? I'm fairly a noob so I've only healed to Mara so far but I've basically never overhealed. Possibly twice. How can someone who is overhealing for 5k considered good?
---
I'd put it closer to 97%. The difference is miniscule for the amounts people are trying to sell it for.
---
My answer:"I thought you were stronger than that. Sorry that you're a little bitch that doesn't have impulse control"
---
My dwarf's name is Silverbeard.
---
"To be without some of the things you want is an indispensable part of happiness."
---
Leveling my shaman as enhancement, but heal in dungeons. 2 handed axe drops, i.e corpsemaker in RFK. Warrior Tank also wants it, as a shaman should i roll need or greed?
---
I am 35 and got like 5 gold, lolz.
---
I'd suggest a druid. They are a lot of fun to level. Both solo and with others. Dungeon healing can be a bit frustrating sometimes. Not because they are not good healer, but because of they lack of utility. Not being able to res or have a way to dispel most negative effects.... hurts sometimes.
---
I wonder if farming the fire elementals in Un‚Äôgoro for Elemental Fire wouldn‚Äôt be worth it. The xp won‚Äôt be great but Elemental Fire was selling for 4g+ last night and I think they have like a 7% drop rate. Depends what you want though, Timbermaw rep plus Firewater and E‚Äôkos might be better. If you want XP, probably the better bet is to start running dungeons for your pre-BiS and doing the associated quests.
---
Rogue sword spec PvP would be "Cold Blood, Hemo Spec"
---
See this is server to server, all you see on Herod at least is brs/scholo/stath/brd been looking for ST as a 60 for 2 weeks and have only seen a handful of STs advertised.
---
I don't like to judge things based on a faulty or inaccurate statement, my experiences are based on stalagg/herod so I am certain that they skew the way I saw this statement in the first place, vs other people on let's say RP servers.
---
If you are with a group of normal people, never be afraid to ask if you can need. Outside of the couple of dumbass and assholes, most people will tell you if it isn't for you. And if it is for your class, most people will agree to let you roll.
---
That was when they started changing gear, it wasnt when they finished
---
Thanks for the insight...sounds like our prices are similar.  20g profit off a transmute is amazing...sounds like i found my easy profit center.
---
The amount of your upvotes speak themselves ;)
---
farm SM and vendor the blues and greens
---
When I am underleveled for a dungeon / running with higher levels I do not get close to the proper XP that I should.  When I'm on level, I find that the XP generation ends up close to what I actually should be getting.  It probably balances out XP/time because you are going faster with the higher level carrying you but getting less, and going slower with a lower group but getting more.
---
Note: I did none of this math, I'm just going with observation.
---
Farm mats, sell them on the AH. I made the bulk of money off of bolts of silk cloth, soul dust, and greater mystic essence.
---
Sell any BoE greens and blues you don't need on the AH. Vendor any item worth more than, say, 70S.
---
It did add some much needed survivability to pvp, and I think it makes some logical sense to differentiate pve/pvp content, but to each their own.
---
Need
---
Definitely not warrior as they are heavily dependant on gear.  Rogues and hunters both can function decently with blue gear.  I'd lean towards hunter though.  If all you're expecting to do end game is tank dungeons, warrior is fine for that though.
---
do you think this guy is sitting there feeling like he got the ebst of you in that exchange? i feel like a lot of these weirdos somehow think their cringeworthy exchanges are sensible and somehow...profound?
---
I commonly go onto subreddits of games I am thinking about trying before I've ever tried them. Can be a decent gauge of the state of the game and whether its worth the time/money.
---
Fuck you blizzard!!
---
You've lost this argument with me lol.  I wash my hands an commit genocide of bacteria.  That are more beneficial to life. But ok. Act like genocide is wrong when you and I do it to species everyday. Species that help us survive... but keep being righteous with the humans above all attitude lol
---
Probably depends whether or not you were able to exploit things like 10 man SM runs or the BRD arena farm before they were fixed. 
---
Either way, being 60 requires a massive time investment and most people probably aren't there yet.
---
Alliance community is nicer in my experience
---
Is this ur alt account or something?
---
Here are the original models to go with those shit stats: https://i.imgur.com/S5BnS3R.png
---
Tier 2 also dropped in MC so some people had a bunch of T2 pieces before BWL was even released. Not sure where to find those stats though.
---
What's my best bet as a casual veteran Warlock that wants to 90% just PVP?
---
I am fine with raiding but I'm not knowledgeable about it and don't want to have to spend too much on a set schedule in a video game
---
Why not both?!
---
sometimes you get a new weapon and have to kill 200 of something
---
How would you argue for devouring plague which is an undead spell and then say you cant fear most rogues cause they are undead? Do you mean for duels?
---
If people aren't dispelling your DP it's not because it's good it's because they are bad.
---
If you want to waste a cd that has an increased chance to crit on a spell that cant crit that can easily be dispelled that's on you. Imagine wasting two cds just to have a paladin use one global cd to erase it. Instead of using almost no mana to add consistent damage, blackout procs, and shadow weaving stacks. Also it shadowguard can cause pushback agasint casters. Scales better with spell damage.
---
Spell that will help you in every fight vs spell that might help you if it doesnt get cleansed and also requires either 20% of your mana or another cd to cast. Pretty easy choice
---
Fun addition to the blocklist
---
I think this is partially correct. I don't think it takes a ton of gold out of the economy, but, it creates a barrier to do dumb stuff on the auction house such as 1c profit margins for thousands of entries.
---
That's where random sampling comes into play.  It evens out a lot of those factors.   It's not about any one time or location, it's about many times at many locations.
---
I mean I got pissed off in Arathi while trying to kill those elementals for the Whirlwind axe. A level 30 had his 2 level 60 buddies tagging and killing everything. 
---
But the only message I sent them was "How many more do you need?"
---
Just continue questing and vendoring junk.  If you have skinning kill beasts and vendor the skins. Cold eye basilisks can drop a trinket so it makes it feel like you aren‚Äôt just wasting time if u wanna grind mobs
---
Negative
---
*sees title, checks picture; scoffs*
---
that ain't the Gelkis Clan, breh
---
If you are open to horde, my guild on Kirtonos sounds perfect for you.  Can give you more details if interested.
---
Question about locks: Considering rolling a lock as an alt, but I've heard bag space is a nightmare for them.  Is this true?
---
Auctionator is you just want an "easy of buying/selling" addon.
---
TSM if you want something highly customizable for fancy queries.
---
&gt;Because what idiot would tank without a helmet?
---
Puny hooman, me orc, my head hard.
---
It was no big deal. All you had to do was stack int to increase your spell damage. You got a whole 1% spell crit for every 100 int!
---
Its not that bad, put some podcast and turn off your brain, I can recommend doing it while listening to GTA talk radio stations like VCPR, Chatterbox, K-Chat etc.
---
Depends on player, some love to have loads of soul shards, me i roll with 3 or 4 at a time and grab as i need. The only time i fill up is before a world pvp, in a huge guild with over 300 on at a time playing so. yeah lots of peeps want in on the raids so i gather 40 to 50 before the meet.
---
This has happened to me since day 1
---
we all get this spam, you report / ignore and move on, no need to post this
---
This is why I'm not playing as much anymore.
---
I've run into too many assholes and it's just tiring.
---
Mage is great if you want to feel like a god for about 9 seconds and then turn into a wet noodle. 
---
In terms of flavor, I think warlock and druid probably have the most class flavor in Classic. Shaman is up there too though. 
---
It comes down to what role do you want to fill? What niche utilities? 
---
Flavor by class:
---
Warlock: Summons, pets for every occasion, easy to find groups on alliance, (arguably) best class quests. Downsides include soul shard farming, pet swapping, and the undead racial (not as big of a deal as people say)
---
Druids: Form shifting, battle res, in-demand heals for raiding / viable offtanks / solid dungeon tanks. Get a port to moonglade.
---
Mages: Can conjure food/water, teleport/portals (people will come up to you and pay you money for these in just about any zone without you needing to advertise at all). Do great damage and have several fun pvp playstyles. Downside is oversaturation so could be hard to find raiding groups (lots of dungeon groups try to bring at least one mage though).
---
Rogues: Again, tons of flavor, good class quests. Poisons/Lockpicking. Great for "hit and run" playstyles, excellent dps. Downsides are that if you get caught offguard in pvp it can be difficult to recover.
---
Shaman: Good class quests as you level, get a self-res which is cool, have a unique elemental/resto hybrid pvp spec which is fun.
---
Alenya and Umbra‚Äôs guide has been really great for me. Recommended by the countdown to classic podcast.
---
I believe TSM can ignore players via the settings.
---
Just block chat channel invites. It's an option in the social section of settings.
---
Was actually tempted lol
---
Well it's not the Goodlands
---
Not hard. Just super slow to solo content without any damage
---
I haven‚Äôt had this issue too much. You definitely wont have as much space as other players who dont need soul shards but I have plenty of space. Once you get big bags no prob. Currently I use my 16 slot soul shard bag for all shards. My other bags are all big 12/14/16 so I always have plenty of space.
---
I heard that engineering is really good for a warlock. Why is that?
---
Well it's not all loot what is left without it?  Virtual kharama from helping run someone through a dungeon after their 3rd time rerolling?  E-hugs for farming gold to help others buy mounts?  Player progress and gear progress are directly tied together.  All that said OP will experience many drouts like this if he sticks with the game.
---
There's specific spots that are good if there is no one there in Steppes, EPL, WPL, DWP. Depending on luck and the AH prices on your server I think it can be more profitable and more fun.
---
All the areas I use have chests and Thorium nodes nearby too.
---
BRD runs are a reliable, boring way to make consistent gold but I can't say I find them to be worth the effort and monotony
---
then stop complaining or flag yourself
---
Uhm how could they forgot Uldum?
---
Having leveled on both sides, I think Horde gets a better quality of life, so long as you don‚Äôt mind the desert landscaper forever.  And Inthink the updated graphics helps with that.
---
Reasons why Inthink they have the better QoL.
---
1) Access to earliest dungeons.  RFC is the lowest level dungeon you can do as early as 12-14 if I recall correctly.  Alliance can‚Äôt do VC until 17.  Also the next dengeon for Alliance is generally stocks unless you want to travel across the world, and Stocks always felt half done.
---
2) Zepplins over Boats.  If you want to be able to get to any starting area as Horde, it‚Äôs a very simple ride on the Zepplins, with a run through barrens if you want to get to Mulgore.  Or a Tauren to Orgrimmar.  15 mins travel.  As Alliance, Darnassas is boat ride, and a run through wetlands, Loch Modan (technically) and then through most of Dun Morgh
---
3) Town development.  As an example STV has one FP for Alliance, Horde has two.  Every zone that has Horde presence has an inn, mail box, and flight path. On Alliance side I can think of 2 zones where Alliance can quest level 30+ but no nearby inn or mail box.
---
4) mid level dungeons, if Horde wants to go to Gnomergan, there‚Äôs a portal, Alliance wants to do SM, prepare to run through level 45+ level areas or swim across s giant lake.
---
They are.
---
If you're cancelling your ties with Blizzard, I would also suggest removing all items made in China that you use.
---
I have two already, and I abuse the post as virtual bank space. Probably spent close to 5g in posting fees alone so far.
---
Just a question about rogues.
---
I've always wanted to play as a Rogue in WoW, but I vastly prefer PvE servers due to limited time constraints with a job (I don't want to have to deal with getting camped or quest NPCs getting killed) and am playing on one (with no plans to switch). I was just wondering how much of the enjoyment or fulfillment of playing a Rogue comes from WPvP or PvP servers in general? The class fantasy of being a nimble and secretive, dual-wielding edgy character always appealed to me, they always looked the best to me when fully geared, and stealth seems like a fun and interesting mechanic to avoid unnecessary mobs. However, when I read posts explaining the rogue or watch videos on rogues, a lot of the emphasis seems to come from your strength in WPvP, so I feel like if I rolled the class I won't be getting the full experience or pros of playing a rogue.
---
So tl;dr I guess I'm just wondering about how fun rogues are on PvE servers and settings? I'd mostly be solo leveling as well FWIW.
---
Bro, you're still doing MC for Rag when Naxx is out.
---
There's no way around it.  No release schedule of Dire Maul or otherwise is going to change that farm content is never exciting.
---
I use a 1 button melee skills macro which also swaps, I think it was BC where auto swapped between ranged and melee.
---
Looks like he got a new rat bashin' stick.
---
He probably won't have SS until level 41 and WW until 30.
---
As for 2hr, if you're experienced then absolutely do it. But for learning, your main goal is keep healer alive, sword and shield is fine for that.
---
After I went 2/5 into that talent in BM that gives chance attack speed increase for pets on crit, I started into the MM tree to get Aimed shot. I think I got aimed shot at like 46 or 47, then I went back into BM. If you do end up respeccing, just get to Aimed Shot and back into BM. Aimed does a lot of damage.
---
It is when they need to generate soul shards.
---
Does anyone know if engineering bombs share a stun DR with rogue's stuns? I'm trying to decide between engineering or leather working for my rogue
---
this. lots of places have volume issues, but it gets exacerbated so easily by people not paying attention, or thinking they are being extra safe by leaving tons of space or not going through yellows...uhg.
---
I laughed recently at a meme that said "man how does traffic even exist, just go" because, well...it's kind of accurate.
---
Lmao 30 down votes because you dared to question the circle jerk
---
Eng's just really good for anyone because of the bombs.
---
People are excited to log in to raid for now, but that won't be the same a year from now. Attrition takes its toll and guilds will need to rely on the fresh 60 players to fill those spots to stay afloat. Especially when you start short-manning MC and have a couple frustrating wipes on stupid shit.
---
It can suck, but honestly it usually just lets me build up even more excitement. If you got your full t1, weapons, and accessory items already, you'd be burnt out on raiding too because there would be nothing to achieve. IMO, the hunt for the gear has always been the strongest and most exciting driving force in raiding, and when it does work out that you get gear, it will be all that more satisfying!
---
it could take months of successful raid farm to get geared up
---
Typical mage
---
Then yeah zero issue. Tons of east coast players are on grob since it's the only big RP-PVP server.
---
Yeah it's very short sighted to just gear the worst players because it's the "biggest upgrade" for them. This is likely a bad loot council philosophy for 99% of guilds.
---
The main goal should be "what is best for the guild/progression".
---
Passing over your best and most dedicated / geared players to give loot to the worst players is not going to be good for the guild, as it's a very quick way to lose your best and most dedicated players.
---
At the very least it provides a terrible incentive to players to have the worst gear, so that they are brought up to the front of the line for upgrades. Why would a guild want to incentivize that? 
---
This could probably work in a guild where players are all top-tier and fighting for raid slots, and are all very close to being equally geared. The guild would need to require players to have at least pre-raid bis to be considered for an upgrade for that item slot.
---
I got into a 7 man and then it fell apart before I got in. I was 100% passed by the people doing the 10 mans, but even in 5 man dungeon grinds It was very fast with a good group. 
---
It took me about 5 days and some change, I did quests I knew were good for xp vs time and I even spent time on things like professions. 
---
Idk what the average time played to 60 is now, ik the old number that was floating around for a very long time was averaged from vanilla and/or pservers.
---
Classic wow FAQ says they are: https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/23090136/world-of-warcraft-classic-faq-what-you-need-to-know
---
I don't know why you seem to think anyone would need an additional reason to fire someone for doing this. I've had to be a part of firing people for doing this, and I don't think you've ever worked for a company that takes policy seriously.
---
&gt; Infact coming in late is probably more beneficial as you'll gear up far quicker due to less competition.
---
Eh.  This is definitely not true, but for different reasons.
---
There's no catchup in this game. Unless you're literal friends with a GM in a guild, and they want to gear you up as dead weight, no one is going to invite you to AQ+ when you are trying to do MC.
---
We'll we're a 15 year old guild that was server firsting in BC and Wrath but yeah I wouldn't put either of those definitions on us.   Our classic guild doesn't have a ton of our old members most of them are new players (new to us not wow) and all our 60s seem committed to helping everyone else level and gear to get to raiding.  Regardless of 60s ditching or not the data is still pretty good.   I was running and uploading with the census addon for Atiesh alliance before blizzard broke them and the 60s were definitely low % and we're a pre-launch server.
---
50 class quests are P5.
---
The gear is easily equivalent to BWL gear, and shouldn't be out this early.
---
I agree with no flying but i really liked outland, why didnt you? I mean i just like the aesthetic of it all, neat area.
---
 Many level 1-10 in stormwind are bank alts for a level 50+ main. They should allow the census app in limited form. Before it was too powerful and I can see why it slowed down things. I could see all the levels and player classes within any guild for example.
---
Do you have a weapon swap macro to switch to shield and 1h?
---
Just rolled an Undead Lock as a running mate to a friend who is playing Hordie. 
---
It is so much fun to level.
---
Since the Warrior can get a WW weapon at Lv30, I think he should really pass it to you.
---
You need to drag the combat tab onto the *actual tab* of the **main chat window tab**. Not just on top of the window.
---
So then someone with a ruined day can go and report everyone because he thinks they're rude.
---
See I would consider those 15 years of 'experience' to actually be a disadvantage
---
There is the Fallen Hero of the Horde questchain that ends in a 16slot bag. As they go for about 20g atm its quite profitable to do so.
---
I‚Äôm into it. Which one?
---
Fewer for a human though, right?
---
They're the most populous too, that is in part why I am wondering.
---
Yes, I spammed it hard for an hour lol
---
This reminds me that i need to turn up my world details setting. I turned it down for leveling in Un'Goro and have since forgot to put it back up.
---
They been kitted before and the world boss there
---
This should be it‚Äôs own post.  Nobody knows this.  I see this question a lot.  Go profit.
---
That's not what I'm talking about at all...  At ANY given sample, the ratio of 60s you see is always going to be higher than the actual number of people who have characters at 60.
---
Give this man an award!
---
You could make the assumption 60 is about 5-10 days played. Settle on 7 and then assume average player gets about 16 hours a week in. So likely about 10 weeks to 60. Game has been out like 8 weeks so my guess is most are approaching 60 but not there yet. All wild ass assumptions but probably not too far off.
---
Chance on hit always means chanxe on hitting with this dagger. For stuff on spells it always says something like "after a spell".
---
If you have an int/spirit set then yes definitely, pretty much up to BRD.
---
Or because you can easily fake screen shots?
---
Edited "incorrect" info.
---
imagine being "stressed" about anything video game related lmao you are a weak person
---
Great idea! Didn‚Äôt know about that. Thank you!
---
&gt; My buddy spent 1,5 weeks casually grinding
---
I am by no means poor rn in game, but that isn't casual lol.
---
As a druid, my main time to shine at 60 is in WSG. That is the one time I can perform a task better than someone else at max rank. I cannot wait for WSG.
---
I‚Äôm following Zygore, but you need to pay for it.
---
Farm at the Kurzen Camp in STV. In particular the area with the elites (and i think witchdoctors) in the cave.
---
Are you on Grobb?
---
BC and WotLK didn't really bother me at first, since they left the original world untouched at least. BC started to piss me off with the introduction of dailies, and then WotLK went full retard with the LFG tool. If they can manage to do expansions without introducing those game-killing mechanics I'm all for it.
---
Lol. It makes them feel good.
---
They could have every piece of content put right now and you can still be casual.
---
Maybe it could hide search results for items listed by a certain player, but it could in no way prevent a particular player from bidding/buying your listing.
---
Gray quests are 7+ levels below you. So if you are in the final push I'm guessing you're 59 so --&gt; 52 and lower are grey
---
We had it bugged once too. The trick is to keep as close to the well as possible at all times. We did it in less than 10 min.
---
No, but holding content back gives more to look forward to. Plus, doing MC with BWL gear makes MC easier, and so on. They are separating the raids with time for a reason, it‚Äôs not retail mentality to want good pacing with content, and the person you replied to didn‚Äôt say a word to imply that the content becomes irrelevant. Rather, it becomes less enjoyable when it‚Äôs not the cutting edge content. I‚Äôd agree, MC is undoubtably more enjoyable now than when you‚Äôre running it with Naxx gear.
---
You‚Äôre so far behind the curve it doesn‚Äôt really matter which one you choose, but armorsmithing is the most useful, followed by axe (but still not very useful).
---
TBC is BC continued
---
Killing beasts and/or badlands rock elementals seems to be the best bet for grinding levels and making cash
---
I run an addon that takes a census of everyone on the server, periodically, while I play.
---
On my server, the bulk of the population is just now getting into their 40's.  About 70'ish percent.  maybe 15% is 50+.  and out of that 15%, maybe 6% or 7% is at 60.
---
It‚Äôs comparable to RoVP and those drop like crazy off the flame guards in MC.
---
Is the Staff of Jordan any good?
---
Ah this was lost on me (them being the reward!) and it sucks to know that Junkboxes Needed can only be done @ 60. I'm lvl 37 and Friendly, and was wondering how--if at all--I could benefit from this lol.
---
Yes! Thanks
---
Uh, sure it does.  When fights take 3x as long as it does with geared raids, you have to mess around with mechanic and damage for much longer.
---
Baller alert!
---
Fallen Hero of the Horde chain that starts just south of Stonard in Swamp of Sorrows. MASSIVE chain that starts at 45 and ends at 60 so you might not have grabbed it.
---
Hunter discord suggests:
---
Rank 4: fire and shadow res
---
Rank 2: arcane res
---
Rank 1: nature res
---
Focus dump 1&amp;2
---
Dash
---
Stam rank 4
---
Even with all that it‚Äôs hard to get healers to care about pets, and sometimes they just die anyways

Because the people with the PvP mentality (ganking, fighting, powergaming, edgy style, competitiveness) tend to identify more with the Horde. There are also some great racial abilities for Horde (notably Will of the Forsaken, Devouring Plague, and orc stun resist). Alliance has some great racials too, like Stoneform, Fear Ward, and Perception, but I think Horde racials are in the minds of more players. People without the PvP mentality (fair fights, PvE content, more interested in aethetics/social aspects/questing) tend to gravitate towards the Alliance. That doesn't apply to most players, but 5-10% is enough to skew the servers. It starts a snowball effect that causes Alliance players to gradually lose ground until it reaches critical mass. I'm not sure about the current servers, but historically there were plenty that were Alliance dominated. Then the problem happens in reverse. Really it's a matter of trying to keep populations balanced. Anything skewed beyond 45/55 and people start to jump ship when they're getting camped all the time and people aren't so quick to help. Especially in areas with heavy WPvP, like Tarren Mill/Southshore and Splintertree/Astranaar, that 10% difference can mean fights go 2 to 1 because the people PvPing at the time might be 5% of the Horde and 3% of the Alliance. The problem compounds, because the Alliance know they have less population and in a week it'll only be 2% at Southshore. Then it's a steamroll and Hillsbrad becomes a KoS zone for Alliance. Once zones become that hostile (instead of random ganking either way), people start fleeing the server.
---
Where‚Äôs ginger beard ?
---
Depend on the server.  If you're in a low pop PvE server a traditional non frostbite aoe build might work fine, but my experience on Herod (high pop PvP) was that I lost a lot of efficiency with overcrowd camps and getting attacked. 
---
Instead I went single target with a value point I'm blizzard, and went 100% frost Al the way to 60.  100% no regrets.  I could grind mobs, quest, dungeon group, and group spell cleave.  The only thing I couldn't do was solo open world aoe.
---
The fastest exp/hr is going to be with a talented aoe spell cleave dungeon group but I don't think it's worth waiting an hour to find the perfect group.  I'd recommend to go back and forth between dungeons (try to find spell cleave but don't hesitate to join a "normal" group). 
---
Try to quest/solo around the dungeon for your level so you can lfg while you grind/quest and you'll fly in levels.
---
I mean it is probably a ton easier to release than even classic. Outlands havent been reworked, they have all the spawn locations and shit.
---
I did it as Combat at first. It works fine but it‚Äôs a lot slower for obvious reasons. Now I prefer to respec to Sub and just grind for 10 hours straight till I have 500g and then respec back to Combat. I do this every couple of weeks.
---
Yeah its so much better to say LF1M tank for several hours, compared to having a menu that shows groups and being able to join and organize that way. THE ACT OF SAYING LF1M IN CHAT SPECIFICALLY IS BETTER. CAN YOU EXPLAIN THIS? THIS SPECIFIC ACT? NO YOU CAN NOT. YOU FUCKING IDIOTS I CANT EVEN TALK TO YOU
---
Show evidence that bear out tps warrior in current gear.
---
We have a full bis TPS gear bear and he does not beat the tps of a dual wielding fury tank in hit capped gear.
---
Everyone points to taladrils testing as evidence that bears beat warriors. But look at the scuffed ass prebis he used to sim warrior threat.
---
Also, MC is a joke. You can DW tank it easily. There are tanks wearing truestrike shoulders in MC its so easy.
---
Pristine black diamonds, larval acids, essence of water will all see a significant spike.  The PSBs were at 7-8g each on my server and jumped instantly to 40g when the DM announcement happened.
---
So OP is on whitemane, and I think i know the guild. I've actually had credible sources tell me they required a weekly payment of 25g in order to get rolls in raid.
---
You should show the back of your head on the left side.
---
Is there gear that is solely based on PVP and not raid related? I dont want to only heal as a level 60.
---
Warrior, druid, paladin, shaman, hunter pet, warlock pet.
---
Not sure on the 7th
---
When it comes to world pvp, nothing beats the feeling of stalking your prey ad a rog
---
Yes, but only one of those is a dedicated threat generator (Sunder Armor). So the only reason Thunderclap would gain extra threat over rank 1 is because it would do more damage, but it's still not a great threat generator. Demoralizing Shout, I'm not entirely sure how it's threat is calculated honestly.
---
only gambling for real money.
---
I sometimes keyboard turn because i dont feel like always having my hand on my mouse
---
This is an example of a special type of stupid person
---
&gt; You know, I want to say 'just let the dps-ers die'
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; But - as a war tank - i don't do that. I still think I need to pick up everything despite the dps. Although i will grumble irl.
---
Both you and your healer need to understand that DPS aggro is fundamentally not your problem in Classic.
---
I deleted everything on my main character that I played on for 250+ hours

You're never at a disadvantage to see more, that's just bogus.

Refresh rate is a different matter altogether - 144 over 60 will be better regardless of resolution.

All they need now is a Bluebeard to sell them a guild tabard...

No need, plenty of youtubers have already addressed this topic adequately.

The people watching YouTube already agree with you, convincing the general public.. you have to prove it to them

There are two kinds of players - people who go "oh I'm out of new content, guess I'll quit" and people who go "they added *more* shit I have to do? fuck it I'm out."

And I've realized I'm the latter.

People shouldn‚Äôt worry about the color of the gear. A lot of purple loot is dogshit, especially pvp gear.
---
Now if it was a full set of bis gear, then be concerned.
---
Is that a Wyrmthalak trinket? Jealous.
---
&gt; Then everyone is a hypocrite, including you. Unless of course you support slavery and ethnic cleansing. 
---
Oh,  definitely turn the other eye.  No doubt about that.  I value my inexpensive luxuries and conveniences over the well-being of the people in China, no doubt about that either.  The difference between us is I'm not pretending to be some paragon of justice here by chastising Blizzard for wanting to protect their business interests in China.
---
&gt; Driving a low emmision car every once in a while doesn't make you a hypocrite when fight for the environment.
---
That's not the moral equivalent of what you're doing.  What you're doing is the equivalent of driving a Suburban to a climate change rally.
---
There's nothing wrong with driving a Suburban, just don't try and act like you're an environmentalist whilst doing so.
---
'Nuff said.  Muting this.

The mods literally stated they were breaking these rules because it was relevant and left the main post up.

A year later in life and you still can‚Äôt press the print screen button. Un-fucking-believable.

I was doing SM lib for guildies the other day, it was very easy and I definitely coulda gone higher. Maybe I will try arm or cath later today.
---
You cannot receive a class-specific mount without being in that class.
---
I mean yes, but there are many full servers. Easily 8-12 also full servers on top of the original 4.
---
So while the original far are more popular, the proportion of the populations in other servers still vastly outweighs them.

Even without the psychology element, it might just simply be a seller doesn‚Äôt know what the right price is and doesn‚Äôt want to lose control if they set that starting price to low.

Your argument is stupid right there. In real life me and 4 friends don‚Äôt together to kill everyone and everything in a dungeon in hopes of finding stuff to sell on eBay

I got all materials weeks ago already, because I was expecting prices to go higher as soon as DM is released ... you should prolly try and get them now because next week they will most likely be even more expensive.

Hey now, you have the freedom to say whatever you want....as long as it doesn‚Äôt make the Chinese government look bad

To be fair, most people dont understand how warriors tank either.
---
Or at least it seems that way, judging by the number of people that spam aoe from the get go, and the priests who spam PW:S on me nonstop.

I can't get over the way male dwarfs run like they just shit their pantaloons

Wands are just buggy right now.  Spam drain soul.
---
12k upvotes, nice! The players have spoken :)

&gt;Turn off auto-loot, check the boxes for anything valuable and leave a single item in the box
---
This is unbelievably important. Thank you so much!
---
Also, where specifically do I turn them in in Ravenholdt Manor? When i got to Friendly i didnt see any more quests.
---
There would be less people watching. Also read the rule he broke, because it's so generic they can do it to anyone.
---
I think alternate expansions are fine. It goes without saying that there is a clear difference in design philosophies between Classic and modern WoW, so expanding the Classic part of the game under a different set of philosophies could be interesting and probably quite successful
---
Mate I have 75 gold and I'm level 45. I ain't getting shit.
---
True.  I dont mind new content.  I enjoyed BWL and Naxx when they came out but i couldnt wrap my head around TBC, it was just TOO different for me.  Flying mounts ruined it too.  It also made all of those old raids pointless.
---
I took a week off and pushed through it, was really easy imo. I was on the most populous server too so queue dodging was a thing, and I was fked by the initial login by being DC'd and put in a 7h queue. 
---
Since the 2nd week, I have worked every weekday 9-5 (1 holiday I think), I got 1-3h queues the entire 2nd-4th weeks and only really play about 2-5h a night depending on if I have to stay awake a bit longer for my raid. 
---
I think I may be overestimating the average person's efficiency.
---
Can you not survive in the vacuum of space with just a mechanical eye and sick top-not?
---
I mean there‚Äôs a difference between giving people shitty jobs that would otherwise have nothing vs blatantly trying to squash a freedom movement in favor of fascists. But I don‚Äôt blame you for playing the game, it‚Äôs fantastic obviously lol.
---
Why is it stupid?  Because Mr. Cognitive Dissonance here on Reddit says so?
---
You're a hypocrite and you know it.  Muted.
---
Always agility, because agility is also mitigation
---
Does it really sound like he says der to you?
---
Yeah but if you are in shadowform you can't cast fear ward, which means you lose the best part of being a dwarf priest.
---
Also, I respec'd to a split build around 54 so that I could start gathering pre-bis stuff from BRD/Strat/Scholo while leveling. The solo time went up just a little bit (but honestly not much) and you can actually heal the hard 5 mans. [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bVRhsV0oZbxxccbVZx](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bVRhsV0oZbxxccbVZx)
---
If you go that route, I'd get the wand spec and spirit tap first, obviously. Then go down holy to get the 5/5 spiritual guidance. This helps a TON with getting a boost in +healing while you are gearing up and the +damage helps for the solo smiting too. Then you'd finish out in disc. It sucks that you can't get spirit buff pre-60 with this spec but it lets you heal everything and still solo almost as well as shadow priest.
---
I planned on keeping that spec at 60 for farming and raiding but now that DM is coming out, I'll end up respecing at 60 to pick up holy nova and drop spirit tap since I can probably go ahead and get all my farming needs from lashers in DM:East. And also dropping the smite damage. Maybe this? [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bqMhsVVqobxtcc](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bqMhsVVqobxtcc)
---
Not really. You don't have to convince everyone to do it. Plenty will for fun, others for the gear they want, etc.

This is totally true I just wish we had a real rez.

Ah, the so called "free mount" promoted by countless self-proclaimed vanilla experts on reddit before Classic launch.
---
does you server not have rogues? Are you a pve server?
---
Nah, it's close to 100%, bosses don't have time to kill your pet.
---
What about the unholy deathknights doing insane 200-500kdps on big trash pulls? They can also upwards of 1million dps on large pulls.
---
There's a few quests in the Plaguelands that give UC rep but other than that there's nothing.
---
So they‚Äôre frost... but add shadow damage? Neat. I like em
---
The rules are there are no rules unless agreed to earlier.
---
Yeah dude. Look at some of the (actual) world first videos from vanilla. The best guilds in the world playing at 15fps.
---
If you need it for your profession, then need it. Otherwise greed.
---
&gt; I am sure that Blizzard are watching progress of players carefully and will balance the release of content to hit the sweet spot of the player base.

I sell only the finest goods.

I'm sorry,  have you seen the Titanforging, group finder, mission tables, and ezmode content of Retail?
---
What is the most versatile class for hardcore solo farming? Farming dungeons, elites, etc. Rogues and druids can stealth to interesting spots. Warlocks and hunters have pets which opens up a lot of opportunities. Hunters have feign death shenanigans that can help them skip past things. Mages have pure power, AoE and can kite well. I am leaning towards a hunter to be paired with engineering but am curious what other people think.
---
Fuck off already.
---
Always at ah scanning and posting/reposting

&gt; I took a week off and pushed through it, was really easy imo.

That's certainly a big part of it.

I think you can also safely say most people didn't take off and log 8+ hour days.

Is there a way for me to display both the threat and damage meters of my Details addon? If not, are there any good alternatives you guys could recommend?

Which spec / what talents are viable for leveling a warrior that would like to tank some dungeons occasionally? I read wowhead warrior leveling guide but they never mention tanking while leveling and only suggest arms/fury.
---
I never played warrior, but tanked in WotLK/Cata on alt casually.
---
Oh nah. Anselm was the name of my character in a 5e campaign. Decided to port him into Grobbulus as a priest :D
---
But now that you‚Äôve mentioned him I am interested in knowing more. Do you have a link to a Wikipedia article or something where I can read up?
---
Thanks. Thunderclap makes sense since it deals more damage.
---
Wasn't sure on sunder armor mainly, since it does 0 damage
---
As someone who hasn‚Äôt got over level 40 because constant rerolling, I relate.
---
Herbs/Ores.
---
Especially herbs related to current raiding (mountain silversage/dreamfoil)
---
It took away a lot of the race identity, and they have flat out stated already it would never happen.
---
Another reason for belfs was to give the Horde a less monstery race to get people (specifically in Korea) to play Horde.
---
I'm pretty sure that was a joke. I'm hoping it was at least.
---
Yip. Vanilla guilds raided Karazhan in T3

Also, want to know how it feels not to get loot for weeks/months? Play EQ back in it‚Äôs hey day.

You can tank warrior as any spec in dungeons.
---
Need it if you do. That‚Äôs it. Need on all blue and purple boe and that‚Äôs it.
---
Didn‚Äôt you hear that the Hong Kong government will take reddit karma as a method of payment to stop beating the shitting out of their citizens. That‚Äôs why Mercarher gotta farm his karma up with this post
---
Currently, yes. But as you get further into the tiers, the expectation of you actually *fully* contributing rises. If you‚Äôre too lazy to spend even a modicum of time farming to make/buy consumables, you‚Äôre just a selfish ass wasting 39+ other people‚Äôs time.
---
Teeeeeechnically, there are item levels.  Not visible to the player without looking at data, but they've always existed :P

the downvotes might not change your mind but enjoy them none the less
---
Interestingly, I turned in a grey quest the other day and still got a reasonable amount of XP for it. I think that if some of the mobs for the quest are still green to you, you may get xp for the quest.
---
Your point makes perfect sense, but I‚Äôll still dream
---
Uh no, the free mount is the level 40 one which all you have to do is literally click 2 buttons, and neither require mount training. Sorry to ruin your gotcha moment ü§£.
---
BM is wonderful for PvE. The problem is, in PvP, a smart caster will deadzone you. All you really get out of BM to counter this is a stun on a 1 min CD.
---
The best counter to deadzone tactics is to spec MM for scatter shot.
---
While that's true, there's also the other effect of inflated egos thinking classic is harder than it actually is and proclaiming that it is not a game for casuals, as if the simpler mechanics at max level aren't plain to see.
---
Both fill the same role, DPS.  Both have the same issue accordingly.  Play whichever suits you

You pick a tank then.
---
I did the same thing. Got my Tauren hunter to 33 then realized I have always been a warrior so I rerolled. I‚Äôm level 47 on the warrior now and am glad I made the switch. My only regret is that I wish I did it from the start.
---
However, the benefit was that I had about 30g in the hunter so I was able to afford my mount right at 40 on the warrior and was able to buy the quest items for my WW axe immediately. So it ended up being alright
---
Iam taking the tank roll to support my friends, and they are interested in it, not saying it‚Äôs 100% of the time, they just want a tank friend. And to not have to look for random tanks.
---
Yep, biased information is still biased information.  And it's impossible to deal 1500dps in classic without buff/debuffs modifiers even with Naxx gear.  The top limit theoretical perfect rotation dps is something like 1100 for fury warriors.  I don't remember the exact number and it's in pure damage build.  Literally not possible, but once again believe what you want, even a 1500 dps lie.
---
Here's what I would do:  
---
1) Break the loot treadmill. The gear you have shouldn't be the primary factor in determining the gear you have access to. I would make the difficulty of higher tiers scale faster than the loot can compensate for so to get better gear your raid has to be more skilled. With such a system there would be a hardest possible difficulty and best obtainable loot.  
---
2) Make sure the best obtainable loot is also the strongest possible loot that is still fun to play against. This means they wouldn't reach the point of "gamebreaking loot" because such loot would require the completion of impossible (and nonexistent) content. If Naxx loot is already too close to that maximum then I would be fine with a one-time nerf to Naxx loot for the sake of the game's longevity.  
---
3) Introduce new content where the players are. If most players are currently doing Tier 3 content then introduce a new Tier 3 or 3.5 raid. If only a small number of players are doing Tier 5 content you can still give them new content but it would probably be better to give them a one-boss raid or an especially difficult secret boss in an otherwise lower tier raid. A full 10-boss raid for such a small number of players seems a little overkill.
---
Gtfo- posted it from my cell phone at work and it was the only one I had on me because the screenshot is on my rig at home...
---
Tf is the point of them even being killable then..
---
If I respec sub for the farm, what's the best spec/weapon style for killing the bosses?
---
Look at the mats for the new epic patterns.  Essences, larval acid, etc.
---
New epic mount quests.  Specifically looking at the Warlocks-- Black Dragonscales, Ghost Mushrooms, Large Brilliants.
---
Pristine Diamonds become useful, and will likely go up from whatever they are now to ~40g.
---
No one is saying that Maraudon or Dire Maul are bad for the game, but Dire Maul is going to have a much larger impact on the economy than Maraudon does and a lot of people are just simply not prepared for that impact since they were assuming that DM was another 1-2 months out.
---
Also the people most affected by the incoming inflation are going to be the people still leveling up, so I can understand being a bit annoyed about an update which doesn't offer anything that you can take advantage of immediately but will make the economy a bit more challenging.
---
On the same account no, if you try to log in from another instance of WoW it will disconnect the first one. You need two subscriptions (which can be tied to the same b.net account), or another player to run you.
---
Otherwise yeah it totally works.
---
Cows are a manly race? Lawl
---
Would add fury warriors to that list.
---
Sounds like the perfect time to invest
---
They will have lots of value next Tuesday.  Every raider is going to need at least 2 of them.

Both are easy, warlock is probably easier although hunter is faster to level

Rogue telling me to invest, logically that somehow seems like a bad idea.
---
There are. Not as many as inside the hives, but they are there. Rogues out here making bank on thorium though!
---
NeatPlates or ThreatPlates
---
Which is how it would work regardless of the release of DM.   The more people play the more gold is put into the economy.  It's not a good argument against it.
---
So, your hit cap is reduced to 6% with the first 5 weapon skill, then reduced by 0.1% for each point thereafter. Therefore, with the OEB, your hit cap is 5.7%. Practically, this is the same as 6%, as other than with weapon skill there are no ways to get non-whole number hit percentages.
---
On the bright side, weapon skill also reduces the chance the target will dodge by 0.1% per weapon skill (total of 0.8% for the OEB). So that's nearly a whole % of hit that you otherwise cannot obtain.
---
It isn't a joke my man
---
What are you missing?

Yikes
---
I am torn between a Mage and a Warlock. They are so similar and so different at the same time.
---
Warlocks can always SS someone and pass out candy.
---
Mages can do more later, as they can remove Curses and kite.
---
Warlocks don't get hit, but do get big numbers on the screen, along with big threat.
---
Mages do get 6% hit for 3 talent points and have reduced threat.
---
Warlocks get free normal mounts and a epic mount quest and can summon.  
---
Mages also get to ignore Azeroth's crap public transit system and teleport or even make portals to various cities. 10s and some mana and you effectively have a second Hearthstone.
---
Warlocks can turn life into mana, then hit a lock rock or Drain Life. 
---
Mages can crank out bread and water like a mofo.  
---
Warlocks can use the classic Drakedog strategy of Seduction, CoE, and Soul Fire.
---
Mages can do something similar with Polymorph and Pyroblast. Mages can then follow with a PoMPyro.
---
Warlocks can do princess runs. 
---
Mages can visit Waifumane and farm her, the guy she told you not to worry about, and their trash.
---
Both are available to Undead, so WotF is there.
---
Both are ranged, so no worries about trying to be close enough to hit the boss.
---
Both have meh tier sets and can make their own gear.
---
The big difference, as I see it:
---
Warlocks have pets. I'm all for a personal Succubus (who isnt?), Curse of Doom turning a crappy level 10 mob into a big, pissed, Doomguard, and summoning people to their doom. I can't wait for the AQ40 quest so I can summon to fatigue island.
---
Mages, OTOH, can Ice Block and lol off raid mechanics.
---
&gt;  jump from Naxx to AQ 
---
wut?
---
You cannot block or parry as a priest. +defense doesnt help against hunters or casters. It‚Äôs borderline useless to you.
---
Actually it does affect them in multiple ways.
---
One positive being those who are not raid ready have more pre raid bis for them to get.
---
&gt; how can i change my pet?
---
Look for a stablemaster in your home city.  You get three slots to "store" pets. The first slot is free.
---
You can abandon your pet as well, but you'll lose it.
---
&gt; Also does the pet level up ?
---
It'll level up as you level up.
---
Check out stalag. High pop eastern server. Healthy pvp server. I got 2 60s there and actually leveling an alliance toon on smolderweb since my IRL friend decided to level there lol.
---
Wanna buy a lamp?
---
How dare you waste your life mining at 10am! I wanted to do that!
---
Uh, no. If they paid the price of the bid, then yes. They‚Äôre paying the deposit, which can range from minor inconvenience to 0.

---
Caster and melee have different mechanics. Try then both, pick a side.
---
Hahahahaha
---
Well, just keep in mind there's a ton of mages at 60 to roll against for gear. Ide pick something else unless you really enjoy the class
---
Wanna buy some death sticks?
---
Priests should do really well AOE farming the lashers in DM.
---
Good looking out .  Actually picked up the gorewood bow last night so I am full on a stack of arrows.
---
So, you're boycotting Blizzard for not ending their business relations with China, but still use a PC and smartphone with Chinese made parts in them?
---
Isn't it a tiny bit hypocritical of you to expect a for-profit company to do something that you aren't willing to do yourself?
---
There is a Stable Master that lets you store up to two spare pets. They can be found outside most inns. Pets level up and have their own xp bar. Low pets you gotta grind with them a bit to catch up to your level. They typically don't lag behind you by more than 1 level once they're caught up to you.
---
Fuck I miss Vampiric Touch.
---
Sounds like fun.
---
I'm running this guide and I'm enjoying it quite a bit.
---
maybe for example on a 12 hour auction you can cancel for 6 hours or something
---
nothing covered in retail would be used in classic +
---
In vanilla we had a closed bid system where the winning bidder would pay the second highest bid (or a minimum amount).  That prevented disenchanting upgrades because people always had an incentive to bid just above the minimum.
---
The reward is the rage and tears of the player.
---
Fuck you
---
They pay the loss of the bid+ deposit
---
Have never noticed it.. Will look for it tonight, thanks!
---
That's called Narcissistic personality disorder.
---
&gt;Right on, dudeski. I support any playstyle that doesn't sink a group's ability to clear content, and while I'm totally aware that my setup needs a lot of work, I have this dream where I don't get mansplained to for days in a joke post.
---
And it will be for some time.  I think it was around 1000g when I got mine in vanilla.  But that was after aq was released so the economy had some time to inflate.
---
How does a 25.1 minority hold the power? If 74% vote against them nothing they say matters.
---
At the end of the day, Blizzard made a financial decision.
---
You, on the other hand, made a pathetic decision.
---
Seriously wtf is wrong with people?! I almost refuse to believe someone can be this toxic.
---
Used to do this on spriest. Soloing is a bliss. Generally don't get invited to raids tho.
---
Im 60 - I was in between contracts and banged out a 60 Rogue and a 42 druid. The druid feels meh so I think my real alt is going to be a warrior. I want to be able to group without having spending so much time finding a damn tank. The second level through I am going to read all the quest text too.
---
I wanna be the very best.
---
you can right click dismiss your (you will lose this pet forever though) or you can go to a stable master and store your pet there for future use.
---
So as long as you don't have pet available you should be able to tame another one.
---
Warrior (if you can't/won't tank), rogue, mage, lock, hunter.
---
Maybe (1 max, if that)...shadow priest, feral druid.
---
No...boomkin, ret paladin, other meme specs.
---
&gt;PvP you likely want to pick up Holy Shock
---
My thoughts exactly.  Holy Shock seems like an absolute necessity honestly.  I haven't used it before, but I can't imagine passing up on an instant heal - even if it's inefficient overall.  Just another "oh shit!" button :P
---
Honestly, this other poster was kind of being a dick about it but he has a point. I've seen a lot of people in this sub posting about how they "have a job and a life" etc etc. That's OKAY, but you've got to realize the pacing of the game doesn't revolve around that. There's A LOT of people like me who have been 60 for weeks now and cleared mc/ony multiple times.   
---
We're lacking any real meaningful systems outside of raids like honor/BG so that means in the downtime between raid night we're literally just running around farming gold, or bashing our brains into the wall grinding stuff like felwood rep.   
---
Content in classic doesn't become irrelevant in the new patch like it does in retail. Take your time and level, thats cool, MC will still be there for you and offer you decent upgrades. However, don't expect to hold others back with you.   
---
Imagine if we seriously waited for all the "people with jobs" to hit 60 and get some MC gear. We wouldn't even hit phase 2 until first quarter next year and phase 2 doesn't even bring a new raid. With the pace some of the casual players are talking they don't want to see BWL until like June of next year.   
---
With timelines like that, a ton of people will leave classic and go do something else. You can only expect people to grind prebis and 1 raid for so long before it becomes boring, especially when theres no honor or battlegrounds.
---
Shouldn‚Äôt you be doing something other than ranting over a 5 word sentence that could have been ended by ‚Äúnah‚Äù and then responded with an ‚Äúaight‚Äù?
---
Besides, the act of standing up to an authoritarian dictatorship is sexy enough without anything lewd.
---
I've had an issue where my character nameplate keeps resetting to the default position in the top left. The enemy name plate stays where I moved it, but not my own. I've exited the game correctly several times after resetting to my desired position, but nothing seems to work. Very annoying.
---
Disable any overlay you're using. Be it Nvidia, discord or some other overlay, those things cause issues.
---
Arcane crystals and black lotus, always. Raiders will always pay at least market value for these.
---
Starting in phase 2 there will be honor gear available. But it's slightly less good than the gear you get from raids.
---
This is fantastic
---
Sword of Omen
---
Thrasher
---
And the sword from the BFD quest
---
Are all super important :)
---
Alliance are equally dicks, I can't count the number of corpse runs i've had to get into BRD. Based on the actions of these alliance, my guild has collectively decided that any and all alliance are KoS, grey or not.
---
 You sir, are a scholar and a gentleman.
---
It doesn't, that's what i just said mate.
---
So is this based on pre-nerf? 
---
Because at least for the warlock mount it can vary from 1-3 Arcanite bars, 2-10 Shadow elixirs, and 3-35 Black Dragonscales. 
---
We have no ideas ourselves which it will be so we are preparing for the worst, but it could be the best case.
---
You basically have a slightly worse version of [this (Krol Blade)](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=2244/krol-blade). I'd check prices for that and price accordingly. From there, I have no idea what % of the Krol's price I'd use.
---
OMG congrats! The legendary Tauren Horseman exists!
---
What server?!
---
I believe i have that addon.  Cant check it now. At work.
---
Alliance!
---
That's literally the argument on Runescape. People dont really go to the wilderness to fight eachother, they go their to fuck with the naked clue scroll hunters and hope they drop loot. Literally no reward except for a spade for 90% of the time besides the lulz and then maybe youll get lucky and find an idiot that didnt tele after looting the clue. So mainly people just kill people for the luls. Theres no reason for 60s to be in some areas yet there they were killing me at 15..idk, you dont want to have people fucking with you play pve..
---
It's going to go on everything blizzard or Activision. Honestly, it should be everywhere on Reddit. China is a still a totalitarian government and the people of Hong Kong is fighting for their freedom. This is Free Tibat all over again.
---
I think they should assume most people play 10-15 hours a week, which means it'll take 4-6 months to hit 60.
---
I haven't had a single person say no when I asked for help in this game. I'm hoping to return the favor someday, but nobody ever asks me for help lol
---
Did I miss something? Why boycott blizz?
---
Where are you making this shit up? Theoretocal limits based on what? Where is this bullshit coming from ? We found out like 2 weeks ago that bosses have less than 2.5k armor in classic.  There are new mechanics in classic. Heroic strike doesnt eat flurry charges. Heroic strike being queued makes your off hand not suffer the Dual Wield miss penalty, absolute massive buff for DW warrior. 
---
Off hand used to have 24% miss for orcs, with HS queuing it has 6%.
---
There are multiple 1500+ dps parses on warcraft logs. You cant argue with that.
---
Learn to say no.
---
I play my dwarf on DD and on that server were in all dwarf gnome guild called clan winterforge.
---
That‚Äôs fucked up
---
Are you saying this is the wrong guy to talk to? He is artisan tailor and I am trying to train expert. Doesnt show one the expert guy either
---
If you're trying to level weapon skill, there are some mobs in Blasted Lands that go immune around 20% hp and stay that way until you click a crystal near them. Also, warlock elemental banish is useful. 
---
If you're trying to figure out rotations, then I got nothing.
---
Have you gone to the artisan trainer in undercity? You have to get artisan to go higher than 150
---
 /run C\_Timer.After(3,function() SetCVar("autoLootDefault",0) end) 
---
Curious why do you have that set to 0? When I tried this macro, it wouldn't function until I swapped it for 1.
---
It was no problem at all for me and I'm on my first character.  There were people grinding the Trolls for an STV quest, bored people leveling their mining to help me with the Elementals and a 60 that didn't mind spending 5 minutes to help me with the RFK part
---
Trainers are divided into three categories, apprentice, journeyman, and artisan. Apprentice can train up to 75, journeyman up to 150, and artisan the rest of way.
---
As a tank, sometimes it's more challenge/fun to let the DPS attack whatever but tank it anyway. Of course it's messy. But fun.
---
BiS rave trinket*
---
How do you help then? Please tell me what you are doing to help?
---
The BFD sword you are referring to is called the Vanquisher‚Äôs Sword and can be obtain by completing the quest Bring the End (Horde) with a required level of 37 or Bring the Light (Alliance) with a required level of 39. ^^
---
I recommend grabbing this particular sword as well as the Sword of Omen as soon as possible!
---
 It is ridiculous that a person who supports the power of bloody oligarchs speaks about human rights. The human right to die seems to mean you.  It‚Äôs good for you to live on the money that you get from someone else‚Äôs poverty.

---
I've been listening since Classic came out and it's a really nice podcast. You obviously do a lot of work on it and it's appreciated.
---
You can run deadmines repeatedly, but it's not going to really accelerate your leveling speed.  I'd say only do dungeon grinds if you get a good grinding group, or you just find dungeons to be the most fun option for play.
---
You can dw right away, but it comes with an inherently lower hit chance.  For effectiveness, you're better off using a 2h than dw.  That said, the drop in accuracy isn't crippling, just enough to make 2h the clear optimal choice until you can stack hit chance.
---
Because it's easier to overheal when your heals are bigger, and you have 2 heals in a run of 10 people. Pre60 it's hard to overheal.
---
I don't know, but there are people on this thread complaining about how everyone on reddit seems to only care about raid content and there are people in the same thread complaining about how everyone on reddit only cares about being super casual.  Both use examples of them being downvoted as proof and my comment is mostly an observation on those complaints. 
---
I agree with you, not voting about stuff you don't care about is generally best. I know I used to be pretty guilty of just downvoting everything I disagreed with.
---
The artisan guy is in the picture
---
When you first click him he should tell you who can train you (before you hit the train me button)
---
Where are your shooting babies in fishing nets spots ? asking for a friend \^\_\^

It's funny you mention it, everyone is, only seriously mentally ill people play MMO's,
---
Update: Game working when windowed, but not fullscreen. Will play on windowed.
---
See I didn‚Äôt have a problem with damage mitigation at all until BRD. At no point was my issue dying or taking too much damage. It‚Äôs all about holding aggro in the early levels. I personally would recommend 2h for early dungeons. 2h=more damage=more threat.
---
Starting in 2 days. Never played WoW before.
---
So far what I plan: Normal realm, Undead Heal Priest.
---
Give me one advice. Or to be a question: 'What is one, random advice about anything that you would give a totally fresh player?'
---
People like you are the worst. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt do this good thing because this bad thing also exists.‚Äù
---
You‚Äôre so insecure about the shitty person you are that you literally live in a defeatist fantasy world where you can‚Äôt possibly make any difference so you don‚Äôt have to try. That‚Äôs so juvenile.
---
I still want a disc tank. Like I love how they adjusted disc in retail to be a damaging healer but, imagine walking up to ragnaros benediction in hand smacking him across the face.
---
U mad that the gnome can escape artist out of your frost shock.
---
Did they change spawn rates on less populated areas or is it still crap unless you are in a town?
---
He says: "good! now I know my efforts will not be wasted!" -.-
---
Indeed.  But they don't get to shake their tiny fists on the internet by going to see a movie.  Posting their outrage online satisfies much more readily. And is just as effective as doing nothing, since China's influence is large and a few people cancelling is mostly meaningless.
---
What lv are you?? I think you have to be 20 to get artisan
---
I'm just curious what you did to support the citizens of Hong Kong prior to the Hearthstone incident?
---
Seems to me like everyone is just jumping on the bandwagon now because it's the cool thing to do. When at the end of the day we all know very few people are actually quitting/boycotting.
---
You need to tell your group not to aoe and only go after marker targets
---
Gah yes!  This one drives me bonkers too.
---
It‚Äôs a bug that‚Äôs existed forever, even in retail.
---
Super fucking annoying.
---
Also there is a fee in terms of the deposit (if there was one) AND they have to pay the AH cut of the bid price.
---
Manually set a higher bid on stuff if you don't like it, while still bidding WAYYYY under the cost or vendor price of the item.
---
My favorite is when people tell me how to place my class or gear my character. Doesn‚Äôt happen in Reddit but does in game regularly
---
That‚Äôs gonna be a yikes from me. Some serious projecting going on here. I wonder how much this guys world would be flipped upside down if he took a psychedelic.
---
im 54 lmfao
---
As much as I dislike your neckbeard approach to the matter I'd like to ask you if you had any books that back up that evolutionary ignorance, thanks.
---
60 mage, 20+ LBRS runs
---
Got the UBRS key before I got pants.  Still don‚Äôt have Hands of Power.
---
I'm still really enjoying my lock at 48 now and steadily pushing along in my own casual pace, but I do sometimes wish I'd have gone mage between the two.   I thought pvp on warlock sounded more fun so went with it, but at this point I'm thinking the pve on mage might be more fun.  I'll probably just stick to the lock though and roll a tank alt instead of ever doing the mage.
---
Hmmm well next step google Xp
---
rogue looks alright, kinda like van cleef
---
Thiccbeard
---
to be fair even at lower levels there are people spamming LFG for ages trying to find a tank. so it's not just what you said, even though that's true.
---
A caveat off this; it‚Äôs not like Warlock is much harder or slower to level
---
He assumed a random playtime to 60 no based on statistics, he assumed a random weekly play time not based on statistics and then slaps it that it will take 10 weeks for people to hit 60.
---
You can't just build up guesses like that and expect a useful result.
---
But if you raise the level cap to 70 what point is there to doing the existing raids?
---
And as long as Naxx loot is still better than previous loot it will still be relevant.
---
Marvel fans, Starbucks drinkers, the list goes on and on.

Holy shit you‚Äôre all over the internet saying this same dumb fucking thing to try and jerk yourself off for being intelligent. What a loser.

I learned a long tine ago.. when you are working for a company.. or playing for one.. you dont have the freedom of speech..  he said somethi g he shouldn't have.. i dont think its right but when you break a contract.. you lose..

Im not going to stop playing a game i want to play because someone else decided to use blizzard as a soap box
---
I like that you posted your server and IGN, even though it has no impact on the answer to your questions, hoping that someone will just pay it for you.
---
I did it for the demon hide bag, would up dragging some guildies into it and they were complaining about all the swimming lmao was a fun experience tho
---
Yea bro I would‚Äôve left too. That guy sounds like a moron. Just tell him ‚Äúit sounds like you want to tank‚Äù he should never pull first and never aoe in the beginning seconds of a fight.
---
Because even though cases like this are legitimate ninja looting theres plenty of times where its a baseless witch hunt and its easier to just tell people not to do it than it is to moderate pseudo righteous reddit outrage

Our group turned in dungeon quest yesterday and we all get different xp.
---
Lol, I guess it‚Äôs broke then!
---
A fight?! Count me in!
---
You can tank deadmines now if you want. No need to wait until after 20. You can run it for the xp if you like grinding it, but there are also a lot of quests in westfall / redridge / duskwood that can keep you busy too.  
---
I'm 43 and haven't trained dual wield yet. I have two 2h axes (ravager for aoe and bonebiter for single-target) and a 1h+shield in my bags that i frequently switch between. Even though you're fury, I still think a 2h is likely better due to how often you will be missing with dual wielding until you can gear up with +hit items.
---
I think people are getting upset for no reason. People are not going to get tired of running mc after they clear. Find a good guild, be a chill dude, and you will have no problem doing any content you want. Pvp IS hard if your are not the most dedicated. Dont like that? To bad that IS how vanilla works with the way pvp is. However pve, doing mc in like a year for the first time, finding people at your same pace? All of that will be so easy to find it is crazy people are getting upset because of a dungeon coming out early.
---
Mine seems to record maybe 10% of the time :(
---
Damnit. So even if I had someone in party invite me and my alt then ran the dungeon I couldn‚Äôt zone in my alt ?
---
Figured... I guess. Thanks for clarifying.
---
Yeah wtf. I'm overwhelmed.
---
Guess who's back
---
Please elaborate why, I would like to know?
---
Cute virtue signalling
---
Depends on the server, but my experience is equal, and PVP encounters were ignored always for me.
---
Happens to me frequently. Super annoying.
---
Lmao youre absolutely full of shit. Stop validating
---
Is it worth unlocking any other weapons beyond the initial as a druid?
---
He didn't edit it. You just didn't read it.
---
It won't matter in the slightest. China's influence is much, much stronger than a few people quitting.
---
Put keys to the new raids in there f rf
---
Does dire maul make MC trivial?  No, because molten core is trivial.  From 1.12 warrior talent reworks, 1.12 rogue talent reworks, 1.12 warlock talent reworks, and so on makes the raid trivial.  The gear in the game is based on a 1.06, 1.10, and 1.12 itemization updates making items hella stronger than they were from 1.01 to 1.03.  Also, people have the knowledge and exact timers for evading damage dealing mechanics to reduce entire raid healing and falling into lava.  
---
DM impacts item progression in that some items from BRD are not as good as the items from DM.  The same upgrades from DM can make there less of a need to run other five man dungeons, depending on your spec and pre raid lists.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=338/the-green-hills-of-stranglethorn
---
Go down to the xp slider.  XP stays the same through lvl 45 (the quest goes green at 43), but from 46-48 the quest xp drops off pretty substantially every level.  At 49 it goes grey and then barely gives anything, but even at 48 it only gives twice as much as 49.
---
So its 4700xp base, and you get that through 45.  46=3750, 47=2800, 48=1900, 49=940, 50=470
---
The quest is green from 43-48.
---
Double check that "Available" is selected in the Filter drop down.
---
Only thing that comes to mind after reading the rest of the comments here.
---
Thank you I guess :P
---
This... I don't mind or fault people for boycotting Blizzard for this reason. 
---
However, looking down on others for not boycotting is very hypocritical for people picking and choosing what human rights issues they want to stick up for. Especially, since like OP suggests, Blizzard isn't the only company doing evil things. I mean, if you have vehicle your support the insanely corrupt oil industry and that's just one example. I doubt many people are riding bikes around while also boycotting blizzard.
---
I soloed SM GY as a rogue. Only one elite pull is 4 people that you can avoid. The rest are single/double pulls or non elite. It was both my xp and money maker. The last boss was not always easy until lvl 38-40.
---
This shit breaks my heart. My first time through Vanilla I played a hunter as a kid because it was the closest I could get to being a Pok√©mon trainer. I remember everyone hating the hell out of the class to where I never rolled on anything for fear of being yelled at. Fast forward 15 years to mid August-  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to make that mistake again, I‚Äôll roll a mage this time, everyone loves mages! Portals and water for everyone, and sheep anything that moves!!‚Äù Boy was I wrong.
---
Just bought 6 months 2 weeks ago. Company politics have nothing to do with how much I love wow classic, and complaining about it on Reddit wont get those people their jobs back.
---
I like dungeon tanking, it can be fun chaos if you deliberately don't mark or the group isn't interested in the marks you put up. Raid tanking is responsibility but more boring.
---
&gt;  in raids you sit there and spam 
---
This is everyone except like, rogues.  Raids are about a huge group pushing the most efficient thing for 10-20 minutes straight.
---
Yes they did, I was there!
---
Enjoy the journey. Take your time.
---
Initially leveled shield specialization because ancestral knowledge boost so minimal. But now I am almost exclusively using a two-hander... should I respec? Both opening choices in enhancement are pretty meh...
---
&gt; and they have flat out stated already it would never happen.
---
Do you have a source on this? I tried looking it up but I found nothing.
---
Winter spring has always been one of the best zones for rich thorium. Apparently if a streamer does it no one has ever thought of it before.
---
What are u doing with these?
---
So assume all auctions on the AH are reserve auctions.
---
They couldn't be playing alts?
---
Added a flair - hopefully it's back up now :)
---
lol I am in the process of doing this myself. Had someone make me the +15% swim speed belt and it really sped it up.
---
So I was just rewatching the video and yea, I‚Äôm sure he was trying to draw our attention to something, like his low health, but the cuts were so incredibly fast I didn‚Äôt even realize what was going before it cut back to the video.
---
I've seen many people yell before a roll and lose. But you don't see those posted on reddit.
---
By that same logic if you're interested in melee dps (enhancement) then a rogue or warrior would be a better class to play. Shamans are hybrids so they bring an entirely different play style and utility compared to mages if you were to go elemental.
---
My strategy going into Classic was to take Skinning &amp; Herbalism. I sold everything I got from those profession on the AH. I hit 90g just shortly before getting level 40 and was able to get my mount. Around level 52 I dropped skinning and picked up enchanting. I used enchanting to only disenchant any greens/blues I got. Sold the mats on the AH for lots of gold. Got my epic mount within a couple days of hitting 60.

There's a few https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Dustwallow_Marsh_quests#Horde_Quests

Honestly you should use the app anyway, especially if you have the 4k plan. The website version can't display 4k video (or it didn't the last I checked), but the app will.

Sounds good. I've been greeding even though the pattern dropped is for my profession. Not needing to flip for money.

The deposit is a combination of the auction time and the vendor cost of an item. It has nothing to do with the stack size, min bid, active bid or buyout price.
---
What class do you guys think has the most engaging leveling experience? What I mean by that is that your rotation tends to change a little bit more as time goes on, or you have much more options in your rotation as you level. Rogue seems to be doing more of that with all the stuff you get while leveling, but I'm curious as to what you guys think.

*dwarf voice* watch your back

Here's the thing China makes a lot of our products so if we're boycotting blizzard we should be boycotting a lot more.
---
Call me cynical.
---
I am not looking for conjecture, looking for source data.
---
Rockbiter is the one you want for threat, but it only beats WF in dps for a few levels. I think around 35 on, depending on your gear and stats, WF starts beating Rockbiter for pure dps. WF is undeniably best by 37+ with Ravager though.
---
Ion mentioned it in a video somewhere, but I couldn't say which unfortunately.
---
What Blizzard did was shit, but it's not like they haven't banned people for stuff that went against their rules before so it's not like it's unprecedented. 
---
&gt; The NBA just lost access to China over a similar comment on a General Manager's personal twitter, just before this. 
---
Apparently China is pissed and they are pulling a bunch of their sponsorship and deals. Apparently it's gonna cost the NBA well over 4 Billion, they are in full damage control ATM.
---
Yeah but ironically I didn't count how many bullets I shot. Can probably get by with cheap ones though.
---
I understand wanting an identical experience if you had a lot of nostalgia wrapped up in the game, little bugs are sometimes what you remember the most. 
---
But a lot of people playing Classic are either new or played it when it came out but aren‚Äôt deeply invested in the nostalgia. Gotta make it enjoyable for them too.
---
They should actually make the game worse in every way. We have seen with the great success of Wow: Classic that by removing all improvements from the game and making everything worse, the dumb fucks who don't understand what the word 'nostalgia' means will greatly enjoy their own suffering and neglect.
---
Why do we have a dungeon recruiting channel all across the world? This is far too convenient. You should be required to walk on foot from one zone to the next and use 1. General chat to LF1M tank for at least 4 hours per dungeon, gaining no experience while doing so. Again, we have seen that stupid assholes actually think that this sort of inconvenience is a good thing.
---
Next, the cost to change your talents should be greatly increased and in fact it should not be allowed to change your talents at all. Did you choose to become a tank or healer so that you could do dungeons and help your friends? Well fuck you piece of shit. If you think about respeccing, the next patch will actually just remove all of your gold and you will still be the same spec. This is better, because causing suffering is inherently good for the users of Wow: Classic.
---
I think with these ideas and more, we can enormously increase the suffering required of everyone who plays this game. Obviously this is a good thing. Classic contained many hundreds of different kinds of suffering and misery which were recklessly patched out by naive developers. With your help, we can hurt and anger the users more than ever before. Fuck you.

Alliance on Skeram needs YOU!
---
Holy paladins are very scarce on our server, and we need all the hardcore players we can get!
---
Yeah, 22 years now, ever since China took over governance of Hong Kong. This is not new in any way, shape, or form. 
---
People just want something else to be outraged about. If they truly cared about anything going on in Hong Kong right now, they would have become an activist before now. It's a matter of convenience and image to them - they don't actually care, but they want to LOOK like they do, so they take a small action and then look down on those of us who don't.
---
Will an uncle work?
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
Unless you have insane gear at 60, then enhancement shaman become beasts in PvP.
---
Can I have your gold?
---
I'm sorry that you lack basic logic skills to figure this out by yourself... you fit right in on Reddit.
---
You're not gonna get away with that unless you have a pally with a ton of +healing that can heal your warrior for the time it takes for you to whittle down the boss' health.
---
Well my idea isn't the same as there's. I think they should go the route of just different tiers equal in stat weight but with different set bonuses. Maybe something that will help towards the next raid content like specific resistance or damage against a type of mob too.
---
If they do Classic+ I hope they use "missing content" like this to implement certain things. How cool would it be for every class to get a Anathema/Benediction style class quest? Ravenholdt is a perfect quest nexus for a Rogue equivalent.
---
One can only hope.
---
Do you want a prize?
---
Clearly!
---
Don't buy every ability at the trainer, they are expensive and most of them you won't use for levling. If you buy every spell you will be broke and never be able to afford your mount.
---
In general try not to spend money on much until level 40 when you can get your mount.
---
Yeah, but I'm not talking about anything too crazy. Stuff like increasing the number of quests allowable in the log, or instant mail to characters within the same account.
---
I will renew my sub.
---
It's lose-lose for Blizzard.   If they allowed this protest to go unpunished,  they would be seen to be supporting a political movement, which is not the kind of company that Blizzard want to be seen as.   SO they punished the players behind the protest and now in this shitstorm they're being made out like they are supporting China.
---
It's not about picking sides.   It's about not being a vehicle for political messages.   Hell, talking about politics in-game of any kind can get you muted.  This is no different.
---
I was collecting Troll Legends there last night, working my way carefully through their little city, when I was invited to a group with a Paladin and Priest about my level.  I was stoked - I'd been doing ok by myself, but that combo should make us invincible.
---
The Pally over-pulled and made no attempt to escape, then stayed in the same place as respawns started popping up around him.
---
I turned around and the priest was behind a wall fighting something by herself.
---
I feigned, they died, I politely excused myself.
---
"As Chinese"
---
X to doubt
---
Sure, but its still kinda demoralizing not getting loot for 3 weeks.
---
Right, primarily it's through the help/harm conditional. For your macro above I would make one small change:
---
    /cast [harm] Seal of Righteousness; [@mouseover,help][] Flash of Light
---
Adding [] will tell the macro to cast Flash of Light as normal if you have no hostile target or no friendly mouseover. For example; if you had an ally selected but your mouse elsewhere.
---
I prefer to prioritize healing spells over damaging spells, so if I were writing that macro to suit my playstyle I'd swap the order:
---
    /cast [@mouseover,help][help] Flash of Light; Seal of Righteousness
---
With this macro you will heal your friendly mouseover even with a hostile target.
---
    /cast [harm] [mod:shift] Seal of Light; Seal of Righteousness 
---
    /cast [@mouseover,help,nodead][help,nodead] [mod:shift] Cleanse; Flash of Light
---
\^This macro wouldn't really work, as it comes back true on Righteousness, stopping the macro there every time. I'm also a little unclear as to how you intended it to work, since your wording indicates that Cleanse should be cast with or without shift and always on a friendly mouseover.
---
    /cast [@mouseover,mod:shift,help][mod:shift,help] Cleanse; [@mouseover,help][help] Flash of Light; [mod:shift,harm] Seal of Light; Seal of Righteousness
---
I took a stab at re-writing it, but if it doesn't do what you need or you have any more questions let me know.
---
Even on the same side. 
---
Yes, i'm going to pull new mobs into your aoe and drop aggro.
---
Go to retail

I was considering it back in 2005/6 after I hit revered, but gave up pretty damn fast :P

*looks out over the lake.*
---
As a ret paly I have saved my raid and furgons multiple times by being a support dps class. People who complain about ret palys don't look at the entire picture and just look at the dps meters.
---
I didn't play vanilla, how is nax gear gamebreaking? Does it just make all content before naxx completely faceroll?
---
So you just spout shit then when challenged you get mad? I am here to have a rational discussion, not one based on your feelings man.
---
Wait people seriously thought he said fight? I always specifically heard the "p" sound myself so I knew it was pint.
---
The real psycho is your hairdo looool
---
Why though? I'm currently killing these at level 50 just for exp and to get to unfriendly status.
---
Why get exalted?
---
Apparently the horde have a repeatable collection quest that rewards money that got patched later to not give as much money, but since this is classic and no changes, it becomes an easy way to get a mount. 
---
(correct me if I am wrong.)
---
Oh crap! You‚Äôre right, for some reason I got my acronyms mixed up üòÖ
---
Bingo. Faux outrage to get internet praise. :/
---
The deposit is based on the vendor price, not on the starting bid. If it's a high value item, then they absolutely will be paying a penalty for cancelling.
---
How is this abusing the system?
---
If the buyer wants gauranteed purchase of mats, they should spend the buyout.
---
Paladins are uncontestably better healers but druids are better at everything else.
---
The community has been surprisingly toxic. People reserving dungeon loot etc and not wanting certain classes in their groups. Or not following instructions in dungeons then blaming tanks or healers. Hopefully when the casuals catch up it's much better.
---
Except you can't dps
---
That bone pile would be the absolute worse spot to aoe farm. Way to few mobs and too long of respawn along with shite drops.
---
The nothingness cleared off revealing a face. Was this a valkyrie? No, it was her. The sweet face he became so accustomed to see each day now felt like seeing it for the first time.
---
*Arise, my champion!,* she said, her voice crackling and eyes slowly giving way to tears.
---
It all came back to him now: the sudden panic, the clashing of swords sounding faintly through the thick cathedral doors... and the battle. Oh, the battle. Although outnumbered, he held his ground with courage and honor.  
---
He now knew that even together they were no match for the intruders. The traitors!  
---
But he couldn't muster the words to tell her that. Not after she desperately raised him for one last time.  
---
Everything he could say was...

What? 
---
&gt; People have been talking about the Honk Kong protests for months, 
---
I just said this. Right here:
---
&gt; things like this have been going on for a very long time in China
---
The point was that everyone getting riled up about it now is likely living under a rock and/or is just another online slacktivist.
---
Alliance. :&gt;
---
The early release of dire maul is dumb but not as bad as their idea to add the PvP honor system with bgs.
---
It's going to make the game almost unplayable for your "casual" players who are level 50-59
---
How long did that take?
---
"Downvote away!" Cringey
---
I'm assuming nothing.  Unless you're in a log cabin in the woods and living off the land, you're massively supporting China. You don't seem to realize this.

Pro gamer tip.

Forget the Alliance and the Horde.  Let me revitalize the Scarlet Crusade/Onslaught.
---
These "imagine this...imagine that" comments are getting old.  You're a Shadow Priest.  I was a Rank 14 Shadow Priest back in the day.  They are one of the best if not best PvP classes out there.  They dominate 1v1 situations (only warlocks generally have the upper hand) and are great in crowd control and handling multiple attackers.
---
It's hilarious that you spent so long before understanding Classic wasn't for you.
---
What did you expect, really?
---
Sure! Do you play on old blanchy alliance?
---
As near as I can remember this was roughly my 1.12 hemo PVP build.  The Imp Kidney shot and gouge can be removed around to do the deadliness thing I mentioned above but Imp. Gouge and Camouflage allow you to do the gouge/restealth trick which was essential for 100-0 stun locks.
---
It was like CS, how ever many hemos (can't remember) KS, hemos and gouge right as KS ends, restealth, CS etc....

Complains about X and quits.

Where can I find a pre-raid BIS list that now includes Dire Maul?
---
Specifically for resto and feral druids if that matters.
---
it was a bonus for sure :D
---
Nahh man, look at half the level 40 quests. They are always like "Somewhere in this zone are trolls, kill them" "Southish is an ogre camp, kill their boss" just that there are 5 ogre camps southish that span half the zone.
---
There is a "drag me" text in the upper left corner of the world map but i can't click it because it's off screen.  Can anyone help me get my map recentered?

pretty rich posting this on the classic wow subreddit lmfao
---
As far as I know they stopped using MPQ in retail at some time. Don't know how it is with classic.
---
Nice nice! Congrats on your new trinket haha
---
Lmao smh. Such a scum move by people supporting these services
---
For the trinket, thought it could be useful in PvP. Also, farmed some gold on the way too.
---
You just keep gear from dungeons that people dont want or from quests its really easy. Also Ele at max level is only good for pvp you will be a healer if you chose shaman and want to raid.
---
Fun fact, only the lesser elementals drop the items for the first part of the quest. I saw several people there (by kargath) farming the regular rock elementals. They were there before me and I finished the quest before them when I told them they were on the wrong mobs they said the drop rate was just really low and then told me to fuck off. Some say they ate still there today, trying to get quest items off the wrong mobs.
---
Is the dialogue always this shitty?
---
You earned it for sure. Very impressive time sink üòÇ
---
As long as you are not on top of buildings or in an area where a guard cannot get to you, you are good.  If they don't aggro when you pick a fight right in the middle of town, that's not your problem.
---
That means you're using the down vote button as it was intended. I haven't checked in a while, but I believe if you go Reddit FAQ it even says the down vote was not designed to be a disagreement button, and that you should not be using it if you didn't also respond to the comment. 
---
It's part of the hive mind mentality that Reddit, social media, and other virtual media are embracing. It allows people to ignore what they don't want to hear or that doesn't align with their beliefs.
---
No way, that's huge.
---
No. Do it again.
---
Classic was for him. He essentially played the whole entire game.
---
I'm almost positive they'll be releasing BC servers and not doing classic+, so the good news is that you can just wait for that
---
Why would a paladin be able to get a warlock mount? You can buy your regular race mount or the pally mount.
---
What‚Äôs wrong with you? Dire Maul isn‚Äôt even a big deal.
---
As a 60 resto shaman who is now farming MC Crazyh is completely correct. We have a dumb ass raidlead who plays Enhance and he dies every single trash pack even after giving the tanks 10 15 seconds of sunder time. And we had an ele shaman but he literally couldnt keep up with anyone due to fights currently taking too long. Max gear when bosses die in 30seconds ele is fine but not during progression. He had to switch resto to find dungeon groups or a raid spot.
---
Fear Ward is dispellable.  Remove magic is PvP 101 for other priest.
---
On PvE servers you just have a mob of people trying to outskin each other. If you have to loot, you‚Äôll never start skinning it as fast as someone else.
---
Engineering crafts use a lot. The mid level ones are needed for scopes. (Moss Agate, Aquamarine, Jade ect) Try to sell them or give to an eng friend, as those are great for leveling.
---
Obviously Arcane Crystals are used for Arcanite bars, so those are precious. Many of the other upper level gems don't see a ton of use.
---
Threatplates massively change gameplay. They didnt exist in the 1.12 client, even on private servers, and they are a huge boon.
---
Here are stat weight formulas frost mages of either common raiding spec can use:
---
1% Crit in SP: (Base + (SP x 0.8143)) / ((1 + Crit) x 81.43)
---
1% Hit in SP: (Base + (SP x 0.8143)) / (Hit x 81.43)
---
For intellect, just divide the crit weight result by 59.5
---
The "Base" value is roughly ~458 for rank 10 frostbolt (it scales up a bit over your last few levels after you learn it). Crit and hit are in decimal form (e.g. 97% hit = 0.97). The coefficients 0.8143 and 81.43 are rounded off from (3 / 3.5) * 0.95 and that value x 100 respectively, so you can substitute these for more precision if you want.
---
(Side note: Although spells work on a two-roll system, hit doesn't appear in the formula for crit. This isn't an error; missing just harms both crit and SP equally.)
---
You'll need to know your spell crit chance, but addons are available for classic that can retrieve this info for you.
---
Max rank earth shock is functionally a taunt.  And it's way more than paladins have.
---
I have unsubbed, but only until we get a solid response about it, not just the canned response. I definitely get it.  This right here is the reason they have zero tolerance for this. 
---
If they let this player and hosts go, they are going down a slippery slope.  I don‚Äôt speak the language but they apparently egged him on to say it.
---
This was handled without grace and with the pendulum of doom. I hope  there to be a more elegant statement in the next few days from Our Blizzard addressing this more seriously. If not, then I won‚Äôt be back.
---
I don‚Äôt expect them to change their stance.  I know blizz isn‚Äôt going to shift to fight for Hong Kong‚Äôs rights.  Or start trashing Winnie the poo. But causing them to handle these situations differently or alter policy is a good thing.  It‚Äôs a step in the right direction.  Every little fight progresses the battle.
---
You're not allowed to exploit the fact that guards are to stupid to climb walls.
---
You are allowed to attack people as you want aslong as guards can attack you too.
---
They can get to me, I just avoid attacking when they're near (patrols)
---
42 undead rogue here! Recently quested badlands, north Stv, theramore. Is 42 still too early for a full uldaman clear? Where would be my next steps for questing?
---
Yeah idk wtf you‚Äôre talking about but ok.
---
Yeah I didn't even bother to farm ANY BiS gear. I just did every instance once and called it that. The raids are so mind-numbingly easy you do NOT need to sit and farm your BiS gear for weeks/months on end for a slight dps increase. My guild did two 17-18 man Ony's the last week I raided and that was three weeks after release. None of us were geared.
---
this isn't exactly what i was looking for, as it doesn't save all of the data in it's entirety (only up to 25 segments) but it's just as good.
---
thanks a lot for the help!
---
Proof? The other guy said it's chill.
---
wooden guys?
---
I love how people say this like is a bad thing. You realize that most people engaging in what you deride as virtue signaling do so because they're sincere in actually caring about what they say, right?
---
Not to mention literally every group does this, yourself included.
---
Still cheaper than epic riding.
---
What does that prove?  Anyone can pull numbers off google and purport that they received a call from it.   Especially those who may be trying to prove some kind of sinister conspiracy.   So as I said in my comment in this thread, proof or it never happened.
---
Look up any piece of classic gear.
---
Scroll down to comments around 2006
---
Read comments by Hunters on why they can benefit from that particular piece of gear.
---
Who. Gives. A. Fuck?
---
I don't have a problem lol, I was looking for source data and you gave me a personal experience which was more so shallow an ant couldn't drown in it. 
---
Who here lack basic logic skills, when you have trouble reading the initial prompt?
---
DKP. Points earned for effort is the best way to do things. The content isnt difficult enough to justify gearing a handful of people out completely ASAP.
---
Then don't do it.
---
It's not like raiding MC/Ony was the only option a level 60 has.
---
Get out in the world and PvP, that's where the fun is at, there's no specific mechanics since every encounter is different and you're literally trying to outsmart another human being, instead of playing against a scripted AI.
---
Oh, wait, you play on a care bear server.
---
See, that's your problem right there, you're doing it wrong.
---
&gt; I really hope they'll NEVER introduce TBC
---
You're going to very disappointed in a year or two then, I'm afraid
---
Right? Lol, it's so weird. Meh, whatever it's fine, we need someone to gank after all.
---
In real life, auctions with bids can be cancelled. Try getting an auction car from Copart with reserve price met and you'll find that the seller will counteroffer you much higher than your successful bid. Same with real estate auctions.
---
I may get flak for it, but imo the best system is EPGP. Math never plays favorites, and it's always fair.

&gt;angry lil guy arent you?
---
&gt; You're a special kind of shit
---
Woah, easy, dude.
---
&gt; You are clearly saying "nobody gave a shit until Hearthstone got involved"
---
But yes, the point is the same. Most people *around here* didn't give two shits about all the horrid human rights violations that have been occurring in China for decades until Hearthstone got involved. 
---
Or maybe I just missed all the boycott posts before last week.
---
I do the same with thick leather and headbands when thick leather hits 5s and less.
---
Netflix, crafting, vendoring.
---
The transformation economy.
---
A lot of classes can solo this guy, I did today with my hunter, takes some resets to get him to spawn at the right location, but then is pretty easy
---
I don't see the problem, of course some items actually require you to have that profession leveled. But it's no different from me playing Mage, getting Archmage only to switch to enchanting next day.  
---
At the end of the day you adapt to your environment. Some guild leaders would rather have the best items go to guildies who can benefit all members rather than trust you to alt for everyone. Some runs people will sell the item regardless and don't even need. If 7 people roll need to sell/alt you probably should to.
---
What I gather from wowhead, the reduced quantity are a simplification in TBC.
---
Most likely we are looking at the first row.
---
Sad to say, all the prices have skyrocketed, at least 120% market price, and are bound to go up more.
---
It's the sound he hears as the air travels between his ears.
---
The really hard core players apparently dont even use this bad boy. You can counter spell it to lock palas out, and seeing as everything is Holy your bummed. Do people actually go for this then or their races mount?
---
That's my fetish.
---
This is precisely the problem, people would rather ignore and go about their lives. Enough is enough...
---
you are correct. each turn in requires 5 shellfish and you get 55s in return. so each stack is worth 2g 5s
---
then you're not exploiting guards pathing, so you should be fine. they will typically warn you first, anyway, and action you if you keep doing it.
---
Why are you laughing is it to hide the tears of being the worst tank, a bad warr dps or a lesser priest?
---
I paid 200 for mine, smolderweb.
---
Renewed for 6 months, and added a BFA faction change on top of it. 
---
I love WoW, it's one of the only things that gives me joy in life, even if Blizzard completely sides with China (even though I don't believe they do), oh well. There are way worse things to worry about than how a company handles their PR
---
I agree with this.
---
The stormwind building models were only texture to be seen from ground level
---
Its your hypocrisy in your selective outrage.  
---
Give up everything having to do with China.
---
Or shut up with your ‚ÄúThis is the ONLY hot topic to be outraged against‚Äù
---
Then the druid just has to step up their druiding and keep the group alive. I'm saying this from the perspective of a level 33 druid btw haha. Played it in later xpacks but first time in vanilla.
---
Other people addressed the taunt mixup but I'll talk about the damage mitigation. You're absolutely correct when talking about raids. In dungeons, it's less of an issue, but people are definitely playing them at least a little wrong. *Yes*, they will take more damage than a druid/warr. But, they also have healing stream totem, which they should absolutely be using as a tank. This helps mitigate some of the extra damage they take, but also generates more AoE threat than any of their other water totems.
---
Even without things like shield wall, they've still got a shield and mail armor. They need to prioritize dodge and def stats higher than warr do, but are less reliant on DPS to hold threat, especially AoE threat. They have their advantages, if the group is willing to work within their limitations. I'd never say they are better, or even on par, with a warrior; but it's totally feasible.
---
11/5/35
---
Shield slam is great for boss tanking, but the real star of going deep prot is the additional 1 hander damage.
---
lightning bolt turns from 3 second cast to 2 second cast. always miss it when I am forced into mana tide.
---
What's worse is that it's the overtly casuals complaining too. Like, okay if we go at the pace of someone that is still level 20, the next patch will come out in 2023.
---
People just like to be mad for no reason
---
What should I learn and where can I learn them?
---
They aren't that rare, you just have to be sure to kill the "lesser" elementals. Half of those elementals near kargath don't drop items for that quest.
---
The best part is that he is training the nubsaw lmao
---
Hm this sounds actually pretty doable, maybe I will set one up myself!
---
The ideal solution is to join a guild that has a loot system where that doesn't happen.
---
Its nothing to even discuss. He signed that contract. He breached that contract and got the punishment that was mentioned in the said contract
---
Oh chimpansee that! Monkey news!

Quest above lvl 40, don't spend gold on the AH on things you'll replace in a day or two, only buy abilities for the spec you're playing and spells you'll need (no one needs rank three of demoralizing roar if they'll never play bear)  
---
Most sub 60 mats, greens, and even epic boe's are selling so cheap right now because of severe market bloating. Just quest, don't worry about it, and buy the mount at like 42/43 from quest gold
---
Do you mean obtainable through pvp, or just good for pvp?
---
The big difference is the aesthetic. They both are ranged magic users that have a ton of utility. But would rather wield the flame of shadow and harness demons or be a more traditional wizard who can harness fire, frost, and arcane?  
---
If you care about this then I would make your decision based off of it, as who you are is permanent throughout your vanilla career. Who cares if you can solo partway through BRD as a lock or AOE farm as a mage if you don‚Äôt like who you are?

I got Ravager to proc once b2b2b every single time, few hours later would rarely proc once. It's godlike when RNG works to your favor, pain when not.

They recently updated spawns in pogo, so there's all sorts of new problems, mostly in the low to medium spawn areas. I went from no spawns to 7 in my house becuase of my activity but other had all their spawns moved about 80 feet north, it's been weird
---
Killing someone in a contested zone on a PVP server for an important resource that is highly sought after. What scum.
---
I left my snarky remark earlier but now I feel like voicing my opinion. Remember this is MY opinion. 
---
You are seriously doing not only this game but MMOs in general a disservice by playing them the way that you do. I realize that the genre has become nothing more than a game to be beaten and then put aside until new content comes out but that was never how they were meant to be played.  
---
Making friends to fight along side is much healthier not only for the game but for yourself. You obviously have zero attachment to the rest of your guild if you can‚Äôt enjoy playing each area more than once before getting bored. 
---
Until you change how you view the genre it will always become stale to you.
---
They are using the blood of innocents to get that market share
---
Also I am just goofing. It sucks not having a normal rez.

I always had a preference to zero sum style DKP. 
---
Basically whatever item you get cost all your points, so you 0 out every time.  
---
When you're not in a guild going for server firsts,  And youre just playing to have fun, it helps balance the loot evenly to everyone.  Otherwise. If you're going for server firsts, loot council done properly.
---
Druid maybe? You use cat form most of the time but bear/caster have uses too.
---
You're jumping to conclusions though. There's no hint of TBC ever even being a thing aside from the speculation in this sub. People asked for classic, not TBC. Honestly, if they release that, I'll be surprised.
---
restarting my pc solves the problem for me
---
Hmm, alright, what about if I get attacked by guards, kill the guards and then keep attacking players? The guards won't respawn for 5-10 minutes.
---
Agreed
---
I believe that is only if the last player looks at the loot, that's when the short time starts.

Download questie and look at your world map.  It will list every single quest and it's level.

If I list my enchanting dust in stacks of 20, it sells about 1/3 of the time. If I list them 20x1 for the same price each, they all sell basically all the time.

So no
---
This ended up being a wall of text so TL;DR: I'm burned out on my warrior, I like my Rogue and Druid alts but am not sure if I'll end up burning out on those as well. I like solo wPvP, melee DPS and tanking when the group doesn't frustrate the crap out of me. What do?
---
I have a Warrior that I'm 2 bars from 48 with, and I have absolutely no interest in playing it at the moment.
---
I enjoy tanking when the group is good, but the majority of my experience is a group full of trigger happy dps and healers who don't know how to downrank/want to help dps and run out of mana every single pull. The issue with this is that since I've been having so much trouble logging into my Warrior I'm starting to fall behind my guild in levels, and getting a good group is harder when pugging.
---
On top of that, I love Arms and I love wPvP, but my experience thus far (and the general consensus from what I've read around the internet) is that without a pocket healer, I'm gonna have a bad time against the majority of classes.
---
I've tried a couple alts, have a Druid and Rogue nearing the 20s and I'm having way more fun with them, but I'm not sure if this is just because it's a new, fresh playstyle and I'll hit this fatigue again when I get late in the leveling process. 
---
I'm really not even sure what I'm asking, so here's a bunch of questions: 
---
* Have any of you felt fatigue with your chosen class so far into the leveling process? 
---
   * Did you push through it or end up sticking with an alt? 
---
* Any 60 Warriors who play solo and have a good time wPvPing with no pocket healer?
---
* Anyone who's played Rogue/Druid and Warrior have any insight into which is the most fun for solo-based PvP?
---
* If I choose Druid to commit my time to and end up tanking again, do you find "bad" groups easier to manage than Warrior tanking?
---
* Issues getting consistent groups as a Rogue?
---
Gotcha
---
Because it's binding for the buyer. It ties up his money and he can't opt out of it if another cheaper one goes up for sale, but the seller can opt out.
---
For clarity though, if the healer is not prioritizing you, you can't do your job.   It seems as though there was a bit of that going on too.   As I said though, I was not there so I don't know the context behind it all, so I can't make any presumptions on what really happened.
---
Additionally, you can have the fishing profession in addition to your two other for money making. 
---
Fishing in pools makes decent money, payed for my mount and all my skills with just fishing.

DEing your gear as you level is a huge source of materials.  A big source of shards as well.

---
What he's doing is very simple; listing things at low bid/high buyout causes them to appear first on the default ui AH results for linen cloth so you just bank on lazy people no scrolling through four pages to find the point where the bid matches the buyout.
---
Personally, I think it is stupid.  Having said that, running BRD for 110th time, I get why people reserve items or craft their group so only player equip item.  Just be up front about it.
---
I don't care if I get shit on, I am happy with the choice I made.
---
I remember starting in mid-TBC.  My first raid wasn't until Naxx.  I don't remember crying about it like some are doing now.
---
Never ran into issues like this. But yeah I'd straight up refuse to heal.
---
Hey, Onions have layers also.....

Yes thats what looking. My 60 power lvling the new acc
---
I've been in 1 MC raid but I've also been gone the majority of the last week (hit 60 last thursday) and am not Ony attuned yet.  I'd say I'm one of the lucky ones.
---
I dont really have any proof of this, but I think enhance shammys are over-saturated at 60 and there will be a lot of them hurting to find raids.  It also doesn't help the stigma that the benefit of a "good" one versus a bad one is massive.
---
10/10 troll post.  Would read again and get angry before I realized what it was.
---
Several days. I did not really count the precise number of hours.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be happy either, that thing looks like total trash.
---
I'd love for them to roll out TBC with HMs of vanilla dungeons. Keep all the content somewhat relevant instead of all of vanilla endgame completely abandoned like what originally happened. Maybe put them on a rotating schedule? Some other MMOs like SWTOR have done well in keeping old content relevant by putting 2 or so dungeons at a time on HM for a week or so then rotating them.
---
Or I can have fun playing the game as Ret while not bordering my raid/party at all. You look at just the meters and nothing else. I get whispers asking to come durgons as a support dps because I know how to play my class well. If you wanna just look at meters that's cool. I'll look at all the people who invite me to the party and people who have changed their mind about the idea of ret palys when playing with me.
---
Addons aren‚Äôt what's causing it, they just make it easier to do.
---
I only have characters on one realm and I still have to select the region and realm every time.
---
I‚Äôm finding most people have found this all frustrating so we got addons to make it easier so now it‚Äôs just that. 
---
Also, sometimes people need a select number so selling in groups of 2,5, 12 even for that cooking quest sell better I have found!
---
I thought he was saying black was better.
---
This is why you don't reddit and work.
---
I honestly don't know how I feel about new content for classic. As others have pointed out, Naxx gear at  60 is already pretty over powered. Going far beyond that could result in some pretty game breaking things in terms of PVP in particular. 
---
I think that they should just let Naxx be the last raid and then have an option to progress to BC after a good chunk of time has passed. I think that Naxx needs to stay around *way* longer than it did in Vanilla. Barely anyone got to see it or even come remotely close to clearing it. It's such a beautifully designed dungeon with icon looking sets and weapons. I just hope that they give the player base a good opportunity to experience it.
---
Nah this was the case even late vanilla.  Add-ons may encourage it but ppl did it anyway
---
I'm not looking to learn *everything*, just some of the basics about the class beyond the SWP+Mindflay spam that you learn while leveling.
---
It's https://wowpop.appspot.com/
---
However
---
Blizzard broke the census addon, so all the information there is out of date. The faction ratios are probably *pretty* close, but be especially careful in the case of high pop realms with free transfers, the smaller faction has probably gotten even smaller since then.

It‚Äôs not scummy at all to PvP over something valuable like devilsaur, RTVs or a black lotus. 
---
It‚Äôs just as much this warriors fault for leaving themselves so vulnerable as it is the shamans to jump him and take the leather.

If you can barely solo a Dino, then you need to farm in a group. Better to split the leather than lose it all together.

I think you're wrong about getting less xp when grouped, I tested this last night and killing a mob solo I got less xp than killing the exact same mob when grouped. I got like 288 xp from a mob solo and 158 when grouped killing the same exact mob. It seems you get slightly more xp when grouped
---
You're completely wrong about the FPS part: Ultra widescreen is such a huge advantage that most competitive FPS games disable it.
---
I'm not making any conclusions, just presenting the case. It's true that TBC is not confirmed by any means, but it's a likely possibility, and that's what people are concerned about. Keep in mind that someone playing an hour a day won't be 60 for another 6-7 months, and won't make it through MC for at least a year. If content continues to be added at the same rate that Dire Maul was, they won't see any raid content whatsoever before phase 6 is over and done with. You can judge for yourself how likely that is, but a lot of people think it's likely enough to be upset. If you disagree, that's cool; there aren't many facts yet, just speculation.
---
Close!  You've still got 8 slots to fill, chump!
---
So true. Myself and my entire group were all super excited to noob around deadmines trying to figure out how to play as a team. Can‚Äôt even picture how a raid with 40 people would play out. So yes. I hope for the game‚Äôs longevity for sure.
---
I mean putting something up is one thing, replacing pictures of your loved ones is something else. Plus... waifu? Really?
---
Can‚Äôt get tfury until BWL is released

Agreed on most of your points. Although the time consumption of finding quests and running to and from I think is part of the allure of the rpg imo
---
zoomer is a nickname for generation z, people born 1998 or later.
---
Titanforging was added in Legion, and expanded upon the Warforging mechanic added way back in Mists. And it's often cited as one of the worst additions to the game.
---
Anyway, if the discussion is "New content for Vanilla Classic vs. TBC/Wrath Classic" I will always choose TBC/Wrath. I don't think the risk of having retail developers make new content is worth it over simply getting old expansion content where we 100% know what to expect.
---
So if the only item I need is the crossbow from LBRS..... I'm ridiculous for reserving it if I can't form an all caster group with a druid tank? 
---
Literally every rogue, hunter, and warrior share the same BIS items for half the slots. I'm not wasting my time rolling against random people on the only thing I need from a dungeon
---
And add more atiesh/val'anyr type legendaries that take forever to farm/make. They don't need to be game breaking, they just need to be good and look cool.

Wow, thank you. Was just thinking about this last night and how annoying clicking the realm name every time is.
---
What idiot attempts to farm devilsaur like that anyway? You‚Äôre asking to be stolen from. Warrior got what they deserved. Farm in a group next time if you can barely kill a Dino
---
Seriously, why is there all this talk about Classic+?  Why would that ever happen?  All the talk has been from hopeful Classic fans.  They're not going to spend the time and money to develop new content for a game they've already done so for, especially when doing bare minimum re-releases has been so profitable.  
---
I expect TBC Classic because of how successful Classic has been, but Classic+ is a pipe dream.
---
and then remind yourself that you're a casual and that you don't care.

People knew how to take a joke in 2004. Seems like every joke is an insult now.

Wooa man it's the current year. Just because our wives are body pillows doesn't make them not "real".

I am the elemental/restoration hybrid Shaman. Will I be able to DPS or heal in raids?
---
I enjoyed playing Classic. It was fun.
---
But there's a dozen other games right now that I can/want to play. Blizzard's actions have just added one other factor in determining how I spend my time gaming now.
---
a lot of it beats out some MC stuff tho so yeah its a big change
---
Really depends what you herbing for.  I generally just do a counter-clock wise rotation in the zone I am targeting herbs from.
---
They broke the ability for such an addon to work. All data is outdated by 3-4 weeks now and is unreliable
---
How about that layering getting removed :)
---
Except you are supporting the problem by supporting Blizzard/Activision.  Blizzard is an American company that has censored and punished someone because they supported the Hong Kong Protesters. Blizzard actively decided to censor the protester for speaking for freedom. It's unknown whether Tencent strongarmed Blizzard or not, but the point still stands that Blizzard defended anti-freedom values and anti-human rights. If Tencent was involved then it'd be a call to boycott Tencent, but we don't know. What we do know is Blizzard is for the Chinese Government, and not for the people.
---
If you still continue to support Blizzard then why don't you go all the way and suck Winnie the Poos tiny cock while you level your Rogue to 60.

Are you trolling? When WoW came out, it was The CASUAL mmo. It made mmorpgs accessible.   I‚Äôm a game like Everquest you couldn‚Äôt make any meaningful progression on your character without spending a good 3 or 4 hours. Soloing was very difficult if not impossible for some classes.  Wow changed all that and was seen as the MMORPG for casuals.   So for you to say WoW was the hardcore game in its day, your 100% wrong.
---
RemindMe! 8 hours

Where did TBC come from? I mean there has been speculation on it but I think more people talk about Classic+ as opposed to a TBC re-release.
---
&gt; Do you even play? Like actually lmao. I started a new alt a couple of days ago and already hit 30 in under 30 hours.

Do you even adult? Like actually lmao. Must be nice to be a teenager with no job or life responsibilities that lets you play 15 hours a day.
---
I love that there are clearly pants that match up with this...go find those pants right now and show us the full outfit!
---
I feel like you are missing the point here or being deliberately obtuse. It's not about prices so much as them abusing the search function to have their items be shown first on the list, which is a huge advantage over everyone else because most people don't use the AH addons to search. They can not search by buyout or percentages, they can only search by bids and they see the auctions of the people abusing it first.
---
Again, if they actually let the bid go, or as OP suggested, they were forced to sell it for whatever the bid ends with, then it would be fine, but they aren't. They are taking it down and putting it back up. It doesn't take 20 times of being canceled to sell, it sells pretty decently because most people don't use AH addons and end up seeing it first every time. It's also worth noting if you didn't know, 8h auctions are very cheap on the tax, it's the 24h auctions that cut into the profits and hurt to cancel. Doing 8h auctions during prime times are way more profitable than a 24h auction.
---
This doesn't affect me personally. I use auctioneer and can sort by percentage and buy out if I want. All I am saying is that this is definitely unintended abuse that Blizzard didn't care about in Vanilla and don't care about now, but it is abuse. You know they didn't intend people to abuse the search function, they only put the cancel feature in so people could get their item back if they made a mistake or decided they wanted to keep it.
---
You were right :)
---
I don't like it at all, even if that particular item is irrelevant to me. I'll never whine about it to you and you have every right to do it but I silently won't join your group. I don't like promoting a culture on the server where its routine.

The purpose is to flood the AH with items that prevent people from seeing the competition.  The best value, Mazzeli, has 3 auctions up.  How many pages is the player without this addon going to wade through to find those 3 good deals?  Odds are, they will click through a few pages, get frustrated that there are no cheap linen offers (when there absolutely are) and buy the overpriced linen instead.  Sure, the guy wastes a lot in deposit fees but if he is able to consistently get exorbitant values for his linen, it is a net gain in the long run.
---
The challenge here is to find ways to filter him out.  Whether by looking at bids, level, seller, or other sorting criteria.  But that can be gamed as well.  The changes to retail, where you don't see the sellers and just the prices will be a huge change against this method.

Agreed. I say release BC as as it was back in the day and make some HMs out of vanilla dungeons to keep them relevant. Drop stats can be similar to other BC HMs, it'd just be nice to have additional variety. Maybe even do a rotating HM schedule out of the vanilla dungeons so people aren't as split on what they're running.
---
So Shadow Priest will work as a DPS?
---
They should go back to their retail toons, then.
---
I think no solution will ever be perfect, but I think it does work because I've seen the state of markets in games where the players know they're at 0 risk if they buy gold.
---
Do some pug raids and pick up some pieces of pre-bis, then farm pvp gear in p2.
---
I feel you, Warrior bro. I mained a Warrior from Vanilla all the way to Legion before quiting the game. My Classic Warrior is level 44 and I'm having some trouble wanting to level.
---
For your question about tanking - it doesn't matter what class you're tanking as. In classic dumb DPS will make it difficult 100% of the time. I honestly applaud people who can consistently stand pugging as a tank. I will only do it if I know the group as most people are still in the retail mindset of go go go. To be fair, melee cleave groups can do this, but it's still annoying.
---
In PVP, you will have a hard time soloing enemies as a Warrior until you get gear. Once you get gear you'll be stronger against other classes except Mages and Hunters. Decent players of those classes will beat you 9/10 times unless you have a healer.
---
There are a couple, you sure it doesnt? Because I'm pretty sure i followed them to the last room, or at least the last room on the side the chose maybe.
---
That's mostly true of caster sets, but most melee sets give +hit to some level. Warriors can effectively trade the Legs and Shoulders as I recall for the T2.5 ones for DPS.
---
If there 2H warriors (Horde) then they only 9% which isn't all that much and of your an Orc with a HWL Great Axe you would only need 7% iirc. Thats pretty easily obtainable. The only piece you probably wouldn't wear as a warrior is probably Helmet, replacing it with Lionheart for PVE cause its stated so well.
---
The biggest bonus you get, is the bonus of having an extra 2k health and armor because your wearing a mish-mash of Leather, Mail and the occasional plate item. The pvp sets have a lot more "stat allotment points" then stuff from MC or Pre-bis do and even the front half of BWL.
---
I don't think handing 1.12 pvp gear to anyone that can be asked to que a battleground is a wise move.
---
The old system isn't great, but at least it was a large time sync to prevent a lot of folks from getting it.
---
like i said, if you're just doing a scan of the AH to get the historical price, that continues to work.  It just stops showing results in the table after, ~ 2,000 results.  
---
It's not very common to get more than 2,000 results when you're searching for a single item

It‚Äôs as simple as this. Any loot rules that are disclosed ahead of time are fine. People can elect to join or not join based on he loot rules. But if you bring up the fact that items are reserved several minutes after the party invite, that is problematic. Let people know when you advertise in LFG or concurrently with the party invitation. Don‚Äôt make me waste my time or hearth just to find out several minutes later that X item is reserved. If you pull that on me, you will be on my party blacklist.

Is that why the SFK Cloth drops all have Agi/Int/Spr?  God damn it's amazing how mess vanilla itemization is
---
Look soft crit cap is a thing, but not a thing to worry about too much. Crit cap is a thing mostly for melees because of glancing blows, and crit suppression. As a hunter you will always benefit from crit.
---
Who doesn't like looking at those big numbers am I right?
---
Nah Wowhead's been bugged since Beta to show all ranged weapons as dealing Frost damage instead of Physical. The added Shadow damage is real though, but it's one of few "combination elemental weapons" in the game where you don't really notice the added elemental damage ever (unless your target becomes immune to physical damage).
---
Not a problem friend, have a good time over there! Hope you find some good people. If you have a hard time finding friends and helpful players, stick it out. There are so many good people in WoW you just gotta find them!
---
It's fine if you inform people *before* inviting them, that's all.
---
Sorry, I'm fully aware that I'm not helping the Hong Kong protesters cause but this "If you're not cutting every Chinese influence out of your life" bullshit has no place with me. I haven't used apple phones in a decade so I've probably done my part more than all the people cancelling their subs. Enjoy your internet catharsis rampage.
---
Or at the auction house. That damn train toy...
---
Ia there a group for 50-59 or is it 50-60?
---
You can't use ST as a metric lol. Everyone hates ST and it's a one or done or skipped entirely a lot of the times. I had no issues making my own group for it.
---
Doing the horde ony attune is an absolute nightmare compared to alliance chain
---
Did you even open the picture before answering? If you're gonna be a "repost" snop, at least be right
---
No they‚Äôre not. According to NAAA there‚Äôs no requirement to announce the reserve. Of course the auctioneer knows the price so he knows what to drive the price to but in no regular auction is the reserve announced to the buyers
---
42 is still the half way point in playing time assuming you play equally efficient at all stages.
---
Maybe you just played less recently?
---
Probably not to hard I'd that got in on the result name claim.
---
I'm pretty sure the only way to get high Bloodsail rep is to kill guards.
---
Damn that's kinda pushing me away from making one
---
Is the Winterspring Frostsaber or the horse equivalent in the game yet?
---
It‚Äôs not so much explicit permission, but the fact that their spouse is cool with them vegging out on a video game.
---
This would be so sick. A lot of shit to tinker with, but I think that this would bring so much hype to Classic (even more than it already has).
---
To be fair, combat rogue with dodge boosted via evasion, pushes most hits that do connect into the parry table. Hard to overpower with no weapon. ;)
---
However, yeaaaah. When that doesn‚Äôt happen....
---
Did you download it from Github? Addons from there will sometimes have "-master" in the folder name, and they won't work when you launch.

&gt; Fishing in pools makes decent money, payed for my mount and all my skills with just fishing.
---
That's good to know. All fish or just be on the lookout for specific ones for money?
---
Look. All you do is look at the meters. I look past that.
---
Hamstring hardly ever works on a group 3+ because it‚Äôs single target. Cleave does such little damage it isnt even worth using level 26 now and things are still rough
---
I've had friends run me through a few things (I'm alt crazy and playing casual while they hustled to 60) and the xp was solid. The amazing thing was getting money and drops which helped with gold for skills and whatnot!
---
Nooope.
---
It's different with a third person perspective but a first person perspective has to be stretched out throughout the whole image being presented and the way it interacts with mouse movements is increasingly terrible.
---
I'm not saying that being able to see more shit is bad, the problem is that you also need to be able to precisely aim at that shit too.
---
What if I told you that Classic =/ foreign politics.  I'm playing a game here so I *don't* have to be thinking about the worlds problems.
---
No the epic nightsaber has armour on it, the rare level 40 ones are armourless nightsabers

---
The above macro will  cast Drain soul, replace X with your current rank, then delete the soulshard in the last bag slot of any soul-bag if there is one, so that you don't need to to keep track of them

I plan to go deep prot at 49 as soon as I can have 5/5 tac mastery plus shield slam on the way to the 11/5/35 build.

Ebay doesn't hold the goods in escrow during bidding the way that wow does. You have to allow for cancelling auctions because of things like mistakes. Sellers discover during an auction "Oh wait, shit, we don't even have one of those."
---
&gt;very well polished endgame content.
---
What?  Didn't they design MC in the last 2 weeks before release?
---
If I have a mage, I drink between every pull (I'm level a level 60 shadow priest that usually is healing, not super mana efficient). This actually results in the least downtime because I can drink while the tank pulls. But I also go through like 80-100 water depending on the length of the dungeon.
---
If I'm using my own drinks, I drink to full any time I'm below half mana. Using this method, I'd probably drink 40 or more depending on the length of the dungeon.
---
People were all already max level when the expansions released (for the most part) and it created two problems: it became impossible to find groups for the lower level dungeons without it some sort of dungeonfinder; and all of the new content being introduced was at the top end of the level cap. So it encouraged running through the levels as fast as possible, leaving other rerolls and alts to group with. The lfg tool was supposed to help fix that problem, but it had the side effect of dissolving the social network that the original game depended on. You no longer had to talk to people to organize groups. The real reason the game fell apart was that people were already at the end of the content and any new stuff introduced only made the problem worse. So their options were dungeonfinder (as a bandaid) or redesign the entire questing experience (cataclysm) in hopes of rekindling the low-level playerbase. Both of those failed miserably. I don't know what people expected them to do, but it seems like they didn't have any good options.
---
Just saw it.  You didn't really make an argument.
---
"You can buy the item so we get to ninja it" is your logic. 
---
 Need = i will equip
---
Greed = I want to sell it
---
Those are the rules.
---
Me and my buddy had a Jurassic park moment last night,  we were in un goro and it started pouring so hard you could barely see the mobs you're fighting 25 yards away, then out of nowhere comes a devilsaur and we were barely able to kill it. Really love the weather effects, adds alot of the feel of the game
---
Its virtue signaling when you say ‚ÄúBoycott china because they are bad‚Äù then in the same breath self admit to still using *some* chinese goods because they are necessary.
---
Except you always like your own post by default.. unless you downvote your own post. Nice try.
---
You need an Auction House add-on my friend.
---
Auctionator is a good minimalistic add-on. Makes the auction house what I believe it should have been from the start.
---
What I tell myself everyday is.
---
Damn I'm having way more fun then everyone else.
---
Can confirm.  At kennel 44 I am 155 ench with easily 200g with of mats sitting in the bank. I try to level it on making wands as much as possible,  but ummm in a no wand part of enchanting.
---
I thought 30-40 was the worst.  40-50 just comes after that so you're burnt out already.
---
Me either haha
---
Damn, I'm gonna have to start spamming dungeons to get that 350g + the gold for the mats.  Luckily I already won a pristine black diamond and had an azerothian diamond.
---
Better get on it before prices skyrocket.
---
I think I found out where they got the idea for Azerite Armor from
---
It doesn't make sense to NOT have reserved runs and here's why:  
---
If I'm forming a group for a specific item and reserves aren't allowed then I'll just stack the group with people who I KNOW can't use the item (i.e. I need bow from LBRS so I just stack casters). Unfortunately I won't be saying this in the LFG channel, instead I'll be just saying LFM LBRS and ignoring all the whispers from classes I don't need, even though a few of them probably don't need the bow.
---
If I'm forming a group for an item and I CAN reserve then I'll do the exact same thing as above. Only difference is now the people I would've rejected can now join as they know that this run has X item reserved and they don't need that item.
---
It's better for EVERYONE to allow item reserves, it's simply being more upfront with your intentions. The only exception is reserving stuff like orbs, as everyone is there for that for the most part. Even then though, it's still fine to me as you are communicating your intentions prior to the group joining (I reserve first orb regularly as tank).
---
I think its just called Killcounter :)
---
Your argument is its ok to need boes for gold, what point are you trying to make besides that?
---
I mean I never said I would become an avid player but I am trying it out. If 10,000 people try it and 1000 stay, GU is making a good move.
---
I see these posts and have to wonder how these rogues don't know to bleed/poison kite.
---
How bad is it to level as Holy? Healing dungeons is the only real fun I have, so I'd rather not go Shadow for leveling unless I absolutely have to. I still plan on doing a lot of quests, not exclusively dungeon-leveling.
---
I have my spells bound to asd and qer so alt, Ctrl, and shift are all super easy to reach. I only use w to move forward and steer with the mouse. On a warlock I use 1-9 for my pet bar. I can't believe people use any modifier keys with 1-9, my hands are way too small for that.
---
You can sort the auction house by each column by clicking on the column header you want to sort by. J believe with crafting items if you click on the header above where you are the stacks, it will sort smallest to largest. Then just click again and it will flip it to largest to smallest. Same for level of item and price. 
---
I'm not saying it's perfect, but it's a helluva lot easier than trying to get a million people to change their tactics.
---
Most people are who are 60 are likely trying to get BIS. You‚Äôre kind of stretching a bit now.
---
Buying them like everyone else.
---
We just play the game very differently is all, was just giving you my opinion.
---
Or good mages.
---
But he didn‚Äôt ask ‚ÄúDo Rets ever have fun?‚Äù 
---
He asked if they were viable. They aren‚Äôt.
---
Healers aren't going oom. Tank isn't holding aggro and they go on the healer. Your trying to analyze this and it won't work. I've played classic to 60 I'm radiing. All your referring to is the dps meters. I'm referring to a group of other things.
---
No, MC and Onyxia.
---
Forget criticism in 5 mans, you can do anything in a 5 man, do you. 
---
In raids, that's where meters and contribution matters...pally players only have one viable role there.
---
RemindME! 2 hours
---
As an alliance priest I've had to focus more on chain casting down ranked flash of light in order to snipe heals along with Paladins. I imagine horde priests dont have this issue.
---
If I want to top meters I'm basically a snipe bot but I also have to land prayer of healings.
---
I don't think there's anything wrong with it, but it still leaves a bad taste in my mouth for reasons that are tough to explain.
---
If I wanted to guarantee myself a piece of loot, I'd get the key(s), start my own group, and fill it with classes that wont roll against me.
---
I agree with the above post. My issue with DKP over loot council is that often gear goes to players who it is sub optimal on for the overall raid.
---
Take a look at warrior t1. Its 100% a tank set. Terrible stats for fury. Yet with dkp you might have a fury bidding on it just because its t1, leaving your tanks weaker and hindering your overall raid progression.
---
For a casual guild not concerned about progressing, dkp or /roll will probably work fine.
---
For a guild that is more semihardcore or hardcore, loot council in one form or another is almost a necessity.
---
My guild uses loot council. Each group (melee dps, caster dps, tanks, healers) has an officer appointed. Those officers discuss well ahead of a raid which items would be best on which players based on performance, attendance, use of consumables, current gear, and possible upgrade paths.
---
A spreadsheet is kept that shows who got what loot on what day so that no player ever goes long without recieving some loot.
---
It isnt a perfect system, but it has allowed our guild to progress at a good pace with minimal loot drama.
---
Just an fyi in about a week "DM" will mean dire maul. Most people shorten deadmines to VC for VanCleef, the last boss.
---
2 travelers backpacks, but nothing relevent tbh.
---
You bought it at a public auction which are setup differently to help the public who are entirely fucking brain dead and are a huge pain in the rear of any auto auction that‚Äôs why the majority are dealer only.
---
In a regular dealer auction no reserve is stated to the buyers, sold provisional is called an IF or a phone call and that‚Äôs mostly there if the person selling it isn‚Äôt there so the sales rep makes that decision, and the auction house reserve the right to cancel any sale for whatever reason so if you come to them and present why you don‚Äôt want to sell it they sure as hell can cancel the sale.
---
Hell till you get the title you don‚Äôt own shit
---
If you can easily solo devilsaurs and there isn't strong competition, I'd keep skinning. If you can't, there's really no reason to keep it. Pristine hide is rare enough that keeping it for it is completely silly.
---
RemindMe! 1/64 fortnight
---
People don't understand "before year ends" = december.
---
Its actually funny.
---
Speculation is all. I think more people *want* Classic+, but TBC seems more likely since it already exists. Spinning off a small team to re-master old content is MUCH more economical than building fresh stuff. It's very unlikely that Classic is bringing in enough new subscribers for Blizzard to double the size of their development team.
---
5120 is so 2018.
---
7,680x1,440 @ 144hz is the future. 
---
Also, if you play flight sim/space sim, go triple portrait mode for 4,320x2,560.  With curved monitors, it is glorious...
---
I don't mind having to get an add-on. I don't remember ever using an add-on on the past, but I only played up until the end of WotLK. I also don't remember this being an issue before, but I never usually sold mats in the AH. I usually have them to guildies, or saved them for alts. Any recommendation for a good AH add-on?
---
Ok, what about this?
---
https://i.imgur.com/TKBBLYt.png
---
It's the inkeeper house in gadget, is this considered exploiting? The guards doesn't attack me because i'm too far away from both of them.
---
I like loot council, but have seen it abused.  We were deep into Nax in Vanilla using it.  Some drama, but overall, not that bad.  Really helps if players trust each other and talk it over first. 
---
We've been doing some weird ass main spec roll, off spec roll if no one wants for main spec, +1 thingy.  Seems to work and gear gets spread around.  Except for the druid, being the only one in a raid he gets all the druid drops.  Though if a ring/neck drops, he'll likely not be able to roll until a few raids from now.
---
problem is still happening to me, have literally tried everything
---
I've played the same, since day 1.
---
Not sure where the bad rep for warriors comes in. I'm leveling my first warrior and he's hitting 30 soon. I'm having a blast. Do I die? Sure, but it's never boring.
---
A few things I do:
---
1. I use a 1H and shield that I keep somewhat up to date (got lucky with dungeon blues that last several levels + occasional trips to AH). The shield keeps your survivability up and I doubt a few dps increase by having a 2H at this point will help you too much.
---
2. Spend time leveling profs, questing, fishing - this will keep things fresh. Everything gets tiring if you do it for hours on end.
---
3. Run dungeons and tank often. Tanking is the most thrilling/exciting aspect of the warrior. And it's not too bad in early dungeons when you don't have to worry about mob mechanics so you can just practice maintaining threat.
---
Part of reddit too making all the quit posts doubly funny.
---
I'll take a look when I get home. Cheers.
---
You are right to put your foot down. 
---
Tangentially related though, morally questionable wow lifehack. I will advise everyone to become good friends with a hybrid spec druid in your guild. Got one who keeps 5 separate sets of gear (healing set, tanking set, feral dps, pvp set, a few caster pieces he got when no one else needed for memes, and a few swap in fire resist pieces.) Whenever you're short a tank or healer hit your boy up and ask nicely. He is mainly healing, but tanking when we need a 5th tank in MC.
---
Also just in general keep good tanks you run with on your friends list, the skill of the tank makes the biggest difference on how easy the run is. It's the difference between wiping three times on trash then giving up and speeding through without any deaths.
---
Part of this is because raids are "undertuned" compared to PServers, making content a lot easier. Mana preservation tactics will probably be a bigger deal in later patches, where the content is more difficult than 1.13 MC faceroll.
---
I've noticed that too, I'm casting flash heal *a ton* more than I should be in raids just because if I don't I'm at the bottom of the meters. Really, we should just put the meters away and focus on keeping people/mana up over HPS, but there's nothing else for healers to do right now so I think everyone is just spamming fast heals as fast as possible to pad stats. Like you said, if I sit there casting/cancelling heal/gheal, I'll never get one off.
---
I'm a proud ret paly.
---
I've been told that the less intensive list was added during TBC, haven't seen any proof as typical of this sub, but if true it'll be the harder of the 2.
---
Classic WoW is not based on the pre-patch so anything that was in the pre-patch is not in classic.
---
This just made my day. Some people can be so fucking annoying when worrying about what YOU are doing instead of going off to a different spot.
---
Perfect. Didn't realize I could type the spell. Thanks!
---
commenting to remind you to come back and remind yourself to save comments
---
20g is worth less than getting locked out of holy spells just because you wanted to cast your mount. So, no, not technically better.
---
Oh yes, It's only in a slightly convinient location. Y'know, a central position on the Eastern Kingdoms, and a stone's throw from Blackrock Mountain. Nothing major.
---
Option #2. The reduced mats is from tbc
---
Bro why would I list my Nightfin Soup for 20s/ea in stacks of 20, when I can list them in singles for 27s/ea, have them show up in a search sooner, and be more likely to sell?
---
&gt; What kind of abuse happens under DKP aside from blatant ninja?
---
i cant comment to that  
---
but some problems with DKP include things like wasted items and people skipping upgrades because they are saving for specific pieces.  
---
say someone is 2nd in DKP. are they going to take a absolutely minor upgrade that pushes them from 2nd in line for a huge upgrade(like a weapon) all the way down to 6th in line? they'll pass on the minor upgrade 99% of the time.  
---
then you run into the problems of 'forcing' items on people...  
---
guild doesn't want that minor upgrade to go to waste, but nobody will spend their precious DKP on it. How do you handle that?  
---
just messy all around.  
---
if you are in a guild that will abuse a council, they are doomed to fail, and you shouldn't be in that guild.
---
Find someone and trade with them. Bout all I can think of. 
---
Player A on Realm 1 wants money on Realm 2. Finds Player B on Realm 2 who wants money on Realm 1. 
---
A gives B money on 1 and B gives A money on 2. 
---
Obviously finding that situation is gonna SUUUUUCk.
---
All you do is say ‚Äúall you do is look at the meters‚Äù and ‚ÄúI saved my group‚Äù over and over, without actually providing any justification for bringing a ret pally over a holy.
---
Does it only drop if you have the quest active? I've been thinking about farming it but I don't have the leaf yet.
---
Not everyone plays on a PvP server or PvP's, and the vast majority of the time you wont be PvPing.
---
Ah... thanks.
---
I main druid, I'm obviously not meter obsessed.
---
But you're talking about bringing the literal worst dps...I won't bring oomkin and justify it with innervate and battle rex... it's still a bad build. 
---
You could be great at your class, fun to play with AND contribute more meaningfully.  It's not exclusive.
---
I had to stop when they started releasing shit that was like 2 generations past my experience with the game. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not playing Pok√©mon adventure app anymore. Everything is new and weird.‚Äù
---
I dont understand people who cancel their own auctions:
---
You put that item up there for that amount, now you dont wanna sell it for that amount?
---
People should be penalized for taking something off the AH - not just a fee to put an item up.
---
11/4/36 atm, might swap the point out of improved taunt to pop into cruelty when I start raiding proper, but the shorter cd on taunt is nice for dungeons.
---
and here I am mounting for a grind.
---
yeah i noticed after the update it does it on its own
---
It was a joke buddy
---
I prefer 8th and up.
---
I don‚Äôt think you understand what logic is.   You can buy the item, so the only reason you are rolling on it is to save the gold.  When you are rolling on gold, why shouldn‚Äôt everyone in the group be able to roll on gold?
---
Druid imo. You have tremendous solo capability, and like you said can stealth to bosses. So while a hunter may be able to out solo you by a slim margin, they have to clear a bunch of mobs and while rogues can also stealth to bosses, druids have superior solo capability.
---
No they don‚Äôt
---
No spells only
---
It's probably not as bad as having pallies in the raid but last night we had 7 priest healers, the raid was pretty good at avoiding damage so we were all stepping on each others toes and overhealing.
---
True that, got my friend who I can hit up to heal or tank any dungeon without any issue. Love me a good druid with hybrid spec.
---
im alliance and i sap people when they are skinning and then skin their devilsaurs
---
You also get a free fish (1344 hp) that is pretty useful for a number of levels :D I was eating them well into my 40s lol
---
Man I always get the door shutting .25 seconds before I get there.
---
i figured out how to hide every button with a macro except the "talents" button. Every time i open up the talent window the micro button reappears. Haven't figured out a solution for it yet.
---
They've definitely mixed up the spawns with well-timed migrations and regular events that introduce new/different species.
---
One of the best events that is put on once per month is a "Community Day" where a specific 'mon is selected and appears in ridiculous quantities for a few hours on that day. They usually get meta-relevant movesets that make them good contenders for your raiding or pvp lineups. 
---
Oh yea PvP is a thing now, too.
---
Yes and no.  Pallies provide an extra raid buff.  You generally don't want 4 holy pallies because if you have that you're not going to have an ideal healer composition.  They can also provide some utility like blessings to alleviate healer strain.  They make up for their lack of sheer dps with some utility.
---
A well geared boomkin with his party buff can make up for his lack of individual dps as well.  
---
When you combine that with the practical consideration that there are varying gear discrepancies in a group of 40 people you get to the point where in my opinion I would not call it straight up charity.
---
Also I looked it up, Klumpke bags are outsourced from Stormwind sweatshops and are only 5% cashmere.
---
Replying to you and the guy above.
---
The best build that I've seen for PvP is actually a 21/21/9 build that looks something like this: 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#cx0G0xxoZxqohtZ0xm
---
It gives you inimidate and scatter, a strong pet for casters and kiting melee, stun from conc shot, roots from wing clip (can spec 1 or two points into trap roots).
---
Essentially the most versatile spec for general PvP, if your plan is to backline snipe in AV or other BGs then a full MM build would fit better
---
Look at their penises.
---
Why the fuck would you take brutality blade
---
Poor rogues man
---
Yes your bis would be edgemasters but how long are you actually gonna keep brutality blade for is the question, it will probably not be worth buying just to replace it when you get a 2hander from rag(which is an upgrade for you now) or deathbringer from onyxia
---
Crazy thing is the logic behind the start of that movie isn't even wrong, and what plants wouldn't want brondo instead of water because of  electrolytes!
---
Different faction?
---
Still doesn't change how someone could "ninja" this trinket.
---
Usually the reduced XP is made up for in faster/smoother runs.
---
Major cities each train a few different types. Ask a guard for the weaponmaster.
---
As someone who got this back in Vanilla, the Trinket is really not that good for PvP. The furbolg that spawns doesn‚Äôt heal or lightning bolt for that much but he also has super low health. One cleave or AoE from any class is basically enough to take him down. Given how long the Cooldown is too, it‚Äôs just not really worth it.
---
All that being said, it‚Äôs a prestige item and very fun to use once or twice a raid for kicks. Also, I bet you got some tells when your boss announced what a great guy you are eh?
---
pfft I just do it in dungeons...usually max out within half a dungeon
---
PvE server and my buddy's guild ran MC for the first time last night and only had 2 rogues. 9 Mages, 6 Priests, 4 Locks though so caster drops were highly contested.
---
What I dislike most about retail is the fact that all races share similar attack animations. Really took away some of the uniqueness of the classes.
---
Can't recommend it myself. At one point at like level 32 it had me grind 5 bars to level which is perfectly reasonable. Then you do like 4 quests and it says now you should be level 34, if not then grind the rest of the way. I was barely two bars into 33.
---
1-30 was smooth sailing but some later parts seem incomplete or not as much effort was put into them.
---
Need to farm 400 gold, where the hell shall I farm
---
I like the hybrid sets you can tell they're like "We don't really know how you're going to function in raids, so here's literally every stat"
---
You can do cloth turn ins for any major faction.
---
At least boomkin brings a spell crit buff. It may not be worth it in the long run, but at least it's something, anything, that you can bring that another class or spec doesnt. The only thing ret brings is a piss poor analogy about forests and trees.
---
nothing

I'd add a few points:
---
- Fish Deviate Fish in the Barrens. If you are Alliance, it should well in the AH. In my server (Kromcrush), they sell for 10s each fish. This should give you 5g ~ 6g per hour
---
- Don't forget the Vendor Addon to check quest rewards. Usually weapons vendor for more
---
- Run SM many times (any of the 4 wings). I make 1g ~ 2g per run usually
---

Turned 40 with 107g with minor effort and no gold making farming in mind. In total, i probably fished for no more than 5 hours

This makes so much sense now

I want a list of all mobs

Not sure how good the people are but Mograine has a very large population and is balanced on Alliance and Horde
---
Hitcap is 9% with 300 skill, and 6% with 305 skill.
---
You go 20-31.
---
Best pet is cat.
---
If you're a class that can solo princess you can get 4 blindweed and 1.5 ghost mushrooms on average. On my server this adds ~3g per run to farm :D
---
Ret just has no damage for anything that isn't a demon or undead. Ret will be good in Naxxramas but as for everything else it just doesn't compete. There arent meters because this was well known since 2006 my dude.
---
&gt;Have any of you felt fatigue with your chosen class so far into the leveling process?Did you push through it or end up sticking with an alt?
---
Yes, it's the wall.  Hits between lvl 45-55 for several classes that I've played.
---
&gt;Any 60 Warriors who play solo and have a good time wPvPing with no pocket healer?
---
You'll have a good time.  Not as much of a good time as with a healer.  Played right, a warrior can wreck a group of casters even without a healer.
---
&gt;If I choose Druid to commit my time to and end up tanking again, do you find "bad" groups easier to manage than Warrior tanking?
---
A Bad group is a bad group regardless of how you cut it.  If you're in a tanking position, you will feel the same pain.
---
&gt;Issues getting consistent groups as a Rogue?
---
Yes, you're DPS, and not ranged DPS.  Building a group, my order of preference would be Tank+Healer+Warlock/Mage+Hunter+One other DPS.
---
If you're having bad groups as a warrior, I'd recommend making sure you're not missing anything on tanking (rarely are, but just be sure), find a good healer and one DPS with solid CC (Mage or Warlock) who you work with well, and team up with them for instance runs, then build out from there.
---
I prefer my old ones. New Boss? 3 sentences or less explanation and then charge. Then fix stuff as it comes up until boss dead. Worked up to AQ 40 pretty well and kept the pace going.
---
&gt;takes any role for his party
---
You heal.
---
Is it really a "bad meta" if it works though?
---
whats that kill tracker addon?
---
Lol you seriously got brutality blade as an orc
---
As a priest healer, I never had to drink in an instance until Uldiman unless something went wrong (multiple packs, DPS getting agro, etc)
---
After that, I‚Äôd typically drink every 4-5 packs. 
---
At 60 now and fairly well geared, i might drink 3-5 times in an instance.
---
If it's recount it's broken down for me when you hover over my name. Shows the percent of damage that my pet is doing of the shown DPS. Other than that I don't know of an option.
---
Not trolling. Maybe better wording would have been, "WoW was THE game for hardcore **players.**" The game *itself* wasn't particularly hardcore, but it was still the title of choice for the majority of l337 gamer types. WoW was basically the Fortnite of its day; simple and accessible, but taken very seriously by a lot of people.
---
&gt;Just remember, if your targeting the mob that dodged you then you switch targets, and switch back you will not be able to overpower that mob anymore.
---
Wasn't aware, that sucks but thanks for the amazing WA!
---
I don't play the game for loot. I play to have fun with my friends getting loot is just a consequence of that.
---
Warrior definitely feels super fun in some wPvP situations... but not going to lie, it most of the time feels like theres absolutely nothing you can do. When a frost mage ganks you, you just die, it doesnt matter how good you are.
---
     Druid I have found to be the opposite. Hunters and warlocks are a bit rough but druid has one of the highest skill caps for pvp in the game. You have so many tools at your disposal, your class is underplayed (good thing imo), and underrated. Leveling as a druid is pretty nice. You can heal, tank, or dps pretty effectively with one spec (heart of the wild) and you can even find a raid spot as a tank in MC. Leveling is also quicker and far less frustrating as a druid, particularly after you gain access to cat form at 20. 
---
I have gotten to 57 on my warrior and swapped to a different class and I have been thoroughly enjoying it. Sometimes you have to get to a higher level before you're sure it's the right one. So I would say go for it if you want to try something else. At worst it's a break from your warrior and the struggle, and you'll be a bit more behind then catch up quick enough. Good luck!
---
So, Loot Council, in theory, is a fantastic way to ensure the appropriate person gets the appropriate gear.
---
Loot Council, in practice, well....considering the human condition, I would leave a guild that did Loot Council exclusively.  Just flat up leave.  I'm not going to deal with that bullshit.
---
I think it would actually be REALLY fun to completely embrace some of the wacky specs that sort of worked in Vanilla.
---
Melee Survival Hunter
---
Tank Enhance Shaman
---
Tank Warlock
---
DPS Disc Healer
---
Oh, I carried that train wrecker with me always for that reason. As soon as the train came out, I ruined it:)
---
My bad you're right. I meant Suicide Kings, not ZeroSum.
---
The fee... is the penalty
---
I didn't say anything about food. Crafting materials. Like ore and cloth.
---
Brut blade is the offhand that goes with Deathbringer and he will keep that combo until BWL.
---
It does :)
---
I /pray everytime I see a purple boi run in for some hellfire action.
---
Why‚Äôs it such a big deal?
---
It seems that's true for Classic also. Can't find any MPQ files.
---
PWS as an emergency to land a big heal is FINE. Priests shouldn't be afraid to use this in an instance because of a few posts about precasting it prior to a pull.  (which you shouldn't do)
---
In the context of the story that was being told, it sounds like the tank went down and he was commenting that the priest didn't PWS him. Somewhere else in the comments, the OP states that there were two adds up and the healer probably didn't realize the tank would be taking more damage than he had the whole fight. It sounds like a PWS may have helped, but both you and I were not there, just inferencing from screenshots and comments.
---
I've "Oh Shitted" bubbled a tank before landed my big heal and everything is fine, but honestly thats not what the crux of the argument was about at all.
---
Yeah, fighting toons 25+ levels below you! For the horde!
---
You haven't gotten to 90g? Are you buying all your skills?
---
This is solid advice, only thing I'd change is pre-swapping to shield for bashes to avoid the in-combat gcd.
---
Tossing sunders in here and there doesnt hurt (especially before ms/bt and ww, and doubly so if they wear a shield)
---
Was just memeing, you can make a lot of gold in zf right now if you‚Äôre a mage
---
You already paid that to put the item up, there should be an ADDITIONAL fee.
---
This is a horrible spec lol
---
Thanks alot for this, really helps me
---
Terrible rule imo. Some people deserve a witch hunt. Just no real life hunting.
---
Definitely the middle one.  It looks shifty.
---
Only two things tbh.
---
Arenas and Spell Reflect (one of the most hilariously fun abilities ever)
---
You're really hung up on something so insignificant, that was being only slightly argued for.
---
It‚Äôs just bad text, what it does is passively generates rage at all times, this value is less then the normal decay of rage so your rage decays slower. Then in combat with no decay you get passive rage
---
"Click on totem, then click another"
---
The ones with 1c bid and a normal to high buyout prey on people who sort by bid and just buyout whatever they see first. I have been bidding around 80% of what the items are worth and some of these sellers have gotten pretty mad at me.
---
What else do you want me to say? I cast blessing of wisdom on the priest? Or salvation on dps that don't understand aggro? How about that healer who wasn't paying attention and now I'm going to bop him so aggro is dropped. Dps isn't going very well cast bom on them. Bad situation lay on hands. Follow buy my mass collection of repairs bots if you ever needed. Followed by I'm never late to a raid. But meters bro. Not the wipe and then 5 minute run back. We tested it and I was put into a group of rogues and we out damaged the other 5 rogues in their own group during boss fights with my blessings. So 5 rogues vs 4 rogues and a paly. That group with the paly is stronger. That's crazy right how this little ret paly brings out 4 rogues better then a group of 5. But the meters. Followed back in the day on nef I was always top 3 on dps. But meters
---
I am an adult.
---
I'm not gonna pretend I've done any analysis of the numbers on this.  If you have a link to anything I'd love to review.
---
Weren't Undead players initially susceptible to anti-undead tech like Shackle, Turn, Exorcism, etc?
---
Christ, the alliance players even replied to this saying they had a blast. Get over yourself.
---
Why on earth would you need that deep prot?
---
Lashers as prot is your only real option sadly. (Beyond DM:E jump runs with a partner or Tribute but not as fast!)
---
You get caught up pretty quickly because no one is competing for your gear. All you're missing out on is progression.
---
You get the fee back if someone buys it though.
---
TBF some classes were really fucking bad at release.  Paladins for example saw several revamps on their Seal/Judgment system
---
Really? That's too bad.
---
Are you exploiting pathing or self promoting your MS Paint Art under the guise of asking questions that have been answered in your thread? That said I‚Äôll take 3 prints because I love the Tauren representation
---
That's not how it works. If you have 100% dodge you can't get hit. There's a video of a rogue solo'ing Gruul with a druid keeping up insect swarm and the hunter keeping up w/e sting it is. If you have 99% dodge you don't magically lose dodge as you dodge more.

---
a bubble and a renew for you sir
---
I actually kinda want this as a tattoo.
---
If phase 2 was going to take 3-4 months, then Naxx would be coming out in 2022. I don't think you had that much time.
---
Most people want, sage fish, eels, winter squid, blackmouth, or the mats that drop out of chests off the top of my head.
---
Look at your local auction house what is selling.
---
Lol, right.  Well anyway, when someone goes full Dunning-Kruger on me, I typically bow out.  Feel free to get the last word, I won't be seeing it either way :) Muted.
---
&gt;How is it dealing with such a large market?
---
Idk about the Horde side of things, but Herod Alliance stays around 25k listings or more and its 100% a buyer's market. Commodity items like ore, buff food, etc are a pain in the ass to sell because you often will be undercut within 5-10 min of listing your auctions in my experience. 
---
Tho it's been pretty excellent for the twinking crowd, those that are getting prepared at least. Picked up a [Staff of Jordan](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=873/staff-of-jordan) for 70g and [Shadowblade](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=2163/shadowblade) for 18g, yesterday. Kang is going for like 50g, etc. So if you've got the capital right now, super servers are awesome for investing in BoEs for P3.
---
RemindMe! 2 minutes
---
Yep, and then you'll have to do a few months of pre-bis grinding, then another few months of weekly MC raids, followed by another few months in BWL, AQ, Naxx, etc. If they follow a 5 week content cycle with phases released every 10 weeks or so, you won't see most of the  Classic raid content before it's already obsolete.
---
Didnt shamans have a mass invisibility totem suggested in early builds of vanilla?
---
As far as I'm aware its just Killcount.
---
Read my other comment.
---
that's how it should have been
---
Why would people but wow tokens, when they can go to gold selling sites and get much more gold for their money?
---
Why do you need to swap stances all the time? Just go DW fury prot with piercing howl. These low-threat/damage prot builds only makes it harder for new warriors to tank.
---
If you min-max the gain your raid as a whole gets stronger. If your raid as a whole gets stronger you clear faster and easier. It also means that the next drop of that item goes to the best guy next in line. As obviously the same guy can't grab multiple of the same drop.  
---
Guilds are teams and as a team oriented player I just want whats best for the group.
---
Didnt watch vid but i can tell it was awesome. I would like yo do something similar to this with a group of good guildies and friends. Love the fireworks.
---
What‚Äôs the difference?
---
For a new fight yea go more in depth but when you have mc on farm and the raid leader still over explains a fight it‚Äôs kinda redundant
---
Get the ah addons. Otherwise enjoy classic.
---
Probably shaman and I say this as a resto druid. The edge druid has on sham is that they are overall I think harder to kill in pvp with cheetah form but a resto sham has windfury and adds an armor bonus to the warrior making him harder to kill. Although I would say druid is a bit more fun to play in general, but thats just my opinion.
---
Throw some atiesh/val'anyr type legendaries in each one and watch them clear it for months trying to make them.
---
"I'm going to log onto my favorite massively multiplayer online game tonight and get mad when another player who is playing this massively multiplayer online game is playing the game."
---
I found that the WoWhead Classic site had decent lists.
---
Two problems with it:
---
1. It's not for twinks, so the price is lower than if it had been a lvl39 piece of gear.
---
2. Lvl 40 = mount. For many players, that's the entirety of their money gone. 
---
I'd actually start the bidding at 5 and buyout at 9. Personally I'd bid on it at that price, but someone else would probably buy it outright.
---
Yeah. IIRC, they were considered "Undead" and not "Humanoid" which did all of that but also made them immune to things like fear and poly

---
Main problem arise when the guild want to make the maintank Fury/prot. Giving it dps and tankgear. This messes Up the dkp or epgp.
---
So whenever you cancel an auction you have to pay up to two penalties:  
---
1. posting fee  
---
2. a percentage of the current bid that is placed on your item ( I believe this is 5% of current bid?)
---
I don't really know? The guards doesn't move, so there is no pathing, when you move too much to the side they will definitely attack you regardless of where you are.
---
Hunter or Priest? Or maybe a Warlock?
---
I mainly played DK since MoP. Blood DK made a lot of soloing for me possible, also i just liked the class fantasy, WotLK ( I started WoW in the end of it.) and being a Melee who can deal some range damage. I'm someone who doesn't really raid but rather do BGs and other PvP stuff. I'm a solo casual pleb and i've never been really in a guild. Sadly classic has no DKs.
---
I really want to play classic and focus only on one class to get somewhat good at it and here is my problem. 
---
At first i was thinking to play a Warlock since they are a bit edgy like the DKs, also WL are tough and a great at solo play but it looks like a lot of ppl play WL in classic and WL seems to be gear dependent from raids so i was looking at the Hunter who shares somewhat the pros and cons. I also heavy eyeballing to the priest class. I've played 1 Hunter and 1 Priest to LV15 in classic and i enjoyed both so far, Hunter for the obvious solo capability and being a priest is fun since i can heal and shield other players i've randomly met and doing quest with them together. The feeling of being useful and welcome is great.
---
I like them both, i think Hunter would fit me the best (Solo casual pleb) but being a priest is a lot of fun so far, also SPriest seems to be a badass spec even though they are not really viable in PvE as it seems, but i heard they are good in 1v1 PvP and have some fun CC. I think i wouldn't mind to play a healer. Or should i play a Warlock?
---
I also have to add that i'm really casually in classic, maybe 2-3h a day and more on the weekend.
---
Thanks if you read this wall of text and can help me out.
---
I always though the dwarfs said "intrested on a fight" when i was young and innocent and didnt know what a pint was!
---
lol...
---
i dont farm any of the hides. i actually spend most of my time on LW in trade buying hides. even if you pay for mats, eliminating farming makes so much more gold. how many hides do you get an hour killing things at 60? a kill / 30 sec = 120 hides = not even 10g, when I can work trade and craft LW items for 40-50G a hour. some items make me 20g profit and some sets 30-40g profit, what is the point of killing beast? lol
---
I remember reading about that. I guess that's where the retail worgen "running" thing came from. I don't remember what they call it.
---
Hi there,
---
was just read of a similar issue in another thread. Seems to have found a fix:
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dfjq62/constant\_crashes\_seemingly\_after\_last\_windows/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dfjq62/constant_crashes_seemingly_after_last_windows/)
---
Indeed. Some of us are old enough to remember watching Tianamen Square happen, live.  China is really hoping it can get Hong Kong off the front page of world news, so they can send in the army and start killing to break the protests. Then everyone involved with the protests who is still alive will find themselves shipped to concentration camps to work at hard labor for the rest of their short lives, or until some oligarch needs an organ transplant.
---
Tiananmen Square Massacre, June 4-5, 1989.
---
Fulan Gong suppression, 1999. 
---
Hong Kong, NOW.
---
Taiwan is an independent, sovereign nation (added just to annoy any PRC shill out there).
---
Blizzard is kowtowing (how appropriate!) to a gang of lawless Maoist butchers with a long, long history of bloody oppression and of looting and booting foreign companies that do business with them.  What could possibly go wrong?
---
Some items can be listed for free/cheaper when it's as a single item. In the case of linen it's free.
---
People are getting offended by this post? Why the fuck
---
I am indeed subtlety! You kinda' have to be to farm these Junkboxes but it's also a great PvP spec which I enjoy from time to time.
---
Now that we have context you shouldn't feel bad.
---
The issue is that rogues can't use axes at all while Orc warriors benefit immensely from them. 
---
Rogues have two options of swords until BWL and one of them is a 2% droprate off Onyxia.
---
For context of Brutality went to an Orc fury warrior in my guild where all the rogues beat all the warriors in DPS, you'd have 5 rogue that would be probably gquit on the spot
---
Its not harder, like I said its an inconvenience
---
&gt; TBF some classes/specs were a big fucking mess at release. 
---
Thats an understatement. As much as I'd wished Classic gave us a true vanilla experience, I dont miss a lot of the disastrous designs that existed during its growing pains.
---
Deleted D3 characters, uninstalled D3, deleted WoW characters, uninstalled Wow, uninstalled [battle.net](https://battle.net), couldn't delete account because Blizzard required me to post a picture of my government ID online (Gee, what could go wrong!).
---
Luckily, there are thousands of games in the world that I haven't played yet. Time to move on.
---
Dude, you like money too? 
---
We should hang out.
---
lol i encountered the guy named ''whitebeard'' earlier today near desolace
---
one thing i would look forward to in classic + content is voice acting i really wonder if they are gonna voice act every single spoken dialogue during quest and raids
---
I have tried numerous times to explain to people that twink gear is not worth shit right now because there are no battlegrounds and so twinking is a waste of time but everyone sees blue and just assumes they are going to make sooo much money because blues used to sell for a lot of money back in the day. Market is supply and demand...there is no demand and plenty of supply...what you can do is take advantage of people with scripts by pricing it about 30% lower than the next one and it will most likely get snapped up and reposted by someones script. I personally have a rule, if it doesnt sell within 2 times on auction it gets equipped or given to guild for free. Your guild gaining power and remembering your name is in your best interest.
---
It's totally different to ilevels in retail, they are barely the same system.    
---
In classic, they are a baseline to determine numbers, but stat and effect diversity basically mean the ilevel of most items are irrelevant to its strength, when determining near/BiS items for each class.    
---
In retail, the normalization and generic stats on every single item enforce ilevel to almost always be relevant.
---
Maybe. Seems like it would be a nightmare to balance, though.
---
I don't think there's a deposit for a single linen cloth.
---
This. So much this. It's pretty terrifying to [see sooo many companies cowing to Chinese censorship pressure](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/dfc6qi/disneyowned_espn_forbids_discussion_of_chinese/f32iio0). It's literally a matter of time before it continues to spread and encroach more and more on our lives. A Marriott employee got fired for liking a tweet the Chinese government didn't like, for fuck's sake. 
---
Now I know this isn't anything new with corporations putting profits before ethics, but it blows my mind how short sighted it is. Do they not realize that all big companies in China answer completely to their government? It isn't like it is in the US or EU, where their money can buy them leniency or even straight up free passes on crooked behavior. The government *owns* **you** in China, not the other way around. XI conducted massive crackdowns on businesses there that had grown so wealthy that they were bribing government officials for favors. Some of the businesses were just straight up taken over, and some of the businessman and government figures straight up disappeared. How can these non-Chinese companies be so stupid as to think they'll somehow be immune to this shit in the long run if it continues going the way it has been?
---
They weren‚Äôt originally. I brought a few to Stormwind back in the day, they just killed guards and foolish players for a while until finally they ran out of combat.
---
Sadly the King will never aggro them in any circumstances.
---
devilsaurs are waste of time compared to playing AH + crafting LW/ALCH/tailor.
---
Did you have to move around every now and then to avoid an AFK logout while smelting?
---
any? think we had over 40 on last night who were 60 and prob close to 20 more between 55-60
---
I'm not really sure, I think that sounds tougher but I've not looked into it for classic. I'd love to get some of the harder ones.
---
Wow you're dumb.

---
That's a Lesser
---
What is there to explain? That's what they're created for, no?
---
Just try to be the deep frost guy (winter's chill spec) for the raid and you can get away with having extra points in imp blizz/imp CoC. 
---
However, I know like only like 3-4 of the 7 mages that run in my guild are using arcane power frost, 2 are WC and 1 is just still the shatter deep frost build and does just fine dmg, albeit less than some of the others but its not too bad. The raids are so easy right now with proper gear that it hasn't hindered anything.  If your guild doesn't mind, you can do a mostly ST deep frost spec that has room for the AOE talents.
---
Everything is a competition. People like this are exhausting to deal with. You can't enjoy any normal activity without them trying too hard and gloating if they perceive themselves having done anything "better" than anyone else. And then getting massively butthurt over things no one was even paying attention to or cared about.
---
You guys are ridiculous.
---
It's literally an extra second of clicking on your realm... lmao.
---
I cringe when I see a lot of them.  This one is bad.  Some can actually be funny.  That goes for most memes though.
---
Sounds a lot like EverQuest. They had loss of EXP on death. To the point that you could de-level from it. 
---
I remember leveling in the Lake of Ill Omen as a Cleric. Level 28, then level 27, then 28 again, and immediately 27, then 28, 29, 28, 29, 30. That shit was brutal.
---
True, I guess I didn‚Äôt think you would be interested in hearing it. 
---
Judging from your comment the only reason you are running LBRS is for a crossbow. If that one piece of loot is really the only reason why you are running it I can see where you would try to form a group and reserve that drop. 
---
I myself want all the loot as well to better my character but that‚Äôs not why I play. I enjoy meeting new people. I like running through dungeons and finding new ways to beat it. I like helping others, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm almost always a Healer. 
---
If I run LBRS 3 times and don‚Äôt feel like doing it again I‚Äôm not going to just because I still need a drop. I will do something else and try it again some other time.
---
Everything is a waste of time compared to just plain playing the AH.
---
It is 3 dungeons like sm is 4 dungeons. It's the same zone and 1 dungeon. I also didn't count lbrs and ubrs separately or live strat/dead strat. So if you want to get extremely semantical sure, it's 3 dungeons that dps need 1 of the 3. East will get ran for the thorium sure but there is no physical dps going into west. So really it's 1 zone physical dps go into for 1/3 of their gear. DM N contains like 6 physical dps upgrade that eliminates other zones. So if you want say it that way sure 1/10 of the 60 dungeons contains 1/3 the loot. That's way better
---
Pointless comment, why bother automating anything if it only takes x seconds to do that thing non automated.
---
You can just Alt+P when on Netflix or YouTube when using Chrome.
---
It's not the true classic experience,  use to only have to hit enter as your last played realm  was always selected.
---
lol relax dude
---
eye of the storm.
---
They got XP values wrong and that stuff was easy to get too, so... 
---
Also nothing stopping blizz from just reigning back the income for that specific farm.
---
Any game company with a clue will stay the fuck out of the Chinese market, or just sell the license as a one-time deal, so they aren't beholden to Chinese interests. The PRC has a long history of inviting in foreign "partners", getting them to do the expensive work on their own dime, then taking the foreign partner's IP and assets in China and booting them out.
---
China is a classic fascism--Chinese corporations are all government-controlled and owned. If you do business with one, you're in bed with the PRC government, and they like to dom without safewords.

Other comments have explained some of the issues, but ive done a princess run with one so it can still work up to that point. I net it could work in some brd runs with limited aoe pulls too.
---
Both of your intended specs are quite low on DPS for killing mobs.  There really isn't a reason to not go the normal leveling spec aka shadow/ret.  You can heal/tank just fine in leveling dungeons and go through quest mobs with ease.
---
Cloaks were going to have different armor types (plate, mail, leather, cloth) they scraped it at the last second though and made them all cloth. That's why all cloaks show up now under cloth in the AH
---
I'm playing combat swords, I'm almost 60 I don't really care at this point was just saying I literally haven't even seen a piece of leather drop in dungeons that is usable.
---
I reset my cache, WTF, and interface folders and it's now fixed.
---
Pvp resillience should've never been a thing. PVP and PVE gear should have the same type of stats on them, otherwise those aspects of the game become too separate.
---
There is a quest in Felwood that  has you kill some owlkin in Winterspring. When you turn it in it sends you back to kill a different type. At level 59, I grinded the hell out of those owlkin in Winterspring.  They are level 56 to 58 and drop fast.  I also made about 20g in drops from there.
---
I've had similar issues. A lot of rogues seem to get really weird about attacking a marked mob. Don't wanna risk a wasted combo point because they need #1 dps, not #1 team player.
---
Runs like the one you describe usually stress me out and put me off tanking for a day or two. Best thing to do is to note which DPS is actually good and make friends with them. Same as people do with tanks, but having a DPS or 2 you can reliably dungeon with without worry makes a big difference.
---
Again if you have it on farm, ON FARM, you don‚Äôt need to spend 20 mins explaining a fight
---
Biggest difference as a warrior is from 40-50 you have mortal strike or bloodthirsty. Before 40 your rage dump is sunder armor which is very boring.
---
Isn't the staff from ZF better than the hypnotic blade + off hand? It has the same spell power bonus but better everything else?
---
How many fishing poles did you get?
---
As someone who only played vanilla and has returned for that nostalgia, this is how I remember it. I was already in epic pieces and here came another tier 0 dungeon but it should have been released way sooner. I was confused to hear that it wouldn't be available when classic was launching, sounded like people screaming #nochanges were also saying "repeat past mistakes!"
---
Except that they changed Reckoning
---
Every1 saying 'swords &gt; daggers' unconditionally is basing it off private servers or online guides. After seeing the damage difference over a few raid nights, most of our rogues swapped to daggers and now do consistently higher dps numbers. Sure daggers might not beat dalrend combo, but with aged core leather it's really competitive.
---
Wheres redbeard?!
---
But you can sure stock up on the mats for it and get ahead of the game. 100 goddamn arcanite bars per tfury.
---
Damn I wasnt aware of all these disadvantages :\
---
Those agility enchants will be bank.
---
Well, 50s a pop, but still got like 20 of them.
---
And I hope you have a nice day, too.
---
Indeed, warrior at 60 is very satisfying but getting there isn‚Äôt
---
Loved that route, BE prot pally was so OP back in that day too that I had no issues mining where and how much I wanted in WG
---
No it is possible on details, it just doesn't show up separately. Hover over your name and it will tell you how much damage is from your pet, probably as pet auto attack and abilities separated. Just add them together.
---
pretty sure it has something to do with "events". Every time the talent window opens this "event" is causing it reappear. Anyone know how to disable that in classic?
---
Edgy
---
Then people need to be prohibited from listing hundreds of items at qty 1 each.  How can anyone find the volume they need or price compare if the only listing for linen is 500 pages of 1 linen at outrageous prices?
---
Its unintended.
---
ye I am using it, thx
---
Exactly.
---
I never played new rs but I heard that system actually worked well
---
This is why you shouldn't enter the PRC market. Also, eventually, they'll loot your IP and assets and kick you from the country anyway.
---
MANY WHELPS. LEFT SIDE.
---
"Ye got ma attention"
---
I was in the same boat as you, unfortunately the best advice I can give is ‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt beat them, join them‚Äù. Install an AH add-on which is able to quickly sift through all those single auctions posted. 
---
(I personally use Auctioneer)
---
I believe it's just 50-60, but a funny thought.
---
BRD and it's not so much tanking as grouping them up for the mages to AOE them as well as taunting and bringing mobs that resist spells back into the group.
---
I remember a video of a hunter (not pet) tanking nefarian back in classic.  Imp. Aspect of the monkey and lots of odd buffs and enchants things got to crazy high Dodge rates and health pools.
---
BC was a great time for it; my guild let me try to tank Shahraz in BT at one point, was a blast.
---
Grind while walking from quest to quest,  do quests 3 levels below you for fast completion.
---
Honestly Rule 5 can go die in a fire while Blizzard is pulling shit like this.
---
/r/classicwowplus 
---
But yeah this is nothing new, literally everyone who has talked about this has said they should add the OSRS 75% voting system if they do classic+ content at all.
---
I‚Äôm sorry for both of you.
---
That doesn‚Äôt work. You do realize blizzard added in LFG and LFR because it was requested by a significant part of the community right?
---
this is true! didnt even think of that,
---
That ended up becoming my favorite zone because of how often I was farming saronite there.
---
Hey, will I get banned here, too, for calling out shills? Just asking.
---
Deep prot for endgame dungeons. I'll probably switch to fury tanking when I have the right gear but as of now I'm undergeared and underleveled
---
I decided on Mage.
---
I like the aesthetic of constantly drinking (named it Sumeragi, after the alcoholic waifu from Gundam OO) more than being a mage with guyliner.
---
Yep, I remember that bracket when DKs came out in WOTLK. Hilarious! Alterac Valley was just 80 Death Knights gripping each other across the battlefield.
---
Because a lot of players have played a ton, with most of their free time since release and havent hit 60 yet. So if you compare that to all the players with families, long work hours, social obligations there are a ton (I'd bet good money that it's the majority) of people still in the 40-59 range. 
---
Hell I no-lifed harder for the start of classic than I ever had before. Slept 3 hours a day the first week, napped then logged in at 11pm to play all night until work the second week, stopped going to the gym since release... and I just hit 50! I've fallen off really hard since then because work has really picked up and I've been really busy with my family and friends on weekends and I really needed to get in some gym time in. But if I did that and arent max, I would think there are more players at mid level than max level.
---
I mean shit it's only like a month after release.
---
The real discrimination is "sorry we're only looking for Mages to AOE for this dungeon."
---
I just 2h tank dungeons with my arms warrior and end up tanking plus doing 1/3 of my parties total dps.
---
Day of rope you are die westerner
---
They organize *some* of their behavior around their principles. Nobody who is cancelling their WoW subscription is going to give up their iPhone or stop shopping at Target or Walmart. They're going to keep sending gobs of money to China, regardless or whatever principles they might have.
---
That was my point.
---
&gt; Never bid on stuff just use buyout. 
---
Great solution on people abusing the bid system.
---
Alright, that makes sense, I can see how having split-second precision would make a difference for someone with a high mechanical proficiency. I'm still very new to the game (only started when Classic came out last month) so I think it might take me a while to get to the point where it would give me much benefit. I'm always kind of hesitant to use mods of any kind for most games, but I know a lot of people swear by add-ons in WoW so I've been trying to look into them a bit more. But like you said, a lot of screenshots/videos on this sub are just atrocious (not even just limited to auto-shot timers, I've seen a ton of different add-ons that make the interface look awful) so that hasn't helped me much in trying to be more open-minded about them. I might try out Quartz and see how I like it. 
---
If you have any other suggested add-ons that are super helpful without making the interface look terrible I'd definitely appreciate it.
---
My guild does loot council. Before launch everyone made a weighted wish list with items in order of how much they wanted them. Then once raiding started everything from attendance, performance, enchants, and especially spot on your wish list, etc... is taken into account. Most gear is spoken for before it even drops and in the case of ties it goes to a roll off between a few people.
---
There is one guild member (melee dps) who's SO is on the loot council. Due to that conflict of interest, that officer does not make any decisions when it comes to melee loot, but still makes informed decisions on caster, ranged, healer, and tank loot. 
---
There have only been about 2, what seemed to be controversial calls, but when these happened the decision was fully explained, and in the end justified.
---
I fully trust these guys, but only because they have been completely transparent and so far honorable about all gear assignments.
---
The secret is that, that is the only way you can survive in the vacuum of space.
---
DW Fury/Prot is lower threat/damage than prot builds until you're at close to 30% crit . You'll end up taking more damage, but without good Flurry uptime you'll have to decide between stacking Sunders and never getting a Bloodthirst off, or using Bloodthirst and being behind on threat. 
---
You need have really solid gear and be totally comfortable in the tanking role, otherwise you're better off with deep Prot.
---
It's big true my guy
---
You know exactly how that is going to do.
---
75% will vote in favor of it.
---
The 25% will spam reddit about how it isn't fair and threaten to quit the game.
---
Blizzard will cave and then just not put it in anyway.
---
I got cussed out for "stealing" a devilsaur from a hunter apparently lol.  Devilsaur wasn't in combat, freely walking, no hunters mark on, pet wasn't even on its way to attack, I didn't even see the hunter until like 8 secs into fighting when he walked up to me and /spit on me.  He said a friend had it rooted, I was like dude it wasn't rooted it was walking undamaged, untagged, not in combat, no one around lol.  Good times.
---
When I was in vanilla we used a system called AP.  Arisen Points, which was the name of our guild.
---
It was basically a bank of points you accrued over time and then all items were a blind bid using those points.
---
It was heavily skewed towards progression raids giving the most.  If I remember correctly it was 1 point per farm status boss killed, and 10 per hour of progression raiding.  We also had standing bounties on raid consumables.  
---
I thought it was pretty awesome, we had quite the arms race for Ashkandi which was eventually won by a ret paladin.
---
Stratholme rats parry me all the time. Like, come on.
---
&gt;Sure daggers might not beat dalrend combo, but with aged core leather it's really competitive.
---
Kinda weird that your comparison is still dungeon weapons beating out raid gear to show that daggers can be competitive. If you replace rends with Viskag/Brutality Blade the difference is *way* bigger than using daggers, it's simply that the fury warrior meta has pushed a lot of rogues into just dealing with using daggers.
---
r/magicthecirclejerking would like to know your location
---
Keep classic as a time capsule and fix retail.
---
Do you cook the fish or no? I have stacks of raw but was trying to get recipe (low pop server and haven‚Äôt seen it listed on AH yet).
---
I've experienced the opposite, where someone joins a group and then when we are actually at the dungeon they pull "Me? No no no. that other guy said he was going to heal"
---
As someone who lives in the East Bay, for real lmao.
---
Update your graphics and audio drivers, I had this problem to and that fixed it
---
Oh just saw you did some drivers already... good luck!
---
I member.
---
Ahhh the memories.
---
nah
---
i just want TBC arena
---
fuck your dumb osrs shit lol
---
OK sweet, I've already put my first two talents in healing focus and am too poor to respec. Should I next put my talents in wand specialisation followed by shadow? Thanks for the advice
---
It's literally against the rules dude, just pm him.
---
Be a mage. Otherwise no solution.
---
Well, it depends if your definition of trolling includes "propaganda shill for the PRC".  The weaksauce claim of anti-Chinese hate if you are against Maoist butchers is a standard talking point with PRC shills.
---
i'm really not sure what you mean.  best aoe tanks?  like, they hold the most aggro for big aoe pulls? that's kind of a neat niche for a tank but doesn't change anything i said lol
---
Uh wat
---
THATS A 50 DKP MINUS
---
Man of my own heart.
---
Okay wtf that‚Äôs a weird comparison, it‚Äôs a video game dude calm down...
---

---
I am aware of how it used to be. It just really wasn't a big inconvenience for me. Whereas people have been bitching about this since launch.
---
That's simply not true, even the charts on wowhead were showing a lot of players nearing or hitting cap. If level 60 is going to take you that long, then you probably shouldn't be playing classic wow, Because this game is going to be an entirely new beast. 
---
They are actually going extremely slow compared to most games with content drops.
---
And I kinda prefer guilds being the main vehicle of grouping with general chat being the backup. I think of 75% of players agree with you we should go with that, though. I doubt LFG would win in a classic players vote, but if it does they should implement it.
---
So my guild and I achieved ony and full MC run in 2 hours and 30 minutes, is this considered fast pace or average?
---
I'm only asking because I was a little kid in vanilla and only made it to 47, never played private servers
---
TBH just give us the new AH from retail we all know the old AH is shit it was done in 2004 and modeled after Ebay which even they know is a horrible model today it only took like 2 years+ for us to know it was gold awful with the RS grandexchange.
---
The biggest benefit is its half the costs of an epic mount.
---
2h maces at least, and it depends on  faction. You can talk to any weapon master in a main city and they will tell you where to train what.
---
So the guy who bought a key on the AH can have all of the locked chests, but not a rogue who spent the time leveling up lock picking??
---
Look, if you're going to shill effectively for the PRC, you need to get your English up to at least Russian cyber-operative standards, or no one is going to be taken in by your feeble arguments.
---
Normal mounts take a bag slot.
---
I literally just put out an example comparison. The difference of 2 tiers is a chunk of armor, 3 main stat points, a loss of FR, a small gain in Mp5, and a larger gain in healing.
---
*Of course* it's better. However, it's not lvl 20 gear vs. lvl 60 gear better. The level of difference is perfectly fine because it took far more effort to achieve.
---
&gt;After 1 night of mc 1 or 2 rogues in the group will get their aged core.
---
I'm on raid 4 and have yet to see them. In fact, even inspecting the rogues I see in Ironforge using daggers, I don't see *any* aged core leather gloves, just nightslayer and devilsaur. In fact, in all my raids we've had 4 rogue items and about 30 caster pieces. Don't use your personal drops to say silly things like "yeah night 1 you'll have multiple rogues with it"
---
&gt;confused how I'm doing so much more damage than them.
---
They don't sound very good if they're truly confused about it.
---
Piss off ninja looter.
---
I mean, wow got plenty of players that never see the real world.
---
Even if he tries to write as someone not like that it is very clear he is one of those.
---
Priest tanks.
---
you can, but it's called a reserve price
---
Lf tank brd arena runs, hoj and chain reserved.
---
Good luck with that
---
Jokes on you I've never even heard of the game.
---
Always know its gonna be a good day when there is a fresh countdown in the podcast queue!
---
Are there likely to be server transfers again?
---
I am on skeram alliance side and the horde imbalance is giving me anxiety....
---
Lfg with teleport I'm against,  but lfg that they implemented in bc I'm all for.  It organizes people looking into a gui. Interaction is still required to form a party and get to the dungeon.
---
I recommend Druid if you don't want to be "just a tank". I play one with my GF so groups are quick since I'll tank them. Way less gear dependant than warriors and you have better utility if something doesn't go right (Innervate that healer who just went oom as the pull went sideways) and the ability to be healer as needed. Questing downtime is also 0. But warrior duo leveling is a lot nicer than solo if you plan to level one anyway.
---
That rule is so vague it can be used to silence any competitor at any time for anything. And the PRC government isn't "the public", it's a pack of butchers who deserve to be offended.
---
When my gnome warrior was 37, i had about 30-40g only. I halted training most abilities (Honestly, a lot of warrior skills arn't worth training past rank 1 while leveling).  I also sold a lot of herbs/greens/whatever.  I got my mount at like 42. Gold starts coming a lot faster as you level. So don't sweat it.
---
I went even further and changed my a/d turning keys into the strafe keys, that way I'm forced to use my mouse to turn. Surprisingly easy to get used to and helps a ton in pvp.
---
Honestly, the only way to treat these people is the same as crazy shouty hobos you see on the street - say nothing, move on.
---
I love it. My wife‚Äôs characters name is neckbeard on Fairbanks
---
I'll defend my right to solo level suboptimally without fear of ridicule any time. And anyone else's, especially in a post not related to it. Anyone who invalidates that experience in this context is being toxic and if they can dish it, they can take it.
---
Yes, but when this was asked about shit like skinning the beast, the consensus was the skinner gets to take it and it is not put up to a roll.  It's the same logic, the person wouldn't be getting it without the group.
---
Most likely it was people listing low for visibility with the intention to cancel if they didn't get buyouts.  I've noticed that whenever I use a super low starting price I almost immediately get a bid, there's likely people/bots who make their gold by bidding on everything with an extremely low starting price.
---
Does the ERP only go up to second base? That's wholesome.
---
Ouch, yeah I was skeptical when I was having it made because it was alittle pricey, but definitely am glad I did. Other thing I found that really is speeding it up is that you can stealth right as you finish looting the cage and it wont agro the mob if one summons. I already have an instant auto loot addon for pick pocketing, so it works out really well; hardly have to fight any crabs.
---
They wouldn't have to be single votes. Classic+ vs BC could be the main vote with accessory systems being voted on individually. Anything without that 75% super majority would be developers discretion.
---
I wish to respectfully inform you that you are in fact a dunderhead.
---
claw, bite and growl
---
That only works if your guild has people around your level to do the content with or if people are even on and not just goofing around. Casual guild problems I guess, but they are friendly.
---
So I, being what I thought was an adult in the military at the time, had bought the game before it came out back in 2004 and read the manual from front to back 3 times. My ship was deployed during the first month or so of WoW releasing so I never had to experience the server issues that many felt. When I first started playing I wanted to be honorable Night Elf Druid. Got him all the way to level 12, faught long and hard and finished my bear shiftshaping quest and then shortly after discovered a 2hander green sword.
---
I was estatic to put it on, only to hear the, "I can't use that yet. I can't use that item" I must have tried to equip it every which way possible. I started typing in /1 and some random person told me I had to run all the way to SW and talk to the King of SW. He told me how to do the Wetlands death march. I did it. He told me how to get to SW from IF on the tram. I did it. Then when he told me where to go I went to the "King Area" and he LoL'd at me and told me I was an idiot and that druids couldn't use 2handed swords. I nerd raged and quit for several months.
---
if you want to be a team player,  tell your group you have keys and that they can /roll to see who gets it,   if you wanna be "that guy", say nothing,  after the run is over, wait for others to leave the instance/group and just got back to the chest and get it then.
---
This site is super fun. You can monitor best gear while leveling too
---
That's not what they said when interviewed. What's your source?
---
The rogue one is actually cool though
---
K bye
---
In classic, Blizz employees where illiterate. #nochanges
---
Cry me a river.
---
And the only reason the chest is open is because of him training his blacksmithing.
---
RIP, Don was late to name reservations. But nice!
---
I would recommend just getting the mats for now. You‚Äôll have to run strat live anyways for the In Dreams quest line, and the pattern seems to have a fairly high drop rate. If you haven‚Äôt seen it drop by the time you‚Äôre 60 then go ahead and buy it. Truefaith is BiS until 8/8 t2 or AQ40 robes, but it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs mandatory to have to heal 5 mans.
---
You can literally do all the things you're talking about as holy. That's what people are saying.
---
Rogue lockpicking is a bit different than a smithing skeleton key.
---
While it‚Äôs essentially a profession for the rogue, and requires effort to level, it takes nothing to unlock a chest once that rogue has the skill.
---
A blacksmith has to make skeletons keys, which can be expensive. The highest key costs 1 arcanite bars for 2 keys. If they‚Äôve spent the gold to make that key, the chest should be theirs since odds are they‚Äôve lost profits on the chest. Now, if people pitch in and cover the cost of the key so everyone gets an even roll (which almost no groups will do btw), then that‚Äôs different.
---
But alts are a thing, it's trivial to just overbid everything if you need to.
---
Try Inflight. Mine didn't come with times preloaded, but it records your flight times and gives you a timer on ones you have done already.
---
Don't forget to start In Dreams quest chain. Starts off in EPL killing a ton of plaugehounds, bats, and worms.
---
Not as bad as everyone makes out, you‚Äôre definitely slower than Shadow but will never have any downtime unlike Shadow.
---
Rotation will be PWS&gt;Holy Fire&gt;SWP&gt;Wand. Then at about half health you‚Äôll do another Holy Fire and PWS and wand until they‚Äôre dead.
---
Things are lasting probably 20-25 seconds, but you‚Äôll have full mana after Spirit Tap where Shadow gets things down closer to half that time but will have to drink every now and then.
---
I think a slow burn towards WoTLK with individual changes being voted on by the community is a happy medium between everyone's wants for classic.
---
At least this shill's English skills are competent.
---
&gt; /console rawMouseEnable 1
---
Is this permanent or do I have to enable it at login every time?
---
No; hellfire damage is irresistable by the caster.  It can be mitigated with a voidwalker sacrifice though.
---
Sorry, the fade out was supposed to show that was it for part 2, lesson learned :)
---
When you get to late endgame, is DW fury tank like the ultimate build? Could you offer a brief description? I'm coming up on 60 as a first time Wow player.
---
phase 2 is going to make the game unplayable for the alliance on 9/10 servers. We will be camping ALL flightpaths 50+. you are going to land and get a facefull of dots and be dead. Phase 3 will come soon
---
No, I want to give them equivalent gear as Naxxramas (or worse, but itemized for DPS warriors). A tier set, for instance, if not multiple tier sets.
---
Details shows your pet's damage as your own. It's displayed as "Attack (Cat)" in your sources of damage.
---
Obviously change "Cat" for whatever your pet's name is.
---
People are leaving because there's literally nothing to do when youre full raid pre-bis, and tons and tons of people are right now. Lots of them just log in weekly for the raids, because theres literally nothing to do.
---
The priest/paladin abilities worked against forsaken because they were full on undead.  They were immune to fear and couldn't drown.  The forsaken category was added because making them full undead was a bit much.
---
I drink on average 4-5 times per dungeon, most of those being from rebuffing or when we pull adds.
---
I do however notice a heck of a lot of ‚Äúhealers‚Äù not even specced healing (druids, shamans and hell, even priests) and those specs will usually result in drinking after every pull.
---
That and gear. Way too many priests running heavy stam/int or trying to stack Spellpower at lv20-40 and again will OOM almost every pull. 
---
And finally, way too many healers are unaware of how spirit regen works.
---
Priests - 13 + (spr/4) mp2
---
Druid/shaman/pally - 15 + (spr/5) mp2
---
Spirit regen activates after 5 seconds of no spell casting (even in combat) and will tick mp2.
---
mp5 gear also ticks mp2 (10mp5 is actually 4mp2)
---
Ypu also regen mana during spell cast bar, but will stop the moment the spell actually casts:
---
IE - I wait for my mp2 tick, start casting Heal (3.0s cast time) I will regen one more tick with 1s left on heal cast time (so for example with 400spr I‚Äôd regen 113 mp2, and by waiting for a tick before cast, I regen 226 mana instead of 113)
---
How do you use steam link to play on your phone?
---
There's a line to be drawn somewhere, for sure; people just disagree on exactly where is all. Your opinion is as good as anyone else's, but also not any better.

LuL, I personally love Warlocks. Plan to have a 29 twink for BG's

No one is invalidating your fuckin experience dude, it's just a hilarious screenshot that confirms a lot of stereotypes. Relax man and learn to take a joke. And this is what they are: jokes. No one is trying to hurt your fee-fees
---
Permanent. Per computer I think
---
You roll. This would never, ever, ever fly for a rogue to do.
---
I fixed mine by turning off the minimum and maximum fps settings. I'll have to try the above command tho. Turning off min max fps stuff stopped the random mouse acceleration bursts, but the mouse movement still feels a bit off at times.
---
Assuming he wins on his selfbids at 50 copper, 2000 postings would sell for a total of 10g ... 5% of that being 50s. So whoever this is would end up paying 50s to manipulate the market to potentially turn ~20g into 40-60g. Makes sense, but its still a dick move and annoyingly tedious. It also isn't repeatable, as he would have to wait however long it takes for the market to reset to normal values to try it again.
---
I prefer auctionator on retail.
---
However, I haven't seen an official version of Auctionator for Classic, so I am stuck with Auctioneer.
---
What add-on u using
---
Mara question. Does everyone need the staff or can one person in the group bring all the rest with them?

Girlfriend and I already cancelled!

---
Baron: Dead at 24/61s
---
Shazzrah: Pet not used.
---
Majordomo: 15/80, despite pet receiving one Heal.
---
Rag: 29/120.
---
Garr: You're not there.
---
On top of this, your guild drops bosses at high speed, *inflating the uptime of your pet relative to a beginner like OP struggling with longer fight times*. E.g. Your pet now lasts 15/120 sec in Majordomo vs 15/80.
---
**So which of these two statements is now truer:**
---
A) Uptime is about 50% at best in raids, 20% for a lot of bosses. Unless the heals are geared and competingg for meters, your pet is going to hit the floor pretty often.
---
or
---
B) Nah, it's close to 100%, bosses, other than rag and ony, don't have time to kill your pet.
---
Why can't I need roll on bop weapons? They vendor for a lot!  I need money!  The guy can always run the dungeon again and get the item.  It won't be the only time he is able to get it

&gt;you sound sad, and as edgy as the guy from OPs picture

oof someone who resorts to saying 'u mad???' in &lt;current year&gt; and then calls people 'inbred' lol. But yeah, feel sorry for how I handle disagreements.
---
Opera had this for several years and works with most of media content not just YT
---
What exactly are we fighting? What did I miss?
---
What the hell does that have to do with the topic at hand?
---
The comment I was replying to said it would be cool to see the world as the developers intended it. I was pointing out those people are gone.
---
&gt; I mean it can‚Äôt be that hard to follow the same formula.
---
And yet here we have retail
---
show us the screenshots of you deleting all your gear and gold, i dont care if you un-sub today and re-sub in a couple days/weeks
---
It is, its maybe something you'd care about in a bg. Mostly its a non-issue though
---
Translation:  I'm a karma whore!
---
10/10 post. Most people fail to see this.
---
Just one person needs it. The person with the staff should wait until the entire party has gone through prior to entering.
---
People struggle to keep 20man raid teams let alone 40 in classic. Being a raid leader in classic sounds awful.
---
dwarves in warhammer are much cooler, would love to see some warhammer mmo remake (not that age of reckoning) based on classic progress and difficulty
---
Did you get your tantrum out and now you sweepy? Nap time!
---
No and no. Watch the dev update bud.
---
same, kept thinking they were restarting servers and tried back every half hour or so to check and finally realized it was in a different tab
---
Only one person in the group needs the scepter of celebras to open the portal for everyone.
---
&gt;But we get flying! :P Which nobody asked for xD
---
The overwhelming majority of people asked and we're excited for flying mounts.
---
If you get to 60 quickly, sure. But as raids begin to cement and the pool of 60s broaden you may find yourself without a space in most raids because Spriest is very undersireable right now.
---
Nice gatekeeping. 10/10
---
What level can you enter UBRS/LBRS? I hear that most groups only take 60s but not sure.. also I have fiery wep enchant for my main sword (Thrash Blade) should I change it to something else when I eventually raid and to what? Also do poisons work in MC?
---
Spent far too much time 3t barb fishing.
---
Desgosting.
---
Agreed. I got really god at fury warrior PvP because respecs were expensive.
---
There has to be a cost to grabbing a maxed out, zero utility or flexibility spec, and sacrificing pve or pvp effectiveness is it.
---
As long as they don't do the cheesy ass Indiana Jones ripoff.  It really killed the immersiveness of the game's lore and just made it some lame tribute.
---
If you want to go get for pvp that's cool, just recognize that you're making a sacrifice in terms of PvE usefulness for PvP. It's the same as a rogue who wants to raid as sub.
---
Yet here u are clicking and typing
---
it depends on your AH on your server. Recipe: Transmute Water to Air and Recipe: Transmute Undeath to Water are generally solid. Neither are rep related. The 1st is the scholo key quest chain until you can see the undead there, and the other is a random world drop.
---
ehh, horde and undead in particular have enough racial advantages in PvP, I don't think it'd have been overkill.
---
And why initially inner fire also gave an ap bonus.
---
Classic would run on a potato tbh so I don‚Äôt know how amazing that is but yes it‚Äôs true!
---
Your spells shouldn't be getting knocked back anyway against most mobs. 
---
Even as fire you have the talent for 70% chance not to be knocked back and  you have impact too. 
---
But Fireball/Pryroblast &gt; 2nd Fireball while 1st is in the air &gt; Frost nova &gt; Strafe &gt; Fireball = dead enemy. 
---
As frost (especially shatter) it's even easier. 
---
Arcane tree is almost 100% a support tree for Fire or Frost in vanilla. It can change a bit during burning crusade or woltk (can't remember). 
---
IF  you can afford the gold, respec in to a frost shatter build and see how easy it is.
---
Seems like you're an engineer. For pvp what do you lvl first? Gnomish or goblin?
---
Canada üá®üá¶
---
Classic is the most casual version of wow? Yeah ok boss
---
Between me and Secondbase- it goes however far he consents to. Gotta keep it respectful, homie.
---
It's fairly common to have a main raid team and a secondary raid team. The secondary team is basically working on their own progression and usually lags behind the main team, but has the benefit of help from guildies.
---
Ima about to have never leveled my lockpicking but an endless supply of blacksmith keys
---
I'm not an expert on that so you might need someone else to chime in..... but I'm assuming it's just typical fury DPS while sitting in defensive stance  since Bloodthirst doesn't require zerk stance, and the spec probably uses Defiance as well. With warriors scaling crazy strong with top end gear, the DPS alone with a high threat modifier should make it easy to hold aggro. The obvious problem being a significant drop in melee mitigation, hence the need for crazy good gear.
---
No, pvp was broken. It was horribly dumbed down. Rank 1 achievable with few buttons-only retri paladin.
---
As a Shaman a lot of this is sadly wrong. DPS Warriors are some of the best in the game to start.
---
 Remindme! 3hours
---
Not to mention actual corpse runs
---
You had to run back to loot your corpse... and you were naked and not in ghost form... and there was no spirit ressing
---
Made it so easy to corpse camp in PVP (though no exp loss from PvP) And even worse if you died in a tough spot in PVE you may die a couple more times trying to /corpse to drag it to a safe area to loot.  I do think most severs you had to be within 8 levels to PVP someone though 
---
Also.. depending on the PVP server, if you killed someone you could loot their corpse and take any money they had on their person.  Made it very important to ensure you put your platinum in the bank before venturing out.
---
EQ was hardcore
---
By Reddit logic, he‚Äôs not even allowed to roll in that situation.

---
The difference is generally slight, and is more favorable the less you have (in that example the break even is at 18% crit I think, anything less than that 1% crit is more than 1% dps increase). 
---
It's different on spell builds though, because that bonus is 150% not 200%
---
I dont know phys classes that well, is 18% crit achievable with current gear and talents?
---
Also do you know why in that formula, 0.25 for crit chance is listed twice?  I don't understand why it's in the first parenthesis block.
---
not all of us can clear all content in two weeks lol.

---
I‚Äôm sure there are more than a few entertaining/drama filled stories about this drop ruining guilds and friendships, both in game and real life.
---
TBC delayed? Sounds good to me, that's when I really started hating WoW. I'm here for the vanilla experience, not the expansion experience.
---
Yes, I do want them to slow down the release of each phase. I do want these things to take time. I want the casuals to have a chance to not only raid, but have the time to get gear from the place. I don't want to see new raid content come out when only a handful of people have snagged their full MC raid sets. I'm unsure how I feel about DM, but overall I don't think it's super necessary at this stage for more content to be released, and if it's a sign of their content release plan being quicker than anticipated, I think it's a bad move.
---
FOR KHAZZZZ MODANNNNNN!
---
Do you atleast raid  always with the same people? If yes then you WILL get loot soon.
---
First off, no, most Warlocks or Pallys do not in fact buy regular epic mounts when they can get one from their class with not only cooler flavor, but significantly cheaper too. Obviously, if they are made of gold, they might end up doing both. I have never known a single lock or pally who said they'd rather skip their signature mounts, so not sure where you got that from.
---
Your opinion on whether or not you feel they are entitled to their class mounts is completely irrelevant. Don't be jealous. it's part of their class. Deal with it. Would you want to strip other classes of some of their most powerful spells too just because others don't get it?
---
Second, DM-X was in the original vanilla game. I do not recall people complaining about it back then. So not sure why people are complaining about it now. People get nice gear. Nice class mounts. Better ways of making money. How is this a bad thing exactly? Seriously, I'm confused.
---
Note: The only case where DM-X drops are better than MC is when comparable items don't actually drop in MC. DM-X is still mostly blues, just like all the other level 60 five-man dungeons.
---
For yourself, what exact timeline would you have preferred for the release of DM-X? I mean, you know it would have been released no matter what, so what ... another month? Two months? How many level 60 subs who don't have the time for 40 man raids would you like to have quit the game before it's okay to add more content?
---
Reddit.
---
Sometimes ... eventually, the top guilds start selling raid spots to nubs who want gear they couldn'  otherwise get access to.
---
you could just save the post and come back to it later, just sayin
---
Clearing all content in two weeks means 12 hour days every single day.
---
Does detect stealth work on stealthed units? I was trying to find the Panthers in STV and they wouldn't show up anywhere on the map until I was on top of them and spotted them normally.
---
Heh yea, it happens. (Plus you were sick!)
---
P.s. re "seasonal servers" you should talk to j Todd Coleman about crowfall's approach to that problem
---
Msg the priest before going in.
---
"Pre bubble me.. I am going in"
---
 Remindme! 2hours
---
Probably has to pay some silver to everyone in the group, open the chest but only they can roll, and pass on loot for remainder of the dungeon. #fixed
---
...geometrically?
---
I've heard this "priests had tank traits in early design" but i've never seen the source for that. I'm 100% not calling you out I just really want to read about this! Can you tell me where you read this?
---
yeah its fucked atm. Sounds like a damn harp too, and not a flute
---
You can still get your epic kodo. Just cuz you got a horse doesnt mean you cant get your kodo.
---
INSANELY low drop rate.  This is the kind of drop that ruins guilds.  The kind of drop that people ninja loot and name change and server move over.
---
&gt;However, looking down on others for not boycotting is very hypocritical for people picking and choosing what human rights issues they want to stick up for.
---
Where?  I don't think anyone was even suggesting looking down on other for not boycotting.  You just made up something to be irrationally angry about.
---
Aren't kicks on a global cooldown? I know rogue's are, I assume warrior's pummel and shield bash are as well.
---
If I'm right, it's not possible because swapping weapons at all will trigger a global cooldown. You're best off just utilizing the standard weapon swap macro and then hitting the button for shield bash, whatever that may be.
---
Also, you're aware pummel and shield bash will trigger the cooldown for one another, right? You can't have both.
---
Improved ranks remove more armour.  I think it‚Äôs something like removing 1 point of armour = 0.58 points of threat.   So more armour removed at a higher rank is a direct threat increase.   And less armour = more damage, so you get a small, indirect threat increase that way.
---
I think demo roar is a fixed threat value, regardless of rank.
---
Btw, it‚Äôs better not to use thunderclap unless something is hitting like a truck.  It costs a lot of rage for a mediocre amount of threat.  Think of it as a damage reduction rebuff, not a threat generator.   For good threat you want to be spamming sunder armour (upgraded).
---
So many people tell me druid is better at tanking then healing tho. If someone wants to tank or dps is druid so bad? Or are they just not good at healing until raids?
---
And evenly distribute any profits from the vendor trash he acquired up to that point.
---
Catering to casuals is why BFA is the way it is right now.
---
As a rogue I will open them myself. If it has anything I don't need I offer it to the group or offer a roll.
---
If someone else can open it also we will roll for the chest but I don't usually group with other rogues because rogues are greedy assholes myself included.
---
If your a blacksmith and the only one that can open it then why wouldn't you save your keys for when you win the roll? (If you could open without me and you won the roll id still pick it for you).
---
Mine, but if I get anything people actually need I trade ofc
---
Good man.  I can't tell you how many healers get mad at us for hellfire
---
"It damages you"
---
"Yeah, we know.  This is our aoe. Bubble and heals plz"

*nods in satisfaction
---
I'll PM you!
---
Yes, prove me wrong. Literally infinite amount of time to clear content, take your time and progress with opportunities and people eligible to carry you through old content for catchup. You literally can't do any of that in other versions of WoW. You have all day, and all the opportunities to do things in Classic. Don't get me wrong, I love classic, but jesus christ the community is so stupid. Just because things take time doesn't mean it doesn't cater to casuals. Because it does.
---
Because in osrs the content is voted for by the members (subscribers) who have a total level of over 400.
---
You could use that same system to only allow players of a certain threshold. OP says 60. To only be able to vote, thus being people with significant time investment to guide the content thats released.
---
I mean... how is it not? You don't need to farm dailies, there is minimum rep required for anything, all the content is old and all the strats perfected, all the information is out there, guides for everything, and the average player has already done all the quests and leveled a toon before on this content. Sure, you can argue it's not like retail and you don't get good gear just handed to you, but, it's not like logging into the game to do MC for 2-3hrs a week and waiting for your drops eventually is hard or anti-casual.
---
Glad to be of assistance!
---
Beginning with Wrath Blizzard always had two difficulties as a minimum. First being 25 and 10 man raids with the latter being the easier versions, then hard modes with ulduar and heroic as an actual difficulty with ToC onwards (tier 9). By the time of ToC and ICC WoW essentially had four difficulties: 10 man, 10 man heroic, 25 man and 25 man heroic and each dropped different gear levels with some gear being excluded from 10 mans.
---
With Cata they decided to make 10 and 25 man "equal" both in terms of difficulty as well as gear. Iirc there were only a very low amount of bosses where that was actually true. So, the hardest difficulty was still 25 man heroic but with basically no rewards, since they were the same 10 man heroic had. Tier 11 notorious because Blizzard just couldn't properly tune 10 man.
---
The results of this were hit or miss parts of raids and sometimes no consistency in terms of difficulty or even encounter design, since raids had to be tuned for two difficulties which were supposed to be equally difficult despite requiring different numbers of players at the same time. 
---
Then came WoD. They changed it so there were four difficulties: LFR, normal, heroic and mythic. LFR being queueable and during WoD until HFC literally the intended tourist mode (it dropped nothing of worth). Normal and Heroic were now flexible, allowing for 10 up to 30 people and everyone could go or come as they wanted. Mythic was now a set size - 20 man.  This finally allowed for raids on the highest difficulty to be fully designed for that difficulty without accommodating for a separate group size, something which hadn't been the case since TBC. Add to that the modern game and boss mechanics and you have the potential for some amazing encounters. I'm gonna list some examples of some fun and creative bosses in my opinion:
---
[Tectus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPeWlVDy4OQ). Each time you "kill" him he splits. By the end of the fight you have eight small copies of him and every single copy repeats his mechanics. You can see that the arena is full of spikes with almost no room at the end.
---
[Brackenspore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSB2VFJ9l50). Opinions may be torn on this one, but I loved the idea of having to fight against the surroundings while also getting free bloodlusts (the blue mushrooms). The use of the extra action button in order to use the flamethrowers was a really nice idea, especially if you knew how to properly use them.
---
[Hans and Franz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz8HxzsCDpE). Just an amazing idea for an arena and use of the surroundings despite it ending up being quite annoying at times. The dance just becomes so crazy towards the end.
---
[Operator Thogar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z9s-Y81OS8). TRAINS. Of course you can just boggle it down to "kill adds and dodge shit" but it's the way the arena is designed what makes the fight special in my opinion. Your awareness in terms of which gates are open was really tested and plenty of people even died on normal and heroic difficulties when they didn't pay enough attention.
---
[Blast Furnace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgaJdRVPK3s). The control fight. Some hate this boss, some love it. I am torn. The first phase consists of having to kill adds and destroy parts of the furnace itself with bombs dropped from the engineer adds. The second phase is pure add management and control while the last phase is a burn phase. It's just so well rounded.
---
[Blackhand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHJ_hqJewM0). Still tied for me as one of the most amazing kill videos besides Paragon's Ragnaros heroic and Lich King 25 heroic kill videos. The fight is a 10 minute "sprint" where every phase just felt tight as if you were rushing against the clock. There were no real stops or lulls. The voice acting for the character was phenomenal and the phase transitions some of the the best I've ever seen in an MMORPG.
---
I could go on with HFC as well, mainly the latter bosses of Xhul'horac, Mannoroth, Archimonde (yes, he came back) but I recommend just watching those kill videos from method, paragon etc. WoD was also the last expansion before Watcher (Ion Hazzokostas) took over as game director, since until that point he had been Lead Encounter designer for quite some time, something which I think he should have stayed at. Overall, WoD naturally had some weaker bosses but it had so many highs with its encounters that people just gloss over the weaker ones.
---
&gt;were in the pre-patch
---
Fake news.
---
I would not want to play a Classic+ monstrosity that has progressed into TBC, combining elements from both.
---
A lot of people just want to play the game that they love, not a vote based Frankenstein that has random elements from all games, and random elements from the mind of little Timmy that somehow got 75% votes.
---
If everyone on horde side speaks Orcish, why don't phrases like "Dabu" or "Zug zug" get translated to something everyone can understand?
---
I‚Äôve seen him around. Never got a close enough look to make out the names though.
---
Are the weapons accurate?
---
Good lord lemme settle it, you can raid as anything dammit! As long as no one royally screws up and the boss goes down it's a win. If you want to down it faster, more efficiently, follow the meta, but you don't need to in the slightest. 
---
Find a guild to take you for the role you want to play as, learn the ins and outs of your class, and have fun. It's a game for Light's sake, can we just let people have fun without crapping all over each other?
---
You can raid ret, you can raid prot, you can raid holy. You're a paladin so you have a lot of versatility, at times you will be expected to support over damage, mages do the same on heavy decurse fights. At times you will be expected to heal, it's part of your toolkit, it should be used (yeah screw those uber ret pally I-don't-heal types too). Downing a raid boss is a team effort if everyone works together and together contributes enough, you win as a team.
---
Best of luck out there and remember to play what YOU want to play. It's a friggin game, have fun with it.
---
I guess I do live in the future. My bad I'm subscribed to so many wow threads I didn't even look to see if it was classic.  Just figured it was another person complaining about Rogues DPS in mythics. You're right!
---
You missed the end game in this analysis where Warriors are the best class in the game
---
Dont forget having a lv 35 HoA on retail.
---
I legit logged on every hour throughout the day before realizing that no, bleeding hollow isn‚Äôt online, it‚Äôs just in a different tab. I‚Äôm a dumbass lol
---
Basically every MC boss fight is: Tank and spank.
---
Lucifron is tank and spank with 2 adds.  Kill adds and decurse.
---
Magmadar is tank and spank.  Hope you don't get feared into fire.  Hunter tranq.
---
Gehennes - Tank nd spank, kill adds and decurse.
---
Garr - Banish adds you can, kill the others. Kill boss.
---
Shazzrah, Decurse and kill shazz
---
Geddon - Kill Boss, don't stand in hellfire don't blow up raid with bomb.
---
Sulfuron - Tank adds and kick heals.  Dispel and burn one at a time.  Kill boss.
---
Golemagg - Tank dogs - Kill boss.  Stand in hole for extra DPS.
---
Executus - Tank boss, CC adds and burn each add.  CC breaks at four dead and finish burning them one by one.
---
Ragnaros - Burn boss, when he goes down CC and kill sons, burn boss again.
---
When dual wielding you have a higher chance to miss when attacking.
---
Missing is obviously bad.
---
If you're going to go with dual wielding, fight enemies a few levels lower than you. This will decrease your miss chance. This may mean grinding a lot to stay ahead of the normal questing curve. 
---
It will take you longer to level either way, but play what's fun and most importantly, at your own pace.
---
I'd also recommend one point in to piercing howl, it's really good for chasing down or running away from things and, unlike hamstring, has some range on it.
---
You should cancel your subscription and support HK.
---
Can‚Äôt remember what my alli server name is but im playing horde om Judgement so let me know if ya wanna hang
---
proper killer gnome right there
---
UBRS should be all 60s. LBRS can be done a few levels prior.
---
You can get in at 56 (maybe lower but I did lbrs at 56 and it's the same entrance) but that's far too low for ubrs. I would recommend 58 at least.

Oh I just saw you meant the mage class off hand. I'm gonna try get that today.
---
Is this a photoshop? Your vanish shows you have Flash Powder in bags, as does the Instant Poison on your bars (21) which means you have at least 2 slots of poisons in your bags
---
They are talking strictly materials cost.
---
Nothing wrong with being evolutionarily "unsuccessful."

I'm retiring when I hit 50, no way in hell I'd be able to pull that off if I fucked up and made some kids. Life is about what you want to get out of it.

So, last night, while I was fishing, i created a free account, and played a bit of WoW retail.  I haven't ever really played WoW retail, except for like a few months 10 years or so ago, I played with a GF who happened to play. Anyhow, its interesting to see how different it is than Classic (prefer classic), but I kind of want to play it a bit, and see how it goes.  Now the question is, do I buy the expansion for the free level boost, to get gold, to buy bags, etc, to make leveling easier, or do I just go keep at it for free?  Hate having small bags :( drives me crazy.
---
Sure you can. Even on sites like Ebay you can create a built-in minimum bid that cancels your auction automatically if not met. That way bids for items worth thousands can still begin at $1 without worrying about having to sell for just $1, and the people bidding don't know what that minimum bid is. The only way what you're saying would make sense is if blizz also adds a hidden minimum bid setting. This is how auctions work.

A  class with only battleres

So the most efficient way to level is arms with a very slow 2h weapon. The problem with dual wielding is that you will often miss your attacks with your off hand severely slowing down your time to kill. That being said you can do whatever you want. This game is not about being as efficient as possible it is about having fun. But don't kid yourself - this will make leveling your warrior (the slowest class to level) even slower.
---
Is multiboxing allowed?
---
Back in Wrath I flew laps around the edges of Wintergrasp getting Saronite and Titanium from about 5pm until around 10am the following day. IIRC you would get dismounted from your flying mount after 10 seconds of flying within the zone so I had to stay on the outskirts. Had a really good route going with a couple Titanium veins per lap. 
---
I only stopped to join Wintergrasp to help make sure it finished as quickly as possible. I filled my bags multiple times and made a ton of gold which lasted me a long time. Totally worth it.
---
Enough is enough. This has stopped being even mildly entertaining three days ago.
---
And they get all their mana back when they crit! Then they also have a 2m cooldown talent to auto crit on their next heal. It makes for extremely good mana efficiency when you use that on max rank holy light.
---
Yes, I'm playing shadow now. Healing is still great in shadow, but besides the point. Spriests should put 5 talent points in Shadow Weaving. Its a debuff that allows 3% more shadow damage and stacks 5 times, so 15% shadow damage increase. This is particularly useful to locks, which is why you'll see many people say "raids bring 1 shadow priest". In a raid/dungeon group, the shadow priest will typically do lower damage then your pure dps specs, but it's all situational. What spriests lack in damage they make up for in utility.
---
As long as you don't have talents (such as deep wounds for warriors or flurry for shaman) that benefit from crit, yes.
---
who went with you to take the pic? would love to hear the story
---
The only reason there are FPs everywhere is because the Flight Masters had to try and meet the demand of the explosive adventurer growth. However they overdid it and are forced to charge a pittance in the current economy. Just another tale of mishandling supply and demand...
---
Can you get summoned by a warlock, then hearth, and still accept the summon?
---
I am not a casual and I would have no problem playing vanilla for 3 years. There's no reason to rush to tbc. Relax and enjoy the game.
---
Great catch. This is fake lol
---
Fun fact:

---
The aspect ratio of the black box is 16 to 3.5   
---
So this is wider than two 16:9 displays next to each other.   
---
I don't know how relevant that is, though
---
Hey my girlfriend made it to 41 so far on her tiny MacBook!
---
&gt; ruining our chances of getting xpacs like TBC and Wrath delayed 
---
Good.  We don't want TBC or Wrath.  You are in the minority here and bitching that people want time to enjoy classic is the problem.
---
As a priest, I love coming across hostile mages
---
Ya. I farmed near a horde Hunter (as alliance) for awhile. We were mostly friendly and stuck to our sides. After a few minutes he ran over and started tagging mobs I was going for, got 3 in total. So I murdered him. Don't fuck up a good thing my dude.
---
Personally, I think reservations are stupid. If you're after specific loot then tell the group you're going to roll on it before you start. Reservations are for guild/friend groups only, in my opinion.
---
This is a fairly recent addition to Chrome if that makes you feel any better.
---
Yes. But at the same time my HP Omen laptop feels and sounds the same way.
---
Probably why he is using linen cloth, as it has one of the highest turnover rates of any item. I'm guessing he also has determined that the vast majority of players have progressed beyond linen cloth, so he wont have to face as much competition as he would have 2+ weeks ago .... at the same time linen cloth is still used a lot for leveling professions by high level players.
---
The more I think about it the more genius it is. Evil genius but genius all the same.
---
not many people bring level 28 tailors for ZF farming runs on my server
---
Cool, but it doesn't include talents, and I think the visuals could be improved to show a lot more info about healing. Check out Ozgar's calculator, it's got all spells broken down by rank with comparative charts as well and everything.
---

---
Yeah I agree with that, I think anyone suggesting gear stronger than Naxx gear is out of their mind.   I think it would make a lot more sense to fill the giant gap between BWL and AQ40 gear power
---
Alright but you said they are bad for general PVE. They are quite simply top tier for tanking AND dps. And they can do both at the same time.
---
Warriors need a team for PVP I'll give you that but they are the best PVE class in the game for anything other than healing.
---
Please id also like to know.

Over 4 MC raids we've got 6 aged core, which is notably above average but i'd put average at around 1 per raid. If you've seen 0 in 4 raids that's quite unlucky but they are statistically less rare than a lot of other MC loot. Also Mugger's Belt is out in a week which is the perfect bridge item before u get aged core.
---
Also if you are too afraid of looking nooby to admit when you are confused that doesn't make you good. 
---
The entirety of classic so far the reigning law has been "sword &gt; dagger rogue". Most 'good' players, like yourself I imagine, follow this and perform well. When you get to end game raiding and you see someone not following this law, and doing grossly better in numbers than you, it can be initially confusing. Those confused people were good enough to realize the data in front of their eyes might be more realistic than what's on the internet, and most switched to daggers for now. (and do more dps)
---
Sometimes people are just in denial tho :), heres a few more reasons daggers are good:
---
1. Auto Attack damage on swords is better, but auto attack uptime in raiding isnt 100% - If you only get to stay in melee for 4 seconds, 2 backstabs is gonna beat out 3 sinister strikes. This is the largest reason why dagger outperforms imo.
---
2. Loot Sharing - If you are in a guild group with 7+ warriors, especially if you are alliance, every warrior is going for every single sword drop. so we have Gutgore Ripper, CHT, and Pblade almost exclusively for us to roll for, barring dagger fury but haven't seen that yet. 
---
3. Being able to pvp decently is a lot easier with PvE dagger spec than it is with PvE sword spec.
---
4. Bonus THEORY. Incorrect theorycrafting on backstab crit chance - There's a 15+ year argument on how backstab gets extra crit chance from talents, I can't say anything with certainty here but it FEELS like it crits more on live with 25% crit chance than it ever did on private servers. This may be a factor in why swords were always lauded as the go-to.
---
Oh shit that just worked with Twitch too. Nice.
---
Yeah hopefully. Something is still off for sure.
---
So sitting and kiting does work. But WAAAY differently compared to pservers or what people thought. 
---
You can sit but you have to time standing up with the mobs hit so it delays the batch. Idk how to describe it. Kiting is weird. You can do it. But ur autos will hit further than ur abilities due to leeway. Meaning if I want to use an ability I‚Äôll get hit twice anyways. Kiting is used when ur about to die to a mob and want to equalize the dammage and gain rage for execute without taking excess dammage.
---
Blame the addon not the game lol.
---
Seemed just like a bragging post but I stopped reading after he referred to Hunters as "Huntards".
---
I'd absolutely, 100%, love this
---
My guess is he accidentally facerolled onto the RP-walk hotkey and hasn't figured out how to undo it yet.
---
raiding as dps war at about 31-34% crit depending on buffs with pre-bis
---
Like I said before, you can claim the content is easy, people will wipe in MC and Only daily. That's a documented fact, go watch any stream.
---
Yeah, that passive is clutch. So, from my understanding -  don‚Äôt lose 7 spirit for the dagger to gain +24 healing, and instead stick with the staff?
---
Or should I be using that set-up to heal, and switch to staff for lvling kinda thing?
---
Who is we?
---
It does and doesnt, usually they don't care anyway and do what they want. 
---
Hell, they changed Draynor for a littlebit adding a dock to zeah "because no one wants to run another 40 steps to the original boat" until the backlash caused them to revert, didnt bother polling that. But holy, you got a green pixel in one of the skills that stood out and they better ask the community if they should fix it. Like lol, just fix it and if you are going to change an iconic area poll that..
---
Who is "we", absolutely everybody wants TBC and Wrath. Not a single damn person in my years of playing since 2006 has said Vanilla was their favorite version of the game until Nostalrius was shut down. And fun fact, vanilla private servers had the least amount of players than any other xpac. Keep hopping on the bandwagon. Every streamer other than the morons like Esfand would leave vanilla in a second if they have the opportunity to play TBC. Everyone would quit vanilla for TBC. I am not in the minority. Vanilla is a minority in itself, get off your high horse.
---
No one calls the epic class mounts free ya jabroni that's the level 40 one
---
You telling me to recognize something that's not there I get invited to dungeons because I'm good at my class I get invited to raid a because I bring something to it.
---
Mankrik represent
---
Yup quick and easy explanations, it takes one kill to fully understand.  If it takes more just watch a video...  mc is cake and if your raid is geared enough you burn the bosses before the later mechanics
---
When I was trying it I got to the point of seriously considering buying a +spell hit set. That's when I knew I had spent too much time in BRD and I was slowly going crazy.
---
Hmm thats a lot of gold oO, gratz for the exalted hope you are an enchanter for the agi enchant when the P2 will roll out!
---
Sorry, I want to know as well and I‚Äôm just saving the post for later.
---
Blizzard intentionally makes all their rules vague so they can do whatever they want.
---
I think so? hit the shop icon on the main menu and you should see server transfer there. I believe they just recently capped transfers to heartseeker or are about to though? see my comment below for my guild if you wanna transfer or reroll.
---
Edit: just reread your comment and saw you're alliance. servers definitely closed. nope don't transfer. ;)
---
A Couple of Towers!
---
Hey man, thanks for link. It does include talent bonuses
---
I‚Äôm fury tanking because my guild already out geared mc content. Mc was easy when we did it with a raid of lv 55-59s and with a full group of geared and consumed players I swapped to fury prot when normally I‚Äôd wait till Aq
---
Crap that was a mistype. Very last word should have been greed.
---
He lost me even sooner at rouges.
---
Played until like 35 and finally added questie. I don't think that the quests are *that* vague, but I don't think I could go back to not having it.
---
Or maybe you could show me a log where a pet doesn't have 100% uptime and it's not because of human error.
---
When you make assertions about what happens and what doesn't, it doesn't make sense to make them about a random case where people are being retarded.
---
Hmmm ... blacksmith keys. That's touchy because you're expending items for it, are you not? I would not expect a group to require a blacksmith blow crafted consumables on their behalf.
---
Rogues are a different story entirely. They don't blow consumables to pick locks. It's an included class feature. So in that case, I would absolutely expect the rogue to open locks for the group.
---
We can tenderly gather flowers with our paws, so the not use of pots must be ethical, not physical
---
No I'm not.
---
People who are not at the end already have dungeons and raids they can run.
---
That would be like adding a new lvl 50 dungeon. Sure you can do that, but why?
---
My guild has 2.. We wish they were Resto, but we're not going to force them to switch.
---
We do ask them to grab healing gear from our dungeon rushes cus we MIGHT need them to respec to Resto, we would pay for that respec if so.
---
Anyway, these are the rules we set beforehand and informed them about it, still not forced to do it.
---
My tip? Find a good group... Really... If they force u? Tell them politely but firmly, No.
---
i can't believe how much ya'll are putting me on blast for this advice lmao
---
1) thats how classic works man, you spam ninja looter in every world channel so others don't go through the experience. people in classic keep a long ignore list dude, and we have guild on my server already that no one will PUG raid with because of people like me putting them on blast
---
2) it's just an additional source of information. Lets say, for example, you got ninja looted and you want to screenshot the loot rules that were posted 2 hours ago in /raid - so you scroll up BUT WAIT, IT'S GONE! It's not gone from chatlogs, though.
---
3) Just don't use it man lol stick to stacked screenshots they look nicer anyway
---
Nah.  Those are two different things really.  By canceling you don't "support HK", you just don't support a company who would deal with China.
---
And lets be real, everyone claiming they'll cancel buys a ton of shit made in china and won't even bat an eye over any of it.
---
Don't worry about it.  
---
You will get it at level 43,
---
This is the critical difference, posting an item on the AH in WoW removes it from your inventory for the duration of the auction. On sites like Ebay you still hold the object of value and it's not uncommon to go with a multi-pronged approach: list it on other sites, local newspapers, street posts, ask around personally, etc. That's why you *have* to be able to cancel the auction.
---
Will he acknowledge it tho? XD
---
Just make sure you tell you‚Äôre party to all greed first
---
Uh oh gonna be so many Shaman tanks LFG tonight
---
By that logic, nobody should ever criticize anything unless they remove themselves entirely from being affected by it first.
---
Imagine if you told someone to leave the country every time they criticized the government or else they were just "virtue signaling".
---
They could follow the EverQuest model with ‚Äúprogression‚Äù servers. They start in original EQ and every X amount of time, they add an expansion. Then they do it again.
---
There are many concurrent progression servers in EQ, although their rules are a bit different from each other. But Blizzard could definitely say ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs a Classic Vanilla server, and over here is a Classic TBC server‚Äù. This would fracture the player base, but with so many people playing Classic, I think it could easily take a hit of some percentage moving to TBC servers.
---
Of course his analysis won't work because if you picked Ret pala you're beyond rationalizing already. In other words, you're getting carried and not realizing it (until next phases come out and bye bye most useless raiding class in game).
---
For what purpose? Generally, the AoE frost spec is designed for AoE grinding, vs. single target. Mixing them together just means you'll be worse at both and miss out on useful talents. But you can do dungeons fine as a the AoE build, and it's not like you can't do single target damage or anything, you're just slightly worse at it.
---
You can (and should, and will have to later anyway) respec at 60 to whatever you want to do after leveling.
---
TANKINI
---
You should try projecting more.

Along the lines of this joke and the resulting thread I just wanted to share an anecdote I once saw in Barrens chat...

Once DM comes out, priests can farm it with Holy Nova to great effect.
---
Well in this context there is an economic drive in having these addons and an economic drive in posting singles due to no posting fee on material items like ore and herbs. This won‚Äôt change until both of those things change. Let‚Äôs be realistic here.
---
sheep the hunters pet and make sure you nova them both if not sheep'd
---
Camping someone is disrespectful, ganking someone is not. Its basic gameplay.
---
But we will have to agree to disagree.
---
And even if it was, its a game, lighten up a little.
---
By chance did tinker track of time it took?   Gold you made?
---
Just curios as similar.  Lvl myself
---
It lets the market price for an item retain its value for longer, instead of a race to the bottom, more items will stay around their real value for longer, in addition to providing people with the exact amount of that material they need. I have like 400 runecloth saved up that I sell periodically one at a time because I don‚Äôt want to waste the deposit if no one needs to buy a stack of runecloth and instead just want to buy a few singles. 
---
Everyone wins, the only annoying thing is that you have to click more buttons, or find the guy who is selling a stack of the exact amount you need. Both of which are options and take time to find/ carry out.
---
So you‚Äôve never played a paladin?
---
Interesting how they respawned and didn't despawn roughly the same speed like everything else in the game.
---
Am I missing something? I don't see them at all on your link
---
You have a video source on that zero level 60s thing? Because apes had at least 20.
---
Now can you properly learn how to play a hunter? You can move in between shots btw.
---
It's definitely the nicer way to play(giving out food/water/healthstones). And definitely a mage who won't give the healer water is a dick(and maybe you shouldn't heal them). But the mage joined to be a DPS(imagine some world where the mage hasn't trained the spells to make water or food - which would be insane), and can still dps without giving away water and food. The healer joined to be a healer, and would really have a tough time being the healer with out casting any heals.
---
you can rotate the camera around the front of your character to take screenshots.

Hunter Pet Question - 39 NE Hunter, was fortunate enough to catch and tame Broken Tooth, love my angry little sparkplug kitty.  What is the next notable pet I should be on the lookout for over the next few levels? I have seen folks in zone chat saying King Bangalash is actually an upgrade over BT bc of higher armor- can anyone confirm?

Been really torn between a few classes, Rogue(37), Mage(49), Hunter(10)and druid (haven't started it). (tried warrior(25) for a bit but since I was fighting for what would be an alt between them, decided against it due to warriors investment) I've never really played a rogue at all, but I have mine to 37, and I've been loving it far more than I ever believed I would besides handling stealth, can be tedious going so slow. I always hear of horror stories of how hard it is to get pre-bis and how raids aren't needing too many since there's just so many rogues as well as just how competitive gear is as well as all the other issues. However, Rogue would be my alt I believe with my mage main ,Unless I decide to swap them later and just have my mage aoe farm and random things here and there maybe raid, So I've been on the fence on what I want as a main and as a alt.
---
 Since I'm not huge on Stealthing in dungeons,  I keep thinking on if I'd just enjoy my hunter more over all since that was my original main back in vanilla and I've missed it. Not sure if I should just level it later , casually and for fun just to relive the experience and stick out with getting pre-bis on rogue or to work on hunter and maybe make it a alt/main again. I do still enjoy mage and it's been fun but all I've been doing is mostly dungeon leveling so I'm just wanting to get it to 60 to actually enjoy it a bit more. Too many 60 horde harassing lately on my server to get much else done and often camping towns. Also, been debating on if I should drop LW on rogue for herb/alch or something and just farm money for devilsaur if I do stick with rogue. 
---
 Druid has been my main since Cata and I've always loved the aesthetics of it and the diversity. Been mostly a boomkin though and they don't seem to be good in classic... but usually enjoyed the entire class. I don't really know much about them besides that they are ok tanks , mediocre dps, and ok healers.
---
Unless said class has dots and is carrying a free action potion

They‚Äôre masterworks all. You can‚Äôt go wrong.
---
I did the /console ffsGlow 0 and it stayed for me.  Best decision I have done with WoW.
---
&gt; The obvious problem being a significant drop in melee mitigation, hence the need for crazy good gear.
---
Your right in a sence but the wrong way round. The reason for 2h fury tanking is for threat generation alone. The standard 11/5/35 is fine until naxx, but once people get geared threat generation is a major issue.
---
So warriors need to swap to max damage in order to control the bosses.
---
With consumables / proper shield wall cool down timing's (you still have a shield on you and use it) / faster kill times due to dps not having to hokd back. It is actually more survivability and mitigation in total, due to fight times being significantly shorter.
---
You said it yourself, this subreddit. This subreddit has been a classic circle jerk since it was announced.
---
The actual interview video, they let the broadcast continue, they kept their heads down.
---
It‚Äôs still a little rough haha, for now the calculator implies you are running the standard holy talents build. Its written above the source under the table
---
ret paladins are good for leveling bad for raiding. that's simple enough
---
You‚Äôre too late, I‚Äôve already reached out to those that are so proudly boycotting Blizzard, still haven‚Äôt gotten anything.  It‚Äôs just a bunch of big baby talk, we all know that none of them are actually cancelling their subs permanently and will be back playing as soon as this whole thing is no longer the hot topic to be milked.
---
When did I say most people? I am saying if we had a choice and all content phases were released at once, people could clear it in a week. When in the hell did I say most people completed stuff. I was stating a point that this game doesn't require a full long length update cycle to clear content.
---
First thing I thought when I saw mark if tyranny
---
Love it &lt;3
---
I‚Äôm also playing on a macbook air, it gets hot almost instantly lol
---
What you're supposed to do is make the person looking for the enchant buy the mats, trade you the materials, and then they tip you once you've applied the enchant to their gear.  That way, you dont have to worry about material cost and in a way, you're leveling up enchanting on their dime.  I guess you could run into problems leveling up this way if you're on a lower pop server, but this has been what most enchanters have been doing on Grobbulus.
---
I'm not supposed to feel bad for them. Stop that.
---
Congratz, when TBC gets released you will see how dead the vanilla servers get compared to TBC. Then you will know who the "everybody" i am talking about is. I love vanilla, but entitled people like you who don't care about anyone else and the majority of what people enjoy, just cause cancer to WoW
---
Warrior relies on getting the opener, if anyone ganks you its basically GG
---
I mean no one should assume people are all rolling Greed, it's just in a closer circle of guildies or friends they MIGHT defer it to a Tauren just due to it being not as special for an Undead to own this.
---
Ya just talking about pre-raid bis since that‚Äôs what most people will be going for in phase 1. Later on it‚Äôs a different story. They‚Äôre basically the most budget preraid bis class. Don‚Äôt really need intellect with lifetap (though it still helps obviously), so just straight +dmg is better for locks than other classes. Better gear always helps but as far as going into MC they can get away with way more greens than other classes
---
I main rogue. I‚Äôve always had everyone roll and I open it for the winner. It‚Äôs taken a group to clear to where the chest is so everyone has a roll at it.
---
Typically they arent doing them in singles because most of it wont sell that way.   Usually means eating the deposit costs.
---
Sending us their gold would be making a true statement! We are just trying to help them be taken seriously! Help me help you quitters!
---
What setting is this game running at?  Looks like a Playstation 1 game.
---
Solid job on the girth.
---
even better way to find a tank: https://i.imgur.com/XOxfDlc.png

I dunno man. If you can "clear everything in the first week" then I would expect to see many, many more level 60s running around.

Tips vs warlock!
---
Use your 'remove curse' ability to take away their curse.  Curse of Agony does high damage, curse of tongues make your casts take a lot longer, or curse of shadow makes their other shadow spells hit harder.  You'll probably only see curse of agony or curse of tongues. 
---
Save your counterspell for when you see them casting fear or shadowbolt.  If you successfully interrupt you can go for a lot of damage on them.  
---
Warlocks are simply a bad matchup for mages.  Your best option sometimes will be to sheep them and run.  Frost nova can buy you some time vs the pet, to simply nova and back away.  You can also sheep the pet as long as it isn't a felhunter (big spiky dog thing).  Felhunter have extremely high spell resistance so your spells will miss htem a lot. 
---
As a frost mage you'll want to try and get the "shatter combo" vs the lock.  Put ice barrier on yourself ASAP to hopefully re-cast it later!  Blink into melee range, try and get frost nova on both warlock + pet, and counterspell his fear or shadowbolt.  IMO as your spec, it's all about reducing damage (via remove curse and ice barrier), and setting up the combo of a frostbolt/fireblast/coc to hopefully get some crits and put pressure on him.  
---
It's also possible to just kill the pet if it's not a felhunter.  Voidwalkers are often used (big purple/blue blob) while questing and this pet isn't much of a threat to you.  It does low damage, and it's only PVP purpose is to give the warlock a big HP shield so it's useless to kill it.  If the warlock has an imp (tiny thing that casts fireballs) just kill it as it does high damage but has very low HP.  Succubus (sexy thong lady with a whip) is similar to the imp- try to sheep the warlock and kill the pet. 
---
It's a VERY hard fight, notoriously hard for mages.
---
I mean we're opening a huge can of worms as soon as you start talking about any kind of new content for classic. Voting at least puts *some* kind of push back from the player base on blizz, and that's why it's a 75% super majority. Ideally, this is done in conjuction with a modicum of respect for the "spirit of classic" so blizz would never even put things like LFG and flying mounts up for a vote, but yeah who knows.
---
&gt; Not to the degree you are espousing.
---
Yes it is. It's got more than double the healing 18-&gt;42 and almost double the mp5 4-&gt;7, at the cost of 2 useless stats (7spirit and 7fire res). It's also has more int and stamina.
---
It's MASSIVELY better.

You also cherry picked the belt which is a low budget slot.

The End of Dreams (t3 weapon)

13 int
---
13 sta

95 spell damage
---
now try and say that t3 weapon isn't an enormous upgrade.
---
I didn't even put the proper t3 healing weapon up there, because it wouldn't even be fair.
---
A good loot council takes many factors into consideration such as attendance, upgrade potential, and performance relative to a person's current gear level.
---
You can't bid on your own auctions (from your own account). You could still ask a friend or use a separate account, but that hurdle is significantly higher.
---
Absolutely not.  Not everyone has the need or money for an entire stack of anything, especially this early in the game. I'm not gonna list 20x something all week and lose my profits to deposits. 
---
Quit bitching and just play the game. If you don't want to buy 1x of something then don't buy it. It takes all of 45 seconds to find what you're looking for.
---
That's not what ninja looting is and I don't think you understand how hybrid classes work dude. Feral/NS is used in raids to heal AND tank, how the fuck do you get gear for both roles of people like you don't let us roll on gear that we aren't "spec'd" for
---
I agree with this.  If unlocked or grouped with a rogue, all roll. If a blacksmith had to use crafting materials to make a skeleton key to open, then it should be his.
---
A bid is no different than asking for offers. If you don‚Äôt like the offer then you can decline it. I don‚Äôt see why it‚Äôs such a big deal. Don‚Äôt expect to win bids at 10% of what people want. I‚Äôve made the mistake of listing bid minimums many times and I‚Äôll end up cancelling them.
---
i happen to agree with this
---
the sole reason My self and the rest of my officers had to purchase the train smasher in WOTLK is because members of the guild could not act like adults while being as old as adults
---
Drop the point out of anticipation. Defense is overrated.
---
Agreed! I will help support their views by accepting gold on Herod (Horde)

My suggestion *does* allow for Legendaries.

The minority wants the burning crusade. The need to take their time and let classic just be classic and focus on their retail game.

They'll care for a week, or two. Then it's back to business as usual.

---
Very hard to find those people consistently. Easier to carry around the mats myself, at least at this lvl
---
I'm saying you are the one aggressively asserting all this stuff.  I asked for a source and you're just telling me that "people" have cleared MC on a not private server with 25 people not level 60. 
---
Show me a video, show me it's not on a private server.  I'm not saying its not do-able, just that arguments with sources get you further than anything else.
---
Wanna make a rogue, debating on playing orc or dwaft. For solo pvp is Rogue easier or harder on any particular faction?
---
But where will the crybabies go when they need to vent their frustration at losing a virtual piece of gear?
---
I'm not condoning ninja looters, but that shit happens to everyone and no one cares. Just shitlist the ninja and move on.
---
Understand a lot of items in the game have a sort of hidden value you won‚Äôt understand at first. Like small flame sacs from whelplings or oily black mouths
---
Because so many of you were talking about the issues facing Hong Kong before this?  Go ahead and boycott Blizzard from your Chinese manufactured PC in your Chinese manufactured social justice t-shirt, you are really making a difference.
---
Eh, rogue still had to go out and level their skill, while the group has put in minimal effort to happen upon a chest. It‚Äôs the rogues choice as to how they handle it with the group, imo. But a Smith has put in more effort and gold, so the group has absolutely zero say while they can give a slight argument for a rogues case.
---
I can also edit the log before posting.
---
Oh perfect. I'm alliance so we won't cut into each other's profit.

Keep both and see how your mana sustain is.  If you notice that it's rough, equip the staff, otherwise keep the dagger for the faster kills.  That's basically what I'm doing, I have a bunch of alt pieces I can swap in depending on how im doing.
---
It‚Äôs a political stance isn‚Äôt it?
---
What if they changed the penalty to be based purely on buyout price or active bid or something rather than tying it to vendor value? That might make it less abusable for the things that have low vendor prices but high AH prices

Disc/shadow from 1-39 is great, as the entire middle of the shadow tree does almost nothing for you (after you get 5/5 spirit tap, 2/2 imp sw:p, and 1-2 points in shadow focus).  Meanwhile, the low level disc talents help both in leveling and dungeons (Inner Focus is amazing, especiallly in dungeons if you are cancel-casting and abusing the 5 second rule).  I never had to drink while leveling as disc/shadow, and in dungeons I was generally at 100% mana after each pull (well, except those all-aoe mage groups, ugh).
---
However, at 40, respeccing to all shadow (shadow form) kills so much faster it's not even funny.  You will have 5/5 shadow focus so you can kill higher level monsters very easily.  Your shadow wand (the quest reward from BFD or the 41 wand from the city vendor) benefits from your +15% shadow weaving debuff too.  I'll respec back to healing probably at 55+ or so, but my 43 shadow priest is just a chain killing machine right now.
---
If you haven't already, you really need to run BFD for the Gravestone Scepter (it's a quest reward).  This will hugely help your leveling.
---
Same.  There was a moment where I actually panicked a second since I didn't see my server or my number of characters.  I have been ignoring the tabs at the bottom since US was just the one tab for the longest time.  I had to search on Reddit to realize the region was split in the U.S.
---
An added bonus of linen is that singles don't have a listing fee. He can put thousands of them up for max duration and it'll cost nothing to do it.
---
I‚Äôm at 55 with a probably 50% of both Felwood and WPL done. Felwood has been pretty shit to be honest and WPL is so busy. I‚Äôll probably try burning steppes next and see how that goes. Grouping for BRD is fucking painful.
---
Until I saw your name/server I thought for sure you were a NEPriest I tried to gank the other day (Horde druid) a few weeks ago.  I got the drop and thought I had it for sure, he got a fear off and ran but I'm like "we good, I can chase him down".  Well I knew the general area he was in but thens hadowmeld went off.  It took me FOREVER to find him cuz there was tons of tree cover, and by the time I did he was 70%+ mana, 30% hp, and fear was back so he just feared me again, healed, and ran again.  He ran to a group of friendly NPCs so I knew he was safe.  Shadowmeld SAVED HIS BACON completely.

That rule is not vague, it‚Äôs simple. Focus on the game and the tournament not matters unrelated to the actual subject. All of the competitors are aware of this rule.  Those competitors represent blizzard, just like any other employee at any other company, most companies don‚Äôt like to make political statements of any nature, and would rather avoid those issues as they do not relate to the businesses goal or mission. 
---
I‚Äôm not about to comment on who deserves to be offended or who isn‚Äôt considered the public. That‚Äôs not what this is about.
---
I was thinking about this earlier. Since it says "Names must be blurred if people are portrayed in a negative light" I wonder if you can just portray them in a positive light. 
---
"Ran with BadGuyRogue on MadeUpServer and I can't say enough nice things about his ninja looting. He is simply the best ninja. Top tier, really love the guy. If you're looking for a ninja on MadeUpServer then make sure to group with BadGuyRogue!!! :D :D :D"
---
Alright, will do. Thanks!
---
Nobody, left mouse rotates camera. I also turned off the smart camera feature so my camera wouldn't snap back into place when I released.
---
Not hard to get there took me ~2 minutes to get the correct walljump and bounced on in.
---
To get to that point was ~20 minutes ride with 60% mount. The zone is HUGE. Spent over an hour exploring, fun zone would have really loved to see it in classic. It is very different from TBC and beyond Hyjal that's for sure.
---
Your entire post is a lot of conjecture and "wow you're just so super duper confused dude daggers are good because you're confused."
---
&gt;and doing grossly better in numbers than you
---
I've yet to see that. Not saying it isn't possible, but again, your entire argument implies I'm just so confused about a dagger rogue doing damage. I'm not. I played rogue in vanilla as well, and my experience has been *exactly* the same concerning swords vs daggers. The difference isn't enormous, but it's big enough that your argument just seems ridiculous.
---
&gt;If you only get to stay in melee for 4 seconds, 2 backstabs is gonna beat out 3 sinister strikes. This is the largest reason why dagger outperforms imo.
---
Those fights are few and far between. Even Baron isn't like that.

Dire maul is a dungeon. I‚Äôd understand if they dropped BWL or even honor/PvP then it would be rushed but it‚Äôs not. A lot of people have been doing MC/Ony for weeks now as I have for 3 weeks now so it‚Äôs really not a big deal.
---
The NSFW tag made the post
---
Round the outside
---
&gt; The burden of proof is on you,
---
So, let me get this straight, you make an assertion and you don't have to prove shit, yet I need to prove mine? Okay, that makes perfect senes.
---
&gt; It doesn't make sense.
---
No, what doesn't make sense is to make statements about what happens when bad players are involved because it's completely random.
---
Healing 5 mans is much easier than tanking 5 mans imo. Really only problem is people rushing when you're out of mana but a simple "drinking" or "oom" fixes that 95% of the time.
---
Minority? Vanilla is the least played version of the game, not only on official servers, but also on private servers. TBC and Wrath, is the fan favorite for probably 90% of people who play WoW. It is most definitely the majority. Streamers like asmongold, sodapoppin, all the biggest influencers literally would delete all their classic progress just to reroll on TBC and Wrath. They have stated it many times. The majority of the community would do the same.
---
&gt; What I didn't notice while posting was that the addon set extremely low bid price,
---
Well, it sucks for you but if you blindly trust the addon...
---
Don't you get a character that is at the base level of the new expansion when you buy the game? I wouldn't spend my time leveling up to the expansions, that's prolly not too fun.
---
Maybe I misunderstood what you meant by "you can just clear all content in the first week"
---
You may as well kill lvl 5 boar then.
---
What‚Äôs fun about killing people who can‚Äôt fight back? I do enjoy fighting people in my level range because it‚Äôs an actual fight.....
---
I don‚Äôt find enjoyment from upsetting other people who are minding their own business. That‚Äôs weird man.
---
It really isn't. Taunts are fundamentally different in that they automatically put you at the TOP of the threat meter, regardless of where you were before.
---
Ah. Yeah that's a bit of a problem, as it doesn't let you compare different specs; There's the "standard" 21/30/0 but then there' also 26/25/0 which is almost always technically better for most of Phase 1 content, 31/0/20 shadow weaving builds, 31/20/0 PI builds... There's a lot of viable priest healing specs.
---
There was a post on here awhile ago, can't remember where the person was flying to. But he had about a 400ping and eventually ended up being unplayable the further he got out to sea. He said he got a couple hours play in
---
Q: What do you call it when you publicly criticize people for virtue signaling?
---
A: Virtue signaling.
---
You want to drop the firey enchant in MC, as basically everything is immune to fire. Poisons do work in raid, but don't use deadly, use instant as otherwise it will chew up a debuff slot on the boss which is capped at 16 and not worth the slot. If you are horde you will probably get windfury which does not stack with poisons, so leaving poison off your main hand is smart.
---
Didn't expect DM to be released so early but oh man does it make me glad that I bought the 2 diamonds for less than 4g each about 2 weeks ago when I was like level 30.

---
The difference is that
---
1. you can in turn outbid the other player
---
2. you get your bid back as soon as you got outbid, not when the auction ends
---
3. an item has actually changed ownership for a fee, the intent and purpose of the auction house
---
4. less token auctions you have to sift through if you're actually looking to buy something (very relevant for people who don't have an AH addon)
---
They are not. Warriors can go and collect a few AoE cosumables and items that proc of getting hit and tank HUGE pulls way better than a paladin, because they actually have cooldowns.
---
And it cuts into the Chinese gold farmer market so double win for them if the person they give gold to would have otherwise paid for gold.

Dead zone the hunter too. How I fight them, or did. I'm not playing Mage this time around. Most hunters are BM. When you see beastial wraith come out, ice block and wait it out, blink to the hunter wait for the pet to catch up, nova. Stand in between the 5 yard melee and 8 yard starting range distance, poly the pet, blast the hunter, making sure not to hit the pet with Cone of Cold or another Nova. Just keep him locked in the dead zone and you win.
---
I don't speak a word Russian myself, so if anyone can translate what the quest and kid says, that would be awesome :)
---
And that's fine, but I wouldn't expect for blizzard to hold on releasing any new content just because you are not trying to level up. The content was released in a similar pace 15 years ago when people were really bad and clueless compared to now.
---
Dungeons or MC wont become obsolete, even if you level up really fast. I wouldnt worry about finding groups for them
---
So this was talked about a bit in chat apparently like 2 people just reflexively rolled greed, and the others didn't want to fuck them over. World chat gossip though so take it with a grain of salt.
---
Was he Alliance? They have that Light of Elune item that makes you invulnerable for a short time.
---
Yep, did this from level 30+. Didn't start getting rough until Sunken Temple where I'd put on a shield after using sweeping+WW. Never did less than 35% of the groups damage while tanking everything. 
---
This meme is a bad cope from a salty shaman.

This is the part that scares me the most. #studentlife I guess

Hypocritical bullshit, if you ask me.  You'll take a stand when videogames are on the line, but where's your outrage for other exploitative industries?  You have a cellphone?  Wear shoes?  Tshirts?  Toys for your kids?
---
Also right before inscription was released I spent weeks gathering low-mid level herbs to sell for people who wanted to speed level it... had two bank rooms full and I made thousands of gold in one night... good times :)
---
I'd go as far to say \*especially\* on an item everyone can use. If one person can use it and no one else can everyone rolling need is pretty messed up.

Totally agree that that person is an asshat. But they aren't obligated to do anything, just as you aren't obligated to group with them ever again.

The real question here: What do you think about the BS/rogue + locked chest scenario?

Titanpanel :)

This is sooooo truuue

If we're pretending that LP is not a group utility... Why would I invite a rogue over every other class that has group utility? I don't think a DPS class should make themselves less attractive for group invites but it's your body, your choice.
---
yeah, that's what I said.
---
Providing an alternate play style would bring in a lot of people on its own.  Also, its not as if people don't play alts.
---
Humm? Nah, I'm not quitting, are you kidding? This game rocks.
---
No amount of US sub cancellations would cancel out the sales Blizz/Act makes in China, there is no way they are going to go back on their stance that what happened was against their rules at the risk of losing license to operate there.
---
Just making the note that all the anti-posts are just as hypocritical as the unsubber crowd and only serve the purpose of being contrarian.
---
I think I had a dagger that was similar to this, and I didn't even think twice about selling it.  No stats, a chance to do some fire damage.
---
Sucks that they ninja'd the loot, but it isn't that great.  I'm also kind of put off that the damage tracker is included in this as if 1.3K is anything to shame.  Just because you do more damage than everyone else doesn't entitle you the loot.  If you need the loot then fine, but not because you are the highest damage dealer.
---
I sure hope we don't get into this rut like we did.  Feels too much like when we had that fucking Gear Score shit.
---
Again sorry the ninja stole your item.  It's not that insane though.

Make sure you /join LookingForGroup in game if you haven‚Äôt and join a guild and link up with other members if you haven‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt see too many mage only groups in 50s being adverted because I think it‚Äôs more of a SM thing.

Im pretty confident agi is only one ap, although id probably still use voshgajin. Like the other guy says, though, sc is better than both, and probably cheap.

I agree with every point you made. I am only posting since everyone else feels the need to call you names.

I've seen those trolls and showed them to my girlfriend exactly because Marukai is the name of a japanese imports store in her city. Funny to know that it's more or less the inspiration behind it, too

Honestly I'd like to see a poll, but I'd bet (a small amount of) money that at least 25% of the playerbase would be opposed to dungeon finder as it exists in retail. At the very least, it would not include the auto dungeon TP.
---
This is going to be hilarious, hope no one from your guild spots you here.
---
&gt; Nah, it's close to 100%, bosses, other than rag and ony, don't have time to kill your pet.
---
So where did you get this information from, **have you seen it in action before? Where? Which player? Was there a video? Was it a streamer? Is it someone else in the guild?** It must have happened in the real world, and not in your head. Can you give us a chance to see this too? Why or why not?
---
&gt; No goalposts are moved because as I said, you're always talking about what competent players are capable off, not a shit tier player like myself, if you just look at what can happen when bad players are involved, then literally any assertion can be made.
---
Okay, now we know you're shit tier raider, telling someone else asking for advice that the pet can have decent uptime. You may have to tell him where you got that information from, since we have concrete data points showing pets die but are still wanting to see the close to 100% pet log. 
---
Have you seen it in action before? Where? Which player? Was there a video? Was it a streamer? Is it someone else in the guild? **It must have happened in the real world, and not in your head**. Can you give us a chance to see this too? **Why or why not?**

"More people will come if we have punch and pie!" - Eric Cartman

Yeah I tried it at winterspring, but mainly did in Felwood, because I was able to AoE pull huge packs (min4-12mobs) at a time. Depending on the competition alot.

Or we sit in town cause we don't have to level anymore :P

Too small of a bulge, we all know orcs are packin‚Äô
---
They are the best tanks, the best DPS and the best PVP class in a group setting (no one else has 50% healing debuff, not to mention ZERO downtime with a healer). Also the main class designers that came over from EQ had massive boners for the warrior class and fully intended to make them the best in the game, which they are.
---
Honest question here: what improvement are they providing the rest of the melee that a resto shaman cant also provide while also contributing good healing?
---
I'm in the same boat as you. Pretty much just use TSM for the bid/buyout sniper, because I can't get the other parts to work.
---
No one is saying you cant. 
---
But stop using morality as the reason. 
---
You don‚Äôt agree with how they handled it? Completely fine boycott them for it. 
---
Just stop using morality as the reason. Because you come off as a hypocrite who is virtue signaling.
---
Damn nice! :)
---
Not sure about international but I played for 3 hours on a Delta flight here in the states. 40-60 latency the whole time
---
Why would you buy all bank slots? That seems like a huge waste of money for no reason. You could have just used a bank alt.
---
But then there's no "trick". Outside you can just hearth and get summoned when you're ready to return.

&gt; obviously his base bar has keybinds,

&gt; you got to 60 without any keybinds?

&gt; **without any keybinds**

idk how much simpler i can make it for you sorry buddy :(

Try changing the resolution of your game.

Incidentally if you wave at someone from the opposing faction while you're travelling the roads, they'll make some strange gestures

Wasn't too bad going over the Atlantic. Saw some DCs and some latency spikes, but I could solo without too much issue. Didn't try to do instances, and certainly died more often than usual.

It's just a game, so please try to remember that it's not a single-player game. The characters you grief aren't NPCs. They're people. Stop griefing lowbies for your own entertainment.

When you click on the following quest in your link there is a comment saying the quest chain ends there and how they spoke with a GM about it as well.  It may have heen expanded upon in expansions but not in vanilla.
---
I always had a soft spot for these two.. 
---
The revamped SM where Whitemane cries out for Morgraine when she dies is beautiful.

Even after all those years. She still calls to him for aid.

I am not an enchanter, but still figuring out whether I should reroll tailoring, because I have the mage chest already.
---
Ah, the classic "as long as I get something out of it I don't give a fuck about fascism" routine.
---
As someone without a blacksmith or a rogue I have no problem with the locked chest being rolled on just by those who can open them.  If they tell everyone to roll it is appreciated, but not expected from me.
---
My apologies, I've been seeing this comment more and more, and it's ridiculous but I'm just now realizing that I'm not packaging the zip like other addons do. I'll fix that asap.
---
70 spell damage in a single slot a pittance? 
---
You're not being intellectually honest here.
---
do you want to run around with a full inventory until your stuff sells to make it "real"?
---
BIS until phase 5, then it gets replaced by Ectoplasmic Distiller.
---
Yes minority. Of course all of us wow veterans enjoyed the burning crusade but the majority don't want it to go past classic and then to wrath and then to a dead game I don't wanna play. Go listen to what people are saying and every post on the World of Warcraft forms that mention the burning crusade get down voted people don't want that.  Because the blizzard World of Warcraft classic forms would say that maybe 2% of players actually want the burning crusade
---
Why don't people like resistance fights? Does it have to do with the fight itself somehow? Or is it resenting having to accumulate gear for this one fight that doesn't help you elsewhere?
---
Because if that's the objection then that resistance is already baked into the idea. We already know vertical progression is more compelling than horizontal progression. People aren't suggesting horizontal to make the raids better. They are doing so in order to help fit the new raids into the existing game.
---
Sounds good I'm happy to roll on either! My bt is Alex#25194.

It used to but now since a ton of people are using auctioneer and putting 100s of single auctions up, its hard to sell a stack of 20 easily since going through pages of those singles, to the stacks, takes quite a bit. So the strat is thus, set the bid on 1c and the buyout at a reasonable buyout like you would regularly. This puts your stuff at the very top and exponentially increases the chance of it selling.
---
Another reason current retail is lackluster.  Visually great but it lost a lot of its social aspect.
---
Everyone should wear the whinne the poo meme shirt.
---
Lol wtf
---
Just don't ask Blackbeard about Redbeard!
---
The main attributes were the pittance.
---
It's good spell damage but it is by no means game-breaking.
---
I like it.
---
How is that different then what we have now?
---
I started an alt of an Orc Shaman thay I really like so far. I really want to use it in PvP but I'm hesitant to go resto, like so many people advise.
---
Does anyone have some tips/tricks for mid/high level PvP for either an enhance or ele Shaman? I'm mostly familiar with how rogues handle.
---
Mages and rogues are pretty similarly populated from the metrics I've seen. That wasn't the case in vanilla, where rogues were more common than mages by a pretty wide margin, so that's why people claim it's hard to find groups as a rogue. So, just play the class you enjoy because finding dungeon/raid spots should be pretty much the same level of difficulty between mage/rogue.
---
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmaaaaaaaah ha! The French!
---
For Golemagg, what hole are you talking about?
---
I'd legit love to see a Shaman in dungeon gear tank a dungeon boss like Baron in UD Strath. Without an S-tier healer and S-tier DPS to kill boss super fast before healer OOMs, I just don't see that being possible. 
---
I'm at 56% mitigation as a Prot war + 10% Def stance mitigation and he still MS's me for 1k on top of the 1k shadowbolts. I save my Shield Wall and Last Stand for that guy.
---
To shard them is my caaause
---
Awesome PSA, I'm sure none of us would have noticed.
---
+healing is based cast time, spells with the same cast time get the same amount of bonus healing per cast
---
Honestly it‚Äôs really complicated if you try to look up the formula, and HoTs and Crits make is even more complicated 
---
But the simple nugget of knowledge is the lowest rank spell with the highest cast time gets the most value out of it in terms of mana cost to healing provided
---
With zero +healing gear the highest level spell is the most mana efficient in terms of mana to healing.
---
Higher level spells are still more efficient even considering +healing- if the lager heal allows you to spend more time regening mana.
---
For example chain casting rank 4 vs casting rank 8 once every 30 seconds.
---
This game runs on a toaster, I play it on my lunch breaks on integrated Intel graphics just fine
---
I've heard about the deadzone thing before. I guess I have to practice and learn how to stay in that range, thanks for the tips!
---
Damn that looks cozy asf.
---
Allow players to spend double currency to also bolster their min roll or something.
---
Oh yeah in that case its fun hehe.
---
You explained in your post that you are using an ability to evade guards. Are you being intentionally dumb?
---
Once you're PVP flagged, is there a way to become unflagged again?
---
I always kept both on me. Deploy the train while running so nobody can tell you did it, then let it annoy for a second and destroy it. You get to be the villain AND the hero.
---
A Priest's Power Word: Shield.
---
Use your CC...a lot. Especially against hunters. Sheep the pet, blink to hunter&gt;frost nova&gt;and the setup your shatter combos. Same goes for warlocks (use decurse to keep Dots from ticking too long) 
---
Rogues are pretty easy once you get the hang of it. 
---
Priests...GLHF.
---
I got banned for the same thing if this counts as terrain exploitation this game is a joke

I only mean it jokingly. Back in Vanilla my Aunt and Uncle played Everquest 1 and 2 and would give me a good shiyte talking for playing WoW and not playing Everquest with them. They'd call me a WoW carebear who's afraid of real RNG and I'd call them a bunch of emo muppets, cause they were both the "cat people" race. Can't think of the name.
---
There are still queues?

Scorpio Sting

But why move farther away if he is going to finish it off with once it reaches him? This is the most efficient way because there is less travel time.

I think if its a rog, then group since thats part of the utility you bring to the group over say fury war or mage--akin to food/water. But if its a profession, then its yours since it actually costs something for the smith to unlock.

I came here to post this, and I'm glad I'm not the only one.  Crotch bulge WAY too small.
---
I had this in vanilla. It's always sounded like a harp.
---
Pretty sure pallies can farm Dire Maul east
---
I think they're fine. They put me to sleep, woke up two hours later, procedure was finished, didn't feel too much pain the next week.
---
I'm not the one downvoting you. As I said, your advice is true for pretty much anyone but a tank. It may or may not be applicable for him. When he switches back to pve, should he rebind his S key? That was what I was trying to contribute to the topic. You're absolutely right. It's a horrible idea to back pedal in pvp, but there's no reason to unbind your S key if you're going to need it for pve.
---
Yeah, guards in any city are meant to protect inhabitants. If you are pvping in a city and are evading the guards, that is the exploit. I've seen several posts regarding people who were warned about it. If what you are saying is true it sounds like he was a little to severe. Feels like we're missing a part of the story.
---
You replied directly  to me, not the thread, so obviously I would respond. but you're right- the core of your argument  seems fucking retarded. Carry on.
---
The guy is right about gpm. Doesn't matter what you farm. That's what the AH and /trade is for.
---
Hey, don't know if you'll see this but I would love to get your addon and it still isn't showing up in Twitch
---
So I can't use my own abilities to avoid guards, like Water Walking into the bay, but a Rogue can use Vanish and that's okay?
---
I get the feeling from Blizzard and players that I must allow myself to be attacked (and presumably killed) by guards if I want to fight in a town and that in itself sounds silly.
---
Syndicate would be even more impressive!
---
It's a joke
---
Yes. It really brings no value to anyone. Only if customer service failed you over a valid complaint would I think it's ok.
---
What's the point of a starting price then?
---
I don't speak Russian, so if anyone is able to translate the quest and what the kid says, that would be much appreciated :)
---
What‚Äôs the one shot big damage bit that the shaman has?
---
Unfortunately for me my mac is now too old to run WoW. Never use it, but it's the only laptop I own. Was out of town for work when i discovered the video adaptor is no longer supported by Blizzard with their new engine.
---
If you're going alliance then hunter since you will have basically zero competition for loot at 60. If you're going horde then play whatever, both can be monsters in PvP if played correctly but hunters have a higher skill ceiling while warlocks are pretty easy to play well if that matters.
---
Here comes another freaking big instance
---
Proof to me this reddit is dominated by total idiots.
---
This is PERCEIVED going fast. Posts like this is why retail is trash, listening to casuals. LFR is because of casuals. Gear normalization is because of casuals. Ability pruning and gcd changes is for casuals. FUCK THIS SHIT.
---
Rag drops 4. Magmadar dropped 3 for us last night. 
---
I think they can drop 2-3 because there is a shared loot table in addition to the regular 2 drops from the actual table they have.
---
If you're starting off the fight against a rogue, the rogue will always be at a major disadvantage since they lose access to their openers. As for kiting them, that's what [FAPs](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=5634/free-action-potion) and [LAPs](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=20008/living-action-potion) are for, but people aren't investing into those much right now since PvP doesn't mean much.
---
I like the shadow guard from trolls more...  But if you are happy hiding go on ;-p
---
P. S.  : most people won't consider hiding and do non interactive trickery to make poor but good looking horde heroes jumping down cliffs as an honorable tale to tell.
---
Lol guys new hat
---
I've experienced a similar (not exactly the same) bug with the Carrot.  I had my Rune of the Guard Captain in slot 13 and for 10 levels manually right clicking my carrot swapped it no problem, clicking ROTGC put it back into the same spot.  
---
Once I got Blackhands Breadth it began automatically replacing Hand of Justice, no matter which slot it was in.
---
I dont really see any way around your issue without a macro, I suppose the easiest would be to make an unequip macro for Carrot, then click whatever trinket you want to replace it.  Definitely not ideal
---
Read that as lesbians, best-in-slot, and straights.
---
Took me a moment to realize it wasn‚Äôt a weird way  to describe pansexuals.
---
To start a bid war.
---
You'll have to find a more laid back group to let you in as enhance. Most guilds are too "try hard" to take anything sub-optimal into a raid.
---
To clarify, my guildies have oft brought a severly underleveled player to instances because why not? The other day we did ST with 3 50+'s and me and another priest both at 43 (or thereabouts). Basically the final boss was 11 levels higher than us, which doesnt matter because we were healing. 
---
I also did all of SM as a level 30 healer (including Cath) and couldn't wear my Whitemane Chapeau for 9 levels. 
---
I mean, it's probably not as efficient, but we don't wipe and we have fun. : )
---
So you would fault a rogue for sneaking into Stormwind and vanishing to avoid guards? Should that rogue be banned too?
---
You can pop a head in each "layer".
---
But that assumes your whole raid is in a fresh layer that hasn't popped in within the 3 hour limit.
---
Our server popped an onyxia head an hour before our raid time. Half the people got it in layer 1. Everyone else in layer 2 did not get it.
---
Layer 2 player invited everyone to layer 2 to form a raid. We popped onyxia head in layer 2 and everyone in that layer got the buff.
---
&gt; So where did you get this information from, 
---
From looking at logs and realizing every time a pet has died someone fucked up.
---
&gt; Feel free to actually tear my analysis apart, saying the logs are misrepresented doesn't make it so.
---
Well, lets start by you claiming my pet died on geddon when it's easily provable that's not true.
---
I highly recommend Aux. The interface takes a bit getting used to, but once you do it's sooooo nice.

I'm just sitting here laughing at your trash comments, ahhaha, virgin
---
Some items, e. g. enchanting mats, don't require a deposit though.
---
The reason is I'm level 21 single target build but wanted to play AoE to speed up the grind, rn my gameplay is spam frostbolt (gets boring really fast)
---
Yeah it's super annoying especially on a PvP server.
---
lol at first I thought somebody figured out how to replace the generic background with an individual one and I wanted to ask how to do this, too
---
He didn't add any controls to his other action bars or change 7+ on the original bar.
---
You should click that Reply button, otherwise your comments don't have any context.
---
Omg. Yeah same!! Waiting for an answer with you fam.

if it helps me murder Hordies I'm good
---
Probably not the comment he needed after grinding out exalted *specifically for the trinket*. But hey, that's just my 2c.
---
Really? I never got any incoming heals with Vuhdo. Switched to Luna and it's working out of the box.
---
By no means game breaking. Ok. You obviously never played in the Naxx era.
---
Semantics unclear. Please re-explain.
---
It would be really weird to cancel sub because of this issue, but still give gold so others can keep playing. I canceled, and am not sharing since I do not want to motivate people to keep playing.
---
Exactly, so that's why I'm asking if it has been updated in the last... 12 years
---
I am farming.....wait a second...
---
&gt; that's no reason to be an idiot and pretend that not a single thing Blizz has done since then was good.
---
This is a gross mischaracterization of what /u/TriflingGnome said.
---
The rep threshold for it isn't that much of a backbreaker to do since you can just group kill for it, attainable in prob 4-6 hours solo if your goal is just to get that enchant when P2 comes.
---
I always fly Jetblue now for the free in-flight WiFi... I got like 120ms ping time the whole way from MCO to JFK. I'm pretty sure they're using ground based stations now instead of satellite like they used to.

You have to exit and re-open the shop window.

---
Yea we are

maybe a /cancelaura [nocombat, stealth] Prowl 
---
Just guessing, though.
---
If your main is a healer, you could level a melee alt quicker than solo by being on follow and healing them. Pretty sure dungeon boosting isn‚Äôt great unless you have a mage main account with some gear to just bomb dungeons. It‚Äôs probably ok at certain level ranges tho.
---
Rather than questing and then doing a thousand BRD runs with people who don‚Äôt want to do your specific boss, just grind the entire way in BRD until 56-57 and start doing LBRS instead. It‚Äôs tremendously better to be 60 with a lot of the pieces you already need out of there and can focus on other things. And the XP is pretty good.
---
Even more geoguessing, Winnipeg by chance today? Lol
---
Skill scores for everything, I don't have any idea how that could've worked out.
---
Thanks, I had a similar idea in mind. Just thought it would feel cool to have both.
---
Is the rogue in a place that the guards cannot physically get to? 
---
You know the answers to all of your questions. Do you want a congratulations for killing the opposite faction abusing guard mechanics?
---
It‚Äôs not an exploit, it‚Äôs being clever. Instead of banning players for using class specific spells (water walking), increase the range at which they detect players attacking
---
If it was it wont be in Classic.
---
Wishing to skip 1/6 of the game's content.  Cool.
---
Luna unit frames is pretty common and has it built in, otherwise HealComm adds it to other unit frames I believe. Luna is not available from twitch though so you'd have to get it from [github](https://github.com/Aviana/LunaUnitFrames/releases).
---
Yeap!
---
Yeah it‚Äôs optimal imo
---
I'm glad you asked. I'm sitting here following the useless red arrow wondering why the fuck a steel helm is screenshot. Back and forth... Steel Plate Helm...ok...*looks at bottom arrow* yep looks like plate armor...ok...
---
I am unaware of any such assumption. It's not about Haves vs Have Nots. It's about protecting the integrity of content. Do you think raiders who gear out on a new raid should be able to rotflstomp former High Warlords/Grand Marshals? Because I think that breaks the PvP gear system. And when an elite raiders can solo Dire Maul and the like that trivializes that content. 
---
This isn't some SJW trick. It's about making the game as a whole better. There are a multitude of things to do in WoW. If that were not true, if it weren't an MMO RPG and just a raid simulator then vertical progression through the roof would be totally fine. That's not the game you signed up for.
---
Bucklers were an item akin to baby shields, meant for Rogues and Hunters.
---
Yes, as long as you don't try to accept summon into a dungeon from outside.
---
That's the exact intention, they don't want pvp in towns
---
Most rotations for classes get stale and repetitive after enough time. For the class that you play, what makes you enjoy it outside of the specific leveling rotation?
---
So you don't pay for all the other products you use? brilliant
---
It's a pretty giant leap, kinda oddly defensive too.
---
23rd November 2004 vanilla wow was released 
---
Molten Core was released with the original game and remained undefeated 154 days, which is still the longest an endboss has survived in WoW's history.
---
Dire Maul¬†was¬†added¬†in World of Warcraft patch 1.3 all the way back in March 2005
---
So yes it was released before it was cleared . People took forever to get past MC. Now guilds clear it in under an hour. How times have changed.
---
Historically, Blizzard has never done anything to address faction imbalance. There have been servers in retail vanilla that were 90% one faction and they never did anything about it. Hard to say if they'll do anything about it now but I wouldn't get your hopes up.
---
What is its current behavior when not in cat and out of combat?
---
Lol my name now as it was in og vanilla is Grizzlybeard
---
That is how it worked last week for us. However, they recently made changes to how sharding/layering works when they updated the realm statuses and segregated realms. Everyone was on same layer as we all left Molten Core as a group and took same portal. No Onyxia head was popped on our layer. We popped it with entire raid on same layer and no RP event took place and no buff. It appears to be sharing a cooldown with other layers.
---
Got any tips for a newbie? Seems like most people are saying stick with enhance until mid-40s, leather is best, and weapon type doesn't matter and DPS is king
---
Then they wouldn't allow it.
---
People seem to be unaware of how much they use that is made from China. Cancelling a Blizzard subscription is fine, but anything more than that is inconvenient.
---
I don‚Äôt understand this
---
is it possible to 5man UBRS?

Against warlocks, you want to see an imp or a voidwalker next to them.  These are the 'easy' 1v1 fights.  If they have a felhunter (demon dog) or none at all, it's going to be rough.  The felhunter has massive resists, will dispel your buffs, and can counterspell you (as if you had enough reasons to hate warlocks).  If you don't see any pet, odds are they have a succubus.  She is the highest dps pet and is also very fragile.   So while you can kill her quick, odds are, you'll be seeing pink hearts over your head as she CCs you while the lock dots you up then fears you until you die.
---
Priests (of all types) are not an easy fight for you.  They can dispel all your buffs, including ice barrier, have a nasty single dot, and can generally outlast your damage.  You need to pray to RNGesus for back to back crits and that they are low on mana.  Burst beats heals, as long as you can keep it up.  If you give them a moment to heal, it will not be pretty for you.  Also, mana burn is super bad for you.  I can drain your mana very quickly and due to my higher regen and wand damage, you'll suffer the worst fate, being wanded to death.
---
Shamans are very limited against a mage. I believe their silence is "Earth Shock" which is a 10 yard, untalented, spell.  It has a fairly short cooldown and is a counterspell, not a silence.  You can outplay this by casting off school spells or play chicken to bait the earthshock out.  If you cancel the cast prior to their earth shock, you can cast frost until the spell is off CD, maybe 10-15 seconds, don't recall.  Essentially, if you think they will earthshock your next frost spell, start casting and immediately stop.  Use a macro, move, jump, etc.  They also have a totem, "grounding totem" that will redirect spells.  If you see this, the shaman is probably rather skilled, as it's not the easiest to use.  Shamans have no gap closers aside from slows.  If you can stay out of melee range, it's an easy kill.  Just know they will purge your shields and barriers.  Also, if they are at range casting a lightening bolt, it will be rough for you.  Elemental shamans are terrifying.
---
Clever use of game mechanics is rarely meant literally. Layer hopping was pretty clever too wasn't it?
---
It puts me in stealth, as intended.
---
If pressed again out of combat, it does nothing
---
100% of the time in pvp ( especially if youre a melee class ) you should be using your mouse to turn. ( if you hold right click and move on your keyboard. Your mouse acts as your head ex - hold right click and W. As you move your mouse left and right your charecter will run in the direction of your mouse movements )
---
I didnt explain that too well but you get the idea.
---
My point being - dont just stand there and trade hits with your opponet, quickly get behind him using mouse turning so he in turn has to turn around to hit you - and if youre a keyboard turner, the fights already over. You can just rinse and repeat running behind him mouse turning because keyboard turning is horrible for pvp
---
 backpedaling is bad because you move so slowly. A slow target is a dead target. Rather then backpedal to keep her infront of you, jump behind her and mouse turn to stay on target and force her to turn around to attack you.
---
It changes pre-bis a bit and means other dungeons wont get run as much.  
---
For me its no big deal since I ran the initial dungeons a bunch already.
---
Dire maul is a good dungeon overall, and doesnt make everything obsolete however. It will influence other dungeon farming negatively, also rich thorium veins in dire maul so arcanite will probably drop a bit. It doesnt make other items completely obsolete however. Changes prebis lists a bit, but only by like 20-30%. So overall its more good than bad. More content while not making initial dungeons obsolete. Good game design unlike in retail where new content make anything else obsolete.
---
I get that it‚Äôs a pvp server and I‚Äôm on one too. 
---
I guess I just don‚Äôt like to waste my time with low level trash and actually do things that benefit my character

I always appreciate that I got feared and end up in there. It seems to be a safe place.
---
Would be curious what the raid frames look like and where you put them
---
&gt; What did he drop?
---
Unless you can res, don't peak before everyone's back in the raid because there's a small chance that it will mess up and despawn before everyone runs back. Better safe than sorry.
---
We literally did it yesterday so I know it still works.
---
I‚Äôve personally cleared rend with a 5 man. Not sure about drak but beast should be doable.
---
It's always sunny
---
I have no idea what it is, but as soon as they get into melee range they deal a stupid amount of damage
---
See, I've read this elsewhere too and I find it confusing. Holy Nova is a point blank AOE. Meaning you actually have to run into agro range of mobs to use it and hence don't get to take advantage of range to whittle down mobs before they get to you. Wouldn't it be quicker to simply Mind Blast from range rather than run in face first to Nova mobs?
---
Not being snarky ... it's a serious question and one I don't personally have an answer to.
---
I'll put this to the test and hopefully not get banned!
---
I also use Aux, got used to it from my time on pservers. I was a novice user of TSM on retail.
---
The way I explain it to guildies that ask is: Aux is basically if you took TSM and stripped out all the power trading stuff and turned it into what "most" people need/want out of an AH addon.
---
That's not the best explanation, but it's the best ELI5/one line explanation I can come up with.
---
Wrong. I'm infinitely better than warriors. Poison Cleansing Totem, Fire Nova, Magma Totem, Chain Lightning, Lightning Shield, Earth Shock, Earthbind, Resist Totems, Strength, WF, Chain Heal, Grounding Totem, Tremor Totem, etc. You all around guarantee group survivability as an Enhancement Shaman with a Spirit-gear/ Stam / Strength build.
---
What did he say?
---
That wasn‚Äôt part of the original design of warlock, it was just another alternative during leveling if you couldn‚Äôt find a good offhand
---
The items probably had agility because the item designers were told that all classes needed all stats, so the item designers figured that warlocks might get smacked every now and again and might enjoy a bit of armor and dodge.
---
Source: Kevin Jordan
---
So just respec to AoE, why go hybrid if you don't like single target?
---
I'm just rerolling my rogue to a warrior for the exact same reason it seems lol. I figure its just leveling fatigue. What is it about your warrior you specifically dont like?
---
The auctions in question are clearly not put up in the hundreds by mistake. It's done to appear on the 1st page of results and makes it tedious for people without addons. Even if you use addons parsing hundreds if not thousands of auctions can take quite a while.
---
For *actual* errors there could simply be a grace period (e. g. 20 minutes) where you are still able to cancel even if there are already bids.
---
Noice**
---
Nice damage meter.
---
Do these flight times get updated as you gain access to speed boosting items/equipment such as the Carrot on a Stick, Mithril Spurs, and the Riding Enchant on gloves?
---
Aux is in the twitch app for me.
---
DB. Mirah eats up your flurry procs.
---
It is what it is. Why don't you go pvp somewhere were you don't have to worry about being banned, like 60 seconds north of where you were pvping.
---
I'm not sure it's possible in Classic :( I think you can reach friendly with them by killing Ravenholdt members, but I don't believe you can go further. I could be wrong tho
---
Okay, thank you very much! Think I'll just hold on to trinket.
---
I‚Äôm level 45 &amp; wish I had 75 gold.
---
I do lock boxes and chests as need.  Then we roll need on the ITEM after I unlock it then greed if no one needed it.  But we do it for the item I get out of the whatever.  No one I have grouped with has ever had a problem with it.  Only blue I have gotten so far has been in gnomeregon it was a rifle.  Rest have been greens had a hunter need roll on a staff of the monkey out of a lockbox last night in maraudon.
---
Don't run dungeons as such.
---
Look for open-world areas full of elites. You'll get the dungeon experience, but without needing a party of five.
---
I feel like TBC is safer from a developer point of view, but classic+ will segment the population less. Yes TBC fans will be salty, but they will still get new content and get over it eventually.

And uldaman at 43, zf at 44?
---
Oh have you now?  Barely played WoW, really no where near endgame?  Nice.  We all play at our own pace, we all play what we want.  Some of us have more time than you, some have less.  Some want to farm Rag because that was the highest joy of their memory in Vanilla.  Some like leveling.
---
Everyone has their preferences, and instead of asking or begging or point out how "casual you are" or how hardcore you are, let's everyone just play the game and let each other do whatever they want.
---
I'm going to go and gank some lowbies in your honor after work. Go roll on a pve server and stop whining. OP didn't even camp anyone, dying once to a gank is a mild annoyance at worst.
---
Quest grinding is the fastest method, while killing everything on your way between quest locations. Once you get to 55+, try to only do quests that are your level, as if you complete the 57+ quests too early, you'll have nothing to get easy EXP from at that level.
---
Dungeon runs are generally worse exp/hr, especially with the amount of skipping and quest avoidance people have. Dungeons are only good exp when you manage to get most of their quests done within a run - which requires you to be prepared and have a patient group.
---
Level 57 is easily the worst level in the game, because all quests left are either green with poor rewards (seriously, I did a 25 minute, level 56 quest at level 57 and got 1400xp....), or they are orange and not exp/hr efficient. Not to mention, its VERY common now for the final dungeons to only be looking for level 60s.
---
 "More like you shouldn't be able to kill someone in Booty Bay, period."
---
SHUT UP CARE BEAR
---
They aren‚Äôt. You got banned
---
I also listened to that podcast; he mentioned quite specifically that warlocks were supposed to melee in fights with daggers and firestones.
---
The ban was probably because it was your second offense.  If you are water walking, do the guards not run out into the water to get you? If its anything like the priest spell any damage causes you to fall into the water.  Can the guards shoot at you? I feel like half these exploits would be remedied if the guards had guns. 
---
I basically agree with you. If I was levitating and MC-ing people while levitating on the water, that shouldn't be considered a terrain exploit.  It would be the same as just jumping into the water to get away from the guards right? Is that considered an exploit?
---
&gt;Yes.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;How can you be confused by the rule?  
---
&gt;If you can attack and kill someone that is in an area where guards are supposed to protect them and attack you, but they can't reach you, you're exploiting the terrain.  
---
&gt;Not sure how you can write an essay about the situation, yet still be confused about the nature and purpose of that rule.
---
So I'm supposed to let guards kill me when I attack other people? I can use the tools Blizzard gave my class to save myself? Any non-rogue PvPing in town just needs to die?
---
&gt; More like you shouldn't be able to kill someone in Booty Bay, period. Obviously, if you're complete trash, you can one-shot people 20 levels below you, but that's not something any normally constituted human being would find enjoyment in doing. 
---
This isn't a moral issue so I don't know why you're making it one. You aren't good or bad for PvPing anywhere in a PvP server. It's part of the game. Don't sign up for a PvP server if you don't like PvP.
---
There's a patch of lava-like floor behind him that gives a crit/attack haste buff if you stand on it
---
The difference could be that rouges use an ability within a combat zone where there‚Äôs still a chance of them going back into direct combat. Your ability takes you out of a reachable combat zone while still allowing you to fight others, whilst preventing them from attacking you using the environment. That‚Äôs just my interpretation of the situation.
---
Could you explain to me, somebody who has only played Classic, at what expansion did the game become ‚Äúretail‚Äù?
---
Charlie?
---
Yeah right, like anyone would seriously post 200 single pieces of mage weave cloth manually.
---
Addons are causing this *because* they make it simple to do.
---
Hmmmm it's almost as if their whole faction is a puppet of the Nathrezim, HMMMMMMM
---
Priest was actually never a tank class. The extra armor was because during questing, the priest may get melee‚Äôd. The threat on mindblast was so they could give the priest a powerful leveling spell without making unbalancing them in dungeons where they were healing.
---
Wands don‚Äôt scale with Ranged AP and never did, except on Pservers.
---
Because it‚Äôs just a herb. A chest can contain edgemasters and many other valuable items.
---
Is shadowcraft gear that good?
---
In particular: is the shadowcraft belt better than Vosh'gajin's?
---
That's grobbulus for you.
---
Or gnomish invisibility generator to drop combat and then shadowmeld.
---
You are literally linking evidence exploiting any incredibly well-known Gadgetzan bug that allow one to freely PVP without getting attacked by the guards, one that Blizzard themselves has warned people about.  Well played.
---
Cool picture. You got the OG name tho
---
What part of that made you think I am very good at the game? I'm not going to be raiding Naxx either. I'm not a hardcore raider myself, I just played in original vanilla and my mindset then and now with the way vanilla is that just because other people are doing higher end content does not mean I cannot have fun doing the content at my time commitment level.
---
r/onepiece
---
Here's the thing...
---
Vertical progression exists already, it's called leveling and it's fine. *Eventually*, if everyone cares enough they get to the same point (level 60).
---
As for the other stuff, there should be pvp equivalents for raid tiers. That would be a Classic+ consideration just like Arena seasons. Soloing Dire Maul is just the same problem that exists elsewhere. People can go in and solo Mara at 60 to make money or any other 40-50 dungeon. That will *always* happen unless you have scaling that makes better levels mostly irrelevant, like retail WoW does.
---
I wouldn't put it past him honestly
---
you're a dick
---
yes it is technically. blizzard is first party, you are the second party and your friend is the third party. so bassically you both get banned if caught.
---
&gt; But those people getting ganked because you're bored can't opt out
---
Sure they can. They opted in the second they signed up for a pvp server.
---
No such thing as a "reasonable" tip if you want x amount of gold charge for it.
---
Yeah but you will always be #1 because you have no special characters
---
Oh. It also had a bunch of other issues so I just replaced it, idk if any of that got fixed.
---
A particularly annoying one is not being able to dispel mind control (using the same binding for normal dispel magic).
---
&gt;You replied directly  to me, not the thread, so obviously I would respond
---
What? Lol
---
This whole chain is off my response to the orginal thread and you are the one who disagreed with me and made a comment. Dummy.
---
Quit for Hong Kong.
---
Just curious does The warrior prot talent one hand weapon specialization damage apply to both weapons if you dual wield?
---
Yeah, if anything it can help casuals if they run DM a bunch. It adds more gearing options, some of the gear is prebis, just like other dungeons, but doesnt make other dungeons completely obsolete either.
---
All in all this +13k post panic is completely unwarranted. It only shows that Blizzard should stop catering to casuals in retail at all, because casuals have shown time and time again they dont even know whats best for them or what they really want.
---
Use deathbringer, you'll be fine with a slow offhand. If you feel raged starved then just through is back on
---
what chest even is that? dont think ive seen it before
---
Aw, man, I loved this guy so much I ended up asking someone else on the quest if I could tame him when they summoned him. :) What an awesome art!
---
I agree. You can set your minimum bid at what should essentially be your "reserve" price, so why not?
---
I am ... but 1-2g for 30 minutes? Ehh....
---
I was so happy to finally get a 2H weapon, it makes it so much easier to switch from dps weapon to finkle's skinner.  When I was dual wielding I had to manually change it out each time or it would just keep swapping the other weapon slot.
---
It‚Äôs a myth according to the original class designer, Kevin Jordan who now streams on twitch.
---
There were a lot of reasons to add DM aside from just hardcore players wanting content. DM added a lot for a lot of classes.
---
It's the principal and I'll be farming tarnished elven rings soon =P
---
Watching people run in fear and melt away never gets old. 
---
But on a real note I‚Äôm a serial-alt starter lol so if ever I get bored I play an alt.
---
A rogue can't keep DPSing the target after they have Vanished, while terrain exploits allow one to continue attacking while also evading the guards.
---
Haha, I know it. Been practicing drawing orcs and that has to be the hardest part because they are RIDICULOUSLY hunched over xD 
---
They must be like dogs - they cant look up.
---
Wow tokens in retail are tradeable on the AH.  I can literally buy an item that grants 30 days of game time from Blizzard, go to an AH, list it for gold and people can then buy it and use it instead of paying Blizzard for game time.
---
This works out very well in Eve Online, as you can drop an extra 15-30 dollars to boost yourself in game.  Players who are hard core grinders can go free to play by turning their extra gold into game time.
---
With gold being such a precious commodity, it incentives gold farmers, as they have no competition.  If Blizzard puts tokens in a future phase, it would not be a terrible idea.
---
&gt; Opportunity cost of non-class mount: 190g
---
The mount costs 900g until we can get rank 3, then it becomes 800g
---
Well said.
---
you ended up in the r/backrooms
---
no Red or Yellow?
---
It's funny, I had a similar encounter with a Horde Hunter (I'm Ally Priest) on the same quest where he first helped me complete mine and I then helped him complete his, dying in the process. He waited for me to get back to my corpse and res to /thank me and /bow before leaving. That said, it doesn't make up for every time I got ganked by Horde cowards.
---
Yes. People wipe sometimes. That's part of the game lol. 
---
  Raids right now are about equivalent to normal difficulty with Domo/rag/Ony maybe compareable to some of the easier heroic bosses.  Not even close to mythic raids. 
---
  So relatively speaking, the raids are kind of a joke.
---
Its more in just travel time and i wasnt necessarily looking for any high level players either. Tbh i just wanted to buy some of the horde starting gear for my bank alt üòÖ  im just willing to pay like 1-2g for a set lol
---
&gt; can opener
---
I remember Cutman from Megaman jokes being quite popular.
---
Blizzard considers basic meta concepts such as ‚Äòavoiding pats‚Äô or ‚Äòbeing outside aggro range‚Äô exploitation
---
another option is to use a bar mod that enables right click self cast.  that way you can keep your target selected and still cast on yourself.
---
Off-topic: with a name like gnaark, do you exclusively bust drug dealers who are involved in extreme sports?
---
Picturing a snowboarding coke dealer - 'The finest powder while riding powder'
---
Very true, but if what they want is simply banning a top gamer, that seems extremely doable to keep a $2.1B stakeholder happy.
---
&gt; So I'm supposed to let guards kill me when I attack other people? I can use the tools Blizzard gave my class to save myself? Any non-rogue PvPing in town just needs to die?
---
...or kill the guards? It's not like they were invincible. You actually need to farm BB guards to get your Bloodsail Buccaneers reputation up. What is disallowed is avoiding retribution from the guards when engaging in attacks in a guard-protected area.
---
&gt; This isn't a moral issue so I don't know why you're making it one. You aren't good or bad for PvPing anywhere in a PvP server. It's part of the game. Don't sign up for a PvP server if you don't like PvP.
---
You're bad if you have to commit ban-able offenses to farm kills on a PvP server. Why don't you just go fight people somewhere else? Don't use exploits if you like PvP.
---
Step 1: Move to China/Venezuela/Any other country where WoW Gold is worth more than your own Currency.  
---
Step 2: 24 hour work days.  
---
Not a good idea.
---
Windfury enhancement shaman. It's a lucky build, but goddamn strong when it hits. Don't know if it's viable in classic though, but that shit was overpowered in retail.
---
Wait wait wait I thought they patched wallclimbing as the game run on a modern client ?
---
Glad to see we can still access Hyjal tho, I wonder what route you took.
---
ITT: people telling shamans what they can and cannot do
---
if you install details from the twitch client tinythreat is already included iirc.
---
https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/
---
I thought this too.
---
At least you speak that coward slang as all real Alliance players do.  So you have chosen wisely.  ;-)
---
It makes perfect sense that they release dire maul faster and phases a bit faster than vanilla because:  
---
1. We are in 1.12 itemization and talents which makes the game easier, thus less content at 60.   
---
2. People already know all the strategies so content is cleared faster. Even for casuals strategies and builds are easier to lookout ie google/youtube.   
---
3. I dont see this as rushing. Dire Maul isnt huge content patch its only a big 3-wing dungeon. It would be bad if they release new raids 1 month after each other, but they wont do that.
---
Finally, this only shows Blizzard should NEVER listen to casuals.
---
Everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked...
---
lol!
---
He at least paid each party member 2g. Half ninja.
---
As a resto Druid I‚Äôve never had a group say they prefer priests, nor had a group complain about Druid healing.

Yeah, that's what we thought too.

It also costs mana so you could find yourself in a bind from that as well.
---
Ah, so Vancouver then?
---
TIL. Huh. Thanks!
---
My experience has been groups in Scholomance skipping a lot of the trash and most of the bosses, i.e., only killing Rattlegore Viewing Room Key and then going straight to Darkmaster Gandling. Groups doing LBRS are there for the Onyxia quest so they will work through at least the 3 bosses for the quest and 3-4 bosses that are along the way.
---
I'm going to assume your response is meant to be sarcastic, and so will respond as such.
---
He's right... Blizzard has copies of all these logs. You don't need them. The other commenter who said it was easy to manipulate logs was also correct. I can save logs and put anyone's name anywhere, and add whatever I want to them. 
---
I'm a big fan of logging everything and too much info is not enough, but when these logs get large enough, they can (used to at least) start bogging down your system unnecessarily and with no real gain.
---
My point is cancelling your WoW subscription is a bare minimum act you can take to show you care more about human rights than entertainment. If you aren't willing to do something that small how are you ever going to stand up?
---
I dont think you can. You already have a command set for ooc and stealthed (pounce).
---
Possibly set a modifier - ie shift to that part to unstealth instead of pounce, allowing you to keep both ?
---
I've never heard this.  Take zone chat with a bag full of salt.
---
Broken tooth is the best cat in the game.  If you've got him, I'd just level with him to 60.
---
If it makes you feel better, the contrast of being on the dominant side... Is I feel like I am on a PVE server on Herod. I mean if I am killed in Wpvp there will be a dozen Horde coming by any second... So I don't have to worry about whatever alliance player just killed me. 
---
I feel more pity than rivalry towards the alliance and thus don't get that hard fought camaraderie feel I use to...
---
Maybe it's just grass is always greener on other side.
---
What other good alternative is there to thrash? I don't think I'll be getting my dal rend swords any time soon and I want to start raiding when I hit 60
---
No I only have the one account. I‚Äôve downloaded BFA as well but that‚Äôs it.
---
I understand what tokens are. 
---
I mean game play wise there is no difference between people selling gold in game against the TOS for real life money and people selling good for blizzard dollars.
---
I mean ony is on a shorter reset. It‚Äôs honestly pretty similar. Blaster shot is a maybe but strikers should be melee prio
---
When [Deep Earth Spaulders](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18829/deep-earth-spaulders) were first added the left shoulder was backwards. Both shoulder pads were facing the same direction.
---
I have a screenshot on my home PC of one of our Shamans with the backwards shoulder pad.
---
That's a really good question. I know when you drop a prof and lose all recipes, you can relearn any from drops/schematics, because you can learn any that you don't already know. Quest rewards would be a different thing, because the quest would have to be flagged as incomplete- and I don't know if dropping the prof also removes the quest flags.
---
You would think it would, especially as we had these prof quests up to Cata and I'm sure this came up- and you can change your "specialty" in Tanaris if you relearn/re-level BS. (which might be what unflags the quests) If it doesn't, it would/should be something a GM could fix- though you might have to go through a bit to get to someone that understands the issue and has permission to fix it. 
---
I'd say go for it if you are really unhappy- but there are some really cool (and majorly time consuming/expensive) BS quests as you progress- I loved all the Mithril Order stuff, myself. Depending on drops and the amount of time you can put in, you can make some decent gold at max level- but that isn't much help while leveling.
---
What about Stratholme instead? I know groups on Strath live are pretty desperate for tanks - could I charge my services, with the fee being we kill a lot of trash so I get some XP?
---
You would still have to pay AH cut if someone has put a bid on it though
---
No, for the spells (for ex.) there was 5/6 command to send a nova on a mage while with the Bfa engine there is only 2, so, they have had to re-code everything, it's definitely not a copy past^^, so they would have to re-code the whole BC xpac. It's a matter of engine here and the mechanics worked differently from one to another.
---
Was gonna say that! Was it added or just in the feed?
---
Exactly 1 item, and that's not going to stay relevant once DM is out.
---
Wand is sweaty, moms spaghetti
---
Isn't just claw + growl better for threat generation?
---
Looks like it‚Äôs just in the feed haha
---
Twink gears, value will prob go through the roofs in p2

The guards in booty bay work the same way you can just range or line of sight them where is the bug/exploit?
---
And a non mage.
---
Do you have an authenticator?  Is it up to date?
---
I had this issue recently and customer support was able to sort it out lickety split.
---
Maybe it's to do with different accents we speak but i've never had any trouble understanding the dwarfs
---
Be in a group or hate your life.  No cc makes shammy life hard.  Enhance gets kited to death but big numbers are fun.  You basically hit frostshock and pray you can get in melee range before your hp runs out. Ele is like a off healer with tools and boom potential.  I'd go ele personally, but if a rogue or warrior hops on you, you're usually dead without some crits.  
---
Engineering is a must, shamans only hard cc. Earthbind is annoying to the enemy though.  Totems are for group benefit but they are useful in 1v1 duels, know what to use and when.
---
You can get away with being level 59 for UBRS up to Rend Blackhand.
---
Tried it, the lack of postbox made it a worse grind for me. Being able to run to LHC and bank whenever made it much easier to just log on/off when I felt like it.
---
I'm assuming you mean 0/30/11. Just wanted to clarify. I'm using the same build and you made me do a double take.
---
What's this? An honorable ganker? By oxymoron incarnate that was a joy to read.
---
Voting wouldn't exactly cause this because the devs still have to decide what gets polled.
---
Either they add new content and don't poll it or they add content to polls and players get to veto it. I'd much rather have polls as a second check on the devs rather than just let them add whatever they want.
---
I play on a PvE server, so I don't expect twink gear to blow up until phase 3

I heard it‚Äôs cheap Chinese plastic, is it even worth the buy?

Still Sauron‚Äôs prisoner. Thought I‚Äôd forgotten something!
---
Hyjal
---
Yeah, people will have this as soon as enchants are available.
---
It's something I have missed for a long time, it's nice to see it coming back!
---
I love everything here. You are all my life
---
Was a bit sad to find it is made of plastic. Not sure why I expected otherwise.
---
WoW accommodates both Type A and Type B personalities, and all the variations in between. I'm just hoping this forum doesn't become all one type.
---
We can only hope, and dream, it's already changed a few things!
---
Having played this game since the beginning makes me sure that people will always choose the path of least resistance to the best gear available and skip the rest.
---
&gt;warriors, after begging to be in the shaman's group for their op dps buffs "wow shaman dps is trash lul link meters"
---
Right, fair i did oversee that fact.
---
It effectively does by increasing spell crit
---
So your argument is based on wpvp agaisnt bad players? 
---
No one is gonna deny that in a 1v1 scenario DP is more effective when the enemy cant cleanse it. But over all across all of your pvp Shadowguard will do more damage and provide more utility than DP. I dont care about one fight. If you win because of DP and they come back 30s later your screwed.
---
If all of pvp was 1v1 dueling one and done like arena or somthing than sure DP would be better. But it isnt and shadowguard is better overall
---
Also if you ever decide to heal in pvp shadowguard can still provide the defense of blackout procs. But you wont ever decide to use 25% of your mana or your inner focus cd for some  damage and weak healing. It's a meme shadow priest dueling spell. And as a shadow priest you already dont need the help 1v1

This much is true. Perhaps I am the nemesis!?
---
oh forget the point, you can only win once a category
---
I think it's fine. I personally benefit and make a ton of money from it but you have to consider that there is benefit to it. It allows there to be a listing of full stacks at the front of the AH. If was sorted by buyout you would have to slog through pages of singletons / small stacks. The 1c bid allows lazy people to get in and out and business minded people to make money. The people who don't like either of these outlooks can simply install an addon.

The cage in the center messes with the guard aggro, it's been well known for weeks now and Blizzard themselves have commented on it, warning folks not to do it.  It has been posted here daily since the first week of release.
---
i am low level but I haven't lost a fair fight yet. bring it
---
It was listed as a question and even has a question mark. 
---
I put a two different list sites are saying.
---
While you are 100% correct, a sword is so much easier to draw than an axe xD 
---
I am planning on drawing again with color and more detail and will certainly switch out the sword for an Arcanite Reaper /flex
---
Or if you have any other cool axe graphics you would like to recommend? ;)
---
your having a philisophical debate about the veracity of enforcment and whether blizzard will enforce the Crosstrading of gold across games violation is moot. First off this thread has been hijacked and has diverged from OP's question Second is that buying classic gold with retail or vice versa,  gold is most definately a bannable offense. Rulebreakers,cheaters, and exploiters will always argue against it and justify their actions, but it is most certainly a black and white rule.
---
Just woke up. Confused latency with resolution. Thought you were making a joke about the grey and hazy real world
---
You are a warrior
---
... is only a thing once you have enough tp to spend in both combat and sub, so not until 45-50.
---
Ok maybe I'm misunderstanding what you're asking then. What do you mean by "bring me back to normal cat form"? Do you mean how can you modify it so it takes you out of stealth?
---
So right now, in caster form, press button it puts you in catform and activates stealth, but when you press it again it does nothing?
---
The people who are playing casually like that are the people who brought about raid finder.  Regardless of how long we spend on each raid tier they wont ever be in the raids.   These are the equivalent of people who spend 10 years in college and complain that their friends are already elbow deep in careers.
---
at lvl 40 I started using this leveling guide: https://classicwow.live/leveling/
---
it took me about a level and a half to catch up on the missed quests from the guide but since then it has sped up my leveling a lot. it also made my xp/hour a lot more consistent.
---
how to speak on other language? its some addon or what? sometimes i just want to understand opposite faction player or tell thx to him
---
Big aimed shots are life.
---
This used to be my jam! Positronic Pimp too. Great album.
---
wow now i want this.
---
What you are doing is exploitation. It's not being clever and using your class right.  No class can stand in the open and freely blast away without guards bearing on them... not even the rogue that you say can vanish because that ends the confrontation.  You just stand there casting away without repercussion.  That is exploiting the mechanics of the guards, you were warned and still you want to exploit them.  You don't understand that you are exploiting and will continue to argue so of course the GM isn't going to listen because you just don't understand so he suspended you hoping you will learn somehow.  It's pretty simple.
---
I'm from the alliance lol
---
&gt; because the game didn't exist.
---
But it did. Right there, on the private servers. /shrug
---
&gt;Private severs repeatedly got shut down before they got into the stagnation phase.
---
"there were tons of pservers that reached Naxx."
---
&gt;You have literally nothing to suggest it wouldn't happen.
---
See above.
---
&gt;but it will start to decline in popularity
---
No game can remain hyper-popular forever. The entire point of Classic is to preserve 1.12, and Blizzard said they're going to host it no matter how unpopular it is. "Classic+" goes against the entire concept of Classic.
---
Farm bosses in mara?
---
Thinly veiled ‚ÄúI wanna piece of that action‚Äù post.
---
Say your a girl in any major city and you wana "talk" with people and make friends.
---
I didnt add the damage meter to flame him oe anyone, I was the healer and I added it to show you what classes were in the group. It's a good dagger and would have been an 8 dps increase for my rogue friend.
---
Just thought of it when I saw your name, gnar/gnaar always makes me think of snowboards, skateboards, etc. and then Narc(otics officer). These are the dangers of having a stupid brain like mine haha
---
Besides flying mount, the other major issue is Outland itself. It killed the original world and made it worthless. It moved everyone away from those areas as nothing there mattered when it came to things like mats for crafting.
---
They should not add flying nor Outland. Keep everyone on azeroth, it is already big enough and, as we see, has enough room for new content.
---
Couldn't a lock do mara runs at 55? Honestly you're looking at just under 17g an hour. I think if you busted out questing and did them efficiently.
---
Have a level 50 warlock but it's on a PVE server that a friend was playing on, he has not been playing though and I really would have preferred a PVP server like I did back in the day.
---
Am I crazy to reroll? 
---
I have already noticed just chilling in main cities that the PVP server seems to have more pug raids and 60s already and stuff going on in general than the PVE so I am a bit worried down the track the PVE server may be a bit dead or mainly populated just by guilds. I plan on doing a lot of pugging, my hours change and while i have free time it's tough to commit to a set schedule.
---
If i do re roll I'm torn between a rogue (my old main class in vanilla) or spicing it up with a different class, leaning towards a hunter. I basically know all the differences and have played both classes at some point in wow's life but I'm still torn and can't decide and want to avoid wasting more time in a character!

I got a 3 day ban back in TBC for botting when I leveled up my mining on my warlock. I was a tailor/enchanter but both professions were pitifully low, so I dumped them and picked up mining/engineering and just straight up leveled mining all the way in one sitting. Went to bed at like, 3 am, got up the next morning to the ban. No chance of appeal, no GM talking to me, nothing
---
I farmed humanoid mobs because they have the best chance of dropping cloth. Sold enough that at 39 I had enough for mount and level 40 skills

Bangalash is not an upgrade, the armor among all cats is normalized.

It was known in Classic. I got the hat myself and got to revered as I wanted to be servers highest rep. Whether people had done it then or not I have no idea, the increase in rep was known at least.
---
There used to be a list of everyone who hit exalted and when but I can't seem to find it.
---
Exactly, and I‚Äòd like to have a Function that brings me out of stealth but keeps me in catform.

well damn, my tip wont help then.

You need some of those leather short shorts with it, maybe a sexier helm too.
---
I roll and just give the stuff to the rogue.  I don't agree with people that say, "took a party to get you here."  His lockpicking, his lewt imo.
---
Cooking won't net you much outside of Savory Deviate Delights. One thing you could try is just continue doing quests and vendoring any quest reward that isn't an upgrade. Get an add-on such as VendorPrice and it will tell you what the most value item is.

My favorite part about your post is the title asking ‚Äúwhat constitutes as ‚Äòterrain exploration?‚Äô‚Äù and then immediately describing the exact situation where you got feedback/punishment for bad conduct. You answered your own question. WoW actually answered for you. Anyways, I‚Äôm going to be honest man, if you don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs going on in the situation your describing, life‚Äôs going to be hard on you. You have to understand the difference between good and bad conduct, whether in game or not. Then you either own your bad conduct or you don‚Äôt. If you don‚Äôt, these situations will continue to come up over and over again. I hope this is a gag of some sort.
---
Does it involve gnomes?
---
good to know, thx!
---
Wow, you're literally still trying to say I'm wrong after posting direct proof that it's directly against ToS, which has been the argument all along.
---
The rule says no account sharing, for any reason. Sharing it with guild members to make a guild bank is against ToS, it doesn't matter if they *will* enforce that rule, the point is that they can at any moment, and like it says in their ToS, they can ban that account and all related accounts. So roll the fucking dice if you want, idc, but it's against ToS just admit you were wrong and move on.
---
Is AoE that much better? Haha I just didn't want to lose damage, cuz everybody say single target is for dg

Letting the common redditor to vote would be a disaster.

Yeah, many ppl think I'm calling out the damage aswell but literally just there to show what classes were in the group

&gt;This isn't a moral issue so I don't know why you're making it one. You aren't good or bad for PvPing anywhere in a PvP server. It's part of the game. Don't sign up for a PvP server if you don't like PvP.  
---
GMs aren‚Äôt good or bad for banning anyone in an online game. It is part of the game. Don‚Äòt sign up for an online game if you don‚Äòt like being banned by a GM.
---
If you are just leveling, I would go mining/skinning until 60. Sell all the mats while retaining enough ore (convert to bars now since the stacks are bigger and you wont be able to do it without mining later on) to power level your engineering. You could try herb/mining while you level but you can only track one item on your map at a time. Youll be wasting your time running around looking for the one you cant track and it will slow leveling down.
---
At 60,  you can do engineer/mining or engineer/BS. Blacksmithing has some decent items for everyone.
---
what do you mean by this? eats up, does that mean a good thing or bad?

I am not an expert but I'm not sure the authenticator will work if your password isn't working.  I encourage you to contact customer support.

A lot of people don't realize the 100% threat divided amongst all hit. People complain I got hit twice in a row. Well when you care letting the fireball hit 20 other people you're threat is still #1

nope it involves, swimming, shellfish, desolace and being a dirty horde.
---
bUt I cAnT sEe At NiGhT!1
---
Can you do this at 55? I thought it was only do-able at 60 due to aggro of the mobs.
---
Isnt it fix that you get 1% crit for every 29agility, no matter how much your weaponskill is?
---
Please tell me if I'm wrong!
---
"I grind while they do :3"
---
That would be so weird!
---
I found VW useful up to 55, although not primarily. He was a good distraction for groups of 3 or 4 while I dotted them all up, then aggro would shift to me while my siphon life and maybe death coil would keep me tanking the 4. On the last mob alive, I could drain life for a big net gain. 
---
VW is very useful.
---
Thought you had to be 60 to not aggro the trash?
---
Take all my gear off, jump on the mailbox in front of the Org bank, and alternate the /cry and /dance emotes, while saying things like "Is this what you like?!" "I am not a piece of meat!!" "Does this make you feel good" "Don't look at me!"

Rag was nerfed at some point before patch 1.12 wasn't it? Plus patch 1.12 has all the class buffs and the increased debuff slots and most people playing now have basic grasps on their rotations and the strats or at least some experience with previous boss fights to tell whats going on and react.
---
I seriously have made so much gold in Old School Runescape with this tactic.
---
Don't stress about it. Keep leveling and ignore your gold total. You will hit 100g quickly as gold generation increases each level. I would be surprised if you didn't have it by 41-42.

---
This gets you Piercing Howl which can be an absolute life saver on overpulls. It also gets you everything important in prot for dungeons. People claiming 34 or more points are putting points into defense, which isn't needed for dungeons, or imp shield wall/revenge stun. It's stuff that really isn't very good. The remainder of the points go towards getting as much of tactical mastery as you can.
---
Another pretty good option is this
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/0232502130251-05-5023011053.
---
This option makes tanking 3 or 4 mobs a breeze and increases your damage output considerably. Not quite as tanky as the other option and worse single target threat but still really nice.
---
Is Hong Kong a banned topic or something? Every other Blizzard sub is blowing up about it but no mention of it here, it‚Äôs kinda weird.

If the weapon is a one-hand and not main it will go in offhand first.   So you have to either click the offhand weapon or your shield first.

you can range or line of sight the guards and kill players any where in booty bay you are ignorant and don't know what you're talking about, the guy is not even aggroing the guards anybody can sit in the water and shoot people he does not even need water walking

Delete my account immediately.
---
Yeah this is what I roll too, I know the fury split is popular but tactical mastery and shield slam is just too good for dungeons and raids
---
&gt;	gear scaling
---
Not an issue, no need to scale gear when they could use Dungeons for alternate sets instead.
---
The Dungeons could add one or two dungeon sets that was made for specs without a set, so feral set, enhancement det, elemental set, shadow set etc etc.
---
And the new raids would of course add raid sets for these specs.
---
Make them another parallel path of progression for classes that have specs without appropriate gear.
---
This solved both your gear scaling and power creep issue.
---
The issue now instead is that this parallel progression path comes very late, too late perhaps.
---
Well, it's absolutely different because you play. I don't think I'm alone in the group of people who got married at a lull point in MMO gaming. My wife has no idea the person I am when I'm seriously into a game because I haven't been invested in one seriously until classic.
---
So it's a new thing in the relationship. It means a lot of time that we used to spend together is now spent secluded in different rooms. I ask permission to play all night, albeit rarely, so that I am not ignoring the fact that this is new for us.
---
If she tells me that she had a rough day and wants to watch TV together then I will do that. But without asking first I am leaving her to "bother me and ask me to stop playing" which puts her in a shitty situation. So before telling my guildies I'll come on a dungeon run I'm going to ask her if I can be uninterrupted for an hour and a half.
---
This all is because she doesn't play video games and we cannot do it together. In my eyes, asking permission (or making her aware of my intention) is a very legitimate and important thing to do in this relationship.

First season was my favorite! I would have loved a longer version of the first battle.

He's saying that instead of making a link post that links your image then making a comment with whatever details you wanted to include, you could've instead made a Text (self) post that has your picture at the beginning then have your text afterwards so you wouldn't have to make a comment with the details of your post.
---
I was kind of confused by how you posted this, too. Thought you just wanted to post the artwork.
---
Previously it used to be "self" posts didn't get karma, so he's accusing you of karma whoring. For about a year or two now, self posts can get karma, though.

I started about 10 days after launch, and then, about half the time I've had a 10 month (now 11 month) old baby on my lap.  I have no idea what my /played is at, but that would be meaningless, given the number of times I get up and walk away due to kids, dogs, wife, etc.  I'm running Limeguide addon with Sage guides, so when I am playing, I'm not wasting time.
---
That's 16g per hour, you could literally go chain grind level 40 mobs for 6 hours and get more than 100g easily as a 55 lock in 6 hours. Pretty sure you can get more than 16g/hr just fishing at level 55.
---
I'm a newbie too and that all seems right. Most important to just pick a character and jump in. If it feels right go with it and if it doesn't you can change it up.
---
Keep downvoting me all you want, you linked a video that is a textbook demonstration of a known bug and then wonder why you got banned.  Maybe if you were actually good at PVP you wouldnt have to use exploits to win.
---
On-use trinkets get priority when swapping.  It doesnt let you equip 2 on use trinkets at once unless you have an empty slot or you do it manually.
---
AoE is quite fast, objectively, in an AoE farm grouo. That's its whole purpose. Nonetheless, your playstyle is good in the long run (especially on raid bosses and such). You might want to learn aoe just for clearing trashmobs tho.
---
Nice tank sword
---
I suggest emptying your bag as much as possible, go to badlands, find the earth elementals in the mountains that are closes to your level, and do nothing but kill them and loot until your bags are full. Go sell, rinse/repeat. I was in your position at around 70g at lvl 37, I used the method I described and was making up to 10g/hour. 
---
Just throw on a podcast or something, zone out, and kill stuff. The greys sell well, some of the heavy stones or w/e can either be vendored or thrown in the AH for more profit, and theres always the off chance of getting greens or better.
---
They patched some wall climbing, but this is more wall jumping.
---
It's definitely a bit harder to accomplish but the OG trick still works.
---
My friends have had some trouble with this going the other way, and this is about the best I can sum up the advice they got from GMs in their case:
---
Places like Booty Bay are *supposed* to be guarded. They're just not designed well. If you're using the terrain to escape being attacked by guards, whether it be standing in an area where they *don't* patrol (within the city limits) or standing in an area where they *can't* reach, both are exploiting the terrain. Water walking is just as much "using the terrain" as standing on top of the Gadgetzan arena. You're not meant to be able to attack the enemy faction without incurring the wrath of the guards, and regardless of whatever clever means you come up with to escape justice, **they're all exploiting** as they avoid the intended mechanic that is: guards.
---
this is not vague at all, blizzard has even stated that they are very different games, The only thing the games share is the sub fee, different clients, different loadscreens, etc,  so to say wow retail and wow classic are the same platform is like saying new coke and coke classic were the same drink because they were made by coca cola company and had coke in its name
---
Yup.  When I pass people I yell Zoooommmmmm
---
Did you think of Landvetter aswell?
---
how is being able to attack while untargetable and vanish even closely related. you can't keep attacking unimpeded after vanishing

I think it got unpinned by the automod pinning the daily threads so it might not be intentional but there was already a big post here for discussion about it

I'm not buying it. I logged on retail to prep for 8.3 and saw multiple people tell complete strangers to kill themselves in lfr and random bgs.

On the other hand I've been raiding molten core for weeks now and not a single person has asked me about my talents, or complained about wiping.  And we wipe to at least one lowbie carry facepulling trash each raid.

That was one way, but it was patched years ago.

So like the title says, I've encountered a rather annoying bug that makes all my spells cost an insane amount of mana +MP/1s. Buffs require 500 mana per sec to upkeep.

Loot council for truly progress oriented guilds. Most guilds aren‚Äôt truly progress oriented so loot council is a bad idea for them. I mean progress oriented as in all members thinking: ‚Äúwhatever we think will give us a better chance at success on the next boss.‚Äù Most people are too selfish for that‚Äîthey are there for loot. 
---
If you‚Äôre like the other 95% of players who aren‚Äôt truly progress oriented, keep it simple and do random rolls. Yes it will happen that a first timer will get something that didn‚Äôt drip the past 10 times; but, it will also happen that the people who raid most will still get the most stuff. No system is perfect; all have serious flaws. So go with the simplest option.
---
My favorite thing about Classic Wow by far is the itemization. Having actual unique items, with unique names and stats. Not randomly generated bullshit.

You're living in your own world then. Everyone knows rouges are incredibly easy to pvp with. A popular steamer named Sodapoppin has been playing on private servers for years, longer than you and I put together, and says a literal monkey could play a rogue if you taught them to push the keys in order. Dont try to act like pvp rouges are skill-based please. We all know they aren't. Like warlocks, some classes are just easy to pvp with.

Sooo again in game world no difference just different people buying and selling... pay to win on a video game is scummy I would rather the people who participate have  the risk of being booted rather then blizzard making a buck off them and thinking how can we encourage this more. 
---
As for people wanting to continue hobbies, the buyers do not need to buy wow gold to play. The sellers do not need to sell wow gold to play, any method of getting money included begging on the street has a higher return on time then farming wow gold...

Pay to win is not classic, and while you can say gold is not pay to win with boe‚Äôs and enchants it is.

ZG was 1.5 raid that gave some supplementary gear to guilds already doing MC. It served the same role as AQ20. Both were difficult raids to do unless you were carried. That said, it's pretty much impossible to get a fully geared guild just off of ZG. Comparing it to the welfare epics that plagued WotLK is laughable.

I found annoying keybinds. I rather like this

If you are playing lazy with the healthy amount of spare time from a family father /mother with 2 kids and a job it will take like 5 years to see everything.  No need to rush besides this you are right. there are nice other MMO out there to celebrate once you are done with classic (e. G.  Final Fantasy Eso guild wars 2 and many more.
---
TBC and everything after that was a big accumulation of mistakes that ended in the current state of retail WOW.  As far as I observed it because Blizzard cared to much for the ideas of the community that basically equalized all classes and made any building decisions reversible with no costs on the fly and speeding up the Lvl experience to something easily forgettable.
---
If it's all just a walk in the park... better walk in the park. Graphics IMHO are great in Wow retail (despite some questionable item design decisions) and could have been taken to classic content without any loss.  It was never the "great look" that made wow a good game. It was many well made design decisions in terms of gameplay  and limitations.

There is no such thing as an honorable kill on pvp servers.  This is coming from someone who, for now, hasn't started and skirmish with alliance on my pvp server.  If they go on me I'll fight to the death, but I'm perfectly happy leaving them alone.

I do not disagree with this, it's very annoying. If the addon function for mass-listing these items was broken, these people wouldn't spend 2 hours doing it manually.

---
I‚Äôm a dirty horde. What‚Äôs the tip?
---
There were resistance fights in TBC and WotLK.
---
This needs some "/y WITNESS ME!"
---
Now I just need to figure out which Warlock trainer teaches this....
---
OP, this is the correct answer. The 20 points are GREAT for soloing and holding aggro and making it last, plus speed, rez speed and mobility are all great utility for grinding, which is what you'll do most off-raid nights.
---
We had a clownfest in this thread where some hunter said the 20 points are great for **raiding** because pets are alive close to 100% of the time in raids.
---
When you ask him where or when he's seen this, he says it's theoretically possible with perfect play.
---
He suddenly mentions perfect play because I asked him for HIS logs to prove so, and he produced them, and as it turns out the pet was basically a howl bot and wasn't attacking bosses anywhere close to even 50% of the time.
---
It then becomes on me to show him logs where he can 'prove' every pet who doesn't have a 100% uptime has a retarded owner, himself included, he said, instead of him showing me one instance of the 100% uptime legend.
---
Stay away from advice like that!
---
Druids can tank MC.  There is no more argument to be had with the information that you require.  Because you may not realize it yet, but bwl/aq/zg/nax arent released yet.  Which would mean all of our information is from private servers or vanilla.   If you dont want private server information, then go back to the original vanilla forums and the answer is no over and over again.   
---
There are no ‚Äúfacts‚Äù for you here under your requirements.  Saying no to private server data is a bad idea when they are your only ally in this argument.
---
I rolled my first druid for classic, it can be frustrating at times collecting 3 sets of gear,  but being able to go, fk it I'm healing this run, then going fk it I'mma bear next run, then going fk it I'm a kitty cat and backup healer, has helped me find groups with zero issues. And keep gear runs from getting stale.
---
My other favorite class was PvP with my stance dance warrior back in the day, might be my next class I 60 in classic.
---
None of those apply to flight paths.
---
I thought the dumbed down talent system was from before.  The questing was fun, and I never did the dailies or raids (and just a few dungeons).
---
Best one I saw was a modified Loot Council/DKP hybrid.
---
Basically you have a loot council for gearing Tanks/Main Healers and for Specialty items (mats, quest items, certain trinkets) and DKP for the DPS, but the DKP is capped to prevent hoarding. Basically you use it or lose it. 
---
The loot council is made up of the leaders, as well as the tanks and healers. They decide which tanks get what and which valuble items go where for the best progression of the group. Any gear for tanks and healers the first few runs goes to the tanks and healers, and the Tanks and healers still get DKP for stuff like off spec, but they don't get to roll unless people don't need anything.
---
The DPS DKP works by geting points for showing up (like 15 pts), for clearing trash (1-2 point per mob or "pull" depending on dungeon, and for dowing/attempting bosses (usually 15-20). 
---
Loot is then decided by bid or roll by those bidding.
---
I just felt there wasn‚Äôt many quests chaining together but the other thing was it was extremely busy. This would be server specific though. I would imagine you will get a level in atleast each of those zones so you should cool!
---
I‚Äôm the party leader.
---
The initial video you posted is a known bug, and yes, the Booty Bays guards being exploitable is *also* well known, as OP's ban clearly demonstrates.  Enjoy your ban, get good next time.
---
I love my goblins, but I have legit always wanted to start a dwarf group to play through content on an RP realm or something.  Coincidentally, I have for years been trying to get people I play with in D&amp;D to play a one race or one class game for the hell of it.

You‚Äôre talking about keeping the revenue stream to a company that values money over human rights. I was enjoying classic too but the people who actually designed this game are no longer with Blizzard, it‚Äôs time to cancel. Some things are more important than being able to play a game we enjoy.

It's store-brand Quel'Serrar!

I dont get this. In No way did i mean to brag. In fact i do fairly bad in PvP.

Different communites. By the time they added LFG and LFR they had already started ruining the game and what made classic great wasnt there anymore

Killing mobs stops giving reputation at Revered, so the only way to get Exalted is to turn in feathers or beads.
---
No matter how quickly you get to Revered, there's a set number of beads you have to turn in from Revered to Exalted, so turning them in early means you end up killing more furblogs. If you only want Revered, turn-in beads all the way to Revered, if you want Exalted, wait to turn them in until they're the *only* way to get rep.

They in fact do, personally tested myself. Was flying side by side with a guy, by the end of the flight he was barely on my screen anymore. He even noticed the difference between our two griffons. We both had the carrot on a stick, but I had the mithril spurs as well, and it was noticeable.
---
*Bnut what bothers...* Uh what?
---
&gt; I would consider those 15 years of 'experience' to actually be a disadvantage.
---
is not the same as saying 
---
&gt; not a single thing Blizz has done [for the past 15 years] was good.
---
so did zg, and aq, let's just add them too to make the game easier
---
I get what you're saying, but you're completely ignoring the other side of the situation. DM has some items better than MC drops, most people aren't even 60, so they're now getting better than raid gear without raiding the first raid. you just shortened the lifespan of the first raid, you skipped the progression. again, why not just let us run zg now and get that gear that's better than 40 man raids too
---
Hand of Justice has a 3.85% drop chance according to wowhead, so the odds of not seeing it drop after 30 runs is (1-.0385)^30 = 0.30794, or about a 31% chance. So you're not exceptionally unlucky, it's just a low drop rate.
---
It's not.  You don't really do crafting to get rich unless you want to make bags.
---
I only buy expensive shirts from Italy and shoes from France. With the money I save on a year of WoW, I can buy a pair of Hermes sneakers.  By not supporting blizzard/activision, you can dress yourself in the finest garments.
---
There's an add on, but I think it's against the TOS.
---
/emote isn't though.

Not worrying about it is probably what got him to level 37 with 20g.

Get a wand! It‚Äôs basically the process. You use some spells &gt; wand to death &gt; repeat
---
Well I was going to say the dal rend.  Not sure otherwise, unfortunately.
---
Best answer is right here for sure.
---
You literally sit there beating a dead ~~horse~~ zhevra until your bloodlust subsides, look down, and realize it's so mangled you don't know where the hooves *used* to be. But they're not there now.
---
I think that means they have the same or better quality buff that you're trying to apply. I can definitely confirm that you can see the buff cast on them and see their HP drop to reflect they have received Fort if don't have an equal or more powerful one applied.
---
&gt; 'you know what, close to 100% uptime is possible in every case that people don't fuck up
---
So, literally what I've been saying this entire time?
---
&gt; Good players exist, but so far the logs show everyone is bad!'
---
Finally, you're getting it.
---
&gt;  why did you suggest a 20/31 build where 10 points are in use 33% of the time?
---
Because the alternative is a spec where 15 of your points are useless 100% of the time?
---
I made a post about this the other day and got downvoted to hell. Wtf is wrong with reddit sometimes...
---
I heard it from people in my guild. Im not stating it as factual.
---
with the utmost respect to you, i hope you're like 10 because this looks like shit
---
Anyone have the warlock equivalent or can direct me to it?
---
I‚Äôm usually on my phone during logins. So I can just wait for the select music, hit space or enter and then carry on without looking at the screen still. 
---
Sure it‚Äôs not an issue, it‚Äôs just a minor quality of life.
---
&gt; Any kind of guard evasion means you should get banned.
---
Tangential question: never played much retail, is it possible to tame crocoliscs in later expansions?
---
Fuck you,
---
Yours sincerely.
---
The last option looks really solid. An extra 10% crit, the only negative is no shield slam, which I don‚Äôt use anyway and haven‚Äôt had a problem holding threat as it is.
---
You took Orangebeard's spot.
---
if you aren't a shaman, druid, lock or undead, buy some underwater breathing potions (there are air vents at the spot but you will have to be mindful of them). 
---
Head to desolace. Jump off the dock and start swimming. you will find cages/traps that you can interact with, open them and loot the shellfish. There is a group of 5 cages that you can do in rotation will little downtime waiting for cage respawns. On the dock near the flightpath there is a npc you can turn in 5 shellfish for 55s. 
---
With shellfish and the greys I looted, I made like 6g in 25minutes. In the late thirties/early forties its decent cash for most classes.
---
I've read in several places that for PVE, Disc/Holy is just as good as deep Shadow for solo questing. Shadow shines in PVP heavy situations due to the fact that all the best PVP talents are Shadow.
---
The part that I like, for the same reason I love the Feral tree for Druids, is that the Holy Tree buffs both healing AND damage instead of just being dedicated to damage like the Shadow tree.
---
I'm thinking of rolling a priest as well and going Disc/Holy. Although obviously, 5 points in Shadow for Spirit Tap is \*essential\*.

This is wrong in so many ways jokes aside. A good tank diet should be raw meat hunted over the day, they should brush their teeth with enemy‚Äôs tendors and drink their blood. That‚Äôs a good tank. Otherwise you are looking for a paladin.
---
I personally don't think religious organizations should even be involved with something like adoptions. The only thing an adoptive organization should have in mind is the wellbeing of the children, not the religious doctrine they'll be raised under. But that's a separate argument. (Besides, any child will be safer in the custody of loving gay parents than it would in the custody of the Catholic church)
---
And while I'm also fine with a church not hosting a gay wedding, I do think homosexuals should have the right to legally marry. 
---
You're also demanding the religious values of these organizations be respected, without expecting them to respect people who happen to be attracted to the "wrong" sex. Your concern for authoritarianism only cuts one way, which makes *your* argument deeply disingenuous.

It's an old internet copypasta.  It feels like you're playing by a set of rules that no one else plays by, and then you get angry when people don't play by your rules.  You can say you're playing honorably, and that's fine.  Own that.  But it's not the way the world (of warcraft) is.
---
Haha ok m8.  Try not to cry too much when allies push your shit in even though you picked the ‚Äúop faction‚Äù

It gets A LOT easier to make gold past 40. I remember having 50g when I dinged 40 and worrying about not being able to afford my mount til 50, but by 43 I had 95g and bought my mount with 5g to spare.
---
As of right now, I've been 60 for about 4 days and have 400g (and another 100+g in items/mats) from just running dungeons.
---
I played a shit ton of vermintide and UBRS is Ubersreik to me
---
I did 3 man Rogue runs to get it. Try that for yourself?
---
Yep, stuff like space goats and blood elves were baked into the game way before vanilla.
---
Wait so you MC them, then cast Fort? And the cast goes thru even though you are controlling their character? Seems like a bug but thats cool to know.
---
If you don't already have warden staff hold off for a week. The mace in dire maul will be available soon, and it's better in some ways.
---
He will get this mount anyway, sooner or later.  
---
And at 45+ gold from quests would be enough to get a mount.

If they are 10, then perhaps you should be a bit more constructive with your criticism.
---
They drew something about a game they enjoy and wanted to share it with others.
---
That's something positive, it doesn't need this type of vitriol.
---
This is exactly why I rate guild wars 2 and classic (if nothing changes)  higher than retail. I don't like to pause for 6 month and find all the things I  own devaluated to zero. That's killing my time without any real achievement at all as its just gone once a new soft reset was made.
---
Getting crits is already reliable. My warrior has 6% hit and 27% crit, without buffs, in dungeon gear. If I chug an elixir of the mongoose, get a mark of the wild, and you throw a feral druid or Grace of Air totem in my party, that's ~34% crit right there.
---
1 in 3 attacks seems pretty reliable to me.
---
Im literaly in BRD with a warrior who just said he wishes he had consec because of how much threat it generates so I think it's a little more complicated than you make it seem.
---
Horde equivalent, autocorrect got me.
---
Leveled shadow, could heal in full shadow spec up to lvl 50 with no issue. Solo leveling as Shadow is a breeze thanks to Spirit Tap which is a mini mana potion over time after you get a killing blow on a mob. I have no Pally experience but know enough to know they are less dynamic and more boring end game. You will not run out of mana and will have more PvP value, but I would recommend Priest for PvE. Then again, there will be a lot more priests than pallys. Maybe watch a couple youtube videos on each and compare the playstyles.
---
Because to maximize their effectiveness you do them every day. By comparison right now in Classic, you log on once a week for your MC clear. Done. Logging on every day, which a casual would have to do to keep up with a hardcore is the anti-definition of casual imo, so in the end while it does provide an opportunity for the casual to at least get the stuff, it doesnt close any gaps. We all are gated right now by a raid lockout, casual or hardcore.
---
Oh because they're low level and horde are generally pretty passive so even if you do curse them they wont engage 
---
A high level has ways of dealing with it anyways so it's less fun.
---
Wash yer sack or ye‚Äôll smell whack
---
&gt; It‚Äôs not the gold that‚Äôs the issue. It‚Äôs the point that he was in a raid group and expected to be paid for a service that would speed the dungeon up.
---
That's not what you said in the post I replied to tho. You said you were questing in EPL and you were joined by a mage. To me this reads as: 
---
"I met a mage out in the wild, we grouped for a quest, then I asked him for 120 water" 
---
In which case, a tip wouldn't be so unfair to ask for. It's completely different to try and sell your water in a dungeon or raid, and I wouldn't want to keep a person who does that in my group.
---
Yeah while they are mind controlled you still have access to your skills. So casting fort works and applies to them as they are currently a friendly target, but it cancels the mind control.
---
What does Pot of Greed do?!
---
Just no, fury warriors are well documented as the best DPS alliance side or horde side. With or without windfury.
---
Humans have perception, detecting stealth more easy. Also make sure you have your stealth fully upgraded.

Melee AoE huh.... My worst experience as a healer in BRD. 3 warriors in party - 60,60 and 55 lvl. all of them had like 3500 hp (solid, as for me). THIS WAS PAINFULL AS HELL TO KEEP THEM ALIVE. I was wasting most of the mana on EVERY pack.   
---
Ok, i told them maybe its me bad as healer, so its better for them to find good healer. Ok. We finished it.  
---
Today. I went into random group, with Paladin in NOT tank spec, lvl 54, with 2400 hp (lower than me, lol), with lvl 50 mage aaand... i was semi afking cause this was so smooth and easy. So...my verdict - fuck melee warriors parties :( They can only nonstop charge and cant handle dmg -.-
---
Agree to disagree I guess. We would regularly roll at least 2 sometimes 3 warriors in WSG and at least 3 in AB when doing pre-formed farming groups.
---

I am quite a bit older :/

It is drawn on a small legal notepad not a full sized piece of paper and i spent only a little over an hour on it, if that makes any difference to you.

1/6 of the leveling =/= 1/6 of the GAMES content. simmer down.

---
For as long as their name has some Frankenstein deformity, they will always be 2nd place.
---
I mean, I know several locks and pallies, mainly due to the fact that if a mage CS's you while you are trying to mount you are FUCKED beyond belief... So yeah, many opt out of the class mount.  
---
Also this is a big difference from say removing mortal strike from a warrior versus removing class epic mounts from warlock. The mount isn't some quintessential piece of their class...  
---
Its coming out too quickly and invalidating old content before it has had a chance to get fully fleshed out. As well it causes gold inflation, so double bad things.  
---
Lol, onyxia is a shorter raid than ANY 60 dungeon... As well MC can be done in pieces to cater to casuals. We do all of MC and Ony in 3 hours... Its not that huge commitment and we are not by any means hardcore. We have feral druids, spriest, ret paladins etc.  
---
Furthermore if you think that some 60s are going to quit but if you add DM they will stay for another week? two weeks? and then be done with DM and quit, you are not thinking about longevity of the server. Most players are not 60 even still to this day, so catering to the smaller percentages of players that are already done with the content is just silly. You are catering to a minority and claiming that somehow it'll be better for the game, which it wont. Make the game for the MOST players to enjoy and don't rush the experience. This pserver syndrome of "I finished the content give me more or I quit and go to a new server" Is terrible for classic and doesn't belong here imo. It is only detrimental to the community.
---
I've been playing around with specs since reaching 60, currently running SM/DS because I like the farming utility of saccing void for HP/4. Been farming princess runs, legashi in azshara, and scarlets in WP. You can get a timing/rhythm down where you pull 3 or 4 mobs at a time 2-3 times and then run to another camp while regenerating the hps. I also ran DS/Ruin and enjoyed the big crits. I find SM/DS better for farming mobs in the low to mid 50s, and DS/Ruin better for single stronger mobs ~60.
---
saw a video of solo princess farms with SM/Ruin, but not sure I have the gear yet to make it work as well as current spec.
---
Hey all. Question about rare BoP recipes and offering services. I've always been the type to do things for free and trust in tips / goodwill to fit the bill. If people are giving me their materials why would I charge them? But once I started offering "free with your mats" I immediately got whispers "explaining" to me how by "undercutting" others I was ruining the economy.
---
I try to explain how my own view of things is doing it for free with other's mats and how I just always wanted to be at this level as a kid, but replies after that point become lowkey "not threats." 
---
I'd usually ignore these people and continue advertising my wares, but I'm genuinely worried as I recall stories of people being slandered / framed / witch-hunted for situations like this. A random alt accuses you of taking mats and logging out, they spread the word and try to take you down on your server and this absolutely terrifies me. I just wanted to do big boy enchants like I saw people doing as a kid. What mafia-gang level shit have I gotten into? Should I be worried? Do I just give in and charge people while feeling like a scumbag (due entirely to my own personal beliefs, I understand the idea of "reaping your rewards" people keep telling me in whispers) if the threat of being blacklisted is actually real?
---
Well, they had to balance Druids somehow. Can't just let them give people in their raid +10 to stats for nothing.  
---
All seriousness though, this is hilarious. How does this happen...?! Not only has it somehow replaced the mana cost, it's replaced it with a _variable_ mana cost, and a mana drain! What spell in the game even has a mana cost like this?
---
oh I know. just getting in the pvp spirit of things :D
---
As a paladin double pulling or triple pulling every caster pack in scholo, pulling the entire scholo whelp room at once, and double pulling everything in strat + getting pats all while being #2 or #3 on DPS.. I can assure you that you are completely wrong.
---
Oh, and without consumables.
---
Paladin is the best healer in phase 6. Hands down.

I was a warlord elemental shaman back in vanilla, my biggest tip for high and end pvp is, keep your teammates alive, everyone will leave you for last, stomp them totems to keep your clothies healthy, by all means take shots when you can but keeping your teammates healthy is still #1. Damage dumping is great when you're up in numbers but I've won 4v2s more times than I care to count by kiting and keeping my mage/warlock/priest alive long enough to grind an enemy team down one by one.
---
WTF, I already ran UD Strath THREE TIMES and haven't seen the mount ONCE!
---
I think Blizz owes me this mount for running this place four times now.
---
I would rather have literally anything else.
---
Hyjal, a zone you aren't supposed to be able to access.
---
Well since I start with 0 gold I start with running to mara. Then just delete my account because I was never going to make it and just wasted time running here.
---
So I am currently level 54 and leveling in Winterspring. I was passing through the area and just decided to check the demons. I got there and saw a mage drinking. He asked if I'm there for the Eye and I said yes, we joked and said lets kill a few and maybe it drops. I said I'll pay all I can afford to him if it drops. We killed only one demon and The Eye of Shadow dropped. I was so happy and shocked!  I hope he's okay with me sharing it here. 
---
I thanked him a gazillion times but I'll do one more here: Eclips, you rock dude! I paid him 100g since that was all I can realistically afford but I'd easily pay double or triple if I had the money.
---
I was so worried I'd have to stay Shadow and move back and forth between Holy to farm the Eye, or buy it from Ah for some exorbitant price, or I'd have to get a few friends to farm the demons for hours. I'm not even max level and somehow I got it. It doesn't even feel real to be honest.
---
P.S: By the way, after I posted this I was asked to pick a flair. Not sure if Humor fits this one, but the others didn't seem relevant at all. Am I missing something here? I'm not sure.
---
I think warlock leveling is very engaging. Even when you're purely grinding there is a lot of stuff you can vary about your rotation and your general playstyle. You can go into "sustain mode" and zone out with practically zero downtime. Or you can really turn it up in bursts when you're fighting for quest mobs for example and kill three mobs at the same time easily while looking cool af. Soloing various elite quests is also a lot of fun, it's almost like a puzzle game sometimes.
---
If you have a sword you obviously dump those points into sword spec instead.
---
It's nice being able to pop sweeping strikes, swap to defensive stance and have everything glued to you by tab cleaving.
---
Very satisfying build for level 60 non-raid content.
---
For sure, it resembles part of the modern Hyjal (or at least the one we see in TBC), but it has giant areas that are different.
---
Your downtime will increase without dark pact. Ruin is a key raid DPS talent. If you start throwing corruption or CoA on bosses in raids your raid leader will be mad. Imp life tap is fine mana regen for raids. As all healers are desperately padding metres in these easy raids, you life tap and get 5 heals on you 2 seconds later. You can still build drain tank, just need to sacrifice dark pact. Ruin is pretty important, and your DPS will be low without it.
---
Back in the day I used to taunt the mobs that bots were farming and lead them back to my town so the guards would kill them.  Good times!
---
Simmer down....hahaha
---
40 isn't much esp compared to the overall amount you need to get, but for 'optimal' grind to get to exalted you want to hold all Feathers/Beads/quests (except the initial kill quest(s) to enable the drops) until after you've reached max Honored from just strait killing mobs.
---
It's 2030 or 2100 drops depending on how you do it as a non-human.
---
I'd love for them to just stick to Azeroth and finishing off the two main continents. I'd also like it if they avoided adding all these island expansions.
---
Northrend is the one place I wouldn't mind them adding back in since it's so iconic and was featured in the Warcraft games. But having us teleporting between worlds is what gave us new city hubs and led to the world being emptied out.
---
I am in the boat of, if we are just going to repeat classic through BC and beyond I am pretty much done at 60
---
   
---
I don't want a full replay, I want a what if, start out how it was then don't blow it
---
oh there are mobs down there and mobs that can spawn from the traps, they are lvl 34 to 36 I believe.
---
I'll try to think of more, but off the top of my head I whole heartedly suggest SPORE‚Ñ¢
---
If you are doing premades, you are a serious PvPer that is playing for efficiency over fun. If they want to roll Ele for it or only invite Ele, that is great. Most people that roll Enh are doing it for fun and don't really give a shit. If I wanted to play a caster, I enjoy Mages the most and would just play that. I like playing a melee that has utility of a healer and caster to weave in when needed, so I'm playing Enh. It's the only reason I made a Shaman. If I wasn't going to play Enh spec, I'd just not play the class at all.
---
Your judgmental attitude is super weird and makes you come off like a bit of an ass whether you meant to or not. I was with you on the first part, feel free to talk up the ele spec all you want, but the last line really makes you look like a dick.
---
I mean if you are prot, its seems to me to be a more efficient way to get gold than grinding mobs.
---
I personally don't an issue with it and it is hard for me to see how other people can justify having an issue with it. Don't like that a tank is selling their services? don't buy the services and put the tank on /ignore.
---
You don't have a casual guild. Stop looking around in your little bubble.
---
As long as there are more people in darkshire than in 3 high level zones combined, my point stands.
---
Yes it is that imbalanced. I've been keeping a log of it. I have two accounts for the realm. That link /u/T_Brick_OG posted is so off. It's 25 days old from before the last transfers from 10 realms to Heartseeker were going. We were low pop before then, now we're high pop or medium. There's WAY more alliance than horde. Anytime I get online I can /who any zone and theres going to be quadruple the alliance to horde in any contested zone. It doesn't matter what time, I promise you that. Felwood for example earlier today was 12 horde and 98 alliance. 
---
It takes awhile to just /who everything myself specifically, but it's all I can do since census broke. Also awhile back another guy on our HS discord counted every level 60, and it was literally 75% of the 60s were alliance and 25% horde.
---
Don't go by that outdated inaccurate upload. Not only was it dated instantly, but it relied upon people uploading their own data via the census addon. If only two people uploaded their data for example you'd get a skewed report. This is why I do my own searches every few hours every day at random times.
---
I wouldn't sit around in trade and advertise that I'm selling runs. But if you see a group looking for a tank for a dungeon that you don't really need and they were looking for a bit you could offer to do it for x gold, or offer to do it for all BoE green drops, or whatever.
---
I‚Äôve been having trouble selling BoE greens and even blues. I use auctioneer, set and undercut market price, list for 24 hours. i‚Äôve tried putting starting bid lower, listing on weekends, selling via trade channel, even selling for just above vendor and nada. any other tips for getting sales?
---
I think your wearing that backwards.
---
if you wanna be accurate original wow launched on november and maraudon came out in dic, almost a whole month after, and Dire maul came out until march so that was 4 months from launch for its release.

---
This was a thing on pservers because there were less players and more closed-knit groups that did not rely on LFG, so guileless or solo players relied heavily on these services to compensate for not being part of a tight group.. If a tank offered this now I probably wouldn't even think twice about finding someone else, tanks are hard to come by but aren't worth 70g in loot.

Unless there is literally nothing you need or want from the dungeon you're running, I think it is shitty to charge for it.
---
If you need to run a particular dungeon for a drop and you decide to charge *other* people for it on top of searching for the item you need, you're double-dipping.
---
shit you right
---
I‚Äôd be gaybeard
---
I manually downloaded it and like that other guy said it now shows up in twitch. Thanks for the addon!
---
Yeah the gear has a lot to do with it imo. It was not this easy back then.
---
no its ali only
---
horde does not have a rep grind mount like this in vanilla
---
it was in cata when they added the grind for the raptor for horde
---
Absolutely loving the podcast! Love hearing stories from Mark.

1) NEVER heal or PW:S right at the start of the pull. The threat generated from that will greatly surpass what the tank can put out in the opening seconds of the fight. Make sure the tank is at or near full health \*before\* the pull and he should be able to generate enough threat before you actually need to heal.
---
2) In fact, just never use PW:S on a tank, period. Only time you should be using it is as an oh-shit button if tank is about to drop before your main heal has a chance to get cast.
---
That being said, do note that many many warriors these days seem to be abject idiots who don't know HOW to generate threat. Many of them even try tanking in regular combat stance for some inane reason. So it might not be about you. So only thing I can advise is to just save your first heal for when the tank is down to between one third and one half health. That should give enough time to stack a few sunders.
---
Only situation I can see where you might pull agro is if there are adds and no one, including the tank, is hitting them or using AOE high threat abilities. If that happens and the mob runs at you, immediately run towards your tank so he can taunt the mob off you rather than chasing you across the instance as you panic run.
---
Try using a VPN and connect to a server in the US
---
You can't see shit, and everyone does want to play with me because I am one of 3 tanks in the entire planet Earth. That doesn't help when I need to use a fucking chatroom to find a healer. 
---
I'm not even asking for the auto system, we could have had the list format. You start a group and it sits there in the group list with a title and people manually looking for a group can find it. You lose nothing, but you stupid fucking morons have no idea what it is that you actually like about classic wow so you just delete every single thing that made it better blindly, stupidly hoping that you can bring back what was lost. 
---
What was actually lost that you want back? Your childhood you stupid fucks!!!!!!!
---
Yes the popular hybrid spec is called Heart of the Wild/Natures Swiftness.
---
The big hurdle is getting separate gear sets for each roll.
---
Hey there fellow warlock.
---
I leveled 60 the other week and went from the traditional drain tank leveling build into a regular SM ruin with 3/3 imp CoA and 3/3 imp CoW with the idea that I wanted to help out as much as possible in a raid environment. I then proceeded to go about my regular felcloth grind an BOY was I inefficient. I could kill two maybe three mobs but then I had to tap into bandage or just drink. I absolutely hated it, so I quickly went back to the warlock trainer to retrain into this:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/5500201512201105--52500051020001
---
Best 5g I ever spent. With this spec, I get:
---
Solid efficiency when just mob grinding out in the open world. I can often do 8-9 lvl 53-55 mobs in a row before having to tap into bandage or drink which is really good imo (not too crazy compared to dark pact drain tanking but hey, the things I do for ruin).
---
Raid viability throgh fetching ruin. I often top the damage in dungeons by being smart with my DoTing as well as weaving in shadowburn on mobs that are low. Makes for a simple yet fun rotation to min max compared to the drain tank which is (in my humle opinion) simply boring.
---
And finally I guess this goes for most warlock specs but it allows me to solo farm maraudon (gizlock (who also drops your pre raid bis sword) -&gt; princess -&gt; rotgrip). This takes some time to get down, especially rot grip but you get a hang of it after a run or two. This farm can net you 30g+ an hour, and combined with mining or  herbalism even more.
---
That‚Äôs probably all for now. Let me know if there‚Äôs anything else you‚Äôre wondering about and gl with the rest of your classic journey!
---
Sorry, I'm transposing verbiage from other MMOs. Hard Mode, or Heroic dungeons from BC. Dungeons with mobs and mechanics scaled up for max level characters.
---
Nope, I'm not because she completely understands how much joy the game brings me and I completely understand that I can't play it 24/7.
---
It's still good to ask if it's cool to "hardwire" myself into the game for hours on end. I cannot see how this is bad. We communicate our desires for our time and do what we need to to make sure we're both happy.
---
Luckily for you, you did this ahead of time and now you can do whatever you want with your time without asking anybody how they feel about it. I'm sure ya do pal...
---
And I don't hide hobbies from my wife, I just havent been enveloped in a game like I am now since we've met.
---
Thx man! I will try It out tomorrow. 
---
Now I need to sleep. Its pretty late here in Germany ^^
---
47 Rogue here.  Id just farm snapjaws by steamwheedle port for 6 hrs straight.  They usually net about 20g per hr if you AH the leather and scales.
---
Yeaaah, if you're going to be THAT asshole and put a fuckton of single stacks on the AH then forget to change the starting bid form a copper to something close to the buy out price? You shouldn't get to cancel the Auction after it's been bid on.
---
That's what I thought!
---
I'd imagine it's gonna be difficult to get recruited if you are charging the guild for a trial run.
---
This was most responses yeah
---
In the German translation some of the jokes (e. g. male tauren) aren't even jokes, more like proverbs or idioms. Funnily enough that's what actually gets people laughing when everyone in your group tells a /joke and then your tauren says something completely unrelated.
---
that would be nice, get to the fucking point already authors.

Leveling is different

PLEASE,HORDE GUYS! Give me a chance to buff you :( Always when i spam hug/pat/wait emotions you are fine, but after im starting cast MC u stun me and run :( I just want buff players T_T  PS Zandalar server :(
---
This is so good to hear. I absolutely LOVE classic because of how well PVE content correlates to PVP ownage.
---
Oh, if thats just a leveling build, that makes sense
---
MTing right now is as easy as it gets. MC is incredibly easy with a coordinated group and it should not take you long to consistently clear. Our guild is down to an hour and a half clears and it's only our 4th week in. Onyxia is a similar story, it really just comes down to coordination. Most nights we split our MC 40 into 2 20 man groups and clear that way.
---
So if you're thinking about MTing a guild, try to find a fresh forming group of people and freaking go for it. It's incredibly rewarding in terms of loot and connections.
---
ok, now put that on a arms warrior who crits for 5k and tell me that doesn't break the game.
---
They might just be useless boe greens
---
I'm not saying they aren't good, but warrior just scales better as a fact of how the threat mechanics work. Holy damage only for threat is very limiting when you consider the amount of consumables and niche equips available. Add to that the actual tanking utility a warrior gets (3 taunts, piercing howl, LS/SW) and they are objectively better. Right out of the gates at 60 with just some random quest blues and a few dungeon items then yeah, paladins are going to do more aoe threat, but it wont stay that way.
---
Also, a warrior can just 2h tank any 5-man in the game while topping DPS so the whole best dungeon tank argument doesn't really mean much.
---
Your cow looks super silly on that mount but grats!!
---
I've found helping them kill whatever mob they are fighting at the time builds that initial trust!
---
Also try /calm
---
That makes sense. I recently finished John Staat's book (excellent read, very much recommend) and his notes suggest the Talents were designed and implemented very late in the class design process, it doesn't really seem like there was any room for an entire spec of priest to be developed and dropped.
---
I have a 5 year old HP non-gaming laptop. As long as all the graphics settings are medium it runs fine.
---
Yea as an orc I‚Äôd always lean towards axe. What would be the combo for raiding and a mix of dungeons? Would that build not be sufficient if I have a lot of +defense gear?

Yeah, 26 to 35 probably takes longer than 1-26 did. Warrior is the hardest class to level. I‚Äôd check out hunter/mage/lock if I were you.
---
My grind group has done over 100 runs total. We have had 1 drop. Went to a lowby we were carrying on the runs. Least it went to a guild mate though
---
2 or 3 you are not at hit cap yet. I am leaning on 2 because of the 2% hit but I do not know the math behind the hit % over 300 weapon skill. The +8 could very well equate to over 1% hit and make it better but I do not know.
---
Thx alot, i will try this o.o &lt;3
---
was just making fun of you're wording, I know what you mean but "time is money friend"
---
Dude this is a great screenshot wow
---
Consider grinding the ghosts and satyrs in the west azshara. They are a few levels lower so you will smash through them. The naga in the ruins in the centre are great too, perhaps better exp at your level.
---
Only dead horse the Alliance can ride.
---
Not bad! My wife and I played seriously for a month or two, and got bored/frustrated when that involved taking half an hour to drive around town every night to hit pokestops. Boring for me because I was just driving in circles and she'd get all excited when good Pokemon popped up, or stopping in front of Pokestops, and stressful for her managing two phones at once while in a moving car. Maybe it'll be better now.

trying too hard to placate everyone, dicksucker

Literally beg in major cities. You would be surprised how generous people can be especially those who feel power and throw around their gold. All you have to do is brush their ego and they will throw gold at you.
---
You're such an asshole.
---
seen both sides of it. 
---
i have buddies that will blacklist tanks if say they want to reserve orbs / reserve loot / etc. i've also seen the struggle that warriors/paladins have with general content as far as being able to farm gold effectively.

general vibe is exactly as you describe, some people hate it, some people are ok with it. if you plan to do it, plan to step on some toes.

I am a bit lost about something with druid.

Is an armor bonus granted by a set (in example +200 armor when +2 from a set), is multiplied when you are in the druid form ? or not ?

Everytime i see this meme writing I study it, cuz everytime i try and do it I'm like this is so hard to write, am I doing it right?

I set my starting bid to the vendor price and always undercut all identical items. If there's a bunch of competition then I won't post or only post for 8 hours to avoid being undercut and eating the deposit fee.
---
I truly don't understand your point of view, respectfully. 
---
You are talking about blizzard not doing something because its difficult and the revenue is not guaranteed....on a subreddit founded on a game that was difficult with non guaranteed revenue...Im not a fan of what blizzard just did with the hong kong thing but as far as dev.....blizzard has shown more promise sense Wotlk. 
---
i hope we can have this discussion because i want to understand your point of view
---
Instant gets around 110 if I'm not mistaken. I never use it on my MH in pve or pvp anyways, always has around 30-40 charges when it wears off.
---
the cenarion hold quests arent in the game yet.  there's the one quest from moonglade that has you do some shit at the silithid night elf town and the hydraxian quest to kill elementals in the NW corner but the other ones will come out in the AQ phase
---
I wonder how often it activates.
---
From your Auto Attacks. Is 10% for 5 points really that big of a deal when Sunder armor doesn‚Äôt do damage and shield slam isn‚Äôt affected by it? 
---
I mean it‚Äôs a good talent and worth taking, but calling it the star of the tree seems off to me.
---
Quality is the problem.
---
&gt; increase iLvl so that new gear is more powerful than (most) of the old gear
---
this is a gear reset, 
---
When the gear gets out of control they raise the level so they can change ratings scaling and everybody starts from bottom again.
---
when numbers get out of control they squish them.
---
More of a difference than you, supporting a company that‚Äôs willing to censor speech in fear of China. FOH with that noise.
---
Your point stands that literally 1% of the population is 60? It's such a ridiculous fucking statement. Like seriously. If you want to make a point don't be hyperbolic about it because you end up looking stupid. 
---
At this point, 6 weeks in, a large portion of the playerbase is already 60. It might not be a majority but it's a good chunk
---
Hehe, not at all, was probably just lucky !
---
(We all know that is the reason, I just wanted to see if he would try to rationalize it.)
---
Downranking is useful for not overhealing. So if you're just topping someone off, it's better to use a lower rank and less mana costly heal than it is to use your most powerful heal where half of it gets wasted.
---
You can only start Death Knights at level 55. There are no level 1 Death Knights. Just like there are no Demon Hunters before level 100.

Deathbringer is leagues ahead of Mirah's

Nothing more satisfying than hitting a clothie with stormstrike then earth shock with a windfury proc in between and insta killing them.
---
You can heal BRD in full Shadow too, really isnt that bad
---
There's almost nothing there currently
---
You get a quest to visit and then loot some slime shit out of the tower and that's it
---
Hydraxian waterlords want you to kill a few elementals
---
There is exactly nothing else there

&gt;You make a great point regarding the stance bars, I didn‚Äôt think of that.
---
Hehe, it was a game changer for me when I realized it. Any keybinding you can shave off feels amazing!

On the other note though, do you use the same finger for mouse1 and mouse2? Or middle finger for mouse2?

I'm just curious by the way, I love discussing hardware mechanics in WoW in general

---
Uhhh im not sure I don't use twitch for my addons, but I would assume it is since it is extremely popular.
---
Just have gear sets alternate how you play your class rather than just make you more powerful. You can make gear set bonus act like how prime/major glyphs did, where they were able to enhance/alter your abilities. This method could also be used to introduce new spells. Imagine as a Mage, a gear set that converts your fire blast into an ice lance and further down enhances it to increase damage vs frozen targets like a talent would. You don't have to increase the level cap or mess with the talent tree.
---
You are donkey, good riddance.

There is a fun game called geoguesser which shows you one picture of a landscape or city or pretty much anywhere and you get 3 guesses as to where it is in the world and you get more points the closer your guesses are to being correct.
---
Reading this has just made me decide to go and gank everyone on kalimdor as a alliance. Those poor alliance players will not be ganked in vain and I WILL AVENGE MY FALLEN BROTHERS!
---
I played warrior for years and the one thing that always bugged me was they really have no "perks" like other classes do. Their perk is that they can be any race and can use pretty much any weapon, while shaman can rez, get ghost wolf at 20, get water walking and water breathing, ect...
---
If you are looking for a generic spec that does well I would spec into affliction and only into demo for improved voidwalker. Once you hit 35ish you‚Äôll notice you rip agro off your VW with your dots and a single wand so for me that‚Äôs when I respec‚Äôed and went deeper into affliction but I still used some points for improved healthstone and the stam buff. At around 35ish I started using succubus and haven‚Äôt looked back. I have tried to go back to voidwalker but absolutely doesn‚Äôt work for tanking.
---
This is like getting exalted with bloodsail Buccaneers
---
It can also depend on how "fresh" your main healing spell is.  At level 37 I was healing Cath for some folks and had to semi-spam heals.  Then at 38 I got some new ranks of heals and suddenly I wasn't healing nearly as much.  Single casts were enough where I was using two casts previously.  Another thing is how much Spirit you have, and whether you have any talents that allow mana regen while casting.  As a shaman, I'm not aware of any talents that help like spirit tap or meditation does with priests, and you might not be getting much spirit gear.  
---
I also feel like the healing efficiency of your standard heals are less than that of priests.  So it could also be that if you and a 19 priest compared healing, they might be healing more hp for less mana per cast, or maybe the mana amounts would be similar but the priest has more output.  I'm not super familiar with shaman skills but it's a possibility.
---
Well depending on how someone would want to do it seems more like its reserving items to vendor most commonly with direct gold payments being the smaller percentage of people. The thing that got me started down this path is when this past weekend a guy offered to pay me 10g to tank an elite dragon he needed to kill for his Ony attunement.
---
What is the action bar addon you use.
---
And the bar at the top with all the info
---
Please and thank you
---
Save up on Int spirit gear. If u decide that enhance is boring then for sure try elemental. Someone suggested windfury, also try rockbiter for big 2handers. While wind can create big numbers , rockbiter is a steady dps increase. There are a couple of different specs for shammys - YouTube and see if u like any
---
Depends what you consider your endgame.
---
PVP: Yes. Shadow priests are monsters in PVP
---
PVE: No, hell no. You don't have the mana for sustained DPS, nor spells like Innervate or Evocation to boost your mana back up. So a Shadow DPSing a raid will be rendered quickly useless on a long boss fight. Also note that some Shadow spells generate a ton of threat. And you REALLY don't want to generate too much threat as DPS.
---
Priests are most effective when they are not constantly casting. So you cast a few spells back to back ... and then stop casting so that your Spirit regen kicks in after 5s. It's why Spirit is the single most important stat for Priests. I'm sure you'll have noticed in 5 mans that a Priest will often let a tank drop to a third of his health before casting a big heal + renew ... and then stopping casting again for a bit.
---
To be fair this is from tencent games, a Chinese based company that has stocks in blizzard. But  h blizzard should probably say something about this whole incident
---
yeah I guess I always de‚Äôd my greens in original. banker alt with disenchanting is a really good idea. i‚Äôll try that.
---
Oh so you're one of those assholes this is essentially griefing and you are proud of it.
---
My man.
---
i would sell some herbs from my bank :O  
---
and for 6 hours its possible for me to grab new herbs for 100g i guess.
---
Yeah this, especially if it‚Äôs weird stats like agility/spirit or intellect/strength. OP If they‚Äôre good BOEs, id suggest trying to sell them on trade chat, put them on the AH once, and if they don‚Äôt sell just vendor or disenchant
---
I've tried the succ and the vw.
---
succ kills faster, but i prefer the vw because I am able to take on 3 mobs at a time consistently without needing any fears and it's still fast enough and I still drain and dark pact enough to barely ever need down time.
---
That's short, and correct.
---
Not sure that "Hey, BonerDude69 ninja'ed my dungeon" is considered "witch-hunting."
---
Witch-hunting usually involves trying to track down the *person*, not just blacklisting their online persona for bad behavior.
---
So for example, if some dude locked his kid in a hot car at the grocery store, it would be "witch hunting" to post his name and encourage people to send him hate mail, etc.
---
I use true aim. I had 5% total hit last night ruining MC and I missed less then 1% of the time......
---
If you have true aim gauntlets with the rest of your gear the same, you are hit capped. That +8 skill makes a big difference. 
---
I also got epic chrome leggings. So I never went devilsaur route.
---
People forget back then nobody knew how to level fast. Most of the people had never played MMOs, it took them months to reach 60. In addition there was no wowhead or questie to help you with quest you'd be stuck with. 
---
Ragnaros himself wasn't difficult on nowadays standards, and by the time people were 60 they could do Dire Maul.
---
These days people know all the quests by heart and most efficient route to level.
---
But yes Ragnaros lived longest out of all raid bosses. Whether it is earned title is arguable.
---
I'm not saying Naxx weapons aren't strong. I'm saying that your point of "later gear lets you crit reliably" is wrong. You can already crit reliably.
---
Fair enough then, seems to be reasonable to let people level up really fast when they are trying to catch up to people in the hundreds though.
---
/use spellstone

/equip offhand

Instead of typing those names you can just shift-right-click the items in your inventory when you have the macro window open and it will automatically write the name correctly

Meanwhile 4 frost mages and a lone priest awaken from a brief and restless slumber. The priest laughs and the mages spit upon them while muttering a plethora of indiscernable insults in gutterspeak, as an endless barrage of frostbolts rend the flesh from whitemanes bones. Leaving mograne once again alone in the face of defeat. As the last vestiges of life and hope leave his body he can almost understand the wretched utterings coming from their mouths..."Gz on hat bro" yes. Just as the gods intended it.
---
It‚Äôs qualitatively different. People are protesting because an American company is bowing to the wishes of Chinese government and censoring free speech. That solely benefits China.
---
It‚Äôs true that the economic repercussions of supporting China manufacturing are also catching up to us, but a different conversation altogether. Cancel your WoW sub if you can see the direct link between your free speech and Blizzard‚Äôs willingness to cave to China.
---
Yes, and it's glorious. You gotta' appreciate a nice bit of cheese sometimes. Otherwise Doctor Who would never have existed.
---
That logic shut ya down it seems. You‚Äôve been given enough attention, cya
---
I found master trade skills, maybe the same?
---
I just wouldn't put an expensive enchant on a weapon you're going to replace quickly, not that you shouldn't raid.
---
If you can afford it by all means, but I dont think its worth it.
---
People on Earthfury or Skeram... what's the population and faction balance like right now? I'm on skeram now but theres seemingly a big horde imbalance here. I can transfer to Earthfury, but am skeptical if it's any better over there. Or if Earthfury is going to be a dead server in a few months.
---
If you want to be 100% certain it's not exploiting. Aggro a guard and run it to the position in question. If the guard fights you there, not exploiting. If the guard evades you, prolly exploiting.
---
Paladin would like a word with you.
---
What?? What's the difference?
---
So you don't mind that Blizzard is refusing to even comment or discuss with us in the Western world, yet has officially apologized to China to "defend the pride of the country (China)"?
---
Set your minimum price higher.
---
That‚Äôs a stupid take. He‚Äôs having fun playing the game.
---
I really dont ask my wife if i can game, she just expects it at this point because its my primary hobby and it always has been since we met.
---
Now if i wanted to go buffalo wild wings for a few beers with my buddies from work after we are off,  thats when i would let her know my plans and make sure she knows why i didnt come home after work or why i might need a ride home because iv been drinking.
---
I understand where you are coming from.   Happy wife, happy life.   I just know too many people who chose to omit certain interest or hobbies,  and it becomes overly difficult to implement that into their relationship later because it never existed to begin with.  Not saying this is you,  but in sure we can both agree honestly and openness about who you are or how you live your life will go a long way down the road.
---
But that's PvP / War Mode.  It's a fact of life, and living through that is part of the process.
---
I dunno if ppl do that- charging for tank. Be wary of your reputation. Classic wow is a small world
---
best mobs. I killed around 1300:of them around 39-42 lvls. Good gold (for those levels) and meditative process :)
---
I agree, he broke the rules. The issue is that the rules aren‚Äôt fair, and they would definitely selectively enforce them. I bet the same would not happen if an American won and said ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù in his speech
---
&gt;but warrior just scales better as a fact of how the threat mechanics work
---
Warrior scales better for low target and single target threat. Warrior threat does not scale at all for 6+ target threat because they are global locked attempting to generate threat on so many targets. Threat generation stays completely static for Warriors on large volume pulls from quest greens to Naxx.
---
&gt;Holy damage only for threat is very limiting when you consider the amount of consumables and niche equips available.
---
Holy damage only for threat is extremely limiting and scales very poorly compared to warriors.. for low target and single target encounters.
---
&gt;when you consider the amount of consumables and niche equips available
---
I'm not sure what you're referring to. Oil of Immolation and Dragonbreath Chilli for example are actually significantly more powerful on Paladins due to SP scaling.
---
&gt;Add to that the actual tanking utility a warrior gets (3 taunts, piercing howl, LS/SW) and they are objectively better
---
Piercing Howl is a kiting ability which is only useful in situations where the group has lost control, and taunts are great for raids and largely irrelevant for dungeons outside of some specific circumstances like Krastinov in Scholo.
---
&gt;Paladins are going to do more aoe threat, but it wont stay that way.
---
I'm legitimately confused as to how you can arrive at this conclusion, because Warriors have the worst AoE threat generation in the game and what little they do have is spec and cooldown reliant (Sweeping Strikes). Bears and Paladins are massively more effective at all stages than Warriors at AoE threat generation.
---
&gt; If I choose Druid to commit my time to and end up tanking again, do you find "bad" groups easier to manage than Warrior tanking?
---
I can't speak to warriors but I've had very little issue with tanking dungeons, currently lvl 54 and done a ton of dungeon tanking as a druid. 100% pugs. Sure you get the occasional trigger happy dps but if you manage your taunts and threat well it's never been that bad for me. I honestly don't know what would be different though as a warrior, maybe you you just had bad groups.
---
Those cables are 4g on my server and I have 5 patterns for them from farming a barman shanker. It‚Äôs insane how different the economies are across servers.
---
Holy spec, with talents that boost holy damage and crit, is quite good for soloing. The advantage of Shadow is in PVP, not PVE. Basically it comes down this:
---
Shadow: questing + PVP  
---
Holy: questing + healing.
---
Simple as that.
---
Ain't gonna deny it...fucking love that.
---
gear and xp makes it worth it.

Stopped counting around 60 runs, gotta be 100+ by now. Never even seen HoJ or SGC, much less lost a roll. Seen Banthok probably 10 times now and the healer trinket twice that. So, I've started leveling my Priest since the game insists I should play a caster^/s
---
Just hoping to get it before p2 where I reckon it'll be moved to Emp's loot table and be even more nightmarish to farm.
---
I spent most of my 55-60 farming BRD... I would have to do it anyway at 60 for pre raid bis so I thought it's the most time effective way to do it
---
It randomly occurs I've only seen it once in STV.
---
Touche\^

Good for you I don‚Äôt even invite rogues cause I‚Äôd prefer a mage
---
What bag addon do you use
---
Like the mage that messaged me today to invite me to some SM spellcleave, and when I told him I was fire spec, felt the need to berate me about it. People suck.
---
I can‚Äôt for the life of me work out which one you mean.
---
Hes a horde who kites a mob that kills players to one of his own capitols and places it right by the flightmaster. Sure he's having fun but at the expense of quite a few others enjoyments. What prioritizes his enjoyment over others?
---
Shitting on it without explaining why is very unhelpful.
---
Also, having the logs in players‚Äô hands allows for easier community level control.
---
stay away from our sm alliance dog
---
Nah, if no classic BC i will drop classic and start playing BC pservers.
---
Yeah and they're still moderating all the other posts about it... So they still think it's not relevant.
---
Na your lack of English prowess and nonsensical logic alluding to a potential fix for allowing players access rooftops made me laugh. Take care!
---
It's really fast xp and ravenger so yes.
---
+5 is about 1% hit if I remember right
---
I can‚Äôt put my finger on it, but this GM conversation seems off. I have never once saw a GM have spelling and grammar errors while interacting with them. I‚Äôm not saying this isn‚Äôt true it just seems odd....
---
Also, go stand outside of org/mc if you wanna pvp. Stop dotting level 45s on your 60 inside town because your bored.
---
This would interfere with [stealth] pounce. You would be lined up to pounce and hit the macro and you'd exit stealth, no good. 
---
The two ways I think this could be done is with a modifier, or exists/help/harm.
---
/cancelaura [mod:shift, nocombat, stealth] Prowl
---
/cancelaura [nocombat, noharm, stealth] Prowl
---
This way if you are not targeting an enemy and hit the macro you exit stealth, but if you have an enemy target and you're in stealth you will Pounce.

people praise ironfoe but it's worse than mirahs song for tanking right? especially when dire maul comes out that epic sword from quest chain is 100x better
---
Can I roll on your cloth drop since you wouldn't have gotten to the boss without me/group? I could use the gold.
---
Someone give this guy a pedestal to preach on while he criticizes the dude who's doing what he can when he can.

If you have the original 1.12 client it uses mpq and you can extract them.
---
No way Paladin is slower. It is definitely way more boring though
---
Yes, it is.
---
It was changed in a later expansion because Warriors and Paladins QQ'd about druids and death knights getting more armor from rings and such.
---
I usually try to go ahead and do green quests before they turn gray.
---
Mentioning names and the decisions they made is not witch hunting. Calling for people to ignore report or gank someone IS rules #3. Mods have commented on this before.
---
Looks good man :)
---
They don‚Äôt need it, it just helps speed it along. At 55, the biggest issue would be aggro radius and sneaking past a few of the tighter packs.
---
Try once or twice, then just vendor it.
---
You can annoy people a little, and it makes sense from an RP perspective. But if you spend hours just killing a quest giver, you will prob get banned.
---
I want to ban the guy just for being so myopic.
---
I'd guess healers could be a level below or two? 
---
Healed full LBRS at 55, although with the rest being 58-60.
---
Rank 3 is incredibly easy to hit, 1 is the lowest rank and 14 is the highest
---
Self awareness is very hard for some people.
---
Like leveling blacksmithing? Its not like the rogue needs to buy lockpicks.
---
Listing for 24hr is a terrible idea.  Only Ah items that there is a want for, for greens that is only for pieces without a simple quest reward for the same slot.  I  would save decent blues, they will rocket up in value in a few months
---
I would love it too, but if they make Classic+ then it will come pretty close to killing retail.
---
People will want to play the game with an active future. Classic will always have a niche population that will play it for the nostalgia and gameplay, but retail exists because it has a future development.

It's not griefing in the slighest. I'm not ruining anybody's experience. In fact, most people were very cool about the mob kite themselves, used emotes, chatted and attacked him several times despite dying. Also, this mob doesn't have an indiscriminate timed AoE like some other world bosses, so he attacks almost only people who engage him, his AoE isn't happening that much. Players who didn't care ignored it, and outside of a couple AFK/very unlucky guys who got into the AoE once it didn't affect their gameplay.
---
It's interesting how I got completely different reactions from people after doing that. Most people rather enjoyed it, thought it was funny and exciting, and then you have people who go apeshit ***because they died once*** to a super rare case of an elite npc hanging in UC. I don't even want to know how much these people rage when they get ganked, much less corpsecamped. Either way, I didn't try nor wanted to ruin anybody's experience. At most, make it more spicy in a funny event :D
---
The only time a priest MCs me is to drag me out into the ocean and drown me :[
---
Now kiss
---
so, your political views are identical to the views of your boss?
---
Oh c'mon, it's like a player-made special event! Personally, I love this kinda thing.
---
I hope there is a NSFW Episode of that.
---
Like DKP systems havent been abused and manipulated to officer's advantage for years. Get in a guild that you trust. All that can be said.
---
I ended up going lock a while ago and left my priest. Thank you though
---
at 38 i'd recommend going Deep Dive's Drain Tank specc. pretty fun, no down time, i found it far more engaging and fun of a build. can just google it to find the google doc/yt video on it. cant link atm   
---
aside from that, the standard affliction with some in demo worked for me till that point
---
&gt;rogue still had to go out and level their skill,
---
So did the blacksmith. Its not like the rogue needs to buy lockpicks.
---
Been playing since the first time vanilla released, predominantly tanking 5 mans as a blacksmith; no rogue in my group has ever held a chest for ransom. I never use keys cause theyre worth more then the contents of most chests; its not a gamble you tend to win on.
---
China are a state capitalist society. The governments tendency to collude with Chinese companies is well known, something the government undoubtedly benefits from. Hence why they are a fast rising economy.
---
If you want to protest their authoritarian regime, I'm afraid more sacrifices will need to be made from all.
---
Classic players are voting. Not just people who try it, but people who actually play it. It's just qualified voting.
---
Top one should be titled "Block/Parry/Miss".
---
Thus I prefer lots of little shots. Cuz when that big one doesn't land, it's a long wait to the next.
---
I disagree with druids being most effective as restoration. I think that‚Äôs an old tale from back when players didn‚Äôt understand the game as well as they do now.
---
I leveled my Druid in classic almost 100% in dungeons, almost all PUG - and always as a bear tank.
---
It took maybe 200 dungeons and I think there where less than 20 wipes total. Usually due to someone accidentally pulling more mobs.
---
Endgame almost every boss can be tanked by Druid as well thanks to the extreme levels of physical mitigation and single target threat through maul.
---
In pre-raid BiS you can get 55% physical reduction unbuffed thanks to the armor multiplier affecting trinkets, rings and weapons as well.
---
Mace is worth a lot of gold.
---
Improved Aspect of the Hawk would be my guess.
---
So me carefully looking at patrols, being super careful and waiting for the perfect moment to strike without alerting the guards means I should be banned. Great.
---
You can do that still in classic? I'm sure they removed it pretty early in WoW history. Never tried it.
---
Mages had invisibility the spell.
---
I went to do this on a boat once and felt too bad. I ended up just running towards the edge and scaring the shit out of him. I'm weak :(
---
Everyone says it but it doesn't make it true. It's like how every small town has the best pizza place in the world, or the best Chinese restaurant in the world or.............
---
Also, Forsaken were immune to fear and charm.
---
1) Grind beasts instead of humanoids. Most of the gold comes from gray beast items you vendor.
---
2) Level 35 you can have zero gold and still make your mount money. At 37, I'd prefer you had 40 gold to make it by 40. When you ding 38, you should be at 60 gold.  You need to go on a starvation budget and eat ramen while you're killing stuff.
---
It‚Äôs funny, because the name is actually L√∫thien, meaning both are incorrect. If you‚Äôre going to use a special character, make sure it fits. Still annoying, but at least then it would be accurate.
---
You know what the real scary thing is? i hit 60 this past weekend and now the ads i get on youtube are for raid carries instead of leveling.
---
thats true! you make a great point
---
I bet he's gonna....need a hand!
---
&gt; you got to 60 without any keybinds
---
not "without any custom keybinds"
---
&gt;you got to 60 **without any keybinds**
---
but nice try
---
I don‚Äôt mind the way they look on their own. But paired with any preexisting content like mounts just looks weird.
---
Which part?
---
It wouldn't be the common redditor, it'd be specifically classic players who have played enough to hit 60. In a year's time even the most casual player who consistently gets on would be there on at least 1 character. Retail players wouldn't vote and neither would randos who just made an account.
---
A perfect score.
---
I would spend those 3.8 second windows looking up random shit on wowhead
---
Then at 40 I got MS and everything changed
---
&gt; and places it right by the flightmaster 
---
I can't do that and made it explicit in my post. Have you read it ?
---
&gt; Sure he's having fun but at the expense of quite a few others enjoyments 
---
Hardly. Most people seemed to enjoy the presence of that mob. It was rather funny and unusual. Also, there's a big difference between getting killed once in this bizarre scenario (and few people who didn't attack the mob themselves died), and getting killed the whole day without being able to do what you want in the capital city - that would be griefing, and it's certainly not what happened.
---
That would have been awesome if they made that happen.  Monks at the get go.
---
&gt; DM did not invalidate MC. No one stopped running MC because DM came out so why would they this time around?
---
that's not what I said, I said, "shortened the lifespan of the first raid"
---
and again, why couldn't they just stick to the original release schedule? why do they really need to get DM out a month earlier? the 6 phases were ok, deviating because of some knee jerk fear is stupid
---
No. Stop. In a 5 man a dps shouldnt have aggro.
---
Stop being the fucking rogue who goes for any target I dont mark.
---
If you want to tank roll a tank. Hell spam LFG chat with "tank rogue lfg" for all I care.
---
Less mobs on me means less rage. Less rage is less damage. Less damage is less threat overall.
---
Dont make my job harder. Dont make the healers job harder. Dont make the instance take longer.
---
Focus the fucking skull. Even if the rank had a tard moment and skilled the sword and shield mob instead of the caster.
---
Do your job please. Let the tanks do theirs; tank mobs. Thanks!
---
Your local friendly bear who no longer invites rogues because of this mindset. :3
---
If you do it in a way that evades normal guard behavior, yes.
---
Thank you so much for not spelling it "exhalted"!
---
Ahh, +1 dagger skill and +5 arcane resistance. Super OP set bonuses.
---
Again... That doesn't matter. The average WoW player is retarded.
---
Frostbolt is a mage spell for (EX)emple, which do damage and put a debuff over time on a target, with the Vanilla engine it needed 5 actions for it to be completed, with the Bfa engine it need just 2.
---
for the boss it's the same, all spells have to be redone, if you do believe they have taken a copy of Vanilla and pasted it on the Bfa engine, it's definitely a no.
---
Technically, neither of them did.
---
Does the mace still not have a level requirement and is badass for 19 twinks? Crusader on a 19 is fun.
---
The only good money from fishing is the pure elemental pools in azshara. Each cast has a 30% chance to bring up an essence of water. There are I think 6 pools on a roughly 1 hour respawn so usually a good amount of competition. Requires close to, if not 300 fishing plus a strong lure. I fish with 425 and have no issues. 
---
Aside from that just park yourself in moonglade and fish up the 8 mp5 fish. Totally cant remember the name since I'm at school but it's quite a frequent catch there.
---
Yeah this is a good rule of thumb for classic, play down. Green means good to go, not too low to worry about. Questing in a zone 3-5 levels lower than you will be a breeze.
---
There are already a lot of pugs going mc and ony, I dont think those will stop going. If they grind out reasonable gear, it should be doable to get a spot a in a BWL guild at least. But yes, theres a huge early mover advantage.
---
Moonguard is for lovers after all.
---
Or leveling up an alt in Path of Exile.
---
Heads up there's no dead end catacomb in duskwood. There's only 2 and they're linked together by a small passage.
---
Ahhh that makes sense and is unfair and I don't like it.
---
Its a distinct possibility in any guild loot system. DKP is easily abused.  Any small cluster of ppl van collude to drive ppl out of dkp with bidding or keep bids low for their friends.
---
With DKP, anyone in the guild can corrupt the process, not just loot council. I fucking hate DKP.
---
Jeez Mr. Partypooper. What's in the bag, some party poop?
---
3.5 seconds wait for a swing that could miss? I'll just stay fury.
---
ok. i'll use deathbringer thanks :)
---
The 0.8 threat coefficient is a big part of it, but having to face the mob you are tanking and having no skills that generate extra threat really are what makes it difficult. You have to dps alot higher than everyone else on average or have ways to compensate for that, like misdirections or tranq totem.
---
through is back on? huh
---
IIRC it need separate database, provided by other addon or even tool that connect to some online DB.  
---
I deleted TSM after finding this)
---
&gt;I'm not sure what you're referring to. Oil of Immolation and Dragonbreath Chilli for example are actually significantly more powerful on Paladins due to SP scaling.
---
Did they change these to holy damage in a patch or something? Add Force Reactive Disk, other engi items, and every thorn effect but Ret Aura to the list of things that are better on warrior. Spell power scaling isn't better than talented def stance. This isn't even theory crafting it's been tried and proven on private servers. To top all that off even if a paladin did do more AoE threat they simply can't survive the pulls a warrior can because they don't have the cooldowns.
---
Dont know about that, sounds op.
---
are you saying 24hr is too short or too long? why? also hear you on the greens, no one buys. just didn‚Äôt realize because last toon I was enchanter
---
As long as the beard is visible it's ok. That's the actual rule
---
We're on 1.12. Not 2.0 pre-patch.
---
Went through the back entrance :) I think he would despawn on the elevator, like for the guys who tried to kite Devilsaurs to Orgrimmar through the Thousand Needles. That being said, Scatter Shot works on him, same as Wing Clip, so in theory I could have survived with him on the elevator too with correct positionning.
---
It's not. The speed and damage are great but can be replaced fairly quickly. The defense proc is sort of hilarious because the benefits of defense would make 0 sense because youre probably gonna get hit twice while its proc'd.
---
I did sunken temple and searing gorge at your level. Felwood ist not too high, you just can't do everything at once. Do half of it and add Azshara, Blasted Lands and WPL as needed. Winterspring is only good for the last push to 60, but farming BRD will bring you a long way too at 55+.
---
its free guys
---
I mean yeah, statistically there should be quite a lot of them.  I‚Äôd even suggest the fact someone is playing wow classic right now probably going to bias toward various mental illnesses.  We‚Äôd probably see a higher percentage than in general pop.
---
Yes, that‚Äôs surely true. However, continuing to support Blizzard after this incident sends a clear message to China that they can make American companies self-censor any message critical of China. I will not support that.
---
Should I put a cheaper enchant like +4 weapon damage on it?
---
Can't remember what it's called but it's the only way to reasonably pug imo.
---
Basically you get 100 points (or gold) to spend in a run and someone keeps a table. Then you silent bid as the raid lead  links gear, bidding up to that 100 point / gold limit. You bid what you want but high bid takes it. Once you spend your points they're gone until next run though.
---
Nobody can place blame if they get outbid and it's fair to pugs.
---
You can add 10-20 points per boss kill to encourage people sticking around and the people that started the run will have more points than late comers but nothing extraordinary. Reset every week.
---
It's likely you use points now but later you can do it for gold and each item purchased for gold is evenly split at the end so even if you get no gear you get good.
---
Couldnt disagree more, i think holy paladins wearing cloth is cool.
---
Wouldnt recommend the demonology tree for leveling. Drain tanking is better but u need good wands before u r lvl 38
---
im always feel very uncozy by asking water from random mages for my day-leveling, so i always pay them more than I could waste if i would buy same quality water from vendor (which wont dissapear later). Im dumb :( But cant stop paying them, cause im wasting their time, dunno
---
same here, even with talents the vw loses its appeal.
---
only good to send him on a suicide run while you loot something
---
Last I heard he quit wow to play other games.
---
You even look the same!!!
---
Wait, why are people shitting on mages?
---
Titan panel on the top, and action bars are Dominos:)
---
I dunno, I've never seen someone say it doesn't drop, I've seen tons of people say that the extremely rare drop is an extremely rare drop
---
Neatplates
---
Too bad I already have my tiger.
---
So good
---
Paladins could use those same consumables tho?
---
ZE HAHA HA HA HA
---
It doesn't get multiplied afaik. Enchants, armor kits, and bonuses don't get multiplied.
---
I went dual wield while moving down arms at about 25 until I got whirlwind axe. Ended up doing more damage with dual wield than I could with the 2 handers I was finding.
---
They were full on undead with all the default powers undead mobs had, like fear and charm immunity, as well as breathing underwater.
---
Maybe they wanted to seperate the vowels I and E.
---
Yes, like leveling blacksmithing. That's the point I was trying to make. Some people saying, "Well the blacksmith spent money leveling BS" But the rogues spent time(read: money) leveling lockpicking.
---
Can we get some more of this content! So riveting!
---
While that is obnoxious, having a few versions of a peice is nowhere near the level of cancer as war/titanforging
---
Hey I climbed this mountain
---
As a lock I constantly get people taking mobs that my vw is already on and half my dots are already on. They seem to be able to easily steal mobs until i hit it with a wand or start draining.
---
I haven't gone off on them though, most i usually do is a /shoo at them if they are repeatedly doing it.
---
Actually wow‚Äôs most useless classic faction. The troll necklaces reward is worse than the throwing weapons I think.
---
Basically ur mission now is get onyxia done and get full raid pre bis so hopefully u know a tank
---
They don't do Holy Damage, that's the whole point. They get no extra threat were as a Warrior with talents gets 1.49x ALL damage as threat.
---
But then you are spending training points on a skill you aren't using.
---
Winnipeg ‚Äî&gt; Toronto :)
---
Probably just timing. There wouldn't be much point to advertise raid carries before now since the average player is only in the 50s.
---
I mean it just happens sometimes. As a warrior it's quite common for me to charge an enemy, only to have another player who was clearly going for them come into view as soon as I get there.
---
At the end of the day, you have exactly as much right to that enemy as the other player does, the important point is to just not be a dick about it. When I accidentally steal somebody's pull, I usually leave a few enemies in the area specifically for them to kill, and/or help them out with a mob they tagged already. On the other hand if there's a mage 10 levels above me who's tagging literally everything and AoEing all 10 of these enemies to death at once every time, well screw him I'm going to pull what I damn well like.
---
Sounds like you should show up on time to raids instead of being lazy. My so called dog shit guild is the best on my server.
---
That goes for pretty decent money on retail for transmog (slutmog)
---
If you only buy stuff that isn't overpriced but shows up first due to 1c bid prices, then people will lose money posting items and not selling them.
---
Very nice writeup!

I have all except Shen'dralar and Vol'jin's Spear, both of which are no longer obtainable :-(

oh that makes more sense. Nothing like this no!

On a basis of gold removed from economy per day, there is no comparison. AH is king.
---
I usually pull agro from tanks in dungeons by dpsing
---
No, target the company as well. Singling out Kotick as an individual response lets many other people off the hook who would doubtless have been involved in the decision. Just don't blame the devs.
---
Rng
---
This has gotta be bullshit
---
Yeah I thought about that but I was looking at 10 boss fights so I feel like that should be enough to account for variance.
---
Mom: We have Quel'Serrar at home.
---
I just mean for personal use really, but I did see a Hauberk that's a large upgrade for me, I just missed it at the trainer somehow.
---
Arent brs like pre 60 5 &amp; 10mans anyways?
---
You can do mc and ony from 55
---
Look up a preBIS guide for mages in vanilla(to your spec), deck your character out on those blues (got like 4 pieces from one brd run myself) and then youll have no problem pugging mc and ony if your guild isnt up to scratch
---
Aux is my favorite
---
They have a 75% threshhold where only the WIDELY agreed upon content passes. LFG would never pass 75%.
---
No, that‚Äôs not exploiting but I am very surprised that doesn‚Äôt aggro them
---
Not at home so I can't test it but did you try
---
/console SET particleDensity "100"
---
It is not possible to use any sort of addon (or hack possibly) to reveal stealthed enemies. 
---
What the addons do is scan the combat log for "*X* has entered stealth" and report it to the player more visibly. As the other poster said this is not bannable at all, as the addon is merely parsing available info from the combat log
---
This is hilarious.
---
Also mining is a highly valuable use of time.
---
Funny story: While raiding back in Vanilla we had an awesome NE Hunter, think hes name was Cerebo or something like that. We did a full clear of MC and one of the bindings dropped, of which the MT didn't need as he had that one and good ol' Cerebo trolling the other warr's goes Hey TF is totally a Survival Hunter Melee weapon brahs. I've never heard so many people in unison fall for his troll. One of the Warriors even screamed, mainly due to knowing how much DKP Cerebo had, "If that little shit gets TF I'm fucking out." Cerebo laughed and told him to cool his jets.
---
It was hysterical.

It blows my mind that the reason they cited for not including Hyjal at release back in the day was that they thought they already had enough and almost too much content at 60 so they just held back on it for 6 years..
---
The 900th of the exact same post .. can we get a locked post that literally just says "rogues dont get locked items in dungeon/raid groups, so why would you?"
---
wow incredibly funny and witty! have fun wasting almost $200 a year on a 15 year old game hahaha
---
But are you a virgin?
---
I told my girlfriend I'm saving myself until I have all the gold for my epic mount.
---
Lol if you arent fully into that spec you will always be way under par. Its like an arms warrior tanking late game dungeons. Can he do it? Yes he can. Will it be more a hassle than a prot warrior for the healer? Yes.
---
Yesterday I hit a queue of 2 people on pagle.
---
If the warlock is inside the instance, they can only summon players inside the instance. (This can be useful to get players around trash respawns.)
---
But if the target is not inside the instance, the warlock needs to leave the instance in order to summon.
---
OSRS adding GE, godwars, etc completely disproves your comment lol. Like man this is such a stupid comment, OSRS revived jagex and if they took it in that direction they'd def add arena.
---
Nopeland BC arena was clearly the best.
---
BC raids were good too.
---
But flying and outlands sucks, Go classic + or let us stay on it don't force us into BC. I don't want heroic mode, I don't want dailies feeling like a chore.
---
We waited for Classic for 10 years let's not let people force us to play BC pls.
---
the tip.
---
Does killing people like this make you feel good? I could never wrap my head around people who do this nonsense. Don't get me wrong I live for pvp but this is just lame.
---
If you dont start all at the same time you will always lose to person who has been there longer to "roleplay loot"
---
Just translate your IRL rage into warrior rage. EZ
---
Get mats together for robe of the arch mage which releases with dire maul next week
---
&gt;Did they change these to holy damage in a patch or something?
---
Being holy damage or not is irrelevant when compared to a Warrior, as their Spell Damage scaling is more damage than the 1.45 multiplier for Defensive Stance. Presently in my medicore phase 1 tank gear I have 120 spell power and 170 in undead dungeons. I'm surprised this needs to be explained to you.
---
&gt;Add Force Reactive Disk, other engi items
---
Nobody is tanking dungeons with Force Reactive Disk. Even then, it is MASSIVELY superior on a Paladin due to *literally 100% on demand block uptime* by Redoubt sitting. I'll also add that nobody is wasting Sappers in dungeons, which is the only consumable engineering item that is realistically used for the purposes of threat generation on a regular basis.
---
&gt;To top all that off even if a paladin did do more AoE threat they simply can't survive the pulls a warrior can because they don't have the cooldowns.
---
What cooldowns do you think Warriors are using to survive pulls in dungeons? Last Stand? If you're overpulling in a dungeon Last Stand will not save you, because the sustained damage causing the healer to fall behind is the lethal mechanic. What will *actually* save you is a well timed Frost Nova + CoC from your mandatory Mage. Paladins can both dip out on that, and continue to maintain 80% of their threat and damage via consecration while out of melee.
---
Ok, how about Shield Wall? Well it's a 30 minute cooldown that you can use once per dungeon. Lol.
---
Hai, new player here. Are mounts available as super rare drop in raids or so?

But your top action bar shows everything unbound. Which is where the clicking assumption comes in. 
---
Unless you hid all your keybinds for just the top row. Keep clicking, don‚Äôt care. Was just trying to help. 
---
How many buttons does your mouse have?
---
Pretty sure we've got a Tolkien novel here.
---
Night fin...but I‚Äôve never heard about these elemetal pools in Azshara...ess of water goes for at least 14g each and this sounds like a pretty easy way to get them.
---
It really shouldn't. Even on a Normal server killing questgivers flags you for PvP.
---
Farm essence of water.  They are 15g a pop on my server right now.  Probably take two hours.
---
What happened to no changes :(
---
Idk how to even use Sniper lol. I guess Auctionator is what I'll try next
---
This. People will accumulate (or have accumulated) way more DKP than you‚Äôd ever hope to gain. You‚Äôll lose every roll weather they really need it or not because they have more points to spend.

Find a different guild.

* Not everyone knows the nuances of Reddit, particularly reporters who may not be regular users. 
---
* Mods set up Automod as a convenience tool but they are still expected to be responsible for mod actions, regardless if they were automated. 
---
* We‚Äôre talking *perception*, around an extremely sensitive topic and on a platform that is partially owned and controlled by the same Chinese corporation as Blizzard. Not a good time to be careless.

* Mods have undoubtedly seen the fact that the sticky is no longer visible and chosen to ignore it, so Automod is not an excuse.

very well then, coward

It's a super rare case but it is something that could happen. Getting mana drained by someone in world and managing to get enough space to mount to get away and not being able to is the only case I can remember running into.

Only one warlock in the group needs the items for the ritual in sure maul. It can be profitable for a warlock to hold onto the quest items and run groups of warlocks through the ritual

I completely forgot about this until you mentioned it. I remember being really excited to see what the hero classes would eventually be, and then so disappointed when they said they werent going to implement them.

 Nice Hunter weapon.

Or, maybe more accurately these days, Mage weapon.

---
...? That doesn't really change the argument that the direction of the game can be influenced by a large majority of players. Blizzard tried to do it themselves and they fucked up. OSRS tried it and it worked magnificently, roadmaps don't only work for specific games.

DKP stand for Dragon Kill Points (or some other variation of that) Essentially it depends on how your guild rewards these. Some guilds specifically stick to Raid DKP which means you get DKP points for showing up, for how long you stay, how many wipes your there for, how many bosses killed and so forth. 
---
Every Guild will structure these points differently. I've seen some Guilds that even reward DKP for out of Raid things like helping guildies donating to the guild for mats and such. But essentially lets say your BiS MC weapon drops. You can choose to use your DKP points to acquire that item. If you have say 145 DKP points and I have 135 DKP points it would go to you. Of course you "typically" use up your DKP points for that item. It honestly all depends on how your guild is structuring their Point system. 
---
Any good guild, worth their weight in salt, will explain their DKP in detail for you and I'd recommend asking one of the Officers of the guild for a conversation about how their doing their DKP. Hell my guild even has a Officer who specifically handles the DKP for the guild. Dude sat me down on Discord and told me all about how my guilds DKP was gonna work.
---
Phase 4.
---
\#Nochanges, huh?
---
And I agree with that. I'm not against this update because it is needed, all I was saying is I hope we dont speed through the updates at the pace of a large update every month or two. 
---
If you have a subscription you still have access to retail. If we slammed through update after update then after a year it's just gonna be another retail practically. I have coworkers that started the day classic dropped and still dont have lvl 60's. Infact my whole guild well over 100 strong on a PVP server only has about 5 lvl 60's and tons of them are on daily. I would say most of my guild is between the lvl 45-55 mark. 
---
We do need battlegrounds and some more stuff for max lvl characters to do it was just a surprise how fast this update was announced to all of my friends and my guild.
---
I just dont want it to become a serious habit of large updates and expansions making the majority of players left further and further behind because eventually content will become irrelevant for those who do want to be on the front lines but do wind up working allot of hours and have family's. I feel the morjority of classic players were vary young back in the day but now have careers and families and cant put in a solid 5 hours into the game a day like when we were kids.
---
Yes if you mean both me and my boss believe in basic human rights.
---
Right I know that part. It wasn't even what was in question. 
---
I hope maybe I can get some runs in selling at some point but I need to collect the other stuff first.
---
I laughed, not sure why no one else got you
---
Which robe?
---

---
Brrowyant!
---
So and when did they change the Burning Crusade bosses? And why can't they just take the already existing form of the Burning Crusade boss from the current game and use it? I don't remember the bosses having changed.
---
Good luck, if it's not taken lol. If it is then go on every realm to see if its available and reserve it now
---
Its an RPGMMO, dont feel like you HAVE to follow BiS lists. That shit is geared for simulations and hardcore guilds. For example...
---
Phase 1 preraid gear
---
Full plate+shield: +330 healing, 30mp5, 3.3k hp, 4.4k mana, 5.7k armor.
---
Cloth/leather/mail/plate/no shield: +580 healing, 11mp5, 2.8k hp, 4.1k mana, 1.9k armor.
---
I would go for full plate with shield and feel like a real paladin. Probably heal most content without an issue.
---
Obviously if you want to tank/heal go Warrior or Paladin.
---
Paladin might be the most fun to level because you can play all 3 specs, but then your options are limited at 60.
---
My opinion is level the Hunter first as it will be faster/easier.
---
How dumb do you have to be to be using a DKP system that doesn't have decay lmao.
---
I feel called out.

Just a minor correction. EQ Progression Servers had community voting before OSRS.
---
Except this exact topic has been the discussion of many posts since it has happened.
---
**The Good.**
---
Cuts down on some drama and favouritism caused by loot council.
---
Is more fair at times and gives more choice to players.
---
Rewards time put in by players. Encourages participation weekly. 
---
More even loot distribution if done properly. 
---
Less gear lost if someone stops playing or leaves the group.
---
**The Bad.**
---
Can set you back if you miss a raid. 
---
May take longer to get gear. Some groups run systems that only allow you to bid on another piece after everyone else has gotten one.
---
Discourages pugs and subs making groups harder to form.
---
**The Quirky.**
---
Players Hordeing (heh) DKP to save up for that one piece of gear they want meaning nobody bids/rolls on any gear.
---
May hold raid back in progression due to ungeared tanks/healers.

It's at the very beginning of this video, one of the first ones, right after he says "be good".  After listening to it over and over it sounds like he's saying "YOU THERE" but really fast and in a thick accents so it sounds like "YOUDAH"

Just a small correction: Stack size does impact the deposit cost. I believe stacks of less than 5 has higher deposit cost per unit.

---
I trust each individual to know what gear is best for them more than the loot council.  I've seen vanilla veterans streaming on twitch, using loot council making all sorts of mistakes and causing all sorts of arguments.  With dkp it's done, you pay the price and there are no arguments.  You don't even need loot rules, if you trust people are smart enough to know what are cost effective upgrades for them.
---
K said it best. 
---
A person is smart. People are dumb, panicky animals and you know it.
---
And?
---
Sometimes Exalted grinds are themselves the true reward.
---
Other people breaking rules does not give you the right to clog the sub with this bullshit. Suck a block.
---
The damage of the proc is unaffected. The damage of the judgement IS affected, but you'll find your mana last much longer when you're not constantly judging (It's about 200-300 mana per Judge and SoC Max Rank, you can only do it 5-6 times before going oom if you're casting on cooldown) Now for fast fights, use full rank to do as much damage as possible.
---
I just switched out of my full set last night, went from color matched to tekashi69. Feels bad
---
You still want to be hitcapped, just not raid boss hitcapped.
---
 No
---
Do you click silence and physic scream? Or do you have those keys re-mapped to your mouse. I can‚Äôt imagine clicking those important spells.
---
You also reduce the visibility by placing a higher bid (no longer 1c = no longer front page).
---
And could be Shackled by priests apparently.
---
You know they can find out what account you're playing from and ban you, because your acct details are embedded in screenshots, right?
---
You can‚Äôt rely on old servers with Any of the raids though, because the buff to Dire Bear came after those raids were released and killed
---
I though that the auctioneer wasn't working too, as the interface. I'm sorry but i don't know what it might cause that, maybe some lua error with elvui. It's best to ask the forums of those too addons. When i had the interface problem i just updated as i already said before. Sorry for that bro, I wish i could be more useful other than that.

There is a lot to love about this

That is a weird ass bug that has been there forever, like Vanilla, TBC, etc... (I didn't really play alliance much until late BC but remember this happening then.) I'm not sure why or how it happens.  It is not easily reproducible so not sure Blizzard knows how to fix.

sword spec with thrash blade is really fun.

I would just put points in whichever is lower, they become increasingly inefficient as the ranks increase.

Maybe you replied to the wrong person. I never said anything that could be interpreted as me feeling useless. As far as me caring, I didn't say I care, I said I'm playing Enh over Ele because I find it fun and if I couldn't for some reason play Enh, I would just play another class.

Nothing I said is contradictory, again, did you confuse me with someone else, or just confuse yourself?

This was 100 hours. Bloodsail is more like 2000-3000 hours if done at lvl 60
---
Take the stick out of your ass
---
Mages prefer other mages dawgg
---
It only takes one though. As long as there's one person dedicated to farming, there'll be one person with enough gold to radically shape the economy. You can pretty easily cause price inflations with 1k gold, simply by buying up the entire stock of an item, and gently raising the price, while sniping and flipping anyone who tries to undercut. DM's the kinda place where you can get like 600g per hour, so people will have the cash in order to make such increases.
---

Well shoot. Seems like a weird thing to add that late in classic. Good for some alts I guess

Did you forget to turn on the foreground layers before exporting? I don't want to come off as mean or overly critical, but for me the lines all draw the eye to the center and there isn't really anything there.

That was adorable.

It's a racist joke about slavery... its fucked up.
---
The same point applies. That depends entirely on your realm's economy.

You can go further than that.  I saw a post elsewhere encouraging going to the App Store and rating all their trashy companion apps 1 star.  Hope others follow suit.  
---
Anything we can do to let the execs at blizz know that for every dollar they earn pandering to authoritarian regimes they‚Äôll lose 2 in the developed world.
---
Except it does because it's going to affect the markets and the amount of gold players have.
---
It also makes it harder for players to find people for sub 60 dungeons or sub 60 grinding groups.
---
Had an Orc that had this and it proc'd on a Warlock. I legit watched the Gnome lock step away and just drain life the Orc. It was funny AF.
---
I see you found the video I uploaded.
---
/join LookingForGroup, you know, the actual official channel.
---
My child, your quest for gear has only just begun.
---
You need to be in the same instance as your target. If your target is in the overworld (ie. outside of a dungeon/raid), you also need to be in the overworld. If they're in an instance, you need to be in that specific instance to summon them.
---
It seems like you understand theory crafting, so I‚Äôm wondering why you haven‚Äôt figured this out.
---
...the basic hit mechanic that everyone needs to concern themselves with when  raiding is rather insignificant while leveling, especially when you‚Äôre attacking same level or 1 level lower mobs.  I mean basically everyone knows you need hit, but why would you concern yourself with that while leveling? How do players not understand hit rating by now.
---
I mean if you were level 60, and didn‚Äôt focus on hit rating for dual wield, then you probably bad.
---
Believed everyone thought at this level by now, this game has been out since 2004...

Worth the investment, more like 300g difference
---
Just level.
---
This whole thing is a demonstration of group mentality infected by ignorance.
---
Eh it's just kinda low effort and overdone at this point.
---
The gold thing should be pretty neutral. Prices will go up but that also means that leveling players will be able to get more for the gear and materials they find while leveling.
---
I'm not sure what the part about sub-60 dungeons is supposed to mean, though. I don't see any reason Dire Maul would impact that though.
---
Dam my char is 45 that is 1 char you have so many leveled have you interacted outside since release?
---
Well by then you're just saving your item.  I assume you'd just wait til there's  an hr left on the auction to buy yourself out.  Just as you'd wait that long to cancel.
---
If I wasn't in the #nochanges camp I'd say just remove auctions and make people list for a price.  Nobody uses auction for anything outside of putting their item on top.
---
The thing is, the economy shift actually helps lower level casual players. Right now gathering professions are in the toilet because everyone is trying to undercut each other to the bottom. Inflation would be good, because you'd be able to sell your gathered mats for significantly more money to high level players, and will be able to afford static costs like mounts much easier.
---
All remapped. I use a Logitech g600.

Throwing daggers. Best we can do.

Back in vanilla I got repeated bans for kiting Phantim (62 elite dragon) and a pack of 60-62 elite dragonkin into Org at the same time. I would kite them around the bank and tower a couple of times and then feign death, that was more than enough time for a few people to take some pot shots at them and all hell would break loose. I would tap one of them with a rank 1 arcane shot just to make sure that they would never lose aggro and reset. It was the most fun that I had in game.
---
If they will do something as stupid as forcing a gambling clear on you for no reason imagine the kind of asshatery they will pull in the actual raid itself? /gquit and find some place to play that is not run by a tyrannical child.
---
I hear it as 'hey there'
---
Cough poe cough
---
It was. I could t pass it up. Plus farming all that would have take. Forever
---
Can you check the vendor?  At one point a few other guildies and I put our twinks on follow as ghosts and had a very awesome guild member kill mobs until we hit honored, allowing us to buy the mace. Being a ghost allowed your to get rep without getting XP. Then we all got crusader and had some good times until they nerfed it by adding a lvl req.
---
I just dinged 40 on my hunter and got my mount, but now I'm flat-broke haha.  What's the best place to farm gold now that I'm level 40 with a mount?
---
Tbh, the main issue is the lack of searching tools in the standard UI.
---
His face looks like hes been hit with a frying pan

Problem with TSM is it doesn't let you see the market each item is being posted into. Let's say a whole page of item x is going for 1g ea, except one person has decided to sell his stock for 30s ea. As long as its above the minimum price TSM will undercut the 30s listing despite the fact that the 30s is an anomaly that will get bought out almost immediately returning the market to 1g again.
---
That‚Äôs actually pretty neat!
---
this is the reason i only use it on dungeons
---
I agree with you and wish Warrior had something cool, but at the same time am okay with it. The devs have always treated classes very thematically and as such, what cool perk would warrior really get and not be ridiculous? Using every weapon and being the best dps (in this phase) while being able to wear plate is pretty solid on its own.
---
My argument is based on the most common pvp experience that the majority of players will have and will continue to have until Phase 3
---
If we are talking about specifically min maxing for BG pvp then I guess you could say that shadowguard is better than DP; however in that niche scenario undead would be chosen anyways due to wotf. Undead Spriest is the best for pvp its not really up for debate its been settled since 2006

Agility, AP, Hit and Crit are king. Strength is equivalent to AP (1 Str = 1 AP), you need just as much Stamina so you don't die, every other point is basically worthless (in PvE! If you're on a PvP realm, keeping high Stam is a good idea), Spirit is neat the first 30 levels, but quickly falls off.

No one actually cares, no point in even making this post
---
I actually don‚Äôt like it because itemization feels rigid, and it never feels like you can formulate a unique endgame build. With randomized numbers, even if you follow a tree it really feels like your items set apart your character. It gives this weird feeling of ownership that I was never able to feel in WoW.
---
basically more expensive then regular mount with current arcanite prices :d
---
Whether or not you fee you need it isn‚Äôt the concern. It‚Äôs the expectation by others to do everything you can to contribute as fully as they do. Otherwise you‚Äôre half-adding it and just getting carried.

I avoided the streamer server. I don‚Äôt follow streamers or really pay attention to what they do. But others are free to play differently. And it sounds like those in his guild are willingly agreeing to his terms, so I see no issue.

It already made the difference between classes smaller all attributes simplified and just streamlined the first beautiful edges of the game away.  Just because it was a smaller mistake doesn't mean it wasn't a mistake

The one on the south was the largest group of them. I think they were lvl 39ish. There are also some lower level on the north mountains, and some higher level on the west mountains (IIRC)
---
Just keep questing and grinding, you'll start to gain your money slowly but surely.
---
The good news is the money starts becoming faster to farm after 40, the rate slightly goes up.
---
Also, be sure to go double gathering if you're looking to make more income.

My partner and I were just getting into the game for the first time together... I guess it's back to OSRS or something lol...

Be very careful using AutoHotKey for anything while running the WoW client.. It can be used for botting and the like, and is usually detected and you will be automatically banned. The client doesn't scan to make sure you're using the programs legally, they just scan to see if the programs are being run while the client is.

I don‚Äôt know but I know a few things about Americans. They can be quite efficient and competitive. I have worked with several of them and they are often workaholics. I think it‚Äôs part of their culture. They are expected to work a lot. 
---
I am not sure about American gamers though. Non of the guys I worked with has any time for games.

Please tell me what Warlock is in German

Oh that‚Äôs cute gl being the best healer in the game ur wind fury is nice but ur heals are shit
---
Dang, I thought it was going to be a photoshop of CCP
---
You can‚Äôt typically see the reserve price. But you can see something along the lines of the reserve being reached or not.
---
This is some massive projecting if I've ever seen so myself.
---
Wouldn't they lose the deposit anyway, assuming no one uses buyout or bids higher than you?
---
Now I actually pity them a bit :/
---
Thanks a ton!
---
All auctions tab
---
Thanks for the reply and video brotha.
---
This same argument popped up with osrs, that a lot of the changes people wanted. But whenever changes pop up that the community feels would go against OSRS they've voted it down.
---
There is sense in caring because I believe he's spreading lies to a large audience. His guildies can do whatever for all I care but the point is that Esfand uses them to make himself and his spec look better.

Ok, later gear gets you crit reliably without giving up ap

There have been several successful MMOs that didn't tie themselves to the loot progression concept.

"Better loot" isn't the only possible goal to new content.

Look up white knight idiot. Must hurt to be so stupid.

I didn't say it - I declared it.

They been tracking lottery numbers weekly for years, and there are still numbers that show up more or less often.

oh I hate that kind of shit, people need to stop pre-advertising for runs they aren't doing. That shit is fine in guild chat, but for pugs its a waste of time.

Getting your mount to yawn?

IMO if you're not having fun you should do something else.

Or considering the races... Shes you from the future, the gravestone was damaged and the accent over the letter was the result.

Shes come back to tell you something...

I do this about twice a day. It's easily reproducible. Just jump onto the tree straight outside of the door of the mage tower, sometimes you'll clip onto it. The trick is to try jump 'over' the tee, so you land on its highest point. If you land on it, you can then run (floating in the air, but running on your mount still) for ages before falling down. I have loads of screenshots of myself running through the air around the mage district, but am on mobile atm
---
Thank you, this is the best guide I've seen.
---
Yea I can understand that, if I see that I just move on.  But there was none of that lol, no debuffs, not targetting anyone, no action lol
---
I saw the mob but I was too low lvl to kill it :( was so sad
---
What‚Äôs your UI addon for the bars/char panel skin
---
Dude, he is memeing about ret being good, everyone knows it isnt good. Thats basically a walking meme. also about him being the best ret paladin in the world. don't take everything so seriously. Its all just meming, joking and playing around with all of it. The tone with which it all said is telling. Thats not some serious analitical talk...
---
About raid, ppl in the raid know what going on and agreed to join with such conditions, cos they are his fans. So its not dishonest or greedy or any of this, they all know and agreed on it, and probably happy to help esfand and see him do good. all ppl in the raid happy to do it. otherwise the wouldnt join the guild. its a streamer's fan guild, not a real guild.
---
Look up clueless idiot, hint: you are one.
---
That is hilarious. Also I like your name, Freedom!
---
Shift click, u monkey
---
This post made me crunge.
---
Pretty selfish if you ask me, you should also make some for your fellow raid members :P
---
If you‚Äôre 52 I‚Äôd personally start running early BRD, some really good pieces in there. But I think the 300 tailoring robe is BIS if you want to start working on that. You can drop tailoring after crafting it.
---
Thats fair if you think there are mistakes that were added. But its not fair to not point out also the TONS of great additions those expansions brought. Its not like they objectively only made the game worse, they also added so much amazing content and zones and gameplay.
---
Its not a great offhand. And mainhand (if you're alliance) deadmines drops a better mainhand wep if you can get it. Otherwise. 22 if you buy blues.
---
So? You can use basic game mechanics for any number of exploits. The guards are put there for an obvious reason to dissuade dickheads like you from ganking afks in a neutral quest hub. The fact that they react to pathing differently than faction specific guards is more than likely an oversight due to the way aggro works. If you want to gank lowbies, there are about a million places that you can do that without having to circumvent guards. 
---
Maybe the reasoning was thin, maybe the GM didn't know wtf he was talking about, but honestly you're not going to get any sympathy for being an asshole. I play on a PvP server, I gank lowbies if I think it would be fun or funny, but hanging around in a quest hub 20 levels lower than yourself, and still positioning yourself in such a way that there's no actual risk even from the guards? Hell, even if a 60 happens to be there he would have to know the same exploits to not be attacked by guards himself if he should retaliate. Yeah, that's absolutely "disruptive behaviour" and I'm glad you got banned, I sure as hell wouldn't want to play with you.
---
Yeah fuck that guy. I like having a rogue around. When rogues pull aggro they can handle a single mob long enough that it doesn‚Äôt become A Thing. Much nice than big dick mage who pulls way too much aggro and gives me a panic attack.
---
shud i be wearing this on my main hand?
---
This only worked if your guild was actually making progress and there was loot. If lets say you were spending the night basically throwing bodies at C;thun for 4 hours, this system wouldnt reward those people because loot wouldn't drop.  
---
That was the only flaw to a Zero Sum system which you could get around, by making a dummy "player" that took the negatives so that the ones that were there could get Positives, and then re-zero the raid by removing that negative character and redistributing the points across all people.
---
That said, the way people are blasting through Raids, the "progression raid" isn't really a thing anymore, so this system (which was my favorite system) is viable once again.
---
Melee (enhance) shaman can 1 shot you if their windfury procs (20% chance) other than that they suck.
---
Magic (elemental) shaman can also 1 shot you if their spells crit, a talent allows them to get guaranteed critical strike with 2 spells (if they cast chain lightning then shock straight away)...
---
I'm level 55 and i can hit for 2000 damage with that combo in 1 global cooldown, but if i cast lightning bolt before and it crits also then thats basically 3000 damage all at once.
---
But if you manage to counterspell an elemental shaman then they are as good as dead, 99% of their spells are nature so they are unable to cast anything worthwhile for a long time... They're screwed. 
---
Get the counterspell and you win.
---
Succubus offers highest DPS
---
Didn‚Äôt he actually give it to the warrior ?
---
You used layering whether you like it or not, heh.  It affected you whether you like it or not.
---
Some people do, this is why Youtube exists.
---
Isn't their guilds whole gimmick meme specs anyway?
---
They run ret pally, BM hunters, feral dps, and boomkin with shadowpriests just for the fun of it.
---
Let them do them.
---
Later zones could have a global debuff aura, reducing stats in some way, such as hit or crit.  Or perhaps some sort of continual damage aura that certain resist-based gear would help with.
---
You're absolutely right to feel that way, I'm levelling a Warrior, Mage and Druid simultaneously. Mage and Druid have so much ability to just dip out of any fight (including PvP fights...).
---
Warriors, it's fight or die. The closest they have is the AoE fear, and even that often makes things worse when those mobs pull another 10 from running all over the place.
---
But the pro is that Warriors are fantastic classes once they start gearing at 60.
---
that's probably how it's going to end up going. thanks for the advice.
---
That‚Äôs how it was in D2. PC looting was, fortunately, limited to HC mode (no res, once you‚Äôre dead, you‚Äôre dead), and IIRC might have been limited to people you said could loot it.   Gold though, whatever you didn‚Äôt lose to death would drop for anyone to pick up.
---
Your opinion doesnt matter. Continue to grief people and continue to get banned.
---
what server? asking for a friend? lmao
---
Neat! I thought about doing this myself but forgot about it lol
---
Grats!
---
I like the Bellular video in the corner.
---
I've got an ArthasHarlot
---
Except they didn't actully give it to a hunter. It was a bait, exhibit A is the OP
---
Plus MT already has Thunderfury
---
I think everyone has made the same obsevstion and just accepted it.
---
I'm glad it's a function; I accidentally bid 8g on something I did not need at all, sent a mail asking if he would cancel if I paid 2 x entry fees + tip. Ended up getting an answer, he cancelled, and I paid him 2g 20 silver.
---
I don‚Äôt know if it was there at launch, but the lua API still makes reference to it.
---
It really depends if you have Windfury or not.
---
I'm not sure what you mean when you are criticizing Flurry and Bloodthirst. They are the primary proponents of DW Fury.
---
no difference
---
Yep, 90!
---
60 is max level, but during your mid 50's you can start clearing some of the endgame dungeons in order to get yourself some gear that's good enough to take you through Molten Core (first 40 man raid).
---
If PvP is your thing I think Battlegrounds are being released during Classic Phase 2, which is supposed to release sometime this year.
---
Cause I haven't been playing the whole time, and cause I made 2 alts. I didn't mean it as *"I've been playing 1 character 10 hours a day for 42 days and I'm not 60"*, I meant it as *"I know 100% of classes, 95% of zones, 90% of quests, 100% of dungeons, I've been playing WoW for 13 years as well as hundreds of other games, have tons of time to spare, and as such I've got a significant familiarity with most game mechanics, and play more on the competitive side and I'm not 60"*.
---
It's just that I underestimated how long and boring leveling in vanilla would be so I wasn't mentally prepared for all the grind and had to take a break for 2 weeks to avoid burning out completely. And also I made 2 alts with 2 funnier/easier classes to level than priest (my main). Anyway the point is that I'm no casual and I'm still slow as fuck, so I imagine there's still a metric fuckton of people below 60. Probably most players, actually.
---
The bid shown next to an item is what the current bid is, not the amount you will pay.
---
To make a bid you have to make a minimum bid that is a certain percentage higher than the current bid.
---
You can see this by clicking on an item, and at the bottom of the ah window, right beside the bid and buyout buttons, there is a place to enter in a bid amount. This will automatically fill itself in with the minimum possible bid when you click on the item. You can manually enter a higher bid if you wish, but you can't enter a bid lower than that minimum.
---
Lol mods removing my post for being a ‚Äúbattlestation‚Äù K. Considering the crap that gets posted here this is pretty sad. What a power trip.
---
The reason I dont watch PvE streamers is.. I've seen them all be guilty of this. Then have someone say how great they are..
---
Where did he said that what he showing on the screen is your average ret gameplay, that every ret paladin should expect? 
---
First he never said it, or positioned his stream like that. Second, anyone with a half of the brain would figure out that having a pocket guild of fans feeding you everything in all ways, is not your "average ret gameplay or dps you should expect".
---
I remeber him even saying, when being asked, that he doesnt recomend playing ret, if you dont feel its your class and fantasy about the game. basically playing it for rp reason. As he said himself thats why he plays it. "a holy warrior", not because its actually a good spec.
---
You seriously assumed some ideas in your head, and then got upset about something you imagined to be the case when its not..
---
Once people start buying stuff in stacks, I‚Äôll stop posting in singles.
---
However years of experience from Retail and now Classic show that people still prefer 50 potions listed as singles compared to full stacks.
---
Okay, in Retail back when I played I posted in stacks of 5, was not gonna wait for 2500-5000 individual auctions.

TIL: Bis is Best in Slot (not spec like I assumed)

AHK will get you banned yo. There have already been dozens of people bitching about getting put in timeout for having it running on idle for their work PC let alone in actual use for the game.
---
The Battlenet Client is monitoring your computer for exactly this kind of automation and it will eventuality catch it.
---
Get your epic mount first. Then robe of the archmagi and cap of the scarlet savant if you're still a glutton for punishment.
---
Don't forget raids demand consumables and you'll want to get enchants for your gear. It all adds up.
---
People like this need to be brought into the limelight for all to see so we know who to avoid on a given server. They deserve the shit reputation for being shitty humans
---
Who the hell uses in-game screenshot functions anyway? Win+shift+s for life.
---
Oh, I'm not criticizing them.  I'm saying that they apply equally to DW and 2h.
---
I think.  I think I think.
---
The question is more: "Why is fury considered the *dual wield tree* when it only has one dual wield focused talent?"
---
Bummer, I figured they'd work considering the game is running on the modern client. Maybe they're turned off for classic as we didn't have the option to change it in vanilla.
---
All good.
---
Ya hit 60 yet?
---
NAAA rules that the auction house can void any sale.

And we don‚Äôt have to deal with the public as a dealer auction so I won‚Äôt have to have the public around me :)

Nah this is to small I like something in between this and jitterbug type sizing.

Gotta keep that Scarlet key on ya, never know when ya might do a random SM run!

Yo thats my guild your fightin there in southshore.

If it means anything, fury is also considered the best 2h tree. Nobody raids as arms and is more successful
---
Kill beasts in STV and Badlands while questing or just grinding if you're into that, vendor greys and crap greens, skin for heavy/thick leather, turn into barbaric shoulders/nightscape tunics and vendor. If you have cooking at a decent level(which I'd recommend as a hunter) then you can cook the meat and vendor that as well.

Even with the battle.net logged in? I would contact customer support.

I'd say group roll no matter what, if you feel the key is expensive to make it it's better to just not make it in the first place.

Did you really burn the games or just the boxes

why dont you post this in his subreddit? no one cares on this one

Same. I got a mooncloth bag recipe for only 25g on my server. So I've just been making those instead of the 14 slots. Mooncloth sells waaaay better too.
---
You generally want a slow main hand (higher attack speed number) and a fast offhand (lower number). Cruel blade is ok as both (if you get it) only because the attack power boost. This would make an ok offhand but i think cruel blade would still be better. Sword of corruption would be the closest thing i can think of that would be a step up from either of those weps but they are pretty pricy.

Classic gave me some of the most weird interactions I'd in a mmo... I can see I'm not alone lol

Your going to have to decide if you want to be heals or DPS. Spriest mostly only have 1 slot in raids. But if your healing you'll be wanted everywhere.

If you make it in at the last possible second the elevator will start dropping before your fully on it. The elevator falls faster than you do and you hit the bottom and die. Only happened to me once, was pretty funny though.
---
Hardcore players were upset that they were being "penalized" for playing too much, so blizzard reduced the base xp from kills and made rested give a bonus to xp instead. This made everyone happy...
---
He knows that, he said it was different not that it was better
---
Well I guess if you and your friend reroll, I have two less Horde to fight! So that helps
---
They also said no to classic until they said yes.
---
Long term?
---
Not even close to the scale OW is though.  Otherwise all addons would be not allowed as well.

How do you know its empty? Maybe he really did unsub...

Was there a market for all that thorium or did you vendor it? Can't remember how things were mining wise in the start of TBC.
---
femtroll simply looks like  the male skeleton being used as the placeholder.
---
It was a pleasure to battle you, comrade.
---
Nah.
---
Just an idea, but maybe reroll on a high pop server? I see tons of groups for all content levels arranging every day on EU Pyrewood Village, seems better in the long run. Other than that, just keep questing, if I can‚Äôt time a dungeon either I just quest on. The gear will be replaced anyway and you can quest/grind xp just as fast solo
---
yea. between the 5 mages last night, 1 piece of tier dropped and 2 other caster dps gear. we cleared up to majordomo ;/
---
think about it this way. dw is the better dps option due to the massively increased rage generation and the arms tree provides limited support for dwing. 
---
it's not so much that fury is the dw spec because it directly supports dw, more so that it's just superior than deep arms for dual wielding and vice versa for 2h.
---
Fuck Tsai, Fuck China, Free Hong Kong

OMG muh pixelz! :(

As a tailor/enchanter I'm torn. I would want to learn it so badly but knowing it goes for almost 300 on my server thats like a quarter of my epic mount. Gratz tho
---
Oh theres plenty of ways of getting gold, selling herbs/potions on the ah seeing as you have it, fishing can be decent. I made mine from vendoring food from cooking and leather mainly, grinded in stv for about 9 levels on raptors/tigers.
---
Just have everyone watch the same fatboss vid.
---
Something about aoe grinding and rolling on shit. I dunno seems like a crap meme at this point
---
Exactly what I thought of!
---
Ah ah you should have taken.a screenshot!
---
Cancelling an auction with a bid costs the seller 5% of the highest bid, so it's usually a really bad idea to do so.
---
Work for dungeons yeah, but not for quests that require you to talk to the bumfuckt edges of Azeroth.
---
I thought it would take longer than it did =P Turns out this game is more addicting than I  thought
---
Did he? Didn't see that mentioned
---
&gt;	This is the most first-world-problem
---
Stahp
---
Anticipation!  This is how it sort of looked in game, the general idea atleast. I did try a dragon in the distance but I failed miserably.
---
Wait is that what I think it is?
---
because of the #nochanges cultists
---
How do you get all those other values on your TSM mine only shows the market, regional and lowest price on my server.  Is it an option in the in game add on or the desktop app?
---
Back to the future 4: This time it's personal
---
Eh. Completely different game. While POE definitely has a problem of having too many bad items drop right now it's a pretty core draw of the game that it works the way it does
---
Titanforging can suck it though
---
You also pay the 5% ah fee when cancelling an auction with a bid, despite it not selling. Then you pay the 5% again when actually selling the item later. This is in addition to the lost deposit.
---
I started it on my level 40 rogue when I had 99 exalted reps and got as far as 7.5k in to revered. Then 2 new reps came out in BfA 8.2 so didn't need it for the 100 exalted reps achievement anymore.

this is NSFW?

Pft... those are rookie numbers. Lol

Did some feralas/hinterlands/tanaris/ZF/Mara until 52ish, did searing gorge/ungoro/felwood/western plaguelands and then started burning steppes/winterspring/eastern plaguelands/BRD around 55.
---
Kept questing/occasional dungeon and hit 60 in E Plaguelands last night.
---
People saying 'just aoe grind/grind BRD arena' are missing out on the flavor of the game.
---
That is some fuckin math right there
---
Take a hard look at your own lifestyle and then ask yourself who you are really supporting.
---
It‚Äôs for Strath Live, need the Scarlet Key to open the doors
---
Reroll to warlock if you want to DPS. You will be healing in end game content.
---
Being at 15% hp and casting hellfire or howl of terror as a hail mary play on a bad pull is one of my favorite parts of playing a warlock. If you want to live on the edge on a constant basis, warlock is the class for you.
---
3 shadowbolt crits in a row? Hell yeah I love those numbers and hell yeah I'll tank this raid mob. I even get +20% damage now from the improved shadowbolt debuff. I just need to go harder to kill it before it kills me.
---
The fights that are so long and chaotic that I've tapped myself to the point that I cannot tap anymore and will die to a single hit from anything while the healer is completely oom are the best kind of fights.
---
Not that I'm aware. It's not really a hit thing, given you are not attacking. I have been told you have a mandatory 1% or so chance to be resisted. To be honest I'd suggest that it's higher but I've never seen solid information/ nor do I know if anyone actually knows. Not sure what kind of sample size we have ever had.
---
Don‚Äôt rely on anybody in wow, if you get water or buffs from some one appreciate it but never rely on them. The only constant in this game is you.
---
Lol only normal fire protection potions

You are right i thought for a second it was a wintersaber.

What would the spell hit do for you?

I didn't know he had a subreddit
---
There's a fine line between rewarding regular attendees and running a system that joining late or missing the occasional raid means you'll be unable to afford anything good that you want until everyone else who wants it has it.
---
Why should that newbie join the month late guild compared to one where there's another system that gives them at least an RNG chance at getting loot sooner?
---
I remember during mc up til the first boss I would only make and hand out healthstones and drain souls. I forgot who I gave them to a fair amount of the time so it wasn‚Äôt always perfect but it worked. 
---
Was always jealous mages could preprep their hand outs.
---
I never knew MC gear had these designs. Do you have the T2 sets before they were resigned?
---
Really it‚Äôs more like this:
---
Dual wielding is better for sustained damage, 2h is better for burst. Fury has talents that make sustained damage much better, arms has talents that make burst better (and also make pvp better). Burst is better for pvp. 
---
Fury is the PVE spec, arms is the PVP, but usually people go 2h for pvp and dual wield for pve. 2h pve exists for horde, but you still go fury.
---
Mankrik's mistress?
---
Not all pvp is inter-faction
---
I mean, yes, but during the 4 years that i played back in the day more often than not the DKP systems i was subjected to playing under rewarded granting sidegrades and offspec gear to folks who were raiding 3-4 days a week over the folks with blues who genuinely need the upgrade.
---
I imagine that any guild that runs DKP for classic would have strict bidding requirements in regard to off set bids if they have any intent on improving the guild as a whole but in my former exp it rarely worked out that way.

It‚Äôs a long way off but that wand is also useful in AQ isn‚Äôt it ?
---
I vendor 90% of my greens, even blues sometimes if they‚Äôre not that great. Trying to sell them wastes too much time and deposit money. I only list popular stats like of the Monkey/Owl/Eagle and only higher level ones. If they still dont sell I vendor

Holy shit I thought I was the only one! Had this happen in retail since I started playing in legion

I mean, 10am is a reasonable hour to see people playing the game! Plenty of time to have slept the night, get out of bed, get cleaned up, have breakfast etc. before logging in.

Runs great on my MacBook Pro and iMac.  Runs surprisingly decent on MacBook Airs.

Once you get enough hit rating DW is objectively superior to 2h.  You can go 2h fury, it's definitely a thing (especially on horde with using windfury on a 2h is disgusting), however remember that dual wield provides you with SO MUCH MORE RAGE GENERATION that you can keep up your abilities all the god damn time.  For PvE content fury is better, especially since the final ability is a self buff versus the final ability of arms is a debuff, which are at a premium in raid content.  However in PvP mortal strike is absolutely disgusting and arms is definitely fantastic in PvP.

You can easily just ask a friend to reset by setting them as party leader, logging out, and having them reset the instance. Alternatively you can get into a party with your alt, log out for 2 minutes, and lead will be passed to your alt, which you can log in and reset with.

Besides shift+ clicking you can actually type the name and press a space instead of the special character

Obscure anime lmao Can't wait to see this guy get ripped apart

Just all roll need it's not hard.

I've never seen a warrior need on leather when there's a leather wearer there myself! Also as a rogue never been rejected because a warrior wanted to roll offspec against me :P
---
Do you by any chance have a Razor brand peripherals?  I had this all the time for years, until I read a fix on another similar post. It drove me crazy and made the game super frustrating. 
---
The fox:
---
Go into your task manager, process tab, and end the ‚Äúrazeringameengine‚Äù process.  That‚Äôs it. I never have that issue any more. 
---
Only downside is that you have to do it again if you restart your computer.  I usually forget until the first time it happens in game, then alt-tab out and fix it real quick.
---
You can see Ragnaros in the hole if you stand in it too!

Isnt power trading better for making money?

Oops I did about 24 hours without any ravenholdt rep. Did I need a trinket or soemthing to achieve rep drops?

Why can‚Äôt people just buy water and food before raiding?  Why do mages put up with this abuse?

There's no such thing as forced gambling lol. Gambling is against the TOS, period.

A large amount of them are idiots in game.

---
Nope. Threat meters only work if the whole group has the same one
---
More class books with higher ranks.
---
Higher tiers which only increase stats by +10, adding set bonuses which add onto spells, for example: mind blast now reduces threat on the target or Judging seal of righteousness now taunts.
---
I know it's been several hours but I had the same problem with the frames. Disable titan panel then move them and lock them then reenable them.
---
Oh most certainly, but it's also important to point out the potential flaws in these systems.
---
As other people have mentioned, there are versions of DKP that include decay. This means it's impossible to stack up points forever, and that you only need to be in X weeks before your max possible points will be even with everyone else.
---
In what way is Esfand is a noob? He leads a guild where they clear all the content. His guild includes a ret paladin (Esfand) and hunters who get Thunderfury. In what way is this noobish? 
---
Maybe you mean they are they losing to that little chart you downloaded online? 
---
If you do a push-up, and someone else does a one handed push-up, would you call them stupid because they didn‚Äôt know the easiest way to do a push-up?

Unsub and GDPR
---
Nice.
---
The oldest DKP systems are dead and gone and good riddance to them.
---
EPGP gives you the ability for arbitrary non-loot rewards while otherwise having the same integrity as a zero-sum system.
---
Don't accept any of the arbitrary DKP schemes we had in Vanilla. They were originally devised by teenagers, they're trash and anyone trying to revive that sort of thing doesn't have fairness or your best interests in mind.
---
I was looking through gear on Atlas loot and I did notice that the cool glowey weapons were not nearly as cool and glowey, either. Like the dagger off princess theadras barely has its purple shine
---
No no you need to turn in the heavy junk boxes at the rave holder manor in alterac
---
Is he asmon 2.0?
---
Not sure if it's true for classic, but my retail farming place for silver was Alterac. Circle around the ogres and yeti, and drop into their caves. (Not the elites inside the walls, the regular dudes outside the walls.)
---
500 DKP MINUS!!!!
---
Glad you brought awareness to this lol. I‚Äôm a ret paladin and I‚Äôve seen him on the meters as one of the top performing ret paladin dps. This shines some light into how he‚Äôs doing it. I can‚Äôt blame him though, as a streamer he wants to make badass YouTube videos showcasing his amazing gear that will take an average ret months and months to get. I feel like it‚Äôs his way of keeping the ret hype/viewers up.
---
Why would that be mutually exclusive? If you want to rationalize continuing to support it because everyone else is a hypocrite then at least acknowledge what you‚Äôre choosing.
---
I went here with the intent to post "Never tell me the odds" but then you actually explained the odds with math instead guessing. So actually, thanks for telling us the odds.
---
Don't forget Grim Batol, updated class books, and maybe 41 point talent trees.
---

---
I use the one built into Details! and it it seems like most of the people I play with also use it
---
I dont think actually tanking will be hard, Ive already done most of it in vanilla. My bigger issue is actually doing it when I cant be consistent with a raid schedule and when I cant really raid more than once or twice a week.
---
May be just me, but if I were trying to lie about how good my spec is, I wouldn't have a DPS meter front-and-center in every encounter.  And I probably also wouldn't constantly tell people how sub-par my spec is and how I'm only playing it because I enjoy the class fantasy.
---
I like this, but nothing more than that
---
sure ya did
---
Why leave now? Youve already stuck it out through all the crazy queues?

Nobody said DKP meant the worst system there is. A DKP system has rules and many are unique. Blanketly saying DKP systems are bad is an issue. We use zero-sum DKP and Suicide Kill point system. The major upgrades people long for are going to cost them. They should be able to wait for them and stack SK.
---
Good old BC tank goggles from engineering. Sported those bad boys everywhere on my Human Warrior.
---
Not disproportionately to their attendance advantage.
---
Which in my experience was something *EVERY* shitty guild tried to do. It's really just a scam to funnel more gear to their core and officers than they deserve.
---

---
Pre-patch had 41 point talents..
---
I tried it but I tested it with my wifes character and it didnt show her threat, I just learned that everyone has to have the same meter for them to show everyone's threat so I'll probably just stick with it since it seems to be the most popular on curse
---
Neither of them have black hair either. Disgusting.

I plan to keep playing on my PvE server on my warrior since I love it.  But I‚Äôm curious about PvP experience :
---
Fellow warriors, how has wPvP affected your play experience?  What are your frustrations and successes?  How have they balanced out?
---
I said a lot of not everything... but reading comprehension is hard
---
Doesn't increase 'spell damage', but it increases spell dps
---
this would only be possible on a server with an extremely low number of people, like less than 300 online per faction at a time or something. any more than that &amp; u'd need infinitely more than 1k gold to inflate prices on anything for more than a few hours
---
These are so awesome

I see decked out people full bis and raid bis and hear I am spending a week trying to get one bis no dice.

No they are not. You get the triple windfury crit like once every BG and feel like a God. All the other time you're running up to someone hoping to get one swing in before your life bar empties. Don't get fooled by the videos like unbreakable's. Obviously they're just the best bits of dozens of hours of play. The reality is much  more grim.

You ever run past someone and say "Hah, cool name" and then see a special character, and it turns to "Aww, that's a shame"

Your Wikipedia definition written by a wiki-neckbeard isn't gonna do. Let's go with Merriam Webster which is the dictionary in which the most people place the most trust in. 
---
Definition of¬†authoritarian
---
1:¬†of, relating to, or favoring blind submission to authority
---
2:¬†of, relating to, or favoring a concentration of power in a leader or an elite not constitutionally responsible to the people
---
I'd argue that America is described well in both definitions. The majority of this country blindly submits to their authoritarian government no matter what they do. As for the second definition, there is an elite class of people that control our country and government. They are *not* held responsible for anything, constitution or not. I support I constitution, unfortunately, it has become bother other than a piece of paper in this day and age. The only thing that will ever stop this melting of our rights is if the people forget what causes their division for a moment and they rise up against their oppressors as we did in the late 1700s.

Well, yes it does! I just edited it, thanks :)

How did u get actionbar like that?

Still better than asmon posts.

18?!? Wow.

Done well over 50 runs though for cash :)

How is my champion supposed to arise to this!?

lmao this is where you draw the line with Lorebreaking loot? Not that half the classes can have the SINGULAR Atiesh?

Or that Onyxia's singular head can somehow be put on a pike in the main city every 2 hours?

There are many pre-raid BiS BoE green "of Frozen Wrath" items.

You‚Äôll always have to press twice. I use Leatrix to auto dismount on spells, eliminates the need for macros

Better to just put the first one back up on the AH, and then pull the second on out and equip it.

This system too heavily rewards people for coasting through MC and saving up points, then buying all the best gear when the new dungeons were released.
---
Yeah, I was at 1k needles yesterday too
---
Fury is the dual wield tree because Prot isn't damage boosting, and Arms talents so heavily favor slow 2H, that you essentially have to go down Fury to get talents that aren't "wasted" by dual wielding.
---
This. Adding +5 stats on each tier would not break the game. TBC blew things up by going from +48 stamina on T3 warriors to +78 stamina at the end of TBC. Wrath really pumped up the stats.
---
Never heard of the guy.

I don't use aux specifically because of the interface. It's just ugly af, really wish they would skin it blizz style

Why would it happen to WoW?

What most people seem to forget is that the tournament was hosted by Blizzard. The casters were paid by Blizzard, and hired to do one job. Blizzard has no affiliation with what is happening in Hong Kong, so naturally, as a public figure of the tournament, starting to voice his own political opinions is absolutely unproffesional. The tournament was not called "Heartstone for Hong Kong", so as a caster, keep it to yourself.
---
I completely agree with Blizzards decision.
---
Man, I wish I recorded it but my last DM run we had 
---
3 pierces of defias set drop
---
Rockslicer dropped
---
One rare boe set of cloth int gloves(winning roller sold them for 30g on AH)
---
Lavishly jeweled ring dropped
---
Smites hammer dropped
---
Cruel barb dropped
---
Cookie wand dropped
---
Taskmaster axe dropped
---
Ember stone staff dropped
---
Was the most nuts run of all time
---
So you're saying, I can now farm something to tank as a rogue?
---
Took the same screenshot in the same spot with mine haha.
---
Lol sit macro doesn‚Äôt really work in classic, and hamstring kiting doesn‚Äôt work nearly as well because of leeway.
---
Classic +, no expansions, no extra levels, no BC, just parches with content. Sure new zones and stuff but keep the feeling of progression in the game without doing full gear resets every 1.5 years.
