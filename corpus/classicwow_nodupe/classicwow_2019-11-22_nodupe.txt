Dude you have time to spam the same reply 14 times but where are people supposed to be reading your explanation of why this should qualify as an exploit? You still haven't given one. Also what about when you bring in a lock, and summon the payer past the mobs to mizzle / the chest? Is summoning a bannable exploit too in your universe?
---
---
---
It even specifies that this is Classic DKP.
---
It shouldn’t break it. They said in the blue post 50 yards was the intended range like in vanilla, it just means recount will work like it did in vanilla
---
What's their gain from said "exploit"?
---
yeah,someone also mentioned its the log itself...raid addons are 50 yard fixed now...good thing alot of things in pve dont have rogue stealth,so the distance wont be that big of a factor.
---
&gt; Damage meters will no longer be accurate for party/raid members 
---

---
who gives a shit
---
You know it
---
Same for Herod, most people are prebis so golds the only reason to login and you can’t do anything in the world rn. I’m logged into mara to fish nightfins but thats it. No reason to play outside of raiding rn, horde make it horrible
---
Pretty much mirrors my guild's experience lol
---
Yep in those 50 runs I only saw the pants twice
---
What other professions do you gice these guys, tailoring for mooncloth cd?
---
You make it sound like the logs are never received by the client after this change,  all they are doing is changing what is displayed to the user by the log and that can be modified to be anything at anytime.
---
It wouldnt be hard to limit the filter to non-party/raid member, non-faction players at 50+ yard.
---
I sit in IF as a horde rogue and distract people down there.
---
Yeah even I was on the OP side for a bit but it definitely looks like hes basically raidlogging while the other guy was making sure to be best equipped for dps in the raid fight which in this case looks like Ragnaros. If the OP was putting out 15% parses while the other guy doing 60%+, who is the raid most worried about losing? 
---
Sure the raid should have made their loot rules more transparent but if the OP wants to leave to another guild that raidlogs like him, hes free to do so. Just dont be surprised that everyone is greens because they do try to grind for preraid bis cant kill rag like his current guild can.
---
You can still wear it
---
Fucking hell lol
---
Winterblades plays WoW? Anyone know if they're the same Winerblades from Shadowbane?
---
yeah rag and ony were pretty much mentioned to be effected 100%.
---
Ive done that plenty saved quite a few lowbies in badlands from the pathing ogres even after honor. But ive also drained an ally paladin of his mana and then curse of recklessness the elite mob he was fighting....
---
Faction imbalance on some servers is just so bad, really didnt want to give up on my character but i stopped playing
---
So its broken then.
---
On rag if you're south side ranged you're more then 50 yards away from north spread ranged.
---
This literally broke recount/details
---
No, that's using game mechanics as intended.  This is not.  Your false analogy is shit.
---
Or its not.
---
They can just filter out opposition faction data at a range of 50 yards.
---
I might have exaggerated it a bit but basically yes, he could only go as far as his corpse allowed him to.
---
Balanced because it needs a reagent to work.
---
best healers in the game in both pve (highest throughput marginally above priests) and PvP when geared properly
---
Wow! That actually makes mage very appealing - being able to farm gold while leveling will be really nice while I wait for groups on my main.
---
If anything this is an improvement, because now Spy will be consistant. You won't have targets show up that you cant click or see. So when the stealth tag pops, you know its actually near you.    
---
   
---
This makes Spy better, thank you.
---
Sure, but theres lots of fights where people move more than 50 yards apart, twin emps, huhuran, sapphiron, etc
---
if a rogue sneaks up on you,good luck trying to get away.......after that very first stun you are 100% fucked completely
---
Can you show proof of this? I’ll need to see it to believe it’s not working.
---
15 years for Truestrike Shoulders, I suddenly don't feel so bad.
---
Pretty much everyone except for the council were on the shadow priest's side and were yelling at them through chat but he maybe went a bit overboard shouting at discord so eh... we all have jobs so not really much time to go looking for convenient guilds timewise.
---
Oh goodness, prepare to meet King Magni soon.
---
Your lack of understanding of how logging works is amazing.
---
Weapons: Double deadmines
---
Depends on your guild... find one that raids on the weekends.  Aside from that I am just striving to clear my map of potential quests so that takes a bit of time as you are dealing with multiple instance runs.
---
Oh wow, that seems like a pretty good drop rate. Why do they sell for so much if they aren't too difficult to get?
---
And the cycle of hatred continues
---
&gt; This is closer to the original behavior of WoW 1.12, 
---
seems like #NoChanges to me
---
So this is what the alliance does when they're not counting nelf flips.
---
Because as soon as we or druids stealth the addon will notice and everyone get alerts on the middle of their screen that we just stealthed in the proximity. Completely removes any element of surprise. People defending the addon is pathetic.
---
Just did it on my shaman and I gotta say it wasn't as bad as doing the lvl20 paladin quest for the hammer. Though that quest was just for gear, water totem is an essential part of the shaman class.
---
Looks like its time to roll Horde on Skeram to even things out.
---
I use an addon, so no.
---
Regnerus does not care about ranged threat he only carries if there's somebody close enough for him to whack on. Magmadar would be one that came to my mind and onyxia obviously
---
Honestly just calling it how it is lol, everything I said previously is facts. If you cry about dying on a pvp server, play pve, an alliance dominated pvp server, or play the safe retail version of wow. Not hard.
---
Your lack of understanding the difference between the combat log and out of game text logs is astounding.
---
Alliance succubus quest is a joy too. Walk all around the barrons and hope not to get corpse camped.
---
[removed]
---
The buyer doesn’t just walk in. The seller needs to get him to the end, it’s obvious you haven’t seen or done this. A lot of mobs aren’t hostile but you still have to kill eyes and get past multiple pods of hostile mobs. It requires a invis potion for non stealth classes
---
"Wait, you're leaving? Fight me, you coward! Watch, I'll stun you for 6 seconds! And... okay, so I didn't procc anything, but that stun had to make you really angry! Just... damn it."
---
Source: I am that Paladin.
---
What professions are you?
---
Aaaand, we're back to BC, where arenas and pvp crybabies started the chain of nerfs to pve.  Fucking knew it wouldn't last.
---
Does that exist in classic? I havent played since phase 2
---
yes, everything is blizzards fault, i dont blame ppl that left. having fucking 4 NA east coast severs ate reservation was the start of the shitshow
---
Starting fresh in a server is also OK for gearing priest?
---
The game has all the data,  the logs have all the data.
---
Placing a filter on the visible logs will not affect anything.
---
BRE isn't that amazing in current content I hear, because bosses don't have enough armor (normal armor debuffs already reduce them to pretty much zero).
---
Honestly wouldnt mind seeing the warcraftlogs and OPs gear.
---
No BRM guild rival skirmishes on the way to raids... would make me sad. That's one of the greatest parts of raiding right now
---
12 corpse runs to get into DM for me.
---
Their auctions show up first if filtered by bid price
---
Classic at 60 is raiding until you are completely BiS until the next new content arrives.
---
If it wouldn't be hard they would have done it. Clearly they don't want to waste the resources developing that feature and have gone for the easy lazy solution.
---
Dungeongroups below BRD are rare due to lack of ppl twinking. And for higher dungeons, groups mostly want lvl 60 only, because its faster. Thats at least my experience. Sitting at lvl 51 for the next 3 weeks i guess
---
Even if you don't get interrupted, it's not as if missing 2-4 frostbolts is going to leave others doing half the damage you do.
---
And if a mage can't ice block or blink to save themself, thats also a problem
---
I like to gank alliance lowbies because they’re 10x more likely to post salty shit like this
---
Alright so locks can sell tribute loot no problem that doesn't bother you, but hunters should be banned for it because it's not as hard as you think it should be for them to do it.
---
Whatever man I see that this is very important to you, way to pick your battles and focus on the important stuff lol...
---
Raid logging uses an external log file. Recount/details use the combat log.
---
I can’t tell what’s worse; the mages that think like this, the hunters that fall victim to them and post stuff like this, or the fact that I will never have a post with 7k upvotes.
---
I'm primarily tanking, which cloak enchant is better? +3 agility or +70 armor?
---
You have the burden of proof. Provide actual documentation from back in the Vanilla days, or a video from back then, which proves your point. Something more substantive than "no u."
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
 The burden of proof is the obligation on a party in a dispute to provide **sufficient** [**warrant**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_(philosophy)) **for their position**. 
---
 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden\_of\_proof\_(philosophy)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(philosophy))
---
All my friends between level 45-60 have quit the game since p2 came.
---
Boooorrrrinnnnggggg
---
And the horde still won...
---
They're using the double stack strat which is a problem since when one gets knocked back half their ranged get knocked back with them
---
You said still got rolled though. That statement can only insinuate you fully believe alliance even stood a change. What is it 15-28 vs 40+ ?  "Still got rolled though" lol
---
I agree, but the same players after 4 MCs can be at the bottom every time
---
Tried to be edgy and failed.  How embarrassing.
---
Lmao PERMA BANNED OVER 1 COMMENT.
---
Can't trade world boss loot
---
NOOOOOOOOO.... no more mind vision + spy .... :(
---
Couldn't you get them to craft the hammer for you, to save one ingot?
---
Nope. Dungeons only
---
This is a good primer on it
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-pvp-system-overview
---
Whats that got to do with the nerf to spy?
---
don't do the grouping/stacking as suggested earlier, our guild was having trouble on rag until we made sure to utilize all the space /range 10   
---
[https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/626940307996540928/640072339463340032/unknown.png?width=469&amp;height=469](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/626940307996540928/640072339463340032/unknown.png?width=469&amp;height=469)  
---
this is the reference picture we used for our first pre-submerge kill (we didn't to the healers on the very outside bits tho, seemed unnecessary)  
---
raid pre-pots with GFFP 
---
ranged dps should know that they don't have to worry about aggro at all and should just go balls to the walls the second the fight starts, no reason for mage downtime between mana ruby + major mana  
---
with dbm your melee should easily be able to time the in+out dance, and if you have any enh shamans they can't dps on this fight at all (you probably already knew that part) no mana users can be in the melee area or it screws them over (important: if a mana user gets knocked into the melee they need to get the fuck out asap, dont even stop to do a single cast, just start swim+jumping back to the outside)  
---
make sure the raid knows all the ramps out of the lava so they don't waste too much time swimming around
---
By the numbers I see horde won and your raid is dead. Fun ro watch but you didn't win
---
So why does it require an invis potion?
---
And muted for 72 hours so I can't ask for a different mod to view this ridiculousness
---
That's not his point. His point is why is he clicking, instead of having it keybound?
---
"I can't outsmart these people that outsmart me. blizzard, please fix so that I don't have to suffer at the hands of more skilled players"
---
Also, an exploit is something that is NOT intended to be done by the devs. 
---
Wow's been out for more than a decade. 
---
Do you REALLY think this would NOT have been patched if the functionality was NOT intended? Do you really think you're the VERY FIRST "victim" of that?
---
There is no exploit; you're just mad you didn't get your way, and your upcoming reply accusing me of doing that will drive that point home.
---
it will on some fights, others not much.
---
Holy crap they do listen.
---
+50 is a lot.  
---
Moving from 100 to 150 FR is big decrease in damage taken.  
---
The only formula I could find is: 
---
    Soaked damage per HP point = 1 / (1 - (resistance / (5 * caster level)) * 0.75) - 1
---
Apparently the other guy isnt allowed to get a piece because he has preraid bis. Might as well enter the raid in whites and get priority all the time.
---
Agree. We didn't have those mods when killing rag the first time around, and it was fine.
---
You're a bit late.  This is the 6th "patch" since launch.
---
The recipe isn't any more difficult to get than some other random drop world epic. People that have it just got lucky. The helm isn't expensive to the person making it. All he's doing is saying he will craft it if you provide the mats for free. What kind of loser do you have to be to get mad at something like that
---
"This fix does not affect text logs that the game outputs for raid parses."
---
This is in the post, though?
---
Not the exact person you replied too but i actually have only seen a handful of solo rogues trying. We did have a mage and hunter just post up near some huts and be annoying though
---
Wtf gross
---
The 19 bracket belongs to rogues due to their power at that range. 
---
For any other group, go forward to another tier.  109% accur rat.
---
oh there’s a combat log for enemies going into stealth? wtf lol
---
Lol, I suggest you re read your line of arguments here
---
Why does being dead prevent you from gaining honor. It's so stupid that leading the charge usually fucks your honor gain if you're not a mage with iceblock (or somehow didn't get focused like this guy).
---
Just because you're a selfish prick doesn't mean that other peoples' opinions cease to matter
---
&gt;your upcoming reply accusing me of doing that will drive that point home.
---
Guilty conciousnes, eh?
---
So you think the dev's had the idea to have a bidding system for the sole purpose of making sure your shit was listed at the top, not to actually be bid on?
---
Yeah.... Arcane shot shouldnt be anywhere in there unless its like a single shot because you know you cant fit in another Aimed shot.
---
That's what we did back then too. People were more chill about account sharing (most likely cause most people did it as well?), so nobody got into trouble really, as long as you didn't advertise it too much
---
[This is what I get when I put in my stats and talents.](https://imgur.com/jXO43Js)
---
Double stack refers to having pairs of people on top of each other because there’s only so much space around rag. It means two people get hit with each fireball not half. But still I don’t think it’s optimal just spreading out solo is fine
---
Rank 6.
---
The mobs do attack anyone who comes into the instance after.  They just have to sneak by to the end.  What the instance seller has done is cleared a safe path for them to the end.
---
Oh I'm sure there was tons of fapping.
---
Auctioneer and Tradeskillmaster are the best.
---
So I would assume my talent build would have to 11/31/9.  I've also seen 20/30/0 but I've read that that's less effective.
---
It’s called auctioning and that’s how it’s supposed to work.
---
You fuck up, you pay the price.
---
Yeah 58 to 60 weren't that bad, mostly dungeons and handing in left over quests. P2 came out when I was 58 which made it slower but a few dungeons and done. Helps that you probably will have more rested due to not playing as much.
---
Srs, how often have you ran UBRS that you even seen the MH 7 times?!
---
Can’t you just die once and then death run into the instance and be rezzed?
---
My guild raids Sunday mornings, and we can do both MC + Ony in 2.5 hours (with 2-20+ man groups for Ony). As more raid content comes out I expect we'll be raiding at least 2 or 3 days per week, but for now, you can definitely get pretty geared raiding once a week if that's all the time you have.
---
Yeah 19 rogues were definitely fun, most popular of the attempted twinks probably, but priest is definitely the best 19 twink.
---
Which file in details needs to be edited?
---
Nobody is dead, everyone has infinite respawns. Honor is all that matters.
---
Okay but beyond being a rogue.
---
I killed a Hunter at the quest giver that gives you the scarlet disguise after he got the disguise. Then... I did it again... then, this is where I really should have apologized to him... I went up to the keep inside hearthglen and just WAITED. Killed him at the entrance.  Now I know that was calculated douchery. But it also helped an ally Druid in the process.
---
Congratz on having a full aggro drop? You may be surprised to learn that every other relevant dps doesnt have that option.
---
Im only interested in PvE so I guess just wear all cloth armor then or whatever has the highest intellect?
---
All the gamers got their wish. Honor released a little bit before everyone's 90 day subs were set to expire, and a ton of us quit. Congrats horde. Now you have nobody to okay against. Your toxic playstyles have turned several servers into ghost towns and killed interest in the game right after it win a major award that should be increasing the amount of attention it received 
---
It's like going to a Smash Bros or Mtg event. The gamers make the whole place stink like shit so only noseblind losers want to participate. Everyone else is too put off by how disgusting they are to stick around. Then they pay each other on the (acne covered) back for showing those normies they don't belong. 
---
We thought we wanted this, but then we remembered that MMOs are always dominated by the people with the least social skills and responsibilities.
---
That seems correct from what I've seen!
---
The only thing I'm uncertain on: Do Azuregos and Kazzak each have their own spawn window? Or do they share it so only one can spawn within the window?
---
I died 21 times today on that route. So not the case.
---
Don't worry, as a horde you could have the same experience on most PVP servers.
---
They should also get a auto ranged attack timer either from an addon or a weakaura.
---
So why does the buyer need to use an invis pot?
---

---
Exactly.  Use it in raids if the dps works out regardless of procs
---
It isn't too bad for PVP. Soullink is better for 1v1, but SL is significantly slower for grinding and leveling. It really comes down to what you want though.
---
Yeah we've been standing outside UC entrance and everybody coming out "teleported" a bit. Fighting on zone borders is pretty awful for melee.
---
Ah I see.  They did mention earlier that they're having 3+ healers knocked back hence my confusion
---
tbh it's like saying mage is trash dps compared to warrior dps. It's not that mage dps is bad, it's that warrior dps is absurd. Kinda the same with bear vs warrior tanks.
---
This also breaks threat meters, have fun on ony p2&gt;p3 transition now, because nobodys threat meters are going to be accurate and thus nobody knows what there actuall threat is relative to the tanks.
---
So no argument against the suggestion itself, just against any change at all. People seem to have been quite fine playing with layering and entering MC with talents and gear that made it trivial compared to initial vanilla, but remote signup for BGs would be too much.
---
Ok got it. My first thought was ony/rag or Domo since you're usually pretty spread for these fights. Sounds like they won't work anymore.
---
Thats how you see it but its most certainly not what implied
---
I do use a damage meter, I'm not doing the best dps in the raid but consistently top 5 on boss fights. Why would I use a threat meter when I'm not overaggroing? Seems like a waste of screen space to me.
---
Yes I probably could increase my dps by some percent using a meter and keeping myself just below overaggro but I don't see the need to since I'm still pulling my weight without it.
---
I'm not saying that it's wrong to use a threat meter all I'm saying is that it's more than possible to perform well without them.
---
The way you describe it, reading the combat log, is how I remember the similar addon VanasKOS working in TBC (I’m not sure if it was also around in Vanilla). 
---
But as far as I can tell, Spy also flags people who haven’t performed any actions that would appear in the combat log. Even people just running past on their mount or flying over on a gryphon show up in Spy. 
---
Unless I’m wrong and people doing absolutely nothing also appear in the combat log?
---
Damn, my highest was 98. Grats, OP!
---
You can also hit jump FIRST before pressing forward and your character will move forward extremely slow and fall straight down.
---
You need to read more carefully. Premade twink groups v premade twink groups are absolutely the closest to balanced fights in the game. 
---
I know no premade group that wants to go in just to dominate a bunch of -1s- and except maybe in the 19 bracket where twinks are a dime a dozen.
---
&gt;with more people running dungeons because questing is not feasible.
---
It takes 45 mins to get to BRD. People are quitting dude. 
---
Even the higher pop servers are dead on alliance side. There used to be groups going all the time. Nobody is even online anymore. My guild and friends list are dead.
---
Dont even need a guide to see whats best to use, just a quick browse through warcraftlogs should clue you in.
---
I have zero sympathy for horde at flightpaths in the first place. 
---
Sorry let me rephrase this to something you horde can interpret. 
---
"You should of rolled on a PVE server"
---
Or 
---
"Sounds like pvp happened on a pvp server "
---
And the time less classic 
---
"Git good scrub zig zug"
---
No because you dont kite a war/rogue, you cc 1 kill the other. You have fear and the pets to help you out. Youd use vw in that scenario for the extra 2k hp and you also have hs which is basically a pot, on top of using a pot.  
---
  
---
But a 55 killing a 60 is going to take some amount of skill. Rogue shouldve immediately just vanished, wait for the warrior then fight. Losing a 2v1 demands a huge misplay.
---
Do you understand it is 50k per year?
---
It is like.. 4200 per month. So it is not that much? You don't eat, don't pay a rent and shit?
---
Sigh I feel I fell for this trolling but not sure enough since you sound american.
---
This exactly
---
Use an action add-on...that will bypass their stupid bid prices making them first on the list. Also just bid on every single one they post. Then they will have to manually cancel each one of them costing them money and time.
---
It makes sense what you are saying, but It's your word against mine. There's no proof that this is how it works for damage meters. I have no idea if you're just pulling this out of your ass, or if you there is actually evidence that damage meters are no longer working. If you can show me the proof, then I will believe you.
---
You cannot sneak to the end without stealth...
---
Fuck them , nochanges....unless idiots bitch about it, then changes.
---
Not like this is how they fucking ruined vanilla or anything...not EXACTLY like how they did it.
---
Blizzard, do you ever fucking learn from your mistakes?
---
ITT: People pretending to know which addons parse what data and how easy things are for Blizzard devs to code if they'd just listen to people who know nothing about how the game engine is designed.
---
Permabanned? The post says it's for one day. What else did you say to the mod to get yourself permabanned?
---
It seems if you're a ranged DPS or healer you can pretty easily find MC/Ony pugs.  You're hit and miss if melee DPS and pretty much locked out if you're a tank.  If you're not interested in raiding there is always the pre-bis grind you can engage in.  It takes a while if you're playing pretty casually.
---
Sure, but once you’re in you can stay there without zoning out again.  Unless you’re so quick you’re running into instance limits, you can level indefinitely without being molested!
---
To reset without zoning out, have one of your party log off and get on an alt.  Kick him from group, invite his alt and give him party lead (he can be anywhere in the world for this, so sitting safely in IF works).  Have the rest of your group log off.  Once everyone is off and only the alt is online, he can reset the dungeon.  Then the rest of you log back on and you’ll be at the beginning of a fresh instance.  The alt passes party lead, drops group, and he logs back over and you invite him back to group.  Bit of a hoop to jump through, but sure beats the hell out of zoning out!
---
Wow, talk about a blatant lie. Shazzrah is HEAVILY Horde skewed. Maybe pick another server, OP.
---
For a lot of Addons
---
Ahhhahahahahahaha... this guy's anger makes me happy
---
In all honesty, I think most of us weren't playing on such full servers back in the day and there was no where near this many 60s and doubly so for this many in raid gear. The culture has shifted drastically.
---
I did, and I see no problem. If you want to make some arguments as well, maybe we can have a discussion.
---
us alliance have the best penises, too
---
reading combat logs is cheating?
---
I find it out that people can defend the right to do this saying its ruining those guys income while in the same breath demeaning mages  when they charge for Food/Water. Both take equal amount of time to do.
---
set some keybinds baby wow that was hard to watch.
---
Gotcha. The Rake is pretty good though?
---
There's a few things at play here, but the overall result should be that you don't really notice a difference. First, you're near the center of the raid tanking the boss, players max range is \~40 (some are bigger, I know) yards which means if they're hitting the boss you're likely in range to see everything they use, but more importantly you see the damage and abilities that are used on the boss. In theory you could miss an odd evocation or heal on a player in the distance, but that's probably within margin of error. The second is that most of the threat meters sync with each other to give a more accurate display. But, I believe the major threat meters right now currently sync threat to provide a more accurate number, which means they will still accurately display threat done by people in your party or raid even if they're killing another boss across the raid.
---
Varies. You want to make sure the item stays in the guild so it should be someone trustworthy and committed. But it's also not a very good legendary and therefore just for pvp/prestige - so whoever is interested in that.
---
Just like vanilla.  Welcome to crying your way to retail 2.0
---
Yeah Arcane Shot puts Aimed Shot on cooldown.
---
I mean something had to be done, Spy was absolutely ridiculous. It's definitely a positive to the game if it's broken now.
---
Alright now that I'm home from work. PVP is unrestricted, but I would argue that just because you didn't experience this type of pvp doesn't mean it didn't exist in vanilla, because it did. They knew what would happen. I think they should've released bg's right away with honor, but they didn't and people knew that was the plan, so they could've planned accordingly. People however didn't and thats on them for choosing a pvp server when they knew this type of pvp was going to exist. 
---
We also are in a min/max society people know the best way to get honor is fighting people that give honor that can't fight back.  Lastly with the war reference. Our characters are in fact soliders and not civilians. We are going out to contested areas and have the ability to kill those not in our faction. NPC's are the civilians which is why outside of guards they give DK's just like in the real world civilian casualties are terrible. Our characters the soldiers are fighting each other and killing each other. The faction leaders are the generals. The strategy behind a war is not just resources most wars in history are over land. In this game that would be owning contested zones. So its exactly like a real world war from a theoretical sense.
---
It’s not a bug you seem very confused...
---
I found one bois, one of those stealth-clicker-rogues!
---
You do realize that the hunter *kills* a path of mobs for the buyer, right? That the hunter doesn't just waltz past everything? The buyer just follows the hunter's kill path, you dolt.
---
Nothing crazy, just responded with "Bet you feel high and mighty with that ban hammer" then he called me a rare waste of time, muted me from contacting all mods for 72 hours and perma banned me. I've just submitted a post over at report a mod.
---
Yeah, the same is true in fights where I don't even use vanish or its on CD but okay.
---
Imagine not using CDs to break nova.  Also 8 seconds.
---
Yeah check in again here when Vaelastrasz comes out and see how well you're doing.
---
Yea i always try to add them on bnet to let them know i only camp them for 4 times a day to maximise honor but so far only 1 has accepted :(

Since I hit 60 I have been in kargath, I haven't even gone to kalimdor in the past 2 months may be for DM and find rexxar.
---
Oh no! Now we can't verify if Johnny is a uber l33t DPS!
---
Yeah, I'd break all damage meters and majority of addons to remove a literal cheat program.
---
I KNEW IT. Since Wpvp went live, I couldn't understand why Alliance raids kept materializing out of no where. I'd see 2-3 mounted alliance just up the road ahead of me in Felwood, I get within Charge distance, and 20 more Alli appear.
---
&gt; Collecting Fire Resist gear (@ 239 unbuffed now, even more than the guild MT right now hehe)
---
Keep in mind that 300 is the cap, so if you're over 300 buffed, you might as well take some of the FR off and replace it with something else.
---
Eventually, yeah, but some of us had been raiding without them for a while.
---
Yeah apparently it is, I've never seen it but the addon finds out somehow
---
Yeah, feels like horde camp all the FP to me for some reason though
---
Don't fuckle with Shuckle
---
Bank alt
---
I don't think I will remember this thread by that time I'm afraid
---
Yes.  Very much so. 
---
This will have rolling fuck good damage across the board.
---
&gt; We had working dps and threat meters back then.
---
Yeah I'd like a source for us having threat meters back in the day. Raided to and including 4horsemen back then, never heard nor saw anything about a threat meter. If there was one, it was not made public.
---
I'd say having a balanced server is more lucky.
---
I think you need to learn more about twinking and why it exists.
---
They lied.  Jesus Christ on a fing stick.
---
On a case-by-case basis.
---
If you're so whiny and entitled that you'd break entire game mechanics to get your way, you might as well just go back to retail where all the changes you'll want to make to classic were already made years ago.
---
On a balanced server, I completely don't mind this way of thinking. Because there is a fair chance you will have your ass handed to you. We are talking about imbalance to the point where it's actually not opposing teams and there is no challenge. At that point, you're just burning down the house to be king of the ashes.
---
I didn't ignore it.  I just said it's wrong, and then you even admitted you're on a "balanced" server so you're anecdote doesn't even really apply.  Idk what your deal is but you would fail a stats class fast.
---
When is your ama?
---
You are getting rid of honorless target with an exploit.
---
Does the hk floating text pop up but no Honor shows in chat, or you don't see anything at all?
---
So explain why people in my guild are telling me it gives their last seen location/coords? People are posting the name, class, cords and last seen location. I believe them when they say it man, I got them to check. Also, even if it didn't do that it still needs to be removed, telling you a class, name and that they are in the general area of you still is op information. Mages could just decide to air the whole area willy nilly to suss out rogues when normally they would have no clue. There Is no way this add on should exist, it's a huge PvP crutch!
---
Atleast they cant complain about being outnumbered.
---
Your that kind of special idiot then. No need to cater to that retardism.
---
AWESOME change
---
Hopefully this is satire, otherwise Why do people think we’re gonna get AQ40 way sooner than expected? People are still getting to 60 and people are leveling at a lower rate due to the WPVP making it harder for those to get to 60. Im pretty sure you understand that if BWL were to release, maybe a couple of guilds would be able to run it but that would be like 0.4% of total population of wow classic, it doesn’t make sense that AQ40 would be released sooner especially since its one of the hard raids at this moment.
---
Isn't it far better to scout as ghost? One - you can't die again, and two - you don't alert the whole zone when he spawns.
---
Damn you smashed me
---
so *angry* about our precious damage meters
---
tell me, is it more selfish to focus on raid goals, or to masturbate to your personal dps?
---
I just logged off on 3 horde trying to camp me in blackrock. Killed me once, walked back to my corpse, saw em sitting there, logged off.
---
I can turn my mount quest in tomorrow lads it was literally the last thing i was doing tonight.
---
Enjoy the wait.
---
That’s not an alliance thing. As horde on herod every single fo is being camped and brm is generally alliance controlled right now. Pretty sure a bit of horde transferred off.
---
I would too since they don’t post numbers. The best you’re gonna get is posts on Reddit.  If you don’t want to look at the front page and see all the posts how it’s miserable for the average player and not assume people are going to be unsubbing that’s up to you.
---
AQ prepatch will last like an hour. Blizz already confirmed they arent changing req materials. Top guilds will farm it all and turn in for scarab lord
---
Boo hoo

Noticed the same in Orgrimmar. Take 2 steps forward and another wave up people render lmao.
---
Ive downloaded Grid2 and Libheals, but i dont see any incoming heals anywhere. What am I missing?
---
It seems like there are still artifacts of sharding from retail too. When closely chasing horde into another zone they will disappear for a second or two. Very immersion breaking too
---
I was there, just happened to run by on my way to WPL.
---
A step (possibly misstep) in the right direction but would prefer if they somehow got rid of it altogether. 
---
I hate Spy, and I hate that I have to use it because I’m not going to put myself at a major disadvantage just out of principle.
---
i dont think there are only around 6k players on shazzrah. the top 5 alliance guilds alone almost reached their member cap and that would be almost half of the alliance which is bullshit.
---
 If they're the king by association, lols, then they should be friendly with everything inside.
---
Raid parsing on external sites use a generated .txt file that contains all combat info, including even positioning.
---
Recount/details only pull from the combat log.
---
if you're 50 yards away from the boss why would you care about threat?  you can't hit it...
---
rofl wtf is wrong with you, no i dont see a difference, cuz there was a addon that did it for you, the api in 1.12 was fully open, you had addons that did everything in vanilla. blizzard saying otherwise is lies.
---
Sounds like OP is a salty huntard that can't manage to solo Tribute.
---
How long does it take you to read a name and type /target that name (including any unique characters).  Multiply that by however many people are in the general area.
---
If an addon plays the game for you beyond the point that a human can realistically achieve then yes, I do believe that addon is a cheat.
---
Dual-wield is better for raid bosses. 2h has two strong sides - clearing raid trash in PvE and deleting people in PvP. Bonereaver is BiS for both of those tasks.
---
I don't see enough dots. MORE DOTS
---
Tbh when I watched his stream, maybe it's me but he was really whining too much and being rude to people. 
---
I guess it's just his character, he also talks about wow news which is sometimes nice.
---
It was until now with lvl 50+ dungeons and honor update, we're on a server where Ally is outnumbered 2:1 so corpse runs for everyone.
---
Yeah should go to officers or someone you know is really in it for the guild and wont be leaving. Takes a guild wide effort to make one.
---
Adrenaline ? Even the smallest amount of that stuff makes some peoples brains flood with dopamine
---
Wow, you showed them.
---
QQ I can't abuse stuff
---
It's shitty as hell. Tried getting to BRD today, group all ragequit before we could make it in.
---
&gt; and the most OP weapon ever.
---
I don't see any Felstrikers here.
---
It's really bad on unbalanced servers. On the few balanced ones it's sorta fun for a week or so if you got your affairs in order before P2 (you learn to deal with inconveniences, i.e. avoid theramore boat solo, pick up douses together with your guild). But world PVP is really shit for ranking too, so it really isn't doing anyone any favor.
---
Yea pretty sure max week 2 is rank 6... i could be wrong. Week 1 max was R4 - but i think it starts to slow down past that quite a bit. I remember rank 10 taking a few weeks (i want to say like 3-4)
---
Indeed.
---
Wow, an extra special fuck you :) Double shit move - soon you'll have no alliance to kill.
---
All the healers has to have healcomm for it to function properly.
---
sounds like u r an exploiter
---
The Rake is 1.2 att speed, and spawns once per hour. You can upgrade to the worg in SFK for the same att spd + the ability to have Furious Howl, which is great for extra damage. Broken Tooth is a 1.0 att spd and spawns once every 8 or so hours.
---
rule 7 is the worst rule in this sub
---
Now this is the kinda guy I would love to gank as a multiboxer :)
---
The ganking/camping is the main aspect of PvP before bgs. I don't understand why people complain about PvP on a PvP server.
---
Awesome. As a lvl 54 this should help me quest in (more relative) peace.
---
Just gotta stay off the main roads. I was in a cave last night that went *under* the main road in [REDACTED] zone. My Spy was pinging all the time with zerg groups riding by above, and when I mind-vision them, they're riding around all over the place looking for me to kill me, not knowing I'm underground and unreachable. It was hilarious. That's about the only thing I'll miss about this change.
---
Yeah, most horde spend way more time pvping, such that 80-90% of my KoS list is still sub 60 cause they too busy camping corpse and fps to actually level
---
&gt; I would too since they don’t post numbers. 
---
So it seems a bit silly to talk about numbers since we have nothing to actually support it.
---
&gt;The best you’re gonna get is posts on Reddit. 
---
No, please god no. Don't use Reddit as a barometer for anything unless you want the opinion of armchair experts. 
---
&gt; If you don’t want to look at the front page and see all the posts how it’s miserable for the average player and not assume people are going to be unsubbing that’s up to you.
---
And what do you think the players that enjoy the game are doing? Do you think that they are making complaints/praise threads on Reddit, or are they enjoying the game and having fun without care about what complaints people are post here? Should their opinions be completely ignored simply because no reddit thread is made? 
---
This is why you shouldn't use Reddit as a measure for this sort of stuff, you'll only get the most vocal people that are upvoted the most, this is in no way an accurate representative of anything significant.
---
Its not a twink if u dont have bis gear.. U just want a normal geard lvl 19 then not a twink
---
What about twin emps?
---
If you weren’t there for the kill you aren’t the king... pretty simple stuff
---
who cares?  you're still close enough to the tank for threat to work, and WCL gives more accurate reporting than meters anyway.
---
Resist all is probably best tanking enchant, but if you had to choose between those 2 I'd say agi for the little bit of crit that can add to threat.
---
This is how they kill spy tho, no way to snipe only one addon even if they somehow managed to get the original dev to take it down, since people can and will make new ones.
---
why dont you just remove all addons? while we're at it, so far from classic this has become, this is turning into a bad privet server.
---
Figured. Thanks.
---
I never had any of those meters cause I was a healer back then. Take a chill bro, you won't wipe because your meters don't work.
---
It’s only cheating if blizzard says it is. They don’t.
---
What's even funnier is this post is over a decade old. Classic WoW, classic Reddit, classic copypasta. I'm gonna go pour me an Old Fashioned.
---
ill be honest with you, im not sure i have ever read the sidebar content in any subreddit. i didn't even know /r/wow had rules
---
I've seen a lot of shaman with this. What warrior did you con into letting you get that?!
---
Dmg meters come from the combat log, it is not his word against yours. You can look at the overview or more in depth notes of damage recount add-ons. They parse data from a combat log because it's the only possible way to do so.
---
That wouldn't mean you don't post your auctions to the top of the list by having the bid price at 1c.
---
Then everything should be hostile to you, and atk you.
---
if only we had a pvp trinket
---
oh wait we do
---
I'd grab the agility, though honestly both are pretty negligible
---
How can you get it so wrong?
---
Early on in classic, when raiding guilds were still relatively few (at least on my low-pop server), there was a massive shortage of healers for lvl 60 dungeons. But as raids got up and running, the Shadowpriests, Retardins and Ferals (Though there are a ton of feral druids still in raiding guilds) became healers and there was no longer a shortage. Recently I've done more instances as DPS than I have as a healer, even with a half-arsed Balance spec (30/0/21).
---
Post a link to your logs, easy enough to verify your "high dps".
---
Sick man.
---
Yep honestly worth it.
---
No I don't do that, the addon I use auto sets bidding price.
---
"Hey, any ALLANCE players noticing lower city populations. *wink wink*"
---
Gee I wonder the motive behind this fake question could be. Reddit is for trolling arrogant autistis.
---
How do you know that the combat log in 1.12 was longer range than 50 yards?
---
What? We totally had those. They started becoming popular right around AQ release for sure. I used KTM for our first Vael kill for sure.
---
There should be different spirit healers for horde and alliance for each zone. If you die in IF as a horde your closest place should be like near searing gorge. 
---
That makes sense as in zones like ashenvale, alliance rez astranaar, horde near their own camp, so crossing the map is more dangerous the further you go from your camp, at the same time it’s not easy to attack the towns since the closer faction will reinforce faster
---
Sure, how?
---
DM is pretty much a pvp hotspot for non-blobs.
---
I’m so proud of you guys.. I’m lucky to be in the best alliance guild on our Horde dominated realm and we lost both world bosses first day due to crazy number disadvantages but we’ve owned them since! Feelsgoodman, goodluck our there!
---
Ah... a good old world pvp.  Enjoy while it lasts... until they release BGs
---
/u/vusys
---
Even when the game does that for you? -_^
---
It's the people who are 50 yards away from you
---
My guild double stacks. We have 2 groups of 2 healers at the start of the semi circle. First group is tank healers. Second group is melee healers. If 1st group gets knocked, the second group heals tanks just fine.
---
It doesn’t even matter atm.  The way honor is being calculated totally removes dishonorable kills from the tally. You just see a list totalbut it doesn’t get calculated in.
---
Render distance was shorter in vanilla because of shit computers and a lot of people had it on the minimum setting in order to get decent FPS. The maximum setting isn't meaningfully higher, but now there's no reason to have it anywhere but the maximum.
---
We used to joke about how epic mounts made you immortal in PvP because you could run directly at someone and be past them before you appeared on-screen.
---
Why don't we just throw in an LFR version of molten core and some BC timewalking while we're at it
---
offslaught? lol
---
The game is literally named World of Warcraft.
---
TIL that 15 \* 40 = 4200 per month and not 600, math sure is weird sometimes.
---
nothing about QQing, i would love spy to be removed, but this affects way more addons
---
Username checks out
---
I continue to love the community constantly asking for changes that they don’t know the consequences of. 
---
Blizzard will keep doing things like this in order to put out a blog post saying “they listened”, and laugh at the customer base that made retail what it is today.
---
Yeah, he's a multiboxxer on Shazzrah that streams and does dances with his character over the corpses of ganked players.
---
QQ
---
Some people enjoy leveling more than they enjoy endgame. 
---
That's what it sounds like to me.
---
Giving that dagger to a priest who is basically guaranteed benediction is fucking bonkers.
---
Ret pallies are Alliance equivalents of Ench shammies - great burst, not good for sustained DPS.
---
Oh for sure, although this wouldn't be an alt lol.
---
He almost certainly won't be taking time out to gank people with me because he will just be trying to power his new main to 60.
---
"Wahhhh but I want it!"
---
Then go get it, bitch boy.
---
[deleted]
---
This times 1000. Spy is just a log parser. The data in the combat log is fantastic.
---
&gt; and I believe what is called the "procs per minute" equation
---
PPMs are in classic. Seal of Command is 7 PPMs.
---
Everything you do is logged. When people fly over you their buffs load as if they made an action so that is why spy targets them. Same for stealth, it's an aura that gets applied. You could have the log open at any time and do manually what spy does automatically
---
Their DPS won't be any different though.
---
You may be on to something. In my multiple recent travels to RFD I didnt even see a hordie!
---
I watch his youtube way more than his stream nowadays but most of the "asmongold reacts" are clips from stream and he is pretty much himself the entire time.
---
except when you have 10 people in the vicinity to instantly kill the rogue???  Did you think of that one?
---
Nah that's just heading down the retail path all over again lol
---
Ret is fine for pvp and meme pve.
---
Prot is fine for levelling dungeons.
---
Holy is best for raiding and pvp as a healer.
---
Great point, that tiny bit of air momentum works wonders sometimes. I'm always too scared to use it near an edge though 😂
---
This feels like people trying to exploit the system are mad at other people for exploiting the system...
---
I see. Thanks for educating me.
---
Tbf, I guess if re-rolling will make him happier to play his char in the long run then it would probably fall under the "good reason" category
---
See you when BWL releases
---
Why are you still in this guild lmao
---
At that point it's time to /gquit and start fresh in a new guild.
---
Provide evidence.
---
I get that but also look at it this way. OP wants to play with his friend. But now his friend is forcing him into a situation were you roll something else to play with him or just wait for him to get back to 60. But OP wants to play at lvl 60. So his friend has effectively dictating how op will likely play because of the decision he's made.
---
im using weaponswingtimer
---
Mind if I ask you to expand on why that is? Genuinely curious.
---
will never replace for pvp tho
---
No
---
This is the same functionality that spy uses, so it’s broken and has to go. The same with spell timers. Anything that provides info from the log has to go, it’s ruining the game. You know what ...if parsing the basic logs is too much, lets ban all addons.  /s
---
I wouldn't even be mad, that's hilarious.
---
&gt;cheap mic, uses speakers     
---
Your guildies probably hated it every time you spoke
---
Casuals are around lvl 50+ now. They aren't farming MC every week. All servers have thousands if not dozen of thousand of players. Even if each server had somehow around one thousand of players going into MC that wouldn't even be 10% of the global population.
---
Supposing it take 10 days for the average player to reach lvl max (it is usually slightly longer), you'd need to play 2 hours daily for 4 months EVERY DAY to just reach it.
---
And believe me, a casual don't play a single game 2 hours every day for 4 months. I know some people have a warped definiton of casual (even seen some people saying any casual should be farming its BiS after the first month) but believe me, your guild isn't " pretty casual " by any standard except the one of a raider (which involvment in the game and playtime isn't comparable to your average player).
---
World boss s are a different thing than anything else. 
---
The best loot by far and open to all comers. 
---
Keeping your enemy from advancing is a huge part of combat - go read the art of war...
---
o yeah, you’d probably come up with some shit about how he was “toxic” too.  Lol
---
and yet I've seen 1 bre in 30 rag kills
---
Damage meters are one of the most popular addons and  have been since vanilla/bc. What a weird thing to say. Basically everyone uses them at some point.
---
*You face Jaraxxus!*
---
Ok that makes more sense, thanks for the explanation. I presume you can edit the combat log to show more things then? Mine is so simple compared to how I remember it.
---
Yes, introduced with phase 2.
---
Unless you’re invisible.........
---
Well it's the best one we currently have and I didn't know you were aware of exactly how many people use the addon. I'm done wasting brain cells pce.
---
Your damage meters will still be accurate for yourself.
---
The only thing that will be different is in *comparison* to *others*.
---
So if you're concerned about doing your best, nothing will change.
---
But if you're concerned about flexing your e-peen, this is a game-breaking change.
---
So who's toxic here?  The e-peen strokers?  Or the guy pointing out that it doesn't matter, as long as the boss dies?
---
people are able to play the dkp system however they want. If a person wants tosave it for mageblade thats fine. I see it as a glorified round robin system. As everyone starts to get theirs the price becomes cheaper. and what you call colluding I call working together. It's not a bad thing to have people of the same class coming to agreements its good for guild members to work together. I question whether or not you were in actually decent guilds given that you think people would just try to keep loot from new members like that. I would also hate to have someone who was in raids every week and working their ass off in progression only for some new guy to wander in and roll a 100 on mageblade. To me that is the very opposite of fair.
---
I'm personally gonna play less. I dinged 60 fairly recently, so I'm still gonna try and get the last of my pre raid bis items, but once I do, I'm just taking a break from the game. There's no sense in dying over and over or waiting for your groupmates to die over and over for over 30 minutes just to get to 1 dungeon.
---
Stance changes have their own shared cd, but it's not shared with the gcd
---
Battlemasters are exactly the type of mechanic that people playing classic claim to hate, but they were introduced in vanilla, so apparently that makes them okay. They're dungeon finder for battlegrounds. You sit in your city and get teleported to the action. I'd be fine if they removed them and you had to travel to the actual zone and queue there, like it was in vanilla originally, but if we're going to have them, then there's no reason to not give players the ability to sign up from anywhere. It would 100% make classic better in terms of gameplay.
---
"I hate this thing but I still use this thing because my hate for this thing is not as great as the advantages this thing brings me" bruh. Don't use it if you don't want to. At this point you just want to hate it but secretly enjoy having it.
---
I’m levelling a protection paladin atm and find the tanking really enjoyable, if you manage to find a decent guild who don’t care about being so meta you can also off tank during raids
---
The point of spreading it is to generate outrage and get it hotfixed. If it was kept under wraps people would continue exploiting it forever. It only takes 2 people per faction/realm to screw up the brackets for everyone.
---
Make your own list.. literally go to leather armour and sort by equip level
---
People are saying 200 yards
---
At 19 priests do 36.5 dps base damage alone from wanding, costing no mana at all. This is more than rogues weapons base damage, now factor in the rogues extra damage spells etc, but now factor in the priests extra damage spells, dots, cc, fear, heals, bubble, and the fact youre just gonna be playing capture the flag over and over.
---
Its called a dungeon you should try it...
---
It's only been a week.
---
Oh you sweet flower child....
---
I've been running a bunch of earlier dungeons (RFC, SFK, SMs) on various alts, and I notice more often than not the warrior tank is using a two-hander. I was hoping to try my hand at tanking, and was curious what the reasoning behind this is. Better rage-generation?
---
Also, I usually only have time for shorter dungeons. SM has been a dream. Any shortish dungeons after SM?
---
You fundamentally don't understand what "per capita" means do you?
---
r/gatekeeping
---
How does the hunter's ability "feign death" work in pvp situations? If a hunter uses feign death can he just stay dead as long as he wants?
---
One of the biggest complaints was the lfg feature added in the game. Queueing through an app is just that. You are basically asking for what, in my opinion, started the downhill "everybody is a winner" route that retail is at right now.
---
No it didn't.
---
Threat meters already aren't accurate on P2&gt;P3.
---
This so much.
---
He 100% does not enjoy leveling hahaha.
---
That's one of the reasons I was so surprised.
---
The closer you are to danger, the further you are from harm.
---
In my own personal experience.... When people start nitpicking reasons for not liking a game, something as simple as attack animations, it usually means they arent having fun.
---
I have noticed this with myself in asheron’s call and everquest a few weeks before i quit the game. I pick out something stupid that bothers me and i slowly let that thing ruin the enjoyment for me - or so i thought. As i got older i started to realize i wasn’t enjoying the game first, then i started nitpicking something like character animations and then used that as my reason to quit/reroll.
---
Sounds like your friend is in that camp
---
Can't the addon use that instead now?
---
Next week max is 10k + 13k = 23k-24k points
---
As I said, it’s not about having an advantage, it’s about not being at a disadvantage. And no, I do not “secretly enjoy having it”.
---
It has happened many times before, like when Keftenk made the post about DM buffs stacking and it was fixed within the hour.
---
Omen Threat Meter
---
I think you're bullshitting about raiding vanilla if you never heard of it.
---
Don't know the details but Spy takes all its information directly from the chat log, it doesn't have access to anything a player couldn't use themselves. People are just mad that this makes the game "easier". As if anyone enjoyed getting corpse camped by rogues or ambushed by roaming ganking groups.
---
'Sync their iq with their level number' had me bust out laughing
---
Look up guides and find out yourself, like you should've done before making a whole thread accusing people of using exploits.
---
If you want people to take you seriously, you need to do your research and make sure your facts are straight before going off on a wild tangent.
---
You must’ve upset one of the Haitian call center gms
---
Slight tweak to this post “holy is the HOLY choice for raiding”
---
His friend is using his time to enjoy the game he wants to. He isn't forcing OP to anything. OP wants to play at level 60, and his friend isn't prohibiting that. His friend is prohibiting OP from playing with him. 2 sides of the coin. No it's not ideal but that's life.
---
collude between people of the same class? I see that as working together which isn't a bad thing at all. And yeah it relies on a decent guy running the show which we have. It doesnt help him to fuck around with stuff like that. We keep things as transparent as possible by posting all the dkp stats on our site such as pieces of loot we have, total dkp we have at any time, and dkp spent. It's not hard to figure out if everything is all well and good. It's just as transparent as loot council shenanigans and fairer than rolling.
---
Stfu millennial turd.
---
Neither of us is right because there is no generic answer that applies to all servers. That's my fucking point.
---
It’s bound, wtv guide you’re looking at is wrong. Anyway just trap her and kill the pet first, then kill her. Don’t bother silencing her, just let her cast and outrange it
---
Grats Shuckle! -decoy
---
Aight buddy. Downvote me as much as you want, it's not gonna change the fact that you're a hypocrite.
---
my group didn't. we just had to choose between honor or GPA then. was an easy choice!
---
I would have rather seen anyone using the add on get 30 day ban.
---
It’s not cheating.
---
All addons pull from the same source: the combat log. 
---
That’s how addons like ClassicEnemyCastbars work. They detect a spell being cast through the log and then display a bar. Normally, players would have to look at the enemy to see what spell is being cast. 
---
Or ClassicAuraTimers, they show an aura duration after detecting a spell through the log. You’d normally have to count down yourself. 
---
Perhaps threat meters too. You’d have to get comfortable with the damage you do and how that translates to threat. Knowing when exactly to stop dps to not pull is beneficial. 
---
All three of those are considered cheating by your definition. Should everyone in the game delete those addons or have them made broken by Blizzard?
---
Power infusion then over to holy BUT still take your mana 5ptr in shadow and don’t let anyone talk you out of the other 5 in wands. 
---
Those 10pts are a foundation until you start getting solid raid bis.  
---
Bullshit to dissenters - you need them to function when not in a group
---
nice
---
Yeah, im 60 warlock. Stick to draintank untill you ding 60, then respec to sm/ruin.
---
Pre 60: aoe groups is best while still drain spec. Get used to using hellfire after mage nova. Pref with a priest to shield and a cookie ready. In other groups the right curse is important to keep up, recklessnes/elements. You will use corruption then sbolt, just drain if you need to save resources. 
---
After 60 you either curse/sbolt or aoe. Dont use coa on bosses, curse of shadow does more damage. Alot of the time recklessnes is best tho, but CoS feels best!
---
Go duel people outside town
---
No it wasn’t it was a good resource. Only people who hate it are the ones that like to gank boohoo. It may not be as far a range anymore but it’ll still warn against your dumb ass. Also the best warning of something stealth warning against shithead rogues is still there. Keep boohooing
---
I believe that’s called duel.
---
True but he’s been doing it for 10 years or something now. And also made videos way back then. I guess if the small streamers of today kept at it for 10 years they’ll get there too?
---
I’m horde on a pvp server. I feel like my server is pretty well balanced, faction wise (is there data on this I can check?!
---
Doesn’t make much of a difference though. For 50-60 zones I haven’t been able to turn in a quest in days.
---
Haha true. Forgive me for getting ahead of myself
---
guild on alliance EU is fine, but their roster is more or less full on MC nights so getting a slot is impossible because 50% of the core raiders raidlog while the others no-life the game. 
---
definitely quieter overall though
---
The same way that canceling an auction near the end is 'exploiting' despite being a valid and intended function designed by Blizzard for the Auction House.
---
You tried to 'exploit' an 'exploiter' by getting cheap materials, and you failed, now you complain on reddit.
---
It would just be a zone full of warlocks, shadowpriests and UD rogues then. 1v1 has it's own problems. What you want is Arenas.
---
"Classic+" doesn't exist, it's a pipe dream that is all things to all people.
---
Oh nice. They broke a ton of addons for...Names popping up
---
Alliance has Thorium Point under control on my server, took me 10 deaths to finally fly away as fast as the fp spawn.
---
You could always go and play retail if you want to have a combat log with longer range.
---
Me too. Don’t people just like... Never flag? I’d imagine that the big wpvp probably pretty much never happens.
---
yep, just run it outside of the game on 2nd monitor
---
(and they could defeat that by making it only flush the log once every 5 minutes or so when not super busy...)
---
Um right click reporting to bot gms was not a thing in vanilla, so you are an idiot
---
In fact, Furious howl is only good if you're in a full 5-man group (basically just dungeons). Cats are best DPS pets because they can use both Bite and Claw.  
---
 [Starving Mountain Lion](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=2384)  in Hillsbrad has the same 1.2 attack speed as Rake and all moonstalkers in Darkshore (from runts to matriarchs) have 1.3 attack speed, so only slightly worse.  
---
[https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/attackspeed.php](https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/attackspeed.php)
---
Posting a screenshot of it would be good
---
no, it can't access it
---
Warriors don't have ranks, rage costs are flat so it just shows the highest ranks you have
---
I get both sides but keeping them in cities is fine be ause you can queue then leave the city if I recall. So set your hearth at City queue join world go to big and hearth to sign up again, should take roughly an hour for the queue plus bg
---
Basically once you win loot you are +1 and can't win further loot over players who are not +1. Often you will find pugs that reset the +1 at domo or rag for mc
---
A month ago I wished to roll on a pvp server, now here I am on my pve server enjoying the hillsbrad raids and flagging whenever I want to have some fun.
---
I’m going to tell my kids this is the Declaration of Independence
---
I still find lots of my guildies playing every hour of the day and wPvPing.  Always the same 6 names on in discord from 10am to 4am.
---
Nah world PvP is way more fun than 1v1 PvP.
---
Way more possibilities and really tests the player skills.
---
rough times
---
Bullshit you did, everyone had threat metres long before naxx
---
Grats! Kurrinaxx represent! (I'm in For The Horde). Was fun coordinating with y'all, Flyquest, Yada, and Invictus for Kazzak as well.
---
Are Invis pots against TOS?
---
dude how can these supposed classic players support having speed enchants on boots but then claim flying mounts are a bad mechanic? its just more convenient its the same thing
---
Horde has a huge advantage in AB
---
also is everyone forgetting you can buy subs in retail too to subsidise it
---
Ahhh true, hmm not sure then. Def a little odd.
---
No. If your faction has lengthy queue times, that's the price you're paying for your numbers advantage. Either reroll or deal with it.
---
your guild finish MC in under an hour?
---
So like a spot people duel in? Like outside org or outside IF?
---
How would you know? All it does is read the combat log
---
Yep.  My comment was intended to be snark about how little return their is for time invested.
---
It was a failure for the people complaining, it was a success for all the people playing and enjoying it.
---
Well actually you do agree with the ToS. Blizzard has a form that you checked off agree to when you made your account...
---
Don't fuckle with the Shuckle
---
I don't play classic wow, but back in vanilla, as a Shaman, I remember my bullshit strategy of 2h build with high crit.
---
I had like a 10% chance of outright killing anyone other than warriors and paladins with earth shock windfury, whatever the hell that extra hit attack is.
---
If I got Auto Attack Windfury + (Stormstrike?) Windfury + Earthshock crits, there was nothing to outplay.
---
Do you actually have coherent thoughts, or is constantly vomiting out "pvp lol" the height of your conversational capabilities?
---
What server is this? Looks like a server I would like to go to considering on my current one it’s reverse with alliance in the majority
---
It was just a little nod to horde for the devs spending 90% of their time on alliance.
---
&gt; I'd be fine if they removed them and you had to travel to the actual zone and queue there, like it was in vanilla originally, but if we're going to have them, then there's no reason to not give players the ability to sign up from anywhere.
---
I do too, but I'm sure all the people crying because their faction isn't 50/50 would cry even more about having to go into a contested zone so they could get into a BG.
---
You land. You die. Shoulda rolled PVE if it's such a issue for you lmao.
---
They need to fix it somehow. It’s the WoW equivalent of X-Ray vision.
---
More reliable than looking only at people raid logging, which is what people have been doing.
---
Yet every class can easily destroy Elites their level anyway, so it didn't really matter.
---
I always thought it only deflected direct target spells like Frostbolt, Shadowbolt, Holy Fire etc
---
I could be wrong, but I honestly don't have any memories of people reflecting AoE spells
---
It isnt considered shameful? Weird orc culture.
---
I've got to be in another timeline somehow...blizzard actually listens to the community (more than once this week lol).
---
Holy.
---
Mc...omfg...just wtf
---
Alternatively:
---
Oh fuckle here comes the Shuckle!
---
The gear a character is wearing in a video game is not personal data. Get real.
---
They don't reflect AoE spells, only ones that target you specifically.
---
"You think you are casual, but you arent."
---
DEAD BY SNOO SNOO
---
Are they removing DBM too? It's pretty much cheating as well lol...
---
Bit late to the party learning that there’s a cap on debuffs!
---
If you add another once you’ve reached max does it knock another one off or just not apply the one you try to add?
---
If I did hypothetically need to remove one that I’ve applied, do you need to wait for it to finish if it’s on a timer or can you manually remove it?
---
4 str 4 Stam leather belt? Ahhhh oooooo?
---
Level 18?
---
Do you have a source for this?  
---
I'm finding evidence for both sides, all of which is anecdotal.
---
I don't care about seeing mobs, I want to render the world as far as my video card can handle.
---
Point's the same. Whatever it is you dislike about this change, BFA got you covered!
---
Hey i quickly made a video so you could see exactly the problem [https://youtu.be/CZ0pa9ExesI](https://youtu.be/CZ0pa9ExesI)  
---
of course the lag is the same with other actions like looting, gathering etc. i just want to know if you have the same delay and if yes then how can you play and be ok with that coz this is something that boggles my mind.
---
^ this.
---
I'd say alliance by quite a lot.
---
They clearly havent seen heartseeker lol
---
I am in game testing spy. This change has drastically reduced its effectiveness. Stuff is ontop of you now before it is detected. This is a great change.
---
Realistically it's not, because I can elect to *not* PvP when I don't make the fatal mistake of blessing some shitdick with it enabled. 
---
Tarren Mill/Southshores alive and well on my server, I'm close to 60 and look forward to actually getting to get involved.
---
You really suck if it takes you 1 hour lol no matter how much ganking, or pick up eng and deflect frost so you can run inside
---
"No no, you don't get it, EVERY Asian is good at maths"
---
I like when people use the macros at clever times, or they have clever original translated phrases, but you have to remember that a lot of these people are 12 and clever is not in their vocabulary yet.
---
See you there friend.
---
doesn't matter.
---
Yeah google "fight club warrior discord" it's a classic wow centric warrior theorycraft discord
---
Cross server you mean? I was hoping they wouldn't be tbh. Cross server and auto queues are the two biggest nails in the coffin for communities imo.
---
&gt;This is closer to the original behavior of WoW 1.12
---
So making it closer to #nochanges is a bad thing?
---
yoo i was there when you crafted it! gratz homie!
---
Uhhh, what complication?
---
I've been wondering about this. It's been a long time since Vanilla but I do not remember things rendering quite this close. Seems like something they changed.
---
But there ain't.
---
There's an auto marking healers addon?
---
&gt; It's streamlined "game sense" and gives people information and an easy way to use that information that they wouldn't naturally have the awareness and skill to do on their own.
---
DBM should be deleted too, it's literally cheating.
---
I knew what it entailed, why I rolled pve. It’s just fun seeing how horde show what type of people the filthy horde players are.
---
it is classic wow.  you had fifteen years to figure this out.  hell cant one also cancel auctions in retail?
---
fifteen years.  there is no excuse for any of us to have not known what it would be like.  they wanted classic wow with no changes and fought for it and got it or very nearly.  go play some other game that suits instead of trying to force others to bend to you.
---
i think the game sucks but they fought for it.  so let all of us who dont like it as is just leave in peace
---
We're looking at imbalanced pvp servers.  We're looking at the majority of instances.  Obviously every server is different.  That's a trivial point.
---
Did you miss this part?
---
It’s not the game I played in 2004. The community has changed too much. That’s why I did stop playing. Because getting camped on a boat used to be rare and the 1 guy used to either get ganged up on and killed really fast or just get bored and dance with you because he was actually not an asshole. Now the whole server’s horde population is camping the boats and  mid-high level quest hubs and camping on roofs.
---
You definitely are ignorant, but it’s not your fault. The game is not the problem, the way the people have changed in the last 15 years is.
---
Cheers, I'll be running 6/8 SC with 2/2 DS.   
---
I'm quite lost with how everything else works as i'm new to WoW and only started playing with classic. Am currently following ShadowPanthers 'Phase 1 PVP Pre-Bis Set'. Im not sure if you are aware of it but i'm wondering if it would have changed now because of Phase 2.
---
The guy sounds like a sociopath. Legit strategy tho
---
horde are camping camp turajo graveyard on my server
---
You used to be able to hook COMBAT_LOG_EVENT and now it all goes to the text file.  So you can still parse the logs, but if combat logs exist to be parsed, what is stopping spy from parsing the same log?
---
You tell em.
---
Enh is too RNG, WF crits and all is good, WF doesn't proc or crit and you lose. 
---
If you want a bruiser but not RNG based, roll Warrior, IMO.
---
A drop in sub numbers.
---
Cross server yes sorry, and it was that way at the end of vanilla. Though if I recall it is in "battlegroups" and not all servers will be crossing. Back in the day my battlegroup was stormstrike made up of multiple realms
---
imagine being this stupid
---
Yeah but they are still important to people and something people have been using for like 15 years with no expectations that they would ever not work. To break it now is a really big deal.
---
Grobb is pretty populated still. We get queues during the weekend, and I see tons of horde in every zone.
---
8 hours CD as well
---
Quite the opposite imo. They should group all types of servers together to rid the battlegroups of possible faction bias.
---
Yeah, but server transfers are only available from high-pop PVP servers (all of which are unplayable due to the Horde advantage) to the four realms in my original post - and I think there's literally only one PVP server with a reasonable population that leans Alliance so there's nowhere for those reinforcements to come from.
---
Also, I'm advocating people move to four servers - two of which are Alliance leaning ghost towns where the opposite faction probably hardly see each other at all (and are therefore basically PVE servers), and the other two are more populated but are already Horde-leaning.
---
I'm likely going to be moving to Bloodfang so I'm basically doing what you're suggesting; flipping a server closer to being equal. Not sure why you've got such a problem with that? The balance on Flamelash is already screwed to the point where there's twice as many Horde as Alliance and is never going to recover whether I stay or not.
---
So just because a rogue chose to spec into daggers a tank shouldnt be able to roll on a dagger? Even a deep prot warriors best weapon (excluding orc and human) is a dagger as of now. Also any guild that isnt pushing for fast clears probably isnt min maxing every item, so again the idea that a rogue should have priority over a tank or even fury warrior is somewhat absurd.
---
Space in the stylesheet, the fact that adding server names to flair would mean they'd need to have class/ally/horde combos of every server. That's an enormous pain in the ass and might not fit in the sheet. 
---
Not to mention that users sorting through that mess in the flair selector would be less than ideal.
---
This has been discussed at length in the past and was ruled not feasible.
---
-------
---
Other subreddits have systems that do work, but as I said, Vusys can go into that since he's the expert.
---
OFFSLAUGHT LMAO
---
I, Shuckle, have a dream
---
Git gud
---
I would greatly prefer a change to nature res to make them viable, and buff the bosses to compensate, but that would trigger the #NoChangers so ya.
---
Damage meters are for more than just epeen.  They are an important tool for Raid Leaders to understand what is happening.
---
Don't stances count too?
---
Yeah because we were all running around with spy in vanilla....
---
It will still vary depending on the time of day, day of the week and of course faction. I suspect 5-10 minute queues will be pretty common for a lot of players, and that's not really enough time to leave a city and do something productive. If you're already in your desired zone, however, you can do a lot in even 5 minutes.
---
Dagger has less stealth than sword in normal pvp builds. Hemo swords is better all around due to daggers being weaker vs plate and mail classes.
---
Do you want changes or no?
---
Heya, I just want to say in light of the change that went through today that I was 100% incorrect, and you were 100% correct. Sorry for being a dick about something I thought I knew a lot about, but in fact didn't know jack shit. 
---
Have a good one.
---
In phase 2 it shouldn't change except for potential hit rings if you need them for hit cap.
---
Spy is at least as useful for a roaming gank squad as the people trying to avoid them. It's impossible to hide and it removes all need for visually scanning the environment.
---
Let's put a smile on that face.
---
I could be mistaken (I’ve never bothered taking this damn cat) but isn’t it only an extremely minor upgrade at best? Like there are pet attack speeds that are almost the same.
---
Sorry, I don't have a source for release dates of Omen and KLH, but they most definitely existed in vanilla.  They were created for Vael and Onyxia originally, and while I didn't get to 4H, I did do the first handful of bosses in Naxx, and threat meters were mandatory for our raids....even healers.  I'm glad multiple people here can back me up because tracking down a release date for those is near impossible now.
---
Huh?
---
But that's a private server.
---
&gt;So I'm not sure what to believe.
---
You tested it for yourself and said it doesn't reflect aoe spells when you tried. Hunter trap, frostbolt and frostshock are the only single target frost spells it reflects.
---
*Plays on PVP server for the suspense of PVP happening at any time*
---
*Uses addon that removes any suspense of said PVP*
---
Makes sense.
---
That's valid.
---
Not happening.
---
Nothing done about the STEALTH DETECTED alert then? Useless.
---
3 hours
---
Yeah was asking for raids, as a hunter serpent sting is a nice bit of DPS but hardly an important one so knowing there’s a cap will make me think twice.
---
Is there a good reference for learning this priority system?
---
yes but to act like nothing has been bugged in classic and that the way it is is the way it was has proven to be misleading.
---
One caster is 30m away from boss on one side, another caster is 30m away from boss on the other side....that's 60m split and they can't accurately report each other's threat.  In *theory* they can at least see tank threat though and tank can see theirs, so you're right as far as that goes.
---
Grats on gloves Doja :)
---
Yeah I remember battlegroups, still unfortunate in a way though; you make a name for yourself on your own server, adding multiple into the mix massively takes away from that. I see so many familiar names on my server (for good &amp; bad reasons) daily, I remember them and what they've done.
---
Have they announced the battlegroups yet do you know, to see how many and which realms will be joined?
---
Once battlegrounds launch the PvP dynamics will change quite a bit. Alliance players will get instant battleground pops 24/7 which will lead to alliance premades farming BGs 24/7. If you're not in the top premades on alliance the grind will be extended by several weeks until the leading premades finish first. On alliance each realm will have at minimum two full premades battling for the #1 spot each week but in reality there will be at least 3 highly competitive premades on most realms due to the inflated population caps.
---
The horde faction will have significantly longer queues, and as a percentage horde will have fewer premades than alliance but more active pvpers in total. All horde players will have to world pvp on the usual pvp hotspots (flight masters, dungeon entrances) while waiting for battleground pops because the downtime while waiting for a BG pop makes a significant impact on honor per hour.
---
The dynamics of pvp are such that alliance will have a higher percentage of premades within the honor system due to being the least populated faction. That forces horde premades to become a lot more competitive and put in more hours to achieve their goals because they run a higher risk of losing games.
---
In terms of honor/week a solid premade can win 90% of their games in a given day. The nature of the battleground system is such that premades are vastly favored. The average length of a premade WSG vs. a PUG is the time it takes the flag carrier to run the flag three times. That's about 6 minutes average per WSG victory.  
---
Alliance premades will on average win 1 WSG every 10 minutes while horde premades will average one WSG victory every 15-20 minutes depending on variables such as region, time of day etc. It will be more difficult to rank on horde than on alliance due to lengthy queue times and a higher portionb of .
---
Either way premades will earn tons of honor and marks from winning, and at the end of the week they'll turn in all of their WSG marks for a boost of 50-100k additional honor depending on which faction they play.
---
The highest honor I saw someone earn last week, without any BGs, was 160k. With battlegrounds the potential honor/week is closer to 3x that.
---
It would be pretty funny if the dominant faction had to pick between ganking and stopping people from getting in, thus increasing their own queue time, or not ganking and getting into battlegrounds faster as a result.
---
Ideally, I should just hit +6% hit for pvp? Is there a Crit cap too?
---
Ah, from what I've read daggers spec into improved expose armor to combat that, and the % dmg increase from ALL sources on kidney shot nullifies plate and mail while large crits demolish cloth and leather
---
Well, the evidence you seek is reflected (heh) in your personal experience. Reflectors have always worked this way, targeted spells only. 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18639/ultra-flash-shadow-reflector#comments
---
I just logged on today at 47, haven't been able to play in 9 days due to work/family stuff. Walked out of Raventusk village and died immediately. Tried to level for an hour and gave up. Think I got a whole bar of experience in that time frame.
---
I don’t  think you can once there is a bid.
---
classic endgame is basically a complete joke, any group of \~40 idiots can steamroll all the raids.
---
i wouldn't worried about not having enough time, as long as you can spend a few hours once a week you're good to go.
---
Blizzard know everything you do in game lol.
---
How do you justify this?  
---
Do you not remember everyone's damage meters reporting different numbers back in Vanilla?  I do.
---
Let me translate for you guys.
---
WAHH MY ADVANTAGE IS GONE WAHHH! WAHHH THEY FIXED SOMETHING THAT WASN'T WORKING LIKE IT WAS BACK IN VANILLA. WAH WAH WAH.
---
Fuck that shitty addon and anyone that was glued to it.
---
Hunter can solo dm north tribue for good money...but ..it's actually not that easy. It takes ages to master and you can always still stuff it up. And you need engineering.
---
If you're a good player you can make bank with hunter, but just remember it's not a given. 
---
I'm hunter and have aoe envy for farming. I think mage is more consistent for gph.
---
It was detecting enemy players outside of render distance. How would that not be cheating?
---
Just don't duel them, winning that way gives not clout and any tournament normally disqual people for using it.
---
Agreed. Spy is 10x as useful when used offensively as opposed to defensively.
---
This 100% buffs defensive play. No more aircraft carrier radar on a horse.
---
Unless the mage ran out of teleport mats and only had portal mats
---
It's still completely ridiculous man it keeps happening! How can it be worse than 15 years ago, it feels cheap. They are maximizing profits until people go nuts and complain.
---
Yeah TBC is also my favorite expansion. My point is that the complaints I see constantly levied on this sub are absolute mirrors of topics and arguments I saw back in the day and knew they were leading the game down a horrible path back then, so it's partially funny and partially sad that these same shitty arguments are being thrown around now even though we absolutely know better. The people classic is supposed to be for aren't the ones bitching on forums right now. They're the ones playing and enjoying the game.  The game so many people seem to want already exists and has for years thanks to their complaints.
---
It's fine to use.  The bosses are immune to the proc and don't even take damage.  I just checked my warcraftlogs and I dealt 0 damage across any bosses with gutgore proc.
---
The gun should always go to melee as it's total shit for hunters. Same with Strikers Mark. Your hunters are trash if they dont know this. Purple doesn't always mean better.
---
Spy is a bs addon that's detrimental to WPVP, and in essence Vanilla but as long as it exists it's simply too much of an advantage to ignore.
---
Hypocritical or not that's exactly why lots of people are against it. If you refuse to use it you're just denying yourself the same advantage your enemies get from using the addon. It's why it'd be best if it didn't exist at all.
---
Step 1 - Don't pvp flag in your factions territory
---
&gt; You could have the log open at any time and do manually what spy does automatically
---
Unless you're some kind of superhuman, you can't. Nobody can parse information that quickly, or spit out /tar names that quickly. Spy gives players levels of performance they previously could not have reached.
---
Whitemane has sucked ass since I first rolled on it, and it's not even the worst one out there.
---
I shouldn’t have to spec a specific way just to outweigh the small advantage of knowing someone is in the same 100 yard range.
---
It might, but it can be solved. Add ons can communicate on chat channels. This is actually how some Threat meters work already.
---
So the mods can be modified that all raid info is communicated to all road members on thee back channels, keeping data in sync. Might be a bit painful, but there is a way to solve it.
---
Its called crossroads because the roads cross
---
\*Lord Kazzak would like to know your location\*
---
It always detects stealth. It’s an active ability that will process when the player is in render range. Eliminating the entire functionality of stealth players is game breaking.
---
I don't quite understand what you mean.
---

In my defense I was ganking horde on my 60 rogue.  I was pretty much fully twinked out, but it was still a 60 to keep it sporting.
---
Source on this? I can’t imagine it being heavy on the servers compared with PvP stuff
---
from what ive seen no one is hoarding dkp at all. its not worth to wait until mageblade drops when everyone else is getting all their tier gear and trinkets and such. I'm sorry you havent had much luck with dkp but it is the better system by far in terms of fairness.

I’d say the majority of people who play didn’t know about it’s existence or didn’t use it and was overall more beneficial to the try-hards than the casuals.
---
Time to start grinding members of the opposite faction who are minding their own business!
---
For me personally farming ore myself after iron just wasn't worth it. I could get much more per hour just farming gold in the open world (warrior) and buying whatever I needed. I now have 300 engineering and blacksmithing.
---
Great news, next up please reconsider TSM for classic.
---
big brain
---
I do think dbm is part of the problem with gaming these days.  It's for scrubs and trivializes encounters.
---
if most people in the run got most of thier prebis and understand how to dps then its ez.  if people are baddies then thier dps will suck regardless of gear
---
Time to break the add on data channel functionality! /s
---
Next fastest appears to be 1.2, so sure it does make a slight difference but not a large amount, and not worth camping it imo, but if min maxers want to do it then they can knock themselves out lol.
---
If you have 2/2 dirty deeds or you're 31/8/12 spec and have 120 energy=
---
Garrote + backstab + 3/4 pt rupture (depending if you crit if youre seal fate) + vanish.
---
At this point, sit in vanish while they tick two bleed dots and crippling. The very next thing they will do is freak out and vanish 99% of the time.
---
After that vanish, choose to either risk it with a cheap shot or go in for an ambush into a cold blood eviscerate.
---
I fuck up so many orcs rogues doing this and I much rather prefer it than attempting a stunlock.
---
They could just break the stealth one specifically. What makes you say they’d have to remove every buff?
---
Friend, that is the point of specs in wow classic. If I wanna be useful in pvp I go arms. If I want to tank I go prot. You play to your strengths and around your weaknesses.
---
You are exaggerating.  Ally camp BRM areas an equal amount of time.
---
Hell I logged into Ironforge today and died to a horde rogue within 10 seconds.
---
Absolute numbers of players on the server are definitely a big issue, but you can't deny faction balance hasn't a role to play in this. If there was a 50/50 split with current populations, fights would be much less one sided, and less fights would happen in general, because people would fear getting ganged on when engaging an other player. That affects how people feel about logging in.
---
One of the issues here is that people feel like shit. You get farmed at BRM entrance all the time, and nothing's changing. You can't even defend yourself because you get killed by groups of enemies, rez, and get killed again. And in that position, people stop leaving capital cities, or plain stop logging. On some servers, BRM is controlled for 10 minutes by one faction, then for 10 minutes by the other, and despite dying a lot due to high pop, you can do *something*. On other servers, you just pray for walking a bit further before dying. It's depressing.
---
&gt; information that they wouldn't naturally have the awareness and skill to do on their own.
---
It goes beyond that actually. I would be there is literally nobody in the world who can 'just read their combat log' and tell you within 1 second the composition and levels of an entire incoming raid, and instantly cycle through the targets they need to in the chaos of a large fight.
---
but people are telling me wow classic is so ez
---
You must be a prot warrior cause you’re not seeing the point. Rogues don’t replace it til phase 5 off C’thun, prot replaces it in January when phase 3 comes out and it’s not really a big deal that they have it. Also Eskhandar’s right claw is as good if not better in terms of damage as far as I know. This is a silly argument, just know that it’s stupid to give a prot warrior perditions over a rogue and most prot warriors would tell you the same thing. Or keep being delusional, up to you.
---
In fact I believe that’s exactly how damage meters worked around this limitation in vanilla
---
And here my guild is, with a eye week 1 and another eye this week but zero ingots with nobody selling them. Congrats!
---
For not too expensive items that fee is irrelevant and people spam the ah with 1 copper bid auctions but way overpriced buyout, they should just get rid of this shit.
---
I would consider that if he wasn't somewhat of the driving force for our group to all play classic together.
---
I don't think he's looking for a reason to quit wow. Tbh I think maybe he just hates change lol. He's played private servers along with retail for a while now, and he's always a female NE. He decided to try something new this time and I think he's just struggling with it idk.
---
Just knowing him as well as I do, I can pretty confidently say if he wasn't having fun anymore he wouldn't be playing at all.
---
WE ARE SAVED!!!
---
Oh boy I gotta get me one of those
---
&gt; How does the hunter's ability "feign death" work in pvp situations? 
---
It's used to drop out of combat so you can use traps. Set your pet to passive for it to work.
---
Yeah stealth can be annoying when it's used against you.. but at the same time if a rogue is out in the open a warlock can click a few buttons from 30 yards away and the rogue dies with literally no ability to stop them.
---
Stealth is their entire defense, an addon that kills it is kind of bullshit.
---
:(
---
Because stealth is a buff, &amp; this is Blizzard. They don't just fix what they need to fix, they fuck everything else up as well. Most recent example is literally this change. They could have simply reduced enemy player combat log parses, but no they did it for everything.
---
Lol why is he an assbag for being flagged
---
Legit question: is there an addon that could trigger the crazy australian dog man sound if I use cannibalize?
---
This is what my husband and I play. I love Priests but I wanted something more defensive against Rogues. Being able to wear plate/a shield and give my spouse Freedom while he goes apesh*t is amazing.
---
his is 1 correct? that's a 20 percent difference.
---
People realized smaller parties give better honor/hour. I doubt there are more people grinding honor, they're just more spread out.
---
It sounds like you don't want a solution, you just want to complain.
---
Everyone has this one thing they would like to change because it would improve the game in their view. Mine is the guild bank and i guess yours is the BG queue access. If everyone got their thing the game would be unrecognisable.
---
I'm hoping it's a intermediate fix.
---
Best idea I have for it is to have PvE events in one combat log and PvP in another. Restrict access to the PvP log and only provide the events you actually want players to be able to see.
---
Neatplates. 
---
Hotel?
---
Trivago.
---
Hey dumbass, the blue post literally says this is closer to 1.12.
---
If they spam Blind, wont they get it off before you Vanish?
---
cause "low effort" is a bullshit rule that just allows mods to freely remove whatever they don't like
---
I’m so tired of this take. 
---
Some of us enjoy pushing ourselves to get the best performance we can.  I like stacking world buffs and and consumes and parsing as high as I can and it’s super annoying when other players diminish the way I enjoy the game.
---
So funny a lot of the very same people that want to tell people to "get gud" about PvP are also up in arms about Spy
---
How long does uldaman take? Is it a long dungeon?
---
Here I am, back again, feels like deja poo
---
The community asked "please stop spy from working". The way it was fixed was blizzards choice.
---
I'm hoping a better fix is coming with the client patch they have in the workds.
---
r/woooosh
---
I'm a warlock, so cant say i know the lionheart price extremely well lol. I've definitely seen it for as low as 20 tho. No idea how many have the recipe, but yeah the -first- one prob did charge more than that. Over a hundred tho? People would just wait. Any sane person would. There's a blue item that's honestly near as good as lionheart.
---
You could do unranked arenas at level 60 before tbc came out.
---
The relentless camping across the entire world by Horde in Classic is entirely justified in my head after the possibility of leveling alts in Hellfire Peninsula for the last like 8 years due to 24/7 horde camping for some fucking stupid reason. Oh you're 58 and want to get the fuck out of the garbage old zones and are sick of doing dungeons? Buckle up, you're going to be back to dungeons real fast once you realize the entire zone is camped at all hours of the day and night and no one is entirely sure why.
---
What makes you think /combatlog logs differently from the combat log in the game...
---
Imagine actually believing this. This nerd doesn’t realize he’s playing a video game with other actual people. Yikers
---
It reads from the combat log, in plain text.  It’s the default secondary tab on the chat window.
---
It’s not hacking or black magic.
---
He's not an assbag from his PoV
---
He's an assbag from my PoV for having it enabled.
---
It did, in that 5 minutes I was thoroughly rinsed as a 33 paladin by two warlocks and a shaman in ghost wolf mode
---
Yeah i definitely dont come here because its a great sub run by awesome moderators i'll tell you that lol. Vicious and power blind as all hell.
---
Just a quick note: 6k in a few hours isn‘t exactly good. On my server, 2.5-5k per hour (depending on the time) is good
---
I have no idea how to parse but ill get a screenshot or something on sunday lol
---
I need to know what Step 3 is!
---
graphic settings dont affect unit render distance afaik
---
It's where north south road meets the east west road
---
Can confirm. I play an hour or two almost every day since launch and am lvl 42. I think I have like 5 days played, some of that is AH stuff though rather than leveling. I cannot play any more, the time I put in now is time I’d otherwise spend sleeping. These people who hit 60 in a month and have full epics are probably not the target demo, since people who played it 15 years ago and come back now almost certainly have additional life responsibilities that prevent them from putting in full days of play, like we used to in 2005 or whatever.
---
You do realise 40/60 is not balanced at all right? That’s 50% more horde on any map compared to alliance.
---
Agreed, loved it
---
Blacksmith/Mining
---
It's very much personal preference, daggers and hemo swords are both great pvp specs
---
It all depends on how you want to play tbh.
---
Shit breaks my heart guy, just do you. You're doing fine good buddy.
---
dude if you spy a 30 man raid 150yds away you have time to prep and get out. now thats a lot harder at 50yds. it is actually brokenly good at 200yds
---
It's not really the same, because your thing is adding an entirely new functionality while mine is expanding the existing functionality of battlemasters. I wouldn't have made the suggestion if players weren't already going to be able to queue from a remote location and teleport to battlegrounds, I just want to expand the list of remote locations to everywhere.
---
you wanna talk about power hungry mods r/gaming is the pinnacle. if you go to your profile and put "revddit.com/u/______" you can see all the shit that gets shadow removed
---
yeah, HoJ is like 20 dps ish over any other trinket for a rogue, and probably similar for a warrior, and nothing will replace it for like a year or more of playing, so its worth the farm, especially when rogues can kill him in a 2 man group in under 5 minutes
---
You clicked on your own flight path... this is just  showing you where your direct flights are.
---
Vanilla had far greater potential for addons and macros to straight up automate gameplay compared with what is available in Classic/BFA. If you want a simple example you could look up how decursive worked back then. So yes, we've already changed a lot.
---
Scenario: If you played counter-strike on a map were wall hack were allowed and everybody uses it, would you seriously not use wall hack as well?
---
You know, sometimes you need to go with the flow no matter how much you hate it...
---
5% is the yellow hit cap for PvP and there is no crit cap
---
Is shaman with hand of rag a thing? I havent seen one with it before. Do not play classic. Yet...
---
You’re*
---
And where... Do these paths cross...
---
Ok so it does sound like an exploit that should be hotfixed. 
---
That said, the post is clearly from a person whos mad hes missing out on FP camp min/maxing. "Lol pvp on a pvp server" doesnt really apply. FP camping is such a douche move. But you have to expect it. Games like this breed turd people, you just gotta deal with it. Take comfort in the fact that they do it because they know they dont stand a chance in BGs.
---
I have heard they lowered the view distance
---
PVP or PVE
---
Grobbulus is pretty even between horde and alliance and is an RP PVP server but honestly you can be fine with no RP
---
Warlock is the king of 1v1, and they only get stronger later. They’re bad at your level cause you are soft.. if you get better gear later on they become too broken if you stack stam and just dot people and they can’t do shit to you.
---
any PVE recommendations?
---
Something that is game breaking deserves valid criticism. And it is game breaking in that it changes the fundamental way the game is played, and offers an immense advantage to players who have the add on.
---
Using an ability is an exploit?
---
"blind spots for intabgibles" is how council members justify gearing who they want over the most fair pick, if you can even justify a "most fair pick"  
---
DKP is by far better than loot council, the only system worse than loot council is the retail personal loot sillyness
---
and your just as fucking dumb as a rogue to fight,so my point is still made...rogue stun locks 8/10 times is instant death,lock fear bombing someone is also death because hey get this.........when someone is feared u can pretty much dot them to death...but whatever im not even going to argue anymore,everyone else who has commented has shown me one thing has not changed,wow pvp is fucking aids and no one gives a shit as long as u win.
---
they haven't officially mentioned it, but it was done on the tuesday when layers were removed everywhere iirc, or around then. You can't see people that far anymore
---
BG's are cross-realm. It just reinforces the problem, if there's no downsides of having a faction dominated server, why reroll/do anything about it?
---
Yes
---
I find it a tedious dungeon, probably an hour or even two depending on your group.
---
Just ban that shit addon. Why do you allow legal wallhacks in a pvp game?
---
Depends on the day of the week
---
THATS THE WORLD OF WARCRAFT THAT YOU PLAY.... YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH THATS THE WORLD OF WARCRAFT THAT YOU PLAYYYY
---
It's called crossroads because Eric Clapton visited the Blizzard offices the day they were developing that area.
---
I didn’t realize I wasn’t acting calm, I’m just tired of seeing everyone bitch and moan in this subreddit.
---
If you’ve seen /r/CFB flair options, then these mods can definitely fit the server names and faction combos lol. /r/CFB has an absurd number of flairs, almost all if not every US college with a football program of any division. And there’s a lot of them.
---
Bingo 😂
---
We 1 shot him pre submerge th first time in there. Tanks are only people that need to worryabkut fire resist. Dps should be in mostly if not all atleast blues.
---
I hit 60 about 7 hours played before entering Mc for the first time. That was 4 weeks ago. So I didn't rush thru the levels as u can see. My dps was around 20th in the raid. As a rogue I was embarrassed. By the next week I had gotten many pre raid BIS items and finished 2nd.
---
Now I work full time. Have 2 young kid. Only ply 4 hours a day maybe. And not every day. I was able to gear myself up. So should your dps.
---
We spread every caster. Stack the melee.
---
Oh no how can we play the game without 30+ different addons?!?!
---
Pretty useful in PvE too. Screw those stuns in MC.
---
If they died 15 times their gear would be broken and they’d have to go back to town to repair haha.
---
We had Guild dropoff since P2. Moving to a lower pop server has revived our playerbase
---
Stat priority is a priority for a reason that being said at low levels it doesn't really matter as much because you'll replace it rather quickly anyway.
---
I wouldn't worry too much, it's only really a thing in Naxx. No guarantees you'll be in Naxx and you won't be pugging it so you'll likely have a spot in a guild at that point if you are doing it. If you like hunter play hunter..
---
Threat isnt an issue so make sure all classes pop any sub 5 min CDs and trinkets right away and go full out. At least if he doesn't die you have all CDs back when he pops up. Also I believe he can still die from DOTs after submerge if hes like 1 or 2 %. And follow all the other great advice already given here.
---
So I'm a lock. I primarily listen to metal and rock leaning more towards progressive/black metal than the other subgenres.
---
 I feel like if you're a pally and not listening to power metal (when you're not watching porn that is) then you're doing it wrong
---
Yes but a guild having issues where they can't get enough dps aren't going to be able to aoe everything down and sapper it.      
---
Rag is, but partly true but people again can't position properly ever (I've seen some super shitty pugs at this) which probably is related to why that group can't kill rag (in terms of dps) due to how many people end up dying I assume.
---
Light of Elune, ice block etc
---
No it isn't lol
---
If they're aware of it, yeah, if they're not, they better have some lightning fast reflexes because you can do that combo in 3 globals.
---
There is a fix that I use when I want to use that technique on orcs and have some prep time though.
---
Equip a skull of impending doom and at the first global pop it.
---
It will break his blind and give you the window you need to do what you've gotta do.
---
So blizzard extends the range to pre-nerf levels in raid zones.
---
But that requires thought, and you’re just another scrubby spy user.
---
Alternatively you can invite guild member or friend to reset while the rest of the party is logged out. Slightly less tedious than using an alt, if you have someone available to do it for you.
---
*Getting to BRD can suck a dick though
---
Literally everything but movement, UI changes and chat is in combat log.
---
MC in a half decent guild is 90 minutes or less, we do MC and ony in 2 hrs from first pull to port to IF after onyxia, so its really not that bad, and I balance it with a 48-60hr a week job and a life. Im sure ill have to cut social life out a bit in a phase or 2 for some progression but its completely doable.  
---
If I show up 3 weeks in a row and help clear and then you show up the 4th week and roll over me on loot that just isnt fair. Thats why the people capable of clearing in 90 minutes dont stick around in guilds that roll with casuals for loot.
---
maggotmon 2020 this is max btw
---
Lol
---
Lots of pre raid gear is dps and heal at the same time. There is few pieces that are +heal only. You shut that casters right up when they try to talk shit. They just don´t want to share.
---
I know that guy!
---
Now you can finally stretch ur arm further!
---
Do you have to have the master looter loot everything then just distribute items after you port or hearth?
---
You can do that with any flight path though
---
If you're in a fight that has 10 or more people fighting it will definitely be noticeable even if you're not that close to a gym, people will res before the last is down. Last night I was pvping west of lights hope and in felwood where the water elementals are, both very high traffic pvp areas with graveyards very close and the res timer was a massive factor in both of those fights
---
I'll say this, I only PvP'd last week in the form of random fights I'd get into while running to dungeons and got 23 kills/1191 Honor. That placed me 2639 on my server, a high pop server from the original batch of US PvP servers. 2639 is a pretty sad number if that's how many people got more than 1191 honor last week.
---
By default yes. But really you should rebind A and D to strafe, use Q and E for important abilities, and get used to using your mouse to turn.
---
Pretty sure render distance is higher in vanilla than classic...correct me if I'm wrong. 
---
And it's just parsing the combat log. The end result is too good but cheating? Is Spy as bad as abusing layering for boss spawns and mats? As bad as god mode or lag switching? I just don't think so. 
---
People are too reactionary. There's so much misinformation on what spy can and can't do. 
---
I think removing a few features and this combat log nerf might leave spy in an acceptable state for Classic. Why?
---
Because after all the drama and nerdrage it only took a few changes on tbe author's end to make ClassicLFG acceptable for Classic. The outrage has so often been disproportionate to the actual problems at hand on this sub it's ridiculous.
---
Plus If Blizzard thought it was a cheat program it'd already be gone.
---
gz shuckle -maxi
---
Yea man I get that. I absolutely love classic and I'm having a blast playing it. That's why I want the game to stick around as long as possible. No matter how good the game is, it's a reality that it needs a healthy and active population to function. Nothing worse than being on a dead server where it takes over an hour to find a 5man, guilds can't fill raid slots, there's nobody in the world to PvP and barely anything sells on the auction house. 
---
I'm not saying Classic is even close to reaching that point, but in 2019 people are going to have higher standards for a game and be less forgiving of flaws given how many other options are available. Honor is already ruining the experience for a lot of people and it's no surprise server activity dipped pretty hard. 
---
Maybe it's just inevitable that Classic will eventually dwindle and stabilize into a small population of enthusiasts that are around perpetually like Starcraft 2 did, but I feel it could be a lot more
---
Nah, spirit has saved a few dungeon wipes though, well worth the 1 talent point it costs
---
Just cleared MC last week for the first time as a holy priest. I had no fire resistance and never dies unless we wiped. I did take fire resistance pots though for Rag.
---
It's definitely hard to read names from a distance.  I've endlessly fiddled with my graphic and anti-aliasing settings to no avail.  It's pretty annoying.  Noticed it a lot more once I upgraded from 1080p to 1440p
---
And there used to be addons that let you hit a single button and automatically decurse people. Didn't they end up breaking that one back in the day?
---
you have a crazy definition of the word rolled.
---
What the fuck is a thrall
---
oh man this is felstriker eh the big man blackychang himself
---
I tried classic for a month. Didn't really like it. Felt too slow and I don't have the time I used to have. It's cool to see the memes here tho
---
&gt;QQ, I can't take advantage of people's mistakes because of your lousy Cancel option!
---
&gt;Remove it!!!
---
&gt;I SAID REMOVE IT, GODDAMN IT!!!!!
---
I'm throwing back what's being thrown at me. If you want to have a mature discussion I'm down.
---
Been a while but last I bg’d on retail a &gt;10 min wait wasn’t uncommon. Tends to not be much longer than that.
---
Also depends on how they pool cross realm, they could try and match servers, or pool them all together. We’ll see on the 10th. The only thing that is certain right now is queue times would be worse on most servers without cross realm.
---
The fact that so many people in here are calling for Blizzard to "ban" Spy shows you how low information these whiners are.
---
Thank fuck for server transfers huh? I'm on stallag which is populated but the horde / alliance ratio feels so skewed I'm heavily debating switching. Biggest problem is I'm in a really fun and competent guild so I don't want to roll the dice on finding a new one
---
Sounds boring to me, but if others prefer the world to be emptier then there's nothing I can say against that.
---
As long as you hit 60 with all blues, not even Bis, you can complete raids every weekend in 2-6 hours. And pvp the rest of the time. Or farm gear/enchants/items.
---
If you've rolled on Shazzrah as Alliance I'd agree. On Firemaw I'm having a blast as Horde, even despite Alliance being way better organized.
---
You can fight for the other faction on retail.
---
It took my gold too.
---
This happened to me too. I canceled my subscription afterwards. It's just not worth it.
---
The new D3 season starts tomorrow. I'm going to have way more fun doing that.
---
Classic was fun while it lasted, though, I'll give them that.
---
Hey now, some of us like a stank booty.
---
While I hate this change. Rag is a TERRIBLE example, ranged don’t get aggro from Rag... were your ranged throttling dps on Rag cause of the threat meter?
---
You are raining on his karma parade!
---
EmptiER. It won’t be empty man. There will still be people needing a crap ton of gold and mats they need for the entirety of classic. All the big farm spots will continue to be contested.
---
DBM is terrible because the developers will develop expecting players to have something like it, so you get things that are unreasonable to deal with without an addon. Then they added in a shitton of normal in game warnings to help make up the difference, but it's still requires an addon to not be at a complete disadvantage.
---
How would you "fix" it?
---
But do you know my life circumstances? Maybe I have that time available.
---
Sorry I didn’t spend time on my level 1 alt’s ui...
---
Yeah eventually server transfers are going to have to open back to the larger servers so they can shutter the really small ones down the line tbh. You're in about the opposite situation of me haha, no desire at all to transfer but in a fairly incompetent guild so need to find a different one xd
---
The blue post says it's closer to 1.12 behavior at 50 yards than it was before at 200 yards. How is being MORE accurate to 1.12 a bad change?
---
Remeber all the people who said I was wrong when I told them to change the distance? 
---
Suck it nerds
---
I gotta go sit on the toilet real quick
---
Guild help? In PvP? That's a lie.
---
I’m looking to PVP but I’m only level 47 so it’s so hard to find a spot where I can fight people my own level, what are my options? I’m horde btw
---
U rite. 
---
Brain fart. I won’t delete my comment. I will own this shame.
---
Took me an hour and a half from thorium to BRD
---
Vanish and sprint away from full dots, how is that supposed to work?
---
&gt; So Blizzard intended for people to set their bids at 1c so they can be at the top of the list?
---
From the fact that's how the ordering works and it's not an unintended functionality, and the desposit system punishes players that pull early, yeah it does sound intended and completely fair.
---
&gt;Oh Blizz didn't want bidding wars with bidding? 
---
This is some terrible logic that I don't even know where to begin.
---
&gt;They had no intention of players bidding for items and the highest bid getting those items based on whatever lowest bid the selling user set?
---
Yeah I can tell you're frustrated, but you're condensing the situation down to a little angry rant that's just way off base.
---
Blizzard allows players to bid for items, and if those items reach the end of the auction then they win the item. If the item is pulled early, the item goes back to the owner and the owner loses their deposit. All of this is intended functionality, and exactly what happened, yet you're sore about it. 
---
&gt;The seller has an opportunity to set an "acceptable price", when he sets the bid amount.
---
He also had the opportunity to cancel his auction, which he did.
---
You claim one valid action is acceptable, but another valid action is unacceptable because it's detrimental to you.
---
This isn't an issue with Blizzard or the game, the problem is with you. But you're too angry to see it over virtual pixels.
---
Pagle has been great so far. Super high pop Alli side, but I haven't experienced a queue yet. Tons of guilds too.
---
Could learn to play instead of watching an addon
---
MY example was for dps meters, Not threat. A real world example for threat would be..ony?
---
Why don't they simply ban Spy? 
---
/s
---
No one is going to watch a seven minute video of you staring at three harpies.
---
TIL
---
I mean...
---
TRIGGERED
---
Windseaker is solid.  Not too populated so you can quest but enough people around to group up for things.  Friendly helpful bunch too.
---
i dont think bg targets was around in vanilla
---
But you can MC them for full duration, or sheep or anything else and it'll still remove honorless target. Doesn't seem like it matters
---
Not really true. Cruel barb is just fine for either mh or oh if you’re cheap. Sure sfk boe’s are better but not astronomically so.
---
Anything that makes raiding a little harder is fine by me.
---
horde will still have bg queues
---
Im sure most people who used spy didnt exactly like spy, but felt forced to use it when everyone else was. Otherwise they would be at a disadvantage. And as a matter of fact people will still use spy even after this nerf.
---
So, did it work?
---
ok, it's getting tedious even talking to you at this point.  Gonna have to put you on mute.  Read through the thread to understand what is being discussed.  You're also the worst type of person, "Everything's fine on my end so I don't see what the problem is," lol clueless.
---
Just gives me an even closer range to know where you are. If it went from 200m distance to 50m distance, my estimate of your stealth location got 16x better.
---
What if instead of Frostwolf retreat you had Dark Trolls aligned with the Horde as they would inherently oppose the Kaldorei
---
They took'yer gold!!!
---
i dunno what this is but uhh....that sounds shitty dude.
---
Feared into whelp cave? More like “accidentally” falling into the whelp cave from accidentally jumping around before pull on top of the ramp and wiping the raid before even the first pull
---
PvP deaths don't take durability.
---
Some people really care about their DPS.
---
It also shows raid leads who is slacking and who isn't
---
Yeah, I also said emptier. I want the world to be packed at all times. I don't want the people doing battlegrounds to be removed from the world temporarily, I want them to contest farming spots and resources inbetween matches. Right now everything feels packed, but I suspect there will be a natural decrease of players as people quit. I don't expect a 15 year old game to be able to maintain player interest at these levels for the next year, but I'll be happy to be proven wrong. Plus it's going to get harder and harder for new players to join and catch up as classic progresses, which will also impact the overall population.
---
ban all addons
---
If I keep attacking the hunters "dead body" will it break the feign death?
---
Honestly I don't know at which times you are playing. https://imgur.com/a/tvtmsl7 This sight is basically a constant whenever I'm in DM. I get killed every second time I finish a DM East run. I get killed in front of DM or in front of Camp Mojache. My mate got hardcamped in front of Mojache at 3am. 
---
I know the Alliance is outnumbered, but for some reason they just keep on murdering me wherever I am.
---
so horde is fine right?
---
how much mana and +heal should a 60 resto Druid have when stepping into mc for the first time?
---
My understanding is that attacking the other faction is what removes honorless target; the trick here is they are in a duel so that only the priest and his party member/dueler receive the honor, instead of it being split between all the alliance there.
---
No melee basically, all mages and hunters doing the dps, and the tank can be solo controlled by using the arrow keys and mouse
---
The deposit is incredibly small though. It’s only the ah cut that is quite expensive, and that only happens if the item sells.
---
I feel like if someone bids you shouldn’t be able to remove it. For example in the real world like eBay if someone bids you have to sell it basically. There’s a cancellation fee and you get big seller rep damage if you cancel on eBay
---
All the idiots who claimed nothing would be done about the Spy addon - get fucked.
---
50 yard range is pretty small. If it truly works this is pretty big change.
---
The current spy works at nearly 200yards which is larger than rendering distance for player models. 
---
Aimshot is 35yard range hunters mark is 100yd range. Can see why spy would be a problem when it provides more valuable tracking than hunters mark.
---
The whole point of a pve server is to be able to better focus on the pve content.
---
That's not casual
---
lol you havent been paying attention, people are spotting me on my rouge 80-100 yds
---
hello AT&amp;T
---
It's going to be so funny when these super horde dominated tryhard servers have trouble opening AQ.
---
What he said - Drain tank is the most efficient way to level. Once 60 you can go SM/DS Ruin. If you use these specs while leveling you will be drinking nearly every pull.
---
They were introduced with the TBC prepatch i think.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_2.0.1
---
Switch alliance so the game has a real future. The imbalance is gonna kill the game
---
Yup! Definitely have seen more instant queues on my alliance toons, but have also experienced many on horde side as well.
---
A lot of the thread hasn't been throwing that at you. I sure haven't. You sure you're capable of mature discussion?
---
Alliance players here advocated moving from currently low Ally servers to already Ally dominated servers. In other words "we can exacerbate the problem if it's in our favor".
---
They dont care about "fairness" or anything, they just cant take the idea of losing at all. Maybe that's why Horde lacks empathy, we're ok with dying in PVP.
---
I play Rogue, dont care at all about people using this addon, it even helped with playing mind games on people.
---
this wont have much effect on meters, anyone in melee range will accurately get all the DPS data, though they even said that raids arent going to be affected.
---
I've used Grid2 and Vuhdo, Vuhdo has infinitely more customization options than Grid2 does.
---
Yep you are absolutely right, I wasn’t exposed  to succ tanking before that so I had no idea how much better it is
---
Not only that, its not 60 specific. Who care about overall pop? Its about 60’s
---
I honestly hope the addon creator finds a way to extend range, and blizz breaks their addon for good the next time
---
thanks. then it won't be a problem. I won't switch for now!
---
&gt; whether I stay or not
---
How do aggregates work lol
---
alliance will be fine once BGs hit. Alliance are very strong in BGs
---
and it fucking needs to be, thank god
---
The important thing is that you're different and better. As long as you keep that narrative going you'll be fine no matter what.
---
Raids are piss easy. I dont use any addons because like... what fucking mechanics are there? 
---
This arguement is a fucking joke. Spy is game breaking for other players. The game would get on fine without DBM or damage meters they are just trivializing and ego strokers anyway so who fucking cares.
---
It's a pet you'll have for the entirety of classic. It's definitely worth camping for if you're at all interested in PvP. A difference of 0.2 may seem small but itll add extra pushback to spells
---
Thank you kind redditor. I just got done reading the post and was going to post a mean comment, but thanks to you going as far as checking his posting history, and thus revealing that this post is indeed sarcastic and not serious, you have saved me the trouble of having to write a long response.
---
RP is dead in Classic. Its not there on BB and certainly not on Grobb
---
As a Horde, Mograine feels pretty balanced. If anything I feel like the alliance are better organized and motivated to dominate the common pvp places. With a lot of tryhard rogues camping the bulwark and UC. Then again I dont know what goes on in the alliance zones so maybe they have it worse.
---
thats not up to us, thats up to the company we collectively give like 15 million dollars a month
---
Honestly, running away from a fight and hiding from fights were genuine skills in vanilla. Not just skills, it was a massive part of pvp in general due to the combat system and pacing etc. You could reset a fight by hiding and eating etc, people could hide in plain sight if they had a good enough spot and players could run past them without knowing they were there.
---
This add-on just removes that entire concept from the game, it fundamentally changes classic wow pvp.
---
Keep seeing people defending it saying stuff like "it's nothing you couldn't already do with your combat log". Lmao that's such bs. Did people play with their combat logs open pretty regularly? Yeah sure. Were the huge majority of players constantly scanning their combat logs and quickly typing names of players 100 yards away so they can go chase them down? Yeah fucking right lmao. You literally just get a beep and then you can click the person's god damn name lol.
---
&gt; Honestly whitemane is pretty damned balanced.
---
No.
---
correct, but why do i need to know some random mage's threat?  all i care about are tanks
---
So youd prefer someone to get invited inspected at the instance and kicked for having shit gear? Id prefer someone to just tell me no before i waste my time getting there
---
In any other game this addon would be called ESP... and is a wallhack... lmao
---
Yeah, you do know you can direct your tab target by pointing your camera at the the target you want to tab, right? It will first target the nearest guy you have your camera pointed towards, then cycle through if you don't move your camera angle.
---
Using private servers as your source of what is right and wrong with Classic has also proven to be misleading.
---
&gt;  game is legitimately worse than the original product
---
It's not. They reduced the render distance so that it was the same as Vanilla. If they didn't change it, it would've been like retail, meaning almost double the render distance.
---
or it doesnt affect raids?  
---
also, if youre in melee range of ragnaros you will definitely be within 50 yds of everyone
---
Clearly its Mankrik
---
horde mentality on display ^^
---
Doesn't matter how many millions they have they are still bound by the rules of logic.  How would you alter the game to "fix" spy?
---
the fact that they can just get semi- near you and mind vision is so fucking broken.  
---
Sounds like you were in searing gorge, they came down to kill me after I kept setting off their spy from below
---
More so raids since you'll be grouped with 4 other melee dps for trueshot anyway. Instances a cat will be better for a bit more dps
---
YES. As a non-stealth class (Priest, ripe for ganking)... being able to navigate a quest mob area and hide, pull things into buildings or around corners etc to stay out of sight is absolutely a skill.
---
People not realizing you’re talking about the hammer not the fucking totem
---
just because blizzard did it doesnt mean it was right, just look at retail
---
No we didn't. That might have been a thing for you but certainly not for me. Even my 512 MB Alienware Area 51 with 2004 cable internet didn't load people that slow. I have never once heard or seen anyone describe a epic mount being able to juke someone like that. You must have been playing on 56k with a 1998 compaq.
---
I was saying this in every thread complaining about spy but people didn't care I guess.
---
I mean my range for spells is 36 yards so it is kind of terrible if I am kiting and can't see what's going on. Which I do a lot as a druid.
---
Also not being able to see what people are casting or what buffs are gained just out of spell range is dumb. Same with breaking damage meters in raids.
---
This is really scummy, imo.
---
Or you could just not be a cunt, and go read the ancient ass comments for them on WoW Head where it's been answered a million times, and has a nice little version stamp to tell you what version of the game was live when they posted.
---
At 50yrds I dont think it will impact to bad. There are more game breaking BG addons. Like I cant remember the name but there is one that gives you targeting plates for the entire enemy team. People will use something like that over spy since it can pull the name/server from the BG scoreboard and basically just give you a /target overall of all of them.
---
I loved it too despite the fact that it didn’t make any sense.
---
poggers in chatuh!
---
It's cause they changed this last week, iirc it was the Tuesday. It's related to their servers not being able to handle PvP battles
---
Feel for you man. I will like and subscribe to your Reddit profile, anything to help a brother out.
---
I think that the combat log should only be able to see things in your direct LoS. If someone stealths off-camera, even if it’s near you, you shouldn’t be able to know about it. I understand that this would hurt damage meter addons, but it’s a compromise I’d personally be happy with.
---
your casters will get bumped as well.... You won't have the dps to kill him if half of your raid is out of position
---
I would create two combat logs. The first would register all PvE events and function exactly as the existing log does, with the same access for addons etc. The second would be for all player interactions and we would not have access to it. The WoW client could still read it of course, meaning that it wouldn't break anything in actual game play. 
---
From there you can pass events that you want players to have access to in to the normal combat log, or give API access to addons. For example you could just not provide entries for other players entering or leaving stealth. Or you could restrict those entries by distance or anything else.
---
By separating the data you effectively get full granular permissions to all events and can pick and choose exactly who can see what and when.
---
I liked archud back in vanilla
---
Isnt it a win for both factions by that logic then? Horde cant loot either
---
Have the combat log only show enemy players if they attack/interact with the opposite faction. That way nobody on the other faction is being alerted if you just sit and drink, go stealth, or cast a single spell at an NPC.
---
There, problem solved. Doesn't affect PvE at all, and stops PvP abuse.
---
No, this was confirmed as working as intended in the beta IIRC
---
Holy crap I'm actually doing this quest right now and thank you so much.
---
Sounds like someone is salty. The run back is 30 seconds or less. Also in a game where dying doesn’t penalize you at all how did we not win? We’re farming honor and got 1000 in less than 5 minutes. Care to translate what that would be if we did this 4 times an hour?  More honor than you are gaining
---
Why? If I made a mistake I made a mistake. I'm taking it back. Fuck off thinking you are entitled to a freebie.
---
exactly. in other mmos there are no threat meters. it means dps has to hold back if they think they are doing too much damage. addons basically play the game for you.
---
I don't think it will, honestly.
---
I blame streamer and youtube culture for giving incentive to grieving other players and in general playing with a toxic view. The people who are fighting other 60's in farming areas aren't the problem.
---
The problem are guilds that spend all day camping fp's and lowbie areas. They aren't farming hk or doing it for any good reason. They just like to be assholes.
---
"Waaah but how can we grief the Alliance if they move to servers where there would be rough faction balance?!?"
---
I only started seeing Paladin tanks in late game dungeons (Strat/Scholo) and they've been great tanks every time. It's a seriously underrated class for tanking.
---
Agreed lol
---
My comment was not related to the combat log change. It was related to you being condescending about how I like to play the game. 
---
Uh, Walnut.
---
What I read here was saying blizz dropped view in classic to lower than what vanilla had because the engine can't handle classics graphical upgrades. Don't know. I know the distance for me is smaller now than it was back then
---
It’s what happens when RP servers take over your life 😬
---
I’m guessing they won’t combine all realms, because it could introduce some extra lag. 
---
Could combine all in each region as a starting point.
---
They don't spawn super often. And the other way to get them (farming high level water elementals) has a very low drop rate. Also just high demand. Like elemental fire is stupid easy to farm from many different sources and is still going for like 7g a pop just due to demand
---
How is that different than Spy?
---
Shaman I just listen to nature sounds and whales
---
Painful for the mod developers, not the wider community. Might mean some extra work, but it is literally a "solution" - yes.
---
Buzzer beater
---
lmao you triggered people.
---
“Good hustle”
---
 *slaps guys ass
---
“Yo I’m not on your team!”
---
He cant. Horde cant read.
---
My buddy is lvl55. His default state is now in ghost form outside BRD instance portal, spamming LFG for groups, alt tabbing every so often for updates. So that if he does get a group he can just rez and hop in without having to slog through the death gauntlet just to do a dungeon lol. Most of the time he's playing another game
---
was 12
---
now I'm 23
---
It's not an assumption when you're still responding to me even though we're off topic lmao, but whatever man.
---
Just play cookie clicker if thats your mindset.
---
How do you see enemies on the mini map?
---
Big true
---
Now 50 yards name plates? or at least the range of my skills?
---
Just ban the add on already. Most people I know dont like it but use it because not to use it in the age of honor is honestly a huge disadvantage. The Arron is completely against the spirit of the game imo.
---
I'm sure most people would happily say that, but if you think a lot of people won't leap at the ability to turn on an addon that does a ton of the work for them you're insane.
---
I was gonna say, I thought in Vanilla everyone needed the same version of recount to get accurate numbers even...
---
One of my friends in the group I play with has rerolled around four times from Lock, Priest, Hunter, to finally end up with Druid (hopefully he sticks with it). All these characters got to around 30+ until he decided it wasn’t the right fit. In my opinion you should be supportive of them especially since you want to keep playing with him. For some people motivation sets in to catch up to their friends as mine is doing right now. I hit 60 first due to my periodic no life tendencies and it is nice being able to help all my friends through rough times like certain elite quests, or annoying gankers. He’s now approaching my level 45 warrior alt, so having a healer and tank for dungeons makes things happen much faster! 
---
tldr: Be supportive of your buddy! After all, you want them to enjoy the game like you do!
---
Really? You don't say?
---
Either have tracking, humanoid etc. Have the person targeted. Or hunters marked. Spy allowed you to target the player at nearly 200 yards. Meaning it was much easier to locate people.
---
I couldn't get my mount at 40 on my hunter because I invested heavily in professions and just used too much gold.
---
The good thing is that after level 40 gold gets a lot easier to get, weapon quest rewards and grey drops and stuff sell for a lot so it only takes a short while to get it then.
---
It's laughable what's happening at the moment, hundreds of people appearing out of nowhere. Im tracking as a hunter and i don't even see them on the map before they all appear.
---
That’s a really strange build. 
---
Natures grasp, at least one point, is super good for PvP. 
---
For feral tree do you not spend any time in cat form? And do you want to tank? Those points seem wasted. 
---
Resto tree if there is another Druid in the raid your rejuv will be worthless with only two points. You could take some out of regrowth and move them around for better raid function and PvP abilities
---
Other MMOs aren't classic wow though. You legitimately can't tell when you'll pull threat because you don't have an idea how much threat a tank is generating.. Add-ons really don't play the game for you but whatever
---
That's the point....
---
There are easier ways to reset than a corpse run.
---
For very niche specs it can be viable
---
This is basically exactly how we got to BFA.
---
The community gets "outraged" at something and Blizzard listens and changes things without anyone thinking of the consequences.
---
Now we just need to push for the removal of an "on click action on an addon performing a macro", as this was also not possible in vanilla (like WA conditionals being click for action - don't think you could do that till wod or legion)
---
you rarely see horde out there alone, its usually groups of at least 3. so theyre taking the chance to get high honor kills.  
---
and for the camping, guess its pure frustration and even revenge after having experienced being ganked from lvl20 on in mostly 2vs1 and 3vs1 etc. .  
---
and for getting killed every second time you finish:  try playing alliance, we have to die our way into dungeons since we can go to dungeons, we get ganked everywhere, our flightmasters are perma dead in menethil, southshore, thorium point etc..  
---
if getting killed 2 times within 2 hours upsets you, youre being irrational
---
Yes, I don't have a reference point to see if it is happening in other games which would make me think it is my computer.
---
I think the problem is that dodging in PvP against warriors is a bad time. Now if it was parry....
---
Imagine wanting your game to be this boring
---
A lot of the rogue BiS gear is from questing or deadmines. You can get cruel bars with double fiery and be decent
---
Spy tracks and reports *your* location - ie your coordinates when you detect an enemy player. An external log monitor would not be able to do this because it wouldn't have access to your location.
---
Dude had a flask on
---
Imagine being a whiny shitter and willing to admit they would rather buy gold... People like you is exactly why classic exists and why whiny shitters like you won't stick around to play it.
---
Go back to retail.
---
Yeeeeahhh... no. In vanilla macros did much much more. Like as in they could basically play the game for you.
---
The WoW devs even very specifically mentioned in an interview leading to classic about how the extensive macroing abilities would not be returning for this very specific reason.
---
This. The amount of cancerous flight path ganking is ruining things. Hell even the horde in Winterspring are attacking in the town, they dont care about the guards.
---
the faction queues would be there to incentivize faction swaps. maybe they're not really necessary though. as for all specifics of how they would work i can't really say.
---
Wrong spot, wrong time buddy
---
What is this meth fueled nonsense?
---
Not what I said
---
He’s hot tho. I’d smash
---
If you had to pick between [mirahs song](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=15806/mirahs-song)
---
 and [dal rends tribal guardian](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12939/dalrends-tribal-guardian) for a DPS warrior which one would you pick?
---
I feel like Blizzard should add a good pvp race to the ally to help even things out
---
Do you not understand how dates work?  How about versions?
---
2.01 is TBC.
---
1.x is Vanilla.
---
Vanilla was before TBC.
---
Just ban the damn add on instead of messing with meters etc. how hard is it to ban an add on that actually is so dumb. If you’re flanking someone or behind an object you should have the advantage. It shouldn’t babysit you anyway. 
---
Just imagine in wsg where you enter flag room and can click on enemy fc. to see where he is. You can raid target after clicking to see his exact location.
---
Was this realm first Sulfuras or something?
---
This is good stuff, that can be further expanded with macros to reduce bar clutter. 
---
    #showtooltip
---
    /use [mod:shift]Flash Heal(Rank 7);Flash Heal(Rank 1)
---
Throw that on slot 3 and you've consolidated your action bar. As a shaman I've got most of my totems into 4 bars using nomod, crtl, alt and shift modifiers. All of my shocks are on one bar as well. Just don't go too crazy lol. Also keep in mind you'll have to unbind  action bar page key binds (shift 1-4).
---
Horde in fairbanks is very strong!
---
Holy shit, I can't imagine leveling without the succubus.
---
It literally does affect raids, how is this even a question?
---
question,how was your addons since the combat log fix,was long range threat effected at all?
---
So you're saying that they changed it from reflecting hunter frost traps, to immuning them, then back to reflecting them in tbc?  
---
Do you not understand that tbc came after 1.12, so changes made for 1.12 would be reflected in tbc content?
---
He non crit me for 3700
---
Building a PC is pretty easy. Connectors only ever fit in one spot and the motherboard manuals show you how to connect any of the more finicky stuff. 
---
Use something like the below as a reference box. It's way way overpowered for WoW. You'll save about 15-20% by buying and building yourself.
---

---
Then: heard about the game, but I was the "good" boy, read books instead as mom said
---
Now: oh cool, murloc sound is like in Hearthstone!
---
You jumped I bet
---
This change is categorically broken. Hunters are able to take actions outside of combat log range. In what world does that make sense.
---
Have to upvote,love your boomer discord comment bro, haha
---
Classic classic will be better
---
let's all switch back to warcraft 3
---
that was the idea behind the EPL flightpath but that’s not until P6
---
(Horde side) greatly enjoyed my time on Mankrik. Haven't seen much toxicity which is amazing. Lots of guild raiding/recruiting/pugs and beeing a pve server is nice since you can lvl in peace and not once, since honor was realeased, have I not seen active pvp in South shore/Tauren Mill if you're bored.
---
Oh no things exist in the combat log, no skill alert.
---
You stating the NPC mechanic AI is different on a pve server?
---
&gt; Why should the player be alerted if you're casting something they can't see in their field of vision.
---
Hearing, I guess. If some warrior is running around making no effort to be quiet, you're going to know they're out there. If they suddenly go silent, you can reasonably infer that they've stealthed. It's just like being a parent, really. If your kids go quiet, it's time to investigate. :)
---
Honestly? I try to have different music for different areas. Sultans of Swing on repeat for BRD and this bad boy whenever flying https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=G1IbRujko-A
---
dont trust what anyone says,we dont know what the que times for horde will be. it will depend on how they do it.
---
**if its region cross realm, you should be safe. but for battlegroups from the pre cata era,good luck....the horde to alliance ratio some servers will make your que stupidly long.**
---
Plus as a past warrior, I'd always rather take sword or axe spec in the back of my mind
---
Inb4 someone complains you wasted vanish not understanding that vanish puts you at stealth level 1060 making it impossible to spot you by normal means.
---
Literally this whole sub is salty alliance shitposting, he's not wrong
---
I have spent countless hours trying to jump to the top of the fountain. This time it miraculously worked.
---
It literally affects dps and threat addons. You just dont care.
---
Oh dear. So let me get this straight.. an addons completely removes a **huge** part of the skill of world PvP and negates a ton of class abilities... but the problem is the people who point this out, not those who abuse it?
---
You did this to yourself buddy.
---
Swords have the best stun chain which is pretty good for pvp. You can still stun lock with a dagger but it’s harder and just not as effective. Both specs are perfectly viable in pve content. Swords is a bit better for pvp.
---
Then: 20 year old lady college student who games way too much
---
Now:  34 year old Spanish teacher working on his second master's degree.  Still games way too much, but has a wife and kids Lol.
---
First time WoW player and tried to do this quest a few days ago, had a bad time.
---
I think there would be a market for the original World of Warcraft.
---
Yes it had warts; but we like the warts.
---
Fairbanks seems good.. i’m leveling in Hillsbrad as Horde and i get killed a lot but there’s plenty of action on both sides with people calling in backup.. reasonable and fairly balanced stuff
---
I always wanted the Dreadnought set. Maybe one day.
---
So closer but not accurate. Because accurate is further than 50 yards.
---
Blizzard hasn't said.
---
Yes. It does
---
Donations influencing loot council sounds horrible.
---
Lmao I find myself just jumping around waiting for groups and I’ve never made it to the top of the fountain
---
We justify it by it being closer not correct. Either make it correct or stop caving to people who cry.
---
why didn’t you roll on a PvE server?
---
the PVP is amazing. It makes the world feel more alive in then any game.
---
Look at richie rich with his alienware computer
---
And everyone wondered why their shitty computer was having problems 🤣
---
Needing to parse a raw stream of text through a regular chat channel is a whole hell of a lot more resource intensive compared to the structured combat log API. 
---
I do really remember dmg meters being intensive addons back in the day.
---
Don't expect him to ever see those fights, he is so sure this won't affect anything.
---
I was sad on vanilla when they added cross server but I didnt have a bg queue of more than a couple minutes back then
---
Which shouldn't come as a shock to anyone. Roleplayers have every reason to play the latest version of the game. Ot's built to accommodate RP.
---
Transmog, a huge range of cosmetic options, a modern feature rich interface... not to mention more than a decade's worth of expansion packs that expanded the warcraft universe.
---
I'm sure there are active efforts to RP on the classic RP realms but the vast majority of RPers have little motivation to play classic over the current expansion.
---
 Don't use serpent sting.
---
And broke dozens of other addons just like Blizzard did. Your resume isn't looking good.
---
someone can quote me if im wrong on this,but they had to put classic wow on the legion engine I belive to get it to work through [battle.net](https://battle.net).  have you been able to play retail BFA or legion on your PC? because that might be the tell tell sign right there. 
---
I know classic has the basic of basic graphics,but the engline itself....might require much better pc's.
---
i dont mind, dont like them much anyway
---
You didn't say anything other than that it's impossible to balance. Don't move goalposts. That's a logical fallacy.
---
Closer isn't the same, this is still changes.
---
I want my 5 gold back, you told.
---
So if we don't have exact values, we should default to retail?  What kind of crazy logic is that?
---
Hi, um...out of curiosity...lazy college student? Otherwise that second part was a winding road.
---
Either way, ins't it funny teaching a class and randomly thinking about how bad it sucks that you just can't get HoJ to drop for the life of you?
---
That’s not playing at all. Your solution is to stop playing. Some people only have an hour or two at a time. Telling them not to play for 10-15 minutes is not an option when they want to just play the game.
---
this isn’t “new”. people have been doing it for years
---
I think it's hyperbole
---
isn't satire supposed to be funny? this just reeks of someone red-faced, typing angrily on the toilet
---
No we should default to what vanilla had. This isn't what vanilla had by Blizzard own admission.
---
It affects your ability to brag about dps INSTANTLY, thats about it, and you can still parse if you REALLY want to see, and there are addons to parse in real time and see a boss report right after it happens without even logging out.  
---
If you cant raid MC without addons, you just cant raid period lol.
---
Haha this is exactly what happened to me
---
Get out of there!
---
But its closer to what vanilla had.  So that's some how worse than what we had before?
---
This addon existed in vanilla, get over it. If you want to be coddled go back to arenas in retail. Even this change isn't accurate to vanilla.
---
Did you read the article? It wont change anything.
---
MY DAMAGE METER IS INACCURATE THIS IS UNPLAYABLE  
---
lol if you cant raid MC without addons, you just cant raid at all.
---
Haha, I think about random stuff like that all the time during classes.
---
Tell that to my boys who served in 'Nam. :(
---
Nah a few other warriors have it. First Shaman I've seen with it though.
---
Could you spec hemo with swords as a rogue? Is that viable? What would the hemo sword rogue build look like?
---
After king is dead nothing except the guards/insects will attack you. After you get king buff the guards turn friendly aswell
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5Hecfgf1q0](Not exactly new)
---
More dots
---
You mean addons which aren't even part of the game that alter the game to make it easier and more 'accessible'? Kinda like what made retail shit?
---
You see the hypocrisy or do I need to stamp it on your forehead?
---
Then: dropping out of university due to WoW and drug addiction. 
---
Now: Airline pilot. Married with kids, own my own home and savings to put my kids through private school. 
---
I owe the change in my lifestyle during down to WoW becoming complete shit after BC and no longer playable for me
---
Your last sentence is wrong. 
---
They did a shitload of reworks when TBC came out.  They also reworked in 1.12 how freezing trap works with its diminishing returns, which was changed again when TBC came out.  (This is the reason people keep crying about scatter shot+freezing trap combos here.)  It's not surprising then that at one point it did reflect in Vanilla, and then didn't anymore, and was once again reflecting after Vanilla. 
---
See, it's OK for you to acknowledge that there are people out there that actually do know more than you.  So when multiple people in this very thread tell you it works a specific way, you look like an ass when you pull up your pserver message boards and tell them they're wrong.
---
I never said I needed it you made that implication. What I contest is your claim that it wont affect damage meters because no fight is far enough away. News flash there are multiple fights in the game right now that it affects.
---
Bgs are cross server it wont matter
---
Guild leader hasn't logged on for two weeks. Was also raid leading. 
---
also trying to figure out who gets a raid spot or not
---
Has this actually happened to you? I sincerely doubt people are kicked after arriving at an instance. Your shitty example isn’t applicable.
---
That sweet sweet MC loot. The feeling I got when I won the roll for [Finkle's Lava Dredger](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18803/finkles-lava-dredger) was one of my favorite MMO moments.
---
I played on a TBC pserver for many years and I can't wait for it. It's so much better in many ways.
---
almost no one realized this information was in the combat log before this addon abused that information. This shit is game breaking. The world pvp is not like anything before, there has never been a time where people ran through a zone killing literally every player no matter what they try to do to hide.  
---
If you think that spy doesnt fuck up the game you are blind
---
Do you understand how addons work? Details, recount and other addons like them use the ingame combat log that was just nerfed. Those will not see everything in large area fights like Ragnaros, Onyxia, Huhuran, Twin Emps, C'thun, 4H, Saphiron.
---
Yet in another comment in this same thread calling it a cheat program it's upvoted.
---
These people make no sense.
---
Yes as far as I remember combat log was 100yards in vanilla. So it jumped over vanilla and went to a small number.
---
Rogues that stick around are bad at PvP.
---
You are the one claiming it doesn't affect addons. You can't even keep your bullshit straight.
---
Spell crit effects heals?
---
Who’s actually crying here though? Lol
---
I had this idea of making a WoW Classic PvP video just for the fun of it while leveling, and this is what i came up with.  What you'll see here : Garroting, mutilating, mangling, slice and dicing, poisoning, decapitating and that very special  je ne sais quoi - eviscerating, Alliance players that are trying to level up.  Mind you, this is a video in celebration of the P2 launch, so there's more to come! And using the proverbial YouTube drivel - be sure to tell me what ya think, like and subscribe! :)
---
you opened a can of worms,expect to see plenty"your on a pvp server yes its legal u don't like it quit" comments. but yes, it is legal to do since your technically using game mechanics to your advance.
---
its insanely scummy,but that's the mo for 90% of people on a pvp server,but your also to find,no one on a pvp server has any sort of morale's to begin with.
---
Absolutely. Less people from guild or my friends list are on and the Lookingforgroup channel seems quieter.
---
And from what I can tell from my Battle.net friends list, people haven't migrated to other servers as they're online in the app but not playing wow. I've cancelled my sub and I'm going to wait until BGs to see how the servers look (wow classic is the first MMO i've gotten into somewhere seriously so have no idea what BGs are and if they'll help, just going off from what the sub has been saying).
---
On a somewhat positive note, Fallen order, RDR2, Halo MCC and Cyberpunk 2077 are out/coming out soon and I pretty much wrote them off for these holidays. I guess now I'll have time for them, but I'd rather be playing classic wow pre phase 2... First world problems.
---
I can’t offer specifics on specs unfortunately. I just know that the dagger rogues in my guild have started pushing to get swords from MC (brutality blade) because of how dominating swords stun chain is. They made a case to the loot council for a priority change and it was granted.
---
People always knew this stuff existed in combat logs. Watch old PVP videos and you will see all the top tier players ran with their combat logs up and filtered to see exactly what they needed.
---
As far as you remember, got it.  I don't even remember elemental invasions, we should just remove those.
---
Ahahahahaha.
---
The combat log did not work even close to how it does now compared to vanilla and this is addressed **literally in the link this post goes to.**
---
So yes. The addon existed. And it's just been nerfed so that it only works as well as it did in vanilla. Get over it.
---
Well i heard there is this place called retail, and you can level to 120 there! There are even charity epics and legendaries, and you can be a panda, you should try it out, I hear it runs best when you uninstall classic wow first.  
---
Oh weird, its like they had to rerelease the original game because they fucked it up
---
Gets called shitty.  Immediately starts acting shitty.  Checks out.
---
ye
---
The combat log range was not 50 yards in vanilla. This addon does not work like it did in vanilla. Blizzards own post says this. How about you read it before asking me to read it.
---
Frost trap isn't AoE.  The reflectors don't work onAoE spells iirc.
---
its 55/45 according to any form of data you can collect out there. even the discord is 45/55. I don't think its 70/30, alliance has some of the best guilds on the realm and a shit ton of players. But hey I may be wrong.
---
You milk them to show your appreciation.
---
Ban chat logs while we are at it too
---
And auction houses
---
Meant if your guild got the kill
---
Again, absolutely no source, spouting off a bunch of info that is no better than the source less wowhead comments.   
---
There hasn't been a single sourced comment in this thread.   
---
You have shown absolutely nothing about anything to anyone.   
---
I'm trying to form an opinion based on facts, which you are not providing, but somehow I'm arguing against you enough for you to think I'm claiming to know anything about this, when i asked the fucking question in the first place.  
---
You're an insufferable cunt. You are exactly why people don't ask questions online. I have literally no fucking idea about this, so i asked a question, and somehow you've turned it into me being wrong, when I dont even have any information and am seeking some out. If i had a fucking answer to my own question, i wouldnt have asked it. I linked forums because that's all i can find for "evidence". I didn't say anywhere "Well this is how it should work" because i didn't know. How fucking stupid can you be. The only one dumber than you in this thread is me for engaging with an absolute invalid.
---
Take it up with blizzard dude, why the fuck are you screaming this at me? I wasn’t giving a permanent solution, it’s a suggestion given the very finite circumstances of the original post. The dude said he got killed by 4 people until he wasn’t worth honor. I’m sorry but that’s just beating your head into a fucking wall. A minimum of 12deaths. Stop white knighting, just fucking looking for someone to be mad at.
---
And again you just make up shit, I never said it was a solution, but a suggestion... best part about a suggestion, you can ignore it if you want to. Annnnd I said 5-10, not 10-15. But that’s nitpicking.
---
This is not true.  Two reaver packs near the guards are already aggro.
---
&gt; This is closer to the original behavior of WoW 1.12, and should eliminate the ability for addons to extend players’ senses and detect enemy actions at a greater distance than intended.
---
Here you go, we can read it together!
---
Correction- in most instances it better to swim,
---
But, also that and if your low level you will pull the adds in water
---
Wrong, nameplate range was 20 yards until WOTLK.
---
I want it to work like Vanilla did.
---
I said it does not affect RAIDS, because RAIDS dont need ADDONS to perform the functions necesary to RAID.  
---
please learn to READ
---
It's a wall hack. And this is coming from a mage who surely benefits more than some classes. Sure it's nice to know someone is coming but really hurts the immersion. Don't get me started on gank squads running around using spy. Really lame when there's nowhere to hide.
---
Nah. It’s just the wishful thinking of salty Alliance players.
---
Bezelbub - bleamoux something or another lmfao
---
Ahh I see, my bad, I get 2.0 changes mixed in sometimes, I spent more time playing a post 2.0 wow than a pre 2.0 wow after all, 
---
My point is that the functionality that spy / WA and any other addon that allows you to perform a macro action via a click should not exist, like casting a specific spell based on a set of conditions or targeting a specific player based on a set of conditions, this was not at all possible in 2.0, 3.0, and possibly even 4.0,
---
I'm still confused at why this functionality was even allowed into retail in the first place
---
Congrats!!!!!! 
---
I am lvl 49 on my Night Elf Warrior, the grind must go on
---
&gt; You can't tell threat based off just playing, nor can you just tell the damage.
---
You've never played an MMO before WoW, have you?
---
There were no damage meters in EQ back in 1999. Over aggro there and you died. That was the damage meter.
---
Ok so it is still not like vanilla. And the vanilla combat log was more than 50 yards, so this is still not accurate to vanilla. If the logs were 100 yards in vanilla and were 200 yards before this change, 50 is closer than 100 but significantly different.
---
Actually it helped raids hunting just about everyone in the zone regardless of your hiding spot. This change was one of the important ones regarding world pvp.
---
ele best spec hands down
---
 /who
---
top tier players (&lt;1% of players) used this all the time  
---
wow thanks for proving my point lol, the small percentage who really pushed the game to their limits used this, and they still can with the reduced range (which they even said is more like it was in actual vanilla)  
---
Im sure you will have a hard time now without your easy 1 click find all enemies, but thats okay
---
Multiple people told you how it worked and all you did is cry and bitch about it.
---
Theyre not crossing though... theyre all ending/beginning at the same point.
---
This change to how addons work in raids doesn't affect raids. What the hell kind of logic is that?
---
45
---
gotta admit,im impressed...I expected a video of a level 60 killing lowibes,but you fought people around your own level and not lower.....that last fight though of your 2v1 against the mage and rogue,no clue how the hell you won that one though lol
---
So you are pretending it didn't happen to make your point. Got it.
---
Well not within 2 hours. Within 2 hours I died a total of 6 times. 
---
That said, I'm rarely on the overworld. I haven't yet been to menethil and I haven't visited Thorium Point for the past 4 weeks or so.
---
If you're dying to fire damage and can't dps due to being dead, I'd say yeah, slap on some more FR.
---
The path of only melee needing FR is only true if A) your group is using a certain tactic on the Rag fight, and B) certain people are doing their jobs well.
---
It's like the PvE back-and-forth that people have had disagreements about since *launch*, basically. Livability stuff (stamina, resists, mobility) doesn't directly affect your DPS. But if you die, then all the sudden it affects your DPS very much indeed. For the Rag fight, all the damage is I think like 99% fire based. So any FR you can slap on that doesn't suck your dps down too badly is great. I think back in retail the rule of thumb was 300 FR for tank, 200 for melee, and 100 for everyone else. Now that people know the fight more and are more experienced, I think that's probably much more ambitious a goal then necessary, but it should give you an idea of what the fight is like.
---
Why can't horde just fight without definitive numbers advantages? Almost all PvP servers you outnumber 2:1 already.
---
It's not blizzard, it's just the classic team. And for all the bitching in this subteddit over the last 2 years, they have listened incredibly well and put in their best work for such a small team that's underneath a stupid greedy corporation.
---
Also rerolled from Stalagg as horde.
---
It's a legitimately useful feature in that if you know the range of spy, you know that a particular enemy is in an x yard radius of where you were when spy detected them. So it helps you deduce the location of/hunt down enemy players.
---
I also think that the main gripe with spy is that it pays attention to the world for you so that you don't have to be aware of enemy players and potentially dangerous situations while you're playing. Having a dozen little features that make it easier to detect players would contribute to this function even though no individual feature is particularly threatening, no?
---
It's a potential solution for sure, but it isn't a particularly good answer. Especially for the more casually oriented players, and why shouldn't they complain? They are getting fucked here... the questing experience made the game for many of these players. It's a shame that the current robotic camping invalidates their classic experience.
---
I've said this elsewhere, but I understand hearing others whine can be annoying. But try to be empathetic and realize how annoying it is to be camped in the current state of the game and have little place to vent. Let's try to be an inclusive community.
---
Those are features placed in the game by the developers,  not third party sources.
---
Just reroll already.
---
It's absolutely clear that PvP players are asshats, whether Horde or Alliance (no, really. Go make a Horde toon on Heartseeker and tell me how it goes), so *nothing* Blizzard does will help.
---
If you don't want to be griefed, don't roll on a PvP server.
---
If you want actual open world PvP, roll on a PvE server and permaflag.
---
thats actually awesome.  i wanna see a pally in full tier 2 with hand of rag.  would look baller as hell
---
I picture you saying this while steamrolling mid-50s in Searing Gorge.
---
Hitting 60 is no small feat in Classic, congratulations! I’m 52 right now, and I already feel how far I’ve come. From killing plainstriders in Mulgore, to killing dinosaurs in Un’Goro.
---
Heal or gtfo
---
Only viable option in pve (and very good)
---
Absolutely bonkers OP in pvp (especially paired with warriors)
---
The engine classic uses is the legion engine, not the vanilla engine, so the render distance could definitely be supported
---
multiple people with no sources to back them up, so I wasn't about to put all my faith into "he said she said" or I would have just believed the forums i read.  
---
You're getting ignored now, you're not worth the effort of typing up these replies.
---
That was a thing I remember as well
---
sounds like a forsaken's cookbook,no wonder slyvannas went crazy 10 years later lol
---
I went the opposite direction. So few flight paths...
---
If you are in melee range, you are guaranteed to be within 50 yds of anyone doing anything useful to the boss. So melee meters will still be fine for comparison.  
---
If you are actually trying to watch meters and record data, then you want to parse it anyways. You can pull a parse and view it and see everything you need.  
---
And again, this affect literally nothing about raiding besides bragging about damage. I promise you you can do dmg even if you dont have meters installed to stroke your epeen.
---
Hey! Guess what! You wouldn't be in this position if you weren't FP camping in the first place. If they solve this issue, then they should also make the FP master summon its 5 griffins and attack anyone from the opposing faction. Griffins and FP should be dishonorable targets and have 1hp and 5 sec taunt, giving you a DK.
---
How'd you like that for a change?
---
Just solve your "my faction is abusing" internally. Report them for exploits, and spam in chat that you will report anyone with a duel flag around the enemy FP. Also /Spit on the ones abusing after you state that this shouldn't happen around the enemy FP.
---
Re roll on a pve server
---
i had thunderfury on my gnome rogue in classic ;)
---
5120x2880 is pretty big.  You should drop all your settings to the lowest and see if it still does it.  If it doesn't, start bumping them up until your video chips start melting again.
---
Doesn't spy do this already?
---
Thank ya, snipercorg, I hope you liked watching it as much as I liked recording it.  
---
P.S. Nvidia SPLAY is a hassle and ruined a lot of insane fights.
---
The combat log in classic is **nothing like vanilla and never was.**
---
Saying "it wasn't exactly like that in vanilla" holds zero weight whatsoever in any argument at all. Classic is not vanilla, end of story. Stop using it as an excuse to keep broken an unintended game mechanics.
---
Versions of Spy existed in vanilla. They did not have the effect on world PvP that Spy currently has, expecting it to be left as is because "no changes" is idiotic.
---
I hope the horde queues will be as long as possible
---
What you read makes no sense and now someone else is gonna read your comment.
---
same.   about to hit 54, but phase two has put the brakes on that grinding train
---
Spam dungeons, go holy or prot and make your own groups and just spam dungeons until your eyes bleed, ezpz!
---
same faction.......fuck i didnt read it clearly,if it was a horde guild doing the taunting,it wouldnt be.....but an alliance guild intentionaling killing people,then yes i do belive that can be considered griefing,so if u havent already OP should report it.
---
Yep, that's right. That's why it was often mandatory for the whole raid to have the things installed, so you could get reliable information.
---
I always like testing my skills and seeing if I can pop 1 before the other 7 get me.
---
I killed people.  That was my focus in the game, not leveling.  All I did is go around in zones I had quests in and looked for people to kill.  If anyone showed up where I was questing, I tried to kill them.
---
When you don't care how fast you level, and you aren't spending all your energy on that, it's a lot more enjoyable.  Or at least it was for me.
---
so your telling me, that if you cant display your epeen on content that isnt even available yet (which means the addon owners will find a workaround before this even matters) that you cant raid effectively  
---
You do know you can raid entirely without addons right? like, with just the game client? it is totally possible. The damage will happen without the meters i promise
---
I imagine OP talks to people on tinder in the same manner.
---
&gt; Then you are proving my point.
---
... yeah we're done talking now mate. Nothing I've said whatsoever has proven a damn thing you've said, quite the opposite in fact. 
---
You have a good one.
---
The RP/PvEing neets need someone to watch too I guess.
---
Its good to have a hobby
---
Just a busy time of year for me, hope to start playing more when things slow down. With that being said, I'm a lvl 41 pally and not contributing much to anything lol
---
Hemo with swords is usually the way to go.
---
Discord where I could talk with old and new friends while I played was pretty useful.
---
Underrated
---
I don't think they are a problem often enough to warrant a widespread ban.
---
5head play. Nice haha
---
welcome to what wow was before experience boosts,there isn't any secret to it,you basically got to grind it out full bore. if you didn't take advantage of the leveling expoit early in classic, you basically need to grind it out full force. good luck OP
---
Yeah I have no objections to the addon in principle but the way it's being used and the way it's shaping world PvP right now is absolutely insane. I'm very happy it's being reined in.
---
I got to 53 but can’t push thru no more, specially now with honor 60s making it even more of a drag.
---
You want the combat log to not be like vanilla and are happy its changed. That proves you want changes and should go back to retail. So congrats on once again helping march Classic on its way to Retail.
---
The easiest way to alleviate the upcoming queue nightmare is to have same faction battles.  I don't recall which patch did this in retail but if the whole imbalance is 70/30, estimating here, 40% of the horde players are waiting, constantly.
---
No changes, sure.  But I doubt allowing horde teams to face off in BGs would break anything, either for the players or the vision of classic.  It gives everyone the chance to play and a way to pull the trihards out of camping flight paths for 12 hours a day.
---
Yes please! I play on Grobbulus and it is a amazing server!
---
Warlocks can buff Detect Greater Invis and see you anyway
---
ADD-ons, are not required to run the game client, you can actually play the game without addons, you can also raid without them, its completely real, I promise.  
---
Yeah, no epeen for you, but hey, the bosses still die.  
---
I still like how you completely misread what i said, and defend it further.
---
Please understand that we have cross realm battlegrounds combining heavily alliance populated pve realms with heavily horde populated PvP realms, no one is waiting in bg queues. World PvP will die down from being a zerg to being squad based just like it did in vanilla. This has all happened before and it will all happen again
---
Damn that does suck, because it means the system incentives you and other melee to just not join the fight at all and just chill back for honor.
---
No I am saying it changes how things worked in vanilla and no one should be happy about that. People like you cried about something and have helped push towards Retail again.
---
right click the game clock in game. no add on needed
---
Dey took err gooool!
---
They can't "ban" an addon, they have always adjusted something to break them.
---
Wait you stayed in that guild? If that happened in most guilds I've been in the majority would be gquitting
---
that was my thought too.
---
Yards not feet.
---
Wait out 20 days and level in AV.
---
Congrats dude!  huge!
---
Idk about server balance but on netherwind my leveling has all but stopped at 54(horde lock), cant go anywherw and quest, all roads with trees near by are gank fields, make it past them into a quest area just to get ganked by a 60 rogue. So i just turned around and went for those people 6-10 lvls lower than me. Fuck em, theure honor. I wont be leveling. But they wont either so (👁益👁)
---
&gt; Those suggestions included things like hiding enemy faction combat logs for people not actively fighting you or targeted by you.
---
Those suggestions also involved a lot more work than "change this value from 200 to 50 as a hotfix to try to stem the bleeding from this cancerous mod"
---
What did I misread of "I said it does not affect RAIDS." 
---
This change, changes how addons work in raids, there is no question before today addons worked one way and after today they either won't work the same way or will have to use a work around to approximate the same way. Change by definition is an effect.
---
Go through the numbers like I did.
---
Heavily Alliance populated PvE realms have half the population of heavily populated Horde PvP realms. No offense, but did you even read this? These mythical Alliance superservers to rival the Horde ones simply do not exist.
---
So let's say it like this. Warlock has 3500 hp before enchant, 3600 if he applies enchant and had it refill. Rogue does 3500 damage with no sl ticks then warlock dies. Rogue does 3500 damage with warlock gaining 50 hp from sl, warlock lives. Any health gained from sl from 3501-3600 keeps the lock alive.
---
500 iq
---
they literally said this is more similar to the original client, how did you even manage to get here at all, you cant seem to read
---
If the MC'd player attacks a flagged target while MC'd, it removes the Honorless Target buff.
---
&gt;AND ALSO fucking over damage and threat meters.
---
Good shit. 
---
No one cares about damage meters, it takes no skill to press your 1 or 3 skill rotation mate.
---
As for threat meters, they are literally a cheat. If you can't tell without an addon, how is it not a cheat? Anything else would be considered one.
---
Nice job on your loot, Hagus!
---
What are people using it for if not posting?
---
His point is that queues for horde will be a nightmare in cross server groups.  There simply aren't enough alliance players to spread around.  Allowing horde vs horde would be amazing, tbh.
---
If the original combat log was 100 yards as I suspect it was then yes, 50 is closer to 100 than 100 is 200. If they can claim its closer to the same, then why not make it the same. Just because a shorter range is better for you does not mean that is how it was in vanilla.
---
LMAO
---
I said "or it doesnt affect raids?"  
---
You said  "You are the one claiming it doesn't affect addons. You can't even keep your bullshit straight. "  
---
You cant fucking read at alllllllllllllllllll
---
315 is the cap.
---
Kurinnaxx gang
---
Or, OR hear me out, they can go to a PVE server.
---
You can do combos and have both like r/cfb does it
---
Depends how recently you were ganked.
---
What is your bow speed? Is it slow enough?
---
That Spriest should be mad as fuck; that neck is super-BIS for spriest because Spriest just stacks spell damage (since dots/mind flay can't crit) and that neck has more spell damage than anything ingame until Naxx.
---
just enjoy being terrible at pvp, because clearly, all you had going for you was this addon
---
hey man, what addons are you running?
---
Kromcrush doesn’t seem to be dropping too much, IF is still crazy populated and the PvP isn’t one sided.
---
Lol. Don’t call something else BS just because you disagree with it. Maybe stressful to you, vibrant to those who actually enjoy PVP especially in a game with “Warcraft” in its title.
---
You know what ability they use to kill a single addon? Changing how data is mined to make the addon work. Just like they did here.
---
Horse
---
Bye
---
Are you saying this ironically
---
Half the post is numbers. 
---
I genuinely cannot have a discussion with you if you can't follow that.
---
Can you put both on your bars? So they not share a CD cause that would be amazing lol
---
Maybe soul fire though?
---
o n e  o f  u s
---
There is only 1 ally dominated US PvP server. Heartseeker. 1.
---
Some allies are shit and bank lowbies too, etc..
---
But we’re not fucking *everywhere* en masse. And if we jump someone chances are it’s going to end in a 2v1 as one of the billion horde comes by, where as when we get jumped, same.
---
If you feel attacked for rolling horde, maybe you’re one of the *many* who did so because they wanted a raw numbers advantage. If not, you shouldn’t. Ya still got it though and you know it (unless you are on heartseeker).
---
I for see an update to Spy that will do this for people in your party/raid. 
---
But it’ll only give visibility of at least one person is in range 50 yards or less. 
---
So change still has a major impact, especially in solo roaming.
---
Same. 5 of us. I'm pretty sure us wpvp "whiners" make up more of the population than people think.

I recently joined a raid group to help a guildie finish the Succubus quest at 58. It took 30 of us and we wiped a couple of times.
---
You need to reroll and make a rogue next time then
---
What?  What does "he's not fighting ele" mean?  Eventually every shaman just specs ele when they realize that enh just flat out sucks even with hand of rag
---
As for my "drama story", this was back during Cata, patch 4.3, I was in a server-first raiding guild and we were progressing through H Dragon Soul. We cleared the normal version for loot, and after weeks and weeks, the spirit trinket finally dropped. I was highest on DKP, and after a few minutes of discussion the officers gave it to me. Good, right? Wrong, it ended up being the reason why I quit the guild and WoW, for a while.
---
The next raid night we were back in heroic and progressing on the airship boss, and one of the other healers starts openly whining in voice comms that I was "using a DPS trinket" instead of the spirit trinket that I just got. I calmly explain that it's not a "DPS trinket", rather an int/mastery trinket, and that I'm not using the spirit trinket because I was Disc specced for that fight so I didn't need the extra mana.
---
Small tangent- For those who aren't aware, Disc was broken-OP in Cata when it came to mana. Rapture scaled super well with mana pools increasing over the expansion's content. Holy priests on the other hand, had awful mana regen and needed to stack as much spirit as they possibly could, just to not OOM. I would swap between Holy and Disc for different raid bosses.
---
So I would use the Spirit trinket for Holy, but not for Disc. It wasn't until the next day that the healing officer asked me why I'm not using the spirit trinket I just got, and I reiterated that I don't need it for Disc, only for Holy. He responded saying that I should be reforging Spirit off of my gear so that I can use the trinket in Disc spec. I told him that's ridiculous because it would require me to hearth out of the raid in between every boss to reforge back and forth over and over, when instead I could just keep using the int/mastery trinket for effectively the same result. He didn't want to listen and insisted that he was right.
---
Now, this alone wasn't the reason I quit, it was really just the straw that broke the camel's back. I was already pretty fed up with the guild, because I had been there for like 7 months but was still treated like a "new guy", and I was also getting very exhausted from raiding 6 nights a week (main raid + alt raid). So after being told that I have to jump through fucking hoops just to please the other healers who are salty about me getting the trinket, I just straight-up dropped WoW cold turkey. Didn't even log in at all, I just straight-up full-on quit WoW. It felt VERY liberating, no longer being chained to a raid schedule.
---
I didn't end up coming back to the game until late MoP, and from then on, I was guildless. I had absolutely 0 desire to join a guild and be chained to a raiding schedule again. I kinda played WoW on-and-off from then on, playing for a couple months or so at a time. I did play a couple private servers, but only high-rate so that I could hit max level real quick. Didn't play a 1x vanilla server until 2015 with Nostalrius. Ultimately quit retail halfway through Legion because I was fed up with all the loot-RNG bullshit and bad class balance. Which is a shame because I honestly like how retail plays, but everything around it (homogenized classes, loot RNG, boring/easy world content, no community/socialization) are awful.
---
Solo one class should be unable to play their class so that everyone else don't have to worry about being ganked? Sounds like classic is not the game for you. Rogues are scary af and definitely crosses the line into unbalanced, however that is the game as it was back then. Why should an add-on effectively remove the class? I don't like spy but use it because it would be stupid not to since everyone is, and I can count on one hand the times I've been successfully ganked unawares by a rogue because the add-on literally screams at me when one is stealthed nearby. A rogue without stealth is just a worse warrior, and the add-on effectively removed that for them.
---
It's not bad, but it's noticeable, especially around the edges. Off hours are becoming more and more barren.
---
I am a rogue? Not sure what you are getting at
---
When I was level 49 a level 53 warrior tried to gank me. I won easy
---
Until you realize how laughably easier the Onyxia attunement questline is for alliance compared to horde.
---
They killed Kenny, you bastards!!!
---
Nice FPS Mike reference.
---
Honestly it could be 50.1% alliance and 49.99% horde and you'd still have alliance bitching about the server being horde dominated
---
&gt;BuT hArDiNeSs MaKeS eAcH oRc WoRtH tHrEe PeOpLe

How do you ban an add-on? They ban Spy, it's get renamed to 5py. They ban 5py, it gets renamed to Spy2 and on forever.
---
Nyahaha
---
Well.. yeah, but we arent talking about going SL so why would I bring it up? You wouldnt want to be demo for dungeons and talking about SL has no place in this discussion.
---
From the best of my memory, this is the first post on Reddit I've ever downvoted.
---
Why not just split the server cap along with the queue?
---
Lol I didn't say spy was good at all, it's game breaking, I'm just saying blizzard is not the authority on what is right you scrubadin
---
Your numbers suck.
---
Doesn't he have a hot GF moving in? That shit will get dealt with pronto.
---
From [here](https://ironforge.pro/servers/). I don't exactly know how accurate my source is vs yours but given that mine updates dynamically with warcraftlogs and yours is from two and a half months ago I'm going with mine being correct.
---
Oh I'm sure you do, go whine to blizzard about breaking your favorite toy
---
if you're gonna be a horde player, just don't be a cunty player... like 99% of them are
---
95% of the time it's horde doing this scumbag shit.
---
You have to be a real chickenshit setting out to purposefully gank people w/ low health vs mobs
---
Feel free to provide better numbers, then.
---
Otherwise this is the closest thing we have. Do you say polls suck because they can't question every person in the country?
---
So you had to be a hunter to have them on your minimap?
---
I live in the EU but rolled in an Australian server because I am from Australia and I wanted to play with my friends but during the week I can't place with them. Just in the weekends so it gets kind of boring since I am a tank and I like playing with people but can't form a group.
---
I'm going to reroll on EU. I'm looking for a PvP server that is both population and  that is either balanced or is more alliance dominated so I don't have a sorry experience levelling/instances.
---
Could anyone recommend a server for me?
---
Why do you need the combat log for that?
---
Reroll ally on Sekram.
---
It doesn't though.   Kiddie min maxers think that way because they can't win unless they pick the most optimum spec, class, race.  Good players make things work and have fun. 
---
Sorry to be blunt.
---
Ignoring  because I doubt it's worth talking to you.
---
No, you seem to think everyone loads into the game with damage meters, that is completely unnecessary, has no effect on if you defeat bosses.
---
And by the time you formulate a thought these addon wizard will have meters patched to work anyways, quit crying about something that literally won't affect raiding at all
---
Hah, couple Ally friends and I skirmished with you in WPL yesterday.
---
Faerlina
---
It’s just because there’s so many less allies and we know if we jump someone it’s prob going to end in a 1v2 as another horde comes running by, just like when we get jumped.
---
You are the one celebrating a change, not me. When this game devolves into retail because of people like you we will know why.
---
Kirtonos is slightly heavier populated horde so that may be a challenge. It’s like 60/40 horde
---
depends on how organized the server is.
---
&gt;I am entitled to making mistakes but you are not entitled to capitalize on those mistakes!!
---
Ok boomer
---
People love talking shit on other peoples UI for some on the sub for some reason
---
Now go delete some alliance with massive WF crits!
---
I don't think they should attack the new king's friends tho don't you?
---
They buffed them in WotLK and honestly it just killed going to capitals. You should have a disadvantage fighting in an enemy city but it shouldn't be THIS much of a deal.
---
This particular problem is honestly just rogues being overpowered, not guards being underpowered - they can fuck up most other classes.
---
That’s not what happened though. A “few” members from a known troll guild griefed. They didn’t have a team even capable of downing the boss or attempting. Hence why an opposing faction then just showed up and took the boss.
---
Which streamer does this?
---
Name plates never worked at 100 yards, why would you make this up?
---
Was that a moonkin top DPS...how?
---
I don’t play a Warrior, you missed the point entirely. TLDR; Blessing of Freedom is pretty fucking good.
---
“Create new Blizzard account, pay for original game and all the expansions available including subscription fee, then try again to submit your ticket.”
---
So 2% extra hit, a 20% reduction in glancing damage and a higher crit cap for rolling human over the other races, seems like a no brainer to me. 
---
Like I said if you're planning to be a MT there's no reason not to. Sure you can pick up edge masters but later down the road you're kind of stuck with them when better options become available. 
---
But yes you're correct, if you just want to clear the content at a normal pace and in a causally friendly guild then play whatever race you want.
---
Oh so now you are changing what you said. That at least makes it accurate but doesn't stop it from changing how it worked in vanilla.
---
Is there a list of what to be looking for?
---
No duels outside Org that day eh?
---
valves the biggest retards and continually "refined" their own automated reporting, how do people never learn
---
I bet she didn’t see it’s coming
---
How are you gonna know who's the shit dps in the raid tho? Yes people care about damage meters.
---
I’m talking about an even playing field with rogues, I’m not talking about tanking or solely doing pvp.  Check your comprehension skills.
---
I will be happily in Naxx when in Naxx is released but feel free to assume otherwise.
---
You’re trash if you need Spy to beat a rogue or even have a fair fight. Go back to retail.
---
blizzard are the ones who enable this behavior by putting in a stupid automated system in a social game.
---
I see an active change on the frontpage that seemingly the majority of this subreddit approves, so much for no \#nochanges
---
The people waking up at 3am to fight an imaginary dragon for shitty loot love this stuff. World bosses aren’t about loot it’s about faction and guild dominance.
---
my 60 warlock shits on mages, and rogues and warriors dont take me below half as affliction/soul link
---
Quality shitpost
---
No I'll just cancel them and you can get fucked.
---
Are you in ironically saying "ok boomer" by the way? That's really really sad.
---
So what you're saying is...
---
You thought you did, but you didn't.
---
Herod hasn’t been bad. I rerolled there from faerlina horde
---
I can hear this
---
i'm about to breach 700 now XD
---
Eh, Some mail but more or less, yeah. L'm not doing it in my leathers.
---
The demand for content is so crazy that the current number of wow classic content creators can't satisfy it. The only reason Asmongold is so popular is because he makes the most amount of content.
---
thank you this is a great answer
---
Rolled on PVP and got PVPd.
---
Self inflicted wound. No sympathy.
---
Ok!
---
Reported :)
---
So evil...
---
Oh lawd he comin
---
We alredy have class and faction flairs tho?
---
The question is who are planning on cutting out of your runs?  Do they know they’re expendable?
---
My guild sucks lol
---
How is that a defense? Lol
---
it gives people a fighting chance,as i said earlier...rogues are gods,the second u get stun locked your practically dead,there is no getting away from them, but then again your not going to get rid of 15 years of a pvp mind set,if people want to be killed by rogues without being able to fight back,hey good luck....your going to need it
---
This kinda stuff isn't PvP.  When all of your quest areas are camped, flight paths are camped.  The damned boats are camped etc.  You can't really play.
---
So the point of not clipping auto shots is to start casting multi shot or aimed shot only once your auto shot has fired, and then to avoid clipping the next one.
---
So as soon as you fire an autoshot you start casting aimed shot, and not before. I think you must be misreading your weapon swing timer. It should never tell you to start casting before an auto shot is complete.
---
Then because your bow is 2.7 and aimed shot is a 3 sec cast time, you will clip a little bit on the following auto shot. There is no way around it.
---
Y, it’s a bid that’s it.  Just fixsorting.
---
They are still necessary for raids later, if that's what you are worried about
---
What'd you do to piss off your healers?
---
It turns out PvP servers are hard to solo content on. This is standard PvP, also  you are on an incredibly balanced server.
---
This is so true and annoying. I remember in Arathi Basin if you were in lumbermill you could see what’s going on in blacksmith. Now I don’t think it would be visible
---
I can’t even fathom how you get through a day... If you watch any vanilla pvp or knew anything of world pvp you would know this was in there before this add on existed.  
---
That is the reason why the add on works, because this information exists from the game.
---
Do you know why world pvp is like it is now? No sharding!  So people are forced into the same zones on the same servers.  
---
If you chose a pvp server and you complain about an add on being the sole reason why some scrub hunts you to the ends of the earth, **then maybe a pvp server isn’t for you**. Got it?
---
If you think this what is “fucking up the game”(your words) then I hate to tell you but you just sound salty as fuck after that “1% top tier read combat logs” line.
---
I probably should've mentioned that I'm Tauren. I feel fine with just Warstomp. If it's necessary I can always Warstomp -&gt; Entangling roots.
---
In group PvP healing, the absolute biggest issue are Arms Warriors and Rogues jumping on you immediately. Thick hide increases my armor in caster form by &gt;200 and bear form by &gt;1000. Combined with the almost 200 attack power reduction from demoralizing shout, I'm almost unkillable. This buys plenty of time for the DPS in the group to kill whoever they're killing and turn back to peel the enemy DPS off me.
---
I spend a lot of time stealthed in cat form, but with healing/defensive gear equipped my cat damage is negligible. If the situation permits I'll use my opener with a rogue and apply rake, but most of the time I'm staying out at max range so the movement speed bonus isn't important.
---
Rejuv and regrowth talents are fairly worthless in raids. Regrowth crits almost always overheal and both HoTs are only good for the main tank. Even then they often overheal by 40 or so percent. But both talents show their strength in PvP. With the high crit chance, Regrowth easily becomes the highest throughput heal available to druids. I can keep a Rogue or Mage alive from two attackers even through mortal strike heal reductions so long as my mana holds out. Improved Rejuvenation is nice since it adds an equivalent of 57 extra healing power per point to rejuvenation which also benefits Swiftmend. I precast it all the time on teammates jumping in as it takes 3 seconds for the first tick to go off.
---

It might be worth peeking the AH to find some Int gear. Wands, rings, neckpieces, and shoulders can all have extra Int.
---
wait 20 days and pray to elune that the BG's kill a good chunk of the current assholes,hopefully u can level in relative peace by then.
---
1. 240
---
2. you have to relevel
---
I rerolled on a new server although that was week 2 of release and completely unrelated to PvP.
---
I didn't capture any ingame audio as I was watching youtube on the second screen so I racked my brain for the ultimate 1-2 combo to match up in sound effects.
---
Everyone says the horde times won’t be that bad even with cross server... I feel like there’s so many imbalanced horde dominated servers that it will be. Yeah there might be a few alliance dominated servers but I still feel like there’s way more horde.
---
&gt;noskiller 
---
Cause I know how addons parse the combat log...yeah...Bet you think macros are hacking too?
---
Yeah, I might be misremembering, but I could have sworn I used to be able to see enemies at their base while on the roof of mine in WSG
---
And the horde still won
---
Then sort your life out
---
This is what I’ve noticed. When I get gable with a mob I just fight or /clap if there’s 0 chance. 
---
Every time I see a Horde get gained they run like hell because they know there’s a chance they’ll find help.
---
I solo ally atm as lowbies honor food for 60’s. I just start typing coords for the honor farming duos to come avenge me.
---
&gt;payed no mind as they didn't really affect me
---
&gt;but hey I got my BiS sword so I'm just chilling.
---
&gt;but hey I am somehow still getting easy loot so can't complain.  
---
Sad
---
Hey are you using gutgore ripper in raids? Does your guild worry about its proc or is it a non issue? I don't know how the debuff works but am getting a lot of mixed answers.
---
There has literally never been a time in wow's history where it has rewarded anything but time sinks.
---
Yes.
---
Yeah I looked up the famous multiboxer Furyswipes that I used to play with, I thought he had a video of the Rag kill but he doesn't. Yeah seems like it would be hard you're right.
---
Im not quitting. i AM rerolling PvE because i love this game and i want to play. im just sad and i needed to vent so here I am
---
&gt; spy just takes combat log info
---
It literally does though, that's how the addon works  
---
&gt; this is against nochanges  
---
&gt; closer to the original behavior  
---
??? If it's closer to original behavior, then the previous combat log was a change, not this.  
---
I don't get your train of thought, besides blind hate for something you don't understand ?
---
The best bit is that those murloks apply a +50% chance to miss attacks" debuff which you can see fading just in time for the 888 crit.
---
I think it'll even out some once bgs come out.
---
LOKTARR
---
That doesn't matter the amount of people.  If you're advocating this be a bannable offense then 1 person or 100 people doesn't matter, they would get banned.
---
I don't see the difference.  It's only griefing if you interfere with a world boss having 10 or less people in your raid sounds like arbitrary crap.  The number or players doesn't matter.
---
I would not recommend Felwood.
---
Well it's oddly convenient when people left and right, on their forums and on reddit, complain endlessly about Spy and suddenly Blizzard comes out with a change that directly target Spy, and Blizzard explain it as if "Oppsie, forgot one little thing that was in vanilla!".  
---
I mean, who and how is anyone gonna check whether the combat log was in vanilla was 50 yards or 100-200 yards, it's not exactly a feature that stands out. So a white lie by Blizzard to appeal to both the complaining crowd and the \#nochanges crowd is not very far-fetched to me.
---
they should make it so it only goes down to 50 yards outside of raids/dungeons so it wont affect recount and what not
---
I've seen it happen multiple times, how is that a shocker?
---
Wait if you feign death for 6 minutes you actually die?
---
I don’t think blizzard changes the tensor distance.. it’s pretty similar in BFA from what I recall and classic was made from the BFA client.
---
You just dont know what youre talking about and I dont think anyone is gonna be able to explain it to you, because i sure as hell cant bridge the gap in your intelligence lol
---
Mob aggro is exactly like it was in original wow.  Once you kill the king, of the ogres, only the bosses and their reavers will attack players.
---
The OP it's pandering for changes.  Calling it an exploit, when it has been around since DM began.
---
Dude... I'm so close to doing it. I'm also level 54 on a PvP server and it's just not fun. In a way, I'm not too worried because I don't have tons of time to raid or PvP anyway, so I can take my time and level up. Hoping I can rescue my warrior somewhere down the line too.
---
I'm basing it off this [site](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Formulas:Magical_resistance) and the fact that bosses are considered level 63.
---
Zoomer detected
---
Top 4 servers with alliance majority are pve. Top 4 with horde majority ale pvp. Wonder why.
---
&gt; removing skill from PvP!
---
How is being able to click to target someone removing skill... what...  
---
You either never played the game, or your skill-cap resumes to mashing buttons whenever anyone attacks you without you seeing them.
---
Then:  27 years old, freshly divorced.  Still kinda playing EQ.  I just got out of the Marine Corps and was starting college at OK State.  I had 2 months of doing nothing but WoW starting on day 1.  Hooked immediately.
---
Now:  42 years old.  Married with a 6 yo daughter.  I’m a Field LabIT Specialist.  I feel the same pull to play but have far less time.
---
Nothing special here dude, if two people roll the same amount, it picks the first person who rolled.
---
What, you thought you were the first person to roll an equal amount?
---
You could rank up in Arena very very quickly if you knew how to actually play.
---
Yes it certainly does. When BG's come out it will be a different story though. If we are fighting a group of 20+ though I am much more strategic when I go in. Regardless though, I am having a lot of fun pvping
---
Azshara tends to be dead since there arent many quests thus low population thus little reason for those trying to get honor to be there.
---
Come to Myzrael. I’ll be your friend
---
&gt;Why don't you form a group and go kill them?
---
BRD right how on my server has 30 people out front of MC, 30 running around the ring up top and another 15 camping the FP in.
---
A 5 man of low 50's isnt going to form a big enough group to kill them.
---
I’ve literally only been attacked once every (one person) by someone within 2 levels of me, not outnumbered and while at almost full health/mana and not fighting a mob. Once. Everyone else had run by.
---
And that Rogue was an utter fucking badass. Went 2:4 with him and they were some of the most satisfying wins of my life.
---
Yeah it's a great "idea"...
---
that has nothing to fucking do with it, you cant instantly target someone by reading the combat log, your addon is fucking broken and i hope it gets even more limited.
---
I mean, yeah i guess?
---
Like i said in the post, i ENJOYED the wpvp levelling experience. I started on day one and i thought it was great being able to kill horde and i got ganked plenty of times and dealt with it.
---
It is just really disappointing that, because of population imbalance, MY experience is SEVERELY effected now. Menethil harbor has horde INSIDE THE INN and on both boats 24/7. I havnt flown into SG or BS once in the past week without dying IMMEDIATELY because there are 30 horde camping FP. I have actually been STUCK in WS because there are so many horde i cant rez and hearth outta there, and hte FP has been murdered. 
---
This isnt wpvp. this is: i cannot play unless i join an alliance raid that is specifically pvping. And i LIKE pvp. i WANT to pvp...just not for every hour i am logged in.
---
I can't even do anything in the game without dying over and over. There are always a million hordies everywhere on my server
---
Warlock epic mount honestly so much worse than just buying a 1000g epic mount.
---
So you mean five horde even better flight paths? :P
---
And warcraft logs will still work normally. So idk what to tell you
---
Its litterly their game. And they removed a cheating thing from their game
---
Sorry, if much rather be able to have accurate damage and threat meters than have Rogues be less detectable
---
I feel you. Holypriest aswell.
---
Yes i am glad. But I'd be more glad if they broke it all the way. Literally don't care about damage meters and threat meters. 
---
I don't care about what you think "nochanges" means or whether this was technically in vanilla. My experience in vanilla didn't have every single person instantly have awareness of every enemy in their radius.
---
My vanilla experience meant using the terrain and los to get the jump on enemies I might not be able to take by myself if they knew I was there. 
---
My vanilla experience meant hiding behind a tree while high level players rode past like a hobbit in lord of rings.
---
My experience with vanilla meant being able to use my shadowmeld without it actually hurting me by alerting people that I stealthed and showing people my "last seen location" to enemies.
---
Getting rid of spy gets me closer to the experience I remember and want. If that interferes with what you think classic should be, then i don't care.
---
So you are changing what you said from it wont change anything to it wont change logs, because it is actually changing something. You people in this thread can't stay on message and have to pivot constantly.
---
That's the way things work on reddit. Someone says something and it gets upvotes so then people parrot what they heard and it becomes entrenched as fact.
---
And someone needs to learn to read...
---
&gt;It doesn't invalidate it. You can still be hit from stealth, you don't know where the rogue is, just that they're close.
---
It isn't so much that Spy makes killing rogues easier, so much as it takes a mechanic that is entirely uninteractive and gives you at least some means of interacting with it.
---
&gt;Go back to retail.
---
I would say go back to highschool and pick up basic reading comprehension, but you don't come across as old enough to have been there yet.
---
I turned and ran from a man with hand of rag the other day and I have no regrets.
---
The amount of people who’ve spent up to 1500g on a lvl19 rogue twink and are going to be so dissapointed is staggering.
---
Eskhandar's you cant get weapon skill. With everything being so optimized these days threat &gt; pretty much everything regardless of the guild. Also no I am a fury DPS warrior just choose to look at things objectively as opposed to espousing what gives me more loot.
---
Rank 6, 23400 points
---
However, not every server will have a player with this many points. That would require 2 weeks of being 1st on the server. Some, if not most servers will have 1st place contested and switch places.
---
yeah cmon lads its not a race dps is easy
---
-guy at the bottom of the meters
---
[This sprang to my mind.](https://youtu.be/1KE0njnZXyY?t=48)
---
Lol i gave you a way and you immediately have excuses.  
---
Months before you can even find out you wont make it you already have excuses.
---
My personal favorite is dropping a fortitude buff on people before they jump off the UC Zeppelin, then watching them splat.
---
Nothing funnier than ganking your own faction.
---
Have you tried going to Iron Forge and talking to the gnomes.
---
Again you guys thought u did, but you didnt. And im here just having the best time on wow ever :)
---
You can use aquatic form but lava will tick for damage so you wanna jump constantly to avoid it.
---
If your jumps are top-notch, you can take 0 damage from the lava.
---
Appreciate the improvement but it’s still free ESP and Wallhack within 50 yards so hopefully they’re working on a full fix.
---
So you don't care about classic being vanilla then, guess you should go back to retail to have the game cater to people like you. This post couldn't be more self centered, the only thing that matters in your mind is your game and everyone else can suck it up. Good thing there aren't millions of people that are playing that aren't you. Maybe go play Skyrim instead so you can dictate exactly how the game should be played.
---
What change do you want them to make next because you don't care how it affects anyone else?
---
Yeah. For whatever reason the fucking morons on this sub are insistent that they need to silence all discussion on this with their inane "go to retail" type idiocy. 
---
However its obvious things are fucked. People literally cannot play the game and these clowns are still insistent that nothing is wrong and this is just standard PvP despite people not being able to move an inch out in the world. 
---
Servers are fucked. They are overloaded and unbalanced and anyone with half a brain can see it.
---
It messed with my details log tonight on rag. Some dps didn't register
---
OK well when I come back with a screenshot of me on a kill I don't want you immediately using what I said above as the excuse. We have established you will accept that.
---
does evasion do anything vs hunters?
---
Since he was talking about the Cata and later era you'd see dickhead max level toons ganking levelers.  I always felt that at a level 60 I was in the appropriate level range so it had at least the pretense of honor.  I mean *theoretically* your typical heirloom geared level 58 could fight back against my level 60 twink rogue.
---
I duo this with a shammy and have pretty similar gear to you.
---
Stay in Prot the hole fight except for execute phase. 
---
Sounds like you are not using Stoneskin totem on imps? They hit for 1 with totem up.
---
I kill imps when boss is dead.
---
But you are one basically the most balanced server around. Its incredibly close with horde and alliance. The boats and zeps are very different beasts you'll never find them evenly fought over. Boats are much easier to get to.
---
It's 50 yards shorter than Hunter's mark.
---
This changes the combat log...
---
Keep wearing it for pve. For pvp though, get some stam gear. The necrophile gear has good stam, for example.
---
You're full of strawmans today aren't you.
---
I second this. Azshara is a great zone. But find somewhere off the beaten path. Stay away from the felcloth grinding spots and watch out for people picking flowers.
---
I rerolled on Mankirk even tho my hunter is 53 on herod. Broke my heart to leave everything
---
As a Horde member of Skeram, I can confirm that the Alliance are significantly more skilled in PVP combat than the Horde.
---
What’s the song pls?!!!
---
It's like if there was a built in aimbot in an fps game, if you don't use it you're just handing wins to the enemy. That doesn't mean it's an enjoyable feature of the game
---
Azshara minus Azuregos area, and Silithus/Tanaris/Un'Goro hives would be my two cents.
---
What I've heard is that it gets pushed off by other effects so it's a non-issue. I don't know if that's the truth but nobody has given me grief for it yet.
---
"Last seen" is a time component, not a location. Spy does show the zone...so what? That doesnt tell me WHERE the player is
---
&gt; location tracking
---
So again I ask, where does Spy do this? I see nothing that keeps me constantly update to where certain enemies are. In other words I cannot "track" their "location".
---
Ayyyy
---
I wear shadow and spell power gear
---
Almost 60 and it’s been helping a lot with killing mobs faster. Mostly just depends on what you can find. Also try to make sure you save any fire resist gear.
---
Guaranteed that if we had this thing that I imagined, everything would be better!!
---
only in response to ppl. they didnt go making threads announcing it lol.
---
If there is one thing blizzard has always been consistent with is caving to the whiners . Well done , what's next on the list
---
As a paladin I feel this so hard. I heal for raids, but I have a full set of tanking gear and I’ve found I can tank any of the level 60 instances. I almost always end up switching to tanking when getting a group together and the heals is always very salty about me needing on “their gear”. Healers are so spoiled having all of the gear they can use reserved to them
---
yes, definitely. Makes a very large difference. Use a weapon type with garbage weapon skill and go attack a mob, you'll fail horribly. Weapon skill and defense are kinda two sides of the same coin
---
My guild leader and main tank of group 1 is a prot warrior and he uses eskhandars, when I asked him about it he said it’s better for threat generation due to the way threat is calculated in classic. Now I am a stranger on the internet and you don’t have to believe me nor do I have to believe my guild leader, but to be honest with you I don’t see why he would lie to me so I’ll choose to believe him. Because of this I believe it invalidates all arguments for giving perditions to a prot warrior. Eskhandars is far easy to obtain has a higher recorded drop rate and is objectively better. Not sure what you mean by your first sentence, but warriors can definitely train fist weapons.
---
Just spam dungeons, find a group/guild of people and just spam dungeons until 60.
---
This. As a rogue, back in Un’Goro I popped out on a Gnome Mage who had just finished eating, he just barely survived, Sherwood me and I lost track of him.
---
Like 10 seconds later he comes running out of some
---
Bones and just lights me up. Was impressive.
---
Haven’t bothered to balance another CD.
---
Use the way back time machine.
---
I only need 1 populated server... hmm almost like a pserver lmao. The ones i have been playing on for 6+ years with 13k player caps (international servers meaning prime time is 24/7). People will stay. Just not these 4 mill new subs. Any pserver player knew it wouldnt remain big because of what vanilla is. Its definatly not every ones cup of tea. It is mine and this phase 2 has been amazing. Persver players just want a stable server(in regards to officals servers) and they got it. Honestly thanks everyone for signing the petition for liking the "idea" of vanilla. And thank you for your rose tinted glasses lmao. I got what i want and itll be here for years to come. Just think if they do seasons. The second one will be better, with actually like minded players. 
---
As for 20 min queues sounds amazing. Reason why is cross server bgs. On the pservers u got the one server waiting over an hour for a queue. So ill take it!
---
Again  you thought u did but you dont! :)
---
when i last played the game a while ago you could dodge hunter attacks.. is it different in classic?
---
Play what you like. But while I personally hated leveling my warrior I absolutely love it at 60.
---
This post is pure truth. The horde are literally majority squeaker babies who were still swimming in their daddys sack in vanilla. They have deluded themselves into thinking they will get to pvp when bgs are released... lol
---
Also tons of people weren't 60 yet. People didn't know how to level in vanilla and just kind of did what they wanted. 
---
You're right though. These zones weren't built for this many people to be in them. I'd like to see how they did this issue.
---
they are the same ones that gank him and are enjoying themselves
---
Just because you dislike the facts they present doesn't mean they suck. That isn't how data works.
---
VanasKOS
---
Nice.
---
Get the seeds w/ dynamite all adds will die. Only problem 10m cd.
---
Spy was one of the greatest addons made for classic...
---
"So ill take it! Again you thought u did but you dont!"
---
Did you read the bit where I literally said this problem isn't affecting me? I guess not.
---
Well let's see. In bc and early wrath we had a ground marker addon which made raid encounters a joke, you could essentially draw custom markers in the game world and it would appear to anyone else who had the addon. blizzard c&amp;d'd the addon because it was too powerful. There was babelfish which was pretty much a cross faction chat, shut down by blue. We had oqueue in MoP for bg queue premades, which was eventually shutdown by blizzard because the community ree'd about hydra premades being in every bg. Now we have spy (which has been around for a long time), the only reason people stopped using it was because of flying mounts killing wpvp, there was 0 reason to use it in bc and beyond.
---
Bgs came out the same amount of time in vanilla though.
---
I hate all of you haha.  Especially synergy and oof
---
Lotsa people in my guild. Gotta satisfy everyone
---
Male orc :)
---
I guess you dont care about your perforamance at all
---
This isnt really a woosh situation.. more like [this](https://i.imgur.com/Qj4Vf5A.jpg)
---
I think of it as a one-time experience. Yes it's fucked up and incredibly hard, nearly impossible for Alliance on certain realms to get almost anything done, but it's a short moment in WoW history. You will never experience this again once BGs come out and the dust settles. I wouldn't reroll.
---
"ninja'd": they gave out loot MS&gt;OS and someone who didn't understand that and wanted free roll started raging.
---
So about one problematic addon per expansion, kind-of.
---
And aren't there like tens of thousands of addons?
---
It’s not. Solo roaming and getting full credit for kills, not sharing your one hit with the Zerg is.
---
It’s just welfare honor for those who can’t get it on their own.
---
I never will understand why the hell they make alliance druids go to silver pine.   Horde druids get both parts in their zones.  If they want to do them in home zones, make one in alliance one in horde, and call that good.
---
Seems lazy on blizzard's behalf.
---
Literally any server where horde has a majority. Good luck even getting 60.
---
Yo I'm on Skeram and horde (56 prot war) and got hit by gank squads 4x in WPL in less than 20 minutes today. It's not just horde is bad, it's people who think they're gonna get leet rewards by trying hard. But after two weeks they'll realize how much time that actually takes and give up, then things will normalize.
---
Meanwhile, Blizzard will have totally rushed the rollout of the game because of overblown reactions.
---
If you don't like the current situation then try rolling an alt, doing dungeons, or (shocker) just taking a break for a few weeks til it chills out.
---
arent female nelf and female human attack animations extremely similar? for dual wield attacks anyway
---
Kromcrush. I’ve had a fucking blast on it. High pop, but only with a mild que in peak times. May wait 5/10 mins tops. Always something to do, and a ton of solid guilds.
---
That comment(meme) is laughing at this sub ingeneral, not just you.
---
Nothing to grp for. Dungeons are all farmed out so ppl are pvping, lvling or just raid logging. I sure am.
---
World PvP was fun in vanilla. It would be in classic too if they locked faction population on servers and didn't allow so many god damn people on a single server. The zones weren't built to hold this many players.
---
Look at the ranks of the FP campers and then look at the people out there ripping it up solo or in small groups.
---
It’s not because it’s the “most efficient”, it’s just that it’s the “most efficient if you can’t win balanced fights”.
---
I run Census on my Realm a lot, and I think there's been a reduction of around 400 players on my server at prime time.
---
I agree with you. People are rejoicing, thinking BGs will be their savior and the open world will be like it was pre-Honor. Because there are so many more horde than alliance in general, horde will always have queues. Basic math. And a large number of the people out there farming now will be right back out there. They'll just be farming your ass while they wait for their BG to pop.
---
Seems like its working, im now delusional.
---
This might be the single most gangster thing I've seen on the internet. Well played.
---
Earthfury is a great server, pretty balanced with a vanilla realm population numbers
---
Grats! I've wanted to be there myself good to see others living the dream.
---
6 weeks isn't 4 weeks
---
Seriously the most unfortunately named set of gear in the game
---
I like how people come to classic and expect some retail and vanilla merge and keep forcing retail things onto a previous games experience.
---
I should go to Starbucks and demand they sell Mountain Dew just because I don’t like their coffee.
---
You'll need to go to a capital city to learn higher skill cap
---
Don't do this, you will be reported and probably banned
---
Cool story bro.
---
How are exp/hr there? I have the feeling it's tiresome to do Arena+Anger runs, and they don't give much exp really
---
This might be the single most gangster thing I've seen on the internet. Well played, sir.
---
Great idea
---
We could use ya on thunderfury. Were severely out numbered
---
It's honestly a solid 30g and hour vendoring everything. If you have herbalism you can make 40-50g an hour without question depending on server AH prices. I just recently added hydromancer to my solo lasher farm (takes about 3-4 min a kill) and my g/h went up a bit and the extra chances for books. Zevrim is an easy solo but I think he takes too long however doable. Last boss you can solo easily depending on adds, at the least you can get him to 50% and kill the imps to corpse run back to get the mining in the tunnel. Just takes time and it's a gamble.
---
Still at around 15 minutes a run for lashers and hydromancer without having to worry about getting locked out ever... it's probably the best farm for heal spec priests.
---
I'm deep disc, 6.7k Mana. I just stacked a ton of +int gear when I started out... it's so easy you can do it in your sleep.
---
I quit classic after blizzard sold themselves out to China which made me sad because I was loving it
---
Everyone fights. No one quits. You don't do your job, I'll shoot you. Do you get me?
---
Yes raid leader!
---
You cant go from being clearly annoyed to parroting my comment and expect me to fall for it lol. Just stop, petty isnt a good look on you.
---
Yea, the Alliance are coming to my server and doing what they are pissed about to Horde.
---
Not that I mind, because I made the choice to roll on a PVP server and I know what the consequences are. But good grief stop the holier-than-thou bullshit.
---
I suggets you migrate yo a low pop server. Our guild did and now we aee very happy. We grind arcane crystals and black lotuses and are being able to play more. The community is also very nice.
---
I gotta say my skills feel infinitely less tested flying in and dropping a sapper and some AEs before ice blocking than in some 1v1s.
---
World PvP in MMO's is flawed because it has nothing to do with the things you want in competitive games. Every good competitive game is about balanced opponents competing in a test of skill, whereas MMO's by design are about becoming more powerful than your enemy. It can never be more than a novelty, and that novelty is going to wear thin fast when it's hurting the other parts of the game.
---
noobs oppo
---
Wow now we warriors et tanked even easier because we can't flee when spy detects a raid in distance, nice one .
---
And rogues will have it even more easier to gank you're ass.
---
Yup. Last month I was amazed, had never seen so many people in IF and SW, super exciting.
---
Now it’s like a ghost town. If you didn’t roll with the Herd, you get to experience a server death spiral. Awesome.
---
The faction war didn't even really start until wrath of the lich king lore-wise. 
---
Alliance and horde teamed up to take on the silithus bugs, they teamed up to raid the dark portal, they teamed up at the wrath gate. In fact it was putress attack on the wrath gate that made varian do [this](https://media.giphy.com/media/rM6scK327auEU/giphy.gif).
---
One of the lore reasons why Thrall sends the Horde after Onyxia is because he believes a destabilized alliance is bad for maintaining peace.
---
blizzard are cheaters too so that is not a defend.
---
The guild is Workaholics on Faerlina isn’t it....?
---
FOMO gets us all. Don't worry man there's guilds that are still forming out there that haven't even run MC yet. You'll have your chance, just make sure you're having fun.
---
Yup, about 8 addons that have been purposefully broken due to “unfair advantage/automation”
---
"Well make the problem worse" oh ok
---
Herod Alliance got Kazzak last night.
---
Im the top dps in my guild, I literally offer a gold pool if anyone can beat me on rag/golemagg without cleave damage. No one beats me. Still not worried about this change because if you are 50 yds from me (im a melee dps) you arent doing anything useful.  
---
We run 2 hr MC/onyxias on a slow night, no, we dont care particularly about the exact rankings of our dps, most people are PvP spec.
---
From the activity log, it seems like there's up to about 5000 concurrent players. I havent poured over all servers, but it's been implied blizzard removed layer and did nothing about pop caps, allowing 10-15K people on at once.
---
Lvl 37 Human Paladin Noob here:
---
How am I supposed to upgrade my weapon as alliance?  Looking at a guide it suggests a bunch of horde territory dungeons but I have a hell of a time trying to get a group going in those like SM far distance away.  So I'm stuck using this super low weapon right now.
---
Are dungeons the only way to get these weapons?
---
Debating in making a character here. Pros and cons to the realm? I've never been on an rp realm but I wouldn't mind the extra fantasy style wow.
---
Not unreasonable to expect exploits and bugs to be fixed.  Diminishing returns for these things was set up in vanilla.
---
But I don't see why people bitch about wPvP anyway, you get to pick your server.
---
Yes, but everyone is not a working father with two infant toddlers. 
---
I have to agree though, that its insane how much some people can play. Basically half my guild still plays 12-16h a day. How so many people can be unemployed and not even care about getting back on their feet eludes me.
---
Thanks my man!!
---
I'm not even on your server and I've heard of this guy before, lol
---
You clearly don’t know how to play this game. First off, this is centered around Rogue v Rogue. Not Rogue v Orc Warrior or etc. It was Alliance Rogue vs Orc Rogue scenario.
---
Second, you can easily kill Rogues in a stun lock, even if they are geared. I have Perdition’s Blade and use Thistle Tea. I’ve killed Rogues in just a Cheap Shot before, let alone a Kidney. I do over 1k backstab crits. You can kill Rogues in a series of stun locks. PLUS after the kidney, you can BLIND them, restealth, Sap and then get full duration stunlocks again. 
---
So you clearly know little to nothing about PvP in this game. I’m not claiming I know everything, but you are just spewing nonsense. 
---
You know why I’m trying to stunlock Orc ROGUES? Because if they BLIND me, they can stunlock me and kill me. Rogue trinkets don’t counter stuns, only fears, polymorphs and charms. With that said, if I don’t stunlock an Orc Rogue, I am dead. Use some common sense here.
---
There would be discussion to be had but unfortunately there is a large chunk of assholes on here who are adamant they need to tell everyone to shut up if they dare talk about a problem that isn't personally affecting them. 
---
This sub has been derailed by dickheads from the start tbh. Not sure why. Everyone I come across in game is great. This sub is full of twats. Go figure.
---
Nothing else is effected. 
---
Only the cheaters using spy got affected get the fuck over it. 
---
Wow didnt start with 1.12 either. They didnt add guards to new spots to prevent abuse of mechanics. They didnt have updated graphics. They didnt have built in addons support that worked 100%. 
---
You're cherry picking your argument because you're butthurt you cant cheat using spy anymore. It's that simple. Stop playing because it's not anywhere near vanilla at all. But you dont care about that do you?
---
Glad we're on the same page, ban waves for anyone that goes near a tagged world boss.  Hope to see a blue post about it.
---
Isn’t that a pve server?
---
But this isn't a Horde only problem, this happens by ally on ally dominated servers. But guess which side isn't bitching and leaving? 
---
This is, fortunately or unfortunately, the state of the game right now. But MMOs are supposed to feel alive, you shouldn't expect to just do the same thing week after week. So this will pass, and shouldn't be a problem in a few weeks.
---
In the mean time, if you're on a PVP server, potentially mandatory PVP is part of the rule set. So go get that honor.
---
They don't, actually
---
Perhaps in the far north-east area by the sea. I'm not sure about horde side, but as an ally I don't think I ever had any quests there. There are also minimal herbs so shouldn't attract many farmers. I dunno, just guessing. Not at a computer at the moment to check it out.
---
On its own, no. With the right talents though it can leave a debuff and potentially stun.
---
It wasn't recount back then, but yes
---
Ally were doing that outside UC in /yell today.
---
unethical , and cheating
---
Alliance is doing really well on noggenfogger tbh, from my horde point of view. Might be right or wrong though
---
But cow shaman... ewww
---
This is so sad. People would rather give up then play alliance :(. My former faction has fallen so far...
---
Addons like recount and details are both affected because they use the in game log and not the log recorder they mentioned wont be affected.
---
And I care because I am asking them to put it at the same point it was at in vanilla. It wasn't 200 and it wasn't 50, so why not put it where it was at.
---
People already bitch about how OP rogues are. I can't wait for the Reddit crowd to bitch and moan about being camped and stun locked and how unfair it is that they "have no recourses". 
---
And now I've got to check other people's logs to make sure threat and damage is correct.
---
Yay...
---
Next in the list is going to be PvP CC durations.  No more 30+ seconds of CC!
---
ROUGHNECKS
---
Assuming they're not targeting honorless targets, the people that stealth in cities are among the least starved on the ladder.
---
Yeah. Lots of those are griefing. That's against terms of service. You seem like you are just desperately arguing for a right to be an asshole to everybody. Quite honestly I would rather you weren't in the game to waste my time with your inane trolling that you childishly find funny.
---
You should reroll.  You can even stay on a PvP server, but yours sucks.  Chose poorly.
---
Testing and abusing are different.
---
I have had One experience in classic with a multiboxer so far that was opposite faction and it was while leveling in stormgarde me and my 5 man which includes my wife and 3 real life friends destroyed the warlock multiboxer using  a combo of the lake and by simply attacking from all sides. We camped him for 2 rezes before he logged out .  When I find them I converse  wih the horde side guys on my server until they block me then switch to another one of their toons lol. good times.
---
as a lv57 well-geared healing spec druid should I have no issue getting groups for Strat (living/dead) and L/UBRS ?
---
I can't really figure out what the level reqs are for the endgame dungeons after BRD, but I've been running that so much I think I need a change of pace.
---
Also when would it be doable for me to join a pug MC or Ony raid? was expecting lv60, but a priest in my guild did lv59 ony raid the other night
---
Faction based queues. Seriously, anyone against faction based queues need to shut the hell up or come up with a better solution. The queue is very simple: if pop ratio gets worse than 43:57, the 57 starts getting a queue. This enforces a ratio at worse of 43:57. You don't like the queue? Reroll somewhere else or transfer. That's what alliance did. Enforcing a population balance will be by far a net positive for the long term health of the server. Horde, you NEED alliance to make the game compelling. And you NEED them in large enough numbers that they challenge you. If you play on a server like Skeram, you're playing a pve server, and you are pathetic for being okay with the population imbalance.
---
If anyone else is against faction based queues, come up with ANY solution that is even remotely as good as faction based queues. It's common sense. The server basically get split in two, and your side gets full when the ratio hits the 43:57 threshold.
---
Please believe me
---
It's. Not any better on a balanced server like mograin
---
We (horde) own brm and the World boss locations meanwhile the salty alliance cunts own the entire world (there are like 5 24/7 raids in feral as felwood and especially in both plaguelands and tanaris)
---
They don't get to play the real endgame and we don't get to play in the world
---
Everyone hates it
---
I was 60 and rerolled. It wasn't hard I guess though. That's the vanilla I remember, can't just cheat and sever transfer.
---
You need two bwl resets to make the sceptre. So all servers will last a week at least
---
Because it turns out both ends of this are changes. How about we just make it what it was in vanilla and leave it there? Then if it favors one side of the debate they are in the right.
---
You seem to lack the skills here you missed the point entirely. There is a spec that press you there, you just don't wanna use it
---
It has 800k downloads, it wasn't some niche addon.
---
Because then you could just rename the add-on to "Spry" and it wouldn't ban you.
---
The only thing Spy did was read the combat log and then draw a button that when pressed typed "/target name". It's incredibly basic and there's about a billion slightly varied ways one could re-implement that functionality.
---
Because addons are literally just software, it will never make sense to ban a specific add-on. They have to change the API or functionality the addons use.
---
That's a real world safety feature, this is an online video game, the advantage Spy gives is ridiculous, like you can get away with raiding without dbm, you can not realistically pvp without spy if this stays in as it is, the advantages of what it actually allows you to do are insane, and there's a reason add-ons couldn't do this in bc/wotlk
---
Addons should be optional and not expected if you're actually decent / just don't want them, spy essentially gives a raid frame of your entire enemy raid....
---
Did no one else have the issue where you had to keep shooting Simone even when killing the pet so as not to have her reset?
---
My guild recently had their first rag kill and according to some statistics I read that makes us top 10%. If there's any truth to that, having two raids farming MC easily makes you 5%.
---
Aren't BGs cross realm with PVE realms though? 1.12 had cross realm pvp, so I think that's what theyre going with. Because PVE realms are include in that mix, I think the numbers are much more even and the horde queues shouldn't be terrible
---
Then you don't spend much time around here I guess.
---
I understand but maybe I made the wrong statements here. I am alchemist 300, and have been running dungeons with friends a bunch. I farmed small flame sacs for hours during the day bc I work from home for fire pots for MC. I play a shitload. I prob shouldn’t have even said that. My point was that just bc you lost rolls with pugs in dungeons doesn’t mean I should feel bad for you in a guild raid.
---
I think fresh servers would be best. People's lives change, a whole different refresh to achieve better/different things they didn't get to this time would be great. It would also be interesting to see how fast the community could down each boss with more and more chances.
---
If you really have to cheese it buy the sleeping dust thing that knocks out an add for 30 sec.
---
That's totally not true lol. They're are, and were damage/"threat" meters in EQ. 
---
Just because you didn't use one doesn't mean they didn't exist.
---
You're either trolling, stupid, or both.
---
Regardless I'm not wasting more time on you
---
.... yeah because situational awareness isn't a skill. Stealth and stealth countering isn't a skill. Usage of terrain isn't a skill.
---
If you don't understand what that addon takes away from world PvP I'm not the one who's "never played the game".
---
Threat addons are not very accurate on ony regardless.
---
Yes, we thought we wanted a vanilla experience in a world built for 3k players max. But instead Blizzard gave us layering because they assumed 99% of players were gonna quit like they quit retail. Now we're left with frankenstein mega servers that fills every zone to the brim and makes vanilla-style pvp or pvp dodging impossible.
---
Go enjoy yourself on your pve server. I can tell you this about pvp servers: all of my most memorable moments aside from our first rag kill comes from the random wpvp encounters. Leveling on a pvp server was absolutely unforgettable. I'd never care about killing the 15th murloc for some quest, or picking up the 30th saber tooth but all those unpredictable and adrenaline rushing moments vs the opposite factions will be in my memory forever. To take away the pvp moments, good or bad, is to take away the essence of vanilla wow.
---
First of all, most people want some pallys in their raids, even if you're a bad dps, the buffs are worth it!
---
Until aq40, retri dps is pretty low and at the start of naxx (with decent aq40 gear) and about doubled afford on consumables (melee + caster ones), you'll get pretty good dmg-wise, but just against undead. They're a pretty good class for pvp as well
---
Prot shines in 5-10 man content, because their AOE is really good. If they'd have a taunt, they'd be better than warriors in my opinion (just for 5-10 mans).
---
Holy paladins are really good healers. With enough crit + mp5, you can't get oom and with relics in p5 + some t3, you can even outheal priests. There's even a way to play a prot+holy hybrid, because the 31 talent in holy isn't that important (30/21/0). And they're really good healers in pvp, too :)
---
You think you do, but you don't!
---
Or they just enjoy picking easy fights.
---
Let’s not pretend it’s not as much of one as the other. People
---
Did this shit before Honor, they just do it more now and can’t get away with it as easily
---
killing 49-52’s in WPL or Un’Goro while farming because there ARE deathballs of Alliance lookin for them.
---
Seeds?
---
That is the stupidest reason to not like threat meters I have ever heard.
---
These posts are funny to me. Not so much funny at the expense of the player, but rather the fact everyone is on a pvp server. It was known horde were going to dominate on pvp servers. It's the way it has always been. The ONLY difference between a pvp and a pve server is world pvp. Yet, people chose pvp servers and here we are where they threaten to stop subscribing because they are getting "griefed" simply by being out numbered. Idk, I just can never find sympathy for these posts because people chose pvp servers, and using the excuse "well it wasn't like this in the beginning" is a bullshit excuse.
---
How do it not make sense for you to message me back bb?
---
I need that puss
---
Mankirk? Isn’t that server almost totally Horde dominant?
---
What's funny ?
---
It buffs offensive play.
---
If you're standing doing dick all you're going to be visible less...
---
But you're not going to be standing there doing nothing. You're doing something always. Now people are going to be rolling around in groups unseen because they mounted further back and you're going to be tagged because they happened within your area.
---
You must be insanely bad at PVP if you need an addon to tell you people are coming from 200 feet away to prepare in time.
---
I've been playing since launch, and literally hit 60 with my main just yesterday. For the first few weeks I happily took my time follow quest arcs to completion, and then going back for some of the others story lines I had missed. I did chains for dungeon quest, collected others, and then would finally would run the dungeon a couple times, and move on.
---
Every now and again I would gank someone or I would be ganked. It was a frustratingly entertaining .
---
Since I just reached 60, and wpvp is out, the game - the community - feels much more frenetic and minmax, and I'll have to taker care that my enjoyment of it doesn't turn from a hobby to a chore.
---
I personally only watch his maybe once a week or so, but why I semi enjoy him is the fact that he’s a subhuman. Legit because he is so god damn loud about about us opinion acting like the worst in us. I don’t know why it’s so weird.
---
Lol #bfaclassic... This is the classic experience we all wanted
---
Imagine unironically thinking we aren't entitled to a better fix after paying a game company 15m+/month to re-release an old game.
---
MMORPG not "bunch of roles playing game"
---
Nothing is hard yet that poaching is required. It also may be the case the new guy now farms and has learnt that he cannot just be carried, but that is all the better for your guild and 100% focus on his behaviour now not in the (alleged) past.
---
Tbh I dont see any issue with approaching players, if they are happy they will say no, if not then you can find out why not and be thorough about if the move makes sense for both parties.
---
i never said it's an exact location, white knighting an addon that was already nerfed wont get you very far.
---
Like you said, the population is much larger than it should be. Also players are much better/min-maxing harder which in turn only exaccerbates the class "balance." World pvp is in no way competitive anymore and at best is just griefing now. Bgs will be in a better state than wpvp for sure but still classes are terribly balanced along with a majority of players aware of their abuses. Even bgs are going to get old rather quickly. Hopefully it will stay fun long enough to see some actual improvements make it to retail in the meantime.
---
This is absolutely not a real classic experience. The server caps are like 15k now up from 3k in vanilla. All servers are basically at capacity all day. The sheer volume of players makes it not anywhere like classic.
---
If you look at a server like Skeram, which is like 80:20, you're contending with such numerical differences that amount to entire server populations worth of people. With a population of 15k and the faction split, there's like 12k Horde to 3k Alliance. That's four classic servers worth of players against one classic server worth of players. 
---
Even on a high pop server with a massive faction imbalance in vanilla, you were only contending with, at most, 3k players. Even a 2:1 split you're only dealing with 2k against 1k. This is absolutely not remotely comparable.
---
There is 0 possible way of Blizzard accomplishing this without nuking every other unit frame addon’s functionality. 
---
It’s simply a /target.
---
"Gotta pick the best so it doesn't look like I stuck" is pretty much kiddies...or do you prefer man-child?
---
Can you show me what piece of lua code writes to the combat log?
---
This particular functionality didn't exist for pvp/arena add-ons in bc/wotlk though...
---
Oh yeah man you can definitely quest while waiting on groups to form. You’re a healer too so people are more likely to wait longer on a healer.
---
It does make it less shitty when you have to deal with only five hundred players comprising your imbalanced faction compared to thirteen thousand comprising ours.
---
Sure, Warcraft logs don't include the players still leveling though.
---
Whats server balance have to with rogues in major cities?
---
&gt;What are you supposed to do? Just afk at the bank?
---
sure lol. Just wait to unflag, then you can go about your business all you want.
---
Anywhere you'd like to point out where I said it removed *all* skill from PvP, I'm all ears.
---
That would be the point is to allow you to get into brm in maybe 2 to 3 deaths instead of 15 to 20.
---
So sayeth not so well adjusted adult.
---
20min
---
It was always a bad call, but I get why people didn’t want it changed. If they just wouldn’t have changed server sizes or would be half as bad even with the radical imbalances.
---
Yeah, the most high traffic stress would be really rough, but you could still get off the beaten path and only come across the occasional group of solo quest/farmers.
---
Says the guy playing the one class that requires zero skill at all.
---
Yes it is.
---
YES, GET OUT OF MY SWAMP!
---
It will be wonderful for people to gtfo...
---
Im still going to use it to mark my future KOS list everyone thats killing me now. You are all done when i reach 60!
---
I setup a spreadsheet. Tagging this for later if anyone has made an addon solution.
---
 There are so many flavors, yet you choose to be salty
---
You'll heal with 1 button!
---
Yes, it really became impossible to play for the alliance. Horde kills on all chicken coops. Hiking to the dungeon takes a lot of time.
---
Yeah that literally just happened to me yesterday lolz
---
&gt; Dont take these numbers as accurate, but i think its pretty good as far as percentages. 
---
It says Whitemane is 70% Alliance so I think everything before your comma was all that needed to be said.
---
Unless youre THAT paladin that gets to wield nightfall.
---
Thank you for making the appropriate choice for yourself when you rolled.
---
See, this guy gets it. And doesn’t have to pretend otherwise just because he rolled Horde.
---
Don't worry, he'll soon find out that even though Blizzard changed spy, he still can't win any fights. Soon he'll be back in searing gorge backstabbing 48's that are fighting mobs hoping a 60 won't walk by.
---
The problem will start before you even get close to 50. Felaras, Tanaris and Hinterlands are also camped by 60's in raid gear. They'll enter town, 2 shot you inside the inn and just shrug the guards off like if they were mosquitoes.
---
You don’t have to be perfect to be good.
---
Imagine typing without any punctuation as a grown man.
---
Not really no, unless you have a macro for every player on your server / battleground
---
I do ignore them but enough people must fall for it as they've been here all week. Same players.
---
Lol! I do the same thing!
---
Yes. Once you have some decent gear you can do all dungeons from about 56. Druid is good to stealth past groups due to increased aggro range.
---
What does that have to do with this? Lua reads the combat log and Blizzard is writing less to the log.
---
You do realize that the packed zones and world pvp are exactly what are preventing new players from catching up right?
---
the facts are the facts man, I contribute to my raids, and I give people a goal to shoot for, dont be salty because it turns out youre talking to someone who knows wtf is going on
---
As an economist, this is pretty clever.
---
This is a stupid question, but will those be cross realm?
---
This is just proof that Alliance dont have to get rolled, and the complaints need to stop.
---
This does not effect the out of game text combat log that is uploaded to sites like warcraft logs to create parses.
---
It absolutely effects damage meters and threat meters which read the combat log.
---
Played for 15 years and never knew this, thanks buddy.
---
With 30 people dealing damage, its like 205 dps per person. Which is very low...
---
well welcome to the conversation Aerana, now leave
---
&gt; We used to **joke**
---
Mate...
---
If your tanks die before he submerges, you have either a tank or a healer problem. Or both. Tanks needs to hit the softcap on fire res.
---
We have a shaman standing outside the raid to totem the tanks (you CANNOT have a mana user in the melee pile, ie no shaman there), We then have 5 healers stacked 2 and 3 close to the tank with 1 resto shammy for manatide. Assign 3 healers to tankhealing and everything else should be a breeze.
---
In p2 you wanna start banishing elementals. You should have like 5 warlocks for this. Then its basically just a magefest.
---
It sounds like you're saying spy changes the log, but I see what you're saying.
---
APES did it without bis gear in like the first week of classic...
---
I think Recap was available in late vanilla but not Recount.
---
If it’s worth the business then just mail stacks individually — sorry, one by one and make sure to whisper them and tell them in chat how the CoD system and mail system works, otherwise deal with it?
---
What company is the classic team hired and directed by? Oh yeah, riot games I forgot.
---
Nah it's just that we have 400+ players and everyone wants to raid.
---
This comment chain was a wild ride. Ty guys
---
5 points in wand, 5 points in spirit tap. Just dot and wand and you will run into very few mana issues when leveling as spirit tap will keep helping with the mana regen.
---
lol so rude
---
Except healers. Healers gets to pop GFPP pre pull, then mana pots.
---
Is saunt even a real server?
---
Doesn't the phile suffix just mean obsessed with/enthralled with? Necro means death so it's pretty appropriately named for shadow damage set.
---
what’s a good one for east coast that’s popular? I need somewhere to wait out this clusterfuck.
---
Well I guess if it's awesome in the privacy of your mind, then it must follow that everyone else feels the same. Case closed?
---
Oh wait... *smashes head into wall*
---
&gt; weeks old
---
Is that why I can see data from the last week, including Thursday? I've watched my server's faction balance fluctuate over the last 3 days. Even the overall H/A percents have fluctuated. 
---
&gt; so horde dominate
---
This is server dependent. There are Alliance dominate PVP servers.
---
&gt; unofficial numbers
---
Sure, we cant say they are 100% accurate. The collection method is sound, and the data just gets better the more people add. But go ahead and post Blizzard's official numbers to prove the census wrong.
---
You were able to click the enemy players from the other side while waiting in the starting area. If that isn’t the way it is when ab is released I’ll be pissed
---
Your stupidity in this comment chain is embarrassing
---
Agreed. Felwood is horrible. The zone is skinny. 60s run up and down the zone with spy and can see you from just about anywhere.
---
Azshara is a PvP hotspot, lots of thorium and high level herbs as well as the elemental water pools.
---
I would recommend running the dungeons you need for your pre raid BIS since you will need to run them at 60 anyway.
---
I found LBRS to be very good exp wise.
---
How assmad do you have to be to downvote this comment?
---
Surely that means skill shouldn’t make much difference at all then since it’s so very easy?
---
Reported for not being civil and respectful.
---
&gt;proceed to give the shield to the only one of the three tanks who didn't roll (he was MT, but had already
---
I have sympathy but if on the first raid your OT wasnt even 60 (you) they seriously need to prioritise getting 2 tanks well geared. You are unfortunate that there were more than enough tanks, we also run 3 and although our MT got most gear, the other 2 have loads as all set gear is tank gear and we only have 3 tanks right so they are all at least 3/4 out of  8 and have shield etc.
---
It isnt like dps where even loot is fairest, your tanks are so key that you do have to unevenly gear at the start.
---
I'm pretty sure threat meters mostly estimate, much like castbar mods
---
Except it's name is necropile and not necrophile
---
probably more than 50 yds, these fools are crying that they cant read that far anymore
---
Alright, maybe for a new dinged because this is super easy as it is ;). ”1000x easier” is a reach
---
"Location tracking" means actively knowing where they are. Spy does not do location tracking. 
---
It's fine that they reduced the combat log distance, especially as it's been cited it was previously larger than Vanilla. What's not ok is you lying about what the addon does because you're bitter there was a bug that got fixed.
---
As a mage, I lose all the time to warlocks. So really, it's just personal experience and skill. I don't think any one class is 'OP'. They all have pro's and con's imo.
---
&gt; (Although I guess if you're within honor range and questing in the end game zones its super frustrating.)
---
I mean I did say this. I fully acknowledge that being within honorable kill range, but without a fighting chance must suck ass. I was killed in hillsbrad sure, but a lot of the time the alliance was focused on fighting the lvl60 hordes not some lvl22 orc.
---
*If you can't secure the kill from being swarmed by the enemy, you don't deserve the loot.*
---
I’m sure the fact that you have a 3:1 advantage in raw numbers is just a concidence.
---
I’d love to see faction ques just to watch everyone of these posts evaporate into “OMG alliance is camping all the zeps I can’t get anywhere” posts.
---
i feel like the solution is to take it out fo his dkp or whatever system it is you are running in the first place.
---
Have you raided? I have never been asked to wear fire resist gear nor have ever felt the need to have some but I'd be willing to reconsider if there's something I'm missing
---
Necrophile and dreadmist gear are good for base stats. Also benediction with +31 int is huge
---
Now that's quality drama
---
5v1 60s v 60
---
PvP SeRvEr
---
60 vs 17
---
Lmao you virgins don’t want pvp, you just want to feel powerful because you won’t get anywhere in the real world.
---
Bullshit there are so many servers that are 60:40  50:50 40:60 on EU /Ger and even on NA
---
Alright you know what, i was rank 14 world first dps on goldshire, look at me im cool. I can talk big on reddit, look guys :)
---
His attitude sounds ppor but if his threat was an issue then yes gear is the answer to that, it is why first set of bindings go to tanks mostly. threat means others can dps properly. Constantly whining though is a pain to play with
---
And your inability to understand that I'm wanting accurate information instead of a 'best guess estimate' is astounding.
---
When I’m tanking speed runs I listen to black metal like Behemoth.
---
Excuse me sir, we are having a circle jerk here.
---
What is your main hand?
---
I tried to find the biggest and the most imbalanced PvP server in EU (Stonespine apparently) and rolled a dwarf shadow priest there so that Horde there needs to worry a little less about missing out on genuine PvP experience. I'm gonna get steamrolled, but that just makes every victory sweeter.
---
So nice of you to get your shaman friend to drop his totems around you to make the pic more epic.
---
I'd assume the alliance aren't worth honor any more after an hour of wiping them. This is just being a sore loser to the point of me feeling genuinely sad for the horde players being petty to this level. It's not wPvP anymore. It's the kid who is told to share and instead rather parents take it away than let someone else use. You aren't being "cool" or funny. I wouldn't condone this even if my group was the one that lost on the kill.
---
It may have been an account alt for one of the hordes. Away to stall until they get there.
---
I'm thrilled that you're leaving.
---
You're the kind of gamer who needs safe confines (or dare I say it, a SAFE SPACE) to be able to play a game. Well guess what, Classic isn't about that. The original wow captured the sense of real danger out in open world. There is no turning off war mode here, because that's REALISTIC.
---
So you know what? Leave. Leave and don't come back. Anyone feeling sympathy with you should be ridiculed. Blizzard delivered EXACTLY the game they needed to, because this game is HARSH in some ways, and people like you just aren't cut out for it.
---
Byyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyye

Hi, /u/BajaResident

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dzxavd/is_honor_trading_kills_on_a_pve_server_considered/). 
---
are you guys getting the free +83 fire res from UBRS on the raid?
---
43 57 is far too imbalanced though. There’s no way I’d continue playing if I was on the 43. It needs to be like 47/53 MAX
---
You intentionally joined the faction with a numbers advantage because you’re bad at PvP and need a crutch and everyone knows it.
---
It’s not the Horde. I actually played vanilla, I was actual Horde, when we were outnumbered (though far less so). You’re just a part of The Herd.
---
Romantic!
---
My mage guildy likes to camp this rare and when he sees an alliance hunter start to tame it he'll pop out and sheep them, then make them watch as he kills the rare before killing them.
---
I'm pretty sure he's on many hunter's Spy KoS list
---
Sometimes, but not the whole zone. As someone who has mining/herb/fishing, I can't say I've personally spent much or if any time in the far north-east. Usually skip that area completely.
---
Running dungeons works too I guess, if they have a group and access BRM easily enough...which could be a challenge currently.
---
Pick a better server?  Not any fault but your own that you choose to stay on a low alliance population server.
---
Do you blame doctors when they diagnose you with the Flu?
---
This mana-heavy meltdown has us shifting to set prices for tier pieces. Non-set pieces are still going for bids.
---
A funny and related story, my vanilla guild had a rather brutal DKP system, where if you won the bid you paid one more than whoever bid second-highest. This led to some DKP bleeds and backstabs that I still remember to this day, like when the first Widow's Embrace went for EIGHTEEN HUNDRED DKP (bosses were if I recall correctly worth 10) and everyone in Ventrilo collectively shat a brick laughing at the paladin that got looted the item.
---
The second one went for 450.
---
I see, the talents and crit actually benefit higher ranks more than lower. Where Healing Power benefits lower ranks, so with that set of input, the Healing Power breakpoint to switch from rank 10 to rank 4 is 431. 
---
Now the results given on the main page is just the most mana efficient heal, (Average Healing/Mana, with a small twist). And should not be interpreted as a “use only this”. 
---
I explain exactly how things are calculated in the  “How it works” section, and under Detailed Overview for each spell, you’ll find even more info about the spell you’ve selected.
---
&gt; quit the guild overnight when everyone was in bed. That was maybe a month ago now? He was guaranteed t
---
I find that so funny, I think all of our 4/5 hunters in rotations have the leaf as it drops all the time! No worries if you are not the first. Like I am playing shammy, yes I want the gear but if it drops and one of my shambros gets it, then I have a better chance next time on both the next item and also the same item in subsequent weeks as less players need it. If you miss a raid, you should wish the items you want drop anyway so that you have less comp next time!
---
Supersampling
---
Truth hurts don't it. Stay salty
---
Who gives a shit that you can't pvp and spy made you a target?
---
You can search for something like "wow classic prebis list (your class)" and icy veins or any reliable site should do the trick!
---
So, you wouldn’t do it?
---
Congrats. I, on the other hand, am about to reach lvl 48, so that's pretty great.
---
It's not enough, they should kill SPY completely.
---
I think keybindings are cheating too.
---
If you can't cast spells with clicking on it with your mouse, how is it not a cheat?
---
Friggin nerds think they're better than me with their "keybindings" and their "high dps".
---
Alliance has warlocks too you know. Try fear kiting when 75% of the opposition is undead.
---
At this point it seems to me that horde are like mobs in dungeons -&gt; just sitting there waiting for people to come and casting pointlees abilities whether there is anyone there or not.
---
Not all from combat log, Spy also uses other events to detect players like changing zone, changing target.
---
mmmm. yes. Yes i do feel better about it. it was really hard leaving the server that i have invested so much into. thanks for reading :)
---
Greater potion of intellect :)
---
it sure did. you could click the gladius frame to traget the hostile team. i still find it funny people crying about spy but gladius does far more and no one batd an eye.
---
would me calling it "location history" have made you happy?
---
Is it harder to stealth around a lot of mobs or a few mobs . 
---
This isn’t hard to understand.
---
Wouldn't work anyway, you get reduced honour per kill of the same target 
---
"
---
Diminishing Returns from repeated kills on a single target are as follows:
---
1st: 100% of Honor
---
2nd: 75% of Honor
---
3rd: 50% of Honor
---
4th: 25% of Honor
---
5th (and beyond): 0% Honor"
---
If you're not baiting you seriously should consider getting professional help, you are deranged.
---
ok boomer, "location history" does that make you happy?
---
There was just a content drop. 
---
There was a surge in players. 
---
Those players started raid logging or playing more efficiently. 
---
There is a less throughout of players.
---
How do you move the unit portraits to a more center position like that?
---
I am on earthfury.  We are now outnumbered by the Alliance.  Come to earthfury hordies.
---
Lets play a game of "spot the virgin"
---
good point tho. i know we all play this game because of how realistic it is.
---
Spy was such garbage. Break it forever. Ruins open world fairness
---
I am a little surprised you didnt sum up the post with a final count. Sure I understand its estimated data, but what are the totals? Just plain and simple, how many horde vs how many alliance across all NA servers.
---
I went via Theramore, few deaths but took 20 mins max
---
That UI looks like you can’t even see your toon lol
---
“Insanely better”  implies you’ve tried my build, which I highly doubt.
---
This has a huge impact on any damage meter addons
---
Just like flying on retail. 🙈
---
&gt; But you want to keep things like this for some misguided notions
---
He doesn't give a ffuck about purity.  He wants the unfair advantage the addon gives him over the people that don't know about it or refuse to use it.
---
Nah, I spend my time ranking
---
&gt;Does 20 ms batching = 50 ticks? and 200ms = 5ticks?
---
Per second, yeah. In short, they create a bucket and slap as many spells as they can into that bucket. After 200ms, all of the spells in the bucket are cast and are considered to be simultaneous by the server. It's how mages can polymorph each other.
---
&gt;Wouldn't the game feel better on 20ms like retail?
---
/shrug. Maybe? The old mechanics were fun as hell, PvP was always a little unpredictable because of the batching (and the synchronous server ticks). 
---
I think they can come up with some interesting mechanics if they play around with the priorities of things
---
It was a hell of a lot harder in vanilla, having to dodge all the allies (were the most populated faction), thief catchers, etc...
---
If there are enough hunters around to care, you spend most of your time hiding and waiting in empty houses to the point or stops being entertaining/Honor profitable fast.
---
The squeaky wheel gets the oil.
---
If one side isnt intentionally losing I think its fine. lately had the same discussion on the discord of my server. Some people opened tickets regarding this. One GM said he doesnt consider this honor trading another said that they will have to look at it.
---
That requires way more math than I'm willing (or capable, really) of doing.
---
But using the estimates from Ironforge, its safe to say there are likely more Horde on Herod alone than there are on multiple PvE realms combined. And theres already half as many PvE realms. I'd love to be wrong, but I think BGs will be a relatively light mitigating factor.
---
&gt;If you quit the game because you got killed a few times per hour in your capital city 
---
Fixed it for you. Also, you need 5 mins in non-contested zone before losing a pvp flag.
---
56 here and trying to decide on cancel subscription or reroll on pve server...
---
So 240 for the usefull stuff and 250 for the extra toy.
---
Thanks :)
---
I meant in comparison to my arms build that I switched from, apologies if I insinuated in comparison to your build
---
Not true, the whole party/raid gets honor. Was killing at a flightpath earlier.
---
He means that this wouldn't have been an issue in vanilla, its only issue because of zoomer fragility and readily available places to cry if u get ganked, like reddit
---
I know this sub is fairly anti-addons, but if you really want to make an example, turn on ThreatWatch and let it spam who taunts what, only way I got hunters and healers to know why warriors pulled threat while leveling.
---
Until AQ and Naxx.
---
Mmm, I do like deathwish
---
I played a Horde dominated fresh RPPvP server in TBC, there was literally 1 dwarf spreist, he was Death for us.
---
This really changes nothing, saves you from people flying by pinging.  It hurts druids tho because now you can pinpoint a druid stealthing if he is still regening mana from shape-shifting to catform.
---
Didnt they just say it like that because BGs will be released on patchday (Wednesday in germany, would be 11. Dec.)?
---
Downloading an addon to scan and store historical AH prices on your server will give you better advice than anyone on this subreddit can.
---
The only way I see them gaining subs is fresh 60 servers. 6 month late servers that you can't transfer to, stuff like that.
---
To be honest I know half of my guild would reroll Horde on a 6 month late server right now if they had the chance.
---
next fucking level:
---
taming a beast. after the cast is finished nothing happens the mobs keeps hitting. died while channeling second cast to tame. ressed. use call pet to get the new pet.
---
why?! how?! what?!
---
fuck you, that's why.
---
ticket CS. "yeah it happens".
---
fuck CS.
---
It’s just not true? I played P2 vanilla and it wasn’t like this in intensity, because servers were smaller and factions more balanced.
---
&gt; and said they would be investigating
---
guys... should we tell him? :D
---
This sounds very wrong and inconsistent with actual gameplay. I'm pretty sure the stealth sound which goes off when you see a stealthed target close to you was added to give non-stealth classes more of a shot to detect stealth users. Not because the game buffs on someone when they render. What would be the point of that?
---
Classic in a nutshell.
---
Frost reflector. Free action potion. Net-o-matic projector. 
---
Good timing with engineering items can easily turn the tide on any battle with a caster.
---
Gladius couldn't target enemy players from memory, only party members
---
Organized PvP on PvE servers happens all the time. And Im sure it results in a good amount of honor for all involved. Nothing wrong with that. Just fight real battles and dont obviously farm each other. Its a game, afterall. It should be fun, not a farm.
---
Your arguments do not line up. Being good, transient, and being good permanently in the end are 2 radically different things. So youre great at getting to 60? Too bad your worth ends there m8. Getting prebis/some bis is also transient, as it ends at some point. Raiding does not end but keeps going.
---
40k honor standing 1?
---
lmao what kinda dead server are you playing on
---
Gankers ganking gankers ganking gankers.

Stuff like this:

Why against undead only? Exorcism doesn't add that much. Exorcism is less dps than consecration in fact, you just pay only 1/3 of the mana (2 consecrations are 1130 mana and do around 1350 dmg in 15sec, one exorcism deals around 900 dmg and costs 325 mana) and the mana you spend on exorcism usually comes out of the mana you'd spend on consecration. On top of that exorcism is a spell, so has a significant miss chance against bosses.
---
All in all, exorcism amounts to ~20 dps increase, which in naxx gear is around a 3% bonus.
---
Only if fights are short enough, that you can spam exorcism in addition to consecration, you'll see the full ~50dps exorcism provides.
---
Turns out it's actually "nochangesidontlike" rather than "nochanges"
---
The question is answered. Getting exact numbers is just adding extra detail. Horde indisputably outnumbers Alliance by a huge margin if you consider all realms. 
---
It wasn't a ton of work though so I'd applaud any mathematically competent person who did get detailed. Shit, I'd love to be proven wrong actuallt. It was just me and a couple tabs looking into a concern of mine while eating dinner.
---
Every paladin spec is viable in pve.

I know for myself and I’m sure I’m not the only one but I’m just doing wpvp to get to rank 3 for the discount and trinket. I got to rank 2 last week and will hit 3 come Tuesday after that I’m not planning on pvp even though I’m on a pvp server. The wpvp will die heavily after this week and will for sure die down when BG’s release. I see your point with the numbers but everything is still ongoing the dust hasn’t settled in terms of people unsubbing. I’ve played vanilla and other private vanilla servers as the grind starts to become more with BWL and content after it the subs will drop, I’ve already had people just vanish from our core raid group because of being burned out. Once we hit towards the end of bwl id say that’s a better time to look at numbers on servers IMO. The burnout is coming and only the hardcore will stay, even more so with Christmas coming and gamers getting new toys and other things to tempt them to stop playing

Interesting, haven’t shared this experience at all! Best of luck to your server though, which are you a part of?
---
oh. tell him his healer is bad then i guess, right?
---
it's not the fact that he has no mitigation talents
---
I wanted my small-ish servers with 3k players per server, not 15000 bloodcrazed zerglings running around looking for food 24/7.
---
AddOn existed in vanilla and used to have an arrow pointing to the target.
---
So no.
---
Overly dramatic.
---
I hope you're correct. I really, really want to be wrong about this.
---
If they kill you, it resets to 100%.
---
Healing is the standard role, which most paladins embrace, as it's the strongest no question.
---
Ret is decent in pve and quite strong in pvp. 
---
Prot is great at tanking dungeons, but lackluster in raids.
---
Play the role you enjoy the most and don't let people tell you what to do.
---
Cheers to despair!
---
gz on the shoulders then
---
I recommend having max rank and rank 3 nova ready. Spam max rank, when you're out of mana use 1-2 rank 3 novas, if needed wand them down. With your mana though you will be 100% ok. Try to get around 3,5k HP. Also with PI you can do double pulls, but it's a bit tricky. Pre-shield, get to full mana, pull 2 packs and start spamming max rank nova. Make sure non of the lashers are standing behind you - what I do is i always keep moving backwards just in case, because they can backstab doing 100% more damage. Mid fight try to pop IF and shield yourself again. You might wipe a couple of times, but it takes time to get used to double pulling.
---
I was talking about your own faction having trouble getting honor. people truly serious about ranking will find ways to get plenty of kills on their own where enemies will always be, like portal rooms for example, while everyone else zergs in raids.
---
I rerolled from PvP to PvE and am now enjoying the game so much more :-)
---
Only reasonable explaination
---
How frequently does Az spawn? Could’ve sworn Despair got the tag and kill just yesterday.
---
DBM is one of the most damaging addons to the game, It literally made retail have to design all raid encounters in a specific way as blizzard always has to assume that every player has an addons which literally tells every player what to do at any point in any fight.
---
The game might hav ebeen better if that addon was nuked back in TBC or wrath.
---
alliance just have a wank and they are inn. 
---
4 TRIPS TO UB/LBRS 4
---
My post can be reiterated and could simply come down to the multiple normalizations in the game adding up and finally putting a nail in the coffin in a key aspect of what made WoW much more of an adventure. 
---
It’s funny you play devils advocate because it very much involves a similar type of thing as what you touched on in your post about arena queue. 
---
It’s all the little things coming together that changed it all. Dungeon finder, dungeon queue, bg queue, arena queue, and even the existence of rep gain and dailies became a big driving force for obligation...these are all things that overall changed the landscape of the player experience to the degrees that led to current retail. 
---
The problem I have with things like dungeon finder and arena finder is that each of these things become extremely trivialized and almost too easily accessible. The idea that you can get to a point where you can choose to sit in a capital city, never leave, and get everything you wanna do done is the problem. 
---
Currently in classic to get to a dungeon and even when battlegrounds first came out in vanilla, you had to physically fly and run to the dungeon or bg instance to enter queue or enter the dungeon. A lot of people forget that you used to have to queue at the wsg, arathi, or alterac bg instances to join. There used to be no battle masters in the capital cities. The idea of forcing players to physically go somewhere to do something creates the experience of exploration and general experience of living in the world. 
---
I’m pretty sure TBC was like this for dungeons and I think Outlands still holds a place in my mind on a similar if not greater tier for adventure and experiencing the world that classic does. 
---
I alluded to it, but when it comes down to it...I’m trying to say my issue is that when you trivialize or normalize the world building experience with  one thing, leading to the next, to the next, to the next thing, the world starts to feel less special. Sure, dungeon finder is convenient, but the easier that travel and content completion gets In the way that it has been, the less investment I have in the zones or the leveling that builds the player experience. It creates forgettable memories in some cases.
---
In that case, if you’re getting an eye every hour with 5 people farming it, you’re all making 40g/h, which is respectable - faster than most classes can solo farm.
---
It’s either worth it to farm as a group, regardless of whether or not a friend needs it, or not worth it to farm and instead you should buy it.
---
If friends are willing to spend and hour farming a rare drop with you, maybe they’d be down to loan you gold, or down to do a better farm so you can buy it quicker.
---
Econ and opportunity costs are weird
---
But you dont know the total number of alliance and horde. So... What do you know?
---
#nochanges
---
Putting people that dont f*** over other people for the sole reason of being aholes onto your loot council goes a long way, you know. So does cross-checking from multiple eyes.  
---
Also if you feel like you been f‘ed over... why don’t you talk to the officers that made the decisions?
---
Warriors only make a sound when switching stance, not when they gain one.
---
Mallowpuffs lived due to being the cutest raid member
---
2 manning requires either the healer or tank handles dps, because of mana tank is optimal.
---
Standard fury can handle it with good gear, mixing damage and mitigation. Fury/prot could do it with slightly worse gear. I don't think deep prot could produce enough dps.
---
Who told you that? I believe you're mistaken, friend.
---
i thought contacting other guilds of the enemy faction was against the end user license rules. am i wrong anyone?
---
my friend told me that it was against the rules to do the no kill horde to alliance chat conversion and i guess i took my previous statement from that context
---
On my server lower level people do brd prison clears for exp.
---
That is part of what i wanted to draw attention to. it really is kinda sad.
---
Good.
---
yeah. the point is that the health of a server affects both factions
---
i'm not even on pvp servers.
---
Just saying "guy, it's easy, go farm dungeons" when we have ton of videos of high level dungeon being camped to hell and some people having to repetadly die for half an hour to just reach it seems a bit out of touch.
---
wcl isn't real time it batches

Yeah, there was a piece about it on eurogamer quite a while back who got it from Geoff Goodman. [Source.](https://www.icy-veins.com/forums/topic/27391-how-the-stealth-system-was-shaped-by-a-mistake/)

I'm just levelling my alt atm because I don't have time to find a group and run dungeons in the week at the moment (Not gonna even attempt to quest in Tanaris), but by tonight I'll be dungeoning again on my main! Woohoo!
---
Under 'auctions'.
---
Are there any low-mid level pvp hotspots? I don't mean entire zones like STV but smaller areas that both factions like to visit at lower levels and end up colliding.

[Nope.](https://www.icy-veins.com/forums/topic/27391-how-the-stealth-system-was-shaped-by-a-mistake/)

Cope
---
Here is a thing. Why not do old school AV like old days going for kills in the middle and never ending battle. Farming honour points that way
---
That's literally what the guy above him just said.
---
You rolled Herd on a 70:40 and are basically playin a PvE server anytime you want and we all know it.
---
Yes. I’m sure you are, because you elected to play on easy mode against people playing on hard.
---
And no, you don’t play on an ally dominated server or are an ally on a horde server.
---
and you realize than it doesnt fucking affect anything, if you REALLY wanna compare damage you still have the most accurate method, parsing
---
&gt;If you were joking about it that'd be implying it was a thing.
---
Yes, a false statement implying that it is a thing. That's the joke.
---
100% wrong
---
Wait, so, like 3 alts and 1 main could be counted in one censuses?!

It should, furor gives me 10 rage immediately when I shift and charge is 5. Also, sorry, I'm confused, should I do this instead?

I vividly remember being annoyed about not being able to target enemies in gladius, must be misremembering, or you must be thinking of changes that were made that allowed this to happen post Cata
---
That is a million times better than not being able to get into BRD and not being able to find a tiny corner of Winterspring or Silithus to grind in without constant corpse runs?
---
Theyve been around the pserver scrne for a while
---
Noone told me, what I have seen pvping. I killed a hunter multiple times until they 2v1 me and after zi rezzed and killed him I got the 199 honor again.
---
&gt; enough dps
---
there is no enrage timer, therefore there is no "enough dps"
---
I'm not sure you understand just how much range the combat log had. It was quite far until they nerfed it. To follow that logic, of course you wouldn't be able to witness buffs being applied to freshly generated entities.
---
The stealth tidbit I mentioned was just the only way you can witness this behavior, as it was originally a bug. [Source](https://www.icy-veins.com/forums/topic/27391-how-the-stealth-system-was-shaped-by-a-mistake/)
---
Its really not difficult to extrapolate the massive population disparity given the information we have.
---
If Server A has 6000 players, 65% of whom are Horde, that's 3,900 Horde.
---
If Servers B and C have 2000 players, 80% of whom are Alliance, thats 3,200 Alliance.
---
We can see that PvE realms are *all* considerably less populated. There are also half as many PvE servers. 
---
If you really need exact numbers, please feel free to get them. All the information for it is on Ironforge. But that's just icing on the cake. Its irrefutable that there are far, far more Horde players.
---
As I said, not every 60/40 split is created equally.
---
or you can not break everything down in the game to how much gold you are earning and enjoy the process of getting things for yourself and your friends. Buying an eye of shadow isn't as rewarding as farming one for yourself with your friends, It's all part of your personal journey.
---
Yes, but theyre one of his lower drop rate items.
---
On Razorgore? Rogues stopped ganking Org after the first day, and the few times they showed up in IF they were quickly disposed of. If you log in the middle of the main area there's 0 chance you'll get ganked even if someone's around.
---
I had this item as a tanking war in vanilla.  
---
It is a really fun farm that has little to do with BRD if that is your concern. Blood of heroes farming is an eye opener. The item looks cool also... imo.  
---
It is a solid item for a war as it is strong in base stats with resistance. You can min/max in any direction but if you already got the carapace I would recommend finishing the quest.
---
I mean sometimes I do see alliance wiping out horde but only for the time begin. Horde are like cockroaches, they die then just crawl back.
---
This is a spammable or either/or macro.
---
In other words, you won't get bear form and charge from one click.
---
Its uses are either spamming the button - first press bear form; second press (after gcd) charge.
---
Or saving keybind space - one key to either take you into bear form (if not already there) or charge (if you are already in bear form).
---
And yes - Furor gives 10 rage; charge needs 5.
---
They drop.
---
Source: I have them equipped.
---
No... Blizzard isn't holding a gun to their head. 
---
But the system is designed with flaws so they're going to take advantage of those flaws to keep up with the other people talking advantage of these flaws.
---
Healer mana is finite.
---
no, blizz catered the content to include more people in end game. Eventually they essentially added DBM to the standard UI (just like they did with scrolling combat text). They also made content have scalable difficulties and lowered raids to 25 man and then to any size you want. DBM didnt break anything
---
Ill bite to level an alt... What realms you suggest?  Also what classes would you suggest?  I feel like i should almost bring a friend lol
---
Stratholme gives alooooot of XP, but will be hard to find a group until 58ish
---
what is with the butthurt over the damage meters?  why are you lashing out?  maybe you shouldn't be basing your self-esteem on them
---
Thats a no go for me. These are my old guild mates. We've been gaming, and doing stuff together irl for 10 years now. :)
---
Lot of guides on YouTube but it requires quite the investment to setup and understand.
---
I use auctioneer myself, still kinda complex to have it really work the way you want but less than tsm.
---
However, auctioneer also has less functionality. And if you are very serious about playing ah you kinda need tsm.
---
Is that realm really so fucked? I don't ever see anyone talk something good about it lmao...
---
That wasnt at all wht he was saying.
---
People really need to stop enabling the worst parts of streamers and the culture because "they're in character, man"
---
Both very valid systems. My favorite is GDKP.
---
Gold is bid on for each item, with rare and sought after items going for a lot of gold. Weapons like Mageblade commonly go for 1k+. All of this is given to the raid leader, which in turn, evenly distributes the gold from all of the bids to all of the members of the raid at the end of the run. Usually end up with 300-400 gold per raid night for each member. 
---
The richest members of the guild distribute their funds across the guild, and eventually get geared first, but they continue to raid after they are decked because there is gold incentive. 
---
It has its flaws but I believe it's the best system around, as long as you have a consistent group and a trustworthy raid leader.
---
nonononono
---
Lol yea you keep doing it. Why go through all that and pretend its "irrefutable" when you can just add the populations up? Like its super silly.
---
Sorry that it's harder to cheat now.
---
I didn't mean literally wcl. An entirely seperate thing parsing the file locally to emulate the functionality of spy, also allowing it to run on a second monitor.
---
Ah true, its because I have macro to change to shield in defensive stance and DW in others, changing weapons takes a gcd.
---
I would love to learn multi-boxing two characters and I thought of Paladin / Warrior as a combo. 
---
Can I have two Classic accounts on the same [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) account?
---
Lmao
---
I farted
---
Haha
---
It's only game, why you heff to be mad?
---
Also the proposal was no cancel after a bid. If you make a mistake posting, you can still cancel since there's probably no bids within the first minute.
---
yeet
---
Hey, buddy, lemme cue you in on something: Take away spy completely and it's even *worse* than what you described. They are supposed to gank; it's what that class is for.
---
received recently?
---
It's a pretty decent weapon tbh. Yes, it's not as good as other items, but it's still better than a bunch. The only issue is that it is very expensive but if you can afford it, go for it. I think by now everyone knows it's not the best weapon.
---
&gt;Eventually they essentially added DBM to the standard UI (just like they did with scrolling combat text).
---
Yes, and they did that because of DBM. Because it was an addon that eventually became absolutely essential to all players, as all raid encounters were designed in mind where everyone had it anyways.
---
If didn't have DBM, Blizz could probably have more simplistic raid fights where people could figure out themselves (like they can vanilla), and thus Blizz could also make more raids and more content, instead of having super complex fights on 4 fucking difficulties.
---
&gt;They also made content have scalable difficulties and lowered raids to 25 man and then to any size you want. 
---
It was a dogshit change and I hate multiple difficulties content, its better with just straight progression like in vanilla and TBC, even wrath up until iCC.
---
&gt;DBM didnt break anything
---
I 100% disagree, and even tho vanilla had "DBM" like addons, they were completly dogshit and unreliable in comparison.
---
Yes remove unique classes.
---
Yeah, now your raid won't see the absolute garbage-tier damage you've been doing. And if they do you can just say it's because they broke the combat log.
---
Addons didnt break retail. Class homogenization, removal of RPG elements, over abundance of wellfare gear, absurd RNG upon RNG and too many layered difficultiew with minescule differences to push fake replayability is what ruined the game. 
---
Both DBM and Spy were in vanilla btw.
---
The amount of times I fear someone and they just fear off and disappear.
---
Fear working too well!
---
100% you could target enemies from gladius in BC
---
Alright so flow chart time.
---
Spy goes off:
---
Rogue, click targeted and then they stealth... of well... time to AoE to get him out of stealth.
---
Mage, click target, time to cast stuff.
---
There is also this handy feature Target enemy player as a hotkey.  Might want to ban that too. (You don’t even have to click it! Just bind to a hotkey and BAM targets nearest enemy player!)
---
I can only tell you to not pick dreadmist
---
Only if they improve the AH interface at the same time. Otherwise dealing with AH would be too annoying.
---
Those gemstones aren't a guaranteed drop btw, and most people in a pug group want them. It's a 1 in 5 per boss, then another 1 in 5 to get it if one drops
---
Where was this even mentioned? "wow classic patch notes" turns up zilch. Source appreciated.
---
DBM had nothing to do with the point you are trying to make  
---
Blizzard (conveniently after being bought by activision) made the game very inclusive to casuals and therefore raid content changed. It has nothing to do with DBM, and everything to do with marketing the game to the average gamer
---
yes it's by far the worst quest void zone in the game, with having to do constant back and forth between arathi/hillsbrad/desolace/thousand needles/alterac to grasp enough quest
---
then you have the 40-50 bracket with nothing more than 4 dungeons (uldaman, zul'farrak, maraudon, sunken temple) with ton of quests, and lot of areas with many chain quests bouncing with each other.
---
Lvl 53 here, did every dungeon exactly once and i have a ton of 40-50 quests that are grey or green because i couldn't do everything at once.
---
Yeah. silencing differing opinions doesnt mean you win and doesnt  mean you are right
---
Deleted all of my characters and moved from grobbulus about a month in a half ago. Friend told me of the shit storm that was about to come. Really glad i moved!
---
Honestly, if they'd just make an exception if zone=raid, that'd be a great situation that wouldn't harm anyone. Just like zone=raid means you can't get accurate XYZ coordinates anymore after WoD because addons were too strong (Kormrok, Archimonde especially forced this decision I feel).
---
Actually, addons in Vanilla were significantly more powerful than modern addons - and near mandatory for high level raiding.
---
For example, you had the ability to create one-button macros that activated all of your trinkets and automatically selected what to cast based on whether or not you had a proc. You could have macros re-arrange your raid in response to spellcasts or automatically select targets/ranks based on dynamically changing conditions.
---
A great example would be the original Decursive. This wasn't a set of unit mods but a single button. Press it and it would decide the highest priority (if any) player in a raid to remove a debuff on... and cast it on them. As a Mage on Lucifron, you could literally spam this button until it greyed out and then return to Frostbolt. Heck, you could write a macro to combine de-cursing with Frostbolt.
---
You didn't have 'details'. But you absolutely had dps and threat meters. They were a standard part of every raider's arsenal.
---
While it could be argued that addons during Vanilla didn't have the degree of polish of many modern addons, they most certainly existed and were widely used.
---
Wrong
---
he also uses less of it and it regenerates more when the tank mitigates more and the fight takes longer
---
**there's a REASON why prot exists as a spec**
---
Just use deviates if it bothers you
---
Cool
---
World of warcraft isnt a living breathing world. Other than content patches that introduce new raids, nothing changes. The only major change to the game world was when cataclysm launched. Just because players kill each other doesnt mean it's a "living, breathing world". The world stays the same no matter how many quests you complete, no matter how much corruption you purify.
---
&gt;If you're just going to raid log and run MC once a week, what's the point?
---
Because there's hardly any endgame content, and because people dont want to corpse hop 15 times to get to an instance. Those are not problems by themselves, those are symptoms of larger issues.
---
I might just hit it as well, especially since I won't have to work half of December, so fingers crossed.
---
yeah it's really quiet there (my soulshard farming spot for p2)
---
I love Razorgore.
---
Could be. I was running Classic on a potato, and so were most of my friends, but that's just an anecdote and not real data. We were teens/kids and didn't have gaming PCs.
---
It’s private
---
Big if true.
---
At a lot of auctions you actually can set a price for them to not sell it at. I used to go to auctions with my grandpa a lot as a kid and he would occasionally do it if he had something very nice to sell. Also its super common in car auctions.
---
pve server here, we have an increase of our population in the starting areas
---
Rend and Hamstring procs WF.
---
Is this their solution to decrease the queue times? Sheesh...
---
Surely you can blame the game for what people love it for. Maybe you're just on a pvp server cough cough*
---
With this kind of mindset you'll never achieve anything...
---
This gives me flashbacks to the frozen throne, blinking through dungeons like maiev
---
If you don't want to world pvp, why would you play on a PVP realm? It's one distinguishing factor is the ability to world PVP, no?
---
The difference in outgoing damage is far higher than the difference in incoming - you use your shield a good chunk of the time on the last boss.
---
There's also the fact that the point of a DM:E jump run is being very fast so you can farm them - doubling or more the time they take to run is not a good thing.
---
Honestly, it would be smarter to 3 man as deep prot.
---
How much does Pristine Hide of the Beast go for on the AH, has anyone ever seen it?
---
In vanilla we got guild temp. banned for griefing on world boss.   
---
That meant having lvl 1 alts running getting killed on kazzak, people lvl 60 suiciding intentionnally (both same and other faction).  
---
What did not get counted as griefing was group of 5 people rushing the tank and killing the tank, or killing the healer legit way.
---
usually the DD is a random in these runs
---
BGs are releasing soon and the Spy addon is being nerfed.
---
Congratulations from &lt;Cozy Boyz&gt;!!!!

Hero class of vanilla for sure
---
And yet you opted to come comment about what people were and weren't saying. 
---
Not great at this are you?
---
Double sappers into 2x frostbite crits into arcane explosion crits and nothing resisting, not sure what else really you were expecting. 
---
Plus from the looks of it you weren’t being targeted
---
yeah and that reason is raiding you imbecile
---
I’d be more than happy for blizzard to implement a reserve price. But without that functionality it’s not right for the game to hold your gold hostage and allow you to follow auctions that won’t complete. If the bids didn’t take your gold when you placed them, then that would be another thing. But that would cause even more problems.
---
Azshara underwater node.
---
Well I don't think blizz is going to get to the end phase and do nothing.   But then they're going to have to make a choice, appease the no changes crowd, or make money because people get bored quick. 
---
Shouldn't be hard for them to pick a path that's cheap and already working with a BC migration server so we'll hopefully see that and all the fixes to weird shit they packaged into it.
---
Why would a guild give nightfall to a shaman? They can't attack while healing!
---
Either that or just be a rogue in stealth. You can get spotted easily if players get near you but at least you don´t get spotted from max view distance
---
No one is going to reroll and again lvlv up, they will just quit
---
Yeah...
---
This is not exploiting, but rather using the game mechanics for your advantage.
---
Same as reseting or kiting dungeon mobs by jumping on ledges and other obstacles.
---
Blizzard allows this behavior.
---
Just for curiosity though... What happens if all people with King buff leaves from the dungeon and non buffed person stays?
---
Could Ogres be non hostile as long there is atleast 1 King buff in the dungeon?
---
That's how people play these days and they are the ones who complain they have nothing to do
---
So you're saying 2vs7 isn't impressive...

---
As two mages, no not really.
---
Many of the bosses in BWL have some of threat reduction, or tank switching which can easily fuck up the raid.
---
Even the guy in the depression room is super threat sensitive, all the dragons. THen you get chromaggus stuff with amp damage, so if you are using shadowbolt during shadow vuln, you might very well wipe the fucking raid.
---
Aq40 rdoesn't have a full tank &amp; spank fight like Patchwerk and pserver logs are not very helpful as literally a handful of people even played ret pala there and I doubt they went into AQ40 with full consumes and worldbuffs to maximize dps there.
---
Stealth. Stealth is the ability to pick all of your battles at max level.  You use it and only pick battles that you know you'll win.
---
Bye, gtfo

Okay, just wanted to confirm what you were saying in so many words
---
Oh sorry I forgot to add that to my reply. Definitely agree with you and don’t think it should be added to the game.
---
&gt;Both DBM and Spy were in vanilla btw.
---
DBM wasn't, and  I can't remember spy either. I remember Big Wigs (I think it was calld) which was kinda lik DBM, just way way shittier and also unrelible.
---
Err what macro can make any enemy player targetable? Share it with the subreddit because you are the first person to find it...
---
I'd say I'm low skill as I am new to wow and classic in general, so warlock would be my best choice?
---
Exactly what I should be thinking I just have that "I should be lvl 60 yesterday" thinking,  with holidays around the corner I will be able to play and spend time with my family, I'll take a chill pill and enjoy myself =)
---
he said save it like "put it on your bank", no need for it in MC though
---
It's the only horde favored pve server afaik.
---
I'm glad Spy exists, it's getting me BGs in a few weeks!
---
Aslong as he doesnt delete his previous char, "in a moment of appifiny", i dont see the harm in rerolling.
---
I love it. I just wish it went further and actually showed you on the mini-map where they are
---
Yes yes, virgin virgin nerd nerd. Let me know when you're ready to leave the kids table and try to refute my points instead.
---
You can't, and you know that, because it's well known what Classic is. Just admit you're not suited for this game and move on. Don't attack the game itself, because it does what it does brilliantly.
---
&gt;About 30 trillion memes and jokes about people whispering otherw ”YOU ARE THE BOMB” in MC because its what the addon would do if you had it. Shitter or not - the core thing was still there.
---
Yes, and you would imagine today that if people are watching their god damn chat that they could also watch their debut slots. Raids in vanilla are not complex at all (which is a good thing) but people who complain about how easy they are also using the addons that half-way plays the game or them.
---
If Blizz just nuked that addon I think people might even enjoy MC more straight away. 
---
&gt;Ofc DBM has had a huge impact on retail in trivializing fights - same goes for Weak auras. But its SUPER low on the list of things to change to make me consider trying retail again.
---
They basically had to implement DBM into the standard UI anyways, so its too late for retail. Along with adding a dam dungeon journal to explain every boss mechanic before you even step foot inside the instances/raids.
---
Not surprising, for me at least. I have tanked dungeons while leveling my warrior and it is so much more stress than just playing DPS. Trigger happy hunters and multi shot will be my end one day.
---
10/10 troll lol
---
That's pointless, if someone lists something valuable for a ridiculous bid then bots are going to bid immediately. It may as well not be able to be cancelled at all.
---
&gt;BGs are releasing soon
---
Almost 3 weeks and with faction unbalanced I guess hirde should be able to roam in btween BG. We’ll see but Going pve is not a bad bet in his case
---
Funny story about number 3, I've got over 2k DHKs and can promise you're wrong.
---
Please change your username to soGrumpyRed
---
Ehm correction. It got us massive log nerfs, that can potantially break a lot of other addons, so thax spy!  
---
Deathballs for honor and whiney pvp players gave us BG's early, not SPY.
---
SPY FANGAYS ON SUICIDE WATCH.
---
Banwave waiting room for people still using this blatant cheat
---
You can hope that is the case. but how many of those PvE realm dudes are gonna be queing up for BGs at the breakneck rate that horde will? 
---
Queues will be long for horde because horde wants to pvp more AND OVERALL there are more horde players
---
If you made a mistake on something valuable, there will be a bid because people set up bots to post bids on valuable items.
---
how does anyone not afford that.  More like, how can you afford the time of getting 40 characters to 60, even with multibox powerleveling.   That's a lot of time and effort.  And then arguing with yourself about who gets what gear.
---
still tho, mages stronk
---
I never had the urge not to use it. I think it should be nerfed severely, moreso than it was today, but I see pvp as a test of intelligence. That goes beyond the in-game mechanics.
---
Pagle-PvE is seeing a spike in new people. Definitely re-rollers.
---
Definitely.
---
No denying that.
---
Sure let's go with that. In my opinion deranged is trying to make something it's not - as in trying to make Classic a non-brutal world pvp edition of WoW, which it most certainly is and should stay as.
---
I work but I have similar game time. I usually save up rested xp and grind in the corner of the zone XD. For example, there is a pretty hidden place in Tanaris with lvl 48-50 turtles that can be farmed in peace most of the time. It's where you complete Coergo's Gold quest.
---
This guy vanishes
---
It’s a radar hack that any other game would ban as an exploit. Just further confirms that WoW was never intended to be a competitive open world PvP game, rather PvE with PvP tacked on.
---
With backstabs on 1.1-1.5k and ambush on 1.8-.2k crits. You erase anyone but plate wearers.
---
With the current state of pvp you can't really expect to stay on to some1 for stunlocking for more than a few seconds. 
---
I say base your choice depending on gear
---
Can’t blame the guy for being a video editor first and a keybinder s-th
---
Why isn’t knowing the timer for boss mechanics sufficient?  You need 6 progress bars telling you when abilities are going off?
---
Do you need buff timers?
---
Do you need to see your inventory?
---
Do you use completely stock UI and no addons?
---
Are you mentally fit to understand why anyone programs any UI mods that serve a logical purpose?
---
I completely agree with this solution.  Because in that situation, it is the faction that is overpopulated that has multiple guilds leaving.
---
in the real world current situation on blaumeux, yesterday 2 large alliance guilds transfered servers, weakening an already overwhelmed alliance population.
---
*insert jack nickolson gif; the one where he creepy smiles and nods his head*
---
You'd need to level up a little, then.
---
Everyone is dead at different places (arriving at different times), people are in different groups and their purpose there is not to PvP but to get to the instance. On the contrary the horde's purpose there is to gank and PvP so they are not going into the instance so even if they are not grouped the fact that they are not moving will gather them up. Add to that the horde that are going to instances that will stop and "help out" since BRM is horde controlled anyway and you get the situation pictured.
---
Even if Alliance would organize a massive raid just to get a few people to BRD and UBRS they would need to organize a complete massive amount of people compared to their total population while if horde does the same to counter it's a rather small percentage of their total population which is much easier to do.
---
The dps is more than enough to meet the required dps to kill a boss. Threat is not an issue. Mana is not an issue.
---
Happy to answer anymore questions.
---
More pvp servers than pve servers. All the big servers besides Paggle are pvp as well.
---
Higher % of pvp players want to do bg then pve players as well.
---
Holy Priest who doesnt like to gank and hates Spy here /wave. Keep boohooing champ.
---
Stonespine is horde dominated server, but not by much.
---
And what I've been told the Alliance guilds on Stonespine are really good.
---
From my own experiance when it comes to WPvP it seems rather fair, I often get killed by large groups of allys and I also see large groups of hordes running around.
---
no, the difference is his healer is completely decked out as well and has no problem handling him in full DPS gear
---
OP's current healer would probably be able to heal a prot warrior with actual mitigation armor
---
fight takes a minute longer, but you actually clear the dungeon instead of wiping
---
How is bloodfang? I was thinking of transferring there from dreadmist...because it's "medium" pop I thought it might be better for ally?
---
I’m in the same situation as you, I’ve been going slowly and I’m now half way through 51.
---
Take your time, always going to be new players and new people to play with.
---
Lol loads of guilds raid with wbuffs. It's a small time investment for a much smoother raid
---
If someone posts something truly of value for a low bid then many people will bid on it. Not just bots. And the price will increase through the duration. You know, like an auction.
---
Didn't mention anything about faction ratio but if you dont like that please make a post I'll comment why I disagree with you
---
Pserver had disparities and they did just fine. You may die couple times or you make an invis pot, ran to DM:E, died there, ran to DM:N. 
---
It only added like 5minutes to your run to the dungeon.
---
The madness we are facing currently will slow down. People going for 2pc blue PvP set for PvE will be done soonish and the hardcore rankers will have 5minutes travel time after each BG. Also as it stands now with crosserver queues, the playerpool will be so big that horde premades might want to camp alliance for 5 kills until honorless in the BGs lengthening BG games.
---
Yes, you will be killed, no you wont die 25 times from Thorium to BRD entrance.
---
Your melee are dying because Rag's AoE knockback gives the tanks a threat reduction even if they resist the knockback. 
---
To solve it your melee should eat some knockbacks so they also get the same threat reduction the tanks are getting.
---
There was another time, not in one of my groups but a friends group. There were 2 brothers one was the raid leader and the other just kept teasing him about bad leading and he ended up kicking him out of the house and made him go to their moms house. That one was caught on stream https://clips.twitch.tv/InnocentProtectiveLorisFeelsBadMan
---
Fine, but if you're suggesting that a bid invalidates cancellation then a cancel feature to protect posters from accidents may as well be completely committed because there will be immediate bids that will invalidate the feature when it's needed. The fact that non-bot players might also bid on it doesn't change that at all.
---
The last few days I have barely seen any Horde in ~lv30 areas, it feels like a low pop server from vanilla.  Although, I did get the boat to Menethil and it was like walking into Kings Landing at the end of GoT there were so many skeletons on the ground.
---
What if I told you corpsecamp is not pvp
---
Male Orc stun resist works better vs warriors, rogues and palas. Undead Rogue works better vs warlocks, priests and warrior fear.
---
[Female undead has the better animations of the two imo.](https://classic.wowhead.com/dressing-room#sVzz0zJ89cM0zM9V87MzAE87cMbx87kMbe808MbC808Mbt808Mbv87k) Check out the unarmed, Attack 1h and Special 1h. Female undead has a flip.
---
Have you even 3 manned it?
---
Because I have as fury testing how far I could push DPS tanking, and we could do it with me in over 50% tank gear and a rogue DPSing. My tank gear isn't spectacular.
---
With 40-50% T1 I'm pretty sure we could have duo'd it.
---
Iirc you don't have to sit and wait. You can be out in the world doing other stuff while waiting.
---
And 10min is nothing compared to the dungeon wait times. Looking for tanks and/or healers.
---
How wonderfully ironic of you to whine about this
---
You're missing something.  They're not saying paladins are a racial.  They're saying (in bgs) or groups with paladins alliance have a pvp advantage regardless of racials.
---
Not really, I did this a couple nights ago. You put a shield on for wolf form and that's really it. One nade handles the imps, and only one wave comes if you can DPS.
---
Do you think I'm sitting in zerker stance with 30% armor mitigation and under 20% avoidance or something?
---
It's normalized for Multi-shot and Aimed shot but Auto shots are a big part of your damage.
---
You can play WoW casually and still get a lot out of the PvP content, WSG comes out in a few weeks which gives you a BG to mess around in as you level up, depending on how long it takes you might wind up with AB out by then.
---
Then you can simply log in and join a BG, queue time will vary from most likely instant as alliance to 1-20 mins as horde but it's almost always very consistent for the time of day you're on so you can plan accordingly if you're horde 99% of the time.
---
Rank 11/12 should be doable on about 10 hours a week of consistent PvP, but that's just a guess and it'll vary from server to server, faction to faction.
---
I personally used to play about 40 hours a week during vanilla as i was a uni lad and it didn't impact my social life, now 40 hours is the entirety of my awake and able to do things time, which includes socialising, missus, etc so i had to decide between achieving less or skipping classic but it's honestly to fun to not play just because some stuff is simply out of reach IMO, even if you previously could do it.
---
I know your point, I just don’t care about your point.  I didn’t miss anything.
---
Also, you do realize these a children that you're calling cringey and pathetic Lmao. 
---
Imagine calling a 12 year old pathetic for his or her choice in entertainment
---
roll a pve forum then
---
Kill trading could lead to a ban.
---
If you make greater fire resistance potions mandatory you’ll probably get him since no dps should die. Also I if you run 8-10 mages as mentioned they should spam fire ward (and ice barrier if frost). Aboard about 1,8k damage every 30 seconds. Potions on top of that and you’re set.
---
Everybody gangsta until the shaman procs windfury
---
Rune of Portals costs 20s. &lt;3
---
PvP as in killing players is fine, pvp as in "I can't do anything unless I cleverly abuse the boss" is not fine imo.  
---
Also, same faction pvp is not okay ;D
---
roll pve forum
---
Pets vs rogues are mostly to distrupt stealth tbh.
---
It's not too bad if you have competent tanks. Only Razorgore is a bit of an issue, but I don't mind wanding a bit. Even with 10k+ shadowbolt crits I've never actually pulled aggro on Chromaggus.
---
I'll stay and fight but it's gonna be hilarious.
---
Don't put that much effort man Iam not even sure those guys reads reply like this. it's pointless, 90% of them won't listen to logic.
---
The thing is, it's not even PVP 90% of the time. they are some nice battle which aren't one sided, but it's clearly a minority. It's mostly unbalanced PVP ghost fest which is fun for one faction usually. 
---
Hopefully Iam horde
---
 TP - &gt; BRD is at least 30 minutes corps run to go trough every layer of horde player. 
---
Iam personnal enjoying de hell out of P2 but I know allies aren't for the most part. Clearly it doesn't seem good for the health of realm population
---
You killed 7 half afk targets who were to bad/didn't care to do damage back. Very not impressive.
---
Or a little bitch with 0 pvp skills, like 99% of alliance
---
You have to use serpent sting to prevent vanish.
---
The render thing is something I hate in retail and classic, I dunno when the change came but I feel like my character is me without my glasses rather than an actual warrior.
---
Always hated this stupid render thing, but hey Blizz don't wanna buy better servers
---
If you have like 10g to spare, you can pick up Thornstone Sledgehammer. You don't need gold for your lvl40 mount, and the mace would last you a while, until you can get an upgrade from ZF.
---
That's its average price on my server but I dunno about yours.
---
[Replace see with move and there you go.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQvL6eX_BFE)
---
If you feel bad for playing too much now it’s probably how you are as personality. It will not change sir:)
---
Just be happy with who you are. Just play when you don’t feel bad about playing. 
---
I have never felt bad about playing instead of real life commitments. But I am also not able to be addicted to playing cause I am easily bored and will get bored of everything in life after some time.
---
Consider yourself lucky standing 1 on my realm was 190k the first week. Top 2 were sleeping 3 hours a night.
---
yeah they have no idea how few people on pve servers actually want to queue battlegrounds (or will for an extended period of time)
---
I was actually extremely surprised as how little the npc/pc render distance was in this game and that you didnt have an option to turn it up. Im basically new to wow but have played almost every other MMO out there. They really should at least up the maximum distance.
---
LBRS can be done at 56 with an understanding group clearing extra trash for you, but the rest (strat, scholo, ubrs) should be 58+. You'll pull more, you won't hit as well if you need to. You would be fine healing it if your gear is good, but most 57s only have a few good pieces at best. Definitely can't do any role but heal till 58. 
---
I think the strat meeting stone even says 58-60. 
---
If you have everything you need from BRD, I suggest trying LBRS or even UBRS jed/rend runs, since those are much easier compared to a full clear.
---
actually big brain. get r14 easier than everyone else, transfer after, GG
---
alliance are so fucking good right now with all the 1v2, 1v3, 1v1 (8 levels behind) training the horde have kindly provided I would be surprised if horde win a single battleground besides heartseeker horde.
---
I've been having a blast on Grobb which is fairly balanced but tipped towards alliance.
---
i think the original poster is
---
The pattern is extremely rare.
---
On my server it's really easy to get into Strat groups, even as a dps. Even easier if
---
the fuck u getting downvoted for?:O
---
&gt;using this exploit at various flight paths. Just to put it into perspective, I inspected the players who are abusing this exploit and they had 3 times as much honor as me despite having half my kills as a solo only player.
---
could you just not log out during the sheep duration?
---
gonna be fun as fuck to watch
---
And the first one that spawned. Would've gotten azuregos but that's when I realized just how zergy horde is. 
---
We had about 100 people. Horde was at I swear over 500. And this was at like 2pm
---
I agree that the problem would not have been so bad if there was less people but let's face it: PvP system in this game is just bad.
---
* Having only two factions inevitably lead to faction imbalance unless the stars align and there's absolutely no mechanic to help the outnumbered faction. 
---
* World is not designed for PvP at all: besides a few guards in town, nothing was designed for meaningful world PvP like strongholds or objectives.
---
* Rewarding lvl60 to farm people between 48-59 and is just plain stupid 
---
* Big raids vs raids battle have next to 0 strategy: it's just "who can deal the most AOE in a burst" game balance is not made for this
---
* The honor system is just a glorified kill counter that makes you compete with your own faction on who can put the most time into it.
---
Farm black lotus mate. Once you figure out the tricks of the trade you’ll be making that mad gold. They do go for on my server 100g though
---
Who is criticizing? Im stating a fact.
---
A day in the life of an average horde player.
---
You thought shaman were the only Casino 2 handers around? Guess again kiddo.
---
There's a console command, which I don't remember exactly, that turns down the glare and its a real eyesaver in places like tanaris.
---
Really, your settings shouldnt matter too much because you should be playing in a well-lit room and taking a 1 minute break every 30 minutes to focus on objects far away/rest your eyes, as doctors recommend.
---
yes
---
NE water form was my first Holy Shit, I literally just walked a game character for an hour to get somewhere.
---
Horde will most likely queue in, hearth to Kargath for BRM or BB (fastest way to Theramore?)/Light's Hope and keep on farming in open world.
---
If only one person is needed to queue up the group, they will have mages/shamans going to pop the queues with instant summons back to the farm spot.
---
BG rollout might ease the situation a little bit but it will not be a solution.
---
From experience on using dual dal rends hemo spec vs dagger spec (gutgore + cht).
---
I'd say swords &gt; daggers in pvp at least atm. Sure dagger does a lot of dmg and it's fun ambushing people for 1500-2k dmg but that's just it, your'e good at finishing people off or people who have resurrected at 50% hp but for overall 1v1's and so on, swords are definitely better.
---
Getting down voted because I'm asking a question. People.
---
That depends on how long the queues are.
---
Kazzisup
---
Vendor or DE that shizznit, don't waste a bank slot on it.
---
Problem with loot council is that it might bring forth the worst in ppl. Within the council itself and the players interacting with it. 
---
I would try to exploit any council in real life by default. I will do anything I can to get an edge as long as it’s not directly hurting someone else. It’s probably due to a strong emotion that nobody can tell me what to do and get away with it without me trying to “revenge”. 
---
Dkp works fine because there is no human interaction. It’s just a system that cant be manipulated and one does not feel manipulated by it. 
---
So I would say dkp has less drama.
---
At least you still have the opportunity to get your succ. I abandoned my quest to make room and now i cant find it. Put in a ticket but crickets was blizzards response
---
For an example of an idiot, I present this man.
---
Those are the kills you will always remember :D
---
&gt; have to wonder if a person low on meters is bad or just not registering with only live-logging as a reliable option
---
Doubt it will matter for now, MC is a cake walk and only a few fights the DPS actually matters Domo/Rag really
---
It's a part of the puzzle.
---
So Classic is not trying to be Vanilla huh... Whats the next thing blizzard is gonna bend over for just because people make a few thread about it?
---
Being on Mograine it's like 50% zerging in world pvp right now. Having a short notice right before you run around a corner and get jumped by 14 alliance is somewhat nice. But for the other 50% its just annoying to not have the option of jumping someone (or getting jumped) since they always get a warning and start looking around (as do I).
---
It pulls data from the combat log, in the exact same way as spy or threat meters or dps logs
---
That's lame.
---
Thats how they destroyed their game in the first place, by bending over to whiners.
---
Unlike the allies who choose to be corpse camped by 100m+ raids and they are enjoying every moment of it. Not frustrating at all for them.
---
Doping in sports?
---
So ban every single addon then. DBM plays for you, Classic Cast Bars plays for you, Classic Aura Durations plays for you, Omnibar plays for your, Titan Panel plays for you.
---
#FuckSpy
---
Well, honestly, You're not going to gain much honor from these big, extended fights with the honor splitting and DR anyway.
---
This guy doesn't even have deathcoil yet - so if a warrior comes along and attacks him, he has no CC.
---
In WOW nameplates show through walls anyways, so what are you on about?
---
According to the in-game tooltip it's only gray civilans, those that are lower level than you.
---
What the other guy said. I just meant it's used but doesnt have more than 30 minutes of content a day to read through.
---
Ohhh woahh
---
Deadly Boss Mods is also a hack, following your logic
---
Shadow Weaving or Blackout.
---
I was making a joke to show an example of people who talk big, but you showed proof nice ;)
---
good
---
Yep. Spell batching is a colossal fuckup. The game plays like shit. No one wants this.
---
stack or one ?
---
Why is this getting downvoted. This is funny.
---
xrealm
---
Also SSAO, 8XAA, better ground textures, animated grass that moves when run into. 
---
I highly doubt any of that prevents the range from being hightened. But I was a bit flabbergasted at he previous commenter; as he clearly thinks classic looks like vanilla....
---
In WoW you can see nameplates through walls, there is base Wallhack in the game, Wallhack means nothing in MMO, it means something when you can headshot someone through a wall, crazy i have to break this down.
---
Im not sure if this is common knowledge but enchanting materials have no vendor price and thus no auction house fee.
---
I can’t believe I didn’t know there was settings for it. Thanks.
---
On my guild last log no one took more than 5k dmg as melee which is easily healable with a bandage, and you have nothing better to do when out of melee range usually anyway
---
I actually used spy to avoid getting ganked. Thanks blizz ya fuckheads
---
You'll learn what mobs you can and can't use it against. If you have a wolf you at least always get the buff.
---
On Ragnaros you'll probably only want to use it if he submerges.
---
You can keep the shaman as enh but position him on his own on rag's side so he's out of range from both tanks and dps cluster.
---
Couldnt care less about your opinion, DBM is literally a cheat. Delete it.
---
Oh look! Another post about whining Alliance players.
---
No you don't.
---
Am I the only one who caught The Office reference?
---
You mean you can't count 100+ enemies from hundreds of simultaneous combat log entries in superhuman speed, while also focussing on pvp itself? Weakness disgusts me.  ^^^^^jk
---
Can't they just straight up disable it like they did with the LFG addon?
---
Okay then it's good. The line would look something like /castsequence [noform:1] Dire Bear Form, feral charge
---
And play with a reset code. Sorry I'm on mobile so bit hard to write a macros freehand. I'll post it to you after work if you haven't solved it.
---
One thing to take into account behind this phenomenon is also this :
---
More and more people are hitting 60, and have acquired all their preraid, leaving PVP, farming and Raids as their only real reason to log in, and some don't really care about pvp.
---
Of course the population isn't going to be as active or present as it was in the first phase when the only endgame currently available are Onyxia and Molten Core, both of which can be cleared in one night.
---
Although I won't deny unbalanced world pvp in some realms have discouraged a certain amount of people.
---
They literally made it better tho. Now every stealth notificiation is ACTUALLY important
---
Render distance is larger in BGs. I don't know if that was also in the beta but render distance in BG's was like at least twice as much as out in the open world back in vanilla.
---
So DBM shouldn't exist as well?
---
Because
---
applies to DBM as well.
---
&gt; I never heard about the pop caps, I still knew a PVP server would be a horrible choice. So....someone with zero on-hand info, still knew it was a bad idea to roll on a PVP Server.
---
Oh man shut the fuck up there is a reason most people consider PVE servers for casuals.
---
PVP was much more bearable and enjoyable and of course you would say you had no clue about the population caps which are 5x the size if not more.
---
Point is PVP servers were by far the most fun classic experience and were not *half* as ridiculous as they are now.
---
Anyone who played back *then* would have thought things would not be that different now. I played on a "mega server" back then and the sheer number of people online at level 60 at the same time out doing ganks is just not comparable to anything we ever did back then.
---
If you thought PVP was going to be like it was back then, it would have been fine and enjoyable and the preferred way to play for the vast majority of players.
---
What Blizzard did is make one change that had huge ripples in the whole community. They underestimated the fact that thousands more people would be reaching 60 quickly and with good gear because everything is known about the game. And the underestimated the fact that between that, little content left for the average raid ready person, and of course the huge population cap would create a huge PVP field unlike anything we'd seen before.
---
But clearly Blizzard isn't very aware of what they are doing and just riding this game's 15 year old coat tails.
---
BGs are a good start, but they are plugging leaks rather than getting ahead of these issues.
---
AQ40 is gonna be crazy too for this same reason and we will have another experience that is unlike anything that happened in Vanilla, although I imagine server crashes will probably be like they were in Vanilla.
---
Raids hold 40 people so there was no need to kick anybody in the circumstances you describe and kicking people mid fight is bullshit in any case
---
If you do PvP I highly recommend getting the chest if not it still has its uses like the MC elemental packs which do a random targetted 3000 damage spell.
---
You want equip some +stamina gear to get to 5000+ health to not randomly die. This chest with +100 health gives 400 HP alone which is massive.
---
If you are alliance with kings its even more.
---
They cant you dummy, you know how the addon works? They would have to LITERALLY remove the combat log all together.
---
Cant use abilities while mounted. Slam on horse I hence not viable :(
---
Those runs take quite a while, but that's rather impressive! Shame it can't be done Resto.
---
#SomeChanges lol
---
BGs are a whole different story on the Legion client (aka Classic)

everyone is always rendered and targetable

How is Piptik still alive?
---
&gt; It pulls data from the combat log, in the exact same way as spy or threat meters or dps logs
---
Everyone knows this by now. People aren't debating how it work. Its more of if it should be allowed.
---
A good solution to this would be that the combat-log doesn't register enemy players actions or spells, unless they have affected you.
---
But its up to a matter of opinion what would be "best".
---
No. The Spy addon works by parsing the combat log. It used to have a humongous range, much further than your rendering distance. Any buffs or debuffs applying/fading are reflected in the combat log.
---
So if you were to stealth in something like 200-yard radius - it would notify the user. Same with getting/losing any buffs debuffs. Due to the way Classic client handles all of +hit, crit etc items, they are also considered buffs, just hidden from you. Bliz has somewhat patched that recently by limiting the combat log distance to 50 yards though.
---
I don't believe honorless targets is working, period, unless I'm missing some caveat. I camped the EPL FP for a few hours over two nights with my guild and I'm a sergeant. We've had plenty of roaming kills but a LOT were through people landing at the FP.
---
I don't think you have to do that.
---
The battlemasters has been in the game since launch and we are officially in patch 1.12/1.13.
---
Has there been any official word on that? I heard people say there would be x-realm BGs as well.
---
They probably just ML'd it to him straight away if hes the only enha. No self respecting warrior will take Sulf.
---
I mean yeah, that's pretty damn accurate lol.
---
Thanks for your input, it really enhanced this discussion.
---
same way you use any other software you'Re not familiar with: google a guide.
---
Only people who have been rendered can be tracked, which means the tracking range is as small as the render distance. That is absolutely the point he‘s trying to make.
---
that will be $5, nudes are $15
---
Our raid had a similar but not as happy situation. When split raiding she survived with 11k hp.
---
Which means I'll have to keep Recount, Details and a dozen other DPS meters addons up-to-date in case I join a raid that uses a specific one of those said addons.
---
Make DBM mandatory. So everyone can see the cooldowns and knows what to do. You have 16 debuff list, use them wisely for making higher dots prio. If you have hunter heavy, make sure one of them is 5/5 hunters mark talent and let him use. And again for hunters, make sure they have furious howl 4 pet and place them in melee dps grps with trueshot aura. Every possible user should use fire prot 4 set gear. Make sure everyone does their rotation well. Communicate with wlocks and make sure every wlock knows their target to banish. Assign the healers, and tell them don't heal anyone else if not assigned to. Using food buffs and if possible tribute buffs before raid (if u can reach the rag less than 2 h). Dont underestimate the food and stam alcohols. And in raid, be clear with comms. You can do it and good luck with it.
---
Should I save food to sell on AH or does it not really sell?
---
Realism was completely beside my point, but I guess that's your go-to narrative in order to escape the main point - which is that Classic is what it's supposed to be.
---
Hello,
---
Im starting to rip my hair off trying to make my bags show free space number.
---
Ive tried with standard ui, bartender, dominos and combuctor so far.
---
I think im just missing something super easy, please help.
---
Only if they have no castbar addon.
---
will it fuck with combat logging for raid logs ? Will it fuck with Details! accuracy for dps meter in raid ? (Like, I guess I could be 50 yards out of someone else on a fight like rag.). 
---
Or these things have nothing to do with it ?
---
I have a busy schedule as well, i just play at my own pace. Many people in my guild are 60 with a reroll that's already higher level than me, but i don't care much. Lvl 42 druid and swapped to a mage for a change of gameplay, level 24 right now. Leveling is fun :)
---
I play a Ud warri with the same weapon and slam spec. My damage is +- the same as with normal 2h specc, so nothing lost but a little more ineresting to play. However, i feel as i progress my gear i start to struggle to spend my rage and prefer orher abilitys to spend my rage faster and use slam only occasionaly.
---
LMAO, Horde is 80% Undead just for the racials because they’re garbage at pvp
---
I use it and have to admit it's very handy but yeah, I agree it would make the WPvP situation far better for everyone if it were removed and I wouldn't protest it being removed.
---
They could maybe fix it by disabling this feature in instances.
---
roll a pve forum if you can't handle it.
---
Find a healer and a DPS, one has to have Mining. Then do DM:E Jump runs
---
fk blizzard .
---
why they ban spy ? just  because rogue is the most population , so when they compliant to blizzard ,   say they can not enjoy the happiness of  Stealth and suddenly kill someone then run .  then blizzard must satisfy their request , and other      people can only become the ghost under their sword?
---
Uther has a skin in Heroes of the Storm that's essentially that [https://i.imgur.com/4eVXtLr.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/4eVXtLr.jpg)
---
You're right, I don't know. But neither do you. I don't get how you are sitting here talking like you're an authority figure on how WoW's game engine manages the combat log. Like do you work for Blizzard? Are you a data scientist? Or are you just another asshole on reddit parroting things he's heard other people say?
---
And once again, let assume you know exactly what you're talking about and ~~destroying civilization as we know it~~ disabling access to the combat log is the only way to stop spy.
---
Even still, so what? People can't use a few addons. Most people in vanilla didn't even use addons. That's just getting us back to the roots.
---
What discussion? You didn't post this for discussion; you posted this to whine. I swear to the gods, sometimes I want to pay twice the subscription fee to make up for the fuck ton of whining Blizzard has to put up with from WoW players. If it's not one thing, it's another.
---
Either you enjoy the game, or you don't. Fucking hell.
---
I think the lower level queue's might balance *some* by being hooked up to PvE servers. Lot's of people on PvE realms twink. Or simply get bored of leveling and take a break. 
---
This might relieve some of *those* queue times - but no where to the point of being insta-pops. I'm talking 30 minute queue's instead of 45 minutes. Big difference, but a big enough difference to make a difference..?
---
And since we're on the subject of lower level BG's... stay away from the 10-19 and 20-29 ones for a few weeks. You're insane if you think you're going to walk in there in your quest greens and not get face raped by squads of twinks. People most assuredly already have twinks made and waiting - I've seen them dueling outside cities.
---
Yea your pretty fucked if you as Alliance try plan your evening playing in east coast USA.
---
u/imatworksoshhh all your comments aged like fine milk! It's bEeN in VAnILla too. You fucking idiot xD
---
For me it was infinite strength and agility from repeatedly crossing zone boundaries with shaman totems. 
---
That was fun.
---
When I say parse, you're running around with your group, an enemy raid is incoming, and you can instantly see on spy the enemy has 19 people, 3 pallies 2 warlocks 4 mages 1 priest 2 hunters, 3 warriors, 1 druid, 3 rogues, and form a split second opinion on whether to flee or fight. If you can do that based on raw combat log text you're some kind of superhuman.
---
I'm one of those that just saw an interactive puddle on the floor and randomly clicked it before getting some rather angry messages about me ruining people's quests... 
---
And i'm probably not the only one, so good luck finding these, because there are many people with no clue about what that is for around :c At least i know now.
---
They wont do that. It would force namechanges and fuck up the AH prices.
---
best places I found were in the south of Azshara, on the cliffs over looking the bay. Lots of Naga, and you are miles away from any quests. Levels are 52-54, so you can still get XP even up to level 59.
---
Also, another good place is far north in Winterspring, Hidden grove or Frostsaber rock, mobs around 58.
---
rule: only play when everyone is asleep.
---
your kids or wife should never see you sit and play, but what you do when people are sleeping wont affect them. maybe you get 1-2hours a night and you make THAT quality time, play with friends.
---
Winterspring fucked, blasted lands fucked, felwood megafucked, wpl/epl fucked, southshore semi fucked (alliance are actually present here at a alli/horde ratio of 1:3). looks like its southshore again :)
---
A rogue is supposed to have stealth...
---
this sounds really cringey
---
Fucking good
---
A shield isn't THAT important for tanking. Even in raids you can tank without one.
---
A YouTuber called Skarm Tank has a couple of videos explaining it in depth, one of them is called "The (un)importance of a shield in tanking" or so.
---
At low levels, you don't have enough abilities or stats to make the optimal use out of your shield, so it's better to just use a 2H.
---
At first I thought the ocean was an alliance controlled zone, but then remembered those don't exist.
---
Hey man I feel you. I have a newborn that soon will be 1 year old, I have to work 12h a day for most days. And just before phase 2 i hit 60 on warrior. 
---
I got around 4-5h "free" a day. I dont play every day and every time I have this free time, coz i want to spend time with my kid and family. And when I play I dont always play those 5h, maybe few H, do one or 2 quests and then log out.  Some days when I got next day free play from evening into night, then im not disturbed by family and can really sink my teeth into game. There have been few 12+h gaming days when noone is home and I got free day. those days (have mzybe had 5 of them) I can make real progress. All in all I kinda like that I cant nolife wow, meaning i wont burn out from it any time soon, and when I log in game Im exited about playing and its not the chore. You can definatlu play classic casually. In this way I have 60 warrior  and 28 hunter.
---
That makes no sense at all. How do cross-realm BGs create any more lag than non-cross-realm BGs? There's still only 20 people inside any individual WSG, no matter what servers they're from.
---
And that sounds great!
---
Me
---
if you want to min/max go orc cause stunresist, axe spec and sp boost are really good
---
if you dont care about a few % then pick what ever looks the coolest to you
---
Idd, but a small part compared to the other parts.
---
edit ap boost not sp
---
That's great! ;)
---
So what's the next thing we move to whine about in order for Blizzard to change, lads?
---
No faction-based artificial queues? Too long grind to R14 so blizz should make it faster and more inclusive? Meeting stones not working? Lack of flying in Azeroth? C'mon we have to act fast!
---
Your UI man it's something..
---
I use my wolf strictly to buff me and never send it in to DPS.
---
Why not just run BRD? and turn them in on the way... as a warrior there is a bunch of gear you could use....
---
I agree! Perhaps we should suggest a fox for the OP, such as not letting mind control work on homeless targets? Or would that be to much free sport for your kind?
---
player render distance is determined by the server and not you're gfx settings.
---
&gt; couldn’t agree more. they’ve been abusing their population advantage in wpvp so badly
---
You sound like you think all hordes on all servers know each other and have some sort of agreement to abuse the alliance players?
---
People are just playing the game, different people with different goals. Imbalance comes from faction racial and how the servers have been handled by blizzard. Don't expect individuals to do something about such a huge issue.
---
Yes i do, ive created a couple of small addons my self, dont assume things about other people....
---
Seal Fate doesnt overtake combat until AQ and the dagger gloves are BiS until Naxx I think.
---
I baked a pie with the horde symbol on it!
---
Shouldn't fuck with logs, definitively will fuck with details if they don't increase the limit inside raids / dungeons.
---
found the rogue main LUL
---
Even if I played a fifth of that, I'd still be done by now. Classic has been out for months and compared to retail it's dramatically lacking endgame content.
---
&gt;Yes i do, ive created a couple of small addons my self, dont assume things about other people....
---
Lol are you serious right now? Because you've cobbled together enough LUA to say you've "made a couple small addons" you think you're enough of an authority to tell me or anyone how Blizzards game runs?
---
Get the fuck out of here dude. Maybe if you said you'd worked on MaNGOS or something, yeah I might take anything you say somewhat seriously. 
---
You are talking straight bullshit, and you have the audacity to call anyone else clueless? Not only that but you doubled down with this fantasy of thinking that makin"a couple of small addons" gives you any credibility. Have some fucking shame and just stop while you're behind.
---
 Or wait, is it possible that your uncle works at Blizz? Is that how you know so much!?
---
What they mean with that is advanced combat logging used for Warcraftlogs. Not the stuff details has access to.
---
I spend betwen 50-70 hours a week playing ontop of my fulltime job, wich means i dont have a social life outside of my online friends and guilds.
---
I’ve been like that for 10+ years though and if you have fun then whats the problem.
---
it *could*. There are players that name themselves after their own names. Or use nicknames/handles that can easily be traced back to their real identity. Any information that can directly lead to a person's identity is defined (by the GDPR) as personal information. As such it would be protected and you'd need their permission before posting it.
---
But I'm not saying that's a sure thing, which is why I asked if you'd considered it.
---
Go either full affliction or soul link + affliction (makes sense lvl 45+).
---
This guy plays alliance.
---
You only need to add all combinations if you want to keep the default flair selection menu. Which would indeed be ridiculous. A proper solution would be a bot that you message to set your flair, as reddit api allows combining multiple styles in the flair string. The CSS wouldn't be any more complicated, either.
---
They could also simply allow custom flair text on top of styles, and potentially make a bot that purges flairs that have anything other than server name, if desired.
---
Sounds like a chemical company that's sad it has to dump in a river for maximum profit.
---
I didn't know bubble+hearthstone gives you honor :)     
---
    
---
No retri joke yet? Had to add one, sorry :)
---
It updates in weird manners and there is too much data for it. The data details processes vs. Advanced combat logging is insane.
---
I don't care if Gladius could do that in arena. Ppl arguing that Gladius gave the same advantage as spyaddon are really fucking dense. You know it's gonna be 3v3 in arena and  you know there's gonna be a fight (duh) and yes, it gives users an advantage by already being able to target enemies before the gate even open, but you can not compare that to an addon that reveals otherwise hidden enemies in the open world.
---
My guess would be between 7890 and 10k people
---
I deliberately rolled alliance after reaching lvl 60 with my horde character. It's more challenging (fun).
---
I'm on a 60/40 horde server and felwood + winterspring are alliance zones now
---
You don’t even need a dps if the warrior/healer are geared. I’ve done like 200+ two man jump runs with various shamans and priests.
---
yes use the new piece, you lose very little and the stamina and 20 spirit is huge for leveling as rogue
---
That's a weird statement. I don't play PvP because i don't have enough time to level and gear up to match other people doing it. I'll definitely play in the BGs, though. At least i'll get to fight people of my level :D
---
Nobody gives a shit about your equipment. But if your character is easily traced back to your real identity, and your boss can find that you play wow and passes you over for a promotion (cause he's a dick), then it *does* have effect.
---
 "All the retail "#nochanges" babies"  hahaha you're the one QQing here like a wee kid! 
---
Nobody is forcing you to use any addons. Feel free to run with zero addons, but dont cry about how others wish to play.
---
That doesn't work.
---
I dont undesrtand all the whining
---
this game has always been about having addons
---
people called it world of addons back in 2005 for a reason.
---
\#noaddons
---
we have two atm. Works great. One in the tank group for extra threat (and resistance totem) and one in the beefiest melee group for extra dps.
---
I only use it for blacklisting people who ganked me
---
Addons don't have access to that file.
---
this.
---
It's been 15 years but i do know for sure that there was not such problem back in the day. 
---
Firstly, when player stood in Arathi Basin at the lumber mill - one could easily see and select players all the way down in the middle of the map. It's freaking 150-200 yards away if not more. 
---
Secondly, there are many pvp videos on youtube or gameplay fragments from vanilla days where the distance at which players starts to render is a much further than it is now in classic.
---
It would be far easier to allow us to set custom text in flairs (in addition to faction/class styles). If desired, a bot could be set up to purge flairs that contain anything other than a server name.
---
Guilds like APES show the 'Horde is the pvp faction' Meta is actually untrue... get an entire guild of skilled players and they'll wipe the floor with the Horde, even on their server Gehennas which is Horde dominated.
---
Unfortunately for the average player with average skill, the Horde is a more enticing faction as the 25% stun resist, WoTF etc bring their average shitness up to a higher level with no actual gameplay, kind of like bringing a bigger gun to a gun fight, you're all using guns, yours just as standard has an easier time shooting the opponent.
---
At this point 'lol just reroll' isn't feasible as people have sunk hundreds of hours into characters, if things get worse the only solution i can see is free faction transfers on the worst offending servers, locked to the Horde only, and perhaps some incentives to make guilds make the switch such as gold or items.
---
I know that last sentence sounds like a private server fix, but Blizzard has dropped the fucking ball here and the house is on fire and they're sat inside having a coffee saying 'this is fine'.
---
Formed an arena/anger/golem farm group and got this on our third run. Total tonight was 2 sashes, 1 HoJ, 2 omnicast boots, 1 second wind from 7 runs. RNGesus smiled upon us this day.
---
I've not encountered a raid yet that resets the +1 inside the instance. I assume because the rag loot is that much better? Does that work out well?
---
haha when I read OP and it said melee dying from lava burst I just knew it would be because some ret/enhance meme speccer :D
---
Oh. I only knew you could force them to attack the flight master, which also removes honorless target, but results in an angry flightmaster.
---
"go-to narrative"
---
you literally brought it up. You put it in all caps there cringe boy. that means it is more important than the other words
---
Soubds fund, never heard of it. Only shaman bug I remember is sentry totem related
---
&gt; but it will slow down pretty hard
---
It has already, on my server there is only a very low pop doing SS vs TM. Most people that pvp have settled between flying path and dungeon, or into choke and farm these easy targets instead, since it's easier and worth more honour than mass pvp. People will adapt, there's pretty much only classes with stealth that come to searing nowadays and they just have to die 4/5 times. Other forms mega pack and comes from further away.
---
He should have stayed as a lead encounter designer. That's his strong point. He is directly responsible for all raids and dungeons from late wrath to mid WoD.
---
Yeah let me just quickly read the chatlog and write a /target macro for hørød. Ez as pie. What was the combination again? Alt 245? No, alt 246? No, damn! Alt 345?
---
No advantage to see here, keep walking folks!
---
That is a massive difference, a 16x difference to be exact
---
\+shadow damage increases mana gained by lifetap and life drained by lifedrain so it's really nice for leveling
---
a lower hp/mana pool just means you need to sart draining earlier, stats outside of spellpower and crit/hit only really matter in pvp for us
---
Our guild does roll offs with each piece having a specific category like dps casters, healing shaman/ Druid or melee dps. Each person gets a roll for the first 7 bosses and another roll for the last few. There’s special cases like if no one else needs something and you’ve already rolled them you can still get it or if it’s a tier piece boe that doesn’t count for your roll. We’re in the process of tweaking it right now but I’ve been doing raids for like 2 months or more and haven’t seen an issue yet.
---
Ps. What’s the addon showing your cool down abilities popping up the middle of the screen for a sec?
---
YOu make 0 sense, what he says is true, 90% of what Spy announces is useless noise, not important information. Now 99% of it will be very important information. Specially Rip rogues.
---
&gt; watch out for people picking flowers.
---
Damn i love classic
---
At the moment PvP is impossible if you arent part of a group, you really are not missing anything
---
Way back machine!
---
http://web.archive.org/web/20031001171940/http://www.blizzard.com/wow/townhall/
---
It was DamageMeters in vanilla, recount was tbc
---
That won't work because it will shift you out of bear form every time you click it. This will just make you burn mana and be a Smokey bear
---
" Enemy units can be practically right next to me and it won't pick them up"
---
No, they can literally be within 50 yards and it will pick them up, quite literally what blizzard said, lol
---
What is thé debuff slots you are talking about?
---
Doesnt matter if you agree lol. Blizzard makes the rules
---
Toss me your ign and server and I'll report you. No sweat
---
The dude's losing at life it seems. Hateful man.
---
Spy is useless for anything else than roaming alone.
---
Very clever! In fact, since the rank system is a direct competition between your own faction, even better, they get this sweet honor to themselves while depriving others of it. Awesome.
---
Went in there this morning to be ready this afternoon.  Even horde on Gehennas seemed to have other stuff to do on a Friday morning luckily :P
---
Isn't that exactly what he said though.
---
Am I cute?
---
Don't worry about it too much, the biggest advice I can give you is don't equate playing wow to meaning you need to spend 10 hours a day on it. I've got a pretty demanding irl schedule as well and I'm lucky if I get 10 a week to play games. I started on launch day with a few days off work and got to level 30ish in the first week, I'm still not 60 lol. Just enjoy it at your own pace.
---
I'd love it if all addons except QoL stuff were banned, good suggestion.
---
No, outside communication with the other faction is not against ToS. Only the use of mods or exploits to allow in-game communication used to be against the rules in vanilla. But even there I don't think they care now.
---
Will you go to prom with me?
---
I’m lvl 47 right now and working on mats for tribal Leatherworking. Finished Feralas, ZF, doing Hinterlands. Any optimal path you’d suggest for a fellow resto shaman on the way to 60 to get BiS gear early?
---
We kill rag since week 2 of classic, this is the best strategy you can use to avoid melees being killed while remaining max dps on the boss.
---
With addons like DBM its no problem to do this, keep in mind just because the knockback cooldown is gone ragnaros not always immediatly uses it, so healers should swap to the OT and stay on it while the MT is calling down 3.2.1... before he taunts back.
---
Would love to hear if you get a smooth kill with this strategy, will take 2-3 pulls to get a feeling for it for the tanks and tank healers.
---
Find A healer (me). Reserve Orbs. Split with Heals.
---
This guy is so hated on Bloodfang, constantly puts his shitty vods on the server discord (even tho this one was kinda clever)
---
Spy is cheating, change my mind
---
Haha same on lakeshire EU. One (1!) honorable kill placed ne 121st
---
Same goes to you friend, name a player who was banned because of how right you are.
---
Azshara temple can net you some golden pearl as well.
---
Just nuke him down, use consumes and shit maybe, the only time i saw P2 was when we did it world first with half the raid being lvl 55-58 in full greens
---
New player here. What addons were you guys using in 2005 in Vanilla?
---
Just go through by post history
---
that is not true, user2 shared with user1 how they thought about the same thing and they have something in common. And lets face it "adding to the conversation" isnt quite exact.
---
But there was 2 reddit threads about this addon, its worth it to break the entire game for it :)
---
So I found out about Flarecore Legging and started looking around. Seeing they are a phase three thing really has me scratching my head.
---
Did anyone actually do this whole thorium brotherhood rep thing in vanilla.. I mean before phase three? If I'm reading the estimates right, you have an entire guild pour the entire crafting loot from about 15 weeks worth of clearing MC to get one person to revered. And that would get you the total of the dark iron leggings.
---
As for phase three.. I can't wait to be able to consider these really great FR pants after the time we get past all the hardest FR bosses.
---
an addonless world would be welcome
---
I guess that depends on what kind of food. Low level food won't sell well. But the end game recipes which are actually used in groups and raids could.
---
Addons were allowed in Vanilla.
---
# #SomeChangesIfPeopleComplainEnoughOnReddit
---
[Seems like the view distance was quite low in vanilla too lol](https://youtu.be/_WhEMCOAMu8?t=167)
---
Might be something when it's an entire raid coming vs a single guy
---
Your gear is more than fine. 
---
Im aliance, so at first i did it with priest friend and fury specced, that was kinda messy but doable. We just had to be cautious on last for mana drain to be properly los, the priest was dwarf at least - which helps a bit. 
---
I had worse gear than you do as well at the time, just with dal'rends instead. 
---
Now I'm doing it with a paladin friend, which makes things easier. Also I'm arms speced and with spinal Reaver, which helps i guess on both satyr bosses, because of the reduced healing with mortal. Also on last when he goes wolf - overpower is pretty major. I don't have eng built yet not does the friend, but in ungoro you can get item called "crystal charge" for 10 red &amp; yellow power crystals at the North pylon iirc, which is actually stronger than dense dynamite. We both pop it and imps are instantly dead. But dynamite should do the same probably. You can get the crystals by running around ungoro and collecting, or simply buy them off ah, in case you wanna try them.
---
We sometimes have issues at the sacrifice boss, even though we both run servant trinkets. RNG is sometimes just bad there.
---
You on the other hand should be fine with grounding totem.
---
And on the last boss, combination of your dynamite and shaman's Nova totem should be enough as well? I'm not sure how it works exactly, but i heard with Shaman its the easiest it can get. You can use aoe taunt to Keep the imps on yourself, is it not enough for the totem to finish them?
---
And i don't change to shield at all on last. I even Stay in berserk most of the time, battle just for overpower and SS when imps spawn, and have some health pots case of need as well. My friend is fresh 60 as well, with only few epics from raid and not even full prebis. But its up to healer how good he is, warrior can be worse geared and a good healer will carry him anyway.
---
60/40 isn't that bad tho. Its 75/25 here so even stepping outside Ironforge isn't safe.
---
Literally most of the PVE addons use combat log, what are you on about?
---
you sir are wrong. your party wasnt listed in gladius.
---
The buff should be the chance to explode doing 6k dmg radius for 50yrds upon death
---
Open world is not fair, you fucking snowflake. Get out of this game.
---
It does affect how far away you get the text from, i mean use your brain bro.
---
lol, not surprised to see this coming from someone called "Gankman100"
---
lol grats. Now put that to good use on Pagle or else your rogue license is revoked :P
---
Mining jump runs on my alt warlock.
---
10 mins? LOLNO. Maybe 25% of all servers are alliance-dominated, rest is horde-dominated. And those alliance-dominated servers are smaller too. And most of them are PvE, which means less people queueing to BGs from these servers too.  
---
You'll cosider yourself lucky if you get 10-min queue once in a while, usually it'll muuuch longer.
---
That's why I downloaded it initially.  
---
I heard it was an add-on you could setup kill-on-sight lists.
---
I was pleasently surprised by the extra features it brought
---
Hope you didn't run the wetlands gauntlet. 
---
Use the self service to unstuck ( https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/32275 ) on you character. It'll teleport you in front of Stormwind.
---
Note: You must use the website and not the ingame tool.
---
Go to the dwarven district to learn new skills and get the flightpoint there and in Ironforge. After that you hearth back.
---
If you say everyone is withing 50 yards of each others on Ragnaros, you have never killed Ragnaros.
---
Spy doesn't save you from being stun locked to death.
---
Classic cheese and pepperoni are great, but I also really enjoy supreme or something like olive, onion and mushroom. The only thing I don't get is pineapple. I mean, I guess some people like it and they can use whatever toppings they like, but I personally don't get it.
---
Impossible to change your mind, it is cheating as all get out.
---
FUCK. SPY.
---
Outside of Ironforge? We've had rogues camping at the mage area IN Ironforge for the past few days now.
---
Nowhere is safe anymore.
---
It made every encounter into dodging random AoE shit on the ground, and moving to X spot at Y time which is also called out for anyways.
---
Having more advanced fights doesn't necessarily make them better imo.
---
How many PvE servers are there? 1 for every 4 pvp servers or so? Not NEARLY enough.
---
i feel tinythreat is quite accurate but the update rate is bad
---
I dont use it and i wont i aint afraid of no alliance rouge. But yea i Think its a very boring addon that should not exist
---
Moneymaking.
---
I find this is my greatest struggle as a raiding restoshaman. I had a spot where I could fish Oily Blackmouth through lots of schools, undisturbed, for some nice gold per hour. However that only lasted for about a week then the prices dropped from 22s a piece to 10s a piece. Essentially halving my income. What other ways might there be? I don't find jump runs interesting, even as a herbalist.
---
The "system" was bad 15 years ago. But we got what we wanted, #nochanges amirite
---
Well, it was just about going into bear and using charge i guess. More conditions can be added for sure, that's basically the simplest form i could find
---
Addons cant access that log. A third party programm maybe.
---
My gm is crafting it for free too and he's getting a ton of hate.
---
Yes it does, if the master looter is not present, the roll switches to need before greed. It happens all the time in MC if you are trying to decide loot and the raid continues clearing and gets too far ahead, all Greens and higher go to roll rather than ML.
---
Yeah, addons that were shit in comparison to what people use today.
---
I walked from stonetalon through the cave to ashenvale. Not that difficult.
---
Dude..
---
  His point was was aimed at people saying that combat log and spy were pretty much interchangeable. Which they are not. We use those addons because they are indeed massively helpful.
---
Yeah, a wizard will do it. Sure. To really balance it out, you need 4x more PvE realms than we have now.
---
funny, the last time I mentioned that ratio on this sub I was ridiculed for thinking it's "acceptable"
---
Yeah I just never played before dungeon finder. The game is so impersonal nowadays. Back in cata/MoP I played with the same people for sooo long. Now I’m just an npc playing with a million other npcs.
---
Hang in there Skeleton.
---
For cast sequence to work, you have to press it more than once, which will trigger the /cancelform each press :)
---
They didn't though. The only functionality that was changed was being able to automatically invite. It works just fine otherwise.           
---
You can see a "group" for everyone who mentions a dungeon name in any(?) chat channel, on a list. You can then use said list to whisper those people without seeing all the irrelevant dungeons or messages you arent interested in.  Theres also the option to make a group that sends messages, but I havent used it.
---
Not to mention full dots can literally kill you from full if you don't stop to heal. We can't even get in goddamn range. It's even more brutal for Horde rogues thanks to humans being able to pop Perception whenever Spy tells them a rogue stealthed.
---
Well my personal suggestion was to just remove enemy aura detection of enemies or even just other player characters, who have not tagged you or a party member.
---
The 50 meter distance is still quite high and does not help a lot with the main problems.
---
Dude HotS skins are really awesome! Really love all of them, pretty unique art style!
---
You do realize you rogues got fucked harder :) Before this change i couldnt care less about stealth, that could come from 200 yards away from a rogue fighting mobs, now i know for a fact its a rogue close by, ready to shield up ;)
---
Not the sharpest tool in the shed huh?
---
Im realist. And since world goverments clearly dont give a massive F about what China is doing, why should i?
---
I am not. I am just playing other games for a while. Then I may level alt after (probably wont).
---
Enemies can only have 16 debuffs on them at any given time. In a 40 main raid, that's a very real concern, which is why warlocks are only allowed one curse and spam shadowbolts, and why any item that places inconsequential debuffs (like skullforge brand) is a bad idea in raids.
---
You got herb to 300 without realizing what black lotus is? You stupid?
---
I have a family and starting a new job. I took 60 early abd efficient, now I just log 2 days every 13 day to do the raids. Can still play it casually and enjoy things, dont sit for 10hr straight, try and aim for 2-3hr per evening. I also have one evening I dont play, where I hangout with my wife.
---
uhm. dont you get rid of the pvp tag in like 5min from just being inactive?
---
I got lucky enough to get this not too long ago, my advice would be to install ClassicCodex and pay particular attention to Andorhal in WPL, the area is filthy with bloods because nobody wants to be in that god forsaken cluster of undead.  Bring some free action potions and a shield, use and equip these before you loot the blood, then hamstring the 1 or 2 mobs that come out and you can get away no problem.  Also, there are plenty of alternatives to SGC that aren't as much of a god awful grind, a cadaverous armor is a more realistic piece in the mean time, or maybe an ogre forged hauberk.  The best thing about the chest piece imo is it's so good for tanking and you can just make res groups for dps pieces you need if you're willing to tank.  One last note, BP of Chromatic Flight is a great pvp chest, one of the best.
---
Our usual pug wipes on rag are due to the dps bringing no pots at all, healers are usually oom pretty quick which inturn leads to a wipe.
---
Check your dps healing when they move from air, alot won't bandage or pot and just stand they're
---
Oh okay, I don't use /castsequence myself, good to know. Thanks !
---
Time to start your Rend grind!
---
I'd say it's probably a correct assumption to make about PvP and PvE servers because the more serious tryhard players (whom also are more likely to log raids) gravitate towards these server times. Meanwhile, RP probably not. So yea, the numbers likely correct for PvP and PvE atleast.
---
Nah, he could have replied with "this" and had exactly the same response...
---
I mean you don't get stealth at level 1. I don't see any downside to scouting as ghost really.
---
You could then make a gang of 59ers rolling without giving honor to people
---
You have no IQ to understand what he said. Unlike other rogues whining about the addon and stealth detection, this player liked it and liked the art of having to play around the stealth notifications. He is a rogue that adapted with the addon, instead of whining on the forums like 99% of them.
---
He doesnt have to engage them...  remain blue and unattackable?
---
Same! Gnome warlock back in the day, orc warlock now. Albeit also playing with questie, but the horde sure is privileged.
---
I guess it's to prevent hunters to use feign death to AFK safely.
---
You calling all Olympus members 12 year olds? Hahaha that’s pretty fucking funny.
---
I can't logic you out of a position, you didn't use logic to get you into.
---
Basic statistical analysis will even out these oddities in the grand scheme of things. As someone else stated, you are not unique. It is very likely that players with the same playing pattern as yourself exists on every single server.
---
I would change server. But then again I’m not pathetic.
---
Hold off until BG's are released before you reroll, you might get ganked a lot less
---
Thank you.
---
Such is the price of success. *pollutes sadly*
---
That's what they are attempting to do. By completely breaking it, it might break some other addons, so they are trying to use a surgical tool, not a nuclear missile.
---
With "Prat" installed you can click on links in the chat. Works for discord
---
All this classic circlejerk, oh my god, this will kill classic, this has no place in classic, you are ruining the game.
---
Jeez, people you need to chill.
---
Considering many people were extorting 200g+ for this helm when the pattern first landed, I don't care at all.   
---
How is crafting for 0 fee dicking over the other Blacksmiths, who most likely got the pattern from pure chance and have already made TONS of gold off of it? I consider free crafting to benefit more people than it hurts. You're comparing a handful of blacksmiths getting hurt to help out the majority of the warrior population on the server.
---
&gt; DBM wasn't
---
Yes it was, it was simple but it was in.
---
&gt;  I can't remember spy either.
---
Enemy spell alerts was something that existed in classic, it would outright tell you who was casting a spell on who and what it was. So you could literally see "MAGE casting POLY on PRIEST" if you were within 60 yards.
---

Are possible to reset the resistence that one demon get to the "enslave demon" after the demon be enslaved more than one time?
---
But we got to keep the rewards, which is dumb lol... (I tried it out for 30min and got 20 honour levels).
---
Yu stahp bein nob and git gud insted.
---
Seriously though. It's advanced addon so you gotta learn by doing and learn by reading. Don't expect to use it efficiently from the get-go.
---
or he could have replied a million different thing without any need for "adding to the conversation" in your definition. It added to the conversation for me, and I find it a better response than "this". This debate is totally pointless.
---
Addons, that are allowed by blizzard.
---
If you're a herbalist, just find the most preferred route in a high level zone and farm herbs there. You might get lucky with lotus too.
---
Winterspring is probably the best zone to farm.
---
The items for classes with high gold making potential usually go for more, with mage items going for a ton in my experience. Overall, you get less guild members just "raid logging" which seems to be a common sentiment among this subreddit. Gold making and resource gathering is encouraged as a guild activity, and eventually the overall pool of gold those high g/hr classes have gets dispersed through the raid. 
---
Your concerns are valid in regards to items that are shared between classes with disparities in gold making potential. That levels out over time though.
---
DOES THIS FIX EMOTES NOT WORKING AT A DISTANCE???
---
True, our server only has free horde transfers but somehow it seems the imbalance gets worse every day.
---
After 5 kills you get 0 honor for killing someone.
---
What do you mean? I believe you got the question wrong.
---
He asks how he knows it was longer not the other way around. That aside, the combat log distance was increased in Patch 2.4 to allow what it used to be before this hotfix.
---
"equivalent to wallhacks" ... he was not saying they are the very same thing.
---
those are boes though
---
not the same
---
Please stop embarrassing your self, alot of the addon we use today are 15 years old and existed in vanilla.
---
Congratulations on missing the point entirely, Paror. Maybe stick to reading rather than typing.
---
some addons made there own name plate system that allowed for longer than 20 yards blizzard kept breaking them but that dosen't meant it never existed in vanilla. just that blizzard at the time didn't want longer than 20 yards on the name plates. this fighting continued into TBC as well.
---
2 Greater Fire Protection pots on everyone. Pre-pot one of them.
---
We're standing in groups of 2 in range same as you. We've killed him three times now right before he submerges (although it's just tight, under 10 seconds to submerge every time). Mages and Locks can do a lot in this fight since they can just go ham. I noticed a big difference for myself when I swapped to Arcane Power/Frost spec as a mage and have been consistently top dps on this fight since.
---
You argument makes 0 sense, Spy is more usefull to escape ganks than ganking, holy shit not the sharpest tool in the shed huh? Literally breaking this addon HELPS gankers, specially stealthers, use your brain mate.
---
Two things you're not taking into account here:
---
1. Since BGs will be battle group based, and looking at wowhead census data, horde and alliance have an almost identical population; with this in mind queue times should be very fast regardless of what server you're on. This doesn't leave a whole lot of time for people do the method you described above. Also I believe that wueueing for a BG brings the entire group to the NPC once the game is over.
---
2. You're dramatically underestimating how much honor a BG will be worth compared to world pvp. There is a reason the battleground patch was known as the world pvp killer, outside of random skirmishes that happen naturally, it simply isn't worth it to go run around and kill in the open world with your friends.
---
Nice argumentum ad hominem
---
Healbot back in the day automatically showed you which targets to heal and would automatically use the correctly ranked spell. 
---
All you did was leftclicking onto the same spot
---
They went over the vanilla values.
---
I won the Flarecore Wraps pattern last night in MC, what is the going rate to craft the item for someone if they provide the mats?
---
Shieeeeeeeet
---
Took you 35 minutes to look that up, huh?  You still completely missed the point of my post.
---
Pm me and I'd be happy to answer every and any question you have.
---
I'm from the UK, and believe me, the prices in America are so much better, so $1000 is a fantastic budget.
---
I tend to put performance ahead of everything else, so if you're a flashing light and sparkles type, I might not be as helpful haha
---
I started recently. Am having a blast, thou it is a slow game, but im in no rush.
---
There is unfortunatly a lot of stuff that is common knowledge to the veterans, which is not easly obtained by newcomers. Learning as one goes, seems to work out just fine, which i also find quite enjoyable.
---
That may be true, but last week that gun dropped which was a huge upgrade for me as a hunter, and there are 6 more hunters in the group, so it can still take a couple of months for me to get rhok, while I could have gotten an epic gun right now. And now it went to a melee as stat stick. "You get Rhok" is a poor argument imo.
---
&gt;alot of the addon we use today are 15 years old and existed in vanilla.
---
How many 2004-2006 addons are you using? My guess is 0
---
Keep in mind, you have to queue at a battlemaster so you have to go to the battlemaster, queue up then FLY to somewhere if you want to WPVP.
---
For horde, you would have to queue from UC and fly to BS / SG to PvP, or queue from TB and fly to Feralas or something around those lines. Not exactly the best of options.
---
For alliance, instant queues for days, you won't see anyone out in the world mostly so horde will be busy doing what they always do - duel outside of orgrimar to pass the time.
---
I see what your problem is here. It is your job it takes away too much time if you quit it you could have more time with the family and also play classic and about the money thing there is wellfere so dont worry
---
Original as in before the hotfix? 200 yards. Original as in during vanilla? Something like 50 yards. 
---
The combat log distance was increased in patch 2.4
---
it's not my fault people need crunches to play a 15 year old game because it's not convenient lol, I would be fine with no addons because I never relied much on them in the first place
---
The easiest and fastest way is AH trading. Takes 10-15 minutes per day, gives a lot back.
---
B
---
That literally means nothing, equivalent to wallhacks lol, wallhacks is a certain term for a certain thing.
---
The standing 1 on the server should be 60% in on rank 4.
---
Get a life nerd, some of us have a job.
---
Ok Boomer, get good though.
---
and? how is what you said an argument?
---
It depends on the sever I guess
---
They didnt. Yell "they'll never fix it" well some did. I for one decided to use it as long as anyone else also uses it.
---
I felt bad for installing it, but most of the time when I target someone far away with it, they're already targeting me too (presumably by using the same addon). I use it so I'm not at a disadvantage, but would be happy not using it if it meant others couldn't use it either
---
I would actually love of there were addon free realms.
---
Placing out 4 totems at once? I must say, pretty sweet.
---
and I'm just sitting here, enjoying my wpvp with everything happening like I expected
---
Sure, lol.
---
You are the one at Blizzard HQ making the call?
---
That narrative is so funny where no one as no way to prove any of this.
---
Because they are post complaining doesn't meen that it's what they use to make their choice. 
---
Cause and effect can be linked by logic and still be wrong. 
---
They have way better metrics than every person posting here.
---
Your guess would be wrong
---
“Too difficult to fix. Plus we want to pretend Alliance are all RP freaks so they don’t notice the furry horde community. Have some pandas.” - Devs 2012
---
I like details because i want to know how much i can heal during a fight using one method, then do the fight again with another method and i can compare which is better at the end. Not gamebreaking or anything, just helps me improve. 
---
Also helps me know where i fucked up to prevent doing the same mistake haha.
---
I don't see a problem with mob HP addons. If anything, it just makes farming faster. Some fights you might flee thinking you lack damage, you can actually pull through with &lt;5% hp because you know exactly how much damage you have to deal. What do you dislike in this ?
---
Not using the others you listed though, so i can't really say much about these.
---
Thats what i thought.
---
&gt; No point in logging on unless the guild is going out to do something. 
---
This is always the beginning of the end in my experience. People start saying “let me know if we’re doing something”, then if you organise something “let me know when everyone is on”. Of course everyone can’t be the last to log on and start right away so less and less happens before eventually you have nobody logging on at all.
---
So you would love a game that isnt Vanilla, gotcha
---
On the server Ashbringer-EU it’s the opposite. No fun. Everlook is basically a Alliance city, Bloodvine Post in Felwood also belongs to the Alliance and you can be happy if you are not getting camped by lvl 60s as a horde when you try to level your lvl 54 char.
---
Lol love this, so true. Everyone likes to shit on the PvE casuals and then cries a river when phase 2 starts and they're getting chain ganked.
---
Heartseeker FTW
---
And not hitting invis before logging out...
---
Added support for poisons and a setting for how many minimum before it restocks (to avoid it buying reagents for 1 poison)
---
Others may have a different opinion, but i would say it’s radar if the mod gives insight into people in the area that are out of clipping range.
---
I don’t think(?) you can macro a key to auto face the target, but you can move back and forth to see when people pop to establish which direction they are in.
---
The guild im in lost 21 people already since honor started. We are on Skeram
---
It's like watching a train wreck.
---
How come the price of every material (felcloth, all essences) is going down pretty fast last week or so? I expected them to go up or at least remain stable with pvp out.
---
High risk high reward :)
---
I don't argue if it's correct or not, blizz has a greater picture, perhaps it would make sense if they'd tell me why (even if the answer is pure manpower they'd need to reset everything).
---
The cloak and shoulders wont get replaced for a long time even the chest..
---
I dislike it, but i use it. As a solofarming priest it helps a lot. Id rather "cheat" a little, then corpserun several times within an hour.
---
It require a bit of time but it's clearly worth when you manage to learn it.
---
Ugh ill still have my kill on sight beeper so better then nothing. 
---
FUCK OFF ROGUES
---
You don't HAVE to wait. Not only are dungeons faster and more viable if lvling is your goal but imo they are much more fun since people are with you.
---

---
He definitely exaggerates to play a persona/character. Considering how much he streams I find that kind of impressive to stay in character.
---
Not sure if sarcasm with dying once or twice, when it takes 30m-1h of corpse runs for alliance to get inside BRM..
---
Yes, I would see enemy cast bar as something  that helps a player but isn’t necessarily a good thing for the overall gaming experience. Kinda dumbs it down? That’s my view anyway
---
Details! Last night on Ony was not accurate. Every DPS was #1 on their own list
---
P2 started?
---
\- everyone on a pve realm
---
Just tank dungeons and reserve these items. 
---
You are just fine in fury spec and semi-tank gear (no leather and a shield is already ok).
---
Truestrikes+dalrend = fish for jed ID then do a jed+rend run only with MH reserved. Truestrikes are harder to reserve though.
---
Cape of baron is fine to reserve, remember to explain your group cape is reserved and mount isn't reserved when you set ML after rammstein
---
SGC find a lock then 2man arena with an agreement you do it until you have your sgc and your belt both. 3man it at the very least.
---
Want a secret trick? If you play on a Warrior it drops 15/20 times!
---
On my Warrior i couldn't stop seeing the Sash, saw it maybe 40-50 times in about 100 runs, on my Priest/Warlock, never saw it in 100ish runs
---
I read the thread thinking how happy I was being on a PVE realm, then I read your comment and now I'm wistful about it.
---
I got a 6 pack you play the dominant faction.
---
I literally brought it literally up. Literally.
---
Glad to see watching The Bachelorette didn't affect you the slightest.
---
Best solution is to remove shaman out of the meele camp, I guess. Let them stay at 9-10ish o'clock, when tank is on 12-1ish and meele camp at 6ish.
---
Yeah true and it's discutingly strong with a hunter.
---
Didn't think about the range which seem a good way to find where the guy is. 
---
But iam pretty sure that the basic config don't remove and update people that are already on your list. Might be wrong tho, but it's my experience toying with the Add-on.
---
Less demand pretty much. The prices of potions have gone up a lot on my server, that's where the money flows
---
Then: 14yo troll with little to no knowledge
---
now: 25yo troll with a little more knowledge
---
It's bis for BWL also, at least some of them.
---
Even with PVP I don't think the availability changes much. Even if there's more fighting going on in irontree woods, the same number of elementals end up getting killed as before.
---
On the other hand, less people are farming gold and scouring the auction house.
---
I'm not sure how to think about this specific point, because as a druid, i often go offrole into dungeons while i main resto. And when i need on healing gear, people get mad.
---
Well buddy i originally wanted to heal but since there are no tanks available, at least i can cover for that, doesn't mean i shouldn't roll on the gear i actually want honestly.
---
Grats! Now you can go corpse camp alliance even harder. xD
---
I know you refer to yourself as stupid, but.. you have heard of Google right?
---
Totally expected a rog to open on you the second you landed in the pit
---
You mean to tell me people dont enjoy being cannon fodder for the Horde?  
---
They don't like being corpsecamped at least 6 times between the Flight paths and their dungeon entrances?  
---
That is brand new information!
---
Yes... and additional fun fact? 50 that rogue is going to be getting in to stealth a lot farther away than 50 yards from you.
---
It might help you now and then, but it’s going to be a lot less useful than you think.
---
I'm honestly heart broken. Been levelling my beautiful BT (52 atm) and man, all time spent only makes me love him more.
---
Waste on a shaman
---
he doesn't understand what area is.
---
I ran it on my parents' 2002 emachines and it was so bad that the "death effect" button was unclickable because my computer couldn't support it. I didn't find out that everything is supposed to be greyscale when you're dead for years.
---
I remember I couldn't use the zeppelins or boats because I'd get stuck in infinite loops.
---
The exact instance orgrimmar, stormwind, or ironforge came into view my FPS would drop from like 20 to like 10 or lower and if I tried to actually enter them I would drop down to like 1 frame every 30~60 seconds at like 2am and during peak times would just outright crash at the gates if I was unlucky.
---
If I ever had to change continents I'd end up at one of my brothers' friends' houses knocking on their door and they'd answer every time with "You got stuck on the zeppelin again didn't you"
---
Eventually they collectively got so tired of it that they pooled together $60 to buy me a Geforce 6200 and another 256mb  stick of ram to cram in my computer.
---
Was so great seeing orgrimmar for the first time after 6 months of avoiding it like the plague.
---
Yea, and they severely limited it back in like 1.12. Man I was upset back then that my healing add on didn't let me use one button anymore.
---
Tl:;dr below comments, but the data wouldn't be accurate.
---
Just give it a couple of weeks and it's likely to have calmed down. I don't mind a bit of world PvP every now and then but I don't play a PvP server for this reason. I want to play WoW not ghost simulator.
---
I'd argue it's closer to 12x. You'll comfortably have the 90 degrees in front of you covered
---
Path of exile 2 looks somewhat promising.
---
There's something else in the game besides hitting a lifeless kobold?
---
- everyone on a pve realm
---
My friend told me that Details! retrieves data being written to the text file that is generated for logging.  I had never heard this, but I did some googling and found many other people saying the same thing on  bnet forums and reddit.  If this is true then Details! will be the same as before assuming Blizzard is correct in saying the hotfix will not effect logging.
---
For PuG wipes I can understand this being a problem, but we're all still pre-potting GFPP and melees bandage from time to time. As long as no one dies I don't see healers running into mana problems, the odd deaths seem to be the real problem as too many deaths will drag out the fight due to overall lower DPS, which will cause healers to OOM sooner or later.
---
Does anyone know of a classic addon version of spell announcer?
---
I'm not that knowledgeable on Rogues, but if you spec into all the sprint talents etc doesn't it last for a total of 18 seconds? From when it was activated in the AH to when you get blinded that's around 30 seconds and it continues after blind. 
---
After doing a quick google I couldn't find a spell that would reset sprint but I did find a video that details how you can get extra time out of your sprint by disconnecting for around 3-4 seconds. This exploit is documented in this video: https://youtu.be/a38wxn-cjcw?t=1050
---
I think this is what the horde rogue player was doing. I'd report to Blizz.
---
Thanks for your insights, the rage pooling tip is a good one as long as the tank keeps sufficient threat before WoR.
---
Also, drawing a bit of a blank here - GUID?
---
yesterday evening, a random T1 priest item drops in MC. Guild leader is of the kind "I attribute loot, it's a dictatorship, shutup".
---
I'm fine with that as along as the dictator is benevolent, which I currently trying to determine.
---
Apparently one priest wasnt happy about who got the item, because after a while he is suddenly kicked of the raid, kicked of the guild, and the GM says in raid chat "see, this is what happens when you piss me off about gear"
---
Guy says a quick goodbye on vocal, but apparently is far from become uncivil or ravenous about it, so I have my doubts about what happened.
---
Many people comment "awkward"
---
No explanation came.
---
I'm less than a week in that guild, already noticed the newly 60 buddy war prot has gone from full greens to half purples in the couple MC and ony raids we did, while I got zip.
---
My future in this guild is very uncertain XD
---
Dude are you dumb?   
---
Again for you: 200 crafting cost on an item, that some one is going to use for **5 phases.** 
---
&gt;How is crafting for 0 fee dicking over the other Blacksmiths, who most likely got the pattern from pure chance and have already made TONS of gold off of it?  
---
Oh we just straight assuming now? Not every single BS has the pattern from day 1. And "pure chance" is part of the game wow and even more of wow classic. And this is the actual time to ask for money since it's already p2 people that play regularly have a stable 60 with a decent income. Some more dedicated players have a 2nd or even 3rd alt that are already 60. So you just gotta pain through this, it is part of the game. 
---
&gt; You're comparing a handful of blacksmiths getting hurt to help out the majority of the warrior population on the server. 
---
What is this logic of: "Oh you got a lucky pattern drop? Pls can you waste 15 minutes of your time for every warrior and slave for free for me so they can get their LHH?"
---
And you don't even think of the logical aspect of this: Why would any one EVER pick BS when they could get everything crafted for free? For the bop's? I don't think so. It makes zero sense. You could've been leveling engineering/alchemy and actually have more benefit than being a blacksmith since according to people like you other players are lucky bastards that havee to slave for you.
---
You have put literally 0 thought into this and it's actually pathetic that I am making the effort to answer you. If you disagree don't @ me cause it's literally bordering delusion at this point.
---
When I played my alt, I noticed there's significantly less PvP than when my main was that lvl. I suspect all the people who want to PvP are lvl 60, so nobody is killing people below 48.
---
If that's true, details might have correction from that, but considering you can always see another players stats despite them not running the add-on generally means they're doing it by combat log only.
---
Since threat meters can't figure out the rank of spells without being installed, they won't print any threat for players without the addon, and everything is calculated from the chat channels you mentioned.
---
They stack bra. You can windfury your weapon, and double dip with totem.
---
PVE servers have a strong influx of people who chickened out of PVP realms and rerolled.
---
I started using it after a debate with a buddy where he told me you're bad if you think spy is OP. Started using spy.... it's OP. But I use it now so I'm a hypocrite. Wish it was gone though.
---
Literally every single rogue who actually knows how to play this game didnt care about Spy. Its only the noobs rolling rogues complaining.
---
Agreed, the player view distance is far too short.
---
True but it's Blizzard who's responsible for lack of foresight to on this one.  Honor should have gone hand and hand with BGs as the server pop and ratios are multitudes higher.
---
Factions in an mmo = not pvp, so stop whining.
---
Remove it for just 1 server and this game can become become a lot more fun
---
You seem like a nice person.
---
I want you guys to help solve a mystery with me.
---
I finished the Rend Blackhand quest, and when I went to turn it in to Thrall... the blessing didn't go off. Nobody in Org had it on them, so it wasn't that. There was no good reason for it not to have happened. What I thought is that I sped through the dialogue too fast because I wanted to give my raid the buff for Ony, so I accepted his quest too quickly and he couldn't do the speech. That seemed unconvincing though.
---
This is what I think happened. A guildie had warned me that Thrall might be dead, and I was seeing some rumblings in chat about an Alliance raid. The Thrall that you turn the quest in to is a different Thrall than normal, who I believe WAS dead. Real Thrall is on the throne, Fake/Quest Thrall is standing on the steps for you to turn the quest in. So I turned it in to fake Thrall, but since true Thrall was killed by the Alliance, the buff didn't go through.
---
I mean, back in vanilla we used an addon and had people assigned to HWL each week based on estimated honor, the addon was called EHP... you just waited your turn in line.
---
Thats how retail got ruined, by the vocal minority.
---
Ah well, I'd just focus on getting your tank to 300+ FR, it makes everything so much easier if healers don't have to pay as much attention to keeping him up. If your positioning is good enough, there  isn't that much raid healing needed even with no FR gear on anyone else.

&gt;So, as I am browsing reddit I stumbled upon this post and this guy in the meme is my friend’s brother. So I wasn’t 100% sure about it and i screenshotted it and sent it to my friend and he said that the guy that posted this has been bullying his brother for a while. I assume the OP is a piece of shit
---
&gt;Update: https://i.imgur.com/bxKoqBe.jpg
---
Also note they posted this here AFTER responding to that person, so it's not like they did it without knowing either
---
OP confirmed Piece of Shit
---
I'll also point out that OP tried to post this on /r/WoW
---
She got embroiled in a lot of stuff when exams hit and she was too depressed to actually petition the ticket. 
---
Her account had actually lapsed on time and Blizzard let her put a month on the account even though it was banned.
---
Classic is about community. Friends.
---
I mean yeah if you're a social pariah I can understand this phase is tough for you. Other than that, just gather your friends and tear shit up.
---
its not mandatory for tanks at all in the slightest. No idea what you mean. It’s not even pre raid BiS. It’s a good piece for fire resist but you end up replacing it pretty fast.
---
Learn to play scrub
---
Because using tinder is too hard?
---
I'm a grown man, I don't have time to be an internet tough guy any more.
---
Thank you for your input.
---
Yes, Details definitely reads the combat log, and that part will be affected, what we're currently trying to figure out is if there's any hidden communication between different players addon, which would solve the issue.
---
Same
---
Your warlocks will bitch and moan cos it chews up a improved shadowbolt debuff when it procs
---
Git gud lol
---
Screw the whiners, they can find another group without stuff reserved. You're the tank, you set the rules because you're the most in-demand. Just reserve 1 thing at a time if you're doing UBRS so you still get interest from others. Wait until you're 10 people, fly into Steppes together all at once and ride in that way as a unit, you'll stomp smaller groups at least.
---
I wouldn't go as far to say cyber bullying, but I've certainly just stopped logging in except for raids and upkeep activities like grabbing Aqual Quintessence and fishing for my buff food. I'm basically running down my savings on buying consumables each week because I don't want to spend my evenings corpse running. I'll come back when BGs launch next month and binge on some AV.
---
You PvE dudes should be thankful for us industrious PvP types. We've been so hard at work down the salt mines that you're getting BGs super early.
---
This isnt BC and wotlk wich are both way worst game than vanilla. In BC and Wotlk you cant use Engineering items in PVP either
---
You might have misread my context?

Im debating that he ISNT selfish and infact whining about him making it for free is selfish from the people complaining.

Small indy company 'n stuff.

Imagine if we got off this us vs then mentality and understood that the majority faction acts this way regardless of which faction it is.
---
That is a nice feature I'll agree.
---
Why blatantly lie, or claim shit if you are not 100% you are correct?
---
Yeah but only works if you have everyone participating like that.  Outside elements can put a wrench in that if they dont want to play nice.
---
There's \*a lot\* less dungeons below cap running right now. Back in the leveling zerg you could comfortably run back to back dungeons with maybe 5 min of wait time. These days its a lot longer.
---
Hillsbrad is a big warzone, because people pretty much just go there for pvp.
---
I understand the frustration man
---
I’ve ran SFK 155 times now and haven’t seen a shadowfang or assassin’s blade
---
&gt;Just form a 80 man raid to escort you to brd.
---
20 iq.
---
Just revenge tabbing with demo-battle shout opener works for me. DPS will always pull aggro from you, just watch out for the healer and don't waste your mocking blow/taunts in vain.
---
The key for reserve is getting people who don't want it indeed: UBRS people will go for Jed trinket, or Dal-rend OH etc., people run strat for magistrate hat (also you can settle with stonespine cape as well if you get it), about arena idk, it's not that hard especially 3manned.
---
My guild is called Gnome on a stick. so. We' re looking for you
---
Dude...you're a warrior you have the easiest time to gear. Tank the dungeon, start the group, only invite clothies. Done. Simple. Stop inviting rogues, hunters, other warriors.
---
If you refuse to tank...you're probably never getting them.
---
I mostly play the game for battlegrounds and PVP content, yet this is exactly why I rolled on a PVE server. On my server, everyone knows Hillsbrad is the PVP zone, that's where the PVP players go, that's where we organise PVP events, and everyone else can play the game without being fucked by faction unbalanced raids. As the young people say - QQ PVP server noobs
---
Have transfers *off* of PvP servers become available? I quit Classic because I thought the pvp experience was what I wanted this time around, and I discovered with my limited playtime, that it’s extremely frustrating.
---
Yea by rogues who are too noob to stealth from further away to not get detected. Any player with skills didnt care about this addon.
---
Name 5 of those that are succesfull at this point in time.
---
There’s a reason why dying stopped being such a hard punishment in most games.
---
Where did you pick pocket at for the majority of your time?  What's your favorite place?
---
Dude I never seen someone get so upset over a post before xD like come on dude its reddit. Stop getting triggered and go with the flow.
---
Appreciate that a lot, going to give it a goon soon. Need that epic mount for BGs :D
---
You started the line of questioning that you now think is pointless? Well done.

That is why the world is as it is. And you are part of it.

Fury holds aggro better than prot...if you're losing agro you need to watch some youtube videos on how to tank dungeons.
---
And what are you? A dumb kid whos balls havent dropped yet and is still intellectually subpar?
---
looks like the main character from the movie "sucker punch"
---
I agreed... Any add-on limiting any class ability in the game should just be eliminated.
---
If you get triggered by comments in a subreddit by people you don't know, you've got a real problem and it's not the person behind the comments
---
I'll try to remember that as I waltz through stv, completing quests without a massive timesink.😁
---
Which imo is still the case. I got quite annoyed when I found out there is an addon for it. But at the same time I realized there cant be anything done about it.
---
If I could I would ban DBM, Weakauras and Spy completely.
---
I don’t think you understand the situation if you genuinely believe it’s how the game is supposed to be played.
---
I never got no changes... they won’t let me take my name I had in vanilla so I have to use another name!!!! BRING BACK FAP!!!!! I have been forced to go by Fop now.
---
I've been a victim of cyberbullying before and almost took my life because of it, so perhaps I have a good fucking reason to get triggered when someone tries to pull that sort of shit.
---
This is a bad change. This will inevitably fuck up Details!  or logging with WarcraftLogs. 
---
Yes, Spy may be disruptive but this has terrible consequences.
---
Took me 2 hours at 4am in the morning.
---
&gt;Developers aren't omniscient beings and there's a lot less of them than there are players.
---
That's exactly my point.  There are addons that have worked since bc being nerfed more than a decade later because they weren't on the developers radar.  Of the thousands of thousands of addons out there, there is no way for the developers to police them effectively so there will always be someone gaining an unfair and unintended advantage.  
---
If anything your example supports my point.  The values for guards were the same for everyone regardless of addons,  and were changed for everyone regardless of addons. Addons should never be so advantageous that every player is forced to download third party software to remain at a competitive level of play.
---
DBM is PVE though. I think when competing with another player in pvp its a little greasy to have an add-on like that.
---
Never actually happened
---
\- everyone reading this
---
I’m a prot warrior with herbalism. All I do for gold is circuits in Azshara. I track my gold every time, and using a regular mount in the middle of the day (worst time) I make 35-40 gold / hour. At night with a regular mount it’s 45-50 gold / hour. I’m buying my epic mount tomorrow and am really excited to track and see if I can push 60 gold / hour. Is it crazy gold? Nah, but it pays the bills, and if you farm a couple hours a day it adds up.
---
You could target enemies with Gladius
---
you really wanted sulfuras in vanilla for 15 years?
---
Wait how were you supposed to hit lvl 60 with phase 2 when its literally impossible to move 3 centimeters without beeing ganked by a group of 1745 Horde???
---
I been cyber bullied as well but do you really think people are being for real with the oh it's my brother post. You been on reddit for 7 years you should know by now they are just trying to be dicks and ruin the post. I mean honestly.
---
It has a cooldown
---
How? Most pulls have 3-4 mobs in the pack I zerker rage to charge, demo/battle shout, revenge main target and tab sunder even then in places like UBRS mobs fly left and right all time so I'm running around like a chicken who got its head cut off trying to taunt them off healers while dps dies
---
The guild “Cold Fusion” as far as I understand
---
It's not common to be an asshat about it. You need to be upfront about pulling shit like that so a player can agree or disagree to come under those conditions. Just kicking them without warning because a late-comer turned up is definitely not okay.
---
Sure buddy.
---
MC offers no upgrades for chest, cape, shoulders over the mentioned pieces. For some of them BWL doesn't offer any upgrades either.
---
It's not really reasonable to expect "people" to share the same view or do "what is good for the game" as a whole. That stuff doesn't even work in real-life.
---
Players have fun in different ways. As long as it is allowed in-game, it is what it is. Different goals for different people.
---
Personally, I wish griefing would be gone, and a more honorable-pvp environment would exist.
---
You're delusional
---
If i remember correctly 50yards but there was a / command that supposedly increased it up to 200 yards.
---
Pve if classic is your first wow experience. For us veterans it’s pvp since we would be bored of the carbon copy of vanilla:)
---
Dbm and similar also resulted in these stupid wod encounters where you have to play almost pixel perfect else you are oneshot.
---
It is an important place in the lore, I understand why you get the feels!
---
And you cheating.
---
It might be fixed pretty well, a guildie and I successfully hid from a pvp group outside BRD last night 
---
Absolutely zero chance they wouldn’t wildly AOE the whole area pre-nerf.
---
I suspect essence prices are going down due to the elemental invasion event coming. People may have had some stockpiled and are trying to offload before a potential price crash.
---
Mad argumentations there mate u got me.
---
Much obliged. Good luck to you in your scholarly endeavors; always keep in mind it's just a game and it'll still be there after you take a break.
---
when your character is created, it is given a GUID (Globally unique IDentifier), it's just  done incrementally, so the first character was given 1, second character created 2, etc. I am something like 83,000.
---
I played in this server, i think it's the first time i see it mentioned on this subreddit, kuddos to you my friend
---
The entrance to any dungeon from scarlet monetary onwards
---
Its just 30 copper, maaan!
---
Do you have any info about that? From all the googling I did it seems there wont be too many mobs to farm.
---
This isn’t world PvP.  It’s nothing like vanilla.
---
None said they need to share the same view. If they enjoy sitting on a fp for 12 hours a day with very little honour gain, that's up to them. All I'm saying is, for their own personal interest, it would be more beneficial to split to other zones as smaller groups.
---
Without spy, raid zerging will be limited to certain zones like Hillsbrad or BRM. People still raid pvp because of spy. They just follow the main road and then search around when they get a notification. I m sure I died countless times while farming Furbolgs in felwood because a 10man raid saw a spy notification and searched me out . Not even gnomish cloak can help me because they know someone is there.
---
You started long after BGs were implemented fyi
---
It's completely broken. Hunters can accurately tell where someone is w/o ever seeing him.
---
I'm not crying out to change it, I don't want that they should do it, but sometimes I feel that it's unfair that Whirlwind only hits 4 people, while the mage aoe-s have unlimited number. Sad warrior noises.
---
What kind of servers are you playing on? Welcome to Gehennas, we have atleast 10 HoR already 😮
---
Is Alkaizer the GM of that guild?
---
Watch world of Roguecraft. Rogues can completly obliterate anyone as long as they get the drop on you. Only exeption are mages, and that exeption goes away as soon as you get a free potion.
---
Any pointers, oh wise man?
---
I mean I don't have a technical answer for you but chainightning is so fucking fun
---
4x difference.
---
The change is in radius, not area.
---
Sounds exactly like what was inteded. Perfect!
---
Who gives a fuck about TOS. But if you grief others you are by definition an asshole and I don’t like you.
---
Yes, that's what I'm saying.
---
But sadly you are the other side of the 'dickhead' coin! you are the "I must defend my point even if I could have stopped and moved on! I must tell the other person they are wrong!!!!!!" so you are the keyboard knight vs the horde of keyboard warriors.... sadly both sides can just be as twatty as the other.
---
Mate you’re a warrior, why would you not make your own strat UD groups and invite anyone but any other rogue/warrior/hunters?
---
This is the biggest perk to being a warrior for the pre-raid grind, you make your own groups and rules, dps grow on trees but not tanks.
---
Cause he is a "gorilla glass 5" cannon with anti glass cannon artifices, anti stealth bitches dmg and spread love to the group he is into

Never have I seen someone live up to his username so accurately. Even when it's misspeled.

Im gonna try this for PVP: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUC2EQvdzmY
---
Cool:) I met my wife watching xhub;)
---
You've got a lot of options available to you
---
1) Start your own group with a Reserve on the item
---
2) Find a carry and pay for it.  I've regularly seen Dal MH carries sell for 200g - way easier to farm 200g than 62+ UBRS runs. 
---
3) Some people enjoy the farm of the game and the reward of finally getting the item - so you could just keep farming, but sounds like you've run out of enjoyment on that side.
---
4) Accept that you won't get it and move on to the next best BiS - often the difference is only very minor. Such as grabbing Mirah's song and Sword of Zeal which are quest and BoE, or Wyrmhide shoulders from the quest instead of TS.
---
A big issue with GDKP is that is discourages your raidteam spending gold on BoE items, and consumables.
---
Why would a warrior spend 1k gold on lionheart helm when he needs that gold to buy Deathbringer?
---
And why would a healer spend 30g on manapots for the raid when he needs that gold for Benediction?
---
The realms weren't as populated in vanilla. So it is different outside of player behaviour.
---
This is what you get for playing horde, eat it!
---
How can you have a hard time 3 manning with a healer? We 3 man without a healer
---
Glad i chose pve this time around, i was worried that things would be this bad on PvP
---
Streamlining PVP isn't the same as PVE. Making PVP easier removes skill caps were people are directly competing.
---
Nope, not really. It's just what I suspect, as the prices also started to drop on my server. I guess I just saw it as any more elementals available at all will mean more essences available, as the current ones are basically spawn camped everywhere. Prices might not crash, but they may decrease.
---
As Alliance, I would happily transfer from my pvp server Skeram) to a pve server due to my poor choice and not realizing how things would turn out. Except 1) Blizzard will only allow transfers to other pvp servers and 2) Alliance are not allowed to leave.
---
...I don't want to reroll due to my time invested...
---
I find it’s easier to use spy now. Before I got distracted due to its long distance. It made me forget that a horde was around. Now it’s easier not to forget that someone is about to backstab you.
---
Yup. And don't get me started on how detrimental to the game flying was.
---
Sounds like a PvP situation that would warrant a PvP response from the player.
---
Well, a server needs to share the same view if we want FP-camping to stop. If its not those 20 people it'll be 20 others and so on.
---
Yea, idk why some people do it. I wouldn't. I guess they're bored or waiting for something else to happen, or maybe they just enjoy it.
---
Small-scale Wpvp is where it is best, imo.
---
I like how she thistle tea'd a rogue on 2k hp
---
Well done Sir
---
Good luck to that. When was the last time Blizzard banned an addon?
---
Step 3: profit
---
wait..im confused.  Why don't you have negative 500 trillion frames per second like my server?
---
Yeah. It's not that difficult to understand, but it is hard to find information outside of how much RP it takes to reach ranks.
---
 stopping for lunch while running back? i'm on the biggest pvp server other than faerlina and it's not that bad
---
Too bad you will be using Nightfall every raid when BWL comes out.
---
Yep. I saw it. Thank god! As long as logs stay intact I'm fine with the change.
---
no.
---
Where do you farm at?
---
The Cloak of Shrouded Mists is not bad. True its not as good as the Cape of the Black Baron, but if RNG is kicking your ass, its a decent enough cloak. Doubles as a really good threat cloak for tanking too.
---
Your connection to a server closer to your home will be better than one farther away. Physical distance actually matters. 
---
Certainly I don’t think they should combine EU, NA and Oceanic realms for sure because you would have players from majorly different points on the globe, and as I said, that introduces lag for anyone far from the host server.
---
I had to use it tbh. Was impossible to play without when people can track you from 200 meters away. Especially as a shaman with all my auras.
---
"Rely on your senses"
---
More like, rely on your render distance

Hey that's my server!

Earlier today, we deployed a WoW Classic hotfix to all regions:
---
* The in-game combat log radius has been fixed, and now only displays information for units that are within 50 yards of the player.
---
This is closer to the original behavior of WoW 1.12, and should eliminate the ability for addons to extend players’ senses and detect enemy actions at a greater distance than intended.
---
This fix does not affect text logs that the game outputs for raid parses.
---
Yes, no high level has ever gone on a ganking spree in stv ever!
---
Why dont you use Frost Brand?  You stay alive and so do your totems.
---
this is true but /u/shamanlifer stated it never worked which isn't true there were times in vanilla etc. where you could go further than 20 yards via addons when blizzard didn't want you.
---
And then there's me, a priest, who got it on the second run because the tank had it already and I won the greed roll. I keep it in my bag to teasingly /flex on guildies :P
---
*Coughs in multi boxing*

Why even play alliance lmao

We have the opposite, like 5 eyes and 1 leaf. The hunters are foaming at the mouth lol.

Oh man, I remember that stream. One of his best imo.

That shaman on boat gives good honor though.

Some pvp trinkets do nothing against rogues i.e. lock trinket.

That's how I play RDR. Starting to play quests, end up chasing ducks and watching sunset for 3 hours.

Obtaining Sulfuras is one of the greatest accomplishments of Vanilla.
---
I think most reasonable people think that PvE and PvP addons should be judged differently.
---
What adding are a must in the arena? I use only frames and cd timers and that's it and still get pretty high rank
---
You're horde so it's no surprise you're having a good time :)
---
Wait this all seems a bit too familiar, is your guild named "Para Bellum" on Mograine EU?
---
Rogues : what does "don't energy cap" mean exactly?
---
workers play alliance, horde are jobless
---
How do I get them as rank 3?
---
all 4 TOTEMS, THIS IS LIT
---
No, this really is classic WoW. I played PvP in vanilla and played PvE this time around because I value my time.
---
Rogues aren’t even geared yet to one shot with ambush. This is only the beginning.
---
Feels bad man. Blizzard really likes to screw alliance players over.
---
It does kind of trivialize the game. I can't argue too much with that.
---
But I think that PvE and PvP addons should be judged differently. With more scrutiny placed on PvP addons, of course.
---
Remove it. It’s not true to classic. Unacceptable.
---
Can anyone confirm 100% that it is possible to buy an epic mount for someone else and trade it?
---
Situation: I'm a lvl 60 Orc, pvp rank 0, but honored with Orgrimmar. Can a guildie lvl 60 Orc, pvp rank 3, honored with Orgrimmar save me 100g by buying the epic mount for me?
---
If you meant World Enlarger, it requires gnomish engineering *to use* so if you're switching over to goblin it won't be much use to you.
---
Probably an unpopular opinion: Blizz should just make it so that something like a Spy addon can't work. It's wrong on so many levels.
---
To be honest, hitting 60 is not what it is all cracked up to be. Sure it is the end game, but my favorite part of WoW has always been leveling because you get a sense of accomplishment. 
---
Now this is my opinion of course, but it is a lot better than sitting there at 60, trying to find a group for an hour for a small chance at a best in slot item. You'll spend more hours doing this at 60 than you will leveling.
---
Like I said though, everyone is different.
---
Dont give up! Dont reroll!
---
BGs will solve alot of the issues u (and others) r having right now...it solved way back when and it will solve now. Trust me.
---
Theres no better place to farm honor than BGs.
---
The only place where i see things will still b a bit harsh is in BRM, but thats only cuzz all raid content is there.
---
back in da day (as i remember) as soon as BGs were released the world went back to its normal state...even southshore/tarren mills fuckfest stopped!
---
Remember, remember the 10th of december! :)

RNG is a bitch

Not the war's they be farming pants and bracers

The people that complain about WPWP on a PVP server are the people that should have rolled on a  &lt;del&gt;carebear&lt;/del&gt; PVE  server in the first place
---
Ow mb I misread, 240 it is for me than :)
---
This is not true. Prot (X/X/31) is superior to fury (17/34/0) for holding threat, period. If he's fury/prot (0/31/20), then prot is still superior unless he's in near full BiS threat gear, fully raid buffed with consumables, then its roughly equal if he's using a shield. There are exceptions (fights where you have enough rage to spam heroic strike), but the gear necessary for fury to exceed prot is not really in the game yet. BWL is where fury/prot starts to become viable, and its in AQ40/Naxx that it becomes the de-facto tank spec. You need something like hit capped and 30%+ crit for it to pass Prot threat, simply due to the innate threat boost that Shield slam has and how its 10 rage cheaper than bloodthirst.
---
Still, fury should be more than enough for tanking 5-mans and UBRS. But dps will be dps, and a good way to teach them not to pull threat is to let them tank the mob they pull. Just keep the healers alive and let dps handle their own problems.
---
Don't let that stop you! plenty of drama stories here about past retail. Give us the juice!

Take a look on YouTube for platinumwow, and defcamp and melderons guides for warriors, they will tell you everything. Ofc platinum is funny asf so you have the to look forward to. Just know that a brand new warrior with no gear or money being funneled your way, is going to be a very, very, long play through riddled with plenty of deaths. So make friends, and group frequently to avoid this as much as you can.
---
Ha ha ha ha!!! OP is basically complaining about the hard difficulties and emotional trauma of trying to flight path gank newbies but getting his kills stolen by some other ganker. Life is so unfair.
---
Some good info in these threads for other classes, so I assume the mages ones are good too. I've never played a mage myself though. Also you probably aren't actually stupid :P

this. people who complain about stuff are more likely to make posts about how bad stuff are. and people who enjoy stuff just enjoy it and are not in rush make posts like that. I enjoy wpvp and pvp in general and is main reason I play classic in first place. and for me phase2 is fun.
---
I never used it and never will. Just because other people need help for world pvp doesn't mean you HAVE to get it too. It's definitely not a necessity. And you are actually just part of the problem.  
---
What exactly makes this game unplayable without it?
---
I've 2-manned with a shadow priest, though no healer at all sounds like a real butt clencher. Not the bosses, that wouldn't be a problem, but some of the trash can be real annoying (the bats mostly, though the 54% attack speed reducing poison also sucks). Do you simply use a mage and frost kite the adds to death? That'd probably be easiest. Not sure what a warlock would do. Voidwalker tank?
---
How sad, my hunt for the 2 alliance on Flamelash just got harder...

I'm of the opinion that the addon is just there to make existing functionality more accessible. You could already make your combat log show enemy players as they enter detection range, and the addon made it much easier to use. If they were to nerf anything, it would be the combat log itself. That they did, and for that I'm glad.
---
It seems they also removed existing buffs from combat log when players enter logging range, making it unable to pick up players just passing by. At this point it seems completely reasonable.
---
If I could transfer my Warrior from a PVE server to a PVP server I would. PVE servers are so boring at level 60 once you've cleared the raids.
---
Was happy to, there are ton of tutorials online how exactly do the farm runs, it'll take you couple of runs to remember everything like the 2 book spawns and you're good to live there :-D
---
Look, theres a level 60 running through a massiv zone killing multiple people who might call upon mains/mates to help them out, and then theres landing in a zone getting killed by 60 level 60s that even with your whole guild helping you out would rape you.
---
Just hit 60. 2 things I want to do, pvp and get my epic mount. Anyone have a good list of good pvp gear and how to earn gold fast?
---
Fuck you.
---
They also let Gnomes, Humans, and Night Elves in. Disgusting.
---
NA LuL, pretty sure even if it was and I confirmed it this thread would get locked for witch-hunting.

how did you get a screenshot of my character?

You clearly have no idea what you’re talking about, or an idiot, if you think PvP server in 2004-06 are comparable to Classic Server now.

Gorgonzola, a blade of lettuce, some mayo, sliced turkey or chicken(seasoned), a bit of mustard, a slight drizzle of honey, and maybe some cucumber. It’s refreshing, fills you up, and most of all - yeah

Its gonna be dumb funny when all those people who decided to "roll warrior and MT everything" realize how hard it is to actually tank, get shredded on (like how they shredded on the tanks before) , and then recreate ANOTHER alt to 60 because they realized they fcked up.

You can definitely trade it to other players, so I don't see what would stop you from doing that.

I disagree entirely, cold blood prep is easily the best PvP build currently. Your burst potential is insane and you have twice the amount of CDs which especially with the honor trinket out, is absolutely necessary for some classes. I have killed most players at level 60 with cold blood prep the only classes I ever have trouble with is druids/mages. I haven’t lost to a sword rogue yet.

Parses are different than damage meters.

It helps if one has enchanting too.
---
First of all, congratulations! Not an easy task to get there to begin with :)
---
The PvP BiS list is still being worked on, but you want pieces that combine high stamina / armor / intellect / spell power / spell crit and hit. So, avoid those "of nature's wrath" greens that are PvE-recommended and cloth / leather gear when possible. The PvP sets (blue and epic) are great options, but you likely want to go with the best mail caster gear you can find before you can rank high enough to buy those.
---
For gold, there are multiple options as pointed out in [Icy Veins' Goldmaking page](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/classic-shaman-goldmaking-guide-the-best-ways-to-make-gold), but the best ones right now are not listed yet (will be in the near future):
---
1) [Maraudon Ghost Mushroom / Blindweed farming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot4UDJMDUYo) (almost no combat required, just running and high'ish Herbalism) with possibly some Mithril farming too if you are a miner. This is a **solo** farm. You can also solo the bosses (harder than with other classes, but possible) for their loot.
---
2) [Dire Maul East 2 man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOcBg-thIx8) (or more, but it dilutes profits) jump runs. The idea is to quickly get to the last boss and kill him, grabbing boss loot / librams / herb spawns / the guaranteed rich thorium vein spawns in the cave after taking him down. If you and your partner are competent and decently geared this is a huge money maker!
---
Have fun at 60! :3
---
Rank 3 gets you a further 10% discount that stacks with the 10% from Honored.
---
It will be fun again when BG's come out, and most of the people 24/7 farming honor will be doing those instead of roaming in packs of 10 in the open world

A range-talented fireball or aimed shot is 41 yards and leeway gives it another few yards on top of that

Someone knows if there is a graphic showing the dmg progression of spell power points per spell rank?

Cause I just learned about downranking and how this is important for elemental shamans.
---
Some guides shows how a elemental shaman can be a good contender in raids, without become OOM and still delivery a impressive amount of dmg
---
But I'm still incredulous about it, anyone can give me a light?

me, i'd rather it didn't exist but I'm also not clamouring for its removal.

The BiS items are just for the chase. If you don't enjoy the chase anymore, don't do it. Second or third on the list is absolutely fine as well for any practical situation.

Vanilla combat log was only 50 yards. The combat log distance was made longer in patch 2.4

The only people who should be dpsing in phase 1 are people who can be tanking her in phase 3.
---
Jump runs are DM:E farms right? I know the trash farm is good but are there any extra things unless you are a miner?
---
Ya that sounds great!

I'm curious, will that have an effect on various mods that are able to track when an Dragonslayer/Warchief's Blessing is about to go off? Or is that an entirely different dependency?

Thanks for all the answers guys! I'll do the quest then. The chest seem really nice for pvp and bg's are coming soon :). Also it might do just fine until i get SGC - in the end its not going anywhere and ill have plenty of time to farm that thing  
---
As for the bloods from what i read some people advertised in global chat that they will pay 1-5g for info about blood location. So i might do that if it prooves to be hard to find them. As for the stuff from Strat i have to farm the cape from baron anyway  
---
Again thanks evryone :)

Raid leader is a paladin....

Yep still remember watching Huhuran die to a frost bolt from the last mage standing back in vanilla. It was our second or third kill after months of being stuck on her so it was an amazing feeling :)

Can't say or this thread will get locked for witch-hunting.
---
It‘s rly a pvp spec and needs good gear - strong one-shot threat for anything below 4k hp, great versatility and tactical options for skirmishes and coordinated play. Engineering to add hard cc to your kit helps a lot. The spec is also pretty good for deathball vs deathball fights in hillsbrad.
---
You mostly choose elemental shaman when you‘re so stacked in raid gear from healing that you can also afford to blow up some fools - tier 1 gives lots of spell crit and tier 2 also reasonably pushes spell dmg up.
---
A warrior will be viable no matter the race but if you want to min/max specifically for duel wield DPS do your thorough research on endgame numbers for racials and item combos/weapon types... but my recommendation is picking the race you’ll enjoy looking at for hours and hours! Plus each race has their own mount type so that may be something you want to consider
---
Definitely. 
---
TSM usually reported 23-28k auctions, when I scanned as late as a few days before honor system. Since honor system there are only 12-14k auctions on the server.
---
My guild also lost quite a bit. Last week, we had 44 people signed up for the raid, this week we raided with 33.
---
No more accurate damage meters!
---
I wonder if they’ll charge for BC. Imagine making people who’ve already paid for BC pay for it again.
---
Shrouded will 100% go to the rogues.
---
It's 22AP more than for a warrior.
---
Can't really say, no hunter player. Sorry.
---
We're not talking about the graphical setting of view distance that makes things fog out further away - we're talking about the player and mob render distance.
---
It's definitely lower on classic than it was on vanilla.  And yes this is a bad change, I would hope we could at least get a response from blizz on why (perhaps there are technical reasons on the new servers...)?
---
But probably they'll just ignore it unless people keep the pressure up.
---
Nah WoS are better than the WSG bracers and legs will be added to the game in 1-2 years..
---
You can't. As the best geared fury warrior in my guild, I have to wait 1-2 seconds after every ability I use, and that is after waiting with dps until 5 sunders, and even then only auto attacks until after the first Wrath AoE. Sometimes windfury and crits just explode and I die if I don't.
---
I have actually made it my own personal experience, every time the melee leader tells us "go all in!" At the end, I try to time it how long I can survive before dying. Usually I insta aggro after Recklessness and one 100 rage execute crit, so about 2 seconds on average.
---
This dude must be talking about ranged only.
---
What are you talking about. Massive benefit for a class that should be undetectable in the first place? Just because you have a personal vendetta against rogue's doesnt mean this is a BENEFIT. This is how it should be to begin with you downy. And this is actually a huge drawback for rogue's. Now it will be even easier to pull them out of stealth cause its a smaller vacinity to aoe down. idiot
---
The technical problem is that the queueing code sits before connecting to the server that stores your character. So at the point of logging in, the system doesn't know whether or not you're on the smaller faction. It has always worked like that since vanilla launch. 
---
This would require rewriting the queueing code to happen \*after\* character selection but before loading into the world. That maybe sounds easy, but is probably a nightmare to do.
---
right on! that worked great, thank you very much!

I lack a mouse for which I can binds lots of abilities. Current mouse have only Left, right and middle click button.
---
My totem binds are therefore kinda odd but it works logically well in my head. I group my standard buff-totems on my num pad like this:
---
Num1: Stoneskin  
---
Num2: Healing Stream  
---
Num3: Grace of Air
---
Num4: Strength of Earth  
---
Num5: Mana Spring  
---
Num6: Windfury
---
Num7: Frost Resist  
---
Num8: Fire Resist  
---
Num 9: Nature Resist
---
This is logical to me because:
---
* First column (7,4,1) is always earth totems. Apart from frost resist because earth totems doens't have a resist totem.
---
* Second column (8,5,2) is always water totem
---
* Third column (9,6,3) is always air totem
---
* First row (7,8,9) is all resist totems
---
* Second row  (4,5,6) is typical raid totems
---
* Third row (1,2,3) is nice for smaller group content. Mostly for dungeons, but can me mixed with the 2nd row.
---
* All these totems are plain buffs and are mostly not needed to activate in "emergencies" (unlike grounding, tremor, earthbind..) which gives me the freedom to move my right hand from my mouse to the num pad without any major consequences.
---
* Other totems, like fire, all have other keybinds that are more fitting for fast reactions. The only totem I'm struggling to find a place for is Tranquil Air (and Windwall but who cares really).
---
This works for me and now I'm very used to use the numpad and 'configurating' my fingers for my groups specific needs - just like your left hand fingers when playing a guitar.
---
i don't want to see this post, but it keeps showing. reddit seems to be manipulating the feed.
---
I use my combat log not the spy add on thing. I don't know how many people but you know when a lot of ally names pop up it's time to run or when just one does he's nearby
---
Hunters also have a spell called track humans.....
---
is it really that much better tho? I assume you mean the leather chest with 60 AP  
---
ill have to farm SCG anyway so might just do that and meanwhile use the chromatic. As others said it can be used in pvp or tanking so its a bit better in than manner than the leather one

At least you didnt hit rank 14 then realize it

On balanced servers fp pvp is actually pretty fun.

Red Dead released 3 weeks ago :P
---
Thing is it appears to be worse on classic than it ever was on vanilla.  I don't know if that's because we now all have super low pings so 400 ms batch windows are more noticeable or something.  I almost never had the bug where you lay on hands a player as they're about to die and it goes off, u see the spell effect, u get the cooldown but they still die at the same instant.
---
I did have that issue on vanilla but perhaps like 10 times ever over years of playing.  I've had it like 50% of the time I've casted LoH in pvp on classic.

I've been struggling to find a good way to identify my, or anyone elses GUID. Can you help with this?
---
Guys, any advise on questing in dangerous area with high mob density, such as caves, strongholds or some ruins? I have to constantly deal with 2-3 mobs a time, and some patrolling mob or stealthed mob may join in any time, even when you're eating/drinking.
---
The fact that people use it just shows you why we ended up with systems like LFR and Group Finder. People don't want to play the game the way it's meant to be played, they just want it as easy as possible. 
---
Then again, I guess it's not fair if someone sneaks up on you using terrain to their advantage when you're reading discord or twitch chat, gotta level the playing field with your look out alarm!
---
Automatic downvote because you are playing a rogue.
---
my estimation is that hordes will get to play 1 bg for every two bgs an ally player does. So count on it being 20min ish.
---
Dont roll pvp
---
Just excisting, apperently.
---
Same situation here. Just living vicariously through everyone here.
---
They nerfed drop rates and xp rates of lasher, not viable in classic
---
A Limited Invulnerability Potion has saved my life several times if I get aggro when she lands (as a Warlock).
---
Literal racism ^/s
---
this dude used tea on an honorless target lmao what a clown
---
The cape and shoulders should be pretty easy and cost you only 2x respecs. Go prot, make your own group and reserve both items. Then you just tank until you get them.  
---
The other two are really hard to get just because of the low drop rate or spawn rate in teh case of SGC.
---
The claw is very good if you arnt human.
---
You gain 20 energy every 2 seconds. So if you are about to receive a tick of energy and are at 80+ energy you aren't regenning as much energy as you could.
---
So you always want to have &lt;80 energy when the refresh tick comes around. If not you're aren't spending the maximum total energy you could be, and energy spent generally converts to more damage.
---
There are UI addons which will show you when the next energy tick is coming so you can plan your ability use appropriately.
---
perception sucks, it's only good for planned duels
---
use vanish and it won't work
---
On the flip side many people that aren't finished levelling just are not playing so while the ones that want to level in dungeons has increased its probably offset a fair bit by that.
---
Am i going to need to name change? Hunter despawned WS demon on my so we did it to him and then an hour or so of us wpvping and generally winning ensued. Then everyone left and i ended up getting camped for over an hour to the point that the horde made a level one alt to trash talk me.
---
 Kicker is i was just getting a Hunter do the demon as I'm still waiting on my leaf (I've done it multiple times before).
---
 I get the sinking feeling that I'm going to be camped to hell and back and will never be able to complete the demons without a name change in a week or two.
---
That's the way i like it.  Stealth class pussy

Kargoz mage leveling guide on youtube is pritty good. Thats not really a beginners guide but more a optimalisation guide.

Yes they do take action against ninjas. Always open a ticket with sufficient proof and they will get their items taken away.
---
&gt; Some NPCs are specifically coded to render as far as possible for client settings, like the Fel Reaver from BC.
---
I call BS in that. That giant bastard would appear out of nowhere right in top of me all the time! I swear he was half rogue.
---
i don't use it and I hate it.
---
Do I have to get it since the enemy uses it and gains advantage?
---
How do you find out your guid?
---
no but luckily i picked a server that seems to be nearly balanced (horde prolly has slightly more but I reckon like 45/55).
---
Although a lot of people seem to be leveling lower level alts (&lt;40) at the moment and raid logging their mains.
---
That's certainly true, but the at least they provide arguments and usually loose their cool against said dick head.
---
For me it's not about white knighting I just want to have a discussion on the matter and 90% of the responses are : "stop whine", "go back to retail", "gît gud" which is tiring.
---
This is spot on. Thanks for writing it out, saves me the trouble.
---
One last tidbit, is that we've advised melee to "pool" resources right as Wrath is cast and just auto-attack until they see the taunt hit (in case of a taunt resist, which has killed melee in the past with us).
---
Also, for melee dps specifically, if the players being hit with Wrath are fury warriors, great, they can intercept back in, and require no fire resist (Wrath does around 1000-1200 fire damage, and a greater fire pot or two can provide enough protection to get Rag down). If the player is a rogue, then unfortunately they will either have to step outside of melee range during Wrath, or stack fire resist and hope for RNG, as if the healers don't heal quickly enough, falling damage can kill the rogue.
---
Also, be sure not to have any paladins/shamans in melee, or they'll get hit by the aoe fire blast/knockback and kill the rest of the melee. Also, druids in cat form are fine, but they should NOT powershift, shift out to innervate, anything like that. Its not confirmed, but it seems as soon as Ragnaros "sees" their mana bar, they are a potential target for the aoe knockback for the rest of the encounter, but if they stay as cat the whole time, they're fine.
---
I have little sympathy for people who roll on a pvp server despite all the warnings about phase 2, and then complain about it when phase 2 comes.
---
It venders for about 70s.
---
This dude sounds like Korg from Thor Ragnarok.
---
It helps identify whether the solo player I want to kill is actually solo or does he have 20 people following, but I could live without it.
---
I can spot rogues in stealth with fel doggo+goggles anyway.
---
This makes me happy as I love fishing. Will definetly look into this, thanks a lot!
---
It’s too fast for fury warriors and you can’t get fist weapon skill so it’s not the bis tanking weapon either. Cool weapon thou
---
Welcome to the wonderful world of tanking with shithead DPS competing for aggro on every mob &lt;3
---
Been using the same strat since the stack for fireball bug was nerfed.  Works great.  One, maybe two ranged with no agro dump abilities get oneshot by ony then its back on the tank.  (Our dps has become fast/geared enough some lower dps and thus lower threat mages dont get a fireball to reduce their threat more than once or at all so Ony eats them real quick, its amusing)
---
You find out how to screen cap without the hud?
---
100% depends on your class, level, and gear.
---
Damn dude. I've noticed that some people are just luck gods, and others have trouble with 50% drop rate drops lol. I, unfortunately, happen to be in the latter.
---
Fortunately, gold is farmable regardless of what drops, so people like you can keep making money off poor sobs like me, and in the end we'll both get what we need.
---
No you want stats for pvp not spellhit, spellhit does nothing if you get 1shot
---
lmao
---
Just trying to be helpful
---
I'd say its more of a ffwhooooo sound than a wooosh.
---
Depends on class but if you’re going into a dangerous place being consumables. Potions, bandaids, buffs. 
---
As for killing mobs, work your way in, range pull of you need to. If you’re killing too slow to stay ahead of the respawn you may need to return when you are more powerful
---
Yeah, if it does away with that sound then rogues just got a huge buff for pvp.
---
Lol that’s what you get for asking these chucklefucks to balance the factions on PvP servers. They simple don’t give a damn.
---
Just come clean that you don’t give a fuck and open up the transfers for good. Why imprison people in one faction concentration canps
---
Agreed, though Cape of the Black Baron is still better for rogues. My raids loot council decided to award it to a hunter last time, as they're technically the only class that gains anything from it over the Black Baron Cape. Regardless, yes, rogues should have priority.
---
Your OT should race past you with 41% sunders and recklessness popped at P3
---
Can't they achieve the same thing but sheeping or sapping the target til the buff wears off? 
---
I've seen numerous players camping flight points from both factions, and they are utilizing some cc in 1 way or another to circumvent the honorless kill buff.
---
Found the noob.
---
On a game like WoW Classic where reputation means a lot, you really have to pick your shots when getting revenge. The SPriest should have definitely expressed his concerns about the loot but in a calm way. If the leader says 'tough shit',  the SPriest turns into shadow form IRL, but keeps it on the down low. A few weeks or months later there will be a time that the leader is in a vulnerable position, and where there is chaos, there's opportunity. Eventually a few other gu8ld members will get pissed off with him but hopefully keep it on the DL like the SPriest does, and one day they will just plan to overthrow the guild leader and take the guild as their own. Gotta pick your shots, people.
---
how hard is it for a paladin to bubble and distribute loot ?
---
This is not true
---
We had this issue before us tanks specced fury/prot. Works like a charm now!
---
do yourself a favor and don't min/max classic. Play what class and race combination you want
---
Eredar lord of the trifling gnome!
---
Warrior, warlock and mage. Mage slow the adds, and ae while warlock hellfire them. For bosses the warlock takes aggro and sacrifice voidwalker for shield.
---
Its super easy.
---
&gt;My guess is late January or early February.
---
Oh please don't. Let it be may or something. There's just no way to keep up.
---
Hunters can do it anyways as of class design (track). The fact that all the other classes can as well is in fact hurting hunter abilities. Imagine having an addon that would allow any class to vanish. Yup.
---
If you are a human or orc, it is not worth using over a sword/mace/axe. If you are not a human or orc, but have Edgemaster's, then it is still not worth using over a sword/axe/dagger. Weapon skill is just that good. Getting to 305-308 (higher than 308 is almost useless) is the single greatest way to increase your threat.
---
If you are not a human or orc, and do not have Edgemaster's, then get Edgemaster's. Its the single greatest boost to your threat that you can get. Another somewhat viable option is Aged Core Leather Gloves (or Mugger's Belt in a pinch) and use a dagger, though wearing leather while tanking is not ideal.
---
If you are not a human or orc, are too poor to purchase Edgemaster's, are unable to farm gold in any way, and cannot get a dagger, then yes, Eskhander's Right Claw is fairly decent. It has a proc rate of 1 ppm, so an average uptime of 8.33%. I've also heard rumors that the haste buff doesn't stack with Flurry, but I do not have any evidence or experience to make a firm conclusion on that.
---
Idk where this 200y bullshit started. It's not 200y, unless render distance is 200y, but it seems to be more like 100y to me on my tests. Maybe 150y at most.
---
Spy does not detect people beyond your render range. That would be completely stupid. And the game does not tell you what stuff that hasn't rendered is doing, that's the whole point of having a render range.
---
Just making a joke here.
---
How would they even know it’s actually a blizzard gm? He is either full of it el natural or being fed shit
---
Kill it and I'd stop using it with no complaints.
---
Absolutely not. I don't do pay to win.
---
Usually the MT gets threat reduced by the fireball in P2, while the OT doesnt (if OT is positioned right on the meter). This makes it easier for the OT to climb to the top quickly, but if you manage it then that works just as well!
---
is this a joke?
---
Pretty much any other weapon + weapon skill would be a better combination.  If you don't have weapon skill for some reason then its okay.  I have used it just fine as deep prot but currently trying to get a replacement to use with edgemasters/mugger's belt for when I go fury prot.
---
So basically main issue is there is no way to deal with glancing blows because there is no way to get unarmed weapon skill.
---
I don't like Spy or DBM for that matter. But how can you act like Spy adds information that is not already available to you in game?
---
Do weapon poison buffs show up in Spy? Been wondering.
---
OK, say, 40ish warrior with whirlwind axe at Kurzen compound or one of the troll ruins doing quest? There're a lot of caster mobs that can't be pulled and hard to LOSed. They don't hit as hard as the deadly defias pillager, but some can heal, which is pretty annoying. There're quest objects that I have to clear every mob in my way to reach.
---
Its not a great weapon, even for twinks as its. basically 3-4g at a max.
---
It is not impossible. It is super easy in fact. You could just not show enemy player auras and abilities on the CL that do no affect you.
---
Bam Spy doesnt work and half the other cheatmode addons for PvP dont either.
---
I just hit 60 on my warlock earlier this week and want to grind mobs for Felcloth and extra gold. I switched from a dark pact/drain tank build to SM/ruin for dungeons and noticed I have to stop and drink/eat a lot more when grinding mobs. How gimped would I be in 5-mans if I were to do a sustainable focused build like [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/25022535122010051-202-50500001)  as opposed to SM/Ruin or DS/Ruin?
---
The world bosses have been amazingly smooth even with multiple raids of people.
---
I even have a poo computer and the best my game runs is world bosses, despite their being 4 or more raids worth of people.
---
I have a macro that has change then rage then to zerker stance and ww. That normally gets a good jump on the aggro issue.
---
God damn clown
---
I love making macros for people so it doesn't bother me. I _think_ this will do everything you asked before in addition to if you have an enemy targeted, it will cast Flash Heal when you hold shift.
---

Those are the 2 big ones. Knowing exactly when enemy Cooldowns/trinkets come off cooldown is huge.

They changed what? You could mail multiple items in vanilla.

According to reddiquette:

&gt;In regard to comments
---
&gt;Make comments that lack content. Phrases such as "this", "lol", and "I came here to say this" are not witty, original, or funny, and do not add anything to the discussion.
---
You coumd prevent the combat log to show it in the first place.
---
how brave
---
Prat, omniCC, dominoes, tinytip, dbm, there are more.
---
who would dare to be pve specd in skeram alliance lol
---
Log on one day really early/late and you should be fine.  Nobody is going to camp that especially after BGs release.  Right now people might just kill you because you are worth honor especially if the other faction is predominant.
---
Use it if it’s an upgrade. It won’t be worth much on the ah.
---
He's agreeing with the point you think you're making and is saying he's laughing at people who thinks it's against #nochanges, when it's in fact, #nochanges.
---
But go off lmao
---
Or you could just level with friends or form party with randoms on leveling.
---
I fell asleep doing my first MC raid and I woke up logged in to see myself at the entrance. Does that mean I can't do it again until next week?
---
Once again the whining and petulant children prove that Blizzard will only listen to the loudest triggered screeches rather than evaluate what's right.
---
Just tested with the addon, it still detects players farther that 50yards, probably close to 70-80 yards.
---
Seems like ClassicLFG all over again; it's just PR talk.
---
Yeah, I honestly just didn't care enough to farm the SGC, but as dps get geared up, threat is starting to become a bit more of an issue, and will become even more of an issue in BWL with fights like Vael and Broodlord, so I've taken a renewed interest in farming it.
---
Yeah, I'd love to do 4 groups of 20, but our 2 raid groups of 40, is more like 2 raid groups of 35-40, depending on if everyone shows up or not.
---
Also our last Ony kill was the first time she used a deep breath since we starting farming her over a month ago, and it made it painfully obvious who knew what they were doing and who were just blasting her without a care in the world, because deep breath is stupid easy to avoid if you're aware of her positioning, and we still lost half the raid. A real eye opener, and useful to know so I can work on people, but makes me worried to split the raids any further.
---
Yeah I'm also wondering about this. Yesterday I fought a warrior in DM and one other warrior literally charged from the unseen. Like he appeared on my screen mid charge.
---
Yeah, and i mean, im not gonna whine about it, but also, no one is gonna force me to play if im not having a good time at the moment.
---
as a hunter, do i teach my wind serpent bite along with lightning breath? or only teach it lightning breath to use the focus for that
---
K ban dbm, details, recount, any scrolling combat text, or anything else that reads your combat log.
---
wow ncie written guide!
---
gonna check out your method sometime
---
Still haven't installed it, Tbh only add-ons i am using are Weakauras for their Debuff on Nameplates. And ofc Questie.
---
In a way that clearly wasnt intended, see this nerf.
---
The server I'm on is pretty equal, but has an alliance advantage.
---
Zandalar Tribe EU is about 53% Alliance, 47% Horde. 
---
Alliance are dickbags too.
---
Sounds like you should play retail.
---
Is it already possible to do the BWL attunement?
---
Spy was nerfed
---
Everytime im logging into classic and want to Start lvling, im just going offline cause i die Everytime (lvl10 Warrior) . Guess i will never reach lvl 60, cause im to bored and have no more desire. Gratz on hitting 60 :)
---
If your phase 2's are lasting long enough that the majority of your casters are getting their threat wiped, then strategy isn't the only place you are failing.
---
Spy is a fine addon. The underlying reason they hate is is because it was alerting to players they think they shouldn’t see, but in reality the combat log just matches what the render distance was back in Vanilla.
---
Then. 18years old, a student. 
---
Now: 33Years old, an engineer.
---
If you kill them quickly enough you can still use the portal so the kill is basically a free bonus with the teleport.
---
What he posted isn't relevant at all. Nobody claimed that this was the world first reincarnation bait.
---
Oooh ambush/eviscerate
---
Yeah, the Tiny threat meter in Details for example only functions properly if the other people use Details, else last I looked it either doesn't function or gives you wildly inaccurate results.
---
Appalling? Really?
---
Shitty addon that shouldn't exist in the first place is way more "appauling".  Sorry, you're just gonna have to look at the damage number when the spell lands.  I'm sure you will live.
---
apes are getting wiped left and right on their server. they are not getting world bosses either.
---
the myth that apes is some godlike guild who runs around the battlefield crushing one raid after another is just not true.
---
lmaoo, cant argue with that
---
I'm usually "top" on threat meters but I get fireballed at least once while she's in the air which drops threat enough that I won't pull aggro on land.
---
Yeah, I distinctly remember there being guild addon packs, where you had to install a preset list of addons used by that guild in order to ensure that they actually worked properly.
---
if you get standing one two weeks in a row you will get a total of 26000 rankin points -2600decay. = 23400rp.
---
This puts you 68% in on rank 6.
---
you've posted 47 reddit commends in a time period of two hours
---
tell me about this job you have, i'm clearly in the wrong industry
---
That's cause it was. Spy can't pick up anything that hasn't rendered.
---
There was spell batching in Vanilla. The problem is 100% on the implementation provided from the Blizzard engineers which attempted to replicate it. 
---
Don’t blame the community for wanting this part to feel authentic.
---
Jump Runs?
---
Ooo someone sounds insecure
---
Real tank weapons are daggers :)
---
Well you can’t expect a small indie company to compete with a private server
---
They could just store your faction since you cannot have both on a pvp server, no?
---
I agree that if you can then choose any faction like on pve it makes the implementation a lot harder but my suggestion is mainly to improve the state of pvp servers.
---
Damn. I like it. Especially since the warlocks in my guild are pretty good players.
---
My problem is that my raid group has 7 mages and 5 warlocks. And I, personally, have helped 5 of the mages and 3 of the warlocks get their Ban'thok sash, as well as getting 5 of our 8 healers their Second Wind trinket, and 2 of our 3 rogues their Hand of Justice.
---
In that amount of time (took around 60-70 runs), I have seen Gorosh the Dervish 3 times. Yes. 3 times. So the fact that the SGC hasn't dropped isn't surprising (only 7.5% chance), but for a fight that is theoretically 1 in 6, I've encountered him far fewer times.
---
I'm running out of casters in our guild to run with me, since I've geared most of them out already. Maybe I should be more of a dick about getting them to commit to helping me, but that's never been my style.
---
Waaaaaah you can't nerf Spy
---
Waaaaaah it's just like looking at combat log
---
Waaaaaah it will break other addons
---
then: 10 year old who wasn't allowed to play
---
now: 25 year old who is allowed to play
---
So you're saying there's a chance.
---
Shaman raiding as ele here. Downranking really isnt necessary. Im in full preraid bis + T2 helm and choker of enlightenment, get by just fine by making sure that on boss fights i eat mp5 food and time my runes &amp; mana pots properly (ie. popping a rune as soon as i spend 1500mana). Pull anywhere between #5-#10 dps on boss fights depending on rng with crits
---
Sorry to hijack the thread but I could use some advice too. I am a human fury warrior and got this item last night. Been tanking with Mirahs because of weapon skill in raids and 5 mans and works out fine.
---
Is it worth it using eskhander for lvl 60 mobs( glancing blow damage) and 5 mans and keeping mirahs to offtank in MC?
---
Frost = Slow. Ice  = Freeze. It Works on Ice.
---
Yup, by that time you will be so far ahead you can just coast by and still go up cause only a few are in the high ranks and all get + standing instead of -
---
Warrior hit question:
---
Based on this https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/fury-warrior-dps-stat-priority-classic-wow if you have +5 weapon skill then the +hit cap for boss mobs drops from 9% to 6% hit.
---
Now my question is what if a Human gets [Obsidian Edged Blade](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18822/obsidian-edged-blade) , how does that affect their hit cap?
---
As has cancer.
---
So, you know. It being around doesn't necessarily mean it should be around.
---
corpse runs
---
Nice, you found a guild! Gratz! 😁
---
Dun dun dunnn you're going to jail because you decided you didn't want to sell your watch!!
---
Uhhh ... Every add-on is a QoL thing though, what the hell do you think QoL is? Even Spy is just a QoL add-on that makes it so you don't have to be staring at your combat log 24/7.
---
Frost 100%
---
The other just got nerfed by blizzard, ya cunt :D
---
Well the advantage of splitting them means you can still provide information.. just not all of it. You could give full logs for anybody you're in combat with for example, or only allow certain auras to be seen, or disable stealth events. 
---
How they go about balancing it is really up to them, but my point is that there are a lot of ways that things could be changed to address the issues without losing function.
---
Human NPCs have permanent [Perception](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20600/perception) activated. /s
---
Every Hunter that found you wasn't using Spy to find you.
---
How do you make flairs?
---
You can't not have it since everyone has it. Oh well
---
&gt;Yes, and you also had the entire raid rotation for hunters on macro throughout the entirety of TBC.
---
wasnt that literally just /cast !autoshot /cast arcane shot?
---
or something similar?
---
you are comparing broken class design to macros that automate your class on 5 different levels.
---
here is what vanilla macros could do:
---
prioritize different abilities based on debuffs beeing applied to the target.
---
(check for curses applied to target and cast one that isnt on there, if there is a curse but not corruption- cast corruption, if you have a nightfall proc- stopcast and cast maxrank shadowbolt, and on and on and on)
---
its completely different
---
And thus, Kanye's child was named
---
What is the proc rate for the warrior t0 set bonus at 6 parts that heals you?
---
As a warrior who remembers doing Kurzen compound...you're gonna need a group!
---
"why do people need cars!? I walked up hill both ways for 40 miles in a snowstorm during a tornado in the middle of a heatwave every day!" 
---
This is what your post reads like lmao
---
Rude. It's called elephantiasis and it's a serious disease. Why do you think he's surrounded by so many healers?
---
I don't main a mage, so take this with a grain of salt, but based on what I do know of mages, Frost offers control and survivability, which greatly helps with leveling through being able to aoe down large packs, either on your own or in dungeons, while fire offers significantly higher single-target dps, where you kill something before it kills you, though later on it gets some control with Blast Wave.
---
Arcane... gets a few nice abilities and utility talents, but very little that will help you level. Honestly, the best talent for leveling is probably Wand Specialization, as it allows you to wand things to death faster and conserve mana. But I'd stick to either frost or fire, preferably frost, for leveling. Is arcane viable? Of course it is. If a warrior can level on his own as prot, then ANYTHING is viable. But is it good? No, not in the slightest.
---
I haven't seen a noticible decline on Gandling EU yet, but I also havent played in 2 days since I'm waiting for the wpvp to die down so I expect people are doing the same as me.

I feel you, I stopped playing.. I don't want too but its not worth the frustration.. sadly I'm 57 and don't believe if i were 60 it would be any different.   I'm considering Rolling pve, but I'm having a hard time swallowing that time sink pill.. and kinda feel it's too late to start again bc of the amount of stuff on farm
---
It already broke details in raid settings, combat log does still seem to work properly and picks up everything.   I haven't read what the hotfix was but best guess is it  restricts add-ons from reading the combat log for anything outside 50yrds.
---
If that's the case, it wouldn't be too difficult to get the rest of the guild sans management to gquit and form their own. Heavy handed and despised leadership is an easy way to form a mutiny against the guild, and take most of their core raiders. It's not like there's much of a barrier to entry to starting a new guild, just 1g for the roster.
---
Awesome apology but it's not real, doesn't rly matter tho
---
They really need to quantify that it absolutely does if your class can potentially be doing something outside of a 50 yard range, which is absolutely possible.
---
I will raise my hand. That said I doubt it is going away any time soon.
---
Yeah, that’s not true. It’s not even possible given the pop balance
---
We just have 1 person calling the safespots out, pretty simple :) good luck!
---
Very good advice, and what we've been doing ever since they fixed her bug. The only thing I'd adjust is that in phase 1, the dps only white hit/wand not because of threat, but to conserve mana, because there's no reason to rush through phase 1, as its so easy. This allows them to save mana for the phase 2 burn, and then for phase 3 to finish her off.
---
I'm looking for the same, but for healing. Currently a 56 boomkin, but willing to respec full resto until 60 if needed to grind dungeons. Just don't want to feel like an idiot replying to an LFM
---
no, it's just butthurt people who disagree with me, oh and your analogy is totally shit
---
It doesn't. You need 315 weapon skill to have 5% cap, at 313 you'd still need 5.2%, though one could argue that the last percent is much less valuable.
---
However, it still reduces glancing blow penalty, which is nice.

---
I was gonna say this too
---
It would also be pretty easy money for blizzard once everything is set up, so I imagine that they will do this.
---
That was the question ;) thanks!
---
Theyre not getting threat wiped, but the highest (and hardest for the OT to beat) is getting wiped.
---
Took the words right outta my mouth
---
*You know what they say about people with big feet?*
---
It wasn't a dig at you or your advice. He was mocking how some dps won't let the tank get threat, regardless of how often they die or how often you tell them to chill out :P
---
I was about to say the same thing
---
So run dungeons...
---
What is spell batching mate?
---
Nah, spy uses information the game allows it to use, like all addons. The game doesn't tell you when someone changes zone or whatever. It doesn't tell you when someone changes targets either. This is not information that's available to the player. It basically only uses the combat log, mousing over, map tracking and targeting, and of course it shares data between party members.
---
Is it confirmed Blizz nerfed the lashers in DME? Are jump runs/farming there even worth it now?
---
We have been doing splits since week 2, then started doing this strategy by week 4 ish.

---

---
Yup, bears are amazing!
---
This is the classic experience I remember! I remember being level 12 and a raid came through Auberdine and I was so excited to be a part of that but my fps dropped to like 0.2 so I just saw a slideshow of me running in the inn, running off the dock, the horde sailing to Darnassus, and then my friends going "Holy shit that was awesome! Where were you? Did you see that?"
---
Oh, so Spy now will stop to ping about people with buffs flying above you on fly paths.  
---
Nice!
---
So, if mana isn't an issue at all, then yeah, dps can do whatever they want in phase 1. And it can be helpful, as you want the tank thats going to pick up in phase 3 to be in the middle of the threat meter, as if he's too high, he'll get a fireball and have his threat reset. But if dps are running dry before Ony dies, then they need to chill in phase 1.
---
Only butthurt sounding person here is you lmao. Also that's not an analogy, it's a jab at how ridiculous your post sounds.
---
Details is in fact broken, it communicates estimated threat but not actual damage.  Different people in our mc raid had different results depending on positioning.  The combat log did still record everything, I think the client was changed to not display it outside of range, when the log was parsed it still had everyone in it though.
---
Serpent sting kind of sucks regardless. Lots of mana for very little damage
---
Find a server that isn’t dominated by the opposite faction. Or you won’t be able to level. Camping the flight path and making sure everyone wants to quit playing is all the rage right now
---
I am part of this.
---
Still leveling so mostly used it to avoid getting caught then other way around.
---
Haha loved the class explanation. 10/10
---
Is there any addon around who let's you add comment for friendly players as well?
---
You sure showed him for trying to answer your vague question
---
How many of my fellow healers have an issue in raids where they get tunnel vision on raid bars and don't pay attention to what is actually going on? Looking for a way to combat this...

---
Having a roll system benefits pugs. Having a good and fair loot council is better for progression because they can make sure everyone gets gear that's optimal for their class/spec and will benefit the raid as a whole.
---
What's the website that showed active players currently online? Was a huge dip when honor released
---
&gt;'A' and 'D' quickly in between attacks and move side to side quickly.
---
This is called leeway mechanic. While you are moving, your pvp hit range rises because of bla bla. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3GH5cWPFOE
---
It also helps that this was in the middle of the night.
---
i mean, we have ONLY had like 200 million posts of this, so we obviously need more
---
Horde side on OB has at least a dozen MC raids going at this point. One guild (Titan Slayers)is building their fourth raid team, though I'm unclear how far along each one is. I know there is at least one later night MC pug, and I think a couple guilds run their MCs late. 
---
 Overall the population doesn't seem that high, but compared to old vanilla it's obviously much higher. There is a noticeable difference in population between alliance and horde, but it doesn't really matter. Like in the hillsbrad pvp brawl, we go back and forth all day, except when the alliance show up and trap us in TM with 3:1 forces.
---
Huh never knew that, thanks
---
Actually more then 40% of horde players. If you have 70/30 then 30 horde and 30 ally are in bgs and 40 horde aren't. But it's 40/70 since it's relative to the horde pop so that's 57%
---
It definitely helps.  The queues won't be bad.

Ah, thanks for confirming that.

If you ever played hunter you'll know tracking is pretty useless. Also I was talking about abusing broken spy mechanics whose range is far greater than tracking.

Stack stamina, could do it in pre-raid bis, but highly recommended to get a few Felheart piece from MC since they have tons of stam

This, as well as spell batching, and lack of key ring.  Blizzard please fix these issues.  Please.
---
I haven't run any raids yet. What are "white damage" and "yellow damage"
---
The people in this sub have serious issues.
---
I didn't ask anything, I explained that it was not "impossible" and that people should stop saying that it was. 
---
There is a difference between "cannot be done" and "won't be implemented because it would require too many resources". A very big difference.
---
VanasKOS does
---
What are you even talking about, addons existed back in vanilla as well. Can't fault people being better at creating addons nowdays compared to 15 years ago.
---
Different city/state*
---
Great strat! Thanks for sharing.
---
Except spy had way more range also making tracking useless.
---
It's very deep in settings.  
---
IIRC Skins-Frames-something-something-show directions
---
Never do that, you are allowed to be lucky.
---
Your removed comment was: "I think Final Boss is full of mentally and phisically disabled folks. Their actions and attitudes seem so at least :b". It had 2 up votes.
---
So the child here is most likely not that mod.
---
&gt;If you're just going to raid log and run MC once a week, what's the point? 
---
This is exactly why I cancelled though. Why pay $15/mo if I'm just raid logging?
---
I also suspect BG queues for horde will be very long so they'll still have to go gank for honor. Except then the alliance pvp players won't even be around to help you push back because they'll be getting instant queues in capital cities.
---
No it hasn't, it started in 2009.

my spy addon was better than my track humanoids now at least i have a reason to use my skills
---
Main mage here. Frost is the only viable spec until Naxx/TBC. There is an arcane build which has a slightly superior dps to the main frost builds but it has ZERO survival. So I recommend you to go frost all the way until Phase 4.
---
Tell them when you hover it says full amount too not each stack?
---
In all honesty though it just says the right amount at the bottom so I guess people just dumb.
---
Ok cool
---
Apparently there's a console command that lets you extend the logging range to something crazy like 200 yards that existed in vanilla.  This allowed Spy to extend ranges far beyond what is reasonable.  
---
First major point.  This doesn't break spy.  It just reduces the range.  Anyone thinking this is going to break the addon doesn't really understand the change, and is just knee jerk commenting without trying to understand what's happening.
---
2nd major point.  A commenter on the linked thread suggested that this change could actually improve spy's functionality by allowing us better information on the specific location of an enemy.  You'll now better know the area in which the specific player is located.  
---
3rd major point.  This same person suggested if Spy were able to communicate with players on the same team, the range could theoretically be extended, while also giving better information on location.  So with a little clever development and use, this change could actually improve spy.
---
Press O, switch to Raids tab, click Raid Info button.  
---
This will show if you saved into any raids.  
---
But in general you are saved the second when raid kill first boss, if you are inside the instance.
---
This arguement is dumb because the amount of people who used Paranoia compared to spy is minuscule.
---
The addon wasn't a problem because a lot of people simply did not use addons because they were a lot less accessible and often didnt get updated, required manually installing and updating etc.
---
Not really, because meter addons can just share the data. But I'm not sure exactly what's the cap on this. I would find it weird if the game allowed a player to receive something like 5 messages a second for each raid member (so like, 195 messages a second) which would be necessary to share combat logs in real time. That would be really bad for the servers, so there's probably a cap that will force addons to compress data and send it in batches, which might lower the rate at which your meters update, but it's definitely doable.
---
However, for addons that need to look at the entire combat log and can't just send compressed data (like "here's how much damage I did in the last 5 seconds"), for example details, ert or even warcraftlogs which want to get *all* the info to draw graphics and sheets that can help analyzing logs (stuff like who drank what potion when, which spells someone used to heal etc...), I'm not sure how they could do this.
---
But maybe the cap isn't that low and addons can still share all the data effortlessly ? One thing is sure, the changes required to share the data won't happen in one day, so we'll be fucked for some time.
---
5) Start your own group and don't invite any classes with a reason to roll on the items you want. Just bring casters.
---
White damage is auto attack such as wands or auto-attack melee. The damage numbers that pop up on the target are white. Yellow damage is your abilities and spells, and the numbers that pop up are yellow.
---
Correct, now you just need to use formations. All Blizzard did was implement the Scout Regiment formations from AoT.
---
Damn son
---
After leveling with a drain tank build I can safely say that dark pact is not worth it...at all. using a GCD to restore 200 mana is just as slow if not slower than just sitting down to drink. you're going to definitely want a SM ruin build but the points are relatively interchangeable. You can still get 5/5 fel conc and imp soul drain as SM ruin if you want it. The build you're suggesting is definitely not good for raid/dungeon content though.
---
Boy somebody should tell that rogue about retail wow. He would love it.
---
Would the best pre-rank gear just be the dungeon sets? They seem to combine all of the stats mentioned. I don't know much about Shamans so that set may be geared more towards Resto but I imagine it would be good for Ele as well. Enhance could probably wear Beaststalker.
---
That's not true though.  You could extend logging range to 200 yards in vanilla with a console command.  Most people didn't because their machines couldn't handle it.  Also, it wasn't necessary because we didn't have something like spy.  This is effectively a nerf of functionality that existed in vanilla.
---
no you can't.
---
Except now it can theoretically chain between members. All this did was make it worse for solo players and make it require the mist basic of coordination from groups trying to farm players.
---
Yeah I’ve noticed stealth players now only pop up if I have seen them while stealthed assuming I hadn’t previously which is definitely better.
---
Just look at this, https://youtu.be/DGDKrAgRyiY?t=684 clearly able to see all the way down into the valley including spells, abilities, etc
---
And they speak Orcish or Gutterspeak?
---
yeah, I'm locked, thanks for letting me know how to check
---
The default range was 50 yards.  It could be extended to 200 with a console command.  Ironically, the people below you commenting they don't actually don't know.
---
Nerfed compared to what? Yes they drop much less loot than they did on pservers, and it's hard to say how it is compared to vanilla because they were likely changed a few times back then.
---
Cleave is shit for threat, and costs way too much rage to be the base ability to hold aggro with.
---
&gt; (Blood Rage if not enough rage)
---
You almost always dont have enough rage, use it as soon as you get into defensive stance and starting to build threat.
---
Its much more effective to tab target and apply sunder than "spamming cleave" which you dont have aggro for.
---
 Save your Revenge proc and think smart on what mob you cast it on, since you only have so much rage to spend, revenge costs very little when procced which is why its so good. Either cast it on your main target and tab to another and cast sunder on that, or sunder main target, revenge another.
---
You cannot "spam cleave" to generate AoE threat, its only to dump it if you somehow have too much. Tab sunder and demo shout is much better for AoE threat.
---
&gt; Next job is minimizing the damage taken by using defensive skills, thunderclap etc. 
---
Especially low levels your job really isnt to take as little damage as possible, its to hold aggro and keep mobs off the healer. Thunderclap is a shit ability in terms of damage and threat, its really only good if you manage to aggro 10+ mobs and have way too much rage to spend. 
---
&gt; and maximizing damage by using sunder, rend etc. on mobs that will take time.
---
YOU dont do any damage with sunder, but other people do, and its mostly on bosses where you manage to get a 5 stack sunder up, you dont really use sunder for damage, its for threat and damage for others on bosses. 
---
NEVER use rend as a tanking warrior, you rage is much better spent on any other ability. Most often another stunder is more damage for the party than the rend you put up.
---
Yeah its discouraging trying to find a dungeon group as a 60 ally on Herod. When I do manage to get a full group the journey to the instance is full of so much corpse walking someone always leaves.
---
It took us 45 minutes to get everyone into strat service entrance and then the tank left after the first three bosses. 
---
My record for dying from Chillwind to Scholo is 9 times. 
---
I gave up on anything in BRM
---
What a bunch of bullshit. No one has his combat log open to see if a rogue arounds you goes into stealth. No one scans his combat log and counts up to 90 different players in Blackrock mountains. 
---
During the dueling tournament you had pov of all the people and the majority didn't even have their combat log visible.
---
except of course if this keeps up, people will just quit the game and there will be no one to kill in wpvp.
---
Well, the character name is an online handle, and that is protected by GDPR. The character does not have to be named after the owner for that to be the case. GDPR is applicable for any European citizen, or if any part of the service is located in Europe. I think even for non EU citizen that are residing in Europe, but I'd have to look that up to be sure.
---
PSA: It's been nerfed afaik. 
---
As of the next patch, the range of the combat log will be lowered, basically meaning the addon won't be able to detect stealthed enemies at such a crazy range.
---
What is your problem, let this man have his fun/pride
---
Thalnos!? xD
---
It would be a decent start, but unfortunately the dungeon set has too much Spirit (which isn't completely useless in PvP since you do need to travel a lot around while regenerating) and no Spell Power / Spell Crit / Spell Hit so there are better options available.
---
Nah, they’re expensive over time and require good communication to stack them effectively.
---
https://discord.gg/yuXzvFG 
---
This is the best resource for everything druid. They have a helpful macro list.
---
Except it did and still does.
---
You were able to find players without even being able to see them, even if they were stealthed. That is not information readily available in the game.
---
You are just being a shill for the mod as it was and still is giving an unfair advantage over anyone who doesn't use it.
---
I bursted down that Tauren Warrior with HoR, probably gonna avoid you though
---
I main healed through all BC content and addons like GTFO and modifying DBM with sounds were a god send. crank the sound up on them it'll be hard not to notice if mechanics are happening to you. If you're referring to just basic things like moving your character around you could try moving your raid frames closer to the middle/bottom of your screen that way you can still keep an eye on your character.
---
I’ve noticed the last two nights I’ve gone in there the lashers drop far less loot, specifically grey vendor items. I’d say half to two thirds of them had no loot at all, and I don’t remember being the case a month ago.
---
Mage question.
---
Why is nobody Arcane Missile-ing their way through content?
---
Is it due to how lackluster the skill is? The mana cost? Because every other spec highly outshines it?
---
Now, if one were to want to play Arcane while knowing they'd slightly under-perform, what are the recommend Talents and skills to prioritize?
---
Any specific gear to look for?
---
Arcane seems to benefit the most from crit% so I know we'll have to wait for AQ for the better crit gear.
---
hunters already see people on their track, what spy does is lets them target them without typing /target name and identifies their class/faction for the hunter
---
&gt;like they did with the LFG addon?
---
What are your talking about?! ClassicLFG works just fine. Can you elaborate on your misinformation?
---
Don't use it, won't get it.  I like getting jumped 1v1 then bouncing their heads off the ground (i carry a lot of potions).  I mean is it going to stop me from getting ganked by a kill squad....prolly not.
---
Oh you mean recently? No idea, haven't heard anything about it. I've been farming jump runs myself and those have been consistently good.
---
I didn't read your entire post, so I'm not sure which server you're talking about.
---
But thank you for your concern. I am having fun.

So in P1 of Ony all the dps are just wanding / auto attacking? 
---
I haven't read thru any guides yet. Still working on my attune.
---
As a rogue who isn't pvping yet and merely trying to stealth to instances to help guildies it's pretty shitty that a hunter flare isn't even needed when you can start spamming rank 1 aoe skills at certain choke points as soon as it says a stealthed rogue is in the area.  Oh cool they reduced the radius to 50 yards, now you have a better idea of where I am.  I didn't mind the arena addons that told you group makeups in tbc and then you had to guess at what the stealthed char was (druid/night elf in shadow or rogue), but spy makes me 10000000000000% regret going stealth.  Granted i can still get my openers and what not but thats not the point if im a master of deception rogue with stealth boots 49 yards away from you it sucks that you are alerted to my existence.

A lot of people consider Stormwind the nicest city in the game, with the music and feel, and design especially entering it along the bridge with the statues...
---
For me it will always be Orgrimmar, entering a small hole in a wall and turning a corner into a busy main square that you didn't know existed once and now take for granted. The first thing you encounter is the giant head of a slain dragon for all to see... and then navigating the organized chaos of a city cut into a valley of rock out of necessity by unlikely allies who were looking for a new place to call home.

I mean, what else are you supposed to do at max level right now? A bit of pvp here and there, sure, but nothing overly dramatic.
---
However the server itself is even more filled than ever before. It was med-high pop most of the time, now it's full constantly. The game never felt so active before. So many people to level alts with.

By not being able to see what's going on, what do you mean ? You can still look around yourself. It is a bit sad that you'll be losing out on some information on details, it's one less tool that could've been used to analyze you and your guild's performance. It's also a bit sad that if a druid spends his rebirth or innervate outside your range, you won't be able to see their cooldown on ERT and the such, but certainly it's not that big of a deal. You can still "see what's going on".
---
Why use anything other than Frostbolt? It's OP while leveling and while raiding MC and BWL.
---
Icy Veins has the best guide I know on mage builds. Check it out.

Nope, I know \`/cancelaura\` works, I just wasn't sure if \`/cancelform\` would cancel Shadowform like it does forms for druids. Thanks for confirming!
---
There’s a large difference but I couldn’t afford it at 60. Got it at around 42.
---
Bro just wait until you're raiding for 8 weeks and only get 1 piece of gear cause nothing for your spec ever drops
---
You mean around zone borders? There's some issue with how they set up their servers, where the game is really laggy when switching zones. We've had entire parties pop out of nowhere on EPL-WPL bridge, quite unfortunate for whichever group is smaller.
---
I didn't like the idea of spy, but I accepted it as something you just have to deal with.  I would like for them to have an easy solution to "fix" it, but I am curious to see the side effects of something like this.  If they managed to adjust spy without breaking other shit then cool.  If it is breaking other shit then one of the big concerns has been realized.  I had accepted it because I feared breaking it would break other shit.
---
Sounds like topical discussion happened on a discussion forum. Don’t like it should have rolled on a general wow subreddit. Get gud at Reddit scrub.

---
I’d say AQ and not naxx (basically as soon as you don’t have fire resist and a sufficient crit level). 
---
Fights are still short in AQ and a fire spec is already viable at that point.
---
But agree with the rest of your comment (and even the phase)
---
Won't the mc break the second the other player attacks ? Sounds just like a complicated way of sheeping / sapping with no additional benefit.

&gt;I'm not saying people deserve it for free, I'm saying if somebody is giving the craft for free it is "dicking over" less players than it's helping.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; If somebody started giving out the raid caster enchants for free, I wouldn't be mad. Me and my guild got those by chance, we have access to them, we aren't "getting dicked over" if we can't make money from them. It's an extremely random drop that you get by pure luck. If somebody wants to "dick you over" by crafting it for free, good for them, sucks for you. Deal with it. 
---
But that is not how any free market functions. So if we follow your logic, people should be handing out everything for free since everything is actually is a random drop and it is more beneficial for every one overall if everything gets crafted for free. 
---
1. **You forget the fact that many people actually invest TIME in learning the professions.** It's actually not so worth anymore to actually go for any crafting professions if you have some "nice guy" craft it for you. The only reason are those BoP's. Congratulations, you've destroyed the free market wow has endorsed by being "a nice guy". 
---
2. Here is an idea: Why not just make 1 person per realm per faction with each crafting profession. Problem solved. Every one gets their craftables actually for free. Nice free market there. I mean why do we even have the Auction house? Just make it a dispenser where every nice guy puts random items in there ready to be picked up! In the end people like to slave for others for free! Oh and btw, luck is not ANY part of this game. We don't like that.   
---
So if we get a lucky drop we aren't happy but responsible and actually start free trading people in major cities for craftables. /s 
---
3. Or even better: Why not have a leatherworker/blacksmith/alchemist etc. NPC standing in every major city so you can get your craftables for trading in some materials? This just plain removes free market trading and player interaction which is WoW known for. Retail mentality at it's finest. Perfect stuff love it.
---
&gt; Also, many people do pick BS for the BoP trinket. 
---
Oh you almost had me there fam! You almost had me! I have 400 guild members and 399 of them actually have BS for the trinket! It's the best! That's the only reason they pick BS! /s  
---
Just because the trinket is nieche doesn't mean you roll a whole profession for that reason. Stop trying to make me believe a lie when you can't even believe it yourself.
---
To conclude this: This guy is destroying the free market and actually deserves to be muted IMO. If he would compete and make some reasonable prices like even just a bit of tip would be acceptable. But this is just plain griefing others their fun and chance to enjoy free trading in a game that endorses it.
---
Appalling is a very dramatic word to use here. So is saying you're being denied information. It's just a combat log lol who the hell cares if they weren't one of the ones that were relying on this game-breaking addon. You can still see the numbers pop on in scrolling text. Now people can actually enjoy PvP without a ridiculous disadvantage from something that is external from the game.
---
what happens when you keep losing though? how frustrated do you get? LOL
---
Your race is crucial
---
i did not know thank you
---
DKP systems aren't free from abuse, it's not about someone modifying the tables. I.E: You can have cliques form within the guild to use their collective DKP to bully people with lower DKP to make them spend as much as possible to obtain certain items.
---
I.E: Imagine there are 4 priests, me and my friend have agreed to minimum bid it together and roll off on eye of divinity. If the other two priests bid then we agree that the person with the highest DKP will inflate the price to make them spend their DKP. Eventually we will get benediction after 2 months or so, but in the interim period we may cause the other 2 priests to spend much more DKP than us on said items.
---
Otherwise it's just a constant wait for the next GCD might as well shuffle a bit
---
This sums it up perfectly. It’s a necessary evil that you have because others have it

Issue is only server size. There are like 5x more people then there were in vanilla and everywhere seems overcrowded.

Does spy not pick up stealth? If so less of an outplay and and more of them not having spy lol.

As I said originally we were a different guild and then we merged, previous lead and a couple of officers are really nice guys and I don't think they'd follow if we staged a mutiny. Guess time will tell.

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e0171y/did_anyone_make_a_spell_damage_leather_list_for/). 
---
I remember in the old times damage meter addons did this. Didn't they have to like limit the amount of messages an addon can send to channels a big raid would spam so much that it started affecting their servers or something?
---
Great news as a stealth class, now it won't ding unless im with in aoe range, why not reduce it down to 10 yards and take all the guess work out.
---
So Details is going to be messed up but, what are they referring to here?
---
*" This fix does not affect text logs that the game outputs for raid parses. "*
---
Confused.
---
This.
---
Everything can be done with enough ressource.
---
Per kill, no. But they usually don't even fight back so I can kill a few lowbies a lot faster than 1 60 that's fighting back.
---
I'm a spriest, but I have basically 3 different "sets" of gear that I collect.
---
1) Raid prebis gear. Basically just as much shadow damage as possible.
---
2) PvP / farming gear. High stamina, high intellect, sacrifice the add'l damage. It's nice having more intellect while farming felcloth or whatever so I can drink less often. And obvs stam and int are big for PvP. This is also what you want for leveling. 
---
3) Off-spec / healing gear. I main shadow, but if nobody rolls on heal gear that drops I'll grab it *just in case* I ever need to heal something for some reason.
---
But this is what I am saying. It truly seems moving for a couple seconds still allows them to hit you.
---
Well except that flying was actually implemented into the game but the devs, for better or worse. Spy is an addon.
---
This game is heroin. I used to be like you, free from this curse getting full nights of sleep and being productive.

Now I'm almost done my second level 60 and in a guild that is 10/10 MC and 1/1 Onyxia.

As soon as you step back into this world it doesn't matter what limits you set, your willpower will be tested. Be ready.
---
Did for alliance lol
---
What was the distance previously? I can't see any info about it, just that it is 50 yards now.
---
God bless o7.
---
You're right. Blizzard shouldn't allow PvP on PvP servers.
---
Absolutely, DBM should have been tackled 10 years ago, and we might have had a better game than what retail is right now.
---
yay!
---
....lol
---
I know right?
---
I'm the dedicated Resto and last time I started Boomkin'ing for the fun of it (and because the fight was won) and our MT started laughing when he saw me do that.
---
I'd love to do the same as an Arcane Mage once in a while...
---
Play on a PvE server or group up with friends. Strength in numbers.

I would like to try it out you know but gotta do it in a different server since I'm ally on stonespine.

Do you usually heal in 5man dungeons?

Any tips for solo gold farming as warrior?

The ranged dps needs to save mana to burn ony down to 40% in her airborne phase. Thats why people recommend not to spend mana on attacks in p1
---
&gt;DBM wasn't, 
---
by name but there were boss mod addons that we all used
---
OK boomer.
---
It does matter if you're worried about leveling speed. If you'd prefer not to farm/grind heavily then getting it a bit after 40 should be fine.
---
Maybe join a guild and get some support?
---
PVE servers don't have this issue. You made a choice, live with it.
---
Well done mate, gotta love a classic achievement!
---
Your saying no one.

You mean you.

Because I've met some pvp refugees.

Thanks everyone for all the feedback I really appreciate it, 😊 now to find a guild and lvl my tauren druid, and on the side lvl my mage

Horde side it's one run in lower and 3 runs in upper.

Funny several have sooooo.

I wish the guy who made spy addon would just break it or remove it
---
Backpedal is useful for limiting leeway..... I dont get all the hate for this, and yes I know you move faster, but you wont move faster if you get dazed or meleed 20 times
---
Really like your UI. Mind sharing the addons / setup you've got goin?
---
My assumption was that because they're in a duel, the MC'd player is basically the same as a pet for the priest, so the player they're dueling can attack freely without it breaking. But I'm not a priest and have never played as a priest, so I'm not too positive about the mechanics of mind control - if anyone else with more knowledge about it wanted to chime in that would be great.
---
Night elves cant say go back to retail. Horde can say it to alliance.

Also this is a 2v1?

I was in there as 51 so he can enter no problem.

Have a good idea of what you need to do to during the fight before the encounter starts.
---
Use DBM or some other addon to give you alerts of what's going on.
---
Have a good raid leader who calls out what's going on (Direction of Onyxia Breath / Living Bomb target, etc.)

When someone answers you can you tell me? I've been wondering this about weapon poisons myself.

Just more than some. Everything I have said has already been confirmed by dozens of players over on the main forums. Sorry your crutch got nerfed. Enjoy.
---
It's okay, but I prefer BGs.
---
My server is fairly horde sided, which means ally is constantly grouped. I want to play solo as I'm a rogue and that's pretty much impossible. And if I group up the honor per hour is absolutely garbage unless if we are lucky with finding and killing many grouped up allies. I can imagine it being quite fun on a balance server I suppose, but those hardly exists.
---
It reads from the combat log. They can't break it without breaking the combat log.
---
Keep in mind i also run 1440P resolution aswell with those framerates
---
You know what they say about big feet
---
When im leveling my druid i know instantly without seeing anyone to go stealth just incase. Its too OP.
---
You did the right thing, but you should've told him why or he'll never learn. That's how you should act as a parent towards a child at least: only punish with explanation.
---
The 'nochanges' community is just toxic. They don't actually mean 'nochanges', they mean 'nochangesidontagreewith'. They should be against increased server sizes, changed infernal behavior, they changed the way tanking works to weaken spellcleave, layoring, the list goes on.
---
I'm playing with 3.6 ghz i9, 32 GB 2667 MHz DDR4 iMac and it still lags in capital places like orgrimmar rush hour. But I believe most glitches/lags are caused by client, not your PC itself because my other laptop, 2016 i7 MacBook Pro 8gb ram runs WoW with same performance. Both of them freeze in same situation and normally runs really smooth. (Using the same WTF/Interface folder on both computer, so same settings.)
---
WoW runs smooth but it still struggles to open Powerpoint for example. That's the problem of the app.
---
But that's unreliable. A tank very well may not generate enough threat to keep onyxia off you during the few seconds these things buy. Theres a non-marginal chance you'll waste both a few gold on a potion and more gold on repairs.
---
Do you know what is reliable, though? Simply not generating more threat than the people capable of tanking her.
---
Do you know how you accomplish that? Letting those people dps P1.
---
IMO Zerg PvP is never fun and due to the increased number of players per server compared to Vanilla it’s about all I see. 
---
I’m glad I rolled on a PvE server so I can avoid the Zerg mass.
---
Idc if I'm at a disadvantage, I refuse to use it. In terms of total downloads honestly not that many people use it. Reddit is a fraction of total player base as well. Most people you encounter are not using it.. so really you're the one making it unfair in most fights.
---
Damage dealer / whisper me
---
If you go watch old pvp videos of people roaming open world, you notice that a lot of them have the combat limit g open for exactly this reason; they keep an eye on it and they can see enemy players combat log actions to alert them to their presence.
---
Or, you collude with the other 2 priests as well, and agree to spend min bid to get the eyes/tier pieces, so that you can win items like ToEP and cauterizing band over the other healers/dps.
---
Bid DKP is extremely abuseable; but there are other systems like EP/GP that don't have those problems.
---
every day there are 2-5 rogues doing this and 10-20 others in IF in the room to the right of the general goods vendor
---
its gotten so common people dont even yell about it in general anymore
---
Spy's range is now less than visual range. A stealth user could ride up behind you. Casually dismount and enter stealth. Spy would never pick them up. This has been tested and confirmed by dozens of players.
---
It’s definitely worth it over the course of 40-60 (this is more than half of the entire 1-60, a good 3-4 days /played for most people). If it’s your first character I wouldn’t bother stopping (as a druid) to farm gold specifically for it *because* you have travel form, but if it’s an alt and you’re not struggling for gold just purchase it right away.
---
Well, you know, we get ganked too. I really was going to quest when I got jumped by that rogue.
---
Yeah it's shitty, I feel for all the warriors just trying to level, try just parking your toon in the instance and leaving them there until you need repairs. You're still gonna die a lot on the way into the instance, but you can sit inside and look for a group and hopefully save some time corpse running
---
Yes very appalling lol.
---
Isn't healcomm communicating with the other addon users anyway instead of reading combat log?
---
&gt;  It’s not true to classic.

[Paranoia is a small addon which keeps a constant lookout for enemy players. It does this by parsing certain chat messages and if it detects an enemy player, it will play a sound and show the enemy player in a small window, together with its class and level (if this information can be gathered, e.g. whenever you target him/her).](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/project-1853)

Theres nothing changed from the old bugs and reset spots. i reset mobs in  dm east when i fuck up at lashers (standing on top of the fallen columns in lashers room, i reset hydrospawn there aswell when he agroos the imps next to him, i reset mobs in lbrs.....theres tons and tons of creative use of game mechanics all over wow dungeons, and its been so since 2004.
---
Blizz never banned any1 for doing that on dungeons.
---
Bread shoes
---
The range of the spell can vary though
---
Depends on what you mean by world pvp.
---
If you mean the idea of the big TM/SS tug of war, it's fun for awhile but it usually comes down to who has more people and much more fun for ranged who can pick off stragglers than melee you charge in and watch yourself get dotted immediately to die.
---
If you mean finding people out in the wild where one group sees and attacks another, it can be more fun, but this is also prone to being a situation people don't want to deal with.
---
I never enjoyed world pvp in vanilla outside of short bursts.  There was never really an objective besides go kill them.  There was no zone objective in something like Warhammer.  They did add Silithus/EPL objectives, but those were mostly stupid.  World pvp was always a big zerg fest which came down to who had more people rather than who was better.
---
I did enjoy BGs a lot more, especially wsg.  AV as a thing.  I'd play AB to do something different, but I wasn't a huge fan.  I didn't hate it like I would Eye of the Storm or Strand of the Ancients, but wsg was always my favorite.
---
Can also be healer aggro that's often overlooked
---
Thinking of going ele/enhanc while lvling but healing in dungeons to find a group with ease
---
Not a lot. 20-30 yards absolute max over 50.
---
Congrats! Wise man travelling to Menethil for the sleek black stallion. I just got mine last night :) Enjoy!
---
It only drop your threat during the 6 seconds duration of the potion, after that it comes back to the initial amount you had. You'll most likely still have the aggro but it gives you time to replace north so you don't kill your whole raid with her breath.
---
I have not made it into a brm insurance since phase 2 with less than 5-6 deaths, and most of the time it is 10+ on skeram.
---
Right? If they would just admit they are shitty people then it wouldn’t be a problem. But they all try to make excuses to avoid the label that what is happening is shitty. No accountability the lot of them.

wpvp is amazing and organic, people actually fighting over resources, calling in back up and just people playing together.
---
The problem is that there are a lot of shit servers with skewed faction ratio, Blizzard haven't yet tackld this issue but if give out free faction/server transfers it might help alleviate the issue.
---
I play on a very well balanced server (like 51-49 on last census), and enjoy every second of Wpvp, where no faction has complete supremacy. It usually takes turns, where one faction dominates X area for 20 min, then it switchd and people just fall into bitch fights over resources. Its great.
---
I've already discussed this with my friend and here's how they're going to do it: they will sell you things you don't want or need. TBC will be packaged with 'extras' that will justify to Blizzard reselling a title we already paid for. It will be something like those who already have TBC will get an exclusive mount or level boost or something along those lines.

Technically, there’s no reason for undead to not understand common. 
---
I get they speaking it may be difficult with a rotten throat, but hearing it should be fine. 
---
Undeads were human once after all.
---
Literally wrong. The second people show up in spy you can target them by clicking them. This means they are in render distance. The combat log ONLY shows things in render distance.
---
AV though? ....
---
Youre just looking for a break instead of work. This is why ive been saying that bgs shouldve been in the game from the start. Pvp is a way to have fun when youre tired of leveling and you seem to be in that space right now.  
---
The thing to keep in mind is that, you dont need to get to 60 asap unless you want to. Theres nothing waiting for you there, it isnt "once youre 60 the game finally starts" like later expacs, youre already doing what youd do at 60 pretty much, except that youd be running dungeons over and over until you get 1 item.

Well since Kazzak was downed by 4-6 raid groups from Mind games on first spawn in 20 seconds or some shit most guilds don't bother with the world bosses on Horde.
---
It keeps your threat the same.
---
Objectively that is hilarious
---
I spent most of my evening in BRM, WPL and EPL. Spy's range after the changes were incredibly short. The vast majority of the time I had to assist it by running my cursor over enemies as I spotted them. 50 yards in WOW does not correlate to 50 years irl. 
---
It went from practically being a cheat to being mostly a glorified target list. 
---
I am delighted beyond words at these changes.
---
Good Job Blizzard.
---
I dps throughout every phase and other than waiting like 10 seconds at the pull it hasn't been a problem yet for us.
---
Thing is.
---
The standart keybinds are turn camera left/right on A/D. 
---
Its very slow compared to holding right mousebutton down for turn the camera.
---
If you ever saw a player "keyboard turn" in pvp, you know what i mean. 
---
Thats why most players have A/D bound to strafe left/right instead. 
---
Some also unbind the S key for backwards walking, cause its by default slower as turning camera 90° with mouse and strafe-walk. 
---
In pvp thats a huge thing, cause you dont want run or turn camera slower. Good player always try standing behind you, cause you cant hit enemys behind you. Also cant parry/dodge hits from behind. 
---
Most get a habit for wiggle left/right in other situation too. Just cause of boredom between global cooldowns. 
---
Its also known for communicate "do something" or "interact with me" or "iam ready" without typing in chat in the heat of combat.
---
Tl;dr: if you wanna min max pve dps, human on alliance and orc on horde.
---
For tanks, humans and either orc or troll.
---
For PvP, gnome or orc.
---
If you don't care, play what you want to, all races work.
---
This happened to me once during TBC, one of the mount hyjal bosses. I was a tree Druid and everyone started dropping at the end. And then it was just me. I was like “moon fire, moon fire, moon fire!”  And thankfully the boss died. 39 people in ventrilo going crazy. Was so awesome. Had to battle Rez an actual rezer to get the raid back going.
---
Yeah but it's not an argument against Blizzard changing how it works, addons shouldnt be required to fix functions of the game.
---
&gt;No one has his combat log open to see if a rogue arounds you goes into stealth
---
Well now that's not true at all. [This is how my chat boxes are set up](https://imgur.com/a/Nac1jA5). 
---
You'd be surprised how many players don't play with ~~crutches~~ addons.
---
Fyi, u dont need truestrike shoulders as they are not BIs once u hit 6%, which is crazy easy once u get ur lionheart(should be prio #1 on hitting 60) ur bow and misc rings/boots/bracers. Flamescarred in dm:w or go for the actual Bis and get black dragonscale to go with flameguard gaunts when u break devilsaur. Dal'rend is a tough one and SGC is a serious commitment. Ive seen reports of 200+ arena farms with no SGC and the tombstone breastplate is a very close 2nd chest so id get that. As ppl have said, tank urself and dont bring ppl who will take ur gear.
---
Speculating here, it might be because its a talented ability? Like rank 1 is shown because you spent the talent point, but you can train a higher level of it, hence the rank 4. But they should share a cd. 
---
Someone else said they had the same thing with shield slam, which is also talented.
---
Soulstone.
---
On a serious note, just know who the second tank is, and curb your dps in P 1 and 2  to make sure you have less threat than that player.
---
Sorry this is incorrect. Spy only takes information from the combat log and puts it into a lazy person friendly UI for you to look at. It does not and can not provide you any information that the combat log does not already provide to you.
---
Spy nor the combat log can scan and broadcast units that are stealthed, unless the stealther enters or exits stealth in the logging range. This is why I consider the "Nerf" to the logging distance a buff.  Now I know someone has stealthed within 50 yards instead of 100.
---
If you want to argue that Spy makes it easier to be aware of what's going on around you then fine, but it does not provide any additional information that the games doesn't already provide to you.
---
How much did the gold cost?
---
its the \#nochanges cult trying to ruin the game, as usual.

Bounty hunter = human = alliance
---
Baby yoda = alien monster thing = horde
---
you can still target everyone in 40v40, even while gates closed, so i'm hoping for that too
---
I'm not convinced this is true.
---
Vast majority of top pvpers have rolled horde. Why would they intentionally put themselves at a big disadvantage? 
---
I think horde players just say paladins are so amazing in order to feed their own egos. "oh i didnt lose because i got outplayed, it's those blasted paladins that are so overpowered".
---
I'll be able to make up my own mind once BGs come out but, like I said, im not convinced this isn't all just horde propaganda
---
I found the BG news decimated the population even more. A ton of people are just sleeping until Bg launch.
---
How's the life of an enhance? Just autos and totems? Can u deliver huge bursts in pvp at 40 too?
---
50 yards is realllly short, like well within draw range.
---
Probably Nefarian and Chromaggus.

Good dudes. Alk is hilarious. I was in Onslaught with Alk in TBC on the Skullcrusher realm. We've hung out a couple times IRL, and he's fucking hilarious. If I was going to play classic, I'd probably head his way to see if he had room for an old friend.

Yeah, it's definitely different than vanilla.

I spent 90% of my time PvPing and playing with world mechanics. This new engine is such a different feel we might as well be classic+ already.
---
Homer: Steak?
---
Marge: Money’s too tight for steak.

That would reduce all addons that utilize the logs effectiveness. This range is a comfortable middle ground.

Last one yes and the rest are unknown. Bliz changed UI permission so we can't take a census of players anymore so the rest are literally just unknown.
---
&gt; Why is nobody Arcane Missile-ing their way through content?
---
Why they should? With Frostbolt you are not aggroing mob before you finish cast, you slow it down and even may freeze him.  
---
In 20% situations mob won't even reach frost mage.  
---
Also they are not "slightly under-perform". DPS difference is more like x2-x3 times.
---
I blame fucked up Troll voodoo.
---
Jokes aside, gnome mage is already boring enough. A little fun doesn’t do any harm
---
Top quality shitposting. Have my upvote!
---
100% agree. For the way I use Spy, this is a huge buff lol
---
This wont solve the faction imbalance problem; the hope is that with Horde having way longer Qs for BGs it will slowly push more horde off :)
---
oh shit. I think I saw that on the AH on my server!
---
It clearly depends on the server you play on, and how populated it is. I play alliance on Ten Storms EU and have had many positive experiences roaming about with my guild and irl friends killing hordes. wPvP as a concept cannot be balanced, but retaking menethil from a horde gank squad or fighting to gain access to MC with my guild feels epic and memorable. Solo gameplay however seems near impossible in peak pop hours, but I am overall having a fun time, but that is as a level 60 with decent gear. Ganking with friends and sometimes having epic fights and battling for control of zones is some of the most fun i've had since release.
---
you definetly want SGC and hoj as a warrior so take a break and get back in there! :) 
---
chromatic chest is nice for pvp/mc so get that one too!
---
The only problem I have seen so far is it has thrown off meters on large raid bosses. Stuff like Ony. That is something I can work around with ease.
---
How do you set flair?
---
The detailed logs in your log folder if you have it enabled.  For things like warcraftlogs.
---
This is gold.
---
Honestly... while i enjoyed to endgame plan my WoW experience. I would advice you to maybe try an easier class to lvl.
---
I've got a lvl 60 hunter and a lvl 24 warrior. And i can't really be bothered playing on the warrior anymore. Even doh I try to boost my warrior with weapons/cash from my main.  
---
Reason: 
---
1. Survivability. You lack it as a warrior, and as a hunter you gain more and more tools to not waste time and do quests and lvling efficiently
---
2. Soloing content. As a warrior you'll struggle on any elite or slightly higher quests. As a hunter i was able to solo all normal quests with no real issue and even some elite quests with minor problems.
---
3. Equipment/cash, as a warrior you're so dependent on having the right equipment and the cash to buy skills and repair your stuff. As a hunter you're much less dependant, as your pet will do his dmg and have health/armour increased with lvling. As such you can easily lvl up and use questitems/drops with ease in lvling, and even skip buying some skills without it affecting your questing.
---
4. It's so much easier to farm/explore as a hunter. Hunters gain aspect of the cheeta and with their pet they wont need to heal up, meaning less downtime.
---
I would advice you if you don't want to run the risk off burning out or get bored quickly. To maybe try a different class or be prepared for a challenge. I will probably lvl my warrior in the end, as he has great equipment and now guildies with alts to lvl with.
---
Now do a little bit of basic reading on ratios, look at the standard ratios on most PvP and know that, just by pure numbers it is way worse of a problem on the horde side. 
---
I swear, ya horde get so defensive that you can’t even acknowledge basic math.
---
Addon galore 🤢
---
Just as a side note: supposedly, combat log range remains unchanged inside instances. HealComm should be fine.
---
41 yards is hunters max distance damage ability.  I was seeing WAY farther than that with spy on my hunter.
---
Probably around 55/45 population in the alliances' favour and it's been relatively stable as far as classic realms goes but in a slow decline for sure.
---
I think it's an upscaled Warcraft 3 model
---
Ah ok
---
&gt; The thing to keep in mind is that, you dont need to get to 60 asap unless you want to. Theres nothing waiting for you there
---
There is. That's when I at least have half a chance in every fight - I may not win, but I may have a chance of getting away. 
---
Right now, I don't stand a chance when I get jumped by a 60. Unless I get REALLY lucky (it happened), I don't really get time to do anything before dying. Last night I was trying to root a level 51 warrior - 3 resists in a row. 
---
That's what I'm looking forward to - that and battlegrounds, I guess. I don't think I can be bothered with farming "pre-bis" gear in instances. Vanilla instances fucking suck.
---
Your research about it only being "viable on the Alliance" is odd, I'm surprised a guide wrote that.
---
Essentially 2h Slam spec is okay, it's viable. It's just not as good as Arms MS spec for PVP, not as good as DW fury on the Alliance and not as good as DW Fury or 2h Hamstring with WF on the Horde.
---
It's just the most average of all the builds. As a Horde research into the WF Hamstring build with your 2H for sure.
---
Gz on your OBE :D Make sure you kill many Alliance with it!
---
BUT, this is offset by several things. One, the high farming classes have to compete with each other more than everyone else. So unless they are colluding to keep the price of tier sets down, they're paying dis-proportionally more and it's getting spread out through the guild. So, it's a way to funnel money for enchants/BoEs/profs whatever to the classes that don't have good ways of farming.
---
Sure, hunters want things like quick strike ring; but if there's MS/OS rolls then warriors still have all their tier sets, plate, and melee weapons that hunters can't outbid them on. They have plenty of opportunities for gear.
---
On top of that, prices naturally drop over time. As people get geared, there are fewer people bidding on items, so the worse farming classes end up making a good chunk of gold to counteract them getting geared slower.
---
I don't think it's a perfect system, but I can see it working pretty well and being very hard to manipulate; especially compared to LC.
---
I’ve noticed Blaumeux Alliance side has died down. IF not as busy and finding groups for anything at BRM is a pain in the ass.
---
Rogue players really do be thinking that spy can see through stealth
---
Ahh yes, please prove your point further by defending backpedaling in 2019
---
It actually is the bis tankimg weapon for certain fight like nefarius. 
---
@OP The fast attack speed and attack speed boost is worth keeping it. Just know when to use.
---
tbf that's also how we got retail
---
I fury tank as well to get my prepaid bis.  Holding threat is actually pretty easy IMO.  Charge, zerker, bloodrage, WW, def stance, sunder/rev/demo away.  In 10 sec WW again. I'll throw on a shield if my health yoyos too much.
---
Make sure you are doing dmg to the mobs via cleave/ww/autoswings.  Having mages do shatter combos and keep all the threat is an amazing feeling.
---
Side note:  99th run and still no HOJ or SGC.  Got LH, ony neck, onslaught all before this stupid chest/trinket.
---
"The MC jump is so easy if you're a mage bro. Just jump over, 360 and blink into the wall once you're above the lava."
---
t. man who hit the ledge next raid
---
Im ally :)
---
Supposedly the server has a close to even split (something like 45/55 alliance favoured - don't quote me on that), however lots of people are saying the actual split (taking into account people actually online and participating in wPvP for example) is much more heavily alliance favoured.
---
I played with a shitty 2013 iMac and still didn't get a problem in raids/cities. (was playing on low graphics). But indeed iMac sucks in gaming in price/performance balance. I can build a tower pc with same price and double/triple the performance.
---
Yeah I use DBC and it's a great simple little add-on. Was just wondering if there was a good all in one package custom made for druids. Will try out FSR.
---
Hunter 1 and 2 are wrong lol. You want to aimed shot and multishot as much as possible, during trash and everything. Send pet in, call it back if it should die. You can consistently get into top 10 dps for now, even without stellar gear.
---
Wait for 1 sunder, do autoshot  and send pet. Immediately aimed, auto, multi, auto, auto, aimed and repeat.
---
Have a big 2 hander and raptor shot bound. When the lava dudes charge into you or near, smack it with a 2handed raptor shot. You might get a 1k crit.
---
Drink as often as possible between pulls, the raid will not wait for you.
---
I will repeat this, try not to let your pet die!
---
Have fun!
---
A troll hunter
---
This makes a lot of sense now.
---
Idk if it helps but Mounts are only better than Travel form when you have to Travel for longer than 20 seconds mounted. For long distance a mount is a must but for city travel and questing Travel form is perfect.
---
It kinda does. It makes it so she won't target you for the duration of the pot. Just chug one then go stand on the north wall and hope your tank has gotten enough threat in 6sec.
---
He has True Sight. Just back away slowly!
---
Hamstring kiting doesn’t work in Classic. Mobs are able to hit you for two swings after you leave their melee range.
---
Jokes on them, I don't even have an ankh
---
How did yall get up there?
---
Let me give you an example. Imagine hiding on top of your flag room in wsg, how can u see nameplates of people coming in through the tunnel?
---
We tell our locks to run to MT position so she doesn't breathe on the raid
---
That technically is win trading.
---
Yup, saw the same on Flamelash EU. My guild and I transferred to Bloodfang EU where the faction is 50/50. Have not regretted it.
---
Why so many more MC runs and so few Ony runs?
---
I hold my pee until it hurts to make time
---
Griefing is still against TOS, especially when there’s zero way to prevent it. For opposing faction pvp is an option, but you can’t stop same faction.
---
What's the horde equivalent of Menethil harbor where 4-5 stealth classes can camp and farm honor?
---
You only need one person in your premade in the major cities to queue up everyone.
---
Undead could speak common in Beta
---
That would never work, horde would control it 100%, alliance would have 50x the difficulty getting to Brm because there’s only 1 way for them to go, and it’ll be way more camped. The game would be dead within a day of this happening.
---

The IPS panel feels like i’ve been half blind my whole life and i can finally see clearly.
---
I'm not raiding yet and this info u gave me is the contrary everybody is saying about elementals mana in boss fight.
---
So, its worth the gold spent in rune pots+water+repairs vs gold earned in raid run??  
---
I'm not alchemist that's why I was learning about DR
---
Sadly it's one of the bad ones so not very much at all. You might be able to trick someone out of 20-50 gold if your lucky.
---
All they have to do is not log to your client enemy faction player spells that are not affecting you. This is not hard, this doesn't need weeks nor months of development time. The only issue here is assigning a dude to patch the system, they're probably all busy with the new expansion.
---
Are you a game developer? Do you have access to the wow dev game files?
---
Having the information that Details outputs be slightly off is a price I am willing to pay ten fold.

you gotta be real butthurt about it to make this post lol
---
Ironfoe in first BRD run. Won with greed. With my hunter.
---
Yes. That’s right. 
---
I’m just thinking from a purely lore wise perspective. 
---
It’s all academical
---
Nefarian. He’s not the most demanding boss there but he’s the culmination of all that goes before. When you’re standing in front of him, you know it’s because you and your raid have worked together and overcome everything he’s thrown at you and now it’s his turn.
---
&gt;significantly more skilled
---
The horde is cannon fodder.
---
Slam spec played perfectly without any mistakes or latency issues is supposedly a tiny bit more dps than hamstring 2h. 1 clipped auto or 1 missed slam and u do less dps. U cant mess up hamstfing spec in these ways so just play that instead. If ur serious about doing the absolute max dps u can then just dual wield. But with obs edge u will do awesome 2h fury dps just dont cast slam.
---
All it does is scrape the combat log for information
---
It uses such basic functions of the addon API that it's impossible to break it without breaking 90+% of addons. Not even DPS meters would work.
---
Depends if your talking about raids or PvP and since you didn’t specify your probably not going to get a good answer
---
Don't use it, don't need it, don't want it.
---
It just happens so damn much ... like come on and fight me in a real battle.  Claiming victory like that is so stupid.
---
World pvp is and always had been gank squads. 
---
Organic isn't the word I'd use for it but it's not far off. I do like fighting for resources but when it's imba like my server my faction can't even leave our starting zones.
---
I appreciate the effort and upvoted your comments.
---
Congrats! :)
---
I use it because everyone else is. I wish I didnt have to.
---
Actually the most importation info spy gave was just outside of render distance. Because otherwise you could just see whats going on.
---
Jesus christmas..
---
Didnt really think much of the dude even as a world 1st 60 in classic but after that loot scenario I sure as hell aint gonna be watching that dude stream anything. Seems toxic AF! 
---
what a moron
---
Thank you!! I can hardly contain myself!
---
If your lowest GUIDs happen to be rogues, have you tried swapping tank / melee positioning? 
---
As tanks should never be knocked back, their position does not matter as long as they are in heal range. And rogues (or any melee without intercept) would get knocked onto the ledge and barely take any fall dmg. No need to have melee equip fire res imho.
---
Mine were when they announced Classic wow.
---
Not certain melee leeway is a thing in retail, where I habitually started doing it as a melee in PvP because if you can get behind your opponent, then you can force them to fail attacks/spells, and there’s no cost to moving while attacking. The advantage you get from this is pretty substantial against less skilled players.
---
Well, it puts all gear on pretty equal footing; and you're acting like this is a huge gold sink for warriors when it's actually probably going to net them money. Warriors aren't the class pricing up all their drops; that's hunters/locks/mages since they have more disposable income. It's a way to get money *to* your warriors. And then, it's just like saying X item is 500g and lionheart is 1k; the player can choose when they want to buy what.
---
As for consumables, healers will spend 30g on mana pots because it's a requirement? It's a bad example, and you can use that exact same argument *right now*. Why spend 30g on mana pots when it gives me less gold to buy eye of shadow? Or hide of the wild? Or truefaith vestments? Or the BoE T1 pieces? Or epic mount? Or PvP gear? Or level profs?
---
Well, isn't this "job" actually given to a hunter?
---
Being able to spam R1 wing clip meanwhile ret can't actually spam anything to reliably apply the debuff.

Color me confused. I’m a little drunk. Explain

Make a FIX that more closely resembles the vanilla experience.

Yea that makes sense wow will run on a lot, speaking of laptops, do you think a 3500U 12gb with Vega 8 graphics can handle wow? I think it will be able to but not totally sure
---
All may enter The Light! 
---
Some may leave.
---
At the very start of classic there was a lot of outrage over the addon, people saying it takes away from the classic experience etc. Blizzard then announced some days later that they were working on limiting the add-on.
---
"We’ve been closely following the community discussion around this add-on for WoW Classic, as well as analyzing it to make sure we understand how it works. After careful examination, we believe the nature of ClassicLFG is incompatible with our social design for Classic. Thus, in an upcoming patch (in the weeks following launch), we will be adding restrictions to the Classic add-on API that will significantly limit this add-on and others like it."
---
Came here to ask this question. Thank you for getting the answer!
---
I´ve got Epic book for war/paladin quest from my first DM lasher run (day after DM opening) from dusty tome on the ground. That was my luckiest moment of all yet cause I earned my epic mount in few minutes. My plan was to farm there for like 30 hours for it, lmao.
---
It's precursor was known as paranoia which was around in 05.
---
Had the same thing happen a few days ago. It was a fun game of hide and seek.
---
People never read.
---
The number of times I did jed/rend runs to get briarwood reed and would advertise something like "LFM DPS Jed/Rend run, have jed id" and people would whisper "do you have jed?".  People would even join the grp, turn up, we'd start and they'd be like "this is a jed id right?".
---
Honestly sometimes I feel like the number of people paying attention in wow is less than 10%.
---
What's the discord info?
---
Nobody seems to be saying that, nice troll tho

What are the tricks? Shadow necessity, or can I do is as disc?

google what was the best Graphics and CPU in 2011 and buy something cheap comparable today. Should be enough .
---
Lol of you don’t use your combat log when roaming for world pvp you are an idiot
---
what class are you? Im a pally and the regen scales with spell/healing power which makes it utterly broken cuz you can regen 400-600hp every 5 seconds.
---
My second MC PuG I won 3 pieces of T1 and Ring of Spell Power all through open rolls....I kinda felt bad taking everything but goddamn has my RNG never been that lucky.
---
Yeah honestly I almost find it easier to tank her with 15-20ish people.  If you have too many she burns so fast that besides wiping MTs threat and maybe top 3-4 DPS everyone else still has full threat.  This week we literally took forever because we had 17 people and half of them died to deep breath so finished the fight with sub-10 which took quite a while.
---
thanks!
---
Considering theyre letting 57 and 58s into raids, I wouldnt worry about it that much.
---
If it was easy and you had all your coveted items, youd probably call it quits anyways.
---
Do note that it only affects in-game addons. So people can’t crank their cocks immediately over meters, but they’ll be able to do so on logs. But it does affect threat meters, but the only fight that is a big deal for that is Ony. But most don’t grasp her threat regardless of an addon.

HERE COMES THE PAIN BITCH
---
Someone commented that battlegrounds are rendered differently.
---
Nonetheless, in the real world, render and draw distance are stupidly low.  Dungeons too, as another poster mentioned in SM Cath you should be able to see boss from cathedral doors but you cant.
---
Really Blizzard, anything to save a few bucks on server costs eh?
---
The dps can LOS the greater blessing of light then recieve a normal blessing of might while tanks LOS it
---
Anyone using the Silver Dragon add on?  If so, will it alert if a rare spawn becomes visible or only once I see it's nameplate?
---
It's the worst addon in the game atm. I still dont use it but all the friends i run around with do. no point in setting up ambushes or hiding, it's ridiculous.
---
... so you had literally no point whatsoever then and are just lashing out at the specific things you don't like and pretending that X add-on is different than Y add-on even though they functionally accomplish an identical outcome for different things ... and then trying to justify your asinine stance with your concept of how things "should be" according to your own stupid metric. Got it.
---
Never tried it as disc , but should be doable . And basically you just need to outrange the mindblasts when he starts casting them.  Shadow reflector helps a ton .
---
To my knowledge, it's never explicitly explained in the canon/lore.  It's theorized that they're elemental, and/or tied in some way to the creation of Azeroth itself - as if the planet secreted them.
---
However, there's another theory that they're tied in some way to Old Gods.  This theory has some merit, as oozes are often found in areas that have been in some way touched by the Old Gods or their forces - Un'goro, Hinterlands, Wetlands, etc.
---
Another idea is that they're somehow tied to the Emerald Dream.  Oozes can be found in The Hinterlands and The Barrens/Wailing Caverns, both locations with ties to the Emerald Dream.  Or, the Emerald Dream itself might not be their origin...but rather the Emerald *Nightmare.*  Perhaps the corruption of the Emerald Dream gave birth to Oozes somehow.
---
Or, quite simply, Oozes could just be a product of rot and decay.  They're typically found in areas infested by the Burning Legion or the Scourge.  This could actually unite all the ensuing theories.  Secreted by Azeroth because of the Old God(s) imprisoned within, found in areas touched by Old Gods, found in areas touched by Burning Legion/Scourge, etc.
---
Can't we translate the line "go cry on reddit" ?
---
Vanilla will never ever have fair fights. There is level, gear, class, tallents, opener, current hp and or mana, cooldowns ready, proffessions, already in combat, sitting waiting to be crit. There are just to many variables to have a fair fight.
---
I understand completely why it exists. It’s to get the best gear possible like any other action in the game and then try to dominate on the field against other people your same level to get honor. 
---
That’s beside the point of my assertion that two twink premades going against each other is the most balanced the game can be. I’m not denying there are people who do it just to dominate same level players. But that is not the goal of hard core twink groups. 
---
We’re talking about two different things here. 
---
You want to focus purely on the single players who twink to pick on under-geared players. 
---
Because of the way the progress of gearing is set up in the game, it’s almost impossible to find a group of perfectly matched level 60s in pvp gear. With twinks, it’s very possible to get the best gear for your specific level. Then winning comes down to which group has better skill and communication.
---
I like wpvp a lot more when it's not quite as hyped as it is now. While leveling I enjoy the threat and engagements of wpvp. I also like small skirmish style wpvp where a group of alliance or horde try to hold the road or a quest hub resulting in the need to create a counter group to clear then out. This also occurs more during leveling.
---
When I was in Ashenvale I regularly had 5-10 man groups colliding and it was a ton of fun. The zone felt like a battleground, but you were able to avoid the larger scale PvP if you wanted and were smart about it. I'm not really an RPer but wpvp brings out that side of me and I think of it as real battles and skirmishes.
---
60 wpvp has been a bit of a let down honestly. It's definitely more about efficient zone sweeping. honor seems to have ruined real and organic wpvp as weird as it sounds. The rewards cause a different behavior that is focused on getting as many kills in as little time as possible. And because a huge majority of players are farming honor. Population inbalance is much easier to see.
---
Which all conveniently have a foot fetish.
---
If they’re doing the same thing, then you can’t get behind them, but you have to try because it costs nothing to do, and you can win a fight if they mess up. Alternatively, if your opponent isn’t an experienced PvP’er, and they use their keyboard to turn or are otherwise bad at keeping you in front of them, doing this is just a huge advantage through the whole fight.
---
Onslaught downed Azuregoes in literally 20 seconds after spawning last night as well lmao. 
---
There isn't much of a point in contesting them until they start getting lazy.
---
What is a real battle?
---
Transfer to arcanite reaper, my guild left Blau last night. Not crowded you can herb,fish,mine we even had some skirmishes in org to let the horde know we arrived. Also the people on alliance seem to be mostly working folks so everyone is pretty chill.
---
Wow, so instead of actually, you know, *paying more money or devoting more resources to fixing the lag*, the solution they went with was to keep resources the same but decrease our draw distance? Jesus christ.
---
This setup is way overpowered for WoW and you're just showing off xD
---
Jokes on you, I just stopped leveling at 47 so I was a worthless gray to 60s, then proceed to kill them with no consequences to losing.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPXkm7ta24
---
Idk, I remember a healing addon that basically picked your heal for you to be the most efficient.  There were plenty of addons they just weren't as well known because internet communication wasn't as strong.  I remember elitist jerks being the go-to, but there wasn't much else.
---
It adds a small amount of burst (small because you don't have Ruin) which can turn the tide of 2v1s and 3v1s, but it's at the cost of Nightfall and Grim Reach. So basically you just get consistent minor burst on demand for a lot of soul shard use in exchange for decreased range and bigger inconsistent burst through nightfall so I personally don't think it's worth that trade off. What you really get out of it is the reduction in shadowbolt/immolate cast time so for PvE it's probably better, but in PvP you're often being hit too much for that reduction to help much. Just my two cents.
---
Its to trigger people, seems like it worked
---
Depression room for sure!
---
Look at Richie Rich over with his 20 yard living room!
---
you face jaraxus you face jaraxus **Eredar Lord of the Burning Legion... oh wait**
---
Pvp gloves reduce cost of hamstring, then zg necklace later
---
Well, tbh the addon it self was an issue, giving an extremely unfair advantage to anyone using it.
---
If I could have it my way, addons like that would be bannable, simply for giving such a huge advantage. Most people use spy today, to not be at a disadvantage, which is bad by design.
---
It also would be a complete new approach to their addon policy never seen since the release of Vanilla.
---
Especially since it's very easy to just reskin and rename an addon. There's no way to effectively communicate this to all users. Because of that confusion and unclearity of communication it would be a pretty stupid policy.
---
Vanish! And the dots are .... still there... and you're not stealthed.
---
Do you have the same mindset on global warming? Fucking hell..
---
6 seconds and no dos should be more than enough time for the tank to regrab threat.
---
We had our first drop last night as well for one of our priests, and there were a few who offered to help him farm. You should see if any guildies are willing. Maybe pass on drops or something to sweeten the deal. I'm planning to help our priest farm his tonight after work.
---
Ah okay, it wasn't meant to be mean or hurtful, I was just wondering why because I thought people hated Comic Sans - I'm glad to understand it makes it easier for you to read.
---
as a level 32 NE priest traveling around doing quests with my 31 warlock/warrior (he has 2 this level) buddy. we do fairly well in most small pvp skirmishes we've encountered but have been unable to figure out the best defense against a mage who can get polymorph off on me quick. maybe at our level we just don't have the abilities to defend that but if there is something obvious we are missing i'd appreciate some tips! thank you
---
Looks like he's about to click on Evasion in the end as well. A true vanilla experience clicker
---
Lorewise everyone can speak common perfectly right? Can't recall a scenario where one NPC couldn't talk to the other. Be it humans, orcs, undead, naga, demons, titans, Old Gods, dragons and so on.
---
Please for the love of god ignore every other comment except this one. Those other people are giving you false info. This one is the correct one.
---
Ah,  yeah that makes sense. A lot of people that never played classic till now surprisingly came to the conclusion that traveling and physically migrating from place to place to do things and interacting naturally with people brought a lot of charm to the world. IMO it can really bring you into the world and make the game more about being in the world than anything else.
---
I played up until wrath when a lot of the normalization for dungeons and bgs really paved the way into further xpacs(I came back for legion but only did the main pve content then quit a month into playing). I understand why a lot of it was done and I’m not gonna argue that it’s not kinda nice, convenient, and efficient to getting into that content. But once I was able to just fly fast over literally any part of the world and queue in Dalaran to join and spam whatever dungeon, the game suddenly became super trivialized and lost the charm it used to have. The world itself didn’t hold as much weight and everything became like a chore.
---
It would make it better for Alliance because horde queues are so much faster.
---
Also BGs will help because there is a rep grind in each BG that give gear. So why grind just world pvp honor when you can grind honor and rep in a BG.
---
The mage raid rotation is the same as the lock rotation, they just spam frost bolt and occasionally decurse. Meanwhile locks spam shadow bolt, rarely banish, and put up their assigned curse on the boss.
---
[When you thought you were invisible but still get seen](http://imgur.com/gallery/habJT)
---
everything everyone else said, but also the fact that you can only kill these bosses once a week, and they probably won't drop the same piece next week, whereas if you lose a roll in a dungeon you can hop into a new group and run it over and over again until you get your loot

I'm frankly surprised they could hold themselves from bukkake'ing you for that long

Not a threat reduction. Its a complete threat wipe. Melee don't need to eat knock backs to reduce threat.
---
BIG FUCKING socks.
---
Wow lotta people salty about their crutch being nerfd.
---
Sadly, its garbage. I'd honestly be surprised if you got more than 2 gold for it.
---
Kudos for the info my man.
---
That's nothing to do with the pot though, and more to do with you not casting anything for 6 seconds.  Also you have to hit more than 150% agro (or is it 130%? I'm a healer I cant remember) as ranged dps to overagro.  So if you use a LIP she will immediately not target u and go for the 2nd person on the threat list - if this means she walks out of melee range with you then even though your agro is still high you may no longer be above the 150% threshold to pull agro from the 2nd person now.
---
But just to confirm, LIP, BoP, Bubble or IB does nothing to your threat, it just makes her not hit you as you're invulnerable.
---
Man, you just doused him with gazzoline and set him on fire.
---
Brillant.
---
lol jelly?  They literally did this 5v1 and trolled a leveling 58 mage, jelly is the furthest thing I am, this is pathetic behavior plain and simple.
---
If they bug out the los and stuff, can’t you report them?
---
Why should 1 person not get loot because they rolled in the single digits 5 times in a row? Why should someone get loot 5 times in a row just because they rolled 90+ 5 times in a row?
---
It's good for small sample sizes like 1 raid, because it pretty randomly allocates loot. But in a progressive system where the same people are grouping each week, there are more fair ways to make sure everyone gets loot at a pretty even rate since they're all putting in the same work.
---
I refuse to use it.
---
I think the only people that will be deathballing the high lvl zones will be the ones that are seriously trying to get the high ranks. Nobody did it before, which tells me that the majority of the people doing now aren't doing it for fun. When they realize that they can get way more honor per hour from BGs, and tryharding in between will net them very little extra, they will stop doing it so much. It'll still happen, especially at places like BRM, but it won't be the shitshow it is now I don't think. At least not after a couple weeks of BGs.
---
I mean im no expert so wtf do I know but it didnt feel burst really except when WF procs. But youre also in melee combat the whole time so you take a lot of damage.
---
I know you can totem kite but honestly that made fights take forever so I Wasnt a giant fan of that either. Other than the fun ness of a WF proc Ele feels so much more consistent high dmg output and I dont get touched as much. 
---
dat mana though
---
Assuming this is correct, and I believe it is because I know from personal experience Details! will give you estimated threat, which I assume is from combat log, if other people aren't running it and way more accurate threat when people are running it...then how does this really break Spy?   All the Spy authors have to do is use that API to have Spy communicate with other Spy users and while the functionality won't be exactly like it was before, it'll be pretty close.
---
Even the NPCs are using Spy now.
---
Oh It does, a lot, and looks like it did for sure. I’m just saying if I was a gnome I would expect that kinda stuff.
---
horde definitely using the 8v1 strat.
---
Well the point... [the point is](https://youtu.be/t0jgZKV4N_A?t=384) you can play Hide &amp; Seek in there.
---
For raiding? I only taught mine LB to put more points into its survivability.   There's only a few mobs/bosses that you can safely send him into melee range.   I just use a macro that casts bith aimed shot and lightning breath and have constantly been on top of the meters.
---
It’s sad that there’s so much hate for rogues and no respect for the class. The hate for the class has led people to endorse spy even though it borderline breaks the rogue class.
---
Warlocks have insane solo potential (mobs can be infinitely feared for full duration in classic) and are really useful in 5 mans, raids, group pvp, and solo pvp. They might not be top damage but they hold their own and also have incredible utility and control potential in PvP. Fear is probably the best CC in classic pvp.
---
Dinged 60, first MC raid won Eye of Divinity (Bendeiction staff, BiS for priest almost throughout vanilla) plus 3 Tier 1 pieces. 
---
Got extremely luck with having only 2 more priests in the raid, one already geared to the teeth and one extremely unlucky with drops. I ended up passing the third T1 piece as I felt bad for him. Good times!
---
i got 24 hour banned yesterday for naming my rogue “Elusiveshiit” :(
---
Technically shadowburn on cd is a dps increase. So if you want to go crazy and farm 80+ shards you can see a dps increase. Warlocks also scale better than mages in naxx gear due to improved shadowbolt debuff allowing shadowbolt to scale more with +damage. Each class's rotation seems simple but if you take the game seriously and min/max there's always little nuance you can do to improve performance.
---
Ignoring terrain and buildings and so on, sure.
---
parkour master  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2kJZOfq7zk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2kJZOfq7zk)  reminds me of this
---
Grob mob!
---
I already have a mage, but just curious how the play style is for lock. From what I gather it is almost the same mechanic wise in combat, but the more out of combat flavor sets it apart.
---
Yeah, as a mage you probably don't even need talents to level viably. Now, optimally, however...
---
Rogue here. I use spy because I have to. If they totally removed it tomorrow I'd be super happy.
---
While I agree, I'm also switching from NE male to Human female for the +Swords.  I fucking *hate* the Glancing Blow mechanic and in general Humans have really nice racials (Diplomacy for BG Rep grinds for example).
---
I went out to ungoro to farm my devilsaur legs pattern off the slimes, it dropped on my first kill :D
---
How? Aren't stealthed players unable to be targeted? Unless the addon could detect a millisecond where they may become visible due to natural detection and immediately attack them
---
yuppers.
---
Against tos and will get you banned in a heartbeat
---
I played on PvP servers for the entirety of vanilla.  This shit is nothing like anything we ever saw.  It's not a matter of not wanting to PvP.  It's a matter of literally not be able to go from Point A to Point B without coming across multiple roving gank squads.
---
When the honor system hit in Vanilla, we didn't have 15 years of game knowledge.  We didn't have this percent of the player base at 60.  And we didn't have these many players on our servers.  This shit isn't PvP.  It's basically TM/SS spread over the entire fucking world.
---
You're basically dumb as shit.  What's going on right now is unprecedented, and it's why Blizzard has accelerated the release of BGs.  The servers can't sustain this shit because the player counts are way too high.
---
Right now fights are so short that the mana is not an issue. (Shadow Priest here)
---
I think the best example I have is a frost nova + flame strike + cone of cold combo. 
---
Without spell batching, the flame strike would crit on all the frozen targets but instantly drop the +crit modifier from being frozen, so cone of cold wouldn’t crit. 
---
With spell batching, you can queue up the flame strike + cone of cold so that they BOTH crit. The spells get sent to the server in the same “batch”.
---
I think you're severely overestimating how long these queues will be. Even if it's a 10 min queue for horde, WPvP will be mostly dead and also it's not that big of a deal for horde to be "severely hamstrung" by. It's actually kind of nice for rankers to have forced breaks that everyone has to deal with
---
I'm looking forward to instance alliance AV queues. And I'm really looking forward to bored horde sitting in queues for hours every day doing jack shit.
---
The world pvp will die off once all of the people that hit rank 3 this week, realize 2-3 weeks from now that they're only rank 5 and this grind is actually going to be a huge pain in the ass, and not worth it. Right now everyone thinks they're going to hit rank 14, just like every raider doing 200dps in their 2 night MC wipefests thinks that they're going to be a Naxx raider one day and kill KT. Reality catches up to these people sooner or later and they give up. 
---
In actual vanilla I started late, so I though I could get Field Marshall to bridge the gear gap and get into an AQ40 guild and then Naxx. 2-3 months into this plan I was rank 7 and realized how much of an ignorant noob I actually was and gave up. Unlike irl, in Azeroth, the trash eventually takes itself out.
---
This is the method we use. Works great. Sometimes you might lose a warlock, but they aren't important so who cares.
---
I picked it up out of necessity. I am delighted with the change that nerfed it.
---
Yes, each class trinket remvoes different forms of cc.
---
Games nowadays have conditioned us to think "must get to end game and clear content immediately," but Classic WoW is from a different era. I mean, yeah, the players have changed and most of them think this way now, which does put a damper on things, but you can still enjoy the game at your own pace.
---
If you enjoy roleplaying, may I suggest an RP or RP-PVP realm. Players on there are typically less rush oriented and take their time and enjoy the world around them in ways that don't require huge amounts of time. Roleplaying can also be a lot of fun!
---
Yeah I'm pretty sure my Mac mini during BC could handle the draw distance.
---
Yeah it's crazy. Hard to compete when a guild literally has entire raid groups logged out on the boss spawn point in shifts.
---
Yeah thats true. Thank you for explaining mate :)
---
Just FYI if the fight is shorter than 90sec, Rum Tum Tuber Surprise gives more total mana than Nightfin Soup.
---
Anyone know some good dungeon farms for druids? I used to do solo princess/goblin and mining farm, but one of the recent patches made princess much harder to kite using the rock strategy.
---
All the crybabies are getting heard of from Blizzard.
---
you're*
---
&gt; Also a Druid (aquatic form) or shammy or undead
---
Doesn't the horde have have warlocks?
---
Yes and make customizable inhouse solutions instead. Other mmos got buildin dmg meters and customizable ui. Or only make it available in instances.
---
Why have addons that are mandatory because of how much of an advantage it gives.
---
I won mana igniting chord with a 97 in a pug mc in September. A few weeks later I won a sash of mercy in Strat UD and was able to sell it. Yeah I’m a holy pally.
---
Is it bad that I want to click all 3 of those posts?
---
Never noticed until now... It would seem so?
---
The squeaky wheel gets the grease
---
Crybaby casuals will always get their way
---
Well, its partly because of miss-tuning on the pserver part and that you have 1.12.1 itemization which is significantly more optimized than 1.7.
---
But we will see when BWL is released, its a much more difficult raid than MC and Ony, so hopefully will find it more intriguing.
---
It’s stat weights.  If you are aiming for certain stats in your build,  you can set a higher value to that stat.  Certain classes are straight forward but say you’re doing a HotW/NS build.  Do you favor tank stats or caster stats.  It can help you find items that better fit your build.
---
I dunno much about Faerlina, but Herod has a long login queue(30-60 mins minimum most of the day), is Horde heavy, and is home to a large number of Multiboxers on that side, which might be a pro or con depending on you.
---
Two resources to get a good idea of relative server balance and size below; keep in mind these are not 100% accurate, but they're the most accurate thing we have:

---
So, why are these mobs aggro'ing on you, but not the others?  Almost sounds like a bug.  A bug you are using to your advantage.  What do we call that again?  Ohh right, exploit....
---
congrats you fcking cry babies. now youve ruined damage and threat meters. fucking casuals crying about every little thing are ruining this game.
---
 #nochanges
---
Yep range got changed to 50 yard maximum
---
He could be in a raid group like mine, where we've had 2 Eskhander's Right Claw's drop, and 0 brut blades, 0 viskags, 0 deathbringers.
---
Damn I would love to play an Undead pali!
---
They can, as there's a member of the Argent Dawn that is undead at Light's Hope Chapel. I think that undead who can still wield the light are *incredibly* rare lore-wise, though, and that the reason player characters can be priests but not paladins is that priests have a shadow tree and paladins don't. Blizzard wanted at least 2 horde races to have access to "the" healing class, and lore-wise, most undead priests are expected to be shadow.
---
Are rogues screwed then? Bc now spy is going to be like there is a rogue within striking distance of you...
---
They shortened combat log read/broadcast distance. Effectively nerfed Spy.
---
I don't get why people don't search for "tank/dps" when they have someone who can fill either role.
---
That's spell batching for you...
---
&gt; When the honor system hit in Vanilla, we didn't have 15 years of game knowledge. We didn't have this percent of the player base at 60. And we didn't have these many players on our servers
---
but you knew all of this would be the case when you installed classic wow, no?
---
either way it's not a bad idea to use the pot while moving to the tanking position during the 6 seconds so if you do get aggro again she will not be facing the other dps/healers
---
This is exactly why I downloaded it.
---
LOSsing doesn'T help. The only way not to receive a buff is to stand pretty far away.
---
Also no point in doing this, if you buff normal might afterwards. You can always overwrite a greater blessing with a different normal blessing.
---
That's spell batching for you.
---
Broken tooth as a hunter without hardcore camping. Just pvp and questing in the zone. 
---
Funny part is that I've always been seeing hunters from both sides camping for him, and 2 minutes before I tamed him 2 hunters at this spot had a bloody fight and the winner from my side went to check other spot. Broken tooth just spawned after he went away, seconds I say, seconds :P
---
I didn't realize how "rare" orbs were. My first run we had 6 or 7 drop and I thought that was the norm. I don't think i've seen more than 1-2 since.
---
A 150 yard scan was not a thing in Vanilla. Classic tries to replicate Vanilla. So this change was good.  Also stop whining about people whining.
---
I'm a paly. That's why I want the sword. Full Tier set with this weapon is going to be nutty.
---
The problem is warriors also want it cause there is a "snapshotting" bug in the game which means they can have their full DPS set and still get 800+ healing/5seconds. This shit should be fixed
---
Dont be a dick. This is a useful tip.
---
There is not a single Blizzard game that "sucks". CMV.
---
My Sawbones shirt from Scholo. Have it from original vanilla and wanted it again for classic. Though I was lucky enough to snag it on my 3rd run.
---
Bennidiction is fairly ballanced atm, alliance side needs a little bit of loving though.
---
I won Savage Gladiator Chain on my third arena run. I've ran arena 92 times and have yet to see it drop again. I then got HoJ two days later.
---
Nope, that's not why twinking exists.  That's a minigame you've decided to try and perpetuate, but it's not why twinking is a thing in wow, or wow's dad (everquest)
---
One of the best parts of being a druid is prowl and instant travel form. They are worthless with Spy.
---
Username checks out, I guess?
---
Yeah, I got the first cloak. I'm prot now, but I have the gear to go furyprot once threat starts to become an issue, and our top hunter got the second cloak.
---
Only $19.99 i'm guessing.
---
I think you’re referring to the system that Blizzard uses to create combat logs for uploading to sites like Warcraft Logs. 
---
This is different, as it writes messages directly to a text file in your WoW folder. There’s no way for an addon to capture this output. 
---
Dynamic systems within raids like dmg and threat systems will most certainly be impacted.
---
&gt;until recently have found a lot of enjoyment in this sub
---
Did this correspond with your lobotomy?
---
Im not saying people should get banned for using, im saying the addon should be banned
---
look here Alex Thurman, I don't tell you how to live your life ok?
---
Were there any big nerfs to BWL from the BWL patch to 1.12 ?
---
Um, dunno what server your on, but a lot of people on my server craft stuff for free. People normally tip them for doing it. Its the guys who ask for fees on my server who get ignored and get no business. While those crafting for free get insane amount of tips. And by insane. I mean there is people who stop gold farming just cause they make more money in tips while spamming "Free Raid Enchants with your mats!"
---
There was a lot less activity than the start, in those weeks leading up to P2 too. There wasn’t much left to do but raid and farm.
---
I apologize that we aren't APES bud.
---
But he already has a brutality blade it seems.
---
No.  And you know the answer is No.  Fuck off with the trolling.  We didn't know what the server capacity would be.  We didn't know the precise timeline for release of things.
---
How pathetic do you have to be to just come here to troll about shit when you already full well know the answer?
---
Yep.  I play warrior and my wife plays pally.  I main as a tank and she mains as a healer, but when we're putting together pug groups (rare, we usually only do guild runs), we just look for 3 people any role.  When you say "LF3M XYZ any role /w" you'd be shocked at how fast groups fill up :P
---
Correct, people just care about seeing their honor numbers increase, they aren't even really playing a game.
---
of 2024
---
But it's hilariously wrong when it has to fallback to doing that. For example, if the tank doesn't have it, then it doesn't know what stance the tank is in. If I don't have it (frost mage), it doesn't know that I get -15% threat from talents, so it will think I'm going to pull aggro when I'm not even close. I don't think it even tracks buffs (like blessing of salv) fully.
---
It's almost entirely reliant on everyone having it. Which is exactly how it was in vanilla too - I remember everyone in our raid needing KTM (or maybe that was BC? pretty certain I had it in vanilla though).
---
Classic only really uses 1 core. Just get the fastest (per-core) quad- or hexa-core CPU you can reasonably afford. Add in an RX 580 8 GB and 2x4GB RAM and you're more than set.
---
Being Alliance on Herod is the worst thing you could ever do
---
We used to LOS back in vanilla to give diff buffs. Must be diff now but back then if the recipient was out of LOS of the caster he wouldn't receive the blessing or overwrite his existing blessing
---
Imagine being a scrub and thinking you've made a clever point?
---
The enchant is only +2. It is currently impossible for alliance to hit the cap.
---
The rare spawned in RFK, he dropped the staff, I won it
---
Take that all you Corpsemaker farmers!
---
Nice what are the mats
---
It does. It starts with the main tank and then goes down the aggro list.
---
Oh I feel ya on the monitor game. Went with a 34 ultrawide IPS and I've never been happier. My only issue is with some games not supporting ultrawide and having to mess with config files to make it work...sometimes
---
Vael.  Rolled a warrior this time, and execute spam sounds like so much fun.
---
NO CHANGES
---
It's a 4% drop actually, but okay.
---
Bump
---
ITT "It'S nOt ImPoSsIbLe, ackchyually it's super easy". I had no idea there were so many developers on these forums who had intimate knowledge of Blizzard's code, that's amazing. I'm not even defending Spy, I hate that it exists, but it's pretty silly to pretend like it's such an easy, obvious fix that somehow Blizzard is too incompetent to implement.
---
Wtf are you talking about? Do you just reply with this casuals ruin this crap on every thread?
---
Spy addons has no business being in the game.
---
Question: If spy had a setting which made it impossible to detect players without spy, would you still use it? and if so, would you enable that feature?
---
I'm gonna say that 99% would still use it, and they would definitely not enable that option.
---
So how much "necessity" is really involved?
---
Got Pristine Hide of the Beast for 200g
---
Slaghide Gauntlets of the Monkey dropped in under 10 Urok kills
---
Left my piece of shit guild to support a friend who was Gkicked and we immediately became 2 of the core 3 tanks for an up and coming guild that's now rapidly becoming one of the best guilds on our server, incidentally loaded with friends I made while leveling. This is probably the biggest one for me. The social aspect of wow is why I play, and being in a guild like this was a game changer
---
It’s a starts with the elite quest Dragonkin menace then some RP talking into BRD which can be done in one run, but more realistically 3 or so runs and ends in a full UBRS run.  And a bunch more RP talk and running in between.
---
I guess the NPCs have spy too
---
Think the amd is better than the Nvidia?
---
Nope, having better stuff is the consolation prize for having to play the inferior faction.
---
This is the real answer. P3 Ony behavior is a result if P2 threat. 
---
For the most part.
---
1 Metal, 1 Chemical
---
thing is that the fireball in p2 reset threat from whoever is hit (from the top the threat table) so you don't want both tanks close to the top cause you risk getting reset on both tanks. Both tanks getting reset is usually what causes the most issues in my experience.
---
Yes but easily discovered and in addition it is not done by a council. Every player can abuse all kinds of things. The problem is largest when the leadership starts to favour special players etc. That abuse is most felt.
---
Yeah, I gave up on the SGC after 50 runs (totally scrub numbers). Not because I expected it to drop by then, but because I saw a post on here about somebody getting their SGC after their 670th some odd run.
---
I decided I didn't need it that bad, but I'm starting to reconsider that opinion as my raid group's dps gear up.
---
There are so many pugs running durning weekends for MC/Ony. I'm a weekend player as well, don't have time during the week and I've pugged all my raids so far. currently sitting at 4 tier 1 pieces and my t2 helm so you can do the same.
---
I am looking for pvp servers :)
---
1. Depends how long queues are. Horde-heavy PvP servers will be in the same battlegroups as Alliance-heavy PvE servers, so Battlegroup faction balance will not be as bad as server faction balance.
---
2. You still need to queue at a battlemaster, so the travel time plus BG time means there will b substantially fewer people out ganking at any one time, and zones further away from Horde cities will be far quieter than those within quick reach.
---
I found a guild with good people.
---
Sulfuras
---
Priest isn’t a bad option. Great heals and good for pvp damage kinda like elemental or enhance. I’ll keep that in mind!
---
I'm a warrior. Got Runeblade of Baron Rivendare (0.1% drop rate at least - if only it was the mount instead), then two days later I won a roll for Foror's Compendium. Just a few days ago we had Cloudkeeper Legplates drop in MC, which I won with DKP.
---
Shhhh don't tell anyone...
---
To follow up on this we (indecision left)and we are loving it to be honest.   
---
From a personal standpoint I got 7 rich thorium veins yesterday. more than the last 3 weeks total in the open world. I am finally able to dream getting blacksmithing to 300. I noticed my guild was able to find black lotus without making a raid to secure one. the population on the new realm is still new so if you like me are a 60 with minimal raiding gear and what not there are plenty of opportunities to gear up. Got a UBRS group and we ran 3 jed runs and didn't get ganked once on the run there and the 2 resets.   
---
I know I should have seen the PVP situation in advance but nothing prepared me for the 11 deaths from TP to BRD. I had to log off and give up on dungeons several times in the last week on Blaumeax) Groups kicked me for taking to long to get to the entrance. MC raids just give up because they can't get their group. I thought I was a pvper so i rolled PVP.
---
 I am not.
---
 I am a PVE player that loves the occasional PVP battle in the open world over a mining resource or something. I am excited to actually get crafting materials. Do more world bosses even though indecision downed them on blaumeaux already. Future content considered as well.
---
The people on arcanite seem pretty new and fresh. So there are a lot of opportunities to find groups even though the population is "medium". I see it as a chance as helping people gear up and level so we have more people to do dungeons with and what not. 
---
since honor I considered stopping until BG's. then I realised the horde on the realm are just dicks. Or maybe starved hyenas trying to find kills. Either way, am loving wow again.
---
Can you be in a group of 5 and queue for wsg/ av as the leader and no one else has to be in city? I forget how it works. Or you think the queues will be long enough to queue up and fly somewhere yourself?
---
I will say that it is a lot of fun when you are trying to get to BRM and 5 alliance are trying to snipe you. As a lock I’ve had several times where I was able to fear ppl and kite long enough for A horde 5 man to show up and it’s led to some fun encounters of PVP.
---
Those bots are better scripted than an auto hot key clicker, they are created to not be detected by blizzards anti bot warden.
---
Can tell the people that didn't have this sound seared into their brain from 15 years ago huh :D

You’r triggered

Hi Sam
---
A GTX 1650 is a very capable and affordable graphics card that will handle classic flawlessly. 
---
Your processor doesn't need to be amazing but you will benefit from being able to maintain clock speeds. Classic still doesn't utilize multiple cores like crazy so a quad core is plenty. You want your computer to be able to handle the processor running at its high clock speeds though. Macs and laptops often don't have the capability to cool the processor in sustained use so while the processor may be able to run at say 3.6ghz it will only do that for a few secs before slowing down and it's continuous state may only be like 2.5ghz. Most PC desktops don't have an issue with this, it's nearly always compact design computers so if you want a laptop then look for a gaming one because that has the cooling to keep it running.
---
I'd advise looking at AMD Ryzen for a processor, they are great bang for the buck, especially the Ryzen 5 2600 for desktops.
---
Also to note, the world as in the game scenery is what tasks the graphics more and player characters is what taxes the processor more. Since Classic's graphics are pretty simple it doesn't take much for the graphics to keep up, however you get a bunch of characters on screen and your processor still has a big job to do.
---
So you really want to be part of the mongoloids mob spamming these lines?
---
"What other.... :O"
---
Bartender4, Shadowed Unit Frames, Sexy Map, ItemRack,
---
Except it’s a video game and your abusing in game mechanics
---
I dunno today I killed a 57 farming in felwood and his mob (at 5%)dropped a water and I sold it.
---
Thanks a lot! Definitely gonna try to do that. Althought keybinding is always an issue :/
---
Oh, no? I've played since launch, alliance since wotlk, and am playing horde in classic now. Believe me, alliance is just as shit.
---
Thank you for such a detailed response! Yeah, I am beginning to feel the effects of P2 and that's probably why I didn't reroll yet — that and me being so behind my friends already. I think switching classes could help, but can I also see how getting camped makes me wanna ragequit already :D
---
Here's what would happen if I ever encountered you IRL:
---
1) my FOOT in your FACE
---
2) my FIST in your FACE
---
3) my mom makes me walk over to your house to apologize
---
Dont speak to me or my touchy priest again
---
amazing
---
Whichwaydo you're totally right but this is a reoccurring thing in almost every PvP game and especially in online gaming. Unfortunately most people are just asshole's by nature. The servers will die off eventually. The chads will complain about dead servers and eventually hop to a different game where the same circle will continue. C'est la vie...
---
Same thing happened to me!
---
I also won a roll for Foror's Compendium two days later.
---
I got a BRE on a roll against 10 warriors on my 1st rag kill with my guild. (The week before we started useing EpGp)
---
Uhm yea they do. I killed a 51 yesterday and got 116 honor. That’s insane.
---
Does this fix have any influence on PvE? For example: UBRS Jed scan at the entrance of the dungeon - If you use a macro /tar Jed Runewatcher, youre able to get him into your target at a specific point near the entrance of the dungeon, that doesnt require you to clear all mobs in the path between entering and Jeds location.
---
Ever since this fix happened, i couldnt find a Jed-ID whatsover and im worried its not just bad luck but patched out of the game by these Combatlog changes?? Does someone know?
---
I swear eviscerate has 100% crit chance
---
Yeah,  since they don't need to get into melee range to attack.   Their lightning breath ignores armor, but has a chance to be resisted.   They provide far better personal dps than furious howls flat 50 dmg.  Yeah you can buff melee if you stand 15 yrds from them, but then you can't avoid certain bosses curses line you can by standing max range.   You can send in a wolf to buff melee but then you lose the buff and would need precise pet control.   So depends on how much you want to min/max raid dps.  I like the simple route of aimed shot/ lightning breath macro.
---
Lol your unpopular opinion is the single most voiced opinion on this week since phase2 launched, agree with you though
---
Well,classic actually took off during WoD because that game was fucking dogshit, and a lot of people like me don't play for the nostalgia.
---
we play because we think classic the better game, period.
---
And there is no fucking way blizzard would have put classic servers without the huge success of the private servers eating at their market (Nost had over 800k registered accounts, and huge active playernumbers). And without the exceptional management of those servers they wouldn't have gotten that popular either.
---
You can believe what you want, but blizzard had shown no interest in hosting classic servers before Nost went off.
---
Sometimes it's fun and sometimes it's not fun. If you can't handle the unfun times, you propably shouldn't roll on a pvp server.
---
I use it for lvling, plan to turn it off when I hit 60.
---
no
---
Your username is burnbookss do you find enjoyment in burning books?
---
If the best support for an addon is to point out other problems with classic then the addon should probably be removed.
---
That is some incredible dedication but I have to question your sanity. Spirit of aquementas is only 7 spell power less and takes an hour to get.
---
Gz on the loot though!
---
I do have that in mind but somehow I don't want to play an DMG class in every game and thus I would like to try more tank/dmg class this time :) Been thinking a bit about healer even but not sure yet.
---
This isn't new, this was a comment here like 1-2 days ago lol. About how he would channel hearthstone till 9 seconds then pop invis potion.
---
You get fireballed every chance you Get. I was top damage last night in ony, top threat all night also. She never attacks me
---
Engage with Ambush or Backstab. If you pull aggro immediately you're not giving your tank enough time.
---
Just play an hour a day instead of 10h on the weekend.
---
If that's the case — that's very cool! I've been looking at guides and druids are always described as 'versatile' which is cool but also insanely overwhelming. Being able to focus on one role and slowly learn another sounds a lot better.
---
I wasn’t “making it personal”, but you are. You’re the one with the elitist attitude; saying addons are crutches or training wheel when they’re neither of those things. Neither essential nor frivolous. You’re just trying to make me sound unreasonable because your position is the weaker one. 
---
Don’t use addons. I couldn’t give a shit. The rest of us that do aren’t inferior players for making our game more efficient. It doesn’t make you better than everyone else because you chose to work harder rather than smarter.
---
Probably hunter or mage stand in the back of a 40m raid for 17 hours a day
---
Well, to give an example: 
---
Felcloth dropped fairly quickly on my server from ~3.5g to ~2.1g with Dire Maul coming out.  Prior to DM, felcloth was from world spawn drops (ex. Jade** in Felwood), which are limited on spawn rate, limiting total supply.  Max supply was basically (24*7*number of spawns*spawnrate*number of layers). With DM being an instance it basically uncaps the supply side and spawn rate no longer matters, and you don't have to compete with same or opposing faction over those spawns.  Also, people are running DM for other things and not just to farm, so you have a lot more people creating felcloth through normal dungeon grinding instead of targeted farming.
---
There's also perhaps a bit of the wave effect.  I don't expect server pop to go up, so the only big demand for felcloth is people leveling alts or to continue to use up their mooncloth CD and stockpile preparing for phase 3 patterns.  There isn't the same steady supply of people leveling their warlocks, mages, etc. that need a few dozen felcloth for BIS tailor patterns. 
---
I imagine you could write a book on the economics in WoW, but that will give you an idea of what goes on.  If you think hard enough about new content, look at loot tables, and understand how people play certain content you can make reasonable guesses as to how that will impact the economy.
---
lol so you kicked some guy after he waited 40 mins for you to get to the instance?  Did you wait another 30 mins to find a replacement?
---
We don’t do this. We let our offtank sit low on threat and after fireballs, he’s usually easily able to pick up
---
here's a trick that has worked for me so far: don't log back in. Blizzard will see player numbers go down and do something to prevent it. That's why we get BGs early now.
---
It does if they are hemo, they pop cold blood and evidently, then prep and repeat. Two guaranteed frits right there.
---
It trackers only work on targets that are actually rendered  for you, so their range is highly variable and dependent on server load.
---
Okay. That's help a lot :) I will decide more on the visual then :)
---
Stitchings know when you want them I swear used to see 3 a run when I was making mine in classic I had 3 dry runs.
---
&gt;You still need to queue at a battlemaster, so the travel time plus BG time means there will be substantially fewer people out ganking at any one time, and zones further away from Horde cities will be far quieter than those within quick reach.
---
Yes, but you can still queue from any city so you can always fly to wherever you want to fight. For instance Horde quing in UC, and then flying off to Eastern plaguelands to PvP.
---
I am pretty queue times will be pretty long for horde, and that alliance will still have to suffer as a consequence.
---
There will be a lot of premade queing as 10 people, which may or may not have longer queue time depending on if Blizz will have them in the normal pool, or if there will be a premade pool (which was not a feature in classic).
---
You want to see Videos where ppl click potions? K. :)
---
Thank god for the red circles, wouldn't have noticed this otherwise.
---
I made a helpful [picture](https://imgur.com/a/jpfxBFm) since you seem to be confused.
---
Can we make a megathread for all of these Spy threads? Seems like a new one crops up every couple days
---
My original comment was aimed at correcting people who think spy is some hack that allows players to nullify stealth and other aspects of world pvp.
---
I’ve seen multiple idiots saying Spy does something so ridiculous as to pull information from the combat log.
---
People blame the addon and users without understanding how it works and why it works and this was my feudal attempt to help people understand.
---
Definitely will do since I am gonna be a fresh in tanks (barely touched it in FFXIV or AuraKingdom). Thank you
---
4. None of the above.
---
I'd think that'd be true of many characters, but maybe not so much orc grunt#567.  Hell lorewise I'd expect tauren and UD to not generally know orcish and NE to not generally know common.
---
There is a very noticeable difference in speed. I didn't buy it right at 40 and didn't specifically farm for it, but bought it as soon as I had the gold required.
---
Shame they went up in price so much!! 
---
I’ll check it out and give it a try sometime. For sure. Do you pull him back to the railing spot in this video?
---
I call Orb of Deception. If you were actually Undead you couldn't understand the NPC, you'd see [Common] instead.
---
any recommendations? I am not familiar with servers and their situations :(
---
He might be talkin about the turtles. I have been killing turtles from levels 48-51 soon 52. Turtles range from 48-50. Where the quest to find the guys treasure once you collect all 3 map pieces. No elite giants in that spot, but if a horde does go there and kill you the walk isn't fun but I haven't encountered many.. Not a whole lot of people there when I was doing it but then last night I logged on and saw 2 hunters and a warlock that looked like bots, no emotes or attack back. But if you swim upwards away from that area there are plenty of turtles 48-50 just south of the pirate ship area only downfall is the elite giants you gotta avoid (or kill for double xp or whatever). 
---
If you have skinning it helps for GPH.
---
I already suggested this to another person in the comments below, but I think it might help you as well: 
---
Try swapping tank and melee positions. This way your rogue will always land on the elevated ledge and barely take any fall dmg. Might have your feral OT just dps and stay in the melee camp though (and make sure he doesnt shapeshift).
---
I know I got that as soon as I dinged 60. I wanted to optimize some gear the game didn't want it. My sanity was lost half way through so I just needed to see it drop to regain it lol
---
Lul only +20
---
Well since fury warriors are the best DPS in the game and you bring along a few tanks, there are almost certainly more warriors than any other class in a typical raid.
---
Any raid with less than 7 is definitely bringing too few.
---
But even with just 7 warriors, there aren't enough BREs and Reapers to go around, so a Sulf might as well goto a warrior.
---
Enhancement is useless at everything, so just a total waste of gold on a shaman.
---
Try a week of each, then continue the one you liked the best.
---
Nothing will transfer from one game to the other - keep that in mind. They are separate games running on separate servers.
---
I have tried an undead rogue in Draenor and I remember it being fun when I tried to roleplay in PvE lol. Idk how long is that gonna last though, is rogue enjoyable to level?
---
Meanwhile I got my second epic mount
---
I didn't know you stared at a wall the entire time you play lol
---
Yes, I am 99% sure it worked like that.
---
Please report that maniac to the authorities immediately
---
My enchanting and tailoring are nearing 200. I’m level 35. 
---
At what point can I start making decent gold so that I can buy a mount?
---
This is my first time taking professions seriously and first time playing classic, sorry if this is a dumb question
---
You planning on alliance or horde?
---
I have a 2500u with Vega 8 laptop and it runs well but not fantastic. You can keep 30+ fps on graphics 3-4 pretty easily. If your laptop has good cooling and you look into adjusting your Ryzen power with a program like ryzenadj then you can get it to be 50+ fps.
---
So for what it is I think Vega 8 runs very impressively but still remember it's an integrated graphics and can only do so much. Smooth gameplay is possible but great looking and smooth gameplay is often too much to ask.
---
OK. Agree to disagree. 
---
Good talk.
---
Didn’t they just nerf it yesterday? O.o
---
Yeah my 52 warlock alt is in searing gorge right now and I specced SL to finish out my leveling experience just for that reason. with as many people that are constantly going through there usually as long as I can survive longer than 10-15 seconds either another horde group will show up to help me, or some ally will show up to make sure I die. I haven't heard of a hardcore imbalance either way. usually one side controls BRM until an opposite faction raid forms and wipes it out.
---
The Spirit of Aquementas is a-ok after doing this solo run around 50 times.  I'd rather work on an alt or solo dungeons that actually get me a decent amount of gold.
---
I dno if something is wrong with my PC but I only get 30fps in a jam packed Orgrimmar with an i5 4670k @ 4.2ghz and gtx 1660 Ti. 1080p resolution.
---
im playing on Herod so Org has a ridiculousl amount of people but this seems pretty low fps.
---
You have to feel kind of stupid making posts like these right?
---
This is wrong, you can level to 54 there. Level 43 mobs are still green at 53(lowest level of a zombie)
---
you are posting in the classic wow reddit, so expect most answer to be classic.
---
if go post this on the wow reddit, expect most responses to be transmog pics, art work of their character or cosplay of their character.
---
It's due to [this](https://twitter.com/Wowhead/status/1197655095565049857).
---
I have worked my way into being an officer of my guild just so I can get it.
---
Forgot. Sorry. I edited the correction.
---
I'm guessing you had your guild in place waiting? Kaz is not a pug raid boss due to health rejuv mechanics
---
&gt;I am pretty queue times will be pretty long for horde, and that alliance will still have to suffer as a consequence.
---
PvE realms tend to favour Alliance so it all depends on Battlegroup faction balance rather than just server balance.
---
FYI, there's a huge XP penalty for being in a raid.
---
so this is like "they came for the jews but what did they do for me" almost ... wow
---
Pvp servers stopped being fun, for me, when I no longer had the free time to play at of hours (to avoid the gank parties in WoD).
---
I was under delusion that Classic's PVP would be different. ... Seems others weren't so.....'foresighted'.
---
Unfortunately, Enchanting and Tailoring wont make you much gold.  They are more useful for endgame when you can disenchant BOPs for mats and tailoring for your BiS robe.  I'd recommend not spending gold on them for a little bit, until you get your mount then resume leveling them.
---
There are these secret spots right around your level. There are only ever 4 other allied players there with you at any time. The other faction cant follow you.
---
They're called dungeons. Use them.
---
I’m not at my computer but I’ll check thank thank you!
---
Thanks for the input. Gonna try to lvl my first shaman!!
---
How should a horde DKP guild handle weapons for rogues and fury warriors? The warriors aren’t looking for any armor and are wearing all leather blues and will only spend dkp on weapons and they all seem to want swords.
---
Now I can’t bid on any armor or I won’t ever have enough dkp to win a weapon from them.
---
Did you even read the comment i replied to?
---
I thought that's how it worked. Unless it would show that someone went onto stealth previously
---
It also depends if people on these PvE servers are interested in PVP at all.
---
I know you can get some BIS pieces from high rank (like 7-9) for PvE. But I would assume PvE server players aren't that into it.
---
Do you get fun out of completing quests or out of the quests themselves?
---
i disagree you can't teach people anything. he probably found another group shortly after and you earned yourself a permanent kick spot. best not to mess with people.
---
&gt; You can believe what you want, but blizzard had shown no interest in hosting classic servers before Nost went off.
---
correlation causation
---
This is why dumb people cannot predict future events; they don't understand current and past events.
---
That's why you can say crazy shit like "they should have ended layering week one" or "launch the game with pvp ranking" and that shit makes sense in your head.    You cannot look just a couple steps ahead and see how fucked that would be.
---
It's not on the twitch app. You'll have to download it from another website and install it yourself.
---
You are free to your own opinions. I don't trust this diablo game to be any different than d3.
---
Nah, I got it at... 42 or 43 I think. Didn't quite have the gold until then, and I didn't really wanna farm when travel form was good enough.
---
Seems as though some people didn't read my message or are looking for a handout.  I'm not looking to share anything publicly until we have a good working theory on whether or not the spawn timers used in vanilla are the same in wow classic.   If you'd like access to our spawn and kill times as well as server reset timers, you have to share your data as well.   There is no free lunch.
---
This is my first Hunter. So far I havent run out of arrows or forgotten to turn off Growl in dungeons 🙃
---
The best advice Would be to Not Start playing classic. :D
---
@OP :  depending on your spare time,  Group pvp might be odd when you reach 60, since battlegrounds will be released in a couple of weeks.  Mind a "first wow, first Classic wow leveling duration" to be a Minimum of 10 days Ingame play time.
---
I can see how one can enjoy them, but I am starting to agree.
---
Won Orb of Deception and the Greater Fire Protection Potion recipe in the **same** LBRS run.
---
Bullshit. I've done it at level 44 with blizzard. Cone method is a lot slower, but has less stringent mana requirements. I just had to bring mana pots and pure int gears for that.
---
The art of the deal, everybody
---
Also worth noting that it’s very difficult, arguably impossible, for Druids to competitively perform as damage dealers in PvE, the most accessible role for newer players. I’d encourage you not to be daunted by that though if you really want to heal or tank, the latter of which I would say is the most satisfying gameplay in PvE.
---
&gt; this is proof you dont have to get rolled
---
"I got rolled"
---
Ok so you see...
---
It’s boring because even if you want to PvP you can’t usually find someone flagged to kill.
---
So... northwest
---
Is that a good thing or not?
---
Says the guy in a blizzard thread, probably playing blizzard games.
---
You know WC3 (not reforged) is still played competitively? That game is amazing. Same with SC, SC2, D2, blizzard makes some amazing games that stand the test of time.
---
D4 hasn't come out yet, unless you have your fottage of playing the demo @ blizzcon, I don't think you can accurately comment on if it's going to suck or not.
---
But we are all entitled to our own opinion.
---
I'm surprised people do this. It's not like mages have much to carry around (no ammo or soul shards, and generally only one set of gear unlike warriors). I never run into bag space issues on my mage and I always carry both runes, because hey, saving 9s is saving 9s.
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/totally-pawesome-druid-macros-tested-in-beta-and-ready-for-classic/255251
---
That's still a pretty beefy range to detect a raid.
---
Is it 2 screens that are same just different layovers? Like there is 2 of your characters between the 2 screens but one doesn't have ui and other does ?
---
It does, but disliking unstructured WPvP does not inherently mean disliking opt-in structured PvP.
---
I expect your average PvP server player to spend more time in BGs, sure, but it will be nowhere near as bad an imbalance as on PvP servers right now.
---
It will be cleared by the allaince same day as release.
---
Classic WoW would never have happened without private servers.  They are, indisputably, the biggest contributor to why Blizzard decided to create Classic WoW.
---
Not all. Only the decent ones. Most can't, some are trash enough to not be able to do it at 60.
---
I use it on my lvl 21 rogue to find targets in redrigde, and to keep track o. Kills so I don't kill  the same target twice in one sitting.
---
What race do you play?   I played alliance Shaman, so it was a moot point.  Wow head recommends troll, but I’ve done Tauren in the past to get the hit points for better survivability.
---
One chance a week for one hunter to get half the quest. I know it's 50% chance but I wish our guild had your luck.
---
You can fill an arbitrary amount of bag space with consumables, given the current situation.
---
Then you could purchasr your tier boes lol
---
I was keeping 4 5 6 7 open and would change them depending on if I was soloing or grouping (so soloing would be 4 mana, 5 searing, 6 stone, 7 air).
---
But I've changed that for a macros using cast sequence main one I use for groups is defensive with mana&gt;stone&gt;windwall (which I bind to 5)
---
And offensive with mana&gt;windfury&gt;str. (Which I bind to 6)
---
I still click when I want to use grounding. Earthbound. Or magma. But usually don't need me to react super fast.
---
For a dps? Lol
---
Bingo!
---
Yeah, every game that has given blizzard its prestige is nearly 20 years old, hell even sc2 is now 10 years old and had mixed reviews.
---
You need better examples.
---
Look at those ears, he's clearly a night elf midget.
---
Seems hard enough
---
I'm pretty certain you get 100% honor on first kill, then 90%, 80%, etc., down to 0%.
---
So 50s for 180 honor.
---
....They be saying damn u got some big feet
---
&gt;This is why dumb people cannot predict future events; they don't understand current and past events.
---
&gt; You cannot look just a couple steps ahead and see how fucked that would be.
---
After saying that classic has turned out exactly the same way as it turned out on private servers, I think its pretty fair to say that I can.
---
We have everyone stop dots around 45-50% and we’ve been 20-manning her since we were in blues and greens.
---
I didn't know anything about it until I saw all the posts complaining about it. I got it, it's amazing and I love it. Butthurt rogues just need to get better at the game.
---
Guess we'll give it a go tonight!
---
He's a priest, but our friend is as well (60) so we're basically just losing a DPS slot
---
&gt;So because knowledge on everything is available you want blizz to ban some thing that always existed. 
---
&gt;Might as well ask blizzard to change all the stats on gear because in vanilla people didn’t know what bis was and had to troll elitist jerks forums for nuggets
---
Yea, and in the process it broke (or potentially hampered) damage and threat meters. The PVE babies lose all around!
---
Hit 60 a couple weeks ago. Only 300g, 60% mount. Got tired of farming felcloth and elementals. Decided to farm SFK for chance at boe twink items. 
---
Got Shadowfang on 3rd run
---
He spawned late at night. It took us and 2 other raids to help burn him down because of all the greifing. 120ish ppl for kaz.
---
it's nothing personal he's just farming ranks and building up hatred so more people want to fight. he's actually helping wpvp by keeping y'all salty and eager to come back. hatred is all we need
---
Nobody was staring at their combat log hoping to see a rogue go stealth.
---
Shutup bird.
---
Deffo Joanas
---
Thanks!!
---
I was in this exact situation and can confirm it works. Had a guildie with R3 buy the mount, saving me 100g.
---
Work it out with the rogues.  You can all agree to /roll min DKP in set pieces to save your DKP for cross class items.  We sometimes had similar arrangements amongst warriors.
---
How much spell hit do I need total in order to have the minimum resist chance for PvP?
---
My friends got me confused, I have 3% from talents but I don't know how much I need on my gear.
---
For most PvP realms, it’s only a PvP realm if you join Alliance.
---
You could always have a 2 strike system, first flag is a warning and 2nd is a punishment.
---
One little nitpick: getting on a flight path unflags you, which means that the only way you are flagged on landing is by either landing in a contested zone or having /pvp toggled on.
---
Please do, I highly doubt you do jump runs in 8 minutes.
---
it will be cleared by pserver guilds on release, sure. They have been clearing this content for the last 4 years on high quality servers.
---
But for people who haven't played vanilla for 4 years straight, it will probably be a good challenge. I certainly hope so.
---
I still play most of my examples, as well as wow classic. If you dislike blizzard and their games, you are free to choose otherwise. That's what's great about freedom of choice.
---
&gt;Nesingwarys camp pops into view, 2 hordies have just enganged an ally. Charge the hordies and start fighting. Then more hordies come, then more allies come, then more hordies, more allies. And suddenly youve got this awesome chaotic skirmish made up of random solo/duo questers duking it out.
---
Fun
---
&gt;Doing group quests in stromgarde, 5man team low 40s. Were about to enter the main building for the named boss but when we get there theres a 4man horde team with a lvl60. We back off and let them go in first, wait for them to get halfway to the main room and then we charge. All hell breaks loose in a tiny cramped corridor, aoe is going off all over the place and feared players are pulling the entire castle. Everybody dies, but we win the war. The horde res outside the castle and run away, we kill the boss and feel like gods.
---
&gt;Mining in un goro, rich thorium pops up on the map. Get there just in time to see a hordie start up the animation. Charge him, kill him and get the node. Recognize the name, its the rogue who killed me a few times in winterspring while I was still levelling. "Pshh, nothing personnel kid".
---
These experiences make the world feel more alive and engaging. The fact that you can be attacked at any time also makes the rare moments of peace when the other faction chooses to not attack you much more meaningful.
---
Wpvp has always been a ton of fun and the favorite part of wow for me. What we have now is an abomination very different from the pvp I experienced back in the day, and a company that is either unwilling or unable to put in the effort and fix it.
---
Yeah, i'm fully expecting it to come full circle. There must be balance! lol
---
that is totally up to you. for me, I am not a big fan of it.
---
Just in case, you don't use Ambush in pve dagger rogue. You have talents that improve backstab but none for ambush
---
Speaking as a warrior. Executing on vael is equally **terrifying**. You're just waiting for boss to turn around and fuk you and the raid up the arse.
---
It wouldnt be close to 5 minutes. Last night, going from Thorium point to BRD with a full 5 man all at once, took over an hour, on a med-high pop server (never queues but always high). If there was only 1 route, with a choke point (or going through badlands), it would take at least twice that. I already was on the verge of quitting, and I'm sure the group was as well.
---
The game lost a LOT of content with p2 and faction imbalance. You cant just farm in the world, you dont want to just go help a guildie do a dungeon because itll take forever to get there. They killed more than half the game because of this.
---
Thanks! I was looking for people like you!
---
wait how can you make /e yellow colored text? That's not possible..
---
Got the proof?  Targets that go stealth stay untargetable, my succubus I send to seduce a rogue stops if the rogue uses stealth.
---
Honestly the only thing out of those two professions that will make you money is the mooncloth cooldown.
---
This is how retail happened the first time: vocal minority.
---
I'm not sure but you could try disabling the Enchantrix it comes with by unchecking the load box in the add-ons list. I'm an enchanter so I like it :P
---
&gt; found the rogue main LUL
---
Freaking Spy addon!
---
With all the time, effort and gold involved in twinking that char, it would've been more efficient to level a hunter and just one shot people. No need for grenades, potions, engineering, rare twink items, expensive enchants, high level bandages etc.
---
I didn't have this same kind of a grind, but as a fire mage this is how happy I felt when I finally got a flaming band of the eagle.
---
Always frost ...
---
I hate rogues
---
From what I saw back in the day it was one screen stretched across both but the play field was limited to just the screen on the left and the right was black and only addon windows showed up. But if there's a way to do it how you mentioned, it would work the same, and you'll just see your player in the background behind the windows which is fine with me.
---
Went to hinterlands to farm the +7 int bracer enchant, 2nd kill :)
---
They could go after the maker of the add-on as well.
---
They used to do that for add ons that were paid afdons, but that is a completely different beast.
---
It's crazy how you can scan over there icons that are for your class mostly, and just look right past the one you need. Love that auto one though
---
I was leveling up and saw a guild on my server say they were looking for one more dwarf priest. I was maybe 56 or so and I usually can't make weekday raids, but I messaged the leader anyway. He said it'd be fine to come and have to leave early if necessary.
---
Turns out I got a spot in the number one guild on my server. We clear MC+Ony way faster than any other guild on either faction on our server, which means I don't even have to miss any of the raiding (although I'm sure once BWL comes out I'll be back in my normal dilemma). They've been super helpful (someone gave me the priest DM book for free) and I'm just continually amazed at how good we are. It's going to make PvP ranking a lot easier, having this solid group of people and we'll probably end up being one of the only guilds on our server to complete BWL (RP servers lul).
---
So I feel like that's the luckiest I've been in classic wow. Stumbling onto this great guild.
---
So Jelly!!
---
Hate to burst your bubble, but the truth is that professions are a big money sink until they are maxed at 300. Even then they take a conserted effort to turn a profit and make back what you put in. If a mount at 40 was your goal than you should have taken gathering professions (skinning/mining/herbalism). Your best bet is to ignore your professions and stop spending any money on all but your most necessary class skills. Keep leveling and saving. You likely wont get your mount at 40. Dont stop leveling to farm money. The stronger you are the faster money will roll on. Most people will get thier mount by lvl 46 or so.
---
Horde queues are longer.
---
I hear what you are saying. My argument why it peeves me is because I will pass on my priest DPS gear for casters who can choose no other, like mages and locks. The LBRS legs and briarwood Reed when running w/ guildies comes to mind. Being a healer in raids and healer in dungeons, and a healer in PVP I do not really have an offspec.
---
When I head into dungeons as a healer, I'm often bored. I like to whisper other people and see what they want, so I can root for them when we do that boss. No warrior gear I can roll on, but I like to see that they did have a good day getting what they want.
---
Imagine being Horde and preferring Orgrimmar over Thunder Bluff. It’s like you don’t even walk with the Earth Mother.
---
In the specific case of Fury Warriors, there really isnt much you can do I don't think.  There arent THAT many upgrades from MC for them, so they'll always crush you in DKP for weapons.
---
This also means someone could create a live log parser to do exactly what spy did.  It would just have to be external to the game.
---
massive crybaby
---
You can do it in a weekend.
---
This isn't griefing... It's literally stated this boss is supposed to be a free for all, open world fight. Just because you're on the same faction as another guild doesn't mean "wE hIt It FiRsT iTs OuRs". 
---
It isn't trolling for another guild to come up and wipe you. Maybe they wanted it the boss too? Crazy thought, I know.
---
Half a football field (American)
---
Agree with this. Keep the second tank in the middle of the threat table and not to build too much threat until close to the end of p2. Also make sure the tanks pay attention to whether or not they get fireballed. IF both tanks get fireballed in p2, they need to go ham on onyxia with any means possible.
---
I was under the impression Vael is where you stick the 9 Fury warriors in the raid to one side and have them die one at a time .
---
You’ll stop getting xp around 52
---
Why in the world would anyone transmute earth to fire?
---
having Briarwood Reed drop on my 2nd ubrs run ever and actually winning it
---
I can unironically see Blizzard doing this and then claim that's closer to intended vanilla behavior.
---
You should if you're here bitching about it
---
There used to be a sync option back in vanilla. Everyone had to use the same metre for it though. I am not sure if they still have this option , but it would be nice! It really helps with accurate damage reports.
---
That’s not much honor for that amount of kills, I suggest sticking to solo/small groups. Example: I got 236 kills = 14k honor.
---
What is a good price to sell this at?
---
How do you solo them? can you pm me your strat?
---
Thx capt obvious,  gj.  Fucking nostradamus over here making the big predictions.
---
Eye of Shadow in my first 3 Winterspring demon kills. Not a priest, but that was a nice 300 gold after selling at a discount to a guildie.
---
Aight. I'm already logging for my guild anyway. But I kinda like have "direct feedback" during raid with details
---
The problem is we have 7-8 dps warriors, 6 rogues and I would never get a weapon in classic unless I save and never get armor because the warriors aren’t spending any dkp on armor. As in, they don’t even want it. So it’s not fair or balanced. Essentially warriors get full priority on all weapons over rogues.
---
I'm not sure what kind of potato you're playing on but 50 yards is not the render distance unless you're in a very populated area.
---
And not just an empty one, a leaded vial too :c
---
I think you're a fucking asshole actually.  You should've just kicked him earlier if you intended to.  Seems like he was just waiting in the instance and asked where you guys were and you freaked out.
---
I had Asherthuj and Rhokdelar and one night I wasn’t paying enough attention and broke both.
---
Thanks!
---
They are completely different experiences. If you want an old school RPG experience where the difficulty is the grind and the plat experience isn't crazy complex and twitchy, classic is probably for you. 
---
If you want to blast through a shallow leveling experience, get to max level, to do fast paced and timed content, crazy complex boss battles with a million timers to watch, complex action rotations, twitchy play, go go go attitude on everything, play retail.
---
Retail has a ton of story to explore. Whereas classic obviously only has the initial story. I've played since '06, but never been huge on the lore. I prefer science fiction more than fantasy.
---
For a beginner, there are pluses and minuses to each. Watch some overview and action vids on each. Itll probably be real obvious which you want to play once you have some ideas, because again they are such drastically different games.
---
Well this went dark quickly.
---
Unfortunately, the player base nowadays is just much, much different from back in vanilla. Maybe it was different on different servers, but almost nobody used it on Aegwynn-US back in the day. It existing doesn't really matter since it wasn't in wide use, unlikely classic, where easily half or more of the active population is using it.
---
We don't know the full story.  This is one perspective.  The events are rogue goes to instance.  Asks repeatedly where everything is.  Gets kicked.
---
Can’t give you a number of runs, because it’s all about winning AV and how many Quest turn ins you complete, not really just running it.
---
Expect people to be exalted within 72 Hours of release.
---
What is a good price to sell these at?
---
You have a link to this Discord and or just the WA?
---
I think he's referring to the surprisingly large contingency of feeble brained individuals who goes "just use your grounds mounts then lol" whenever people complain about flying existing in retail.
---
No the range of the combat log was increased to 200 yards in patch 2.4 so that dps and threat meters would work properly.  They elected to have this feature in Classic so that player's addons would be accurate.
---
I’m considering leveling a shaman as my alt and was gonna be a troll. What makes you say you regret picking troll?
---
A weekend of 20 hours each day?
---
So they should have implemented the changes you want. Ok.
---
It's extremely easy to disprove what you just said as a hunter. If you eagle eye into a town that hasn't rendered, everything will render at once and you certainly don't see buffs on everyone popping over their heads at the same time.
---
Also hunter's mark has a 100 yard range and players are certainly able to see you and target you outside of that range.
---
&gt; but rogues are fun in 10-19 warsong bracket :D
---
Absolutely, but that looks more like wetlands with untwinked chars 3 levels above and whatnot. 
---
His char looks twinked to the back of its teeth - with crusader at 19, grenades and whatever else. The other 22-30 chars don't stand a chance. I mean, if you're going to kill level 22-30 people who don't stand a chance, just kill them with your 60 and save yourself the trouble of farming twink items or paying for expensive enchants and all that. Aimed shot, corpse run. No problem.
---
Such as what? I thought most of the longer-range abilities were in the 40-45 yd range.
---
Yeah he's being a dick but he was waiting for you guys. 
---
I had a dps leave our grp without saying a word. Our healer and tank were dying a bunch getting to BRD. I became group leader and only needed 1 dps after a short minute. I invited him back after getting like 10 messages (lost focus and invited on accident) and then quickly dropped him. He had the audacity to scold me and demand a reason for the kick, lol.
---
What?
---
What other addon acts even remotely like Spy?
---
&gt; you'll be missing 5% crit from axe spec if you go for a dagger.
---
Axe spec is in the arms tree. Nobody is going to skip Bloodthirst for weapon specs.
---
I 100% did this in vanilla. A random guy who helped me out bought my mount and traded it to me using his tank 3 discount. It works the same way now as it did when I got my first mount.
---
Ok so you downvote me and ninja edit your post.  Do you actually want help or just someone to stroke your ego?
---
So get your nightslayer and wait till others get their weapons. Or go daggers so you have less warrior competition.
---
Imagine falling for a solo mage using a portal to port themselves somewhere.
---
Depending on how much time you've invested, you may want to hold out until Dec 10.
---
BG's will diminish world PvP greatly.
---
It would maybe be worth it on a server like Gehennas where Essence of Water sells for 20-30g
---
Even without going fury prot you get her back almost instantly. I'm the OT, I just dual wield, pop recklessness and a Mighty Rage Potion and grab her as soon as she lands, but I'm still deep prot spec.
---
If these people were playing retail on at least heroic difficulty, it will be the walk in the park.
---
I've only seen 2 and both share an overwhelmingly positive sentiment. (With a little concern over threat meters and details)
---
**My healing look like this.**
---
It stands me up (incase I was drinking, Dismounts me in case I was riding, cancels form incase I was in animal form)
---
Please note that dismount requires a double press/click. first dismounts second casts.
---
It targets Mousever, Then target, then targets target, then myself.
---
The first one I can help that isn't dead. (some people find the target's target akward, but I find it handy that I can keep the boss or horde targeted and just slap a heal on whoever is getting beat on without losing my target or having to find them to mouseover.
---
    #showtooltip Regrowth 
---
    /stand
---
    /dismount 
---
    /cancelform  
---
    /use [@mouseover,help,nodead][@target,help,nodead][@targettarget,help,nodead][@player] Regrowth
---
This only targets mouseover or my target. Otherwise I can be out of range of the healers, and accedentaly Innervate myself spamming the Heal version.
---
    #showtooltip Innervate
---
    /use [@mouseover,help,nodead][@target,help,nodead] Innervate
---
My nukes are all in this form.
---
Again it stands (incase I was drinking)
---
dismounts incase I was riding (again requires a double click/press to dismount then nuke)
---
cancels form incase I'm not in caster form.
---
and then targets mouseover, then target, then target's target, the first one that I can harm.
---
    #showtooltip Moonfire 
---
    /use [@mouseover,harm][@target,harm][@targettarget,harm] Moonfire 
---
My Tag nearest mob that is about to spawn somewhere near me macro. (if I don't know the mobs name, or don't care which one spawns and want the tag regardless. 
---
It stands, dismounts, cancels form, clears target (so I dont have a random target), abuses /startattack to automatically target closest mob. Gives it Skull raid Icon, and attempts to slap it with moonfire rank 1 to tag.
---
    #showtooltip Moonfire(Rank 1) 
---
    /cleartarget 
---
    /startattack 
---
    /tm 8
---
    /use [@target,harm] Moonfire(Rank 1)  
---
My tag Named mob as soon as it spawns macro.
---
It stands, dismounts, cancels form, clears target (so I dont have a random target), 
---
targets mob with a particular Name.
---
Gives it Skull raid Icon, and attempts to slap it with moonfire rank 1 to tag.
---
    /target Rare Spawn 
---
    /use [@target,harm] Moonfire(Rank 1) 
---
My caster form / stand macro. (so many doors, chests, NPC's, and objects you can't interact with.
---
Since my animal forms are all power shift macros, I use a dedicated macro for human form.
---
**My animal forms** are all "powershift" or "dust macros" that way I always drop movement impairment effects, or trigger WolfsHide Helm, and Furor for free rage or energy.
---
Please note you need to manually cancel Predatory Strikes and Leader of the pack before you cancel animal forms otherwise you lose both of those buffs every other cycle.
---
    #showtooltip Dire Bear Form 
---
    /cancelaura Predatory Strikes
---
    /cancelaura Leader of the Pack
---
    /cancelform 
---
    /use Dire Bear Form 
---
**My travel form macro.**
---
I don't  incude cat form in my travel form macro. because its much more expensive in mana costs and I don't want to use it when it wouldn't give me a speed benefit. (indoors)
---
    /dismount
---
    /use [swimming]Aquatic Form; [outdoors]Travel Form
---
**My Prowl Macro,**
---
Cancels any non-cat form, Puts me in catform, casts prowl.

    /cancelform [noform:3] 
---
    /use [noform:3] Cat Form

Just like prowl but dashes instead.

While it's not much in terms of value, 3 blue BoEs (2 for 19 twinks !) in an hour killing peasants in hillsbrad. I've never had 2 in a day, let alone 3 in a single hour, so i consider this my most lucky moment :D
---
Anything involving DoTs or Pets?
---
Warrior t1 is not good for dps, why would they spend dkp on it. Nightslayer is good, go bid on it.
---
You're examples are still bad -- you can't compare those old gems of blizzard games to the crap they are putting out now.
---
Naturally we all play(ed) and still enjoy those older Blizzard titles, its why we are here instead of on those other sub-reddits or forums.
---
With this macro you could solve your problem:
---
#showtooltip Slam
---
/dismount
---
/cast Slam
---
This will allow you to use Slam while on Horse. The downside is that you have to mount up again after each use of Slam.
---
I’m in a small guild and we are waiting to see if battlegrounds help reduce the death raids in every zone. If not we are probably flipping. 
---
Most people are still leveling in the late 50s. If they aren’t on to run them through dungeons, I’m leveling up on a PvE server.
---
The changes Nost were so successful with and that everybody liked. Which also included the real AV.
---
Since they do fit into my definition of changing player behaviour it would be interesting discussion as to where to draw the line, but it is still also another discussion which doesn't belong into this thread.
---
I dunno...I played on k3 and it was bad for awhile but nothing like it is on whitemane
---
They can't remove it because of how it works. You'd have to rework the combat log to break it.
---
Depends if you are premading, winning or losing but roughly speaking its 20ish hours on av weekend.
---
It takes 48h for transmute CDs.
---
pretty sure grobbulus is most balanced
---
Dude I just hope this Pasta is on this subreddit.
---
Hmmm... :thinking:
---
who is that? lol
---
I'm willing to bet money that there are more horde than alliance on most servers. $5 to your paypal if you can prove me wrong.
---
There are a lot of really really good recipes coming in later phases that require essence of water.
---
- mana regen to bracers
---
- frost power to gloves 
---
- healing power to weapon
---
- all of the frost resist gear used in naxx
---
And all mages, warlocks, shadow priests, and elemental shaman will forever need waters for spellpower enchants.
---
true in this case where ur already basically a level 30 you should just log onto your 60 and kill them. id imagine if you got killed by one you'd just log onto your 60 and gank them off camera anyway.
---
It sounds stupid, but I just used addons to center my raid frames and moved action hotkeys to the side.
---
Well fuck. I’ve been putting it in my professions cause it’s fun and wanted to make money. I’ve got like 12 gold at 35. Would have much more if I wasn’t disenchanting everything.
---
How do you suggest I make gold from here on? Other than selling everything and questing.
---
Seriously insane. MT ALWAYS gets bindings first.  In my Vanilla guild, the bindings went to a rogue, but he was RL, and this was known beforehand, while not optimal, it was fine by everyone, because he was literally at every raid, and he had server transferred to RL our guild, and we never would have gotten through BWL/Onyxia without him.  Even though the decision to give the RL rogue TF was not optimal, we all agreed on it before hand.
---
You can't just suddenly decide to randomly give out the bindings when they drop, people need to know ahead of time.  Our MT was ok with the rogue getting bindings, so no drama there.
---
Wow...
---
Does your guild have a minimum DKP for rolling? If not couldn't you just roll on gear without spending DKP at all?
---
Or if you handle things without rolls, couldn't you just spend a paltry amount of DKP to get your armor, then save for weapons?
---
Did it work?
---
The thing is that the MCd player loses the honorless target since the priest make them attack the duel player, this means:
---
1. No waiting 30sec before killing them for honor. 
---
2. The since MC makes the target friendly to you faction, this means only the dude you duel will be able to attack the MC target. 
---
The dueling players is in the same party so they can get honor without the opposite faction player can fight back, and they don't need to share any other with their own faction since they can't get a tag.
---
For dm east solo method the usual spec is sm/ds. If you do the invis pot strat you can do any strat as you're not killing the last boss, just evading him and running by at 50%
---
Other add-ons add functionality that normally does not exist. Objectively, why should spy be removed?
---
If you really need a specific example, lets you threat meters because they also read the combat log.
---
How do you invis pot while in combat?
---
this is what i had to do. Just grind it out in dungeons and save yourself the headache of trying to quest in the world right now. 
---
revenge will come :p
---
Literally 20m to the left of the guards.
---
One thing that is good with the nochanges thing, is that it's a common ground for arguments wether or not something should be added or removed from the game. It's not working as it was in vanilla? Well then it's not working properly. Makes for a simple rule and development without complicating things.
---
Druid.
---
My memory sucks, but at one point I think you had to manually target them for the list to populate.
---
We do it right on Mograine.
---
If they can disregard the DPS meter, then sure.
---
If not I expect some guilds to be slaughtered, which is why I am really looking forward to BWL. Its really the great test of DPS player egos.
---
Why would the light waste time on a bitch rogue while there's literally a damn giant dragon ruling the city?
---
Name checks out
---
Nothing wrong with hunter's having to use Eagle Eye and be more proactive, as they should be doing without Spy
---
&gt;  I don't know if he was getting anything from that or not other than sadistic glee. 
---
Presumably, they want to get a high enough rank to get the pvp trinket, right?
---
bout fucking time!
---
Loved the brez into insta death
---
My mains horde so itd have to be a different server and misses out on the free gold funnel from my main lol
---
That's elemental fire....
---
that's my char ;D  
---
very first fight was vs 2 lvl 30's. outcome isn't obvious vs a 19 twink, i would say.  
---
but 60 would be boring right?  
---
tbh just wanted to test my new finished twink
---
1) warstomp saves my life. I click warstomp, stun the enemy, Heal myself, then I’m good to go.
---
2) more health
---
3) Taurens look cooler. I just regret my horns.
---
Gameplay over canon, again.  There is nothing stopping forsaken from being paladins other than gameplay purposes.
---
only by a minuscule margin, and since WF is 1000x more fun, it's the clear choice
---
He must be using the spy addon
---
..... Bruh.... 50% drop rate....  Every hunter will get it eventually.  I got my guild's first, but I didn't even finish it first, because one dropped the next week, and the other hunter had more free time to get the quest done.
---
Like, literally the least important drop to cry about.
---
yeah tough to dps and get what you need. The dps life is rough.
---
main reason why i rolled a druid, so i could switch between them all. Tank to get healing/dps gears, healing to get tanking/dps gears, dps only gets dps gears :(
---
Yes, but reducing the combat log distance affects the reading of both enemy and friendly actions....
---
Which is what the poster you replied to was referring to.
---
There's a tiny ledge just to the right of the tunnel that causes everything to evade. As NE I can shadowmeld once they drop combat to properly reset them, same goes for druid stealth. As other races you'd have to use some trickery to safely invis pot without wasting most of the timer waiting for imps to stop staring at you, I've tried it a few times and it seems quite doable, just not as reliable.
---
Onyxia feels different to me than how I remember her in vanilla. I was our guilds main tank then and never had any threat issues with P3. DPS could go all out, and as long as I didn't get hit by the first fear with either fear ward or beserker rage she would always run straight to me. I honestly can't remember how I dealt with the fireballs though, I just know I never had threat issues in P3 like most tanks seem to now. Is it partially because DPS is so much higher now maybe?
---
Saw this coming! Thanks for your well constructed feedback
---
Unless you decide to prioritize the weapons by waiting to get your armor, then you have the same chance to get it as they do. This is just how DKP works, if you want to have an even chance to get every piece of gear, start a pug group and roll on it when it drops. Also as I said before, daggers exist if you don't want to spend everything you have competing with warriors and the other rogues.
---
Eh, it only takes me a bit over 4 days played to get to 60 (at least it did on horde), I'm not too worried. The only gear I've gotten on my characters I leveled on pvp servers was the boe gear. My friends and I also decided to move over all together rather than keep waiting for transfers (and being on an est server sounds way better for finding a raiding guild than it was on smolderweb)
---
This comment is now a 3/3 elk.
---
On the contrary, you're bad if you think it's not. If you don't understand the massive advantage it gives you over someone who doesn't have it, then you're pretty bad.
---
Blue post said they reduced it from 200 to 50. People who used Spy claim they reduced it from Vanilla.
---
Same Spy users claiming it was in Vanilla when it wasn't.
---
Blue &gt; players
---
You don't understand. Weapons are the only significant upgrade. Nothing else even compares. Weapons are a 5% or 10% drop rate if you wait in line behind 5-6 warriors you aren't EVER going to get a weapon. Like not at all in classic.
---
no it's not... the only warcraft 3 models used in WoW are the chicken, the rabbit, and the boar.
---
I know it looks cooler but you should have mirahs song in oh and my brut blade
---
Welcome to the conversation hours later
---
His Spy Addon was NOT nerfed.
---
Not 20 but yes you'd have to play most of the day.
---
Yeah OP is kinda a pos. With zero integrity. Pretty sad
---
That's called a shadow council and enrages guilds and causes a lot of drama. Any guild worth a shit wont allow that.
---
Benediction
---
Wouldn’t say huge, especially compared to alliance advantages in AV and WSG. The shorter walk time is pretty huge though, would still give ally advantage with paladins, they’re just better in premades.
---
I just finished leveling. I respecced to ele from enh at 54 and massively regretted it. I found things died a lot quicker but my down time was a lot worse. This seems contrary to everything I've read but this has been my experience. At 60 though ele is super fun, I'm playing 30 ele 21 resto. One thing I missed whilst leveling is my ability to do good damage whilst oom with a slow 2h and rock - as ele, being oom means losing a lot of dmg (yes, you can 1h with flame). Your experience may vary
---
Assomeone who used this offensively the nerf is huge. It's basically a glorified stat tracker now.
---
&gt;"What is an outlier"
---
right my bad
---
Hopefully, I wouldn't know though. Was just piggybacking on the other user's comment about wanting accurate meters and how the distance change could potentially affect the accuracy.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khi8MCCdm5A
---
&gt;  very first fight was vs 2 lvl 30's. outcome isn't obvious vs a 19 twink, i would say.
---
I would say it is.
---
Most characters don't even have 150 in a gathering professions at level 30, never mind grenades. They might have a healing potion - but not one appropriate for their level. They most certainly don't have high level bandages - never mind crusader. They only way they've got an enchant is if they're leveling enchanting. A rare/twink item? Not a chance - most of them have probably not seen a blue unless it's a dungeon quest reward (generally as useful as getting AIDS for the second time).
---
It's like giving a 12 y/o a machine gun and claiming his 2 18 y/o opponents stand a chance because they too have plastic spoons, so the outcome isn't obvious.
---
It's obvious. Trust me. 
---
&gt;  tbh just wanted to test my new finished twink
---
It's not bad at all. It's just...somewhat pointless and more expensive for a char designed to kill people who don't stand a chance anyway.
---
Damn. Yeah, I have a similar macro to go into cat form and then immediately start prowling and it works fine.
---
I do have the Wolfshead Helm in my bank, never wear it but I wonder if putting that on and getting the instant rage would make it work?
---
If you had an addon in an FPS that let you know an enemy was behind a wall, or around a corner, would that be considered a hack?
---
good blizzard finally owning these noobs
---
Nice gz man, now you got 2 1/2 weeks break till you can farm AV reputation
---
Yes, the problem is they therefore aren't spending DKP on armor, at all. So you are giving them essentially priority on all weapons over classes that DO want armor.
---
Try to keep up if you're going to come argue.
---
Don't know why people doubt an 8 minute clear, klinda posted 8 minute an clear over a month ago. That's a lot of time for extra gear saturation.
---
That isn't necessarily true.
---
I usually play 6-10 hours a week and i prefer classic because i can actually do whatever the fuck i want instead of being somewhat forced into dailies, weeklies and whatnot. My lvl 42 druid and highest level character is max alchemy, fishing, and herbalism.
---
In BFA that i also tested, i got to 120 without getting a single point in any profession, and since all the gear is given by any pebble on the road, i don't have any incentive to do anything other than dungeons, and i find this to be pretty limiting in regards to the gameplay.
---
That's just my 2 cents though. Some people might prefer BFA since content is more challenging, and action packed in general.
---
Dirk + buckler would be fine choices while healing. At low gear levels, mp5 is a good stat for resto shaman. Eventually you'll wanna prioritize healpower but for now, you get good value out of mp5.
---
It's a minor difference, but I would have kept Soothsayers Headdress. The armor doesn't matter, but int matters more for both healing and dps than stamina or spirit.
---
Lol. Trueeeee. 🤐Well I’ll just say, I was in that guild while leveling and the people in it were veryyy similar to what you’ve described. Female priest officer talking constantly in g chat while other officers/co GM or whatever he was (mainly one) treated her like Queen B. Hardly any talk about the game. Annoyed the shit out of me. I left ASAP because I already peeped what that was all about.
---
Didn't a lot of orcs grew up in concentration camps controlled by Lordaeron? They speak common.
---
Spy is great, but the fact is that the combat log event's broadcasted way more than it did with similar events with the 1.12 client. On top of that it could detect auras/buffs from a hostile, which made it possible to instantly alert whenever a hostile is near with abour 200yds (or whatever the combat log ranges were). It should only detect events happning within rendering distance, not instantly.
---
What was the gold per hour doing this? Guess 5 kills in 25m?
---
What about ornate spyglass ?
---
every warlock simulation says SB on CD is a dps decrease i don't know where he got that - but i wouldn't worry about SB using a debuff slot. There's only ~10-12 mandatory debuffs and SB is at the very low of the games priority system so it would instantly get knocked off by anything else.
---
I just realized I never answered your question regarding The Hinterlands...
---
So my guess would be it has something to do with Seradane.  Seradane, a world tree, was planted in The Hinterlands because Yogg-Saraon's blood was beginning to creep to the surface and appear in The Hinterlands - Seradane was meant to stem that somehow.  Relatedly, the Green Dragonlight present in the area were corrupted, and of course the Emerald Dream itself has been corrupted.
---
Oozes in the area are very likely related to those circumstances.
---
My servers subreddit is dead, especially on the Horde side. Where's a good place to look for guild recruitment? Is there a Thunderyfury discord?
---
Ignore the haters.  
---
Spy is (was?) great and so are you.
---
Spy was terrible when it came out and it’s terrible now. Only reason you hear more crying now is because people cry more now in general.....over everything.
---
I got my shadow wrath one on my lock my first run AT level. My guildie said there's a streamer on run like 850 looking for it yet lol.
---
This sums up how I feel about most addons in WoW. I wish Blizzard had a system to approve addons and only and just allowed ui customization and less game altering addons but its far to late for that.
---
Soul stone.
---
Seeing stuff like this reminds me why I stopped playing. No offense OP that’s some level of commitment. Doesn’t seem fun though.
---
Mask of unforgiven and baron Cape same run. Only good loot I have so far.
---
You wouldn't transmute arcanite anymore, which nets as little as 5g every 2 days. You would transmute undeath to water every day, which nets 10g+ per day.
---
And 20 frostspell damage.
---
The thing that’s been in since vanilla has been removed?  Sick!
---
Thanks everytime I find this I have to watch it 12 times.
---
Watch your mouth, lich
---
WSG and AB are super long grinds, don't count on getting those rewards any time soon. Though they're far better for honor farming, so if you're in a ranking premade you'll get them eventually.
---
It doesn't make it literally unplayable, but a lot of people don't have fun in a competitive setting if they know their opponent has a big advantage.
---
Where were you during the latest government council, when everyone was freaking out for taxes rising? Plus we havent payed defias for rebuilding SW yet..
---
Rogue can resealth during bubble and reset the fight themselves. Energy regens to full during that time and they still have combat points on you from the first go at the encounter.
---
Wow, no wonder Benediction is so stale lately. Almost a third of the top realms' pop.
---
Incendius looking like a solid choice too. Thank you for sharing these sites.
---
i mean this honestly was kind of epic by blizzard
---
PvE take : what would i even use spy for ?
---
I actually just broke down and bought a Wolfshead.  Same thing, not enough rage.
---
Point 1 is largely irrelevant because there is a difference in a mod for pvp and pve.  People using DBM for raids doesn't impact another player.
---
Point 2 is irrelevant because how long it has been around doesn't change anything about it.
---
Point 3 is mostly wrong because spy does greatly assist the "deathball" to find a hunter people.  It doesn't matter if it is a deathball, or a group of 2-3 people, spy would help them hunt people down they normally would not be able to fine.
---
Point 4 is still irrelevant to whether or not the mod is "good" or not
---
Point 5.  This is the only most relevant because of misinformation about what the mod does.  It does not detect rogues, it only gives an alert when you have detected a stealthed enemy nearby.  Wht it can do though it detect a nearby stealthed player and tell you a player is near if not able to tell you the player is stealthed
---
Point 6, once again irrelevant to the status of the mod.
---
I dislike a large part of what the mod does, but I can accept its existence and know I need to adapt to what it tells the player.  What I don't understand is the big push for people to try to say it's not that big of a deal but then fight tooth and nail to keep it active.  It is a very powerful tool as it automates an information advantage during a time where a player's attention can be spread very thin.
---
Yes, sure, I actually answered you in your post an hour ago :) This made me think that I can help more of guys like you.
---
Here's your macro:
---
/cast \[nostance:1\] Dire Bear Form; \[stance:1\] Feral Charge
---
Done.
---
You can also add:
---
/cancelform \[nostance:1\]
---
as  a 1st string (after the #showtooltip) and bind it separately from your  "noform" action bar for even more utility. This will let you to jump in  bear and rush as hell from any form. Ofc you need to click it 2-3 times.
---
Had a lot of fun with HotS as well. And I mean.. it's free.
---
Is there a place for alliance to do this quest? I grinded it for a while on my troll character and the quest giver is right there on the dock. I never got the quest on my human character. So I just went and got my fishing pole then left.
---
if people have the Adobe cloud, doing this in After Effects would be the easiest. But thats a monthly subscription cost so I imagine most of the people who make these don't use that unless they also work in the creative field
---
These edits are hilarious. I was laughing the entire video dude, keep it up!
---
Yeah wsg exalted has a lot of BiS gear so definitely gonna grind that. Ty.
---
&gt;The end-game for classic can be summed up into "get-gear" with that in mind addons like DBM become popular because they increase efficiency for the raid team. Nobody complains that it gives an advantage because the target is an NPC.
---
DBM hater here, the game would have been better if Blizz shut that shit down when it started popping up 15 years ago.
---
That way people would actually use their brains while raiding as oppose to having every encounter be entirely reactionary based.
---
So I had to download a patch, but I'm having trouble finding the keyring.
---
it is an addon the detects combat log activity (i think) and tells you who is around, so if u stealth it will alert you, allows you to click their name/ spam target so if it is a rogue u can attack immediately when they are within range, you can also mind vision the stealthed. Prior to yesterdays patch it was effective up to 200yrds, not effective up to 50 i hear?
---
Well, after they get one each, they won't have the DKP to compete with you anymore.
---
Leveling gear is different than 5 man gear, which is different from raid gear, which is different from PvP gear, etc. 
---
There’s some overlap in gear, and top-end differences are minor. 
---
In general:
---
* Leveling gear prioritizes uptime. So the longer you can stay in combat without dying and maintaining consistent damage is ideal. 
---
* 5 man gear prioritizes burst DPS. Fights last &lt; 30 seconds, so you want as much dps as quick as possible. 
---
* raid gear prioritizes consistent high dps. For warlocks, it should be identical to 5 man gear. 
---
* PvP prioritizes survivability and burst DPS. It’s a balance and relatively subjective. 
---
Any set of gear is going to be fine to level in, and there’s usually no need to min/max leveling gear.
---
Demons are all about Utility, they all change your playstyle and what strengths you have in dungeons and PvP, it's great to swap over from general survivability and offtanking to anti-caster and rogue utility in a 10 second cast (VW to Felhunter)
---
I dont know man. I know when something i say will have an impact. In this case, playing some mind games just for the lulz wont harm anyone. I cant wait for the day to come to spam Shazzrah with my Do Not Que on BGS and let Horde cry in queue.... :) I will literally spam 3 servers with multiple accounts and promote this idea.
---
DBM with the voice from the old flash animation at the phase changes is just amazing. I use it just for that (also for everything else is almost useless).
---
There was an addon that did exactly that we used on private servers.
---
If you do AV as soon as it launches when everyone else is grinding rep, you will have it done in 3 days. 
---
If you dont start immediately and miss the rush, it will probably take 1-2 weeks. It's the easiest rep grind in the game either way.
---
Didn't they fix that? i read you can't drop aggro now.
---
Because someone stealthing from 300 yards out was still detectable by the add on. When you walked in range it gave an alert of any buff the rogue had like idk... Stealth. Poisons. Etc.
---
love that explosive hairstyle
---
And dual boxing is not banned? Isn't that against rules too? Or is everyone here just clueless as usual and AHK is actually allowed?
---
Both guilds sound like giant pussy parties
---
When you say a lot more difficult, how long, at a rough estimate? I'm completely new to WoW, and truthfully I'd written exalted with BG's off as a pipe dream, but if AV is truly that easy then I may make that my first target and then switch to WSG for the tank legplates. I've never done BG's though, so as of right now I have no idea what they entail other than what I've seen on here.
---
Like said in your previous post, it's on the global cooldown that you can't overcome with a macro iirc, only way to do it us with the /castsequence and clicking twice.
---
5. I think rogues know it doesn’t detect them if they are in stealth prior to range. It effects them when they are in a zone and see enemy before they spot them. Goes into stealth to avoid or fight. Enemy now knows rogue is around
---
7 over an easily obtained quest offhand.
---
Why would it take longer if you wait until after the rush?
---
This is a fantastic idea. Server + faction icon would be the dream
---
Don’t worry, we have a contingency plan in place to deal with the whole Defias situation.  Apparently there are some new try-hards that rolled into town recently, word has it these glorified murder-hobos will take any job we offer them as long as we toss them a few silver and the chance of receiving some new stuff off the target.  We’ve already got Senor Cheezit sending them off to Westfall right now.
---
You should give casters a [hat](https://i.imgur.com/hxqkqPM.png)
---
This just sounds like getting drunk with extra steps.
---
Hijacking somewhat... any rogues got a working Ghostly Strike / SS macro? I tried one along the lines of 
---
`/castsequence reset=20 Ghostly Strike, Sinister Strike, Sinister Strike, [...a load more SS]`
---
but it doesn't reset, I can see from the icon GS is off cooldown but it still SS's until I've used up the last SS and it cycles back to GS.
---
Dedicated driver, with me
---
&gt;but hey Blizz don't wanna buy better servers
---
Blizz intentionally nerfed render distance on Classic.
---
Thanks! Sorry, just woke up and hadn’t checked the replies on my post yet. I appreciate it.
---
Don’t play warrior. You will hate the game.
---
Brazzers
---
What race are you?
---
I have been running with 4% hit for a while now, and I really don't feel like my spells have a 1% resist chance. Specifically it feels like my frost spell gets resisted unusually frequently.
---
Does frost resistance stat give resistance that can be overcome with additional hit?
---
You wouldn't.. it's a pvp addon .
---
Just get perd. Than rank 2 14 and flex on them wars with 1 week swords 1 week daggers and if you feeling stylish 1 week fists.
---
What’s the differences?
---
Got my Drake stone off shadow wrath on my lock on my first run.
---
Still have it and use it of course but I'm only lvl 54 lol
---
1. DBM provides guidance in PVE- not against other players. You don’t really have a significant advantage versus another player in DBM, especially if they are familiar with the fight. Spy gives you an advantage over someone who doesn’t have it.
---
2. No one cared in 2012 because there was a much smaller player base on private servers. Also, Private server player are much more “hardcore” than a lot of current casual players.
---
3. Spy contributes to death all meta. Also, if a group of ten is running around, there’s a chance a solo player can hide. Not with spy.
---
5. It literally tells you when there is stealth players nearby lol. That’s a huge disadvantage of “stealth”. While it doesn’t tell you their location, you know a stealth player is in the vicinity, and can adapt accordingly. 
---
6. If it wasn’t good, it wouldn’t have 1.2MM downloads.
---
7. It encourages some engagement. The opposite can happen-If I see a group that I might of run into, I might run away, thus discouraging.
---
If it wasn’t broken, people wouldn’t use. Blizzard doesn’t have it In their game for a reason, it’s busted.
---
Well, technically you also need a consumable... but who's counting!?
---
I never said it doesn’t profit him. But you clearly stated that asmon himself is releasing these videos which is plain wrong.
---
You ran ST 38 times a day for a month?
---
I mean, since it's all groups/raids for wpvp in PvE servers, would it matter in some way anyways ?
---
Yes that's frost resistance, and no it can't be overcome. Only gear with "reduces enemy resistance" can counter it, and it's quite rare.
---
I guess you gotta watch the movie then
---
there's also leather chest with 10 str, 10 stam and 2% crit.
---
Multi-boxing isn't against the TOS. It's been 15 years and people still don't get this..
---
Sounds like you're just whining a lot. What do you expect the guild to do if warriors don't want gear, ban them from getting weapons until all the rogues who have been getting armor also get their weapons? That doesn't make any sense. The goal is to gear everybody equally, just switch to daggers for less competition so no loot goes unwanted and everybody gears up and increases their dps, helping the raid overall.
---
\#showtooltip
---
/cast [stealth] Ambush; Gouge
---
And I believe this following macro should work to always try casting backstab first
---
/cast [stealth] Backstab
---
I am doing my Horde Onyxia attunement for the first time and need to collect  20 [Black Dragonspawn Eye](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16786/black-dragonspawn-eye)  from BRS.
---
What is the best strategy for collecting these?  Join a Rend run group and run a couple of times?
---
The light will forge you a new one
---
Those are his Yeezys
---
Don't agree with many of these, but it doesn't matter. People will stop caring about Spy once BGs come out and you not longer have to scour the open world for enemies.
---
Viskag and core hound tooth both in pugs
---
Ty Brem.  
---
The math is still the same. Top 3-5-7 servers will have cross realm. I will find who is matched with Shazzrah easily and create alts and spam there on their server.  
---
Cross server realm bgs? No problem, the more people realise you can frustrate Horde by not doing many BGS, the more Horde will do whatever they are doing. Nothing compares in open world with what BGS have to offer and i will do it. I will do it so often that my gameplay wont be affected at all. I can spam servers and i will spam the servers from multiple accounts while i play on main whatever the fuk i want. Hundreds of Hordes will be in the queue and i swear to go i will do it from multiple accounts, streaming. You want Chaos ? You get Chaos.
---
The hardcore raiders are going in for rep, as the exalted off hand is best in slot for several classes. Everyone will be focused on rep over honor for the first couple days. Getting rep is easier in faster when everyone is committed to the same goal.
---
Incendius is a good realm, good overall numbers but horde are dominant about 60-40 split, we need the help
---
not very good probably 10-15
---
If you want to reroll, Kromcrush Alliance will gladly take you.
---
I made a shaman on Wednesday in a full realm and got the name, “Shamans”. I can’t believe the name was not taken!
---
I'm not even going to argue whether your scale is accurate...your own scale indicates the healers are within 50 yards of melee.
---
You put the end of the range on the far side of Rag...if you put the range line on the near side of Rag every single player is within 50 yards (again, assuming your range line is accurate, which I'm not even certain that's true).
---
Hey, thanks for good words. Whenever you are in front or back, macros doesn't care. But it can check when you are stealthed. Here you go:
---
`#showtooltip` 
---
`/cast [nostealth] Gouge; [stealth] Ambush`
---
Let me know if something goes wrong, I make them without testing, so errors could be made. But not in this simple one :)
---
That was always our strat. All warriors lined spamming execute. The one that was next up to tank would just click off Salvation to make sure he was the highest of the warriors on threat.
---
“Yeah man, you’re good!”
---
Classic is single threaded. That's why you are dropping frames.
---
Use it during execute phases to generate a fuck ton of rage.
---
I was looking for this exactly comment, because that was my thought.  It was strategic to grab Lumbermill for that very reason. You could scout Blacksmith pushes and you could even see Stables.  You would be vocal on voip letting your premade know where to intercept and where to defend...
---
Congratz man, was farming those too for shadow wrath drakestone. After about 400 kills I finally got my... Anathema. Goodbye ST, you won't be missed.
---
They can't block it without totally removing the combat log, which they can't do. It's why they're just lowered the range the combat log will update to to 50 yards earlier, effectively nerfing spy.
---
Bring back Decursive IMO
---
&gt; Only reason you hear more crying now is because people cry more now in general.....over everything.
---
No, it's because we are in the short window of time when the thing to do is world pvp, and spy is a world pvp addon.
---
My brother died. He loved playing Vanilla. Here is a random screenshot of me standing in some place that reminds me of him.
---
I don't know that's what I'm asking. And if the goal is to gear everyone equally giving one class priority on all the weapons of another class is not the way to go.
---
thats because they are a chore to even find.
---
healing power on weapon already exists, you maybe meant healing power on bracers?
---
It is technically better for pushback but getting more flurry procs is cancelled out by eating the procs faster.
---
&gt;the 16 debuff restriction really hurts your end game raiding experience,
---
Incorrect.  I frankly don't even really use corruption anymore, becuase my raid doesn't moderate debuffs right now. It's not really necessary in this tier. Most of a warlocks dmg comes from our huge sbolt crits.
---
But they don't have claw
---
Honestly I'd bet it takes 8 minutes just to run the route and mine, not including killing anything. No way anyone does it under 10 min.
---
you can use prep and sprint again while in combat.
---
Benediction, Kromcrush, Stalagg if you're up for a Dark Souls-like challenge.
---
Max exodus of alliance guilds right now going on there due to poor faction balance so I don't think so lol
---
Good points.  I guess I should’ve specified I play Resto.   I just hate how trolls look.
---
Exactly! 
---
It would be awesome
---
Thank you for your time, much appreciated :)
---
Good luck! Guild mate hat 600 runs in Arena. Another guild mate had 3
---
They will if I spend DKP on armor
---
We should have a dedicated thread to posting in game pictures.
---
Edgemasters and axes is viable in ally since you generally will get weapons far quicker than joining the line for cts/viskag. Edgemasters and db will be very competitive with swords, offhand of choice atm flurry axe. 
---
Once bwl comes out theres a very strong offhand from trash, dooms edge. Crul from nef is actually stronger than cts due to final boss ilvl bonus. Crul actually has more dps than the aq sword as well.
---
Most "hardcore" players are going to get exalted in the initial rush by just running by every enemy and going straight to the enemy boss. This is the most rep/honor per hour. You really want to be in these battlegrounds.
---
If you miss this window after all the tryhard players become exalted, you will get 1-2+ hour games for very low rep/hour
---
Level 14 and haven’t had the time to read the guides yet. Which weapon buff should I be using at the moment please? What about leveling?
---
vael &amp; suppression room for me.  My pc/internet was so bad back then I often had to zoom in and look at the ground during those fights.  even then, my MS would go bonkers.  I'm excited to experience them for real and get a little nostalgia thinking back on the absurdity of 2004-2006 hardware
---
WAD
---
100% agree with this. One of the things I wanted to do in Classic was play in a guild where everyone boycotted DBM. Unfortunately there just arent enough people willing to forego the loot pinata parties for a more challenging experience.
---
I'm surprised I haven't seen this mentioned before. Details clearly shares data between users already, that's how it's able to see other people's talents. Combat data seems a bit more intensive/time sensitive though, it would also have to perform checks to ensure data wasn't duplicated. 
---
Has there been any confirmation that's how it works or will work going forward? Sharing that data seems unnecessary with how far the combat log worked before, so I can't imagine that's how it currently works. There's obviously a need for it now but people also praise Details for being so lightweight and that may or may not add some heft.
---
If you're using DKP they aren't getting priority though. If they have more DKP than you that means you've been getting gear already and they haven't. Every system has flaws but that's the whole purpose of DKP, if you spend it on gear people who haven't spent it are going to have more than you. My guild uses CEPGP which is similar to DKP, and people are already hording points for weapons. I'm a holy pally and I already know I'm probably never going to get my mageblade so I just use my points on gear.
---
Haven't decided yet but I think I will go Alliance human... :)
---
I see what you did there
---
I'm in your camp. 
---
If other people need a crutch for WPvP, let them.
---
So what is the big advantage? Sorry if i seem rude im just trying to understand. From what i heard it's mostly about knowing where people are, but you can litterrally just look at your screen. If they are close enough to attack you, you would also be able to see them ?
---
So, it's 42,000 rep from Neutral to Exalted.  Flag caps grant 35 rep and wins grant 50 rep.  At the bare minimum (assuming 1 flag cap and win every game) you'll need to play 494 games of WSG to get to Exalted.  So, assuming games are 15 minutes each, you're looking at 5.14 days of played time in order to get exalted, assuming you dont lose any games and get 1 flag cap per game.
---
So, as I was saying, it's a LOT harder to get to exalted in WSG.
---
It will "eventually" turn a profit, so it's money now vs money later. At 500 gold I'd buy it and level an alt to 35 because that will pay for itself relatively quickly. At 1000+ though I definitely start to question it. I saw an average price of 2500 at one point, that takes like half a year to pay for itself at a good price, and I'd rather make money on 2500 gold I already have in my pocket some other way.
---
No.  I just don't understand these kinds of post or why they get upvoted so commonly.
---
Most servers are fine, you're just not going to see the thousands of people playing them how fine they are. You're only really going to see the people with problems making threads.
---
Classic servers will naturally gradually lose players as more people lose interest in the game, but I think the biggest exodus has already happened between the people that are sick of MC/Ony and those that are sick of getting ganked.
---
We need a thread for posting in game pics
---
Damn, he must have just popped perception
---
It's been affecting reagent prices too. Black lotus was *never* this expensive on my server in vanilla. I used to pop like 3-4 flasks per week for raids and it wasn't a huge financial drain. Now that means farming like 500g/week. It's doable, but I don't particularly enjoy farming (what's fun about soloing the lashers in DM:E, logging out, waiting 5 minutes, logging back in at the beginning of the instance, resetting, and repeating?).
---
Granted, my server back in vanilla wasn't huge, but we only had like 200-300 active raiders on each faction. There were like 3-5 raiding guilds on each side and none of them did multiple 40-man raids per week (like multiple MC groups).
---
Unpopular opinion: they should just cap all the servers to 3k and let people xfer if they don't like the queues. The game would be MUCH better in the long run.
---
are you sure? because last i checked alliance seems to dominate wpvp, why would they be leaving?
---
What spec are you? This video shows how to solo DM east as a warlock, it might work as a druid if you have points in balance and some decent int/spellpower gear. I'm HOTW/NS spec and I just do DM East stealth herb runs. https://youtu.be/LfspmZBGkWo
---
&gt; but 60 would be boring right?  
---
tbh just wanted to test my new finished twink 
---
this is true
---
I mean it’s general drainage. A game like classic is recycled content, there’s really no growth to be had. You’ll get the veterans that go back to what they missed, but they’re part of that original player base number so that doesn’t count as growth. You might rope in some retail players who started post cata, but overall, you’re looking at a game that can only dwindle in membership now that they initial awe has worn off. 
---
Progression will continue and people will, like always, stay while they’re entertained. But eventually people will run out of things to do, something that’s already happening that you might’ve heard as “raid logging” aka only logging in once or twice a week to raid. 
---
But servers won’t just simply die, and retail certainly won’t kill them. At best, Shadowlands comes out, people hop back onto their retail chars, hit max level really quickly and then probably come right back to classic.
---
Nice
---
no it did not
---
Until you get windfury, it's rockbiter solo and flametongue when you're dpsing in dungeons.
---
My understanding is that Seal of Command (and other proc-per-minute effects) essentially have a variable chance to proc on hit based on weapon speed (`PPM * speed / 60`). It will *average* a certain number of procs per minute, but this is not a hard and fast rule- there is no "quota" that you can consume.
---
That's why you follow up WotF with your PvP trinket! And then, if they still try to Fear you, ya gotta hit 'em with the Ice Block, then your second, backup Ice Block if absolutely necessary.
---
Not sure on your particular server, but best places to look for a guild are generally pug MC/Ony runs, and/or the server discord if you have one. My server, Benediction, has a good bit of both, so I'd assume Thunderfury has something similar.
---
1g 6s 1c
---
Oh damn that's crazy!
---
Well we didn't have threat meters back then, and we also didn't encourage tanks to gear for threat (e.g. Head of Ony turn in for the necklace).  I guess I have a month or two to develop...what's that foreign concept...restraint? in watching the threat meters.
---
This depends on a lot, so no one can really say.  
---
They're very good though, for a number of reasons, so don't undersell them.
---
Then what is? New to this game sorry
---
I bet he also calls Deadmines VC
---
OP deserves what he gets for this ^/s
---
As a “So I started blasting”warlock, I run to where the tank would stand and wait. Usually I soul stone myself and accept my fate.
---
I understand this doesn’t work for all guilds doing ONY as soul stone should be on a healer.
---
Eh.. at most you could use it to see how big is the raid your up against. And maybe use it to try and easily pick out who the enemy healers are. I almost never benefit from it in medium-large group pvp.
---
Why would there be clusters?  There's not enough servers to make battleground outside of the NA, EU, etc. servers.
---
Basically it’s about not spending money. Literally only spend money on the bare necessities: leveling up your core skills (the ones you use most while leveling not all of them) and food and water. Don’t level your professions, don’t buy any gear etc. The money will come in as you level up from quests and drops. Sell everything you can and be frugal with spending.
---
I got mine in 1 rend run, so that would be the fastest.
---
Good point
---
DKP is a system where the person with the most has priority. If person A only has to spend on weapons, and Person B has to spend on Weapons, and armor, then Person A will essentially always have priority on Weapons.
---
I guess it will either happen or it won't.
---
That's the point, most of them were and still are no lifes.
---
So.... This is basicly a 'yes', right?
---
The macro stops executing if it finds a *first* suitable condition. So this macro will always cast Backstab (only in stealth) and never Ambush. And Gouge will be cast only when not in stealth.
---
Sorry I confused it with Blowme. Mb. It does seem Grob has a rly strong faction balance. Good to know
---
I love how everyone has the exact same defense of their hypocrisy, as if world pvp is impossible without having every advantage other people have.
---
Hmm seems rather limited for this situation then. Ty
---
I have Spy and originally used it as a way to keep track of the horde who gank me with the KOS list.  Now I use it to instantly mount and run when I’m doing solo stuff and get a notification. The OP function is being able to click on the notification and target the player. With this function if you’re a lock or a hunter you can just send your pet to attack them which leads you right to their location.
---
Don't worry about min/maxing and play what you want.
---
That being said, Warrior is probably the slowest class to level.  That's not to say you shouldn't play it, but just be prepared for much more of a grind than other players.
---
Your guild shouldn't be allowing orc warriors to roll on swords. If you have 7-8 meme race fury warriors then idk what to tell ya
---
All my heals are on macros, mostly to cancelform.
---
* Decurse/poison macro = cancelform, cast remove curse or abolish poison (when mod:shift)
---
* Rejuv/Regrowth macro = cancelform, rejuv or regrowth (when mod:shift)
---
* Heal 3 macro = cancelform, cast healing touch 3 plus modifiers to cast HT4, HT5, HT6 - I have a similar macro for HT11 but going down
---
* Cancel macro = cancelform or dismount or mount (when mod:shift)
---
Yeah I'm not a fan either. That's why I said "fuck it" and rolled an Orc for my resto shaman.
---
Omg he's so cute!
---
run strat live with orbs round robin, get 4 of them in a few runs if you're lucky, crusader them both &amp; buy your devilsaur set THEN go for epic mount imo. Even in a casual guild I'd still prioritize big ticket items like viskag/brut blade to a melee showing he's putting in the effort to better the guild/raid by bettering their gear. Outside of getting the pre-bis drops you need devilsaur/crusader is the best way to improve your dps
---
4/8 t1 on one night as warrior tank
---
It's a dumb/trash addon, you should be attacking everyone anyways on a PvP server.
---
It truly does not serve a purpose.
---
Attack everything!
---
No i meant weapon, I just thought it wasn't out yet.
---
Yeah but Person A has no raid gear so they want the weapons. Person B is receiving gear, so they both get something. You can't control what other players do with their points, but by not rolling on any gear you're receiving more gear, you just don't have as much of a chance at getting weapons. I would just switch to daggers if it was me.
---
&gt; When you say "LF3M XYZ any role /w" you'd be shocked at how fast groups fill up :P
---
In my experience it doesn't matter the rest of your group comp but as soon as people see you have a tank the rest fills up in about 3 seconds
---
Got the Savage Gladiator Chain lvl 54, Hand of Justice in lvl 56
---
They prevented Spy users from knowing about already stealthed players in a 50 yard range.  They literally hid two classes ability to hide from the addon.  World pvp conquered!
---
Glad to hear it man. I went to Earthfury from Blam and it seems like it’ll be way better for what I’m looking for from this game.
---
I avoided it until 60. As a hunter I was tracking some  alliance in a building and stalking outside. Little gnome warlock walks outside and I target him to start up a sweet aimed shot. *He has already got me targeted*. Instantly 360 death coils me and I'm sure you know the rest. Downloaded spy instantly and can confirm, it was super broken. As a hunter if I could target you, if only for a second, I could send my pet in after you and there was nothing you could do to not be found. Even stealth.
---
Stephen A. Smith?
---
&gt;but the real winner of P3 is Maladath 
---
IDK, +4 swords is not enough. +5 is just such a huge jump in weapon skill value.  
---
&gt; Weapon dps is not very important for tank threat. 
---
It is pretty important, actually, cause it's the only way for warrior tanks to scale.
---
gph for orbs in strat live kinda sucks.  Tanked it last night for a guild group that knew the run.  Even skipping Fras that's a good 45 minutes and we only saw 1 orb drop which we all rolled since it was guild.  
---
I don't think I would want to tank that for a pug.
---
They’re almost 1k on my server.
---
Gauge your market, none of us know what your realm’s economy is like.
---
I guess I misunderstood your comment.
---
Yeah, I would. One, these are rarely used to weed out people with "shit" gear so much as "not in full purples/used something other than BIS/I don't like how they spent 5 of their points." It's not protecting your group from crap players, it's gatekeeping. Can you do that? Yes. But I'd rather go to the instance and be kicked because unless it's a guild run and I'm the last pug, the rest of the people at the instance line are going to be pissed that they have to wait longer, and start questioning why the party lead is kicking viable players.
---
Lvl60 ele/resto shaman here. farmed my pvp gear, now how do I learn how to play? Pvp is hard
---
Well then as long as you keep attending raids you're waiting on what, 3 weapons to drop?
---
That's not half bad. Try rolling against every healer and spell caster in the raid for +healing/spellpower gear.
---
I think people are expecting to get loot too consistently these days. I remember going months without an upgrade back in the day.
---
I think mostly it comes from the idea that the hardcore/long lasting players will tend to migrate more towards a high/full population server; for the exact reason of fear of server pop death. Where that comes from, I'd say, is that wow has always had a huge fluctuation in player numbers. However, I think a major culprit of this is the fact that Blizzard does not actually reveal player numbers per server. We get; low, medium, high and full. But what is the actual numerical value/values of each. For all we know a medium population can be anywhere from 5 - 7 thousand players. I believe I read somewhere that the server cap has an educated estimate of about 10 thousand players. I believe people would have been more willing to spread out across servers in the beginning of we were given estimate numbers players along with the; low, medium, high, full population values.
---
Forgive me Lord, for I have Sinister Struck.
---
You got 60 in less than half /played as me. It took me 10 days played as a priest.
---
I honestly feel sorry for you.
---
First off, Mind Soothe does nothing against other players - only NPCs.
---
Second,  any action taken against another player in view of city guards triggers their response - even something that does no damage like a polymorph or fear.
---
(Priest) I want a mousover to cast Power Word:Fortitude on mouseover and whisper to that target "Good luck".
---
Currently using:
---
/cast \[@mouseover\] Power Word: Fortitude /run if UnitExists"target"then SendChatMessage(“Good luck”,”WHISPER",nil,UnitName"target")end
---
There are literally 2 drops in the entirety of MC that are for strictly for DPS warriors. We spend hours upon hours of raiding for the rest of the guild to get geared. Might does nothing for us, so yes, we will want the swords. We will spend the DKP on Band if Accuria, Onslaught or plate gloves (I forget the name) when they drop no doubt, and have to compete against 5-8 other DPS warriors for these items. And what guilds are making their their warriors Lionheart for free? Sounds nice.. 
---
Go buy a Krol blade and wait your turn..
---
30-60 mins from Thorium POint to BRD is nothing
---
Right but if you're in a quicker fight that is also a good thing.  You don't want the pet returning with unused charges of flurry.
---
I see, thank you for breaking it down so cleanly, that made it relatively easy to understand. I'm not sure WSG is one I'll be going for unless I fall in love with PvP, don't think I can make that decision until I've at least tried it. 
---
Thanks for the help though, I'm gonna do some more research on them so I'm prepared when they drop. It does sound amazing to have something else to do. Thanks again!
---
lol yeah it's a bit rough
---
The timer on Shaman weapon enhancements gets increased to 30 minutes in TBC, at least.
---
Similar situation with us. We wiped NINE TIMES that night, it was the last attempt of the night, and we finally got him.
---
I was the tank for that final few percent. I was sweating and shaking.
---
Did you get that from a streamer?  Along with what to play and why?
---
How much does Catseye Elixir actually help? I'll see a rogue unstealthed, pop it, then he stealths and I can still never see him until I get jumped. He can't be higher level than me since I'm 60.
---
Brother Sarno : "Excuse me Sir, do you have a moment to talk about the light?"  
---
Rogue : Uhh!?!!!  
---
Brother Sarno : "Here, please take this pamphlet..."  
---
Rogue : [sprint]
---
Really fun to level and OP in PvP and cheaper mounts
---
I definitely have noticed that Furor takes a moment to proc when going into bear form but it procs instantly going into cat form. I don't think you'll be able to to go straight back to caster with a macro after the feral charge because the game will probably try to cancelaura while you're still mid charge.
---
Probably, fixes break other functionality, but now we can world pvp!
---
I know it doesn't, it's more of a "up yours too" move when mages cast detect magic on me.
---
Imagine complaint about 40 runs for savage glad. I did 125+ runs for HOJ, and have never seen savage glad
---
Start running ZF and you will get some insane ele gear. That being said, if you don't have the staff from SM then you might have a tough time. There is a +healing dagger that drops in ZF that could be good with your shield. 
---
I re specd ele at 43 and love it. Way better DPS and better gear for healing.
---
You do realize that both of those realms have 60-300 minute queues right? I'd choose something else.
---
Thanks a lot man. This was what I was looking for. Edgemaster also drops hit cap to %6 for axes right?
---
Hey I just uploaded first World Pvp video/clip comedy.
---
Just came to point this out.
---
Not classic but my buddy got me into wow during wod and I learned about cool mounts. I watched a video on where to go to fight the boss that drops ashes of alara and I got it on the first try. It's been all downhill since.
---

---
I’m trying to find a macro that will have Felhunter use Devour magic on myself without losing target on my enemy, is this possible?
---
I didn't include commute, chores, groceries, etc because those are going to differ quite a bit from person to person.
---
&gt;This doesn't even factor in the fact that life on the big servers (where most top guilds are)
---
I think this is where people are getting hung up on your argument.  When you say "top guild" you are talking about top guilds for the GAME as a whole, not the top guilds on a particular SERVER.  And in that case, I'm no expert -- Based on your other comments, I will assume that you are in one and will defer to your knowledge of time needed to prep.
---
&gt;I mean, are you grinding for gold during your lunch hours too? Since that doesn't count towards your 40 hour work week?
---
If you count playing the auction house, then yes!  I actually take my lunch during work hours most days.  I think thats fairly typical for a 9-5 job.
---
Alright, so below I will detail out a typical week for a hardcore player working a full time job:
---
**M-F** 
---
Wake at 7:30am, Get ready for day and leave at 8:30am, Work from 9am to 5pm, Arrive home at 5:30pm, Cook dinner and eat, Play WoW 6:30pm to 12am.
---
*This totals 27.5 hours of game time during the week.  If you meal prep or choose to lose sleep, this time can be extended further.*
---
**Weekend**
---
Wake at 9am, Get ready for day and do whatever until 1pm, Play WoW 1pm to 12am.
---
*This totals 22 hours of game time on the weekend, and allows for 8 hours worth of chores, meal prep, whatever.*
---
The above example gives you 50 hours worth of WoW time with a fulltime job and getting roughly 8 hours of sleep every night.  Additional passive gold income from buying and selling in AH can further reduce time needed to farm.  For this phase of the game, we likely don't need 40+ hours of farming to earn our consumables for the week.  If we are using that time to stockpile, it will help us when BWL, AQ, ZG, and Naxx arrive.
---
How much gold per week are you spending on consumables for MC and Ony?  Just curious because 40+ hours of farming should be netting you at least 600 gold per week.  Are you really chugging through that much??
---
#bruh
---
Like a Priest who continues preaching in the church with an active shooter in the building.
---
I’ve been debating a lot between tribal and Dragonscale. Dragonscale has more I can use, mainly I would go tribal only for the gold. I’m also on different timezone than most people in my server so potentially less competition when farming devilsaurs. I’ll have to think more about it
---
I also read somewhere that the pant rewards are not in the game until Phase 6.  Now, with them flipping the schedule around it's possible that isnt accurate anymore but yeah.  I'm planning to PVP lots but exalted with WSG isnt very high on my list.
---
Kill trading would be bannable, probably, as it is a cross factional out of game thing that subverts game mechanics.  They typically discourage this sort of thing, especially when you are literally calling it honor trading or kill exchanging.
---
But, setting up battles with 5v5 or 10v10 in a certain zone with people on the forums would probably be ok.
---
Like getting a group and having each person just go through the line killing solo 5 times, down the line would be honor trading, and probably bad.  Whether anyone would care enough to get in trouble? I don't know.
---
Like.. don't be so overt about it man.
---
If it's so much better than why wouldn't the creators of spy just lessen the range by design?
---
No I got my mount at around 52. Travel form was good enough for me.
---
Maybe you should work on your amger issues if you ragequit aftet being killed once?
---
Doesn't seem that healthy.
---
on alliance dominated servers alliance are literally /dancing ontop of org bank no joke.
---
Warriors also use daggers.
---
I'm full T1/2 moonglow/balance. It's not actually as much spell power as I may need, but it's a ton of mp5 so I may be fine
---
Guilds with a shit loot system will bleed players. Classic content isn't too difficult, but if you keep resetting to players in MC gear/blues, you will not clear the harder content.
---
He pays some sad schmuck to make and release them. You just interpreted my "pumping out" however you felt like.
---
For what? Making an addon relying on an API and information officially provided by Blizzard? That wouldn't stand in any court.
---
Paid addons on the other hand clearly go against their ToS.
---
The only thing Blizzard can do to break Spy more is to restrict the data put into the combat log further. Which again would impact a lot of other addons as well.
---
My point is that if I am upset, as you claim, then you must be aswell by your own reasoning. Condescending tone and hypocricy isn't a good luck on you
---
More importantly, if the OT somehow does not get threat as P3 begins, whoever does have it needs to move their ass to the front (where the tank stands) so she doesn't breathe on the whole raid.  As long as enough healers and a tank are up, you can white damage her to death so dps can die safely during the transition and it won't matter to anything outside of your warcraftlogs parse.
---
You can also just buy one.
---
Yeah horde expandanld and dumb, you don't have to do alot when you outnumber us by 30 percent
---
I was leaning more towards Dragonscale for the blue Dragonscale gear for myself. I’ve done the wild leather quests that don’t require turtle scales anyway since it’s easy xp for items in already crafting. We have a tribal and elemental LW in the guild so might be worth to go dragon, I’ll have to look more into it
---
Because they didn’t have them planned purnfully I would assume.
---
In classic we use to have the guild leader leave the raid then loot the bosses for all the money. Idk if it works in classic but it's an easy way if it works.
---
grats bro!
---
Cool then never give any money for arcanite transmutes, enchants, flask crafts, water, portals or any other thing that a person put time into to be able to do for you. See how far you get.
---
You just don't want to pay and are just doing mental gymnastics to justify it.
---
create a macro to /startattack
---
bind it to mousewheel
---
I can sometimes pop rogues out of stealth in menethil harbor by running around with catseye goggles but it's definitely not reliable and they can still sap you if they want to.
---
Yeah i am aware, but still I kinda want give it a go :)
---
Here I am on the 5th day of looking for a group to run ST with...
---
You dont need to be a dev to know they cant ban it, it works by parsing the combat log so only way to ban it is to remove the combat log.  The fix they did was shorten the range that combat log sees
---
multiboxers are the lowest form of life
---
As a "good morning" bonus, take a macro for more comfortable traveling through Azeroth:
---
`#showtooltip`
---
`/cast [swimming] Aquatic Form; [noswimming] Travel Form`
---
Now you can switch to these to forms in one button depending you are swimming or walking.
---
Indeed it does. Indeed it does.
---
Thats funny i watched a video a while ago saying tauren shaman are the most useless. But coming from a tauren shaman... war stomp has saved my life so many times and is great for pvp
---
For a fairly new player in WoW, I would recommend running two characters while you level a warrior.
---
A Warrior, and something like a Hunter or Warlock.
---
Reason being is a Warrior is difficult to level; money is incredibly tight, and in general it simply takes longer.  
---
I would level a warrior through their rested XP, and maybe some dungeons here and there; then flop back to leveling the pet class to build up rested XP on the warrior again.
---
I heard they are bis for a warrior. Trying to decide if I should hang on to them for awhile or sell now and for how much.
---
Any vids/guides you recommend on tradeskillmaster? Kinda lost with it tbf
---
Ya I paid 250g for the eye which is a good deal I could see it going for more.
---
lol
---
How do you even get 5 accounts to work on one keyboard at the same time
---
10/10
---
&gt; When any non-stealth renders in your range, you are too far away to hear anything.
---
Instance portals, Eagle Eye, Mind Vision, Sentry Totem, Eye of Kilrogg, Eyes of the Beast, Invis pots, Ritual of Summoning, Teleport, Portals, logging in...  Am I missing any?
---
Not ganna lie. Watching this with my mouth wide up. That was so awesome lol
---
I kind of like the population, but it's a double-edged sword. On the one hand the Horde is just fucking out of goddamn control, but on the other, it's really cool to have guilds that are pushing upwards of three 40-man crews in MC. I like that there's almost never a hard time getting groups together at almost every level bracket. 
---
The only difference between my vanilla experience and my classic one is that Sargeras was 100% Alliance dominated. Even then, I don't think we were as much as a nuisance as the Horde on Skeram are when it comes to basically prohibiting the other faction from getting anything done. I remember in BC there were always fights outside of the Kara entrance but it was never like, the entirety of Deadwind Pass having roaming raids littered around the choke points. 
---
The way PVP is right now, I've basically stopped playing outside of raiding. I logged out in Duskwallow last night so I could just swim to Ony with minimal corpse runs. It's a really sad state of affairs when your faction doesn't even have control over your major transportation hubs to the other continent. Imagine what a defense force the Horde would amass if we tried camping their Zeppelins.
---
Well, I've made more gold Hordeside there than I have on either Mankrik or Windseeker, so there's that. I'm only level 18 so I'm not conflicting with Ally yet so I'm pretty biased, but it seems to be a really cool server.
---
I would argue that it depends what kind of gamer you are and what do you want from the game.
---
Personnaly I love to think and thrive for min max, trying to be on top etc...
---
I don’t know what’s wrong with your crap but my 2015 iMac runs it like a dream 27” retina. My 2018 MacBook Pro is on a cooling platform but no heat issues.
---
It’s on the legion client, shards absolutely exist. Everyone is just on the same shards. Try walking between zones with a friend, it’s painfully obvious.
---
As others have pointed out, Layers and Sharding are not the same.
---
Layers are different instances of a zone.
---
Shards are different sections of the world that have invisible borders, often where two zones meet. Crossing them uses resources, and when you have 30 people doing it creates rubber banding and other client side lag.
---
That's incorrect. Multiple inline statements will stop at the first suitable condition, but the code will continue down the block.
---
For example:
---
/cast [stealth] Backstab; [stealth] Ambush; Gouge 
---
This macro will fail to cast ambush because it will stop after checking backstab, but the example in my previous post technically works fine. The big concern is whether or not WoW will block the sequence cast. Classic WoW does not allow sequence casts that proc GCDs, but it might for failed casts.
---
Sweet baby jesus THANK YOU.
---
Don’t know what kind of loot system you use, but I know my friend’s guild uses a DKP system and people can donate to bank for extra DKP. Lots of people in his guild form farming runs regularly to donate to guild bank for DKP.
---
You fish? I was in the same boat, and leveled my fishing and cooking to 300 at 36. You can catch and cook enough Winter Squid just at Steemweedle Port to buy a mount in a few days. Plus with luck get a golden pearl or 2. Sell food on Tuesdays when the raiders are scrambling.
---
Plus in Tanaris you can spam check the neutral house for Big Iron fishing poles, buy them at 2-3g and sell them for 10-15.
---
Warrior discord for more info
---
Flair checks out, huntard
---
Same exact thing for me. Only I’m Horde on Heartseeker. Get killed 1v10 about five times on my way to BRM, death squads everywhere, no flight point is safe. Constant “Ok boomer” and “go back to retail” /y spam. And the alliance complain that they’re bored, meanwhile the horde literally can’t play the game.
---
Shoot. for some reason I thought it was a little more balanced than that.
---
I honestly just love the “kill on sight list” and “ignore list.”

---
Your personal experience is not proof of sharding.
---
Layering was introduced as a replacement t for sharding. As of phase 2 all servers are down to 1 layer.
---
Sharding is not in Classic Wow.
---
Clearing MC in a pug takes 2-4 hours with no commitment other than having decent gear which you can do running a few dungeons when you have play time. 
---
You can also strictly PvP, work on making gold through farming or professions, solo farm if you’re a class that can, or do anything you want really. It’s an MMO so the essence of the game is just doing shit in a world with many other people.
---
Nah that's too small to be seen...
---
the communist party never really cared about the opinions of the peons.
---
I dunno, improved Blizzard with permafrost opens up an entire method of dealing with mobs.
---
You should have notice from this sub that the realm you choose and the faction you choose can have a huge impact on how you approach and play wPVP.
---
Plus usualy  PVP warrior are using 2H weapon spec which give 50% heal reduction on target which is kinda mandatory in PVP.
---
It's even worse for alliance. At least now, you could hypothetically get some pvp-minded alliance together to try to push back. But once BGs drop, all the alliance players interested in pvp will be in BGs (instant queues, better honor, fairer fights), so they'll be nobody to help. It'll just be random questers or people running dungeons and that's it.
---
Ah man. Just be careful and you’ll be alright 😃
---
&gt; not that I think you'll ever have aggro as spriest
---
Spriests generate a lot of threat. Our strategy actually relies on me (spriest) taking aggro just as p2 starts so our MT doesn't get fireballed.
---
Sell mats you have no use for of course. 
---
Second to that do onyxia gold bid on bag, but honestly all the random blues greens tier1(that people don't need, should start happening soon) and mats should all sell for enough to cover shit like flasks on tanks.
---
litterally no one thinks of it that way
---
and as you say, its the intent that matters
---
Well, the easiest way is selling off mats. Although, it is suboptimal.
---
Another option is just doing a straight up 2g raiders fee p/w to fund it, but it might tick people off.
---
TLDR : I like cheating. It makes me feel powerful.

---
seems like the only mistake i made was joining a guild that';s too heavy on melee dps. We are good. We kill rag in 1 phase despite half the people in all blues. But now I have to choose. Guild that is good or ever getting raid gear.
---
Right now I'm over a month without a single piece of raid gear.
---
calling it now someone will ninja your loot next week, and there will be a reddit post to go along with it.
---
Why would they have prioritized fixing a bug that doesn't affect gameplay?
---
It will be fine for Rogue's. Visual range is now further than Spy. A Rogue player could make visual confirmation and enter stealth without ever being in the range of Spy.

I play horde on a pve realm. I love BGs but I hate world pvp (there is always someone not ready for a pvp encounter). I want quick bg queues

So something like this? Obvi with the majority of the demonic talents being irrelevant.

You won't play long enough or keep up with the transmutes long enough to ever justify keeping it if someone is willing to buy now for a nice price. It's a white elephant.

I don't think a new wow player should "try to be on top"
---
I use /stopcasting on MB 5 to cancel overheals.   However, since I use mouseover macros i'm constantly hovering over raidframes. 
---
/stopcasting doesn't work when hovering raidframes - it works the rest of the time though. 
---
Any suggestions
---
Shouldn't it be your a mage and the 60 is a hunter?
---
Does that actually work well? Dps and Mana wise?
---
I mean good policy to keep it up as much as possible in WPVP. Ultimately though, a Rogue can now see you before Spy can pick them up. The majority of them will be entering stealth outside of Spy's range.
---
be high on the threat meter during p2 so you get fireballed
---
That true but that can be a long term objective
---
Orloham sees all.
---
What short phases? Phase 2 came out on time. I don’t see  phase 3 coming anytime soon.
---
I believe the way it worked before (I have no development skill, please correct me if I’m wrong) is that when the client side picks up a player that enters render distance it has to apply all the buffs, including stealth all at once. So if a horde rogue on the server walks into an alliance players render distance, the alliance players client first says “there is a rogue at the edge of render distance, rogue applies stealth and all other buffs at once, then disappears from the alliance players clients radar, but has already been spotted by the combat log and SPY

My thoughts, just enjoy it as long as I can and try not to worry too much about the future of it. In the end they will end up doing what most of the community wants anyways (rushing dire maul, BGs, etc). Those of us who don't want that stuff so soon are the vocal minority, so just enjoy this experience while it lasts friend.
---
Lmao, you think that imbalanced queues will change the current world camping?  If the majority of horde aren't able to pvp for 20-30 minutes between battlegrounds, they will go hunting and make the world even worse.  You think it's bad now?
---
Imagine those huge BRM battles that are currently happening.  Once BGs are released, they aren't going to farm BRM, they will be in AV and WSG.  So you remove the alliance PvPers from the mountain, from all zones.  But you didn't pull all the horde.  So they will be sitting around twiddling their thumbs?  That makes them fall behind in honor when other people are hunting between BGs.  If anything, only faction battlegrounds will result in any in-world alliance being unable to quest, period.
---
Can multibox but can’t screen record
---
I finally started using **DBM** last week, and omg it’s straight  hacks. Literally the wow community can't even see themselves in the mirror...
---
Was hoping someone would make this comment 🌹
---
Don't think they changed anything regarding what aggros guards,  just increased the range at which those actions would aggro guards to combat people safe-spotting
---
It doesn't help when they see you running up to LBRS/UBRS so they MC you and make you jump down into the lava.
---
With MC, it is absolutely possible to literally prevent a player from ever, ever reaching the instance, no matter how many times they die.
---
No i have no use for that knowlegde. What do you do with the knowlegde that 10 horde players are comming towards you? You hide? You're gonna die either way. I just don't think it's an advantage for any good player. Lets say im going to BRD and run into BRM, around the corner is 10 horde hiding. Now with your addon i can see them. Great, now what? It's not like it improve my skill so i still can't get into BRM. The next step is to back off but that still won't get me into BRM?  
---
Could you please give me a situation where a good player actually gains a huge advantage from this? I mean knowing a rogue is stealthing around you is nice. But it's not gonna change the outcome of a mage blinking as soon as he cheapshots hopefully ? I guess you could flare as a hunter and change stance as a warrior but you should already be in zerk or maybe def stance and as hunter you shouldt die to a rogue in 1 stunlock session. IDK im just rambling at this point. But i hope you catch my drift?
---
If it stays at a constant price, which it won't.
---
i don't know what's worse. him opening with sap and waiting 10 seconds to actually cheap shot or you ice blocking halfway through cheap shot instead of blinking
---
In 8 clears of MC and only seen like 4 pieces of holy pally gear drop. Won one of them. Super frustrating
---
Spy gives anyone who uses it a level of awareness that traditionally only a small fraction of the pvp population has.
---
No real way around it, it fundamentally changes pvp. People defending Spy simply don’t want to give up the massive, unnatural advantage it provides.
---
How do you zoom out that far? Looks way beyond what the game offers!
---
i do the opposite, make sure i'm super high on threat in p1 so during p2 i get fireballed and dont gotta worry about threat in p3
---
i haven't pulled ony threat in ~20 kills
---
Not easily obtained anymore after the roaming pvp packs camping ungoro mountain
---
Shadow priests are absurd. Can fear and dot you for a free kill while being hard to kill themselves.
---
&gt;4.The range nerf was good. It shouldnt detect people outside of render
---
Two days ago, I was deep in the yeti cave, killing my way out. Out of nowhere a rogue curb stomps me. its pretty likely he was using the addon, at 430am server there was no reason to expect someone down in the cave. all the mobs had respawned. I am very happy the range was reduced.
---
This is a good buff, it will help me even more against rogues, I will know they stealthed even closer to me than before and I can be even more alert when I get the noise from spy.
---
Like literally every end raid boss
---
lol shut up
---
Yeah then that is just really odd lol
---
/sigh
---
I really wish people would stop pretending classic offers challenging content that requires emulating 'progression' raiding guilds.  Every raid is going to be stomped. Outside of a select few bosses that might take a little bit of practice, most guilds will have no problem full clearing all content in the game.
---
There is no reason to require your raid to use any kind of addon. IF anything you should encourage them not to, and push the limits of what you can accomplish without min-maxing everything.
---
Epic facepalm bro.
---
You're assuming the market won't get flooded by like minded people, a week ago I was selling golden pearls for 120g each, now its back down to 39 because some idiot flooded the market. Of course I bought half of them and have them in my bank til they're rarity rises again
---
That's what the upvote button is for
---
Thats counter productive to your desire.
---
Software
---
Some Kazz' on 'Kazz' action! xD
---
These were things that used to be in the game in the early days. But were removed because PVPers complained that dishonor among players made it so they couldn’t play the way they wanted to. 
---
While I can sympathize to an extent, if you have an incentive for killing players you need an equal risk to balance it out. Maybe instead of dishonor for lowbie kills maybe dying loses you honor depending on the honor of your assailant (ie if someone of much higher honor kills you then you don’t lost much if any honor, if someone of much lower honor kills you then you lose more honor). 
---
Because right now there is zero risk for people who roll around in death balls and zero incentive for people to fight back rather than just quit until dec 10th.
---
You mean designated driver?
---
Or when you would see copper nodes on the other side of the river in the barrens. Then you cross the river and they disappear in front of you. Hated that shit
---
As a "well paid engineer" in the software development industry, let me tell you that this isnt an issue of ability but priorities and budget.
---
If you come over to my desk and tell me "Hey can you change that value in that config file from 200 to 50?" I'll gladly tell you "Sure, should only take a minute!".
---
If you come over and suggest something deeper, like changing combat log behavior than that I'll probably tell you to come back later when I am less busy with more pressing matters aka my current priorities. Of course, if a higher up shows up and confirms that this is the new priority, I'll likely reluctantly take a break from my current task. By the way, that is bad management.
---
I dont know why people expect Classic to be a priority for Blizzard right now. It runs itself. Its a nice little boost of income for them until Shadowlands comes out.
---
Or a troll
---
nope
---
Lol, they helped you fair and square but have to pay for helms wth?
---
Huh? I thought it was only spy that was ruining world pvp? Strange.
---
I'm ally on Skeram and I would recommend it with caveats.  The Alliance community is super close knit and you'll recognize players all the time.  You will also be doing random dungeons with super skilled players as we have a lot of top end guilds on our server.  However there are significantly down sides as well.  Way more horde then alliance so unless you are trying to min/max honor this is a huge downside.  Watch decent into hell for a veiw of it.  However I will say again it helps the server balance to have more ally join and our community is super fun.  From fishing tournaments to costume contests there always something going on.
---
hmm it really depends what lvl you are and what the grp comp is. if you have nightfall put corruption up on each target and sbolt the mob down bt if your grp is aoeing wait for the mage to cone of cold and nova then u can just hellfire. if you're a lower lvl like sub 40 then dont dot the packs just sbolt or wand and aoe if you have a mage
---
they go for around 400-500 on my realm
---
Whenever I tried gaming at the time (fortnite) on my 2020, you could hear the fans going crazy and would black screen after about 20 minutes
---
That’s actually a pretty good screenshot. Like if they end up making posters of what each phase was like. This just says it all.
---
So are we now banning anything that gives you an advantage in PVP.
---
Have to get rid of those enemy cast bars, CC timers, swing timers, etc.
---
Am I missing something or does it not come in Nature's Wrath flavor?
---
Orcs using axes is extremely common. Tons of people buy axe of the deep woods and flurry axe as their starter weapons.
---
You got massively outplayed in this video and you're saying other people don't know how pvp works, that's rich.
---
Hm, ok it sounds like I should just go with the standard SL/nightfall. Looking forward to it!
---
AV Exalted is easy enough to farm. A person can do that from 0 in a single weekend of heavy play. Two weekend more casually. Rewards are excellent for most classes.
---
You're right about WSG/AB rewards though. Those take absolute ages to do.
---
We are talking about wow classic not fortnite...
---
Make sure to ask people to loot the dragons
---
I did! And yes I do. I am lvl 57 with 424g after having made biznicks. Probably not the best way to spend gold, but I’m happy with it.
---
If you did it manually yes but there was an add on that spy used to make it continue to follow them. I’ve seen it done
---
Probably 200.  
---
[Here is a post from 2007](https://forum.rpg.net/index.php?threads/wow-wow-webstats-a-dps-meter.324677/) showing how you can set the range of the combat log to 200.
---
According to wiki, goggles are +18 and potion is +10 (each 5 is one character level).
---
Congrats! That's one of my favorite bows and definitely one of the most nostalgic. Used to see SO many hunters running around with that thing, now I feel like I see so many rhokdelar xd
---
Yup I have nightfalls. So I guess I’ll do corruption on all the mobs then take them down one at a time
---
What server is that?
---
As a tank, sure you can dot up all 5 mobs if you want. if you want to tank them. If you don't feel like tanking you should stick to single target. If there's 2 mobs, maybe throw a corruption on both for nightfall procs. DPS is irrelevant in dungeons unless you're failing to kill stuff and all that going balls to the wall with AOE is going to do is frustrate your tank.
---
Lol this is so cringey
---
I was thinking more about the honor system rewards. I honestly doubt I'll need anything that AV offers by the time it's available but it's true that people can actually get those.
---
The start of the game is both the best and worst for player retention.  Leveling is one of the move time consuming processes, so players have plenty to do, but once they finish leveling there is the least to do.  THere are dungeons and then MC/ONY.  While there is an objective in place, dungeons work perfectly fine, but you can only do them for so long before you want something new.  MC/Ony give something new, but it's both very easy and requires a bunch of people.  Some players won't find a group they want to ply with and likely quit.  Others will quickly realize doing MC/Ony for maybe 2 hours a week is still to much dead time and quit.
---
These themselves aren't a huge problem.  The bigger problem is that there is not going to be another big wave f people joining the game.  When it was new, vanilla had a pretty good growth rate all the way through Wrath.  New players were coming and replacing those who quit.  Classic probably isn't going to get a big wave of players except at the release of new raids, even then it's more likely to be the return of previous players.
---
The issue is if low/med servers have enough players who will stick through everything to sustain the servers through the low times.  Going to a high pop server gives you the best chance and that's why players have done it historically.
---
my guild does a weekly 10g tax. it funds everything.
---
If you are a raider - you pay 10g/week
---
Liar! It says 713 victories
---
The rise of twinks will probably make it a thing.
---
At least the *deadmines* confusion is over. It's VC for Van Cleef people!
---
Which in turn makes damage/healing meters not work correctly if your group is spread out. Also confuses my dot timer if I outrange the 50 yard range while my dot is ticking
---
was lucky to get this myself as a world drop. On grob, undeath 80s and waters go 18-22g. Lets say 15g a day. It only takes 10 weeks to break 1000g. Its funded a ton of my twink gear and epic mount.
---
Y'all wanted Vanilla WoW. Well, here's Vanilla WoW.
---
Typical Alliance behaviour
---
i do, i have MiksScrollingBattleText so these things just scroll on my screen. I'm positive there arent any auto shots.
---
Technically they can detect what's on your addons folder.
---
What they can't *reasonably* do is try to ban every specific addon that uses these specific features to create this specific effect. They could attempt to do algorithmic detection the way virus scanners do but that's extremely difficult to implement and likely to lead to both false positives (punishing innocent players) and false negatives (letting rule breakers get away with it).
---
It'd be a ton of work to implement a bad policy that would be confusing to players and difficult to enforce.
---
Which is why they've literally never "banned" an addon in the entire history of the game. They restrict or modify the API if they don't like how something affects the game. And when addon authors violate their policies by doing things like selling addons, they go after those individuals doing the selling, not any players using the addon.
---
Motherfucker. I saw a Ring of Spell Power, Lock Shoulders, Lock Bracers, and Azuresong last night on my first MC raid and missed the roll on all of them.
---
Arcanite transmute is a 2 day cooldown. UD-&gt;Water is 1 day.
---
Classic has been great fun so far, it has been successful. Just because you wanted something different, doesn't mean Blizz was wrong or should have paid better attention to what private servers did. They delivered  upon the expectations they set... except for how phase 2 was weirdly rolled out, but whatever. It isnt something to drama about.
---
They said it wouldn’t affect text logs used for raid parses, this means that’s worldoflogs data will still be accurate but Details! and Recount will likely not be as accurate anymore.
---
DPS meter addons use the in game combat log whereas worldoflogs does not. Worldoflogs uses a text file based combat log that is stored in the world of Warcraft root file that is separate from the in game combat log and tracks a much wider variety of things when compared to the in game combat log.
---
If you have MC/Ony on farm then you're ready for BWL.
---
It's always had an issue with larger mobs because larger mobs have awkward hitboxes and you need to make sure their hitbox is within range.
---
Sell the mats. But probably better to skip the flask and focus on fixing the tanks health problem now. Flask is just a crutch. 
---
What’s the tanks FR on rag? FR gear enchanted well? How about using Lung Juice from blasted lands? Stam food, rumsey rum or grog? That HP adds up well and is all very cheap. If the tank has a solid HP pool and good FR then it’s time to look at your healers and work on their assignments / execution. 
---
TLDR fix the real problem, forget the flask, if rag is tough then BWL is tougher!
---
You mean you need to be within melee range of all targets? Working as intended.
---
I get it man, you’re just an Apple warrior. I’ve explained all I need to. Have a good day.
---
He set a difficult goal and reached it. That makes him/her happy and share it with us. Him being happy makes us happy.
---
not sure what you mean by up to+13 no piece of gear will say that. some pieces of gear have a random enchant of spell power and when that item drops it can be from say 11-21 spell power. just an example. as for stat prio spell power/shadow damage are always priority. it should go spell power&gt;stam&gt;int. this prio is for pve ofc and sometimes when ur lvling its useful to have stam and int for pvp or big pulls. but if youre just ez killing shadow dmg is the best because it gives u more sustain and more dmg therefore more hp and more mana because u used less.
---
The game isn't nearly as fun for me anymore. Once I hit 60, I did SOME grinding for BiS gear, but the groups disappeared quickly. We killed Ony around 8:30 server last night. Went back to IF expecting to see LFG popping. Nothing. I can't even get an LBRS/UBRS run in to get the trinket. My guild is all super geared, so it's frustrating being the lone guy still needing runs. My experience with pugs has been nothing short of disastrous, so I'm just leveling a warrior instead of doing anything on my level 60 warlock.
---
I've been 60 for longer, still haven't bought a mount. I don't see what the big deal about mounts is. You play the game to waste time, nothing is so important that you have to get there 20% faster than travel form. Or even 60% faster than running. I'd rather spend the cash on a Hide of the Wild, Stoneshield Cloak (or w/e the 6 stam, 194 armor cloak is called), or Pristine Hide of the Beast.
---
If you are drain tanking(speced affli up to Dark Pact) then I would go full shadow damage as much as you can. Get the dreamweave set along with parts of shadowweave. They will last you well up to 60 when you start replacing them with pre-bis. You should get enough int/stam from other parts of the gear to not go oom too quickly and to tank through a couple of mobs.
---
With Dark Pact you should have pretty much no down time between pulls.
---
Use the succubus with autocasting turned off and drain her mana when needed.
---
Note: Int in Classic does not provide any spell damage. Only mana and a bit of crit.
---
Kurinaxx represent. Killed you trying to get into onyxia’s lair last night. Grats on the mace!
---
That’s a good deal on that pattern, my server it was going for &gt;50g
---
Don’t wanna be a downer to your happiness. But it’s not even a max roll drakstone :/ awkward
---
4, But in large group PvP, that's not the biggest deal as you want to get in 36 yard range, throw it into a crowd preferably at a target ~50% health to get the pick, then back off so you don't get focused by other ranged DPS.  Generally with a grounding totem, the 1.5 second cast time give you enough of a window to cast and get out of range without any chance of getting retaliated against.  Maybe the occasional multi shot -- but with over 4-4.5k armor, its doing absolutely no damage to you with a 4k+ health pool when CL itself crits for 1600.
---
First boss is the hardest, I really am wondering if it will be a cake walk or a wipe fest.
---
I have the exact opposite, blade flurry seems to reach far beyond what i thought it was supposed to, ontop of that i seen to be able to ride my mount way too far into areas i shouldnt be able to - far, far up blackrock mountain burning steppes side - all the way into the FP in stormwind and into stormwind chapel aswell.. also energy regen seems to only regen every 2 seconds-ish, which is very weird. Theres alot of stuff, very miniscule but alltogether it adds up
---
Does anyone else recognize any of this?
---
D. All of the above
---
Same on gehennas, prob 65-35 in numbers but that doesnt matter since most of horde is braindead
---
Unfortunately I play a class who heavily benefits from a full tier 1. No chance of that happening by BWL release due to needing 6 more pieces and not being the only one who needs the same items. Same with currently available t2, no chance of getting either before p3. Basically leaves me in a smattering of blues and random purps in p3.
---
You’re not even good at pvp bro. Stfu
---
You spam Life tap and die, then Soulstone resurrect. We call this "Improved Feign Death".
---
Yes, in a raid setting details wont pick everything, confirmed last night.  The combat log is the same so external parsing still works.
---
Not suspicious that a mage was making a port instead of solo TPing lol
---
They have literally never "banned" an addon in the entire history of the game. They have always just changed the API.
---
Shaman? You'll be fine
---
Where the hell were you before Tuesday where I found I was rank 2 and decided to buy my 900g epic mount? Goddamn.
---
I dont join any group that is advertised with anything reserved if I can use it or not
---
depends id theyre worth it if you also have the goggles. i wear my goggles pop the elixir and have my felhunter out i can see rogues like 10yds away but its always gonna be hard finding a stealthy
---
westfall, horde side
---
There is still plenty of time.
---
BWL is harder than MC more because there are more fights which require people to pay attention than specific gear checks.  Vael certainly has a gear check component, but the rest of the instance is more about teaching people to handle doing something other than tunnel vision dps.  Gear helps, but isn't going to be the determining factor in success.
---
Great explanation thanks!
---
Heartseeker In US east. Check ironforge.pro
---
I don't like the unintended consequences of it.  I don't use Spy, I play on a PvE server, and combat logs are going to be iffy now
---
theres no way on earth you would beat me in a duel nice second reddit account
---
Is he shadow though? I don't see shadowform, silence or VE anywhere, and mindflay is on 9 which makes me think it's some macro instead.
---
They thought they wanted it (playing on PvP servers) but they don't.
---
Oh forgot to reply to this one.
---
Well just know that you have _exquisite_ taste in humanoids.
---
Yeah I didn't really think it through. But it makes sense, easier said than done
---
"LF 3 DPS BRD"
---
/
---
"Need heals?"
---
I don't have the goggles yet. Is the elixir useless on its own? 
---
Also not a warlock.
---
definitely not lol, spy is nice and well but it doesnt exactly show where the opponent is. Tracking explicitly SHOWS where the opponent is. Definitely useful and gotten me some kills.
---
You only keep it a raid long enough to do the reset trick. Once the dungeon has been reset, and everybody is back at the starting portal, you convert back to party. No exp loss
---
There are like a dozen ways a "freshly generated entity" with tons of buffs can spawn right on top of your head.  Stand outside an instance portal.  Stand at a mage/druid portal destination.  Have a warlock summon someone.  Get ganked by a druid.
---
In none of those situations do you hear existing buff sounds played (except stealth), as your video confirms.  
---
I think I see where your confusion is, though.  What your client knows about an enemy, and what gets displayed in the combat log are two different things.  
---
For example, if a priest with PW:S teleports on top of my head, my client needs to know he has PW:S so it can display the bubble around his character.  But it won't get written to the combat log.
---
Idk, the other post in this sub makes me think "MOAR DOTS!" helps.
---
&gt;That's cause bounty hunter is ~~alliance~~ Warrior and Yoda is ~~horde~~ Mage.
---
Spam dungeons or even better, take a week off and recharge.  Come back once BGs are released.  It will fix a lot of this.
---
200g for those boots... rip that was a waste of money
---
I cast giant growth on the elk token making it a 6/6
---
I two manned it with a warrior(Im a shaman) and we would clear to the second set of gates(like two groups of mobs) and you can /target from there.  This actually was pretty good for gold too.  we would get 1-2 stonespine per hour.  Got him his cape got me my boots.
---
I 100% agree with Razorgore. It's the ultimate first boss. It tests the teamwork ability of your guild, and killed a lot of guilds in the process who were just a mash of players who zerged content but wouldn't or couldn't work together to achieve a goal.
---
It requires people who normally play the "mindless DPS" classes to be good at a specific task that only their class can fill, be it CC/Slowing/Kiting or other niche roles. It requires practice and coordination. It requires patience.
---
If you find Phase 1-2 content too easy, just wait... it's coming.
---
Showing his hand one finger pushing the key is part of the video
---
Yes they are.
---
This is why far sight doesn't work cross zone huh...
---
Essence of water has an extremely limited supply (some fishing pools, a limited number of world mobs, and some elites) while essence of undeath can be instance farmed easily in strat/scholo. With servers having significantly larger populations but the supply of essence of water staying pretty much the same now with 1 layer I see no reason why prices for essence of water won’t remain extremely high. I think selling this transmute recipe is a mistake if you plan to be playing for a while.
---
On launch day the first 2 mobs I killed on my main dropped 6 slot bags. Since then I've lost rolls on 3 epic BoE world drops...
---
The Alliance that remain on Skeram are going to evolve into some Australian level wildlife beasts
---
&gt; Why can’t blizzard just remove it?  
---
because that would require to remove the combat log. and after the hotfix's like vanilla.
---
It's a good time, brings a lot of flavor to the game. I have a fun time tanking fights and I usually go looking for ganks solo. Sometimes I get ass whooped on the clapback and that's okay. I like the immersion of a dangerous world, sure it slows down progression but it adds a whole new interactive element to the game that can get the heart pumping.
---
Just gotta be aware of how dangerous the place you are is. I know that there's a very high chance of being ganked while riding down the road in the plaguelands for example.
---
That's preference and understandable - still, if you reserve and get that orb, thats 50g a run
---
Thats not why, its because you still have to manually control the input for each character. Syncing it up is what isnt against the rules :p
---
thats pretty shitty. If they were going to be doing stuff like that they should mention it before the raid, not right when the loot comes out....
---
Icy-veins is your best bet.

Click the single target guide and move the scale for your level
---
You rolled on a pvp server, of course you are going to run into this type of junk. What happened would annoy me also, which is why I rolled PvE.
---
Following your trend ;)
---
You die, die again and then die some more.  Then you start to learn how to handle each class.  If you're having issue with certain matchups I can definitely try to help with some advice.  As an enhance boy, most cloth are very easy.  Rogues and Hunters are easily my toughest matchups.
---
You. Will. Be. Fine. Don't worry about it.
---
Yea rogues can also use it for sure.  Particularly against other rogues.
---
You know this is a bad argument and you're just responding to argue.
---
The real hero
---
Dont do it, such a timesink. Ive been playing nonstop for three months, i feel the social anxiety creeping up on me, the lack of energy because of worse sleep etc at the same time I havenr really gotten far in the game and definitly nowhere in real life where shit actually matters.
---
Its just pixels, but for many wow in particular is like a drug that you get completely lost in, so yea dont do it.
---
You could just go to BRD with your pally friend as a tank and level all the way to level 60 just running that instance. You only ever have to leave to repair and train skills which shouldn't be often at all.
---
Nice, but this would only work against the dumber people. No mage creates a portal just to port himself.

Hey, you called the correct number, dude :)

I haven't figured out when or how you want to decurse yourself, so this macro will do it if you have neither target nor mouseover OR if you hold Alt key.

This was tested.  I walked like 200 yards up to someone in stealth, no spy alert.

furbolg tunnel that connects felwood and winterspring as well, at the entrance to winterspring it takes you 5 seconds to mount up cos of the lagspike.

Except essence of water is already farmed as much as possible - have you ever seen the felwood  water elemental mobs not being killed? Limited supply is why this is so valuable of a recipe and selling it for 200g would be a massive mistake.

Tank has 260 fr unbuffed and 5150 hp with all minor consumes. Gets everything but lungs. We dont normally get the fr buff from ubers before tho

My guild power leveled a 54 healer in strat live yesterday. He was getting 60-70k exp an hour and was easily able to heal the group.
---
You're a bad player.
---
There was an addon/macro back in the day we used to unequip our weapons for the class call. I'm a Druid now so i'll just be forced into Cat, but it's worth finding again for Phase 3. Will save you a lot of headaches.
---
Also if you find a Hurricane cheap on the AH pick it up, you'll need it in AQ40. Trust me.
---
His proof is not proof?
---
He told you how you can prove it yourself.
---
&gt; on't get me wrong, I spec into shatter even for raids because I don't want to respec
---
Lol... so you're a hypocritical then? You just said its a waste... yet you do it. So yes, you can raid with it, it doesn't even matter. You act like those 5 points are going to make or break your raid, please do tell more.
---
Ah EU
---
WOW I did not know the movement speed were different. TIL
---
&gt;These were things that used to be in the game in the early days. But were removed because PVPers complained that dishonor among players made it so they couldn’t play the way they wanted to. 
---
It doesn't prevent them from playing the way they want, it just adds consequences to actions that should be discouraged. As a 60 you're welcome to go to Hillsbrad and kill all the 20/30 something players you want but you lose honor because where is the honor in fucking with people who can't fight back.
---
&gt;While I can sympathize to an extent, if you have an incentive for killing players you need an equal risk to balance it out. Maybe instead of dishonor for lowbie kills maybe dying loses you honor depending on the honor of your assailant (ie if someone of much higher honor kills you then you don’t lost much if any honor, if someone of much lower honor kills you then you lose more honor). 
---
Umm... This would further incentivize death balls. If you punish people for dying, you are doubling punishing people who were ganked. This makes the problem worse rather than fixing it.
---
Good one! All 40+ zones on Mograine are ridiculously Alliance dominated, fyi.
---
Set range on enemy to x yds. Keep friendly distance set as it. It's a 30 sec fix for devs.
---
We'll have AV in roughly three weeks. For physical DPS and tanks, Don Julio's Band will be BIS for a long time. Casters will all want the damage offhands, and healers want the healing offhand. AV rewards are very OP at this stage.
---
Meh.
---
I mean you can tank Onyxia with all your dodge evade stuff. What's the big deal about getting a window on higher levels?
---
I'm guilty of watching damage meters a bit...too much.
---
Hopefully threat meters aren't affected as much and this will help me focus on those more!
---
Totally fair fight for the horde there.
---
I've been farming DME since it came out, hydrospawn has a decent drop chance on essence of water.
---
I feel that way about a lot of mods still. The game would take a lot more skill if
---
- there were no castbars. Could hide specific casts, juke heals, and it would be harder to interrupt in general
---
- you didnt have the buff/debuff timer on someone's face. Would have to guess that time yourself. Super useful for everything from waiting out stoneform to wting, reapplying cc, and avoiding reflectors
---
- you couldn't spam decursive to dispell your group mates
---
- you didnt know exactly when enemy abilities were back up
---
- you didnt have an autoshot timer, or a rogue energy timer.
---
Where to draw the line will always be a debate, but I wish these kinds of mods had never been allowed from the start. Personally, I wish they just never allowed lua interaction with combat logs for enemy players from the start. Not sure how hard that would have been, though, and that is too big of a change to add in now.
---
&gt; spells take 100% of spell damage if they take 3+ sec to cast or last 24+ sec. 
---
3.5 second casts get 100% not 3.0, and dots 15 seconds or longer get 100%. That is assuming this post is correct: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/95abc8/list_of_spellcoefficients_1121/
---
So we have solution a that is already done and fixes the issue for the most part. It mostly fucked with 3rd party add-on.
---
Or make more changes to the game, needing more dev time then they have.
---
Both of those solution will increase your revenue by 0.
---
Why would anyone pick #2 ? Because couple dudes think they know how the inner of wow works ?
---
&gt; They said it wouldn’t affect text logs used for raid parse
---
Does this output as events occur? So anyone can parse this and beep?
---
Even at 50 yards, there will be a huge difference in situational awareness between someone with the addon, and someone staring at his combat log.  Not to mention the typical player who doesn't do either.
---
Having tanked many 5-mans and raids, I can attest that 99% of players can't reliably detect and react to large, visible mobs at 30 yards.  So the chance of them noticing a Rogue stealthing at 50 yards is basically zero.
---
Are you serious? That’s unbeatable
---
Yes it does. And that makes it more optimal, but viable just means you can do it, and a mage doesn't really ever *need* talents to kill mobs and level.
---
That sounds like such a terrible idea I can imagine Blizzard doing it, but unless there's been a blue post saying that I will give the devs the benefit of the doubt.
---
&gt;Each run is about 4-5 minutes long and all you do is run to the two dragon bosses Morphaz and Hazzas while skipping all the mobs along the way and then kite them to death. Special thanks to this guy for the talents and kill strategy that i used
---
Do you know if it's possible for a lowbie to stand somewhere safe (like the entrance) and still be able to roll for loot?  I'm interested in tagging along with a Mage to roll for the ring for tanking
---
Of course.
---
Post on Facebook you just got a dream job that pays extremely well, old faces will suddenly pop in ;)
---
Picture with nice shit help too
---
I can confirm. They just arrived. Sent them off to kill 30 defias for 2 silver, haha!
---
Yea that’s true - that farm is definitely solid with prices for essence of water so high. I just feel with the realm pops today demand will keep the price high for a while.
---
Why do half the screenshots I see here have the gamma cranked up really high?
---
Does that not hurt your eyes? Never seen it before except for on WoW Classic.
---
Any insight on this?
---
They can download the addon though.   That's like saying healbot, clique, or decursive give a huge advantage to healers that use it,  therefore it should be banned.   I don't really care about the addon, but that argument doesn't work.
---
Lol this has been my experience trying to solo farm in dm
---
If you're just starting now? Might even be advisable to roll PvE
---
Nice. And if you're on Sulfuras, PM me as I'm also alliance.
---
😦wow😯that😮is😲amazing👌🏻💯‼️
---
Only downside is I can’t see gnome and dwarves in front of me. Not joking.
---
Imagine an FPS player saying you are bad if you think a wallhack is OP.
---
we used to progress/clear BWL, then go slam Ony and MC if we had time. We still needed bindings and rag kills.
---
So basically, MC will more than likely still be done by a lot of guilds when BWL is released.
---
So true. 100% of the people bitching about classic PvE content being too easy use dbm.
---
Nope, it's purely RP.
---
this is why people hate you noob fury warriors
---
prot exists for a reason. thinking that the healer would run out of mana completely invalidates all of vanilla's warrior gameplay
---
you think you're SMARTER than people 15 years ago? you think they didn't test this shit 15 years ago and find out prot had an easier time tanking shit?
---
Even the fucking NPCs are using Spy, smh
---
BLIZZARD PLS NERF
---
Not shard hopping over there it’s just turning warmode off... even worse.
---
Unless they don't significantly differentiate it in the code. Look, I think it is the ideal fix too, I also think it probably isn't the hardest option, but it also isn't "30 seconds".
---
It just depends upon how you want to define source. Let's not have a long discussion based upon equivocations
---
Reminds me of the off season on the GoT reddit, literally just one cosplay/GoT designed cake pictures/or a drawing for every post. Shit got out of hand lol
---
Thank you ! My 2 man group is warrior paladin . How hard is the 2 pack of skeletons ? Did you have to double grenade them down ?
---
I don't know if you've ever actually played priest or PvPed in any kind of serious capacity, so I'll just explain myself again in case you are misunderstanding. 
---
As a priest in PvP one of your critical roles is to Dispel Magic. This means both defensively Dispel your teammates as well as offensively Dispel enemies. The only other classes capable of doing this are Paladins and Shamans, however, they can only do one (defensive in the Paladins case and offensive in the Shaman case). Dispelling is a huge part of PvP and as a result any decent priest will be Dispelling tonnes.
---
Sheep is better...it doesnt run offf attracting others.
---
Those numbers were off the top of my head, you are most likely correct. Though I thought shadow bolt had 100% coefficient. Seems like that is not the case.
---
there can be only one!
---
So thats a yes lol ppl misread things on the internet bro get off my dick
---
You can only have 1 active at a time.
---
Oh boy, PvE players being punished for PvP bullshit! Now we're really hitting the Classic experience.
---
it's fun.  
---
who doesn't like to be overpowered
---
Doesn’t sheep heal the mob?
---
Oh sweet uneducated summer child, sorry you are salty you're getting outclassed and outskilled and have no clue about basic abilities in a 15 year old game lmao. #back2retail buddy.
---
Only reddit account. I bet you’re not even that good, tho.
---
Based on the color and slime(?) starting to form near the neck it might be algae. **Duneliela sp.**
---
The best thing you can do as a DPS if you want to be supportive of your group members, literally, is delete or disable the damage meter addon you are using.
---
I've been running it with a threeman team, all of us using two accounts to avoid any lockouts + miners. We don't have a scarcity of loot. I can see how people would see it as rare but.. we clear MC and ony every lockout in less than an hour and some change with no buffs, and that's not playing every day either. We take decent breaks. 
---
We get tons of resources, kid me would have been excited to get my epic mount. I've bank rolled four so far.
---
It affected addons which was rather inconvenient, e.g. a weakaura would tell you a unit just casted something while they only really just walked into your render distance
---
Hard to track contributions but good for keeping track of what’s in the bank.
---
Glad to know
---
That's reasonable. Just not a lot of axe options moving forward right? Maybe I'm just alliance blind
---
Sitting at any specific place on threat is purely dependent on how long P2 lasts. If it takes ages, you'd all get your threat resets anyway. If if goes super fast you'll still end up with some dps above your offtank.
---
For slow kills (few ranged) the best way is to dps until she's at like 45%, then when you (as ranged dps) get your next fireball, just stop completely and let hunters finish the job.
---
two pvp geared 60s ganking low to mid 50s? 
---
am I missing something or are these guys skilled and outplaying everyone?
---
i got my frozen wrath drakestone second run lol
---
you can technically play with one hand, either only your left or your right. 
---
You can even change your key bindings, so your right click becomes your left and vice versa. 
---
You really don't need a autohotkey script to do what your doing, but i'm pretty sure if you did - it wouldn't be a problem. As long as your doing 1 action per key press, your good. The only problems that arise is when your trying to do multiple key actions in 1 button press. Blizzard doesn't like the idea of you pressing 1 button, and being able to essentially bot, but they're ok with you doing 1 to 1 key commands from autohotkey
---
If I got 200g every time I saw those boots lmao!!! 
---
Trying to get this cape is driving me insane.
---
What if this whole time the NPCs can see us when we’re stealthed but never say anything because they want us to feel good about ourselves
---
Even on pvp servers you only stay flagged for so long and this is why. People are being dumb complaining...
---
oh god oh fuck
---
This is the best answer. Any feral worth their salt will be able to pick her up p much instantly, position her wherever, and then pass it to a main tank.
---
Toss some Reckoning buffs in there for good measure
---
You're the one who told me I didn't spend much time here. Also took 9h for me to respond, but idk
---
^ how to reveal lack of backbone in 1 reddit post.
---
&gt;Yeah but healbot makes healing 1000x easier for raids and even dungeon groups
---
&gt;Yeah but auctioneer makes posting auctions 1000x easier for bankers and even for main characters
---
&gt;Yeah but threat meters makes preventing pulling aggro from the tank 1000x easier for DPS and even for the off-tanks
---
Add-ons are in the game to make things easier. Plain and simple.
---
You should reaaally be succubus drain tanking while leveling. Basically zero down time once you find the flow
---
Ok?
---
My point was putting your PvE server in a battlegroup with multiple PvP servers will likely increase your queue times drastically.
---
Did it? Well I guess that’s fair as it should only react to you doing anything inside the 50 yard range. And not what you already have on you.
---
get yourself a corpsemaker (lvl29 ax) and get to lvl30 (windfury weapon).
---
Absolutely.  Just sit at the gates of a major city and watch as people rubber band back and forth as they move from one zone to the other.
---
We got a master detective here
---
all you have to do is post a video of your and your healer's gear next time you kill alzin
---
report back with your video because that's ACTUALLY what the original poster wants
---
Keep in mind you have a larger hitbos too. So there's no point we're you can hit someone who can't hit you.
---
Don't forget players who gank those on escort quests.
---
Hey I'm alliance on Thunderfury too!
---
Prot warriors too. It is an incredible helm for a threat set of gear. it's why i am getting it made.
---
If you rolled horde to PvP grief, you deserve any slight disadvantage that an add-on can provide to your victims
---
totems and 2h weapons for one.
---
I totally understand but I haven’t cared because I’ve played the same class (rogue) since 2005. No matter how much it changed in retail I always still had a good understanding of my rotation and role in each fight, etc. When I was taking raiding seriously I would look at them but I never cared what website was used at the time, worldoflogs was just the first one that came to mind.
---
I never said you had to be a alphachad mcbigdick to check logs but I haven’t really had a reason to. If I’m doing bad in a raid I already know what I’m doing wrong. Classes aren’t exactly complex in classic and after playing rogue for 14 years maximizing my dps just comes naturally if I care enough to do so. But I do appreciate you telling me that Warcraftlogs is what’s being used nowadays. Interesting to see the times on some of these bosses, holy moly.
---
I believe cats eye goggles, catseye elixir, and felhunter paranoia all stack.
---
EVEN NPC's RUN THE SPY ADDON!
---
Does it instantly? Doesn't it just put you on the 5 minute timer?
---
Look back at what you originally said for why i was confused;
---
&gt;On my server essence of fire is 8g and essence of earth is 3-4g 
---
I think you got those backwards
---
Was there today trying :)
---
It’s not about the honor, it’s about sending a message and instilling fear.
---
Are you doing her with 20 or less players? Because obviously she is a joke with 40, impossible to wipe - but with 15-20, these strats become less foolproof
---
Anyone have a lvl 19 twink BiS guide that doesn't include items from the Fishing Extravaganza or other content that is not unlocked in Classic yet?
---
Would be nice!
---
Thank God. To put things in perspective, the new scan area after changes will only be around 6% of previous area if it is true that old scam radius was 200yd.
---
2vs1? Massively outplayed?
---
all abilities are yellow damage
---
My understanding of it was that it spoke to other users of the addons through a hidden chat channel. That's why people without it don't even show up on the list of threat. Otherwise it wouldn't require everyone to have it if it was getting it's information from the combat log. I would hazard a guess and say that people aren't using the addon, more common that people think, not that the addon is broken.
---
Get DM buffs, then songflower (everlook tele is useful), then hearth to stormwind. Log out, then log back in a minute before the head drops.
---
My guild flies to redridge or loch modan with 3 or 4 raid groups then just clears BRM. The other raid groups are allied guilds that raid at the same time, or escort raids we have agreements with.
---
You have an odd threshold for "freaking out".
---
And when you disagree with someone's hypothesis, its usually incumbent on you to provide refutation, not ask them to do it for you.
---
Got mine at 46. I lent 50g to my warrior leveling buddy and travel form was good enough until he was able to paid back
---
This sounds a lot like the politicians threatening to ban encryption. How would you even go about doing it? It's not like the addons are digitally signed or registered with blizzard.
---
It’s great! My squad can spread out a bit to widen our net
---
yeah I had it happen to me. that is how I learned it.
---
Thinking about trying this with a seed pack and shadowmeld...
---
I think that's the wisest decision for me.  I'd not be able to control myself and repeat what you are experiencing.
---
Read the comment op made they were using wall jumps and safe spots
---
I’d be pissed too buddy. It’s nice to have a guild where you know the capacity of pretty much every person. It surely helps with avoiding the “troglodytes” that otherwise at some point will end up in your group and make you waste 3 hours instead of having a smooth run under 1h. I’m surprised people are calling you a douche, it’s perfectly normal to get frustrated by shit like this.
---
Dude I main tank ony every week. This is how the fight works. I'm first to get hit by fireball every time, sometimes multiple fireballs if I resist. After that it will hit the person who's on top of aggro.
---
This is why I have new found respect for Mark Jacobs. There was a huge amount of double accounts in DAoC. He did not like this and tried to fix the problem.
---
Do you think you should be spending 50g a week on rerolls when everything cost so much in WoW. Shit the hand of rag prob cost over 4k gold to make. You are not going to save any gold or get anywhere with your gold if you spend 50 every week. Think of it as your bank account, is it ever going to grow if you spent a good chunk of it every week. How are you ever going to save up for a car if you blow a 1/5 of your bank acct every week?
---
First Ony I ran at 59 I got her head, sadly couldnt use it since have to be lv 60 to get the quest but i did sell it to a melee for some nice gold instead since her ring isnt great for healing.
---
It varies, I see people asking 30 some nights, see up to 50 other times. I'd say 30-40 is a good range to negotiate.
---
Not at all,  you just need to be attune. BWL is easy besides those packs with dynamite throwing goblins, and then if you know strat they become easy as well.
---
Why is it such a big enough deal to screw up the meters capability?  Who cares that rogues cant sneak up on juicy low life people questing?
---
it has fairly high drop chance. its worth getting. Have fun with it!
---
Comment of the day
---
honest question, do you have a source for 200yrds? People keep throwing numbers around without a source and I'd really like a confirmation as to what it was.
---
Yeah, was definitely some sunk cost fallacy at play here as well as the intense desire to get that pants drop. Having this experience will now prime me to be a lot more critical of our party composition.
---
I thought so too but then I googled it and got conflicting info so now I gotta wait till I get home and see for myself. I feel like on my rogue that's true but on my spriest it might not be. I can't remember now lol
---
Buy your mount if you have the gold for it.
---
What I hate the most about "BiS" lists are that they all neglect to mention the feasibility in obtaining such items. Random enchant types such as Drakestone, Archivist cape, and random world drop greens are not practical to farm for without an extreme amount of time committment.
---
Cool I'm a Tauren Druid. Maybe we'll kill each other later? idk
---
I use both?
---
Nerf rogues?
---
P2 was certainly longer back in the day. Maybe it was just long enough for our locks/mages to consistently get fireballed resulting in no threat issues.
---
Good lord, never thought about far sight for farming xD
---
O.o  
---
Just realize I never thought about sentry totem to keep a eye while waiting for a quest mob to respawn?
---
This guy is so bad at pvp he made a throwaway account just to talk shit!!
---
Bounty Warrior
---
I found a Freezing Band just clearing mobs someone around level 45.
---
Perfect time for this. Now that my classes have eased up I'm planning on jumping into Classic tonight. Played BC-Cata as Alliance Pally, but looking to start fresh as an Orc Shaman. 
---
Generally any tips for someone looking to make the most out of their experience? I'm not a min-maxer, just looking for advice on how I can make my journey as fun as I can :) I was thinking leveling with Herb/Alchemy or Skin/LW, leaning towards the former.
---
Nobody is giving anyone priority, DKP is an *equitable* system in that everyone gets paid and can choose what to spend their currency on. 
---
It is you *choice* to save for the weapon you want, as it is the dps warrior's choice. Stop acting like you are getting a raw deal with your guild because you're a loot collector and expect to get *armor* and *weapons* before the people who just want *weapons.*
---
I've been told the owl is best for leveling, tanky and aoe taunt with screech you can get from vultures in westfall.
---
It's a terrible idea to mix pve and PvP servers in BGs since pve players have a huge advantage in farming/leveling etc. Wouldn't be fair
---
Herod.
---
We're doing between 26-30 most times
---
Are you seriously comparing doing 1 quest chain to 1136 ST runs? What the fuck
---
Lol besides the quest taking you all over the world multiple times, just doing the few portions in ungoro I was killed 10-15 times and spawn camped by pvp groups
---
Nope, blue name as soon as you get on the flight path.
---
First Tribute Run, Rod of the Ogre Magi and Crown of the Ogre King. I was the only person who could use them.
---
First Scholo Run, Bonecreeper Stylus, and won the roll over the other person. 
---
UBRS, skullflame shield drops (only BOE epic I've ever seen so far) and I won the roll out of 9 people.
---
He still pays the list cost I believe. I don't have a problem with it.
---
To be honest, I laughed when I saw them in OG. Good time to watch some TV.
---
Funny how people are targeted and hit with multiple consecutive fireballs when you claim those fireballs wipe people's threat and they only target the person ontop of threat.
---
Sorry, but it's not me who's confused here.
---
Then might as well actually not be a coward and just say "healer sucks. I'm out."
---
I would love a macro that helps with banish management in Molten Core. I can't really think of a creative way to do this as there is no focus frame and you can't auto-banish based on raid icons. 
---
Any thoughts or creative solutions?
---
&lt;Mormons&gt;
---
Jokes aside, do you still make raiders buy their own consumables or do you provide them from the guild bank?
---
Lol do you get how funny that is? Its literally what you asked me to do. You made a claim with 0 proof, I asked you to do some simple addition to back up your claim... And you told me to do it for you. Jeez man, youre a real trip.
---
Serious question, why all the buffs? Are you guys doing guild split runs? Just curious :]
---
You should be able to buy any item for 30g but due to demand rod often goes to 40-50g.
---
Alliance basically has the most annoying escort quest ever, followed by an UBRS run.
---
Horde has to run LBRS, UBRS, then kill 4 bosses spread across the world, then UBRS again.
---
Honestly, I preferred the ally variant, but they are both super annoying.
---
Incendius? Think I saw you by the UC mailbox last night and I had a nice chuckle at the 5 boomkins
---
Wait what are you on about?
---
The fuck are you even talking about.
---
If you want the loot, put on your big boy pants and kill the raid that's camping it.
---
I would say 500g-1000g is generally the range you can expect depending on your server.
---
I personally would never pay 1000g though. They are good, but not that good.
---
Imo I'd pay 700g for them and consider that still a substantial amount for the seller.
---
Now do the Archivist Cape.
---
What fits your playstyle:
---
Classic WoW: A slow slog through an immersive world. The gameplay is rough, you will spend 75% of your day running between places or desperately finding a new questing hub. Leveling from 1 to 60 can take weeks. It is heavily D&amp;D inspired, so you're not able to blast between mobs or fight multiple things without burning cooldowns and resting constantly. The world is immersive, the plot is subtle but exciting, and things feel... natural.
---
Retail WoW: A fast burn through a hollow world. Retail is far more action oriented: abilities are powerful, mobs go down quick, and you are happily and readily lead from quest to quest with little break between. The plot follows a single narrative, and the game just feels... less alive.
---
Classic WoW does not have a dungeon finder. If you want a group you need to communicate, join a guild, and work with other people. Retail has a system where you can be automatically placed into a group and burn through dungeons in minutes.
---
Classic WoW is a game for the dedicated, the committed, and those who have a massive fuck-load of free time. Retail WoW is for 99% of the world.
---
I'd recommend going with retail to start. Classic WoW will burn you out quickly, and without nostalgia carrying you along you'll most certainly enjoy it less.
---
That disguise is a magic buff, its pretty funny to dispel it while people wait.
---
Dotting everything is more efficient but it's gonna depend on your group. If you have a high damage group then mobs will die before your dots do any real damage. So sometimes it better to just throw a few dots and then start casting.
---
I played a mage main during my hardcore days (TBC) and either never knew or forgot that mages are like A WHOLE THING. Now I feel like an asshole playing the most popular class and one that’s supposedly soo easy to level (I didn’t actually find that to be the case). 
---
Kind of wish I’d rolled a druid or shaman, something like that, but I felt like getting back into a game I hadn’t touched in a decade would be easier with a familiar class.
---
Yep. Try to stay around 3/4 on aggro in P1 then when she starts moving for P2 start nuking hard and Shadowburn her on cooldown. You will almost always get fireballed this way.
---
The only option is healing for PvE I’m afraid
---
Just stop. You're just plain wrong.
---
For me, competing with a random generator was essential part of any loot-based games. It was all about drops or encountering a rare mob, but I never thought about focusing on the suffixes. You took it on another level. For that, I salute you!
---
It's max level
---
Over the span of 3 consecutive days: 
---
1. Hand of Edward the Odd dropped, I won (sold for 1200g)
---
2. In my first MC run with rotating Tier 1 and otherwise free rolls, I got Felheart Gloves, Robes of Volatile Power, and Nemesis pants
---
3. Ran Scholo for the first time and had Headmaster's Charge drop. I won.
---
Mind vision is broken too once someone leaves the zone you are in.
---
I far sighted from orgrimmar to the southern barrens.  Couldn't see anything though
---
I’m around there. I’ve seen it drop 6 times and lost every damn roll. 
---
I’m upset
---
Found it, thank you very much.
---
same alkaizer that got world first paragon 100 in diablo 3?
---
Sodapoppin is a Tauren. I’m assuming for the many new combos Warstomp+ bring
---
This probably wasn’t even a crit
---
So its even worse? 
---
Thanks for reinforcing my hypothesis by shoring up my deficiency with numbers. No need to be snarky.
---
Exactly this. OP worded this weird. “Trading” is to give something for something in return. If both are fighting to win, there is no problem here.
---
I see em posted in dire maul general chat
---
BenBeartanke
---
From anecdotal evidence I can't agree with this.
---
Do you not understand that honnor is split equally among the players who tagged the kill.

1vs1 is way more efficient than 10vs1 at the flight path.

What are some tricks you learned for ST having to run it that many time? I absolutely hate that instance and its poor design. Easily the most miserable dungeon I've run
---
8g to the guild.
---
Fireballs can be resisted. I sometimes get hit with 4 fireballs in a row at the start of p2 because I have fire resistance. Every tank in this thread disagrees with you.
---
definitely solo farming maraudon for the epic dagger. on maybe my 15th run for some reason i decided to pull up atlas loot and link the dagger in /s and say to myself "please drop this time" sure enough it drops that run.
---
seen people saying 400 to even 1000 runs without seeing it drop. always link the loot! :P
---
I got HoJ on my first run, but holy shit
---
I agree, it’s far from a simple “well obviously just do ‘x’, boom done” for the reason you mentioned. With that in mind, the two part fix (reduced distance AND fixing the bug where already casted auras triggered a combat log event) they rolled out is about as good as we can hope without completely borking a slew of other addons.
---
Hi and thank you for doing this! 
---
Is it possible to have a macro to make it so my warrior yells something like “Lok’Tar” when he charges? If so, is it possible for him to yell one of multiple things?
---
So for example, he could yell “Lok’Tar” when he charges once. Then he could yell “For the Horde” the next time he charges. I would like to have several different options of things he could yell. 
---
Is this possible?
---
Wife, kids, work.... yeah not the same conditions as before. But can play an hour or 2 when ive put kids to bed. 
---
No I cant run dungeons. No I wont raid. But I am having fun, questing and chilling. Crafting. 
---
Just make sure you DONT give up on family time or whatever you have to do. Once you are done for the day, you may play. But same bedtime as before!! And youll be fine. 
---
And no cheating! Or real life will summon a deamon in your house!
---
Same here.   I'll finish up that quest and realize I'm going to bed 1.5 hours later than I had intended.
---
Was common practice to still farm last tier of content one raid night a week.  So just because BWL comes out doesn’t mean raids won’t be going back to MC/Ony to farm.
---
I won a viskag in a ony pug shortly after getting attuned. I was in ungoro doing some quests or whatever and gig a random tell saying "ony?" 
---
So i figured what the hell. Did the run about 35 in raid. Win the roll against 5 other rogues and 7 warriors
---
I've checked out classicwow.live, zygor and dugi myself and some of my friends have checked out Busteas and Joanas.
---
Joanas is the best if you don't mind following it by website. Busteas has you do WAY too much grinding. Zygors is super slow (alliance is apparently fast). Classicwow.live is probably my favourite overall  - someone ported it into Guidelime here https://github.com/lukeknoot/classicwow-to-guidelime/releases/tag/0.1.0 but it also has you do a lot of elite quests that, to be completely honest are not soloable by quite a few classes.

It did the same thing before this nerf

Lol this actually hurts hunters, they can normally track other players before they are seen.  Now other players no when they are in the area
---
What’s the server pop like
---
I bought mine for 50g.
---
in my server the rod and the ring usually go for that.sometimes i see the ring going for 40g.
---
Viable isn't bottom tier, but it includes it.
---
I feel like the term gets thrown around loosely because people have different ideas of loot rules tbh. Not saying people dont do it but I see people referring to things like a rogue rolling on ancient bone bow or a fury warrior rolling on mask of the u forgiven as ninja looting when it is just people rolling on gear they need. Have also seen people called a ninja for rolling need on a green that is an upgrade while leveling.
---
Yes they do
---
Far sight will show you the terrain but no players or NPCs, etc.
---
The wardrums when you walk in do it for me
---
Which means other players know a hunters in the area
---
So are hunters that roll on melee weps. This goes both ways. I got my abb when no Hunter was present so...
---
Same .. so gotta make it up for the SO today..
---
Yep, and depending on the dungeons/packs in the dungeons you can have one or the other swap off dpsing based on what is more beneficial. 
---
For example, when we do live strat runs, we often have two healers (druid and paladin).  The pally dpses until we get to the scarlet part while the druid heals, then they swap when we get to the scarlet part.
---
water was 16g on horde AH when i checked this morning.  Still a profit of 14.5g not including tax.

As someone who just did the hunter bow quest this week on faerlina as alliance, its super aids being fucked with while doing this. The mob can be reset by any outside interference causing 15 min respawn. Also getting killed by players while killing boss is annoying as fuck.
---
Going all over the world multiple times is a lot easier as a mage.
---
I didn't go to fake internet medical school to be called Mr.
---
They are best raid healers in game so if there is lots of damage with the mele dps, shams are the best answer to healing large groups. I say mele because meles are generally grouped up.  
---
If shams can focus on raid healing then druids/priest can focus on tanks.
---
Im not sure why an rsham wouldnt want mana tide. Its 1100 free mana during a fight. Even more important when you have a haler come in to your group to benifit from it as well.
---
Do you have a link for that weakaura string?
---
It sucks. I haven't started using it because I have a couple friends that I'm always grouped with that use it. It's OP, shouldn't be in the game. But I can't imagine not having it around with so many people using it.
---
None of the options are so amazing that you have to pick them, play whatever visually appeals to you because troll, tauren, and orc are all matters of taste as far as how they look.
---
That being said, troll berserking is great for both healing and dpsing, orc stun resist is the best thing in the game in PvP, orc axe spec is by far the best shaman racial for a raiding enhancment shaman, and tauren war stomp is kinda useful in PvP but by far the worst racial.
---
You had me until the end. Why would I pass it to the main tank? Just fear ward me and we good.
---
This happened to me in PvE today actually, on bloodsail buccaneers. Was walking around an area doing a kill quest and I knew there was a set of 3 guys I had to kill (can't remember what they're called) camped next to tents not moving. I go around the area a bit killing any stragglers then I see another singled out in the camp area. As I walked upto him I saw on my screen 2 extra fade into existence and I almost agrod all 3 and would have died. They weren't stealthier or anything they just appeared all of a sudden, as I was 10 feet away from them.
---
It is not unique, so you can farm out tons

Decursive didn't work that way for very long, did it? I remember using it for a few months but definitely not for the entire duration of Vanilla.
---
At my first real job, all of 16 at a bar kitchen, one of the older guys asks me to grab a spoon. I bring it to him and ask what he needs it for. "So you can eat my ass" he says. Good times.
---
I have no dog in this fight, but the guy crafting for free is literally thinking of hundreds of players vs four, one of which is so greedy he makes his guild abuse the report system to ban the nice guy, I know which side I'd favor.
---
There is zero way to combat that sort of action. This is the major point of same faction griefing.
---
Same goes for Kazzak. Sending a bunch of characters with the intention of dying and healing him, preventing a same faction guild from killing him for absurd lengths of time is griefing. They have zero means of combating this action.
---
They changed it so you can polymorph tagged mobs for this very reason. Without that limitation, if you wanted to kill x mob that can be polymorphed, I could prevent you for hours. There would be absolutely nothing you could do about it.
---
I need a macro to autorun. I love having autorun bound to R for easy access, but want to use crtl alt shift modifiers for different spells on that button. Any suggestions on how to create such a macro?
---
True.  This is pathetic.
---
Leeway
---
&gt; You are all done ~~when~~ if i reach 60!
---
No, what they want is a hard game where everything is difficult to accomplish, as long as they get their shortcuts to the front of the line. The same people that are loaded to the brim with mods, tools and guides aimed at trivializing most of the challenge would throw an absolute fit if that content was simplified for everyone.
---
Running pre-nerf spy addon
---
I only vaguely remember Vael, Razelgore, and Nefarian. I truly can't wait for all of them! But probably Vael &amp; Nefarian the most.
---
I think the answer to both of these is: it depends on your raid make up, and your healers.
---
1) Maybe you have too few decursers and all your priests are way too busy taking care of that. Shaman healing on a main tank comes with the same buff to armor from items as a priest, its perfectly viable. Sometimes you just have a good shaman outperforming a mediocre/bad priest. It happens.
---
2) Maybe you have 1 less healer than you really need. A healer group with mana tide can really help with that. You can also cycle additional mana tide totems into the healing group throughout a fight, by trading shamans between groups. Its not "necessary", but it has its uses. Often I just use it for myself. Shamans are the most likely to run out of mana, it gives an extra 1.1k or so mana to you.
---
Night elves are trolls with access to dentist and a chiropractor.
---
Awesome.
---
I used to ditch doomed BRD groups by shouting: "OH SHIT A BEAR" then leaving group. There's not really a reason to be concerned about cordiality if the group is bad enough.
---
Dont underestimate the damage 2h staffs do. Rockbiter always when solo leveling. Windfury for dungeons.
---
Druid tank?
---
It's all they got...
---
Ever seen someone been targeted&amp;hit by multiple consecutive fireballs? I have. That should be impossible if they're wiping threat and just going down the agro list.
---
Ever seen someone hit with a 2nd fireball before everyone else outputting similar amounts of threat eats the first one? I have. That should be impossible if she's wiping threat and going down the agro list.
---
Literally just pay attention to who she's targeting with fireballs and you'll see that this claim that they go down an agro list is completely false.
---
Yes except when some fucking conehead in the raid kills a civilian and gives everyone a DK.
---
What was everyone's reaction like when Onyxia finally dropped?
---
I share a similar story. Here's to classic!
---
I agree that the term gets tossed around too loosely. But I'm referring to people needing items they dont need or aren't for their class when theres a member in the party that does. I had a guy roll need on a mage item. When I asked why he rolled need he said it sells for a lot on the vendors.
---
Those could have just been respawns though
---
Because they said they would be making them and that BG's wouldn't be just single server like vanilla was.
---
No one knows the actual populations or ratios. Any info you find is just a guess and not accurate. Blizzard has kept that info secret.
---
My GM needed the finkles skinner, so I strapped in to farm it with him for the next 5 hours. Dropped first run, went to skin the beast, and got the Pristine hide!
---
sunken temple cost fallacy
---
I do some gathering almost everyday. Makes you not worry about money.
---
I've seen a lot of people say find a Warrior and do DME jump runs duo. Not sure what your professions are but if you have a herb/miner and split the gold between both of you it can be pretty good income

---
Thank you wow community for cutting off your nose to spite your face.
---
Yeah farming crowd pummelers is standard for druids. It's the BiS threat weapon for the entire game. I have around 7 in my bank right now. When it is active only a fury warrior dual wielding with Thunderfury really matches/beats your threat gen
---
It's an easy farm, you get there from booty bay and lock out in around 15-20 minutes. It has a 33% drop rate so the 5 run will yield a little under 2 of them on average. Then you go do something in real life or play an alt until you're able to farm more
---
Presently ony is the only boss I really use them on, as MC bosses are all vulnerable to taunt and mostly the fights arent threat sensitive for what I'm doing. Once BWL comes out Vael and another boss who I'm drawing blanks on are untauntable threat fights where MCP druids shine.
---
i dont get it, are u whispering urself
---
I’m gonna keep that to myself just in case a lot of people see this. There’s only so many zones With high level herbs though, so spend a couple days trying each one out. When I did I found one zone to be far superior to the others . (Hint: it’s not a black lotus zone).
---
Even the NPCs using Spy smh
---
Won a roll for edge masters hand guards 
---
It was in a random arena anger run.
---
We decided to do prison for the quest.
---
One dps decided it was too slow and wanted a new group instead of doing prison for healer.
---
We kill a large pack of mobs and he leaves.
---
It drops.
---
4 rolls and I win.
---
I was level 55. No level 40 mount. That 760G was very welcome.
---
*definitely not lol, spy is nice and well but it doesnt exactly show where the opponent is.*
---
You have obv no idea what I'm talking about but ok.
---
i thought warriors at that stage were hamstring bots, nothing.more
---
You can tell a lot of spells just by looking at the casting animation.
---
It would reward game knowledge and move more attention to the game world instead of the UI.
---
You can pry my Spinal Reaper from my cold dead hands before I would trade it for the orange mace.
---
That is a legit ninja then and I would let my friends know to not group with them.
---
Nope, I’m on Grobbulus, one of their higher populated zones.
---
Batching is there by choice, they had to reimplement it because of the dumb #NoChanges crowd.
---
Remember that multiboxers are free kills in pvp. 5 individual players will easily destroy a 5 character multiboxer.  
---
Its impossible for a single player to play all his characters  at the same level as an individual  player can play a single character.
---
Sure he has the superior focus fire but how is that going to help when 5 other players are doing different things around him nuking one of his characters at a time and probably CCing some of the rest. So at most you have 4 characters focus firing and noone healing any of them... if you try and heal then  its even less focus fire.
---
And the mobility is the biggest disadvantage. :P  
---
If you are saying they can easily kill solo players... well, its not much difference from 1v5 then either. If a ganksquad finds you  playing alone, you are just as dead as against a multiboxer.
---
But even less than 5 players can deal with a multiboxer quite easy since they  cant spread  so all aoe  stuns and stuff will hit all of them.
---
You’re fine. I read it as hearthstone anyway. lol.
---
https://i.imgur.com/SpzwUhI.gifv
---
Don't use it then.
---
So I do this duo. Fury prot and druid.
---
Your gear is more than enough. I'll throw my while strat out but focus on Alzzin since that's what you are having trouble on.
---
Hydrospawn: wear the disarm gloves and just nuke him down. Trinkets HoJ and crit.
---
Zevrim: fury prot set with shadow reflector and pesant caller. I drop a thornling on pull and tank where he stands. Reflect first sacrifice on me. And if in druid they LoS on the broken pillar. Healer peasants after reflector then my peasants last. If you make it that far.
---
Alzzin: only need shield for wolf form and when imps are up. I wear nagelring thorns gloves and rag thorns trinket. Tank boss behind broken pillar and at 52% run towards wall and jump in. Demo shoot battle shout is enought to get aggro on all. Cleave spam and blocking with thorium spike is more than enough. Use dynamite only if heals is struggling. Aoe taunt if shit goes wrong. With all the imps hitting you you should have more than enough rage to cleave spam.
---
That should cover everything I can answer questions if you have more.
---
Anyone else have these raids popping up out of nowhere? Renderdistance seems fucky
---
today droped  [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10787/atalai-gloves](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10787/atalai-gloves)  with 42 healing on it op af
---
The raid doesn't need their help and they are guarenteed to win the item if it drops so them paying is fair.
---
He speaks your filthy Gutterspeak of a language
---
Which one requires me to do more than spam Shadow Bolt for 30-60 seconds? Oh, right. Thank goodness the loot from BWL is nice.
---
I hate it when hunters give us a bad name :( i bought my assassination blades off the ah like a good boy
---
What does getting exalted with AV get you access to? Just the Frostwolf Howler/Stormpile Battle  Charger?
---
On the flip side, spy makes it very hard to sneak past a raid.
---
I constantly spot people trying to hearth in hidden nooks because of Spy.
---
yeah op needs to look for RAITWAAWATBIS lists
---
It's equally silly to pretend it's impossible as it is to pretend it's super easy. But none seems to point that out...
---
I think the furor tick is bound to the same timer as an energy tick or mana regen 2sec tick
---
First of all it's not worth it. If for some reason it is for you then get the buffs during off-hours and log out around the corner from MC up in the BRD section. Or wait until raid time and have your guild summon you once they clear out the entrance.
---
"1st place" isn't a single person for these calculations it's the top .3 percent of every one that got 15 kills or more that week
---
Crown of destruction on first MC run. First epic, first day being sixty on my hunter. First rag kill for guild
---
A threat meter, like Tiny Threat plugin for Details, is an absolute must for warlocks. It will greatly aid you in judging what you can get away with. 
---
You have to work it out with your tank how many targets you can really DPS, but I would generally only dot the first and second target, first would get corruption, second CoA, and then focus target 1 down.  You can sometimes do three, but five is almost certainly too many for the tank to hold  in a 5 man dungeon. 
---
You can try corruption+coa on the second target if your tank is able to get a few sunders down on it and the first target is going down fairly fast.   CoA on first/main target may or may not be a waste if it is dying fast, but it is very mana efficiency so consider it if the first target is surviving more than about 10-12 seconds. 
---
If you are ripping aggro on a main/first target you should replace shadowbolts with wand, but keep the dots on since they are mana efficient.  If you watch your threat meter you can switch from wand back to shadowbolt once your tank has 1.5-2k threat lead again, depending on how risky you want to play (i.e. a 2k crit could still aggro)
---
Sometimes the difference between this working and not is whether or not you give the tank a few extra seconds to give them enough aggro lead to hold while your dots tick and before the entire party switches main targets.  It's a skill.
---
Turning on track Hidden and dropping flairs isn't going to help a rogue.
---
Really worth it over the av off hand?
---
I recently swapped to Ele at 45, noticed an immediate uptick in damage output, so it really is hard to argue against the guides. Unless you really enjoy the Enh playstyle that is. But as for gear, I stashed all my Enh gear in the bank just in case, but did manage to replace everything minus weapon and shield with int + spi/sta mail pieces on the AH for roughly 10-12g. Heaven's Light 1h mace and Aegis of SC are working well enough.
---
Nope it's a big fat dead end.
---
Ha
---
But if there is no opportunity to get an equivalent item for his OH, how does it even make sense?
---
Last tier? BWL was farmed until Naxx, and most guilds still ran MC for Rag and Ony because they took like 2 hours in total by that time
---
It's seriously fucking stupid. The second I stealth to avoid people I know for a fact haven't seen me yet they make a b-line for where this mod pings me and they find me every time. It's absolutely fucking stupid and I can't believe Blizzard allows it.
---
Even if there were I'm sure a lot of people wouldn't have known about them or used them
---
Faction imbalance is a problem for blizzard to fix, not for the players to compensate for.
---
Ur okay?
---
It‘s enough if a buff on them expires (like poisons or a fortitude)
---
Yeah, you can really tell it's the living shit stains that play and behave like this.

You can simply bind R for toggle autorun, and other spells for Shift+R etc. No need for macros :) Moreover, move actions are protected in wow API.

Track humanoids is only available in cat form. Spy is available all the time. It's broken.
---
I sold a pair for 450g on my server this week after posting them from between 420-500 at different times and for different durations over three-four weeks.  The deposit on AH was one thing that i considered so didn’t do it more than 4-6 times.  Right after mine sold I checked the AH and there were two selling for 350g.  So I would check regularly and not list all of the time.  I was not in a hurry which helped.  Good luck!
---
That might be the case, I'm not really sure what if anything governs the rage gain delay. I definitely notice though that the energy gain happens instantly on entering cat form but the rage gain upon entering bear form is delayed.
---
You're doing it wrong. You're supposed to say "ok zoomer" in response and you automatically win. Everyone else already knows you're right
---
You'll enjoy twin emperors and gothik and 4 horsemen then,
---
'big shoes'
---
Not necessarily, deposit percentages vary greatly depending on how many are listed on the AH. I’ve listed something at 600g before with a deposit of less than one gold.
---
Unless you're going to go back in time and make the servers 10 times smaller than they are you're just going to have to deal with it.
---
Pretty sure orb of deception has a default armor set.
---
Some people live for the grind and I kind of understand. Of course this isn't necessary, you can play the game with minimal grinding if that's what you prefer.
---
Yeah worry less a bout DPS, more about threat management.  Details has Tiny Threat addon, should use that over the DPS/damage meter.   
---
Your goal then is to remain about 1 crit shadow bolt worth of damage behind your tank. 
---
If your tank sunders secondaries and puts up maybe 700+ threat on them, you can drop corruption on them.
---
Or you could do fire to earth.  Lets do the math. Based on Incendius server prices (not familiar with BBG)
---
* Essence of fire = 2g
---
* Essence of Earth = 12g
---
* Essence of Undeath = 1g
---
* Essence of Water = 14g
---
So you go from 10g a day to 13g a day.
---
Honest question, my Dad and I are keen to start doing these runs as well! But everywhere I read it has to be done with a warrior and shaman. I'm a pre BiS geared Resto sham, and he's a Pre BiS geared feral tank druid. 
---
My question is, would we be able to do these runs with the same success as a warrior / sham combo, albeit potentially a bit slower? Speed of the run isnt a concern, just being able to complete it in a relatively fast time would be more than enough. 
---
Thanks in advance!

Its been cracking me up how many shows I've seen with the WoW sound effects. In Orphan Black they have the sound effect of when you enter an alliance capital city and it always makes my head turn.
---
People cry and complain about groups that reserve stuff. But you sir are the example that everyone points too, the person no one wants to be. You literally have been taking a loaded gun, and shooting yourself in the foot over and over again. You hold all the power in being able to tank a dungeon. Yet do nothing with it.
---
SGC - why the fuck are you even bringing someone who can roll against you In this? You can 3 man this with guildies or buddies easily. 
---
Truestrike/MH - again, why the fuck are you bringing anyone who can roll against you for this. Casters need jed trinket. Bring a bunch of them, you only need 5-6 people for a jed/rend run.
---
Black baron cloak - tank the dungeon with cloak on reserve. put ML before baron and loot yourself the cloak of it drops.
---
Have you seen Stormwind?  They put the moat INSIDE the castle?  And then they built bridges all over it to cover the mistake.

I wouldn’t pay them either!

I see it a lot in world chat.
---
I see. I often notice many healing shamans dont have mana tide, I assumed because they wanted to dip deeper into ele. Might just be they dont fully commit to mana tide because they wanna pew pew outside of raids. But i thought maybe there was a tradeoff, like with priests taking more mana in disc tree.
---
Why wouldn't they?  Because some lunatic might beat them up for killing them in a game?  lmao
---
God you guys are dumb. I don't even have any gear, at all. It's the exact opposite of what you're saying.
---
If you're talking about warriors, they're pretty ass at tanking 5 targets at once. If the warlock is decently geared and they're throwing up full dots on all 5 enemies at the start of the pull, they're making things really irritating for the tank. I don't have time to keep stacking 2-3 sunders on every single off-target when the single target DPS are hammering the primary and secondary targets.
---
Also depends on the content. If we're running a raid, sure I'm busting my ass to make sure we're progressing as efficiently as possible. But I'm not going to go sweaty mode trying to hold aggro on 5 targets simultaneously in a routine Strat/Scholo run. Just use your brain.
---
That's the hope.

I've seen 10+ character multiboxers with built in healers raiding cities.

But [here](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20769758265?page=1) is the post talking about Multiboxing being disabled in BG/Arena. Hopefully this still applies for Classic

Nefarian I've leveled 3 mages in classic and never managed to win a tear... It's bull shit
---
Because instead of farming this one item in the same amount of time he could have farmed 5000+ gold.
---
Only outdoors. Indoor areas like Blackrock Mountain Spy is still incredibly OP.
---
But it could also be 1136 runs. And in this case, it was. Just shy of 4 days.
---
Multiboxing should be banned.
---
This happened on Kirtonos last night/this morning as well.  They were getting slaughtered as I was flying in.
---
Made my way to the front entrance and they were all gone.
---
What time zone is it?
---
I don't see a reason anybody would use that, for leveling or for pvp.
---
Tbf i fucking hate when people get the level of a dung then start looking for it and havent even been there yet let alone not even know where it is. Like bro you telling me we been waiting on you and you dont even have Kargath or Thorium point AND dont know where the brd instance is? Tf are we waiting here for then this guys gunna be a hour. Mara is the same way if you dont have the fp its such a run. But people just fucking expect you to wait. My times limited im not sitting here waiting on you. 
---
Some people are just assholes. Im fine with runs taking longer when no one knows what to do but to expect 4 people to sit and wait on you is fucked and be happy about it is fucked.
---
In BGs multiboxing would be a disadvantage because you're guaranteed an even fight so multiboxed characters replace characters being played by someone. WPvP is a different story and multiboxing is absolutely an advantage.
---
As a broad generalization of my attitude towards camping and ganking questers i normally wont hit the same player more than twice and i avoid gray levels altogether.

One time though we rolled around redridge for a bit, MCing and then healing the alliance lowbies. Good times lol.
---
dude youre overthinking the shit out of wow.
---
Blizzard is intentionally obscuring the data so anyone posting data is either
---
A) Super outdated (before blizzard intentionally broke the CensusDataPlus addon)
---
B) Estimated based on warcraft Logs (which would only include PVE Raid groups that uploaded logs to the site... so mostly guild PVE groups
---
TBH though, I doubt any servers are 50/50 at this point.
---
¿Porque no Los dos?
---
Sorry but if you actually cared to pay attention, you'd see you were wrong here.
---
But you're not that bright, so good luck to you.
---
We are on the same side here not sure why you’re arguing with me. I’m pointing out reasons why things are the way they are. While I want things to change the community has already pushed for things to be this way. Just like you and I don’t want it to stay this way we can’t ask for things to be exactly our way. That’s called a compromise and it’s healthier for everyone and the longevity of the game. Grey ganking is annoying. But that is not the issue. The issue is being capped at level 50 because of the deathballs. And the deathballs are broken because there’s no risk for the ball. Yes my suggestion encourages a counter ball. But that is what the players who ball want. So incentivize the counter ball from low honor players who have nothing to lose and make it risky for those who join in the ball just for easy kills.
---
the videos pretty funny, but your definitely a potato in pvp, i giv thumbs up

Vael says no, you do not pass in pre-bis.
---
You don't need all of players to be in bis gear, but more geared the better.
---

I guess I don't see the point of comparing two different things like that.
---
Vael can be cheesed incredibly easy dude lmao
---
Ok cool I’ll check it out! Thank you and have a great day! :)
---
and here I am unable to get a single ST run
---
I also hate that you don't need to be anywhere near bis to destroy MC and Ony and yet people still obsess over it
---
Auctionator is just like auctioneer but is much more simple. It’s what I use because I simply want the vendor and AH value.
---
It's also allowed in PVP but its harder since follow does not work in BGs. So multiboxers have hard time controlling all of their guys in battlegrounds. So they allow it but I gotta say if someone does it...GG for them! Thats more work than you can imagine. Tried without follow and its not easy.
---
I've honestly had amazing luck with groups at 60.  Most of the people I play with have a handle on what they're doing and how to efficiently clear the dungeon.  It helps being a hybrid DPS and able to offheal/cleanse because for some reason cleansing isn't high on a lot of healers list.
---
The worst group I've personally had was a level 55 BRD run, where the tank had no idea where to go but constantly had suggestions for what bosses we should try to hit.  We are clearing to the coffer boss and he chimes in "We should do Angerforge" and runs off (not even toward Anger, back into the arena and down to the prison), half the group follows and we end up running in circles for 5 minutes.  I clearly advertised this as a "quest run up to bar" and we are heading to the coffer/Fineos for the loot and quest, which I explain.  He does this MULTIPLE times throughout the run toward coffer and Fineous, where he reads a random boss from his Atlasloot and runs off to find it.  Finally, after much wasted time and frustration, I say "Please let me lead, just PULL THE SKULLS and we will hit anything and everything yall need but the order matters".  Well, my brief use of capitalization was too much for this guy... One critical comment and he launches a full on attack, calling me every name under the sun and criticizing everyone.  The group pretty much disbands because of his toxicity.  It's still the worst group I've encountered in Classic, I've got no issues with people who are new or learning but this guy was just completely over the top and had the "im a tank" entitled attitude to match.  I honestly wonder if he was intentionally trying to troll.  Just craziness.

That's because classic was never about "gamer's experience" it was about releasing a game as close to identical to the original vanilla game with as few changes as possible. Vanilla was a game with a lot of flaws.
---
Lol I did this once, didn’t work but it was kind of fun
---
Ya might edge out a couple more dps with one of the xbows, but I think style points more than make up for it.
---
If i played shaman I might pay 10 to 15 gold for that if I had money laying around. Spirit is nice for leveling, but pretty garbage overall.
---
Where is the best place to mine at 230? Mithril is green now. Truesilver just became available
---
Track humanoids was usually finding people well before spy did.
---
It's glaringly obvious you've never tanked onyxia. Goodluck
---
Save it till phase 4, will be worth more to disenchant for about 50g
---
Nah a handful of Weapons/Offhands/Rings too. Most of them are pretty solid.
---
republic credits will do fine
---
hahaha wer von denen war das?
---
yea this was always an issue,. stupid molten giants
---
I like ignite barrier or frost and imp cs. As far as hunters go you have to dead zone them and try to avoid scatter trap. Otherwise, they will eat up your barrier and 2 shot you every time in my experience. Mana shield also works against most of their damage I believe too.
---
I agree 100%
---
But if iam a dick i like to be a useful well rubbed tip.
---
That also works. I didn't recommend "dps more" because I assume people are already doing that.
---
Everyone has the possibility of a thread reset in ony, regardless of class.
---
You would have to target it manually (as I can't think of any way to target an icon or specific unit), but you could use a castsequence timer to keep track of when it will come undone (or use a WA, but macros are fun).  
---
\#showtooltip  
---
/castsequence reset = 20 Banish; Summon Doomguard;  
---
If you see it as Summon Doomguard, ya still got timer on Banish. could also set it to 19 or 18 timer to compensate for cast time.
---
Your fuller explanation i agree with and gives more context. If they drop you as a tank for dos as warriors are superb at both then fine but yes should be run by you beforehand. 8/10 i disagree with as the last 2 are tougher than the rest hence you only got 8/10.
---
Tanks should always be in an inner circle of knowing whats going on as it is just that key a role - ditch em and find someone worthy! Best of luck
---

---
Why are we still having this conversation at all? Blizzard laid the guidelines for this in 2004. We are coming up on 2020. 
---
This has never been and will never be bannable offense.
---
There's always plenty of time unless you want to be world first or something. I hate how people act like you need to complete it instantly upon release...

Quick lore question. Was undercity always there? Did the undead build it? Did the lich King build it? Did Sylvanis build it?
---
I don't know if I would rather be a coward or a liar, is there a third option? I guess I could eat again :)
---
Ok boomer.
---
What server?
---
&gt; Theres a whole lot of numbers in the post. How does that qualify as 0 proof?
---
Because none of them matter without totals. How are you not getting that? 
---
&gt; For such a flimsy argument
---
Argument? I'm not claiming there are more Alliance. I'm claiming your post is useless without the real numbers. 
---
The really funny thing about all this, is that the totals have already been posted to this very subreddit... using the same database you are.... and the split is super close overall. But you're so SURE you're right, its cute.
---
Which creates some interesting potential for jukes.
---
Well... one of you two is wrong. That's all I'm saying.
---
Should go to an auction my friend people do and have pulled out of auctions, tough cookies for you. Too bad you didn't get to steal.

Hey, I'm a fan of modifiers too! I actually said goodbye to ctrl modifier because I don't feel comfortable using it. Also, macros allow me to save space and use only shift/alt. Using two mods at a time is not a good idea too, so let me show how I do it. You can see how I managed to dispel myself/my target (I also added mouseover as you use it):
---
`/cast [mod:alt,@player][@mouseover][@target][noexists] Dispel Magic`
---
Abolish Disease is a bit harder to handle, simply because you don't use it on hostiles. But you can use something else instead of it:
---
`/cast [mod:alt,@player][@mouseover,help][help][noexists] Abolish Disease; [@mouseover,harm][harm] Shadow Word: Pain`
---
This macro casts AD on you with Alt hold, or mouseover/friendly targets with no key pressed. Also it places SWP on hostiles.
---
The main hint I tried to give you that you can replace all your nomodifier action buttons with a macro like a last one and do all heal/damage with them :)
---
This is more of a “help me roll” question. I’m a noob and currently have a 37 NE Druid (fetal now, but trying to feral Resto)but I’m getting bored of it. If you had to roll a new class, what would it be?
---
Really sucks that PvP whiners were able to nerf a big raid tool. I get that one can export data after the raid to get accurate numbers, but that’s a huge inconvenience as compared to live tracking. Hopefully the details people can get information sharing implemented again soon to alleviate the issues.
---
Hear ya on that man. Trying to world pvp and or level as an alliance on Staalag is one of the worst. Alliance characters turning into raid day log ins now
---
The general problem is that there is nothing that specifically buffs arcane missiles in the talent tree, other than reducing knock back. The arcane tree mostly focuses on making the mage better overall, so you can take those talents, then put the rest of the talents into the frost of fire tree to get talents that specifically buff frostbolt or fireball.
---
The 6% hit in the frost tree is a big one. That is effectively 70-80 spell power with current gear levels, that arcane missiles can't benefit from.
---
Leveling a mage, got 3/3 Elemental precision I think it is, the left most talent in the frost tree, 1st branch. Is 3/3 worth it or is 2/3 enough for a leveling/world pvper? I don’t care about min max, I just wanna go deep frost for all the fun abilities. Can someone recommend a leveling build that can double as a pvp build? I’m looking at the talent calculator and I kinda want all the frost abilities but I know raid spec has you dip well into arcane.. help is much appreciated.
---

---
We weren't constrained by gear or ability, but douses. This was all nearly 2 months ago now - not a lot of people were able to summon Ragnaros yet. 
---
But yeah, I left and I've enjoyed my new guild immensely. Better for this kind of stuff to happen earlier in Classic. Now I've got an even better group of people to play with for the rest of the content.
---
Sorry, but looking at the actual data this looks like embellishment. Both horde and alliance earth prices on Incendius rarely ever reach 10g and sit consistently around 7-8g. Fire does appear to be low at around 2g on alliance, 3g on horde. Water is showing as 14g on horde, 16g on alliance.
---
Incendius seems to be a strange server economy wise, is it a small server?
---
I could see less interested in wpvp being a given, but I'm not sure how much less interested in BGs they are. I'd agree a little less, but I wouldn't think they are way less interested.
---
It depends on the rules set by the leader of the group, make sure everyone agrees before loot starts to drop.

---
I'm tempted to agree with wowclassicpopulation.com yes horde took over searing gorge and BRM but alliance has been able to form groups to take over and deal with the PVP without being impossible. I would not treat it as gospel but at least it let's me check every server for the last 7 days only.
---
Eep barb-durkle
---
My fav area is Southern Desolace. There are mithril nodes in both Magram and Gelkis camps, and if you wisely didnt do those quests the mobs are neutral, but one will be hostile to anyone who did the quests. Frequently they respawn as truesilver, and no one in desolace can mine them so they sit there taunting me untill 230...Also in the coven area there are 1-2 mithril nodes. Also for grinding mithril/TS the upper coast of Desolace in the ocean if you have underwater breathing of some sort. (hydrocane, deepdive ect)
---
Alright, so getting rolled by Horde isn't the norm. Which means Blizz doesn't need anti-Horde measures. Rather they should offer transfers from Alliance heavy serves to Skeram.
---
And you should coordinate your Alliance guilds and push back.
---
No thanks, no point in talking with you. Someone else has already answered your question in this thread.
---
ROFL @ ur mom
---
Perfect, thanks for letting me know :) Means I can farm a replacement belt since hit isn't needed for shamans with my talent setup.
---
Bought mine for 120g two months ago.  I’ve farmed very minimally as a result.
---
Having too large a population on a server (raw number) without layering is what's causing most of the PvP related issues right now. In vanilla, you couldn't have every relevent zone fully camped by the other faction, because there weren't enough people online at the same time.
---
Bigger servers would be worse than what we have now.
---
Should have been a dwarf...
---
I was part of this. One of the two alliance raids there. Not part of the suicide bombers though, as I had died to the other Horde raid.
---
Hmm good to know.  
---
I wonder if as a 2H warrior it's worth using for Rag Phase 1 20%-&gt;0?

Gotta get that money to their Chinese Overlords somehow I guess
---
As a healer, it's so annoying when I see other healers not cleansing like literally wtf! It takes like 1 sec and is kind of very important!
---
&gt;Syncing it up is what isnt against the rules :p
---
Did you mean "is against the rules?" Either way I don't think you are right
---
They’re lying out their asses just like they always do. 
---
Last time it benefitted China, this time the casual whiny players.
---
Depending on your class you can solo DME lashers, it’s bad exp but it’s safe exp.
---
But why? It's not even that good. Imagine if you spent this much time farming gold.
---
You don't sync anything up. Basically the software takes the input of your Keyboard  (1 key hit = 1 input) and then emulate the key input and send it to your other WoW Windows. Basically your computer is outputting 5 different inputs to 5 different windows. If I press 1 on my multibox setup the 1 input will get stopped and then copied and sent to the other WoW instances. It would be against the ToS if you press 1 button and your software instead outputs 10 different outputs rather than just 5.
---
&gt; This is not doable in vanilla/classic wow. it was briefly doable in Burning Crusade. If you want info on that read this : https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Rogues_as_tanks
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; so maybe/if blizzard releases TBC classic you might be able to do it but considering that for wow classic they used the last patch released as base , i doubt you will be able to do it.
---
It's very much doable in Classic WoW, https://classicwow.live/guides/836/dodge-rogue-tanking-in-vanilla-rogue-tank-guide-by-caperfin
---
Then go and play DAoC.
---
I picked an rp-pvp server, I played on an rp server in retail and wanted to switch to an rp-pvp server but then blizzard got rid of pvp servers , but in classic now I can play on an rp-pvp server and have the best of both worlds 😊
---
Basically you play one one account and the rest follow, then you have all the attacks set to the same key, so you press one for frostbolt then then other 4 accounts also technically pressed frostbolt. Then you run and they tag along.
---
Can taurens ride the Frostwolf Howler from AV rep rewards?
---
Must be using Spy Addon
---
With current DPS values, Vael is going to fall over sub 40s for our guild and we're not even that great.
---
He also doesn't have his 1 hour of attempts a week beyond 1.8.
---
Anyone who thinks Vael is going to still be a guild breaker is stuck in the past
---
Yes we use the follow command. I lead from one character (and can swap leader as needed) and only broadcast certain keys to all clients - I choose which keys broadcast (1-5, RFGZXCQT  with alt/shift/ctrl variations. Once you enter pvp combat in retail, follow stops working and doesn’t work at all in bgs for classic or retail. That single change makes a huge impact.
---
yep 
---
its also because some loot lasts seemingly forever, bonereavers is amazing always. accuria is BIS till loatheb ring which every physical DPS is gonna want. T2 pants are almost always relevant. CHT is a BIS offhand/stat stick till naxx farm. same with perds if you have shit luck on AQ items. and so on
---
1. This marked comedy
---
2.  Its also part 1 of a series of world pvp. 
---
3. Im guessing 2v1 doesnt count because they are CC'd right?
---
Orb of Aquamentas from the link quest starting in un'goro is a really nice +20 spell power off hand. As for main hand I'm not sure.  
---
But Ogre Staff is for sure on of the best weapons for mage pre-raid.
---
thats what you get for eating standing up all the time
---
Can’t relate, been trying to just fill out my full pre-raid BiS as a warrior and still haven’t succeeded since launch.
---
That's not what I said at all. You said
---
&gt;Honestly, Blizzard has strayed so far from putting the gamer's experience as number one.
---
But this game was not about "the gamers experience" it was about replicating an experience. Including what the "gamers experience" was like back in 05.
---
That game in 05 had many flaws. It was not the rosy "gamer experience" you remember. It was a rough game. That wasn't really "completed" until wrath. 
---
Complaining about modern blizzard not altering the game to cater to the "gamers experience" is ridiculous because this is supposed to be as exact of a re-release as possible.
---
I assumed you had the critical thinking skills to understand that. I stand corrected
---
Everyone will tell you rockbiter is the best. Since you are not a min/maxer you will use windfury because it is much more fun
---
Because the classes that can use mail at 40 are Warriors, Paladins, Hunters and Shaman. Also remember, this is leveling gear at best so it needs to be judged in that context. Also, the frost res is pretty irrelevant, and so is the 5 agi so the only stats that matter are the stamina and spirit.
---
Warriors don't use mana so they don't get the full benefit of the spirit, as Warrior I'd roll on this piece it if it was an upgrade but would not go out of my way to pay for this due to the lack of STR and AGI. Also, I will be wanting to transition into plate gear wherever possible (for tanking) and leather (for damage).
---
Paladins - It's not horrible for paladins, but it lacks INT and STR which are more valuable for paladins depending on their spec (holy or ret). Same as Warrior, would roll if it was an upgrade but would not pay.
---
Hunters - Hunters need AGI and INT, this piece offers neither. Spirit is always good but not enough to pay for.
---
Shaman - Similar to Paladin, a Shaman needs INT or STR. However a Shaman cannot tank so does not benefit from STA the same way a Paladin might.  Spirit is always good but not enough to pay for.
---
This item is the definition of lukewarm, I'm pretty sure the reason the price fluctuates is because no one can price it. If you price it too high no one wants it cause its crap, so you have it price it low enough where someone will buy it as minor upgrade for 5 levels even though it serves no specific purpose beyond an ilvl upgrade, putting it in the 10 gold range imo.
---
There are many dungeon drops and quest rewards that far outshine this piece in a similar level range.
---
The software I use is ISBoxer. $99 a year.
---
I mean. If you have both MC and ONY on farm then you're pretty much good to go BWL already. Not to mention the fact that there's still like 6 weeks left until BWL hits.
---
I appreciate the thought out response. So tier gear is, maybe not critical, but a major boost to tank healing.
---
Get 2/3. Pick up shatter and that talent that procs freezes. Get improved counterspell and clearcasting. Ice block, ice barrier. Ignore winter's chill. You can level and pvp with that
---
B-b-but there’s one server out of 50 where alliance &gt; horde so the ratio must be 50-50
---
Still if you don't know where he is, the hunter can know precisely where you are.
---
Get them to help you out after MC. Get in 5 quick runs. Takes about 4-5 min pr run. Our warrior helped us get a lot of loot from brd and we help him like this a few times a week.
---
We also did it as 2 mages and 1 warlock.
---
I really enjoyed reading the whole experience so if nothing else of value came out of writing this you entertained one WoWer :). Receive my upvote sir.
---
Leeway =/= spell batching, it's other mechanic
---
1136... WoW...
---
Having most of these BiS certainly do help though, but it's due to their stats being meaningful contributors to increasing run speed. My guild was able to reduce our Rag fight duration from more than 6 minutes (first try when most people were wearing blue/green items) down to 2min30s as everyone collected better gear from end game dungeons. However, calling every non-BiS item as "garbage" is a very awful mentality that unfortunately some people in my raid seem to have.
---
An average slew of games pales in comaprison to the great games they produced in the late 90's and early 2000's. 
---
Why do people defend the current iteration of Blizzard just because 20 years ago they made great games. Yes, we're aware of those games, that's why we're playing Classic instead of retail. 20 years is a goddamn **long** time ago in video game land.  If their modern games were worth their weight we would all be playing *those* games instead of the ones that came out in 1997.
---
Makes sense.  I guess if those are the terms agreed upon, it makes sense.
---
rank 6
---
you need 25000 contribution points to get to rank 7, most you can have after week 2 is 23400
---
Thanks for the explanation
---
I think brand new posts might have a timeframe to be verified first if they become popular? Youtube used to verify any video that got over like 50 views quickly was legit, and not some bot posting? Might be similair.
---
Mommy and daddy turned on WiFi access for you?  Better use your hour wisely.
---
Nope, you use multiple macros that take care of following with /follow &lt;masteraccount&gt; and /assist &lt;masteraccount&gt;. WoW gives a lot of options that actually make multiboxing easier. For example, you loot on your slave accounts by pressing your /assist macro and then you keybind "Interact with Target" which makes you interact with the dead body your master account is targeting. That way you can loot without clicking, since you really just input copy keyboard inputs. Copying mouse movement and input (for fishing on a single screen for example) is possible but very hard and takes probably a few hours of configuration.
---
To be honest though, one of the main appeals of WoW for me is competing in the healing meters. Sure, there's a bunch of nuances to consider like overhealing, heal sniping, and such, but one of the base enjoyments that I get is seeing how well I do, and how much better I do with new gear.
---
No you're not, you're excited to not be privy to everyone who's mocking something through sarcasm. 
---
Typing lIkE tHiS is literally just a way to signal sarcasm. That's it. Sarcasm is hardly a fad. It ain't going anywhere.
---
Hey I was just feeling a bit pedantic when I wrote my comment what can I say
---
As a horde player I’ve always been extremely jealous of the NE mount and how cool it looks
---
please don’t tell any of my horde friends that I said this
---
you have no point, thats the point. the same amount of people will be in queue, but this allows the entire SERVER to be balanced, and since youre such trash at the game you refuse to allow that, 
---
And lol at the "I know you are but what am I" reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
100 to 0, must've been driving.
---
I know a hunter on benediction who gets paid 50-75g for it.
---
Yeah, rolling "need" because you want to vendor it for gold is bogus. But, unpopular opinion, rolling "need" on a "mage dagger" is something that a rogue is going to do. If the DPS is higher than the dagger he's using now, its an upgrade. The stat bonus it applies doesnt matter nearly as much as the DPS. Just gonna have to deal with things like that. Most drops have a use for several different classes/specs.
---
Everyone here made the same point that you are treating a dungeon that takes 1 hour to do and can be repeated over and over again until you get your item. While a raid like MC takes 2-4 hours, plus you can only kill the bosses once a week. So if your item didn’t drop this week, you have to wait a full week before you try again. When you are in a dungeon, everyone is equal and should get an equal opportunity on items. But the reality in raids, is not everyone is equal. The mage who pumps damage, shows up every week on time, and helps people during the week should not have to roll against someone who shows up to raid and does alright damage. Also if everything is need or greed, you can have salty people roll on things that really aren’t for them. Bindings drops and a hunter or warrior decide they need. Who’s fault is that? Is it the ninja? 0%, it’s you as the raid leader for having shit loot rules.
---
Blizzard also outlined using geometry to abuse guard logic inside of neutral cities...but you can clearly see people still using rooftops and buildings to prevent guard aggro. That was 2005 as well.
---
Nah, you can quest in un goro and get one that does 20 spellpower for probably 1 hour of work. It’s a long, but easy chain.
---
Not close at all, you can tell by playing in the server that it's horde dominated. When it comes to pvp horde have 12k players ranked while alliance has 5k players ranked.
---
Soon!!!!
---
Question for alliance on horde dominated servers: did you guys quit, or just move on to an alt? I ask because I’m currently Ally on Skeram, and it’s gotten REALLY dead the past few days. Way less chatter in LFG, as well as less people in capital cities. I made an alt last night because I’m 51 and leveling has been impossible. Curious also if it was unwise to make my alt on Skeram lol, but I am praying things will be better by the time I get to 60 on that guy.
---
&gt; Hopefully blizzard can make it back to these roots and produce games like this again
---
No one really hopes Blizzard to fail miserably. Because if they do succeed we have new genuinely good games to play.  It just so happens they pull the same marking bs over and over and over again, hence the whole "hey guise! We're going back to our roots!" shcpel. If the players were all well and happy with their games, they wouldn't need to mention "going back" to anything. Simply mentioning that phrase they almost admit in their marketing that their last iteration of Diablo was way off mark and they're trying to correct for that in D4.
---
This is what I did and it was a ton of fun to have a new leveling rotation. This switch also coincides with Mail armor being available so you'll likely be switching a lot of gear around anyway. Might as well stack int/spirit during the swap. My main hand wep didn't change - it's almost always been a 2h staff. 
---
The downside is that there is a lot more downtime for drinking than enh spec. But the overall mob kill time is faster so you still come out ahead in terms of leveling speed.
---
That's what I thought, you can't because it's not relevant in any way, shape, or form.
---
Please refrain from future retardation.
---
They will though. For all of classic there are only 8 mobs in the entire world that drop essence of water. Phase 4 enchants require up to 15 water a piece, so the only increase in mats to the market is if shit loads of people get this recipe and start spamming the market with waters. Realistically though waters will always be worth more than undeath - always. So there will always at least be a profit behind it, albeit maybe not 15g a day
---
&gt; . 5 individual players will easily destroy a 5 character multiboxer.
---
But that isn't a fair comparison. 5 multiboxers will destroy 5 one account players.
---
Deposit is not the same as the cut. When you check your mail after successfully selling something you will see how much of a cut the AH takes, and it is a flat % I believe.
---
I imagine you’ll gain more than 7 spellpower. Which is all he gained over the offhand from quest
---
Would only work for people in your party/raid.
---
Struggling to get gold when raiding each week requires like 50g in pots or 150 if we are required to bring a flask.
---
Doing lasher farms I got a Freezing Band to drop and was able to give me my epic mount and epic cloak and chest on my priest after a bit of farming.

In my opinion spy is great on servers where the horde:alli is 3:1. Without spy it would be realy difficult to find allis.
---
Yeah, and his apparent philosophy of "only healing is important" doesn't hold up when one of the diseases reduces the tank's dodge chance! Amazing, really
---
I mained Shamans towards the end of Vanilla and most of TBC. They are by far the best class to box, but I wanted to do something different.
---
I’m a warlock. In the mushroom that kills all.
---
Disc has been awesome too. I was always shadow in vanilla but I’ve been amazed at how easy it’s been to defend myself against horde while leveling as disc.
---
This is my guild in the video
---
Logs should still be accurate.
---
Underworld band dropped for my warlock main at lvl 41

Hunters!
---
How would you spend your 300 TP on a Brooken Tooth intended for PvP? I have some ideas about what skills could be good, but still wonder.
---
I’m sorry i don’t watch any streamers. Im not sure why all the hostility towards me. Leave me  alone please thanks.
---
We did it last night by simply having every warrior go balls out DPS during P3 to try to get any one of them to have threat.  Whoever gets it tosses on a shield and we go from there.
---
Nice, how is druid working out?
---
Is not having roots/travel form/move speed annoying when you're in dungeons?
---
&gt; She was hotfixed on 11/8/19 to fix a threat issue with her fireballs during p2. Has anyone tried the GUID method since then?
---
The hotfix was specifically to get rid of the guid method. I guess you could test it if you really want, but unless their fix failed it won't work.
---
Vael, chromm, nef
---
What about feral/resto?
---
Shamans have lots of utility but suffer with a lot of their spells not being very mana efficient. If you use your shocks everytime they are off cd your going to go oom fast. Every rank of lighting shield gets more mana efficient so it will be your main tool for soloing. Searing totem is another great solo tool (its dangerous to use in dungeons as it can pull mobs your group isn't ready to engage yet).
---
Its tricky to get into a routine that allows your natural regen to kick in (not casting a spell for 5 seconds) but you will get used to it.
---
Rank 1 earth shock is amazing for interrupting spells even at high levels. I would suggest an add on so you can see cast bars on mobs.
---
Yaaaaa I ran ST once and was like fuck this. At some point you have to decide if something is really worth your time. But it looks like you have a lot of time so...
---
Everyone keeps joking about how mad asmon has been and how he is seriously considering rerolling on a pve server, so it sounds like it's going really well for the Horde on Faerlina.
---
Stoned? OP's clip is on Mograine. The commenter above implied that this was only possible due to server imbalance, so I clarified that Mograine actually leans *the other* way. Does that help?
---
YOU ORCS WANNA LIVE FOREVER?!

Ah, it wouldn't be a wow pvp video without nu-metal playing in the background!

Sage Gladiator Chain - 3rd time in BRD as a lvl 54.

Hoj - 18 Angerforge kills, which I was super happy about, thought I would end up in there forever.
---
3 Arcane Crystals from my first time in DM:E
---
Edgemasters Handguards - managed to get them for 150g a couple weeks ago.
---
Sorry for terrible experience, but I had the opposite run 2 nights ago.
---
Got into an emperor run and quickly learned 3 of the party hadnt been to brd in like 8 years and didnt remembee anything, thankfully I had the key on me and the other mage knew his way around too. Everyone was an appropriate level excpet the 52 priest (who we carefully pulled some extra packs for to make sure he wouldn't body pull), everyone did their job well, when we ran into issues in the tavern (phalanx did some bullshit) everyone laughed it off and we persevered.
---
In the end it also took us over 2 hours, but we damn near full cleared brd, saved a princess, got a bunch of gear upgrades for the underleved healer, and it was the exact type of thing I subbed for.
---
Keep fighting the good fight, the people are out there.
---
&gt;It would be against the ToS if you press 1 button and your software instead outputs 10 different outputs rather than just 5.
---
What is bannable is if there is software that makes decisions and controls your characters for you.  If it is always just you controlling multiple characters simultaneously, it is fine.
---
The line is pushed with how much functionality is built in to macros that are conveniently automated for you, but so far they allow it.
---
That’s the only alliance side mount I like. The ne mounts are all so cool
---
I was expecting this to be a rogue or hunter farming for dual Call of the Dragons.
---
I agree, I only have it because everyone else has it. You're at a disadvantage if you don't. It completely changes the way the game works in the open world. Every rogue that ganks someone in IF or some other town is immediately targetable and swarmed.
---
I played a hunter before the addon came out and it was so nice being able to use track humanoids to see if any Alliance were around me, I was able to avoid and pick my fights, but now everyone has that advantage and it's just not fun when everyone knows where everyone of the opposite faction is at any given time.
---
Excuse me, did I do something wrong?
---
&gt;  If someone else has tallied up the totals, please share
---
...
---
&gt; asking me to make your point for you.
---
Haha!
---
If you're a rogue get a friend and go to the enemy capital city and go to where people come out of mage portals.
---
You can get a lot of kills on people with world buffs for raid.
---
For sure ruins their day.
---
Don't let your dreams be memes.
---
It’s 25% per blue post. They did not go with the 1.12 DRs.
---
We got 3 19 rogue twinks 1hunter think 1priest think and 1 warrior twink, together we can gank 50-60s
---
If a summoned skeleton is up for enough time (10 seconds maybe?), he heals for a bit. Nothing major, but if they're ignored it makes the fight impossible (unless the DPS are geared to the teeth and can just burn Baron through it).
---
Depends on level. At higher levels I do more damage with Windfury. But lower levels def rockbitter.
---
That's why I hope they make pure pve bg pools
---
“I'm scared that if I stop drinking all at once, the cumulative hangover will *literally* kill me.”  - Sterling Mallory Archer
---
As a "well paid engineer" in the software development industry, let me tell you that you _completely_ missed the point.
---
ps: Your 15-man startup business is not representative of how things work in large, industrial sized businesses.
---
I hope they change it back to the old values if you are in a dungeon or raid, though it could require some changes to code, so we'll see.
---
Rolled an orc hunter alt to level 10, and now I'm thinking of rerolling as a troll.  
---
From what I understand trolls are generally better stronger at PvE because of the increased bow skill while Orcs are better at PvP because of the stun resist, and I like to do more PvE than PvP.  Is the difference dramatic enough to warrant rerolling?  I figure if I'm ever going to do it, now is the time before I get too deep.
---
Imagine a nolifer who BGs all day and dominates rank 13-14.
---
That would create some serious drama.
---
Better ban Clique, healbot, decursive, DBM, and any addon that tracks debuff timers as well.
---
Does the addon locate invisible targets such as a rogue? Or do you have to be out of stealth? Sorry if dumb question - I don’t use this addon
---
What's the point of the 5K gold if it can't get OP what they want?
---
I believe Ebbn on YouTube did a video on DM farming.
---
I thought you were ranked based on how the other members of your faction do cp wise. But yeah idk what im really talking about.
---
Haha love this
---
Is there not a way to just ban the specific addon itself? Why do they have to prevent it from functioning? I feel like they should be able to say an addon is not allowed to be downloaded.
---
The information is pulled from Raid Logs and uploads. So if you are not grouped with people who are uploading logs etc, or doing it yourself,  you will not have updated info.
---
If it's been done before it's not exactly new
---
Feral tank. Beside flag run/defend. 
---
Distract dps or healers. You may not kill them but you pull them off their game. If you keep annoying pressure on them. Like a mosquito testing your sanity in a dark room.
---
It's a game, I saw some people having fun and laughing as bros.  Get the stick out of your ass.
---
Different strokes for different folks. 
---
Some people enjoy different things, and that's okay.
---
Honestly I'd sell it. Prices on water essence going to drop real hard in 3 weeks
---
If you master loot you can loot items dungeon wide. I do it in mc from like domo to rag range
---
No. He replied to someone saying "remove the combat log completly" with "I'd rather have functioning dps meters" no one is talking about the range of the log. 
---
Remove enemy actions from the log and we can have the range of fucking 5000 yards.
---
Too bad AV's around the corner
---
Imagine not being able to admit you're wrong and insulting people. Big yikes.
---
This is addons in general, I wish wow never had them considering it can give players a big advantage compared to the ones that dont have em. Like a rare alert or gathering mumbo jumbo
---
GUID trick doesn't work anymore I believe. 
---
We just have multiple warriors fighting for threat during p1 and ranged dps only auto attacks / wands. 
---
During p2 the MT grabs some whelps for rage and tries to build whatever threat on ony they can.
---
When she lands in p3, all the warriors fight for the threat back and whatever warrior gets her will continue tanking. No one else should be dpsing at this point and we let the new tank build some threat and then slowly start working dps.
---
As long as everyone is careful and paying attention, it should be really easy to manage.
---
Nope, reddit circlejerked PvP so hard as the only way to play for the authentic vanilla experience ^(TM). Many people followed like sheep not realizing that PvP should probably be your primary thing if you're picking a PvP server, otherwise you should play on a Normal server. (Note they're called Normal, not PvE).
---
I hate the baby Yoda shit. It's not Yoda the species is not yoda, they are Lannik the species they belong too is Lannik!
---
because opportunity cost usually weighs into your decision on whether or not a particular thing is worth going after. You're giving up X to do Y. Evaluating whether its worth giving up X can be a determining factor in what you do.  Yes, he couldn't have bought the offhand he wanted but that's not the point, what matters is he could have EARNED 5k gold or he could forgo that and get the one item. We use opportunity cost all the time in much more mundane decisions without even really realizing we're doing so.
---
Reporting accessible APIs and displaying them into a GUI is not botting. Downvote this dogshit post with me, friends
---
Is that a Florence flask? Who still uses Florence flasks?
---
Still very good, i believe you trade out a bit of utility/flag running ability with natures grasp for better survivability with nature’s swiftness. 
---
They’re also the best flag defenders in arathi basin (which will be released later) because they can sit in stealth, alert the team when an enemy comes to cap, interrupt them at the last minute, then switch to bear form and sustain/survive until backup arrives.
---
Makes sense! Ty for the explanation
---
Was this on Sulfuras? Saw some people promoting a stream with a triple Horde rogue gank squad in Ironforge (or maybe it was Stormwind) on Twitch.
---
\*when you get exalted with AV after it comes out in a few days
---
Amazing....seriously this is really good news.
---
Asmond was complaining on Twitter about being ganked everywhere. Someone was like "you're popular enough to get people to protect you!" and Asmond replied "dude, I shouldn't have to form a 40 man raid just to step outside a city!"
---
Great! Now Spy will hopefully stop triggering on people flying over me.
---
What would you suggest after the lord Alex axe pre-raid? I have about 500g and the devilsaur set on my enhance shm but I don't know what to buy next or if anything from the ah is even worth it (not easily replaced in high end dungeons)
---
That happened to me but the guild leader(OT) doesn't trust me so I didn't get them...as the MT.
---
In the current state of the game, unless you are main tanking bosses, you should just run cat pvp spec in tank gear when you raid or do dungeons. I use the addon Item Rack to be able to quickly swap gear for the occasion: dungeons, raid, FR, pvp Bear, pvp Cat. There are better specs for flag running, but if you are needed in raid to provide leader of the pack, full cat build is the way to go. Also AV would likely be better for full tank so you can tank the bosses.
---
Better than being a dogshit player that needs some program to play the game for them.
---
Winning the roll on Cloudkeeper's Legplates and selling them for 1000g the day after I hit 60.
---
Grobbulus is probably the best server to roll on. Tons of events. Even Horde/Alli population. High pop without many queues.
---
Clearly, after all Nost's population dwarfed vanilla's! 
---
Jump down, run straight to the dragons, kill them. It's completely different from a normal run in a 5 man.
---
You mainly need to be able to progress fast enough to avoid respawns and bring enough food/water eat/drink every fight to keep your hp/mana up and keep your pace up.  If you are underleveled and undergeared that might be a challenge.  Be careful with pulls, since a death and runback puts you behind on the respawn timers quite a bit.  Steady pace is important.
---
I rarely used bandages/pots to make it through that stuff.  You could, and it will help, but that kinda gets expensive and if you're, say, pre-40 saving for a mount, I wouldn't spent too much on that stuff. 
---
Not ever cave or world quest is easily soloed.
---
They're from the private server scene. I played with them on Kronos. At the time we had every world record for boss kill times; In Classic they claimed NA First, Horde First, World 3rd Rags in week 1. Had the fastest Speed Clear of MC for a bit too.
---
I got "Of The Monkey" [slaghides](https://classicdb.ch/?item=13258) on my first attempt.
---
Despite tanking being my offspec, I had ridiculous RNG with my tank set and got full preraid BIS before my healing set was even halfway preraid BIS.
---
I don't want FOP god damn it, I'm a dapper dan man
---
I'm playing enhance and did orc for the +axe skill and the racial damage boost.
---
Lol what a tool
---
You are surprised that instead of spending money they chose the option that didn't spend money?
---
Well I said twice a week because of reset. When the guild was starting up we were also trying to get both groups going. we swapped groups around trying to manage the people from the main group into separate  teams with tons of new people we wanted to explain the fights to people who never played vanilla before . It didn’t go as smoothly at first. Would save rag and Ony for a separate day. We clear it all quickly now. I appreciate your attempt at belittling and shit talking though 👍🏻
---
Upvote purely for the nostalgic meme 🥰
---
Yeah I’d be fine with that
---
I hope that brings you the peace you seek.
---
BG multiboxing is more an issue because the reward structure scales so well with accounts.
---
If I have 5 characters mining nodes or farming mobs, I get diminishing returns. If I am farming BGs, might as well include all 5 of my accounts for more honor.
---
Yeah it's ridiculous, I can't even mount up and stealth if I don't want them to know I am there. I have to stay stealthed way before I encounter anyone to actually be 'stealthed' It's fucked up.
---
You seem maed
---
I think the sharing was straining the server or something, so I’m not sure if it was disabled by the details devs or Blizzard.
---
They could have just limited the range that you detect combat log into for hostile players over everything. But according to the blue post, this nerf brings it more in line with how it was in vanilla. So it could have just been brought to their attention by the complaints and just corrected.
---
No, lol. With 1.12 talents and 1.12 itemization, BWL can literally be full-cleared in preraid blues.
---
I know what he's talking about.  This was changed recently, before the combat log fix.
---
Also it is a good one lol sent it to my mate
---
Not to be an ass, but that’s a perfect example of a bad keybind. You have to iterate and improve on your keybinds if you want to beeeeeee the verryyyyy best.
---
What do you mean by evading? Why is evading wrong in your eyes?
---
I work in a company with over 2000 employees. So no, thankfully I dont work for a startup.
---
Didn't you quit 15 years ago too?
---
It takes less than 1 weekend, lol.
---
This seems like the best foolproof method.
---
That's a laughable assertion.
---
Blizz saw osrs work and the dollar signs lit up in their eyes.
---
glad you fixed that sweet shaz strat you had
---
Then: 10 years and saw my neighborhood friend playing. Spent weeks going to his house to play and only beg for gold to get rich. ( didn’t know what the fuck was going on in the game) until his motherboard went out and never played again. 
---
Now: 25, just closed on my first home , have a great job and game way too much because I’m single. Just hit 60 last night on my one and only character.
---
Oh no guys, we lost Maednezz, how will we ever go on?!!!!!?
---
That sounds like a real kickass run! I love full clears of BRD, even though I now don't have a reason to set foot in that place. And this experience I had last night was definitely an anomaly; most of my dungeon runs are a lot smoother, with people usually owning up to their mistakes and learning from them. 
---
But man... is this nightmare gonna stick in my head for a while
---
On DD there are lots of back and forth pretty even fights around BRM.
---
holy shit another person from Aegwynn, it's like finding a unicorn.
---
K
---
The program is not playing the game for you. It is reporting AVAILABLE KNOWN APIs into a graphic interface.
---
It’s ok not to like something, but you literally don’t know what you’re talking about.
---
Ok, boomer
---
Calls other people cowards 
---
Quits the game due to people killing him 
---
...okie
---
Thought it was a spit bucket for tobacco
---
As someone who is more into PvE than PvP, I still rolled orc hunter over troll. You will beat all PvE content anyway as it isn't that hard, but more advantages in PvP will always be relevant.
---
It’s usually updated from Tuesday raidlogs and it’s often a week behind. I can still find my raid info from my original server I raided on before my transfer in September
---
Gooddamnit spy addon
---
That's the only good part of the addon
---
Yup, 5500-ish mana to healers per mana tide. I like the totem twisting analogy for this, it works. ;)
---
I'd add that you have to be smart about moving shamans around in groups like this. Sudden loss of an FR totem could be bad business...
---
It wouldn't be my first choice, I think it should go to enh/ret first, but my raid has no Rets, and it's kind of open and available if it drops for whoever wants to craft it.. so maybe, just cause orange lol. BRE I would still prefer
---
Beer?

---
The problem on Vael is threat management, not DPS. Even mediocre guilds can kill him in less than half the time allotted, but all of the wipes tend to come from DPS pulling aggro and getting the whole raid fire breath'd.
---
Idk, blizz said it on launch day AMA
---
A very geared lock maybe. But from my experience mages/hunters love to blizzard/multishot  on pull before you can even auto attack half the mobs. Lock dots aren't instant damage so it's not nearly as bad and you have a few seconds to build aggro. But using taunt/stun/mockingblow etc you should be able to juggle threat. Also it's okay if 1 mob is beating on the dps warrior or warlock they are fairly tanky.
---
 Nice.
---
These days?
---
It's existed almost as long as people have been raiding in WoW...
---
PvE servers balance out with way more alliance
---
I currently have 8% hit with my gear but only 24% crit in zerker stance before buffs. If I can get the shoulders I can drop more hit% for crit chance (belt quest from LBRS) and wear eye of the rend as oppose to unforgiven mask which should improve overall  dpa
---
You will not be missed
---
I’ve never understood that, especially with the undead since they are the risen slain humans and elves of Lordaeron. Shouldn’t they be able to understand the alliance. Not to mention all of the lore characters interact and speak to each other
---
What level can I comfortably join an LBRS group as a mage? I just dinged 57. Do you really need 10 people for LBRS in classic?
---
When melee move out they need to wait for the tank to regain aggro before going back in. Also, consider having someone log your raids, might give some valuable insight into things like at what point in time people cast what abilities. For example, with the rogues in your raid, you can see if they're actually trying to lower their threat or not.
---
Keep telling me I don't understand the game while you waste time trying to keep an orc stunned.
---
one could say he is suffering from... Maednezz?
---
It's not bad. Not anywhere even remotely close to Shamans though. Dungeons are rough at higher levels.
---
I keep all of of the specs as Balance. So far the only "boss" I can't kill is the pyramid waves of mobs in ZF. I run out of mana even with Innervate.
---
I never use roots as everything just does too quickly. Well, at least for now.
---
Everything to do with boxing is slow. We learn to just accept the uphill grind.
---
I, personally, watch a lot of movies and youtube.
---
Honor doesn't translate into rank points directly. Ordered by honor, the top 0.3% of players with 15 HKs or more (1–2 on most servers) get 13,000 RPs whether the honor to get them to the top was 1,000 or 100,000; the next X% (2.something, I think) get 12,000, and it goes down from there. Each week your RPs decay by 20% before adding the new RPs you earned. 13,000 (max for week 1) gets you rank 4, 0.8*13000+13000 = 23400 is the max for week 2 and that gets you rank 6.
---
Nah, in fact I'm gonna install big wigs now just to spite you. Now I'm double cheating.
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
There's a guy on Thalnos that multiboxes Boomkins too lol
---
I don't know the coding behind the game but I would assume it's not. Most games need to put different areas on different servers for stability and performance. They'd probably make the game unplayable due to lag if they moved everything onto one server, if it was even possible.
---
Sounds like classic to me
---
First priority: Can you stand what the race looks like? Second Priority: PVE or PVP focused for racial. Third Priority: Time invested.
---
Level 10? That's like two hours to reroll. If looks are equal, pick Troll for PVE and Orc for PVP Hunting.
---
I can just use the horde tag and you'll know what server im from
---
[This is what the ideal Druid looks like it.](youtube.com/watch?v=Y1cX6LnMhYM). You may not like it but this is what peak performance looks like.
---
It has no data to compare to. Run an AH scan once in a while and those inaccuracies wont be a problem anymore.
---
I appreciate that Tiberium Wars clip. What a fun game.
---
code
---
The obnoxious part about ranking in PvP classic system is there is no clear honor-to-rp calculation, since it is based on your faction activity (which I understand). 
---
So, when your sitting there, it’s like “how much more honor do I need to get 5k rp? Well, Idk how much honor equals 1 rp, so better just farm 100k honor and hope for the best”
---
Tbf, decursive is actually a negative impact on overall gameplay imo. It takes any thought out of removing debuffs entirely.
---
Spy changes the game up somewhat, decursive flat out simplifies it.
---
LBRS is typically run with 5. It fits 10 because UBRS is inside of it and UBRS usually takes 10. You are probably fine at 57 to go but you wanna be the lowest level in your group not the highest.
---
You killed one Sergeant and some Grunts (looks like players that farmed for the discount/trinket), not exactly players looking for what you consider 'PvP' right outside of the instance.
---
Any of them had plenty of time to use a defensive cd or trinket the Nova and get back in the instance (i.e. the two enemy Mages that didn't Ice Block and blink away).
---
Mages are walking bombs, and you found players in a confined space.
---
After the hotfix this no longer holds true. Source: am one of the two people responsible for discovering and proving the previous GUID strategy.
---
I know exactly what the program is doing.  I'm saying that if you were to sit there with your logs open WHILE PLAYING there is NO FUCKING WAY you will be able to do the same thing without the program.  It has literally turned open world pvp into "rove around until you hear beeps and then target the coordinates it displays to the group".  It has turned something amazing and fun into some trivial bullshit.  It has taken one game and turned it into another.  And the new game fucking sucks.
---
yep, best strat is to find a cave, get the back and farm the respawns while leaving the entrance alone so it looks like no ones there. Most players wont run through a cave unmounted past all those mobs just to search for 1 honor kill when they could stay mounted roaming more prosperous areas.
---
\**Fighting back tears\*:*

Why aren't these people letting me kill them? Now they are killing me!

---
Dire Maul East is where it's at.
---
Do you think Rend can be done with a 5 man or stealth runs? Do I need all pre Raid BiS for this to work? I apologize for not knowing, this is my first run in world of Warcraft
---
The difference is microscopic. Ranged weapon skill is not nearly as significant as melee weapon skill.
---
Nah, fake twinks are worse than the legit ones.
---
Using some regular dungeon gear and slapping fiery/icy on some quest reward blues doesn't make you a twink.
---
Its like buying fake brand names so you can pretend to be rich, you just look like a poseur and lame as hell.
---
Thank you
---
it's a baby yoda tho
---
That still isn’t automation or botting
---
Never knew thought, thought there was a "loot range" for kills regardless of loot control
---
Isn't it only WSG?
---
There are parts of DBM that simply make pertinent information easier to see. It's annoying to stare at debuffs to catch the sneaky bomb debuff so you know to get out of the raid. That's tedium, not difficulty. I welcome DBM's "Hey that thing happened!" style of alerts. I want to focus on the difficulty of mechanics rather than struggle with the burdensome UI.
---
Now, the mechanics are obscenely simplistic for Ony and MC. Partly because they were developed with the shitty vanilla UI in mind, and partly because people were just terrible back then. Again though, that's a failure of design rather than a cheaty ui tool. The timers are insanely useful, but they do make content a whole lot more trivial (i.e. Shazz silence, Ony breath). I think the real problem here is how predictable bosses are rather than something a mod is doing. Again, more a design issue than information availability.
---
Difficulty through UI obscurity destroys my immersions like making a game difficult via terrible controls. I want to be challenged while at my best rather than through artificial handicaps.
---
it's not the cast, rather the tooltip. Also, I'm just assuming it doesn't work as I haven't had time to test.
---
You're not allowed to sit on rooftops where the guards cant reach you.
---
You *are* allowed (AFAIK) to aggro guards and run them around to distract them while your buddies kill everything else.
---
Are you talking about safe spotting or evading?
---
He will be a shitty guild breaker.  There are LOTS of guilds who don't even have the same 40 people each week, and if they kill rag they experience the submerge phase.
---
Ive been catching myself as being so angry lately and I feel like this is it. I legit saw warrior at 75% try to outrun (both on foot) a hunter. I message him to turn so we can both fight (me being in stealth trying to catch up to hunter). The guy ignores me and dies. Messages me after “sorry I was trying to get away”. Dude... you had a 0% of living the moment you chose to run...
---
Ok, don't then. It was your point of contention. If you're unwilling to even link to another post? I'm inclined to think you're just full of it at this point. Take care.
---
In original Vanilla WoW it was very useful for Visicidus because of the frost damage arrow proc. In private servers it didn't work one some and worked on others... but originally it did work for this boss and added a lot of extra utility.
---
Congrats, now every world pvper will target you until you have your epic mount.
---
Herod is pretty populated, if you're horde. It's got an okay amount of Alliance.
---
We'd do mc/ony in a night, then do bwl progression 2 nights a week back when I raided. Most guilds will still be doing MC/Ony for some time.
---
That'll probably be the case; our 60s are offering to run 55+ through it to help us gear and start raiding, so me and a 57 warlock will probably be the only non-60s. Thanks!
---
Lmao. Can't believe this is even happening.
---
I mean what...? 99% of those double accounts were from the need of buffbots, and not multiboxing. It is an entirely different issue. You needed a 2nd account to stay even remotely competitive.
---
No queues for Kirtonos but it's imbalanced as all hell in favor of the horde. Alliance get destroyed trying to get anywhere in the open world
---
I'm still not sure I understand.
---
There's no cap on Honor you can get, but there is a maximum amount of rank points per week?
---
You'll be a dandy and you'll like it!
---
yea the correct answer is as much as you can to simply get in the highest % bracket you can and kinda pray its high enough
---
unless you are running with the group gunning for high ranks you really heave no idea. the top 10-15 have a better idea but its not perfect
---
(not OP)
---
I've got a shaman and I'm loving berserking. It's pretty versatile.
---
Hmm, try this (with showtooltip) :
---
/cast Bloodthirst; Mortal Strike
---
Let me know if it works :)
---
My combat log was recording people not yet rendered. At the very least it records allies and party members out of render range (my only way to test really). But in testing, combat log would pick up people not yet rendered, despite max view distances and a SSD.  
---
You could detect people at BRD entrance from UBRS entrance as well, but the game does not render them because they aren't in view, and they are far away.
---
Go get FR for rag. It’s nice to be able to use less FR gear and more mitigation.
---
I would have just leveled a warrior and gained 50% dps instead of 7sp.
---
You in full tank gear or DPS gear ? I duo farmed anger for HOJ and I had to just stack plate stamina gear
---
The same talent one you have on the tooltip now.
---
    /cast [talent:1/7/1] Mortal Strike; Bloodthirst
---
There was an addon. The leader would hit a button and it would auto-queue every player into AV at the same time. There was also a component (if I remembering right) that let the addon auto-join for you at the leader discretion but they also broke that because it was abused by AFK-botters.
---
Really? These are your arguments for this not being a good clip? That they weren't a high enough rank and that they couldn't get away fast enough? The mage did blink to try and get away but he still got killed, and the others died so fast they couldn't do anything. 
---
Also, yes they were in a confined space, because that is exactly what we were looking for... smh, reddit trolls
---
Lets lure all world boss mobs to one location on each continent. DRUIDS UNITE
---
It sounds like you are bad at PVP and are looking for something other than yourself to blame.
---
All the guards are like, "Maybe it's just me that sees him. If I say something, I'll have to do work. Maybe I'll just be quiet."
---
Its not worth much. The itemization is bad, maybe ok for a pala.
---
13,000 + 13,000 = 26,000.
---
Rank 6 is 25,000
---
yeah, and they pay to play the same game you're playing. Some people enjoy getting into 30 man raids and killing other players. That sucks for the other player but there is nothing they can really do about it. That's a legal thing you can do in game. Hense, the folks who spew "Go RoLl PvE!" because technically, deathball pvping is an allowed thing. 
---
That's not what I enjoy, so I don't participate in it and getting repeatedly camped by it is hindering my want to play, but that doesn't mean they're doing anything wrong.
---
People enjoy different things, just as you probably enjoy stuff I don't like, that doesn't mean you're wrong or I'm wrong.
---
A party waits outside while the rogue slinks into the church to steal priceless artifacts and FAT LOOT! Several moments later the rogue returns with armfuls of stuff. The party huddles around the rogue and asks "well what happened?" The rogue responds with an almost empty expression "they...  are really nice people."
---
You talking about yourself in third person ?

DBM is cheating. Its just raiding in tutorial mode. Id be fine with it being removed. Would make raiding way more fun. For Auction tools, auto purchasing or selling is botting. However recording data and better organizing/sorting is not.
---
Wrong.
---
So undercity is just "sewers". Just day of the dead looking sewers. With beautiful architecture and a symetrical layout.
---
This takes two tanks, all other can dps. We do it with 2 tanks every week. First tank handles phase 1 and second tank rides middle of the road on threat by using a threat add-on. Each week she either goes right to second tank in phase 3 right away or one warlock dies and then it's on the tank.
---
“There isn’t enough time” implies that something negative will happen if you don’t meet the requirement by day x. And this is simply not the case.
---
I got one to crossroads in actual vanilla, though I wanna see if I can get it all the way to mulgore
---
You are quitting due to gear drops... that aren't even raid drops... I say quit immediately. This game isnt about ever being fully bis geared. Find the next best thing and live with that. I'll occassionally run a dungeon for a specific piece, but never even a half dozen times. Focus on having fun, if burnt out from running one dungeon more times than I've ever ran it including both classic and vanilla, go do something else that's fun in or out of game.
---
Is Runecloth bag the best bang for buck?
---
How does it work now then? fireballs are cast at random?
---
It this is the case then why couldn't spy do the same thing? My guess is blizzard protects the logs from being read by add-ons without hacking.
---
thats true, i forgot about that
---
I think just as fast as people skyrocketed to 60 and people min-maxed their mains out, people will eventually either burn out or just get bored. I think you're on the right track that people will either hit the lower rank they want for trinket and spam BG's more for fun than for rank. wPvP just isn't nearly as efficient as BG's. I mostly can't imagine people keeping up the current honor meta because there's no way that it's that fun to do for what would then be months on end.

https://strawpoll.com/3wz87d5h
---
It's not reddit trolls, this just isn't a good clip.
---
It's exactly what any other pair of Mages could've done.  Nothing out of the ordinary happened.
---
Yes, not having your hand held through simple mechanics = information obscurity
---
That’s what I thought but didn’t see the guild listed at all.
---
&gt;you still have to manually control the input for each character
---
No you dont. Input broadcasting is perfectly fine to blizz. That isnt manual control, it's software replicating your clicks
---
But has anyone seen the messenger? He carries information that could be damaging to this entire operation!
---
Put a target/attack macro on scroll up or down. No need to be clicking things.
---
You can literally do all those things without Spy.
---
1. Ancestral Healing mostly (25% extra armor to target after a critical heal). Although you don't necessarily need to cast Healing Wave for that to proc. Just bounce Chain Heal off of the tank.
---
2. Mana Tide is not great. It only affects the party, but you usually want to group Shamans with the DPS, not the healers. That means it's more of a personal cooldown than a raid cooldown. Mana Tide Totem + the pre-requisite talent (boosts the mana gained from Mana Spring Totem) is worth \~25 MP5 if Mana Tide is used once every 5 minutes, or \~45 MP5 if Mana Tide is used once in a 2.5 minute fight. For comparison, a Major Mana Potion is worth 75 MP5 if used once in 2 minutes, or over 150 MP5 if used multiple times in a 2.5 minute fight.
---
That said, you don't really gain anything in a raiding situation by \*not\* having Mana Tide. 30/0/21 builds and 0/30/21 builds have great damage in PvP and they're excellent for soloing, but sustained damage in raids is lacking. You will be healing most of the time whether you have Mana Tide or not.
---
Oh I'm taking a break, I'm playing horde on a pve server, but what's happening right now is stil ridiculous
---
Well, yeah, they're priests.
---
No you won't need full MC/ony epics, you could probably even accomplish full BWL in blues, Back in the day I joined a reroll server (Blackwing Lair - US ) That came out on patch 1.12 with a fresh start. It was super cool to start all over again that late in vanilla.. (onyxia - US was the other one I believe) and I think our tank had the most blues, we only did MC twice before clearing all over BWL and getting server firsts (Guild: Reckless, alliance.) Most of us had greens, I had no concept of a proper build or a perfect rotation for my arms warrior.
---
Back then if you had proper fight knowledge, a geared tank, and enough DPS to beat the vael wall, you could clear all of BWL in greens/blues. Knowledge made up for lack of gear. Now we will have no lack of gear, and plenty of knowledge. Although everyone I meet on vanilla did "full clears off naxx" in vanilla, so we'll start to see who really cannot handle some slightly more demanding fights
---
I dunno, I wanna know ;_;
---
Baby dont hurt me
---
Unless you are a troll hunter Carapace Spine Crossbow is pre BIS. Grats on the bow if you're troll though.
---
I'm just a dps in my raid group but we have assigned healers to their tanks just like tanks picking up their markers. It's the same assignments every week, with the unassigned healers focused on raid heals but ready to step in as a backup main heal which we'll call over coms
---
Yeah, I was horde in &lt;E N M I T Y&gt;, and we raided in vanilla/TBC, but we were terrible lol. I think we killed the third boss in BWL and no bosses in AQ40 when TBC released. I remember doing like 1 boss in BT, but forget where we were for the rest. We disbanded/reformed in WotLK as &lt;Carried&gt;, then I took a summer off and they wouldn't let me back in (my friends still in the guild told me an officer said I "wasn't dedicated enough" on my application thread lmao). I ended up quitting halfway through WotLK.
---
There was one dead in Org for days on Herod a couple months ago
---
World PvP being an unplayable lagfest really killed my desire to play. I haven't logged in a week. Going to try to play some tonight and hope I get the urge back.
---
The difference is that horde are far more active in the world. 
---
Alliance prefer to hang out in IF.
---
Spy is a garbage add-on .
---
Okay boys, step one! Have hand of rag ready to go for this guide.
---
HotW/NS is king, all the PvP essentials, dungeon tank ready, raid healer ready, wPVP ready.
---
can i get DBM to stop yelling at me in an accent? That guys calls are off to begin with, which is probably why his raid wiped. Shit's annoying.
---
Ony's aggro is fucked.
---
As a tank I've found the easiest method is to solo tank her, and have a group size of 20-25, preferably 20. 
---
Tank her like normal phase 1, phase 2 hoard some aggro on the whelps till phase 3 is about to start the get under her and beat her ass. She comes right to me when she lands.
---
This is the correct one
---
Our guild tried both Big Wigs and DBM.  We threw out both of them because they suck, our raid leaders are now manually throwing up timers for us.  We have the fastest parses for MC on our entire server.
---
I use auctioneer.  I hardly ever scan.  I shift click individual items into the search bar that I'm trying to sell stacks of because it's faster than scanning the entire AH and I post the shit mostly the old way.  It's nice having information about historical prices.  
---
I'm not using any of it against other players in combat.  I'm not using it to substitute open world gameplay.  I'm not using it to completely change the manner in which people play the game.
---
Seconding a request for a link to that WA timer!
---
Does this also mean that when BGs come out, Spy will go back to it's original potency inside WSG/AV?
---
I'm jealous bud. I'm just under 3,000/21,000 into revered and left all the WPL / EPL quests to do still. Hopefully I get Exalted before long. Scholo is my &lt;3 for the Shadow gear.
---
Tried to grind the necropile OR dreadmist set on my undead priest for a week weeks. Picked up some pieces here and there, but never once saw the boots or shoulders for dreadmist and several pieces for the necropile. In one night, ran Strath UD, got the dreadmist boots. Ran Scholo, got the dreadmist shoulders; as well as 3 pieces of the necropile in order to complete both sets in one run (the necropile chest dropped too). I was also rolling against other players too!
---
IIRC it's so early up/downvotes should affect your judgement.
---
I guess I’m the rest of the world - don’t know shit about them and am just living my life carefree anyways.
---
&gt;Which bosses should we focus on healing assignments?
---
Any boss with multiple adds. Garr, obviously; majordomo, golemagg, sulfuron, and ghennas. Rag is also worth setting dedicated tank healers, so that you can make sure tank heals aren't stacked on top of each other.
---
Really, you can just give each tank a dedicated healer, and let them switch off when their focus isn't actually tanking.
---
The tank shortage is killing me.  It seems tanks mainly run Strat Live for their orbs or DM:E (jump runs only) for their bow.  I've run both of those so many times as a holy priest (just to get into any group) even though I get absolutely nothing from either place.  I've been trying to get a DM:West run for weeks, but it's crickets in both lfg/guild chat whenever I try. 
---
In addition to the tank shortage, there's a huge oversupply of healers.  Not only are there usually 3-4 other priests also "lfg \[any dungeon\]" in the lfg channel, but then several more in-guild priests log in for even more competition.
---
How are you holy priests doing out there?
---
Meh, I don't care.  Still having fun killing them as they fly in.  And if they attack, it's a bonus to get the honor.  Plus they have to respawn, so you gank them again for honor.  It's a win win win.
---
an easily obtained quest offhand that includes _all_ schools.
---
Damn, what a variance.
---
Just checked booty bay gazzette and alliance on my server have water for 13g! Crazy the difference faction to faction
---
He's clearly talking about wowfanperson.
---
like you said it's not really necessary to care much in MC, that being said:
---
\- have all your healers download HealComm (displays a faint green bar superimposed over the tank's HP to represent the value of an incoming heal -&gt; when used effectively, greatly reduces overhealing)
---
\- assign priests to specific tanks (reduce overhealing and reduce instances where "too many people cancelled cast because they knew the tank had other healers, resulting in no one healing tank for a few seconds and then he got trucked and died")
---
\- know which fights to stack healing assignments on (i.e.: rag, garr if you kill garr first, etc)
---
\- you could look into assigning your raid healers specific groups that they should pay the most attention to (i.e.: shaman 1 pays special attention to group 1 and group 2, shaman 2 pays special attention to group 3 and group 4, etc)
---
After you kill them, /y n o H a i R
---
You're likely to strike a nerve about 50% of the time.
---
Yeah if you have fights on farm, heal meters are a lot less useful. The fight only outputs so much damage. As the DPS go harder, fights get shorter, and that total pool of damage continues to drop. This means healers become more redundant. It will look like some healers suck when in fact they just have nothing to do. DPS charts are always useful, but healing ones have more nuance to their analysis.
---
That said, the healing charts are very useful on progression fights when healers go oom and wipes are still common.
---
Early on will be the long battles as everyone will be spamming turn-ins and the quests for reputation.
---
Once everyone is exalted in a week or 2, it will be about fastest honor per hour.
---
Fake, the alliance doesn’t raid Horde cities or gank
---
I have a macro that /says my target when I cast innervate.  How do I modify it to also name myself when I have no target? (Instead of saying &lt;no target&gt;)
---
The real answer is hellfire for the chance to die to the ability, and save yourself repair costs.
---
Twin rogue farm?
---
Hey dip shit, that's not a solution. I have over 300 hours into this character ,and it takes close to about 260+ hours to hit 60. Do you think I or anyone else wants to spend another 4 weeks of their life leveling a character up to 60? That's your shitty solution? Any normal person would quit if that the "only" solution. Have a nice life lol, get a brain bro.
---
Got underworld band and nightblade literally back to back in zf awhile ago, nice 200 gold
---
My first run of DM West, the Priest book dropped. Unfortunately, it got ninja'd to sell for gold by a Shaman (Undie from &lt;Toxic&gt; on Kromcrush is a ninja:  [https://imgur.com/a/PJskv11](https://imgur.com/a/PJskv11))
---
If you are slowed enough leeway doesn't happen.  When everyone was crying about leeway every day someone posted a code dump of it and there's an ISWALKING type check it does, and it was determined that if either of you you are moving slow enough you don't benefit from Leeway.
---
I think you have to be in range of the kill to be eligible for masterloot is the catch.
---
The definition is quite subjective
---
How do you level 5 druids? Xp from mobs gotta be super small in group?
---
2nd Eye of shadow drop in dark whisper gorge after killing 2 or 3 demon chicks.
---
Dream big. Winterspring
---
Druids truely are superior creatures
---
You can buy freezing bands and/or maidens circle. That's 2000 gold right there. At least on my sever.
---
you still have to move your mouse over their name in the Spy list at the exact millisecond they show up.
---
its actually literally worse than just spamming tab and a hotkey. 
---
spy is not as big a problem as people think, they just suck. fact.
---
yeah but if he spawned right in front of him without losing stealth it's obvious he has honorless
---
Big ram fan
---
No clue, haven't talked to her.
---
shaman heavily benefits from full t1?
---
5piece bonus about the only real bonus worth a damn. not worth it to wear any pieces (except helm) before you got that.
---
When I'm in IF with my Undead Rogue I can still understand some of the NPCs talking in chat.
---
Perhaps some of these would be useful to your build?

The drinking issue just means you are casting 1 too many spells at the front of the fight or you are fighting same level or above enemies. If you mix spells at the beginning, melee in the middle and then a bandage every other kill or so it really cuts down on your drinking

I have this recipe on two chars. Both are 35 to allow for max profs. Very profitable after one month, as i bought them for 600g each. 30x20 = 600, and I think one month investment is about the acceptable prize. From now on it's 40g passive income pr day, and more as both chars also shakes salt. I would personally never learn this on a main, as the main can grind rep for earth = water without much effort. 
---
Classic is hopefully a long experience, so it's all about the long con and thinking long term. Yes water may drop in prize, but it will always be relevant.
---
I'm right with you to a degree.  My problem is that they sold us on this phase content that they broke down for us and then less than 2 months after launch have pretty much thrown everything they told/promised us about phases out the window.
---
They didn't give us dates so the speed of phases we don't really have a leg to stand on when complaining other than our personal ideas of how long each phase should be, but and I meant to shout BUT!  They broke the phase promise with Diremaul, then they told us before blizzcon that phase 2 would come early december, then they said at blizzcon jk nvm next week.  Now they are splitting BGs out of phase 3...
---
So I am having fun, but I don't see the point of rushing classic content drops, imo.  If the original phase plan is out the window for any reason, sub numbers, active player numbers, changes in dev team ideas or company leadership pushing faster releases for money reason non of that really matters because it all leads to the same answer: Give us a new phase schedule.
---
Don't just keep changing your mind and looking like you're all clueless, update the phase schedule give the community something cohesive and then stick to it.
---
Nah, two ranking nights in a weekend.

1. Two pvp geared 60?  the hunter doesnt even have his epic bow/wep he has 1 piece of giant stalker and its the boots, rest blues for raiding.  hes super geared for a "non" geared warrior to hit him and do 50% of his life pool, im guessing you missed that part too?  
---
2. Ganking low to mid 50s? im guessing you missed the 3 other 60s that had more than few epics as you see rogue and lock both have T2 helms...
---
&gt;thanks you're gone. you're such a loser for wanting the advantages of a pvp server but who can't deal with 
---
pvp server with and without honor system is 2 different things. All lvl 60's pre and post honor system will be a huge difference. all lvl60s that became pre honor system got a free ride to 60. now all the 80% of playerbase will be leveling with honor system, and prob only 20% or less will actually get to lvl60. so understanding whats happening to playerbase.. well go read up on shit man.
---
What do you mean? I love when someone takes a well-lighted camera shot of your Mac computer showing you dinging level 23 and finally completing Wailing Caverns. Don't forget the logo-placed Starbucks latte perfectly spaced on a beautifully grained wooden desk with various utensils, with a hipster plant wall in the background and cute dog overlooking a gorgeous beach view in the window.
---
imagine still complaining about Spy after it got nerfed
---
It’s pretty much impossible to do WPvP without it. The enemy has such a huge advantage if they are using it and you are not. They’ll know you’re coming and be able to pre-target you before they ever see you, including the partially cloaked stealthies.
---
On top of this it can give you a readout or how many players are in an opposing raid. You’ll know there are 10, 20 or 40 outside MC or at the entrance to BRM.
---
I hate it but it seems there’s no way to completely eliminate it. The recent nerf to CBL distance of opposing players is better tho.
---
&gt; I think the real problem here is how predictable bosses are rather than something a mod is doing.
---
I would say thats a very fair point
---
It is no easier or harder. You still need like 1,000 stacks of runecloth. Go finish off darkshore for green quests and ashenvale, but the most efficient way is to get 60 ASAP and farm the gold for the stacks of runecloth.
---
Spy -- you think you don't want it, but you do.
---
Do you think she realizes this though or maybe she enjoys it?
---
it wouldn't take 5 man hours if it only cost 5g, but yes 5g wouldn't be worth the time to farm it. Maybe you don't have a group of people you alway play with but I have a group of 5-10 people who always run shit for each other and just hang out in discord bsing the whole time.
---

---
Wait, retail shamans don't have totems? That along with 'chain' spells are the most iconic aspect of the class.
---
It's not extremely necessary or required but I find it useful to wear fire resist gear for rag. As a caster I find myself resisting his knock back attacks which gives me an extra 3-4 shadowbolts. These extra casts more than make up for the damage I sacrifice for fire res gear.
---
I’ve found Journeyman Backpacks for a little cheaper.
---
Also why did you post this twice?
---
Brought to you by GUNDERSON NUTS
---
The jewelry I already knew about being potential upgrades. The shoulders would just be useful for fire resist fights. I have a Cloak of Warding so I'm not sure I need other cloaks unless I need fire resist.
---
It's really bumming me out. I don't mind helping guildies get gear but I'd like something for myself as well.
---
Shards are easy now, but when you’re doing progression on AQ40 or Naxx and you wipe for an hour on a boss, between people wanting stones, summons, etc, your shards dry up real quick
---
/raidinfo works too.  Just FYI.  Not saying your way is wrong.
---
While I agree with some of your points, bro it's just a game lol.
---
Do I have that kind of commitment / leadership / time? Yes, but I spend it leading a successful life and career outside of videogames. 
---
I was just trying to ask the community how to grow and to find players with a similar commitment to the game, I should remind you that there are tons of people just hitting 60 now on their main toons. 
---
Did I ask how to build a super successful guild that will clear everything every week as soon as it comes out? Hell no.
---
 I could of used without the excessive gatekeeping dude.
---
Appreciate the input.
---
What exactly do those MC PUG loot rules mean:
---
Main spec over Off spec, +1, reset before Majordomo
---
Probably gotten better tbh.
---
Hasn’t realized it yet. So I’m rolling with it
---
That's because most of the dungeons you need gear from are not only exceptionally annoying, but have absolutely nothing tanks want and/or could benefit from. 
---
DM W is a perfect example. I'm a tank who farmed for Quel'serar myself, and spent a crazy amount of time in DM, and I ran DM W like three times total. It's just not a fun dungeon, there's nothing good there, and most of the book spawns are out of the way. No one likes running DM W except for Warlocks for their mount. Some other dungeons I hate doing are Strat Live and Scholo, both of which it seems people want all the time. Sorry, I just don't want to do any of those.

In addition, most tanks are leveling alts right now. We're all geared enough that there's almost nothing we need from dungeons anymore, so you've basically got tanks that are only running guild runs and then leveling alts in their spare time. The problem will likely only get worse when BG's come out - there are several pieces of tank gear from both AV and WSG that aren't replaced for several phases, so they will likely be high priority targets for a lot of players.
---
The second change is the game-changer.
---
Helpful Tips:
---
\- Invest in some invisibility potions from the AH.
---
\- Always bring a Warlock with you for summoning (so at least two of the other players don't have to endure as much of the gankfest as you did).
---
\- Travel as a group, so you're all going in at the same time and it doesn't feel like your group doesn't care about you dying.
---
\- If you can change your play schedule to low population times, do so.
---
\- When reading through the LFG channel or your guild chat, see if there are other groups trying to form for the same dungeon.  If there are, group up with them (2+ separate groups of 5) and travel there together.  Could make for some interesting PvP and not World of Farmcraft, population you.

I'm level 52 and going through the exact same scenarios on Kirtonos.  You are not alone.

Only a 100? This comment wins the internet for the year for me.

Hope that he never becoems bored of priest and picks up a shaman: "I only put down totems for bosses".
---
That's a pretty fucked up ooh la la!
---
This is the way to the promised land!....  Even squeezed in a few "morning sessions" so taking care of her "needs" doesn't interrupt the raid schedule....  Truth be told my wife is pretty damn great, she's been a real trooper!  2nd 60 is almost there......
---
so like people exploiting guards and using Spy? what else did Reddit accomplish? I'm all for No Changes but some things are game breaking
---
there are some good bis list with east and efficient choices such as the wowhead one
---
Yeah, pretty much. It's got a good number of slots and it's dirt cheap. 
---
I would recommend upgrading to 16 slotters when you get the chance, and then just sending those runecloth bags either to an alt or your bank.
---
Yeah, that's our damage. You're probably best off grabbing some green of the eagle pieces. I have mageblade/grimoire so I haven't looked into good pvp blues, I'll do some digging and get back to you. I'm assuming that crit on ogre staff will make it your best option.
---
is it possible he was completely fucked up
---
Except we weren't since addons exist since vanilla. I honestly can't imagine playing this game w/o addons, one of the fun things in mmo for me is the competition to be on the top
---
They're BOP and I'd very much doubt you can sell a run, because any particular item could take a month of farming where both buyer and seller have to zone into the instance 5 times an hour.  Seriously, it could be *hundreds of hours* of zoning in and out for the buyer.
---
I love how generalized your statement is.
---
I believe the +1 and reset before domo are essentially the same  thing.
---
It means that if you've received loot before Domo/Rag, you  can still get 1 more piece of loot on Domo/Rag.
---
Reading this felt like watching one of Barny64s classic wow adventure videos.
---
this is the best idea iv come across
---
If you're going with 60's then you'll be fine. We did LBRS the other day with a 54 and a 57 Shadow Priest, with the 54 primarily healing since he couldn't do any damage anyway. The other three were all 60's and we had no problems. Even did the Uruk event with only one death (me).
---
So was this totally wrong initially?

---
Usually in diremaul general chat. You don't want to wait too long for the person to come pick it up. Just sit afk around DM (you don't have to enter a dungeon) and you will see lots of peopel selling tribute loot.
---
The Moon is a harsh mistress
---
The typical horde response to people talking about server imbalance, nice.
---
Seems like a great use of your time for an extra 7 frost damage
---
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me you little shit? I’ll have you know I gradually reached the top guild on my server and in this game, been involved in numerous world first raids, and I have over 200 confirmed world first boss kills. I have played every class in the game and I’m the top dps, tank and healer in the guild.
---
You are nothing to me but just another casual scrub. I will wipe you the fuck out with skills the likes of which had never been seen before in World of Warcraft, mark my fucking words.
---
You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting the best pvpers on my Battle.net friends list and your Battle Tag is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, scrub. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your characters and account.
---
You’re fucking dead kid. I can be on any server, anytime, and I can gank you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my PvE gear. Not only am I extensively trained in PvP and PvE, but I have played every class and I will use them to its full extent to wipe your miserable toons off the face of Azeroth and Draenor, you little shit.
---
If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would’ve held your little fingers. But you couldn’t, you didn’t and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn noob. I will unleash the fury of the cosmos all over you and you will drown in my crits. You’re fucking dead kiddo.
---
take this with a grain of salt, I last played retail in march/april before BFA dropped. I had very few totems, mostly temporary totems like a aoe stun and snare. I think ele might have had a totem. Chain heal and chain lightening were still around though.
---
Vael is nearly pure execute range with no melee movement as well though.  It's literally just a matter of managing 2 or 3 tank transitions.
---
Classic meme
---
Some trash respawns. Shard management will never be an issue.
---
Cherrypicking happened on a PVP server\*
---
"Wait Morty! They love the slow ramp... really gets their dicks hard"
---
It really depends on 
---
1) how much you can sell the recipe for on your server.
---
2) how long you expect to play classic
---
3) How active &amp; dilligent you are with the cooldown to make it worthwhile
---
As for #1, if its close to 2k then maybe I would consider selling it rather than learning it .... but I bought my recipe for 280g, and the market price on my server is under 1k. At that point, it's definitely better to learn it and trust that it will be a good investment.
---
PvP is completely different than anything else... lmao. I don’t understand how you don’t get that. Spy makes it easier for people to attack you who can’t even see you.
---
It doesn't look like she's being sarcastic, it looks like a stroke.
---
If your server is Fairbanks, then that gnome rogue got the #1 rank in honour last week. So I would guess it was worth it. What a naive world we lived in when gear was gated behind progressively harder when clearly it should gated behind sitting invisible at enemy flightmasters.
---
Spirit of aquimantis is +20 sp off hand that you get as a quest item.  So this item gives +7 frost damage and -13 spell damage to all other spell types
---
World pvp won't be dead actually. It'll be better. I played vanilla. I played battlegrounds. I also world pvp'd. Both were great.
---
Really? I recall it taking a bit longer
---
8/8 makes healing wave tank heal spam amazing, but if the raid doesn't need tank healing, you just wear bis pieces and chain heal.
---
The latest numbers show there are 99% more Horde on Ten Storms than Alliance. 2x, that is.
---
Yeah it's so fucking dumb how I target someone I can't even see, and they're targeting me. We're not even hunters.
---
I assume most aren't using any sort of UI that helps. For healing, a good UI is mandatory.
---
I'd guess you could, just like people buy blackstone ring mara runs, but the drop rate for any particular drakestone is so ridiculously low that you're talking possibly hundreds of hours from both the farmer and lowbie/buyer to do this.  The lowbie might as well just level up and farm it on their own rather than tie up two people to do it.
---
Main over Offspec is pretty standard and self-explanatory.
---
\+1, I have no idea what that means, perhaps a loot limit? (i.e. limited to 1 drop).
---
Reset before Majordomo would seem as though they want to stop the raid and wait for trash mobs to reset before downing majordomo. Many groups do this to farm more BoE's from the trash. Once you down Domo you only have 2 hours to do Rag, so most groups will stop before domo unless they plan on running straight through.
---
Warlock first of all, 3 mobs attacked. Lifes not easy as a clothie some times but we got the job done against the mobs.
---
Went to farm Eye of Shadow from the demons in Winterspring for my Benediction quest.   It dropped off the first kill.
---
Also have found 2 Forors Compendiums in DME jump runs with the same warrior.
---
Or even worse, the 19 energy ticks
---
I've been enjoying my time in north STV as a level 32 rogue. I basically stealth everywhere and try to conceal my fighting with terrain. How many times have I died you ask? Probably 40x with 20 HKs. Its still the most fun I've ever had on wow :).
---
That post is mostly people talking about how the aforementioned proof looks fishy, I didn't go through all 25 pages but I saw the first few and last few and there are still posts about how there is no blue confirmation. 
---
I wouldn't give it much legitimacy until we see blue confirmation on what is a highly discussed and controversial policy that blizzard has.
---
Yeah, fuck this guy!
---
Since the release of Classic Wow I still don't have an SO so no, no nothing has changed.
---
I don't think that is valid syntax. Not even sure if talent is a thing.
---
I think it is "Y o u r Ba n N eD". Seriously though, don't do this. People can and will report you and there is a good chance you will be banned.
---
Because fire and arcane is used so much in raids, also not only are u missing the 1 extra frost damage but 9 int as well
---
right but that could work if they nerf combat logging harder for enemy players (example: 15 second delay on combat log in PvP; example 2: no combat log for people you are not in combat with)
---
&gt; information about historical prices
---
But that's **BOTTING** apparently. At least it's info you would otherwise not have.
---
I'm confused.....why though?
---
There are 3 options that pop up when you roll on an item. NEED, GREED, and PASS. If someone is rolling need on something for greedy reasons, that goes against even the in-game mechanics of the rolling system. Like, you shouldn't have to tell people what the definitions of need and greed are.
---
Thats literally exactly what they do.
---
We use them for distillation/reflux in our lab pretty frequently. 
---
Pharmacopeia testing can be weird
---
1-2 was my normal experience from vanilla
---
Are there any leatherworking items before you get to max level that consistently sell well i should be looking to put on the ah or sell in trade chat?
---
Due to the harsh conditions on Skeram I have become much stronger. I have even learned how to combine my soul with demons. A skill I would have never learned until December 10th
---
Yikes.  Did you quit the Guild?
---
An enhancement shaman should I put talent points on lightning shield?
---
Dropped your /s.
---
step 4 : Upgrade all the WoW expensions to colelctor editions.
---
Why do you think it's not valid syntax? I've got dozens of similar macros. And I don't know if talent is in either, but everything else I've tested is so it's certainly worth trying out.
---
That is absolutely wonderful.
---
I propose the two following additions: against enemies, put a significant delay on combat log reading of enemies. This should nerf add-ons like Omni Bar.
---
Second, nerf to the ground combat logs of enemies by only showing information for enemies you were in combat with.
---
If you don’t think Alliance getting rolled by Horde death squads is the norm on Skeram, you are one stupid fucking troll (or probably undead/orc, statistically)
---
The transfers are only available from high/pop servers to dead servers, so it pretty much describes the difference between golemagg and earthshaker.
---
I think the saying is hilarious honestly go to retail ... cool if you beat me and we were both at 100% ... but to sneak up after I just handled 3 mobs and kill me at 20% health then say that ... yeah I know you're not as good as you think you are Rogue lol
---
It's terrible last night I had to whisper 60s to join the cause so I could help a warrior friend get his Whirlwind Axe. 
---
Hang in there, BG Dec 10th
---
It was too late
---
Healbot is just a party/raid fame with mouseover macros handled for you. But it also does decursing on button clicks and changes the frame color when there's something you can remove. So it's like clique + decursive rolled up into one.
---
Could easily mean he loses his raid spot.  Not everyone is playing on a streamer server with 50,000 people.
---
Highly doubt it, but ok. I cant prove it, so you might be right here, still a shit addon!
---
Is it Grob? Because Grob Classic is the only realm I’ve ever been on in all the time I’ve played WoW where Horde feels like the less neckbeardy faction.
---
24hr mute for my friend who was saying the nword. Continue spamming it, ive been doing gotoretail since week after launch pretty much every kill and nothing. In retail its allowed, why wouldnt it be here
---
I would say so as I have seen lot recommendations for it. It also has a lot of filters and the data are being regulary updated.
---
Alliance Rogues on Heartseeker live outside the mage portal into Orgrimmar. 4 or 5 sit there all day waiting for people to port into Orgrimmar.  Port, walk 5 feet, sap. gank
---
pretty much all hours of the day.
---
there's no gear catch ups,unless u go thru diremaul and head straight from there to BWL come next year. anyone who's played from the get go understands you basically are going to be starting from MC to BWL/DM to AQ20/40 and then straight to naxx afterwards.
---
if you don't go in a progression order u can forget about raiding naxx,you wont have the gear for it.
---
At this point I can’t even get a shadowburn off before they die since they are so outnumbered
---
"Reee, an add-on won't tell me to stop standing in fire, WITHOLDING INFORMATION"
---
Yes!  In other news did you know that 80% of all math  on the internet is made up?!
---
When you see people circumventing the language barrier in game it’s never fun jabs, it is always with malicious intent as they jump around your body and proceed to corpse camp and spam it more when you die again.
---
This type of behavior may be fun for some, but there’s no denying that it is toxic to he community. It encourages gloating and generally just being malicious to your fellow player, and that type of message spreading impacts the community as a whole. It encourages players to try to make other players frustrated, or even unable to play the game. That’s harmful to everyone involved.
---
It means if an item is used for your main spec you get priority roll over someone rolling for off spec.
---
The +1 means that for each item you have received you gain a point. So boss 1 drops [a thing] that you win the roll for. You now have 1 point. Boss 2 drops [another thing] you want- you only get to roll/win the roll **if** no one with *fewer* points wants/wins it.
---
This reduces the odds of one person getting multiple drops that are relevant to them and winning them all (and screwing everyone else that needs those items over by RNG).
---
Again, not against the saying of it.  But if it was an actual duel rather than a sneak attack at very low health.  Because the saying it self is kind of humorous
---
Wait what?  I thought random enchants generally have an equal chance to roll between the different suffixes?
---
Kirtonos is like 60:40. 
---
It’s not too bad (although admittedly I am horde). Best guild on the server is Horde but Alliance can certainly put up a fight and handle their own in wPVP. I’ve seen 100+ ally raids at the big events
---

There is a nice sword in BRD for Pvp, I'm not finding a good offhand. I'm thinking rod is the way to go.
---
Lyceum is a gear/level check to keep people from emperor, that's it. Low levels will pull too many extra packs, people without aoe/lower DPS will just repeatedly wipe.
---
If you have a mage, the room can be an absolute joke; if not, then you need to be on your game.
---
if you're one shotting every mob you're moving at a lightning pace through them. just find an area that's reasonably congested (like hillsbrad farms or the pirate area in tanaris) and grind like there's no tomorrow

    /cast [talent:3/1] Mirror Image
---
    /cast [talent:3/2] Rune of Power
---
100% HP each, not sneak attacking on me getting done killing 3 mobs at once.
---
A pretty big one.
---
How do i add this?
---
Between 20-50g is typical. It depends heavily on how long the hunter/runner has been sitting on that run trying to sell it. Since they can't run more until all the loot is sold, you can get lucky if demand isnt there. 
---
On Sulfuras Horde side
---
Of course bad luck brian would use the wrong stone
---
Yeah maybe I should make a post on it. But I guess the top response would be 'blizz won't acknowledge faction imbalance'. I guess it's worth a shot though
---
You can use hunter and warlock pets to attack people not even near you or on your screen if spy detects them. That is absolutely not fair, I don’t know how high of an IQ it takes to understand this.
---
No honor in a PvP kill like that.  Kind of a bitch move
---
In retail you can fly.
---
There's a way to know accurately where a person is as soon as spy detects him if you are a hunter.
---
These stories are interesting. But OP seems like a piece of shit with no back bone or balls. I hope you enjoy watching others get walked all over, cause you’ll be walked all over sooner or later.
---
Then isn’t that “working as intended”?
---
&gt; it wouldn't take 5 man hours if it only cost 5g
---
The amount of man-hours it takes to farm something is totally separate from the amount a thing costs on the auction house. If it takes 5 people farming demons for an hour to get an eye on average, then it takes 5-man hours per eye, on average.
---
&gt; Maybe you don't have a group of people you alway play with but I have a group of 5-10 people who always run shit for each other and just hang out in discord bsing the whole time.
---
I do, and generally the way we decide *what* to run (because the same people can't be farming demons and SGC runs at the same time) is value-based, using math similar to what I was doing above.
---
If we can either do strat-live runs for my cape, hoping that it drops, hoping that it rolls "of healing", or we can do strat ud runs to the first boss for a shot at the carapace crossbow for our hunter buddy, the obvious choice is to go for the crossbow - it's low hanging fruit.
---
The *expected value* you get out the strat ud run is *way* higher than the *expected value* you get out of the off-chance you get the cloak-of-healing from strat live.
---
Once you start to exhaust all of your upgrades, your time starts being less and less valuable, and once you've already *bought* all of the upgrades you need, your gold becomes less and less valuable.
---
If every one of your 10 friends was sitting on 4k gold, and you need a 300g eye of shadow, do they all just spot you 30g or do you ask for 5 man-hours to make the run?
---
Some things can't be bought, like SGC, and some things can, like eye. In both cases, you're spending *time*. Time to farm the gold for the things that can be bought, and time to farm the runs for the things that can't. Maybe your group gets more *value* out of farming gold together (via farming eye of shadow) than they get out of farming SGC, and so they should jam that until everyone has enough gold that it's starting to be devalued, and then you can go hit the warrior's SGC farm (I'm sure he wouldn't mind having lots of extra money in his pocket).
---
Live footage of Faerlina Horde looking for Asmon
---
Golemagg has about twice as players as Earthshaker. But Earthshaker has non-stop High displayed and Golemagg has Full. So i do not think it is a dead server.
---
We have the exact same problems :) Going to onyxia we tp to Darnassus and fly down to theramore because the boat is a no-go.
---
You aren’t happily gearing up everyone else for not benefit to yourself because 1) you aren’t happy about it and 2) you are passing on loot so you have a better shot at a weapon. That is the benefit you gain by passing on loot all this time. 
---
You’ve been raiding for weeks and have no loot by choice. You could have spent your DKP on any of the rogue gear you saw drop. I think you realize this and are just looking for a place to vent your frustration, but this is a self-created problem.
---
omg the click on the healthpot gave me a good chuckle at work
---
So do I. IRL I am very cautious with what I say about other, but its a video game and its fun to make sweeping generalizations about the other faction.

It looks like he slipped into two massive loaves of bread

Face me at 100% HP and don't be a little bitch about it you know, thats all i'm saying.
---
they need a /wowboomer sub for morons like this.
---
I think, in addition to what you said, is that since tanks are in-demand, they find the people they like to group with and stick to running dungeons with those people. At least that is what I've been doing. Most of my dungeon runs are with the same 5ish other people I've been running dungeons with since level 40. I meet maybe one new person a week when we can't fill our group with the usual crew.
---
Haha, I enjoy PvP'ing as much as the next guy ... thats why I chose a PvP server.  but damn have some balls at least.
---
BWL will be cleared within the first week by almost every guild.
---
You say this but the little trash that does exist is basically its own boss...
---
The engineers, the demons, the elemental weaknesses.. I can't wait to get to it again! :D
---
roll pve carebear
---
Hahahah you should try as warrior... I almost broke my keyboard few times.
---
If you have decent AoE and know what you’re doing, it’s the easiest part of the dungeon. If you don’t have much AoE, and you don’t know what you’re doing, it seems impossible.
---
Thinking about it but it's hard to get an MT/OT spot on my server since it's 3:1 H:A. Guilds already have their tank spots filled.
---
Not really, only for rare spawns, a couple chests, and lots of silk
---
Sounds like you're the one being dramatic
---
Since youre not an orc I would honestly just go dual wield. Buy edgemasters and gain that weapon skill benifit from one handers.
---
But since you have OEB you can get away with it, for now. That being said you can go slam or not won't make a huge difference in dps, I've tried both slam spec and default 2h fury. I wouldn't even do that hamstring slam bullshit either, I never use it once and I consistently top dps as default 2h fury spec.
---
I'm gonna take a guess and say that "reset before Domo" means that all previous loot goes out the window and everyone can roll on gear that drop off Domo/Rag regardless of who has previously received loot. I usually do this just for Rag and not Domo.
---
Even with a DKP system, drops should be restricted to class/spec.
---
No, the enchants can be and often are weighted. It is similar for the Sunken Temple Drakestone which is weighted heavily toward Owl, with only ~3.5% chance of rolling the Frozen/Shadow Wrath that everybody is looking for.
---
Got it as well 1st on my warrior. Wasn’t even 60. Got so many comments as a level ~55 with IF
---
no luck so far :) 
---
\- have not seen an epic drop with \~20 days played on a hunter where i farm mobs for gold
---
\- 30-35 hours grinding my ancient sinew and not one blue drop and of course no sinew
---
\- have only won one roll for MC gear so far and I've been doing it since week 2 
---
\- entire epic mount grind consisted of farming low gold items like felcloth, runecloth, leather.  I did not get one lucky pattern, boe etc. 
---
I'm hoping all my luck is saved up for something good soon
---
Well reading an afk player is kinda hard, so the addon reads what ever it does.
---
Afk player do nothing didnt show up in combat log addon goes PIEP PIEP MOTHERFUCKER! See whats wrong here?
---
it's pretty quick. maybe not 24/48 hours quick but I remember doing it in a week with pretty low effort back in the day. you get A LOT of rep for the humanoid part turn ins (dwarf spines, gnome tails, ect)
---
I don't disagree with you, but if you want to avoid drama in your groups make sure everyone agrees with your rules.
---
sooooo like every addon? itsnt that the whole point of addons anyway?questie, auction house etc....
---
🤡
---
Ohhh yes PLEASE!
---
I did as its one of your best skills when soloing.
---
It's a pvp item
---
But I thought it's always the DPS or Tanks' fault when the group wipes, and healers are just perfect troopers? /s
---
Yea but im a mage, reset the fight with fresh cds and ready up that gnomish deathray+pom pyro
---
Like I said, I don't know if the `talent` part works, that's why I said test it out. If you're saying the `/cast [...] A; B` won't work, well, you'd be 100% wrong.
---
Just a round-bottom flask with a narrow opening
---
On Earthshaker ?
---
Way faster to farm 400-500g than farm dal rends, or edgemaster’s. 
---
Orcs have it easier than literally every other race lol.
---
We had a enhance shaman, who we promised to give spinal reaver off rag too whenever it drops first (he is orc). Rage gquit last night over not getting onyxia head, which was given to our hunter class lead. To preface we have had about 10 or so heads drop from prior weeks raids, and this week was the first week we split our raid in half and did 2 20 man groups, so we’d be getting atleast 2 heads per 20 people per week.... I was honestly blown away, good luck finding a guild that will give an enchance shaman spinal reaver. Good fucking riddance
---
Might be the better long term decision if you're sharing loot tables and he was the one that got Bindings
---
Thats why I didn't cover his name.
---
Dont wanna seem like a noob but what is dkp ?
---
Ya i dont think people are catching what suffix this rolled with, this is +27 total to Frost Spell Dmg, basically BIS even with some raid gear.
---
Yeah it doesn't get much better until AQ sadly. I'd suggest building up a healing set, it can be very powerful in pvp if nothing else.
---
The only thing I can genuinely say that makes spy broken is priests.  Any priest using spy can click your name and mind vision you ( unlimited range, no los limit ) to instantly know where you are.  That part is a bit over the top because of how good it is.
---
I cant tell if that first bit is sarcastic, but anything outside of MC/Ony fire will do more dps. Not sure about what other off hands will be able to replace it though
---
Seems to be the only time Horde attack ....
---
its the suffix it rolled with, the +20 frost spell dmg, applied before the +7, so this is a +27 gain.
---
I may be biased. I got my dalrends in four runs.
---
Blizzard even said it, that they forbid it. It was kinda big news, so just google it.
---
If I can fear it, I can kill it.
---
We gave Eye of Rag to a Shaman who isn't a very good of a healer, but he put in his time and had the most DKP. Then a drama-queen from our guild went to reddit and made a post about it.
---
He means bonus weapon skill. Like how orcs get +5 axe and some gear gives + weapon skill. There is no racial or gear that gives +fist weapon skill
---
Your post makes zero sense. Why should you be able to buy any item for 30g, if supply and demand make it so it regularly goes for 40-50?
---
Econ 101.
---
It's a legendary item that requires shitloads of resources from the guild to actually turn into one of the very few legendary items in the game.
---
Giving it to a rando resto shaman because they are lazy and haven't been spending their DKP (which is a negative to the guild) is pretty damn stupid.
---
Pretty sure DBM doesn't tell you if you're standing in magmadar's fire, ony breath, or any other similar mechanic.
---
Oh god please no
---
Dragon kill points. Basically a currency earned for attending raids and  is spent on gear in an auction style format when something drops. There are many ways to do dkp and not all are auction style, but it is with this guild.
---
I got the int spirit on of that and the fire archivist Cape on my first run of each, lol.
---
This is what we do and it works just fine as long as everyone is running HealComms.
---
too*
---
I just use the original ui - I look at their profiles and if I see a thing pop up I cleanse that shit so fast!
---
Our GM is also our MT and has this...his name is Onslaught &lt;VANQUISH&gt; on Herod.  He may get a chuckle out of this.
---
there is an ally lock that camps WS named Byre. Best player ive ever seen. I cant touch him as a warrior.
---
Haaa ok thanks a lot
---
That’s incredibly lucky. For the vast majority of people, farming 500g would be faster.
---
glad we're on the same page still 6 comments later
---
Ignore the part where the Tauren dying in  WPL talks to everyone.  And the one in EPL.  And...
---
Yeah I started building a healing set, a melee dps set, etc... It quite sucks that the best upgrades are like capes from rag and necklace from ony AND we basically can't roll on tier gear because the healers will actually benefit from it.
---
Gotta play the long game, get everyone around you geared and stack up that dkp for when it counts lol
---
This does not prevent players from continuing to do what they already are doing. 
---
I doubt BGs are going to stop the endless BRM camping that happens. Some are farming players for honor, others are just farming players for fun. 
---
It will lessen the blow in the smaller areas like SS/TM but there will still be big groups doing WPvP because thats what they enjoy.
---
Though AV offhand will be available very soon
---
No, you can't. You'll get spam reported for the ones using bad words and muted, still unlikely to result in a ban, given the lack of GMs.
---
7 sp is still pretty decent and one of the larger jumps in spellpower you'll see when gearing up.  When you start to flesh out your gear post-60 every little bit counts and adds up to significant gains.
---
I was around 320 spellpower at 60 and already had RotV and Skyshroud. Now I'm close to 370 after another month of play and optimizing.  It was mostly a few spellpower here and there.  Replaced my Omnicast boots with +29 BOE (+7), replaced Earthwarder gloves with Felcloth gloves (ok, kinda a big jump, +11).  Replaced Hypnotic Blade with Mind Carver (+3), and then BotNM (another +7), replaced Felcloth shoulders with +29 boe (+3 sp), etc.  Soon enough you have an extra 40 or 50 spellpower.
---
8 piece is only good for single target heals, and actually ends up making you a piss poor raid healer, while bis no set pieces, make you a great all around healer. 
---
t1 stats generally suck, other then the 8 piece for that niche tank healing.
---
Yes, I am alliance on Earthshaker.
---
&gt; In retail its allowed 
---
you should go back there
---
713 victories - Gratz !
---
81.4% spell coefficient it's like 5.7 damage, ha.
---
Mine, I don’t believe likes me playing the game too much. They feel as though it’s cutting into our time, but it really isn’t, I’ve done the math. I’ll be playing for awhile and everything is fine, until they come up and lay down by my feet just looking up at me. After a little bit I start getting tennis balls dropped in my lap.  As soon as I jump on discord and start talking, the confusion levels rise up, because I’m talking and not with anyone they can see. Everything works out fine with a pat on the head, and a game of fetch though.
---
The Reddit classic community is just full of a bunch of whiney babies.
---
I am cleanly shaven thank you very much
---
Is BUR the alliance version of KEK?
---
Great!
---
Dont ask for it then.
---
Props for actually proving you had that number of runs instead of it just being "idk it was prob like infinity runs i did it for 2 whole hours so... yeah it was a lot"
---
For ZF I wonder if there is a macro shortcut you could make that would have all 5 druids attempt to root a different mob through an iterator (inital target, second druid "tab" input to n+1, third druid "tab" to n+2, etc.) to almost get an aoe earth grab affect to help with CC?
---
Should the Gladius Add-on be removed? or DBM for BGs? They count down the flags in AV, let you know how long you have until the towers are capped, etc.
---
Gladius for Arena was a very strong add-on, instant focus targets, you knew class/spec the second the gates opened even if they were stealthed.
---
They're just add-ons. They make things easier. They're available for everyone.
---
Why handicap yourself though?
---
In another thread someone told me
---
&gt;If you master loot you can loot items dungeon wide. 
---
Is this true?  I always thought that you need to be in range of the mob kill to be eligible for loot.
---
Minority? Everyone who is defending this addon is a moron and is probably also cheating in various games... cause this addon is like a wallhack, you know that someone is near, but you cant see him and you can have the first hit on him etc.
---
As a priest when I would have had that addon ( I dont!) Enemy shows up I use mind vision on him, I know exactly where he is... op? YES! Last night I was in hearthglenn, I heard the kick sound, checked combat log, typed ./tar xxx had him as my target used mindvision, saw him killed him (he was in the tower next to me obv.)
---
No one needs such addon!
---
/r/boneappletea
---
He was actually not spending his dkp because he wanted hand of rag, he passed on every upgrade. He doesn't even try in raids like at all and got rewarded with hand of rag.
---
Right. that is literally the reason why they do it lol
---
So as a feral tank for a guild just starting our MC journey in Classic I look at it this way.  I raid for fun and community, I love my guild (15 years next month woot woot) and me having barely any upgrades from MC translates to 39 other people gearing that much faster.  I mean if you just want sweet loot idk what to say.
---
A lot of it works better as a vendor shuffle instead but the crafting time can be pretty lengthy
---
After a certain point, it's acceptable to let everyone know that you don't have time for that bullshit and bounce.
---
Hey man, I just wanted to say that from what I've read Deviate Delight is hugely alliance sided. My main is Stalagg Alliance so I know all about being slaughtered and figured you may want the early warning. Look into this a bit before committing if that's a concern for you.
---
I will say, we wanted to do RP-PvP for our horde alts since our Alliance is on a regular PvP server, so we rolled alts on Grobbulus just the other day. It seems to be really balanced and I might honestly suggest rolling horde there if you want an RP-PvP server with balance. I haven't made my character yet personally, but all my friends have; if you want to group up with us, let me know!
---
So you decided to make the situation worse?
---
:)
---
Okay, I'll dig around for some blue posts from blizzard and re-edit the comment. If I can't find it, I'll just edit it to remove the link. Thanks!
---
100% agree, people think this raid is much more difficult than it is.
---
I bought mine 2 weeks ago for 25g. Heard someone bought it for 20g not too long ago. PVP might've increased the price actually...
---
Whitemane-Alliance
---
One of our officers ragequit the guild and tried to get a bunch of other people to leave because the second raid group, which he wasn't in, gave mageblade to a PUG mage (they won the roll, and we were pugging because we were short of 40 on the second team).
---
To be fair, people were high strung for a lot of reasons. They had also tried to re-work our fuck awful DKP system, and in the rework effectively quadrupled everyone's DKP. So people had like 6 weeks worth of banked DKP when we had only been raiding for 3 weeks, on top of items people had already won.
---
Surely you mean "a dog eat dog world" ?
---
Did you mean "It's a dog eat dog world"?
---
You can clear bwl in prebis I'm sure
---
I think this is obviously more a case of attention seeking whining. You can quit without announcing it. They even include a little box so you can TELL BLIZZARD why you're quitting, as the rest of us really don't care?
---
After a couple weeks, I got fed up and rerolled warrior.  Feels good to deny the random whispers of people wanting you to tank for them and just do whatever dungeon you want.
---
In general, friend. There are exceptions to every rule :)
---
Right so what's the big deal?
---
In the movie they switched from orcs talking english and humans gibberish and vice versa. Seems like not everyone understands common.
---
That's not the point though. To be frank, nobody in the game cares that you have a job/life, they care about what you do in the game. It sounds like what you do in the game is play a pretty semi-casual amount of time and not show up to raids as prepared as possible (and sometimes not show up at all!), which isn't a bad thing and you're not a bad person, but it also doesn't put you on the same level as someone who does as far as importance to the guild/raid. 
---
We just had a problem like this where our top dps player every single week had been trying to get the same drop since week 2 of vanilla, it dropped, and a dude in all greens/blues tried to roll on it. We said fuck that, gave it to the one who's been carrying our asses through MC for months now, and the guy in greens/blues was totally cool with it because he knows he's not as valuable as our top player. Basically, you're not entitled to stuff just because it's an upgrade, it's an upgrade for everyone else too, gotta earn it. It is totally bullshit if the GM didn't make those rules clear from the get go, however.
---
I got Blackblade on my first full UBRS run. Beat two other warriors on rolls.
---
I tanked bfd yesterday on my 26 warrior and when we kill the final boss a nice 2 hander drops. Sweet, I think to myself.   
---
Only for the healer to ninja the sword. Apparently he needed the mount money, whole hoping 70 silver. Some people are just morons
---
And they have character transfers too
---
Here come the PvP police.
---
I recognize Blizzard has made a decision, but given that it's a stupid-ass decision, I've elected to ignore it.
---
Problem: Whining, everyone on a PVP server chose a PVP server.
---
Solution: Wait for Goonsquads to get bored and for BGs to be released. It will get better over time.
---
Wait seriously? I thought it was purely a lore thing, the reason you explained sounds incredibly stupid. Why is shit talking a bad thing?
---
That was blizzard giving you a second chance to man up
---
Ya, that's my point because I don't use Spy. But saying people don't pick their targets is definitely not true. I also wanna deny as many HKs to these ppl as possible.
---
Alright nice that's helpful. I believe tribal is the best money making LW specialization but any insight into if that's true or not?
---
It’s always funny when someone without access to the source code of a game says making a particular change will be “super easy in fact.” Even the most experienced software engineers can’t make that sort of speculation without knowing for sure how Blizzard wrote the code you want to change.
---
What is this elemental invasion event?
---
Jesus... Your officers need to step their game up, that never should have happened. Legendary items are the *one* thing that I think should be loot counciled; and definitely shouldn't just be a straight DKP bid.
---
make detect magic great again
---
Lol I know this is irony but I legit didn’t know this for the first couple of raid weeks
---
You sound really cool
---
My concern stems from the fact that of our shaman, I'm the only one who came into classic wanting to heal. The others are doing so for the chance at ele and enhance gear, so it's painful watching people take healing gear they don't even actually want.
---
Looks like a NR pot to me better mouseover before you say shit.
---
ColbyBro,
---
It seems you are taking this personal as the responses you have received aren't what you were expecting.  I typically leave personal opinions out of conversations on Reddit, but it seems you don't have the same capacity.
---
There are exceptions to every rule, therefore, I think you're too full of yourself (which is why you think your time is more valuable than mine -- here's a hint, **we're all part of the same system**) and are upset that everyone here didn't cheer for you.  
---
Your clip does not show "higher tier" game play, it shows two Mages spamming their AoE into a group for 10 seconds, we've all seen this 100s of times by now.
---
Take into account, that two days ago, we saw [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dyw0kq/new_mage_aoe_farming_spot/).  The reason that post was successful was due to the scenario and actually involved some setup into an irregular grouping of enemies.
---
**2v7** is very impressive for ***some classes*** in ***certain situations***, but not two Mages against half played characters that are all chilling outside of an instance.  They had 5 globals to defensively act and didn't, which is why KnusperKnusper said they were half AFK.
---
I hope you continue what you consider to be PvP, if that makes you happy.  Gather enough content to make a montage and post that, it will be more accepted than a single clip of "Mages doing normal Mage things."
---
So for any race other than humans, you are absolutely right, +4 weapon skill is very awkward, and doesn't benefit you very much. For humans, it reduces the glancing blow penalty from 15% to 5%, which is fairly decent for threat, especially for fury/prot.
---
As for weapon dps, I must disagree, but I will grant that weapon dps is a way that warrior threat scales, so to say its not very important was incorrect of me. What would be more accurate is that it is less important than other stats. For deep prot, crit is your primary means of increasing threat generation, followed distantly by attack power (and consequently strength). Only your threat from white damage and heroic strikes get boosted by weapon dps, and I will admit, I was wrong to dismiss it as I did, because these (especially heroic strike) do generate a decent portion of your threat. For Fury/prot, the stat priorities for threat generation are the same, crit is still king with AP after it, but AP is far better than for deep prot, due to bloodthirst. Weapon dps might offer more benefit to fury/prot, but only due to fury/prot having more rage to use for heroic strikes.
---
I'm mad at my boyfriend because he refuses to tank our 50th BRD run to get HoJ. I just want him to get the trinket!
---
Yes but you wouldn't be running around without an offhand if you didn't have this item, you would be using the +20 spell damage one which takes about an hour to get, which means this is a +7 frost damage item only.
---
awesome, but the spirit of aquimantis doesnt take 1100 runs and is only 7 less SP. I would imagine you could have farmed more relevant pieces from better dungeons. Made more money, then not felt salty when AV comes out in like 2 weeks :/
---
&gt;but I'm not sure how much less interested in BGs they are
---
I feel like 15-20% of PvE realm players aren't interested in PvP at all.
---
Yeah, you're right, it takes barely any time. And if I can do it without a healer, so much the better.
---
The irony is that there are plenty of dps willing to help me out, but over half of my healers are raid logging, which makes getting anything done really annoying.
---
What kind of dps increase can a raid expect from items like Annihilator and Nightfall? Obviously depends on raid comp but I'm just trying to figure out how beneficial 600 less armor is.
---
Synergy is cringeee
---
Things like this are completely unnecessary
---
Ride the walrus.
---
What about that combopoint counter? It looks awesome!
---
It was intentional
---
Top guilds have the dps to beat patchwork enrage and we’re still only in phase 2. You really think vael is going to be a struggle when everybody is pushing 250% of the dps they did back then?
---
Yeah, true. He even told me that he's rolling on the shield that drops from Garr (he has the epic engineering shield that you can craft, while I have the UBRS shield). Tonight we're doing LC so I hope I'll get it first whenever it drops. Lol
---
gay
---
Not all the pugs were kicked out. Raid still had 40 people in it but the dead people from a guild whose remaining members were sitting on the side of the fight saying "We are just waiting for you to wipe" were kicked to make room for living guild members.
---
rend cant crit also
---
Its green Gatorade
---
Never heard of it not getting it sounds stupid
---
For enhance devilsaur set is good. And i was thinking of black dragonscale but I already have the devil legs and chest from brd with 2% crit. Helm from sm with 1% crit.
---
I don't think pre raid there are really any good enhance shm sets.
---
Idk. I’m a level 24 shaman and was fighting a mob and a level 29 night elf Druid attacked me and even though I died I got her health most the way down.
---
Sometimes you gotta cut out early - had a UBRS Group the other day and the leader put it on master loot right when we started clearing. Everyone in the group was asking him to change but he kept saying weird shit like “I don’t want ninjas ruining my raid lead reputation” and “I’m fair, you’ll see”. I was the only healer and ended up just saying “This is weird, I’m leaving” after five minutes of everyone protesting the loot style choice. Probably saved a ton of grief.
---
That's a temple prime disaster
---
If this really is your worst dungeon experience then you've had it really good.
---
That went out of phase because people in this subreddit complained incessantly.
---
I believe you do need to be within a distance when the mob dies.
---
That's not exactly what I'm asking though, that sounds like they were there for the kill.  The scenario I'm asking about is if say someone was at the entrance while you guys killed Magmadar, could the loot be ML'ed to them even though they clearly weren't in kill range?
---
Basically my minimap in plaguelands
---
Multiboxing is just for people too shit to play solo.
---
How do you 1v1 if you're not a rogue. Yes 1v1 is more efficient, but you're not gonna find many 1v1s and get stomped by any group over 2. It's just no realistic unless you're a rogue/druid.
---
Cool idea. Finaly someone with a helpful advice without any stupid remarks.
---
Level 39 paladin twink?
---
This is not true. There is a maximum range on Master Looting. If a BOE drops from trash while your Master Looter is too far behind in MC, it will open roll the item. 
---
It comes up pretty often in my raid group because working through our DKP sometimes takes a while so it's easy for the trash pulls to get pretty far ahead.
---
We have everyone pass on the item except officers but this could definitely be a problem for pugs so make sure you're not too far.
---
Yeah, and it applies to every spell and was like that way back in the day too. If you look up the spell coefficient you’ll find data over various patches but here’s a post that was done for classic specifically. 
---

---
One of the big reasons why feral is considered bad is the lack of itemization for it. You are basiclaly out of luck for the most of game.
---
As a warlock without mining or herb what is better to farm Mara or DM East? With herb or mining what’s better?
---
Mages:  "Pssst!  Want a cinnamon roll?  Smart water?  First hit is free!"
---
I love world pvp, but hours of corpse camping is not fun.
---
We can't leave the fp or towns without getting ganked over and over again. 
---
We even have to wait for the increase ress timer after each death.
---
Getti g to MC involves 10+ corpse runs moving 40yard each time. And it takes over half an hour.
---
The user is not making five inputs, the software is.
---
The user is making one input.  They are hitting one key.
---
Healbot got destroyed in vanilla, when it was as ridiculous as spy is.
---
How’d you get it up the lift? Or did you go the long way around ferelas?
---
Its always funny when someone comes in and pretends they know how hard programing is ***especially when the question is printing a line of text in a box.***
---
/smh
---
Farm MC and sell the BoE's on AH that your members don't need. 
---
Sell the Ignots off golemag, ony scales, etc. Even firey cores, dark iron ore,  and leathers hold a good amount of value.
---
It has awful range but it has always been that way.
---
What kind of Lovecraftian horror is that?
---
It will take much longer than 100 days to break even because you would be transmuting something else in its place if you did not learn it.
---
I'd only recommend this recipe for people who have a lot of spare gold right now with nothing to spend it on because this investment will protect it from inflation.
---
And now AV is out in under 3 weeks making this irrelevant.
---
You are correct, there is a range on Master Loot. In MC runs, it's not unheard of for the loot master to miss a BOE drop that's out of range.
---
If an item is out of range, it will open roll to the raid group. My raid group is a guild group so we pass on it and let an officer grab it to trade for DKP later but it could certainly result in ninja'd items in a pug group so be careful out there
---
Priest.
---
“Need”, for what?
---
shit player proposes shit solutions to non existant problems
---
True, I just want a new shield! Lol. And because he still sucks as a tank. He was a mage when I joined the guild, this is his 4th week as the OT. I'm getting the bindings next and luckily, the ore from BWL will be rolled for between the tanks and not funneled to him.
---
Buddy and I ran three buff accounts to have everything possible.
---
It's more than that dude, the range is way lower than melee range. But yes it's working as intended, becuase the intended version is garbage.
---
it's bullshit lol
---
I did two Strat Live runs one day on my priest. First run Truefaith pattern dropped and everyone needed and I lost the roll. Next run with a different group the pattern dropped again and everyone let me have it!
---
You are comparing things with uncomparable.
---
Nah man. He’s fully bis geared; he just needs to know what bis gear he should get.
---
youre free to reroll to the objectively superior faction.  i wouldnt blame you.
---
dm north?

Again? What else made the front page from our server? I feel like ours is never talked about.
---
This is me during work nights. Lol
---
Morgraine is 58% horde, 42% alliance for level 60 characters according to community census. 
---
If you’re a Morgraine horde player and genuinely feel like any area is alliance dominated, you’re either delusional or a troll.
---
guidelime is very adaptable. I use a mod for it called Sage's leveling guide. You can jump to different sections depending on your level. Then you can jump ahead in those sections for stuff you've already completed.
---
I don't think there is a class in WoW that can attack beyond render distance, Hunters can get up to 41 yards with an attack and 100 yards with Hunter's Mark. 
---
I still have yet to get a sourced response from anyone claiming a 200 yard spot radius (outside rendering distance) for the old Combat Log.
---
Your west or mine?
---
yeah i have this problem.... really annoying
---
God I bet playing WoW on a flight is so comfy.
---
If by full uptime you mean constant spell pushback then yeah.  It is a big help to melee but ends up hurting ranged, not to mention the fact that he kills a random mana user and the tank every so often so you have to kill him fast or wipe.
---
The execution is not difficult and it is not a huge gear check, but it is still a gear check.  We will see how much HP he actually has.
---
Kys multiboxer scum
---
I sell mine for 50-65g. Depends on how many ppl are currently interested. If I get like 6 ppl whispering there are always a few willing to pay 65g. Especially bc others on my server trying to charge 80-90g now that they've finally caught up me doing it (I stopped for a while bc I made what I thought was enough money and since noone else was delivering there was a gap in the market on our server) (by the way, it wasn't enough - there's no such thing)
---
This is no longer a debate or constructive feedback, it's simply you being facetious and trying to raise yourself up by subtlety degrading me as a person.
---
I hope you find what makes you happy in life, outside of WoW and calling other people trolls on Reddit that attempt to offer explanations on why their content wasn't accepted among the community.
---
"Normally I would say auf wiedersehen... to you sir, I say, good-bye."
---
If they are a detriment to the raid bench them. If they are following the rules and showing up they have the right to spend earned dkp
---
To be honest, classic is all about numbers. If one side has 7 and the other has 6, even with really good gear the numbers side will have the advantage. It’s more this pussyfooted attitude horde players have
---
Why do they ban bots, they pay for accounts? They're losing money by banning them. That's your logic.
---
You're simple misunderstanding the difference between a both and a multiboxer in terms of what blizzard considers bannable and what they don't.
---
I am against multiboxers by the way
---
Funny thing is that I am one of those rogues that got R4 by farming IF, was stating the fact for whiners :)
---
people like you are why tech support get headaches
---
Dunno if you know this but you can clear MC with brain dead people in blues. No one needs to spend their DKP on epic gear to clear the content.
---
how do you make your DBM show the Acid Breath, Wing Flap ?
---
&gt; . It's as if he literally could not see party chat - which may be the root of all these problems, who knows. 
---
I meet people like that reaaaally often
---
No, thats not how that works
---
Long story short: There was an update for Classic, I tried to download it but kept getting an error message, so in the end i try uninstalling battle net and re installing, nothing.
---
So then i uninstall wow classic and whenever i try to re install it i get this message
---
It does for Magmadar, and most similar mechanics. 
---
On Ony it can't because it's a way faster stream of fire that does burst damage.
---
It still warns you the breath is coming, so you don't have to actually pay attention.
---
With an eye, I would give it out based on the shaman actually capable of making it.
---
If some enhance shaman who is bad at healing puts in no effort to gear or heal gets it -- its highly likely they won't make it at all.
---
&gt; Do you realize what you are asking ?
---
Its pretty clear.
---
I can't say it was wrong but it seems outdated. Theres been plenty of attrition since then, transfers, etc.
---
Much of the info is contradictory to Ironforge, too.  Your link shows Pagle out numbering Herod severely. Ironforge shows the reverse. I can't say which is correct, but I'm inclined to lean towards the more recent numbers.
---
He had me in the first half, not gonna lie...
---
My guild in vanilla gave our first Thunderfury to a paladin for PVP. Council decided that since he was at every raid and lead all the PVP he should get it. Gave our first hand of rag to a different paladin.
---
I understand that, but does your guildies get so much gear that it makes you undergeared for future content?
---
Why?
---
Its a quote from a movie people , he meant doggy dog world
---
WPvP is Phase 2
---
WSG/AV was supposed to be Phase 3
---
AB was supposed to be Phase 4
---
PvP server don’t complain /s
---
[https://imgur.com/HIK9KMB](https://imgur.com/HIK9KMB) it says i cant use special folder etc etc but it literally just gets stuck on this page
---
no changes
---
I thought about grabbing some Cenarion gear to mix and match for pvp.
---
Yea that seems fine, for raids you DS suc, but for solo farming you DS Void, gives you like 100+ hp every few seconds so you essentially have unlimited mana/hp with lifetap/siphonlife
---
What I do if my group takes a chunk of damage is berserk, inner focus, max rank prayer of healing. Beeskering has the same cool down as inner focus too so it’s easy to see when they both come up, and prayer of healing has such a long expensive cast I only like to use it with the other two.
---
Is your friend 11?
---
&gt; You dont need to be a dev to know they cant ban it, it works by parsing the combat log so only way to ban it is to remove the combat log.
---
Nope.
---
Easy fix would be to not log opposing faction player actions in the combat log unless they are directed at you.
---
Nightfall is phase 3 I believe ?
---
We do P1 white damage (auto attacks/wands from DPS, tanks still using aggro generating abilities), as P2 begins to pick up, just before she starts running towards the center/entrance to fly we start using all abilities. Burst/burn her down as quick as possible until right around when P3 starts. As P3 approaches, all DPS stops while she's in the air and wand her down until she drops and the tank has her. DPS finishes clearing all welps. Once aggro is maintained, you just monitor threat meters and dps accordingly. Need to drop threat? stop dps/wand. We still allow some dots but try not to overload it. Paladin's put wisdom and light on the boss so wanding/autoing helps maintain hp and mana.
---
Banning a bot is a $15/month loss in revenue while banning a multiboxer would be a $75/month loss.  
---
I do understand your point, but one is definitely an easier pill for them to swallow than the other.
---
Not in the original phases given.
---
Nothing honestly... our guild did free rolls when we had to pug folks but since that ended and we are now doing full guild runs we have loot council.  They are very fair in giving out loot and spread it around.  We also go clear MC trash again on an off night (with 20-25 people) for an hour or so to get a few additional drops - currently averaging three or four purples on each trash clear night.  That way BOE belts and bracers are almost all set for the raid group.
---
We did however had a drama queen that quit the first week we did loot council because he didn't get any loot.  He already had his T2 helm as well as a couple other epics from the week before and got butt-hurt because only one piece of Pally gear dropped on the MC run and it went to another of our 4 paladins.  He waited until after the run, made a comment about being a top 2 healer in GC and then told us all to F-off and quit.  Better off with him gone IMO.
---
Half the time (or more) the guild drama is caused by a player and not by the officers.
---
I need to save this post, it changed back
---
I hope you can find the same outside of Reddit! It appears your last year here has been pleasantly filled with ego-increasing karma that I assume doesn't follow you outside this place.
---
Nice use of a quote too, classy
---
Hey, at least he provided a screen shot.....
---
The bell curve of people aren't 60 yet.  As they approach it, all those high lvl raw materials start becoming more plentiful.
---
DRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
---
Ran this dungeon once and we just couldn't kill the dragon boss at the end.
---
They already did, lowered the distance from 200yd to 50yd. Today that is.
---
It just occured to me you may also mean for looting. You could look for interact with mouseover keybind and bind the alternate to mousewheel as well
---
It sucks for us horde too. Imagine running around for half an hour and not seeing a single alliance. Stalagg-Horde problems :/
---
Whats sad is ret still has lackluster dps in pvp if you can break up their initla hammer "burst".
---
But such a large change? We’re talking variance in the 100,000’s alliance swapping to horde or alliance quitting without horde quitting.
---
I just checked all our casters' and healers' gear in the most recent logs, and it looks like he replaced it with the DM blue and no one else is wearing it, so I assume we haven't seen another drop in the 10+ weeks we've been clearing. Certainly not in the 5 or 6 since I hit 60.
---
Hopefully when BG comes out it will get better. I'm on Grobbulus (US RP-PVP) which is one of the most balanced but still every flight path is camped by someone. Not always horde doing it but everyone is just farming honor non stop.
---
Bow skill is only really gonna help you until BWL where the hunter weapon is a crossbow.  
---
The haste buff is definitely better than the orc racial (as in, does something) but if you PvP at all, the Orc passive is really nice.  
---
And more pet damage aint nothing, though in raids unless you really care about your pet and its damage its gonna be dead more often than not.
---
How?
---
Why are you in a DKP-based guild that doesn't reserve Eye of Sulfuron if that's how you feel about how loot should be distributed?
---
wat.
---
That is entirely wrong.
---
1 point of either, spellpower or frost damage increase Frostbolt damage by 0.81428.
---
Can't be orb because he is wearing horde scout tabard
---
This is what I was thinking.. thanks for the tip.
---
I mean all it ever really was, and still is, for me is Gladius arena frames for world pvp.  The stealth detection is so overstated, people act like it's super broken when it's barely useful.
---
Join Dingus Bankus
---
it's always funny when people like you do the same thing but in reverse and act like changing code is some kind of impossible feat.
---
like it would be impossible for blizzard coders to tweak how the combat log works without causing the whole game to crash like a jenga tower if they change one thing. gimme a break.
---
He's talking about OP claiming there's a difference between school damage vs spell damage on spell coefficients.
---
Silent bid is my guilds method (with class/ role prio) and its my preferred method. Open auction takes longer and can create bad feelings
---
Does fade reduce my current threat or just the threat of future spells?
---
"Best off" is true, but you're by no means SOL. Yes, you need to be exalted with Darnassus. Any quests that reward Darnassus rep helps towards this, and since there's a bunch of those quests in the N Elf starting areas, you would get a bonus by doing these quests over other quests.
---
But in the long run it doesn't matter that much. There aren't enough leveling quests in the entire game to get all the way to Exalted. You're going to be getting the bulk of your rep with Runecloth turnins, no matter where you leveled. If you want, go back and do the lowbie Darnassus/Darkshore quests, but honestly once you're 60, it's probably more efficient to just farm humanoids for runecloth and turn those in, or buy it from the AH.
---
Must be using spy.

met with them to convince them to stop hosting pirated servers lol...

You have a chance to block 1 extra damage for every 20 points of strength. Sooo not very impactful.
---
What DBM really is: Automation of gameplay, better known as BOTTING
---
The program is not only doing something that no human could possibly accomplish with their logs open in front of them. The "It's just reading the logs" argument is invalid. The level of information it's obtaining is far beyond human capability. It's completely replacing the need to be situationally aware.
---
What do you call it if I run a program that looks all around the map for me and gives me all of the information about the game that is far beyond my human capability? What am I doing? Am I playing the game? Or am I automating the game? Seems like if my computer is doing a whole bunch of stuff that is really far beyond my capabilities and then trivializing the actual gameplay from "look everywhere because they might be coming at any time" down to "follow the idiot beeps and coordinates displayed by stupid program because it has more data than your brain could hope to ever process." If I had a program that is literally taking 90% of the work I had to do before: scouting, panning camera, coordinating actual brain function and making human decisions. I have a program that pretty much plays the game for me. We have a word for this. It's called a bot. It doesn't matter if you still have to input 10% of the controls yourself. The program is still literally doing 90% of the work you had to before. I don't care if it only has 50 yards range. It still exists. And it's still playing the game for way too many players right now.
---
Damn I didn't even need to change anything

HP, Frost resist, dash and bite.

Blizzard already broke it. Read recent combat log distance reduction blue posts.

Shit, you’re right, the difference is that frost damage is adding the full amount but spellpower is “up to” the amount. My mistake.

---
&gt; There are many ways to do dkp and not all are auction style, but it is with this guild.
---
My guild in vanilla had fixed-price DKP, went to whoever had the highest DKP total and wanted it (some exceptions on priority for the MT). I didn't really like the idea of changing to it (from rolling), but in the end I must say it worked just fine. Certainly better than a loot council with any but the best council members.
---
Welcome to vanilla raiding.
---
This post needed this,   I can’t tell you how much I love when whining bitches see the truth.
---
You are correct but its not worth arguing about. Most people on these forums have their opinions shaped based on the fact that Blizzard said they won't ban for it, thus people use cognitive dissonance to reason how it must not be automation.
---
It is automation. It is exactly the same as pressing 1 button to make 5 actions. The software used for multi boxing is the same software used for automated bots.
---
Blizzard is objectively hypocritical in their decision to not ban multiboxing but that's their choice. Their reasoning is not logical or valid.
---
That's shitty, bad officers make getting loot distributed properly hard.
---
This is why I haven't try harded on pre-raid bis. I got good enough to contribute in a raid and over the past month spending 5 hours a week on raiding I can get far superior items. Gotta learn to pick your battles when it comes to farming.
---
Even if you're not a fan of his videos, take a look at Punkrat's video on YouTube about classic PvP system. It's detailed pretty well.

https://wowpop.appspot.com/realms/mograine
---
Alternatively, go to Gadgetzan right now. Or really, whenever you want. It's been camped 24/7 since phase 2 started. By alliance. Same for Feralas, Azshara, or really any other 40+ zone
---
I've seen enemy priests up there before
---
What server are you on DarkArcanus? That sounds too similar to my server where I saw 5 warriors hanging around IF at 3am in the morning, each with a Quel claiming they got theirs in 4-8 runs. I'm sure a fair amount we see were purchased but damn it really does seem like a disproportionate amount of tanks are claiming they got the book quickly.
---
I think silent bid is much better than auction.
---
It TEMPORARY lowers your threat by a large amount. Hopefully enough time for the tank to pick it back up. Usually it's enough to have them aggro someone else.
---
The increased bow isnt that amazing.
---
Ranged skill doesnt give as much of an impact as melee skills do.
---
I started using shadow unit frames with classic and am really happy with it. Easy to set up and works with most other addons (enemy cast bar etc.)
---
I'm not sure I completely agree with your 30g figure. In a perfect world, sure. But practically, people die on their way to DM and I've had other issues that makes selling stuff a hassle. If I can do a run every 20 minutes I'm going to need more than 30g for the trouble unless it's a stealth class that can go by themselves.
---
Cause I am a shark, who eats doggie dogs
---
I’ve also joined groups (Lfm ubrs full run) that ninja swap into something else (ie Jed run). Confirming at the start is much better than finding out at the end.
---
Sulf's an actual complete back-and-forth warzone on both sides of the faction line. I love seeing and joining the zone dominance struggles in EPL/WS/BRM.
---
After 1.12, there was no point at all in which warlocks suffered. Warlock dps only improves with scaling. Mages do as well, but the debuff restriction doesn't harm lock dps.
---
It does not benefit from 100% of spell damage its coefficient is only 81%
---
Yeah these are the type of people who shouldn't be on a pvp server. They can't handle the bad moments of world pvp.
---
raid time works well, I can't do weekends or tuesday raids so having a wednesday night raid is nice for me.
---
*oomers
---
I guess since I don't need many things I can save my rolls for things I really want like the Band of Accuria and the Ony necklace.
---
God I hate this mantra.
---
DPS get shit on first, Tanks get shit on rarely, Healers get treated like special snowflakes and you can't hurt their feelings. 
---
The fact of the matter a shitty tank generally hurts the run the worst, a shitty healer hurts the run the second worst, and shitty dps barely affect the run because you need 2-3 of them for it to matter. A great player in any of those slots give you so much leeway. 
---
I've DPS'd, I've tanked, I've healed. I've ran every dungeon in Vanilla and BC and I've done all those rolls in pretty much every raid and dungeon. Healing is easy, it's fucking cake, you stand at the back, cleanse and press a button to make a bar go up and you can watch the fight. I also find it fun because you can actually watch fight mechanics and see what people do rather than just smash face in a bosses ass and stare at a foot or at a wall.
---
WPVP = WaaaaahaboutPVP
---
The weapon's "Equip:" bonus is only calculated when it is equipped... So if a warrior had full +healing cloth set, equipped the weapon and switched to DPS gear, he'd be getting an insane amount of hp/5 AND doing insane damage cause this weapon is pretty good in raw dmg and good speed. 
---
Hopefully this weapon gets fixed to be paly prio and please, make it 2% drop chance haha
---
Yeah, do you have any idea why it's so contested?
---
Psh didn’t even finish the GIF before commenting come on bruh :p
---
Problem:  Your rolled on a PVP server, and you can't handle it.
---
Solution:  Reroll on a PVE server where you belong.
---
Aye. I do not mind people rolling Horde here, but I would love more Alliance. Once word gets out a PVP server is alliance dominated, we'll start becoming a mid-high tier to the top end ones like Faerlina.
---
Uh, have you looked at people's dps in current classic and not vanilla? 
---
A raid of like 30 pre-bis people will be able to down vael pretty easy.

instead of worring about BGs, why dont you actually hit 60?
---
&gt; Giving it to a rando 
---
How did a rando manage to earn enough DKP to buy Eye?  I am not saying it was the right call, but if that their guilds loot system, OP should leave the guild if he isn't happy with the rules.
---
This is a good build for leveling:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hE0uVcMqoZVoez0x
---
You can respec a bit at 60 to get Nature's Swiftness instead of Elemental Mastery if you would rather have an emergency quick cast. Also can remove the 36yd reach for lightning and put it into improved fire totems to do better aoe in groups.
---
No. 1 Frost Damage is equivalent to 1 Spell Damage for Frost spells.
---
Literally the only difference is that it only benefits Frost spells.
---
I’m not a fan of how absolutely horrible it’s been for alliance and I’m on a horde dominant server.  That said, we’ve all been saying phase 2 would be an absolute shit show for these reasons. 
---
Blizz is #nochanges enough to not do anything further than an early bg release for this though.  Just hope it eases with BGs, and I’ll hope not all the alliance quits before we get them.
---
Elemental Fire, Water, etc drops from them. The mat is used in some higher end recipes, and/or sells well.
---
There is good feral gear in AQ. Until then you are kinda fucked
---
Because their reasoning never made logical sense and still doesn't?
---
It's not even consistent with their own policy of 1 press = 1 action.
---
I used it just to see what all the fuss was about, and it's pretty game breaking, I hope it gets removed personally.
---
I do however really like the easy to view list of which players are around you when you get into larger skirmishes, tab targetting really sucks and the few seconds this saves you can be pretty relevant, would be nice to see something like this included as a QoL upgrade, similar to how you get raid frames in arena matches.
---
Did you go into that link? Looks to me like there is a difference.
---
Yeah, I have gotten into arguments on this sub with people who argue it doesn't give you a competitive advantage.  
---
Their argument is essentially that you can just find four other people to group up with if you don't like being one-shot by multiboxers.
---
I always notice that if I criticize the practice a lot of people come out of the woodwork to tell me how I simply don't understand how it works, or how there are ways to kill multiboxers... like yeah, no shit, but that doesn't change the fact that it's still more powerful than one character.
---
I did roll a warrior alt and got him to 26 to understand how the class works and experiencing tanking dungeons.  The problem is the endgame story for that alt; warriors require a lot of investment to gear and are great as a main but probably not as an alt.
---
I was the guy in the group who said, "lets go PVP server its so fun!" They all wanted PVE, woops
---
I can't even use the item, I don't care other than that I wish it went to someone who wasn't just a warm body in the raid and contributes to the guild. It's been a few weeks and he isn't even close to crafting it.
---
They can chase, but warlock pets despawn when too far away (can't find a source, but I main a warlock on classic and it's really not that far, probably under 100 yards)
---
Don't play a hunter in classic, but what I remember from BC, unless you're using Eye of the beast it will also despawn if it gets too far away. I think even EotB will cause a despawn if too far away.
---
If you need to jump off a cliff/ledge, chances are they'll need to find a way around and despawn before reaching you again. 
---
Pets don't have unlimited range, closer to 100 yards, but that's within rendering range so if you're talking about finding someone via spy and they're not even rendered in and you send your pet to attack, they will despawn before reaching the target.
---
lol of course you clown. they stack warriors and have a little casters as possible. they brought a boomie for spell crit. i cant believe you are trying to compare a speedrun group with normal 40 man raids. LOL.
---
You mean AQ40, lol
---
i suppose thats an issue with having a large diverse playerbase/community, i remember back in other mmos players who pk unfairly / outside of community accepted "war zones" / interfered with established duels  were policed by their own communities
---
Fire --&gt; Earth is the way to go at first because you can get it at the vendor in Gadgetzan
---
I can tell you why you should not - curse of elements and curse of shadows.
---
Aren't you mostly using your ranged weapon in endgame though?  I don't have much experience playing Hunter so I could be totally wrong.
---
That's great, however an over dependence on video  games is super unhealthy and destructive. So maybe set a real world goal or two while you're at it. gratz though.
---
how to make DBM show boss skills?

I played WoW growing up with a irl friend, he stopped back in 2010. We both have jobs now (he actually plays in the NFL, so free time is hard for him to have during the season) and he logged on for the first time in years 2 weeks ago. He and I have been playing classic since and it’s so much damn fun
---
Tauren have trouble fitting through certain doors / windows (looking at you UC elevator and MC window).
---
Wish I would have rolled troll.
---
We're talking about a 15 year old game that still has the stuck in combat bug on retail.  I'm sure no change is easy, and will have downwind effects that may or may not be expected at the time of the change.  With that said, limiting combat log data from the player isn't really an acceptable request, even if it is requested to break an addon some people don't want (and other people do).
---
In vanilla I always had my combat log open looking for enemy players, not that different. By this logic maybe we should remove combat log all together?
---
Getting raid gear takes a while and some times you can't even upgrade. Like glad chest you will literally use until late AQ when you finally get annilation chest.
---
See, I can (apparently) tolerate a lot of bad play, but loot fuckery is a very fast way to get me to leave. I'll waste time for a chance at a loot roll, but I will not efficiently funnel loot to some stranger.
---
Ha that one is literally designed to shore up a weakness of green in draft...
---
I felt like you do for a long time, I'm sorry your friends suck. I spent a lot of energy trying to find my Vanilla people, if you can't find them you can come play with me on Herod!

It's not a matter of "how much HP he actually has." The tuning has not been all over the place. The tuning is 1.12 values and the health values are consistent with that. There are logs from 1.12 that show matching health values to what we see in Molten Core.
---
His guild breaking ability was significantly diminished in 1.8 when he stopped despawning for the week after an hour. People said the same thing about Molten Core - people scoffed at the idea of clearing it in 2 hours before AQ - now even semi-casual guilds are grinding it down in 2 hours with 75% prebis.
---
Try to find a lowbie who can use the lbrs armor piercing weapons.  Otherwise I wouldn't compromise high performers in the current content
---
To be fair I am still salty we kind of did a similar thing when our raid team was pugging. Granted... I think it's a little worse since obviously mage is BiS with mageblade. But we gave our one &amp; only brutality blade drop to a PUG hunter.
---
Their policy is 5 accounts per month = $$$. And that really trumps all.

With that attitude you might aswell not play the game at all, cause small gear upgrades are what the game is at its core.

Oh no ones here hm oh wha the fuck why did 100 player just magically appear in me
---
I had a macro exactly like that for a while, but adding another GCD to disarm was getting annoying when I started using it on the enraging mobs in SM Armory, so now I don't do any weapon swaps.  It was getting annoying having to change my macros up every time I upgraded one of my weapon slots also.
---
like quite a few of us already have ... stop paying for that experience.. the devs knew what they were doing when they did it
---
That sounds so cool! Glad WoW Classic has enabled you to hang out with your friend again, and how cool is it that you know someone in the NFL!
---
Are you talking about hunters? Because dwarven handcannon isn't actually even that good (and certainly not BiS), and strikers mark is absolutely terrible for hunters.
---
I'm afraid to ask what your rotten experiences have been o_o
---
5 People wow, I can't believe you guys all stayed together it's like the cast of Friends playing WoW
---
The macro makes sense because it prevents losing a tick when refreshing. We're also missing a whole vertical bar. I am actually pretty sure that's not great damage on the Pain for a shadow priest.
---
I don't know what I said that made you think I was talking about raid logging.
---
Rando is short for Random, which the person who earned enough DKP to outbid everyone else who wanted the Eye clearly was not random.
---
Not most of the day, but from 6PM to 11PM on weeknights for sure.
---
I don't play draft very often and I mostly play Legacy, so I guess you can say my idea of a good card only includes the truly broken ones...
---
Cheers! I'll drink to that!
---
Im in the same boat. Literally only the jewelery are upgrades. Only 1 of which is prio tanks ( Dark iron ring). Basically, everything else you gotta fight for amongst other tanks and the melee dps. 
---
Is really deincentiviving the desire to raid. Ofc though everyone would be ticked at at anyone that got there gear and stopped raiding, problem with feral druids is there is so like, no loot. If youre guild runs a dkp then save it for bwl, some nice stuff there.  Currently my guild is free rolling everything but a few items and its starting to annoy me. Cant find a decent guild that uses dkp on my server though.
---
How does it work?
---
What do you mean by hear check.
---
Seriously. They're generally not too bad besides that one incident, but it was pretty bad. I'm actually surprised no one else really seemed to care. Or maybe they just didn't want to speak up.
---
wow classic is known to be more unforgiving than retail. go to a pve server or retail if you can't deal with cruel pvp.
---
Yes, dipshit.
---
Being alliance on herod is the best thing he could do, bring the numbers up. Also it's not as bad as Skeram.
---
said no one ever ahahaha
---
Can't get it on boats or elevators =/
---
What's wrong with that? A tank may take a HoJ
---
I’d like it if I could get exp from doing BGs, so I could level doing pvp rather than dungeon grind.   Maybe have a feature like /exp off so it doesn’t ruin the ability for people to make twinks
---
best comment of the year
---
Gee I dunno why don't you fucking argue with the rogues who are doing it. Just do a /who orgrimmar and tell them they're doing it wrong.
---
Ungoro, northeast tanaris, southeast dustwallow marsh, then straight north till ratchet
---
So this addon, makes a list of click to target names, kind of similar to unit frames, minus the info text, okay.
---
Then you click to target the person and send a pet to attack, okay.
---
If the game registers a target for the pet to attack at ~100 yards(now 50 yards cause that’s when the addon will go off), then what is broken?  
---
The addon that simplified the targeting(that will exist in some form) or the **game mechanic working so the pet can still attack you out of/in stealth**?
---
This is gonna sound like a no brainier but you should try to make friends and actual connections in the game, and you'll never have problems finding groups.  Servers are closed.  You play with the same population.  Work your contacts man
---
Fucking withdrawals.
---
Elemental Mastery can be used to make Chain Lightning and your next shock both free and a guaranteed crit if you shock immediately as chain lightning goes out. It may not be intentional per se, but this oddity of spell batching is what makes EM a valuable talent. I think it's because both spells resolve in under 400ms, or whatever the vanilla spell batching window is. Also, except for at a few rank oddities while leveling, you should be comboing with earth shock instead of Frost shock.
---
As for gear, the Zumrah staff from ZF is probably a better staff on the 50s. As for BGs and raiding Shaman is viable at all of it and you'll have a good time if geared appropriately
---
That is a fucking lie
---
Pretty sure he's memeing on you.
---
In another comment here one guy linked a old pvp video where the enemy player appears from about 200y distance.
---
Right now its much closer to about 50, sometimes its well under 40 and in rare cases its already in frost nova range.
---
Part of how you fight is choosing when and where to fight. Seeing your enemy from afar allows you to calculate how much time you have until that warrior arrives and interrupts your fight. If your enemy renders in the moment he can intercept it changes the whole game.
---
Sometimes you start a fight 2vs2 and suddenly its 10vs2, in vanilla that never happened
---
Well if they're ganking in a group, you're not going to really escape it no matter what class they are.
---
We are talking about being able to attack players before you can even see them, which is false.
---
Not to mention, if you're a rogue, just stealth. No add-on can spot you in stealth. It can only say "[Player] has entered stealth" with no indication as to where they are or what direction they're in.
---
So here would be the scenario:
---
 - Hunter/Warlock targets you, sends pet.
---
 - You stealth
---
 - They have to guess and spam abilities to find you because entering stealth dropped target.
---
Now with the log changes, it's within 50 yards so not only do they see you, they can easily get abilities out on you without you being able to stealth to prevent it from happening.
---
Of the currently available content, what cape, shoulders, and chest would a fury warrior use over the ones listed?
---
Top guilds, ok.  Average guild, no.  Bad players in good gear are still bad players.
---
Millennials and their safe spaces
---
I prefer to imagine this as your gfs behaviour
---
Thanks guys , I’m 2 hand fury so I’ll stack myself up to 5k HP and see where that gets me . I got a ton of grenades , aoe trinkets plus holy water so I should be fine.
---
TLDR I knew how loot was being distributed and I stayed long enough just so I could make a drama post about it
---
LOL
---
so it wouldnt be inconvenient at all to have the zepp camped?
---
Ah, sounds good. I'll likely follow that, then.
---
I aoe farmed the lashers on my mage from 55-58.  The exp is slow as fuck but you make decent gold doing it as long as you have herbalism.
---
When you have 40 people in a raid team, I think it's fair to call one of the "random" non-officer raid logging dudes a rando. If I meant pug, I woulda said pug. 
---
Anyone with 90%+ attendance can have most DKP if they aren't buying items; and that shouldn't be rewarded because it's bad for multiple reasons.
---
I have got both HoJ and SGC before i hit 60 on my warrior, i didnt know how rare that was till someone in a random group said " You must be the luckiest warrior on the server to have those before hitting 60"
---
n another comment here one guy linked a old pvp video where the enemy player appears from about 200y distance.
---
I’m not sure my GF understands why I love WoW so much, but she lets me play... as long as the chores are done and the kids are asleep ;)
---
Do it.
---
and now yps comes out
---
decursive... oh wait
---
This is the only reason to play the game. So that one day a scrub will come and whisper “you have amazing gear”  and I’ll flip them a copper and say “kid, get good”
---
Fair enough
---
It litteraly says 713 total Victorys against the boss but holy shit that is so much
---
&gt;  cadaverous chest is very competitive with glad chest 
---
I disagree whole hardheartedly for Fury and FuryProt OT Warriors :)
---
Besides, for some people the chase is the reason why they play.  Min-maxers are well aware X piece of gear may only give a 1% increase in DPS versus Y pieces.  That 1% is important to them. People have fun in all sorts of ways.
---
Day 1 of phase 3 is going to be a shitshow. Imagine trying to attune your raid for BWL along with every other guild on the server.
---
Nope, because it's 5 times the same initial input. It's the reason why keyboard macros and mouse macros are not allowed either. Same reason why mouse macros etc and autoscroll scripts are not allowed either.
---
&gt; strikers mark or the golegun while waiting for your leaf quest
---
This probably doesn't need to be said because any guild with a brain isn't going to give these weapons to hunters but please don't take these weapons that are **actually** good for melee when you could just get a dungeon weapon that's as good or better.
---
Dying 20 times between thorium point and BRD has just become a part of grinding now
---
Been using z-perl and BT4.  I wish there was a bit more customization, but it works for me ok.
---
There's also a lot more botters than multi boxers
---
We have a hunter that wants it over getting the leaf.  Oh the classic experience.
---
Combat log range has been reduced to 50 yards.
---
When I logged in and found out 😄— https://clips.twitch.tv/PlayfulSarcasticPenguinKappa
---
Honestly just put your BiS list together and on night's you aren't raiding run those dungeons switching them up each night for a little bit of variety.  You'll get enough drops/mats in a couple dungeon runs every night that you'll still make 15-20 gold a night while gearing yourself.  Unless you are farming / grinding something specific this is very easy to do especially if you have an active guild.  I ran two Strat Lives last night and it took a total of 2 hours to 2 1/2 hours probably and made 30+ gold thanks to an Orb and some drops. 
---
I feel somewhat like it's a responsibility of mine as a raider to try and spend energy outside of the raid improving my gear because the other people in the raid are helped by my ability to do more DPS (I'm a Warlock) and I think it is good to hold yourself to a high standard.
---
I actually have a max level horde and only a 45 ally. I completely agree people are free to reroll. You would have to be delusional to honestly think horde don’t squash the alliance in numbers overall.
---

---
priority has nothing to do with complexity. If no one was paid to tackle that issue, it doesn't matter how easy or how hard it is.

---
While a limited invulnerabilty potion can sometimes work, if you've gone super hard during p2 and not been hit by a fireball, you can still have too much threat when the pot ends.
---
The biggest trick is to have a smaller raid so you have a better chance of getting targetted with a fireball to drop your threat.
---
The other easy way to avoid this is to use [Gnomish Cloaking Device](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4397/gnomish-cloaking-device). This can be used in combat, and is a 100% threat wipe, so it's perfect for the beginning of p3.
---
Sounds like maybe you should've had more loot rules besides just dkp.
---
I agree with you, a lot of people have not realized how much more optimized and organized this release of WoW was, people are geared in 1/4th the time, doing multiple Ony and MC groups a week.  I'm seeing mages and rogues doing 800 dps consistent, when BWL comes out next year, the top 50% of guilds should just tear through it.  
---
It's basically like going back and doing an 60 raid with old school level 80s, you can fuck up and still kill stuff if not totally potato.
---
I think a lot of the different opinions on this come down to different understanding of what 'no changes' mean.
---
For some people (myself included) 'no changes' means keeping the game as close as possible mechanically to vanilla, even if, due to accumulated knowledge, the experience will be vastly different. 
---
For others however, 'no changes' appears to mean getting the 'feel' of the game as close as possible to vanilla, even if that means drastically altering the mechanics of the game.
---
Which server?
---
Is the player putting in five inputs or one?
---
/petpassive
---
/cast [combat]Feign Death;Freezing Trap
---
There is a bug (not sure if it's vanilla-accurate or not) where your pet will prevent a normal feign-trap from working, so you have to put it on passive.
---
I run as a tank with an MC pug that uses a soft reserve loot system.
---
For the last three weeks the item that I have soft reserved has dropped, and I was the only one to reserve it. Trying for four tomorrow.
---
I know master loot works further than group loot. I have masterlooted items from domo to the molten destroyers just before rag but the destroyers dropped a boe and it went to group loot since I was out of range to master loot it. So like if the ML is out of range it goes to group loot.
---
Big oof, friend. 
---
Had someone try this in arena/anger run. Started as just "Hey l just need golem too can we?" Which we were like, "sure, isnt much more". They then wanted us to do Coffers. Group hit that with a hard No. Thankfully they weren't upset and we continued as normal.
---
I don't believe Thundefury offers any transfers so you would need to reroll.  I think you should stick it out and hide in dungeons for now
---
This sub becoming toxic af.
---
No power? Only battery?
---
Never been. Hoping I can get involved.
---
the wording for "up to 20 spell damage and healing" is referring to how different spells have different coefficients.
---
for example, fireball is 100% while frostbolt is 81%
---
No particular boss, mostly the loot. Itemization in BWL is fantastic.
---
No, that's what I'm literally trying to tell you.
---
+1 Frost Damage adds 0.81428 damage to frost bolt.  
---
+1 Spell Damage adds 0.81428 damage to frost bolt.
---
They're literally the same.
---
If you think this is a new trick you’re about 14 years behind the curve.
---
Yep. Bought 1 hour of internet on the flight. Ony short at least
---
He deleted it!
---
I know. At least could have spell checked before hitting send...
---
Get shook
---
Lol thanks for slapping some knowledge on these noobs while I was sleeping
---
Affirmative
---
Bite, Claw, Dash Max stam and then as much armor as you can get. I usually dont bother with resistances
---
I’ve been informed that the undead children were actually dead children, actually they weren’t children at all they were gnomes. And the gift was a dagger in the back :(
---
#experiance
---
Yes. Lot of mobs and enemy players, movement speed is always a plus.
---
Yeah it takes a real genius to notice that of frozen wrath items are rare.
---
Thank you for explaining the actual meaning of how it’s worded.
---
Take it slow, 3-4 days a week. that first set of sore muscles can stop new people from going to the gym super quick.
---
DM East is the best forsure, for outside of dungeons Azshara is always my go-to. But it is overfarmed right now
---
Uhm all you need to upgrade is 8 spell power and that’s more worth going after
---
How are your parses?
---
You don’t have to click on them lol. Have you heard of tab targeting?
---
Probably should but I don't make the rules, I think it's dumb but I am not in charge.
---
I saw an elite dragon in Stranglethorn. A little north of the arena. He had green skin and was just sitting in the road. Skull to my level 41. I forget its name and I'm curious if anyone knows who it is?
---
There’s very little content at the moment. Right now it’s not about gearing up to clear content, but to compete on parses.
---
Haha cool.
---
For how long can you play with battery only? My battery lasts 30-40 mins I think. Only know this cause I sometimes forget to plug in the power cord :)
---
Look at my gear, I was the healer I was also the last to die. The only reason swp was up was because I was the healer
---
The loot doesn't affect me I just thought it was dumb.
---
What is the earth explosion clip from?
---
yes its too late. blizzard is no longer allowing new character creation.
---
Without proof you could be the typical aoe mage who doesnt let any lower to get his quest, and you even say that you will accept money for letting him play? Please go to retail
---
Even at 60, a druid is a druid.
---
Not one single person will care about you being a feral tank, you are a druid so be a good teammate and run the flag.
---
Who?
---
Wow what a story! The rag neck isn’t bis until naxx tho, twin emperors in aq40 drop a better neck (26 sp, 1 crit iirc) but that just shows how clueless that guild was. 
---
I specificly searched for a pre-established private server guild that cleared all content there to make sure the leadership is competent, my ex-pserver guild unfortunately decided to roll on the other faction for retail. 
---
Before I found my current guild, I was in another guild that advertised themselves as “high knowledge of classic” in /world chat. 
---
On my first raid with that latter guild, raid lead revealed his 200 IQ tactic for our first ragnaros: every ranged was supposed to stack under those stone hedges to negate the fall damage from the fireball knockback whilst also popping GFPPs (hell no I’m not wasting my GFPPs on this stupid tactic). Of course we wiped pretty quick to the aoe dmg and no I didn’t stack up with the idiots that did stack. Only mages were allowed to stand away from the stone hedge position since they can blink out of the knockback. 
---
I didn’t stay to raid another ID with that guild and joined a different guild in which I am now, finally promoted to core raider after 9 IDs but they know what they’re doing so that’s great. When I left my old guild (to immediately join my current one), I of course wished them good luck and all that in /g chat before leaving. Seconds later the GM or some officer (the guy who invited me to the guild) whispered me that he sees what kind of person I am, he was really salty as I had left my leveling guild for that “high knowledge of classic” guild basicly in the same manner. They also had a woman in the officer team who talked way more than she should’ve and knew much less than she pretended to know. Geez
---
A gear check refers to encounters that cannot simply be out skilled. There are some fights that even if your team plays perfectly, you will still wipe if you don't have the gear for it.
---
You realize that the mats cost like 4300 gold, including 8 Ingots that only drop from select MC bosses and depending on the server/faction, might not be readily available for purchase to begin with. Most guilds will crowdfund the first Sulfuras and it can take the entire guild weeks to craft it.
---
Man you're really mad about this. You also have no idea how a free market functions. Somebody choosing to craft one recipe on their own for free is something that can only happen in a free market. There's also benefits to doing this as a person/guild, just like in real life. It's advertising and generates good will towards you and your guild. This is not "destroying the free market". They are not turning every profession unprofitable or not worth leveling by doing one really important BiS craft for free.
---
Just as a heads up since you're failing to be witty and sarcastic despite your best efforts, the BS trinket is BiS for multiple classes for PVP. I personally am dropping Enchanting for BS before WSG hits solely for the trinket and I have a good amount of the rare/money making enchanting recipes.
---
This is not griefing anyone, if you think that crafting Lionheart for free is greifing you're an idiot.
---
True, but given that logging and client/server communication is a very standard part of any program and that there are dozens of ways that you can go about restricting access of events, there is zero basis for saying it’s completely impossible and a hell of a lot of them for saying that there are likely multiple solutions available.
---
I hate when people say “omg so easy just do X” as though a massive and complex game can just be fixed instantly, but I equally hate the “it’s impossible because I don’t see how” crowd.
---
Vael isn't a dps fight, it's a threat fight. The risk isn't the timer, it's tanks losing aggro.
---
It seems like I get about 1:30-2hr on mine lol.
---
The easiest solution: let the “carebears” have free character transfers from PvP servers to PVE servers. Then they can’t whine.
---
The only people who level warriors to 60 are streamers and guys who pay ugly girls to beat the shit out of them.
---
&gt;  playing 1 aspect of the game. That's unbelievably selfish lol.
---
because you keep using this as your bullshit reasoning, if this is what the person wants to do then its the entire fucking point.... if you keep arguing in bad faith then I will keep refusing your idiotic reasoning.
---
&gt; You're essentially saying that I'm correct, and you can't really refute what I say
---
And yet more " i know you are but what am I" why cant you grasp basic logic?
---
&gt;because 1 sided queues is probably the most outlandish solution
---
because it affects you directly so like most people that cant think for themselves will always stick to your guns and refuse change thats good for the game overall, the "fuck you I got mine" attitude will kill this game when the casuals(who fucking pay)
---
&gt;ad hominem it lets both participants in the conversation know that you realize your argument is weaker
---
So a fallacy fallacy (I'm sure you'll need to look that up)......   I attack you personally because you're an idiot. Ill even try one last time to dumb it down enough for you so hopefully your 3rd grade comprehension can grasp it. 
---
If a server has 10k subs and room for 5k then 5k is in queue.
---
(did I lose you? want me to slow down more?)
---
if the server is 60/40 horde split then ideally 3/2 even split in queue
---
(still 5k not playing) as well as the 2k alliance not playing because, as shown multiple times time and effort just to do a single thing, not just BRD , anywhere in the world...
---
Now with a faction queue,still the exact same amount.... 5k in queue, with barely any more horde being added but now the server is 2.5/2.5
---
500 horde, thats it, that's ALL that's changed..... but that small amount would make the server artificially fair for EVERYONE PLAYING. and yet, you think thats selfish.... I mean I get it, you need the imbalance, you cant function in a fair fight, but this is about the game as a whole, people leaving over imbalance is not good for anyone, even the feeble minds that cant grasp basic logic.
---
Ah. Thank you!  
---
 Our guild mentioned we need to gear the tanks and isn't too worried about anyone else. Though the main raid team is alrdy pretty geared.
---
The buff is still applied, it just isn't written to the combat log. I hear the same sound when I see rogues as I did before the fix.
---
I was the last healer alive
---
Just turn off the sound in the spy addon settings
---
np, this also applies to "+20 frost damage" even though it doesn't say "up to 20 frost damage"
---
Idk why but it does.
---
Which wasn’t clear because after the initial post I was talking about the “up to” part of how it was worded and you’re not addressing that at all. I get it now, that other guy explained it in a way that made sense.
---
Ohhhh mmmm gg he just guy ry yd St Hey GVC s
---
Spam sunder? What is this 2006?
---
Welcome to vanilla. Where 99% of the servers had insane faction imbalances.
---
lol gotta top muh dps charts in a 15 year old imba game
---
BRM and areas surrounding are camped by horde, I havent been to EPL or Winterspring since the update so can't answer that... My friend was able to farm yetis for their fur for about 20 minutes before he was steamrolled yesterday though.
---
it's irritating to me that there's always someone like that speculating that maybe it's just too hard for blizzard to do, maybe it costs too much money or resources to fix, blizzard knows their code not you so they know best, etc., basically making blizzard's excuses for them. 
---
blizzard has more than enough resources to figure out, fix, and change any code they want in their game.
---
that’s wack
---
DING DING DING!! And we have a winner!!
---
It's 100% a business decision. It's cost-benefit - which also implies that it's probably not a "litteral 30 sec solution".
---
Tanks: how helpful is Atlas for navigating lvl 60 dungeons? I've out leveled my Vanilla progress and am running most of the lvl60 5 mans for the first (or now 2nd) time in my life on my warrior, and want to make sure I semi know where I'm going when I run with people outside my guild.
---
Thoughts?
---
Lol, I discovered it one day when 2 of our dps got locked out of the abom gauntlet area. We decided we didn't want to die for them and would just 3-man the rest. Did fine until Baron, skeles healed him and we died when I went oom.
---
The light sees all.
---
Shadowlands expansion came early to classic...
---
Essence of water is 20-235g on my server. That's be ez money.
---
You're so fucking dumb it is truly incredible that we have to live without sub humans like yourself. It's scary to think that you will reproduce and spread more of your mental retardation across this world. They really should have IQ test before you are allowed to reproduce, they really should just cut off your balls, because you aren't a man and you aren't very smart either, and you'r a jackass above off. A stupid fucking jackass to add to it. You literally said nothing useful that we don't already know, you're a complete and otter jackass, probably have zero friends and rage on Reddit to let out your shitty feeling of life. You get upset someone attacks on the one game you play because you don't have any friends to play wow with so you get offended every time someone mentions they only want to play wow with friends. 
---
You're too stupid to realize that P3 and P4 will greatly change the situation of game, once max rank is reached and most people have the PVP gear there will be no incentive to spawn camp flight paths because you get nothing from it. But you're 10IQ brain is too small to see it. Have fun playing WoW while some jackass who is a a bigger dickhead than you impregnates your girlfriend while you're busy bitching on Reddit to go see her. Also, don't forget to go fuck yourself again if you even know how to fuck, don't worry someone will come and fuck you over again, that's a fact.
---
So not 27.  Got it.
---
Dm east solo jump runs with mining will probably be the best gold per hour, but I find it to be a very involved process to solo the last boss unlike mara which you can watch YouTube videos or something while kiting princess. Mara with herb for ghost mushrooms probably the next best thing.
---
yikes.
---
http://classicrealminfo.com/Chart/Sulfuras
---
it looks like about 25k more horde characters on the server since census was last updated.
---
Kanye West?
---
Now that's a good mage, starts drinking a soon as he's out of combat.
---
Fuck multi boxers
---
Vael doesn't hit very hard. You don't need to go mitigation for Vael lol
---
omg rofl, you totally pwned him lololol
---
just play on a med-pop server then?
---
That is only true if the mt is top threat when she throws her first fireball, which is not a guarantee
---
I'll be running BWL till I get Nelths Tear
---
I just think it would have been cool to reward someone who actually helps the guild out.
---
7 SP is a lot for one item.
---
Printing a line of text is not hard.
---
The multitude of conditions that lead to printing that line of text (or in this case, not) is what is complex and difficult.
---
You have no idea what their code looks like, so stop oversimplifying things.
---
Not defending Blizzard because shit, their service is even worse than Valve's CSGO team, but do you really want TiDI in WoW?
---
That's more than 30 runs per day
---
That's less than 1 hour per run if your running 24/7
---
Yep doesn't account for knockback threat reduction either. Not very useful for Ony.
---
Qas just about to slam your post without reading the headline. Haha good hob
---
&gt;but 5 lockouts per account just doesn't make any sense
---
what dungeon can any group run 5 times in an hour?
---
.......... There's nowhere else to get 8 spell power for some people....... Learn to read.
---
Brd and lbrs are gonna look like ass on 2d mapping.  Just prepare to get lost a couple times.   
---
The rest of the instance maps are quite good
---
I use it because you're at a massive disadvantage if you don't. I'd be happy if it were completely broken.
---
Can you get exalted in one week?
---
I’ve used BT and Zperl for long time and couldn’t be happier with them.
---
Nice, 11 more weeks to go my man
---
I hate people who think that they can get pulled through the raids by other players. You don't have to have everything pre-bis, but if everybody thinks like you then good luck with the submerge phase on ragnaros.
---
What is the regeneration rate for hunter pet focus? How long between ticks, and how much per tick?
---
First BRD run on my rogue. War already had HoJ and was the only one who would have needed it anyway. HoJ drops.
---
On non raid nights, I grab my tablet and sit down next to her on the couch and fly to feralas and fish up my daily dose of raw nightfin snapper. She watches some crap but I'm present and can hold a conversation. It's the little thongs.
---
People will still be doing MC when they're raiding naxx. Gotta get those thunderfuries somehow.
---
I think we are going to use a modified Suicide Kings. I'll just save my rolls for Band of Accuria and piss off the pure dps classes.
---
I'm seeing a fair amount of Chinese (probably) in runs.  Some have been okay, but most haven't.  They're not responsive to chat - no surprise - and many just aren't good players at all.  Had a horrible run with one being the tank recently, completely used up all my patience for the foreseeable future.
---
You only really need full pre-bis and enchants, slap on the libram enchants on your pre-bis/t2 leg and head too for a good impression (I see hardly anyone do this) and you should be good enough for any guild.
---
No way.
---
It’s not uncommon to see 110 outlets on planes.
---
Is he being left to craft it by himself? Do you know what is required to make this item? Did you expect him to have it made the next day or something? Its a PvP item and for off-spec that costs an insane amount of gold and mats. If the person you wanted to have it got it...would it be crafted by now? I doubt it.
---
I'm afraid I don't like the totems playstyle. However I love the chain lightning skill more then anything tho. Gotta try it out.
---
STUNNING AND BRAVE
---
I agree it totally depends on the stuff. But if you want to go for the 8/8 T2, with the free pyro... :D
---
“pVp HaPENeD oN a PVp sErVeR”
---
Since all the servers have their own forums, let the rest of the server know who he is and how much he sucks.
---
It doesn’t matter that the item doesn’t physically affect you, you are clearly **affected** or you wouldn’t be here making the post.
---
They didn’t do anything shady, you could have left at any time. No one forced you to stay in a guild with loot rules you disagreed with.
---
7SP for one item is a decent upgrade.  People flip shit for +4 STATS to chest over +3, +9 Strength to Bracers over +7, etc.
---
Bro
---
Now, use that horde reading comprehension and realize we are A. Talking about classic, and B. Learn what effect ratios have people’s experiences. 
---
If a group has 100 people and the other has 10, if asshole rates are the same it’s still 10 times as many assholes in one group or the other. Also, those 10 assholes impact almost 100 of the group that has 10 people.
---
we also have an enh, we just position him to the left of the melee camp so if he gets the knockback only he gets hit and not the whole melee grp. You don't realy need to force him to heal just let him stand on the side.
---
&gt; or I would have accepted a small donation of gold for me to leave the area for 20 minutes
---
Oh how gracious of you!
---
Talkin about the mage that shows alive not u.
---
Would it even be worth rolling a new character at this point? I’m worried I won’t be able to find people for lower level dungeons and questing.
---
&gt; It's been a few weeks and he isn't even close to crafting it.
---
dude, you can't craft this shit yourself
---
Depends what class you are.  A hunter would rather get a tier chest piece for set bonuses.
---
You're joking but I remember when I was 14 and playing classic and I walked into Ironforge as a lvl 30 druid and saw this gnome warrior with hand of rag and ZG tiger. And I was like damn that warrior is badass.
---
I remember they had that same nuke animation added with a old moonkin video from 2006 lol, I saw it on the wow forums back in the day
---
Hey! I’m in a similar boat, lost my job because my mental health and been going through really bad depression and the such when I managed to get even just grunt in the rankings I was really happy to have made it above the bottom tier! Grats bro and awesome work with using the good feels to do something productive!
---
No you didn't.
---
I can provide proof if you really want it. He was level 41 and I'm 39.
---
This. Rank 1 Rejuvs if you see a purge happy shaman. They will OOM so fast you'll be able to auto attack them to death.
---
You.
---
Now do that thing again where you say something edgy and contrarian on the Internet and then nobody gives a shit.
---
I'll never understand how people can act like it's not unquestionably dumb that an addon can alert them to the existence of a player that they otherwise would not have known even existed. Particularly when it alerts stealth so blatantly, which eliminates any element of surprise to the character. IDK about the rest of you but I think playing the game using things like your eyeballs and intuition rather than hearing "merrrrrp" with a giant icon in your face is pretty cool. 
---
Saying something like "you suck if you don't like spy", is so absurdly asinine it's nearly incomprehensible.
---
BiS is BiS
---
I'm already 60 and have a bunch of Lawbringer and Judgement, why would I reroll? It's just moderately inconvenient to get to instances and raids. Also, it's not like transfers are going out from Skeram for the Alliance or to anywhere but Heartseeker to try to balance the ratios there.
---
 I remember when I was 14 and playing vanilla and I walked into Ironforge as a lvl 30 druid and saw this gnome warrior with hand of rag and ZG tiger. And I was like damn that warrior is badass.
---
Lol so you wanted a level 30 pay you to let him quest even though he kept asking to group and you ignored him? Sounds like you’re the dick head
---
Strangely, leveling my shaman this time around I noticed this isn’t always true. When you **first** get windfury totem, it adds a superior amount of AP over Windfury weapon.
---
Considering most servers are horde dominated, that's actually not a bad ratio.
---
Before but still.
---
So the assumptions people are making are unreasonable. But expecting blizzard to approaching every problem, even problems not everyone agrees *are problems*, with a "money is no object, recode the engine if necessary" attitude is totally reasonable?
---
What a wild world view.
---
You know not where you wander! THERE ARE NO SHADOWS UNDER MY CATHEDRAL OF LIGHT!!! (queue maniacal offering plate laugh)
---
No it doesn't.
---
Propably depend where in the world you are/ airlines. I’m from sweden. Have never seen it on SAS flights (scandinavian airlines) or any other airline for that matter. Guess i’ll start look for them :)
---
I'm sorry to hear that. That sword is amazing if you can get it at level.
---
😂😂😂🤡
---
Got rend MH at level 55
---
&gt; For instance, cadaverous chest is very competitive with glad chest and a million times easier to get.
---
Except nobody runs scholo.  It's gotta be the least popular end game instance.  It's easier to find people who want to spam arena until they hit a reset timer than just a regular scholo group.
---
The Alliance version of this is rogues ganking Zep jumpers outside Org. Had a gnome rogue doing this for hours upon hours the first day or two. Wasn't even mad. 2nd time I went on the zep (as a resto shammy... so stand no chance solo) I prepared NS beforehand and warned my fellow riders to be rdy to turn around because I can guarantee the rogue will come for me. I am just a weak little resto shammy specced into "Bait" 
---
Ran into the rogue later in Ratchet and had an intimate emote moment before going separate ways.
---
&gt;The more players the better, the more activity the more shit will be done, and more organic events will form.
---
like camping all the flight paths
---
Dude. I’ve been duoing it as a prebis rSham with prebis Fury Warrs with 0 raid gear since the day DM released. I got all 3 of my prebis upgrades from DME in jump runs.
---
I strongly prefer Fury Warriors. Running it with prot is excruciatingly slow. Honestly, that’s true for all 5 mans, gimme a 2H or DW warrior in plate over a prot warr any day.
---
Do a UBRS run and do the father flame event, lots of dragonkin spawn. you should be able to complete that quest in one run
---
Ive used both. My recommendation would be ElvUI. Very similar to TukUI. You can also find code to import other players set ups. Saves you time too.
---
&gt;sounds like a dumbass 14 year old.
---
That is offensive to dumbass 14 year olds everywhere :)
---
True but it's usually the case. I use pummelers on pull and get a huge threat lead on everyone so they can dps in p1.
---
Some people have fun doing things differently than you would. Here you are telling someone they should gank people on a 60 rather than a twink while your last post is about how you aren't 60 cause you keep getting caught up in pvp.
---
You could say the same thing for literally hundreds of different add-ons. It's about making it more easily accessible.
---
This too (:
---
its 3k last time I did it without tails
---
Aint worth it, I followed Zygors and leveled about three times as slow as i usually do
---
Could be decent if you've never played an MMO before, but other than that I think you're better off just doing ur own thing
---
Enjoy your climb to fame my friend.
---
Thats good! You got any loot from the kill?
---
commenting for later
---
Didnt know there was pvp and pve server at first . So when i realize it i rerolled im a pvp server. Now my main is in a pvp server lvl 48 atm and chained to zf just like u . Also i would like to play the game more time but irl keeps me pretty busy .with only 2 or 3 hours per day at least i have weekend full
---
Being able to cancel an auction with a bid on it is stupid. If there's no bid on it, sure.
---
I was asked to tank a rend run where the tank dc'd. They only had rend event to do. The carapace dropped and I got it.
---
my guild is deep into raiding
---
DEEP
---
# DEEP
---
Now I want it too. 2g?
---
Yeah we hadn't seen priest T2 at all, finally got mine lol
---
it's not a bug unless you consider spell batching to be a bug. it's not just elemental mastery, it's also grounding totem that takes  2 spells
---
Don't have it, but I also don't PvP. No worries. If it was a requirement for it, I'd go play something else, or level a PvE character.
---
Yeh, recount sync'd through a hidden chat channel.
---
2 days
---
Fastest way for a server to die right now is faction balance and it’s not looking good for 99% of the NA pvp servers right now
---
There is a trinket, I forget the name of it that has a low % chance that on auto attack you will freeze the opponent in a freezing trap. Maybe it was called Freezing Band. This little trick is insane at freezing rogues, Enh, and feral druids due to constant auto attacks. If you are able to freeze them, you can make some distance, either heal up or Cast your burst and most likely kill them.
---
Correct but spellpower isn't very important for pvp. Stam&gt;Int&gt;Crit&gt;Spellpower
---
But did you spam it?
---
That screen shake effect 🤮
---
Did you even read what I said? I’m talking about content being released in 2 years lol. Even the “average” players are easily doubling up on their dps compared to 15 years ago, people have evolved to a point where guilds shouldn’t struggle if they are putting in any effort up until aq40 where the game becomes less trivial.
---
Yeah, and then you would have the manpower to fight back or camp their flightpaths.
---
Congrats man...good for you...if it makes you happy thats all that matters. Just make sure not to lose sight  of rl things...but hell yeah on being first thats awesome!
---
Same, he has like 5 abilities at that level, I'm sure he has a spare keyboard for pot.
---
I prefer undercity XD
---
What class are you playing?
---
As a hunter if you go in with the mindset of not wasting any time you can easily hit 60 in less than 5 days /played
---
I report every single person  on the other faction who uses these macros, funny because blizz will actually look into it and punish them.
---
Thanks for this.
---
50g. I offered 60 the a guy and he said he didn't want to rip me off.
---
God i really wanna see a pvp movie of a bunch of moonkins one shotting people with a combo moonfire
---
The point is they shouldn't have an advantage over people that had been on that server already.  I had to scratch for resources on my higher pop server from the out numbered alliance side.  Now being in people that had low pop, easy farming for nodes, herbs... every resource they could bring with them. Sell for huge gains and be on easy street.  Not fair to people currently on the server that had been fighting for those resources.
---
I just got a kitten a few weeks ago and love him very much! He’s a great gamer cat and loving companion. I’m starting to feel a bit better about doing things outside after going to the gym a few times
---
And you know what they say about that? 😉😉😁 Well he better be packin because that's one goody looking guy! - Jeff Foxworthy
---
Its available in logs but not easily accessed/read without and addon
---
Details is probably the best addon out right now
---
This man. Just let your game time run out or unsub. If you want to play still, then reroll pve.  Blizz  isn't addressing faction imbalance, so why keep giving them money? BGs won't do shit and world pvp will still exist. The only difference will be that alliance will stop wpvp and just stay in cities to que while Horde will get shitty ques and bitch/cry for faction transfers while camping every fp, farm spot, and boat possible still while they wait for BGs to pop.
---
I doubt it could be taken through portals either so no cross continent, it would act the same way as trying to drag it into an instance.
---
More organic events? Like your AH being shit because there's X people looking for X resources divided amongst that large of a server. Go home, you're drunk
---
Why are you acting like blizzard is rushing out the phases? They more than anybody would like the milk the phases and see another 5 years of classic but it’s the vocal minority flipping out on Reddit and causing them to take action and rush out phases.
---
I do not love how the trinket dispels different things for different classes in classic.
---
yes, people are always making alts
---
is that planet explosion from command and conquer 3: tiberium wars???
---
Well considering I never played past bc I could log on and screenshot my exalted?
---
Or are you saying time?
---
Because you literally have no way of saying how long a game took on each server considering guild pops and server pops. And then when cross realm came out you had the 2 hr games with patch 1.11 that promoted the zero strats.  
---
Also considering the honor you get from being in the game *could* significantly bigger than winning
---
Ram hides, killing guards, players, armor scraps,  Crystal's, etc. 
---
End of game you got rewards for controlled/killed that were about 12 each and would only total to 300-500 if you won excluding the 389 for killing the general.
---
Yes, it only takes a week numbskull lol
---
This is what I've seen on my server as well (benediction)
---
I'm trying to say that the HK miscount may have done this but none of us, even blizzard, knows for sure.
---
Its funny how people think an alive server like u describe is the place to be.. sad actually
---
Hunters are underrepresented what do you mean? Most guilds will at the very most take 4 maybe 5 if you are crazy hunters. But 2-3 is more likely. But obviously the droprate is the same as any class. Warlocks is about equally represented and druids well they get showered in tier.
---
A couple variables at play here. You gave up 14 spellpower for 1.25% crit (due to the bonus int). If you're having mana issues the spirit and int may possess more value in delaying evocation which is a dps loss while casting. If you're evocating when you could have been frostbolting, int and spirit have slightly more value than you'd think.
---
They have already made an announcement about the honor display issue, you have the honor it's just not updating properly
---
What's the problem exactly?
---
Blizzard broke the census function some time ago (I don't know when, didn't pay attention to it) so these estimates are somewhat inaccurate. By how much, nobody but Blizzard knows.
---
&gt;There's no way there's 80k players on that server
---
It was counting characters by spamming /who list, so people have been counted multiple. These stats are just estimates.
---
&gt;they take away any ability to play the game and that's where I think efforts should be concentrated
---
I disagree, thats when you should use the social aspect and call in your faction to help in either guild chat or world chat, and unless you are playing at the middle of the night getting backup shouldn't be too difficult.
---
Its only a problem if you are on awfully imbalanced server where people just don't want to do wpvp, or play at all.
---
Definitely making strides toward going out at least once a day (sounds lame I know). Thank you for the kindness
---
It will be exactly like it was before the honor patch.  WPVP will technically exist but nobody will bother to do it.  Not just that but attitudes will change.  Right now if I call out enemy activity in chat people show up in a few minutes ready to kill.  After BGs people will go back to ignoring you, telling you to mind your own business, and saying "go to BG if you want to pvp."
---
So brave
---
I just cheapshot and if it resists I vanish and peace out. Better than dying? 🤷‍♀️
---
First ever raid in MC, guild was running just domo and rag (picked up from their run earlier in the week) and I won eye with a 100 roll as a 59 priest.
---
I'm working on transitioning some of my frost damage stuff to spell damage, but that's mostly for pvp
---
HKs don’t deliver a set amount of honor for example in shared kills the person who delivers the killing blow will receive a greater percentage of the honor. Additionally subsequent kills on a given target award progressively less honor. There is a certain quality over quantity factor at play.
---
Haha I’ll do better in the future I promise!
---
If a priest can't throw out cleanses because he's "too focused on healing" he has no business being a priest.  No idea why people want to roll a vital support class if they don't want to learn any of the mechanics involved.
---
I'm sticking to dw fury and I've been offered the eye and I'm sure as shit taking it for pvp.
---
&gt;Too bad you didn't get to steal.
---
I almost took you seriously.
---
I was a gnome rogue in vanilla so I had to again!
---
Basically only for PvP. You have a ton of burst, but it's consistent compared to other burst casters like destro warlocks or pom Pyro mages. Instant shocks, low cast times on lightning bolt/chain lightning, and high base crit + guaranteed EM crit. If you want something to die, you can make it die.
---
Wish I could play it to 60 but I'm alliance this time around...
---
It takes less than a week to hit exalted with AV. The quests give a HUGE chunk of experience.
---
This is a thing all over reddit. It blocks voting for a specific amount of time on high traffic posts. The point is to prevent the early voting numbers from influencing how people feel about a particular post.
---
U telling metemlorary upgrades are not always worth it?! Holy shit call CNN
---
PVE, he said it on his post. Its probably harder to find people that are flagged.
---
Honor has a very crude colleration with HK's man.
---
Man, ill get down voted big time, but in the nicest way possible my dude, you need to get some help. Seriously. It's not pathetic, congrats on your achievement -- put that energy into turning your life around. Depression and suicidal thoughts won't be cured by being rank 1 in pvp on WoW.
---
You are absolutely wrong. And one of the reasons people didn't PvP as much before the honor system was because of massive layer exploitation. On the servers I played where pvping anyways even if they didn't get honor for it. People asked for safe layers 24/7 tho.
---
and just because BGs are in the game doesn't stop people from pvping at all, even the premade squads literally go out in the world to world pvp while in queue to be more efficient. And horde will have longer queue times.
---
World pvp is a part of vanilla, and it will always remain unless you go on a PvE server.
---
iirc you can change realm and then at the bottom of the realm list there are tabs for each region.
---
Yeah the hardest thing will propably be keeping aggro off your fury warriors.
---
I think there are just so many people doing raid content these days no one really cares too much if you're geared to the teeth.  It seems extremely commonplace in classic compared to vanilla.
---
This is the saddest thing i read allday
---
You mean like dynamic respawning which is already in place on classic servers anyways?
---
Doesn't prove that you weren't the problem here though does it? For all we know he was asking to group and you ignored him and then said "u mad bro." Plus asking for gold to stop taking all the mobs for yourself for a while... pretty shitty of you.
---
so many eyes lol
---
Based on this reddit. I am lucky because i leveled through hillsbrad on my alt on phase 2 launch and only died 4 times.
---
just don't use it
---
I thought it did but I've never quite sure because it has such laggy updates.
---
Lead threat in p2 so you get fireballed and have threat reset. Stop DPS at 41-42% and stop dots at 45%
---
The stone sells for like 6g a stack on my server. Elemental Earth value will rise, might be worth holding.
---
I'll admit, my view on what is decent is likely skewed. 
---
It's very hard for me to comprehend that there's a lot of guilds out there that aren't killing Rag pre-submerge, even though I know they exist (and honestly, those guilds are totally fine). I just have a hard time viewing that because my guild isn't particularly tryhard, at least in my eyes, but I suppose we are probably more cohesive than some.
---
We'll see once BWL is actually out. I just think the limited attempts being removed + Vael being a pretty quick fight to restart won't be as bad as it was
---
Are you saying he isn't getting help, but if another got it they would receive help? That item will never be crafted. Regardless of who has it, the materials and gold required is a full guild effort. You express distaste for an individual who has now been tasked with an impossible solo mission.
---
That is insane. I though mages had it easy compared to warriors and their SGM/HoJ/Dal's Rend farm. But you proved me otherwise! Congratz!
---
If you keep the bear after doing "taming the beast" does he hang onto "Ice Claw" forever? I dismissed mine and now Im thinking about leveling 1-10 again just for the unique pet skill
---
You mean Rexxar’s Roughneck’s!
---
Like 1 black lotus an hour per zone they spawn in
---
Drinking a pot then drinking another during the fight raid-wide is absolutely the best way to do it early on
---
The rings are like the two best feral tanking rings in the game so considering you don't even have them yet idk why you would be so bummed out already..
---
Also raiding in vanilla is about progressing your guild, not about gearing up yourself personally. Most guilds don't stop running MC until Naxx is released, lots of people will be done needing MC loot before then but they will continue to show up to MC raids because other people still need the loot.
---
Not only are they not required, they could very well wipe the raid. They arent paying for a chance to pull their own weight. They are paying for the carry and guaranteed loot.
---

Congrats man! :D
---
Or you can put a holy priest in melee/ranged groups and just spam holy nova.  We did that back in vanilla:)
---
I asked my friend what it was, he delivered: [https://youtu.be/DXSCT1Oj2Tw](https://youtu.be/DXSCT1Oj2Tw)
---
Oh this is awesome, now I get to share! I've been pretty lucky twice.  
---
I haven't really played Vanilla until... well now. BUT in my very first Onyxia run, I got the Head, and I got my very first purple item.  
---
Second time was a couple of days ago. Sash Of Mercy dropped in MC, and every healer rolled (ofc). However, I beat them with a 86.
---
What resource are you using to see your place (248th) on your server?
---
Are you on Herod any chance? If I don't already know you I should (I've got a 19 rogue setup too)
---
I'm in agreement with him. You still look like a jackass
---
I think you are the stupid one for staying with this scrub healer/group as long as you did. 
---
Time is money friend.
---
3/10 on spelling and using actual sentences with punctuation.
---
5/10 on your opinion...  what exactly would a Level 48 player do besides level when they get ganked every 30 yards?  Very interested in your answer.
---
Yeah well unfortunately that general message has gone over the heads of many people and tons of players overly stress about getting every single piece.
---
What’s the add on he’s usin that gives the disenchant info below the item??
---
Back in vanilla there was a display issue where if you were online when the honour rollover occurred it did weird things with the numbers displayed. However, the rank bar would be accurate on a relog.  
---
I don't know if people are experiencing similar this time around or if it's a sparkling new display bug combined with tye old bug making things worse.  
---
It'll likely be sorted, so try not worry too much and just keep going.

Is there anything shamans don’t counter besides mages? Just seems like shaman is all around strong against everything. Haven’t ever played one but that’s my impression.
---
Open to new information though!
---
You are a little bit confused? Sure thing, buddy. Let me clear some things out for ya.
---
When you login as Alliance at 4:30AM to deliver a quest in Burning Steppes, there are 5 horde fully epic geared 60s waiting for you on the FP with the flight master killed. When they kill you 4,5 times and you stop giving honor you can go and deliver the quest. At about 4:50AM, I saw about 4-5 other fully epic geared 60s who took turns on me.
---
30 minutes later, I delivered my quest and was able to finally hearthstone out. I went to deliver another quest in Tanaris and guess what, in 5:30AM there were 4, fully epic geared 60s camping the boat. I missed the 1st one and got killed 5 times in total trying to get there.
---
I am unable to play the game literally more than half of the day because of faction imbalance and you have the nerve to complain there’s no world PvP? Wanna know why there’s no WPvP, buddy? It’s because you disgusting subhumans are more than 60% of the population of every server and make the game unplayable.
---
You subhumans are such a large portion of the game’s playerbase, that Blizzard unironically is giving you a whole month to ruin every Alliance player’s entire game. I am level 57 and haven’t been able to lightup the flypath to Felwood, Winterspring and EPL because you subhumans have about 3-4 fully geared 60s waiting on every entrance 24/7.
---
There is no WPvP because you are 70%+ of the server and Alliance players are not allowed to play the game. Blizzard is not giving us a way out to only appease you disgusting subhumans so you continue to pay and have your fun.
---
They could, like the model changers, just say using it is a bannable offense and then figure out a way to enforce it.
---
I got HoJ after 3 runs, rolled a 61 and the other rogue rolled a 60. He was salty
---
Don't see a single example of proof in this thread
---
What is this different version of the game you alliance keep showing printscreens of?
---
That was the point
---
lucifron eu, german realm :)
---
Grats. I got a Frozen Wrath after 70 runs. It was my first Drakestone. As a Warlock its useless so I was going to continue farming until AV came out. I still keep it in my bags though
---
Just got a First Mate Hat in STV a little while ago. I was gonna send it to an alt but apparently it's super rare, so...here's hoping for a decent payout.
---
Addons are all open source, you can read the code and see clearly how things are done. Of course it's not as easy as snapping your fingers, but it's definitely doable. You don't need both of the addons to work the same way, you just need to make sure the addon is sending you data (by spoofing it) and decode that data into a form you can use.
---
I've seen addon devs coordinate plenty of times before. Libhealcomm is an example, Ace is another one. There have been plenty of addon libs created to make writing addons simpler and more organized.
---
You're right, wpvp won't die, it will just get 99% crippled.  Huge difference.
---
Any suggestion for me starting a char on a pvp server just starting p2?
---
besides transfer, I enjoy heavy pvp battles but what should be the best for leveling?
---
Damn you seem to be a great guy!
---
\*Now I never get ganked by rogues\*  
---
This addon potentially removes the threat of rogues completely. This is why its terrible for the game.
---
Holy nova is worse than the party heal whatever it's called, and with pots you don't take pushback. But yeah that works too.
---
Awesome, thanks bro.
---
He never asked for a group and I never actually offered to let him pay me to leave the area, that was just a cheeky comment on reddit I made. Prior to this he typed a big wall of text in /s about me stealing his mobs and I just replied with "die mad about it." He literally just stood around where I was farming and typed big walls of text while there were solo mobs he could have easily tagged.
---
And why can't that just be scaled relative to the population like it is being done already anyways?
---
It takes a guild to craft it, the same guild that you joined knowing the loot rules.   This is why I love loot council guilds.   DKP Just leads to raiders going to farm status raids and skipping progression raids.    It’s the choice of the player which guild to join.   All this does not change the fact people come on Reddit and contribute to the drama or whine about the choices they made.    I personally would not take the hammer due to the crafting costs and the feeling of being indebted to all the people that you need help from.   I have the same fun playing with a green, blue,purple or an orange one.     Attitude is a small thing that makes the biggest difference.
---
It's just disgusting fighting at the border of zones with massive lags while crossing over them and people not getting flagged for PvP for some people.
---
It also comes down to people on reddit are usually the vocal minority.
---
If BGs were out right now i bet there would be way less crying about spy
---
Unfortunately its not possible to get #2 with the knowledge from #1. Blizzard would have had to remake all new items but even that is would just have been a temporary thing.
---
The closest we can get to vanilla is #1. Too many BiS charts and 'optimal specs' and 'lul you didnt pick the minmax race' these days.
---
I hope you don’t get downvoted. I’ve been going to a psychiatrist and seeing a therapist but I agree I do need more help. Thankfully I’ve got a great support system in my family, friends, and (since launch) my guild.
---
Have you ever thought it possible that Blizzard actually has the metrics and has determined (for example) that there are 1.8 million Horde players and only 900,000 Alliance players?
---
In your example if the numbers were skewed to a 2:1 ratio you could make a bunch of 45/55 (A/H) ratio servers but then you basically would end up with 700,000 Horde players (based on my example numbers) that would be leftover paying on servers with themselves and no Alliance.
---
I'd also like to see Blizz actually release reports/data on the breakdown of Level 60s across all servers.
---
Give me some of the drugs u haf
---
Time to create a post! I love reading these
---
I refer you to rule 1 of this sub.
---
For the future if you attack baron and kite him out of his room he resets and the gate opens.
---
I thought they were gryphons
---
Yea usually 40-50g...sometimes u can get lucky n get a lil cheaper... Especially if you have any guildies doing runs
---
I think this should be on a twitch sub, not wow
---
but running ST 1000 times is?
---
AV feeds you rep like a mad man regardless of winning or losing. If you premade it too it was a steam roll. You have no clue what you're talking about.
---
But zygors is True vanilla exp.  No changes
---
5 instances an hour seems fair, even if it’s account wide. I don’t think it effects many so it’s hardly “forcing” anyone to get another account.
---
I rerolled on a PVE server (rather than play my 52 on the PVP server). I'm going to try again once BGs come out, but it's impossible to level right now.
---
Hah! Mallory
---
It's not though, it was abused in phasing, and that just means one person can camp spawn nodes in one area instead of being forced to check multiple zones
---
They've thought this of everything in Classic
---
Idk about the guy above me.. But both my 60s after my first 60 i used zygor and they were 60 in around 6 days playd .. Was 9.5 with out it
---
Well, feel free to remind me how wrong you are in a month or whenever BGs are out.
---
YOULL NEVER TAKE KAIRI'S HEART
---
Why should the guild help when he doesn't bother trying? The officers didn't want to break their rules(which were poorly planned) probably a good thing not breaking loot rules, but doesn't mean people need to help the guy who just shows up to raids and doesn't contribute.

Damn, so the situation is basicly same, thanks for the info tho, I appreciate it.

Or maybe he likes to PvP in a PvP game, what an unhinged sociopathic criminal

Classes that are typically strong levellers: Priest, Mage, Warlock, Hunter, Druid.
---
Classes that aren't as good: Warrior, Rogue, Paladin
---
Unknown: Shaman.
---
I vote you come to Sulfuras. It is allegedly almost balanced but more Alliance is always welcome &lt;/shill&gt;
---
Yeah I'm a huge jackass because I think people who don't contribute shouldn't be rewarded with legendary items, because the guild leaders have poor management skills.
---
Thank you!! 😄
---
A shitty guild will probably have harder time with Razergore than Vael.
---
I believe they fixed the threat wipe from gnomish cloaking device.

wowclassicpopulation.com

The add on and site had some up and down time when API changes were made but workarounds were found and both are functional again now and appear to be getting some regular uploads. The coverage can be spotty depending on realm but in broad terms it can still be useful for getting an idea about things like faction balance.
---
Was on priv servers, donno how they did it. You sure it's not possible here?
---
I don’t know why you’re acting like this is so out of the question. Create a list, restricting yourself to greens and BOPs. Even the warrior discord puts out a tank setup comprised completely of quest gear.
---
Yeah but it takes just as long to wait for him to pat
---
C:P'd from a comment I made earlier:
---

---
I'm tempted to agree with [wowclassicpopulation.com](https://wowclassicpopulation.com) yes horde took over searing gorge and BRM but alliance has been able to form groups to take over and deal with the PVP without being impossible. I would not treat it as gospel but at least it let's me check every server for the last 7 days only. That Alli are able to overtake Horde, I am biased to trust the website.
---
I look at bis lists that include rank 13 gear and wonder if they really understand what's involved.
---
Right? It's a complete waste of time
---
Sorry not everyone is a God like you.
---
Not if everyone could easily obtain it, it was allowed in game, used in-game mechanics, has been in the game since it's release, and didn't actually impact your skill.
---
If this was an add-on that actually controlled and allowed you to auto-cast spells at targets within a certain range, or even showed you "hey this target is 62 yards THIS way" with an arrow, yeah I could see the arguement.
---
An FPS is a 1 shot, 1 kill style game where information is king and you need fast reaction times to deal with what's being thrown at you.
---
Wow is not like this. It's a slower paced, 6.0 second cast time for some spells, crowd control effects lasting up to 10+ seconds game that can be played with a more relaxed attitude. Information isn't really what's king here. It's a higher skill ceiling and numbers can play a bigger role than individual skill (to an extent. Obviously people have outplayed 3v1s, but that's not common.) So the enemy knows you're in a building, does that mean they can 1-shot headshot you the second you come out? Are they at a distinct advantage now that they know you're nearby and can target you? 
---
The add-on doesn't improve your pvp skills at all while with an FPS, being able to know where a player is would GREATLY impact their ability to win.
---
Just look at a paladins toolkit. Have you had any wPvP battles versus a good paladin and good warrior or 2? 
---
As far as racials horde may be a bit better, but barely. Overall, I think paladins are so good that it makes up for the horde having slight better racials. 
---
If you took two 5 or 10 mans of equal skill, 1 horde 1 alliance,  and had a battle with all cooldowns, I reckon the alliance will win 2 out 3.  Obviously I can’t prove this to anyone. Paladins are that game-changing.
---
&gt;Have you ever thought it possible that Blizzard actually has the metrics and has determined (for example) that there are 1.8 million Horde players and only 900,000 Alliance players?
---
I would assume they do, but they haven't done anything about it.
---
&gt;In your example if the numbers were skewed to a 2:1 ratio you could make a bunch of 45/55 (A/H) ratio servers but then you basically would end up with 700,000 Horde players (based on my example numbers) that would be leftover paying on servers with themselves and no Alliance.
---
Yes, we know the horde is already fucked because Blizz didn't deal with this shit earlier (which they should have done and I cried about it back then.) Offering free faction transfers is an absolute must at this points as too many servers are severly damaged.
---
And I doubt they will start enforcing faction ratios on the current servers, but maybe they could do it if they were open new servers with strict rules in place that everyone was aware of.
---
&gt;I'd also like to see Blizz actually release reports/data on the breakdown of Level 60s across all servers.
---
Yep, but it doesn't like they are interested. As they don't like to report their playernumbers, and broke census addons that tried to make estimates.
---
*flips copper coin*
---
Although Spy notifies you about players in stealth. I'm using Vanas and have considered switching befause of that.
---
Good idea, time to take screens and make wallpapers!!
---
Not before cataclysm.
---
Once you've run each lv 60 dungeon like twice, and if you pay attention, you'll get the patting down pretty easily.
---
Why? Getting to 60 requires time, not brains.
---
Nobody? I most certainly was watching my combat log in vanilla.
---
"xxx's serpent sting does xxx damage to xxx"
---
You know there's a hunter around.
---
My guild still ran MC, Ony, AQ20 and ZG when we were farming aq40 and raiding naxx.
---
It's surprisingly great. I got it on the $600 deal at Walmart. It was the floor model so I was worried, just got the warranty on it though.
---
Who little wayne?
---
A) the people that have linked actual videos? Okay 
---
B) "it doesn't register" so that means it fucks up the parses then you dimwit which is absolutely a problem.
---
C) tons of people are noticing the change unless you're just blind as shit
---
Cats are great companions! Glad to hear that!
---
Sheep is definitely a fantastic CC for a class that can deliver big burst like that. I think fear is crucial for the tanky control caster niche that a SL lock fills.
---
as long as you stay out of the fatigue waters its fine, just swim north from the easternmost coastline of tanaris (or south if you're going TO there)
---
Too busy getting all them kills, i get it
---
If you are in NA; Pagle is a very active PvE server but heavily skewed towards Alliance. Has a very active AH and dungeons groups are always running 24/7. We already have a abundance of dps. If you want to get into groups fast either heal or tank!
---
Maybe this is just a bit of Stockholm syndrome speaking, but I've come to really enjoy Scholo. There's an incredible array of enemy types you encounter there, each with their own way of dealing with them. Melee need to kill skeletons, casters need to kill the dark shades, people need to kite the unstable zombies, people need to avoid the pool o' plague from the ghouls, bosses can and should be interrupted, etc. There's just so much player responsibility in this place and it feels really good when everyone knows their part.
---
lol so you think bringing a feral druid and wasting a dps spot just so they can FF, which resto can do, is gonna INCREASE raid times? LOL. great logic. feral does 1/3 of what a warrior does. it wll always be a waste of a raid spot.
---
Done brd so many times and i still get lost
---
The only professions that help in pvp are engineering and to a lesser degree blacksmithing.
---
If you want to actively farm gold mining is fine. If you want to generate gold passively go for alchemy (transmutes, up to 20g/day) and tailoring for mooncloths. About 4-5g a day.
---
Added benefit of tailoring would be that you can get robes of the void, even though it's honestly not great.
---
The day I got my mount.
---
I was being sarcastic, and fire isnt used in raids till aq40 comes out
---
Man it sucks because I agree with you, he should have politely asked you to group, and you definitely had no obligation to offer to group without him asking when it doesn't benefit you at all.
---
On the other hand, I don't like you or the way you carry yourself.
---
It is definitely conflicting.
---
Bro, do you even farm
---
WSG portal is in ashenvale. But in 1.12.1 you can queue from any major city.
---
But everyone who has played the game recently on private servers (which literally plays out exactly the same as current classic) knows that the dedicated PvP players go out to Wpvp while in queue to be more efficient. 
---
And also a lot people ( me included) just really enjoys world pvp. It might not be as extreme in terms of raid group PvP (altough they will still probably be around), but ganking is going nowhere.
---
I don't know where this delusion of "BGs will kill wpvp" comes from, but I can guarantee that they are absolutely wrong, and they are truly in for a suprise if that is their honest expectation.
---
They can't find a path to boats or elevators sadly, they'll just evade as soon as you get on
---
I think that doesn't make sense. A lot of engineering items require both the creator and the user to have the profession in order to equip/use. For those that don't, you could just buy them off the AH and make your gold in another way.
---
Would highly recommend Pagle for NA
---
LBRS too, but yeah. You see a ton of UBRS(Rend/Jed and Full), Arena/Angerforge BRD runs, Strat:UD, Strat:Live, and DM of every flavor than you do Scholo.
---
Yup, all casters are recommended to get a frost wand for this very reason too. Get him frozen as fast as you can.
---
That lock was a lot smarter than I, lemme tell ya
---
Sas have them on their long range flights. It’s between the seats and I’ve used in many times when flying to the US and Japan.
---
Good job brother! Keep it up, I believe in you. Just look at that #1 rank :)
---
You both have the same render distance tho...
---
It's 50/50 across all levels but yes you are correct 60/40 at levels 55-60. See you on the field of battle or in the quiet zone of the hinterlands happily fishing away for nightfin and winter squid &lt;3 Kukukachoo - Kromkrush Horde
---
A) Link one or point it out at least, I read through the thread and didn't see a single video
---
B) Read the blue post, parses won't be affected
---
C) I don't know what thread you are in, but outside of this comment I saw maybe 5 people out of hundreds mention the nerf
---
You think those addons are exclusively advantageous in pve?  You can't really play the game at all as a healer without one of these addons.  I am just saying that because addons are good or advantageous is not a good reason to ban/break them.
---
Its quite handy. &lt;3
---
Shaman, just tab purge groups heading into MC
---
Damn it people don't down vote questions. It's not like they said they think it should be...
---
There's clueless and then there's unwilling to listen. The former is tolerable, but the latter is what a lot of people talk about
---
You will be doing MC until the ends of time mate. More than one class has items they never replace that drop in MC.
---
The spec the other guy said is right, at high gear levels you could do DS/ruin, but siphon life really does help.
---
As to gear, start at pre-bis, but all the gear you add just makes it smoother and faster.
---
For tips, if you are under geared or just impatient, there **is** a skip for the last boss for miners...sorta. If you soulstone yourself, and make to the imps summoning, kite them and the boss (and the rest of the room) up to the ledge, then bolt to the tunnel. Get a ways in, die, and wait for everything to reset, then pop back up and mine.
---
Another tip, satyr don’t pull plants, and plants don’t pull satyr. That means you can fear plants into packs of satyr safely if need be, and just wait for them to come back. Heads up though, plants WILL pull Hydrospawn (I don’t believe Satyr do but I haven’t tried). Imps pull fucking everything, chattering little bastards.
---
Finally, don’t panic. Banish, enslave, and fear (see previous point) give you a lot more outs than you think. I’ve saved some truly dire situations by just trying to stay calm and deal with it, and even a super slow and sloppy kill takes less time than a run back.
---
Good farming!
---
My psychiatrist put me on short-term disability leave for clinical depression and I found out more recently that my firm decided to let me go
---
I'm an adult now. I dont have time to deal with an hour of corpse runs just to get to the raid. Right there with you.
---
Another one!
---
Here's the inspiration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zuH8srcwE0
---
Not it's existence but inaction which they seem to have released a hotfix for. Besides you can sue anybody for anything. I got that straight from a cop. However just cause you sue someone doesn't mean you'll win.
---
But they are adapting to what the players want or need because this is really a first for them. They could potentially lose a bunch of subscribers because they are tired of corpse hoping so they changed it up to what the community needs. Ive never seen or heard of any game devloper that did things exactly how they promised outside of some actual release dates because things change and need to be changed.
---
Implying ZG isnt a gear catch-up.
---
What a perfect explanation of both game in such a simple question.
---
But why not put Battlemasters then out in the world?  I mean, if I queue up in Ogrimmar, how am I supposed to travel to Hillsbrad for some world PVP while I wait?
---
I'd rather join queue there, then mount and and find war.  Sounds like a much better idea vs players camping in cities.
---
What was the job tho
---
They are weak as hell when focused. No way to break cc/ avoid damage besides pvp trinket.
---
Yeah you're giving Mr rogue far more credit than he deserves. Why would I offer quest mobs to someone who had such an entitled attitude in the first place?
---
Really? Okay Bro, cheers 🥂. There is always something to learn 👍
---
Exactly this! People act like this game is all about knowledge around you. 
---
While knowledge is important, how many videos do you see of someone getting jumped and they're able to outplay their opponent? This add-on does not increase your skill in PvP at all, it just increases your awareness.
---
&gt;but you know a rogue is coming!
---
And that stopped you from getting ganked by the rogue? A good rogue will be able to wait you out or move on. How do you know the rogue is even coming for YOU? He could just be nearby and questing, same as you. 
---
The advantage comes from your ability to PvP. You take someone who is amazing at PvP and get rid of spy and put someone who is mediocre at PvP and give them all the add-ons in the world. Chances are, the guy who's out dueling, practicing, and 1v1ing will win out against the guy who is able to use an add-on to target someone.
---
If they're deathballing and killing, what are you gonna do anyway? Chances are, hiding in a building/cave/behind a tree or hill wouldn't have worked anyway. Your choices are Run or Die and wait them out.
---
A lot of this hate from Spy comes from players losing at PvP. They don't want to look at themselves and say "fuck, I really sucked there, how can I improve?" they want to blame other things so they feel like they're still amazing at the game. "Oh that idiot is just using Spy to find me and kill me!"
---
nice pixel
---
IT Security Consultant
---
Yeah, actually freezing bands (even dual if you can afford it) is damn good for both ele and enhance shamans as frost shock due to its snare is a bread a butter spell (+frost spell damage).
---
I had wasn't saving up for an invulnerable mail I would drop money on a pair of those for the ulitity alone.
---
Some servers are queued
---
&gt;250 hours
---
so you started last week eh?
---
Auctioneer / Enchantrix
---
Sweet shitpost.
---
You're doing a lot of lol'ing. It's weird man. Just read instead.
---
&gt; they brought a boomie because druids are worthless with hots pushing the buff cap, but raids need faerie fire.
---
In other words it's worthless to bring a resto if their hots are pushing off better buffs. Raids still need faerie fire (and motw). Boomies and ferals contribute more than a resto that can't hot.
---
True strike on 1st drop felt pretty good
---
LOL there's plenty of places. its 8 spell power....like spend that time getting the Jed trinket or leveling an alt to buy it the BOE robes.
---
And you haven’t been able to find another job in that field?
---
it does for retail
---
Sure. Definitely worth 1136 runs at 5-10 minutes a run. You people are nuts.
---
Unless it's an expansion pack... that's why I prefer classic.
---
Thank you! Still sore but feeling motivated to go
---
Because being unable to complete quests due to mages on your faction taking all mobs is a very common occurrence. I alt a mage and make sure to pay attention that I'm not getting in anyones way because I understand the issues other mages are causing. I don't fault the rogue for assuming you're an ass and taking all mobs because it happens so often and because you proved yourself to be an ass who takes all the mobs.
---
Pretty sure we get battlemasters, but don't quote me on that. If anyone knows otherwise, please correct me.
---
57 is fine, although if you're a tank if recommend at least 58 so that the 60 bosses who drop aggro don't get orange-mob taunt resists
---
The range went down to a quarter of what it was, the area is just over 6% of what it used to be.
---
Yeah
---
\&gt; I am just saying that because addons are good or advantageous is not a good reason to ban/break them.
---
I totally agree here. 
---
I'm not saying Spy should be banned just because it's advantageous though. It fundamentally changes how pvp happens in the game, like completely. That's more than just an advantage.
---
Totally expected a rogue to get you after you stealthed.
---
&gt;If that's the methodology that was used then there's no way those results are meaningful for any analysis.
---
Because Blizzard broke it, there are some census stats that shows better lvl diversity etc. But Blizzard fucked it up, so the stats aren't updated. You can probably find some better on some other side that has done a better job at filtering out inactive players for that period.
---
&gt;My topic presumes that graveyard/flight master camping is an issue. So the question is, do you consider graveyard and flight master camping a problem for a healthy world PvP ecosystem? If you do then we should talk about ways to fix it, if you don't then there's nothing else to say.
---
I think its only an issue if you don't have the manpower to fight back as I said. I think this an aspect of the game that can be solved socially, by just calling in the team.
---
Like they could maybe give a few seconds of invulnerability  after FP where the player can't attack or be attacked, but other than that I don't really want blizz to mess with the game.
---
I've used in on tbc private servers, wotlk private servers, legion and classic, and I have never detected anyone that hadn't been rendered. I have had people in my spy list that hadn't been rendered, but that was because my guild or my party was detecting them, or eventually because I detected someone who entered and then instantly left my render range. This has happened a lot with people on flight paths, and as far as I can remember has only ever happened on classic because of the weird buff combat log thing.
---
But if you stand on melee the holy nova spam damages the boss!  One priest can reliably heal 4 melee (or ranged dps) while doing 300dps.  The only other fight I can remember like this is The Lurker Below in SSC (Burning Crusade), where a shadow priest could Vampiric Embrace heal a ranged group just dpsing from the scalding water.
---
Sounds that way. Being in stealth won't get you caught but losing/gaining any buffs while in stealth will.
---
You know you can turn that off in settings right?  It's under the onyxia settings, uncheck funny voice setting.
---
Got em
---
Had a raid of 20 alliance come into org the other night. Not sure what they were expecting.
---
Take a break? Like dam
---
Go back to retail
---
Owned tho..
---
I'm impressed by your evasion 👍 and found myself rooting for your successfull escape
---
Wow a 1v1
---
Literally every flight path is swarmed by horde on my server. You got it easy
---
What nameplates addon is that
---
Why does @mouse over not work with the blizzard raid frames though.  I know it worked on live
---
&gt;But why not put Battlemasters then out in the world?
---
They are out in the world as well, just as they were prior to 1.12.1, but they are also in the major cities.
---
So if you want to PvP in hillsbrad you can either que for AB in Arathi highlands, or you can queue in UC fly there, or you can be in a grp and have the grp leader just queue from a major city while the rest of the grp is out wpvping.
---
The "bandaid" puts it on par with what Vanilla was like. People seem to forget they've remade Classic using the Legion client (around patch 8.0.1) so all the changes made to these small things are still going to be in it.
---
As for "You weren't meant to have a fucking warning every time a stealthed rogue is near you"...Here's a good quote for ya
---
This is from Feb 2006
---
Amazing RGB build.
---
Now that you say it.. mine too. Haven't wiped on Rag yet but almost every run manage to wipe on trash once.
---
I have started on horde Mirage Raceway in EU
---
Seems decently busy, only level 20 but been fun so far
---
I have 2 lvl 60 on a pvp server but only raid logging there as cant do anything without getting ganked
---
I hope you’re a resto shammy
---
Was in a group in stv to kill the giant elite at the coast, while waiting for a guildie, when a random horde group appeared. 
---
We waved to each other and I pointed at the elite, while walking backwards to show them, they could kill it, because we had to wait anyways. Suddenly a 60 tauren hunter appeared, that apprently came there to help them out. 
---
He saw the interaction and we traded some nice emotes. After they killed the mob and all of the other horde left, the 60 stayed and waited with us. 
---
When the elite respawned, he waited for us to tag it and then killed it for us. 
---
He was a pretty chill guy and I geniunely like taurens now. 
---
Needless to say that this was before phase 2. :D
---
You posting this Reddit just made you look like a dope human man it really showed him! You know what normal people do when they deal with idiots? Move along instead of trying to be justified.
---
Awesome, thanks man, this is also very helpful.
---
Range was 100 yards before as far as I know, but that would be even better
---
That's the plan. Doing my part to not suck in the meantime lol.
---
Fortunately you can zone into BWL from inside ubrs but that makes wiping pretty awkward.
---
Thats great. Its a good feeling sitting down for a session AFTER getting a work out and shower in. Get a healthy snack and some water and you'll be prime time. I treat it as a reward for getting a work out in, then the WoW session even feels better :)
---
I’ve been clicking multiple times like a pleb
---
I run strat live speed clears with the guild. We make on average 40g-60g an hour combined with a clear time of sub 30 minutes per run.
---
No one cares
---
Holy blinding ultraviolet Batman!
---
“I wonder if it would be possible to sue blizzard for shutting down this app” is your exact words. You clearly meant win a lawsuit against them for not shutting down Spy. I’m just saying that’s a pretty ridiculous thought, which it is. You would never win that lawsuit, and the thought of even attempting one is equally ridiculous.
---
yup. we killed rag this week in 1min 41 sec. horde best on my server and missed server best by 2 sec. this is without required flasks and world buffs (although a few people got them). we still have probably have 2 months of gearing. we will have a tfury (or even 2 with some lucky) within the first week of BWL so threat will be much less of an issue.
---
in vanilla we were going for full magisters on mages and did 1/3 of the dps we do today because we understand it better. BWL is gonna be about execution rather than gear.
---
Rogues and warriors
---
I would suggest going down the enahncement tree and slow start picking up SP/Int (even if its cloth) in your 30's then go elemental at around 38 (new rank of Ligthning bolt, 4/5 points in lightning master for the cast speed duration).
---
At 40 with EleM, you will outright delete mobs for zero mana cost when you spell batch a shock with chain ligtning. I used this to essentially power level myself by pulling 3 mobs, EleM CL with a crit shock into fire nova totem.  Getting 3 free mob kills ever third minute with next to no mana spent made elemental leveling speed absurdly fast.
---
I was leveling in the Barrens and bit off a little more than I could chew with a thunder lizard 3 lvls higher than me. An alliance warrior (much higher level than I was) rushed in and saved my ass. I bowed, he waved and went on his way.
---
Ok, so it sounds like we agree then because that exactly what I'm suggesting:
---
20 seconds of invulnerability upon landing at a FP or graveyard ressing, dispelled upon entering combat.
---
You are winning at life! Keep it up!!
---
I just made the switch. Honestly. Very little difference. PVP still happens in the world. You still have the big TM vs SS battles. The biggest difference is there's no corpse camping or ganking. To me, that never made the world feel more alive so I don't miss it. 
---
It just feels like there's a feeling of a type of "truce" in place, although loosely held as some skirmishes do break out on occasion.
---
understandable. have a nice day
---
Proud of you, buddy.
---
They are listed for like 5-9g on Sulfuras.
---
Yeah, it's easy mode. Try playing on hard mode for a real manly challenge
---
Won the pumpkin bag roll on Halloween.
---
then post that answer to the person who started the thread. that's what he's asking :P
---
Don’t think it’s confirmed but ya in old wow you had to go to the actual bg to que. the battle masters just told you what games were currently in progress.
---
Didn't the Titans put bigass obelisks at the entrances to Un'Goro exactly to prevent this sort of crap from happening?
---
Hope not.  So much better when you have to pvp at the locations.
---
Our DPS is so good that we onlyhave casters want in P1, then they cant build enough threat in P2 and when she drops, right back to the tank she goes.
---
yes it does
---
Is this a screenshot for ants?
---
With current gear you can clear Naxx.
---
Definitely agree, but I'm not sure they are going that route. You will still need to visit the locations for the faction specific rewards, though.
---
Can't act like you tried to offer to group with no proof, if you showed that you were attempting then I wouldn't care, but you listed "you mad bro" as proof and it's not convincing
---
It might have been a green dragon kited from the Swamp of Sorrows. I think that'd be the closest one to STV. My guess is that it would be 	Somnus since it was a skull to your level whereas the others wouldn't have been high enough level to do that.
---
I had a blast killing Echeyakee one time. The cat would die, an orc hunter would say something I couldn't understand, emote various things, and then come back to do it all over again it was so fun!
---
Good times.
---
whatever time it was taken, he got 38k honor from 377 kills, that's about 50honor per kill. You were gaining 25honor per kill. So clearly his kills are worth a hell lot more than yours.
---
You get hide of the wild, aurastone hammer, shard of the scale, double rejuvenating band, farm enchants for all your items, help guildies get geared out, pvp, level alts, work on alternate sets,
---
I've been on 2 guilds and both had 2-3 hunters max.
---
And it may be different for raids vs groups I will correct my original post
---
I just want to add that your role in this raid is what counts. If you are accepted as DPS in the raid but are tank in your guild and OT a boss or two, your MS is still DPS. MS&gt;OS means you have little chance of getting tank gear unless you are accepted as a tank, which is pretty rare for a MC PUG.
---
It’s not against the terms of service so your reports do nothing.
---
Hyacinth macaw after aboit 30min of pirate killing for a quest. Also got 3 crimson whelplings in the bank. Guess im pet lucky :D
---
I have to admit that when I heal, warlocks get the attention that i can afford to spare dependent upon how much damage the tank it taking.  Druid tanks in particular in 5 man dungeons can easily oom me on a tough pull (5ish mobs) so the lock is on his own.
---
Wish I could find the clip of Swifty as a prot warrior getting one shot by a 5 man druid multiboxer from his guild. That was hilarious!
---
Gross, a multiboxer
---
whats that planet destroying footage from? looks cool
---
 post logs or i call bullshit
---
How he gonna find a job if he’s playing wow for 18 hours a day?
---
Wow what a good use of time for an unnoticeable difference
---
Its the weekend bud... questing or running instances is going to drain the fuck out of your soul.. maybe take a nap now and wake up around 3am lmao
---
Go outside.
---
You can't keep those pets, it isn't an actual tame, just a short term buff.
---
Reddit is being spergy as fuck w you op but I get what you mean. We use DKPs too and we loot counseled hand of rag to a guy who we all (mostly) think he deserves it. He is an extremely social, helpful dude who is working his ass off to afford it. 
---
Extremely dumb by your guild not to have that conversation before
---
You uninstall that item level addon :)
---
yeah, im just raidlogging myself these days. too much horde on my server, cant really get anything done. I only need a few pieces of prebis left. but ill get better in MC soon anyway. not worth spending 50m just to get inside a dungeon
---
Such great content I love his videos so much
---
It is for this very reason I rolled on a PvE server. I have like an hour or two of time to play after work and I don't want to spend all the precious time in the Shadowlands. Missing the good old college days with 12h+ every day.. \*sigh\*
---
The soulstone hail Mary is hilarious! / I will most likely use it at the beginning if stuff gets dire. Thanks for the tips!
---
find the "print scrn" button should be added to that list
---
This is the reason raiderIO scores exist. The other 4 members of the party should not have to carry that one non-contributing player. Everyone needs to be pulling their own weight at endgame content. For non60s or just-60s, Strath UD is endgame content.
---
Unfortunately, it's been like this every day since the patch :( Used to go up 1-2 lvls a day. Have dinged once in a week, because I played at odd hours and got lucky.
---
Get the bis items outside of T1, get both 10S pieces so you're ready to go 3pc T2 when you get it, enchant all of those so you can swap them out on a dime, collect all the other good trinkets (double mindtap, second wind, burst of knowledge, etc.),
---
These don't sell for a lot but man do they sell quick.
---
You're on Fairbanks right?
---
It's plainly apparent that he is not just in it for PvP. He wants to make people miserable. I hope you are not THAT dense you cannot work that out from what he said.
---
The downvoted are from people who’ve experienced multibox moon fire.
---
Can I heal ST at 48 (deep holy priest)?
---
got cords or a pic? the one near durotar? cause thats the one Ive been at but I got into nothing usually
---
Mega server 1 is born. Where judges unleash justice with extreme prejudice.
---
It's 10 gold a stack on my server. Not a lot but not complaining
---
If you catch raw events rather then parse the combat log they have enough data to ensure you aren't duplicating anything, which I assume is what the better addons are doing
---
And for the love of god, replace that ancient cornerstone grimoire. Grab a friend and farm Gizlocke in mara. It takes like 2 seconds.
---
Acronyms nobody uses
---
I'm new to WoW but love being on a PvE server. There's always world PvP if I want it, and I can just chill when I don't. Last night an alliance and I (horde) were obviously on the same escort quest. I helped him, then he helped me. It was really chill and ended with us dancing and waving goodbye.
---
Your client is not aware of the existence of stealthed enemies.  That’s actually why we hear “shoooomm” sound when we spot them.  Prior to the patch, you could still stealth by enemy players with showing up on spy as long as you were stealthed before you got into spy’s range.
---
Can’t believe he even said “ruins the game for me” lmfao.
---
Talk about self-centered.
---
I posted because I thought his pathetic comment was funny and people would get a kick out of it. I didn't realize so many WoW players on reddit have had their feelings hurt by a little AoE farming.
---
You've killed me before lol
---
Mate, what you’re doing wrong here is taking other people who need the same loot as you to the dungeon. You’re a warr, start the group and tank. You decide who joins, you decide what loot you get. It’s not douchy, it’s smart. I hate tanking so much but I did it because of this reason. Still don’t have chain/hoj though, I’ve never seen em drop.
---
Jesus it took me 14 days of /played to hit 60.
---
I had a fiery war axe drop while farming and the next day an underworld band dropped in ZF which I then won the roll on. Not the highest value but some crazy RNG.
---
I use stoneclaw very very often in dungeons. Putting it down immediately before your fire Nova totem and closer to mobs than your fire Nova totem makes it much more likely to not get hit. Combine that with one talent point in improved fire totems and a war stomp and you can get fire Nova off 100% of the time
---
You’ll probably struggle on the final boss, but most groups do regardless of comp.
---
What do you mean? Now you play the game.
---
Just because the current metagaming min-max philosophy makes people freak out doesn’t mean it matters. Hundreds of hours grinding for an imperceptible difference in stats? I didn’t bother with that shit in 2006 and I’m not going to bother with it now.
---
only 200k?
---
the horde overpopulation is the same on every server tbh, but the alliance on earthshaker is holding up. Its better than on golemagg.
---
Alright, 10/10.. god damn.
---
Contrary to popular belief, the game still functions properly on PVE servers. You can still do dungeons and pvp and everything, just like you can on PVP servers. 
---
The biggest difference is you can go anywhere and do anything without having to factor pvp (read: corpse running) into your schedule.
---
So the Horde that arent griefing, despite paying the same $15 a month you do, have to get less play time, because of their race? 
---
Only the Alliance would think a racist solution is the answer.
---
And remove that ugly fucking addon telling the gearscore of the items
---
seriously if it's your first time, stay away from Questie
---
Why do people always defend game studios with "but that takes dev time!" as though players have no business asking for changes that require dev time when they're paying a monthly subscription specifically because the game requires constant development..?
---
If blizzard want to ignore us to make more money that's up to them, they really don't need you defending them.
---
Thank you :)
---
Sure they do. Well, some of them do. It isn't always obvious which ones will work. Reading the text of Counterweights wouldn't lead one to think it would work, but it does. 
---
MCP is probably more controllable extra dps in general, though.
---
never do it. In 2 months your server will be dead while faerlina will still have a tippy topped off pop with maybe a 70 person queue
---
I didn't math it out personally but I've read that imp WF totem only adds some single digit DPS to a melee. The reasoning is that the bonus AP from WF is small potatoes compared to getting an additional swing and the improved totems only adds a slight amount (20%) to the ap. 
---
AP increase on rank 3 WF totem is 63. It's only added on to the WF proc, which is always a white hit, never applied elsewhere and only 20% of the time. So it's kinda like adding 12.6 ap to your melee, but less since it never applies to abilities that otherwise would use AP, like Bloodthirst.
---
Could have done another two runs while you wrote this!
---
It is definitely not tryhard to have a GS addon lmao, it's like the opposite of tryhard.
---
Allow events from enemy players within X feet then, but restrict things such as aura detection etc.
---
The advantage to splitting the logs would mean you can pick and choose what you want to have shown.
---
We are having more fun than ever and are even more interdependent. I rely on him for mage water and he knows his healer's always got his back.
---
If you already have the weapons in question, give it a try and see for yourself. No replacement for experience. That said, you’d probably be fine staying swords until you got a Perds, especially for trash clearing, as daggers are a pain in the ass on trash. On the other hand, daggers shine during AR uptime so if your guild is shotgunning bosses down fast such that AR is a significant portion of total fight time, you might see an improvement there.
---
Finally, it depends a bit on your faction. Horde generally favors swords for WF related reasons, as do humans due to their racial, whereas for non-human Alliance, the gap is quite a bit closer.
---
congrats on killing a player with a half full health pool already engaged with a mob, high skill there
---
I might wait a level or two for aggro radius, but you should be okay.
---
im playing on earthshaker, its not dead at all
---
Couldnt you queue in major cities for the battleground that was currently on its holiday weekend? Rest had to be walked out to.
---
But you didn't really answer my question. What was I playing on pre-patch? Because it was a COMPLETELY different experience than what I'm playing now. I actually enjoy the odd ganking and fights. Are you unable to see that the situation before and after the patch is completely different?
---
I'm going to deviate from all of these dudes telling you to go get help, or take a break or whatever. 
---
FUCK THAT. 
---
Grind harder my man, what you've done is not easy. And if you let up too much, some asshole is gonna come take it away from you. 
---
You are a fucking badass for getting standing 1, I imagine mostly through solo kills as well. 
---
Congratulations. Half the guys in here are scouts or privates, they aren't even on the radar. Don't let naysayers affect you too much, they just can't compete and need to rationalize it anyway their minds will allow them to. Keep doing what you've been doing to be great!
---
The rank 14 grind is 3-4 months, you have plenty of time to do shit after.
---
In 2 months the queues will be even worse because of the release of BG's
---
I do it because it keeps my fingers nimble. Also as some races you can do some really funny animation bugouts.
---
Always secure your own oxygen mask before assisting others!
---
Whitemane has plenty of small groups running around. It's been a blast. Now and again there's a giant zerg but generally 3-7ish people are what we end up finding. I'll take a 3v7 v0v it's fun still.
---
There isn’t a deeper meaning to whatever “point” you’re trying to make.  It’s simple, boxing isn’t against ToS.  Report all you want; that’s your time wasted.
---
Your gameplay experience means nothing to the boxer you’re reporting.
---
I cannot be bothered to box in games I play either, but it is what it is.
---
I just rerolled. Loving it so far. Actually get to play the game and people are far less toxic. That said I still have my mage there that I could go back to if the game ever does die.
---
You can still see diseases on the default UI
---
As always with healing, your level is less significant than the tank you are healing. If he is a little overheated or over leveled it makes the biggest impact.
---
This is spectacularly bad advice. Stick to one toon on your first playthough.
---
Damage meters are in no way necessary, neither are any other addons. If one fucks with the game, it should be fixed.
---
Not a difficult concept
---
So like a tool it depends how you use it? I mean it's not like those dangerous guns walking around killing people right?
---
Were you Horde or Alliance and what did you reroll exactly? (for science)
---
I mean broadly speaking BWL will be cleared at most 2 hrs from its release.
---
ok boomer
---
Do you have the source for that?  Only thing I can find is when Blizzard originally mapped out the phases, and they stated:
---
" We’ll launch Classic with content from original WoW through patch 1.2.x, then the second update will include content that was in original WoW 1.3 and 1.4, the third Classic update will have 1.5 and 1.6 content, and so on. "
---
If they followed their original plan with the order of patches of Vanilla, WSG and AV came out before BWL, which would have put BGs right in phase 2.  But what do I know?
---
Druuuuuuuuuuu
---
Druid boy chicken wings super spam everything every time I'm on the scene I shine like I just dinged.
---
It was this way since forever.
---
"Again"?
---
You can't pay for a server transfer in WoW classic. You can ONLY transfer if Blizzard allows you to transfer from your server and typically it's to a very underpopulated server. Like maybe 1000 people if you're lucky
---
Make a twink and get ready for bgs
---
They likely will still work, at worst they'd to be updated with a slight rework. The same limitation existed back in vanilla, the addons would just communicate on a hidden chat channel to sync up logs.
---
Even ignoring that most fights in mc and even up through to zg don't have the raid spreading out to the point where anyone is 50 yards away, at least most of the time
---
i remember being able to queue for all of em in org then running in circles on top of the bank till one of em got me in.
---
Live parse through warcraftlogs so you can pull something like [this](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/GkApTwhgB6C92yR3#type=damage-taken&amp;source=32&amp;fight=last)
---
You can just hold spacebar(or whatever you have jump key) for lava jumping
---
I am! Germs is my rogue (sorry about the blurry picture)
---
So now you have done easy mode (Horde) try playing alliance on a PVP server,
---
I thought this was me writing this post by the way, sans in game achievement.
---
I’m on  Alliance Kirtonos plebeian. Do not cite the deep magic to me witch. I was there when it was written.
---
Its parrots
---
I'm wondering if this is a limitation of macros or if there is a way to solve a problem I have with a dismount/stelath macro timing.
---
/cast !Stealth
---
When I put the two buttons on separate keybinds, and mash dismount once then stealth a few times while in the air from jumping and dismounting I can stealth MUCH closer to the target than I can when I use the macro, there seems to be a delay with the macro and half the time I can't get into stealth without starting the jump much further from the target.  Maybe a cast sequence with a few stealths at the end instead of just one? Maybe I'll try that tonight after work...
---
Causes a few arguments lol. By time my kid goes to bed time have to wake up in 7 hours for work. But id rather wow. A few nights I'll hope on and not be totally there to put the kid to bed. Plus she likes to game so she can't while I can so it's unfair lol but otherwise id be like LVL 40 after 3 months. I only started hitting end game dungeons in last 2-3 weeks. Plus the next month in busy and won't be able to raise untill Dec 20th ish beside Ony.
---
&gt; hidden chat channel
---
Ok so Spy can start using this no problem.
---
Maybe im wrong but if i remember correctly the chain starts from Varimathras in UC next to Sylvanas. You neee to kill the Courier and then the shadow priest lady.
---
Shaman (really Druids too) can beat anything except a Soul Link Warlock 1v1. 
---
Shaman should always beat a Mage as long as they play smart and don’t eat a Counterspell. One Counterspell and its over for the Shaman.
---
Blizzard catering to the majority is what created retail. This game IS and always has been a "small fragment of the population" wanting it, and a lot of people just coming along for the ride once it was announced.
---
What is the guild doing with all the boe blues? Without terrible lootluck there should be easy 50g just there and if lucky up to 500.
---
2 words: Gank Parties
---
Your premise is right but your conclusion is not. As long as you have a party spread out hunting others but at 49 yards apart, you now just invalidated the entire point of the nerf as the mod can then communicate to the entire squad.
---
All this nerf did was damage Spy for solo player use. It changes nothing for those who are the actual problem.
---
Lol will do.
---
This is like... The 8 or 9 time someone had made a guide for this useless spec.. just start healing... for the love of God...
---
I mean Hand of Justice trinket was a bitch to get but well wroth it. But yea I get your point. I personally only really am trying to get the damn MH sword of Dal rends since it's pre bis while I am waiting epic drops to happen. But its been weeks and only seen it once and lost it to a fucking huntard. But.... I still will try and get it since weapons important &amp; i need a new MH sword. And no reason to use the Dal rend offhand if you don't have the main hand. 
---
Just wish Brutality blade would drop in MC already so I could get it. Our guild been really luck with MC dagger drops but with being the only sword rogue I am getting no love with epic swords. Such bullshit.
---
Leveling weapon skill.
---
Not sure if sarcastic, but no raiderIO classic. Most of the classic community would be in uproar if there was one. They'd rather have terrible dungeon experiences instead of using raiderIO like systems. Not having a way to know how good your teammates are just benefits the worst players because they get carried through content they shouldn't be doing at their skill level.
---
Is that colorblind mode or do you have the worst calibrated monitor/camera ever?
---
Horde are terrorists.
---
Under that logic the same alliance pay 15$, and should be able to free transfer off overpopulated realms but here we are.
---
 Either keep it fair across the board, or put pressure on the horde to leave.
---
Not to be a dick but you gotta consider the loss from not being able to do arcanite transmutes which is 3-4g/day averaged out. So 13-14g profit per day.
---
I quit a month ago.  Really regret rolling ally on a pvp server.  It will only get worse as time goes on too.
---
It's just part of deja stats lmao
---
OP wants to do PVP. He stated it clearly. You came in off topic blustering about how fury is max tank threat. Who fucking cares. You're just yelling at a cloud.
---
Ahh I saw you craft this in Org. Grats mate!
---
Exactly, it's time based. It takes like 5-8min to run to chest so if it takes someone 10min t get there I'm going to charge 30g minimum for anything seeing as a run takes 15min and that = 30g. So if someone is going to take over 15min then it's worth 40-50g.
---
The problem is you have bad kids selling loot that do one an hour so they're doubling their profit because they run it so slow even selling at a low price.
---
Yeah I'm definitely more in it for fun than honor. If we can get a couple more people like the two guys I normally run around with that'd be cool too, but generally we can find smaller groups that give good fights if we run around.
---
good one!
---
As a feral druid approaching 60, I'm just wondering how many Manual Crowd Pummeler's should I bring to a raid? Should I only use them on bosses?
---
People are doing like 3-4x as much damage as they did back in vanilla. Prebis is way more than enough to kill vael.
---
Congratz!
---
It's part of deja stats, who the fuck cares if you can see item levels?
---
PROUDFEET!!
---
Thanks u/TheNeftLut haha. I’m trying to make more plans to do things outside (especially with my family so I can’t cancel which is more than just a bit of a habit admittedly). I’ll keep it up for you 🙂
---
Battlemasters have been present in the game since launch, so one would assume they are going to be active once BG's drop. Would be inline with all the other changes they've made to the game, e.g. giving us 1.12 AV.
---
Then remove that feature because it sucks and its ugly as hell
---
/r/wow: only pussies play on PvE, play on a PvP server for the real experience! 
---
Also /r/wow: y u no let rogue alt kill quest mobs t.t
---
Brag about it on reddit
---
I used zygore to level to 60. It helps but to get max benefit you need to use from start to finish. 
---
It does imo make the levelling experience boring and it avoids all the quests that are too challenging. It picks throughout the levelling guild maybe 10 elite quests that you can solo. 
---
My total time played when I hit 60 on my Druid was 7days 16 hours. By the time I hit 60 I was already 300 herb 300 alchemy. 
---
The latest update they have added a blacksmithing 1-300 guide and I think either tailoring or enchanting guide. They are updating the guide almost weekly fix bugs and adding features. It also has a built in duo / party levelling guide. It basically syncs zygor from your party members guide with your own. Sometimes you may do a quest and not hand it in for 2-3 levels due to the guide route. This mean you back pack will fill up with dozens of quest items making it very, very annoying as you constantly need to go back to a vendor and sell trash to make space. Other than that I can’t really fault it. At least try it and see what you think.
---
Arcane elixir for spellpower, maybe that health elixir, greater fire protection option of course, probably the arcane protection also but maybe optional. I always take a lot of others my guild requires but I rarely pop them and I very rarely die. You can go nuts if you really wanted to but... a lot of people here will probably tell you to get restorative pots, invulnerability pots, etc. I never found them super necessary as a Mage.
---
Major mana pots are worth having.
---
Aren't the battlemasters in game just standing there right now?
---
You only clear MC once a week. I like to go hard for those 2 hours since it’s the only time you can. I like to compare how I do against others on wowlogs, and since everyone else is using these buffs I have to as well for it to be a fair comparison. At least that’s how I justify it lol
---
It appears that you lack the vision as well. Simply understanding that looking for enemy players / trying to sneak up on them is a much better mechanic than just waiting for a warning from an addon. Maybe you should try to grow up a bit.
---
I like wow and vanilla and also classic but damn it DOES NOT deserve any titles. really?
---
Guild let me need a BIS cloak of frozen wrath in a guild ubrs run. BIS cloak of shadow wrath dropped in the same run which I won off greed rolling.
---
While selling the BIS cloak of shadow wrath off for 150g, i found some dude selling the exact same cloak for 11g and sniped it.
---
See you on the battlefield too! Thiril - Alliance
---
Can you go ahead and make these 30-40 hours long? Thanks.
---
Wait, can you roll both factions on the same server?
---
Haha you're right on both counts, but what an adventure I would have missed! 😂
---
i think he means Deadmines
---
This is not pvp for me.
---
Tried BRD earlier this week. Got there after 10-15 corpseruns. It was horrible.
---
If i had a ~lvl45 alliance as my highest I would not continue on that. I would surley reroll on a PvE realm or Horde somewhere. The sad part is the ganking probably made a portion of the alliance players leave. The BG que times is going to increase even further.
---
What are the horde rankers going to do for 1.5h while waiting for wsg to pop? Go around ganking probably.
---
That’s awesome!! Sweet sixteen 🙂 congratulations
---
Only on bosses, so if you want to minmax you need one for every 90 seconds you are in combat with a bos, you can look into your raidlogs to see that. But prolly a little less since it's not worth using one for 10 seconds left on the encounter.
---
&gt; Damage and threat management are two of the big issues with vael. IF you can't transition tanks well then the fight is fucked regardless.  
---
 Most guilds already get plenty of practice with this scenario in Ony's P3.
---
How do you have empty bag spaces?
---
You just described a macro.
---
I would suggest on bosses only. No need to min max trash. 10 bosses 3 uses per wild be 3.33 needed per raid. Maybe just use on the harder bosses haha
---
Damn didn’t realize this. Thank you!!
---
&gt;TRIGGERED
---
Check. Now what?
---
Thank you! I’ll do my best to keep crushing. Right back at you hehe
---
We have our mages stand with the tanks at the start of P3 as she just hates us even if we aren't pressing any buttons.
---
Make your own group with guildies or reserve it?
---
The restorative pots are super useful to speed up lucifron if everyone pops one.  No need for decurse/dispel for that 30 seconds means the adds die super quick before your casters get caught up just decursing.
---
Ye man, it’s only a few weeks. :)
---
You probably roll in a raid group.
---
Modern family joke
---
I never bought it. Tanked from level 16 to 60. And since I cant Mount inside a dungeon my money was better spend om Warden Staff 😅
---
Hah, you’re one a few it seems
---
I recently hit 60 on my warrior using my arms spec. Not that i m 60 im in doubt between going tank (which i'd like to do in raids, but arent geared enough for) or dps, to grind out some good gear. 
---
Which spec is the best for a warrior that recently hit 60? Is it just dw fury? Or is there some kind of fun dual spec, which lets me do both? Im trying arms now but it doesnt feel very powerful.
---
I'll let you know when it happens
---
I disliked auctioneer for this very reason. Swapped to auctionator and never looked back
---
I know, I would never make it in APES with pitiful numbers like that!
---
So I've got the 100% accurate peak data by using the WowCensus addon, and Flamelash is 36% Alliance and 64% Horde. There's almost as many Horde 60s online on a friday night as Alliance players total.
---
Bloodfang is 47% Alliance / 53% Horde and has almost as many Ally as Flamelash does, so I'm in the process of switching over now :)
---
I got two cassandra's grace in the same day from ZF farming. However it ended up cursing me as the only world epics I have got was 2 blackskull shields which I can't sell for more than 15 gold.
---
The main issue is DPS also generates stupid amounts of resources - fury warriors execute spamming are very non-trivial to hold aggro off of on Vael. DPS has to hold back a bit for a clean kill - it's primarily a threat fight.
---
Yeah bud you're not doing much to dispel the idea that you're a huge douche.
---
I don't disagree, we are geared now though to the point where everything drops pretty fast regardless. If I forgot to pop it though I don't stress it. If money for pots is an issue it wouldn't hurt my feelings to discard it entirely.
---
Most appropriate use of this ever
---
Now you can actually play the game.
---
Cheers pal, do you have any data on earthshaker?
---
Here's a handy tip. Avoid this subreddit, because my god the crying about getting ganked is insane and will only psyche you out. Just roll on pvp however you want and have fun. You're gonna get ganked, that's part of the game. Enjoy that shit.
---
Pretty sure there are programs that automate movement to get back in line with the ‘main’ character that they don’t (but should) ban.
---
For example I’ve gone against a lot of multiboxers and you can tell very easily who has them if you have a priest.  Go fear bomb them, if they are screwed and you basically disabled 4 of them they don’t hve it.
---
But some have a program that automates their movement to run back to the main guy.
---
You just want a character boost. Character boosts are trash. A big part of Classic is the work required to level and make a great character and therefor the identification with it. Having everyone have every class at 60 is boring like hell.
---
Using server balancing as an argument is not fitting, as the most people that frequently whine about faction imbalances are the people that make it worse themselves by transferring away. It's later that they realize that they transferred into another imbalance (40/60 is no reason to whine btw) and ended up on a server with exiled ninjas.
---
Boe rare items that are good for lvl 19s and good for pvp, I can't really speculate well on anything else
---
I really like the Kill on site part and that it keeps score of how many times you've killed each other.
---
15 year pvp server player.
---
Switched to a normal server a month ago due mostly to having to defend myself once every minute and it taking 2.5 hours to do 4 quests.
---
In short... its fucking amazing.  Plenty of pvp, org attcked around the clock, people regularly switch their pvp flag on when they see me with mine on.
---
BUT I can turn it tf off at any moment and in 5m without pvp I'm cleared.
---
The only people who will talk shit to you about switching are no life twitch wannabes who want someone to gank on their horde dominated "pvp" (more like pve) server where they gank you 10 to 1.
---
&gt; straight from the ground

I agree.
---
Don't let others dictate what is important in life and what is not. Doing what makes you happy should be your number one priority. Especially with your situation right now. Your reaction from the clip you posted shows perfectly how happy this makes you.
---
The ratrace can wait, enjoy yourself for a while.
---
Aww dude happy for you!Hope you get your number 1 outside wow as well you deserve it!
---
I would plan to use a full 3 charges per boss, other than the fight you will just decurse. Any leftovers save for next raid or partial depleted ones you can use for w/e.
---
&gt; Have a stack of greater fire resist pots
---
Why is everyone calling them Greater Fire Resistance Potion when they have nothing to do with resistances?
---
Legit the easiest way for Warriors to level up weapon skill without any risk.
---
Just stand where he is currently standing with a macro like so:
---
/target Deeprun Rat
---
/cast Rend
---
It actually will take you all the way to 300 with enough patience, but I usually stop around 265 because it's boring as hell.
---
Because I like battlegrounds and I probably won't hit 60 by the time it comes out.  Nice comment asshole.  I bet people really like you in groups.
---
That's stupid.  Go play retail if you want stupid things.
---

I did 404 runs for the Drakestone of Shadow Wrath and i just gave up today because i already wasted too much time and AV is around the corner so i'll wait for it now. I w
---
Of course youd prefer to get kicked at the instance if you know youre getting kicked. Because it would mean the group invests time to wait for you and would be less likely waste time by kicking you making it an incentive to keep you. That to me is a lose lose. What would be better is you just get ignored after whisper and never get invited in the first place. Plenty of people lined up to fill the spot unless youre a tank and it saves everyone time. I feel like people are against this because they want to play how they want without judgement. By all means but also should make it easier to weed these people out. And by these people i mean completely unviable and useless builds
---
I recently learned you can type /loot and get a recap of all the loot rolls that happened recently.
---
These are honestly my favorite. On Earthfury I've found the horde (I'm alliance) more likely to not bother me (when I was below 48 that is) and couldn't frequently just wave at someone and get a wave or salute back while questing.
---
There was one time in STV a Max Hunter spotted me while I'm in stealth. I thought I was gonna get deleted so I just destealthed and licked him. The hunter then pointed at it's pet. I then hugged his pet. The hunter bowed and just ran off.
---
Other favorites include (and it's always orcs) who are about to delete me (especially when I was in the 30s) letting me live because I either grovelled, or danced for them. The dancing gnome may very well be the most powerful defensive in the game, rivaled only by naked dancing NE female.
---
This..they are rushing like crazy putting classic on turbo mode
---
&gt; What are some of your nice cross-faction stories?
---
Mine all end with either "and then I killed them", or "and then they killed me".  Just like all wholesome PVP stories.
---
I'm not sure how this is even possible. I can play off and on for about 15 hours a day (little bit of work) and my problem is that nobody is fucking on. You can get as much honor in 2 hours peak time as during the full work hour day. So basically fuck this system
---
I was a feral cat in vanilla. I freaking loved BGs. Flag running WSG, cap prevention in AB, and general stealth shenanigans in AV. So much fun.
---
Plus, flying bear in AB would really mess with the guys trying to cap.
---
It's funny how people that break up in tears about "imbalance" when dying once entering Blackrock think it'd fix anything if they make the faction imbalance worse by one and end up on a dead server with ninjas and whiners that is just as "imbalanced".
---
I like the new mobs they added to DM:North to keep hunters in combat. I’ve afk leveled all my weapon skills to 300 on them. Thanks blizzard.
---
For the same reason there's no Classic armory.
---
lots of woosh in this thread
---
I had 4 bank alts on my WPVP server main just to hold all the shit I collected as I leveled for when I switched profs to enchanting/tailoring when I hit cap.
---
Try searching the forums before posting new topics.   The answer is that it helps with lag on massive PVP battles.
---
Really? I thought you are not supposed to understand their language.
---
You can take the boat without being on the boat FYI
---
Been wondering why this is missing, since it makes it so much easier to keep track on your progress and other peoples progress.
---
Do you have a source on that because everything I found said their original plan was the order things are now, and even then people were posting about wanting BGs earlier so at least they're listening now.
---
I got it at my first run
---
From here on if I were you I would just try to run Scarlett Monestary constantly until you hit 42 or 43 and then jump into ZF. All spell cleave/AoE groups need priests so the optimal path would be getting into those groups. The sheer efficiency of enemies killed should equate into you gathering a lot of vendor items and most importantly, experience. I got to stress that point again. Dont stop leveling to farm gold. There are plenty of other posts that go into detail about why this is important, just trust me, it's not worth grinding out gold at lower levels. With stronger enemies comes significantly more gold income. You want to maximize the number of appropriate level enemies killed. That's the magic formula to farming gold at pretty much any level sub 60. Other classes might have tricky or clever gold farms at sub 60, but for you, as a priest, this is the path for you.
---
Dont feel bad about having leveled tailoring. You will get use out of it. The dreamweave "set" is very good and the true faith vestments are far and above better than anything available right now and will carry you through many raids. There are items that will sell for profit but the margins are small and you dont want to pump them out in large numbers. You will saturate and thus tank the market. Some of these items include shadoweave gear, felcloth gear, rune cloth bags, and moon cloth. Theres more, but do your research on your specific server and go the slow and steady route. Tanking the market with a ton of items will see you lose gold. Good luck!
---
Oh and enchanting is not good for making money. It's the biggest money sink in the game, in terms of professions. Best to just buy the enchants you want.
---
The first letter of a sentence should be upper-case.
---
Armory never existed in vanilla, the pvp ladder website existed in vanilla, ever since the release of the pvp system.
---
Mograine is 53 H 47A around that.Really balanced server.And all the big guilds have two raids on each side
---
I guess you could say it comes down to who hesitates at that point.
---
High range instant cast vs hitting stealth.
---
Wow, you are a martyr.  I'd have just gotten Spirit of Aquementas and moved onto raids or PvP.  Alas, I'm a martyr too, for abandoning my first server and 60 Mage and rerolling to a fresh server to a Warrior... end game has been worth it :)
---
In other words: from one martyr to another, congratulations!
---
Because we're on a patch designed to make everything that's currently out in classic super easy so guilds could catch up and get on to AQ40 and Naxx.
---
I still remember when they dropped BRS down to 10 man instead of 15... I was seriously worried about going in there with so few people, the place was brutal even in good gear. Then we got in there and just laughed, it was *so* much easier than before.
---
Same deal with scholo/strath etc. I mean way back when if you did a baron run and wiped past the gate? Game over. It didn't open, start the instance again thanks.
---
I don't necessarily want to say the game was better back then or anything, but it was very different.
---
This is never what a pvp server was in vanilla. It was much more like the first part of your post
---
👦🏻

---
Not trying to be one of those people, but you burned ice block on cheap shot, which you can blink out of instead. This is every server, because it's efficient honor for the rogues, but you're only food as a mage if you're playing incorrectly.
---
The joke is it's typically a rogue or dps warrior demanding a group to carry him through Angerforge runs and giving nothing in return.
---
They reserve HoJ, good luck finding a tank who doesn't need it and will do an Angerforge run for free.
---
They demand clothie dps because they won't roll on HoJ, but the trouble is Angerforge drops nothing for spellcasters so there is nothing in it for them either.
---
So someone demanding such a group is very unlikely to find help from randos. To be carried on selfish loot runs like that requires some good friends, a loyal guild or a throng of rabid fans watching your twitch stream.
---
It's not really the ratio, it's the sheer amount of people because all of the high population servers are much larger than originally. It wasn't designed for this and we're paying the price for it now come phase 2
---
That might be the reason but doesn’t sound like a great solution for anybody but the hillsbrad Zerg.
---
Yeah i was doing that and it only works some of the time. I wonder how I am doing it wrong. maybe i am holding w down to much?
---
New player, new to WoW, states that they want to roll a warrior; one of the hardest classes to level without income support and without using a rested XP bonus.
---
My first bit of advice would be to not roll a warrior.  
---
But the OP already stated their intent to do so; I'm offering a solution that will allow them to achieve their goal while side-stepping the things about early, and late warriors that make them un-fun to level.
---
I stand corrected.
---
Damn, even the NPCs have the Spy addon!
---
I use it and I shamelessly love it.  I hate rogues with a passion so I’ll take any warning I can get. It’s wild out there y’all
---
theoretically - if you would dual wield and both your weapon where equippable in mainhand and offhand you could equip one to the mh, buff it wit hthe spell, switch it to oh and euqip the other one and buff it with the totem I believe
---
but it's 2h anyway so no
---
Another sad multibox, just play one avatar like a normal person
---
Well consider this (and I dont know how accurate these numbers are, but its what been posted here).
---
Spy with 200 yard range: can be difficult to actually find someone. 
---
Spy with 50 yard range and utilizing the same chat channels Details used to get around the nerf: automatically send player coords with data. Now it becomes a lot easier to pinpoint someone. Because you could also automate the triangulation math and get approximate positions. If the comms limit are "my raid" well now the problem of deathballs hunting people down just got worse (thanks to being able to narrow detections to a smaller area).
---
Of course, some of this could possibly be blocked by Blizzard, since we dont know what tools they have.

Had 7 drop for us yesterday in a guild run! We all got one each and two of us got two, was so lucky!

It is the reason, and I never claimed it was a great solution.

Well the reason is probably that there are very few feral tanks, so why would they buy your suboptimal one, when stoneshield cloak is usually veery cheap anyway..
---
Right I was backing you up
---
pay to boost char -&gt; pay to xfer char
---
balance remains unchanged
---
When BGs come out it will be mostly back to how it was before the honor system.
---
Ganking out in the world is a waste of time if you are seriously trying to get honor since you get so much more from BG objectives.
---
What the hell are you talking about
---
I hope they all burn in hell.
---
lol spending an hour questing for an item so you don't have to spend dozens of hours farming a marginal upgrade is not at all the same thing as skipping BRD farming so you can spend vastly more time ranking up to R10 and get your item weeks from now.
---
Enchants maybe..
---
This is the reason i'm asking. WF enchant adds like a third of the extra damage the totem does.
---
Getting laid on weds night was pretty lucky moment.

That’s really fast nice job

anybody who automatically assumes trivial functionality in software is always trivial to change is guaranteed to have never developed anything of commercial complexity
---
Bwl is harder then MC and is coming in January .But i think you wont need that high bis mainly because many rares can match epics or be better (for caster dps for example)
---
Maybe only for Chrom and Nef
---
Start with getting an enchant for your legs

Still rocking thrash blade and some other greens and  lvl 50'ish quest rewards and got 3rd on dps when we 1 shot ragnaros last week.

Fuck no

lol bennywise no sympathy for you bud
---
Okboomer
---
BWL will be cleared within 1hr of launch. its not any harder
---
Hours? It takes 15s to press the xmute button. This xmute is 15g/day for the rest of classic with zero work
---
it actually got buffed lmao
---
You're not so great at metaphors are you?
---
Even if he bought it for 1000g it pays for itself in two months
---
That's not true at all...
---
Lol a wild Karen appears!!
---
I swear I remember using fire in MC back in vanilla.
---
Mage is even better! You can get robe of the archmage and it's better for a mage than true faith vestments are for a priests. In Phase 4 you can craft the Bloodvine set which is so so good. Technically you dont need to craft it, you can buy it, but the set bonus requires 300 tailoring.
---
Mage is one of the few classes that CAN farm gold sub 60. YouTube "Mage solo farms." Theres quite a few lucrative gold farms. ZF graveyard runs being one of them. Though I think lvl 35 is still too low.
---
Every spell cleave/AoE group needs anywhere between 2-4 mages so it should be super easy to find that kind of group.
---
You should drop enchanting unless you are ready to seriously commit a ton of gold to it and become a guilds main or secondary enchanter. Those are big shoes to fill and is a long road till you see profit. Personally, I would drop it and pick up something useful like engineering or a gathering profession. Herbalism or Mining are profitable. Skinning can be good money if you are AoE farming beasts. You just vendor the leather.
---
This is so true. And it's not the day after that's the worst. It's the second day when most of the rebuilding is going on. So many people hit the gym super hard and their body is so shocked, it just powers through. I once fractured my ankle running on a treadmil for 30 minutes after not running for, like, 10 years. Didn't feel it at all the day of ( actually felt pretty good), but I could barely walk two days later.
---
The universe would implode from all the Undead Priests/Warlocks getting tilted by WotF 😂👍🏻
---
That’s great man, congrats! I’ve battled depression for most of my life and lost my job a few years ago as well. Just wanted to post this and say it gets better. I know it sounds cheesy and cliche, but it’s true. You’re not alone and I know, I’m some rando on the internet, but reach out if you ever need to. Cheers bro!
---
Is there a reason for that?
---
Assuming: you log every day, transmute every day, sell a water every day, and the prices stay stable.
---
NOBODY is actually parsing their combat log like that. And WoW pvp is certainly not a slow speed. WoW pvp comes down to managing your gcds quite often. That is not a slow paced game if you literally have to decide which spells are most important every 1.5 seconds, even if the engagements are longer.
---
Also the argument of "everyone can have it" is kinda dumb, because this whole post is about whether or not you feel bad about using it.
---
And yeah, the enemy can't 1shot you if they know you're in a building. But they can target you and possibly CC you through the wall or tree if it isn't actually LOSing (there are plenty of things that hide vision but aren't actually LOS). Or they can CC you as soon as you pop out without having to click to target as a reaction.
---
It also tells you if an enemy has used stealth nearby.
---
Honestly this comment sounds like someone who has never really pvp'd outside of a giant 40man raid.
---
One thing that might be worth trying while you wait is resetting your UI, and not using any addons at all.
---
Had a similar thing happen with my Robes of the Archmage craft, had to completely restart my client to get them to appear.
---
You on Flamelash? Saw a guy farming Tyrs hand with 5 boomkins.
---
That's crazy, a righteous orb has a 8% drop off of all the mobs near the cathedral. There's about 40-50 of them that you kill, so you should dang near always have one drop.
---
Yes but you'll notice that WoW has it's own macro language with a good number of restrictions to keep things fair. They don't look kindly on circumventing those.
---
But honestly if you're multiboxing and not doing anything super game breaking or straight up botting (so someone is always there controlling a character) they'll likely not care. Blizzard has always been a supporter of multiboxing.
---
You can eat AND drink at the same time too
---
Just because many/most people can do mc in 2 hours doesn’t mean everyone can. There are some groups that take twice that much time. And if you’re still progressing through domo/ rag and dealing with wipes, it can be MUCH longer. 
---
That’s the answer if you were actually curious. If you were just commenting this to shame people that can’t blaze through the current raid content, well then shame on you.
---
Lol dafuq does that even mean. Shake off that beta complex. I merely got played by a mage in TBC with this trick.
---
The add-on takes a huge shit on tactics. In my opinion, ruining one of the funnest aspects of PvP. Nothing better than escaping by hiding in a clever spot or using a clever spot to ambush someone assuming you're not a rogue.
---
So, by your own words, ratios don't matter at all. Horde sucks, alliance sucks, but if your ratio is off it sucks being on the losing side.
---
Nice observations, mate.
---
I'm almost certain the priest was absolutely wasted. I know people who become the same way after drinking too much and still playing WoW
---
I’m in a pretty casual guild and even we can manage to not pull aggro on ony. I don’t really think people are such meter-whores in general that most guilds will struggle. People want progress more than topping meters.
---
wow good question!
---
With everybody either being pre-bis geared or busy doing pvp i think a lot of people have reached the point where they don't care who's in the group as long as you don't have to wait another 30min for it to form.
---
Also even with rio scores runs you'll always run into that one person every now and then who's just not paying attention, or got boosted in the dungeon you're doing.
---
Honestly you will do every raid except AQ20 until the end, there are insane items in every raid.
---
Your metaphor was bad, because it is drawing comparisons between two entirely dissimilar situations. That's called a "false equivalency". 
---
All the addon does is read text that is explicitly given to you by the game developers to use and the addon presents it in an organized format.
---
It is entirely dissimilar to a wallhack. Wallhacks either replace game assets with hacked ones or hook into graphic runtime calls, in both cases modifying the game to provide functionality that didn't otherwise exist prior.
---
Your metaphor is bad, and you should feel bad.
---
Blizzard has said on many occasions that multiboxing is completely fine and you won't be banned for it. 
---
I'm sure you could go too far and do things you shouldn't be allowed to, but as a general rule it's 100% OK.
---
Sold mine for 800g on the AH. Wish I stood it personally.
---
That 40g cut was tough lol. It was more gold than I had when I got the drop.
---
Somewhere between 700-1000gold
---
Nope,  lost every roll, including the wand I needed!
---
Ugh and getting there :/
---
I've been playing for 15 years and I had idea l no idea
---
Yes :) dont vendor the item, casters. But why would they?
---
Well it's easy when you have a guild of former rank 17s and naxx on farm.
---
our fool proof method is making sure our off-tank isn't hit by a fireball in p2. Stays on threat meter as 5-6 on p1, then rest above gets hit with a fireball (splash does not work), if not they dont they take aggro and run to tank spot, ez peez.  
---
except with combatlog yard fix I imagine threatmeters being even more unreliable. We'll see how it goes next time.
---
I mean.. I'm not a multiboxer, minus having two accounts back in wrath and alt tabbing to help power level alts. Never bothered with the multi screen combined input thing.
---
But Blizzard says you can do this. They've said it since vanilla, they have never changed their stance on this. You don't need to rationalise it, because it's 100% a legitimate way to play and will not get you banned.
---
8/8 T1 is busted, the additional heals proc your 5/8 making it even better.
---
r/cringe
---
What do you mean trying when it's grade 2 level difficulty and you guys are clearing it no problem? He clearly is trying, and very successfully at that, hence him turning up to and healing enough raids that he was able to purchase the weapon he wanted using the predefined rules the guild set.
---
I did my best to make it as non-cringe as I could! Sorry
---
So not good parses then?
---
Thanks for clearing that up.
---
The vael gear check is easily doable in blues with current player “optimal/bis” mindset
---
BRUH THATS LIT  😂 
---
BRUH THATS LIT  😂
---
It's never going to be balanced because different people have different priorities when they play. Say for example if the server has 9000 horde and 5000 alliance, there could 4000 alliance players that want to do world pvp, but only 3000 horde players that want to do world pvp. There's no way to determine the ratio of who is going to be doing what type of content. From my experience on herod, alliance are way more organized in their honor farming and constantly gank in groups, but herod is predominantly horde playerbase (62% to 38%).
---
#onlyminorchanges
---
Interesting because I had people show up I couldn't target. Maybe it was just RNG
---
They won't say because it can easily be verified on wow logs that almost everyone is full clearing.
---
I killed you twice today. And prevented you from killing the two people you were trying to gank as they were afk. Gg germs.
---
In all honesty, I hope you really are happy 😁
---
Too bad you are not horde. Or you could be the Highest Warlord alive.
---
Honestly it's the "medium hardcore" ones that are the issue. Super hardcore guilds just don't put up with it, they'll kick people who can't manage aggro. Casual guilds are much more laid back.
---
The ones in the middle tend to have a few "I WILL WIN THE LITTLE BOX" players that annoy everyone.
---
Funny thing is tho that that is __not__ what people do wrong. Everyone always thought the warlocks are mongoloids. They are not. There is no global threat wipe. It was not just that easy.
---
Turns out them having aggro is the whole point of the boss‘s design. Turns out Ony is hitting those „that are wearing the dress“.
---
Stfu dweeb
---
That's a lot of runs
---
Right I always mix those up lol
---
Grats dude, I'm in the same boat... Do disregard the armchair psychologists. In all actuality they know nothing on the subject, and simply want to pontificate. Keep doing well, and stay strong!
---
Sorry, but what is Virgin Megastores for?
---
Can the alliance get the ony buff at any time? 
---
Is it the same as the horde's ony buff?
---
And can horde only get the buff every 6 hours? 
---
&gt;You're being handed information that you would not see without the 3rd party program
---
Wrong, its all there in the combat log. In game. In your fucking chat box. Freely available. 
---
The advantage is in organizing the information to be more readily viewable. Which is literally the point of addons.
---
The video made me smile. Mainly because I've /played 200 hours of Classic and yet to see a single Oomkin.
---
It is the actual reason. Private server used the same method in the past to counter in game lag.
---
I disagree. I've been making money buying mats when they're cheap and crafting bags. I make 20-30g passive income a day by logging in a few times during the day and listing bags. Not huge profits, but there are ways to make money with tailoring.
---
Do 60s go to Kalimdor only with teleport to Darnassus...?
---
Except in your example, God comes down from heaven and bans non-vegan functionality by turning everyone into herbivores. 
---
###Having everyone abuse the ever living shit out of a bug is the fastest way to get it fixed.
---
&gt; How little critical thinking do you have that "Blizzard says it's okay" is all you need to hear? 
---
I love that you start with this but ignore the part of my post where I expand. Seriously, what is your problem? Why do you care? The *vast* majority of multiboxers just use them to farm instances and otherwise play the game by themselves. They're also pretty rare.
---
So. Why so bitter? Is it because some people enjoy a game differently to you and therefore you want them banned?
---
Isn't 21 the max roll?
---
atm game as alliance is cancer
---
If he hadn’t ice blocked the first time, he would have been killed in the burst rotation
---
No. People doing that has nothing whatsoever to do with “saving mana”.
---
We can't always fall back on these arguments that "1.12 was the catch up patch" or some mess. It wasn't.
---
Most of the changes to dungeons were made long before the patch we're on. Nearly all catch-up mechanics (Dungeon Set 2, ZG and AQ20 loot, etc) aren't even available to us currently. Yes, we have the talent revamps and better itemization (a lot of which was done long before 1.12), but the content was already easy before then. We as a whole were just ignorant and/or crap players. We made things harder on ourselves due to this and perceived the content as challenging.

Example: BRS. Only nerf when player cap was reduced were some trash packs removed to make it faster (Notes don't notate Upper or Lower). The mobs werent nerfed. There were some class changes, but nothing that'd just make things insanely easier. Y'all just got better, that's it.

    def print_combat_log(message):
---
        if (message.target == player.target OR message.target == player):
---
There. I changed the function that prints in the box. Gg ez. Except now nothing prints to combat log.
---
BGs will simply reduce the amount of WPVP, it definitely won't kill it. But the time spent in the BG is time not spent in WPVP.
---
I was dumb and sold the account cuz I had a mage and a paladin fully raid geared and was trying to convince myself to quit playing for good cuz I spent too much time on it. Started from scratch again during cata to join a friend who promptly quit and I ended up playing through WoD LoL
---
Then I wasn't planning on playing classic until a friend asked me if I would to help them.... Then they never joined again and here I am lol
---
Good thing I sold that account tho since it definitely stopped me from playing anymore /s
---
When it comes to leveling, spirit equals less down time due to spirit tap. Intellect only gives you more mana and a small crit bonus, and unless your tank is trying to pull half the dungeon each pull you don’t really need that much mana to heal while leveling.
---
You are a pathetic excuse for a human being.
---
My biggest problem with that is it removes the sense of community on the server. I know the top guilds. I know the top tanks, the guy with the first Sulfuras. I have been intentional about being friendly and helpful, not abandoning the dungeon runs I tank when the DPS and Heals are subpar. Reputation matters. I have folks who aren't in my guild that I will run into on the Zeppelin or in Kargath or outside of UBRS. You lose that in retail, and youd lose that with a mega server and Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself.
---
&gt;/reset ui command is?
---
Well, theres /reload, but I was talking more about doing it by backing up your settings files, and then either renaming or deleting them.
---
This Blizzard support article gives better specifics.

Icemail Gerkin and Wall of Death(name?)
---
Haha I do the same thing with someone wearing dungeon set gear I think they are a lowbie (especially the warrior shoulders). When they are really almost 60 or at 60. Retail has screwed up my brain.
---
Nice! One step closer to 100% :)
---
Your lack of empathy is what is most sad...
---
each is on its own 6 hour timer.
---
I have no clue how but I saw one in org the other day
---
How does that even happen?
---
31-20 arms
---
A few tips. Put the loot on FFA for the torches. Even better go have a rogue solo them if you have one. If they are geared enough they can solo the dousing and the only thing you gotta do is make it across the room. 
---
Also use LoS on the pillars to pull all of the mobs to you. Don't run to them. That's how you get more packs. Use Mana potions instead of drinking. It's all about how fast you can move through the room.
---
I didn't ignore anything in your post, what the fuck are you talking about?
---
Why do you have such a problem with me caring?  It literally does not affect in any way for me to have a different opinion than you on a gameplay mechanic.  You claim I'm "bitter" based on literally nothing.
---
&gt; So. Why so bitter? Is it because some people enjoy a game differently to you and therefore you want them banned?
---
So you claim I ignored part of your post while you didn't even read the part where I said that it's pay-to-win?  But yeah, sure dude, it's because people *enjoy a game differently than I do.*  That's what I take issue with.  For sure.
---
Disagree. I used spy to AVOID being ganked. Its very helpful for avoiding players.
---
&gt;Virgin Megastores
---
International retail chain owned by Virgin Group, yes the same group people who run air travel.
---
Pyrewood Village is a great pve server honestly. PvP battles at TM. Both factions are pretty busy too.
---
the 20 spell damage one is the end of a huge quest chain, quite a bit longer than 1hour
---
I like how it’s all horde 😂
---
            print(message)
---
Wow very difficult.
---
You don't need software, people use software because it's cheaper that buying a multiplexer.
---
They are emulating a keyboard multiplexer so you can do the exact same thing in hardware, the first multi-boxers used a multiplexers back in the day
---
Not a Diablo III player huh? :D
---
Dont use greater thats for idiots,and just like that your comment became irrevelant
---
wtb 30g?
---
There is no chance in hell I would pay more than 25g for it. Hunters are running that shit anyways.
---
I've seen so many people this time around worried more about gear rather than their guild as a whole. We've began trimming the fat of everyone with the "what's in it for me" mindset.
---
Or quit the game and cause further faction imbalance.
---
Except it's anything but "suboptimal". Maybe try reading the item tooltip for once instead of following BiS guides like a checklist.
---
Oh I already sold it 50 gold v.v
---
Health stone and mana gem share cd. Bad
---
Then it was probably people on flight paths or people on the edge of your render distance and you didn't click fast enough so they were gone by the time you did.
---
Settings don't change render distance, it's fixed. Otherwise people with shit computers would be completely gimped. Imagine seeing someone in world pvp and them not being able to see you ?
---
I had a rough strat UD run too. Took about two hours, partially me, partially group.
---
But have you ever healed Baron fight with all of your gear red? Yeah. Not fun.
