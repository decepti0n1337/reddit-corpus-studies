The other day I saw an alliance player running with really low health from some mobs and I gouged him... They caught up and he died... But then I saw it happen to another alliance like 30 seconds later and saved him. Just trying to stay unpredictable and confuse the enemy
---
I doubt it's exaggerated, sounds exactly like shit that would be said where I work if this came up.
---
Took along time to respond. Sure hope you and your friend did not communicate electronically as that will all be subpoenaed. Remember conspiracy to commit crime only requires discussing it not taking any action, but giving an address is taking action so that hurdle is met. Since it is a federal offense as it was potentially electronically transmitted the FBI would be involved. My biggest hope is you actually joked about teaming up to beat my ass as you will be eligible for 3-5 years. Enjoy your night, already filed the complaint via FBI website. Hope you are untraceable. Sometimes trolling is making stupid people do stupid things and then watching the show.

Yeah but I am asking for tanking

Do you cup the balls when your deepthroating like that or nah?

Has it?

Welcome to Azeroth:)

P.S Death to the Alliance!!!
---
Okay. I'm using TUK but have been wanting to give ELVUI a shot. I'm going to do that today. Thanks!
---
Are you actually korean
---
She’s more than likely exalted with BB. If you get exalted the guards don’t touch you.
---
Personally, I treat others how I'd like to be treated. I try to make friends and help the horde because I can get my quests done easier if they are also helping me out (or at least not hunting me down). Though, I've got no problem with horde that try to kill me on sight either, it's a pvp server after all.
---
I've only managed to get to level 13 since launch because I only get an hour here and there to play. Only really had one night where I played multiple hours, so definitely not going for anything crazy. Your comment made me feel better haha
---
Which is what happened with classic, we did no raid testing as blizzard kept it secret, and we overestimated the boss damage by far. I am sure blizzard might do the same for future content for classic, as they don't need to worry about it needing to be super extreme overpowered hard.
---
I agree that there are definitely things that could worth changing, but the volatility directed towards any mentioned changes is probably a good reason why it isn't happening for classic.
---
My hope is that the proven interest leads to a spiritual successor of WoW rather than trying to fix all the problems it does have.
---
Starting from someone else's work isn't always the easiest, especially if it is outdated
---
no lol it’s a macro that translates “you’re an evil korean to horde”
---
What if TBC had restricted flying to only Netherstorm (forces anyone wanting to raid Kara and above to get it still) and Ogri'la in Blade's Edge, leaving everywhere else untouched?
---
It’s always cute when a dps gets butthurt because someone told them to manage their aggro and generally not roll their face on their keyboard. It’s ok little buddy, we can replace you with the 17 rogues and mages spamming me with tells asking for an invite.
---
Boat from menethil in the wetlands.  You want the boat on the right side dock if you are looking out from the shore.  Then when you get off that boat at auberdine, run straight across the dock to the next boat that will take you to rut'theran village I believe which is connected to Darnassus.  Run into the purply glow stuff to teleport inside to darnassus.  Ask a guard where alchemy trainer is.
---
Shitting yourself will be the least of your concerns when you're on the other side.
---
Stopped playing around the time they added Moira
---
I mean obviously the severity is different but that doesn’t justify you taking advantage of it just because it’s a small thing.
---
If you see a $3 cash tip left on the table at a restaurant and take it as yours, odds are nobody will see it or it won’t be significant enough to get police involved. Doesn’t make it right even tho you only nabbed a couple bucks vs outright robbing a bank or committing CC fraud. Sure they could put preemptive measures to make sure these things aren’t exploited, but just because they don’t doesn’t mean it’s okay to do so.
---
Lol
---
Haha, right?!
---
If getting killed in PvP ruins the experience for someone, that's exactly what PvE servers are for. The fun PvP happens with similar levels trying to keep control of quest mobs or something, I've found not too many people gank lowbies and even those are a chance to put together a group or call in guild support to hunt them down.
---
Now the 60s that run past a 10 and 1 hit them just because they're passing through, that can get a bit old but I'm finding it pretty rare.
---
Nice! There's a shout out to Brotalnia in some guy's name in chat.
---
True warriors never skip leg day.
---
Because the EV drops.
---
Why run 5 miles for $100 when you could run 10 miles for $1000?
---
Oh god I don't think anything was as boring as that. Painful.
---
Hmmmm. Maybe watch some streams videos of pve or world pvp from high level players to help decide what looks like the most fun to continue to level?
---
Wonder if this applies to Alliance camping the top of elevators in Freewind in 1k needles. They can kill most of the camp but guards dont seem to aggro unless they walk all the way into the camp.
---
38 with 60 gold

Should I just keep running SM until I have the gold?

Hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha

How do you know he just doesn’t go stealth and watch tv

Hmmm, never thought of it that way. If I ever see him I'll take him, but otherwise I'll stick to whatever I have until then

SePons for feral are purely stat sticks and this weapon has no stats. Absolutely useless for feral. You want agility and lots of it.

Not gonna lie, i was incredibly worried that the hunter in my SM Arms group was going to need on Ravager.
---
If you care that much about optimization why the fuck are you using a cat in PvE? Use a wolf lol.
---
The Smartbuff addon is helpful for remembering stuff like this.
---
I mean, as a hunter I wouldn't ever roll on ravager
---
Such a terrible waste of time lol
---
&gt;	but that comes from the fact that we’re both fighting for something, ie. who’s going to get who’s honor.
---
That sounds more like you are motivated by external rewards, not actually world pvp tho? Could be misunderstanding..  
---
I like world pvp because it adds another layer on to questing, have to watch your back at all times, sneaking away from gankers and the like.
---
Lol that's insane. I'm all for making people feel comfortable but monitoring people in chat is crazy lol
---
We formed a party as horde to kill the elite panther. We showed up and some alliance were already waiting around. We slaughtered every single one of them while waiting for spawn. They kept trying to take it back but we repeatedly killed them. I felt a little bad as it is a long spawn... but then again we are horde and we take what we want.
---
Everyone is different but I have one 45 and about 3 alts already. I like to play many classes but always have a main. Lots of people who have rushed are making an alt in down time on their main character.
---
From my personal experience, posting illustrations without watermarks makes many people repost them everywere without credits, or even worse, selling them. Still people can become a patreon a do the same, but at least ill get a little support and put some kind of "barrier".
---
If you want i can gift to you a couple, just DM me with your email and i'll sent them :D
---
thank you for liking it :D
---
Always, always do your flexing or spitting w/e when you kill your target. Rookie mistake
---
Which add-on is best at helping avoid wifey agro
---
There is always leveling alts as well.
---
Give guards guns
---
Yeah this. If you got no one, just group with someone and force your friendship!
---
It’s the memory storage in Inside Out
---
This happens to me sometimes. It's pretty random which texture gets distorted. I think it's just a classic thing as no other games, including retail, have this issue for me.
---
Why would I wanna make myself sad twice
---
Nice I’m not one to talk by the way (graveyard shift has a LOT of free time..)
---
Lol kid i'm literally a law student. None of what you said is even remotely correct. In fact, i'm proably going to send this to the AUSAs i know from school just so we can laugh at how incredibly stupid what you said is. 
---
You challenged someone to a fight online and IMMEDIATELY punked out. And you think you're gonna get the FBI to subpoena non existent records for that? 
---
Holy shit this is lterally the saddest thing i've ever seen, this is "my dad owns nintendo" levels of pathetic lying. Please please get off the internet until you graduate you mega cuck.
---
I'm playing lock and hunter in classic and any time I get aggro I do my 1 or 2 seconds of panic run before I stop. I may die for my hubris but I'm not making anyone chase me.
---
Would also like to know!
---
Try being a gnome on your mechanostrider.... Worst. Sound. Ever.
---
Skinning. Higher the leather sells well now and low level vendors well.
---
Link?
---
Then my advice is: follow what your heart tells you. Even if it brings anout struggles, at least you know you were true to yourself.
---
I'd also like to know how to mute sounds. I hate the sound of the meechanostrider mount. Makes me wish I'd rolled a human.
---
I wanted a smorgasbord of music for each zone your in while leveling. The clipping and everything. But nice anyways.
---
You stood in the fire, i cant out heal stupid.
---
No.
---
Wait, yes.
---
Or no?
---
Get every class to level 20. At which point you will be forced to advance past level 20 lol
---
Mining contributes to two professions where as skinning and herbalism contribute to 1. 
---
That was always my mentality
---
I just hit 40 and had 96 gold. I didn’t have a profession. I just vendored everything and didn’t buy spells from 30 on.
---
I mean,  when is anything on the ground good?!
---
People were also less interested in the story after lich king as well I think but the game did change a lot from the end of LK and cata.
---
Sym or Moria maybe?
---
I'm so glad I was ahead of the curve when I hit 37. Didn't have much competition and snagged BT very quickly. Maybe the best luck I will have for a long time. GL Hunters!
---
Making regular eye contact, and nodding in approval.
---
Weapon procs only work if your hitting something with the weapon. Druid in forms will never proc a weapon or its enchant.
---
Alliance confirmed. Horde can't form complete sentences.
---
I feel a Netflix special in the making
---
I think youre confusing typical horde with typical barrens, but seeing as how we spend 1/6 of all our levels in the barrens, (more or less), I understand.
---
Ew, someone kill that gnome abomination. 2g for each kill.
---
If you think the Alliance behaves any different from the Horde, try rolling a character on the other faction.
---
I did roughly 1g per run without vendoring. Vendoring always added at least around 5g and I had to vendor after 5 runs. So everything adds up to 2g/run (more if u are lucky). 
---
The best group I had made a run in 15 mins possible = 4 runs/h = 8g/h. 
---
And finally a run gave me around 10%-15% xp (iirc). = 60%/h
---
Decide for yourself. I personally think quests give more gold, if those quests are around lvl 40 (for some reason gold starts stacking pretty fast at that "breakpoint").
---
Happy looting
---
He did stop. The healer had plenty of time to drink.
---
Since I took GM tickets? Yeah. Did that for about a year before doing other things.
---
Do you prefer a 2H dildo or DW 1H’s for max DPS?
---
What’s a loose roll
---
Engineering if you are going to PvP. Black Smithing if PvE. Also, while leveling take mining and skinning. Vendor all leather unless it sells for a decent price on your server that way you have mount money.
---
Pretty sure multi-shot was banned from use back in vanilla days in any decent group...
---
Wrong.

You mean to say you hope that's what they are going to do.
---
I dont always let someone die in a dungeon, but when I do it's a warlock who won't stop fucking life tapping.
---
Or a hunter/lock in any SM dungeon who sends their pets after fleeing mobs only to return with a dozen more.
---
Fuck him.  Horde all deserve to die. My server is probably 1:5 horde favor.
---
I passed a ton of horde 3-5 levels lower and didn't kill them even though I had just completed my pally quest early and had a super OP mace and a few lucky drops.  
---
Then around level 28-30 I start getting killed by packs of horde 4 or 5 levels higher.  Like 5 of them at a time.  They all /rude and /spit , /laugh and spam kek. 
---
I've been killed by ?? Horde while fishing and minding my own business.
---
I finally caved and have no remorse for anything I do to them.
---
I was in Hillsbrad Foothills questing.  I was around 34, I passed a 28 priest.  Didn't do anything to him.  I start killing a mob and get low, then he tries to jump me.  I turned on him and killed him, pretty easy, I don't know what he was doing.  Then he comes back with a 38 warrior.  And they start trying to camp me.  Luckily I was close to SS so I just rezzed and ran for it.  Made it after a bubble out of charge.  
---
Then later that same fucking priest, he comes at me when I'm like 30% fighting 2 mobs.  I had Lay on Hands up so I work down the mobs just in time to go full health and mana pot.  He realized he fucked up at this point and tried to run .  I made him corpse walk from the AE mage farm zone all the way to Tauren Mill.  
---
They don't take a challenge, they wait until it's a free kill and strike.  They aren't good and they have no morals.  All horde is kill on site.  IDC if they are 30 levels lower, just means I have to waste less time removing them from Azeroth. 
---
Seriously, fuck them all.
---
Jokes on you no brewfest in classic
---
Yeah fine, that might work for a leveling guild. I'm asking for my guild, a group of 30 players who have played MMO's together for the better part of two decades and whom meet up yearly to hang out. We have the community down and help each other advance. It just would be exponentially easier to coordinate with a simple addon like that. 
---
Jesus christ, people need to stop thinking that addons that make peoples lives easier aren't going to kill the game. This is the same bullshit that destroyed that addon that automatically scans chat looking for people that are "LFG" or "LFM" or "LF" and populates a scrollable list from all the world/social channels so you can see a list of people running dungeons, what roles they need and how long ago they were last looking, what players are looking for what, but apparently taking data that is already in the game and parsing it into useful things is evil according to this toxic fucking community. 
---
The thing about an addon like the one I am inquiring about is, guess what, you don't have to use it! My guild would because it would save us from having to devote an hour a day updating a shared google doc.
---
as someone who hasn't done a lot of research prior, I appreciate this primer. :) ty

I'm levelling as Sword spec. [This is the build I'm going for](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/305320105-0230552120050100231), I didn't even bother with Improved Gouge because it's a costly crock of shit that not even a 1.5 second improved duration can save. If you use it in the way you described, it's actually a DPS loss because of the few seconds you're not attacking at all.
---
Here's the thing, Sword spec doesn't use Backstab at all because it's a Dagger exclusive skill, so there is literally no offensive use for this ability. The only other use I can think of for Gouge is to incapacitate a second mob that's already attacking you. Problem is, /focus macros don't exist in Classic and switching targets in any way will kill your rotation and lose any combo points that you already accumulated on your primary target.
---
For me, placing my 3rd to 5th points into Lightning Reflexes was more worthwhile. Rogues already have an innately high dodge chance, and while this will not improve the duration of Riposte, that 3% extra change to dodge could save your ass.
---
One of my fondest most vivid memories of Lord of the Rings Online was a Minstrel (the only class in the game who could res at that time) parked in the Barrow Downs (a low level zone that will knock your dick in if you're not going in without a small army at your back) offering rezzes for 15 silver. Which was an absurd amount of money for a lowbie then. This was a time when you'd see someone kneeling in defeat like every 5 minutes everywhere you quested. It was like LotRO Mount Everest I guess. Good times
---
Thery also made changes in vanilla so that specifically dots have much lower chance of breaking fear than normal attacks with same damage.
---
I no longer possessed the resource commonly known as mana. In other words healing spell generaly cost more than 0 mana and I actually had zero at the time of your death. Luckily you can release spirit run back and learn to shut the fuck up nub. Git gud.
---
Monday night, partner and myself were trying to clean up some quests in STV. At this point we were 36-37, so we're doing the last half of the Kurzen quest chain. A Dwarf Warrior joins up while who do it, then we part ways at the cave entrance with a wave.  
---
A few minutes later, he's advertising in general chat to kill Bag'thera or whatever the Nessingwary's panther quest is called. Whisper him and we join up with him, a Human Rogue, and a Human Warlock. We all gather up where the panther spawns, killing the cats around it while we wait for the spawn.
---
  
---
Chat it up a bit. Warlock asks if we would like to do Big Game Hunter after, the quest you get as the final Nessingwary's quests which is a lvl 41 quest. Three of us chime in that we'd need Tethis the raptor before we can get the quest for the white tiger. All agree that we'll kill the raptor then kill the white tiger.  
---
The black panther spawns, we kill it and start heading towards where Tethis spawns. The Dwarf Warrior mentions he's not yet on this part, but can we kill a few of these raptors for his quest one step behind on the way? He's still cool with helping us without the quests.   
---
Nope, this is now FRIENDSHIP group! We're in this TOGETHER. We kill all 10 of the raptors he needs, then go to where Tethis is to wait as the Dwarf turns in his quest.  
---
"What if any Horde come?"  
---
"We'll kill them!"  
---
A skull Tauren warrior does roll up, lurking around the trees while we wait for our Dwarven friend to make the run back. Being a hunter, I slap a frost trap down just in case. Maybe he'll leave 4 Alliance alone? Maybe he'll only go after Tethis with that Shaman he's got lurking with him?  
---
Nope! He charges me, but hits my trap and is insta frozen in place. I re-trap him, step back and we all gather up and kill his skull ass. The poor Shaman tried to help his fellow Hordie, but he died as well.  
---
Finally, our dwarf warrior is back and we're ready to kill Tethis! The Tauren warior thinks this is a good time to spawn and try to charge me again. Trapped. We slaughter him then effortlessly move onto Tethis.  
---
The raptor is killed, we turn in our heads and get the final quest. The white tiger is no problem and now we all have completed a lvl 40 something quest as a mix of lvl 35s-38s because of FRIENDSHIP!!  
---
They're all on my friend's list and I hope I bump into them again. :D
---
[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ccxosl/dives_drain_tanking_guide_for_warlock_leveling_in/) is probably the best guide for draintanking and the guy who wrote it prefered respeccinh switching to succubus at level 24.
---
 
---
I think it’s a good thing to do because at lvl 25-27 my VW couldn’t hold aggro without me holding back a lot and the dps is way lower than the succubus’.
---
You sir... You are one of the most spectacular campers I have seen in a while. 
---
Especially when beating him to death with a fishing pole. So savage, yet so artistic. 
---
Bravo!
---
I am playing actively retail since Pandaria and I love tanking dungeons but I haven't got a single whisper like this. Since I play classic, every week I get some whispers that people have added me. The game is much more social and I love it.
---
They do.  But not enough to pull off the tank if they using shouts and sunders properly.  Not to mention that healing the tank generates less aggro due to higher mitigation.  1000 damage split between three people means more overhealing, more total healing as leather and cloth mitigates less than a shield does.
---
shortcut to desolace?
---
Yes, I agree the healer could have paid attention instead of being greedy with their drink.
---
He already has at a previous blizzcon. Shit it might have been the classic announcement blizzcon.
---
&gt; Too bad Blizzard simply can not detect that stuff without breaking the law \o/
---
Doesn't it cause a GCD?
---
The healer did have time to drink.
---
Yes, it is also a shortcut to desolace
---
Still a bop
---
People meme about Hunter weps, but Enh shaman are the real ninjas. Steal everyone's gear, including ours and they're not even viable.
---
Question. How did you set your character screen to default but the rest to elvui/tukui? I couldn't figure it out.
---
Knew it, I've seen you around and always have a chuckle at your name lol.
---
This is also a path to Desolace as well
---
Anyone have rules for leaving your leveling partner behind? Like move on if they haven’t logged on in over a week without any heads up?
---
I wanted to main warrior and I linked up with a healing partner on launch day. Partner has a family so I knew it would be gradual leveling, which is why I mained a different class. But this person hasn’t logged on in almost a week!
---
"an enchant that wont break the bank... "

---
0.o
---
Life tapping is fine. As a priest I’d want to to tap at least over half their HP since it more mana efficient to use the big heals in one go. (Renew is now a little mana inefficient sometimes)
---
But do Warlocks have drain life and can use it effectively in Classic? I only saw one use it so far.
---
The appropriate response is, "how many girls have you kissed?"
---
I think they should have just added everything before the BC prepatch. Just let people try it all. Cause that way, even if Naxx got cleared in two weeks, those guilds would still be doing MC, BWL, AQ, ZG, ect
---
You can get a lot more than 1-2 regen ticks in 21 seconds.
---
Would “I’m not sober” be a valid reason? XD
---
Sure it might be finite but it takes an average of 10 in game days to get to 60 then you get your gear and I have no idea how long that will take. I also make alts and take just adds on a ever growing amount of stuff to do.
---
You don’t know what an asshole is. I’m sorry, but check the mirror.  
---
To elaborate - maybe anyone who is feeling entitled to raid spots when they are not an OG guildie or whatever criteria is required to reserve a raid spot is an asshole, but they’re more likely just ignorant. Remember, most people on this game don’t use reddit, don’t use guides frequently, and are playing for fun. But these same people might still very plausibly make it to the end and look to raid. This is exactly how I was the first time around in Vanilla. I just didn’t have enough time to play more than an hour six days of the week, nor the wherewithal to consider optimization of my class, gear, leveling process... I was still learning the game.  
---
But considering someone to be an asshole because they chose a suboptimal spec purposefully is... the opinion of an asshole. What is optimal or not in raids should not at all be a necessary consideration when choosing class or spec.  
---
Considering someone an asshole for joining a guild with a full raid team looking to raid while knowingly playing a suboptimal class or spec is... again, an asshole opinion. Again, your sense their entitlement most likely comes from a place of ignorance - and choosing a raiding team doesn’t always mandate the selection of the most optimal group; in fact, raid leaders will often try to get as many sixties as they can involved post-clear, in order to grow the guild.  
---
Finally - you say that you’re not being an asshole, and just considering reality and using common sense. While this is the most valid point you make when it sometimes comes to excluding the bottom classes/specs, look at your comment above - ‘it’s even better when...’. You clearly find it funny that these players think they’ll have a chance to raid when they might not. That’s being an asshole.
---
Its like 200g to get mats for that, requires 300 enchanter and the formula is a .01% drop chance off level 57 mobs in WPL. How is that something that wont break the bank? lol
---
WeakAuras. You have to set it up inside of the add on yourself but it is pretty easy.
---
This changes as people get good gear since your pet damage doesn't really increase while their survivability increases a lot.
---
You monster
---
I healed SM as a Disc Priest, when I finished I immediately respecced to shadow. Fucking Dbag retail players play like we have infinite mana then complain when they die.
---
Blizz is just battin' a thousand here
---
LOL
---
Which is why I said “if you can afford it” ????
---
We had a tank using it in SSC.
---
This guys obviously a Chad, deff not a Virgin Enchanter
---
Letter to tanks: make some hotkeys to mark things. Plenty of people will take direction, but most tanks don't bother marking stuff. The DPS aren't psychic and it will result in split damage every time.
---
He’s a warlock, he can do Mara runs so I assume if he’s serious about his warrior he could get it

Damn skippy!!!

I find the whole vid hilarious, but I played a ton of Paragon.  For the John Cena bit, go to 4:00 and just watch.
---
I only half agree. To an extent, yes, be aware of the Healer’s mana. But you also gotta take into account the healer’s skill and gear which is a much bigger unknown. Some healers will be fine with 20% mana, others will struggle with 80%. Watch the Healer’s mana but keep an open line of dialogue open, because dungeoning is a team game and it’s not one person’s sole responsibility to watch any given thing.
---
Almost like flying and 310 movepseed matters :) so correct though!
---
Just take the upvote.
---
So much cringe when that nerd asked, "How many times have you downed C'thub?" as some means of asserting his authority in the debate.
---
2H stabby weapons for those huge crits
---
I'm sure I can take some time out of leveling to check this out....
---
Join a group of friends/guild and ask them what they would be in need of. Healers and Tanks are always a necessity that majority of groups are lacking. Both roles are difficult if you have little experience in but that’s the magic of classic, you are forced to learn.
---
Probably want to grind BiS gear with the boys. They are missing their one of their boys.
---
Man, you were slightly credible up to this point.
---
&gt; What did you drop?
---
The mic.
---
Met the dopest tank ever on Stalagg today in BRD, “AMG” is the man
---
This is pretty much it in 5 mans. The DPS are normally either great or absolute idiots. Pay attention to the healer and the mobs around you and if you aren't busy, worry about the DPS. The game is pretty much the tank and healer vs the mobs and DPS.
---
&gt; Any rough estimate of how the pve dps of this build compares to the usual combat swords + assassination spec?
---
Likely 10-15% less dps compared to standard combat swords. You can also go full combat maces and be 98% as good as combat swords but not quite as good in pvp.
---
He has the fastest attack speed, 1.0. The faster attacks result in more casting delay when the cat is on casters in pvp. But the next fastest cat is 1.2 and is all over hillsbrad, so it's a lot of work for a very small benefit.
---
If its been a week I would just continue leveling and meet someone new. Its nice to wait but a week is quite a while without a heads up.
---
Well now I feel like it actually is an RP name...
---
It's called Guard Evading. There are many reasons it's not the same as passing trash but mainly because it bugs out the guards. The solution would be to put guard spawns on top of the buildings. or allow them to teleport to you, or you to them.
---
Since pvp doesnt really begin until phase 2 I would go blacksmithing right now. Best time at the beginning of something as big as this to make some very big money. So many people are engineer atm blacksmiths are going to be in huge demand. Especially if you can snag a Lionheart helm recipe you will be set for a long time.
---
Get a pizza!
---
Do you still get the rep if you do the quest on 60?
---
There are actually pserver tanks who run Naxxramas with a dual wield 00/31/20 Fury spec because it allows them to generate absurd amounts of threat and not worry about aggro.
---
It turns out that you don't even need a shield, let alone crit immunity to tank Naxxramas.
---
The one big concern affecting a Shaman's ability to tank is their lack of taunt. But fucking hell they're actually more viable than Paladins at tanking in Classic.
---
Lol he can go make his own or eat shit. You do you op.
---
Go engineering, I use bombs to help me with tanking, adds a solid bit of burst on big AoE pulls and lots of cool stuff at end game too!
---
I think you're arguing PvP rewards vs PvP mechanics. Many classes have a high ceiling for outplay potential, regardless of how you feel about the PvP rank system.
---
...you can get on a zeppelin and change continents as a ghost?  Never knew that.
---
Vastly reduced, unfortunately.
---
When I tank I CC 1/3, is that bad?
---
I really hope you're on a PvE server. STV on a PvP server with a controller sounds like one of the hardest gaming experiences any one person could ever endure.
---
Warlocks have paranoia, which is stronger than track hidden. On top of that, warlocks have the benefit of being the strongest 1v1 class in the game.
---
Literally have it on pause in front of me as I came across this thread. You should def check it out.
---
Where are you getting shadow wrath greens from the ah? Ive only found one while leveling
---
wait patiently couple months for Burning Crusade to come to classic (maybe) :-)
---
That's the dumbest, most ill explained thing in this game I've ever heard of.
---
Who won the battles don’t leave me hanging.
---
Good that others are vendoring it. While i sell it for 4 times vendor price on the AH
---
I play druid tank. I keep getting complaints from priests that I take so little damage they are bored from hardly having to heal me. This is even if a do big pulls.
---
Server?
---
Its not an argument dude. Its literally just math. Paladins are better at aoe. Period. Go see the hundreds of guides on the matter.
---
The tank should never pull when the healer is oom, end of story.
---
Well that is really wrong. Metzen was not an artist for blizzard when he was there.
---
“My game” entitled much?
---
It’s the relevant audience none the less
---
Being "greedy with drink"?? The healer said they need to drink and 20 seconds later the person died. That means they probably pulled 15 seconds after they were told to wait. Drinks take 30 seconds to use. You want the healer to cut their drink efficiency by half or they are greedy?
---
For the horde!
---
That's.... just... not how any of this works.
---
Needs more politics and explicit racism to be Barrens chat, 6/10
---
I am so sick of the people taking part in a social pass time, getting pissed off when being engaged socially. FUCK OFF WITH YO,  BACK TO YOUR BLOODY HOLE!
---
Seen it, orc and dwarf is what i really want.  Orc female, dwarf female.
---
These should be labeled excuses not reasons, the real reason graph would be 95% "stupidity"
---
Bad healers love to shift blame
---
I agree it should be out sooner (IMO BWL) but I seriously doubt blizzard will deviate from when it was canonically introduced far too late to be relevant.
---
I'm 37 and started to need on cloth/leather/mail with lots of intellect since I'm respeccing to ele at 40
---
The cancer is out of your life. Better you found out now than later. It’ll be rough, I’ve been there. But WoW is a great fucking distraction. You’ll be fine.
---
Same. Healers are far less available than DPS. I will just leave a group of idiots and find another one in under two minutes.
---
You pay for your sub don’t make your friends feel bad, secondly if you want to level a hunter then why worry? They level super fast. 
---
Better you restart with something that makes you happy then continue to level a rogue for another 60-70 hours to get to level 60. You pay per month to play this game if you’re not enjoying a rogue as much as you would a hunter then swap who cares what your friends think.
---
I...what? This is so completely tangential to what I’m saying that I’m genuinely confused.
---
Unless it was agreed on beforehand, never expect a speedrun. This ain't mythic+.
---
I've seen it proc multiple times with shield up, but I'm not entirely sure the increased resistance to interrupts is working.  Haven't thoroughly tested or anything, but I seem to be getting interrupted constantly with martyrdom + shield active in PvE.
---
Just for the sake of taking the photo.
---
Veins are effected by layering still. Try having someone invite you to a group and changing layers.
---
It’s important to consider that a dps loss isn’t always negative during leveling. For rogues especially gouge can be nice even if the dps goes down because it offers you a way to more effectively mitigate damage over time and this level a little more efficiently - especially if you don’t have food or bandages.  
---
That being said - I agree that at level 60 it’s unnecessary, and I also plan on leaving improved gouge behind when I get there.  
---
As far as its usefulness - it really is good for taking in two mobs at once. I don’t typically want to gouge a second mob when I have two or more combat points on my primary target (as you allude to), but it’s pretty easy to spend those points as a minor rotation sacrifice in order to most effectively swap targets and gouge. In dungeons and groups it’s also effective as you can mitigate an extra mob in combat that is attacking your healer or another mage-I mean dps.  
---
    
---
I haven’t figured out where I want to put those 3 points when I get to 60, but I might go with elusiveness. That’s what I did in Vanilla and it made 1v1 vs. other melee even simpler.
---
The aggro doesn't matter much since at 40 you get mail. Use 1h + shield until you get windfury then a slow 2h after.
---
Let him be in battle or zerker stance for increased damage.
---
I wasn't saying you were saying that, and I completely agree email addresses can be hacked/stolen, happens all the time. I was just saying if it was it's not exactly like the gun in the car metaphor because it can be fairly easily proven that the facebook owner was not the one behind the DDoS if the IPs don't match.
---
I would happily sacrifice my mount to ensure that the mage who spent 20 minutes sitting on my lower level Priest’s body (yes, 20 minutes just sitting there) gets killed so often he just stops playing video games altogether.

---
What about for pvp? Hit needed is still 9%?
---
How should I dps as enhance in dungeons? Will Rockbiter and Earth Shock not pull a ton of aggro? I'm already having trouble pulling aggro with Flameshock and Flametongue.
---
That's why it's called Holy spec. Because you get to play God.
---
This is a good tip, and a good use of the Rum if you have some laying around, but let's be fair  --  the early levels are already pretty trivial.
---
usually done with Refer a friend bonus which isnt in classic
---
It's an exaggeration done for comedic effect.
---
It probably also depends who you're talking to, the military doesn't seem as worshipped as it used to be, especially after the Vietnam war, Gulf War, Iraq War, etc.
---
&gt;The run went a lot better with just the four of us.
---
lol speaks volumes
---
I believe the bats in ZG have the same attack speed.
---
A better tip is to send some bags and gold. These are raid consumables your better off selling on AH
---
You said it's not one person's sole responsibility to watch one thing. I'm saying it's the tanks sole responsibility to never pull when the healer is oom, which is the reason the tank needs to watch Mana. But of course communicating is important.
---
I did my first dungeon run as a healer today after doing dps for the last 3 years. Mad respect to them, between pulling multiple packs, rushing through so there's no Mana, then getting mad when I focus on the tank, healers really do the lights work.
---
Shaman or priest for pvp healing?
---
On one hand shaman have great utility in totems and earthshock and are very capable kiters. On the other hand priests have "oh shit" heals, dispels, and mind control.
---
Also which kit is more engaging in pve?
---
Judgement of Justice on the mob and they will no be able to flee and they will NOT have increased attack power. 
---
In reality, this is BOTH of your fault. Both you and the lock should have knows CoR increased AP and you should have read your spells when you got them and you would know seal of justice can be judged to make a mob not be able to flee.
---
First time playing WoW and I've mainly been using the sword spec to level up.
---
I just got to level 30 and someone suggested that I should re-spec so I can start doing WPVP since I'm going to start being in contested zones a lot. 
---
Should I re-spec so that I engage in WPVP?
---
Get him his whirlwind axe at 30 (will need a bit of help from a 40~ if possible). At 32 you will get whirlwind totem which will help him kill stuff faster.
---
Personally i like a slow 2h for enhance so your windfurys are punishing.
---
Agro is tough with windfury as its a high damage proc which will steal agro. Expect it to bounce between the two of you - not much you can do about it.
---
&gt;Maybe you're the griefer all along?
---
So you mean that the griefer was inside of us all along and it's the ganks you do along the way that counts?!
---
I love your user name. Just FYI
---
You need to be using Sunder Armor instead of Heroic Strike.  Otherwise you're mostly on the right track!
---
That is by design. Skull is a target dps can blow up and kill before it does any damage while the tank gets threat on everything elsrle.
---
Warrior is also the most played class.
---
I’ve only played on Kurinnaxx and it’s been great so far. Honestly probably all of them are good as far as population goes. Probably would want to avoid the big time servers as there are queues (Harod, Faeralina, others I’m not thinking of).
---
I’d say pick a server that is the location you want, then just pick based on the name and whether there are queues. That’s what I did.
---
Here’s the server list for North America, there’s probably one for eu as well if that’s what you need.

Priest agro is actually busted right now. I think they made a post about it.
---
I just tell healers ahead of time not to heal me at all on my lock. I have self-heals. Don't waste your mana. If I die it's my own fault. ✌️
---
This is the correct answer.

And this is why you only comment inline when absolutely necessary.

That's a new one, haven't heard that yet.
---
Blizzard probably won't release phase 2 for several months which is retarded, tons of people aren't here to do raids so we'll hit 60 and it'll just blow with zero pvp incentive
---

---
That’s what I remember. I was getting killed in 1.12 Vanilla by Horde on the roof of Darkshire building, complaining about it to my friend’s guild mate (we were all in Vent at the time), and I distinctly remember him telling me “If you want to, you could take a screenshot of them on the building killing people, let a GM know and get them banned for a bit.” And I said “Really?” He answered “Yep. Rooftop camping is not allowed in the game.”

How is that different from running Classic dungeons? Spam chat for group, run dungeon, leave and forget group. 
---
It's the unique situations that create player interaction, not spamming chat. I wish we had LFG in Classic, it would save so much time.
---
 All they would have to do is make it server only and we'd effectively have the same thing we have no but without the chat spam. You would still see those dungeon players around the world, you could still group with them outside of dungeons, your interactions without the dungeon could still be meaningful because those players are in the same world you are.
---
Cross server LFG is what kills server communities and interaction. The LFG tool itself is amazing and I don't understand why people enjoy spamming chat when it servers no purpose the LFG tool doesn't fill.
---
Whaaaat???
---
Dude my friend mages leveled from 54 to 58 in a day, people are zooming through this leveling phase like dragsters, meanwhile I'm 48...
---
? Scroll down? Am I missing something?
---
I think SND isn’t really sort it until rank 2 tbh, before then it’s all ss, evis, and rupture.
---
Actually, it's a game but okay.
---
After all it’s an extremely rare recipe... oh... wait... what.
---
why the fuck would you tell everyone about this?
---
You can get this look pretty easily with Dominos and SexyMap. Not sure what the random black boxes are for, but the chat box is far too small, and dps meters should be hidden out of combat for any half serious UI
---
No, the Hunter class in general is a bugged pile of shit.
---
Hey put yourself on dnd if it actually bothers you seeing a pm. You're in the grumpy minority here and I can garuntee you its very normal to use /who to your advantage.
---
I was always a rogue. Am hunter now. In exact opposite position as you. Also want to roll human rogue but started on pvp server with troll hunter. 
---
F
---
See this shit is why I don't group with hunters.  I'm gonna use this when I reject them "youre probably on controller" lol
---
Its always a goddamn hunter
---
Yup, only comment intent at the start of a public method for documentation tools or inline when absolutely necessary. Comments become obsolete and misleading so quickly.

It's not an interface options afaik
---
I cannot claim to be 60, just 36. However I have been having the same problem in Desolace and Arathi. I got up at 4am server time to specifically mine nodes, and found just a couple during the entire route in Desolace. I too thought there must be tons of competition. So I tried Arathi the next morning, and same results. Hardly any ore.
---
   I cant begin to explain what's going on, just that you are not alone in this regard. I have begun having some success in Alterac, but I do worry about future zones. 
---
  Good luck with your mining!
---

It works for me, it has eliminated the bug totally for me. Just keep in mind that if you often use both mouse buttons to move forward that might cause some problems, because i have yet to solve that. But in general the mouse cursor always teleports back now, so no more mouse cursor hopping :)
---
How bored are you?
---
Wish he was sitting down getting mana
---
Only time I pvp is if I'm getting ganked or I see one of my fellow horde getting ganked. I don't care if I got like 10 mobs on me, brother I'm on my way!
---
No one specs prot to level.  It just is not needed
---
Horde player. It's extreme but okay.
---
Thanks for your response, could you recommend any lvl 21 one handed swords that would be good on a warrior? And I could buy it from a couple of gold.
---
Keep reading these in Korg's voice.  Hey man, we're starting a revolution.  Wanna come?
---
Mara gph is trash, you can make more gold literally just killing random mobs in the world.
---
When did they introduce X-servet to Vanilla BGs?  I can't remember when that was.  I do remember not being able to do WSG I think due to insanely long wait times due to no players, so I think cross server BGs is a good thing.
---
Oh no, it's retarded
---
Apparently not, because the tank died. Funny that.
---
Yes, I know it is a fantasy game. And I know that mechanics don't always line up with the setting. **That is why the post is funny.**
---
What is that quest log?
---
1. Yes you do
---
2. Sword is better for leveling.
---
3. Daggers are the best for end game.
---
True your right. I've been called out by a GM for killing the same gnome pair 6 times.
---
That’s the truth, and also is a reason us healers run out of mana more often.  Having to use expensive, fast heals on a mage arcane blasting 4 mobs on top of healing the tank.
---
It's 'Manage frames'.  Only enable that setting if you want Leatrix Plus to manage frames for you.  If you want to move frames outside of Leatrix Plus, don't enable 'Manage frames'.
---
Just one step above "I tried everything I could to pull aggro off of you.  Great job!"
---
How does one get the auction price under vendor price?
---
I'd just prefer to level in peace and not get inturrupted only because I happen to have low health/mana from that last pull and now I have a corpse run because I got outplayed by a full health who is 7 levels higher than me. It'll be a lot more fun once I'm 60
---
Maybe lower pop server or pve? On pvp servers the lower populated faction would have trouble farming them. I saw zero devilsaurs questing there.
---
Well I would personally say this depends on what your goal is. If you are just randomly raiding with the group and stock up with randoms, sure go for it. But if you are like the guild I'm in for example, we are building a core raiding group. 
---
The core raiders are the ones that do at least 2/3 runs per week to stay in the core. So if you build up a full core raid group you want to optimize it. But if the guild is stocking up on the few extras you get after the core is there, then yeah, it'd be a nice move to include suboptimal specs. 
---
We have for example a list in the discord:
---
Raiders
---
High Priority
---
Mage
---
Rogue
---
Shaman Healer
---
Medium Priority
---
Priest Healer
---
Druid Healer
---
Hunter
---
Low Priority
---
Warrior Tank
---
Warlock
---
Ever double up on garrote/rupture? I like EA too but some warriors try to deadzone me when I pop it, where rupture is guaranteed damage.
---
Exactly. A good priest will never go oom. Id do pulls with my favorite priest at 20% and she'll come out of the fight with 50%. Also the person in the post waited 20 seconds from oom chat to death - more than enough for any decent healer to drink a full water,  assuming they didn't waste time standing idle to type.. Most of the people posting sound like people I wouldn't want to tank for..
---
Vertical progression was great, but it's been 15 years of the same game. The verticality is a bit awkward now. At some point you have to just adapt, IMO. Also you don't have to make things horizontal, or whatever, to simply introduce some updated content to old zones and keep them relevant. I get a sense of progression more from beating a steadily stronger series of bosses. Not from going back to Elwynn and killing a level 5 wolf with one hit. And from my gear making it easier to kill trash mobs, not simply levels that have seen soft-resets since TBC. "Oh you may be level 60, but you gotta kill boars again."
---
As a mage it just hurts to look at, I feel so sorry for this guy but OP is taking it well
---
Got one to let me go back to the OG blue corpse run instead of the bright white one that burns my retina.
---
Sure. Have a good day!
---
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time.
---
It's not really worth purchasing stuff that early, just do quests and be on the lookout for a good 1-hander on the way.  Doesn't need to be a sword either, any 1h weapon will do!
---
I did it so I could play my retail and classic accounts at the same time. Now I'm a full on classic boy, no reason to pay for two accounts.
---
Swords aren’t necessarily better for leveling. You lose out on ambush without having a dagger mainhand  which can be a significant source of damage while leveling, they both have advantages and disadvantages. Combat swords is arguably the strongest spec for all 6 phases of classic, however seal fate daggers can be competitive or potentially outperform towards the end of the current planned phases with ultra end game gear.
---
Definitely dont want to rock biter or earth shock. Stick to flametongue until windfury for dungeons. Pulling aggro occasionally shouldn't be much of an issue if your healer is good, plus you have heals as well if things start to go south. You can always just stopping hitting things for a second to let your tank gain a bit more threat.

ohh thanks! I'll get that. looks so nice!

Some people have jobs and a life outside of video games?

They might be, it is always best to ask what spec their main tank is.  Unless hes a fury spec warrior they are casuals.  /s

Blizz fixed the dungeon layer farming. Layering was a mechanic. People abused it, so they fixed it.
---
I'm confused by what you're saying.
---
You can tell?
---
The hunter pet isn’t the reason that fleeing mob is coming back with buddies, you know that, right?  Don’t just blame the hunter when all the DPS need to be on those runners before they get too far.
---
Shout out to that low skill human warlock ganking lowbies in BB on Blaumeux early this week where the guards couldn’t get him. Days are numbered bud.
---
TL;DR Holy and Shadow are about the same in short fights, but Shadow Weaving takes the cake on longer ones. Holy can maybe stay competitive with a ret pally buff and +SP scaling though. Regardless, Holy heals leaps and bounds better than shadow though, so it's way more flexible.
---
Aww man yesss this thing looks totally badass! Maybe this process will happen when I raptor strike!!!
---
There was an anime? I only knew about the game...
---
Got a buddy that makes 50 an hour with the drops + people buying runs off him

Keep this up and the horde’s gonna do something crazy like burn down Teldrassil
---
you want to charge, switch to def stance, and bloodrage. then start spreading around sunders. heroic strike is only for when your rage bar is full, or the mob has 5 sunders, because heroics destroy your rage generation.
---
I think frostbrand outperforms flametongue once you get it also
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQTl6lxQhoo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQTl6lxQhoo)   pretty much this.

Dude... people kill themselves over online bullying.... so yeah, people 100% quit games over people mocking them when they get killed.
---
I'll never forget that week.  When it was finally my turn.  I took the week off of work for vacation but my guildmates (and a select few other already HWs) were prepared to help me out.
---
The first day or two were kind of exciting.  Even though I'd been non-stop PVPing for months helping others get their rank 14 something was different about this week.  I was really pumped.
---
By the 4th or 5th day I was highly irritable and super annoyed.
---
By the end of the grind I hated the game and everything about it.  I had to take a break from playing completely.  At first I wasn't even sure if I was going to come back.
---
I'll end up doing it again I bet.
---
That was a bug in classic, not in vanilla
---
huge clits*
---
I want to see you get down on all fours and tear shit up
---
Smiting your ass costs me nothing tho
---
You just need to have some more +heals and heal will become better. There is really no secret.
---
Retail healers never run out of mana.
---
I go into Classic and go, where did all my mana go? I just buffed the part of 5.
---
This just in! Water is wet, more at 11!
---
What?  This is way too simple.  Where is the egg timer?  The marbles?  Not even a single water counter weight.  Amateur.

Guess what, that's called being an artist.

The roof of the inn in Tarren Mills is reachable from the cliff above the town via Slow Fall. I may or may not have been chewed out by a GM or two for abusing that, but hey...

Reply to Tank:  Your dps is low on meters. learn to play.
---
I’m gonna use this from now on, just so you know.

I have seen some drop

Just because *you* don't know something, doesn't mean everyone else also doesn't know it.
---
Sadly for feral druids only ‘On Equip’ ,  ‘+stat’, and ‘On Use’ effect you through your weapon. Dps, speed, damage, chance on hit, etc all mean nothing when shifted.
---
Yea I mean I highly doubt that but okay
---
This must be the one and only reason I actually won many of my WPvP fights while leveling.
---
And then fund an epic mount?!?
---
"I have enough mana for 2-3 more heal spells and they are all reserved for the tank"

Something is adding class colors unless that’s a built in option that I missed?

I would like 20 man raids to be available from the start, but the itemisation is based on a bit of catchup isn't it.
---
How long are people expecting it to take all 6 phases to come out?  Will the all come out before the next retail expansion? Or will they come out to fill in gaps while nothings happening in retail? Or will they come out really slowly to make the most of classic?
---
I've had some druids complain about my brother doing that, I'm like bruh..  Just hot him to hold more aggro?
---
aren't they all
---
I got fiery weapon for 15g on my server, it's probably worth the price considering how often it procs. I assume 15g isn't too much.
---
A shame really. Like them removing life tap in retail. That button where the skill used to always be feels so empty now.
---
I know it’s minor but it makes me sad.
---
They didn't and other GM's are banning people for it if they do it for extended periods of time.
---
Lmao go back to retail
---
U wot
---
Its my first Shaman
---
They have so many important skills..
---
How do you keybind all spells? I need it efficienty..  :/ And which are the best totems for PvE DGs.. and idk. Its too much for my first time XD
---
I totally disagree. Many dungeons have occasional odd single mob pulls, which are trivially done without healing by a proper level group. Really it's optimal to do a small pull like this while the healer &amp; mage sit and drink to full mana.
---
It just doesn’t sound that good you’re not the full dmg potentials of a SM/DS or the  great spam crits with SM/ruin including other utility that Aff tree offers
---
Look, that one's fair. One of the few exceptions to that personal rule
---
Changing layers will not exploit gold. The resources already exist. The economy doesnt change because of people hopping layers.

I wouldnt go back but I'm still wearing it on my mage at 36

It's good, yeah, but far from necessary. The vast majority of people will never even see one used never mind own one themselves
---
That's insanity. Just adjust the guard ai to be able to get to them.
---
I did far more interesting things than just be a GM, but I'd be happy to as long as I'm not betraying internal information.
---
good to see other's still think like this..not many I find anymore.
---
I really hate inept tanks... I literally got kicked out of the group for as a hunter for doing my job... Yes, I am DPS but I also protect clothies and healers with my pet. And this tank did not pull caster mobs far enough back. \*shrug\*
---
What rate do you think blizz will release the phases? Do you think they'll do a fast rate to keep attention and excitement on classic, or do you think they'll do a chilled pace to allow the maximum number of people to work their way through each of the raids?
---
If you google "chris metzen art" you'll find plenty.  but it's all from like 95-01.  Sam wise is the main art guy at Blizzard.  Period.
---
Yeah, the point is that a whole lot of rep had to be grinded out to be able to buy another race's mount. And also more money for the mount itself, then.
---
I think it's part of the Thunder Bluff music.

You don’t get anything automatically.  This isn’t Welfare WoW.

I think that judgement on Blizzard's part for phase 2 is entirely based on an internal % of playerbase at level 60 / MC completion rate. Which is likely why they haven't hinted at all about it. Everything after that I think is up in the air based on other internal activity stats. 
---
Dire Maul pretty significantly changes the gearing at 60. If I had to guess personally though, I would say November/December. I could absolutely believe Blizzard dropping a "Phase 2 announcement" at Blizzcon to hype it if they feel they can justify stretching it out.
---
&gt; I really don't understand, it's true that this sub is sometimes a meme cesspool and some cleaning would be needed, but on some threads it's way over the line IMO.

INTRODUCTION
---
Minds differ still more than faces.
---
--Voltaire
---
Imagine--if you can--not having a conscience, none at all, no feelings of guilt or remorse no matter what you do, no limiting sense of concern for the well-being of strangers, friends, or even family members. Imagine no struggles with shame, not a single one in your whole life, no matter what kind of selfish, lazy, harmful, or immoral action you had taken. And pretend that the concept of responsibility is unknown to you, except as a burden others seem to accept without question, like gullible fools. Now add to this strange fantasy the ability to conceal from other people that your psychological makeup is radically different from theirs. Since everyone simply assumes that conscience is universal among human beings, hiding the fact that you are conscience-free is nearly effortless. You are not held back from any of your desires by guilt or shame, and you are never confronted by others for your cold-bloodedness. The ice water in your veins is so bizarre, so completely outside of their personal experience, that they seldom even guess at your condition. 
---
In other words, you are completely free of internal restraints, and your unhampered liberty to do just as you please, with no pangs of conscience, is conveniently invisible to the world. You can do anything at all, and still your strange advantage over the majority of people, who are kept in line by their consciences, will most likely remain undiscovered.
---
How will you live your life? What will you do with your huge and secret advantage, and with the corresponding handicap of other people (conscience)? The answer will depend largely on just what your desires happen to be, because people are not all the same. Even the profoundly unscrupulous are not all the same. Some people-- whether they have a conscience or not-- favor the ease of inertia, while others are filled with dreams and wild ambitions. Some human beings are brilliant and talented, some are dull-witted, and most, conscience or not, are somewhere in between. There are violent people and nonviolent ones, individuals who are motivated by bloodlust and those who have no such appetites. 
---
Maybe you are someone who craves money and power, and though you have no vestige of conscience, you do have a magnificent IQ. You have the driving nature and the intellectual capacity to pursue tremendous wealth and influence, and you are in no way moved by the nagging voice of conscience that prevents other people from doing everything and anything they have to do to succeed. You choose business, politics, the law, banking, international development, or any of a broad array of other power professions, and you pursue your career with a cold passion that tolerates none of the usual moral or legal incumbrances. When it is expedient, you doctor the accounting and shred the evidence, you stab your employees and your clients (or your constituency) in the back, marry for money, tell lethal premeditated lies to people who trust you, attempt to ruin colleagues who are powerful or eloquent, and simply steam-roll over groups who are dependent and voiceless. And all of this you do with the exquisite freedom that results from having no conscience whatsoever. 
---
You become unimaginably, unassailably, and maybe even globally successful. Why not? With your big brain, and no conscience to rein in your schemes, you can do anything at all.
---
Or no--let us say you are not quite such a person. You are ambitious, yes, and in the name of success you are willing to do all manner of things that people with conscience would never consider, but you are not an intellectually gifted individual. ** Your intelligence is above average perhaps, and people think of you as smart, maybe even very smart. But you know in your heart of hearts that you do not have the cognitive wherewithal, or the creativity, to reach the careening heights of power you secretly dream about, and this makes you resentful of the world at large, and envious of the people around you. **
---
** As this sort of person, you ensconce yourself in a niche, or maybe a series of niches, in which you can have some amount of control over small numbers of people. These situations satisfy a little of your desire for power, although you are chronically aggravated at not having more. It chafes to be so free of the ridiculous inner voice that inhibits others from achieving great power, without having enough talent to pursue the ultimate successes yourself. Sometimes you fall into sulky, rageful moods caused by a frustration that no one but you understands. **
---
** But you do enjoy jobs that afford you a certain undersupervised control over a few individuals or small groups, preferably people and groups who are relatively helpless or in some way vulnerable. You are a teacher or a psychotherapist, a divorce lawyer or a high school coach. Or maybe you are a consultant of some kind, a broker or a gallery owner or a human services director. Or maybe you do not have a paid position, and are instead the president of your condominium association, or a volunteer hospital worker, or a parent. Whatever your job, you manipulate and bully the people who are under your thumb, as often and as outrageously as you can without getting fired or held accountable. You do this for its own sake, even when it serves no purpose except to give you a thrill. Making people jump means you have power-- or this is the way you see it-- and bullying provides you with an adrenaline rush. It is fun. **
---
** Maybe you cannot be the CEO of a multinational corporation, but you can frighten a few people, or cause them to scurry around like chickens, or steal from them, or--maybe best of all--create situations that cause them to feel bad about themselves. And this is power, especially when the people you manipulate are superior to you in some way. Most invigorating of all is to bring down people who are smarter or more accomplished than you, or perhaps classier, more attractive or popular or morally admirable. This is not only good fun--it is existential vengeance. And without a conscience, it is amazingly easy to do. You quietly lie to the boss or to the boss’s boss, cry some crocodile tears, or sabotage a coworker’s project, or gaslight a patient (or a child), bait people with promises, or provide a little misinformation that will never be traced back to you.
---
Or now let us say you are a person who has a proclivity for violence or for seeing violence done. You can simply murder your coworker, or have her murdered--or your boss, or your ex-spouse, or your wealthy lover’s spouse, or anyone else who bothers you. You have to be careful, because if you slip up you may be caught and punished by the system. But you will never be confronted by your conscience, because you have no conscience. If you decide to kill, the only difficulties will be the external ones. Nothing inside of you will ever protest. **
---
Crazy, and frightening-- and real, in about four percent of the population.

Remind me not to group with you OP
---
I know, but I mean it's tracking all of the quests I have in this certain area, even the ones I'm not actively working on. How do I stop that? Before it would only show the quests that I was actively working on, which I preferred. Now it's showing every single one that I have in my quest log.
---
Yep your right buddy! Sorry to bug ya, you should get back to those sick MC clears friend!
---
She just wanted you to be undead like her
---
Wish I had that kinda meat
---
Does vanilla exist anymore? No. So why use the past to justify the future?
---
Actually this post never explicitly stated that it was talking about world layering. You claimed that exploiting layering does not affect the economy, which it has. So I gave examples of that. I know exactly what I’m talking about.
---
You’re saying he’s desperate for friends but your list of accomplishments is just pixels, lord bro you’re a warlock nobody is impressed. Keep spamming shadowbolt
---
By the time he retired, he was obviously pretty senior in the company. If you look back at the Warcraft 2 manual, it's illustrated by Metzen and Samwise, and it's Metzen's work that actually looks more developed back then.
---
Do you have a source for this? Everything I’ve ever read or seen in video interviews with blizzard gives Samwise the credit. Not metzen.
---
for progression hunters actually have higher dps parses on MC than mages
---
There's a toon on Atiesh named something like "Slappie" that ran past me once and slapped me. I hope they are just constantly doing that to everyone they see.
---
Nah the guy is a straight up ninja. The item will be literal bis for the mage for up to a YEAR. Meanwhile there's not a single build for the shaman where Frost damage is actually good.
---
“Saw on Twitch”
---
I found the root of your problems
---
They’ll probably release them in similar time as their original release (so p3 will come when 1.5 released and p4 comes when 1.7 released). Only one I personally feel would be different would be phase 2 might be earlier than we expect. But that’s just my feelies.
---
Lmao, I like how you're all like 'yes sir sorry sir, thank you so much sir' then first thing you go post on reddit.
---
Yes you're literally the only person on this wow subreddit who read these popular dwarf quotes in a Dwarf's voice
---
Some people like tapioca pudding.
---
People have different tastes
---
Sometimes, not very often, my drink wont work for 2-3 sec after combat. The tank sees me just "standing" there and assumes im good, even tho i'm trying to spam my drink which is still blacked out. I wonder if sitting first or making a macro will fix this.
---
Even if they were.. it's not overcharging if it's what someone might pay.
---
yo i'm serious I just have a ton of quests showing up on the right side of my screen and it's messy and triggering my anxiety ):
---
In which there is a *war*. Is that hard for you to grasp?
---
You literally said “changing layers will not exploit gold” in your original comment. It already has. So not sure what you’re talking about.
---
Okay okay, we all know clits aren't a really thing...
---
In my guild one of the people has a weakaura that says Gratz when it detects ding in gchat, but it's a bit loosely configured so it triggers on words like "understanding" and it's just become a running joke now to trigger it so he has to turn it off.
---
God please stop typing garbage classic fanbois like you give the private server and vanilla players a bad name.
---
Just because playing BFA would be worse than accidentally eating my shit and vomiting back into my mouth with no other option then to swallow and repeat.  Doesn't give us any reason to be mean to people who enjoy it.  It's just two different games.  If someone likes FF or GW or any of the other MMOs that's cool they're sharing an interest but not the exact game.  We're all gamers and mmorpg fans stop trying to create some weird rift or rivalry through your 3rd grade English and deformed frontal lobe.
---
shrug, I prefer reducing damage by ~30-45% with owl.
---
Screech + scorpid shot makes killing mobs just lazy easy mode.
---
Not great for pvp though :/
---
Fair enough, if you don’t want to buy it for a gold just find an enchanter and bring mats, duh
---
You sure take this game seriously my dude
---
As a mage, I cannot relate to this.. sorry :(
---
Why would I list accomplishments outside of wow in reference to you telling me to go back to retail... ngl I stopped replying to you because you’re an irrelevant moron who doesn’t know about the game but good lord at least think through your comments just a little bit
---
"Why would you roll on a PvP server if you're not going to kill every single Alliance you see! What do you mean you don't have a frothing hatred for gamers on another imaginary faction?" -Benediction Horde.
---
I would, but then we'd both be wrong.
---
The post is using the present, the one you referenced is a thing of the past.
---
Thats still not the cause of layering, the cause was a bug in it. Not layering &amp; layer hoping.
---
When you look at your demon’s abilities, they will either have a glowing bit around them or not. If you right click them they will change from being glowing to not or vice versa. When they’re glowing they will use those abilities automatically.
---
Looks like Questie
---
I think I might re-sub.....situations like this are too good to miss lol.
---
I actually was on almost the inverse of this scenario
---
Me and a friend (we were both Pallys) were wandering through Hillsbrad when we saw a horde rogue 5 levels higher than us and we jumped him and killed him.
---
he spend the next hour continuously reviving, hunting us down, and then trying to ambush us, only for us to turn around and slaughter him despite the level difference.
---
we killed him around 7 times in a row before the servers went down and put a hard end to it.
---
I lol'd at the picture on the wall. I'd probably sit here and fish for an age, if only just to keep the farmer company. I wonder how many visitors he gets
---
Did she learn it from the trainer?
---
Garubiduda, i'm fuckin cackling
---
I hit up the shimmering flats around 32. I decided to run around. Kalimdor as alliance and pick up flight points.
---
Doing only the race track quests will net you a level. As alliance and on Herod I found the flats a much more balanced play experience than stv. Sure  I got Ganked  but I had some fun duels also.  You can also finish most quests near the GY. 
---
I would wait to 34 to go to desolace there are enough quests  for a level or two. At 34 you can get the SM quest from SW.  prob good idea to ask for a group in chat since the Skellies  are 37-39. 
---
Essentially at 32 bounce around from south shore,  sm runs, shimmering flats, desolace,  north stv. 
---
Honestly you will be doing that through pretty much 40, adding alterac and the badlands the closer you get to 40.
---
Wow this is great, thanks for sharing.
---
take a deep breath and relax.
---
Difference between cause &amp; symptom.
---
This is partially inplace with rep rewards items from the factions related to the battlegrounds. But yeah dunno, i think pre-patch tbc they did exactly what you say and made everything cost honor which at that point was kind of a "currency"
---
Ultimate guide to not sucking: Don't play casters
---
Isn't the reward your 3" dick feeling bigger?
---
1. Calling somebody an “irrelevant moron” when you’re a warlock... lol
---
2. You’re still replying
---
I like keybinding with ctrl shift alt modifiers. So like for “F” I have most of my fire totems
---
Ok guy
---
Just a heads up you should look up the difference between your and you’re. It takes two seconds and saves you from looking even more stupid in writing.
---
I dont get the yo mama joke
---
Not always that simple. It's the fleeing mob that pulls others in so while you're trying to kill it because you're a ranged DPS you don't always get it down when no one else helps. (E.G the likes of humanoids that flee at 20% health)
---
I dare you
---
Wrong post?
---
Anything that enrages is something I hate. The scarlet myrmidons were a pain in the ass until I trained /remembered I had disarm.
---
Stay at home troll whitens her tusks with this one weird trick!
---
I really thought only horse did this kinda bs
---
&gt;no one hits skull...
---
When did this change? From vanilla til as long as i can remember, skull was "the one to focus down and kill", because... skull.
---
I also talk far too much about things that are off topic, have an upvoted. Also, I think I understand that story.
---
You’re bragging about being a “top dps” in a game where the best class has a rotation that includes: frost bolt. 
---
I think you need to look at yourself a little bit before mocking other people there, champ.
---
Be a paladin, paladin is beat tank for spell cleave cheese.
---
because classic is a simulation of vanilla lol
---
Ive helped about 5 people leave my guild after they type "leave" in guild chat. 
---
"Dont put a space bro, just /gleave." 
---
Dezmon has left the guild.
---
Now that is marketing.
---
I mean he was mocking the title of the post pretty heavily
---
Reading your comment, I don't think my post was aimed at you. There's a difference between someone ganking a lowbie once in a while for whatever reason and someone deliberately doing it all the time they come across someone of another faction. Hey, you are even giving (some none bullshit) reasons for your actions. There are some people who thrive on making other people miserable. You are obviously not one of them.
---
They actually aren't that rare, just very valuable
---
I think the implication is that janitors make little money and are looked down upon for lacking the skills to do a more engaging job 🤷‍♂️
---
Love at first shared bandage, then
---
He means like if you aren’t the tank and you are being melee down the imp will cast his fire shield on you or whoever else is being hit by melee.
---
So this is why I lost to that priest
---
Sounds super fun. And coming from a druid main, I'm all about having options for every situation. \^^
---
If you look up Shaman tanking you’ll see they recommend Rockbiter and Earth Shock to hold aggro, so 100% don’t use either in dungeons. Use your most recently trained non-rockbiter and fire shock instead. That should do more DPS anyway
---
Reminds me of beta testing Wildstar.  By launch I had found (and reported) enough bugs that I could point them out to friends as we leveled.  I guess my point is just finding bugs isn't always enough.
---
Since Overwatch came out I've always said how cool it would be for Blizzard to implement wow classes in the ow engine. First person weapon swinging similar to Reinhart or brig, locks casting dots and draining enemies like Moira. A man can dream.
---
Hate to sound like a broken record but i'd love to know what's making CC's show up in the portraits and the class colored frame! Sick of confusing classes in the heat of the moment lol.
---
Activate Windows you bum!
---
Is this configured via steam bigscreen?
---
Hahaha
---
And there's still zero word from Blizz on when the Extravaganza is actually going to show up in the game.
---
I don’t see your point.
---
it says 0.0013% drop rate on wowhead
---
Only looking at DPS is quite retarded for making an argument. Leveling as rogue and fighting mobs is a twosided thing. Damage delivered and damage received. Gogue basically increases the damage delived to damage received ratio by letting you regenerate energy. _It is irrelevant if the mobs you fight can be chainpulled without ever running low. And then your point would be correct._ However if you are fighting something that after a few pulls will force you to sit down and eat, then using gouge to regenerate energy becomes useful and the right move.  
---
And it will save you more often than 3% dodge ever could. And sword specialization is much better than Agression. Unless you plan on switching between all three weapon types in level phase a lot.
---
aye
---
The only abilities you get without buying are quest rewards. Simple trip to the trainer will do it.
---
Grob squad
---
I'm not even a hunter so i have no horse in this race. But even if i was camping rares is not something i deem worth my time. Sure i'd go and check every now and again, but i absolutely will not commit to 7+ hour campfests just for a .2 attack speed increase. 
---
Is it amazing? Sure, i believe it. Will i do it? No. I could be using that time to have actual fun or do productive things in life and just get a 1.0 ZG bat instead.
---
Yeah I got one at level 2-3 it was pretty exciting :)
---
if bug was in vanilla = that bug will be in classic
---
if bug is in classic but not vanilla = blizzard will fix it
---
.. with the exception of wall climbing which is due to new engine
---
Yup thats it
---
We get you bro, don't listen to the idiot who would be probably fine without gravity because fAnTaSy
---
I can’t remember if it’s always been bugged but like the others said if you abandon and take the quest from him it starts.
---
Pretty sure it just breaks when another person is there.
---
It doesn't matter at all who the target is hitting. Your warrior friend's rotation should be change in battle stance and sunder twice. Sunder is his best dps ability in a 2 man physical dps group. There's no reason ever really to go in defensive stance while questing.
---
Every.....fucking.......group
---
Where’d you get all this info from?
---
Thank you!
---
Water isn't wet
---
It's unintended because Blizzard has explicitly stated they didn't intend it?
---
And c'mon, you're searching for ways to justify it. It isn't a hard concept that circumventing guards = exploit. Don't be intentionally dense.
---
Found that tank
---
I used to work on a massive 30 year old c++ project that was absolutely full of these. Some Functions were made up of 10,000+ lines of completely uncommented code. This one was my absolute favorite: 
---
    DoAction(int i, int ii, int iii, int iiii, int iiiii, int iiiiii, ... , int iiiiiiiiiiiiiii, etc. )
---
Nobody in the company completely knew what it actually does or why all the variables are named like this. It's possible that some dev renamed all the original variables to fuck with the company before they left. It's also possible however that the original author simply didn't give a fuck and thought writing code like this was funny.
---
The worst part about it is that most of these Integers aren't even used as a Integers. Instead they contain multiple short or char variables that are separated using bit operations. This may or may not have a positive effect on performance.
---
It took even some of the most veteran developers weeks to fix a single bug in this function.
---
Deviate delight
---
Noted, I'll definitely check that out. Thankyou very much.
---
AQ gear won’t be possessed by a significant amount of the player base... it’s post-BWL content and even that was unknown to most vanilla casuals.  Obviously Classic is a bit different, but if you have 45-60 mins to play per night, a full set of Tier 2.5 ain’t going to happen. Tier 0.5 is much more attainable.
---
Maybe the real buff is the IRL feeling of safety of being around one?
---
After getting triple man ganked all the time in STV anyone would be a lil pissed. Atleast I don't do that pussy shit. Pure one v one. You also have a chance of killing me back LOL. I always make sure they are around my level before I engage, I'm not gonna waste my time killing people 10 levels below me like what most the horde does.
---
If it was a bug, why didn't they fixed then? There were tons of bugs back then that got fixed. But blizz now says "we will allow you to do it, but please dont".
---
Give me back my reckoning bug, I promise to not abuse it
---
I abandoned and talked to him then he attacked me. Thanks!
---
This is Herod server?
---
You ever see a female dwarf and realize how thicc they are?
---
Do it! Maybe PM the mods with some proof to get an IAMA going?
---
also just due to the nature of needing to report you what roof mattered a lot aswell since if you simply use a roof that was easy for other player to get ontop of just take a while untill they have gone around you won't get reported as they can just kill you. if you used a well timed slow fall to get somewhere nobody but a mage can reach you at yeah the GM will come.
---
i mean my friends got a 3 day ban in WotLK for camping the stormwind AH for like 6 hours on a friday evening. (our alliance side was shit)
---
do somthing for long enough and you will get punished.
---
Plus it’s cool to see all the numbers pup up
---
you have a contract with the wildvine potion and it didnt violate that
---
idk man, i'm not a developer at blizzard
---
Weave found the virgin
---
Download nugenergy.
---
Did you do desolace quests?
---
They weren’t that much better in 2004, people just have rose tinted goggles.
---
Given out 20+ 6slot bags in razor hill, saw someone telling a noob lvl 6 warrior to reroll but he said liked it so sent him the low lvl blacksmith axe+mail and he loved it(added him and hes still been playing war). Some warrior i joined up to quest with gave my mage a staff so i blacksmithed him some stuff too.
---
Unless the tooltip is lying, it should be buffing curse of weakness by 50%
---
I’ve not run tests to confirm that it’s working, however
---
let me rephrase:
---
if exploitable game mechanic was in vanilla = that exploitable game mechanic will be in classic
---
if exploitable game mechanic is in classic but not vanilla = blizzard will fix it
---
Just from other comments in this thread and then guessing, hoping people would correct me if I was wrong.
---
So the part where it instantly groups you and send you into the dungeon automatically is what bothers you?
---
I'd be happy with GW2's LFG tool. You created a post for the dungeon you want and others can open their LFG and select the dungeon they want and find a group that fits their criteria. You still have to message the person leading the group and co-ordinate your arrival but there is not chat spam (the part I hate about Classic).
---
Keep the pet drops until the economy stabilizes, they earn a few hundred gold.
---
Why whelplngs?
---
As a warrior in classic, I dont demand buffs however will take them whenever.
---
Hey dudes! It's been a while since I did one of these, huh?
---
Are you playing a shadow priest or warlock, but don't have time to grind out pre-raid BiS before going into MC? Do you want to kill Onyxia, but not farm all the best items beforehand? Well, this guide is for you! By following these steps, you can get geared FAST!

Annotate - 1/12/2005 .........
---
Azshara was much like this in classic. Probably one of the most remote and beautiful places, at least for alliance toons. It’s next door to Orgrimmar.
---
Remember, pet DPS is normalized to attack speed, a 1.0 attack speed WILL NOT increase your pet DPS, it will only screw with casters in PvP.
---
You only need a 1.3 speed pet to achieve a 100% Ferocity uptime with 3/5 points. Unless you're an avid PvPer you're just going to stress a few years off your lifespan for nothing.
---
Honestly I am just going to pick up a 1.0 ZG bat later.
---
Its unintended that the guards can not react to you being there.
---
Is there any way to change the fog? I feel like this was different in vanilla... Sure my old computer had way worse draw distance but I don't remember everything beeing so foggy. Go to shimmering flats and ride to Tamaris. When you see the mountains infront of you everything looks solo good. No look behind. You see a vast plain salt flar and some obscured mountains in the back. I am not talking about wheatear you can see the noj rains or not, it's just that it's all foggy which really sucks
---
Stealing this idea for my hunter. Thanks!
---
Fuck these dumb open letter rants, don't let it spread to this sub reddit too. Stop being a drama queen just tank. Tanks often think they're more important than they really are in these lower level dungeons.
---
Humans benefit most from Edgemasters in the last tier of content?
---
I'm not sure. They are fairly low level. But visit anyway, give a wave or two. :)
---
&gt;If that case were true, then why doesnt the attack get avoided? Mobs can't be hit if there is no path.

You underestimate how difficult this would be to code/implement. With mobs you're talking about a roughly static entity who's positioning can be reliably cross referenced with acceptable parameters. With a player you're talking about consistently comparing the position of player x and player y and opening yourself up to a whole slew of bugs/exploits wherein a player manages to evade bug while still doing damage.
---
If you're such a staunch defender of private servers, you should go do that and stop whining about classic on this sub.
---
Oh wait. You won't, because private servers are hot garbage.
---
Is this still a thing? Should we be gearing around this idea?
---
Exactly that
---
Auctionator has a setting to change the default duration, I believe.
---
Anyway, I switched to Auctioneer. It works, but is labeled as out of date. It still shows milling/prospecting results, but it still works.
---
I agree. I’m super happy with classic as it came! Having a total blast. I did pay for beta. I just didn’t get invited.
---
Demand is only going to go up as more and more people reach level 60, and they’re always going to be in demand.
---
I read about people running out of quests in the late 50s and I was so ready for it and...
---
Well now im 59 and I have so many quests, I just started EPL and WPL and I haven't even touched silithus yet. I don't know where this meme comes from
---
And no I didn't do any grinding or dungeon farming, I did every dungeon once (except BRD I've done that twice now)
---
Its surprisingly good.
---
In all the times I've visited him, I've only ever found another person there once. So he gets very few. It's really the best place in the game to enjoy some solitude. No enemies, no friendlies. Just some farmers and the scenery.
---
Is this some peasant joke I'm too warlock to understand
---
Fort makes sense but I’m full shadow and have had no problems healing.
---
I'm amused top comments are from people that think it makes sense. "Ohhh it's like that since ever, there is a rule, there is a blue post." Please link me all the rules/blue posts. I'm allowed to cast spells from places were warriors can't charge? Is pillar huging to LoS people abusive? Jumping to roofs is somehow abuse of game geometry, ROFL.
---
Why do you need to do it anyway? Can't fight people properly so you need to put yourself at an advantage?
---
STOP ANTI DRUID DISCRIMINATION
---
Yeah, it's nice to have places to go where you won't be bothered. And just... enjoy the solitude.
---
It's not that rare as far as I recall. May be worth more horde side as I dont think they have access to it other than through the neutral ah.
---
I believe that Kargoz has some of the best and most specific information of anyone out there, but he is not shaman-focused. Look up "Meldoran Shaman" on YouTube and you'll find one of the best shaman experts out there.
---
No, I'm using Nvidia Gamestream with my Shield. Connected the Xbox One Wireless Adapter there and used the addons. It is surprisingly good, even interacting.

You’re the reason Blizzard castrated wands in retail, I bet! 🤪

A lot of people took advantage of a bug that allowed people to get normal xp from raiding dungeons.
---
A lot of people also have optimized leveling routes.

And a lot of people play a *lot*.

You want mcp and lots of them, anything else is garbage, even atiesh

"Did you type away from keyboard?" Haha, wow.

I have that energy add-on, to be honest I'm just not sure what I should be doing with it.

I'm not sure if I've been to Desolace yet, I'll be sure to check when I get back on. Thankyou.

Yeah I didn’t want you to miss out on that! Also congrats on the mount! Makes the game feel a lot better having it lol

No problemo, guy.

They came from Lordaeron, historically.

Actually, I use KB+Mouse anytime I'm doing dungeons. And like I said in a previous comment, I'm not raiding with this.

Also, I'm usually top DPS in whatever group I am.

You should be concerned about keyboard turning Mages.

Yeah, check YouTube for ConsolePort

I usually just enchant some white gear, it can carry you well in to level 10-15

It looks like him though right? Anti asmon? I’ve never watched him, just see random pics of him looking absolutely stupid.
---
In my experience, in 2004 the asshats were the outliers, now it’s far more prevalent. I blame retail and the anti-social gameplay.

It isn't blood in the end, it's a red shirt, but still NSFW
---
Not even close. Mp5 is short for "+x Mana every 5 seconds" which is a special stat on some items. This is a special bonus which is always active, whether you're casting or not. 
---
The spirit stat increases your base Mana regeneration which begins 5 seconds after your last cast and occurs in 2 second intervals.
---
You might've noticed that there's the number 5 appearing in both of those systems. And they both involve Mana regeneration. That does not mean they're the same thing.
---
Good Lord, yeah, I'M the one with listening problems.
---
&gt; Well ofc the VW cant hold aggro against three dots, thats why you just do corruption and SBspam.
---
Have you actually played a lock? *A single shadow bolt generates more threat than a torment*. I just tested on the turtles in the 1k needles, it takes 3 torments + AA (ie. 15s) to take the aggro from me after 2 SB. Meaning that even without any dot, you generate roughly 2.5 times the threat per second of your VW. If you have private servers in mind, the VW threat generation was *significantly* higher there. Here, a tanking VW is simply not a thing.
---
&gt; and the spell pushback from tanking mobs yourself is too significant, thats why the FH/VW tanks for you
---
Good thing there is a talent that reduces the pushback on life drain and makes it a non problem. A talent and play style used by every single lock that looks into the optimal way to level.
---
&gt; thats why the FH/VW tanks for you
---
In what *universe* can a felhunter tank anything? You look at the mob the wrong way and it's already targetting you.
---
&gt; why are you bringing up priority for healers with mp5?
---
Because that was the original subject and I wanted to make sure my intentions are clear. 
---
&gt; Int is better than mp5
---
You still haven't given any convincing argument yet.
---
What a moron.
---
If you don't like 3. then you should consider taking up the mantle and tanking yourself.
---
As a former tank, I hate players like you who are quick to criticize a tank's pace. I'm not saying that tank was good or bad, but tanks learn to analyze a group real quick, so there's a reason he was pulling slow.
---
Actually TBC was announced at Blizzcon 2005 which was before even AQ came out. And pretty much every wow xpack ever has been always been announced and promoted before the last raid of the current xpack comes out.
---
Shimmering flats in 1k needles has a good cluster of like 5 quests that involve killing every single mob in the area basically. But after that it sends you on a lot of breadcrumb quests. Desolace and STV being the notable ones.
---
Desolace, Shimmering Flats (east thousand needles), Arathi Highlands, Stranglethorn Vale (mostly in the northern part), Swamp of Sorrows, Badlands. Not necessarily a ton of quests like earlier levels, but those zones have level-apporpriate content for you. Happy leveling!
---
I mean, people just like being congratulated. You sound like an ass
---
Omar is great for these cool explanations. Also there is the John Staats book
---
Bitches, leave.

Problem is that setting shows incorrect values, the " default " one is actually 2h. If you want to put 24h auctions for example, you have to choose 48h option

Where the fuck is it finding Brine Shrimp and algae in Mulgore?

For sure, just grab 1.2 Jaguar in swamp of sorrows until then, no need to stress it too much.

Frost shock instead of earth shock - problem solved
---
What addon are you using for totems? Or did you just organize dominoes a bit better?
---
Weapon speed normalization made the game more interesting though. It widened the pool of good weapons.
---
Oh man.. I had about 10+ people on ignore after a few days of selling Bronze Tubes for 25s a piece out in Darkshire right after the servers came up. Literally every single time I would post a 'wts blah blah' at least one person would say something in the public chat about how im a 'scammer' or that im ripping people off or trying to tell people they should just go to stormwind and buy one blah blah.. people LOVE standing up and getting upset about that stuff for some reason. I had to ignore them after they wouldn't let up, they just take it out of their day to try and be verbally abusive to someone they see making a few more gold than they are lol.. it was honestly surprising. Trying to explain to people that a) they don't have to buy them, and b) people still buy them all day from me even though they understand the circumstances just isn't enough.
---
The lesser Wanda we're going for 20s on launch, which matched up to just under the amount of money you have at lvl 10 when you visit IF. Your prices are fine lol
---
If every game is its own vanilla then my points about expansions are irrelevant because this post only refers to expansions, but I would argue that most of those as individual games would just flat out be bad games. I do think expansions (And a lot of expansions at that) can be done well. Most people just don't do it. It doesn't mean it is impossible though and the WoW team has the resources and opportunity to be better. So I thought I would share the ideas for how they could while it may actually make a difference.
---
I would suggest following a leveling guide if you are lost. I’m a rather new player to wow myself and I find myself using the guide quite a bit, especially to introduce me to new zones with boatloads of quests
---
I would always joke with the warlocks in my group that they were just converting my mana into theirs
---
On behalf of all the healers, we love players like you
---
The easiest answer is that the first 60 had 4 days played 5.5 days after release.  Pretty much says it all.  Efficient play, xp maximiziation, optimized route ahead of the pack and a fuck ton of play time.
---
You doing AoE farming? I see people farming the pirates in Tanaris often, but sometimes it's empty.
---
They fixed it and banned people who exploited it prior to the fix.  Intent is the key here, regardless of mob pathing/line of sight the intent behind guards was obviously to prevent players to be able to gank people in towns without repercussions. So if you find a way to circumvent the intent of a mechanic you have committed a banable offense. Case in point, layering is a mechanic, the intent of layering was not to allow people to be able to kill a boss multiple times without clearing trash, so when people found a way to abuse this mechanic they were banned. Do you understand now?
---
I've learned that since creating this post, which is really strange cause I remember playing with low ping once when the BR servers were created, dunno if I'm imagining things, or they were moved to Chicago after that.
---
Horde outnumber alliance on almost every server. Some worse than others. But that shaman took the role play a little too seriously lol
---
Based in my friend circle classic hit like a truck. We all know we wanted it and we all looked forward to it (nobody of us has played normal wow in a long time) what we didn't know is how incredibly addictive this game is. I mean we knew but we thought we are older now and not going to be completely irresponsible again. We. Can't. Stop. It's the best game ever made and more addictive then any drug I've ever done. However this is highly anecdotal since everyone of us also played vanilla. Don't know how it is with new players.

Waiting for that AMA any day now.

Is that Grobbulus?  I recognize that guild name, but I’ve had good experiences with the people I met from that guild.
---
Icy Veins is your friend
---
Still waiting on seeing if dw fury tanking is even feasible with classic wow's much higher boss parry ratings than in private servers. Might be hard to heal through that constant parry haste.
---
in my aoe group i ask the mage to nova the mobs so i can hellfire
---
I felt like I ran out of quests that I could do as most were orange at that point, so in the 50-60 gap I grinded at least 3 levels solely on mobs. But I never played on a blizzlike private server so I probably missed something along the way.
---
Oh right, I forgot about the faking death thing. My mentor told me about that as well. So what happens if he did finish casting the spell, now the bolt is now flying toward me, and I use the faking death? Do i absorb the damage because I am technically dead at that moment?
---
Thanks for reminding me btw.
---
You play on fairbanks?
---
You don’t control where you swim while polymorphed.
---
Most priests seems to be assholes now a days and anyone near a priest seems to join in with the asshole behavior. Maybe i should just start ganking them!
---
Life tap is even more useful while leveling, not sure why you would avoid it enough for MP5 to matter
---
What’s the benefit of switching weapons to cast WF?
---
Had a tank in Sunken Temple last night blame and kick me for not cleansing a fear off of him, causing him to aggro an entire room of mobs, tried explaining that it's quite hard to cleanse a fear while I myself was also feared. I even told him before the pull, "Make sure you pull this group back so we don't get feared into the room." He said, "Okay," and proceeded to stand directly outside the entrance of the room.
---
He also allowed mobs to sit on me &amp; the DPS the entire run, even when we ran up to him we'd have to type out in /s that we needed the mob pulled off us, if we said it in party we'd just get ignored. After being kicked two of the DPS left and we formed our own group, got a new tank, ran the dungeon about 4 times with no hiccups.
---
Can't fix stupid.
---
Report it to Blizzard.
---
Console port direction was originally a joke since devs have continuously been pruning skills... can totally see this as a reality with continued pruning

Apparently not the case in this sub, Based on the almost daily arguments of need/greed rolls when it comes to any BoE gear.

Iron Grenades &gt; everything else
---
I was alliance but I would have to assume yes. They dropped in AQ40 so you could mount in the instance to run back to bosses.
---
Generally flametongue weapon and flame shock will be your go-tos until you get windfury. However I've totally used rockbiter weapon while playing with a good tank and didn't run into any issues.
---
They knew how to. They put in the time.
---
I love it when people do this. Even if they don't make sales at least they give some good chuckles.

I keep getting the HTML view of it and it's annoying and I can't turn it off and it's not working as intended because of it

You can find fun either place if you put in the effort
---
I did the same thing a few days ago.  I was doing some of the troll quests in STV.  A few horde sharing the area with us, but all just wanted the quest done, so no PvP, just everyone leaving each other be killing NPC's. 
---
I start attacking what I thought was an NPC troll mage, but turned out to be a player troll.....  I killed him, but the group he was in starting coming for me so i ran/blinked and got out.  Left the area thinking, ahh fuck, I broke the peace, and I'll have to wait until they finish the quest before I go back.
---
I go back 30 minutes later thinking they probably moved on and finished the quest, and they are still there.....  but all hell had broken loose and there were a horde group with the mage still in it, and an alliance one just going at it.
---
Nah, I'm a warrior im afraid.
---
Yeah but I am now currently leveling my Wind Serpent I got from Feralas. She is the rare one. It took me like 3 hours to tame. I am planning to go level 60 with this one first ;)
---
I switched from enh to ele at 45 and I'm actually drinking less and killing enemies faster than I was as enh.

Sneaky git
---
Yes it did. I played in March 2005
---
Thanks for the explanation, but I still don’t agree that being on a building to avoid guards should be a bannable offense.
---
People getting angry about the auction house are hilarious. You charge whatever you want.
---
Unfortunately as a Druid healer I can only really let people die for stupidity when there's another class around that can res more than once every half hour.
---
With you on some Warlocks though. They life tap to within an inch of their life, but then they multi DoT or AoE so they're always taking aggro as well.
---
Horde and projection
---
Nah I cleared STV as well, should've mentioned. But yah, I do have a few green quests still, so maybe i'll do those, just not sure if the XP per hour is worth it compared to straight out grinding since they are now green quests.
---
if you are next to me I will die a happy man.

Goblin guards are bugged now..often blind and don't react to pvp.Not how it was in vanilla
---
Are you having fun? If so then why worry about anyting?
---
I don’t gank warriors and always help out a struggling warrior, try to give them mage food too if they are on my faction. Warrior was my first and only class in vanilla and I still remember the grind. I’ll always help out a warrior.
---
He, yes.
---
I was buying greater essence for ~12-14s and making a wand and censoring.  Easily made a good or two (back when that was useful) on that trick alone.
---
Out of the loop, what's this whole grizzly thing?
---
And you wonder why groups are looking for tanks every minute of the hour...
---
Tanking is a shit job and you don't have many options of holding aggro, especially when your dps are nuking mobs on pull, yet you'll get all the blame when the group wipes.
---
How old are you that you seem to think people who play classic are all bastions of the community and the only dickheads are people that play retail?
---
I use the addon Leatrix Maps or whatever it's called which lists all yellow quests available to me on the world map, and it looks like i've done pretty much all of them.
---
You missed "I NEED FUCKING MANA YOU FUCKING RETARD."
---
Would be a good idea if you can turn it off, could see it getting annoying aswell after so long.
---
balanced LULW
---
I second this!
---
It's surprisingly easy.  People make tanking sound much harder than it is.  If the group lets you set the pace it's not bad. It's when you get hunters or something that just can't sit still for a damn second that ruin things.
---
do you really think we're not using this kind of macro?
---
Completely wrong
---
Get Shadoweave robe at 38
---
As previously stated there is a global cooldown.   Im commenting to tell you:
---
The global cooldown is a period of downtime that follows after almost any ability you cast in WoW. The GCD prevents players from being able to spam fireballs as fast as they can hit the button. 
---
Furthermore there is cast time:
---
Cast time (or casting time) is the time needed to cast a spell or ability before it takes effect.  Which makes it easy to confuse why an “instant” cast still makes you wait to cast another spell.  It’s because there is always a delay between spells which is called a global cooldown.

Full doesn’t really mean anything with layers. That could be 2000-15000 online or more. Because each new layer adds a whole new temp realm.

Last night I switched to Benediction from Herod. I didn't have a way to remote log and I get in late from class, so it was usually 1030-11 by the time I got in and I had to get off by 12, so I got maybe 1 hour a night. Right now it's 10 at night on a Friday and there's no queue for Benediction.  No queue and still plenty of people. (Also better faction balance, I think)
---
Def stance gives all your abilities a modified +30% threat.  So you charge in and switch to def right away.  Thunder clap being out of def and doing only small damage doesn't cause a lot of threat but it will slow their attacks so you take less damage but don't worry about that for now.  Worry about threat.  Demo shout does a small aoe threat, battle shout also will aoe threat everyone but you want to make sure your casters are within the 20 yrd range as the more people your battle shout lands on the more threat it builds.  Other than that warrior had a hard time with aoe threat.  What I do is charge in, hit berserker rage (important to make sure your dps holds off for a few seconds so you get hit by mobs builds a ton of rage, if they take them off you there goes your rage that you needed), switch to def stance, blood rage, start tabbing through mobs just hitting each one with a sunder and on to the next, revenge whenever possible as it's low rage cost and high threat.  If you make a main target and they are not doing aoe just one sunder to the rest should keep the healer from pulling off you then just stack sunder and revenge main target.  Switch back to others when you feel you should be fine with not hitting main target anymore and build a threat lead. 
---
I saw you said you spam taunt and heroics so just a quick bit on how taunt works.  You don't ever spam taunt just because it is ready.  Taunt doesn't actually build threat... if you taunt a target that is already attacking you nothing happens basically and you put it on cool down for no reason.  What taunt does is jump you to the top of the aggro chart.  So if a mage or the healer pull something off you... that's when you taunt it to get it back... but you need to hit it again after the taunt in case it is actively taking damage they will just pass you in threat again and pull it off.  When you taunt you just barely jump ahead of the top threat basically so the gap will be close and you need to build that gap then switch to spacing threat around again.  Most dps go balls out way too early so expect to be frustrated as a warrior with your dps in a group if they don't listen.
---
Here’s my context.  This piece is here, that piece is eleswhere.  You can get here again just as easily as I can get elsewhere.
---
Really!? I bet it’s that damn census one

I wish they would embrace flying a feature, like they did in Lich King - the 77-80 Zones only even being accesible THROUGH flying, and boasting some gorgeous world design too, hell the creativity even, with the flying hubs in Icecrown, or the dragon hunting dailies in Storm Peaks. 
---
Lich King still has the best world design of all expansions, imo. Vanilla has some quirks that feel tedious sometimes, zones like Azshara and Silithus being almost completely empty, due to never being finished or odd placements of hubs and settlements. Back when i was leveling, i would've never found Light's Hope Chapel, for example, because there is zero to none visual aid on how to get there, and a big hole in the ground even separates it from the rest of EPL. 
---
I'm not saying Vanilla World Design was bad or anything, it just lacked some polish here and there. Then again, that's part of the charm, innit?
---
It's been far from a solo grind. I've added and been added to friends lists since day one from grouping for quests and have kept in touch through our level up process. I'm 48 now and have made more memories and friends in under 1 month than the last few years playing retail. Try it and have some fun

Dragonscale Leatherworking - Obviously meant for Shamans and Hunters since it is mail.  It leans more towards the shamans tho as most of the items are spirit/stamina based.  Hunters and Enhancement Shamans want the Black Dragonscale armour set from this specialization.  It gives stamina, fire resist, and MASSIVE attack power (which helps both ranged and melee).  As for Elemental and Restoration Shamans you want to look into the Blue Dragonscale set as mentioned before.
---
Tribal Leatherworking - This specialization is geared more towards Druids.  It has the Ironfeather set for casting and the Devilsaur set.  The Devilsaur is also good for rogues but not worth it for just those two pieces alone when you can get someone else to make.  The Ironfeather plus Devilsaur Set combo on a Druid makes for a GREAT Hybrid.  There are also the Warbear items to boost a Feral Druids attack power and stamina massively.  This specialization also contains the Wolfshead Helm which is druid specific as it grants rage and energy when you shapeshift into Cat or Bear form.
---
Elemental Leatherworking - This is more or less the Rogue's specialization.  Most the items in it are either agility based, critical hit based, or chance to hit based.  Very little strength increasing gear since it isn't as important on a Rogue.  This specialization though is also one of the best ways to get your resistance gear for endgame dungeons (Volcanic Set is a prime example).  Do to that it is also not a bad choice for Druids who want to make all their own resistance gear instead of farming.  A Cat druid will aslo benefit greatly from the items in this specialization (afterall...a Cat Druid works almost identical to a rogue).

You need to get both the left and right bindings of the windseeker from MC to start the quest to attain Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker

That short cut saved me so much time
---
This comment was a fucking RIDE.
---
Yeah I just haven't seen it work personally. But I don't have a regular tank to experiment with
---
Wait.
---
Lemme stop for a second and make sure I know what actually just happened.
---
Did you just learn something new?
---
In the Starcraft manual samwise’s looks leagues better than Metzen’s. They’re both really cool but samwise takes the cake for me. That ghost looks so badass http://ftp.blizzard.com/pub/misc/StarCraft.PDF
---
You are an idiot
---
THERE IS ZERO GUILD INVITE SPAM ADDONS FOR CLASSIC WOW. IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.
---
Yea I got the same error. Need to run launcher for the patch/update
---
I wish I would have gone with the jawless instead of the weird looking full jaw
---
We have those same laptops where I work. They suck.

If you'd like to upload a higher res version of an ancient meme be my guest. 🙂
---
&gt;Death Coil has a 2 min CD and is generally not used during questing unless something goes wrong
---
Is it worth using every 2m for the heal? Thats what I do but ive not really bothered to analyze if its efficient or not.
---
I might be on the wrong server then (thalnos). I'm level 16 mage and I'm always just questing alone. I recently gave up when two people could've saved me by killing a mob but instead waited till I died so they could get the mob.
---
I’m gonna sound like a massive douche now, but seriously: Are we gonna have these posts twice a day? Just make a sticky ”To all DPS” instead.
---
🙏
---
I encourage warlocks to life tap between pulls. I throw a renew on them then drink. I do NOT encourage them to life tap when they have aggro. One did that today. He ded.
---
I've been trying to get the pattern all day and a warlock has. even murdering me, I reported him
---
How “the retail crowd” gets credit for aoe spam is beyond me. Within the first day? First day of what? We knew months before launch that aoe would be efficient, as soon as we got the xp numbers from beta.
---
Pserver people nabbed every classic “first”. M+ players didn’t.
---
People have been giving livid over this for thousands of years.
---
I think you could have gotten a lot more tbh. I’d have bought that to flip.
---
I wouldn't say I'm "loyal" to Blizzard by any means but its severely unprofessional to betray the trust they held in me.
---
How are Rogues 1-30? I'll play pure solo 90% of time

How did you get the gm job?

What was your weirdest ticket you handled?

How rampant was/is cheating/hitting/hacking?
---
I am a very casual player, I don't spend the gold but I get on much except for training and an occasional piece of gear and repairs. I don't buy gold, because I personally don't use it. I don't understand why it's such a big no-no. Certainly the people using the auction house shouldn't be complaining about it. I don't care either way about the gold sellers, except the spam is annoying.
---
Darwinism in effect.
---
Hes littering
---
Nice try blizzard!
---
My brother preach! Alliance fear the lash of the overpopulated horde no more! Come to the server where we have an even shot!
---
Yeah he clearly improved very quickly in those early years. Metzen's art got a little more polished but there's still something weird about his figure construction that makes it look a bit stiff and amateur next to Samwise's. Still very much an artist on those early projects, though.
---
He hit play before the update started
---
Lmao imagine trying to police this.
---
“I only have so much mana!”
---
Okay so you didn't read what I said about the fantasy, because in the fantasy it makes sense.

That little dog syndrome is really prevalent on the Alliance side eh?

Today Azeroth’s weather is at optimal settings.

Noooo

The best solution is to create path's for the NPC guards to attack the players on the roofs, make the roofs to difficult to reach (look how many things are this way) or put guards on the roof like they did in retail.
---
What are you talking about?
---
I’m talking about guards.
---
Thank you very much! That was extremely in depth and all the information I needed. 
---
One more question, tanking is easier if everyone attacks the same mob I’m  attacking, so as long as I go in create a minimal amount of threat on all mobs, then put an icon on the one I’m killing the adds should not change agro as long as everyone is attacking the mob I’m attacking. Is that how low level tanking should work?
---
!remindme 3 months
---
No. No, no
---
No comments smdh....dude left them with what might as well be a slab of ancient Cunieform.
---
One of the shittiest solo classes, but still miles ahead of solo warrior. But honestly upgrade your Mainhand regularily and you can play it just fine.
---
Dang should've dung that ding.
---
Why though?  Are you trying to tell others how to play the game?
---
Meanwhile, my kodo makes no noise when walking except for a few footfalls immediately after landing from a jump. Never knew how much I'd miss not hearing them.
---
You forgot to add in “did you pop bloodfury?”
---
it's weird how reddit takes to hating certain repetitive memes while letting others run on forever. You very rarely see that "nobody: absolutely nobody:" dogshit anymore, for an example.
---
It's on a timer most likely
---
I mean she has a low skill requirement but at higher ELOs she is basically a troll pick. I think blizz released her to try and get more people to heal.
---
Jesus you're a sad, sad person
---
What level dungeons have you healed?  I healed SM GY with no problems but I heard that higher level dungeons are a problem. Plus as soon as you tell a group you’re specced full shadow you lose their confidence.
---
Oh shit. I want the rpg aspect of it dual wielding and dps burst but fck I only play solo
---
Hey you know what's crazy? I originally wanted to roll in Stalagg. I am playing from South Korea btw. I just wanted to play classic wow and interact with people who speak English. Anyways, the server name just came to me that it will be the server I have to play!
---
It was either day 1 or day 2 of the launch. I was being little clumsy using the battlenet. I couldnt really find the tab to download the classic wow. So i went to the website, and they told me I must first register. Okay, will do. Clicked it. And I was registered on EU relam. I don't think there was a way to cancel the transaction. 
---
I said fook it, god I am so dumb. Let's just play... QQ
---
And I keep hearing story that Stalagg is one of the worst servers for allaince to play, sitting underdog by like 3:7. Or even worse. That is exactly the same here in my server at EU relam. I am at Noggenfogger. I think it was my destiny to survive the jungle.
---
So far, I have met a lot of cool people in my server. But once I hit 60, I am planning to register for another month, then when it is done, I will be moving to NA server for a fresh start. I really want to experience how you guys communicate and play the game. What gaming cultures you guys have. Etc. I hope your guild stays there for a long time. I am coming!
---
Overwatch was just too proudy.
---
Your banned lol
---
Yeah, it's very good to play with a controller. Since you have three modifiers,  you actually have 40+ skill slots.
---
It's not that different from FFXIV, for instance.
---
Yeah. My first dungeons at low level I was happy I'm getting heals. Now I whisper the healer to stop healing me and save mana because I have bandages and self heal.
---
Still they heal me even when I'm eating and I have to wait afterwards for them to drink. Guess I shouldn't be complaining though.
---
Blow JOB
---
Frenzy lasts 8 seconds.  Where are you getting "2 attacks" from?
---
CensusPlusClassic includes a small addon called WhoLib, which messes with the Who function, but Blizzard broke any addon that messed with the who function, so WhoLib is broken at the moment.
---
As far as why it was laggy previously, that was because CensusPlusClassic was using the who function to Census, so your who requests were queued up, alongside the censusing.
---
I switched from Combat to a Cold Blood/Preparation build at 60 and I just feel like I'm doing no damage. Is this to be expected? Based on things I read I was expecting to just walk up and 1-shot clothies, but I'm really not hitting that hard. 5-point Cold Blood eviscerates are only doing around 1500-1700, and I can't quite seem to stun lock anyone. Is there a guide on openers someone can link me to?
---
it's been a rule for 14 years. what kind of "adult" thinks they are above the rules?
---
This is a private domain afterall. the only rules that matter are blizzards.
---
\&gt; Can't fix stupid.
---
You can't heal it, either
---
just as a counterpoint, you should know that for the most part, druid tanking/dps gear is pretty similar. both specs prioritize agi/stam. armor is icing for dps,. but vital for tank. as a feral leveling druid, if agi gear drops, I'm rolling on it. unless it's pure agi, then I'll probably pass
---
I mean, the ulduar 10/25-man achievements for the 310% proto-drake were already trivial before it was implemented as a purchaseable speed. Random pugs could get it done with a little effort and a couple hours of raiding.
---
Or they could just.....add a guard. lol
---
Ive used icy veins and its been super helpful. Im enhancement and leveling before 30 was pretty boring but with wind fury its spiced it up a bit. Elemental is really nice for dungeons but hard questing wize. And not sure about healing saving that for 60 :D
---
Here's just a tidbit of what I'm talking about dipshit. 
---
&gt;I killed him seven times. He finally decided to res behind the tree, and started to run away with his wolve form. But I knew what to do. He was tracked. I could see him in the minimap. He went all the way down to Ashenvale. I went after him. I killed him again. When he came back alive, this time, he decided to run back to the Felwood. I assumed he was doing it, because it would be closer to the graveyard. Anyhow, he died again.
---
I don't think you know what projection means dumbass.
---
Had no idea!
---
Focus targets aren't a thing like they are in retail. He's trying to suggest an /assist macro. That's a function that will target the target of your target. 
---
For I example  use an /assist [@pet] macro to quickly target whatever my pet is attacking. You could replace "pet" with the tanks name if you wanted, and just update the macro when you get a new group.
---
I don’t know if I’ll be able to raid or not, so I’ve set my endgame goal to get the version 2 dungeon set as my primary goal! Looking forward to trying it out!
---
The sad thing about the old world redesign was, as ambitious as it was, it ate about 70% of catas development for content that... no one really cared about anymore at that point. Seeing how Cata drastically lost steam as soon as 4.2 hit, with 4.3 being almost entirely made from pre-existing assets, i think it was wasted effort, except maybe for those, who leveled a Worgen or Goblin alt. 
---
Cata was just such a waste of potential that it makes me angry.
---
I had no idea!
---
You not using hellfire in raids?
---
Hey can i get a quick clarification?
---
I regularly gank Horde in Ratchet. Many times right on top of the flight master. Guards don't aggro here - they don't for almost the entire city. Is this against the rules? Because guards don't aggro me?  What is the extent of this?
---
To my knowledge, there is a boost to level 110 in retail if you level to 60 in classic. I think other posters are confused because you used the phrase "level 60 boost" instead of "level 110 boost." Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.

&gt;People have been extradited for DDoS attacks before. I don't know why you think it's so unlikely.

Lol, that'll do it!

&gt; not consistent with how the game has been moderated for 15 years, but sure.
---
Except it has been the case since vanilla.
---
http://blue.cardplace.com/cache/wow-general/2336291.htm
---
I mean, if it's such a big issue, when wouldn't Blizzard just add a guard there? Wouldn't that pretty much end the entire thing for good?
---
agreed. all these people acting like paladins are bad probably either have never had a pally tank or have only seen shitty ones. 
---
granted, they are already the rarest tank due to obvious misconceptions. but I have only had good experiences with pally tanks in 5mans
---
I played lock back in vanilla and I was pretty darn good at it. granted I'm forgetting a lot in my old age but 26 is not two old to know whats the best way to level a subpar class
---
The best tip would be to do all of the above.
---
Which is what Khaos was saying. Some healers are pretty good or are well geared and thus can handle a smaller pull at, as he said for his example, roughly 20% mana while others will struggle at 80%. Thus it's not a matter of the mana being low, but the mana being *too low for the pull*.
---
film or didnt happen imo
---
Romania is one of the few countries in the world that will extradite someone to the United States.
---
It's not going to happen, I know you people all think that because this guy disrupted your special happy time with a video game, that he deserves to fry, but it's just not going to happen.
---
pressing the print key should fix it
---
Dude, don't eat the mushrooms the Tauren mystics offer!
---
will they fix it though? if they dont theyre fucking stupid
---
So you're saying rogues can't gank in open world when they are low Hp because they aren't fighting properly?
---
It's a pvp zone. Everything besides glitches should be fair game. (what op was doing was basically a glitch that avoided guards)
---
They are? Why so? I’ve been murdering them so far in world pvp. 
---
Is it dots + fear + deathcoil + lifedrain?
---
100% 
---
I’ve been tanking since the 30s and I’ve loved it. I can handle basically anything in BRD, and usually better than warriors due to the size of the pulls. 
---
People really just don’t understand how Paladin tanking works.
---

If you enjoy playing everything, play a healer or something that there is not a lot of out there, everyone plays a warrior/mage for example so if you enjoy something that's not warrior/mage, don't go for those. Paladins are very useful, Warlocks as well and like i said any healer class honestly, there is never enough healers and you will always be wanted for groups which is what really matters when you hit 60, you will be spending most of the time in groups and dungeons late game. I for example always played warriors on retail and i wanted to go for a warrior for classic but everyone and their mother is playing it so i went for something else, and maybe ill make an alt warrior when the time comes.
---
That's what happens when literally every warrior is considered a "tank". Most "tanks" I've run with don't even use defensive stance because then they can't thunder clap.
---
Ah ok, that makes sense. Thanks!
---
No of course i didnt learn anything i already knew that
---
I just didn't know that it's every 5 seconds, I thought it was every 5 spell casts and thats a little more difficult to discern if its worth at that point
---
Haha, that's great that you're able to recognize the server just by 3 lines in chat :)
---
It felt so good to quest there again after so many years of the ruined Cata version
---
Yeah same, even tho I never played retail longer then a week. Classic has been surprisingly social. People constantly sending me invites when we are in the same area leveling. Also joined a guild which is full of noobs like my self. We have cleared RFC and WC for the first time (not as server first, as in first time in our life). Also Barren’s chat is something else. 
---
If you low level 10-20 and bored of solo grinding just go to barren, there  are a ton of people questing there as well as the chat is full of banter.
---
Pisslisp
---
Exactly y i left my guild. Dungeon leadership was shotty
---
This probably also applies to ice barrier. Us poor warriors didn't even stand a chance.
---
I'm leveling other classes and checking every now and then, especially at night or during early morning. No luck yet but I'll get him eventually. All I'm afraid of is that I won't even want to play my hunter anymore when I get him lol.
---
Yes because it does a couple of negative things in my opinion. One it removes you from the world and two it removes all most all communication. While spam is lame it still requires communication before the group comes together which usually leads to move conversation. 
---
The message/bulletin board would be awesome
---
I forgot about that staff, that’s a good idea. I was also thinking about that melee crit talent in the ele tree and flurry in the enh one, but wasn’t sure if other things are too valuable to miss out on. Thanks!
---
Feign death won't do anything if the spell was already completed
---
Do you want pets or no pets.
---
Having a world pvp addon my list is quite long.
---
It sounds an awful lot like you learned something new. And it also sounds like that new thing you learned has changed your opinion that, just a few hours ago, you were being obnoxiously arrogant about.
---
As a warlock. Please stop tipping off my health when I lifetap...I have spells to heal myself and if I’m doing my job correctly I’m not pulling aggro and not taking any damage. So really...stop. Please.
---
i just love how much they can pull and still take so little damage. it's incredible. I throw on thorns and combined with ret aura, it's pretty uncommon for someone else to steal threat.
---
paladins and druids really compliment each other well. both as healer - tank or tank - healer.
---
I love devotion aura when I'm tanking. shit is fabulous

It's such an absurd waste of cash to buy gold, it's really not as hard to make mount money and such as people think.
---
As a Healer I am for sure guilty of healing Locks when they tap but I never prioritize them over the tank. 
---
In an case, as a new and fresh healer: Is this something I should expect every Lock to do? Is there any tell/sign I can easily see to determine that this lock will tap hp but should be fine without my healing?
---
I hope my questions makes sense:s
---
Wont be the same everywhere I suppose
---
Major keys to success
---
KHALED
---
Yeah that’s my bad on the miss understanding. I meant it’s a boost to max level.
---
Why would it have to be someone from retail?  That's just ridiculous and wouldn't matter where they came from.  Could just as easily be someone who hasn't played for 10 years, someone from retail, someone from pservers.  It could have been you timmytotems!  Good cover, you've been figured out.
---
Yeah, we should have guards patrolling on the top of every building in the game.
---
Do you play any competitive game? Retail 3v3 arenas are much more balanced and the fact that you have an instanced fight makes everything so much more competitive, the same goes for League of Legends or CS:GO who are E-sport level games, Classic has no arenas and people have different gear, different professions and different classes. WoW isn't as hard or competitive as a MOBA or an FPS and it shouldn't, IMO Blizzard trying so hard to make the game into an E-sport has killed class identity and done a lot of damage to the damage. The best way to make this game more competitive and require actual skill would be matchmaking BGs so that both teams have the same classes, gear and consumables and that would be fucking horrible.
---
Not a moment goes by in Gadgetzan where there isn't some smart ass sitting on a roof dotting people up or casting Blizzard on opposite faction players, safe from the guards.  Unless Blizzard actually clamp down on it we will continue to see this behaviour as we have always done.
---
Actually I think if Blizzard clamp down on it we will still see it, if players can get up there they will do it. It's like the WSG wall hopping flag exploits, people will continue to do it until it's prevented.

Oh yeah, sorry, I'm just kidding, this is what I'm actually like:

There exist people who became millionaires from selling wow gold.  Notably Brock pierce.  Who is now a billionaire.

Praise be to the rightful heirs of Lordaeron.

Except the engine doesn't allow it because the guards can't function properly on the rooftops. It's a terrain exploit and it's been against the rules since 2005.
---
It’s a lot of cash right now because there’s not a lot of gold in circulation. All the gold farmers need to generate their wealth themselves from the game system. Shit takes time even for these turds.

I’m on MacBook and having the same issue.. this thread worries me. Is it just a matter of updating or is the gpu really dying?

i gunned it to 37, i hit 37 i think my friday afternoon, so 4 days after release and just b-lined it to the badlands. got him in a few hours and am happy i did so!!
---
every birthday up to 21 is a small key to more freedom, 22 and on is just another nail in your coffin
---
I can't stress number 6 enough. Literally just did SM Armory and as soon as we zone in a dps ran in and pulled the first two mobs. After we kill them i say something along the lines of "let me(the tank) pull please". 
---
Very next pull after i grab and get aggro on the next couple mobs the Warlock runs around the corner and pulls a couple more. 
---
I wasn't dealing with it so I just kick him. He then proceeds to whisper me trying to get under my skin and about how I should be careful to never pull more than 2 mobs because i could die blah blah. 
---
Ok.. Cool.. So we found DPS to replace him and continued on with life. 
---
I'm not here to babysit the 12 year olds who came from retail and don't want to listen to anybody's directions.

Pets didn’t sell well in private servers, things have changed and players don’t value non combat pets as much as they once did

That’s what she said.

You know what? Another comment on here asked if you should post about it here if it's a good deed. Well I have a blue BoE polearm worth maybe 1G, but you just convinced me to find some warrior to give it to, along with 10s to train polearms.
---
Nice work.
---
Good ol Barrens Chat
---
He approves your hard work!
---
I got a hyacinth macaw for 25g that is now “ripening” in my bank
---
probably but not as pathetic as this post is.
---
You're much better off using your melee damage to supplement your spell damage, rather than relying on melee as your main source of damage. You can still delete a Mage with Windfury even when you have 0 talent points in Enhancement. On the other hand, you lose a ton of survivability and utility if you don't have at least 20 in Resto and 30 in Elemental.
---
Man, I never had that much of an issue. Maybe you are not prioritizing stuff, or macroing correctly? Get an amazing 2hander... Macro a Whirlwind+Weapon Swap for aggro? The issue is that you are worrying about their damage for aggro, and maybe you need to worry about your damage to match.
---
That’s true, but I choose to see it as time to get to 60 and farm gold and other required mats for it. And who knows, maybe I will find a raiding guild that will fit my shitty schedule after all!
---
That's what I meant. People are bringing queues as an argument that servers are still as populated as they were after launch, while it's not the case, coz Blizzard is actively shrinking the servers by reducnig layers.
---
I was duel wielding until a warrior 3 levels under me out dps'd me. I checked on how he was doing it,  and he simply spammed Furry strikes and Cleave. Although my single target dps was better than his,  he did more overall damage.
---
I switched to Arms 2h. Don't underestimate cleave/ strikes!
---
Classic is everything i hoped it would be!
---
Not much fun really. Fun starts around level 30 with poisons and stuns and openers. Before that you just run around hitting SS and evis.
---
Always thought tanking was hard but I've leveled a warrior this time around and basically not being an idiot and then you're fine
---
This would be a funny and good solution in Booty Bay/Gadgetzan. Just have a few guards that are called "enforcers" instead of bruisers, that have super-stealth, and just so happen to be in the big gank spots.

Or to skip specific mobs that you might pull which will also aggro the rest of the group -- a headache not needed if, in Mythic+, you know which packs you need or are already capped.

Builds are typically different depending on what type of content you are running (leveling, dungeons, raids, pvp, etc). Best place to look for builds imo is in shaman community discord - https://discord.gg/VvBwBu2

This was the same in Warcraft 3 too.
---
For the last time, IT IS NOT A BUG. That is how it was coded.
---
If it was a bug, it would have been fixed YEARS ago.
---
It's a little douche to grieve someone in this manner. It's a pvp server and he attacked you. The spit emote is a dbag move as well meant to set you off which it clearly did. 
---
You havent played wow if you havent been spit on, moo'd at ect.  If this gets you that worked up you're probably in for some angry moments.
---
They know players can do something about it. The issue is that the in town guard mechanic which is there to make it so if you initiate pvp in a city you also have to fight the guards, bugs out when the player is on a rooftop. Therefore using a rooftop to avoid the guards is a form of terrain exploit and has been against the tos since 2005
---
our guilds hit list has already hit the character limit for the guild information tab
---
Should have killed you
---
How does a rogue ganking you at low hp equate to someone punching you while your hands are tied?
---
This is honestly a pretty dirtbag move. Shame on you, dude.
---
Yes. That's the same issue with Booty Bay. There are a few places that guards are too far away to aggro to you, and people are getting banned for abusing it.
---
pussiest shit ive ever heard. 
---
you have a point in WSG - since its competitive, but out in the world? lame as fuck, just figure out how they are getting up there and do it yourself.
---
if they start banning people for this, god help us.. but since its blizzard i doubt they'll actually do anything.
---
p
---
But the guards cannot get on top of the building, so using the building with the intent of avoiding the guards is a terrain exploit to prevent the intended guard mechanic from functioning.
---
That’s exactly how it works, you sound a little precious here
---
Ya its grobbulus no one likes them because the said they were going to rule the server and other stuff.
---
That's probably because outside of higher keys, dungeons are a joke and the only way to have some level of challenge/fun is chain pulling everything. No reason not to when you can do it. Classic is the opposite of that.
---
Playing a paladin so far this is what I can estimate my time per level played at each lvl range
---
1-20 I averaged about 1-1.5 hrs per level
---
20-30 was about 2 hrs per level 
---
30-40 really started to slow down 3-4 hours per level easy with some at 4.5 because of getting ganked so much
---
40-50 still working on it but it seems like 4-5 hours is what I’m working with so far.
---
get 60 and get up there urself pussy, dont ban fun shit that has solutions through player interaction.
---
They can group you with some mages for added crit. So it's possible, yea.
---
*slaps roof*
---
This guild can fit so many MC raiders in it
---
Oh. I actually didn't know that. I just thought it was like any old terrain. Ty for informing me
---
bootlicker fun hating scum.
---
this is why retail turned into a pile of mongoloid dogshit, because people cant bother to figure out their own solutions to situations and scream for blizz intervention. 
---
coward
---
Gouge is still easily the best use of those talents even if you're 100% pve. Kiting and bandaging is plenty of reason to take it.
---
I mean, almost the entire city of ratchet has no guards that aggro. I can gank from almost every single store all the way down to the docks and to the flight master.
---
More like there are few places you can go, to aggro guards.. I think we need a clarification on this.
---
30 min hearth + at least 4-5 other travel items
---
The griefers we need
---
yeah, easily hotfixed by adding an extra spawn at those places. 
---
Also a minor PSA for classes with buffs that do damage on hit; remove that buff as you enter Booty bay or Gadgetzan. When you do damage as someone hit's you, the guards converge on you instead.
---
What did it drop off of?
---
Do you also have jump bound to every button skill and action?
---
"Fun"?
---
God why does *everything* had to have a progression system, a carrot for people to get, or else it's "pointless"?
---
I still remember battles I had in vanilla 15 years ago cause they were *awesome*. When did "fun" stop being a reason for things?
---
If the fantasy was having no gravity then yeah, no gravity would make sense lol.
---
In a more practical sense, it seems like all this time being eaten up could be resolved by just adding a few guards. 1 in Everlook, a few in Gadgetzan, a few in Booty Bay, then give Darkshire guards a ranged attack, and the whole issue is basically gone.
---
Way back in the day I did, pre-TBC.  I forget exactly what for too... probably a mount.
---
I felt so fucking dirty, way worse than when I buy drugs.
---
I don't remember how much I paid or how much I got.  All I remember was thinking the WoW police were going to arrest me at the mailbox.
---
Faster attacks means double the procs of frenzy.  That means Frenzy is active for a greater portion of the fight, which means you do more DPS.
---
Look at the size, the definition, the striation.
---
Mans gonna win Mr Azeroth 2019
---
word, i got neat plates but the distance on them sucks, i just want to change the names to a better font that works at the same range as the blizzard name works
---
Fuck You gary. I have enough savoury deviate delights to last me four lifetimes!
---
For speed leveling - get a ravager and make ravager cleave dungeon groups up to lvl 50ish. Healing some type of cleave group works as well.
---
For solo play .. typical enh build usually works best. In first 20 levels you'll learn to hate shaman totem quests :)
---
Why isnt there a massive list of bad party members that we can reference? One or two marks against you isnt bad, but anything over 15 or so is starting to look suspicious...
---
I'm convinced that DPS meters are what makes raids like this.  I can almost guaranfuckingtee the asshole DPS that keeps pulling aggro has a meter.  I mean man why can't you just wait literally 2 fucking seconds to DPS?  How come you pull aggro and CONTINUE to DPS while heals have to pump all their mana into you in order to keep you up?
---
&gt;There's now 10+ on my server because everyone is trying to unload them for 500+ gold
---
Dont forget that people see the volume so they're waiting for the price to crash harder before buying them up
---
If they're people your level, you're not fucking them over. You're engaging in world PvP, which they signed up for and *want* to happen. 
---
If they don't, they're on the wrong server.
---
Getting on top of the undercity only required jumping, but was against the rules as a terrain exploit. Getting under orgrimmar only required jumping, but was against the rules as a terrain exploit. Getting on top of a building with the intent of preventing a mechanic from functioning as designed is an exploit.
---
Wew Lad, If you needed evidence that someone wasn't playing MmO'S In 2005, here's your proof.
---
You know, every time this comes up, people rarely ask me things I can't answer. :)
---
That's correct
---
So this explains why tanking SM felt harder than usual.
---
Well although I disagree with the original sentiment, the response *was* a strawman, specifically claiming that the original sentiment was suggesting you spend "all your time" working on mental health. "All" was never said by the original commenter. In fact, the word he used was "more," so both the original AND the response were based on false premises, and the response is categorically a strawman.
---

Then I use Shift, Alt, Ctrl as modifiers. Keeps everything super close without having to really extend fingers. Gives you 24 Keys to work with, more if your keyboard has F1-F5 keys you could also remind to.
---
Yeah and let's be real, sweeping strikes whirlwind is way more damage over the long term than most other classes dps at this level. It's up like every 30s, right? I'd rather him take a bit more damage, gain a lot more rage, and just do more damage than me wanding some mobs non stop.
---
When they are interacting with others, I’m telling them how to play the game, sure.
---
no.. but as a new to horde-grobbulus member can you share?
---
4 times I've seen a horde hunter try tame it 4 times I've killed it and then the hunter
---
There's a post here from a rogue complaining about a 3 day ban for using buildings in BB to prevent guard aggro and ganking lowbies for an hour at a time. They're definitely policing it.
---
Yeah, mainly what I'm talking about is the super high levels running around and just poaching the lower levels for their enjoyment and camping low levels. I get that's "what I signed up for" but idk how people find that fun.
---
I'm not gonna say people have a right to exploit guard pathing, but I remember doing this and having this done to me very often in vanilla, especially in BB.  The GM's stance on it does make sense, but I had no idea it was actually punishable.  They obviously have a hard time enforcing it and there are even more opportunities for it in TBC and Wrath, what with flying and all.

Hey the only low level I killed was an AoE farming mage. Cuz fuck AoE farming mages.

I need this but for profession cooldowns

How is it a shit attitude?
---
I wiped on a rare spawn and ran back as quick as I could. When I got there it was just getting killed by someone else. I congratulated them and asked what it dropped. They opened a trade and handed me what turned out to be a substantial upgrade for me. 
---
Cheers to you random feral druid!
---
That area with the burnt down streest and the harpies is like a warzone
---
I get the same sometimes
---
yeah it's automation. just because you're not harming anybody (except maybe those in queues) doesn't make it any less so
---
You need to have bfa on your account to get this boost right? I created new account just to play classic so no bfa and I don't see any boost available.
---
People have 500+ gold already?
---
no point even discussing shit with bootlickers like you
---
a "problem" that can be solved through player interaction - "victims" getting up the "exploit point" themself and killing the attacker is what should be happening in these scenarios. 
---
sounds like your just another blizzard shiteating clown that will take anything they say as holy word, despite them being the same people that ruined retail. 
---
fucking pussy
---
That's unintentionally how I operate when I DPS. I tank a lot in retail and sometimes I accidentally forget that I'm a DPS who isn't setting the pace of the fight, but I'll instinctively pull what I know I could survive. Other times it'll be the whole pack and then I'll feel like a real dumbass.
---
Last night -- for reasons unrelated to wanting to pull, just casting and canceling to be derpy -- my rotation muscle-memory kicked in and I threw up Corruption after I canceled Immolate (I like to batch them together and then throw up Agony). It was only one mob, and as a warlock I could just play ball with the mob with Fear and Curse of Recklessness. It'd drain a lot of mana, but I would certainly not have died. The tank grabbed him anyway and I felt like a tard, but it was a good time.
---
I would recommend 5/5/5
---
Get the standard wand and spirit tap but also get healing focus (less chance to interrupt casted heals 70% with 2 points) and improved renew (15% increase with 3 talents) as the 5 points in holy greatly help dungeon / self healing.
---
I believe that will take you to lvl 24ish, at which point you can build off that base going down a selected tree or trying talents in each.
---
-cheers
---
Meters like details, Slade, or recount are addons that track stats in fights such as total damage, Dow, healing, threat, and other useful combat metrics. Use steam client to get addons for wow, just make sure you switch version from retail to classic when you are in the “mods” section.
---
It gets better then? As a low level lock it feels mostly useless.
---
They did, in later expansions.
---
I had a GM who took almost all of our guild funds to buy the assistant GM (who was married and had children) a mount in exchange for....ya know. And on top of that, the assistant GM kicked every other female in the guild. Some of these people are mental.
---
What if you kill the guards...
---
This is what I love about Classic. Enough drama in moments like this to create lifelong memories.
---
yes, windfury is better for pvp tho
---
didnt say u were u dogshit pussy mongoloid, ur cancerous "BLIZZARD PLZ DO SOMETHING ABOUT [fun possibility] is why retail turned into a heaping pile of boring garbage.
---
Won’t hurt to put it up for 1k buyout now. Someone might bite and you could easily triple or quadruple that gold by phase 2.
---
Really bad at photoshop so it took them an hour. OP tried to compare his pic of a real human laughing with some warcraft graphics on the side. The example post he linked is a screenshot of the actual game and he's wondering why his got removed.
---
So badass
---
Except you're kinda taking a leap of logic there. It's not like they designed it in a way that could be exploited intentionally, it was an oversight; the 'rules' are a product of the system's environment, and not all interactions are covered.
---
I think a good analogy would be the real world rule against killing others: there are is nothing physically stopping you from doing it, but have clear consequences for breaking that rule.
---
Well the thing is, this bug wasn't part of vanilla.
---
actually windfury is closer to rockbiter on slower weapons, rockbiter is a lot better on faster weapons.
---
As a priest I don't understand the life tap hate. I am normally telling my locks to do it. The only rule is my mana goes to the tank first so only do it when I have mana and the tank is not in combat with 5 mobs

Nice one.

Sunder doesn't even do damage and what's the point of reducing armor on quest mobs. He probably won't even have enough rage to land 2 sunders before mob dies.
---
I used to be an adventurer until I took a quiver to the knee...
---
sorry for the noob question but why did you not want to release?
---
Ezio still had to run from guards
---
Fps = Flight Paths
---
 not frames per second in this context =)
---
I offered too, i usually tank in runs but the tank insisted.
---
so, yeah.
---
But it's a vanilla wow rule you dolt
---
&gt;Standing in certain spots isn't disallowed
---
gm island?
---
Exploiting combat mechanics.
---
Both.  I have a shaman on one, and Alliance on the other.
---
Blizzard was banning for that in vanilla
---
&gt;While I'm sure this is a punishable offense
---
Np dude. Blizz doesn't have a problem with rooftop pvp as long as you aren't using it explicitly to avoid the guards.
---
Love the guy skinning mobs while fighting is going on. Seen that way too much so far that's classic experience :)
---
Mr thrall I don't feel so good
---
Have a look at classic twink builds and use those as reference
---
😂 btfo gankers
---
Yeah you wand pretty much the whole way up to 38, and from there it becomes much better.
---
If you go drain tanking you’ll also feel incredibly strong because you’ve essentially got 2 health bars haha.
---
Dive’s drain tanking guide is here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qdUs229_XvkR1NCeTrJkybL5BDXGIh7q/view

Hasn't been in the game for years
---
rofl no fun allowed huh
---
Bass
---
Get some fresh air once in awhile.
---
Hear hear
---
&gt; I don't wanna play as the baddies.
---
So then play Horde if you don't want to the baddies. On one of the pages that no longer exists on worldofwarcraft.com, many, many, many years ago, it was stated that Alliance were the bad guys, and horde were just trying to live their lives. They've since backtracked on that official stance, but this is classic, when that stance was held, thus it's true once again.
---
Do not even bother. This sub is filled with the very people you are talking about. They are shit at the game and think everyone that wants efficiency and trying to be as good as they can is an elitist asshole. 
---
They want to play the game as if they are still in their teens and barely understood what was going on. 
---
I play with 4 friends. A tank and 3 dps. And every now and then we get a slow as fuck healer. The kind that uses the inefficient heals and spams them and goes oom over nothing. After each pull stands around like a doofus for 20-30 seconds before drinking. And then diddles along behind us. Because he is "playing the game how it's meant to be".
---
I cant wait until more people hit 60 and we can rid ourselves if these weirdo chosen-to-be-a-noob people.
---
Now watch this get downvoted to hell for speaking the truth.
---
Heya, I swapped to D stance to disarm him :)
---
Get res’d
---
So when a tank bitches about something almost useless it's YES, SAY IT LOUDER FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE BACK!! But when a dps says "...it's really nbd" it's "WoW ThIs GuYs A BaDaSs oVeR hErE"
---
A lot of people have some really warped sense of the difficulty of these lower level dungeons.
---
Auctioneer for auction value, leatrix plus for vendor value
---
Damn dude I've been slacking hard I'm about to hit 43 at the same /played as you, have you just been laser questing? Or did you have a dungeon group to spam with
---
MS &gt; OS  
---
You do you. If they get mad, then they don't know about stat weighting.
---
Sometimes, its better to just let the stupid DPS die. It really is.
---
It doesnt work.
---
Yes because that sequence of jumping you did ahead of time, that you might have even failed a few times or took you a small amount of time is totally something someone else should have to do so they can have a "even" playing field. How about you actually get good at the game and don't have to exploit the game to feel good at the game?
---
Didn't even know wow still had GMs. Figured it was all automated AI.
---
I think the issues I have seen have to do with the tank being bad to begin with, and switching to 2h not helping.
---
What’s the reason to have it on?
---
Nope the time invested is better spent farming runecloth or gold to buy runecloth for a decent rep gain
---
Hahaha. Omg.
---
I'm not so sure how expensive they are so maybe that time is needed indeed! Hopefully you can, guilds that are big enough have alt character raids  that you might be able to jump into now and then, you never know. Plenty of time as we know anyway!

---
jumping through hoops to justify ur snitch ass mentality. stay pussy
---
well it is classic...
---
Or just make it so guards can get up there. Mobs constantly run and shoot through walls and glitch through the floor. Just give guards the same ability.
---
They hated Jesus because he told them the truth.
---
Okay sure. Maybe I picked the wrong example. Almost every other zone has the same dramatic/ immediate transition to its neighbor 
---
I’m not saying it bothers me, I’m just saying of all things don’t get hung up on retail having sharp borders because that’s always been how WoW zones are designed
---
It looks like a manta ray, sorta.
---
Lifetap and hellfire damage falls under "preexisting condition" and is not covered by your HMO.
---
Not my problem you think that. I still got my 2004 vanilla screenshots with same names as retail chars if you wanna play memories. 
---
Where you gonna refugee too? F2p Asian MMO's like KAL online, Knight Online, Helbreath? LMAO. Maybe EVE Online which is a completely different type of game?
---
Just wondering why that’s important.
---
I was not saying that he shouldn’t do that, or whether it’s right or wrong. I was saying that along with the tank fitting a negative stereotype, there was also a dps filling a negative stereotype. I was saying it as a joke and did not need you nerds to tell me I was wrong.
---
i bet u play 2 hrs on the weekend and have more opinions on the game than any actual good player. 
---
snitch
---
leave us alone
---
You were thinking 3/7 (but wrote it like 7:3) which is close to 40% so i understand but that hurt my brain a little haha!
---
I remember at least in Wotlk they existed in the capitals. I remember running around Org and finding stealthed trolls on the rooftops.
---
I agree and will do everything you say as long as you let me get mana.
---
Sometimes they do, or tweak guard behavior. I remember the Booty Bay guards were easy to avoid initially, but after a while Blizz caught on and gave them ranged weapons which knocked you off any ledge/roof/perch you were on.
---
Lmao, yes please keep thinking this way Alli’s.
---
I was having a sick battle with another rogue we were both level 42 and it was really tight but a warrior charged in at the last second and smoked me. I think the other rogue was equally as pissed as I was hahaha
---
So that Tauren in Stormwind the other day that was posted on Reddit, standing on top of the wagon next to the Auction House was breaking the rules....nice.
---
Wow, this tank sucks.  I apologize on behalf of all of us competent tanks.
---
Conversely, this ain’t retail and rage doesn’t grow on trees/ we miss more often.  It pisses me off to no end when dps thinks it’s ok to attack IMMEDIATELY and don’t follow marked order.  Threat is a whole different ballgame than what it has become in retail.
---
Knowing nothing about druids. You only burn MCP on raid bosses. Otherwise, keep a good stat stick (or more) around.
---
Man, you aint gonna like grinding classic dungeons at 60 for your gear, they are the definition of mindless grind. With m+ I can actually challenge myself, and pushing high keys is not  just adding ''twist'' lol.
---
Man, I hate to say this then but in context it sounds like this policy is just more laziness on their part.........
---
You say that like horde don't just run around in a pack killing people 4v1.  All day long brother.  Doesn't matter which side you're on.
---
apply windfury and right click the mobs
---
Use mana for utility 
---
otherwise use strongest shock
---
Found the retail player
---
The required level is 34 it’s item level is 39.  No this isn’t a major twink item although it’s value will rise over time if you hold onto it. It is a decent dagger but there are better ones for 39 thinks.
---
Yes, 3% is huge. This isn't a 3% damage increase, it's much higher than that. It's a third of your hitcap and also reduces the penalty of glancing blows.
---
300 weapon skill has 40% chance of getting glancing blows that reduce the damage of your swing by 35%.
---
305 weapon skill has 30% chance of getting glancing blows that reduce the damage of your swing by 15%.
---
Getting to the "soft" hitcap (aka 9%, as that makes sure that your yellow attacks, aka abilities, will never miss) is the first priority of all melee dps and hunters. Being able to go from 9% required to 6% is huge.
---
Key word there is should. Yes, you are correct. Mark your main kill target. Everyone else SHOULD only attack that target. Set a keybind macro to mark your main target with a 💀 and maybe add a /say to that saying "kill the skull"
---
It’s been a while, but I remember being dw fury for most of my time in Vanilla and competing for the top of the damage meters. Then again, my memory could be a mix of MC, BWL, AQ etc.
---
As long as you are just outside the aggro radius of guards you are good. The problem is when you abuse the pathfinding of the guards so they aggro onto you but can't get to you.

---
Since no one has given you the actual answer:  Wand auto-shoot invokes global cooldown.  If you are auto-casting shoot, it will go forever, and your first key press to cast a spell interrupts that process, triggering global cooldown, and then you can cast your spell.
---
Til playing WoW and doing litterally anything creative is an exploit

This. Water is expensive! What do i look like?? A mage?
---
!RemindMe 12 hours
---
I don't think painting a whole group of people who choose the opposite faction on a video game as sociopaths, is a very sane thing to do.
---
Well this is essentially how it feels being attacked by a rogue.
---
The best part about it is the the people that don't know why they didn't get heals are usually bad players.  Good players will know the tanks need more healing or that they shouldn't take aggro or the healer had their own aggro.
---
I'm wondering the same thing. People say you don't want arms in raids because of ms taking a debuff slot, but does it really matter? Sure it's not ideal but it's not going to prevent the raid going smoothly...
---
You have to feed it like maybe 3 pieces of food to recover the happiness from dying, the cost is extremely negligible.
---
Your priority is to alert the tank that you are oom. That way they don't charge into the next group before you have mana. Saving precious milliseconds is not a concern in this scenario.
---
It's even possible they were still in combat when they typed.
---
Exactly, you can't help and be an asset if you're not willing to be subordinate.
---
"Im smart and youll never figure out who I am while I take up space on the servers from others and dont wait my turn"  
---
Yeah but you have to live with yourself lol, the fact that you brag about not giving up your char name means youre at least aware your actions are wrong. How about when you arent actually using the game, you log off and let someone else play.
---
That would be the spite. It's on there.
---
Icy veins classic has guides for every class, links to leveling guides, profession guides. Highly recommended reading through that too. Discoed is a great source as well
---
Yeah people in 2005 are totally gonna refugee too Ultima Online. Give me a fucking break. Same with DAoC.
---
Fury is best for pve but ONLY if you are hit capped. Fury is absolutely trash for pvp. Just stick to arms if you want to pvp and pve and you’ll own at pvp and cut it in the middle of the pack for dps.
---
questing is good gold, you will have plenty for a mount either way, just dont buy anything on the AH
---
Wew Lad. I don't need to refugee because I'm not a naysayer, nor am I a whiner. 
---
Also, SWG Was twice the game WoW was on Launch, you can put that in your pipe and smoke it.
---
Wow imagine a shaman using that staff as enhance..crazy windfury
---
Polearms cost a gold to train.
---
What people need to realize is that you CAN PVP in contested cities as long as you don't get into aggro range of the guards. I've been sitting against the arena wall in Gadgetzan and killing lowbies once the guards pat by. People think it's an exploit, but it's just cleverly avoiding the guards as they walk around.
---
Your ducked, toss in the towel. If your server doesn’t read full most the time it’s dead or dying. RIP.
---
You guys are making me feel good about my ranking haha. I'm not the best one out there, but I at least make sure the healer isnt taking aggro.
---
What I’m saying is you don’t have to buy it, since I didn’t and still got the boost.
---
I'm surprised because this was commonly known in vanilla that the spot by the rogue in the inn had no guards near it.  Its not that the guards can't get to the person its just that there is no guard to attack them.  OP is getting attacked and not the other person because the other person probably has a higher reputation thus smaller aggro radius.
---

This was a common gank spot back then
---
This is why I never sell anything on my main
---
Geesh, that is slow friend.
---
Ranged attacks wont pull mobs but a pet will
---
I’m inclined to disagree as I don’t think increasing damage on your most output damage source is necessarily the optimal increase in overall damage. Most rogue guides say not to use SND until rank 2. 
---
That being said I’m open to being wrong and doing some more research, I’ll check it out tonight to see what’s up.

Here is chicagotribune [article](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-met-hacker-zachary-buchta-sentenced-20180327-story.html) about one LS member's arrest, guilty, and jail sentence.
---
He was a crying squealing lil B and turned in AT LEAST 2 other members of Lizard Squad to authorities according to the article.  
---
&gt;"Prosecutors had asked for a term of 2 1/2 years, citing Buchta’s cooperation with authorities that led to the arrests of at least two of his former associates."
---
I mean, the other option is to invisible wall those areas, which will piss off the purists and goes against their policy of making no changes for better or worse. This was the rule back in 1.12, this is the same rule now.
---
Is it considered as an exploit atm?
---
Is it worth reporting those players ? Or is it like greykilling, griefing and camping...  part of the pvp system?
---
Typical of someone who is third in the recount meter. Why is it that all the scrubs took for stuff they don’t need
---
Yeah except for the part where everyone is 30% stronger by default.
---
Thank you. As a fellow tank, this basically sums up all the reasons I don’t want to do it. So much retail mentality from dps it can be very frustrating.
---
Indeed. Classic wow, especially in 5 mans, is about control, not big sexy dps numbers.
---
A good paladin is very strong vs a mage.
---
Yea, most priests get Focused Casting regardless of their spec, so it's probably hard to test lol.
---
"I don't think increasing your damage on your most output damage source is optimal."
---
Sorry, what? What is the logic here lol?
---
Alright, you wanna make loot from 10 hours in Wow, sure, weird but you do you, I'd watch.
---
You have a few issues if you want people to keep watching.
---
You had so much dead air showing you just killing turtles. It's not actually fun to watch, especially without commentary. No one actually cares about seeing you kill the turtles, it should only serve as background for your commentary.
---
Also, you just scrolling through your mail, not taking it, just looking at the prices you've already shown us when you posted things was frustrating. Just press open all already god damn.
---
RemindMe!
---
Safe spotting is an exploit, see this post. Using building geometry to avoid guard aggro = exploit
---
I avoid grouping with people like this ^^^^^
---
There's a mage on my server that did this for years with zero repercussions.  
---
Screenshots or not, they never did anything about it.
---
And don't forget Fordprefect.
---
Lol most leveling greens on the casters was wrath gear, that ain't nothing like of the monkey gear.
---
That's gonna be a kek from me dawg
---
Such is life as a paladin, second slowest levelers next to warriors and really not much faster than them tbh.
---
Yup. Or Hunter goes into full on "I'ma kite this guy" while jumping waay from you and aggroing more mobs while doing so.
---

It may have been known as a good gank spot, but its been terrain exploiting since 2005

That’s just not true. Did plenty of raids in Vanilla with maybe one piece of pre-raid bis.

Non-Paladin healers heal multiple targets more efficiently than single targets. So a damaged warlock is a healing efficiency opportunity.
---
That isn't guaranteed. Right now it's smarter to play SM/Ruin for example.
---
When you looted greens and some blues they always had "of the bear" or some animal on them which was base stats.
---
Of the bear = 12 Strength, 12 Stamina
---
In 2006 they added new suffix like Wrath and Healing so now you can loot green items "of Wrath" which add like 40 frost damage. It's very OP.
---
Because its fund and fast and allows versatility, like if someone needs a mage as a stand in or something. Also, its fun to grind and gear up, and once I get my prebis ill probably make a mage al myself for cloth farming.
---
30 times jesus? For 1 /spit? Probably a teenager.

---
Love and waffles!
---
Well if you’re on the horde side, those slow 2 handlers you use as arms will benefit greatly from windfury, substantially so.
---
It's okay I tell my healers to not top me off for no reasons. Most only renew me when they got mana to spare.
---
In classic it's better to keep allies alive rather than top everyone in the party to 100%. That and warlocks got Regen on their armor buff, spirit Regen and the life tap. However the life tap doesn't heal that much and is not that mana efficient and just makes you lifetap even more.

Imagine being this mad you can't be an absolute bitch to other players anymore. Just sad.

Damn sells for a 1g25s a piece on my server, I made sure my build had some then I made BANK
---
Well, I agree with you there. I would go further and claim that our entire education system is one big cult, and recitation system literally programming people with various beliefs. 
---
As an example, I’ll give you a factually correct position, yet taught via pure indoctrination.
---
The Earth is round, do you agree? Yet how many people actually _know_ the Earth is round, via an actual understand of various models and the evidence supporting or contradictory said models?
---
Nearly everyone that purports the Earth is round does so from the same position as those that purport the Earth is flat; namely, a position of ignorance.
---
The population at large cannot deduce that the Earth is round. They merely recite what has been told to them, all the while ridiculing those that recite a different set of information. Their confidence that their recitation is correct ultimately stems from an appeal to authority.
---
If these authorities said that the Earth was flat, the population at large would say with fervor that the Earth was flat.
---
If someone came along and deduced a round Earth before their very eyes, they would, with pure confidence, declare that you were wrong.
---
Why? Their recitation would begin, and such a phrasing of words, arranged in specific order as ordained by none other than ‘the ultimate authorities’ themselves, would obviously surpass any and all alternative phrasing of words a mere pleb could bring to the table; therefore, when the phrase of words as recited are invoked, there is absolutely no hope for those that walk down the deductive path...  
---
unless those that walk down the deductive path were able to surmount any and all _authorities_ yet still to exist above them. 
---
This is exactly what seems to have happened in the era known as _the Enlightenment._ Yet who can say for certain that their levels of honesty are of the sufficient quantity needed in order to maintain the necessary levels of faith held by the general public in order to maintain this _era of reasoning?_
---
The greatest irony of all is that since the general public does not possess the means to verify their honesty, maintaining faith that they are, in fact, honest is an utterly futile act that can only be achieved via deceit, for if those you are trying to convince cannot, in effect verify anything that has been said, the only remaining option is to convince these people of your honesty via entirely dishonest means.
---
The greatest irony of all, addendum, is that even if you are absolutely honest, instilling the general faith of such honesty is utterly impossible without the application of dishonest means, and even if you were, aside from these means, absolutely honest, once the general public is made aware of these dishonest methods, the general faith establishing your honesty shall instantly evaporate.
---
As such, since public distrust of science will only ever continue to grow, barring constant indoctrination of the masses (even then, there is no guarantee), one is left with the reasonable conclusion that being honest _with respect to one’s work_ is simply an illogical move.
---
If indoctrination fails, and even if you were absolutely honest, the public will perceive pure dishonesty with respect to your work. Therefore, being dishonest at any and all times such that it will benefit you or your work is the only logical move. 
---
If indoctrination succeeds, it won’t matter how dishonest you were, for the people will believe you to be entirely virtuous and entirely honest.
---
My ‘ramblings’ are on full display within science today, as public distrust of science manifests, we also see public faith of science made manifest, with various peoples believing something as absolute merely because it has _the label of science._
---
Barring those of sufficient integrity, the field of science is rife with corruption stemming from individual scientists being dishonest as tailored to their specific needs, via reasons explained above.
---
The current societal conditions set very little risks for those of a dishonest nature, all the while providing lucrative gains. As evidence for my claims, I’m sure you have seen the various scientific articles and studied purporting that over half of all peer reviewed submissions are false _despite being asserted as fact._
---
This can only arise via scientists being dishonest with either their methods, their data, or both.
---
Of course there are bots.
---
&gt;The biggest thing user's underestimate is the effect gold buying had on "hacking" of people's accounts - that's where all the gold came from, gold farming was a myth past Vanilla, a side endeavor compared to stealing from players.
---
This is exactly what I had assumed was the case... very eye opening (though not surprising, I suppose) to be made aware otherwise.
---
Lol rogues can just vanish after aggroing guards? this gunna get banned too?
---
I'm levelling with daggers. Remorseless attacks, improved ambush and stealth speed upgrades from talents and it's fine. Ambush has 85%+ crit chance and deletes between 40-70% of a mobs health instantly.
---
     
---
Combat swords is a much more consistent way to level though.

That's great... let's report some assholes.
---
Thanks for the explanation (this was not the way I first jnderstood the post).
---
Get good
---
Staves usually have really good top-end damage and a slow swing speed which matter more than str/agi/stam. If a warrior or shaman is down on his luck for weapon drops, its gonna get rolled on.
---
It's less likely to happen as you level up, but a staff can fill the gaps.
---
What is that? Why is this good? I’m genuinely curious
---
That's fucking embarrassing.
---
For them obviously.
---
Love seeing this. You can tell he genuinely wanted to trash talk others and acts all chad and yet the only person to fail it
---
In Wrath or so they separated twinks from everyone else. In believe they added xp to BGs and you had to speak to an NPC to freeze your xp to prevent leveling up. This separated the two queues of normal players and twinks. Twinks faced hour+ queues and was pretty much DoA because of that.

It would be inappropriate to detail what happened to another employee, but the issue highlighted that these items needed to be removed from the database - they were greatly unnecessary with the tools available to developers and QA.

Knowing what happened, it very much looked like an honest mistake to me.  Once I figured out what was going on, I didn't spend much time on deciphering employee intent, that wasn't my main job.

Yep, that one.

He even teaches you fishing for free. All my characters would learn fishing there back in the days. I was hoping he'd get some appearance in Cataclysm, but they just removed him from the game.
---
This is bis for mages and has a less than 1% drop rate. I'd definitely consider this ninja'ing and would have called him on it.
---
Hey I was just doing that yesterday
---
Exactly. People should just see getting camped by a higher level as a chance to get a PvP group going. You don't have to be leveling constantly and PvP is the point of being on a PvP server.
---
So this started out with 4 or 5 of us from my Guild, just killing whoever we came across, and an hour or so later and it ended being around a 40v40 fight with people on both sides from level 30-60. I started playing WoW for the first time about a week ago, and this was my first PvP experience (not counting getting 1-shot by people 10 levels higher than me while I was trying to quest) and it was lots of fun. Can't wait to get back on the grind once I'm on the east coast.
---
just organized, its shadow frames
---
You need to watch better players than yourself pvp and duel as a mage so you can see why the experiences you're having are because of you and not the class.
---
I absolutely mean no offense by this.  I was the same back in the day on my first class.  Once I learned a lot more and practiced more and also realized consumables are king in world pvp / bgs.  I won against every matchup by outskill except a few players who were even in skill and then it was 50/50.
---
Watch good pvp mage videos, learn more about pvp in general and certain items/consumes, practice more.
---
RateMyTank.com, here it comes

Lmfao bro I am crying 😂

Cool theory

I honestly just want the tank to pull, stun things and let me AOE kite lol.

You can't prove there has been any.  Lack of evidence of bam does not mean that's evidence that they haven't.
---
A friend who was questing called me up to help them because they were being corpse camped.. I showed up to see about 20 people who were skulls for me (I'm level 42) standing around waiting. Naturally I couldn't help, and he was stuck there for the next 2 hours :(
---
well thats just dumb on a PVP server, if anything it should be a -1 on their priority.
---
Never heard of it till now
---
What was it like to meet God?

Wrote comment when tired, I meant backstep. Fixed it.

deliberately hurt, annoy, or offend.

This is the literal definition of spite. What you have described is an action of spite.
---
Fair playing field on a game where you call kill and camp greys all day long. Yeah that's fair.🤣
---
I tried what he was doing and was immediately shot off the bow, then chased in the water and killed..
---
Even your reddit name sucks ass.
---
Swords are way better because you can just make a weapon swap macro after using ambush.
---
Except mages
---
Pretty sure mages are one of the best pvp classes if not the best class all around. Skilled mages can defeat pretty much anyone 1v1. Hunters can tear you up fast though if you’re not doing it right. Going with everyone else here and recommend watching videos for tips and practice.
---
Its funny how you can tell who has their camera at the default zoom level, they have no awareness of whats behind them.
---
I wanted one as a pet and grinded the Crimson Whelps for 3 levels (around 1000 mobs), no drop. Then I checked AH and bought one for 6g... 6g!?
---
It dropped in elwynn too, what are the odds!1
---
Oh yeah man easily. I recommend going dagger/shield and doing flame tongue now and whenever I’m in a dungeon and we pull like 1 mob only I’ll just auto and regen mana. Ele shines in 3+ mobs though because our totems hit all enemies. Lightning bolt is also a decently good single target spell. I find myself usually topping charts in dungeons unless a mage is casting blizzard on like 5+ mobs. Just being water tho cuz our mana efficiency sucks big balls
---
It's part of an Ashenvale quest (alliance only maybe), but I suppose one could miss it, especially going the other way as horde etc.
---
Also in that 15 seconds, the tank could've ran like 100 meters forward and around corners... Especially if it was a place like ZF.
---
Pretty sure he can’t zone in if he’s level 1. Otherwise get a warlock and one other friend and summon him to the water behind princess.
---
Ty didn't know this. That makes sense
---
what makes them good?

The aggro range for guards is pathetic in most neutral towns. I can kill someone learning spells at the Druid trainer in Moonglade without catching aggro from any of the guards, no terrain exploitation needed. And even if I \*do\* catch aggro, the guards are so weak that I can tank a few of them for as long as it takes me to kill a lowbie, then run away.
---
Safe to say you can still kill people in most neutral towns without breaking any rules.
---
Troll health regen provides a bit of aoe threat generation.
---
Don't level resto. Bad idea.
---
Early levels should go enhance then upper 30s or 50 you can do ele pretty well.
---
It's my favorite zone
---
No, he means killing the SAME toon three times in a row. Not three toons of the same level.
---
I usually only invite hunters if I really need something with hunter capabilities (which is rare as a warlock or rogue gives me the kind of skillset I need) or if there is just nobody else to take. Which is also rare.
---
Average at best.
---
A lvl 1 rogue wouldn't avoid shit in there just as an aside.

Not everyone

How do they treat usernames during server merges? For example I'm on heartseeker but I didnt get my username on any other server besides stalagg. If heartseeker merged with another low pop server who would get my username, me or the other guy from the other server?

How's Barrens chat in RP servers?
---
im just disappointed that he didnt spazz out on stream as promisedB
---
the not flying is a small portion of it, i've written about this a bit before, but i think it's a double-edged sword effect that classic WoW has
---
a large area packed with many things doesn't feel large, it feels just big enough for you to mentally be aware of,  idk, the nearest 7-or-so things around you. points of interest on a map, when they're everywhere, become less defined by regions like elwynn or barrens, and more by groups of points of interest
---
this feels small, or at least compact. classic wow feels big because there's a shitload of the map that has nothing of any interest in it. basically, deserts feel big, and are inherently barren and uninteresting.
---
you can either have **content** or **the feeling of a large area** but not both. clearly over the years the playerbase asked for more things to do, more world to explore. oh, we got it all right. we got it in droves. we begged for it so much we're now sick of it. (at least some people are. obviously some aren't)
---
what you're feeling is the same problem that procedurally generated games have. creating an infinite amount of content is easy. creating an infinite amount of **consistently interesting** content is hard as fuck. you either fill a large area with a buncha stuff and make it feel busy, fill it sparsely and make it feel big but void and kinda boring, **or** do your best to strike a balance between them and accept that you can't give both groups what they want.
---
This applies to more than software.
---
Even if it turned out this wasn't against the rules, someone wouldn't get fired over a single miscommunication.
---
That’s a great drop easily on. When you get some linen or wool make sure to save it and ask around for a tailor to make you a bag. Linen is 6 a lot bags, wool is 8 slots. I think it’s 6 linen per bad and 9 wool per bag. Something like that. 
---
Enjoy!
---
With layering it's impossible to control the market. I remember arriving at Winterspring rather early and the pattern was not there. I asked for layer inv from a guldie and bought it easily.
---
On Rogues, you gotta get the one with the dead eyes so when you have a mask your eyes are just black. Super edgy. But casters with the tongue waggle are top notch.
---
Dude this stuff happens in video games.  Gunna have to get over it
---
That turned out to be fake news :( i also got into classic because of that boost. I dont care now because im having way too much fun in classic but yeah no reward for reaching 60.
---
What sucks is a lot of mainstream media also fell to this (i think it originated in a brazilian facebook fan page) so i lost a lot of trust for multiple magazines. But it was my bad too for not properly checking sources, i also got a bunch of friends into the game with that advertisment so i feel double bad.
---
I wouldn't go so far as to say the Peter Principle universally applied, but it is always a risk.

I have a feeling he means that most of his quests are complete and he’s probably about to turn those quests in?

I think you overestimate how much people want to group up for pvp in some situations. I got camped in tanaris for like 3 hours today and not a soul helped me.
---
Doesn’t matter what type of server your on. If your circumventing mobs put in place to limit this type of behaviour in ways not supplied by blizzard just to grief other players, your dumb.
---
I was in the same boat a week ago. I decided to level 39-40 on basilisks in the shimmering flats (south-east). They drop a ton of good vendor trash. It took me about 6 hours to complete the level and I made 24g doing it, just enough for my mount and training (had 67g before the grind).
---
There is no grind like the osrs grind.
---
Let me explain -  
---
   
---
So say you use your combo points on slice and dice. You get 20% more dmg from white moves, that’s that, simple. Take what you do most damage with and do even more.   
---
But - maybe the same combo point eviscerate will increase your overall damage for the battle more. It seems like frequently, the battle is over too quickly while leveling to get the full effect of slice and dice.  
---
Or maybe rupture/expose armor might help you do more damage in the same amount of time against an armored foe than improved attack speed would.  
---
The point is, just because slice and dice increases the rate at which you do the majority of your damage doesn’t necessarily increase your overall damage or effectiveness in any given battle more than another move might.   
---
The reason rank 2 slice and dice is popular is because a) it increases your attack sped by 30% over 20%, and b) battles at that level and onwards last longer and you can achieve the full effect. 
---
Still, gonna do some more research tonight for a more comprehensive look.
---
Whoa, Caydiem, there's a name I haven't heard in a really long time.
---
[https://youtu.be/TWNQnQFj4Jc?t=29](https://youtu.be/TWNQnQFj4Jc?t=29) I linked to where he talks about the quest to get to this chest, it contains a 14 slot bag
---
I don't know about you guys, but I think it feels stiflingly small. I think it has to do with the super short view distance/fog. It feels like I'm running around blind. In vanilla you could see so much further and for the life of me, I can't figure out how to increase it to vanilla-levels kind of distance. Even with everything maxed out, it's as short as the screenshot above. Really kills the immersion and view around mountains and plains.
---
I’ll just add, I’ve had more horde players help me on my whirlwind axe quest than alliance players.
---
Time for a 360 face palm
---
Well none of you conspiracy theories have happened either yet you are trusting this gut feeling on some crazy narrative.
---
Look who actually gives a fuck? Blizz will ban you when you break rules. Thats how it has always been. If you think blizz cant or wont aquire the means to bans these people in their own game. Then how in the fuck did they catch the ddoser????? 
---
This is not logic friend.
---
You HOPE they do, even if they do it will probably be dead for quite some time before it happens.
---
Why do people think free kill when opening on you would put them on the threat table too?
---
This, every single time i charge in the first thing i see the hunter in the group do is multishot. And that goes for 90% of the hunters.
---
Once I tame a pet with Prowl, is that ability now available to any cat I could train? Or only other cats that also have the Prowl ability?
---
Before I drink, I Life Tap to about 1/2, because eating is currently faster than drinking because I haven't gotten loads of Stamina yet. I can get full faster that way. 
---
Just don't heal Life Taps. If the Warlock isn't being actively attacked, let him deal with his own health. We have lots of ways to take care of it.
---
I'm so sorry my dude. 
---
i found out that my gf of three months cheated on me because she told me that she's 7 weeks pregnant six days ago, and i haven't been with her yet. 
---
grinding scarlet monastery and questing and pvping in stranglethorn kept me going and stopped me from thinking about it too hard. 
---
i understand your pain and it's not easy but good riddance i say she clearly doesn't deserve you.
---
It does increase the worth by 10 silver per stack after all. Making 40 bandages doesnt take a lot of time. Can be done afk and gives you a net bonus of 40 silver.
---
Makes more sense, but backstab can be useful too in conjunction with gouge and a 5 combo kidney shot can get you 2 backstage.  This way of killing mobs isnt as fast but guys more survivability mob to mob.
---
It gets annoying when you wait 10 seconds before you pull and the healer still hasn't sat down tho, there is being patient and then there's wasting lots of time, atleast in classic it's not as bad as in retail m+ where time matters a lot.
---
Why would they make seperate servers for tbc and such? I never understand when I see this. Surely people will eventually stop playing if it’s all the same stuff just how it is now with no new content in a year. Or will they not?
---
Deviate nodes seldom fish themselves.  I mean basically only after a few eaten, then my bears paws can touch anything but themselves.  Wait.
---
I knew I smelled something
---
Shamans aren't a high dps class like mages &amp; warriors &amp; rogues. This is a well known fact. But yeah you're right, he's the scrub.
---
Yeah, it's something I feel very comfortable preaching because Blizzard did their best to educate users on the negative effects of gold buying with emails and web pages.  Whenever we took gold from someone we made it very clear we were giving it back to someone who had their account compromised.
---
There are excessive grinds, sure. But most of them are pretty short and done during normal play. I don’t think a long time to max really counts, since that is the main aspect of gameplay.
---
Nah fuck you. In a year I expect to maybe graze onto AQ40 not BC.
---
Lol, good luck trying to make every single zone relevant forever.
---
So instead of finding solutions to exploits they just punish people for a 12 year old issue?
---
Idk how anyone doesn’t 1) have bagnon and 2) hit the clean up bags button every time they open them.

It's quite situational. Generally you are going to want to do strength of earth, because the of the way the game is played. Generally you pull very few mobs at a time, kill them and repeat. Single target bossfight is a no brainer, since it's your group of 5 against one. That being said, I think stoneskin goes a bit underappreciated. I think most shamans end up using strength of earth due to that's what other players want. 
---
You can always do some quick maths. Say your stoneskin prevents 22 dmg on each hit. 5 enemies hit an average of 10 times 1100 damage prevented. Which is equivalent to one extra rank 8 healing wave. Generally for the melee classes you get 2 attack power per 1 strength. Strength of earth rank 4 gives 61. That's 122 attack power. 1 damage for 14 attack power. Gives 8-9 dmg per second i believe. Should be halved for rogues and hunters (relies more on agility) and your typical casters.
---
I don't know where the line in the sand is. I'd love to know how much DPS your average dungeon mob does since then we could do a simple dmg prevented vs dmg done. However there are some things shamans can keep in mind. I'll list a few things on the top of my mind and I think you know yourself why you should keep these thing in mind. Group composition (https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-stats-and-attributes-overview), do we have a lot of melee's and do their class benefit from totem? How many mobs are we pulling and are they melee's us AND how fast is **their** swingtimer? Is the healer struggling. The group objective/focus, do we need to kill something quickly? Does the group need time to think in fights? What kind of dmg is being done by enemy (magical won't be stopped by stoneskin).
---
I just realized that I am not sure if stoneskin prevents dmg each time the enemy hits you. I always just assumed this. Will have to investigate.
---
&gt;with a group of 3-4 friends.
---
Is a lot different than pugging.
---
The problem is exactly that there IS a change and the ability does not work the way it worked in vanilla, how retarded do you need to be to blame lack of changes for that

Retail is a series of lobbies for minigames
---
He isn't entirely correct. Skill results in more kills than average. If you win 55% of your fights you'll hit higher ranks faster.
---
Of course r14 is an entirely different story but this was pre-Arena.
---
I'm not saying to overlap slice and dice. I spend the first combo point I get on it, then build up to evis. After the first evis (if the mob is still up) I'll refresh SnD with one or two points.
---
You just need to keep it up, not waste 5 points. If you don't you're leaving damage on the table.
---
NO CHANGES

So much hate on this post... the guy is chill questing from the couch, sound pretty relaxing to me.

Once you are in a little gea rat 60, and your team is competent, you can dps and heal at the same time, just be smart and dont go all out frost shocking people
---
I forgot how awesome and menacing Andorhal is.  You can't walk anywhere in there without *something* being aggroed to you.  It's just so damn dense with mobs.
---
Oh yes.  And who's keyboard turning.  =P
---
Well, if you want the classic experience, this is it.   In TBC, they implemented the solution of flying for those areas as well as giving guards ranged attacks that knock back.  I suppose they could have done that sooner for old world guards.
---
No. Keeping an eye on your totems was a big thing i classic. It wasn't until a later expansion that they added Totemic Recall.
---
Many a time will a leftover totem agro a pat that your group thought they had skipped. Just yesterday I was running away from a surprise pat, spamming my totems too keep them with me instead of left behind to agro the pat.
---
Thanks for the advice, definitely will do this!
---
No wonder I can’t kill a priest even with rage potion + recklessness
---
When I go to desolace , I often fly to stonetalon peak just to run down through there to assist alliance , and cause havoc lol
---
Top of totem only ironman
---
Does stoneskin totem prevent &lt;x&gt; damage on each enemy hit? Meaning that it's effectiveness is higher against enemies with faster swing timer generally? I always just assumed this, but reading the spell description it is not so clear.
---
Now we know.
---
It was all reversed psychology bliz is actually genius. They planned it and hyped it that way .
---
Keep your feet on the ground!

Obviously not everyone just like not everyone on alliance does.  Good catch though.
---
Nah bro. They can run back.
---
kill all horde. They will only act nice when they think they cant win.
---
Yes its called safe spotting and if you do it you are a dick
---
Hey that's super awesome!
---
I mean, at least on my server runecloth goes for less than 1.5g/stack, so 450 stacks is only 675g, epic mount then being 900g for a total of a little over 1.5k total. 
---
I’ve earned nearly 2k myself so far (2x gather profs &amp; play far too much, and having been able to afford my epic mount 1 hr after dinging 60) so it’s not so much fishy as it is nerdy :)
---
I always tell them to tap more. Warlocks tap like 1/4 of their hp but are scared because I dont heal them. And I'm like tap more, if you tap do it throughout. My heal heals 70% of your hp so tap down to below 50%
---
I mean if done right drinking after every pull can be efficient, as long as there is a correct understanding of what to do while the healer drinks, you give the healer the chance to sit down, let them get to about 40% mana, then pull and let your defensives carry the weight untill the healer is full mana. That goes for both classic and retail.
---
You've waited 40 lvls and not submitted a ticket?
---
If your phase shift IS bugged out it could be locked out ("spell isn't ready yet") because of either localized data on your client or a bad server state of your imp's status.  Whenever it bugged out at lvl 12 you haven't resolved the data... A GM can easily do this just go through a ticket process.
---
Before all that a probably obvious thing you've already done but just in case not... try right clicking it on his bar instead of left click this would set it to auto cast where he will enter this state automatically maybe your manual casting isn't working but autocast does.  If you've tried that (I hope so in 40 lvls) then submit a ticket.  Reddit can't fix ingame bugs.
---
then just dont say it 4HEEEEEAD LOL
---
As a priest, your CCs do nothing :)
---
I'll just put this over here...with the rest of the fire.
---
Yup, that's exactly how it works.
---
Yeah we all love getting carried to completed quests that are 3+ levels higher than us.
---
If playing vanilla, tbc and wotlk before an almost decade long break before coming back to classic makes me the retail player you are hunting for... you found me!  I give up!
---
Questie new updaye made it look better
---
It also works better now
---
faerie fire can be applied by a resto druid, which you will most likely have anyways for a brez and innervate, so the bear tank wont be adding anything to the group  
---
Best use of a bear tank is as an OT so they dont compete with MT for gear, and even thats situational at best
---
2 have them have no idea wtf they're doing. I'd rather pug if the goal was to do the content easier. They're bad lol. But I love them and I'd rather enjoy the game with them
---
They are the Hinterlands Elite quests. Fairly difficult and grindy.
---
thanks!
---
How often is the respawn? Will you use that pet forever? Hunter seems really cool
---
No, the *fleeing mob* is what pulls the enemies. Fleeing mobs bring back friends whether there is a pet behind them or not.
---
Having a pet on a fleeing mob makes it better, because it means the hunter is putting full DPS on the mob to kill it before it gets to its buddies.
---
That I do know, but didn't know you could change it like that.
---
If you want him, come and claim him!

---
But I dont have first aid... Druid has a disadvantage.
---
Lmfao he's an interesting lad that guy
---
Right. Yeah I’ve definitely messed around with it, I realized as well after a bit that the most efficient path was to only use 1 or mayyyybe 2 points on it. I feel similarly with rupture and expose armor actually, the average mob just doesn’t need anymore or it’s a waste of combo points.  
---
Anyways, I still think that many mobs are dead before one combo points worth of SND time is up. And even if it is used most efficiently, I’m still curious as to the overall damage output compared to other moves. The discrepancies between fighting different mobs are also intriguing, beyond evis vs. rupture or what not.
---
Lvl 33 here. 1 to 20 was super fast. 20 to 30 sucked balls and 30 to where i am now is just *ok*. However, ill say that on the pvp side after i hit 30 ive been balls to the wall killin everyone in sight, even other rogues. 2v1 hunter warrior pair gets decimated, lvl 40 mage melted. Even warlocks. Priests always escape me tho. Guess ive been fighting bad players but damn its good. Stay away from my mobs!

Yep that’s some b00mer quality shitposting. Like a toddler out it all together in ms paint.

I discovered something sort of like this recently. I was roaming around the Badlands, specifically keeping an eagle eye out for Broken Tooth. In the process I saw what looked to be a tomb up on some hills, and near some quest givers too. I thought it was strange and had a look. It was empty, but still creepy for its decor, especially the throned skeleton. As far as I know this place (and a few others like it) don't figure into any quests, it's just there as neat exploration.
---
This is so genius.
---
I remember someone with an addon that said oom when he was below a certain amount of mana. It first became apparrent when he said oom after dying. Then when he said oom directly after resurrection.
---
I JUST now started doing that, glad there's others that think the same.. Plus by the time I need them I've forgotten about how much I spent on ammo. Good tip, just make sure not to do it right before a transition period (new arrows at 25, 40, etc.).
---
The best part is when you give everyone fortify because buffs are falling off and while you’re sitting down the tank pulls five groups.
---
Hey man, I just made a big move as well for work, from Illinois to Michigan. I hope everything goes well for you, and glad to see you had a fun battle tonight. Good luck with everything.
---
It depends on your group comp and the tank's ability.  Druid tanks can aoe tank better in general right now.  
---
If no mages hellfire is basically suicidal.  If no mage, CoA 2 to 3 targets.  Corr skull and maybe X.  Spam shadow bolts.  When too low for another shadow bolt to get off, Searing Pain.  Shadowburn to finish.  This produces the most dps.  Its mana heavy but just drink like everyone else.
---
With a good tank AND a mage in party.  Corr on skull and maybe X.  Maybe a CoA on a secondary or tertiary target.   
---
 You will need to wait for the nova, position max distance away (hellfire has a huge range actually) and sac void then hellfire.  If you have priest hopefully priest bubbles you before sac shield is gone.  Youll have to drain soul at the end of every encounter.  But this will produce the dps.

Don’t worry fam. I innervated you then swapped back to bear. We can go again. Like viagra.

Laziness how?  If anything, it's the more labor intensive solution than making guards have a ranged ability.  But, it's the classic experience!

Sry man, nothing you say is gonna save you from your own Reddit name.

---
He teleported me out. I managed to instantly trap myself in another place and he teleported me out again.

A thousand times this. If you think whichever faction you chose is meaningfully different from the other one when it comes to ganking the other side, you're clueless.

First aid can be learned on every class. It is useful on shaman it is useful on druid.
---
We did the latter half of WC with only 4 when another shammy dropped after accusing me of needing on fang gear that I already had, when it was my first time running the instance and it was actually a third shaman in the group wearing the gear. We both tried explaining the mistake to him but he wouldn't have it; he dropped group and the run was smooth from that point on. Some people freak out so much over gear that's replaced in a few levels it's silly.
---
Ahh yes. But in BC you could make 100 gold in about an hour.

---
Frenzy cant double proc it can only extend its proc back 8. After 3 points into frenzy you should be in frenzy 100% of the time after the first proc even with a slower speed.
---
A few notes:
---
**Tanks suck at pulling**. I understand that they normally do it in pugs, but they have almost nothing worthwhile to bring to the table in terms of pulling. If you've actually got a static group, you generally want ranged dps to pull (since they have worthwhile abilities for this purpose) and path the pull through the tank.
---
**You Can't Taunt off the Mage**. 'Run to the tank' is generally decent advice. However, much of the time when you see someone running away from the tank it's a Mage who pulled aggro. The reason they're running away is because there's nothing the tank can realistically do. They need to buy the healer time for heals and for Frost Nova to come off cooldown. If they run up to the tank and stop, the tank will maybe nab one of those mobs while the remainder tear them to shreds. So while they should try to circle back to the tank, this is often impossible.
---
**No One Can Read Your Mind**. One of the reasons it's often better to have ranged DPS pull is because when the tank pulls, no one knows where the battle will take place. Your complaint about Shaman, for example. This is 99% the tank's fault because the Shaman has no clue what the tank is thinking and where they're planning to fight. If you're planning to pull as a tank, you really need to hotkey "wait here" and "follow me" to give people an idea of what you're doing if you're not willing to put up with people guessing your intentions wrong.
---
**Do Not Assist the Tank**. The Tank needs to constantly switch targets to maintain aggro. The best people to assist are dps melee - who tend to focus down a single target without worrying about crowd control issues and within everyone's range.
---
**If you want people to fight skull, pick the right skull**. I'd say that 80%+ of the tanks I've seen either skull arbitrarily or incorrectly. Normally, the order of killing should go healers &gt; casters &gt; melee. The way it usually gets skulled is "whatever is next to me" &gt; "whatever is not". If people are consistently ignoring your skull recommendations, you might want to consider what you're picking.
---
**Tanks are good against physical damage, not magical damage**. While tanks have piles of hit points, they're often worse at defending against fireballs and the like than ranged dps (who frequently get magical mitigation abilities as well as ranged interrupts). So when you see your healer take aggro on that caster, you need to check your impulse to 'save' them - there's a good chance they're doing it because it's more efficient for them to tank the caster than the tank to do it.
---
Hey, were you still interested in an addon that does this?
---
I mean, that's what I read
---
What questions couldn’t you answer and why?
---
I always turned my speakers down when I got close. Hated that sound.
---
I discovered that when you equip a bow, the gun sound is completely muted from then on! Crazy I know. Try it out!
---
Ive been wondering this too. And even if you go ele at 40 its probably gonna be hard solo questing. Or so I'd imagine.

Ifs not an addon

Its is a twist of you know the mechanic of each attitude of the key. And I already know of the dungeon grind but once I have the gear I'm done. There is no better version other than progressing to raids

Take SCREENSHOTS.  Your first PC or something?
---
Inconceivable!
---
I understood what you were saying.  I was just trying to fill the gaps for you and also anyone only playing classic that didn't know.... you need to buy bfa if you want to play retail.  You can go play the previous expansion for free just with the subscription but it will be lonely... and that 110 boost is as far as you can go without buying bfa to go to 120 and technically be playing retail then.  At 110 you won't find much to do I'm sure because most other retail players are at 120.
---
It's a bad rule then and a bad rule now. Shouldn't be a rule in the first place imo

---
Big oof.
---
No this time it's the other foot.
---
"We gonna redo group. Cya."
---
Or you know, just don't pull while I'm drinking or looking for a quest item? Also helps a lot if you don't try to spell cleave without mages.
---
Maybe 2021, 2022
---
You have to create the "Sound", "Creature" and "Mechastrider"/"gnomespidertank" folders yourself!
---
At least on something like that, they could actually fix it by adding more guards.. but, with people using the geometry to make it where it's impossible for guards to get to you, there's a lot they can do.. Unless they wanna give the guards something like a Shadow Knights Death Touch that has some range on it.
---
Mages are high skillcap if you're not beating everyone it's cuz you're bad.  Resto druids will beat mages in a 1v1 but who cares about 1v1ing a resto druid

Stopping your auto (weapon buff does) and spending mana is a bad idea. That is a small brain suggestion.

Oh, you sweet summer child :)

Yeah.. being out of the guards agro range is not exploiting.. It's fine if you wanna wait til the guards walk away, then PK someone.. It's where you're making it literally impossible for a guard standing next to you to be able to hit you.

Thanks for this video, very helpful

you can summon someone inside the instance to another part of it though
---
Has anyone got a Resto pre-raid gear list for 60 which includes multiple options?
---
I've seen the BiS lists that include cloth and leather, which I have no problem with, but I want some mail options for each slot.
---
If my BiS cloth piece drops and there is a clothie in the party that needs it, I will not roll. I will roll if nobody needs it though. This is my personal preference.
---
If there is a top 5 list for each slot or something that someone can link, it would be appreciated.
---
Imagine thinking your 6 year old who is most likely a fortnite fanatic will enjoy a grindfest with little to no instant gratification. Dudes delusional.
---
I said to my healer, "I'll be watching your mana every time before a pull".
---
He was so happy he tipped me 1g at the end.
---
&gt; People have been told since 2004 that just cause it's in the game doesn't mean it's okay to exploit if it's clearly unintended.
---
You're right, except there is literally nothing unintended about a mob not attacking you if they can't reach you. That is literally how it works, it is not a bug or unintended. Its a pure flaw in their design. It is dogshit design, and players should not be punished for playing by the game mechanics. Instead of punishing players for using game mechanics as literally intended, fix the issue. 
---
If they wanted mobs to attack you even if they can't reach you, then they would not have programmed them to not attack, now would they?
---
as opposed to now when every single pvp hunter is going to have the exact same pet. wow such customization
---
I remember that instanced dungeons were a high point of contention during WoW's development.  A few of the devs wanted everything open world like in EverQuest and other MMOs of the time.
---
What's with GZ, btw. If you can't be bothered to type Grats, don't bother.

I'm -1 and I haven't even had my first birthday yet.

I meant mana spring restores 1300+ per minute to an entire party of casters. Over 5-10 min boss fights that is a huge amount of mana.
---
I've been running into warlocks that refuse to life tap, when as a paladin with Blessing of Light its real easy for me to heal them for little mana.
---
To some players sure. For me personally it makes me not want to play the game because I'll never truly have the best gear. Warforging was cool but the push past that was way too much.

Alliance gotta get theirs when they can

Not if the tank refuses to wait for the healer to have mana before pulling.  Then they can die and go to hell.

This is absolutely the stupidest thing I have read on this reddit. FINAL PATCH OF CLASSIC

and they did not resolve giving guards ranged and consider this bannable???????????????

vs hunter you want to blink TO them and then frost nova. Then they have one choice and that's to scatter&gt;feign&gt;trap which you can counter easily with ice block.
---
Pen Island
---
As long as the guards CAN get to you, then it's not really a problem.
---
I think it should all be invisible walled personally, but that's a pretty large undertaking developmentally and I mean, we wanted 1.12 back exactly and here it is. If this rule's not in place and they don't change that you can get out of bounds then low level players cease to be allowed in towns sometimes. That is substantially worse than in-game warning people about an exploit and banning repeat offenders is, no matter how you slice it. Plenty of games have punished and banned exploits in the past and continue to when they're unable to be patched quickly, sometimes the code just isn't workable to fix them so you have to moderate the community instead. 
---
As an extreme yet hypothetical example - if something within the game's boundaries allowed you to hard lock a character in place such that they needed a GM to manually get them unstuck before they could do anything at all, would that be worth making a rule about until it could be fixed? I think in any multiplayer setting there exists a threshold where if a possible action is too disruptive it has to be punished, and rooftop griefing has the potential to be over that limit so they took a stance on it.
---
A Slice and Dice may never miss, but plenty of white attacks do.
---
I'm in the same boat as you.  I seriously doubt I can fit raiding into my schedule due to work, sleep and WIFE 😂

But yeah I plan to take my time and see how far I get.  No hurry for me.   :)

There is no focus Target in classic.  You mean assist, and that can be bad if the tank has to Target swap to start building threat on secondary mobs.  Skull on kill Target should be used often and followed though.

Soul pouch.
---
It’s about 60/40 Ally according to census, although in my leveling (as horde) it really doesn’t feel like that big of a disparity. 
---
Economy is still stabilizing, and not a ton of 60s with gold to spend yet. 
---
Been here since it opened and I really like it. You’ll come across plenty of people while leveling, but the areas and spawns aren’t overwhelmed. Not hard to get groups for quests/dungeons (unless you’re playing in really off-peak hours). 
---
Pop has gone from a steady low to a steady medium during peak hours. Expecting that to start creeping towards high will all the transfers opening up. Hope you’ll come join us.
---
That isn’t using geometry to avoid aggro.... they are literally beyond aggro range.
---
Or pull way too much
---
Bad DPS who don't know how to attack skull are why there's no tanks at lv 60.
---
Mik's Scrolling Battle Text has a notification for it.
---
What tank where you using? I just tanked my first dungeon (dead mines) with warrior and it was hell. There was no way I could keep aggro on AoE packs
---
Lol saw this comment on the last one, gald u made it
---
I really don't understand their mentality.  DPS are a dime a dozen and as a tank if I need the loot I'll take non-warrior DPS instead of this unnecessary toxicity.  Like you have to actual want to make someone's day worse by knowing you're going to fuck them over the moment you invite them.
---
Is this a reference to Tristan and Iseult's grave?
---
Found the rooftop camper.
---
Bet you roof camp in Rust too.
---
miss...  vaaaanjie
---
is joke friend.
---
Soo there’s actually no focus in the game so that point is useless unless there’s an add on that has that effect. Usually I just attack whatever’s dying the fastest and assume that’s the tanks main target.
---
When ever im going away, I let my kids play. They run around Orgrimmar and exploring the nearby zones. They are having a blast and I win aswell.
---
You don't have to aggressively shill for your class and be offended if someone has something different to say
---
Like the fact that SPriests are the pvp gods, not Warlocks.
---
Do you carry a second set of gear while leveling or does your main set have a mixture of int/spirit and agi/strength?
---
The SAME paladin who is DPSING! is rolling on spirit cloth bracers AND the tank shield AND the 2hander weapon. My problem is being downvoted for objecting to that.
---
Like the undercity
---
31-5-15 is a decent pve/pvp/offtank build that does well if you can work in your sweeping strikes and slams correctly.

again you're delusional if you think its just horde that does this. This is the nature of World PvP, Life ain't fair and neither is WOW. it;s obviously making you bitter why don't you reroll on a PvE server

Was a dps paladin. rolling on the tank loot the healer loot and all the dps loot. As I made perfectly clear in my post.

Make your hunter man.  Don't think about it to long.

Heyyy, and that's okay! As long as I have mana I don't care how I got it. And as long as I have mana feel free to pull away.
---
 I don't mind running behind the tank cuz we're able to move that fast. Fast is awesome! Dead cuz someone kept going while I was on empty is less awesome.
---
The post said nothing about avoiding aggro; it specifically said where guards can’t get you, ie, you aggro a guard and go to that area and it can’t get to you.
---
This ^^
---
Server is almost 50/50
---
That's... kinda dumb. I thought they fixed that by giving them all ranged attacks that go through buildings? You might as well block off all roof top access because why the fuck is it even accessible then?

I wonder how many of the people who post things like this didn't actually play Classic

Do you know if it's forbidden to use elevation at all, or just in case of avoiding guards? I had fun few times sneaking to SW on my DH, dismounting people flying who were PVP flagged and then using my superior vertical mobility to evade them Batman style and hiding there to wait for another victim.

Murder all hydras in the front and the first group of lizards and patrolling rocks. Then have the lowbie stand in the corner closest to princess where you kite her closest to in her room. The distance is barely enough to master loot the ring over. Hydramist did a video/stream on it I think.

This however requires a level 1 being able to access Maurodon. highly unlikely as most dungeons have a minimum level.

I was killed yesterday by someone standing atop the arena..
---
Give all guards range attacks, but also give them all heroic leaps, that have no restrictions as far as jumping to a roof or something. 
---
How amazing would it be to see a guard heroic leap to the top of a roof and completely devastate some mage who thought he was slick?
---
Is Larry David me?  I'm 100% him in that kind of situation.
---
Of course not.

!remindme 48 hours

Mine are more slow and steady. With mana breaks if I see healer under 25% mana. Or I innervate and go on.

Big Brain
---
Except you can't fly for literally half the expansion... it's so fucking long that switching to classic and having ground mounts only had no effect on me.
---
the enchants you posted are pretty big in vanilla. Also I remember you need them for some ZulGurub stuff. wouldnt call them useless. (Maybe useless atm)
---
Having been an officer in a raiding guild, I can tell you that people in general are whiny babies, and after a while you turn into a jaded middle-manager who is only handling HR complaints.
---
Using what you experienced and/or suffered for in the past, doesn't mean you get to instantly force your past on everyone as a law of the land, it makes for a poor argument. Rolling on a pvp server is full of high risk and high reward most times, and that's what I play on them for. But lets be real, there are some areas that can be cheese and exploited- and that's exactly what is happening. It's easy to tell everyone to nut up, when it's not happening to you, either. I don't just mean safe zones in towns, either. While there is a TON of whining, yes I'll agree, there are some valid points the members of the sub ring. One of which, the literal official words of a GM in said picture, lol. 
---
I brought the example up earlier, just because you don't lock your door, doesn't mean it's suddenly legal for someone to burglarize your home.
---
Too bad all the fonts in that addon are absolute dogshit
---
Man people out here takin screenshots with their phone no way they can manage this
---
Warlocks should never yell at a healer for life tapping themselves nearly to death. I might do that if I'm out soloing some quests, but never while in a group. Not too many situations would even merit using that much mana, unless I'm outright TRYING to steal threat.
---
why would i reroll to a pve server? that means i cant kill horde players questing out in the open..
---
Thankfully they give out warnings before any more serious punishment.
---
Hit the skull.
---
You don’t need prot talents because they’re generally garbage before you invest heavily into the tree which in turn slows your leveling speed. Additionally, most dungeons mobs don’t hit very hard if you pull in small packs. You can generally 2h tank until your late 40s with a decent healer and appropriate content. Just be able to mark kill mobs, and tab sunder and you’ll be alright.
---
Bodypull range of pet is higher than flee aggro range of mob

Ok I guess. Because I think the droprate was super low

So you're the good guys, eh?

I believe he is using healbot.
---
Yes
---
Dueling mages all day is a great workout.
---
No idea what the current policy is. From the screenshot it appears to be anywhere guards can't path to you.
---
You can tank as arms with a 2 hander for most of the leveling process.   Incoming damage is weak so more damage and threat is better.
---
I think he is calling out the people who are defending this absolutely moronic ban, but his phrasing is just kind of unfortunate. 
---
I dont think anyone who is a part of the fortnite generation (people here whining about getting ganked) would say the following; "lmao the current state of video games"
---
I had this issue happen to me the other day shortly after a client update. I resolved it by installing a windows update and rebooting. Gl!
---
I have no idea honestly.
---
Still such a wholesome interaction
---
I’ve sold a few horde side for 12g so far
---
Defensive Stance and a shield, done. Defensive stance increases your threat gain with attacks more so than when in Battle or Berserker Stance. Shield Block on cool down, blocks or parrys triggers revenge and revenge should be used on cooldown (highest threat gain per rage spent). Sunders as a filler (second highest threat gain) and by some miracle you are using all the above and still have over half a rage bar, que a heroic strike. AOE pulls you use demoralizing shout and tab target the above spells once or twice on one mob then change to another for one or two attacks.
---
I didn't call them useless , just not used often.  note we don't have DM released yet.  
---
business opportunity?
---
Yeah, strange that it wasn't added to town guards.
---
For sure, I'm running it on an 4 year old Intel i3 with onboard gpu and reach 70fps on average with 1920x1080 resolution, everything else is on minimum tough.
---
You are right that the shaman can use all that gear to good purpose and I've levelled a shaman myself once to 60, rolled on the arugal robes and meteor shard in SFK, because they were both  very good to me and he has every right to it. 
---
But I consider myself a good enough tank that I rathr roll with a priest healer and 3 warriors (without WF this run) than have a greedy shaman. I as dungeon group leader and tank know, that at some point after the 6th need roll and potential win, people will start flaming. 
---
At level 60 this gets better for enhancers mostly stop playing once they find out just how awful the spec is and elementals are actually a contribution to the group. If you have a priest heal, but want a caster DPS for loot distribution, an elemental can be a solid replacement for a warlock in order to pad melee DPS and still roll on caster gear. 
---
Only while leveling you see some healing a dungeon and rolling on both cloth healing gear and their enhancement DPS gear for questing.
---
The only real problem with that plan is that regrowth is still relatively mana inefficient (barring crits and whatnot).
---
If your tank is in danger of not having a HoT on him, that 21 seconds feels awesome.  But mana-wise you're still better off casting one last HT and then just sitting for regen.    
---
One habit that's a good one to get into if you're not sure whether your tank is going to need a heal and want to regen as long as possible: "cancel-cast."  Just always be casting a spell but sidestep a tiny bit before the cast goes off if you don't need it.  
---
Starting the cast will not break your regen, and then you don't have to wait 3.5 (or 3 if you're using HT4) seconds after you realize you need one for a heal to land. :D
---
Is anything I said wrong though? I always let the tanks pull and waited while drinking for 3-5 seconds each fight before fights with my 2 other mage friends and it sped up the dungeon. Smooth is fast but efficient and smooth is faster
---
Black diamonds aren't worth the time it takes to delete them.

Which might take upwards of 2 hours
---
yea maybe. But they are quite expensive for a new player\^\^
---
*something something #nochanges*
---
done it ofc, I just can't pass on my class quests. I really really enjoy class quests and it makes me sad they're not in the retail anymore. Done the staff/offhand too. they add so much flavor to the game and class
---
Many thanks it worked very well !
---
Very true!  Clothies are our bestest buds.
---
Oh well yeah that’s top tier
---
Very few people are worried about dropping a bunch of gold on enchanting garbage head/pants right now.
---
Luckily the prices of essences has dropped significantly this week.
---
All of Azeroth matters at level 60 in classic? Give me a break. People just run UBRS, Scholo, BRD and do the 2 raids that currently exist.
---
You cant even enchant them rn. DM is not released
---
I didn't ban any bots, really.  I enjoyed seeing the reports of bots banned, though. Not sure I care as much now. It can be a bit of an echo chamber or maybe I'm less zealous.
---
Invest in of nature’s wrath gear. I spent 15g and have like a whole spell damage set. My mana pool is way down so I save money on water and I have more kills per hour
---
I'd roll a Mage now, in phase 1, and roll a lock alt.  Mages are just straight up better right now.  They deal more damage with much less investment.  You'll have more competition for loot as a mage, but meh.  By the time warlocks become strong DPS, you're looking at this time next year.  This is coming from a lock with 2 T2, and pre-BIs in most but not all other slots.  In dungeons everything dies far too fast for dots to be of any use, and your main nuke is a 2.5s cast.  Everything mages do, multiplies the damage of other abilities.  Meanwhile you have subpar AoE compared to them, and you're just sitting there casting a 2.5s shadowbolt over and over, hoping it crits..
---
It really feels... bad.  There's no other way to get around it.   Locks are pretty strong in PvP, probably a bit better than mage.  But it's not like mages are bad in that facet either.  They are really strong there as well.  I personally wish I had rolled mage from the get-go, I'd honestly feel like I'd be having a lot more fun.  Oh and they have better transportation options, and can get around the world much easier than a lock.
---
Probably because they were higher level and could see me. Distract doesn't work on friendly faction.

You are right, but fast bows also eats up your arrows faster so technically they are more expensive to use.
---
It’s truth. So...
---
"No this time it's stuck in a window"
---
Forgot what movie tho
---
That's a very good way of putting it. If I could think of a more consistent method of getting the healer to not do so, however, I would enact it in a heartbeat. I can see both sides of it; the warlock thinks it's obvious that they're going to life tap, and finds it unnecessary to be healed - meanwhile, the healer sees a group member suddenly lose a decent chunk of health.
---
I guess until a better alternative presents itself, I'll just keep communicating.
---
That's some dope druid gameplay. Really cool!
---
What?
---
The warrior life is one fraught with hardships, persevere my friend
---
I dropped my warrior in favour of a hunter for exactly this reason.
---
I love my warrior, and I love tanking - when it goes okay. But yet another run when the mage kept pulling aggro with their ~epic spellcleave~ and going down to 2hp or dying, while the other two DPS saw them do it and started doing the same - no.
---
Most DPS are fucking shit and I don't need that stress.

We haven't had issues getting all of our tanks proper gear. You don't even know how long we're going to have before phase 3, so I don't know how you could possibly calculate we can't gear out three tanks in that time.

I am lvl 40 and i have added 2 People so far because we Sprint 1-2 hours together questing and chattting. And now we often ask eachother for Dungeon runs or some Elite quests but not really more
---
I’m a shaman so I have neither hots nor shields, best case scenario they’re getting hit with my chain heal. But some times if they tank is in all leather with a 2h all I can do is spam him with lesser healing wave. Many factors. Sometimes the warlock just dies and it’s their fault.
---
Just did a stocks run today where my tank pulled the final boss literally as I was sitting down to drink at 0 mana. 
---
Spoiler alert: we fuckin wiped
---
Magma totem gives a ticking dot, fire nova totem is aoe burst dmg when it expires, chain lightning and if you count it lightning shield
---
Because it depends on how much money the hack cost Blizzard.  That is why I asked.
---
As a mage, i understand
---
WHAT
---
Yeah, I tanked some dungeons on retail, however the threat acts differently in classic so I gotta be extra careful....
---
Luckily I have a pocket healer priest that will heal me if I'm willing to tank. Based on the tidbits of information I've picked up here, I know I can tank as fury till around 40 or 50, just gotta use prot stance and a shield :)
---
Bad thing is that I like ny alts, and I must confess that I am an altoholic.
---
Does server merge = transferring?
---
My mom says I'm very smart and handsome, so yes?
---

---
Fun fact! There currently exists a point in the current patch that you can get stuck and only get free with gm help actually. You can reach the edge of the map relatively easily off the coast of durotar and if you jump off you are stuck. 
---
Anyways. 
---
If it's disruptive to the company and their time that is one thing.
---
If it's simply griefing players within a city that's another. 
---
You can grief players just outside the gates, making it an unsafe place.
---
 You can attack players from rooftops, making range of rooftops a currently unsafe place. 
---
The current way of dealing with the problem is an inefficient half measure. It doesn't stop players from doing it. Every player currently gets rondo it for a bit and then gets warned. It doesn't solve the issue. It creates a gray area precedence for everything else as well.  If enough players report a guy for camping outside of town, beyond guard aggro range would that also become a bannable offense? 
---
(exaggerated example, I don't think this would become a thing)
---
I saw another rogue doing this today, and I can’t believe I haven’t taken advantage of that strat
---
I do the same thing with stuff I need to bank. If I don't feel like going to a major city, I just mail it to my alt and send it back later and receive it when I actually go back to the big city.
---
The self rez is also great for groups that wipe without a warlock
---
Lol meant dwarf
---
If you're pulling aggro every time, then don't do that. Save your dumbass big crits for soloing or boss fights with five sunders up.
---
Jesus, this isn't rocket science.

---
I recall I saw the priest had mana so I took a small pause before he even said "Drinking", felt good being aware enough to do that.
---
*Then the rogue stealthed too close to a pack of mobs and got spotted.*

I'll have to keep it in mind, but is shifting to bear, where I can't heal anybody, and then running away if I survive actually a good idea?
---
It’s prebis for any dw fury warr mh. It should run for 275-400 depending on your server/faction pop
---
Clever use of game mechanics. Not an exploit. The guards weren't meant to get on the roofs and they don't.
---
Wasn't this just posted earlier
---
Sometimes ya, I’m a priest though so you are correct it is easier for me lol. It really comes down to being aware of the abilities each class has at their disposal. And that’s on both sides really.
---
Well excuse us Mister "my pc can handle 2 games open".
---
Did you ever end up finding an addon that does this? If so, could you reply with what you're using? Thanks!
---
I am 37 and did SM armory farm runs without losing aggro with average time 15 mins (the average level was 37 too). Just get the increased threat in righteous fury talent and use retri aura. Then you need to have a healer that doesn't slack.
---
Go to a different zone.
---
The instance is less than a level, the questing is 7+.
---
I doubt that you'll always run into a mage that will give you a ton of food. I have no idea since I'm a mage but the way people tip me I'd guess they don't usually get 80x water.
---
So invest in a side team to build/rebuild, develop and slowly transition assests to it as it develops. 
---
Plan ahead.
---
You should check out Project Lore, I grew up on that shit. Featuring Jerry Trainor and Alex Albrecht
---
Nope, that's the tank's excuse.
---
You can write your own emotes so you basically can communicate can‘t you?
---
As long as your group aren’t idiots and you are using several ranks of earthshock you should be fine.  Rank 1 earthshock for interrupts, max rank for “taunt” and mid range shocks for maintaining threat without blowing out mana.  Being in melee increases your threat and healing also increases your threat.  I never tanked in vanilla but i’ve Had no issues tanking in classic up to RFK so far.
---
yea but we are talking about "pristine black diamonds"
---
This has always been the case. It has always astonished me how some people either think they can do it without any consequences or are so mentally challenge to not think it's an exploit: "Oh guards can't touch me here, nice, it must be normal, I will never get punished for this"
---
Click the !, do the thing, click the ?. You can level up without grouping with four mages and doing the same dungeon over and over again.
---
Tanking can definitely be frustrating but honestly every random dungeon is.  
---
For most people atm, dungeons are for pre-raid and thus efficiency is key.   I love tanks that chain pull within reason, but shit like healers drinking where pull ends as opposed to where pull starts leads to wipes.   You don’t need to drink to full anyway, but there’s no benefit in drinking 50 yards from the tank when you can drink 15 yards away and continue drinking once your in combat, healing without moving 5/6 seconds into pull.  
---
Same with Mages, often have double the DPS on metres (350-400) but less total cdmg than rogues/hunters because they insist on drinking to 100% before doing anything.   Biggest issue is mages waiting years before using nova as well, use it ASAP when you or anyone else is using aoe.  
---
Also yet to see a single person complain that tank can’t hold aggro, it doesn’t happen.   This game is not in any way difficult, just understand how to do things better tbh
---
Gnome bodies.
---
What sites?
---
Fire Nova is alright as enh as it does one big burst of damage to everything closeby.  Otherwise no, unless you're resto/ele and have Chain Lightnings that are worth casting but even then the move has a cooldown, albeit a short one - you can make up for it by alternating between Chain Lightning and Chain Heal in a party haha.  Magma totem is strong on paper but unfortunately unreliable for a number of reasons.

I wouldn't expect the outcome to be any different lol, you reap what you sow
---
This is true, I am only nice when It looks like I won’t win and losing will inconvenience me.
---
I play horde and alliance.
---
This some horde-pagan god your blasphemous tongue drivels? 
---
May you find the light, heathen.
---
I tend to listen to my own tunes while playing, but if that's the case I'll def put more of an emphasis on in game volume while in contested areas. 
---
I also have absolutely no skills in Feral, I'm full resto
---
Booooooo
---
Or save it for iron grenades ;)
---
Yeah, but water is expensive. You can wait for me to drink to full or you cs5n rush in and still wait for me to drink.
---
Same. Good to know it's something worth reporting. There was a dwarf hunter killing any horde in Gadgetzan from the top of the arena with no regards to level.
---
Killed me like 3 times before I've had enough. Might come back there and do some reporting against those fuckers.
---
Well I'm super new to the game. I first wanted to play a shadow priest because I enjoy playing the healer class in non healing ways but after some very interesting group questing on an island in the silver pine forest I gotta say healing is super fun and I will probably keep doing it :)
---
Yeah it doesnt make sense though, because I can still xfer my other characters from the server. Oh well, hopefully this ticket gets resolved soon.
---
Any custom emotes just get translated as "made some wierd gestures" or something.
---
Those are not real Horde, they are weaklings. All Alliance should be killed on sight, that is what a true Horde player would do.
---
This definitely shouldnt be possible
---
That's Quagmire that said that lol
---
The dead zone give every idiot the courage they need to take on an hunter, caster usually end up dead because they forget that most hunters level as BM MM. Honestly I dont recall having too much trouble with shamans back in the days, but it's like a billion years ago so i could be wrong.
---
Yea you kinda have to be able to do it to get anything done.
---
He threw away his trusty bear in the trailer :( F for mister Fuzzles
---
Where's the You didn't wait like I asked so I could regain Mana
---
Cyka blyet
---
I agree with you 100% on a per mob basis, but overall you'll save a lot of time by adjusting your rotation to allow the regen at the end of kill. Especially if you spec improved drain soul, which doubles the effect of spirit making it unequivocally better than a simply larger mana pool.
---
VW  can die anytime; I welcome it. He runs out of mana and I sac him myself. 
---
You are able to go a lot longer without eating this way which saves more time in the long run.
---
It takes forever to find a tank i dinged 60 on my mage 2 weeks ago im already leveling a warr so i can tank dungeons cba waiting 45 min to make a group.
---
If you like tanking you should roll a warr and dps or even tank in raids we alaways need more
---
&gt;Why pay to keep two low pop servers running when you could just have one medium pop?
---
Because they will get more money from you paying to transfer off the server.
---
Servers cost almost nothing to keep up, but there is a lot of profit to be made in waiting for those servers to die and then offering server transfers for a price.
---
But the use rate is going to be low as well, you need time for people to hit cap and start looking for those enchants, for now the majority of most servers is between 30-50.
---
What’s your character name so I can make sure you’re never in my groups... just kidding but seriously how do you play with a controller, I’m considering buying a game pad because I’m running out of keys to bind to.
---
Don't forget the point this was also pre-nerfed Windfury.
---
They're a chinese player which means you have a lot of chinese on your server
---
it's not that complicated at all. shit is just darker looking. if you care about looks, you have to leave shadowform
---
go east and get the flight path on the border to thousand needles, as others have said. also if your ever in ashenvale, I recommend going all the way to azshara for the flight path just inside that zone, it connects theramore to northern kalimdor nicely, astronnar doesnt help as much as youd think iirc
---
Standing in certain spots has always been bannable.. standing on GM Island, Old IF amongst other places would get you banned for exploitation - all used to be accessible via the client.
---
I take pride in sitting down next to the healer in protest of any idiot dps that would pull while she's drinking.
---
Actually just about to start that quest, thanks for the heads up!
---
Imo Rogue gets okay once you hit level 20 and get poisons. At level 40 Rogue becomes pretty good. I struggled a little pre 40, but now I have no issues and levelling is generally a breeze.
---
Exactly. This is the argument that people put up. Which then makes the role mandatory for groups. Then forces people who don't want to heal to have to heal for the sake of the group. All because there are the few you deliberately want to tank and heal. So have your fun. I feel bad for the people who suck it up for their friends.
---
I have no idea about lategame, but a 20/31/0 build sure seems to have synergy.
---
Gonna tag on here - by SS/riposte macro, do you mean one like in the video guide below that uses both abilities? Also, is riposte worth taking for leveling? Thanks
---
I mean, if you're communicating with the tank, yeah. But if you're just getting choked that he's not shaving *15 seconds* off of each pull, you might not be cut out for grouping with random people. You may need to find some likeminded friends.
---
I'm currently working on an affliction warlock. Hopefully the zoomer DPS will be gone when I go back to focusing on my Druid.
---
I think we may have just created something there
---
Hence why warnings exist.  That's the whole point.  I'd imagine you need to be a pretty big fuckwit ignoring these rules through several warning before any kind of actual action gets taken against you.
---
Sure they _can_ but doing so costs manpower and money. 
---
So I believe they won't do that.
---
30-50 is crazy high considering there is literally no use for them until phase2. On my realm they are super low
---
if you want the version of the game with improved engine you can go play retail.
---
I love these they are awesome!
---
Learn how to pull caster mobs with LOS to avoid pulling extras. 
---
Bind skull and w/e icon you want to use for cc to something easy. Mark as you pull. 
---
Tada!!
---
Because it's true?
---
I have had so many 1v1s while leveling. Always, the 2nd whored checks the situation :
---
* If it looks like I'm dominating my opponent, he runs away
---
* If it looks like I'm already losing, he charges in.
---
Horde isn't about world pvp. Horde is about being the little kids who got bullied in school and now want to feel powerful in ~~world pvp~~ skilless ganking.
---
And that btw. is exactly why I look forward to smashing you in Battlegrounds. Because here is how those pan out: 10 rogues/mages/wars/enhanceshamans vs. a team that has 2 healpallies and a disc priest. Enjoy your "superiority" based on nothing but numbers while it lasts ;-)
---
It is also the fact that quests send you all over the place. Oh we need an explosive? Go to ironforge to ask an expert on the matter, then come back.
---
Committing to all the traveling is awesome and it makes the world feel so real and alive.
---
A good general rule of thumb if you're trying to pull things at a brisk pace is that the healer should be fine if they are at 50% mana or more and drinking. They should top off their mana by the time you need a heal.
---
I’m sorry but this is dumb.
---
It's more like getting knocked down and stunned. In neither case can you block, dodge, or parry, leaving you completely defenseless (which is why stamina is king, even at this stage)
---
I was victim to this for like 10 levels before I realized..
---
I actually think some of the key strengths of vanilla were accidental. Blizzard is good at game design, but not great at social engineering. Few people are tho; back in the day none of us really understood what made the social aspects of the game tick. When we gave feedback it was just how to improve the game parts. Hence TBC improved class and encounter mechanics but hurt the social aspects.
---
Runescapes treasure trails are amazing for this reason.
---
Yes. Generally speaking a slow but high damage main hand for better Sinister Strike damage, and a faster offhand for more poison procs.
---
Cataclysm water and modern sun shafts will do that to you.  🙄
---
This is really cool! Well done.
---
I love this so much
---
Impossible.
---
I don't know how people can unironically play gnomes
---
at 38 he's in the middle of the intended level range.
---
Better then you, LMFAO - these idiots wouldn’t need to safespot if they were any good at PvP. Only Griefers and Trash players do this..
---
The Matrix
---
Lmao at the downvotes. This is the right answer. HS cannot glance, and once your gear reaches a certain point you have enough rage to spam HS.
---
Every healer needs a pocket mage.
---
Perfect summary
---
So im a lock, lvl 48 now so im getting near where the dungeons get more challenging, and i gotta say i dont understand threat nearly as well as i did when i played tank in vanilla. I pull aggro several times every dungeon. I probably need to pay more attention to this stuff in the future.
---
What are some rules of thumb i should keep in mind?
---
youre about to have a really bad time
---
So i can use the shaker on one leathee before it coolsdown?
---
Hit enter type “can I roll need on this for levelling” and read their responses
---
Yes, yes, let the hate run through you. Let it consume you.
---
People wouldn't lie about things on the internet right? Nobody is playing dumb in this thread, griefers really just didn't know about this.
---
Blizzard introduced dishonorable kills and guards to discourage people from killing and taking over towns. They repeatedly warned and banned people who abused guard pathing. By the middle of vanilla all this shitty griefing was gone.
---
The last shit griefers tried was the Silithus bug where an opposing faction hunter would shoot you and FD which made guards attack you simply for being in combat without retaliating.
---
When those fuckers were banned and the bug fixed the griefing essentialy died. Those claiming they didn't know about such thing are either liars or they never played back then. It was a big enough issue that the majority of players knew about because we were all victim of it at least a few times.
---
During leveling I'd primarly roll for the leveling spec
---
Ambush (with high talented crit chance) - Backstab - 4/5 point CB Eviscerate after an energy tick?
---
Getting easy two-shots requires clothies and gear superiority. Having a high-damage and slow main hand dagger is critical to damage output.
---
The group was for quick spam runs. Also I probably would’ve let him in if he hadn’t been a dick in the first place.
---
I discovered it as horde when I was just exploring Ashenvale (back in Vanilla).  On the Ashenvale side atleast it's called Talondeep Cave.
---
I thought wait does this lead through?  No way it's just a silly name none of these caves have ever lead through they just end.  So of course I went in ready to be disappointed... And came out in Stonetalon "well I'll be damned".  Then for 30 lvls I was disappointed in almost every cave since that one.
---
until they accidentally drop ur BiS item
---
Best run i had in sm was a pala concecrate-tank. Very rarely seemed to drop aggro at all.
---
Hardly makes a difference when I'm shootin magic out my dick and fighting an army of goblins
---
How so
---
15 years and spells don’t have proper icons. GG blizzard.
---
Thx
---
Nah dude, you look like the bad guy here.
---
The motivation to play a certain class comes and goes, if you switch character as soon as it goes away, you’ll never get anywhere. There are times where you just have to keep going even though you think you want to make another character.
---
I couldn’t stop making alts on another mmo but in wow I’ve just stuck to a warrior because my highest level in the other mmo was like a dwarf warrior. And as painful as the class can be at times i know it’ll become the best tank and arguably the best dps at higher levels.
---
Does limeguide also have the exact same minimap icons as questie? If not, I'd put my money on this being questie.
---
classic "speedrun" retail mentality.
---
It was meant as a joke. Everyone gets frustrated when getting ganked and people say stuff like that. I don't have a faction preference one way or another.
---
Well, you might survive in bear because of your „armor“ + you can try to stun him with bash or your tauren racial - you should care about your survival first because you are the healer and healers have to die first :D so the rogues target should be you...if he swaps to someone else you can heal them up while he uses his cds
---
WAIT A SECOND....... something....is off here.
---
Questing and grinding only took place if a quest item just would not drop. I did each dungeon only once and when I had most if not all the quests for it.
---
Why not just give guards a ranged attack with a gun or crossbow. Assuming people even know this is an exploit. I don't play on PvP world's or even PvP at all but this seems more like we can't be bothered to find a solution so you're just suppose to know that it's an exploit. A MELEE not being able to hit you at RANGE. 
---
Next joke will be that strafing or kiting is an exploit because they can't hit you back.
---
Add rogue to that list. I could down most classes with dags sub/sin spec when I got the jump.  Even plate went down with serrated blades/imp expose armor back during BC arenas.  Looking forward to spec back to that when the next phases roll out.
---
ok thanks for the help.
---
Thank you. I have both, I recorded each ding and also downloaded an addon that screenshoted every time I dinged. Might make a screenshot version.
---
I let dps who pull while I am drinking die. Brings me great satisfaction. If you like to chainpull with no respect for your healer's mana, you can just go back to retail.
---
Rare spawn
---
You roll on gear fore the dungeon role you are performing. 
---
If something Enh-related drops and the DPS don't need it, type out and ask if it's OK for you to need on it for enhancement. 
---
Easy peasy.
---
Are you both using the same video settings? I attempted it on max myself and couldn't perform it.
---
I think the obvious answer for Warlocks has gotta be the Dreadsteed.
---
Check out the 32 and 42 dings too!
---
Yep,  I am anal.  That's probably it.  Since I don't have any sense of "right" it "wrong" in depicting an event. Shit, I couldn't even care less about lore so, yeah that must be wikipedia level anal.
---
Similarly I met someone called "ispitoneyou". He spat at me :(
---
Yeah, we both have it on “3” , which is supposed to be classic like.
---
Most of the dings are from quests and it looks like he didn't spent too much time in the same zone, so efficient questing looks to be the answer. Of course there was an SM ding though, everyone dings in SM at least once!
---
All I got from this is rouges can tank.
---
I never had to dungeon spam or grind except for one lvel in like the 30s. Tbf o followed a guide, but i had plenty of quests
---
In my own experimenting, it wasn't until I got rank 2 that I was consistently doing more damage, and then some points in imp SnD where I could reasonably keep it up for longer fights, than I was just using a 3-5 pt eviscerate.
---
I was hoping it would be satisfying to watch. Thanks!
---
Yeah, if I'm drinking in a dungeon without a mage, I'm not getting up until my mana bar is full haha. It's too expensive to waste!!
---
I felt like I would mess his head even more if I just write down yet another answer. Its already so messy here
---
Jesus christ these retards replying to this post.
---
First kill: afk player
---
Second kill: mage on a boat who was focusing someone else, lol
---
Didn't finish watching it, straight up dogshit.
---
Thanks!
---
Almost every lfm spam I see is 'only need tank then g2g"
---
And Everquest 1 released an expansion in the last 12 months
---
Such a thing does not exist.
---
Most likely they just said so, to put their own goal in a better light or to pose with their own accomplishment.
---
You can still be rezzed but they have to find where you died.
---
If you don't release they can just click on your portrait and make sure they are in range/LOS. Much easier on the rezzers
---
Had to put something over it otherwise it'd have been muted clips. I listened to a lot of copyrighted music while leveling.
---
If the guards cannot get to you then it’s exploitation.
---
More. I need more.
---
It’s been 3 weeks. It’s an MMO
---
What is the add-on next to chat and which information does it provide ? It looks interesting!
---
Lol this ain’t the game for them then. Move along.
---
Maybe that's the problem
---
The original 2005 post says that, this is just a GM that caught someone on top of some building using that exploit.
---
If this is "out ranging" the guards, It's not something that should be done inside the building. It's abusing mechanics that aren't intended. Hop up on the ledge and attack someone anywhere else. Or better yet, do it anywhere else in the building. The guards attack you as intended, thus using whatever part of the ledge takes you out of range is unintentional to the game development. 
---
These kind of things have been punished before. The layering abuse is a good example. Layering is intended, but it was abused in a way the developers didn't want. Now people are getting punished. Just because it's in the game, doesn't mean it's supposed to be there.
---
Yeah it’s a badass reference to a movie iirc but such a chill spot!
---
This isn't new. Safespotting was illegal back in vanilla days as well, and it was especially abused in Gadgetzan, Sharks in BB and not to mention Silithus.
---
Whilst it might just be "harmless fun" for you shooting, or killing or morphing players where guards cant get to you, let me promise you one thing, it isn't as "fun" as you might think it is on the other side of the "trade".
---
My main in retail has switched back and forth between factions so many times, currently a Human, but I will say this, the Horde are generally a much nicer player base in game
---
Gear with spell damage on it increases wand damage.
---
He’s part of the 300 club (300 squat, bench, clean)
---
You just have to turn on timestamps in the options
---
WHOA YOU KILLED A MOUNTED AFK DUDE WOWWWWWWWWW
---
&gt;half health players
---
&gt;players fighting mobs
---
SO SKILL, VERY WOW
---
that suicide jump at the end though LMAO. surprised she stayed there and didnt bolt before you came back though
---
The good news is that at 60 at least, it costs 4s per lvl 45 water but you also get 4-8s per dungeon mob kill so it’s not so bad
---
No, you want strenght as cat.
---
I think this caused the problem, thanks a lot!
---
You can make a lvl 5 bank alt and have them learn enchanting, they can now disenchant any item you can mail.
---
Yup. She thicc
---
What's the name of that song again?
---
But not the ones we deserve
---
Yeah nah, real life doesn’t work like the movies.... no gov will be getting/forcing a crim to do work for them.
---
Fps affects a whole mess of things in many games so my instinct is to blame fps.  Who gets higher fps and is it significantly higher?
---
You can make it show if you use the cast bar under the player frame option in default UI. Its in the move frame tab when you right click player.
---
Down ranking heals is horrible for mana efficiency until you get a lot of +healing. Downranking with no bonus healing means you have to spam more heal casts to get the same effect as one or two big heals which mean you spend less time in the out of combat mana regeneration state.
---
When you say transfer, do our chars carry over in case there's an upcoming expansion for classic?
---
Yeah that's what I was thinking. Was just wondering if it would be worth carrying/getting a second set while leveling.
---
Bullshit. We spent 2 or 3 years with the MoP shrines dealing with people flagpole camping and nobody ever got a warning at all. Give the guards a new player teleport to pull them down or let things go as is, because this is way too subject to opinion and open for abuse by players manipulating GMs. Just like players constantly false report for "bad names" to trigger auto-renames.   
---
I don't mind at all if the guards get changes to enforce things that are going to end up as BANS otherwise, but I don't want to deal with some GM being lied to that I'm exploiting guards by just staying out of range of their spawn.
---
Doubt that they'll ever find my Bis item in The Barrens. I always place them in a low levelzone, so they feel like they are doing something. Wrecking lvl 20 mobs are lvl 60, sure boosts their ego.
---
WoW memes shouldn't be funny. Why are they funny?
---
Both.
---
He was referring to levels not price, i believe :)
---
Why specifically rank 1?
---
Armors great on a druid tank 
---
the rest is ok for any caster
---
Everyone wants to do "big pulls" "aoe farm" "quick runs" when in reality that means they have zero concept of how threat and the game works
---
Its not a lot of fun, you aren't wrong.
---
I mean hellfire doesn't really work when a couple things are hitting you. You kind of need a damage shield for it to even be effective.
---
TL;DR:
---
“We’re supposed to be a unit!”
---
“Suck my unit.”
---
It has nothing to do with PVP.  Guards are there to enforce peace in a town - using terrain to cause an unintended avoidance of game mechanics is the definition of an exploit.  
---
Go be a psychopath and bully folks out in the world if ya want to fight - I'm guessing you already did this and couldn't figure out any other way to not get shit on, so you decided to attack AFK folks in town.
---
R13 here, the grind was unbelievable. Basically burned entire summer vacation off of school on it. On one hand I don't think this is a good system whatsoever. But on the other hand I think BG style 10vs10 fits MMO far better than arena formats. Even considering class balance and all that. My favorite time in WoW was premades before xrealms, where you mostly knew the teams going against you and there was a bit of a rivalry going on.
---
For hunter I would say it would completing the quest for rhok delar. It requires a good bit of individual skill (no one can help you or the quest mobs despawn) and a strong kiting skills as well. You can be sure any hunter rocking the rhok is legit. I would say the same applies to priests and their staff, but I never played one in vanilla so I can’t say for certain.
---
Yeah my wand damage is increased by the exact amount of + spell damage on my gear. You can simply log in and see it in your stats. Unless this is a visual glitch which I doubt because my wand does significantly more than the base damage.
---
Today you, tomorrow me. Friend .
---
This is the only answer.  Everyone that claims otherwise is likely so bad at this game that this is the only way they can "PVP", AFK-blasting people in town.  Super tough guys!
---
Ok so what does 305 + 6% mean towards glancing blows? 
---
I assume that hitting 9% means you wont miss on your attacks but doesnt that mean your attacks have a 91% chance to hit in the 1st place? Thats pretty decent right. How often would you really roll a miss? (Ofc 9%) but that would really happen that often during a short fight right? Am i looking at this wrong in some way?
---
I thought they gave guards knockback guns for this very reason?
---
Thats a bug exploit if he walks through door
---
Epic thanks!
---
I'd say movement speed on some white boots
---
Druid rite of passage? At lvl 40 dance at the top of SW fountain as a moonkin(g) ;)
---
Not surprised you're a cleaver at all...may I ask what makes wow fun for you?
---
That's just it- you mostly can't pick them off one by one so that makes it challenging and you have to die at the first boss so you are doomed to that Southshore- SFK run at least once.
---
But all in all it was still faster than begging people to run me through as I've seen one Paladin in guild do a few days before me and it took him about twice as long for the whole thing.
---
Use the twitch client look in the classic wow mods section
---
Yup. Everybody here wants to act like shits immutable. I could run a group through every fucking dungeon pre-SM with a single healer and 4 of literally any class in the game. You don't NEED a tank. Just like you don't NEED CC. It just makes shit easier. There's a difference between being nice and being necessary.
---
That's why my friend and I rolled Warrior + Priest, currently Level 49, we find groups for every instance immediatly.  
---
Looking forward for Level 60, no wating time at all.  
---
I would highly recommend to play a warrior as tank if you like it.
---
Good thing it'll be removed in a couple months.
---
WoW is not really a hard game. Tanking is mostly just a simple loop of checking mana, checking mobs, then pulling as many as the group wants to handle at once. 
---
I feel like bad tanks usually are the ones who just aren’t sensitive to other group members. When I tank, I’m asking how the team wants me to pull, gently letting them know if they’re aoeing too early, or whatever. WoW is mostly a game of managing people.
---
Yeah but that doesn't always work. Also, some spots don't even make the guards attack you.
---
Cool, thanks for replying
---
Fucking glorious. Old-school Blizzard really knew how to have fun with their games.
---
Free gold
---
Big thonk
---
Oh so the people encountered sitting on top the Lakeshire inn ganking for hours I could have reported? I wish I'd known, but so used to being told 'if you don't like it roll on a PvE server' I thought there was nothing I could do. They were being dicks for hours, much higher level ganking way lower level players, and of course completely unbothered by guards.
---
Highly recommend addon CCC
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/ccc
---
At level 25 your spec doesn't really matter for DPS
---
Details! Is a great add-on as it comes with a built in threatmeter
---
Well then he also would be in combat with the mobs, and get aggronwhen the tank died due no mana
---
Find another 60 friend and trade dungeon boosts?
---
You should discuss it before the run starts, but a reasonable expectation is that everyone is there to roll on loot for their leveling spec. You should not expect warrior tanks or healing enhance shamans to pass on 2-handed weapons for example.
---
This, I swear my mount got delayed a few levels because I bought so much water
---
Daggers is better for group play as you can sit behind enemies. For solo play swords are better as daggers are mostly useless with being able to rarely use back stab
---
Or the lock that tab targets dots up another pack, that pulls a 3rd pack and then goes fuck it and starts hellfiring before I have any hope of getting threat
---
On my rogue I managed to make a macro that initiates stealth if not in combat, casts cheap shot if stealthed, and casts sinister strike if in combat. I can basically fight with one button and kill mobs effectively, gotta get this steam link thing to see if i can play on my phone now
---
Get a loan from a friend
---
Tell him u pay in 1 month
---
Talents:
---
There's not really much choice about talents early on.  Stay in Feral tree and make a beeline for Faerie fire feral (should get this at level 30 - it makes tanking a lot easier).
---
Ferocity x5
---
Feral Instinct x5
---
Feline Swiftness x2 (not compulsory for tanking, but vital fir levelling)
---
Sharpened Claws x3
---
Predatory Strikes x3
---
Primal Fury x2
---
Faerie Fire Feral x1 (level 30)
---
Savage Fury x2
---
Feral Charge x1
---
Feral Aggression x1 (this is a filler talent - your choice)
---
Heart of the Wild x5
---
Leader of the Pack x1 (level 40)
---
At this stage, you have a choice - Balance or Restoration part first.  Your choice. 
---
Restoration:
---
Furor x5 (allows powershifting and slightly quicker / better levelling as feral dps - no need to wait for energy to regen after changing into cat.  Better pulls as bear)
---
Improved Enrage x2 (even better pulls as bear - can probably leave these talents until last)
---
Balance:
---
Nature's Grasp x1
---
Improved Nature's Grasp x4 (filler talents - less use in pve, good for pvp)
---
Natural Weapons x5 (good for dps / threat)
---
Omen of Clarity x1 (good for dps / threat)
---
I will go Furor, then Balance to OOC, then Imp Enrage.  This gets me to 58.
---
3 remaining points are up to you - Natural Weapons x3 (increased dps/ threat) is probably what I'll take.
---
If you're focused on tanking, you pretty much need to follow this exactly (certainly up to fff).  If you've gone much astray, it may be worth respeccing.
---
Rotation:
---
Use Enrage pre-pull if you think the dps won't mind waiting around (they normally will mind...).
---
Ranged pull with Moonfire (you should train this as high as possible for this reason) up to level 30, then use fff, so you can be in bear form.
---
Let them come to you unless you know you can tank all the mobs (including the nearby ones that dps pull in...). Once you get Feral Charge (at level 33), I start charging in more - it gets you there ahead of the dps and so you have that bit more time to gain threat.
---
From then on:
---
Mainly use Maul.  At this level, you won't have enough rage to use it on CD, but just use whenever you can.
---
Don't use Swipe unless you have rage to spare (unlikely) or you're surrounded by 5+ mobs.
---
Use Demoralizing Roar soon after the pull.  Wait until all / most mobs are near enough then cast it.  After that, just maintain the debuff.
---
Use Faerie Fire Feral on CD (free and generates threat).
---
How to deal with packs (this is all for level 33+, but you're nearly there!):
---
Mark Skull (dps kill this first) and Moon / Square (cc)
---
FFF and charge skull.
---
Get one auto attack in, then switch to a second (non-cc'd) mob. 1 Maul, FFF, Demoralizing Roar.
---
At this point, you may be losing aggro on skull, but that's fine, because if all 3 dps are focusing it, it will die soon anyway.
---
If there is a 3rd lose mob, switch this now.  You may need to use taunt here as the healer may have got aggro, then 1-2 Mauls, FFF when it's off cd, then back to the 2nd mob.
---
Once skull gets to about 5-10% health, mark second mob with skull, so dps know who to switch to.
---
Rinse and repeat!
---
Make sure to move active mobs away from any CC'd mobs, so cleave / aoe is less likely to break the cc.
---
If your group doesn't have decent cc, you can end up facing  5 mobs at times.  This is just the same rotation as above, but whack-a-mole version.  Try and keep one mob marked as skull (the best way to deal with a large group is to make it a small group! With this in mind, it can be best to focus / mark the easy mobs first).
---
Any mob that you don't have threat on: Charge, Taunt, Maul, FFF, move on!
---
Challenging Roar about 1/3 of the way into the fight if you're losing control of the situation.
---
Roll a HotW druid:)

Few days back we were doing SM Armory. Priest sits down to drink mana in front of the boss room door. I see others going in and think "oh they will wait for the priest inside" and I follow them. As I enter I see warrior instantly attack the boss. Doors slam shut while our priest still outside. 
---
Somehow we managed to down the boss with our enha shaman healing.
---
what level would you say it starts to matter more?
---
I've also noticed that I get pushback through the shield (PvE).
---
Personally i think meters should be banned.
---
I got him last week on my hunter the moment I hit 10 as well. It was in the early morning, so I was just able to strut in there and grab him after a few minutes of running around spamming a /target macro. 
---
Not gonna lie, my hunter-peen expands a bit when I walk past other hunters who just settled for a raptor or a durotar tiger, so it's made me understand the desire to get that 'rare' pet just a bit more.
---
It's not the tanks fault if you die in classic, its your job to control your threat.
---
Btw I love your drawings, not only funny but really cool too. Coming from an Alliance warrior to a Horde warrior.
---
Not everybody farms rep for the winterspring mount but it is a big grind. While in later expansion everybody must grind rep of that factuin to unlock that thing.
---
Raid profiles &gt; display class colors
---
Generally while leveling you just want to use whatever the highest DPS weapon you can find is.
---
Avoid talents specific to types of weapons, and your main hand should be slow. This allows your abilities like sinister strike, which is instant, to do more damage with the same energy costs.
---
I’m not a pro rogue theorycrafter, but that’s my take on it
---
well according to a post doing stuff like this is bannable lmao... :\\
---
thats what i was thinking. im planning to just farm dungeons to lvl up. i will rarely be solo playing unless a quest gives an item i want.
---
Ok. Have fun.
---
I mean youre not wrong and if it weren't being removed in phase 2 I wouldn't even be playing the game.  They could have done it better I'm sure but at this point you just gotta say oh well
---
Its a leveling wep and u shouldnt be daggering in the first place
---
Not a twink item either I think anyway 49s will be very very rare
---
Been playing for around 16 hours and I dinged level 17 last night. Even most of my guild ain't above 20+
---
Or 35
---
I help anyone but frost mages. Any frost mage I let die.
---
What are the chances they'll loosen the reins a little bit for classic pvp?
---
I've never used any other path to get to the Charred Vale.
---
60
---
The first thing I did in Classic was go to SW to see if I could jump underneath. Yep. Sweet. Hearth out.
---
You're correct.  The only way to remove them is to place another of the same type or let them expire.  There's definitely no macro to remove them.  I started playing shaman in wrath, and I really miss Totemic Recall!
---
Layering kills everything. We knew this from the start
---
You can cancel it. It’s honestly not that great except for solo and farming lower level dungeons. Any dungeon around your level and you’re not going to want that to proc otherwise it’ll break CC and your group will wipe.
---
Tauren hunter, switched to bow asafp.
---
When leveling i would say the opposite
---
Need for your spec not your current role
---
I doubt those are mafias (in all cases).  Its just people trying to deny other faction in general.
---
I mean that was their estimation back when they thought they only needed a handful of realms and that most people would just be tourists, but what happens when phase 2 rolls out and there are still queues? At this rate they will have to keep layers longer than originally intended
---
That's pretty cool. Good catch!
---
Even just questing in the world I try to help out people and throw then a heal.
---
Had a warrior saying Warrior sucks in general chat and raging cause he kept dying in the Loch.
---
I went to help the guy out and he was just charging into a group of Troggs and expecting to be able to 1v4 them.  I think people are just used to being op and not having to manage as much resources in the start.
---
Also Warriors  have the habit of forgetting that other people have resources and how I cant cast forever.
---
As someone who plays both dps and tank alts, please add “if you expect cc, dont put a fucking dot on every mob in the fight”
---
I respecced elemental after 40 and I LOVED IT! Its an amazing spec and so refreshing after 40 levels of bashing mobs with a stick.
---
BM all the way. I respecd for a second around 50 and MM wasn't as fun for sure. HUGE aimed shot crits were cool and all but your pet can't really hold aggro for shit when you're pumping out that much damage at once.
---
We need our mana? Are you multiple people at once?
---
Til
---
That was obviously not what I meant.
---
Yeah I remember pvping in gadgetzan way back when too.  
---
Arbitrary hidden rules suck, why dont they just move the guards.
---
I mean you have a point, it's truncated geography.  I always felt like Alterac Mountains were the most comical example.
---
But I accept it as a cartoonish approximation of Azeroth, for the purpose of a game.  In a movie or book I wouldn't expect to find the characters walking for 30 minutes and getting to Ashenvale from Thousand Needles.  That should be a multi-day trek, but that's obviously infeasible in a game that you want to feel populated.
---
So then if the zones are very distinct (but much smaller than would be realistic), do you do a smooth transition between them?  To do it realistically smooth, that would mean big transition areas and then zones have to be made artificially large.  You'd probably end up with a map where the transition areas themselves need to be made zones.
---
I think the compromise is to make hard boundaries to zones so that each zone gets the most space for it's personality, and then try to make neighboring zones feel like natural neighbors. Like I think it would be better for Stonetalon to lead into Winterspring, or the Barrens (savannah) to lead into Ungoro Crater (like the real Ngorongoro)... but overall I'm fine with the system they chose.
---
Never thought of this... nice tip.
---
That is eventually what guards became.
---
It's also just as sad, if it's a small or big guild.
---
&gt;  but what happens when phase 2 rolls out and there are still queues?
---
Then people can take the option they were given before and transfer. People were warned.
---
I did two dungeons yesterday.  One with an under lvled group that I thought was gonna be tough.  Wasn't bad at all, fast and smooth with everyone doing their job.
---
Then the second group, with a healer 10lvls above me who was going to "help out".  Thought "this is gonna be easy!".  Phhtttt  The healer kept pulling, twice while I was pulling a different pack.  Leading to 2 group wipes, lots of frustration, and a much slower run despite having over 15 lvls more than the first group while doing the same instance.
---
At about 40-44 you can switch to ele. 
---
It's stronger but requiring more mana, so more time spent drinking.
---
But not relying on WF procs is great.
---
Need to downrank water, thats what i do. Without mage i got 2 water ranks
---
Stay out of tanking if u cant take the heat!
---
But on the other hand, i shouldnt roll for Healing gear if a caster DD needs it?
---
Yep
---
True true, I should also mention I'm a night elf not a Tauren.
---
I'll have to look into some bear stuff just to buy time.
---
Census data is bad for server health lol.
---
When all the players leave there will be zero players.
---
That's not a difference. Both scenarios are e ploits by any definition of the word. And it's not that much of a stretch to look at what the GM in the picture above said and apply it to this one as well. You'd have to explain why wouldn't fall under the category of "terrain exploitation."
---
Because it's clearly designed that if you attack others within a neutral hub the goblins will fight back. If there is one pixel in an area where they do not attack because you're out of their aggro range, even when still inside the town, then it is the same as using roofs to prevent guards from attacking you.
---
Best tip is to roll warrior. You thank me later.
---
HALLO BEAUTIFUL LADY U BUY CAT
---
Nah, I followed the empty coastline north from Hinterlands. Had to swim a lot.
---
&gt; but when everyone is average
---
I've been proudly average for 15 years now. Your welcome everyone.
---
I don't see a problem w/ spamming it
---
....
---
No.. either you're trolling, or you're really dense.. So I'm done.
---
And let the mage have first place in the dps chart? No sir
---
Doing this to avoid queues? Meh...
---
Doing this to keep your 8 stacks of mage water? Hell yes.
---
Dying will teach him a lesson.
---
It's an exploit to outrange the aggro radius of an NPC?
---
There's nothing intuitive about that.
---
I had about 200g from lvl 50-60
---
Just from questing and censoring stuff plus’s another 100-200g in mats  I bought off the AH
---
Can this be a new meme please?
---
They do have that.  At least in everlook, and I always assumed gadget is the same but I've only ever fought others in everlook.
---
I've run a lot of instances with the same lock in our guild, and pretty much now just ignore his health bar as it bounces wildly up and down.
---
2h tanking helps us keep threat during a time where DPS are retards that don't know what threat is, and we do significantly more damage. If I try to use a 1h and shield I'll lose aggro in seconds. A shield gives us a chunk of armour and access to shield bash and shield wall, but those aren't needed unless you massively overpull. If need be I'll put a shield on if there's a lot of damage but only after bopping everything with a much harder hitting 2h first to ensure I keep aggro.
---
I don’t think there is focus (may be an add on for it?) but I believe they’re referring to Target of Target as opposed to focus.
---
Gtfo
---
I work overnights and during my first 40 levels I was playing at around 7 am every morning after work. It was great. No queue time and no competition on quest mobs. Now that I'm trying to do more dungeons and group content I've started waking up earlier so I can play from 4-8pm before I go to work. It's a good system I've got going.
---
You make it a good damn nightmare to try to tank.  You people are stressful,  selfish and it just means more stopping for people drinking.
---
Are you Aussie? I'm pretty sure you or your friend is...
---
Yes. And if you're skeptical how about you try it so you can see?
---
Im pretty sure CS and mace stun share DR
---
Because right now everything is cheap. Or at least cheaper than it will be in a week or month when there is more gold on the server.
---
Start buying those up and socking them away, pays off in about 5 years
---
I went down to mind flay, then dropped the rest in disc until about 52. Respecced shadow at that point. Next time Id probably only go imp. swp and then into disc. Inner focus is too good.
---
Guys help. I haven't played in 4 days and I'm starting to have withdrawals :D
---
go back to retail or stop complaining please. it’s getting old.
---
As a fellow tank i agree with all but #3. we just have different tanking styles i'm usually not hitting the one i want my team to focus. Good post
---
There are a million little changing things that you can say about what you are saying now. Sorry but you really don't get the idea of classic if you comment things like this.
---
Homer Simpson: "Have any of you seen the movie 'Tron'?"
---
Blink jumping as a mage. Long falls become no barrier to your exploration, and the timing has to be right on the blink so you take no fall damage
---
The shortsightedness is your thinking everybody should only play the game your way.
---
Baddies in the comment are mad as hell lmao
---
This is hilarious and perfect. He will remember that forever you did what was needed to be done.
---
You are not a useful party member. As a former tank, I do not like you. As a former healer, I do not like you. As a current DPS, I also do not like you. You give DPS a bad rap because you want to be brain dead when you play and expect everyone else to just do the thinking for you.
---
You are not important to the group and are replaceable EASILY. Priority of Role: Healer: 50% Tank: 35% DPS: 5% each. Learn it.
---
Good argument
---
But then u can only TAB target when u run right? U cant really target a specific mob/player straight away?
---
I don't know if it's just me, but on retail (as a warlock) I just... don't run out of mana. Ever. I can rotate all my dots and spam shadowbolts and never run out. I guess people are used to that now and just don't pay attention to it. Classic is another beast altogether, you run out of mana in a hurry at the lower levels, and even at higher levels you have to be damn careful with it.
---
&gt;Pet still attacking keeps me in combat even while in FD (while im lying on the ground, this means I have to micro my pet, FD, then trap if I need to trap something)
---
This is the comment I was addressing. I said that you had to put your pet on passive, which as you can see in the video is correct. You replied "that wasn't necessary in classic". Thus, you are objectively wrong, no matter how desperate you're trying to deflect right now.
---
You are a bit [out of date](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Normalization).  Patch 1.8 normalized weapon speeds, so having a really slow weapon isn't as amazing as it was.

No tanks needed when you rolling  4 mages and healer. Been doing this since level 34 and now 50.

Did you forget the whole "no changes" part of Classic?

Cackled at that one

Got any tips which twink bg items are worth buying? so far ive stacked up a couple rakzors clubs.
---
Used to be people would only ding 40 or 60. Landmarks of the game; getting your mount, signature abilities, and hitting max level.
---
Now I see people dinging every level. That's some attention whoring every other hour.
---
&gt; Don't want to be killed by people who are better than you at the game? Don't play PvP.

Oh yes, these people are so good for standing in a spot that makes them nearly invincible. So skilled.
---
Is this on venoxis eu?
---
you just played yourself so hard
---
the post is literally explaining exactly what you are.
---
roofs are safezones because guards can't aggro to you, this is about those not being allowed, because that's not in the spirit of a PvP realm

Green protodrake was 280
---
Was a joke
---
The fact that people choose to boost characters shows they prefer it that way. It's not like having the option removes player choice.
---
Just ask a GM.
---
If it's an upgrade for someone's main spec, it should go to them first. If no one needs it, roll need for offspec.
---
You can just get horde there to kill the alliance. The issue is to get a bunch of horde on top of some building by walljumping n shit
---
Imo that’s okay the rules should be different when levelling than when at 60. Tanks and healers have to level too

I seem to have been fortunate to wind up in groups where no one cared what anyone else wanted to roll on.
---
I've never heard that before.. I think if the piece of gear has better stats for you, then you have the right to roll on it.
---
Basically:
---
Clicking release = Long walk from the release point which takes ages in some cases (looking at you Krosus at the fucking end of the bridge)
---
Not clicking release = wait for the person who got a battleres or a self-res after a wipe to mass ress everyone, which is much shorter in some cases.
---
Wetlands
---
Just /yelI at everyone saying it's over, you have the high ground, and /dance
---
Just pick which set you want to roll on prior to the start of the run and state your intention clearly.
---
I think the other day I ran SMGY 4 times in a row without winning any gear rolls from unlucky/need vs greed
---
Me, myself and I :)
---
Man everyone needs leveling gear regardless of role in a dungeon I think people forget that
---
No one with a brain levels as a tank or a healer anyways. Everyone’s a dps spec while leveling.
---
Care some elfes swimin, don let them die
---
I'm a level 46 holy priest, a competent healer I think.
---
I've failled the final boss with 4 different pugs. 
---
The only constent I've noticed is the groups were kinda low level (41/44). The worst attempt when was the group was composed of 2 mages and a warlock who went OOM early into the fight and couldnt sustain dps. I'm thinking about doing it once more. Any advise on group comp and required levels to get passed the last boss ? Thanks
---
Lmaoo punted I'm dying
---
Just need If suits your class while leveling. Thigs are a bit different at level cap, when you have chosen to commit to your spec
---
ty!
---
That's my best guess :(
---
Need on things you need
---
It’s always received poorly if you roll on sth you’re not using immediately 
---
I’d just say at the start you’re rolling on level gear 
---
Bc you’re not mainly tanking or sth 
---
Talk with people 
---
Or you just leave and have them look for a new tank for 1 or 2 hours if they’re dicks
---
We had a Warrior tank who was the party leader. He did two needs on leather gear against a hunter and rogue just cause they were slot upgrades for him and won both. Also refused to share the dungeon quests for SFK. So when we fought the final boss I let him die at the end and never rezzed just to force him to graveyard walk. Felt so empowered.
---
Main spec over off spec mostly doe
---
I too level on enhance but use an int set to heal dungeons. If I’m healing and heals loot drops, that shit is mine.
---
If an upgrade for my enhance spec drops I’ll wait and see who rolls need from the dps and then pass. If they all roll greed though, then I’ll need on it.
---
Then you can be the jerk who bypasses the half hour dungeon que by healing and still grabbing gear from the DPS who did que for half an hour. I'd be pretty pissed.
---
Its a different CD timer, thats the point. Its not a reegular mana pot.
---
I never understand the crazy grind for items you are gonna replace in 10 levels that hardly help you anyways.
---
Give all guards Death Grip, that will make it interesting.
---
The One and Only - Samwise. Such a fun guy. Met him once at blizzcon. 
---
This guy invented the name" Warcraft". Legend says he shouted it during a brainstorming session to decide the name of the game we all know about now.
---
So if you kill someone in stormwind/orgrimmar in a spot where guards wont attack you, you deserve to be banned as well? 
---
I dont care about people PvPing in Everlook because im not afk running a buy script there just to make profit. Or camping there with a low lvl secondary account.
---
I read many raiders still use the orb. I hope you people who say its bad realize, that its on a different CD timer than a mana pot. So you can swap it in, use it, swap it out and still use a pot at the same time.
---
this is fine because the guards can path to where you are, like they'll see you if you attack someone next to them
---
problem with the issue here is that guards literally can't path to people on say a roof, even if they can see them, and this is a problem
---
"He's BiS yes, but I just want to camp for him" is a lot different than "he is overhyped". No one is saying you cant play with other animals, they're saying he's BiS, and by a fairly significant margin.

I don't even think flying has anything to do with it. You usually unlocked it when you were mostly done with the world. It certainly has it's charm to stay grounded in progression zones though.
---
I remember a huge crowd of people looking forward and requesting the ability to fly back in classic and I was one of these people. In hindsight I'm not so certain anymore. Flying over the world surely is one way to explore the huge world. After having spent so much time exploring areas on the ground, being able to fly for the first time in TBC was awesome, no matter if it was only 60% speed versus the 100% you usually had with your regular mount.
---
I just hated that it got basically removed from the game after I had spend so much time collecting awesome flying mounts that just look like shit on ground. Especially the Pandaren Phoenix which took our group multiple weekends to achieve. You don't have me collect awesome stuff and then make it shit.
---
He could just rebind the space bar to move in that case. Or have the stick tap the down arrow key.
---
But then you cant have any other healer rip drood, shaman and paladin.
---
And the WoW playerbase is not at all suited to such an idea.

Nope it happens when the server might have filled while you were offline

yeah but whats the deposit like on this for a 24 hour auction?  Gotta be several gold right?
---
Thanks for sharing, exactly this is the very essence of the great gameplay, teamwork and community one experiences in Classic. In my experience, sadly, only in classic.
---
Personally, I don’t like falling behind on my meter. 
---
Now that I have triggered every sensible person in this thread, that does not permit me to be stupid. I am always behind at first because I have to wait to start casting, then cast, then deliver damage. That’s about 5ish seconds on an average pull that I am not doing *anything* where some other classes will often be building the meter. I’m okay with that. I’ll subsequently do anything within my power to get my numbers up to snuff, as long as it’s not stupid. Is going balls to the wall hammering away at FB pulling aggro? Back off then. Does the tank have huge widespread threat after 15-20 seconds? Damn right I’ll hit that blizz. I’m okay with my meters being anywhere as long as I have an excuse. Did I lose a bunch of time CCing and Counterspelling during the fight? Of course my damage isn’t gonna be top. That’s okay because less damage taken overall than given is KEY. 
---
TL;DR: The meter doesn’t make you bad, it’s tunnel vision on said meter. Maximizing DPS minimizes your chance to live in many cases. Think at *ALL* and you should be fine.
---
a snapchat screenshot lol wow
---
So only people on full servers have this problem?
---
Its wrong when the healer has aggro and the tank dies because you cant heal him with aggro 😕
---
I heal and it would be so good if everyone had to read this. Slow is smooth and smooth is quick.
---
Man I been playing classic hard since release, and tonight I decided to roll on ow with my buds and its been fun as hell. But I can't stop thinking that I could be running brd for Bis gear right now.
---
you were never meant to be able to get on those buildings in the first place.
---
if you were, it would be possible for an NPC to path there
---
That hides all the icons though?
---
Always talk with your group at the start.

Happens to me every time. My only toons are on a low/med pop realm if that matters. Just gotten used to it, thought it worked that way for everyone.

Not 100% sure on searing totem. I did some testing with searing totem where i let it attack for its full duration with and without spellpower gear. The results I got was that spell dmg increased searing totem dmg. But i would need to test further to be certain

You're not supposed to tank 90% of the dungeon bud. As soon as you accept that then you won't be stressed and the game won't be a nightmare...

You only need to be in an inn, and then you can get rester exp being online, so that shouldnt matter to much.

This is exacerbated by the stupid SM / ZF aoe farming meta. Everyone who consents and encourages that gameplay is helping train the generation of idiot DPSers we then have to put up with at 60.

Jokes on you the tank and healer are main spec dps.
---
Uuhhshit ni🅱🅱a... Sell that shit on Etsy! That looks dope
---
Tauren is the correct choice
---
Are you using WIM?
---
oceanic. but cant even battlenet is broken.
---
AoE farming Zul’Gurub as a mage. Definitely takes skill and discipline.
---
But people here told me that good healers never need to reg?! Was that not a good healer or ... did Reddit LIE to me??
---
RIP GPU, you will be missed.
---
Have a look at the endgame consumables guide on wowhead. It shows the best food for each class, and the phases they are available in. 
---
I’m pretty sure it’s +12 stam &amp; spirit at the moment, and there’s a few different recipes that can make that. 
---
Also, the pvp system isn’t coming until phase 2, and battlegrounds in phase 3, so most consumables are used for pve at the moment.
---
I played WoW for years, left it for Overwatch and bad game design. Classic came out and I stoped playing Overwatch because bad game design. 
---
At least I die something right in my life
---
I’m on ole Blanchy and it’s never been full and it does it to me every time
---
Reminds me of this;  
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esSX8zPhXSY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esSX8zPhXSY)
---
Actually farmed all of it myself, with a bit of help from a few guildies :)
---
ummm except for the large majority &lt;60, lol
---
Wish I knew this b4 getting spawn killed by like 5 hordes on the top of Tanaris cage.
---
I’d of left too.
---
Do they make it clear wether they are talking about:
---
* Getting onto the roof through "clever use of game mechanics"
---
or
---
* Just walking up there, which is what everyone can do
---
Main spec or main role in dungeon? These are different things. A feral Druid playing a healer rolling on rogue gear makes sense, but it can easily piss off the rogue. Should the feral healer be allowed to roll on cloth caster upgrades against the mage too?
---
Expect a lot of zone hopping for quests from here on out, especially if you're alliance. No zone will grant you enough quests to bang out a level in a couple hours. I would definitely sprinkle some SM farm in there.
---
I went elemental at lvl 44, making sure to pick up as much ele gear as possible 40-44
---
Respeccing was the best desicion ive made. Elemental is crazy good for leveling and its so refreshing
---
Their aggro range is definitely very small. Had a rogue (of course) go around killing lowbies in Booty Bay the other day and he would attack someone standing like 10 yards away from a guard and they wouldn't aggro. When they did they barely dealt any damage anyway (he was what looked like pretty freshly dinged 60).
---
I don't know if all years of retail guard balancing has twisted my memory but I feel like the guards are way weaker than they were.
---
How is that a joke on me? Read what I typed.
---
Only have two characters at 28 and 16, well on pace to have mount money for both. Guess I’m proud of that. 
---
Most proud of keeping up with all of their professions and cooking/aid/fishing thus far. Just like they gain 5 points in weapon skills each level, I try to make sure I’m doing at least 5 points across all of those skills between dings. 
---
I’ve done the 1-300 (well, 375 I guess) fishing grind in my Wrath days, I refuse to do it again in classic.
---
I do this all the time lmao.
---
Or just wilfully delusional
---
I think I typed it pretty clearly.
---
&gt;s
---
I dungeon grinded from lvl 20 or so, I had a looong way to go with cloth as well! Started from about halfway through honored.
---
sorry but i call bs here, looks more like you killed him before and corpse camped him
---
i’m not making an argument. i’m giving you a command.
---
Not sure I follow, from what I understand large scale world PvP would hardly be affected. If you have a big group you can just kill the guards without too much difficulty
---
For small scale fights / ganking it would deter it in guarded zones like Rachet / Booty bay but I think that's the whole point of those zones in the first place, to be relatively safe places. You can still be killed there if someone really wants you dead but your killer will pay the price
---
Filthy neutral
---
Don’t walk to the exploited area then. It’s that simple.
---
You got any recommendations for what gear I should be aiming for as ele? I’ve read on this thread that hypnotic blade is very good but stats don’t look that amazing to me...
---
How did you farm 10k runecloth or the money for it?
---
I was able to get WotLK era WoW to run on an Acer netbook with a 1.6 GHz CPU (Intel Atom) with one GB RAM. It didn't run great but it did enough to run around in Koenig zones and farm ore nodes.
---
Yeah, yeah. "Victory or death". I guess the Forsaken chose death? Talk about lame war cries, man.
---
Anyways, it's a bit funny to see how orcs have been in Azeroth like, for decades, and still haven't managed to get their heads out of their pig manure and ragged tents. Guess that banging the rocks together is hard for some.
---
That, or the whole "let's get high on demon blood and ruin our whole society" business takes so much damn time, and nobody thought how to build a real city.
---
Question for tanks as a warlock. Do you guys mind if I DoT up skull, immediately DoT up X, then go back to dpsing skull? It rarely pulls agro and when it does I can drain tank(I'll try to pull it back to tank before I start draining). I had one tank get pissy, no one died or came close to dying, but other than that no tank/healer has complained.
---
I stopped after the AFK kill, strong start to the video
---
Only if it let's you cast a spell that saves you or the party.
---
1 level away from 40 and my own mount. So i guess i’m proud of that. Also proud that i’m getting better at pvp and that my skinning is almost max level :p
---
maybe no shaman wanted it?
---
If he's going to put the effort into getting it this fast, who says he's not going to help his shammies as well?
---
Didn't know you could kill him for it. I pick pocketed the key, ran through and died at the top of the tower, ressed, stealthed, sapped the guy and looted.
---
Bfd 30ghr? Big X
---
I am not a comp player as I experienced there a lot of throwers and just toxic people. I get enough toxity in my daily life so I don't need in my games.
---
^(That's also the reason why I love to play classic!)
---
It's not a gross simplification, it'a a fact. Your arguments are mostly bullshit, because they're about limiting player choices to how you think they should play instead of how they want to play. If people want to burn out by playing a lot, it should be their choice.
---
Your point about loot making the next boss easier is also false, because no boss drops a full set of gear for every slot for every player. At most you get 2-3 items per player.
---
So yes, raid lockouts serve one purpose: to extend loot grind.
---
Doesn't most bis have +healing on it? Cloth or not if you're healing that should always be yours
---
19 and 49 are the two highest played twink brackets
---
Do it in a duel for maximum rage.
---
I'm sitting at 5k at level 57. It still seems ridiculously low.
---
Krosus was when we started using it :'D
---
This is the equivalent of the casting couch meme where the chick is surrounded by black dudes
---
I like to use high ranks on low level mobs and watch alliance players get destroyed by them.
---
It's a fucking game. Don't roll on a PvP server if you can't handle PvP. It's fun to fuck with people inside of a game. Doesn't mean you're a shithead in real life. I'm horde by the way. And I gank every little lowbie I run into.
---
The only talent of real consequence you are missing out on by not going deeper into Resto is Mana Tide. That totem isn't necessary in 5-mans or even Blackrock Spire. Other than some fringe cases (the Hakkar event with an inexperienced group, accidental chain pulls), fights just don't go long enough to require it. Farm up some runes instead if you're concerned.
---
Holy shit, the people in that comment section are actually retarded. This has fuck all to so with Investors, this is to prevent idiots and scammers from Spamming everyones whispers
---
I experienced the same. I don't do dungeons, I am specced shadow, but for two players, I'll do dungeons and heal them
---
I had a below average one, and a great one yesterday.
---
We completed the run both times, but the great one ended up on my friends list, so I can find him again :)
---
I ran a fire mage in vanilla 5 mans.  The burstiest of burst.  I ran it without a dps meter and I stacked +fire damage, much to my tank's chagrin.  I learned how to wait to open up.  Dont' use the meters, learn through feel then use the meters.
---
Controls the runecloth bag recipe, or so I've been told. The recipe is super expensive as she is the only person to sell it and it's highly contested.
---
Yeah that guy did not seem thrilled to announce it at all. Grade A dickhead.
---
Progressive Gadgetzan guards care about the environment in Azeroth, cow and kodo farts is a real problem and shammy littering
---
No it’s not, blizzard broke it days ago.
---
I tried to solo this and it just didnt drop, found a group and we almost had to clear the entire thing before we got it. we also wiped twice because someone went through a doorway and got aggro from half a room.
---
What’s your name! I’ll meet you somewhere and 1v1 you
---
&gt;A lot of people enjoy the clean - slate approach to games. Look no further than PoE, when a new league comes out, 
---
It isn't nearly as tedious or time consuming to level a character in PoE. I've went from 1-80 in 4-8 hours before and had a blast doing it.
---
Classic leveling on the other hand isn't something i could see myself doing over and over again like in PoE. The dated quests can be absolutely painful in multiple places.
---
somehow i never need to look for a tank.
---
oh yeah i tank myself...
---
considering the amount of warriors it always baffles me why no one tanks for themselves. the common furry warrior rather spends 2h lfg than just tank
---
True
---
Maybe he logged out
---
I've been leveling with daggers exclusively (30 atm), and I've been doing fine. You don't need to optimize everything! I also put 10 points into the stealth talents and can still fight up to 3 mobs if cooldowns are up.
---
\&gt; We have lots of ways to take care of it. 
---
More healers need to realize this. I solo a lot and almost never drink for mana and have plenty of food, some of which I use for Well Fed buff and need to eat it anyway. I use Life Tap religiously and usually can Life Drain, Healthstone, use a potion, or eat myself to full hp while staying out of the frey and letting my pet handle a mob. 
---
Not to mention it regens pretty quickly with Demon Skin/Armor and our high Spirit. If I LT down to 60% health it'll probably have time to regen by the time I get hit next, no need to waste your mana healing me to 100%.
---
On the other side, Zandalar Tribe Rppvp EU Realm. I started as horde, it was fun, people were wholesome to each other. You got buffs without asking, some light RP here and there but not much happening in terms of events. But it was still a good experience. 
---
I then suddenly had an urge to try alliance, so I deleted my 3 lvl 24 horde characters ( don't ask me why, I just did it with no hesitation) and started a human warrior.
---
General chat was extremely toxic, I barely got random buffs from people, it all felt really selfish. Maybe it wasn't as bad as I'm describing but it didn't felt right.
---
I now regret deleting my horde toons.
---
Not hard cuz my leveling buddy is a tank :p
---
I swapped from feral to resto at 49... WAY less stressful. My fav groups include a feral dps and shaman... so much utility. Add a mage for CC and we have so much control! I literally am starting to become friends with these people so I don't have to group with random numb nuts in LFG chat! Lol
---
Dude this is so wrong. Sometimes it takes so long to find a tank that people will be willing to try it out.
---
It's like when Raziel would talk eloquently in soul reaver.
---
15 years ago feign death into ice trap worked.
---
It only gets worse unless you invest talents in protection, but nobody would do that while leveling becuz your damage will suffer from it
---
Ret weapon\*
---
I love hinterlands
---
So being a coward and a pussy is against the rules.
---
Cool.
---
Just don't go healing while you're in melee. 
---
It will be viable until Mara/ST, at which point nature resistance/immunity will cause problems.
---
You guys know mages have slow fall right?
---
I'm on one of the transfer servers and happens every time.
---
Bought them for 1,4g/stack in tradechat and snagged every cloth of the AH that went for less than 7s each, so "only" cost me like 600-700g.
---
Got most money from making Devilsaur gear for profit (both with farmed mats and straight up buying mats). Made some from farming felcloth when the crater was too busy. Also made a non insignificant sum from buying limited stock patterns from vendors and selling to AH (most notably Devilsaur Gauntley pattern and Wicked Leather Gloves pattern).
---
My entire mana pool is not enough for 5 buffs as a mage
---
And here I am still without a mount
---
That's crazy that it'd get removed for griefing the opposite faction, since it's completely voluntary and you can't talk unless they accept your request.
---
After running SM Arms 4 times on my warrior, I won all of my items. Gotta admit, I felt a little bad leaving after.
---
You're leveling too slowly, the baddies are catching up to you, gotta level faster so you can meet the good players at 60 before the bad ones catch up.
---
Yah I had an alliance gank me during the fight with the elite. Very annoying
---
You farmed all 8 ingots by yourself? Incredible!
---
Coming from Nost as a combat rogue it's refreshing to see Blade Flurry damage work correctly on multi-targets.
---
So I can report the level 60 orc hunters trying to 3 shot people from the water in booty bay bc the guards won’t aggro?
---
Guards shouldn't even be a thing on pvp realms.
---
I cleared him.
---
I got hearthstone every 15 min.
---
This post was made by shaman gang
---
Return orcs to Draenor. Damn illegal aliens needs to be deported.
---
Sunder armor.  Revenge as you can.  Demoralizing shout is basically your only aoe threat.  It probably wont compete with mage aoe though.  Just aggro what you can, a few loose mobs aren't a big deal while leveling.
---
They actually nerfed Legion Dalaran. They got rid of all the portals except the one to your Capital city
---
you know you can use gouge with a mouseovermacro? 
---
also imp gauge is (after blind) the best "oh shit im out" button for rogues, without even needing ressources from your bag.
---
It’s from 2005 :D
---
why would you level as a dagger rogue at level 1-20?
---
no money to repair your gear lol.
---
No, dude, I played on Nost and Light's Hope. They were both really inaccurate in a lot of ways and had a lot of bugs. It was just subtle shit that a lot of people didn't notice. Some of the bugs/inaccuracies I'd point out in general chat or on the forums and people would argue with me that it was how Vanilla worked. Lo and behold, Classic beta comes out and all that shit I was telling people was inaccurate doesn't work that way in Classic and Blizzard has to keep adding them to their "not a bug" list because private server players won't stop reporting them as bugs.
---
Loot tables, mob spawn rates, mob wander behaviors, quest item locations and spawn behaviors, resource nodes, weather frequency, rage, the pace and feel of combat, the feedback from combat, literally all of that felt wrong on private servers. Most people just literally don't remember how Vanilla was. They've been playing private so long that that's what feels right to them. They think modern private servers are good and accurate because they're comparing them to private from like 8+ years ago and of course it's light-years ahead of that, and it's sincerely impressive how close they've gotten it, but it's still at like 85% where Classic is more like 97%.
---
I mean, I haven't wiped in a single dungeon sitting at 45, but please tell me why I'm bad. I have taken sub par dps, this post was inspired by a dps warr that did less on the meters than me in uld while I tanked and said I pulled too slow.
---
"she" ? Isn't that sexist?
---
this happened to me yesterday, but i swam infront of the boat. while it moved through me, I started jumping and I got stuck at the end of the boat and still travelled to ratchet

I'm an adult lol. And you seem to be the only one who finds the word "crass".
---
oof, posting layering exploits on reddit is a bold move. gz though
---
Two priests. Me as a DPS on top and a healer at the bottom.
---
But also all mana classes in general.
---
I HAVE TO BE ATTACKED TL GENERATE RAGR YOU FUCKS I CANT DO THAT IF YOU ALREADY HAVE AGGRO 0.1 SECONDS INTO THE FIGHT
---
Thats.... bronze?
---
Only Alliance players (Gnome rogues specifically) have killed me while walking around questing.
---
No other Alliance player has even thrown a glance in my direction. The Gnome rogues hop off their damn mounts during their patrols to kill level 26 little old me.
---
Jesus man GIVE UP
---
I farmed gold/herbs/mines and sold a lot of stuff. With my gold I looked in world chat to buy 7 Sulfuron Ingots and Arcanite Bar transmutes. My guild provided me with 1 Ingot.
---
Yes they did say that. But those addons worked destpite blizzard stating that they shouldn't.
---
This was a tank, even worse.
---
Yes sure, but we are talking about leveling here. Where crit is low anyway so who gives. While leveling you should always go for strenght.
---
If you see a hunter trying to tame an animal, and it's not tagged, is it considered bad form to kill it?
---
I gank people all the time. I never corpse camped anyone for hours.
---
By the way, this guy's not even banned for the length of time, it's just because he used "terrain exploitation" aka evaded the guards.
---
ive been thinking of rolling an rppvp alt, i played on lightninghoof back in the day, was always good fun
---
Like hell it is. It's on whoever is taking damage. I can try to minimise overheals and only use the most mana efficient spells but at some point the mage tanking just takes too much and the mana runs out
---
Because you're slow LOL its like driving your car 20 mph under the speedlimit and calling yourself a good driver because you've never crashed.  You're the grandma in the left lane of wow dungeons that's probably why you're 45
---
I would love to see all these frost mages try to get their loot drops at 60.
---
Go ahead, make another one.
---
Hey friend! 
---
Go to Westfall as stated earlier, or grind GREEN lvl mobs, over and over again. At low lvl it usually only takes 150 kills or so. Make sure you get around 90-100xp per mob and if you get more that's awesome.
---
Whenever you travel from point A to point B, kill all the beats and humanoids you meet/aggro, and dont take the road either.
---
Yea you slow down abit and some of them only give you 43 xp but the goal is to get to 60 right? Everything adds up, and all this extra mob grinding and xp makes questing easier also.
---
Do you have First aid?
---
I highly recommend First aid while playing warrior,healing in-combat is awesome, it also smoothes out the grinding of mobs (shorter breaks, bandage up and charge in).
---
Best of luck!
---
Edit: I’d be using agi gear with wolfshead, crowd pummeler, 3pts in natural shape shifter and 5 pts in furor.
---
Slower weapons still generally have higher damage ranges, which is what makes them better for sinister strike.
---
Someone already put a bid on it for 40!
---
Im all for PvP i gank i get ganked its life oh well but i hate when ppl do the emotes during a fight it gets on my nerves good for you fuck those ppl.
---
I guess you could use sweet summer child to imply ignorance but the phrase actually means someone who doesn't understand hardship, i.e. born in the summer and not the winter.   
---
The saying you actually wanted to say was, "bless your heart."
---
Honestly, removing the debuff limit and balancing the specs so people can actually play what they want (while keeping it #classic) would go a long way I think.  Hell, removing the debuff limit would allow people to actually play the game in raids.  People complain about all the pruning that happened but we're on the other side right now where we literally have to spreadsheet who can use what abilities.
---
Use moveanything to figure out what the frame is called, then make its opacity 0
---
already got a bid for 40!
---
They did this for a reason so that you dont get stuck in a 15000 queue and cannot change servers, and give more incentive to start on other servers. This was changed in week 2. Im sure they will revert once queues are gone.
---
Guy i was responding to was heavily implying i had some sort of saltiness going on for not getting BT(as at the time it was me+2 other people in the chain.) I don't even play hunter. Was largely just stating alternatives for those more time strapped originally. I honestly don't care about BiS at all.
---
Slappers unite
---
Yup. Welcome back to the real Vanilla.
---
Its more common to let the tank roll on dps gear too especially on 2 handers since those are only palas shamans an warriors can use and they shouldnt take a dps space. If you see a group were they dont let the tank to roll for these just leave.
---
I've been dealing with retail syndrome in almost every run I tank.
---
Mages will blizzard every pack of mobs the moment I charge in
---
Hunters have their pets growl turned on.
---
Priests will shield me before I go in.
---
Druids will pre-hot me before I go in. 
---
These are definitely my largest grievances with tanking BRD+ right now.
---
It is for the class colors and levels.
---
It's Prat, u/HatesTheHivemind
---
Lol I need classic back so bad.
---
You cant until BWL
---
Priest suddenly materializes at 1/2 health. OP was camping the priest, who rezzed and went on the offensive.
---
Shamans are healers, why would they wear this?
---
Lmao SM Lib and Cath and ZF if you wanna maximize exp per hour your 3 mages and how they interact with your healer are what carries
---
Exactly lol
---
Kill guards at Revantusk Village until halfway through honored, then turn in Morrowgrain/runecloth to exalted.
---
logging out and back in with remote desktop is the way to do it. just log out in a safe area and its instant. havent been DCd yet
---
Aye represent alliance yojamba! Fuck the horde
---
You mean hunter weapon right?
---
I'm cool with the rogue claiming the chest if he/she wants
---
Yup!
---
Sure do whatever you want
---
731g on AH? What in the actual frak?
---
Actually some chinese streamer has had it for around a week already
---
Afaik logging out leaves your character in world for 20 seconds
---
This wouldnt lower the amount of tanks/healers, this would remove them.
---
Oh, you big you stroong... you stupid xd
---
You need to watch the video before you post man! You need ore from BWL. The video also states you learn smelting in MC, but you learn that in BWL too. So not for a long time
---
There aren't really situations where you'd want and be able to powershift in pvp even if you specced for it and used a ton of consumables.  You can't stand up to a physical damage dealer in cat form and and no caster is going to let you powershift like they're a raid boss lol
---
you mean birthday?
---
Let’s see how it plays out cotton
---
I saw his face on warceaft 3. Maybe it's an Easter egg about it
---
?
---
people have been sending me their gold on Shazzrah... lol   
---
dont pray on peoples downfall. its pathetic
---
i don’t understand why people like you are trying to ruin classic by turning it into exploit-free retail.
---
Honestly this always made me sad about sulfuras, there's nobody who does decent damage who can use it
---
But effective. There is nothing wrong with being efficient, please enlighten me on your experiences with generating more rage for faster pulls with less drops in threat generation. I would love constructive criticism.
---
Dont feel like makin a new thread so just gonna ask here. Is there a skill cap for disenchanting highlvl items? So if I drop Mining and have enchanting, can I still disenchant high lvl items?
---
There are many other situations where it's wrong as well, but I think we shouldn't interrupt the circlejerk until these guys have unloaded onto each other.
---
My point is this: if you actually believe that DPS aren't, somehow, a part of the holy trinity and are always at fault for taking damage, you are a bad player. As bad as many DPS-players, to be fair.
---
Counterpoint: Polearms are cool.
---
I don't see how hard it is for you to understand that if you sit on top of a fucking building where guards CAN NOT REACH YOU, it is considered exploiting by blizz and you should get punished for it. It doesn't matter where it is, it's scummy as fuck and exploiting.
---
&gt; dont pray on peoples downfall. its pathetic
---
What's pathetic is begging, having your post removed three times and then posting again.
---
Genius!
---
Focus targets don't exist :(
---
Layers have nothing to do with queues. It’s to help questing. Most people are going to be done leveling. I’m already levering an alt and most zones only have a handful of people.
---
also if you pop orcr acial and deathwish I'm assuming you dont want heals
---
I have no idea how you tank boss I'm just going off this stupid thread where you cry about people wanting to go fast and form the almost certainly correct conclusion that you're super bad at the game.
---
Queue? Sounds like a retail thing
---
Hey man, some of us are still out here playing the game old-school.
---
~~Not me though, I'm drawing dumb memes instead of grinding~~
---
Do this with rogue poisons and other reagents as well. Doesn't hurt to throw in some stacks of meat for your cat.
---
Are they gonna stop people sitting in un-reachable places in warsong gulch aswell while holding the flag?
---
Best in slot for feral tank fire res gear
---
If you’re gonna role on off-spec you mention it on entry to the group. 
---
Thankfully I’ve been both tank and healer where this has never been an issue.
---
At the end of the day, there is no question about it. Hybrid specs are sub optimal. That's the way it's always been , you can't change that or people's minds.
---
Yes , you have people going the extra mile and playing these specs , putting up guides etc but they are also playing in a guild that understands what they are doing and accept it.
---
I'd say that spriest is okay for raiding, middle of the pack. So, if you go the extra mile to farm the gear you need as well as spending time to find a guild that will accept you, you can do it.
---
With priest mond control up, yes. The priest controlling the opponent can get one instant cast spell off on them, then the mc breaks.
---
Haha, yeah when there's a kind of tacit truce between people who just want to get the fucking quest done and move on, there's always a temptation to eliminate competition. However, once you do that you're totally fair game, you started it! I like to get into the warcraft as much as any rogue, but there are also times I just wanna finish some shit and I get hangry when someone wants to fuck it up
---
Every priest who ever used PWS needs to be banned. Clearly they were exploiting. Bye, thanks for playing.
---
SOLVED - I Will leave this post up because I saw a lot of people having the same issue.
---

A World of Warcraft license is required. If you don't have any, create a starter from the account management then relog on the Blizzard App.
---
For whatever reason you have to navigate to this specific page first and create a starter account before you will be given the option to download WoW.
---
Far too few rogues do this, it works really well. Time I’m done, tank has aggro, I have cash.
---
Tldr and game devs probably won't waste their time reading this manifesto.
---
Good job dude.  I'm sure you're very good at the game.  Bye
---
yeah. garrote and rupture scale purely with AP and arent affected by armor values, so its raw dmg. great for kiting warriors and palas.
---
Always the hardest group member to find. If you do roll tank you'll have a stupid easy time finding groups.
---
Faction/server?
---
We are personally allowing one shadow priest who knows his shit in our roster, no one has taken the spot yet tho.
---
Alliance/Mograine EU

My tanking policy is this:

1) if dps pulls aggro once, recover and give them a polite warning 
---
2) if same dps pulls aggro again, let them die so they can learn the hard way then pull the mob once they’re dead.
---
Most of the time it humbles them. Rarely they ragequit
---
No
---
Had high level horde camping on the darkshire buildings to kill people levering there. So they were breaking the rules and should be reported?
---
It looks like you dindt subscribe to wow. Try it for free now and then subscribe 1 month
---
As a Warrior grinding away... thank you for these memes.
---
What addon you using for vendor prices and stuff?
---
100% not. p2 isnt TBC
---
I was the dwarf priest In this video, I had about 3% mana at the start of the fight so yeah haha
---
done u on SHazzrah?
---
Totally with you. I just think most peoples ego will stand in their way and therefore poison the group though.
---
Hmm i could swear they shared since i'm currently leveling as mace spec. Lemme test it
---
If the first guy got lucky, this one maybe won't get away with it, you are obviously the stupid one here
---
my nelf disc priest puts up some silly numbers with pain up and starshards in between tank heals
---
expensive, but fun to flex on our dps when we aren’t cleaving
---
Dear tanks who aren't this guy:  
---
Learn from him, and pull to my damn totems.  
---
Yours truly:
---
Shaman everywhere.
---
As a Warrior who should be grinding away... they're more fun than harpies
---
P.S. I know where to drop totems, because I, too, am a tank.
---
As a healer I am always healing instances that are slightly higher than what I am probably ready for.
---
Which means I have to be zoned the fuck in and the second anyone dies it's my fault... 
---
I'm a fucking resto druid gladiator. Bitches - if you're dying from heals it says alot more about you than it does me
---
For Enhancement, it's all about agility, for Flurry uptime. It also helps dodge for solo play, where armor is important as well. For example, I wouldn't blame a shaman in their 30s for rolling on Herod's helm, as the bonus crit also helps their Flurry uptime, but they shouldn't be getting the shoulder piece. Rolls on intellect or spirit pieces, especially cloth, should be considered secondary (I'd say "offspec," but shaman can heal fine in any talent setup while leveling).
---
For Elemental, it's spellpower and intellect. Elemental uses a shield when soloing and mail itemization is very bad, so you will see Elemental shaman rolling on cloth and leather. Pieces heavy on spirit are secondary--even full Resto shaman aren't necessarily looking for spirit.
---
Nope, fuck your OCD.
---
I found out yesterday after being camped by a couple of 60 with my 29 lock that running to another graveyard makes you respawn with sickness to the closest graveyard to your body.
---
Farming gold to buy an item still qualifies as farming it yourself.
---
I don’t understand, what nature damage would be resisted?
---
I’m not earth shocking, just auto attacking with windfury weapon while I heal.
---
Pick one and level it, you cant even full get a grasp on a class and how it works until at least 40. If you dont like it, level an alt later.
---
Not at all
---
How is it unreachable if the flag carrier got there?
---
This is about unreachable for city guards.
---
It's effectively botting so yeah.
---
Wouldn't "off-spec" technically be NOT the healer/tank one while leveling?
---
Im a hunter so sadly cant do much for healing, but at least I got aspect of the pack
---
I’m a 53 ret pally atm and even I have issues joining groups for dungeons that are not even end game. Some people are really strict about comps it seems. I’m playing ret cause all the other time I spend alone questing would suck if I wasn’t ret. Anyway, every dungeon is pretty easy with all the advantages we have in 2019 so I dunno why people are being so strict. If we can clear easy why do they care what we play?
---
Looks like Dwarf Fortress
---
U do realise u can't drink in combat
---
I'm on every realm begging in stormwind!
---
Absurdity of the situation, ok. It's just a nice gesture from  blizzard to one of their own.
---
Biggest crybaby post I’ve ever seen. Guy took me as someone mid twenties or older. Not so sure anymore. Age is twelve or really burnt hard, so hard got him all hot. Take a cold shower amigo.
---
You know that pathetic sounds gnomes make when they die? It's like a Tauren stomps the last breath out of them.
---
That sound alone is reason enough to play horde. I love it
---
They’re trying to pad metres, skull dies too fast... except when everyone is doing the same thing.
---
If you think the military was worshipped after Nam you may want to do some reading up on that...
---
Its a terrible weapon for pve.   Its pretty shit for warriors in PVP as well, but is a good ret/enhance pvp weapon.
---
Who misspells alliance repeatedly?
---
&gt;Allinace
---
Thanks for that, very good info there. How do I start the Princess chain? I can't find much info about it.
---
I am a shaman and most of my dmg is based on windfury proccs and auto attacks. There are sometimes mobs like the bats in Kral which silence you. Sometimes, I do dmg and use bandages on the tank but when the tank is a bit lower and takes more dmg, then I will stay in the background and cast heals. I was just worried if some people might look down on me if I search for a safe spot instead of joining the frontline.
---
Lol fuck that as a tank I need both gear at level 60. You should be lucky I even invited you peasant DPS. Have like 10 in my DMs waiting to take your place.
---
legend
---
Oh lol alright tysm!!!
---
Find a roleplaying guild. If not, try to make your own. Form the Stormwind Guard, Make a Lordaeron guild, Pirates or Bandits, Scarlet Crusade, Silver Hand, etc. There should be some people who would love to form a community if you ask around.
---
As it is we are doing house cleaning in our guild about 30-40% of the people are no longer active (5+ days offline no on-leave message).  There is just a huge number of people who started so we still have a lot left.
---
The heck.
---
I was under the impression speed was normalized in 1.12 and pets were for cosmetic and ability.
---
Even on private realms, and told to me by fellow hunters in game last week.
---
Its cause they're holding back to allow tank to hold aggro.
---
&gt;We are personally allowing one shadow priest who knows his shit in our roster
---
So you're still min/maxing.
---
And to think, people used to have a go at me for doing this.
---
It's a win for everyone.
---
and for some reason there are 3 truesilver nodes there that nobody can mine since it is meant for you to be mid 20s when you go there.
---
Wait are you trying to tell me that yet another tank bitching on reddit is oblivious and bad at the game?  Say it ain't so.
---
These tanks are always desperately seeking validation on reddit after someone calls them a bad tank and reddit supplies that validation by assuming the tank is good lol
---
Tank has always been the de facto leader, it's just the way the game's been and makes sense seeing as they dictate the pulls. 
---
Have fun stroking your dicks off together and raiding with the big boys.
---
Exactly. If you want to be able to ride a scarab outside of AQ, you'll have to be on a good guild AND to be honored by it.
---
That looks like wailing caverns. I wonder what those warlocks were thinking? My druid tank (could that make the difference?) complimented me about our run there. He asked me what I was I doing for I topped dps and never got aggro off him. I thought it was the easy way of doing slow and steady damage through DoTs.
---
Maybe we just had some very inefficient dps along the run for me to do that well?
---
That reminds me to go back and kill some low level horde there. Thanks
---
that's talking specifically about rooftop camping. if you've ever seen anything about angwe it'd become pretty clear this is not consistent with how it's been moderated
---
Sure. No doubt they would get banned. And I get that blizzard makes their rules however they want. I just really don't like them applying honor rules instead of patching or leaving it alone.
---
It's rough out there in the pug streets, most tanks that are worth their salt(imo) would rather not put, yet are trying to find people that they mesh well with. Retail has left a bad connection to tanks imo, tanking is a mindset and takes a different playstyle. We aren't dps who also have lots of health, we have a whole different mechanic that is entirely ours and a good portion of players don't know about.
---
Sorry man, wrong conversation.  I got twisted up.
---
I need this haha
---
You don't have to heal the lock when they're life tapping. We've got life drain, we've got health stones, we've got good health regen from demon armour, we've got the first aid skill. Warlocks were designed to life tap, and have the skills to cope with it!
---
This is for the horde version of the quest. The alliance version is much simpler :)
---
gz
---
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY MORR PEOPLE DON'T GET THIS.  Yes I'm currently terrible but waiting the extra second is going to make the run so much smoother and more enjoyable.
---
it’s world of warcraft, not neutral town is peacecraft. go back to retail if you want your safe space.
---
First rule of investing:

According to Wowhead those Quilboars have a 21% drop chance for wool, the Syndicate in Durnholde in Hillsbrad have a 41-49% chance.

---
Bit of an ignorant comment.
---
Are there better 2h Warrior weapons? Yeah, there's one - Bonereaver's Edge, which every other Warrior (of which there are probably many) will also want. Until HWL/BWL weapons become available in Phase 2/3 respectively, it's going to be a very competitive drop that many will fight for - giving Sulfuras to one of them reduces that competition. Keep in mind too that BRE isn't nearly as good for Orcs as it would be for a Human, due to the lack of weapon skill. That puts the two roughly on par depending on whether or not enemy armor is reduced to zero.
---
Hand of Rag is also arguably better in PvP; even though BRE still has a powerful proc, the proc rate is low and the much higher direct damage on HoR is more reliable, while Mace spec is not insignificant.
---
On the other hand, is it a powerful weapon for Enh Shaman? Absolutely, but you could just as easily argue that Enh Shaman aren't really there for dealing damage, so it's a much weaker upgrade for them. That said, is it more beneficial to them in the long run? Probably, but not knowing how this guild does loot, there are several other factors which may contribute.
---
* If they used DKP, the Shaman simply may not have wanted it as badly as the Warrior, and not knowing the guild's priorities, they may have found that acceptable (for the above stated reasons).
---
* Many guilds make the creator buy Sulfuron Ingot drops from the guild (not to mention having to buy extras from other guilds), which can be inordinately expensive (especially this early in the content cycle), and whatever Shaman who may have wanted it might not have wanted to invest that much in it.
---
* Again, PvP and competition are factors which should not be ignored. You should not just expect Bonereavers, Spinal Reapers, or Deathbringers to fall from the sky.
---
**TLDR**: Hand of Rag is much better than you think, and it is absolutely a competitive Warrior weapon, particularly this early in Phase 1.
---
Wtf? There is camera shaking!???
---
Ferals also bring Leader of the Pack. and other offtanks/dps warriors can apply sunder.
---
this might be a stupid ass question.. but what should i focus on for resto, +healing or increased healing done by spells or both. what is better? I also see alot of bis gear is x mana per 5 sec. which doesnt sound like a lot.
---
I always ask if it's okay for me to roll on gear for my off spec. If someone who's in spec needs it I let it go to them.
---
You can believe what you want. It's literally not allowed based on the ToS. They may not enforce it but that's their choice.

---
Mana totems make up for the fact they have no passive combat regen talents, they are undeniably good healers and most raids will have one dedicated purely to just spamming rank one Healing Wave on the tank during raids to maintain ancestral healing.
---
No but the scarab will
---
I'd feel like shit if I had my dps players waiting ten seconds every pull. Sounds like a l2p issue.
---
&gt;I quite honestly expect this to get downvoted
---
Happy to help.
---
I didnt know you had a birds eye view of the situation yesterday.
---
Can agree with this. Playing horde on westfall and hearing doomsayers claim we're the least populated horde server because they thought A:H balance = population is annoying (We're #24/39 in horde pop counting last 2 weeks of characters).
---
Shazzrah-EU
---
Ooo nooo
---
Dear tanks,
---
- Stop reserving gear because "ill leave if i dont get it, gl finding another tank".
---
- Start using markings, and hotkey them.
---
- Stop charging mobs to engage, pull from distance. 
---
- Stop throwing a fit when you haven't said anything prior when it comes to instructions.
---
- Stop playing tank if you simply can't.
---
- Being a tank requires to you lead the group for a good amount. If you're not up to give people instructions, don't fucking cry and stop playing tank.
---
OP thinks if himself as a representative. He's not. He applies anecdotals to generalise all tanks.
---
Well, I was already in barrens being horde and leveling. Only place I could have gotten it at my low level without dying endlessly. But that’s good to know :D
---
Solo tanking your job isnt to peel for dps
---
Other dps can help with that
---
that’s ridiculous. leveling on a pvp server is not supposed to be enjoyable.  it’s supposed to be miserable with moments of immense satisfaction that come from surviving
---
Blizz would have banned him already of he did.
---
Don't need a birds eye view to know you're oblivious when you're telling a story and the details are impossible.
---
The legacy of the forsaken beard continues!
---
I mean you are objectively wrong but alright.
---
Commenting to check back later for a solution.
---
It's always true.
---
i use the two side buttons on my mouse to strafe left and right, so all the movement is done on my right hand, leaving my left free to use spells
---
I don't know but wasn't this guy inside the inn in an area where there are no guards? Sure is pathethic to kill lowlevels for an hour but this wasn't abuse of terrain or buildings in that sense, right?
---
also shorter duration. so it is funny and not annoying af
---
Spite should be much, much larger. 😎
---
This happened to us on the second dwarf yestetday
---
Can you run straight to the Archadaes and just farm him? Or do you need to kill everyone else in order to open the doors?
---
dont worry. im level 47 priest and have no mount (altough in my defence i can say im doing raid consumables on alchemy so should just dedicate 1 day to farm the cash. also few g member has loans they havent pay yet)
---
Also as healer you can say you dont need mount that bad tbh since mostly healing dungeons. unless its trihard zf gy farm
---
27 days after wow classic launched. I smell layers.
---
Tanks are really just there to group up mobs, taunt the stragglers &amp; casters, and use interrupts on mob casts. If they're good they can make it faster for an AoE xp farm group, but this pretty much only applies to druids and warriors. I say this as someone who mains druid/warrior and plays a mage and a priest as alts. Also, warlocks can use their eye spell to make large pulls as well, and effectively tank/AoE better than a warrior or druid for xp runs.
---
My guild and I were raiding Gruul's Lair once back in TBC. GM showed up to name and shame our Warlock who had put a ticket in about not being able to complete a quest. The quest item was in his bank, and not his bags. GM told him so in front of the whole raid.
---
Turned us all into leper gnomes, put down a bunch of disco balls, turned himself into a massive dragon and peaced out.
---
he'd be banned if he exploited layers to kill MC bosses more than once
---
And what does your single anecdote prove other than that one mage didn't get punished for breaking the rules?
---
This dungeon is so good for exp and loot Ive been grinding, never failed the last boss.
---
Wrong about? I never said you couldn't tank with a 2Hander
---
For the love of God keep these coming!
---
so quickly ?  its been almost a month since release  with over 600+ hours that u could have played  not to mention he probably didn't even do it solo
---
lol @ overshield
---
If healer isn't oomin the tank is going too slow or dps is subpar (which should lead to oom due to increased damage intake) . There's always a bottleneck for clear speed and it should be mana every time
---
Totally inadequate, completely insecure, paranoid, neurotic.
---
It’s a pleasure!
---
Well, don't I know that better than anyone. Besides I looked at your reddit history, you dont really seem to be a mr positive. So I'm gonna take that with me n just "assume" you just want to be a negative nancy. My story above about the charge &gt; bloodlust &gt; Thunder clap and then the 5 dotted targets. For me in the situation I see I lose aggro before I have even swapped to defensive stance or finished my rotation to keep the aggro. Which means that the warlocks didnt even focus on the main target. I saw target 1 and 2 leave me and the warlocks spamming dots on all the targets. I can go into more detail as its pretty fresh but I honestly dont want to discuss with you cause you're most likely already set your opinion in stone based on something I might've described loosely. Like I didnt mention in my post that there was 2 warlocks so ofc the 5 dotted targets seemed impossible.
---
God, you're actually a pathetic human
---
People shouldn't be strict about comps, all classes add to utility it should be about cookie cutter speed runs.
---
Was thinking of going Engineering. 
---
Heaps of perks , plus a mailbox mid raid if I run out of arrows haha.
---
Being safe in a spot that isn't covered by a guards aggro range is not an exploit...
---
There are several areas in a town where this is possible just by simply walking up and standing.
---
If it was done by wall jumping on top of roofs etc then yes, that is where it would be a punishable offense, but simply standing in a safe area is not.
---
The original post was specifically in referenser to abusing geometry and wall jumping to get on top of roofs like in gadgetzan where guards will end up evading and then resetting.
---
yeah but it should be left at disdain, not getting blizz to levy the banhammer.
---
All depends on how much the potions and elixirs are worth. Higher tier herbs will always be in demand for raid elixirs and such.
---
So take a look at the components that go into the best craftable elixirs to have an idea of which herbs are the best to keep or sell.
---
... yes that doesn't make what unsaid untrue or edgemasters not good. For someone to say "they are only preraid bis" is misleading and false
---
I do the same as priest
---
iT's SeLf-dOcUmEnTiNg
---
Warlock here, former tank but rerolled. And yes, DPS needs to hold their horses when it comes to nuking.
---
For my warlock i apply corruption and CoA to the main target first, cycle next add and apply the same until all mobs are dotted.
---
Immolate you should be careful with, some tanks can handle immolate on all mobs, some can’t. But it’s usually fine on main target. 
---
For tanks, feel free to mark your main target pre pulls, helps me as warlock dps to know where i can put the most amount of dots to ensure a safe and fast kill.
---
I haven't seen data on Windfury being significantly better than Rockbiter at fast speeds, where can I find these numbers?
---
Quite a few of the buildings are also guard free zones.
---
It's how they cope
---
Also make sure to collect all the dungeon quests. [I use this to collect ‘em all.](https://classicdb.ch)
---
The arena rooftop isn't even safe from guards if you attack people near one. They will knock you off with their guns in a couple of shots.
---
So I'm curious what the GM meant when saying guards can't reach him?
---
Considering the droprate, to be realistic it would means that every single raiding guild on the server got lucky, and accepted to give/sell/loan a rare and expensive item.
---
I'm only level 42 so far, but man I can't fkn wait to get to wpl. Such a great zone, just love the atmosphere.
---
I need 33g for my mount hmm....
---
The gadgetzan ones can only shoot 20 or 30 yarda, so if you can outrange them it doesnt matter:
---
Make a char with him
---
People exploited layers in dungeons to reset bosses.
---
Why is "listening to what GM's say" equivalent to Retail?
---
Go back to your buggy private server
---
Sounds like a big journey! I’ll deffo have to make sure I get stuck I to that one.
---
WTF. That's incredible!
---
I'm level 22.
---
Wait, there are groupes without a mage?
---
As mentioned in the post I take all consumables to the raid and going the extra mile but apparently there are no allowances..
---
Only costs 60 mana 
---
Easily spammable
---
/assist
---
Also, if you get aggro from tank don't run away from like a mad person - run towards your tank and wait for them to build up threat again.
---
Sometimes nuking enemy with least amount of HP is better than trying to damage EVERY enemy in sight
---
ITT: scores of people with no understanding that there is a margin between 'asshole behavior' and 'bannable behavior.' which is an even larger margin when that ban comes with no warning and extremely flimsy explanation. not to mention the 'asshole behavior' is merely PVPing randoms on an opt-in PVP server with the odds stacked insurmountably in his favor. the abundant whining here in the comments should be rightfully relegated to powerless salty tears, rather than celebrating the unjust ban blizz handed out to coddle them. Angwe was a legend and if blizz kneecaps the potential for a repeat that sure goes against #nochanges if you ask me
---
I bet he was absolutely fuming that you sheeped him just before his Well Fed buff came on and he had to eat another one.
---
It's nothing to figure out really. it's a bug that i've reported but I doubt anything will be done to fix it. that's blizzard. If 100 million people aren't complaining then they won't even realise.
---
That being said you can still use /petattack and all pet commands.. but there's no way to tell what abilities you will get from the enemy player
---
I'm aware, but this item needs a single drop of a single boss, is it really so far fetched to believe he had it drop without layer exploits?
---
*I comb your dwarves taint hair*
---
Those details are exactly what happens.  Good troll on him though.
---
Gave me a chuckle.
---
It's fair cause if you're playing on a pvp server, you're agreeing to that possibility.
---
Laughing on all this ban responses, he is on pvp server, he can have as much fun killing anything in the game as he wants
---
I remember I was on the back left roof of Gadgetzan killing people on my Moonkin.  
---
And I got a whisper from a GM telling me to get down or I will be banned.
---
...I've run Deadmines as a tank with a sword and boardand the only time I had trouble holding threat was when a mage was spamming Arcane Explosion. 
---
To hold threat is really easy honestly.  I honestly have no idea why you think you it's so hard
---
Walk into goldshire inn. I guarantee you will see RPing
---
i’ve never played on a private server. and just because a gm said it doesn’t make it right. just as the orc were corrupted by blood, so to were blizzard’s minds corrupted by the whiny voices of players who can’t handle playing a real computer game.
---
As a fellow Firemaw resident, I'm very happy we're on the same faction
---
Same here, completely new to the game and a random guy whom i was asking about wands around L10 sent me like 8 bags and 1g50s. Made my day
---
Then give us the census data yourself blizzard! This is BS, there were census addons back in Vanilla, you could have made it so that an addon can only send a who request every minute or so if they are really concerned about the server load.
---
Quests in the Jintha'alor sub-zone of Hinterlands. You'll need to kill a little under 200 elite level 52-54 trolls to complete all of them (also, you'll need to do a quest that starts in Tanaris, then Feralas, which allows you to summon Hakkar in Sunken Temple).
---
Takes about as long as a dungeon to get everything done, and the rewards are great. Physical classes want to do it because they get a +hit% trinket.
---
Took me 4 days to find a group, though.
---
Tbh, I feel like the LFG tool is fine as long as it doesn't teleport you to the dungeon once the group is complete.
---
I’m playing mage myself. A few days ago another mage kept calling me out for doing single target attacks instead of nova&gt;CoC&gt;blizzard. 
---
I pointed out that everytime one of us aoe’s the tank can’t hold agro...
---
I’m a new player, but that seems so basic.
---
i’m not gate keeping. there’s a wall. not a gate. you’re not allowed through no matter what you do.
---
It's not bop.
---
and reckless pulling wastes tanks and healers so no thanks, i take the patient route all day if it means that everyone's fine.
---
ITT: everybody is a saint and never dies anything wrong.
---
Actually laughing here.
---
This flaw is indeed unintentional. If they could program the guards to climb up to the roof, they would.
---
Except the gm post is different.  It isnt about this.  Or else by GMs definition all world pvp is exploiting because it is where the guards cant reach you.
---
Haha :D &lt;3
---
There is a macro That removes all totems. Check the shaman Discord for it
---
As a rogue, this gives me ideas
---
you fuckers are nothing but npcs to me, providing varying levels of entertainment
---
&gt;just because a gm said it doesn’t make it right
---
Lmao yes it does
---
There’s another fp in feralas get that and it’ll be a straight shot
---
⛪
---
I tried having a conversation with a warlock who exhibited all the signs of a 'Go go go pull the entire dungeon' player. He would run in and cast Hellfire as soon as the mobs made contact with the tank. Aggro would go everywhere because of it, and I had to use CDs and resources to save the group. He insisted this was not only the correct way to play but it made the run faster. He said streamers do it this way, and they know more than me.
---
I tried to explain that me dumping my entire mana bar (plus Mana Potions) every pull to keep him alive, as well as everyone else who now has aggro because of him, is actually slowing the run down because I have to drink every pull where normally I wouldn't have to drink. He called me an idiot.
---
He also never ate or drank between pulls - just life tapped between pulls and expected me to heal him up.
---
What about your wand specialization talent?..
---
Why not just put a few guards on rooftops or give them the ability to blink onto rooftops?
---
And doesn't work across realms, and doesn't give extra rewards based on role or simply for using it.
---
Those are called Meeting stones, and they are in Classic.
---
There’s none in 1k needles for alliance but there’s a 2nd one in feralas he could get to shorten it a lot
---
Missing from image: 30+ horde sitting outside spamming AoE and fear.
---
Is that a Stewlseries 6GV2 Keyboard? I got mine since end of 2013 and I love it, just cleaned it this week, wasn’t even really dirty, surprisingly after that time :D
---
Chrome has pop out for youtube, right click then right click again on the video and press picture in picture (something like that).
---
Got it, thanks!!
---
It is, but even if it weren't, that would just further support my point, there's absolutely no reason to believe he exploited anything in order to get this.
---
Don't worry bro you're not alone. A lot of players stopped using their brain in the 33-43 Scarlet monastery grind, and now they're ready to ruin the 44-50 part in ZF. Now as a tank you have different options : 
---
\- Like you said, you can tryhard advanced tank rotations that leaves no room for relaxing and gain a scientific knownledge of threat generation. After hours of practice you'll probably manage to do a ZF run without any wipe but you'll also probably disconnect right after the last boss because you're exhausted and had 0 fun.
---
\- Stop tanking until maraudon and Sunken temple
---
\- The hybrid solution, stop giving a fck about those noobs and tank the dungeon with your 2h and cleave spells. If the priest gets oom after the first pack just remind him that shadow spec isn't meant for healing and kick him
---
This item requires a drop off of rag for the eye (3%). And then 8 ingots which only drop off Golemag (33%). So on his realm there needed to be 24 MC runs (give or take for luck) to get all 8 ingots. All of the guilds doing MC would then have to sell him those ingots.
---
Such a cool guy! Would love to hang out with him.
---
Note: Sarcasm
---
It’s shown in ElvUI too. Not sure if it’s shown in the game without addons tho
---
That feeling when u take the disc quest read the text and see complete just to take port to iron forge
---
[This site](https://tapas.io/TallFrodo) should have all of my comics going forward if that's what you're after. 
---
It'll have everything in higher quality than [my Twitter](https://twitter.com/tallfrodo) (the scans, that is, not the artwork).
---
No, I mean that rage is like energy. Not the wow ernergy from rouge's but how energy in physics. And energy can't disappeare, it is only transformed.
---
Because blues/greens generally aren't worth THAT much money. While some BoE epics can go upwards of 500g
---
But i'm sure you've seen an enchanter or two try to convince people to allow them to need on green for enchanting when everyone needs gold also.
---
Only place I've noticed it is at the Kodo Graveyard in Desolace
---
I usually run with with a 2 hander to pick up aggro and switch to sword ans board once i establish threat
---
Don't do to others what you don't want done to you. Would you like it if someone did this to you?
---
It's a douchebag move and I'm pretty sure you know it is. Don't be a douchebag.
---
Because this is 1.12, you dont need them for ZG enchants here, they where needed in an older patch that pservers replicated properly thats why they costed more on pservers.
---
That’s the real hustle right there.
---
They ran out after the first 20 scorpions.. haha
---
I hate it!!!! Lol
---
But.. warriors are usually in a leveling spec while leveling. So should they roll on leveling gear as their main spec?
---
Spec does not equal role while in leveling dungeons unless the tank is actually leveling prot for whatever reason.
---
Tons of people hiding on top of building in gadgetzan trying to attk people without pulling guard aggro. Blizzard alrdy said this count as exploiting, just report and move on
---
Well your animal would have no problem attacking me, so i have no problem putting the beast down
---
haha kidnapping the MT! BRILLIANT
---
Other option... Combat Rogue, don't need the stealth ;)
---
&gt; Spec does not equal role while in leveling dungeons
---
No shit. I typed it plain as day.
---
Samwise hasnt been on the WoW team for a long time, especially not MoP and forward.  After WoW he moved to SC2, and after SC2 he moved to Heroes of the Storm.  Now that Heroes is done for, I'm sure he's on a new project.
---
Isn’t it awkward when even the NPCs hate you?
---
Didn't forget that, it's the last sentence in my response. It's definitely achievable and impressive he was able to acquire all of those ingots from guilds and pugs, especially while guild expenses are low. I may just be ignorant to how many MC runs have been done on the bigger realms since launch.
---
Thunderbluff cliff jumping event for all classes
---
What does farming gold have to do with completing Sulfuras, which would be quite literally impossible to have farmed by this point of the game without a ton of raid groups donating to one player, or more likely, layer exploitation which Blizzard has outright stated will be addressed, and players banned.
---
That is also not how droprates work. But whatever.
---
Oh I don't mind if people want to retaliate through any in game method
---
I mean, tanks pull and should be the one pulling and keeping up the fast pace, I just wish the tanks would turn on powerbars and look at the healer’s mana. They healers will drink, just pull when you think they have enough mana for the pack. There are different healers and different factors. Like:
---
Do you have endless water with mages. You’ll only need a few seconds to drink and then pull. But if you don’t, let the healer drink for the whole duration so they don’t waste the water/money. 
---
How much mana does the average healer use for each pack. For instance: are you lower level and thus making the mobs hit harder and you’ll need more heals which takes more mana. 
---
If the tank considers these conditions everyone will enjoy it more. The tank gets the heal they want and the healer will have a better time healing
---
Thanks for reading
---
Tl:dr don’t expect healers to just “do their jobs”. You have your own eyes and brain, use them.
---
No it doesn't, the server size is the same with 0 or 100 layers, you just don't have 200.000 people at the same spot at the same time. Looks like you don't quite understand what layers are there for
---
You were in groups with shitty Warriors then. I havent seen a single good sword and Board tank, meanwhile arms Warriors are ripping through dungeons. If the healer need the tank to wear a shield to heal them then you are better off replacing the healer because he is bad.
---
Won't happen
---
Then they should've made it impossible to climb onto things, it's not hard to put invisible walls in
---
Yeah I know it's not in the game. I have the blacksmithing hammer but when I talk to the blacksmithing expert he doesn't give me the option to say 'train me'
---
Stone form baby.
---
nice low effort posts here mods
---
HOOOOOOOOOO
---
Use vanish to drop threat if you take Aggro, and also pickpocket all the mobs before engaging, you hustle money and give the tank time to get Aggro.
---
You quite obviously never played a tank in a PUG. If you’ve no idea what you’re talking about, just STFU.
---
What weapon would be better for a shaman?
---
Thee eula doesn't allow blizzard to hack my pc and spy I to other users accounts though ;) this part is cometely against EU laws and therefore wouldn't hold up either way
---
Tbh, yes to both. The mage chose a pure DPS class and the druid chose a hybrid. Hybrids need more gear than pure DPS classes and can also fill more roles. It sucks but hey, that's the trade-off for not going hybrid.
---
Now at 60 it's a little different as by then a person should have a "main spec" that they are focusing on.

---
Bestial wrath -&gt; watch your pet solo the mage
---
Don't feed the troll.  Everything you said is true and most dps don't care because its rarely a wipe when they do this.  Most the dungeons are easy enough that a tank would only be needed for bosses and not even all of those.  I totally feel your point though as I took a break on my warrior at 45 because of this.  Yes the dungeon can get finished no problem... but the tank is not having a fun time at all running around with no rage trying to pick up at least a couple mobs.  If they gave us a few seconds we can hold threat and then watch threat and mix in heroics or stance dance some other added dps skills in, that would be fun, we would be happy to tank for you.  Currently my mage about to pass my tank because it just doesn't sound fun to hop on the tank knowing what will happen.  Pretty sure going into the 50 dungeons that would change as the dps will die faster when pulling aggro but damn if they don't make it extra painful trying to get there.
---
I don't mind if people want to retaliate through any in game method, in fact I probably prefer it.
---
Don’t use your 60 to help. I’ve been the underleveled friend and getting my handheld through everything isn’t fun.
---
You’re going to be alone the rest of your life
---
I play a paladin and was leveling as ret so I was using strength gear. I wanted to respec holy so I started rolling on int and +healing gear but made sure to ask permission first.
---
You underestimate the power of community. I know my guild would put him on a banlist.
---
I only tank when I do dungeons because otherwise I get some dogshit tank that cries about agro
---
Well while leveling, everyone is in a leveling spec, so there's that.
---
You can have the following for example:
---
/stopmacro [@target,noexists]
---
/say Hello there %t
---
%t will be replaced by the target's name
---
Ive pulled when my healer has had half a bar of mana and he has let me die, not because he does not have enough mana he wanted to punish me for not letting him finish his 10s drink.
---
You realize there thousands of people playing on the servers If not tens of thousands. I think you’re being a little dramatic there.
---
Of course not, and I have no issue with anyone needing on leveling gear.  But I still think as per OPs question, that at making the rest of the group aware that your going to be needing on more than the average person from when you join, is proper etiquette.
---
where can I get auctioneer? I couldnt find a classic version
---
Not on the list but mograine is nice high pop low queues 
---
Good as a horde
---
Yes I am aware but not all guards do
---
Dude said he bougt them all but one, yeah sure you farmed 3k gold by yourself as a warrior in 3 weeks.
---
But I'm already married
---
They are strict because you need the same loot, while contributing probably less. In the era of dungeon cleaves and the abundance of dps I'm not surprised if they chose the better setup.
---
The guy said that he bought the ingots 400-500g each. Whether you believe him or not is your choice but it's completely possible that enough ingots dropped to form Sulfuras, and he bought them at that price farming solo.
---
i don't buy the servers are that shit.
---
Is there a skill cap for disenchanting highlvl items? So if I drop Mining and have enchanting, can I still disenchant high lvl items?
---
Well thats a bummer
---
I’ll just add, playing on Skarem and ever 5 minutes I’m obliterated by Horde.
---
I just want my WW axe.
---
&gt; Try 2H tanking
---
I had a 2H - the 1H mace that dropped was higher DPS :(
---
Will do, thanks.
---
Your stories just hit me in the spot y.y
---
Just fyi, this is a bug. Feel free to use it, but OP should know that it's bug-using and not a "legitimate" strategy.
---
Do this to a rogue and I’ll pop a quick sprint and evasion, tag every mob in sight, bandage you , then pop vanish so they all aggro onto you :)
---
You're not wrong. However I hate grouping with people like you. I don't care about efficency, I care about a relaxing and fun moment. I'm not here to rush the dungeon as fast as possible. I will probably only do each dungeon while leveling once or twice, and it is not to complete them on farm aoe rush mode.
---
So yeah, I understand what you are saying and your way of playing is totally valid, but, again, I hate grouping with people like you, just as much as you hate grouping with people like me.
---
After my comment, he stated that.......
---
What a shitty person.
---
Yea I cannot for the life of me understand how this guy got banned. What a load of fucking shit. 
---
You play on a PvP server... expect this to happen. I’ve been fanned plenty of times and it’s pissed me the fuck off. But this is part of the game. I would never want people to get banned for ganking me. If anything it spurs team work within my faction and we work together to kill the gankers — then it feels like an accomplishment. 
---
This is where WoW goes down hill. Let the community sort it out IN GAME. Blizzard should not intervene and ban people for doing things that are part of the game. 
---
I mean for fuck sake, if they don’t want people to Hank in booty bay, why is PvP turned on for every player when they are there?
---
Imahine a tank not wearing his plate because its to expensive to repair.
---
It's so so so unbelievably easy to just add invisible walls to these "exploitable" roofs they've had 15 years to do it
---
Is this some kind of support role joke i'm too DPS too understand?
---
You didn’t actually explain.
---
I understand perfectly what layers are there for, they're there to keep realm populations high at launch so they don't end up empty when  the tourists leave.
---
Yes, they prevent 200.000 people at the same spot, that's correct, but that would only ever be an issue if they hadn't temporarily heavily increased the realm caps.
---
Wanted to get some iron... no luck
---
Must really be an intrinsic problem with layering.
---
Same problem back when Blizzard introduced phasing, flying over the zone showed many veins, after landing all where gone...
---
Blizzard should have leaarned this by now.
---
&gt;Has the community really just decided that every guild is a hardcore min-max guild who refuse to use a shadowpriest now?
---
All the guilds that are raiding right now are either semi-hardcore or hardcore, considering the short timeframe after release. You already knew what you were getting into. 
---
There's a reason why many people were against the threads that were like "just play whatever you want, it will be fine :) :) :)".
---
A Shadowpriest in the warlock group is pretty decent for Vampiric Embrace and Shadow weaving. VE allows for the Warlocks to lifetap much more without needing actual healing, and SW increases their damage by 15%. They have great synergy. You can always afford one Shadow Priest in the raid. Especially with content as easy as this.
---
Didnt know there was one for classic?
---
No, he didn't chase me so I think he was happy.
---
&gt; You’re going to be alone the rest of your life
---
it happened 15 years ago. It will happen now.
---
Okay that makes sense; I'm still healing deadmines, so good to know it gets better!
---
Imo, it shouldn't need to be addressed because it's common sense. Of course the warrior tanking SM will need leveling gear, it shouldn't need to be said.
---
A hunter would be nice for the adds, the can focus the small ones down very easily and have a pet to offtank a bit. I guess melee DPS in general seems to work, if mana is a concern.
---
Stay at max range, viper sting, ez wins
---
That's really sad, I'm a 36 dwarf hunter, I was walking randomly and found Humar the pridelord ! I guess I was really lucky so I tamed it.
---
Don't give up on your beloved Warrior ! It's just a bad conjoncture that will last only a few lvls, if you don't want to tank anymore you still have one of the best dps classes in the game
---
He made like all the icons for WC3 and vanilla WoW, and he made his face the missing icon icon.
---
Do you think so? I'll keep you updated if this happens.
---
9. 1 for the recipe, 8 for the forging.
---
I have indeed done that :)
---
those new mounts look like shit compared to the original vanilla mounts. can't believe blizzard took them from us :'  (
---
When you're leveling, everyone has a right to roll on leveling gear.
---
Being precious about loot in a low-level 5 man dungeon is pretty silly, just follow the don't be a dick rule.
---
A tank taking a 2H is fine, but taking like an Int/Spirit staff from caster because it has a couple more DPS than their current 2H, that's dick territory.
---
Just unlucky
---
You can disenchant any item in the game with level 1 enchanting
---
Holy fuck
---
Right now there isn't, that wasn't implemented until 2.0.1, so it might come in one of the later phases or it might not
---
If someone is faster then me at tagging I just run to deaggro and I dont care how far. Not killing mob if ait gaining anything.
---
How is it terrible? It's the best weapon next to R14 weps for solo/wpvp and those aren't even available yet. The first weapon that's clearly better is Dark Edge.
---
Ah, the Blacksmithing Expert will not train you until you are skill level 50. Until then you need to talk to the Blacksmithing Journeyman.
---
Yeah I can confirm, all ore spawns are broken except copper
---
What did you have to do in order to get the reputation required for the mount?:)
---
I got to rank 11 as a feral druid and had Herald of Woe, I must admit the Intel on it was amazing. A Friend of mine was a rank 14 feral druid with the AQ weap and he tried an Intel build, it just didn't do much - basically the same fights just longer as less damage/more mana.
---
You might be in the wrong thread. Read OP's post again.
---
It's nothing exciting lol I'm just happy with it!
---
Still, you're ruining someone else's gaming experience to a certain extent.
---
Some 4 people did this at darkshire to level 20s and they where 50+, for about 20 minutes, undead are the scum of the game, i have no remorse killing a low level undead.
---
I could oly remember 2 of the 4 people who did this on faerlina, i would have screen shot but I didnt know it was ban worthy. 
---
On faerlina 2 that I remember where; Boyfriend and Videogame, mage and a warlock respectivley
---
My dick must be huge because I don't have enough time that's why I'm doing sweet lifehacks like this to level faster
---
Its auctionator, google "auctionator classic", probably the first link
---
If you want auctioneer its on curse/twitch app
---
Are you on full mana? Toss them a HoT.
---
Are you running off of fumes? Those fumes belong to the tank and you.
---
If they tap from full HP to 10% midfight you don't owe them anything.
---
Lol its a game if a little adversity in game ruins your gaming experience idk what to tell you
---
Who’s really gonna give a shit about the Druid that took their quest mob at 60 and remember their name. I have a hard enough time remembering the hordes name that gank me that I want to get even with at 60 and that’s why I want to download the kill on sight addon. Not gonna add an alliance onto it and I’m probably gonna just look back at it and laugh if it were me. It’s fair game lol. Class advantage if you wanna call it that. Are you gonna get mad at the mage that blinked and got to the node before you too?
---
Thats a good idea were going to do that, thank you.
---
I feel like this whole conversation could’ve been done in a much friendlier tone. I agree with you both tbh. Last night I did deadmines with a level 26 warrior tank. He insisted on only pulling 1 mob at a time, even though most of them weren’t even elites. He would get angry if we told him to go faster. This is obviously an extreme example, but it does - in my opinion - prove that a tank needs some kind of pace, he’s not only there to tank and stay alive.
---
There are repeatable quests to donate cloth in order to raise rep with the main factions.
---
Huh?  I'm just helping out my bro druids with a nice tip for leveling faster
---
Because we are in a different patch than original vanilla
---
Really nice. Thanks
---
How can this shaman equip valor shoulders?
---
No, I commented about the impossible feat that it would be to have collected 9 ingots by this point in the game. 
---
The Person who supposedly "farmed" them, claimed they were given 1 and bought 7, which is still 1 short of enough ingots. Just pointing out the plot holes to this fishy story. 
---
Perhaps you never played Vanilla to find out how long it actually took to farm up enough ingots for Sulfuras, even on a high pop server, but you aren't getting them in the first 3 weeks without exploitation. In the past, it was the "server shutdown" exploitation of duplicate items that did this. BLizzard has even come out to state that they are aware of layering explitation issues in Classic and will ban people who were exploiting these layers. No date on when they will be doing that, but it is expected to happen soon, probably next reset.
---
Yeah that's true I'm a dick but I'm okay with that
---
&gt;Phase 2 probably won't be until Feb or March 2020.
---
Why would you think that
---
Lol have fun being known as the asshole of your server.
---
^
---
this guy plays mage.
---
Man I've tanked Mara ST and BRD. 
---
I've come to the conclusion that I am no longer bringing ranged dps on any run ever. People did the SM ZF cleave farm and expect it to work for BRD. I've had locks hellfiring before I've hit anything, then crying about it when they die. Mages kiting shit around like they're having a stroke and hunters thinking that they can multishot while I'm charging in and not use FD.
---
I fucking hate ranged dps atm. At least melee can tank mobs to a degree and it's in range for me to taunt.
---
Because they enjoy the end-game content more than leveling?
---
Shit, if I could get an instant 60 I'd take it in a heartbeat, because "Go grind 100 boring mobs to get 5 drops" isn't really engaging content
---
I asked it wrong -   
---
Because of that Shaman have too many skills where I dont have the overview and I dont know which keybinds I should use..  
---
Can someone send me his order? A structure how to order all the skills and totems  
---
e.g. 1-5 = all earth totem skills or all important totems from earth to air?  
---
Would be nice if u send me ur screenshot of your order idk :I Thank you guys
---
Ahem ahem
---
There need to be  8 clears, 24 is not the minimum.
---
unless he is blizz
---
Dont take anyone below level 45, the last boss is level 49, remember theres a 14% chance to miss an enemy 3 levels above you.
---
The amount of people who are saying "exploiting" is mind-boggling. Firemaw is one of the largest EU servers (comparable to Herod/Faerlina). It's not impossible for there to be a large amount of MC clears past Golemagg - not just from his one guild, but from all guilds. Ingots aren't BOP.  
---
And for those saying "he couldn't have had that much money so must have exploited there!" need to realize that people know how to make use of their time efficiently. Even basic dungeon runs gather crazy amounts of gold from crafting mats. If he played the AH in any capacity that's another way of increasing gold.  
---
Y'all are so hellbent on downplaying others' successes that you resort to default excuses of exploitation instead of realizing that people learned how to play the *original version of a 15 year old game*.  
---
Btw, grats on the Hammer. Dope that it's with a Warrior.
---
Yeah, im playing it the way its supposed to be played. You do you kiddo
---
Exactly, it's just a game. Stop taking the fun away from others because you're a selfish prick. You're deliberately causing someone else to have to take time out of their own schedule to kill your mobs. Just be a decent person do stuff yourself instead of leeching off others
---
ive never seen another show where it felt like it took 90 minutes to get through every half hour episode because of all the time spent paused to let the douche chill wear off
---
&gt;  explain how...
---
exploiting layers thats how
---
I do in general but I'm actually a druid main for classic and if I'm in a dungeon I'm tanking it.
---
I think I can live with that
---
I haven't picked this game back up yet. Don't know if I will.  
---
But I was thinking more Minethil harbor.
---
It was my favorite anything ever, to float in the harbor as a warlock and DOT anything that landed at the griffin.  
---
The guards would be slowed by the water and I could kill them with DOTs as well.
---
Server are not shit but resources are not free, wasting money on something that's not necessary is not good for business.
---
it is broken, it deals more damage than what the tooltip says LOL
---
Bring melee only. Combat rogues and arms warriors do great cleave and if they take some damage it's not a huge issue. Normally a rogue can dodge tank a mob every pull or 2.
---
Boycott ranged dps, melee power!
---
Position yourself accordingly for cleave. Not rocket science.
---
Guys,
---
Blizzard, with anything that happens first on a server/world like a boss kill or a first legendary, gets reviewed and makes sure that no cheats or exploits were involved in the process. That’s why several world first boss kills over the course of the game have been ”withdrawn” amongst other things.
---
If this dude exploited his way to Sulfuras then Blizzard will know about it and he will be reprimanded. If not (which is fully possible by loaning ingots from other guilds as people have mentioned), a congratulations is in order!
---
Nice so few of those around. Come to think of it, I haven’t seen a feral tank at all on my server (Kromcrush), despite them being debatably superior to warriors until endgame.
---
Lv 38 warlock ?
---
Nah mate. Always sipping on booze so it's always shaking
---
Mad casuals because people blitz their "hard game" without problems.
---
If they aren't having fun playing the game that's their problem.   I'm not cheating or anything I'm playing the same game and if the game allows me to do it then it's ok
---
neither are you
---
Why have guards in the first place then?
---
Just because you suck and cant farm gold quickly doesn't mean nobody can.
---
My TF back in classic was no drama. It was DKP, I had the most, so it was my item. I was NOT the main tank, just first offtank.
---
But when I got the second half I became practically maintank :D
---
1.0 wasn’t each major city its own?
---
So that would make them specifically implement something that was never in vanilla?
---
If this dude exploited his way to a world first Sulfuras then Blizzard will/would have known about it. They monitor all significant world firsts quite closely
---
They weren't linked up to patch 1.9 or something
---
Amazing!
---
Dps can auto attack the primary target and there won't be any threat issues dude. But dropping a blizzard or multishot while the tank is pulling is fucking stupid and if you do it you deserve the 10% durability loss and a run back.
---
Explain it yourself then?  Or you just popping in to disagree without any evidence and then leave?
---
Well to be honest most healers don't do their job properly. They are supposed to make sure the party doesn't die, and maintain mana.
---
That means timing your heals/dots so regen kicks in, and making use of natural healing between pulls.
---
Yeah druids are pretty rare.  I saw a decent amount early on but I think they quit or rerolled
---
Yeah it's completely *allowed*, nobody is going to ban you for it. But if you carry on, and also bring this attitude into other parts of the game, nobody will like you. Of course if that's fine with you then carry on the way you are, and people will quickly learn to avoid playing with you
---
Enhance shaman is useless
---
When the dps classes aren’t sharing quest mobs I whisper them “one day you’ll need a tank and I will remember...” 
---
The if they keep being big meanies I add them to the black list cause I AM that kind of orc.
---
No, in 1.0 there was only if/org/gadget, then a patch (1.8 I think, not 100% sure) added the rest and they were linked right away.
---
That’s pretty metal
---
I'm not debating MC being easy and pugable, its the sheer volume of runs required to have farmed up the 9 mandatory ingots in three lockouts.
---
Your opinions don't override rules
---
I just have to say. As a Tank in raids from other expansions. The main goal isnt to show your wanker to the rest and say, HEY! Im TOP of the charts. GIVE ME LOOT NUBZ.The purpose is to be efficient, kill the Boss and DO NoT PULL AGGRO. Doesnt tucking matter if you did TOP in Charts or last. Its a team effort to reach the end goal, more importantly, those charts are to help you understand when to go “HAM” or relax your DPS. Nothing more. Everyone has a mission and responsibility for the end goal. Thats why Classic was fun. It made a social dynamic, and made people accountable. Killed me when people go after a person healing or tanking. Putting stress in the person keeping you alive because you pulled aggro, and your class isnt supposed to get hit. At the end the healer will prioritize the person who will keep all alive, not the one with the wanker out. Be smart, respectful and learn to play your class. Take criticism to improve. We are a community, and we need to share and speak to each other to grow.
---
Good practice also bc you amass threath that way.
---
There is a difference. Mage mostly keeps killing the target. This guy leave them without touching anymore.
---
lol, go play runescape
---
It's not like I'm gonna ninja some loot from a raid or something we have an agreement there, I have no agreement with the plebs in the wild.
---
I had a healer in a spell cleave run that kept rebubbling my eye after I pulled stuff causing the mobs to split into multiple groups because everything I had pull would aggro the priest. He wouldn't stop for some reason
---
Not necessarily, the rhok quest needs to be started by the hunter who has the quest. 
---
However you can get another hunter to kill the mobs for you if they are in the same party, preferably one who has already done it and is more geared.
---
This method helped me buy my epic mount lol.
---
But if a hunter can solo this it would def be a rite of passage into bigboy hunter world.

Damn elitists. I spent like 3 hours yesterday on a full quest Gnomer run, and loved it.

I'm not saying those obsessed with efficiency are "wrong", but I like to think that I get more enjoyment from game :D
---
Yeah true, good point. But as a warrior my auto often hits higher than the stuff listed above and I get left also :'(
---
Any news on this ?
---
What are you on about mate? The question was answered. In patch 1.9 they linked auction houses and thats still before TBC. So Vanilla. We are playing on a custom 1.12 so the AH are linked.

Go exploit your will to life

Yeah I forgot

They weren't not linked either, they just simply didn't exist, as soon as they were added they werere linked. So as I said, there was never a time where auction houses were not linked.
---
Deviate fish
---
DeskPins is something I've used in the past but haven't tried it with WOW
---
I sure hope we're not using classic.wowhead for drop rate info, since its all jacked up. 
---
But even so, with a 33% chance after 3 weeks, its likely to have seen 7 ingots after three weeks, assuming there were 8 guilds of level enough to run 3 weeks straight, which there were not.
---
Water is also wet
---
No, in 1.9 they added the extra auction houses and they were linked right away.
---
&gt; Anyone got any other good leveling lifehacks?
---
Wait for other people to pull the last mob before the quest item node you're all looking for, and loot it while the guy struggles.
---
Or make sure you ignore the people waiting for an escort respawn for 10 minutes and grab the quest from the npc before they notice.
---
I am a generous god.
---
They where level 59 or 60, so probably 60, all four or five of them. I'm level 49 and they where skull to me.   
---
Sometimes I wonder if horde level 60ties on our server are just as bad with the low level ganking, because alliance seems to do it a fair bit.
---
This, I hate writing and reading comments, just give your variables, methods and classes relevant names, letters don't cost money, don't call your variable 'a', call it 'meleeHitEvent' or something. Put some time in your architecture, and you almost need zero comments that don't get updated because you can't write unit tests for it.
---
Those enraged troggs hit like a truck.
---
How is running around EPL for 80g/hour exploiting? I do it, you can do it, everyone can given the time and you don't have to layer for it, because the time to travel from one rich thorium node to another is about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.
---
As a priest, I hope it doesn't.
---
Is it possible he was summoned by a Warlock?
---
in classic you do both bro. it’s not retail and there’s no team pve and team pvp like you’re used to.
---
I chose a server for that one reason.   I always rather play on the faction in the minority.    Plus I play with others that share the same preference.    This statement is not 100%percent.
---
RIP the shamans who didn't get this weapon over a bloody warrior. What a waste.
---
Reinstalled wow (classic) yesterday and I'm not sure what to play.
---
The thing I'm sure of is that I want to find group / raid really easily.
---
I remember that tanks are always needed for 5 man content (5 man dungeons during leveling and at 60 to get pre-raid gear) but no so much once you start doing raids (only need 2 tanks per raid). At that point healer may be the most looked after role.
---
Soooo I was thinking of rolling a druid, I could tank 5 man content until I'm "raid ready" (I know warrior are better but feral should be "good enough) then switch to healer for raids.
---
Does this seems like a good idea or shouldn't I bother and roll priest / warrior ?
---
Bonus question : best race for horde druid ? Tauren stun seems OP in pvp and the bonus health may help tank better ?
---
Thanks !
---
&gt;No it's not, it's literally based on what people in classic have seen drop, you can argue the same size is small, but that could just as likely mean the real drop rate is 50% or it could mean it's 15%, either way, it's the best we have to go by.
---
No, its literally jacked up. It has recipes and items dropping from mobs not yet in the game, some with 100% drop rates that are much lower, some that are quite clearly world drop items in phase 1, but being listed as only dropping from Phase 3+ mobs. 
---
&gt;Citation? Week 2 rag was easy as hell.
---
Their server discord, wow forums, reddit, etc. 
---
You honestly can't be so blissfully naive that you think this guy and his guild were just so fortunate to have found/bought/farmed 9 ingots and 50 arcanite bars, without exploiting the game, not even a month into its release. 
---
Come on now, my sweet summer child.
---
I'm guilty :(
---
That's true, but the one trip from Goldshire to the Stormwind AH will not matter in the grand scheme of things. You can also combine this with some training on level 10 and until level 10 you will manage somehow.
---
Is there a really viable hunter tank build without thunderfury? I'm really curious to try weird builds since im 60 now
---
&gt;If they could legitimately fly there on a mount
---
Not in Gadgetzan.  Flying in Kalimdor/Eastern Kingdom wasn't introduced until Cata.  Before that it was limited to Outland (and also Northrend in wrath)
---
Got ganked by 3 hordies while walking to RFK today. It’s time to perpetuate the circle of violence.
---
reminded me of when gaara just stands still and the sand blocks all attacks
---
Even with 300+ players are ignoring him they're still nothing compared to the entire server
---
Ive done this with Ankhs
---
I was on the border of Redridge and Feralas killing pigs for snouts, and noticed that as soon as I killed a pig, another would immediately spawn.
---
Is this a feature while so many people are leveling? Or is it a bug?
---
The irony is that your dps will be way higher if you let the tank build up threat cause you can deal damage without wasting time running away or using mitigation. In classic autohits are a majority of the dps and uptime is very important for the numbers. Even if your total damage of the mob will be higher by 300 your dps will be way lower if you need to fear/iceblock/stun/root etc instead of using damage cds
---
&gt;or you put a shaman there 
---
I dont think everyone has that option
---
You can't take a name that was banned.
---
GM: What are you doing on that rooftop?
---
[Player: Just waiting for a mate...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6SMGrIaals)
---
It seems like there's a pug going every night on my server and it would be much easier to talk a pug into selling the ingots.
---
This explains why I get sapped on the second floor of booty bay inn.
---
@mouseover will remove combo points on your current target, tested this in game just to double check.
---
Is he like the Ash of Blizzard
---
I don’t think it was
---
Firemaw did not have 15 raid guilds week 1, week 2, or today, though. 
---
its easy to create a narrative where this is all possible, but the reality is that its much more likely that heavy exploitation of open world layering, as well as possible item duplication and/or boss layering inside MC were to account for this. 
---
We're talking better odds than winning the lottery, here.
---
That’s pretty *horrifying* to me as a Warrior. :^)
---
aww man i didnt know getting a mask as a low lvl was a right of passage or my dumb ass would of gotten it :(
---
Especially if a hunter manages to pull aggro, its a nightmare mostly for the hunter honestly. They run BACKWARDS and I need to use intercept to get the mob, but the next time it happens it is impossible for me to even try. Sorry hunters, you gotta sacrafice that 1-2 auto shot n get into your own deadzone so I can snatch the mob should it escape.
---
Pretty sure I clicked the arrow to bring it out and then clicked hide and it went away. Maybe that hide button was an addons doing though
---
Fuck anyone who tells you what your prices should be.
---
Can’t wait to kill this war with rank 1 frostbolt :)
---
I'm not exploiting, literally running around in circles and I alone already have acquired 15 arcane crystals.
---
Hand of rag give you as a shaman the ability to do  be a good dps in over content, there some spec who benefit from this item. More then any other class.
---
Retail has spoiled us too much. Dungeons were something that took all of 20 minutes or so.
---
Last week a friend told me he was stuck in Uldaman for 2 hours!
---
But... WoW now does feel more like an adventure when you dungeon.
---
The issue has never been the gold/hour, though that's easily exploited with layering. 
---
The issue is getting 9 ingots in 3 weeks. The 50 arcanite bars we can all take a pass at for open world exploitation "because everyone is doing it", but getting the 9 ingots is the issue.
---
Not true, you cannot play WoW classic on a free trial account.
---
* I enjoy doing end-game dungeons and raiding more than I enjoy doing quests
---
* More chances of finding a good raiding guild, so that I can be better geared for Phase 2
---
* I have done this content many times and the longer it takes, the more chances that I'd potentially burn out
---
Gear funneling?
---
Loot council man. You gear out your most valuable raiders first.
---
Luck? Layer exploit? 
---
I guess luck
---
I mean on my servers there's weekly at minimum 2 different pugs as well as 4 different guilds that clear Golemagg.
---
It's pretty clear... If you are using buildings to pvp and avoid guards, it's against the rules
---
don't have conversations with them. just kick them
---
dps are literally disposable. they should be catering to you. they should be doing EVERYTHING they can to put themselves ahead of the other DPS they're in competition with
---
they should be making an impression
---
&gt;But I find levelling is its own journey
---
And other people find leveling incredibly, mind-numbingly boring. A thing you just have to go through in order to enjoy the "real" content.
---
&gt;Yes there is the frequent 'kill x' quests
---
It's not just the "kill x" quests. Literally 99% of quests in Classic are boring. It's either "kill x", "collect y by killing x", "find y guarded by x and kill x to get to y", "escort y at a speed that could more accurately be described as 'granny with all limbs broken' and fight x at predetermined spawn points", or others in that ilk. There's very, very few quests with anything interesting going for them. If you find that engaging, that's fine, but for others like me it's literally just something to endure until you get to the fun part, whether that's pvp or raiding.
---
You might be on a more social server where people will add you to a friend list because you grouped with them once, but that has never been my experience. You group for a group quest/dungeon, and the moment it's done everyone leaves the party. Guilds are the only social part, and those stay whether you level quickly or not.
---
this cringe comment shows just how far away we are from the community of vanilla wow players i’ve been used to over the past two years. it’s definitely a net positive for the game though.
---
That would not give 8 drops on average, not even close.
---
The drop is 33% that means you have \~70% for it to drop in 3 tries, and it's less than 1% chance that a 70% event repeats 8 times.
---
[The date is a reference to the first panels of the comic Watchmen](https://i.imgur.com/AVPj4If.jpg).
---
I considered backdating it to 1985 but figured that would cause more confusion than just dating it a few weeks in the future ~~because at my current rate of levelling I'll probably still be running WC by then~~
---
So sorry, wrong sub. Glad you caught it 4 days later.
---
In all my spellcleave groups i do 30-50 % more dmg than wl

rorshach as a warrior, nice.

---
Wow who hurt you friend :(. Wipe them tears.
---
Just out of interest, how do you tank? Sword and Board? I’ve found the most effective style for me has become tanking with a two handed weapon and switching stances as needed for taunt, intercept, etc.
---
My guess is they are part of guild raid teams where for whatever reason they are being geared up in complete first.
---
How about you learn how to make 80g an hour and come back spewing such bullshit.
---
Make a second account, be logged in 24/7 at the auction house and flip items for couple hundred golds a week all while running circles through EPL farming crystals and black lotus.
---
As a healer you’re never going to want for better gear. Usually you already have it in inventory when you reach the level to use it
---
Yea my guild is loot council and I feel kind of bad for some of the trial raiders that tag along, almost definitely not gonna get anything except the chance to roll on pvp items. They typically put in a lot less work though and are less likely to stay with the guild anyway so I guess it’s reasonable.
---
I am the Mage that does not blink when he sees someone going for a node first. I am that Mage that freely gives out Water to my fellow levellers. I am the Mage that buffs anyone they see, even if it means I need to drink after and thus cost me 30 seconds of my time. If it spares them 5 minutes the coming half an hour, I'll gladly take that trade.
---
Really, help others and they will help you in return. Why be a little bitch wanting everything for themselves whilst we're in this game together... it's an MMO for a reason.
---
What does he know? He’s just some guy who *doesn’t* waste his time ganking lowbies for upwards of an hour, doing so in a way that exploits guards, lying about it on reddit, and *still* ending up with a 3 day suspension.
---
Stay salty, jerk.
---
Yesterday I did cathedrale aoe farms and we had a warlock lvl 42 and 2 mages lvl 36.
---
The warlock was even with the mages when he could use hellfire and got overhealed (because the mobs in the novas attack everything in melee range.
---
But some days ago i had a run with lvl 42 mages and a 41 warlock  and the mages did double the dmg.
---
I dont know if the skill lvl was different and i I Think the 41 warlock did fire rain but in the end mages do more dmg
---
You don’t know the TOS and you’re missing the point of what happened.
---
This cannot be serious...
---
&lt;3 haha
---
I did this recently too. It works. But my character was not over level 30, that might have something to do with it. Make sure the new character is on a different account, not the same, otherwise the game knows it's you and won't allow it.
---
I use that macro too. I haven't seen anyone else figure that out yet. Also, how often do your r1 moonfires get resisted?
---
If you make a macro it would always dismount you, but on retail it would happen only when spell can be casted.
---
Maybe no shaman could be arsed to cough up 7000g?
---
It goes to the person willing to shoulder the price. Only if both a shaman and warrior are willing, the eye should go to the shaman.
---
Credit goes to [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d6bkkz/drew_this_while_waiting_for_my_warrior_to_bank/f0rsz5h/)
---
It doesn't matter how you get up there.  The point is that the guards can't touch you.  That's why it's against the rules.
---
No you're done cause your wrong. It's pretty damn clear, but you are making it difficult.
---
Can the guards get to you if they wanted to? Yes, then you are fine. No, then it's exploiting.
---
Psst don't tell anybody. I made about 10g just buying cheap silk cloth from the ah and afk crafting bandages :D
---
Haven't spent a dime yet, but yeah that is the reality for many, knowingly or not.
---
As a priest I don’t get why some people are so dead set on playing shadow in raids. Cause spamming mind flay and refreshing SWP periodically is just so enthralling? 🤷‍♂️
---
Grats man! Perfect thing to get before the honor grind starts :D
---
Should be combat anyway really for levelling.
---
That’s awesome dude, nice work!
---
What the fuck
---
Rare sight since everybody and their mother is making a female orc nowadays. AKA Green human.
---
Feint is a life saver.
---
Default hotkey is F I think. Select tank, type F, their target is your target now. Useful for healers too (especially if mob is switching aggro or you have many tanks - helpful to know who has aggro right now).
---
&gt; but getting the 9 ingots is the issue.
---
He said he bought them, so the ones he bought might've been gained from exploiting, you can't blame him for that lmao.
---
Is that a chinese copy of Armani?
---
Nah that's just not how servers work, there's a certain amount of space on every server not just in wow, you can run multiple instances on it or one and the capacity will still be the same, the only thing instances prevent is client side (your pc) crashes due to to many people/effects/ect and of course playability since you can actually do quests and stuff.
---
Make a twink and play with him. The leveling phase is so much fun to do together.
---
1. When it comes to choosing a race, do people think it's better to choose a race that 'feels' better or looks better? To be more specific, I was messing around on level 1-5 characters to help with deciding a race, but the ones that I felt I preferred (because of the class/race combo or model/animations) didn't look as good in level 60 gear when I checked how they appeared in BiS/tier sets.
---
2. Do shoulders on Night Elf females really look as if they're floating when the character runs? If you go to the Wowhead dressing room, select something like Truestrike/Lieutenant Commander's/Wyrmtongue shoulders and then choose the 'run' animation, it seems like there are massive gaps between the character model and the armour itself.
---
It's not so much about the stealth, but the decreased stats and constant damage stopping bandages. I felt this as a warrior too.
---
did you manage to solve this ? also having the same problem
---
That's literally exploiting layers.
---
Mouse macro's kids.......... jezus
---
Rogues, amirite? Pretty typical he feels 100% justified too. Hopefully OP realizes he needs to get a fucking life, but I doubt it.
---
But the long way takes you through spiders for a chance at spider silk
---
This. You can leave all remaining talents blank and you’ll still be able to heal to 50 well enough.
---
I too like to talk down to people, say things are "quiete easy" then proceed to tell them they should have 2 wow subscriptions and scan the market for arbitrage every 15 minutes.
---
By the way. While you were struggling to be humble, your route for thorium is bad.
---
To me using bugs is like cheating. And I do not find cheating acceptable in online games. Sure, this is a rather mild case and I my wording was a bit too harsh. But truth be told, I don't need to win people to my side who are okay with it. If I speak ill of people using bugs and get downvoted for it, then so be it.
---
This has absolutely nothing to do with thinking they are shit at the game (which I believe you meant). In my second Uldaman group someone proposed to use the bug, without even trying to do it the normal way first. We agreed to try it the normal way first and beat the boss without much trouble. Using this example and looking at the group in the twitch-clip, I am guessing that there are quite a few people who will just use the bug because they can and because it makes it a little easier. It is one thing to use it because nothing else works, but entirely different if you could beat him the regular way.
---
This also is not something subjective like your examples of music people listen to or what kind of clothes they wear. A bug and it's use is objectively something that was not meant to be possible. If it were a single player game, knock yourself out: play the game the way you want to. If it is an online game, with some form of competition or cooperation: I will always speak out against it. Hate me for it all you like.
---
Your pet is named NinaFlowers. RPDR reference?
---
I thought it was just a fancy term for a mage filled group
---
/r/enlightenedcentrism
---
&gt; p. It has recipes and items dropping from mobs not yet in the game, some with 100% drop rates that are much lower,
---
Yes, however it's easy to differentiate the two, one has a listed number of kills the other just has a drop rate.
---
&gt; You honestly can't be so blissfully naive that you think this guy and his guild were just so fortunate to have found/bought/farmed 9 ingots and 50 arcanite bars, without exploiting the game,
---
I don't think either way, i just think it's bullshit to accuse him of that when a trash tier server like mine is almost at the point where buying 9 ingots statistically reasonable.
---
Got rekt lol
---
The hard game which is tuned so that naked makes are literally doing more damage than a fully epic geared mage in actual 1.1.
---
Shouldn’t even get a warning. Players should be in control of the game.. not blizz
---
Really? You don't don't know why you'd be getting banned? Holy shit you're a dense fucker.
---
This is why i like spellcleaves we all understand eachothers need for mana
---
A good tank should not have any problems with this (assuming you don't start with immolate all the time).
---
Layering is rough on RP, since it sortof depends on meeting someone else who's interested in RP.
---
I've seen RP on both Grobbulus and Bloodsail, though it seems more common on BB...
---
Most RPers avoid PvP like the plague, as it is incomprehensible to them that Highlord Chad Thundercock, Grand Marshall of the Argent Crusade, Slayer of 20 Billion Orcs could *ever* get ganked and corpse camped by some *lowly* undead rogue.
---
You do now
---
Initial DPS translates to threat. If you charge in with sword and board doing hardly any damage while your mage and hunter are nuking the enemy you’re going to be spending a long time chasing enemies in the early game. Especially if you’re running pubs with scrubs
---
Yeah until we know the name there's not really any reason to continue. Could be a false report, more likely it's a bad name.
---
What can you tell us about the Martin Fury investigation?
---
If it’s to the detriment of others, yep it sure does mean that
---
Yeah, this happened to me atleast a dozen times in SM/ZF, I explained directly after it hapened and still had to kick probably 10 after they did it again.
---
Considering I've seen horde players make the same kinds of posts...
---
It's just a certain subset of the community; nothing to do with faction.
---
In Retail 99% of the Game is dead. Retail starts at Level120 while Classic starts at Level1. And with everything being so casual and convenient the World just feels super small.
---
Yes, It's his weapon. You can see they used the same model in WoD here https://www.wowhead.com/item=124378/xutenash-glaive-of-ruin&amp;bonus=1801#screenshots:id=759869
---
What a life
---
Man I had a long crappy night shift your comment made my day! Enjoy my gold!
---
How the fuck was he going to farm the Ingots when he couldn't even be part of that many resets, since the start of Vanilla? It's almost like you're a special kind of retarded and just don't want to understand it.
---
Wowhead classic has helped me out.
---
Tried that, didn’t feel like a rogue, but a shitty warrior. I respected to sub and though it might not be optimal, it’s way more fun. I also find myself eating/bandaging after 6-7 mobs instead of 3-4 with combat. Ambush crits and 15% dodge are nice 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
But it's also a PvP game. An entire faction of enemy players exists for you to be the adversary to. If you wanted to go do this to the opposite faction, that would be fine. THAT is the game, antagonize the enemy.
---
The fact that you do it to your allied players is what is scummy. If someone is hunting quest targets in the same area as you, just form a group and you'll both finish faster. That is the game for allies. Work together, save the aggression for the enemy.
---
Saves loads of space and could quickly get away in pvp situations. Why would it not be good?
---
But just because you spec ret and level as it, doesn't mean you need to try and play ret in dungeons. Just heal for dungeons.
---
All priests level as shadow and heal fine, druids level as feral, etc
---
&gt; What dungeons/quests/items are a must for Warlock?
---
The wand quest in Blackfathom Deeps gives a very nice wand for the level.
---
You put icetrap but start with serpent shot :s
---
Worth noting that for a lot of this early Shadow damage gear you have to give up stamina. Very not ideal if you give yourself in PvP often.
---
It was against the rules in 2005, why wouldn't it be now?
---
9% is special cap, but once you get good gear and world buffs/consumes if you tryhard you have to think about the critt cap if you dual wield.
---
The critt cap with 0% hit is 26.5% with white swings (special attacks are 40% higher since they dont suffer from glancing blows)
---
So if you add 9% ontop off 26.5 you end up on 35.5% critt cap.
---
Later on that becomes a problem and around 11-12% hit is good.
---
I'm glad I don't get any boost, it's just boring and kills the aim of an rpg game to explore the world and lvl your character in your own tempo.
---
That GM can go fuck himself.
---
All the healers and tanks share this sentiment and I'm just laughing as the rogue who's always pick pocketing and skinning during pulls until harassed to stop and dps
---
Damn I'm glad I went to winterspring when I was was lvl 33 to buy the patterns. I died a lot on the way but it seems worth it now. 
---
Back then the area was deserted. /who showed only me.
---
Tried using /cast first but then I have to use other "mod:"s in order to make it work, I mean it works but not really what I was trying to get.
---
When it can be looted!
---
Depends who started it. I always defend my fellow horde if they are attacked.
---
It's personal preference and yeah some items float or clip oddly, I'd say 2005 problems but I'm pretty sure it happens in bfa
---
Travel form gets you away fast wtf is the rest of it for
---
Hunter here.
---
My assumption is that the tank is the leader of the group unless anything indicates otherwise. As long as it is reasonable, just do things the way the tank wnats it. The only usualy exception to this is that the tank has to respect mana users need to pause.
---
As far as Multishot goes, you really dont need it to clear packs. As long as you dont pull aggro, any reasonable DPS is enough to get the job done. Auto Shot + Serpent Sting + Arcane Shot + pet is gonna be enough, and then you can shove MS in there if it is safe (no CC to break and tank has built threat on the pack). Not grabbing aggro is probably the #1 thing you can do to make runs go smoothly.
---
Agreed. 
---
The 5 sec rule stops when the cast is completed not when you begin casting.
---
Yellow cap is 9%, white cap is uncreachable, you want as much crit as you can get and you want hit to prevent crit capping.
---
You can fight back, you just have to stay in that same room. As soon you go to the bridge leading into it our up to the quest giver room above you will be attacked. The same goes for the rogue.
---
Druids and shamans with thorns/lightning shield or other effects are free kills if you just hit them once and they keep running into either of these areas because guards will finish them off.
---
That may well be possible, but if that's the case he's definitely getting banned. No way do you get your hands on the first legendary of Classic WoW and not have Blizz devs check into your account history when people are already being banned for layering abuse.
---
We'll find out eventually.
---
If you see this as a life hack, damn.
---
Skull = kill first, Cross = kill second
---
Square/Moon = mage cc 
---
Triangle = rogue/druid cc
---
Diamond / Orange / Star = mark patrols, etc
---
I have definitely seen this too and it sucks but the what I do then is 1) try and tell people what they are doing wrong politely 2) add good people and try and form groups with them only.
---
&gt; We're talking better odds than winning the lottery, here. 
---
No we're not. We're talking about ONE of the most populated servers out there and you're saying, 9 ingots seems fishy? It takes on average 27 runs to get the required ingots. How exactly is that fishy?
---
Firemaw definitely got way more pugs/guilds reaching and killing Golemagg every week.
---
That's way less efficient.  I don't have to play the game how you want
---
People talking about layer exploit cause of a wrong assumption. Later exploit worked only in dungeons, NOT in raids. 
---
When Esfand could do a second MC raid in the same week, that was cause of a unrelated different bug.
---
3 mages, 1 warlock, and 1 priest. The priest bubbles the warlocks eye of killrogg, which the warlock then uses to try and pull as many mobs as possible. Once the movs are pulled they'll group up nicely for the mages to rotate their ice novas to keep them in place while they all blizzard for massive aoe, the lock and rain of fire or alternatively hellfire for more mass aoe. You can pull the entire cathedral and the boss at once with this method and not wipe, just tank margarine with the lock pet while everything else is aoe'd down.
---
It's a matter of adaptation. If you have a buddy tank who knows how you like to play and is happy with it, cool. If you talk to the random tank before and he's cool with it, great. If you don't communicate and just start chain pulling out with a tank who's not prepared or willing to play like that you deserve to wipe.
---
Other side is always the worst no matter which side you are on.
---
Ikr I legit couldn't beleive it, imagine being so socially inept that you have to compensate for it in game hahahaha
---
Well it's a video game so lifehack is not technically correct. Good catch!
---
How could he exploit layers in raid when raids have unique raid ID and lock outs?

You're the tank. Lay down the law. Use marks, have a kill order, and tell the dps to wait a few seconds . Charge in, revenge and sunder the main target, pop bloodthirst, maybe use a demo shout, and then get threat on other mobs. Maintain threat and pool your rage for the next pull. Rinse, repeat, win. All with a 1Hander and shield.
---
I am playing a tank druid and felt this in my soul. I'd have mages start blizzard before I even reach the mobs then kite them back away from me, then complain that they stole agro.
---
Why play a mage then?
---
I rarely run dungeons with randoms either. I love doing it with my friends on discord, but there are soooo many people who have no clue about anything. People who dont care about threat at all. Shadow Priests who didnt even bind any heals, mages who forget how to kite as soon as they enter a dungeon. Warlocks pulling mobs on another level of elevation because they misplaced their aoe...dps warriors panic fearing 5 mobs they pulled by charging in before the tank, subsequently pulling 20 mobs and causing wipes...Ive had it all. The most infuriating of all is range dps opening on caster mobs while I am trying to LOS them and then asking me why I dont have aggro on that mage....bitch, taunt has 2 armlengths of range....I tried bringing them in but you couldnt keep your frostbolt in your pants...
---
Another way to slightly shorten these is to use **form** in place of **stance**  (form:1 instead of stance:1)  This allowed me to add a /startattack to both button 1 macros. Just to make it work better with what I was expecting to happen when I have no rage to perform an attack.
---
See? Even with my crappy farming routes have acquired over a thousand gold already. Imagine someone who knows what he's doing can achieve.
---
In _**dungeons**_ not in raids that bind your character to a unique ID so that you cant join any other group's run or _layer_
---
It's not a gamble because there hasn't been a statement on what they are doing with wow classic content, so no one is banking on anything. They can have some members of the old dev team consult and give over basic information so the current team can do their job. So it's completely possible, your speculation is over
---
On vuhdo I can set a message that says what I’m doing but I don’t use it often
---
I'm pretty sure each realm is not a single physical server. Also you definitely can cause realmwide crashes from too much teaffic, I've seen it before. Swifty got a temp ban on darkspear for organizing a server crash by overpopulating a single area
---
It's so if you're swimming it gives you aquatic form instead. And if you're in combat you get a HoT on you so you don't die. Also wanted to add Nature's Grasp but it would likely take up too much space.
---
If I'm levelling mostly through dungeons, are daggers better than swords? Also, I'm finding it hard to keep up SnD when backstabbing, should I be SS/SnDing with daggers? Or backstabbing and SnD? Or backatab and evisc?
---
Anyone know of a chrome extension I can get to block any thread with a youtube video from showing up?  Bonus points if it auto blocks the poster
---
cath and armory are easy because you can just mouse over the door and it will tell ya, graveyard and library is always 50/50 for me though lol.
---
You are. Shame you don't know it.
---
That's why you tank in Berserker stance and build aggro with Whirlwind.
---
Short:
---
Struggle with mana until geared with T1-T2
---
At that point you can literally heal for ever..
---
I just reset the mob whenever that happens. Ain't killing someone else's tag.
---
While samwise is extremely talented, and his style being used as the base for most art in blizzard currently, It's not really fair to say he is light-years ahead of metzen, as their art styles are very very different.
---
Samwise is more vibrant and colorful (think cartoony, high fantasy) while metzens is a lot darker and rougher (think dnd and old fantasy).
---
Random, but what server you on?
---
No joke, we were doing a BRD run, and this warlock literally lifetaps everything except the smallest sliver of life, then we do a 2 molten destroyer pack and he dies in one hit. I say in guild chat 'and that's why you don't lifetap everything' and our tank just laughed.
---
You should always have a priest if you plan on comp spamming arathi, tell him to sit his ass at lumber mill and mind control enemies off the cliff, that's it, lumber mill dominance, doesn't matter what spec he is.
---
Having a threat meter is more important than a damage meter. Details can provide both but the threat meter will keep you alive.
---
Hmm talk about those satyre in satyrnaar and their horrid curse. Its a real pain in the ass to be stunned regularly.
---
I don't disagree, I levelled as sub in Vanilla in fact, but these days seeing something like 5% hit, sprint/evasion CD reduction, Riposte dealing Backstab levels of damage **and** disarming the target every few hits, and having a cleave later on whilst never actually having to rely on the terrible stealth we get in Vanilla? Oh boy oh boy. Can't pass it up. :( maybe when in the 50s it might be worthwhile with more talents &amp; higher ranks of Stealth.
---
The gloves from Cath
---
If you read further into it you will realize that all they did were putting all maces, swords, daggers at a fixed multiplicator for attackpower that is added on top of your instant attack. This means they made sure any mace from 2.1 to 2.8 Attackspeed gets calculated with 2.4 Speed.  
---
However Sinister Strike deals Weaponbasedamage+fixed damage. Which means highest weapondamage beats everything on mainhand. And how do slow weapons have similar dps to fast ones despite swinging less often? Right, by having higher weaponbasedamage.
---
Restart the client? Maybe you got in after an update?
---
What if you want to rejuv out of combat?  What if you're in combat and you want to travel form?  Like this macro makes no sense I truly still have no clue what you want it to do.  Rejuv then travel form?  That's terribe what if you need to rejuv without travel.form or rejuv more than once in a row
---
If you have two mages in the group you no longer need the tank to hold aggro because you can aoe and kite the mobs.
---
Everywhere
---
You get your own seperate flight path... in the back of the zone.
---
They may be nolifers, but telling a nolifer CS:GO player that he's cheating and exploiting are two pairs of shoes. Somebody may not have much going outside his ingame life, atleast he's honest and not cheating.
---
Dishonesty and being a failure in real life are really quite different.
---
They must be some lucky fuckers, back in the day in over 50 didn’t even see 3.
---
Who is he? The OP in this thread was in a space on a roof where guards could not engage which is why the GM stepped in and warned them. The OP in the thread I linked uploaded a photo showing themselves killing people in the ship in booty bay which is counted as a rooftop where guards are not able to go.
---
Man, I strive for this attitude and it really bears fruit sooner than later.
---
Oh ok.  Gl justdrop
---
Mostly because you're fucking irritating.
---
running prot right now at 49, and i'm probably gonna go for some holy-prot hybrid so i can kill the monotany of spamming flash of light in dungeons later
---
Leveling as a Feral tank and switching to heals at 60 is a well-worn path. Druid tanks are more than adequate for all 5-man content even at max level. 
---
P.S. Tauren is the best, worst, and only Horde Druid race.
---
Yeah Incompatible means you are missing a patch.
---
Savage Gladiator Chain. Man that shit is so rare, yet so good for fury and prot warriors.
---
Yes and no tbh, if i’m -2 i don’t feel to oblidged to refill it, but it’s nice to have a full bag
---
To be fair, adding guns wouldn't just affect roof camping, it would affect things like kiting them too.
---
26 Silver and 23 Copper for free best vendor day!

---
When you say plowed do you mean repeatedly died and rezzed again and again until you were close enough to go inside rfc?
---
I mean it soaks full of water
---
Dude I’m going to have to follow your account for these! Keep it up! Love your art style!
---
Damn for real I’m begging people for 60g for my 40 mount lolol. I picked up ench and tailoring soo don’t make money.
---
Just look at the screen shots in that thread, one of his pics is a photo of a pile of bodies they ganked in the ship on top of the inn, which is a rooftop guards can not access, which is considered terrain exploiting as spelled out by the GM convo shown at the top of this thread.
---
You cant play a nelf warrior and win in PvP. This is cheating according to the min-max police.
---
Hillarious.. ppl basicly did that 24/7 and why shouldn’t you.. just enjoy the game ur not on a pvp Server to PVE all day long.
---
Never heared anything of that
---
I wonder if stealth is the same way.  In retail it seems like they've got stealth figured out for many years now, but in Vanilla and BC (and maybe Wrath) it felt like Stealth would randomly break for no reason.
---
I remember times when I would go AFK stealthed and come back unstealthed and alive but with nothing in my combat log.  Or other times where I would be just stealthing along and suddenly I'm unstealthed, but not in combat.  I always wondered if it was just like NPC non-damaging AOE'S or self buffs that were somehow breaking stealth.
---
Lmao it actually does increase your hit chance with a pole - so if you have lvl 300 you can probably reliably hit a lvl 60.
---
It probably helped thst samwise could focus on just art (and their band) while metzen had to do like 15 different things, story, art, development (he also did coding) running the company etc.
---
I've played in just about all the blizzlike Pserver and I never knew about this shortcut.
---
I always took the shortcut through the mountains past Sun Rock Retreat.
---
Enlighten us then!
---
If the mage gets a jump on you?
---
I /pat gnomes
---
I've found full clothie groups solves this :D Everyone is actually aware how much mana others have.
---
Sininster Strike deals 100% Weapondamage+fixed amount of extra damage. Which means highest weapondamage beats everything else for Mainhand. Offhand people usually recommend a fast weapon for poisons, but honestly the speed of your offhand is mostly irrelevant UNTIL you get 5 points in sword specialization, because then it does become meaningful to have a fast weapon in Offhand.  
---
Why? Because that 5% Chance for an extra strike will alway trigger onto your mainhandweapon. So effectively that talent reads: _5% Chance on any Strike to deal 100% Mainhanddamage_. Thus at this point as fast Offhand is best and a maximum base damage mainhand is best.
---
😞
---
Private server turds.
---
I have rejuv as a seperate spell if I need to use it as a caster. I wanted this to check if you were in combat and if then cast rejuv and then Travel form. So you don't have to worry about casting Rejuv while running away. If you're out of combat you can use it without triggering Rejuv. This way you can use it even while in bear form by just clicking travel form twice.
---
As a tank, is it ok to let a hunter pet tank 1 mob in a particularly hard pull or an overpull to reduce stress on the healer?
---
Not what I asked.
---
I've done that in my cringey teenage years.
---
Hot water was brutal on it.
---
Is that really rp friendly?
---
Oh, I'm dumb. You're talking about mana spring and I'm talking about mana tide. Sorry.
---
Hot take: Scarlet Monastery is terrible for you as a player.
---
It teaches you the easiest boss fights, it fully supports and creates a cleave meta, no strategy or tactics. Just pull 6/9 mobs and cleave them down.
---
Then you hit Zul'Farrak where the trash mobs deal about double, maybe even triple of the SM goon DPS.. I've had so many problems as a tank/dps Warrior due to not being able to support the cleave playstyle as a 42, or even a 44.. Waited till 46 to run ZF.  
---
Uldaman isn't that bad in my experience, and you get a bunch of mineable ore, but it does ramp up in difficulty fast so you can't do the whole thing lower level usually.
---
read the GM convo, the guy specifically asks about the ship in booty bay on top of the inn... the same ship the OP uploaded photos of showing him sitting on top of it... and the GM states that ANY space like that is considered terrain exploiting because it acts like a roof and guards can't get up there.
---
Bruh, it actually does use the fishing skill as weapon skill
---
Shield can't block my windfury crits if the shield is Purged.
---
You sure talk about buy scripts a lot.  What's your ign, for science?
---
Dont worry after your 30th run of SM you will have this burned into your brain forever
---
&gt;Well, usually warlocks will see the skull and feel there is no point in putting dots on it because it will die too fast. Actually, a lot of dps are like that: they'll nuke some mob that they think they'll have for themselves for a bit.
---
 Guilty of that I guess. On skull I usually put up just corruption. Then I cast Coa and Corruption on secondary target. Wait a bit and then throw an immolate on secondary target if it seems like the tank is holding the aggro well. Playing alliance, if paladin in the party so I have salvation I throw on the immolate right after CoA and Corruption.
---
They always tend to be the most cynical people
---
RP and RPPvP servers have special naming rules that dont apply to regular servers. All player names have to be a legit name; no hidden messages or double meanings or meme names. I played on an RP server since Vanilla in Retail WoW and seen this rule implemented so many times. My IRL friend lost his name Bigguns the same way right before TBC launched.
---
That said, without knowing the actual name, it's hard to agree or disagree with Blizzards choice but they don't just force renames without actually  looking at the name so there had to be something that crossed the line.
---
There is a floor on how many of certain mobs exist at a time. So if there are 100 boars total, and the floor is 10, when it drops below that, they will respawn back up to 10 boars even if the normal respawn timer wasn't hit.
---
You both sound pretty cringe to be honest. The fact that you post it on here for validation or whatever means you probably win the little contest between the two of you.
---
I am on a no queue server, and have had this since launch, i just thought it was the way it was meant to be. i only have toons on a single server.
---
At least his post is informative, who cares if he's humble or not.
---
You’d be the dick I’d let die in the wild and block you do I didn’t accidentally help you anytime in any way possible.  Enjoy your rank moon spam loser
---
Youre just mad cuz youre wrong. Im far from trying to be elitist.
---
There should just be one hostile lvl100 elite rogue on every roof that oneshot ambushes anyone who tries to jump on it.
---
Everyone thinks that
---
That can be helpful you just have to really aware when the healer pulls that mob off the pet. :P
---
Honestly depends. What class and race are you looking at?
---
Amazing
---
This is why it is frustrating when you see the community on reddit and the battle.net forums telling people "just play what you want!" because people like useless feel-good positivity more than realistic advice. 
---
There will be a great many just like you when they get around to hitting 60, unable to find a guild willing to carry their moonkin druid or dps paladin. A successful raid group is going to have a ton of people trying to join. Why settle for the least valuable applicants?
---
Unlike many other similar specs, shadow priests have the benefit of actually being useful. Unfortunately the competition for that single shadow priest slot is extremely fierce and is much more likely go to the guild's leadership or one of their friends.
---
Dude if you have rejuv bound why would you ever want it in this macro.  You're not making any sense what if you want to travel form in combat without rejuv first.  You're just making all these nutty self limiting things in this macro that reduce your control over your character
---
How do i make sure thr patch is updated? Shouldn't it download on its own?
---
Thats a human.
---
I'm kinda baffled by the "just give guards guns" comments. I'm pretty sure they have guns. I've been knocked around the boat in booty bay when I tried to MC allies into the water.
---
When healing or ele, is wearing cloth with high Int dumb?
---
Like +10 on your cloth piece when your best leather piece has +5?
---
How can you bandage him with al the mobs on you?
---
What are the best guides for leveling as a druid?
---
its hilarious watching all these obvious communists cry about not having communism in a game about going to war. tag on brother tag on
---
They unfortunately just missed the mark of a good balance too. Should have improved Elite quest rewards and given rare spawns good item rewards and stuck them in all the random castles, caves, and keeps around the world.
---
There was definitely room for both in vanilla.
---
I didn't see you mention cleave or whirlwind. Might be worth trying those out too since you're switching to zerker anyway.
---
didnt even know this was a thing. i had nothing like that happen but i do player healer so people dont tend to mind my lvl much
---
Yet they did that with the ddos thing and its definetely more expensive.
---
Get to 60
---
I feel baited into a tard convo
---
I’d rather a Tauren Warrior dual wielding tree trunks with splattered gnome parts decorating the tip.
---
Not at 60 yet, but my favorite content is rep grinding. Also I have done pretty much everything low level dozens of times through twinks and alts pre-cata. I want to get to 60 to do dungeons and raids at their appropriate difficulty, not with BC/wrath gear and levels.
---
In the north of redridge? My buddy and I realized that too, the pigs spawn instantly after you kill them. Good place to do the quest and farm some cooking/skinning
---
What you mean I shouldn't bubble the tank?
---
- clueless priest.
---
More info: I had to explain to someone why, I the priest, wasn't PW:Shielding the warrior.
---
&gt; What was your end game with this post.
---
wow you are triggered af. lmao sounds like the post is a success
---
[Twitter has all my stuff](https://twitter.com/TallFrodo/media)
---
or [Tapas for just the comics](https://tapas.io/TallFrodo)
---
As said I believe it is rather useful to not have to worry about using Rejuv while running away.
---
I don’t see how any tanking hunter build is viable since you would never hold threat meleeing vs other DPS.
---
Of course and that's why the server crashes at launch, overpopulation and it would have happened with one layer or 10 it just means that the game didn't crash your client. And if it's not a physical server there's still a set amount of space available even if the instances are spread among the "world server".
---
Thank you sir, big ups!
---
Okay, and in my experience after getting a character force renamed I couldn't. You cannot take a banned name.
---
Don't forget bubble
---
Do not worry, you are not alone :)
---
9% for raids, 5% for pvp, this will not cap your autoattacks, but once you hit the cap it is not an optimal stat to gear for.  
---
also
---
ALWAYS STAND BEHIND THE ENEMY WHEN DPSING
---
Na my dick is already 3”  why would I need it bigger? It’s all about the motion in the ocean.
---
It’s not always the hunter.  I had a warlock voidwalker pull three full packs in RFD last week.  Why the fuck he had his voidwalker out instead of imp was my first question...
---
Ok man gl with your macro this is just going to devolve into me calling you bad
---
as someone who mained healer since 2008, there is so much entitled bitching in this thread that it makes me sick. You know what is more expensive than half a drink? the repair cost of a wipe..
---
Stop acting like you are doing everyone a favor by simply existing please..
---
I think that Phase 2 is coming in November the latest, mid October the earliest.
---
The Hunter can align his traps for CC, can effectively 'cancel' bad pulls and can pull with AE threat to prevent initial healing threat. Having someone else pull also means the Warrior can charge the fight location instead being forced to charge the spawn (or not charge at all).
---
So that I can support this behaviour? I dont want to see a good excuse for people to claim LFG tool is better
---
That shouldn't happen if the hunter is selectively using growl in that situation. The tank may want to let the hunter know it's ok to do that, as the "turn off growl in dungeons you &amp;$#@* huntard" message gets hammered a bit hard sometimes.
---
Everyone else can do that too that's not the extra mile. You take a Mage or lock that also takes consumes, and you negate your entire "extra mile". On top of the fact you would be doing less damage than them even with your consumables.
---
Good luck to you too.
---
&gt; You underestimate the ~~power~~ triggeredness of ~~community~~ a bunch of sjws on the internet

I guess people just have to slow down a bit after the retail experience. Classic is chill, we're nilot in a hurry.

---
Really? I've seen someone up there every time I go to Tanaris lol
---
I feel like your question is null at this point. If being on the roof, regardless of how you got there, makes it so NPC guards cannot get to you, then it is not allowed. Doesn't matter if you were "clever" or just walked up there.
---
2spooky4me
---
Relatively few people like spending all of their time in a raid staring at green bars on their UI, and being shadow makes it much more convenient to do things out in the world and engage in pvp when you aren't raiding.
---
Dual wielded viper stings for like 10 levels. Shit's good.
---
You dont want to use beastial wrath on cooldown.
---
Its a situational ability for hard situations such as a hard pull of mobs, or pvp.

---
Thats actually bannable, good think you hide your screen. Oh wait
---
Im doing that. Idk why it didnt update originally. But it is now.
---
I've had to explain that to priests as a dps.  You're not headed for a smooth run when a mage has to whisper the healer and teach them something.
---
This is fine (this is fine)
---
*WowgoldDOTcom16171 invited you to join text channel*
---
If only Tremor Totem could dispel it.
---
No only 1 rejuv per Druid.
---
Tauren are the only race on horde that can be Druid’s.
---
Druid’s are good but generally you will either tank or heal in raids ( the majority healing)
---
But every class can get a raid spot just fine so just play what you want.
---
you have missed the two biggest quest chains :P
---
Undead or Tauren. Every other race looks dumb, imo.
---
fool me once next time i see you duying i wont heal or help and ill fake cast your moonfire n lol at u
---
Ohhhh that's when that happened. Man I can't lie it's been so long I forgot what expansion did what.
---
Great tips. If you were a hunter, would you do anything different?
---
&gt; most raids will have one dedicated purely to just spamming rank one Healing Wave on the tank during raids to maintain ancestral healing
---
What? No they won't.  Priests are the tank healers for Horde and priests have Inspiration which doesn't stack with Ancestral Healing.
---
I play a tank and spam dungeons a lot. I tell DPS to count to 3 Mississippi before starting. They don't listen, pull agro, run away from me toward the healer, then complain about pulling agro still.... but I try to explain.
---
You spelled “huntard” wrong...
---
i like now during the aoe meta warlocks think they can hellfire constantly on every pull
---
It was never proven that this is true actually. It is very possible that you could layer inside of raids. Being checked for the Raid ID occured at the instance portal.
---
Think it's 30 to get in mara
---
I /lick everyone and tell them if they taste good or not as undead
---
Kinda ruins it knowing there’s cheating no life’s like this playing, oh well enjoy tha ban layer breaker
---
Some people have done it a million times.  I had 4 60s back 15 years ago.
---
Not to mention the couple I leveled on private servers and the one I played on the Classic beta to 40.
---
oj amd ih when this happens i reset aggro n will fear ur mobs everytime i can good luck with ur quest
---
Been seeing alot of " EXTREMELY GEARED GEARED XXX CLASS LFG XXXXXXX"

Exactly, my friend was farming yetis for 2 hours. Went away, came back: got it in 2 kills. GG.

You know you have to get out to resset :P
---
Sorry.
---
I wish I knew how to make Weak Auras. I always forget to inner fire. I'll have to sit down with it tonight and tinker.
---
Have you been to any inn during peak queue times?  
---
I could often hardly see the innkeeper from all the people AFKing
---
Esfand showed it was done on stream with MC. (although he did it by accident).
---
This is wildly inaccurate, BW needs to be used on cooldown to maximize dps while lvling.
---
You've sold me on the idea it is legit.  With the population difference and Horde dominance, this is more like 5+ vanilla realm population.
---
Layering is keeping us all apart right now. Plus most RPers are still leveling.
---
When layering is turned off and more of his hit 60 it'll be more common.
---
My favorite are the shirts and bags that are "made by Mom" on Skeram. I bet she makes bank.
---
Is this only true for certain mobs? Because I definitely have had all mobs cleared out for extended periods of time.
---
no u

Appreciate the sentiment of the post (and I think most sensible people will agree with it) but

\&gt; Charge &gt; Bloodlust &gt; Thunder clap &gt; Berserker stance &gt; Berserker Rage &gt; Defensive stance &gt; demo shout &gt; Shield block (if revenge proc use revenge) &gt; Revenge &gt; Sunder Armor 
---
is a bit off, you can grab aoe threat quicker by doing some of these things before you charge in, such as zerker rage and bloodrage (I assume that's what you meant by bloodlust) because you're not wasting GCDs midpull that way. Granted you get slightly less rage overall by doing this, but 100% worth it for faster threat.
---
All what Activision-Blizzard wants. Want to keep the profit from server transfers flowing.
---
We need one for tanks! My only priority is the healer. If a dps constantly pulls aggro they can tank the mob. It’s then up to the healer if they want to let them die :P
---
When I Rez a little angel pops up in their health bar in blizzard raid frames. Thought it did when others rezzed too but now 2nd guessing myself
---
So as a paladin I honestly plan on utilizing all roles but 
---
For raiding I will be healing
---
For PvP I will be rolling a reckoning build retribution build 
---
And for dungeons or world questing I’ll be tanking or retribution.
---
They're only level 15, so even if they aren't (I can't remember) they shouldn't aggro on you very easily.
---
Looks like the Horde equivalent farm in Arathi, sounds like the mage was learning to aoe grind solo. If they've never solo aoe'd before there'll probably be a few deaths before they figure it out.
---
But ye, if he's using arcane explosion instead of blizz solo they're going to have a bad time.
---
That is ridiculous and you are just flat out wrong.
---
what is the purpose of this kind of posts? you tryin to convince more people to transfer? and if yes, why? do you have insecurity issues?
---
Why is a combat Rogue stealthing?
---
Yea my group failed when we tried to kill the elite adds. When we decided to just burn he down we actually killed him.
---
I would definitely recommend that as "the" strat. We had a 46 war, 43 pally, 43 priest, 42 mage/hunter and did fine.
---
You can't see enemy buffs in classic

RP is one of those things you have to either stumble upon, or start yourself. Luckily, there is an addon that helps RPers identify one another: Total RP 3
---
This lets you mark yourself as an RP character, lets you make a profile, the likes. That way you can see someone is an RPer even if they are not currently engaged in it.
---
Same with me, but with hearthstone/apex legends.
---
True, %t is only replaced in the actual message, it cannot be used to target someone. I guess a "/w Someguy Innervate on %t" would still work, wouldn't it?
---
You can cone of cold and arcane explosion down mobs just fine. You’re at an AoE grinding spot and the mage was probably learning the ropes and frustrated already then decided whatever you did was annoying as well.
---
Wtf? No, absolutely no. You run the dungeon, you have the right to need! If you need something for your alts/off spec/'need' enchantig mats, you ASK FIRST.
---
As a tank I let them tank it. Love those shamans that use earth shock and cause insane threat. Or the lovely hunters that blow up a mob before I even manage to land a single sunder.
---
There is no reason at all to use a 1h and shield in low level dungeons. You get very very little mitigation bonus from it at low levels and you get far more rage, damage and threat with a 2hander. Again. Period the end. This is a fact and anything else you are saying is just wrong.
---
This guy get it...
---
yeah true if you add weapon skill it lowers your hit cap, yeah your next goal is crit cap lol
---
That’s the tank gets priority.
---
Probably abused the layering bug and reset the raid.
---
&gt; enhancement is not useless.
---
Noone is talking about PvP when they say useless, only PvE dps
---
The old, long AV's made gaining rep nearly impossible. I agree — they were enjoyable in their own sick, funny way.
---
I thought the shorter patched version was excellent. With a little cooperation, you could really make a difference.
---
&gt;The GM in the picture is literally telling us it isn't. lol.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;It's like a thief sneaking into your house through an open window. 
---
Yes but no.
---
This is a reproduction of my house. this is a theme park we set 15 years ago. And if the park operators wanted to fix the problem of people entering the house through the window they would have closed the window.
---
But they didn't close the window. They specifically and intentionally left the window open. They know full well that every day,  hundreds of times a day, people were entering through the window but they made a conscious decision that we want to live in the past.
---
We are all here to go back to that time where people broke into our house through the window.
---
This is literally why we are here. we want to experience people breaking into our house again - in this little sandbox of a playground of a world that used to be.
---
I've created a holodeck recreation of my house with the window open so that people can break into my house.
---
- If it were my house then yes there be a problem
---
- but since it's the recreation of my house it's not a problem
---
Honor comes in Phase 2 and Battlegrounds in Phase 3, it is only given to warriors so they can farm them faster for shamans.
---
&gt; If blizzard were responsible and cared about their customers
---
If they weren't scummy and gave even one inch of a damn about the consumer beyond their wallet, then yes. But this is *Activision-Blizzard*. One of the greediest companies on the planet owned by one of the wealthiest individuals in existence.
---
This is a great list! What's the 5 second rule for healers?
---
yeah I'm actually a fan of some of the original vanilla zones not being filled out with quests yet (such as dustwallow marsh and silithus), nice to have zones with very few quests where you can grind and mostly be left in peace
---
FP are faction specific so all night elf/dwarf/human/gnome ones you can access along with neutral ones. The Astanaar one should be there unless horde killed it which you need to wait for respawn.
---
You can heal as shadow to 60, and anyone who 'loses confidence' in you is a tool
---
That's a common misconception
---
It's a decent spec but honestly very overrated. Everything just revolves around your cb evis and if it's not up, just don't fight anyone. The best all around pvp spec is definitely imp sprint daggers but you need good gear for it to work against good players.
---
Id be interested to know what you do for a living
---
The answer to douchebaggery is not to be a douchebag yourself. The solution lies with the douchebag to stop being a douchebag.
---
The reality is no guild would sell those items. If op is legit, then the ingots purchased are probably not. The announce of the banhammer made people panic and they probably sold the ingots before someone got banned.
---
Oom
---
Fuck that. As a Holy Pala I'm throwing heals at you to make this run go faster.
---
Cool, now solo it
---
As a rogue, if I need a particular bow from a 5 man I’ll either make sure the hunter has it already or just make a run with no warrior, no rogue, no hunter
---
Oh so I have nothing to worry about
---
what addon ur using ?
---
Get a horse, get to 60, then farm out rep with darnassus and get a tiger
---
Yeah it’s tricky. I’m mostly a PvPer though and getting Netherwing is so important for mages in PvP. 
---
It’s all very well being able to kite people and reset battles with poly but that’s not much use if you die to two good crits. You can get globalled by rogues and warriors if you’re only in dungeon blues.
---
&gt; All horde is kill on site. IDC if they are 30 levels lower, just means I have to waste less time removing them from Azeroth.
---
And so the vicious cycle continues anew.
---
Took the plunge and switched to ele from enh at 32. So its totems, shocks on CD, and spam lightning bolt? Or do I use chain lightningband justbd4ink more?
---
You could try 
---
/target (replace with desired target) 
---
Not very optimal, but it helps if you're looking for a single npc
---
I was thinking this as well, maybe it's something to do with in combat spirit regen?
---
I'm not starting an argument over this, I got kicked, and after that I just made my own group of unfortunate people. I just feel its not right to do this, if it sounds whiny so be it, it shouldn't be part of a community that wants the game to not have LFG tool for me
---
Wowhead has some really good ones
---
ever make that guide?
---
You have a right to your opinion, and you have good reasons for it. I hope people will stop downvoting you. 
---
You may only have to wait 5 more years to get a LK server.
---
Have fun getting owned in pvp cuz of cooldown on BW
---
Those people are idiots. You click one button and then watch the health bars again lol
---
Every little helps
---
He's 47.
---
Lvl 47, 26, and 13 here. Slowly trying to pull myself back to my 47
---
I’m sure you remember exactly how many you saw back in the day 15 years ago 🙄🙄
---
Does anyone have a good addon for buff timers
---
Yep. I 100% understand the nO cHaNgEs thing but no bgs at all while leveling to break things up has been disappointing for me.
---
Man this is everything that’s wrong with blizzard to me. Every time I see one of these exploitation warnings or bans all I can think of is some scrawny teenager with bad hygiene nerd raging because you aren’t playing his DnD campaign the way he wants you to. 
---
Short of actually hacking or using some software to effect the game, blizzard really needs to fuck off on people figuring shit out in the game.
---
Well aren’t you a bundle of joy? You get more bees with honey than vinegar.
---
Now I'm not a system admin at blizzard but I would expect each layer to be running separately. We do know that each layer has its own population cap and that the cap for a layer is smaller than the cap for a realm. When they increased the max realm pop they did it by increasing the number of layers, not by increasing the cap of each layer. Only having one layer with the population of ten layers presents problems either way though.
---
There are people who claim anyone who hit 60 in the first 2 weeks was layer abusing, or spellcleaving 10 man dungeons "exploit". I've seen comments that "the real, legitimate 60's" are just starting to get there.
---
Every thread where hardcore players post themselves in high-end loot, world firsts, etc, it's "layer exploit".
---
Not sure how far it extends and to what extent. We were just told about the system near launch by blizz employees, not sure if all of the boars in a certain zone, continent, or what count towards the floor for boars you might be killing.
---
One with +healing
---
Tanks have 2 purposes in Classic right now
---
1) tank single target bosses in raids and dungeons
---
2) form a tight stack so mages can aoe down entire packs of mobs at one time
---
Sorry to inform but the tank meta in dungeons is dead except for the super casual audience. Every warrior I played with on the path to 60 was deep arms and just used a two hander. Their only job is to take a Priest shield and body pull as much as the group can handle.
---
Warlocks never run out of mana. He just steals it from the healer 🤣
---
Yes, healing and then going into melee helps with initial aggro a bit. That's why I ask to heal me only during combat. Between fights I can heal myself.
---
I always try to find a mage to my groups so I can ask for a frost nova, pop out of bear double hot myself ang go in again if our healer is oom during the fight. The only trick is to warn melee so the get away from frozen mobs while I step back.
---
If you don't like it. Make your own group. You are not entitled to anyone else's group and they can remove you before it starts for any reason.
---
That’s not an RP name IMO
---
Please do a rendition of the Navy seals pasta &lt;3
---
the /who function got blocked by blizzard, mostly to stop the census addon, probably something like that messing with you
---
at 60 u can make 50g an hr selling princess runs to people who wany the ring.
---
it should but sometimes it is dumb.
---
Thanks for those that replied. I did find a fix that is sort of simple but still a bit silly: Zoning into an instance.
---
Zoning into an instance seems to fix the bug. Unfortunately, this seems to also cause the bug. Played around a bit with it last night and this was the only fix I could find for now.
---
Basically, I would zone in and out of an instance with my imp summoned until phase shift was casted. I do wonder about a longer term solution but maybe this will help others for now.
---
&gt;slow is steady, steady is fast
---
As a horde player, I'm ashamed at the lack of honor here
---
Level 58 troll here and I just got my swift raptor. Time to level. :D
---
I get your point but sub 60 are able to pull their weight, I did all the dungeons so far and there haven't really been problems. It takes a little more time sure, but personally if I wanted every dungeon to be a speedrun I'd play retail because that's what happened with WotLK dungeons back then
---
Im with you here. Doing scholo/strat/ubrs is just for 60 people. Im not saying it cant be done be a group of lvl 55-57. But why brother inviting lower people. I dont invite people sub 60 when i start my runs 😊
---
phase 3 is the good one. phase 2 is just honor/dire maul.
---
if anything phase 2 may make some people quit who aren't 60 because flight points and what not are going to be f'ing camped by desperate rankers.
---
https://i.imgur.com/qr0jESr.jpg
---
This here? That's a place guards cannot access? That's the upstairs of the inn in BB, right? It just seems that there are no guards but I don't see why they can't access that. It doesn't require jumping.
---
If you still want a addon, lookup (Prat)
---
Does that job plus time stamps
---
No one buys they trinket from my experience sadly 😞
---
Keep pissing more water for your healers. If your group runs like maniacs to next fight then water consumption is over the top. Healer has to tick drink while running and land a big heal and start drinking again before spellbatching registers you to combat (there's 400ms cap between casted heal and getting in combat where you can still start drinking). Each pull can take up to 5 drinks if running with no downtime. It also means that mage has to drink every other pack
---
Eww an unnecessary comment
---
Time to call a GM lol
---
When a Druid casts faerie fire on a mob to pull it you can still hit it and steal their kill, and you get to fight a weaker mob too!
---
Powerword shield is a panic button at most. Save it for when the situation turns sour
---
Its a nice stresstest
---
Takes a Light Feather, and I'm perpetually out of those.
---
So mages don’t need the other classes. Gotcha.
---
As others have said, a tank is generally good for bosses in dungeons.
---
The exception to this for me was this one Druid who joined our ZF run. He held aggro 99% of the time, pulled big packs, grouped them with los, pulled agro from the healer if it ever happened, of course could tank the bosses too, and could do decent damage too.
---
Most tanks seem to be oblivious to the existence of mana and that 4/5 party members will need to drink if we're doing big pulls.
---
The same thing happened to me but in reverse, sort of. I was farming mobs, killed one and had avout 30/40% hp/mana and was about to drink. Suddenly i shift layers the mobs disappear and reappear and a gnome mage sees me standing right behind him and novas kills me as im super low. Great....thanks blizzard.
---
Cool were still getting post about how people should play your way instead of what is enjoyable to them.
---
If I was on a PvP server, it would be a completely different set of circumstances and I'd save BW for PvP situations.  I rolled a PvE server this time, because that's where my RL friends were playing so - now I do not need to save BW for PvP.
---
#BIG DICK DEEPS HAVE ONE SPEED: FULL THROTTLE, MOTHER FUCKER! CHOO, CHOO!
---
Druids don't need friends. They can solo pretty much anything :D
---
I'm in the same boat. Everyone everywhere says "go combat!", but it's no fun. I'm currently running a not so optional ambush + hemo spec and it's so much better. Two-shotting mages is a nice bonus.
---
Thanks for the write up.  This is what I was hoping for.
---
Without seeing how it went down, this mostly sounds like a lack of communication somewhere. This is why its just good practice to relay lvl, class/spec, etc when asking for invite to dungeons or posting in LFG channel (which you might have done, like I said, I cant see the full interaction). The group leader should have given you atleast a courtesy "sorry, we are only interested in lvl 60s" when they realized you weren't 60 and in a timely manner.
---
\+healing and healing done by spells is the exact same stat. Mana per 5 is super important as shaman because they dont have regen in combat talent, so their only casting regen will be mp5.
---
Those are just speculations from people around the web. Time will tell.
---
Funny, I say the same thing to the healer when 4/5 party members drink while the tank charges at whatever moves near him.
---
Red is dead. For every alliance I kill that sets them back from getting to level 60. The more I set back the opposing faction the easier my faction has it when it come to raids and world events. 
---
We are at war. There are no unhounarble kills. Every alliance that exists makes my life more dangerous in Azeroth. If you are on a pvp server expect to get killed in the worst times in the worst ways. This isn't a duel between friends. I am trying to send you to a graveyard so I can steal your mobs and gather proffesions safely. 
---
If you want a safe pvp environment go play on a pve server. A pvp servers purpose is to add another layer to the gameplay where you have to fight to survive and leveling up is dangerous. 
---
It will never be a fair fight. So play smart and fight hard but dont complain because someone ganked you right at the end of an escorts quest or when you were at low health.
---
What add-on are you using for your map? And what did you use to track more than 5 quests at once?
---
i think he means the target of Stitches, the guy that died
---
I’m not saying that sub-60s can’t pull their weight, but when there’s 60s lined up for these dungeons that are objectively stronger than you, you shouldn’t get offended no one wants you. That’s super goofy to think it’s other people’s prerogative to handicap themselves for no reason.
---
Just have anyone in your raid with rez ability to write a quick macro that will activate on rez cast and yell which target is being rezzed
---
Lots of fun whispers :D
---
How much guilds are raiding ragnaros *and* having ingots drop?
---
Anyone Horde side have luck purchasing the Ancona chicken pet from "Plucky" Johnson in Shimmering Flats? From my understanding he should be a vendor but I've seen him in human and chicken form and neither gives me the option to purchase the pet. What am I missing?

monkaS
---
Na. I’ll keep playing how I want until you start paying my subscription.
---
Hes not world first. The world first was 2 days ago.
---
THANK YOU SO MUTCH!
---
Id rather have a good geard 58, rather than shity geard 60, and vice versa.
---
So for me its all about The gear
---
Yes.
---
Hit rogues with a rank 1 fireball as soon as you can. The DoT from that with keep them from being able to vanish.
---
And here I am, with 18 other hunters, camping the the Broken Tooth spawn at level 37...
---
And what makes you an expert? Your response tells anyone in the know you should hold the tongue.
---
I'm pretty sure they improved anti afk script detection. I know someone who had a script that just jumped every 10 seconds and it worked fine for the first week and then after that they would start to get dced while using it
---
watched only first duel.  but few things
---
1st. you are human. your racial spell lets you detect stealth players better. USE IT. 
---
2. Downrank your frostbolt. meaning have rank one frostbolt on castbar, it have lower cast speed. it gives you chance to slow target faster and get some distance. 
---
3.I wouldnt frost nova and blink at same time. you blow 2 dissengage tools at once. in this case after frost nova run away cast pollymorph (its insanly op CC) get to max range of frostbolt and cast it. when he gets close again then blink and cast rank 1 frostbolt just to reslow and by time he is near you your frost nova should be up again.
---
4. Dont backpaddle. (S) streif away. backpaddle have its place and time but very rearly for mage. 
---
5. Keybind your spells so you never have to click them with mouse. Use modifiers (shift+1 shift+2 etc ctrl+1 ctrl+2 etc.) get used to those binding coz later on every milisec will matter.
---
6. If you frost nova him dont run throu him to get to other side. you give him extra few free hits, and he could just as well stun you and destroy you. 
---
just few things
---
I hate you for showing me this.. I ran around the mountain/did hearthstone every time
---
priests cant cure poisions
---
Imagine having a legendary weapon whilst still in valor shoulders, it just doesn't seem right! xD
---
Main reason why I’m not rolling a warrior alt is because I think I’d have an aneurism leveling via dungeons and playing alongside mages that whine about tank threat when it’s not even the tanks job to hold threat right now.

Suppose a few more open up for me with being pvp orientated, though not sure how it works out with a lack of pvp until p2 tbh.

Exceot that you can change servers during queue
---
I do the same on my rogue, but good god, the amount of rogues that refuse to use ANY utility is astounding. I get some of them wanting to be selfish and not swap targets to interrupt because you can lose 4-5 combo points doing that and it blows, but some refuse to even spend less than 20 energy to kick the target they are attacking. 
---
It makes me furious because I am on my Shaman more than I am on my Rogue, so I end up having to Earth Shock interrupt shit they refuse to. Earth Shock is decent damage, but it's also a huge mana drain and restarts my mana regen timer. I already spend so much mana on totems and offhealing, and since it shares cooldowns with other shocks, I lose a lot of dps and utility(slow on fleeing mobs with frost) by having to sit on it in case I need to interrupt. Shit sucks.

I just stopped running tanks altogether and I run double lock, double mage and a healer. Coordinating Torments and Sufferings with big dick AOE lets us blaze through the dungeon at retail speeds with the only downtime being mana breaks.

In regards with blues and purples(not greens), I still hate that people don’t even know what boe is. (Bind on equip).  People should not even look at what the item is or if it’s an upgrade at all.  You should look at it as though it’s a mystery box worth some money.  When you win the item, then look at what it is.  I don’t get why people are being so childish about “if it’s an upgrade so and so should get it and anyone else is a ninja”.  
---
BOE items can be sold. Not vendored or de’ed for a small amount or for a few silver on the ah, actually sold for a potential shitload.  Guess what anyone can buy with money? That’s right, other BOEs.  Why would a very minor upgrade that one person would be dumb to use for a few levels take priority?  It could be multiple upgrades for someone else.  
---
 If a righteous orb drops, everyone will need and not say anything.  I can’t remember what they are worth but let’s say 20g.  Now imagine it’s a one handed sword boe worth 20g.  What changed? Nothing.  You can obtain that weapon from the AH.  Suddenly someone starts crying about it looking cool or having 2 more stats than the piece of garbage they are using because they don’t know how to gear or itemize and that people are ninjas.
---
If a boe drops I always tell everyone to roll need, even if it’s an upgrade for me.  It’s how the items were designed to work.  Half the time the guy who needs it as an upgrade is going to ah it anyway.
---
Yes you have 50% less threat generation compared to defensive stance. Which of course doesn't affect your ability to generate aoe threat since you can always swap into defensive stance for battle shout.
---
How do I do this? New player here
---
You want crit, but you will get so much crit you will crit cap and as such you need hit to prevent that from happening.
---
I think blizzard does say to not share your account for “safety” lol.  Sometimes its character safety
---
I dont see how taking 10 more mins in a dungeon meant to take time is an handicap, but that's me I guess. As I said I do see your point, I just dont agree its a good thing for the community as a whole to think like this

Your grapichs looks so clean, what settings are you using?

---
You’re not entitled to other people’s time. Some people want to be efficient with their time. Just because you were bad or slow or weren’t invited to fast runs back in vanilla doesn’t mean that’s not how others played back then.
---
Funny, I heard the same from a warrior the other day, we waited a good 5 seconds before starting aoe and the warrior lost all aggro to the DPS within 2 seconds.
---
You remember when someone getting an item like this was special ? but with layering nothing is really special anymore. if anyone has anything remotely fancy or is rich. yup, it's layering.
---
Wrong. Worked fine in raids.
---
I love having a pocket mage, love it when there's a mage next to me watching me and ensuring that mobs stay away. Had an amazing one in sm yesterday who even gave me a +8 intellect necklace that was in a chest he won. :o
---
Those guys deserve a lot of respect, gotta love team players.
---
Doesn't really explain why you rushed it. Just thag you've played a lot?
---
No one got banned.
---
The guards behaved the same way in Vanilla too.
---
if they had fixed it, you'd probably be reeeing about no changes instead.
---
They can't win.
---
If your Agony isn't going to last at least half its duration, you're just wasting resources and time. Personally I just put a corruption on the main target and leave it at that. Then either cycle through dotting other targets, or nuking the main target should it be a priority.
---
Any good enhancement shaman weapon between 45-60? Im 46 with ravager on my back, it's still doing it's work but I feel it getting tired.
---
This is pretty much unrelated to classic wow
---
So Still no update ?
---
"epic" conclusion to the war campaign. 
---
Riggght
---
I agree that for a newer or a more casual player, being ganked and even camped by a high level is infuriating and discouraging. It's completely out of your control and you can't do anything except log out, which is just stupid. You shouldn't be forced to stop playing because another player decided to be a dick.
---
BUT ... this kind of behavior is what drives world pvp. Get ganked enough times and be persistent enough and you'll eventually find solutions. There are plenty high levels of your own faction who want to help you. There might be players of your level who've suffered the same and gang up to kill the ganker. You can log off and play an alt for a little while. You can start carrying potions of speed, underwater breathing, swim speed, and invisibility on you at all times and learn how to outplay gankers. In most cases, you can suck it up and just eat res sickness if you really want to keep playing on that character. Most gankers don't care to team up so they can both camp your corpse and the graveyard at the same time. And most importantly, you eventually learn to control your emotions and manage your expectations. Getting killed in unfair fights is a common event on PvP servers, and getting camped isn't surprising at all, either. You end up working around it, and feeling better for it, because you managed to do something more than just smash your keyboard, yell at your screen, and write up a report ticket.
---
That's my opinion. I've been playing WoW since I was 11, and I have suffered countless ganks and a few corpse camps, and oh boy did I rage about it. Back then, I would've stood on Blizzard's side. Ban all the corpse campers and terrain exploiters, they hurt my innocent newbie experience. But now that I actually see the bigger picture, all the options that are there for you to learn about and use, and most importantly the social interactions and feeling of community that it inspires, provided you're not a potato at social skills (and I know, most gamers are, as am I sometimes), I actually say let the players handle it. There are PvE servers for those who really can't handle it. Blizz babysitting players has caused debatable changes to WoW, like RDF, which arguably deteriorated many of WoW's enjoyable aspects. I would've enjoyed if they avoided doing it for Classic.
---
You know it's good when you can hear the picture in your head and know exactly what this whole situation sounds like.
---
His gankers could at least give him the courtesy:

---
So easy to switch out before they land it tho... Unless they sneak up on you and surprise u I guess
---
Yep. I have a guy on my friend's list whose way of leveling is farming mats. He then spends hours upon hours on the AH, undercutting, checking prices, crafting, finding people to craft for him (that's how I met him, I made 90 Silk Bags for the dude). Just no time at all to actually play the game.
---
Rude if they never put the level requirement in their LFG post.
---
People still play retail?
---
Lol get over yourself
---
Man this really makes me feel bad, here I am level 40 and some dude already exploited the game to hell where he can just have the ultimate in game weapon... like, there's nothing to look forward to.
---
Dude you start off your video with some earrape intro, and ganking an afk dude. This is unironicly very cringy
---
You're a dick but you're owning that. What you aren't is an exploiter and this ban is unwarranted.
---
Lazy ass was laying in bed while his wife toiled out in the fields, he deserved it. I left his wife alive.
---
Removed as a begging post *and* as a repost.
---
I'd recommend people use something like NeatPlates for threat. A threatmeter can be a more detailed tool, but requires you to check it and is better for things like bosses where you have a long time to look over to the side. NeatPlates colorizes individual mob nameplates Yellow if you are getting close to the leader's threat, and Red if you have threat on a mob. Good for tanks, dps and healers alike to let you know where you stand with each mob.
---
No I pvp. U no like pvp? I pvp anyway. :)
---
Because im camping a rare spawn which has a several hour timer
---
This should be extended to all classes. Ask yourself -&gt; what is the dumbest thing my party might do, and how will I deal with it?
---
If your answer is: "the same thing I always do, then blame whoever caused the problem," you are a bad player.
---
Definitely would be nice to take an inverse approach, making all pets useful and interesting instead of nerfing Humar and Broken Tooth and Rake.
---
Yeah, it has definitely always been an issue. The night elf female shoulder thing just really stands out to me, which is a shame because I think the rest of their model and animations are pretty great.
---
He also could have just layered

I have the Disgusting Oozeling and I have no green color WTF, submitted bug report have no clue if it's just on my screen but my friend also said I looked the same.  Grrrr

Your line work is a lot better! Your curved lines have improved.

That dude must be feeling so awesome right now.

Oh they were. They were attacking everyone they could.

Thanks

It’s not that I don’t get it, I just want to have a rogue experience, not a generic fury warrior

He means no zone where you should be able to be safe from gankers
---
does anyone else find that mobs respawn waaay too quickly at off-peak times? it's caused me to die numerous times when there are packs of 3 because the other packs just keep respawning
---
Add 2 spaces at the end of line (immediately after Bestial Wrath) and /petattack should be put on the following line.
---
Beat me to it
---
WSG is kinda like soccer 🤔
---
Cater to me? Its like you're saying im getting boosted which is stupid to say, entitlement doesnt come from saying this level thing is a nonsense prejudice to have in a community, it comes from pretending to only have 60 for dungeons that are 56+ even
---
Thank you so much for these! I can't wait to see more!
---
&gt;Warrior with Hand of Rag
---
But...why? Give it to a Shaman, there are like 3 better weapons for him.
---
That's risky too. There are times when using a shield on the tank is a good idea. Waiting for the curse to wear off in SM GY for example when the mages don't decurse
---
I didn’t. Nothing he did fit the report categories.
---
How did u do that
---
Only half? Like 90% of the forsaken just want to murder everyone
---
The remaining 10% want to turn everyone into forsaken
---
Look, I used Prat and shif+click on name of the person, who whisper to invite him to the group. Now I need to invite, see that his lvl or class doesn't fit and explain, why I will kick him from the party.
---
I always run one just to prevent myself from slacking when I'm grouped. Adds a little bit of internal competition that helps me stay on my A-game.
---
Gratz on the weapon but why would you give it to a warrior i dont understand that
---
Isnt that bad? Whirlwind is as much threat in berserker stance as the DPS your DPS will be doing, without the added threat from threat gaining abilities aswell as defensive stance, whirlwind's 400 initial damage is the same as a tick from hellfire, right?
---
Definitely how I intuitively understood it in 2004. Their system makes sense, but isn't intuitive.
---
Its pretty bad lol, dont use that.
---
Some of it is so sad/hilarious at the same time. Like yesterday; I'm leveling my alt, at 23 shaman in hillsbrad. Some little dink gnome mage (a skull level) to me, and his clearly being carried mage buddy (level 21). Anyway they run by me killing mobs near the road and the dink gnome thinks it hilarious to just freeze me over and over and not actually kill me. That is, until a hero in the form of a lvl 60 undead Warlock comes by and just dunks on them both. I say thanks to my new personal hero, they say your welcome and that if they do it again in the next while whisper and they will come help; this warlock said she would be in the area for the next while farming prof mats. I said thanks again. 
---
About 25 minutes later guess who I see gunning for me from as far away as the game will render...those two dinks again. The gnome mage goes about his antics again and freezes me without constraint and finally kills me. I'm just laughing because they were so petty as to be pissed they got destroyed for being dinks. I get to my dead body and Rez....they are camping me, and kill me again. Now I'm like fuck man....but then I remember that warlock, my hero....lol. I msg them and a few minutes later and a couple more death from me, the warlock rolls up and just DESTROYS them in such a good way. I never see that mage again lol.
---
Yea... that’s when I knew it wasn’t an accident anymore.
---
They don't, that's why they are the fastest to level with. But you usually still have a tank to group up the mobs, although a warlock would be even better.
---
All if them have it drop? Amazing at ~35% dropchance!
---
Good art, but this truly is low effort. God damn, I said GOD DAMN!
---
Some gear say “increase the effect of MAGICAL spells by x” whilst others just say “increase the effect of spells by x”. What’s the difference? I’m a warlock, what gear should I be looking for? Obviously anything with shadow damage
---
You don’t want to be the guy getting out dpsed by a healer
---
I remember that Japanese farmers would purposely de-level themselves in order to stay in certain level ranges due to the drops.  Farming parties were also common, where you would join a party and go afk.  You would give up a cut of your earned Adena to stay in the party.
---
Serious question:  would your prefer L2's xp mechanics, or City of Heroes, where you wouldn't lose xp, but accumulate debt (which is an exp bar that stacks on top of your normal exp bar which you have to work off if you die)?
---
Just more AoE, threat rather than St, I imagine WW hits harder than a tick or two of hell fire at least.
---
why wouldnt you just go 30-0-21 instead tho
---
20k G... Damn.
---
&gt; Since Classic was announced, there was a very idiotic mantra circulating on the forums : "Players today are much more informed and much better at the game".
---
They are though. **Or rather, the ones who have actually been playing for 14 years are.**
---
I know I'm a ridiculously better player than I was 14 years ago, at least. Shit, I'd better be, else what have I been doing all this time?
---
However, there are a ton of people who have come back to the game after not playing for 10~ years, and they're just as bad as they were then.
---
Druid. Every position. Azeroth cup champions. Next question
---
Not to mention earthshock is high threat
---
As far as I am aware it is, but once geared properly
---
So brave.
---
Yeah, good luck with that against any hunter worth his salt.
---
I mean, are yall seriously debating the fact that hunter is a mage's worst matchup? Have you ever seriously pvp'ed in Classic/Vanilla?
---
I know the worgen in Duskwood can respawn immediately sometimes, it could be only 1 respawning immediately or could be 4-5. Pretty good to farm once you get used to it.
---
seriously now... Who cares????
---
Neither is all kinds of things that are in the game right now. But you're right, adding a few guards to a few cities, THAT would forever alter the game.
---
To measure your performance and test what abilities and combos do more damage. There is no reason not to use them.
---
With 1 shaman in your defence for an earthbind totem
---
So how about the changes already in the game lol
---
Just dump bs
---
I guess if I run in with a 2hand. WW then swap to sword/board?
---
Not a true MMO player unless you play with the damage meter in the center of your screen
---
Agree with everything ..... dps needs to focus target of tank...
---
I have a macro that sets skull icon to whichever mob I am sundering and usually that’s enough for them to attack whatever I am
---
I use a Threat Meter to know when my dps is getting out of control and slow down for tank to catch up
---
Almost 38 myself!
---
Youu fail to realize that everyone tries to use the terrain to their advantage is most situations, and suddenly it's wrong because it happens in cities? That's bullshit. 
---
If Blizzard do not want people to do that they need to fix it through adding more guards or something, and punishing people for doing something as basic as using the terrain to their advantage is pure nonsense. 
---
I'll also add that this is coming from someone who straight out hate ganking.
---
I mean, what's next? Banning people who Mindcontrol people on the BB to Ratchet ship? That shit is obviously not intended and super unfun for the victims! 
---
Or people bringing world bosses to cities? I mean, that's basically the same as PvP corpse camping as you're wiping out entire cities!
---
This is nonsense. People wanted classic, this is part of classic.
---
His name is asmonsnippets after all.
---
You assume I only have one. *Heh. Pathetic.*
---
I don't think you understand what the feature does otherwise I have absolutely zero idea what relevance to Classic this has.
---
Indeed, I find it hard to believe.
---
More information is better than less information.  That's basically the reason for 99% of addons
---
Lol this is like on the private servers XD
---
Break who to not find out the faction or server population
---
The title was added in Burning Crusade, and no not everyone can get the mount. Only people who ring the gong within the first 10 hours of the first gong can get the mount
---
I agree. IMO it shouldn't be punished at all, frankly. However, if they have such a big issue with it, they could solve it permanently in a much easier way than this constant back and forth.
---
Why do you want Engi anyway? Are you gonna be PvPing a lot?
---
But how does this help the pala or druid? :D
---
So is there any fun and active guild on Mirage Raceway (EU) horde side that i can join?
---
Maybe so. But fourteen year old me in 2004 was clever enough to interpret their rules on exploits. That if something was clearly unintended it wasn’t license to do it cause “it was coded into their shitty game!!11!” Not sure what that says about all the people finding this rule so “confusing” aside that they’re probably full of shit and just want to keep doing it.
---
For context, this is the result of a bug involving Robes of Insight and shapeshifting. It permanently spikes up the mana cost of all abilities and adds an upkeep cost until logging out and back in.
---
I agree but the problem is ROI
---
Yes the damage looks fine at face value but not in terms of DPS and downtime due to mana and lack of cc and survivability.
---
Try Feralas. The quests are rather uninteresting but there are enough NPCs for everyone and I only had to clean up the area from alliance players once to get the spawns I needed.
---
Hey what up, Madaeason here!
---
ok
---
Who is taking about anything related to boosting?
---
If you feel a group of random strangers should have to change the way they run dungeons, and how to spend their free/hobby time in general, in order to accommodate a lower level player then yes that would be catering.  You are not entitled to any of that.  Get 60, run a lower level instance, run with your guild who will likely be more willing to work with your sub 60 level, or tell the group leader in the beginning that you’re not 60.
---
I will say this once more with emphasis, maybe caps will help:  YOU DO NOT GET TO DICTATE HOW PEOPLE SPEND THEIR TIME, **ESPECIALLY STRANGERS**.
---
I hit 60 with just over 7 days played after rerolling from a level 30 on Skeram. I only did each dungeon once for the quests up until the 50's where a few failed BRD pug's slowed me down. If 'legit' 60's are only just dinging they're fucking garbage, I work 60+ hours weekly lol
---
People play how they want, and there are some who want to rush to max level to get an early edge.  If you're 60 right now, you've got a massive gold-making advantage for probably the next couple weeks or a month.  If I was 60 right now, I'd be spending most of my time farming thorium or high level herbs.  By November, there will be 10 times more max level characters and 10 times more competition for resources.  
---
Just because you enjoy taking your time leveling (I do too by the way) doesn't mean that the way anyone else does it is "wrong".  It also doesn't mean that they missed the content that they smashed through, they might be leveling alts to experience the content in a more privelidged way - with a rich main character who can shower them with gear.
---
You're one of the reasons this community is shit stm..
---
&gt; privelidged
---
Check your privilege.
---
^^^BEEP ^^^BOOP ^^^I'm ^^^a ^^^bot. ^^^PM ^^^me ^^^to ^^^contact ^^^my ^^^author.
---
Kinda fun since my biggest interests are wow and football.
---
Going with a 442.
---
Rogue, Mage up front.
---
Hunter and Lock LM and RM with Druid and Shaman in the middle.
---
Warrior and Paladin being central defenders. Put 2 priests as fullbacks.
---
I was rank 11 in vanilla, hunters weren’t a problem.
---
They prefer the endgame content and don’t enjoy levelling as much. Alternatively maybe they love speed levelling and trying to beat their previous paths and see levelling as a puzzle. 
---
On top of that now they get to complete raids, grind rep, gain gold and get their character in the best position for phase two.
---
Woah dude that's like an incredibly toxic thing to say.
---
Good luck finding a tank or healer that agrees to that.
---
Alot of people are recommending questie. 
---
I'm playing with no addons at all myself. 
---
I want blizzard to keep classic classic, but grab that addon if one feature missing is really bothering you.
---
A Classic Wow must!  Tank threat vs dps ratios are way different In classic. Threat meters are more important than dps meters while running dungeons imo. (Yes I use both)
---
I just wanna talk about how the horde has a Primal forest troll amongst its ranks (who’s one of the only prominent female trolls) but she’s never used seriously. Primals are badass!
---
The timing isn’t set in stone yet they’ll see how it goes and roll out accordingly is what I’ve heard
---
Not only that but have enough liquid gold to buy out markets all week to make money back at the end of the week.
---
No you said you don’t need us. Mages are officially dead to me.
---
They have been since most of them are always “invite to layer” and the such. So go be fast with all your layer jumping budies.
---
Some of its features can sometimes be useful. Like seeing if a player is actually doing anything, what people are attacking, how often someone died or simply a thread meter (if everyone has the same damage meter).
---
Probably because most mobs share a spawn and people only killing quest mobs. If you want to quest you should also kill other mobs to have them respawn
---
Hao still good enough to play pro Dota 😥
---
You are free to go sit by the vendor and wait for respawns. But if you want that pattern and want it now, there will be a convenience cost associated with it.
---
I leveled my Hunter with a friend that ran a priest back in vanilla. It was a great experience for him as he learned to  heal on my pet while it tanked. Seems trivial but the lessons of managing agro, not over healing, go a long way.
---
I changed the shadow knowing they would take me.. Which they decided not to. The Guilds that I joined after that also had the same process. Say I'm Shadow - GInvite - Ask me to change to Holy - No - No raid spot unless Holy - Leave Guild
---
Probably an add on causing that noise
---
Dump threat, thunderclap is for big pulls so that you can still berserk rage without your healer having a heart attack.
---
No one is taking anything personal, you’re just acting like such an entitled asshat that we’re able to point it out as easily as calling water is wet.
---
Also, nothing like that happens to normal, decent players because we don’t treat strangers like they owe us anything.  Also, we’ll get great loot because we contribute and don’t slow other players down.
---
I'm a Tauren, and I find this /moo
---
You need to work on your reading comprehension.
---
What addon is that screen frame that tells durability and stuff? I’ve seen others with it and I’m intrigued.
---
I agree with everything you said, you are right and the Classic is inferior to the Private Server I was playing on.
---
Everything loses it’s legendary value if you can simply abuse the system. World First Hand of Ragnaros... so what? It means nothing with the system that Blizzard decided to roll with.
---
Press k
---
Delete this
---
Yeah, just thought it was funny. Sounds like an old game sound bite.
---
Your words not mine
---
These are honestly beautiful keep up the fantastic work
---
Except none of us have auto loot on.
---
Now this is immersion
---
The amount of alliance asses I've saved so far I may as well have rolled a night elf.
---
No need to be aggressive until honour is available.
---
Yeah I would say it is. 
---
I haven't found a good bow ever so far in classic. I have the red longbow that drops in SM Lib (bought it in ah at like lvl 29). By a good bow, I mean one with stats. 
---
Weapon upgrades are important enough I think that if you're having trouble finding one in the world just go buy one and get it over with
---
Lmao who has been right about any of the predictions in classic? Surely not ‘you think you do but you don’t, we’re only going to need 2 eu pvp servers, only 100k will sub blizzard-activision. A retarded weather man is right more than blizzard and the classic is going to fail crowd.
---
Nope, didn't say that, read again.
---
I think this is considered botting. Gz for the ingenuity anyway.
---
Yeah they should, but its happened more than once, I always whisper back to add its 60 only but they just put you on ignore and move on
---
Yeah I can see that. Especially from a perspective of back then I assume the depth of raiding was more than enough since the game was new and everyone was figuring it out.
---
One thing I was thinking about was finding a raiding group that would do it semi-blind. I haven't done any vanilla raids yet, I've only raided in tbc as mage. But finding 50 people who would be up for that seems really difficult.
---
Except none of us are using it...or have auto loot on for that matter.
---
The accumulated filth of their AOE’s and DOT’s can be nothing other than the corpses of those slain by said AOE’s and DOT’s.
---
Perhaps they need help looting? Luckily, it doesn’t take rage to loot.
---
I’m not gonna go out of my way to pvp if I’m busy questing. Obviously if alliance are causing problems allowing people to quest or if they’re ganking then sign me up. But if you’re going around starting fights you can’t finish and need my help then the answers no. I’m questing.
---
no but alot more then 9 raids aswell
---
So I’m assuming you’re using a guide instead which is the same thing but without an add on?
---
The man has some grade A MMO to play. No time for forums. Enjoy classic with the other 6 million of us!
---
Don't think too much about it, Player! Everything is fine. ^(Not ^sponsored ^by ^Blizzard)
---
They smell....but fair enough they're OK personality wise.
---
Oh, finally that Worgen rework.
---
You clearly conflated the character and the player to be a single entity.
---
I use Earth Shock... as the healer to pull the mob that resists Frost Nova back into the Blizzard.
---
Drag the boss back into the first room and even to the room before that , more time before adds get to you then , did it with all lvl 41s and a 43 tank
---
Filthy casuals
---
So stupid.
---
Your asking for a complete overhaul of how npc pathfinding works for the entirety of the game.  You can restrain yourself from doing things against the rules, we do it every day in real life.
---
I'm new. Explain to me?
---
I also find it crass, u/Spicy_McJojo
---
Hakuna matata hakuna matata...
---
IT MEANS NO WORRIEZ
---
No need to play dumb also. Everyone knows what that dude meant.
---
There is an engineering shield. Good for AoE tanking. 
---
There is no shield from MC requering engineering. 
---
For tanks, it comes down to the shield, great stuff before BWL and slapper charges and dynamite etc for extra damage and thus extra threat which equals more DPS. 
---
It’s more of a min/max thing. Slightly more valuable to the horde, since they dont have paladins and -15% threat, which means the tanks must produce 15% more threat if you want to raise the DPS cap. 
---
The more threatgear (progression for healers and the tank) that you Can fit in, the less important Engineering becomes before Naxx.
---
Theres a big difference between refusing to kick, and "I didn't pool energy and didn't expect the cast, so now I missed the kick"
---
I'm always ready to interrupt, but energy's tight and miss it more often than I'd like
---
You can take the same name after forced renames. Guilds have been known to troll people they don't like by mass reporting someone's name and then immediately having people steal it when they notice the person goes offline. 
---
People with offensive names, however, who retake the same name, will often times catch bans for taking the same name.
---
People with non offensive names who are being trolled with mass reporting can contact Blizzard (if they manage to get their name back and trolls don't get it) can get their names placed on an exempt list.  This was a big deal on Emerald Dream a couple of years ago when guilds were mass reporting each other like crazy solely to be toxic to each other. Hundreds of people were having their names stolen after mass reports.
---
I see early frost nova and cone of cold aoe bursts in my nightmears,
---
They really drill you into saving up half of your Rage par from previous fight
---
Yeah that doesn't really help since Bite 8 and Growl 4 are supposed to be learned through taming the right pet.
---
Is there a guide to rogue pickpocket that would guide for the best places to pickpocket by lv sort of thing?
---
As a Horde*
---
Bonus points if it's not Undead
---
Killed the Boss yesterday with a group between 41-43 we pulled the Boss upstairs it al went pretty smooth even with a suboptimal team comp. Just make sure the healer doesn't go oom
---
Wasting GM time with frivolous tickets, just like the good 'ol days
---
“Exploit” is entirely subjective. 
---
Yea I’m pissed about it. It’s part of the game. 
---
People do it to me and it pisses me off but they shouldn’t get banned for it.
---
If guards cant get to you.  It's kind of simple actually.
---
Make a /attack macro to have this beautiful bastard on your bars at all times.
---
Did a library run the other day and the tank told me to turn off growl. I obliged, obviously. But when it turned out that the tank couldn't hold agro I just turned it back on and had my gorilla tank.
---
As always, make sure the hunter knows. They disable growl in instances, and without it the pet will not hold aggro. 
---
The key is to keep things consistent, never do unexpected things before discussing it.
---
Gaming solutions: yeet the cat
---
Why in the fuck do so many pea-brained idiots without a ounce of originality name their shaman something with “Sham” in it?  
---
This mong is the worst example.
---
The worst thing about vanilla is the stealth speed!!!!
---
😘
---
You're severely misunderstanding what I'm saying, but I'm not surprised you're unable to comprehend it considering the way you're speaking.
---
Anyhow, what I am saying is that I personally wouldn't want anything changed, but if Blizzard insists on this being against the rules they should prevent it instead of punishing players. I also literally wrote "add more guards" and not "block the terrain", you dumb cattle.
---
Circumventing guards is way too easy and because of that it's pure nonsense to punish players for it.
---
If it had a DoT attached and looked like the mob caught fire, it was Immolate. If it just looked like a little explosion of fire, it was Searing Pain, which causes an ass ton of threat.
---
Also, that was stupid of him.
---
If a mob doesn't drop anything, you should still get the loot popup, it's just empty.  Because then you can skin it too...in this case, you cannot.
---
We sort of think it's a big when you have ffa loot on, and some of you need quest items (like zebra hooves) while others don't, and one that doesn't need them any more loots first.  We think.
---
also do #showtooltip Attack will make this icon show for your macro.
---
I can’t understand why this is hard for you to grasp:
---
Who the fuck decides what’s fine and what’s not fine?
---
PvP is PvP. That’s it.
---
The lack of curves is partially due to the fact that I don't bother with a pencil layer and partially due to the [graphics settings I play on](https://imgur.com/OTSUXWL)
---
I am actually getting a little tired of healing through giant AOE pulls. Especially the messy ones.
---
Also, it's everyone's job to make sure the healer is pristine. Seriously if you see someone attacking your healer and the tank is otherwise occupied get on that shit.
---
That’s wrong though
---
Phasing and scaling is classic? That's about as modern as it gets
---
Exploiting to world first sulfuras would probably lead to a ban
---
How many hours per day man? Just making conversation :))
---
I’m speaking purely from the characters POV, I’m sure its frustrating standing there watching your allies scramble and fall in battle with no way to help them
---
#alliance

Hahahahahaha ok this is hilarious
---
I use to this for hours 6-7 days a week. I got 1 pm from a gm over the years.
---
Mages will die a couple of times and will learn to rather blizzard kite or not do that
---
Try to keep the priest not dead
---
Why are you using Berserker Rage every pull? You don't need to do that. The extra rage gain from it is negligible in dungeons.
---
Traitor
---
Was this common on private servers?
---
I mean the influx of legendarys are way way fishy. Even if we have all the information avalaible , its way too soon man..
---
If the skulls wrong still follow it then let the tank know after, dont just do what you thinks right and let the tank stress over a shitty pull because you know better
---
Youre wrong. It is allowed. What isnt allowed is using it to avoid guards during pvp. You can get up ontop of buildings all day.
---
tbh, i just need on everything and let the weapon trainer sort it out
---
"Because it's there" - George Mallory
---
you fucking WHAT AND I RAN THE LONG WAY THIS ENTIRE TIME
---
seriously thanks so much for this
---
Big pull tanks who don’t know how to hold group agro are the worst.
---
Yeah the title should be you made 32 gold playing the AH. Your level is irrelevant if you just sent over gold from a main for starting capital.
---
That makes sense. The cycle of life.
---
Yes its very worth it
---
That is a lie. Did you even play on private servers or are you just shilling for a company that doesn't care about you?
---
Yeah, phasing was introduced in wrath.

Did a SM Graveyard run yesterday and noticed that I wasn’t never given the option to pick up any mob drops while we were running it. 
---
Loot was set to group loot and my party was able to loot. 
---
Am I missing something?
---
Wrong again
---
Concur
---
Yea if wars are tanking leveling dungeons with 2h weapons i dont think shaman tanks are a problem.
---
And this is a bit similar to rift, so hopefully it won't be too bad.
---
I get more joy out of someone reaching level 60 for the first time than this.
---
I see this stuff and think I never got another races mount in actual vanilla. 
---
What was I even doing
---
You should still spec 31/5/15 daggers for PvP
---
I could never, ever play one. They are so forced and shoehorned into the game that I wish they were never added.
---
Wool has a narrower level range that drops it compared to other cloth.  
---
Plus Horde generally encounters fewer humanoids than the Alliance at those levels while leveling so it’s more rare on that side.
---
You are all disgraces to your factions
---
What a turd....
---
Maybe you shouldn’t play undead and you wouldn’t get camped by superior players
---
If melee and you're lucky it can be but really 5% attack speed for 5 mins isnt THAT big a deal as its only party wide.
---
Well that sucks... I essentially bought this game to own the roof of the inn in Tarrens Mill. The guards were not much a deterrent. “Abusing” roof mechanics in Wow was more about confusing the max level players who were trying to kill you.
---
Carrying a flag back to your sides building is like soccer?
---
party sync is anti-phasing, therefore it's pro-classic... .i think...
---
This wasn't wasting resources. I get it's their decision to break the functionality but this is pure ignorance and doesn't effect the servers load .00001%.
---
Damn I can't wait to get my own reddit post one day
---
Yea I agree, it's certainly a design flaw of the encounter. There's plenty of fights with similar design flaws, for example the taure infront of the ship in deadmines that can be kited back and when he grabs his weapons then you have all the time in the world to heal up etc.

Basically energy conservation

# PRINTSCREEN MOTHERFUCKER, DO YOU USE IT?
---
^((well, no, apparently. idiot))

people probably just arent buying it, no one needs it or is using it atm at 60
---
What dungeons? I wouldn't want to go strat or scholo with 58. The enemies there are up to 63 if I remember correctly.
---
Guards would not have been a deterrent.
---
This
---
Well obviously there is no casual guild raising right now bc the people that will accept a spriest aren’t 60 yet 
---
The thing about playing with a shadow is that there’s always someone else willing to replace you who deals more dmg than you
---
It's a bit rough until 40 but glad you switched (speaking as a 38 ele shaman since level 1); leveling pre-40 you still want to take advantage of the spirit mana Regen, so you tend to frontload spells and then melee finish the mobs so your spirit kicks in. I tend to do 1-3 bolts, shock, melee. Chain lightning on clearcast is good but most of the time 1) you're already casting your next regular bolt or 2) the mob is already meleeing you (might still be worth firing it off, or can just clearcast a shock). Apparently after 40 the advice changes a bit to basically "burst them down with spells as fast as you can, then regen between mobs", since you'll have much faster bolt speeds and the 31-point talent.
---
Level 57 Holy priest. Its a long fight and you just gotta take your time. That includes the dps, its the dps job to take control of the random mobs spawning and to help clear the pack of dwarves that spawn when he gets 50%. The boss doesnt hit hard so as long as you just keep the tank sustained its easy for the healer.  The important thing is the dps need to be saving mana for the last part of the fight when he gets to 20-25%. As the golems are hard hitters(they despawn after he dies so focus the boss at that point), if everyone was level 43 in the party its defently doable. This generally is how its done or you can cheese him and bring him out into the hall. But the golemns wont despawn after he dies.
---
Make a macro to /pickpocket before any opener and set your loot to auto loot. Generally, if the monster is wheedling pants then you can pick pocket it
---
 Then never think about it again
---
Can i turn off everything but the exclamation marks on the minimap?
---
You probably shouldn't use that, unless fighting some super heavy hitting enemy, the ability serves only one purpose 10% attack speed reduction,Ewen demo shout gives more threat and after the demo agro correction batleshout is and will be best aoe agro ability (it generates threat per every person you buff), better avoid thunderstorms in general,
---
You didn’t include the class modifier, so since that guy has Druid in his name he was included
---
One has to be optistic.
---
LOL? Im not racist wtf you talking idiot?
---
Still not a world first
---
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
---
Man this sub is pathetic.
---
Back in vanilla I had yo train one of tge red/brown worgs for those skills.
---
Warrior charges in, charge gives you one sunder, dps aoe instantly, no mons hitting you, no rage generated everyone goes oom and you have to wait for everyone to eat and drink
---
Buddys, come the 50's for real dungeons, we will be the kings. It is hard now, but we warriors must persevere.
---
Raids are free kill you won't have any problem
---
How is not saying you take only 60 and giving me a reason to kick before or after you do it related to accomodating me? You want to justify people being rude. Also sorry but I dont really want to keep replying to your every post under mines, you're getting so riled up for nothing and I don't want to fuel more of your rage
---
When there are 10 other people like you camping the pattern it gets abit difficult I understand it makes money but it's just a shitty way to do it
---
Maybe your mother shouldnt be such a whore and she wouldnt get gangbanged by 10 bbc all night long fucking bitch.
---
So you just don’t want the ability to kick spells or block to save your own life from shitty pug heals? I stay mostly in battle with a 2h, but when you switch defensive it’s nice to be able to take a bit more damage

[Character Name] speaks in tongues.
---
I mean, the more INT the less dumb
---
I’m not the one crying on a subreddit because I’m getting clapped in game
---
Nah, mate. That's the DPS you let die first. I'm not usually the type of healer to act like that, but that guy is asking for it. Give him an ultimatum, next time he pulls aggro he gets no heals..
---
You can report but it won’t solve the fact that you are on a pvp sever.
---
Happened with Lbrs, brd, strath ls so far more than once
---
Fun to see your DPS get better
---
Human rogue here, I was doing the Khan hratha quest earlier, and asked general chat for help since I was struggling to kill all the adds and the elite himself, I got memed hard, no one wanted to help and some people just laughed at me. Then saw a random level 37 horde priest, totally underdeveled to kill lvl 49 elite Khan hratha. I waved at him, probably scared him a bit since I was 46. But I just waved/beckoned/licked until he followed me up the ramp. Did some more emotes to make sure he was at least close to the same page, then I triggered the quest by blowing the horn. Priest definitely got the message then, that I wanted help with a quest. He ended up staying to help, he couldn't heal me, but he could mitigate the damage by taking some himself, it was tough but we eventually beat it. I spammed thank yous and ran off. 
---
For the horde.
---
It's possible you tamed one earlier in the instance. There's different Worgs in LBRS, the correct ones to tame are deeper into the instance (past Omokk, near Halycon)
---
Undead also have probably the best pvp racial hence it attracting pvp minded players.
---
How do you deal with packs with more than 2 mobs and patrols?
---
I hit 60 last night solo-leveling my priest, I feel/share your joy!
---
Named Bloodaxe Worg I believe
---
Berserker rage doesn’t have a downside, you’re thinking bloodrage.
---
I understand the zombie mode man, just keep on tanking, we’re not the heroes Azeroth deserves, but we’re the ones it needs right now.
---
okay well I can't change the title now, but I turned 1 gold into 32 gold in the Auction house. 
---
Just wanted to share it with the community but didn't realise it was so uptight
---
Maybe you only need a pet that has the potential to get a high rank but you still need to train it?
---
It's really only a dick move if you already spent a long time heading to the dungeon, but if they invite and kick you immediately for being sub-60, it's just that they want an efficient run. Sometimes the difference between 59 and 60 can be huge.
---
That's even more mind blowing that you can't grasp.
---
Blizzard decides what's fine or not. Avoiding guards is explicitly stated to not be fine.
---
Ahh, yes! Just accept everything and continue consuming trash mindlessly. Don't complain!
---
Hope to have a similar experience today. Finally have every ST quest!
---
40+ do Cath and RFD. Timbermaw hold is great late 50s before you become friendly. I'm hoping to try brd after I hit 60 tomorrow.
---
AND I JUST WALKED BACK AND SPAWNED. SURPRISE THIS FUCKING WHORE STILL THERE CAMPING ME. IM DEAD AGAIN. FUCKING WHORE I PROMISE I FIND YOUR IP AND I WILL COME AND KILL YOU IRL SO HARD F UCKING WORTHLESS SLUT! I FUCKING RAPE YOU 10H TILL YOU DIE FUCKING ASSHOLE WHORE SLUT
---
I have a distinct memory of doing a lowbie run of RFC back in the day with a Warlock’s Voidwalker tanking.
---
And then they sell the bags for basically cost price on the AH. It's fucking bizarre how stupid they are.
---
I’m trying to find an addon that does what outfitter used to do (save item sets then let me instantly equip them).  Any suggestions?
---
Can’t they be affected by specific spell damage? Like I know some spriests have said shadow wands are best since they have a debuff that increases shadow damage taken. I’m not sure this is just something I’ve heard that needs clarification
---
When someone has to tell you that the stuff they are selling is epic you know its not
---
Someone just said Deftones?
---
I just yesterday finished all hinterland quests (I just realized it's called hinterland in English too haha always assumed it was due to German localisation pretty funny to see a German name here) an it drove me nuts that this quest was the only one which wouldn't show op as 'finished'
---
You can always max out blacksmithing, then farm enough ore to get your engineering up, and drop mining for engineering. Then if you really want, you can pick up mining on an alt, or alternatively just make a farming alt or farm on your main to buy materials you need.
---
"What makes a man turn neutral? Lust for gold? Power? Or were you just born with a heart full of neutrality?"
---
Sure, escape artist is good, but you could also FAP or LAP instead. 
---
Orc warriors make best dps warriors. Nice active, +5 axe mastery, stun resistance. Also 8 more strength and 3 more stamina than gnomes, which is a pretty big deal. Gnomes have more... Intellect? Yeah they make great mages, but being a warrior gnome just for escape artist is not worth it.
---
Ty for that explanation!
---
Sometimes it's better to just take the high road and just wish them gl even if they were rude and it ticks you off. It is just a game in the end, there are plenty of players out there to group up with and you're be better off running those dungeons with players who are like minded then those who clearly view the game differently than you.
---
But you the one whos mother takes 10bbc in asshole all night. Every fucking night. Bigest son of whore in world.
---
Probably keeps a pet bear named “Druid”
---
I’m a level 55 mage and up to this point I’ve been focusing on gear with int&gt;spirit&gt;spell power. I’ve been reading that spell power is better later so should I focus on that more now? I recently learned the bis for mages for phase one is a sword and I haven’t used a sword at all. What’s the fastest way to level that up on low lvl mobs or do I have to be able to get xp from them?
---
Always find there is a big spike in damage taken whilst popping it in beserker stance, probably need to get quicker at using it!
---
The sad thing is that, due to the debuff limit, shadow priest is just not usable in raids as a DPS. They are more of a support class. They lack a good damage move to use that doesn't waste a debuff slot.
---
As a one-of support/utility class to stack Shadow Weaving they are fine, but you can't really bring more than one shadow priest per raid.
---
If in heavy aoe group that actually managed to kill everything, chill out focus on gathering up mobs that escape aoe or agroes on the healer, as many as taunt lets you
---
Stressing out about how things should be will get you nowhere.
---
If you press the "Print Screen" you'll get a wonderful screen shot the can cropped to your desired size.

---
If it is impossible, how did that person get up there you fucking retard.
---
I love meme spec but no, tank hunter is as viable as staff melee mage. It doesn't exist and you won't hold threat more than 5 sec
---
I’m making up an intentionally stupid term, just like whoever started saying spellcleave did
---
Oh yeah? Did it work on multiple occasions other than that one time in Esfands raid? I don’t think so. It hasn’t been reproduced through layering. 
---
It’s a completely different issue
---
That's a player
---
I always go for easiest groups.
---
Some peeps just want an easier time.
---
look how many times he's posted in his little thread here.
---
My preferred group horde side right now is 2 arms warriors, rogue, shaman, X (feral or hunter or an extra of one of the previous) this ravaged spam stuff is a joke though, literally the least fun thing, and seems to do less damage that just whirlwinding and cleaving with a WF totem if there’s less than like 6 targets.
---
Human imo, but that’s just because their racials are better for end game pve
---
Blizzard acknowledged it worked in instances like dungeons. NOT raids. It hasn’t been able to reproduce
---
Why's that then? 
---
But it's not really relevant anyway, because like in the OP's example, they were in a place that avoids the guards getting to them, so I'd have been able to report them.
---
Copy paste, mirror, edit.
---
Jumping hoops!
---
Lol, rage? How is it that you’re able to tell my emotions over  social media?  That’s incredible.  I’m not riled up in the least.  You’ve given me quite a few laugh, actually.
---
If they’re not saying they only take 60s then they’re in the wrong, obviously, but that’s not the point of your post at all.  Your point is they should accommodate you being under 60, and that’s on you.
---
So i can't /who someone to check when i search for dungeons. I use no census addon or anything that automates the command on mass. This is rediculous.
---
Is there any addon or setting that doesn't show the numeric value on a mobs hp and my own hp, but instead by the 100s? 
---
For example, 2.9k, 3k, 3.1k and so on.
---
I think the numeric value takes to much space on the health bar, and I've seen some YouTube videos that have the settings that show hp by the 100s. 
---
I've tried the addon realmobhealth, but can't see the option to change it as I desire:(
---
BGs will be crossrealm from the start.
---
Imagine claiming world first in a 15 year old game.
---
Lock on wing is too slow cuz they have no movement speed increases. Def Druids on the wings with shaman  center mid for an earthbind totem. Maybe lock and mage up top cuz they can snipe some 16 yard goals with pyro/soulfire. 
---
Rogues/Warriors on the back line for hamstrings and crip poisons. And a Tauren warrior in goal who can final stand and throw shield at a ball that’s headed toward upper 90 :P
---
Chinese servers have massive gold inflation. IIRC on retail tokens in EU/ US went for 100k while the Chinese tokens were 5-800k..
---
More farmers and more gold generated means what they do have is worth less.
---
Use Petopia classic, find the skill you want, tame the EXACT named pet in the list for that skill.
---
That particular talent increases the damage the target takes from the shadow element (from all sources) rather than increasing wand damage
---
World 2nd.
---
Right?
---
Tbh, the best dps I've had in a group so far was a 1h + shield enhancement shaman. Obv he didn't do a ton of dmg, but he didn't need to (nobody needs to). He interrupted enemy spellcasting, helped with emergency heals, only pulled aggro once and ran straight to the tank, and was a great teammate.
---
Is that why I keep hearing the Tauren /train sound everywhere I go?
---
Thanks for such a detailed post. I think this will really help me.
---
I had a merey bumch of mages in the group who sheeped my Scarshield Worg so i could tame it mid-fight, hvile the rest of the party dealt with the other mobs. I even named my new worg after the mage who cast sheep (thanks Hedvig!)
---
Faster to get to grom'gol, or just roll a new warrior back to 7?
---
Or someone got away with the layering exploit!
---
fuck isnt a swear word. its a comma
---
It's a useful tool to see (in very broad strokes) who is / isn't pulling their weight in group content.  As a tank it's easy to see, on some pulls it seems like someone isn't doing much and yep, lo and behold they did like 10% of the other two DPSers.  I've /w people before to very kindly ask if they could be a little more attentive and if they wanted any tips to do more damage.
---
anyone have the input for GAGGLOO ?
---
World first second.
---
Yeah apparently, though without context it creeped me out ha.
---
You can just kill the guards.
---
Critti Raikonen
---
i hope they remember all the DKS people did and then when we can start tracking kills it just hits them with all the dishonor and it takes them forever to balance out.
---
and i dunno, fairbanks alliance are a bunch of cowards, i don't know if putting things in world defense is going to make them stop saying "YoU rOllED oN A pVp SeRVeR" every time you call out where pvp is happening.
---
Ahh, good ole democracy.
---
Ah okay so there's one for both sides then.
---
Well you don’t need a high level sword skill to equip a sword, you just need to have trained in them so you can equip it. You wear it purely for stats, not for damage — so your skill really doesn’t matter. If you’re a perfectionist then yes you can just go around whacking things until your skill levels up, then move on to higher mobs when you need.
---
I mean, I already got what I needed. That being said, the rules says NOTHING about asking for monetary favors - not even close. I find it funny how you link the rule, and there's NOTHING there to support your little claim. 
---
&gt; buying/selling/trading names
---
If that's what you are referring to, then you probably need to read that properly again, before using it as reference.
---
Try two hand tanking when the mage lets you have one hit off on a mob, before he starts AoE'ing, the warlock is dotting up a different target from the one you're attacking and the hunter is going all in because he wants to kite one of the mobs.
---
Is this a joke?
---
So I guess wailing caverns was fun eh?
---
I just started playing for for the first time ever and chose vanilla. I’m sure you’re dealing with a lot of idiots like me as well. Complete noobs.
---
You are NOT prepared!
---
Titanpanel
---
It will likely be in phase 2. It currently wouldn’t work with layering but thankfully that is going away with phase 2 as well.
---
What a stupid question
---
I always get extra triggered when a tank does or skips something to save time but it ends up wiping us so really it just took more time than if they had done it the normal way
---
You choose a pvp server because pvp is fun
---
You can always kite / reset the fight until BW is back available.  Hunters are great at escaping in most situations especially while leveling and right now before anyone has PVP trinket.
---
If you're playing dps and have no idea how much of the dps you are contributing to the group, what are you even doing?
---
No third program
---
That's exactly one of them that i have. That's why im asking because i was pretty sure of myself
---
No?
---
If you’re combat (you should be) then stealth is an irrelevance.
---
Umm. I don't believe your questioning has anything to do with the choice of server. The idea mainly being that you opt for PVP in contested regions. That's it. Brings spice to a boring questing experience or other general situations.
---
This is vanilla theres no que lol
---
For some reason your comment reminds me of Ben Stillers character in Mystery Men. His power was just that he gets enraged.
---
Having two different developers writing copy.
---
Yeah, why the fuck are people on pvp servers doing pve content? Stick to your lane pve people, and if you enjoy both aspects then you belong to no server.
---
🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
---
You don't really need the weapon skill as a mage, of course it helps a tiny bit every now and then, but if you really want to level it, there's a bunch of mobs in blasted lands that go immune when they get low hp but hitting them still grants weapon skill.
---
Who let the green skin in here?
---
Just because you can’t see them doesn’t mean they’re not there 😅
---
That's what i did, and i'm pretty sure i tamed the appropriate one.
---
I really wish dungeons were harder, all this dps zerg is making both tanking and healing a miserable experience. If dps actually took damage from mobs maybe they would they would chill out abit.
---
Is it that hard to understand?
---
Subscription time, server transfer, doesn't matter. Pick your poison, but they get their money in the end.
---
for dumb-dumbs like me, sometimes you have to loot twice. clear the drop loot, then the pickpocket loot is avaliable.
---
Alliance think Horde are bad. Meanwhile we have to deal with Gnome mages and paladins in general who will attack you while fishing for no reason and waste no opportunity when low health.
---
Got a question about the addon “Zperl,” specifically the raid helper window with the target assists. I hit the X in the top right of the window and I have no idea how to get it back!! How do I get the Zperl helper window back after X-ing out of it??
---
I readed yo mama
---
I'm using itemrack atm, it does have a few issues but it's the best I've found.
---
At 48 I still find hunter pets to be better tanks than some players.  Healed a level 44 wolf all the way to the ZF mallet because the 46 warrior was too squishy and couldn't hold single target threat.  
---
That's not a jab at warriors, I'm just saying don't discount shamans, druids, and hunter pets as useful tanks/offtanks while leveling.  Sadly I have yet to see a useful voidwalker though.
---
The problem is not taming it, that's done already. Please reread my post.
---
Need gear to win harder
---
Nah dude, thats Hunter loot
---
People like the extra sense of danger a PvP server provides because of the chance of getting unexpectedly ganked or attacked by the opposing faction.
---
U get a bis trinket from engi
---
Robo chicken when in procs buffs the whole raid with 5% haste
---
A lot of prebis lists were written assuming that raid boss fights would take as long as they did when they first came out. Therefore mp5 was favoured for endurance.
---
However, even Ragnaros is dying in 3 minutes, with the average boss fight lasting around 90 seconds.  In this case, +heal is the far better stat as you can downrank to save mana and going oom is less of a risk.
---
I haven’t found a hunter yet that didn’t first global multi shot for the dps meters. Been avoiding inviting them.
---
This is correct. It often popped up in the beta
---
nonono. i forgot a not. when you are NOT the least bit interested in pvp. even missing it tho , you should understand by the rest of message that im talking about that.
---
I guarantee the only reason these guys blow through content is because 10+ years of practice and an understanding of every intricacy to the game..
---
I also get the feeling if ‘new’ content was released and new set of players would rise to the top. It takes smarts and skills to create strategy and only skills to copy - not saying these guys aren’t smart though.
---
PvPing still requires gear and the only way to get better gear as of Phase 1 is dungeons/raids. Plus, the purpose of PvP servers isnt strictly to fight other player, it's to add a second hostile element to the game world where PvE you only contend with 1 danger of the NPCs.
---
Lol good luck finding a tank and healer who'd agree to those terms
---
the cave troll arrived.
---
Grats
---
We need ranged guards.
---
Of course its against the rules. Its a bug. If you attack me from a roof in like winterspring or gadgetzan and i retaliate from the ground the guards will kill me
---
Honestly ashamed of people who actually reported these “offenders” for using clever in game mechanics. Real sad shit.
---
Aye for daggers, but I tend to go something like 23/3/25 CB/Hemo/Prep. Not sure what I'll do this time around though when I eventually get around to levelling!
---
I am a hunter an I out dps basically everyone but mages
---
WOW this is super good to know! I admittedly have abandoned some quests and even entire ZONES because all the quests there were green. Probably could have been super quick and easy xp. No fucking wonder the 40s bracket is being such a fucking nightmare for me to level though.
---
So I can link interrupts count after Mr. Big Dick rogue links how he was top dps. He often isn't on that page.
---
Oh a "bug", is that what esfands calling it now?
---
Well, they will need 8 tanks for Naxx anyway
---
Found the huntard
---
This is the 4th post whining about the same shit on hot. Guess I'll make a post in a few hours to get that sweet karma.
---
Sorry maybe I should’ve mentioned I’m EU
---
Wut lol? Are you arguing that blizzard is scummy for charging for a sub? And comparing that to a service that isn't even in classic?
---
I lvl'd 1-60 with a rogue friend in just over a week from launch with no private server experience only 15 year old vague memories of stuff.  We never got invited to good groups because rogue.. so it was alot of questing and some dungeons.  It's def possible and not all that hard if you can actually put the time in.
---
Na it’s pirates windows and that’s what I get for using pirated windows lol
---
You have no idea whether it's the main or only thing those people do unless you're following them all around and writing down how much pvp they do.
---
What do you want? General chat to be limited to "Lmao just totally killed this noob scrublord [other faction], get rekd son #toogoodtobetrue" ?
---
I guess you can't expect intelligent comments from someone who makes ridiculous  posts.
---
Gratz!
---
Where this analogy fail is that the seats would be more like air line seats where each one is paid for separately. I would not be taking common seats. I am taking the exact seats I have paid for and have been sold to me by the airline. They are my seats. Now, would it be nice for me to move my stuff or wait for a less crowd fight?  Sure. Am I required to do so? As we're not talking about someone missing their fight home ro their kids, but rather maybe having to spend a minute in a que, no. I don't think I do need to give up my "seats".

If you don’t want a tank to tank then don’t ask for a tank

Haven't spec'd it. Shadow form does cause an increase on the stats page with a shadow wand but this could be another visual glitch I suppose.

Pretty sure thunder clap isn’t that good in dungeons except for kiting

Except in China and I hate feeling dubious as to the authenticity of their one.
---
Spirit Staves are some of the best weapons a warrior can have while leveling.
---
That’s literally what he said. He just left out the PVP part because it was obviously implied.
---
Many people believe if you’re not on a PVP server you’re only playing half a game.  I play on a PVP server and I would definitely say it builds community.  People talk more, group up more, make new friends for safety (and ganking), and it adds an element of danger.  Having to take the long way sometimes to avoid the road makes it so you see things you might not have.  It can also help you player your class better with regards to utility abilities, resource conservation, and tactics.
---
oh get fcked Karen. off you go.

I just made them small for the screenshot

DPSing..

KIRTONOS bb for those horde. WATCH OUT FOR A TROLL SHAMAN NAMED SHAMOKINKUSH! HE WILL GANK ANY ALLY ON SIGHT! HE IS ME BTW!
---
That's so effing dumb. If the guards can't get you, it's fair game
---
I'm using Recount. There's also Threat Meter addon you can use
---
What a sad little man you are.
---
daaamn, at least give it to a rogue, right?!
---
Enhancement in raids consists of dropping totems and auto-attacking.  It is not a fun or engaging spec to play.  
---
You'll be expected to totem twist (switch wf and GoA every 10 seconds) which will eat all of your mana.
---
You'll struggle for gear because you want strength gear and there isn't any tier set for you.
---
You'll be consistently last on the meters and have to defend your spot on the basis that your buffs have helped the rest of your party do more damage than replacing you with a another rogue or fury warrior would have provided.
---
Do guilds use Enh shaman? Yes.  But only if you are a great guildmate as well as a competent player.

Cool stuff

More likely to offer transfers but only for one faction.

Can someone please help me farm the charms for my lvl 30 warrior quest?

Enjoy all the one shots, make heads fly, get r14 and have fun =)

Wishing for a fair fight in open world pvp where every player is at a different level of power.

Baffling...
---
whats name of the addon to take ss everytime u ding?
---
seeing as I don't comment and post about a game targeted for tweens, I don't see an issue
---
Fuck retail.  Also fuck the leveling grind after like 30.  Isn't it weird how sometimes it seems like different people like different things?
---
general chat is just an extra observation. yeah when you are "leveling" "questing" in an area that everyone wants to kill you but you apparently give 0 fcks about that but keep doing your thing , i consider it trash. sorry.
---
I swear, I could count the number of rogues seen in 2 weeks of being lvl 60 on two hands. While leveling, I didn't even see one.
---
I guess that not all pets have the spell. Had to catch a few bat's for the screech rank I wanted to get. If they don't have it at tame, they won't learn it from nothin
---
Preposterous! Ninjas don't exist!
---
Was getting soulshards with 3 of my group outside rfk when a 10+ lvl gnome mage rolls up and pulls a piggy.

I pull the pig off him as hes running, somehow get flagged for pvp, and he repays me with a frostbolt.

Que my mates and I obliterating the gnome as he spams arcane explosion. 
---
Never trust a gnome.
---
This is the kind of experiences that make the pvp servers better.
---
When it goes wrong it hurts but when it goes right it feels awesome.
---
I would rather feel bad emotions than no emotions at all which is how retail turned out - a bland tread mill.
---
No one called out or even cared about world first Hand of Ragnaros which was created two days ago. Not sure where you draw that assumption from.
---
Nice, I have the gold for full bis items, idk if i want to spend it though lol
---
...also this
---
You mean when they charge in the same time you do?
---
I don’t see a ton at 60 but group choice has been rough. We share bis with nearly everyone. It’s hard for a rogue lol
---
Thanks for the tip! I honestly never really thought of this

Which states:  
---
 And to answer questions...   
---
This is how these work. Any spell that is a single target spell hitting  you will bounce back to the caster. That means frostbolt, frost shock,  Icy enchants, and hunter's freezing traps (for example).   
---
Anything that is a frost AoE will not bounce back, but you will be  immune. This means frost nova, Cone of Cold, Blizzard, etc. So if a mage  frost novas while i have this active, I will be immune, but it won't  root the mage. However, if he frostbolts me, it will bounce off of me,  hit him, damage him, and snare him.   
---
I've found that the fire reflectors is more useful for reflecting  spells, because a lot of frost spells are instant, so you don't have  time to activate the reflector. Fire on the other hand has fireball and  pyroblast, both of which bounce back and own mages pretty hard.    
---
Activating a reflector will break stealth. If you want to kill a mage, a  pretty good tactic would be to Ambush, Activate Frost Reflector, and  then continue your normal damage and/or stun routine. This way you are  immune to the frost nova that mages always use when you ambush them, and  you can pretty easily have the mage dead before frost nova cools down  again.
---
This is just wrong, but you are probably trolling anyway.
---
How do you know?
---
I’m a Shaman. I’m levelling as enhancement (the only viable levelling spec) but I keep an Int set for healing dungeons.
---
While I’m healing, healing loot is mine. When an upgrade drops for my enhancement spec I wait and see how the dps roll. If they all greed I’ll ask if I can have it for my levelling spec. If any one of them needs then I pass.
---
I can get way more groups as a healer than a dps so I’m going to see more drops on more runs. It doesn’t take long to get upgrades for my levelling spec when you’re running as heals, sooner or later most dps get the upgrades they need to make things surplus for me. In the end if you’re patient and not a douche you can have your cake and eat it too.
---
Alright let's see...
---
Druid - to me, this is aquatic quest. You get a taste of how big the world is and how much you need to do to unlock a nearly useless ability, but get to savor just how amazing it is when it's actually needed.
---
Hunter - tough... Honestly no hunter is a hunter until 10. The entire class unlocks at that point, but a second "passage" is successfully feign-deathing. Could be in PvP, tricking an opponent, or a clutch pull/feign in a party. Bonus points for jumper cables.
---
Mage - portals... I think finally unlocking every portal shows not only you, but everyone else you've been to each corner and know about the secret trainers. It's extremely useful for everyone, and can save 30+ minutes when used in conjunction with warlock portals.
---
Paladin - honestly... Probably the first time you die*but right before you do* get that incredibly clutch lay on hands off, or divine intervention. Nothing can compete with a paladins "uh-oh" button, and showing off that reflex speed and attention.. people will lose their shit .
---
Priest - mind controlling Zeppelin's/Boats. Every priest needs to do it at some point. Show the opposing faction why Shadow is a strong discipline, and earn the merit for garnering rogues ambushes on these transports.
---
Rogue - some may disagree, but it isn't the dps. It isn't even lock picking. Not the distract-off-the-ledge, though that shows one's skill... It's the PvP cc. No other class can dish out as powerful single Target cc as a rogue in such a short period of time. Sapping a target, blinding another, killing a third with all cooldowns and utilizing every gouge CD and kick to debilitate your opponents... Add in grenades, and rogues are like the parallel of mages.
---
Shaman - there are so many tiers to unlock for shamans, this is tough. I think the ultimate shaman-passage, however, is a proper one shot. no class has the RNG burst potential like a shaman. Windfury, fire nova, elemental mastery, chao lighting earth shock.... You aren't a shaman until you've purged a warlocks shield and promptly put them to sleep.
---
Warlock - the void Walker sac survive. You're finishing a mob, a player, oom, and attacked by another. You sac the void, healthstone, life tap, fear, drain, dot, fear, and the enemies lose their shit as you whittle them down while you stay at &lt;5%. Warlocks are just as dangerous at 10% hp as they are at 100. 
---
Warrior - whirlwind axe. No warrior can claim they "did it all" without completing this brutal quest chain. Even if they wait and do it at 40 (but who would??) It's a necessary evil. It shows everyone you're a warrior. Nothing more to say, text book passage.
---
Weird, that must be an addon because I have never had to do that in Retail (BC-BFA) or Classic
---
altho i understand where you are coming from , still that wouldnt help anyone who actively avoids pvp at all costs. i wouldnt be making such a post if it was something that happened a couple of times. i'm witnessing this for weeks.
---
Get the right worg. I might have written Scarshield Worg (the first ones you encounter) but you need the Bloodaxe Worgs further in the dungeon.
---
Swords are just better even with lower dps since the sword talent is so good.
---
I'm pretty confident this applies to both factions.
---
Do you play on Herod? Think I’ve seen your name before.
---
I agree, however, there is one thing I've noticed after years of playing alliance. Horde spit on other players, in and out of pvp, 100 times to every 1 Alliance spitting.
---
From the bluepost regarding the layering exploit:
---
"Someone mentioned Esfand’s random MC reset in this thread, which is a pretty clean example of the other end of the spectrum. In that case, they just turned up to raid and the instance had been reset. They didn’t do anything intentional to cause it or go looking for reproduction steps so they could abuse it - in fact, they reported it to us and didn’t continue until they got confirmation that it was out of their control (and that we wouldn’t consider it an exploit if they cleared).
---
Side note for the curious: that was a completely separate bug that has existed since 2004, and actually happened several times back then, it just wasn’t being broadcast to thousands of viewers at the time."
---

---
Yes you get kicked if you don t move from the same spot. But that happens regardless of using a script
---
Finally a warrior tank speaks out on this sub with a PSA.  So brave.
---
So rather than having a warrior mtigate damage, youre stacking so much cc that youre cc tanking... which still requires the party to be on task and not do shit like constantly break cc by spamming aoe.
---
This mindset is annoying imo.
---
To me, I think this is part of the sandbox. Gather a group together and get your pattern, don't cry about areas being camped by horde/ally in a PvP world.
---
[Dwarfish]: Aaaahahaha
---
Well you can’t just “get” another race’s mount. You have to be exalted with that faction which is why it’s difficult
---
Why have a feature that no one can make good use of? You’d just be spammed with random places getting attacked when it’s just someone from the other faction trying to run from a guard or accidentally attacking an NPC they don’t realize is pvp flagged.
---
Until honor is implemented, the odds of an impromptu pvp battle are not likely. You’re generally going to know about it ahead of time, as some of the reddit posts have done. “Yo, were gonna go fuck up x town. I bet you Horde/alliance bitches won’t come defend it from our rampage” kind of stuff.
---
Man to any tank that is, let's say,  nervous, about pugs being nasty, just remember this game, especially through levelling, has a very low amount of tanks. You are way more important than anyone else in the group. If you ever feel uncomfortable threaten to leave or just leave, I guarantee you can find another group almost instantly. Dont ever put up with bullshit as a tank.  
---
On the other hand, tanks please dont use this scarcity to be a dick yourself. That's just a bad move and noone wants to play with that guy.
---
Dps warriors seem to universally not understand how threat/aggro works (because if they did they would be tanking most likely).
---
Spamming hero strike on the mob I'm not focusing, running away out of conc when they get aggro, charging casters that I'm trying to LoS, the fun never ends.
---

Find a better guild?  Boot out the trouble makers?
---
Beat me to it. 
---
Soccer ffs......
---
Magnificent
---
You are sad. People like you are what turned this game into retail. Someday, you will grow up and learn that life is not fair, even without roof top “exploitation”.
---
You ll hit a wall and get kicked
---
It can be a way to check your efficiency, as a tank you're proud when you keep the aggro and stay alive, as a healer you're proud when you keep everybody alive and when you still have mana at the end of the fight, and finally as a dps you're proud when you see that your damage contribution was high
---
PW Shield is also a good "oh shit"-button to keep the tank from dying in a pinch, just not as a tool in the main rotation toolbox
---
What about who tells their story?
---
I ground the Devilsaur leather out with a guildie last night, the ready is drop or quest,
---
For a while I was plugging certain boss spams, like golem angerforge and arena, or the first few bosses in Ubrs. Spamming first boss on backdoor of scholo for my bis helm. Maid a warlock at 4 am 15g to solo princess for me and my bis ring dropped. 
---
I actually didn’t spent much gold
---
Most of us play for fun and not for efficiency. Whenever I heal a dungeon for mages that want to pull the entire dungeon and only speak in twitch emotes I put them on my ignore list and never group with them again.
---
Rip hunter tank dream, by the way what would you say its the best use for the survival talent tree?
---
I think the community is going to see that layering can never be removed.  The game was originally created around a population of a few thousand and not 10k+ like we have now.  Patterns that take days to respond, mob respawns in overpopulated zones, herb and ore node respawns.  The amount of resources available to such a large amount of players is going to create massive scarcity.
---
So I’m from retail, why are the warlocks from private servers not using curse of agony? Do they not understand it does way more?
---
I was doing like 150 more dps than them on every fight, I guess is retail players are just that much better.
---
How much gold did it cost you?
---
So that's a yes then.
---
Same, I'm really missing the ability to automatically deposit and withdraw entire gear sets at the bank. I used to be able to open the bank, click my healing set and it would withdraw it and equip it automatically and deposit the equipped set.
---
And the Ice Barbed Spear is the coolest of them all
---
 **Thrash**  
---
Instant  
---
Requires level 14Gives the caster 2 extra attacks.  x2
---
Right and thotbot is cool? If someone wants to save 5 seconds and some reading whats the issue.
---
Twinking is huge in classic, 39-49 especially. Many in our Guild have a 60 hunter and farming gold for their twink boe items and enchant, a full specced out twink will costs a lot of gold.
---
I know, this will be a one time thing to streamline my char (at least before lvl 60)  
---
Thanks for the clarification tho, it will be useful for anyone reading this.
---
This was clearly done so we can never know for sure that more people are playing classic than retail.
---
How about all the priests/locks fearing people into SM and getting stuck?
---
God yes. I'm too polite to leave a group where I'm healing a rambo tank, but I really want to. It's more stressful than fun, especially if you don't have mage water to spam drink with.
---
Flametongue wep or WF weapon, depending on whichever rank you've gotten most recently, or if you've even learned WF yet. And yeah, just use Flame Shock. If you're constantly pulling aggro with it, it's because you're using it too soon into combat. Let the tank build threat.
---
100% agree.  I just dont feel like combat is very rogue like.  Give me that 40-60% ambush and the ability to sneak around better with stealth talents.
---
I leveled a rogue to 25 as combat and then 34 as hemo, which hemo felt only slightly better.  I've now rerolled on another server as dagger sub and it I don't think its slower due to it being more fun and I rarely have to bandage and eat, whereas combat I was definitely ating every two fights.
---
Generally, there's only a few reasons people want to become an officer/GM and stay one long term, despite the extra work involved in something you do for fun:
---
A) They view it as being someone's superior, and want the status.
---
B) They want the political influence in the guild to use to their own/friend's advantage. Often coupled with A.
---
C) They have too little going on in real life, and being involved in leading the group gives their life more meaning. These guys can range from the best officers/GMs you'll ever meet to frustrating assholes who suck the fun out of the game because they're over-doing it.
---
D) They genuinely want the group to succeed because they care for it, and they recognize that someone has to do it. It's a burden/responsibility to these people, and most of the time they'd love to hand it over to someone else if they thought it would work. They're often the best choices and most self-aware, but are prone to suddenly quitting/retiring when the stress gets too much. Which usually leads to A, B, or C.
---
Well yeah, retail still has the best and more challenging end game content.
---
Classic has been complete faceroll for me so far...
---
Or the tank.
---
I though I’d read recently that Bliz intends to introduce an Armory service/API for classic. Wouldn’t that provide census information far more accurately if it goes live?
---
You're a tank, but a pretty bad one if you need a minute to mentally prepare between each pull in some easy 5 man dungeon.
---
It happened to me once and I just thought the mobs had some extra attack because there were 2 of them and my health went from 85% to 10% in two seconds.
---
I'll deffinitely be on the lookout for this more.
---
For me definitely
---
Using it to interrupt is fine. But all those enhance shamans seem to use it as a dmg top up.
---
I think that’s what makes the game fun and interesting (ganking and being ganked). Otherwise, this game is just solitaire. He was providing valuable flavor to the game. Sorry the game was too hard for you. Don’t worry, your kind always wins and ruins the fun for everyone eventually.
---
hell yea!
---
If I had to guess, they're leveling ele or resto, but if they are low on mana and can't kite anymore, they want to swap their staff that is probably weak on weapon dmg but has caster stats with a staff that has stronger weapon damage to melee better.
---
Tank hunter isn't really a thing for obvious reasons, but being horde would help tremendously as it allows you to fish for Windfury procs by spamming wing clip.
---
It's link a slow poison that crawls through your mind, taking the fun away. If everyone had that mindset have fun with getting gear or even doing some bosses as a party of 5 mages.
---
It’s like that movie contraception
---
tbh, icy veins seems kinda garbage.
---
Nice to see people managing that addiction. It's a really easy one to fall in to in my experience.
---
Cheers from a fellow engineer that had to cut WoW away to actually pass and get a degree as well :)
---
(I have relegated myself to being a "filthy casual" in the gaming world 😀)
---
Everyone is the same. You don't notice alliance players spitting because you mostly play alliance.
---
Damn son... this dude will beat everyone in pvp except mages.
---
99% of players don't wipe in low level dungeons, that's not an accomplishment lol
---
This place just seems like a waist of time
---
Just spirit rez and hearth... No durability loss if you spirit rez under lvl 10 and graveyards are always safe to rez in (safe from mobs at least)
---
I love you too friend
---
With how many people?
---
Hell idc what speed the tank pulls as long as I don’t have to tank :)
---
Think about it. I know you can do that. Sit for a moment and think.
---
oh my sweet summer child, leveling is the easiest part of the game, for xp is guaranteed but everything else after 60 is rng.
---
&gt; because they usually will be replaced before or as soon as you hit 60. Exception is trinkets, which my first epic was a world drop Life Stone.
---
The irony of this is hilarious.
---
These questions are not directly related to shaman, but I need some assistance.
---
I picked shaman on pve server with mining and engineering (gnomish-spec) profs. Currently I have some problems with making money by selling Sniper scopes for 5g each. Is this considered to be too expensive and I should lower the price? Is it profitable to sell other scopes or should I stick to the highest one?
---
Second group of questions is, what should I craft for myself for pve combat? Are grenades worth using for aoe killing? What armour and accessory should I craft, since I’m playing enh shaman? (Already made myself parachute cloak for sweet +8 agility,  gnomish googles and gnomish belt).
---
Thanks in advance.
---
Cry some more little baby. "Waaah, I didn't think of this first. Ban them daddy blizzard!"
---
If they keep PvP and PvE server queues separate then horde will still see longer queues considering they outnumber on every server
---
I found this out LONG after completing/outlevelling the zone.
---
Im envious of how much time you have. Farming 100-150g a week for respects sounds like a lot of effort.
---
The same happened to me yesterday, a shaman was on top of the cage in gadgetzan attacking people without repercussions, good to know this is against the rules
---
I have played since retail launch, I know how it goes after level cap, I love end game. I hate leveling. Always have
---
Ok, thanks for the info!
---
Ench shamans are better off with 2h axes in pve. Ogre racial is huge for them.
---
You got to level 60 really, really fast. The average level is still in the 30s. It shouldn’t come as surprise then that all the other players/guilds at 60 are pretty hardcore.
---
Give it a month for the rest of us to get to 60 and you’ll find more chilled people to play with.
---
Thanks, not saying I won't modify this though haha
---
Looks alphabetical but in a counterclockwise orientation. Thank you for this graphic!
---
Good for you. Some people didn't and some people are unaware. OP is just trying to help and you're over here flexing for no reason and helping no one.
---
Crit is the best stat for hunters so the helm is actually very good. 
---
When broken down, 1% crit is = to 20 agility when I looked it up on WoWhead
---
Where is, pulls even if no mana
---
You sound butthurt. Like all horde ;-)
---
Did you walk through the snow, uphill both ways?
---
Do you grind at all? Chances go up with the amount of mobs you kill.
---
When all you do is make posts trying to bait people lmao. Someone needs attention.
---
CHINA NUMBA 1
---
Barring one, the last 9 or 10 I have had from 20-40 refuse to interrupt anything at all. One time I had two in a shitty Cath cleave and neither of them did. I play rogue as well, so I understand that sometimes you need to finish off a Myrmidon that just enraged and you can't save your energy for a kick, but 90% of the time you should always have 20 energy saved up in case you need to interrupt.
---
Whether you use your energy at 70 or at 30, as long as you aren't hitting 100/100(120) energy and wasting it, there's no need to hammer those buttons as fast as you can and sit on zero energy the majority of the time. In fact, that is the opposite of what you should do, which could be the problem with most of these Rogues, but since some of them NEVER interrupt the entire time, I'm going to say they never even tried. I run addon plates and can see who interrupt.
---
Rogue is a very easy PvE class to play, as are most classes to be fair, but you DO have to manage your energy. That is your main job aside from keeping your evis and other timers up. There are always exceptions that I granted you, but if you don't interrupt once the entire dungeon, then it's not bad timing, it's not even trying. I wish we could trade all our server's rogues for yours, because the majority on ours are shit.
---
I couldn’t be happier with DD.  People are super chill, zero q’s, groups for anything I’ve wanted to do form quickly, damn near 50/50 pop balance, and zero q ever.
---
I’m not sure what more you could want in a server.
---
Yikes, imagine putting that much effort into a job, or education, or improving your life.
---
So, I forgot that Rogue could learn sword and I asked at /1 is it possible to learn it somewhere. Three people answered my question, we had laugh etc. some of them said that they want beer for their answer. I did not thought long. I went and fished for famous rum! (as there is no beer in the Forsaken land). Sent them items with a thank you letter. That is what I received back.
---
Remember, if you miss great classic vibes, you're the one creating those.
---
Of course that would be great. It's just Blizzard and Activision who makes the decisions
---
You should add in lvl ranges
---
My spite slice is a little bigger.
---
Some days my Imp casts it, some days he doesn't.
---
Group may ahve wiped but the mage was #2!
---
Totemtimer. Very few totems are keybound except frequently used ones such as grounding and searing. The rest go into a neat toolbar this add-on provides.
---
Said the horde who is crying their eyes out everytime they lose 1v1 :D
---
This is for classic WoW. Not vanilla/private servers.
---
ARMOURY XD - just type armory
---
Not having a job but instead wasting your life in a 15 year old video game doesn’t sound ‘nice’
---
So you see 4 people greeding and you decide to need for an item you all don't need but all could use the money of = not scummy. Thats by all definitions ninjalooting. Either 5 people greed or 5 people need.
---
Thats a retarded argument, if you made that up yourself then no thats convincing at all and just seems like you're a scummy ninjalooter yourself.
---
Some guilds abused layering before the fix meaning that there was definitely enough ingots and they wanted to be rid of them.
---
Nope. Another 5 years at least before that’s gonna happen.
---
Ive gotten blue boes
---
Any insight on best herb farming spots?
---
Pretty fuckin lame that ghost wolf cancels waterwalking
---
I remember back in the day running on windows xp, zoning into the wrong SM was a fatal 15 minute loading nightmare.
---
At least, dw fury gets better with gear iirc. They might not have an enhance shammy.
---
Like I said, I experimented around with it all the way till actually getting r2 where I started using it no matter what, and the total damage output using r1 was never consistently better like you're trying to imply. With precision eviscerate very rarely missed, and if you're leveling standard you won't have relentless strikes until after getting r2 so your point about being free is moot.
---
Good to know, thanks
---
Sometimes this, but from one rogue to another I've found more use keeping it on the aggro setting. Rather not be the dude who keeps pulling off the tank rather than top dps.
---
Of course, this is my first time playing rogue so it might just take a while to get the feel for it...there's vanish as well...fuck did I just talk myself out of my own point?
---
Just hit 44 on my paladin. I'm leveling as ret. It feels like I"m having to stop and drink water after every other pull now, and this is even with a new blessing. 
---
Should I be looking at picking up more gear with int/spirit to help with this?
---
In raids a healer will get Divine Intervention or Soulstone and raise another healer then you will raise everyone. It's easier to target unreleased corpses and it also prevents people from going back into the dungeon and face trash repops therefore needing a Lock teleport or a massive waste of time if you have no Lock/Shards.
---
I thought you couldn't tame if your current pet isn't stabled?
---
Of course it would, but there is no Armory atm, not even the statics page with the most kills, most killed etc. we had back in Vanilla.
---
But why are your action bars in the middle of the screen?! I’m nauseous
---
reflectors could never reflect AOE damage or spells.
---
It’s even more mind blowing that you can’t grasp:
---
Blizzard made it available for people to do it in the game. It was obviously going to happen. Banning someone for the playing the game is absurd.
---
&gt;Your aoe is shit.
---
*Laughs in hellfire*
---
RoF is shit. Hellfire deals comparable damage to mages in these AoE groups, it's just much more risky and you need the healer to know what you're about to do.
---
I understand that this behavior is bad and why you don't like it. However, as Horde, this is exactly what Alliance does to us.
---
Only problem is when you get smacked by the hard hitter bosses.  Those heals have to be on point.
---
Real life Pawn Stars
---
It's almost as if people grew up and got responsibilities and can't justify wandering aimlessly through a 14 year old game
---
Hao do you figure?
---
I just cant wait to be king
---
Yea that would be fair. But if you’re able to do that in a game without hacking the software, then it wouldn’t even be an exploit.
---
&gt; and have 0 defense
---
Because you don't need it for these low level dungeons, you go 11 points in Holy first and then Prot.
---
At level 36 you can be 11/16 and your spec can look like [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sxVzZVhdf).
---
Paladins are excellent tanks especially for low level dungeons *because* of Consecration, Warriors can't do that kind of AoE threat at early levels.
---
It was great fun! 
---
It was also fun running the dungeon afterwards. Nothing quite like seeing all those foul creatures getting slain by a true hero of the Alliance ;)
---
But then your warrior can’t *use* their rage. Attacks that consume rage cause a chemical-like reaction that can't occur if the rage has nowhere to go.
---
Even if it's "only" 7 people. That's still 7 people that would actively play more and use the slot they got. Instead of a character jumping up and down somewhere.
---
Don’t take it personally man. If they want to take a few mobs on themselves, let them. Don’t have a panic attack when you lose aggro to foolish dps like we are going to think you are a bad tank or something. Just make sure the healer isn’t being wailed on
---
Too bad it's garbage. I'll buy it from you for a gold
---
I killed a dude alot and he some how made a lvl 1 and whispered me all mad so that was cool
---
I’d really like an answer for this as well
---
You are borderline retarded. Anyone with half a brain passes these to warriors/rogues. Do you even REALIZE WHAT THE MAIN DAMAGE IS TO PEOPLE, LOL
---
Hypnotic blade and offhand from SM are a great duo.  Lots of spell power there.
---
"sumtimez I melee!!!"
---
It’s not a bug, it’s an ability certain mobs have and it’s pretty much Windfury on steroids.
---
My quest for revenge for the attrocities of the yeti cave shall be enduring and undying.

I don't like griefing. Kill once or twice and it is fine... but why more?

Im having this same problem with figuring out which keys to move skills to.  My setup seems very inefficient, and I’m even noise clicking some icons.   If you find a good resource, please share!
---
No. There is a second hidden roll.
---
They have done at least some of them.
---
As a lifelong tank, I love these!
---
Honestly wasnt required. A lot of really interesting questions about population were not able to be answered by what the census bots gave out, with time sure. 
---
I was kinda against the lfg addon but not after the horror I've seen people pull off with modified auctionator.

My god that is the biggest cancer of classic, thousands of single items listed that flood anyone trying to use the basic AH to buy anything. Buy and sell macros.

Sad to see it go. I think it was healthy for players to see what type of environment they were going to be joining should they take a free transfer etc. 
---
Plus classic isnt really vanilla at all. People killing rag in 6 days, layering, overpopulation. Phases. A census bot was the least of their concern.
---
You are so much farther then me in your priest journey &amp; i am jealous
---
What sort of tank did you have? I sailed through the last boss yesterday healing as a 41 full shadow.
---
It's the troublemakers we kicked out who found a way to keep making trouble.
---
Yeah, but what if you don't want to spam dungeons?
---
I hope I have a desolate farm like this in real life when i'm older haha.. up in New Hampshire or Maine ideally xD
---
the one that did not work in raids you mean?
---
I usually tell them and I try my hardest to be informative rather than combative but they usually take it poorly.
---
What did you do for leveling since a lot of dungeon runs aren’t rogue heavy
---
It feel like I’m wearing nothing at all
---
Got Orb of the Forgotten Seer as a drop from SM GY yesterday and want to use it
---
Details damage meter has a threat plugin you can display
---
That's true I was at work on graveyard this post was purely for entertainment
---
I'd buy this comic!
---
ALL these annoying ban responses, he is on a pvp server killing players dont blame the player blame the game that allows it. If blizzaird dont like it they need to own their shit n fix it n stop banning the players for playing the game that blizzaird CODED THEMSELVES.
---
How do you make 80g an hours from farming? On big realms even at most crazy hours like 4:00 AM there are at least 15-20 lvl60 characters in the zone just from your faction. Even if only 2-3 of them are farming what you are farming leaves literaly no resources at all.   
---
I won't exactly say about mining because I don't do that, but I do herb. I can do full route in EPL at night and get 2-3 nodes, same goes to Felwood which is proly the best herbing zone yet if there is someone else herbing I get 4-5 nodes per circle.
---
Maybe to people trying to be self important, but are any of the mechanics different? Same bosses? Same farming? If so, this was done a decade ago. So server first
---
Google will it classic. It's an aggregate for addons that work in classic
---
If you’re on Fearalis I’ll buy it! :)
---
Ubrs runs with the build, a ton of brd in the early and mid 50’s just taking any group that’ll take me, and killing anything I came in contact with between any quest I could do solo
---
depends on what you're tanking. single target? yea, go ahead and dw/2h tank; 5+ mobs? might  want that shield to hide behind.
---
Luckily as soon as i could do the quest i did. Better now then never :)
---
I run hypno blade from Sm lib and the orb from gy.
---
While that's true, you can't argue that the feature isn't amazing, and it allows players to experience the game TOGETHER. If we had this all along, I'd have about 30 fewer alts, as every time a friend wanted to make an alt or new player came to the game I wouldn't have needed to make a new character to play with them.
---
Fucking sucks that Classic comes out just as the one thing that could ever get me interested in OW again came out(role queue).
---
Smells like layering exploit to me.
---
So ban them from your discord?  
---
And then change the permanent link or make it invite only or whatever you need to keep them out of DC.
---
Alliance /spit all the time. I’m assuming you’re an alliance player who doesn’t /spit so you have an observational bias.
---
Just a minor note,  dragon rider boots are available phase 1 (i have them).
---
Talking boss kills over a minute 
---
I ranked fifth best warlock on skeram and these private server warlocks kept taking crap about us retail players.
---
Link please!
---
This is the case. I think the faster loot mods alleviate this.
---
Yeah and if you do the boarhunter quest alongside the two others in that area you'll be killing like 200 of them, ez wool though I don't really see a use for it, AH sells at vendor price anyway as far as I can see.
---
Buy everything, you can find different weapon trainers in different cities. You can ask the weapon master where to buy a specific skill and they should point you in the right direction.
---
Yea sure and if you believe that I have some items to sell you
---
At 55 bought my warden staff (bis for druid tanks) for 320 and still have 70g in my pocket. It REALLY ramps up after 40
---
It's not just killing lowbies though. It's exploiting guard behavior to attack the opposite faction with no consequences outside of GM intervention.
---
Because of botting
---
you can still buy windows 7 cdkey for like 2-5$ and upgrade it to windows 10
---
Gold can ramp up but the vast majority of players will not get 500 gold. It often takes a concerted effort. Many players will be stuck under 100g basically forever.
---
Aggro range within the city or in a building is abusing terrain.
---
It's really fast.... if you're not contested.
---
Might be easier off AOE grinding dungeons with a group.
---
I'll be running from this guy if I see him in game
---
What build? Do you mind sharing
---
It's the distance you have to travel and risk involved. I was thinking about this a few days ago when I was waiting for 8 mins for the zeppelin.
---
In retail, you're only as far away as a teleport + flying distance in everything but the new expansion (until flying is re-added later). And there are teleports sprinkled all over, there's several on Kalimdor/Eastern Kingdoms. And new expansion continents are generally fairly compact in comparison. Combine that with the fact that you can fly on your mount for a lot of it means there's very little risk of getting ganked off your mount.
---
In classic, it takes like 20-30 mins to cross the world. I'm honestly not sure I prefer it. It makes the world feel a lot more real, but I don't have the mostly unlimited playtime I did when I was younger. Spending 20m to cross the world for an instance group, only to have the tank leave after the boss he wanted dies gets old real fast when you only have 3 hours of playtime that day.
---
The entire game is still just shooting shields.
---
Talent build?
---
It cracks me up that in the wow classic community we seem to have 2 types of players.  Those that know and those that don’t.  I’m seeing posts about MC clears and Rag hammers being crafted.  The on the other hand we have posts like this and makes me wonder just exactly how badly has retail dumbed things down.  
---
The spectrum is wide on the nuances of classic I suppose.
---

---
They will be. Tons of people are quit - queues are smaller than before, and there are waaaay less layers than before. Pretty much each days there are less and less players playing.
---
Are you intentionally saying buffling?
---
lol hi mom
---
Several of them send you back again.
---
Nah I get you here. I levelled as holy, I would need on any type of gear if it had intellect on but always pass on any dps / tank plate &amp; mail if someone else in group needed. I long for the day I no longer wear a dress
---
I'll add something though. I respec my shaman (enhance) which makes you unlearn two hand axe/mace. When I put the point in that talent to "relearn" it. It does not bring your skill back to 0. It out my two hand axe skill back to where it was before respec
---
Yeah I really feel for tanks in classic, 8/10 dps don’t realize how much threat they put out and how much threat tanks really *don’t* put out immediately.
---
I'm a healer so really the worst thing you can do in my opinion is not pay attention to me. If you're having a hard time keeping aggro and a monster is on me it makes my job 10x harder. Cause then I have to heal myself instead of you while we're both getting attacked AND my spells take longer to cast. And another thing is that some tanks are too slow or too cautious. I appreciate a thoughtful tank but I played with one who thought he had to line of sight every monster. We told him to quit and he had a fit so we kicked him. Just use common sense, that's all I can really tell you.
---
Oh wow the game launched without Ivory or Mottled Red Raptor?
---
Man, people in here have some REALLY weird assumptions and projections about rogue. 
---
All rogues use stealth, all rogues have the same tools but a few based on talents. they all use ambush, they all use stealth. 
---
You use macros to weapon swap and stealth for all approaches and CCs, you don't HAVE to use your tools on any rogue, but obviously you should.
---
Some people really seem to being playing combat without using stealth and distract and blind and others, then complaining it "feels like a squishy warrior"
---
no shit your playing them like one, Lmao
---
why is everybody wearing heirlooms?
---
Normally could come down to debuff limit is usually why. On raid targets we're looking at a 16 debuff limit, for 40 people.
---
Shadowbolt usually does more damage. Maybe someone else has some other insight.
---
Min/max choice is engineer for pvp.
---
Play what you want.  Blacksmiths are needed and a lot of the endgame items are crafted.  Resist gear for starters.  Nightfall is another big weapon that is in high demand.
---
Do sm until lvl 42, easy to find groups
---
It's not. The guy was exploiting on top of the Booty Bay inn.
---
Thanks for chiming in!
---
Hunter is one of the fastest and easiest 1-10 classes
---
No guild on retail really requires achievements to begin raiding with them. Especially casual guilds that raid once or twice a week.
---
Just dps tank it with a 2H in defensive stance if it's a sub 50 dungeon.
---
Your not going to get an ingot every run. Thats why he said 24
---
So is pulling mobs with a weak rank spell with the intention of someone else having to kill it for you.
---
Same, but also Dwarves too.
---
Get the best bags you can get , filling bags and vendoring shit is very lucrative
---
yeah you've been posting the same nonsense assumptions for the past few weeks and going silent every time someone comes up with a rebuttal. 
---
Suffice to say you really don't like other players having their fun.
---
It’s normally better to do green quests because you’ll do them so much quicker when the mobs are 2-3 levels below you compared to 2-3 levels above you. The time you save easily makes up for the lower xo you get from the mods and the quest xp is the same either way.

---
Its BIS for pvp war till C'thun tho..
---
Our guild had two extra bosses respawn when we went to do Rag last night. We opened a ticket and did not kill them, but it can apparently still happen. We are waiting to see what the GM says.
---
I've seen cowards 5v1 on either side, the whole MUH FACTION GOOD URS BAD thing is just a shit meme at this point. Roll pve or shut up
---
My rule is "you pull, you tank". I've let some oblivious hunters die repeatedly because they won't stop pulling.
---
Horde is still overall more favored. Alliance will have easy queues.
---
These are the moments that truly make classic special.
---
I think he and his group were ganking near the bow of the ship on the Booty Bay inn where guards wouldn't come and attack them. It's not just ganking.
---
There is literally no reason that they would do this.
---
Agreed. I'm on a newer server and we got server first onxyia last night. 31 people in raid because another guild was going to attempt her this week and we didnt have enough that finished the chain/lvl 60. Play what you want, you dont need to min max to beat the raids like many want you to believe.
---
&gt; Let them die. Tell the healer to not heal them.
---
I wouldn't listen to the tank if I were healing that group, that's just how spellcleave AoE farms work, the tank picks up dangerous mobs and holds those, the mages AoE/kite the rest.
---
Oh right in this scenario the tank can't be a self righteous diva, meh, yeah I guess it's a bad idea.
---
I truly believe that classic experience is awesome but in the same time I think that there is some stuff that can be improved, ie. kolkar's booty in the barrens (centaur area) should be picked locked. Currently there is no such option.
---
Where can we report such thingies for Blizzard to fix... 
---
Or maybe it should stay that way?
---
This is a good post, unfortunately the legions of bumblefuck morons playing DPS won't be actively trying to improve themselves so won't ever read/implement any of it.
---
Hi There Sutari, this is Militia (or stunnashades/hyphy) great to see this post.  Such good memories!  I haven't reconnected with very many people, but i see devilsadvice on battlenet lately.  Im playing alone on kirtonos (my buddies are slow/already quit).
---
GZ M8
---
&gt;I think the community is going to see that layering can never be removed
---
So much this. I don't think anyone has any real concept of what 100k pop servers are going to look like in 2-4 months when the casual levelers start hitting 60. I'm thinking AQ opening on some serious roids.
---
There aren't any reputation locked recipes for engineering that I'm aware of.
---
Is there an engineering mailbox in classic?
---
Even a night elf like Pique could work :D
---
This makes me feel good.
---
Huh. That's new isn't it?
---
I see plenty of green maces with a shadow spell bonus on AH.
---
Nice one ! :)
---
Twerkasaurusrex on Kirtanos....you orc warrior, you will be mine one day
---
*B A S S*
---
The best way to make more money is to level up.
---
&gt;I farmed gold/herbs/mines
---
&gt;With my gold I looked in world chat to buy 7 Sulfuron Ingots
---
So, layering exploits. Lol.
---
Defias Mask is definitely rite of passage for rouges
---
thanks ! Any idea for the mail one? Doest CT mail still work?
---
They res up and die instantly
---
As long as we have the req tanks and healers, we dont care about what spec the dps play. You dont even need a full raid to clear raids even. Wed rather have reliable and cool people than optimal specs.
---
I fail to see how INT is a priority stat over +heal or +SPI/mp5. Extra crit chance is negligible and highly RNG-based
---
Personally, I'd allow for a mage to roll NEED on INT gear, if it's an upgrade for them, over a Priest or Affliction/Demo Warlock.
---
It's a grey area much like with Rogues rolling NEED on +STR weapons while there are Arms Warriors also wanting those.
---
Are there any Add-ons working that collect up all of the minimal buttons in a frame (I used to use MBF, but it's not working for me.)
---
Yep, mornings are for STV questing. Evenings are for SM spam
---
Disagree.
---
It is not
---
Except mages have slowfall.
---
And cliffs/hills/trees exist in the game.
---
Most people are orc or warrior so this isn't always true
---
I never lost dps to a Hunter on my Rogue. Or maybe you are just a really good Hunter.;)
---
Jeeeez I guess it’s time to practice my stance dancing. Usually for me just Charge - Def Stance - Bloodlust - Tab Sunder spam has been my go-to. Hasn’t worked out too terrible, but then again I’m not even 40 yet so the highest level dungeon I’ve done is RFD or Cathedral.
---
You know it has very short spawn time right(if not instant)? The amount of loot you could acquire through this method would be ridiculous...
---
Deadhead checking in. I also noticed that scarlet begonia reference
---
Should stay as is. Kolkar locks are too complex for anyone to open without key.
---
I play Sulfuras and the census says it’s even plus you can tell out in the world that it’s pretty close. I think Ally are dominating the PvE scene right now but we’ll pay them back in kind  &gt;=]
---
China one isn't trustworthy though. Too much cheating on those servers.
---
Ive always wished taurens could be rogues.
---
If its red it's dead. I've been killed for no reason so I must kill for no reason.
---
I'm not sure. I can't remember what I used to use before ELVUI honestly. See if Postal exists for classic
---
Here’s my talents 
---
https://imgur.com/a/YRXkg2l
---
No no no. TAIWAN NUMBA ONE!
---
As long as we aren't struggling as a group, as the tank I will never wait for dps mana.  They can drink while we start the pull.
---
I'm sure Chinese one wasn't legit so gz wf.
---
I get that, most raiding guilds put emphasis on raiding though. Not saying I agree with it, but look at it from a Guild Leader/Raid Leader perspective.
---
I can trade part of one average raiding weapon for one/two good epics for raiding? Sign me up.
---
Goblin or gnomon engineering for a mage who cares about exclusively PvP?

Fair on the airline analogy. I still think it's dickish to pay for multiple seats on a crowded airline when you're just one person, and other people could potentially be making use of them, and I'm allowed to think that. In not alone in thinking so, either. Of course, in the end, it's on the airline to go "no, you can't do that" and enforce a one-seat-per-customer rule, at least on their most crowded flights. Of course, Blizzard being Blizzard, they're not going to do that, so I'm really just shouting into the void here, lol.
---
Bottom line: in my opinion, and I genuinely don't mean any offense here, you're playing the game in a way it's not designed to be played, and you're making things measurably worse for other players by doing so. We can go back and forth on the question of degree all day long, but you have to admit that multiboxers are exacerbating the queue problem to some extent.
---
No, it's a sailboat
---
If they keep queues I will stop playing.
---
Layering exploit doesn't wipe raid ID's, you are still locked to the same raid.  Layering to another MC would be no different then trying to go in someone else's instance when you are raid locked.
---
Also jealousy from a lock over here
---
"New rule" *laughs in veteran*
---
Is it really that hard to find groups as a rogue? I always make my own groups and i get whispered by rogues wayyyy more than other classes, which makes me think it takes insanely long for them to find a group. Honestly feel kinda bad that it seems nobody wants to play with them.
---
Yes it is...
---
Is your potion CD over? Does the shaman have a way to LoS?
---
Or when you want to inspect someone and then accidentally trade with him.
---
The logic goes like this
---
-phasing prevents you from playing with friends 
---
-classic doesn’t have phasing 
---
-retail adds feature after 11 years to let you AVOID phasing and play with friends
---
Basically yes ☺
---
Most dps specs in raids are 1 or 2 buttons, let's be honest. I've been top 5 dps on bosses by spamming frostbolt.
---
I have tanked DM, BFD, and Gnomer, arms spec, twohander for all but the a few hard hitting bossrs (looking at you, vc). Works great. Grabbed a pally last night to heal Gnomer out guild. He was like, I am prot specced, never healed. I was like, "hush. No words, only flash of light now." He did great. At the end, he was like, welp, guess I am holy spec now lol.
---
Go back to opening doors with your teeth and slamming them shut with your head
---
3 months is not fast at all. A very healthy portion of the active players should be 60 by then.
---
Can you just click open all in the mailbox?
---
And auctioneer does all that
---
I get that too, but only sometimes.  I suspect it has something to do with my latency?  Regardless,  “looting twice” is a really small cost to pay when it comes to making all that extra money/getting lockboxes to raise lockpicking skill
---
There are pictures of people being temp banned pending investigation
---
The other option is Illusionary Rod off of the Lib final boss, no spell power but lots of stam/int/spi
---
I love how its "new" bitch please people have gotten temp bans left and right for this for the last 14yrs at least ( pre flight )
---
I also have this problem, what I ended up doing is setting 3 totems per element on my additonal mouse buttons, with modifier. So for example stength of earth is mouse5, earthbind is mouse3 and tremor is mouse4, magma is shift+mouse4, searing is shift+mouse5, air totems are alt + buttons and water totems are ctrl + buttons. this let me have 12 totems withouth really moving my hands, the rest i don't use as much. I also try to rotate my mouse5 totems to be the totem i usually place in dungeons so when a fight starts i can mindlessly press mouse5, alt-mouse5, ctrl-mouse5, shift-mouse5
---
Similar to mages and mana I think.
---
This is wrong on so many levels. Tanks dont like to keep aggro so they can feel bigdoick about it, they like to keep aggro so that the healer wouldnt have to worry about others. Also focusing the skull is there to help the dungeon go smoother and easier, cause usually healers/heavy hitters get skulled. I dont know, maybe classic just isnt for you mate.
---
Ah ok, that's called the 'Assist' key.. Not focus.. which is why I was confused :)
---
AddOns can still call /who as long as it's done via a hardware action (press a key or click a button).  They didn't completely neuter it, just made it more difficult to use.  Sadly pretty sure most of the bad AddOns such as the invite and gold seller spam could easily be updated to work within these limitations (so could the census AddOn you would just have to click a button for every single /who request it does (hundreds if not thousands))
---
Sitting on the toilet right now while I read this. Can confirm, definitely smells like layering.
---
Now this is the content why Im subscribed for. Excelent job!
---
You can never hit full cap on fury dual wield. I believe the cap you are aiming for is 9%. You can however hit 2h fury cap quite easy also gives you a good reason to flip off shamans/ret paladins. :D
---
I've the tendrils of the Old Gods pulling me back in, but now I have a job and I can't stay up til 6am anymore or my body hates me.
---
I'm a filthy casual myself...unless it involves League of Legends or WoW battlegrounds, then I'm a weird casual/tryhard
---
I use Auctionator and Postal. Check those out. Both are simple and do what you want.
---
If they want to spam sinister strike all day and all night that's on them. Meanwhile I'll hit my ambush crits, gouge, backstab, eviscerate, oh and I pickpockected them. I'll still be going for 5% hit later on and I'll get bladeflurry at level 55.
---
Little late there chief.
---
Sure if someone or party leader says to need it, except that wasnt the case. If 5 greed its the exact same effect as 5 need so why not greed when 4 already greeded, and you have to consider the people who greeded greeded because others greeded. They all wanted it.
---
You're just defending ninjalooting.
---
I’m pretty sure elvui does that by default, but it’s a pretty bug ui overhaul so if you prefer a more classic look it may be too much of a change for you. check it out though!
---
dont listen tot his guy
---
Druids/shamans midfielders
---
Yes. Safespotting has never been allowed.
---
Do you really think it is the reason why they can't be pick locked? There are plenty of chests that can be in the other areas... it is only a matter of setting the respawn time :)
---
It is not BiS, at least for PvE
---
How should I level up as a warrior human ?  
---
I want to go full tank but during the leveling phase, I saw people saying that i should go arms and with a 2 handed weapon  
---
So I'm unsure how to proceed with that
---
&gt;BRE isn't nearly as good for Orcs
---
Isn't the proc for BRE insane for everyone? The weapon itself is totally mediocre but the proc is godlike. I remember when ArP started showing up on items and it rapidly became the best stat in the game for every class that could deal physical dmg.
---
Are you me? I got the same one as a warrior at level 43. Were you killing pirates in Tanaris?
---
Maces can't be used by Warlocks.
---
Twenty bucks says this guy doesn’t even wand when there is no damage going out. “I can’t DPS, I’m a top healer!”
---
Questing in STV will be a nightmare until most people are top level and only a fraction are leveling alts. 
---
So basically always, but it will eventually lessen, but that won't be for a while. It's a great place to go a couple levels after 30 for both factions, but it's got xp all the way until the early 40's. You will never have a smooth experience going through stv.
---
Just look at my numbers, any warlock that doesn’t use curse of agony is an idiot. Https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/character/us/incendius/dipsy
---
The WoW forums, WoWhead comments, basically every non-reddit WoW community I’ve ever seen outside WoW itself has been filled with incredibly unintelligent and very toxic people since day 1.
---
/assist the tank is stupid, they're always swapping targets
---
My bone fingers can unlock everything ;) 
---
That would be actually lit if undeads wouldn't need thieve's tools to pick lock ;)
---
One of my favorite things to do is help Horde in need when I can, idk what it is but helping that person survive when I could have finished them easily makes me feel pretty good. Plus it's always a lot of fun for me getting that /wave or /thank. Sure a few of the people I have saved turned right around and tried to kill me, But war is war and I should always be prepared.
---
I camped this vendor for a while and I kept getting attacked while another horde didn't. I couldn't think of any reason for me being specifically targeted. So it seems more likely that the other horde was being specifically excluded. No way for me to know.
---
Anyone trying to get these patterns inevitably spends a lot of time around there. I'd say most of the time there is no such cross-faction mafia action going on.
---
It's possible there is a server where a cross-faction partnership is better organized and more consistent.
---
Sounds like a lot of whining. People are chill in this game and you've got to find your crowd. Give it a few weeks for more to hit 60 and find normal people that aren't hardcore for a 15 year old game.
---
Imagine you finally get the key (or even two if you're lucky) only to wait for the chest to spawn... Plus compete with all the rogues waiting on for the chest to spawn plus all the other ppl with thier keys.. having a chest with insta spawn openable with item with a low drop rate makes sense to me.. but that's just me... :)
---
It is from core, original wow - just open your macros and type /autoattack 
---
And it'll pop up
---
Think it's from tbc/wrath
---
Fuck me, so this why my focus macro wasn't working. I just assumed I made an error with it and was going to fix it later.
---
I knew focus targets were in BC, just assumed it was in classic as well lol.
---
Praise be
---
It reminded me of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukznXQ3MgN0) lol
---
Ret is mana intensive in Pve, no paladin worth his salt will run himself oom against a warrior. Given equal skill and gear, it's not a winnable matchup for you, sorry. Keep trying, though!
---
We all know these idiot gamers nowadays, streamers mostly, exploit as much as possible. The new generation always try to find an advantage by playing not fair. It all started back in 2006 in Counter-Strike when the new generation found CS to be a highskilled gap game and cried every single day until they received CS:Source, which added tons of RNG elements instead of pure raw aiming with 100 percent accuracy and harder recoil control. After that they made CS:GO which added even more RNG elements to the game, to please the new generation so they have a chance vs the oldskoolers.
---
I enjoy the drama of open world PvP, when players band together to push back griefers. Just adds another layer of interesting situations on top of pve.
---
My man. Soloed too. Never again.
---
Thunderstomp is a Gorilla Pet Ability. Thunderstorm is a Shaman ability (which they only get a couple of expansions down the line). Thunder Clap is what you're looking for. 😁
---
Dude you will get it!!! I play tank and have been adding priests and dps that work well with me. All through out my leveling as SOON as I get on they’re whispering me hey man! Need a tank for X can you join us? 
---
I will tell you that I do the exact same for good healers and dps that wait 1-2 seconds for me to shield block + revenged.
---
Is the Tiny Crimson Whelpling rare?
---
Thanks! I didn't realize they were broken in such a way. I loved the long, nearly-unwinnable siege war. It felt so epic and true to the fantasy of WoW/Alterac Valley. But I also know that a lot of players/classes rely on rep items, whereas I was mostly playing it for fun. I also know that you didn't gain any honor for being in the battle if you weren't there when it ended (e.g. played it for six hours and had to leave before the end), only honor for the HKs you got fighting. That's a problem. I'd love to see the huge siege come back, or at least a different BG with a similar concept/gameplay that fixed the rep and honor problems. Probably the most fun I've ever had in PvP, other than my 39 mage in AB.

Go on a PVE sever you pleb carebear. Stop ruining the game for everyone else.
---
I love when people find creative ways wreak havoc upon me.
---
Bandages are great at 60 to save mana on mend pet, PLUS it doesn't interrupt spirit based regen.
---
Just bite the bullet and invest in water every time you go to town,  if you are actively using seals and judgement then you won’t be out of the 5 second rule enough for spirit to matter and int doesn’t help with regen.
---
Use Flametongue  or WF on your weapon. Hit them with flame shock and then keep using your highest level shock, or use Earth Shock rank 4 for the best mana efficiency. If you gaining close to surpassing the tank threat, then you can switch to frost shock to still maintain damage, just not draw that much threat. It works for me.
---
And to be able to ring the gong, you must complete a whole chain of quests. The kind of quests that the whole guild must participants in by giving ressources. So yeah, one mayyyybe two players chosen by the guild.
---
Well it's not, the stun is way better in practice and the firebolt proc compensate the lack of extra attack.
---
In pvp you get kitted a fuckton by close to everyone, the stun just helps you so much. It's less flashy but much more reliable than an extra attack.
---
Each level takes more and more xp, so what you are experiencing is normal. In classic, I think the halfway mark to reach lvl 60 xp/time wise is around lvl 44.
---
Looks great did that to my totems this morning. Only prob is that mana spring is annoying me. Its in the middle of all the fire totems...
---
I tried this but every time a ?? Ally would pounce on me immediately. Next time I'm on at non primetime hours I'm sure this will work though.
---
These are awesome. I love the art style and the feeling! Keep em up man!
---
All the whelplings are rare. They have a very low drop rate.
---
No lmao. Who told you this bullshit lol. Against prot you just hit em with r1 SoC and win after half an hour lol
---
I shield my tank every time...
---
But I'm a level 11 in RFC, just dos them down please I don't have mana! Have mercy!
---
&amp; 600 PR squats probably
---
Uldaman sucks. I have several quests that neither I nor the two groups I've finished the dungeon with know how to complete. The quests lack crucial information. Having to look up how to finish quests, when that info should be peovided by the game itself, is pretty lame.
---
In a thread about AFK timers you say that? Weird
---
I can't be the only person that read this as "X Rated"...
---
I don’t think it’s linked to loyalty, just keep going till it pops up on his spells. I’ve tamed pets that had them straight away and others that have taken 10 mins or so of questing
---
I just eventually tell them that if they can't wait for 1 freaking Maul then I just assume they want to tank and let them have it.
---
Excluding weight of his armor
---
There's a difference between peeling adds off of a tank under pressure and pulling a whole room by yourself. What you're doing seems mostly fine because you understand how to minimize downtime during a run. A LOT of people who feel the need to surpass threat meters do it for stupid reasons like seeing their name at the top of the charts or wanting to control the pace of the run instead of the tank.
---
tech brew?
---
yep it's not a big deal ranged classes can kite and melee classes can tank some mobs.  my god we're playing a game where warriors are tanking as arms with 2 handers and these kids are putting on their  shield and putting some points into prot and crying on reddit every time a dps pulls agro because it detracts from their worth.
---
it's always the shield users crying the dudes bigdicking it in 2 handers don't care
---
Not sure how I feel about this.
---
Yeah I'm playing rogue and these macros are so fuckin nice. Insta pull out my dagger to ambush and right when I hit I got my slow weapon in my main hand instantly to hit high dps ss's
---
Pretty funny, gj
---
As a tank myself I'll say this, Mages are divas. I straight up dread have a mage in my dungeon group because 70% of the time they leave the group because we're not going fast enough.       
---
Mage: "This group is going to slow I'm going to leave."     
---
Me, who's already chain pulling and only stopping when the healer's mana runs out.: "I can pull more if you want."     
---
Mage: "Ok."     
---
Me: I wait for everyone to be at full mana and this time I pull a second pack because the mage demands it. Mage instantly starts AOEing the moment I'm near the first pack so by the time I get to the second nothing is grouped up. pop challenging shout. Notice that no one is focusing healing mobs so they keep healing. See all mobs are still at 60% health and we haven't killed anything. I look at my party frames and see the mage is oom because he doesn't have the dps to kill two packs like he thought, healer now goes oom. we wipe.      
---
[The mage's reaction.](https://i.imgur.com/mkwyyJA.jpg)
---
On your way to 60, you're gonna have like 6+ days of /played at LEAST. Picking something good for newbies is good and all, but pick something you like or seems fun at endgame. Or go around leveling up a whole bunch of characters until one sticks.
---
If you're still worried about being a burden or something, pick mage or warlock. They both support the party out of combat while still doing good dps, and being casters they aren't hindered too badly by not having good gear.
---
Blizz already clarified that the layer changing addons are bullshit and made up
---
I don’t understand how this works. 99 to 99 and how is decided who get a item?
---
Funny to me how while tanking im consistently top or in second place, despit half my rage going into non-damaging abilities.
---
Even regularly seen dps fall below healer damage, while being critical of me being low damage on a particukar pull where i spent even more rage managing threat.
---
Hey dps, your dps is low on meters, learn to do your fucking jobs.
---
They all left us lowbies
---
your first mistake was assuming im speaking english. im not. im speaking my own custom language i made up myself. all the words originated from english, but some of them have been modified after the fact. i am the only admin of this language and i can change the definitions at will even retroactively if i want to
---
and in my language, for all intensive purposes is not wrong. and as of right now, i just made "intents and purposes" an illegal phrase. anybody who says it instantly get banned. so watch out
---
and why did you say "have a nice day"? thats such a weird thing to say in this situation
---
It definitely wasn’t.  You would always be defaulted to the last server you played on.
---
That's a normal to tiny bit slow.
---
They could sell that gold and probably make more than minimum wage.
---
The earlier, the better the warrior
---
Oh I see! Even better then. :)
---
Agreed, healer should be the last to die if its a wipe. Also, pulling mobs off the healer might get you some special consideration as DPS if two DPS need healing :D
---
Some tanks only swap targets just enough to keep aggro off of the main healer. But some DPS will focus on whatever they fancy and make the tank's job more difficult. OP already given you a plausible scenario of how it can happen.
---
there's a difference between silk bags and black lotus...

Might have tamed one of the Bloodaxe Worg Pup's in Halycon's room? Same model.
---
This. It takes a lot longer to run back to the instance multiple times in classic vs. taking a whole entire 30sec to mana up for the next fight.
---
This subreddit is pathetic.
---
You could heal maraudon. Jump in princess runs group. Full clear is good so as well.
---
Could have used this last night. Thanks for posting
---
Yeah, as a rogue I have noticed this. I'll intentionally wait 2 or 3 seconds before garotting, but watching dps warriors charge the back mob and then whirlwind the second the tank engages makes me wonder why I bother
---
I don't remember this being a thing in vanilla. I would fish on my shaman to avoid pvp because I could water walk way out and make it a pain. I thought I would ghost wolf way out into tanaris waters to fish. Maybe I'm remembering wrong
---
Pretty cool, but still not a huge fan of combat lol
---
You fucking lot belched "\#No ChAnGEz" whenever the notion came up of adding shit like this, and now you're getting mad because you can get banned for something that was also bannable in vanilla? Get real dude.
---
Clearly a schooner...
---
Yes, increased spell damage gear will increase the amount of damage your spells do and that will make your vamp embrace return slightly more (but no, it won’t also double dip by increasing your vamp healing directly)
---
+shadow, and +spell damage are one of a shadow priests best stats, just make sure to balance that with enough spirit so that you don’t have to drink too often
---
feign death still gets me when im on auto pilot and forget we have a hubter. 
---
“Damn he got fucking slapped what happe—oh.”
---
Don't feel bad.  He opened the can of worms, you just dumped it all over him.  It was stupid of him, after you effectively tracked him and killed him a few times, to keep at it.  When you're getting camped, just log off and play an alt until your camper goes away.
---
Then it's not part of "the" vanilla experience, just your experience
---
IDK but that might be possible. I'm questionning everything right now 🤔
---
Which is why I'm not playing another Hunter :D
---
You sound like a huge sick. Also assuming someone works 60 hours a week is lol.
---
Definitely the flying I forgot how large one zone was till I had to run from one side of the barrens all the way to zoram strand cause I didn’t have the flight path.
---
This guy gnomers.
---
I can't tell if you're joking or not, but I'll assume that you are and that I missed it haha.
---
God that sucks. It's not my fault they can't put proper pathing on their guards. What an awful way to do game design. The game itself should present it's rules quiet clearly, there shouldn't be any need for a GM to create artificial rulings.
---
Take it in friend
---
Incendius for the win :D
---
This. Esfand reset wasn't a layer bug. It was another know bug not related to layer.
---
I just spoke to my old guild mates and they had the same thing as I did.  
---
Not reason to start hating If your experience differs.
---
That's a touching story, but also a bit sad really. You should want dps to do those things you listed *while also doing their primary role of outputting as much damage as they can*. It's not that it's a race, it's that it's their job. They're literal role. 
---
I understand players will all want to go at different paces, but we shouldn't be trying to sell the lie that its OK to dps to be low (and lets be clear, your 1h+shield enh friend had to be doing absolutely abysmal numbers) as long as you interrupt/cc/don't pull agro/whatever. You're making average-to-poor players worse when you encourage that.
---
Constructive criticisms and assistance should be given where an issue is present. Mage going IMMEDIATELY into a shatter combo + AE spam the moment the pack has been positioned? Coaching opportunity. Tank failing to hold agro against even the healer in AoE packs? Absolutely a coaching opportunity. Enhancement shaman using a 1h+shield? You bet your ass that's a coaching opportunity.
---
I did this the first few days on Pagle, but stopped lol.
---
Thank you mate :D
---
Reeks of Activision.  Fuck shareholders.
---
firemaw is  Horde 55/45 alliance
---
I don't think that Classic is reliant on single target dps unless your grp is composed of strictly single target dps. Mages, warlocks and even warriors do very good aoe damage and to be able to hold threat for those AOE packs, I would typically be able to tab through and sunder/revenge. Sunder is garbage on this client so I have to use higher dps to maintain threat.
---
 If I were prot I would have the bonus threat from talents but I'm tanking as fury so 2h or DW it is or Im just gonna be chasing mobs. I could say hey give me like 3-4 globals for threat before going ham with the AOE's but that would cause slower kill times than using the 2h/DW and letting them go balls deep.. So long as my healer can keep up with the extra damage im taking, it seems better IMO.
---
Yeah I'm tanking in classic and tanked in vanilla and wish I knew I could use a 2h back then its much easier than marking stuff and using CC. I just put up a skull on a caster and ignore it and build threat on the rest. Rarely any issues.
---
They average out the same, but RB has a slight advantage due to it being consistent damage. While WF  can sometimes not pop during a fight or just overkill the target.
---
Shadowmeld is perhaps the worst racial in the game, but atleast I get to kill my challenged damage dealers and survive if they decide to pull when the healer is oom.
---
He has the current best weapon in the game and shoulders that are barely acceptable to be doing the content required to get the weapon.
---
I just spoke to 500 people from my old server and they had the same thing as I did
---
Did you mean 10-60.
---
1-10 I'd rather be a priest.
---
This has also been my experience. I mark skull, X and Moon with a mage in the grp. Moon dies first?
---

I'm sure you did, buddy. Here, has a cookie.
---
I've done Sunken Temple.  BRD is probably going to require a shield, but I haven't been there yet.

Dude this was happening in 2005. Blizzard are wrong to ban someone for this.

Laughs in Dwarvish Pally!
---
Ask Mankrik's wife...
---
Oh sweet! Thanks a milli!
---
don't forget you have a 40yrd rez range, so you can move at least 40yrds closer to safety on each death.
---
hahahahaha I’ve killed more horde than I can count in there
---
No, I didnt you dumbfuck.
---
I feel you 100%.. just dm'ed you :)
---
No doubt. I've started saying Tank LFG normal run" sick of this AOE shit honestly
---
Holy hell! Thank you!! Thank you so much. I've done this before in Darkshire, didn't realize it was against TOS. I will inform my guild as well
---
It's obvious it's my opinion, but well to be more in depth : I did grind BGs up to R14 on a pserv and played a shit ton of them for severals years and my experience is that it was way more reliable to play with sulfuras than any other weapon I got. 
---
Sword spec is nice and if you prefere that and it looks cool to double proc well so be it, but the extra CC is realy nice for a warrior, and if you want extra attack proc HOJ is still an option
---
Well for the DR it's close to never the case in practice actually, I played as well in teams as solo and never got this problem
---
Ha now you're just lying.  But it's okay.
---
It's not even a world first. An asian guild got it days ago.
---
You can use other race mounts within your faction when you're exalted with their capital city, the easiest way doing this is turning in Rune cloth to a npc

IRL Friend of a friend.  So not an amazing source really.  6 month suspension.

I think aside from the specialization quest you get to max level the same

---
I am VERY happy that I leveled fast enough ahead of the curve to dodge the proverbial bullet here of farming Broken Tooth. I got him like, 4th or 5th day of classic.
---
Tanking without a shield will be really hard on your healer.  As a tank you want to be easy to keep alive, and wearing a shield is usually part of that.  Sometimes you see 2H tanking but usually it's in a group of people who have built out their specs for it together.  If you're pugging groups though, as a tank - at least have a sheild and a 1h that you can use at all times.
---
You’re just being a devilish rogue rather than a dastardly rogue, is all.
---
You didn’t even name the worst Shadow Priest sin. Instant mind blast the second you pull.
---
Weeeeeew.  Just tanked my first deadmines.  Cleef handed my ass to me on a silver platter.  Keeping aggro in there is HARD.  Running a level 18 warrior, and, how the hell do I deal with keeping aggro on so many targets?  I tab and sunder, but I run out of rage so fast.  Seems the entire party kept getting aggro.  I'd taunt, sunder, shield block, revenge, but it just seemed like I was running out of rage when I most needed it.  Got through all bosses cept Van Cleef, but I feel like my first time tanking was the groups worst experience with a tank.  They were nice about it, till Cleef wiped us, then they salty and dropped the group.   How do you deal with his second stage, with the 4 adds?  We tried sheeping, but the spike dps was just ridiculous.
---
*im wrong, but I’m not going to admit it*
---
Great, Blizzard ruined wow again. Shut er down boys.

---
I havnt really had many issues. Are you also using a wand on low health targets?
---
I don't mind locks who lifetap, it's the one(s) who lifetap to 5% mid fight then immediately tap back down to 5% after a heal.  This one lock presumably was annoyed that the tank was getting priority heals and ditched the group.
---
This resonates with me more than you know.
---
My wife of 6 years left me, is taking most of my income, and sleeping with other men. Wow keeps me sane and let's me start to rebuild my life.

The person I'm replying to isn't talking about the efficiency in making the bandages, they are talking about the profit you make per silk.
---
It will always be useful for your twink/alts but you won't build anything super strong without raiding. Armor or weapons depends on your goals...  Tank go armor and dd go weapon not that hard after all ;-)
---
I'm not saying that they should remove the key, I'm saying that as other chests there should be an option to pick lock them.
---
I'm glad mate :)
---
It's like asmongold said: dodge - &gt; overpower - &gt; miss, is exactly why warriors are fueled with rage.
---
I actually think we pretty much agree on the subject in the end.
---
Sure, multiboxers add to the que in the exact amount of accounts they have. Do I think it would be better if 5 individual players got those slots? Sure, in the sense that 5 different people get to play instead of one. That being said, I would rather have the solution from Blizzard's end to the existance and length of the que rather than having an end consumer have to self-police their actions based on the amount of other people playing. That just doesn't seem feasible or even really fair either.
---
All and call, good talk, I think we found a good deal of common ground here.
---
Honestly layering does suck for the most part, but the fact we can play almost every zone during peak times without any lag (on my server at least) is great so I'll take the good with the bad
---
congrats chief, from a fellow alliance rogue on incendius I hope we gank kids together some day
---
Couple days late to the world first race but I guess you can just say whatever you want on the internet.
---
Yeah well my parses are higher than theirs so now what?
---
So long as you know about how it interacts with aggro that's fine.
---
Weapon wise you want a slow swing speed. All of your enhancement buffs should give the same DPS, but due to an oddity (but not a bug) in the way windfury is coded it can proc itself. Because of that hitting harder per swing is better.
---
There’s no chance they have it. Arcanite bars take days to create and you need 50
---
Just play whatever Race/Class/Faction/Gender you want, technically there are slight stat boosts for race/class combos but from my experience, skill and gear matter much more.
---
My recommendation is Human mage, nice leveling zones, mages are pretty easy to learn but can do a lot of damage and most importantly you won't be a gnome.
---
I love their tabard.
---
that doesn't happen
---
I don't know man, I've been thinking "if they are over 50% hp it's fine" for years while most people think they need to be at 100% or they are in danger of instantly dieing.
---
Okay cool. I was just getting irked at essentially autoattcking with a 2h with a shock every 6 seconds. 
---
Do you do 1h and shield or staff? 
---
Also, any good leveling ele builds you recommend?
---
Can’t wait to prowl stv with you!
---
There are no 100k pop servers. The fullest servers at max layers were like ~15k

They look exactly the same

Oh god, gotta hope you’re in a major city to log out immediately for no less than 1 hour.

Ok, this is fantastic.

Alternatively, if you're on windows and only want a portion of the screen captured use WIN + SHIFT + S

Also nice to have prep so u can reset vanish CD when a mob resists ur PP

it can take some time

---
What do role players usually do in WoW? I’ve always wondered
---
Do you even understand what layering is? They are in a raid...
---
Interestingly, the zone performance when ran by Blizzard is worse than it is even on private servers. World PvP is going to be a disaster if they don’t fix it. Private servers could handle 100v100 and blizzard servers slow to a crawl with 50.
---
If you go regular pvp/pve go herbalism and skinning. Save all the herbs. Replace skinning with alchemy once you want to go into thistle tea and free action potions.
---
If you want to go hardcore pvp go mining and skinning. Save all the ore. Replace skinning with engineering once you can make the pvp trinkets you want.
---
Vendor all your skins for cash.
---
well, i'll see
---
Would it be a bad idea to go to Hyjal in classic? I was hoping to make the trip one day always wanted to go there
---
Short answer: Nah
---
You can only have one travel buff at a time, applying an extra deletes the previous.
---
You also can't use water walking while mounted, nor use it on someone who's mounted.
---
True, but still a dick move to take it over a caster. We have other options, they do not. 
---
Could you use it? Sure, but be a decent person and let casters have first crack at it.
---
Save mats for a while and drop mining. Pick up mining on an alt.
---
Well they're trade-able and I'm sure there is AT LEAST 51 alchemists on any given server.
---
that's got nothing to do with layering
---
Idgi.
---
Strat live!
---
Freezing traps are reflected. I can find it in one of Grim's PvP videos if you don't believe me.
---
It was a thing in early vanilla, but it was fixed so that you could only have 1 movement buff in late vanilla.
---
Lockpicking skill is QoL ability, not a way to bypass the grind and loot valuables with zero effort.
---
My rage comes from 2h “tanks” and life tapping warlocks without water ~Priest
---
It's enh not ench. Your talent tree is not called enchancement.
---
&gt;Every thread where hardcore players post themselves in high-end loot, world firsts, etc, it's "layer exploit".
---
Because these people who say that world's are falling apart. They have been circlejerking for years on the internet about the good old days about how "hard" vanilla was. And then the see it with their own eyes but they are so heavy in the circlejerk so they lie to themselves to protect their ego and dellusions.
---
Yeah, if it were just racials this would've made it a very simple choice.
---
To unlock tribal leather working I need to craft turtle scale and wild leather armor. Would of been nice to level up my skill while crafting them.  
---
Instead I have to go through the grind of acquiring the mats knowing that I won't gain skill points
---
Not the Ckeeksslapper? The other cheeks?
---
From what I understand, agility increases your wand crit chance. Also anything that makes an enemy take more elemental damage will cause a wand of the corresponding type to deal more damage.
---
Pretty strange that a searing gorge quest screws with a lvl 30 quest in org/bb
---
Thanks for the reply, i'll go fury warrior with 2 handed weapons for solo and i'll keep a sword/mace + shield for the dungeon part
---
I wonder if that's their "legendary weapon crew" - same group will have Atiesh, Thunderfury and another Hand of Rag(?) by the time all the content phases are out?
---
Also if u want to run cath/atm and dont have the key, die in lib or gy, and run through the locked doors. Bam
---
For PvP. Fury warriors are beast PvE damage and completely useless in PvP haha.
---
You don't remember quest helper for vanilla? Everyone had that shit, and it was better than what questie is now. Lol
---
I've been playing as a Gnome Mage, sort of following a leveling guide that suggested going Fire until level 22 when you can get improved Blizzard, then switching to Frost for AOE leveling. I just hit 22, and now I'm not sure if I want to make the switch or not. AOE does sound like fun, and is probably faster, but I like the power of being a single target Fire Mage and DPSing enemies down super quickly. Does anyone have suggestions about which has been more fun to play? I wish I could try out the Frost build without paying the 1G to respec and then possibly paying to respect back to Fire again if I don't like it.
---
I wish I didnt have a job I'm jealous
---
Fair enough
---
Nice
---
You are right when you say that only Warriors are hard-countered by Mages. But you still have the tools to beat really anyone in a duel. Warlocks, Druids, Shamans, and SPriests are your weakness, but you can still beat them with finesse and resets. Rogues fights are a player's matchup imo, depends on player skill and fairly even matchup 1v1 with all CDs. You have the advantage against Paladins and Hunters in a duel, but I wouldnt say it's a straight up counter... and in a anything but a 1v1 duel they can be a problem for you.
---
just make it a macro combined with either blink or frost nova, or any spell you’ll mash over and over out of desperation until it’s off cooldown.
---
CHAMPION! Good job venturing into the very heart of our world’s mortal enemies, the Burning Legion, and dismantling their grip on the very titans that forged our planet into what it is today.
---
...But that pesky [enemy faction] is up to no good again and gosh darn we just wish we had some way of defeating them.
---
It’s a comedy show in which I actually laugh out loud

He can’t waste his precious combo points on overkill!

No and tbh what this rogue is doing isnt exploiting either.

Staying out of range isnt the problem -- its staying where they cannot possibly reach you if they aggro that they are discussing

Just asking people unsolicited out of the blue is kind of aggressive in my book. same thing as a telemarketer. :P
---
Of course. But when AoEing I obtenu have to crack a gem or potion to finish the pack. I might be doing something wrong I don't know.
---
I'd go Goblin for PVP. You can use the PVP stuff Gnomish Engineers make, you'll just have to buy it or find someone to craft it for you. It's way more tedious for a Gnomish Engineer to keep himself supplied with Goblin created Bombs because you need to restock them so often. 
---
There is another option. You can go Gnomish and use it to create all the items you want and then switch to Goblin. This is the only way a Goblin Engineer can get some of the BOP Gnomish items llike the Death Ray and Battle chicken.
---
I was not serious XD
---
Yeah well leveling I guess. But I hit 60 3 weeks ago. Tanks are pretty important for pre bis and mc/ony.
---
There are skills that do neutral damage (Druid thorns, shamen totems for example). You can stay ungrouped and use just thoes skills for 0 xp loss.

6 months? What are you talking about?

Sorry for the delay, here is a picture of the UI I'm using while leveling. Lots of refining to be done but I guess the idea shows. 
---
I think ThreatMeters just overall work really poorly in Classic since the API doesn't report threat.
---
Under lvl 10 you dont get res sickness
---
Again, I never said they couldn’t, just that I wouldn’t put their need above mine.
---
You're so edgy, my dude.
---
36 shaman, 30 druid, 29 warrior. Help!
---
“It’s 20ap bro, it’s my preraid bis”
---
Horde has tranquil air totem which does the same thing as the pally threat buff. Granted it's a little more restrictive because it only works in the shaman's group, but if you put the shaman in a group with all warlocks it does great.
---
This guide while overall good ,doesn't mention when to craft armor needed for specialization quests while leveling and it's description of elemental and tribal is wrong
---
Caution: the following is my opinion
---
Blacksmithing is the worst profession.
---
My first character was  tauren warrior.  I took up blacksmithing and mining - because it seemed like the thing to do.  After all my time playing this game, I now think that blacksmithing is on the bottom tier of professions.  There are uses for it, but if you're not going to be hardcore raiding and soaking up raid drop patterns, another profession will be far more usefull.    
---
Quit BS before you dedicate too many resources to leveling it, and follow your dreams as either an engineer (actually makes unique and useful items) or an alchemist/herbalist.   There are a couple things that blacksmiths can make to sell, but not nearly as many as alchemists.  Alchemy is just a more usefull profession all around, you will not regret being an alchemist.
---
&gt;bloodlust, thunderclap
---
&gt;no whirlwind
---
I found your problem. you're tanking with a shield and not a 2h so your aoe threat sucks ass, and you're wasting threat on single target damage moves like bloodlust and thundercrap.
---
respec arms, charge, bloodrage,(autoattack), sweeping strikes, zerker stance, zerker rage, (autoattack), whirlwind, and then bam you have a solid enough threat base (and sick dps) on 4 or so mobs. from there you can demo shout, cleave if you have extra rage, but bank enough to be able to hit whirlwind on cooldown. if there's a single tanky mob like a boss, sunder that fucker to 5 stacks then single target dps it.
---
Technically you did get hits on them. Just not crits.
---
Which is worse, because you're pretty useless without a pet that can hold some threat. Got Broken Tooth last night and I'm 52, not looking forward to it at all.
---
As a hunter this is so frustrating. You mean to tell me, there are no arrows or meat in this town?!?
---
I upgraded my whole system except hard drive and I have that damn message now. 
---
I wasn’t smart enough to register an account with Microsoft before the upgrade.
---
Nah, just all the other druids
---
Yeah let em die. I think after enough of their gear breaks they'll get the picture.
---
Level 42 on my warrior. Never thought I’d make it that far on a warrior as I mained paladin I’m burning crusade and was going to play that again.
---
You do understand on some of the higher population realms there are dozens of groups clearing MC or at least 8/10, right?
---
Sure, the first week there probably weren't more than 1-2 clears, the second there were probably about 10, but by the 3rd week tons of guilds and pugs are doing Molten Core. I did MC last week in a complete pug and we did 8/10 -  Molten Core isn't hard. 
---
It wouldn't be that far fetched to see other guilds sell or loan out their Ingots to help someone make the hammer knowing they will either get paid immediately or paid back in the future if it is going to a trusted guild on the server.
---
In Vanilla I had every Alliance class at 60 except my hunter, which only made it to 57 when TBC dropped. I played since day 1 and spent 4-6 hours a day in the game.
---
I saw one world drop epic that whole time, a Warden Staff on my druid at level 47 off a roc in Tanaris.
---
I’m leveling as an Enhancement shaman, I’ve been able to heal as enhance for most dungeons I’ve been in.  Is there a cutoff point where heals as enhance just won’t cut it?
---
Nobody is talking about "challenge."
---
The reason classic is just **better** is because of SUBSTANCE.
---
It's an RPG ffs, the game is supposed to be an *adventure*, but it hasn't been "adventurous" for a very long time.
---
Gratz now do onto the horde as they did to us!
---
FOR THE ALLIANCE!
---
Why does staff of Jordan have SP on it? Don’t remember that from classic at all.
---
Wish they could make new retail zones feel more like classic zones, I really do,
---
This pandering to the lowest common denominator is what killed the game for I and many others. I would like to enjoy this game before the carebears ruin it for everyone. Is that to much to ask for?
---
... Okay, you actually are unable to comprehend what I am saying.
---
Blizzard believing it should be punishable doesn't change the fact that it makes zero sense.
---
I'm not sure...I was definitely fully prepared to have to re level 2 hand axes and maces. But it gave me my skill level back lol
---
This dont work. Xp loss. Gotta use neutral damage spells. Thorns shamen totems
---
The retail kids are not going to listen.
---
There’s also the hidden path just north of sunrock that alliance can use. If you keep running past the turn off for Sunrock and keep an eye up left you’ll see a slightly lighter path run up the mountain.
---
Unplayable
---
Oh I have a few people on my list on incendius who I am going to hunt relentlessly
---
You know combat rogues can pick pocket right?
---
It must have been searing pain since immolate shouldn't really generate that much aggro.
---
Lmao.
---
You didn't know you could layer exploit dungeons and raids?
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/fix-for-repeat-instance-bug-exploit/300823
---
what a waste putting in a Warriors hands.
---
i've played horde my whole life till classic, where i rolled alliance. guess what? i see that from horde just as much as i did from alliance. if you honestly buy into the us vs. them faction mentality you're delusional.
---
It’s 100% exploiting in my opinion, the game was obviously not meant to have that “no aggro spot” in winter spring tavern or w/e the building is. You can’t exactly fight back otherwise guards wills steam roll you instead of the person in that spot, the only way to fight is running over to that spot and you can’t attack him until you get to that exact spot.
---
Only in sm. If you try that in zf brd or lbrs you'll die.
---
Ran into the rare bear hunters can tame yesterday Big Samras is it called ? Killed it pretty quick before realising as I was watching csgo at the same time as farming whoops.
---
I'll concede that there are more primarily Horde zones on Kalimdor, sure, but I still don't think Feralas is one of them. In fact, according to [this website](https://classicdb.ch/?zone=357#quests:0+4+1+2), there are more Alliance only quests than Horde only. In my time questing, I visited mostly every zone for at least a few quests, and definitely all level 40+ ones. I had to take the quest experience where I could get it.
---
I think once you get past about level 25ish, every zone is considered "contested" by the game and I agree with that assessment, aside from maybe the west side of Thousand Needles and most of Stonetalon Mountains. Those 2 seem pretty Horde dominated, even with the "contested" tag.
---
Regardless, running into the opposite faction is expected once you get out of the starting zones, and honestly, I believe that interaction is what makes the game feel alive and dangerous. Getting rolled up on by a group doesn't feel fair, but it sure makes it exciting when you're able to take 1 or 2 with you.
---
Been farming SM GY, has ppl giving me shit for not holding aggro, when they all focus different mobs, and the mage AoEs everything. Legit I think it’s impossible for me to be able to hold aggro on three packs, with dps going ham.
---
Metzen's work is honestly just one or two notches above amature.  Its harsh and gothic because he never did anything beyond pencil and paper.
---
Time to get that W, boys!
---
How am I ruining the game?
---
I am so, so sorry.

Ally did this to me earlier.. Somehow the guards attackee me after i placed down a grounding totem and started healing myself
---
did they sleep
---
Just like you not being able to get under orgimmar? Or up to the iron forge airport? We could argue since you have to jump glitch your way there on the terrain its a place they intended people to be able to go!
---
Or we can call a shovel a shovel and realize especially with this ruling blizzard didnt intend for players to be able to do it and this is easier than redesigning the buildings, QA(lol like they do that anyways), patch in, and pay for those extra man hours. They instead said dont go there and if you do it enough you get banned which is a 100% clear answer with no room for opinion.
---
You are so stupid it’s amazing you made it this far in life.
---
Thank you OP.
---
As a rogue you are the person least worried about pulling aggro in dungeons. I do it all the time and it really doesn't matter, I'll tell the tank to just ignore skull and tank the rest. With naturally high dodge, evasion, stuns, and a plethora of interrupts you take a lot less dmg when you pull aggro than any other class, and you're already next to the tank so it's not like he has to chase anything down.
---
Nice mana.
---
If you've ever been in a cleave group it's not reasonable for a tank to always hold all the aggro and I was always fine mana wise when I ran dungeons with my mage friends and when my friend was running dungeons on his healer and I was dpsing. You can kite minions with frost nova and ice block  toward the tank so that you can still AoE the clump as a dps and when i was healer and got aggro, I would just run toward the tank and a mage would blink and nova on top of the tank and reposition again so the healer isn't getting pushback. 
---
The game isn't hard even if you don't play a linear way and if you all play together and communicate it's more fun than playing linearly 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
---
Grats incendius ftw
---
I think this is an issue with the community though. I think you can maintain the integrity of Classic WoW for what it is and still introduce certain fixes into the game. If they added invisible walls to certain areas, the game would still feel like Classic WoW. 
---
If something like an invisible wall built purely so the devs don't have to put in some arbitrary rule to stop greifing triggers someone because #nochange, then that person  is really hurting the community.
---
I still think about this quite a bit
---
I REMEMBER THIS.
---
Many 1 tank 2 heal 2 AOE DPS
---
or 2 tank 1 heal 2 AOE DPS
---
or 1 Tank 1 heal 2 AOE DPS 1 Feral druid (offtank if necessary)
---

---
Had a guild talk to me for hours trying to recruit me so I said f it I’ll apply. Got denied yesterday lol the best part is after I applied they told me about all the benefits. I would get priority on loot and they would help me farm for the priest staff. I actually laugh out loud when I got the discord message saying they couldn’t accept my application and status my that they had to many people already. Meh I’m a leader in my current guild and all though small I know that one day we can save the world.
---
Same. Although most healers seem to take this as a challenge and decide to overheal me for more than they are actually healing me throughout the run. I also always have loads of water and food and am using them after combat, so there's not really a need for a healer to delay his drinking to top be up after combat. 
---
I have noticed though that the really good healers tend to actually heal me a good amount while still managing their mana to minimize mana breaks.
---
By existing.
---
I am trying to get the Wolf (exalted with OG) as an undead. Have not got to runecloth drops yet, why are they better to donate then wool etc?
---
And congratulation on reaching your goal!
---
save them for future eye drops?
---
Wrong.  Some of those rooftops are incredibly easy, routine jumps.  You were definitely meant to be able to get on them
---
TIL i could have been banned from this game numerous time
---
There was a 60 priest on the Gadget inn yesterday on my server trying to kill people walking out.  Nearly got me
---
Can you share your battlenet username so I can block you?
---
Is 10,000 or 500 stacks an accurate representation of how many runecloths it took to hit exalted?
---
I think it's very reasonable to farm that much gold if that is your only goal. I hit 60 2.5 weeks ago, about 17 days ago. Assuming that he hit 60 around the same time or possibly even earlier, he would have 18 days to gather 5k gold. That is just over 300g a day. Early on, most farm spots are pretty lucrative. There was a time when essences were 20g a pop and you could reasonably farm 4 an hour. 250-400g a day is not that bad. Even taking a very average return of 40g an hour(you can get this in currency/Grey items and never visit the AH). He will still make that with 10+ hours a day.
---
Guards were weak. Ganks happened in those cities all the time, whether via safespotting or not. I remember hunters and rogues ganking constantly bc of feign death and vanish. Even mages could gank in booty bay if they swam/blinked away.
---
This is wonderfully spooky. I'm sure there are dozens of skeletons hiding in this picture, but respect for keeping them hidden to circumvent the spook level. Please consider posting this and any other cool screenshots on r/classicwowscreenshots as well. We don't have any spooky ones yet.
---
When it happens I'm flattered, personally
---
just ask a mage to make you 1454 stacks of water and go quest. hinterlands/feralas/azshara/felwood/searing gorge/stv all have quite some quests for your level range.
---
If you have Mirah's Song, I'd recommend having that in your OH until you get the full Dal's set (if you do, that is. MH is a bitch to find).
---
This ! I don't tank much as I'd rather dps as a warrior il eventually just pvp, but tried tanking RFK the other day but before i even charge and get aggro the mage and hunter just kept tagging everything causing me to have to run round chasing them to get the mob back.... we wiped twice.
---
One of the retail complaints is specifically that gear 20 ilvls lower is better sometimes even though Blizzard said they'd avoid that, bit confused here friend.
---
This is true, and if your group is reasonable you won’t run out of mana. 
---
However, this isn’t possible when your tank is consistently pulling 6 mobs at a time and you constantly have to drop your biggest heal for them not to die.
---
Are we friends now?
---
Man, a huge part of this game’s draw is that neither faction are good or bad guys. Blizzard never actually said the Alliance are bad guys, there’s little indicator that you’re playing the bad guys when you actually do the Alliance quests, the closest that even comes to it are related to events that resulted from the manipulations of Onyxia.
---
The Horde are a faction that is trying to carve their place out in the most hostile lands. That’s badass, for sure, and they’re definitely just trying to live their lives, but at the same time they’re achieving that through things like the mass deforestation of western Ashenvale, a sacred forest of the Night Elves.
---
That doesn’t even begin to mention the parts of the undercity where you can clearly find gruesome and insidious experiments being done.
---
Most of my quests on the Alliance involve helping common people in a region who need assistance, dealing with third-party threats (Gnolls, Naga, Twilight’s Hammer, etc.), or dealing with Horde aggressions.
---
Sounds good, I’ll probably go gnome first then goblin after I make all the things I want. Still some time before Phase 2 anyway. I’ll probably have to level a mining alt so I can drop mining for tailor on mage and still make goblin goods and that would be a great time to level engi again.
---
Thanks for the advice all!
---
That's not true though, overall there is more horde then alliance on PvP realms, if you add them all up this is easy to see, no matter the region as well, it's true for both NA/EU. Even if no one knew server balance then on average horde would still be the dominate faction on every PvP realm and alliance would be the dominate faction on every PvE realm.
---
As a Worgen player and hobbyist 3d modeller: Not at all. The model and textures are WAY better.
---
Agreed. It be like that. You into the car scene with that handle? 👀
---
Pre raid bis yes
---
Yes. This is an old idea. 
---
Blizz watches for how often in between jumps. If it is perfectly 5 seconds for, say, 2 hours, banned.
---
Completed the brutal armor quest and got a nice chest piece for my warr, also my first blue item as I haven't done many dungeons. Still lv29 hoping to get a whirlwind axe soon if guildies help me
---
I'm currently level 54 and looking through zone quest rewards on wowhead, I'm not seeing many significant upgrades.  Is there any other benefit I might miss by not questing in these places?  If I wanted to grind to 60 in dungeons, with some variety, what level would be ideal?  I'm a warrior, planning to tank.
---
Battle Shout generates so little threat though.. it's only really enough to keep aggro off of healer for the first bit of the fight.
---
I think they knew what I meant so I didn't fix it.
---
Layering did not work inside raids and there’s no known duping exploit. You’re stretching.
---
Killing other people who are just going about their business...for fun?  I can totally understand if there’s competition for a quest or if someone does a rude gesture or something. But it actually bothers me when people just start fighting for apparently no reason when I’m just walking by. Like bro, there is no honor system. You’re wasting both of our times.
---
It's almost like challenge is good in a game. who would've thought?
---
I had the same thing happen to me. Only the 5 horde (one skull) killed me and did nothing else.
---
You got scammed
---
You protec.
---
And if you used agony on them then you lowered your raid dps for you could get those parses.... do you think that's worth it?
---
It's literally supposed to not work at all sometimes in classic, mobs can just resist it.
---
If you mess it up on retail, you did it with something flying at you.
---
I am getting on top of a building and killing people everyday for 5 minutes. Then I will stop. They can say the stupid rule all they want. They will never be able to enforce it.
---
I'm a tank and I want this to go as fast as possible.  If my healer has mana we are pulling unless we are way undergeared/levelled for the dungeon.  Our shaman/mage/hunter is out of mana?  Oh well their fault for not drinking.  They can drink while we start the fight and secure threat.  Your job as the tank is to make sure that the dungeon goes smoothly, part of a smooth dungeon is not having excessive downtime.
---
Witnessed a mage needing on this and taking it from an enh shaman. Practically tore our group apart. It turned into a 2v1 argument against this mage and everyone was salty. At least we finished the rest of the dungeon!
---
the only way you're getting more than 1 (and in many cases, even 1) is if you're collaborating with the other top guilds to not ring the gong so that everyone can get more than 1
---
an ally is there all the time to kill you, i doubt that. You can definitely find time to spirit res and then hs
---
Holy hell. I have a long ways to go then lol
---
You can probably get by until lvl 60 to be honest, especially if you've got some healing power gear. The resto talents are a nice boon but definitely not required for dungeons.
---
Getting to stranglethorn took me a good 30 mins of actually trying to get there. 30 mins of walking from stormwind.
---
Ok well could be worse
---
Until now I didn’t realize that this was a Grateful Dead song. Ive only ever known the sublime version. I bet that has something to do with growing up in the 90s =)
---
https://youtu.be/O3b423uqrdo?t=720
---
They talk about it in this interview. The next 30-40s following the timestamp (i.e. at 12min in case it's not working).
---
Well, it's easy to get carried away with DPSing when you're a healer and start castnig that heal a bit later than you're comfortable with because you forgot to pay attention. But you should still try to DPS if there's room for it, unless you are completely unable to pay attention to two things at the same time
---
Thoroughly enjoyed this, more pls.
---
Yeah but y'know, hard to get away from [that mindset](https://i.redd.it/o59r5okkuui31.png)
---
classic doesn't have phasing, they have layering.
---
Its not a addon issue. I disabled the addon and can still only do 1 shift click every 60-120 seconds. That really does pretty much make it useless.
---
Second* world first haha
---
You cannot escape the meme-void.
---
I doubt it check the logs, my dps was great
---
So in a way Warriors are the new Huntards as they seem to roll on everything.
---
Had so many Warrior DPS/Tanks roll on spirit stuff (Clothes + Caster weapons) that it was getting ridiculous. 
---
You can wear all armor types and almost any weapon yet you still take away from those that can only wear clothes because it has a few more points of spirit?
---
What about the loss of STR/AGI/Armor?
---
Youre right, small correction to my statement: the huge majority of guilds on retail wont require achievements to begin raiding with them, especially the casual ones.
---
To get it out of the way: 
---
I made most of my money from (tribal) leatherworking, making devilsaur gear and selling it for a profit on the auction house. 
---
For the last week or so I have been able to make devilsaur gauntlets and sell several every day for 5-15g profit per pair (most often in the 10-13g range) and of course every 3 days I could make a rugged hide which I made into Devilsaur Leggings which fetched a really nice profit as well (80g for the first pair, 110g for the 2nd and around 50g for the third). 
---
To keep the income as high as possible I tried to always have 1 pair of gauntlets and 1 pair of leggings as lowest on the AH, and never more than 2 pairs of either at any time (also good way to minimize losses if they would see a sudden priceshift downwards). 
---
I also kept enough mats to craft one pair of gauntlets in my bank at all times, since those sold way more often than the leggings. And as such I was able to minimize "downtime". Not many people were making gauntlets, funnily enough, so even though the devilsaur leathers went down in price on weekends the gloves dropped much less = just more profit for me. 
---
But, you can't flood the market so I needed some other revenue stream to fund the 700g or so needed for all the cloth hand-ins in addition to the 918g for the mount and training. 
---
What I did for this was farm devilsaurs themselves (to have mats at hand. Still ended up buying about 60-70% of the mats I used for crafting though.) during off times. It helped enormously that I was way ahead of the pack. On two or three occasions I would get hours of devilsaurs [like this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/618230306545336343/623705924099506197/unknown.png), because I was all alone in the crater. 
---
What I noticed was that around raid reset and fridays were the best for selling DS gear. Just this friday I believe a guild was gearing for a raid because I had an hour off AH and crafting that looked [like this](https://i.imgur.com/3e56XqO.png).
---
But, sometimes the crater would be packed. Both with hordes and allies alike.
---
So for those occasions I went to farm Felcloth. Felcloth itself is around 2-2,5g at any time, and the satyrs drop loads of green BoEs that vendor for a bunch. If you're lucky, like I was, you might even get a 16-slot bag drop or some patterns/recipes that are worth upwards of 10g each in addition to all the runecloth and felcloth. 
---
The runecloth was all bought for about 7s each, or 1,4g per stack, making the ~10k I used total up to 700g or so. 
---
[According to TradeSkillMaster this is what my gold earnings and spendings have looked like this last week.](https://i.imgur.com/ycG99Vy.png) Although this is misguiding, as when I realised that I made more money from farming/crafting than there was (reasonably priced) runecloth to spend it on I started looking into getting gear upgrades for myself and for an eventual Warrior alt. 
---
So, according to TSM I made a 1188g profit even after buying the mount itself. 
---
If you want the actual profits without buying gear etc during the runecloth buying, then add this to the profits.  
---
        -Expenses-
---
	Runecloth donations (ca 10,000) ~ 700g
---
	Warmonger - 100g
---
	Devilsaur Legs - 125g
---
	Devilsaur Gauntlets - 55g
---
		Enchants ~10g
---
	Shadowcraft belt - 10g
---
	Chromatic Sword - 5g
---
	2x 16 slot bags - 42g
---
	Skullflame shield - 170g + Devilsaur pants (cost 155g in mats, 325g all in all)
---
        918g for the mount + riding training
---
= about 2290g extra profit if I wouldn't have spent it along the way, so a grand total of 3478g profits (496g/day)
---
If that is the case, it does not work like that in Classic.  
---
[https://streamable.com/humou](https://streamable.com/humou)  
---
It does say "Reflect" but nothing happens to the hunter.
---
Yeah but warriors suffer the same fate on that one, no defensive CDs though.
---
I'm thinking of trying a tank enh spec with dodge and bonus armour and block but that's after I get enough money for a mount :p
---
Runecloth is the only type you can turn in repeatedly.
---
demo shout does more to mobs than it does to players. it’s almost like a 30% damage decrease. somehow. probably reck does more than you are thinking. but yeah i suspect there were other factors as well.
---
Except this doesn't work in many cases. When you've got mobs throwing around heals and hexes, you *have* to take those mobs down first - no matter what your tank wants to do. Your notion of talking to the tank about it afterwards doesn't help you win the fight you're in right now.
---
What I see far too often amongst tanks is a failure to understand what others bring to the group - and what they need to operate effectively. A lot of that was contained in the OP. Myopically focusing on the tank's-eye-view of the battle means you're not fighting nearly as efficiently as you could be.
---
its sad that you're downvoted despite being correct. this sub is a noob cesspool.
---
a dessert is supposed to be big and empty... there’s a big empty zone literally called “the barrens” and it lives up to its name.
---
Dwarf priest is actually bis for alliance.
---
Why ten and not twelve?
---
They banned people for layering in raids.
---
No, it's a skill that can directly reward you for just having it. And all you have to do is wait by the chest and keep spamming it to fill your bags full of loot. You already have Pick Pocket which at least requires you to sneak around and can't be repeated on same mob twice, so that's balanced better.
---
Okay these are really good.
---
Why shouldn't they?
---
for 1g, it is like a new form of - will dance for 1g nude in tavern ;)
---
That's some serious grind. I can do something similar with my LW, but I don't want to sit and make headbands for hours on end
---
What map is that?
---
You can get Mirah's in a run if you look up how to do it or two if you don't really care to and it'll make a big difference
---
49-60 has many good options. Start with a full clear of Searing Gorge, as that should give you at least 70% of the entire level. Have you done all the quests in the Hinterlands coast hub?
---
Just reroll man i tried hunter and im always a melee player and i regretted it my hunter is 46 so i went melee lvl 41 now  and im having way more fun there will be plenty of time to catch up  just play what fits you cause that feeling wont go away untill you reroll dont worry being behind you will catch up
---
Lots of people are talking about challenge. Go to the wow forums for classic. There is multiple threads discussing why the game is too easy.
---
This place is a safe haven for people who want a common view that nothing can be wrong with classic and a bunch of meme's.
---
if I see an ally getting their ass kicked, I help them out no questions asked.
---
if it looks like they got it, then I roll.
---
ignoring an ally when they are in need makes you a bitch.
---
I did teldrassil and as many quests I could for Darnassus rep while leveling my human warlock. I have a bonus rep gain of 10% due to my racial, and it took me 350 stacks to get the mount once I was level 60.
---
So 500 stacks seem reasonable.
---
So what ? I don't care beeing spamed if i dedicated a window for that.  
---
And we can work out addons to filter chat and report visually on map area under assault.
---
&gt; But what you're doing is presenting your opinion as fact, when most resources strongly suggest sword spec for both pve and pvp.
---
And what exactly do you think you are doing? And what exactly do you think those sources are doing?
---
I was around halfway to revered from honored when I started doing cloth hand-ins. From revered to exalted takes 8400 cloth. Every stack of runecloth gives 50 honor when you turn in it.
---
This is stellqr advice, if you make it too easy they wont feel any accomplishments.
---
&gt; What pisses me off about tanks is how long they take to pull for no reason. If your dps/heals are drinking but you're full health, PULL THE TRASH SO YOU CAN BUILD THREAT WHILE WE FINISH DRINKING. Saving 15 seconds per pull really adds up over a dungeon. 
---
See I try doing that, and then I get bitched at by the clothies for pulling because they haven't got mana back, and they had to jump up and start dumping the 1/4th of a bar they did have, because it's impossible for there to be mobs in range, and to not be DPSing them. Same with healers. Got 2 non-elites on me, and I'm just trying to build some rage. I've lost less than 10% of my health... why the fuck are you standing there casting something when you're still at 50% mana?
---
Have had a number of random casters ragequit from groups (esp melee heavy ones) because the tank is being to aggressive and not letting them get their mana up. Why it matters I don't know. Killing shit and building rage/threat while they spend 20 seconds getting their mana back up rather than waiting for them just seems faster to me. I think they're just having ego problems because they're supposed to be top of the DPS chart. 
---
&gt;WE DON'T BLAME YOUR FOR LOSING AGGRO TO MASS AOE AS A SINGLE TARGET THREAT CLASS. 
---
You might not, but most do. With PUGs, if I lose a single mob, the DPS start bitching that I'm not doing my job, even if the target is at less than 5% health, and going to die to the DOTs on it in a second as I've opted to spend my resources keeping up threat and damage on the remaining enemies rather than the one that might as well already be dead. Even in my guild, people throw bitchfits because "I'm getting hit and having my cast interrupted"
---
Atop that I love the trend of particularly casters, who when they see a single target drop low enough, they'll shift target before that one actually dies... and then that mob runs off and aggros another fucking group, and the bitching begins. Apparently it's too hard to wand, or cast a single bolt spell to finish that guy off, while the tank is managing threat on the other 3-5 mobs.
---
You're not taking might of menethil then?
---
Nice ! I'm 37 with 4 days /played I hope reaching 10 or 11 days to be 60!
---
The questlog is Questie. If you have it dled but don't see that you might need to update
---
Alliance are dicks.  Even on a PVE server, if I'm crossing paths they always make "rude gestures"
---
He said that it isnt time efficient to make bandages.
---
I understand what you're saying. I guess it comes down to what type of groups you got going. PUGs? I don't really care about them gearing up. Guild groups? Yeah, I'd like for them to get the best gear possible so we can run future dungeons more efficiently.
---
If you can't take bosses in your shitass spellcleave groups, don't waste a tank's time with them.
---
&gt;Slow tanks
---
I’m guilty of this in some runs, but my reasoning (and maybe some of the other tanks you played with had the same reasoning), is that if I don’t necessarily know a dungeon I’m not going to rush in and pull 3 packs at a time, I think it’s better for me to pull a pack or two than wipe the group.
---
Looks like the stupid gnome that was casting blizzard and frostbolt from atop the center building (jail, arena, whatever tf that thing is) in gadgetzan yesterday. Was definitely not just sheeping us, and was actively killing/trying to kill us by spamming frostbolt and blizzard.
---
I guess my point is that I hate gnomes.
---
Rank 3 or 4 fireball are both better choices than 1 if you want to apply the dot.
---
I was born in 2004 so I am the essence of WoW classic
---
Does anyone have a rough estimate of how much gold it would take me to level engineering 1-300.
---
what
---
No such thing.
---
While I think there's a lot of ridiculous tank and healer divas, he was actually apologizing because he was wrong about totems. 
---
Maybe you should read better before going on a rant?
---
They have, but to cast chain lightning, especially with ele mastery on it you need your tank to know his job. The damage is insane and you can easily be focused by all mobs and waste time running around. Fire nova is also a good thing, when placed right. It has some instant aggro, so you have to damage everyone before placing it
---
whats wrong with rogues??
---
You'll still need to return there, at least two times ;-)
---
The AoE farming you see is the mage meta now is something Chinese did way way before anyone understood how to level or grind. They have a whole different thinking of the game. They mimicked their strats from priv servers and now its just regular gameplay. 
---
Chinese were farming Maraudon back in old classic and they all had mage alts level'd in 4 days ready to farm what ever they need. 
---
Not always bots.
---
“Rage is neither created nor destroyed”
---
They have them in Gadgetzan. Getting on top of the cage in the center of town is no guarantee of complete safety. You won't get knocked off of the cage if you're smart, but they can still damage you.
---
I received a similar warning for this back in 2007 when I was on top of the roof of the lumber mill building in Sentinel Hill. It's a silly rule, especially for a PVP server.
---
You're doing a disservice to your healer by not using a shield, and you miss out on some of the nice abilities like shield bash to interrupt. It also depends if you're underleveled for the dungeon, but in general I would swap to a shield when tanking.
---
Do you mean the Shadowforge key? I had completed it last night but didn't know where to turn it in... Still don't.
---
Food and water
---
As a combat rogue thats been auto attcking got 57 levels all im gonna say is
---
Retails moment to moment gameplay&gt;classic.

Make sure you out points into the shield talent

It's part of ElvUI

I've never even found a boe blue...

Thanks man, I'm glad you enjoyed it :)

It's not... You're the one that cherry picked that one
---
Pawn guy: “Let me bring in my guy who is an expert in magic weapons forged by demonic fire elementals in the flaming pits of hell”
---
Expert: “Oh yeah, you have the original hand of Ragnaros here, I know one of these recently went for as much as 5,000 gold”
---
Pawn guy: “I’ll give you 33g for it”
---
So they're going to immediately program booty bay guards on the bunkroom level of the inn under the horde flight path right?
---
I was trying to do the fording quest and a group of horde were camping every layer. They would intentionally fail the quest which took 20min to reset over and over and over again.
---
There is a delay between shift clicks, but it ain't nearly that long, i'm not sure what the problem is then, sorry :(
---
Full group mara, tank charges in with ravager whilst priest is oom. Tank died and leaves group. Good times
---
Random guy on the internet and a GM from blizzard, I wonder who speak the truth.
---
You don't have to put it as passive. That is where you are wrong. It just can't actively be attacking anything.
---
doing Searing now, already cleared hinterlands
---
Mind Control, works every time .
---
Turning super saiyan apparently
---
You could just have it trail off the page at a point
---
&gt; should hold the tongue. 
---
That's rich coming from a person whose comment is buried in downvotes.  
---
&gt; maybe then you'll put in the effort to do your job like the mage and warlock 
---
The fact that you don't understand what is wrong with what you wrote here means you're not only NOT "in the know" as you seem to think you are, but you lack basic critical thinking skills.  
---
I'll give you a hint:  
---
DPSing as hard as possible with zero regard to threat is not doing your job.
---
Its +1 rage per attack you gain though. If you're hit 5 times thats 5 bonus rage.
---
This is why I don't like playing with pug tanks. Just 2h tank unless you're in a raid, and even then probably. As a healer I actually find it easier to heal with a 2h tank because he keeps threat on himself rather than mobs trying to run away.
---
It's been so many years and it still seems so few know that threat generation is &gt;&gt;&gt; mitigation.
---
Okay
---
I mean I'm fine with the horizontal progression too. I'm not over here shitting on horizontal progression lol
---
Or just us your hearthstone...
---
this! learn to play your class before coming to cry on reddit.
---
People went on about how fun it was because compared to other mmos at the time you didnt have to spell out spells you wanted to cast, it was always a fluid game. Unique and interesting gameplay mmm i dont know bit of a stretch there.
---
Wait, how deep are you into resto? That actually sounds pretty tough to solo quest as man. 
---
You'll find a mix of both works. You'll defintely want to knock out some quests to break up the grind of doing the same instance a few times. Around this level you typically going to run the same instance 2-3 times or more for certain item upgrades since sometimes certain slots are incredibly limited around this level in terms of what is actually good.
---
Last group I was in had a guy complaining about me not holding agro, so I told them to find a new tank and I went back to solo questing for a bit. Next group I was in as DPS had an overleveled tank pulling excessive amounts of mobs trying to tank while dual wielding, wiped at least three times and had not one complaint. Only when he equipped a shield did he start pulling fewer mobs and playing smart.
---
You do you man, its not a sprint. Its a maraton, so take your time and enjoy yourself ❤️
---
How are you that dense, carebear?
---
Well ofc, but I'm interested in if there are other options that are effective that isn't just aoe pulling.
---
Hah, why is it shit? :)
---
you get your specialization at lvl 40.  You dont require it to level leatherworking.
---
Yes, a lot more free time I assume, you're right. :)
---
Tbh I tried to convince the group to kill him as he approached the altar
---
whenever i try kicking someone like this, everybody else in the group leaves
---
I know, i have done plenty aoe groups. But it wasnt our group. We had a tank and a mele class as well so i wanted to run it normally so they can enjoy their time too
---

I’ve still never done graveyard lol, people tell me there’s no point

I had one BoE epic drop in my time playing Vanilla through WoD. They are uncommon af!
---
Why are you going to STV before duskwood? Should have the dark shire FP
---
Irony is when someone played with Android phone it was a big hit but console all of a sudden a bunch of hate.
---
Thank you for /spitting. It means I am getting under your skin when I gank you.
---
Your whine is my fuel.
---
I'm pretty sure I recall SP on it, maybe you're thinking of glowing birghtwood staff?
---
I had a Warden Staff drop in TBC, felt like hitting the lottery.
---
Had one of those groups, was pretty fun
---
What sort of "gold milestones" are normal from 1-40? I know that around 35 gold increases exponentially. I'm 27 right now and am sitting at 11-12 gold. Is this far behind? Normal? On track?
---
Then go play BFA. The classic experience is what many of us want, including the combat. If you don't like it, go and play the version of the game where they already changed it for you. Leave this version alone.
---
I don't see how that doesn't make sense.
---
Hellfire peninsula did not feel good. Blade's edge was "meh." I had few feelings for the Netherstorm besides the cool bio domes. The rest of the zones were cool. And the only reason I don't remember TBC as being small was because I couldn't afford fast flying for many months. I was still primarily using ground travel and flight paths, because traveling at 60% flying speed was lame.
---
If you think dps is what makes great logs, then i don't know what to tell ya.
---
Why does challenge or difficulty always have to be tied to some type of dark souls type timing or starcraft actions per minute?  Hell, I don’t care how difficult a scripted encounter is, I’ll always think that a PvP fight is more difficult because of the non scripted reactionary nature of the fight.  
---
That doesn’t mean that mythic raiding isn’t a challenge.  It just means it’s a different type of challenge.   Just like classic.  The challenges in classic are more drawn out.  Getting to 60 can be a challenge.  Organizing 40 people to raid can be a challenge.  
---
It’s like saying that running a marathon or competing in the Tour de France isn’t a challenge because after all, your just doing the same thing over and over.  
---
Challenges are diverse and subjective.   Classic is full of different challenges than retail.
---
Congrats! You just killed 30+ living beings to satisfy the fetish of a weird undead dude.

less SP than maidens circle and brd reward
---
I love these kind of videos, 10/10 should do one for every dungeon
---
Lol selling maradon princess runs as a warlock or hunter for 20-30g has been a thing since the dungeon was released back in the day....
---
This is not a retail thing in anyway.
---
That's what I'm thinking. I spent all of Stockades opening up with Immolate and never pulled aggro once. (My gear sucked beforehand, and there was a giant pile of +fire damage gear in the AH for like 30s total, so I gave that a shot.)
---
You said a couple of months. In a couple of months we will be in phase 2.
---
Spriest raiding in vanilla is awful.  Warlocks will do more than 15% dps than you making the fact that you our can put 5 shadow weaving debuffs practically moot.
---
Your mana management is a joke and going legitimately oom and just wanding is a very real possibility, even when chugging fattest Mana potions every chance you get.
---
I love spriest in PvP and they are really fun in TBC, but for raiding in vanilla they truly suck and probably shouldn't be in a raid.
---
wow like branded clothing haha, smart.
---
Hopefully this takes off on our server as well
---
It does, that's what i would do if i suddenly came into big money and wouldn't need to work to support myself :p.
---
There isn’t time for mana regen or “natural healing” in these kind of groups. That’s exactly the point.
---
Time to adopt a Chinese political prisoner to farm me some gold!
---
Bro, that's a preraid bis for Locks
---
You can get a lot of gold from that.
---
Lmao just play dude, if youre going to do it that way its just gonna get toxic.
---
Wonder how many time you layerd to get the mats
---
YES. People had Sulfuras this early in private servers. People are extremely dedicated to this game where they will sacrifice the entirety of their life for these firsts. This is not surprising to me at all and I’m skeptical of the people immediately shouting that the dude is exploiting.
---
This is the right answer.
---
No I'm on Windseeker
---
If guess normal, sine I'm at 17 at 33
---
Agreed. Things have a much greater feel to them when you've collected quests from all over the world, even if that does make them harder to find.
---
Playing efficiently, communicating, and getting into a groove is fun 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️ fk me right?
---
I mean, if they actively KNOW that you're life tapping and still choose to use all their mana on you, that's on them at that point. Just like if I'm life tapping nonstop and don't warn anybody, it's on me.
---
I honestly cannot decide on which class to play. I love them all apart from priest, and I have been playing for weeks but made almost no progress because I keep on switching classes.
---
What should I do?
---
Stop this shit is actually cringe
---
How can I disable ALL sounds from Deadly Boss Mods? I can't find option, I think I checked all options to disable different sounds and they still play
---
That does actually seem normal. That being said, normal may not be encouraging, because it is "normal" to not have your mount a 40.
---
what magical realms is this that youre playing on?
---
just nonstop "lf TANK" here
---
Pre raid BiS is cloth for mages, priests, warlocks, resto/ele shamans, holy paladins, and balance/resto druids. Sorry, but classic has terrible class itemization. Get ready to compete for cloth with half the server.
---
I hated tanking recently. The group would start pulling while we are finishing up a big pull. People forget how tough the enemies are. Also... I really hate when a dps attacks the non marked target.
---
if you won't heal because you don't like the person you're just being an asshole and wasting everyone's time
---
At least thats a good world drop for a druid!
---
Someone posted [this](https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community#us-realms) not too long ago and it heavily disagrees with you. Not that I have any way of verifying that data. but I'm pretty sure most realms are well over 15k...
---
As others have said, once the server firsts are spoken for, and everyone else is hitting 60 and getting pre raid bis-ish gear, pug groups and less hardcore guilds will gladly take an experienced dps.  
---
It sucks because you are a more hardcore player and want to be with the pack at your skill level, but most at that point are interested in optimizing clear times and having a semi permanent team good to go for the next rounds of raids etc, and don’t want to just let people have fun.  That’s show business baby.
---
This was a private server bug, hence you may find some dated videos advising their use.
---
Please activate windows :(
---
Imagine being that socially awkward
---
That is a quest mob that you're aoe grinding. You know that right?
---
Exit the Highlands to the south where there is the bridge. Jump down into the water that separates the zones, swim east and then north around the coast. It takes a few min to get there.

I'd rather play with you than the guy who's arguing with you, no matter the skill difference (though I bet you'd win that comparison as well).
---
Is there a classic version? I don’t see it anywhere if so
---
He probably just wanted to play with his buddy
---
Once “honour points” are awarded for your death, this trend will be a thing of the past. A story to tell new players whom won’t believe you.  Kinda like when grandpa tells you he had to walk to school, 5 miles there and 5 miles back. Uphill both ways.
---
Probably wants to be in a guild with his friend
---
thundercrap is ragewaste, no mention of whirlwind, no mention of battleshout. its like the most basic things are off
---
Not offing yourself after the 80th MCP run in gnomer as druid
---
I would love to get back into it! WoW classic would be my jam but it's really not possible for me right now. Setting aside multiple hours for raids with a 2 year old is asking for a bad time. (Speaking from experience after trying a PServer.
---
I guess I could just not raid or run dungeons...ever.... :P
---
Swiggity swooty gonna aoe that booty
---
Tanks get tunnel vision and dont even realize theres a thing such as mana. They see that they are full hp and ready to go. Best thing to do after every pull dont heal tank to full and he wont pull.
---
Shame this is the case
---
Go back to highschool? Rich coming from the fucking edgiest of edgelords. As I said, go play a private server so you can rise up with your gamer friends and drop the n-bomb in Barrens chat you absolute cringe.
---
Crafting professions are, in general, a money sink rather than a profit mechanism.
---
The key is to understand that if the costs is simply "buy components, push a button", the result is never going to be more valuable than the components themselves.
---
Certainly, there are players who 'make money' at crafting professions. But when you look at their method what you'll discover is that they're not making money at crafting - they're making money by investing in the Auction Hall. They could have simply skipped learning the profession, bought the items off the AH at a low price and sold them at a higher prices to accomplish the same goal.
---
I dunno .... but you fight for your ppl no matter if it’s morally right or not. Few ppl care about politics and nitty gritty. You defend what looks like yourself.
---
Idk what happened to numbers in videogames.
---
10-20 years ago, I could hop onto any multiplayer game and see how many people were online, how many games were being played etc.
---
We all knew a WoW server could hold up to 3k people and Blizzard would tell us how many subs there were total. We all knew how many people were playing Halo 2-Reach, and in which playlist. You could hop onto any PC multiplayer game in the late 90s/early 2000s, bring up the server list and easily see how many people were playing right now. I don't know when it happened, I guess sometime earlier this decade, everyone just stopped showing numbers. You can only guess how many subs any MMO has nowadays, if you jump onto Halo it won't give you any population number and Microsoft doesn't even tell us how many consoles they have sold. I guess the only thing left is steam population charts, but at this rate they are probably on their way out as well...
---
It is a shame the community had to go out of their way to create an addon for this, and now they break it. They could at least show the faction balance on each realm, but I guess they have no intention of dealing with that, so if nobody knows about an imbalance it's fine?
---
Fair enough xD Thanks a lot, mate!
---
I'm playing on the same server as Alliance, you want me to send a whisper?
---
Vendor it. You won't

Got this off a chest in red ridge 15 years ago.  It was my first epic, and I sold it to fund my mount
---
Green photo Drake is a random reward from dailies in storm peaks
---
A player on Chinese realms got it 3 days ago. So it's still not a WF
---
I’m a bit confused with hunter pets and learning new abilities like claw, bite etc.
---
As I understand it, I have to find a pet that naturally has that ability, somehow ‘learn’ it on my character, and then later teach it to the pet I actually want?  Is that right?
---
How do I know in game what pets can give me what skills?
---
Also, if I’m out in the wild and want to snag a new pet, I’m sol right?  I’d have to have stables my main pet already?
---
Pretty sure not all realms have it anymore. What realm are you on?
---
My birthday as it goes.
---
The bow isn't too great for hunters. Very fast so high ammo consumption
---
Hold on to it. Most peeps are leveling their main still
---
That’s awesome. Might grind r10 out as soon as phase 2 starts. Will be significantly faster than trying to win rolls for Netherwind against 15 other mages in MC and then I can start to gradually upgrade the PvP gear over time.
---
Can one prot and two fury warriors tank UBRS or would fury warriors get melted?
---
xD
---
I love this! Nice job!

That’s literally the same thing as saying gy on the left though
---
Do engineering its mucho fun stuff 😘
---
RNG, is a big deal. Sulfuron ingot is 2% drop rate, required for the hammer of rag. On top of that you need the eye of rag, again low drop chance. The amount of arcanite required, the rep required to get the plans. That takes a ton of work.
---
And bringing up private servers, as we have been clearing the content for 10 or so years on private servers and have min/maxed the hell out of the content, and to emphasize the point, that back 15 years ago compared to today is no comparison. Same with private servers to live server.
---
Rogue and warrior would be most different to a priest, maybe feral druid too. None use mana, all are melee dps or tanks, and except for the druid none of them heal.
---
I'm looking to level it for pvp so that's good to know.
---
People were AoE farming with mages back in Classic all the time. It’s not something new.
---
People have just gotten so lazy because of retail. Pull speeds are incrediblly high. I've had groups decide to smash their heads against the same large dungeon pulls multiple times and ignore my pleas to "just mark some cc targets, itll be way easier". Ive only ran 2 dungeons where we utilized sheeps. Its crazy.
---
Forgot he owns this entire style of editing :(
---
Long distance runners are wirey as fuck though. Sprinters on the other hand have some juicy legs.
---
I just snagged the flask recipe for supreme power should I sell it or get alch to 300?
---
Aw dude. A lot of people go 40-44 without a mount. But to fix it you can stop training abilities, stop professions, and look up some good gold farming mobs for your level. May take a day or two but you'll get it.
---
Netflix N Chill
---
I probably wasn't thinking of SoJ past 1.4.1 lol.
---
20 at level 31 here
---
It's still more threat than thundeclap, and more threat than a lot of tertiary AoE abilities dps will put out expecting the.tank to have atleast acknowledged the 6 other mobs in the pull.
---
Thank you, ill just give up commenting though and let people be beginners forever.
---
I miss the in-person GMs and the shenanigans so much. Such a small thing that was always neat.
---
I squat 600 and my legs aren't that big lmao
---
What's the Vendor / Auction info add-on name?
---
Windfury's dps does scale off your weapon. The other ones which are flat DPS increases due to how they're weighted per swing, while windfury is a % damage increase.
---
That said I prefer flame just because it's reliable and mixed damage type.
---
Did someone say [Hand of Ragneros]?
---
I like this for rage building but it isnt a solve for early dps aggro.  The only solve is letting the tank build hate first.
---
I got the same in Zf also around 43-45...
---
i dont think LFG is all bad, but couple things 1. im leveling a rogue in classic, takes maybe 15mins to get a group together with me leading not that bad considering 2. last time i did runs in classic literally everyone was mauling the entire run on ez mode, no one talked to each other and it was get in get out, and i understand that but where is the interaction exploring the entrance to the run getting those quests maybe travelling as a group to get inside the run 3. i dont think you should just get gear either, it should be a reward and sometimes your not gonna get a piece every run it kinda sucks but its far from grindy compared to other mmos like bdo, etc.

Exactly the same as hordies normies.

Funnily enough when I’m on my rogue that’s the page I keep open Incase I’m slacking in dps for whatever reason.

I have my succy seduce people, then when they're paralysed and can't move come close and /lick them, then walk away.

lmao you're so weird
---
Pagle is overwhelmingly Alliance and its PvE. There is some big Alliance streamer that influenced the imbalance plus an Alliance NPC name.
---
It is probably most useful in an endgame setting.  For progression raiders, there is 15 years of potential data to look at and say “ok we are having trouble on this particular fight, is there potentially a dps or two not pulling their weight?  How do the healers compare? 
---
Personally I like to run them for low level dungeons as well, especially when playing a new class, simply to keep an eye on my own usefulness.  If I’m a hunter, and have less dps than the tank, maybe its time to re-evaluate my rotation or gear.
---
I’m sure there are also people who use it to shame others or brag, but it doesn’t really matter who is top unless that’s your goal.
---
Im on mobile just google it

Beast lore should tell you specifically what skills the pet has.  This is the best answer in the thread IMO.  
---
Have you killed at least ~100 mobs with your new pet?  If so I would think that something went wrong somewhere, you should definitely have learned the relevant abilities if you've killed that many.  
---
Not too hard to just dismiss this one and re-train.  You can bring him along with you to do the feign/corpse run to where you need to go, or if you have a supportive group that will wait at the appropriate spot to let you tame it.
---
Not world first, but cool anyway.
---
what are phases?
---
Same, and I don't buff rogues even in my faction.
---
They're the bad-looking guys at the very least
---
You can't rez at another GY
---
Could also be soul fire, which is a 4-6 second cast and hits like pyroblast. A retail player would try to precast that into the pull to pad the meters but it’s not a very smart thing to do...
---
Layerfirst
---
You know it isn't, right???
---
&gt; The only thing the Warrior can do at range to pull is a trivial amount of damage. That's not a high bar to exceed for anyone.
---
The point of pulling isn’t to do damage. It’s to pull the mobs. It’s much better for the entire party overall to have a slower start and have complete control than more dps at the start and have a chaotic fight.
---
You wouldn’t happen to be the guy on rattlegore selling it for 200g in the ah would you?
---
Yeah for sure. I complain that mobs don’t spawn fast enough in some areas (bosses being the worst offenders) but in other places you just cannot go without a party because the mobs will just be spawning as soon as you kill one.
---
Blizzard is a public company and they don't want to give any information that could negatively affect share value. It's also giving away internal data to potential competition.
---
Don't blame BFA for shitty people. There have been shitty people ever since vanilla.
---
You say misspell. I say this man Bugs Bunnys.
---
My head canon is that he really wants intact skulls and while you’re killing them you keep damaging them.
---
Blacksmithing will be an option within your normal spell/ability page.
---
Horror with auctioneer? Explain.
---
It’s really hardly better than BigDong. I doubt there is any conspiracy behind this.
---
I've hit 60 and leveling up a Druid now. I want to get some great gear and such, but it seems Druids aren't the best for twink-style stuff.
---
I want to heal,  but will be feral while leveling. Should I go straight into Feral or pick up OoC or Furor first? I'd like to run around it Cat Form like an idiot while I'm healing earlier dungeons especially, so was considering picking up non-pure feral first. 
---
Any thoughts? Any items I might want to pick up?
---
I don't think that's true. Vanilla had 12M subs at its peak if I recall. I'm sure the numbers are out there somewhere.
---
I'm not saying there was a mass exodus after Vanilla. There wasn't.
---
Just as G comes before L in the alphabet, when looking from left to right as one would read Graveyard comes before Library.
---
You need to talk to a journeyman?
---
What kinds of things?
---
The Chinese have never been meta. They just have a shit economy so people make more money selling WoW gold than doing much else in their country so they are all literally working when they play.
---
Agreed. If my healer has more than 50% mana we're good to go for small pulls. 75% or more, big pulls.
---
If I die, rez me. Fuck it. I die so often in botched cleave pulls I'm used to it at this point.
---
There is a lot of random shit that gets listed below vendor price on my server . I will never understand why people don't that
---
We’ve all been there.
---
When you train a pet, the pet should have the ability on its action bar. 
---
You, the hunter, "Learn" the ability once you and your pet have used it and killed enough mobs (it's random but usually within the first 10-20 monsters you farm that'll do it).  Once the HUNTER learns the ability, you can then teach it to any other pet that is able to learn that type of ability.  So theoretically you could have a barrens cat and level it to 60 and it would be stuck on claw rank 1 or 2, then you tame a level 60 cat that has claw rank 8 (or wahtever the max is) and learn claw 8, then you can apply claw 8 to your Barrens cat (that you've leveled up) so you retain it's loyalty bonuses and/or the appealing cosmetic appearance.
---
Want to know too!
---
This is hilarious.
---
You must have been insanely unlucky. If the drop rate is 33% then already at 6 runs the chance that one should have dropped is over 90%. The chance for one to drop is 1 minus the chance that is doesn't drop to the power of tries. 1 - 0,67\^6 = 0,909541617831. If we say for simplicity that yours were evenly spread out that means you got your first on your 17th try. The chance that you DIDNT get it any of the 16 before that is 1-(1-0,67\^16) = 0,00164890958756244164895763202881. That is 0,16%.
---
Oh really? Should read it then.

:-)
---
I ran into that group when they were hanging out in the lower room of the Zeppelin. That's when I found out that if your body is on a Zeppelin that leaves, your ghost goes with it.
---
Can the extra attacks from Windfury trigger the Ravager's whirlwind effect?
---
I swear I'm super wholesome in game. I have a whole action bar of /wave and the like and I use them liberally. Unfortunately that doesn't make as fun of a character to draw as "edgelord melodramatic tank" so someone has to be the punching bag.
---
I considered using names of the people that have returned my /wave by ganking me but I think that goes against subreddit rules :P
---
I’m really not buying it
---
I didn't use ravager for long sorry. I got fed up with Enh shaman right around 40 and switched to ele. Ele isn't perfect, but it has made my leveling experience much easier.
---
You can't gain rep from tabards in classic, I guess with the exception of the argent dawn Tabard. 
---
You have to do quests and hand in cloth for reputation with other cities.
---
Tfw I only get attacked by Horde who are red to me, ??, or while I am fighting mobs. "bUt AlLiAnCe   hAvE nO hOnOr."
---
Yep, after an year install the game buy a subscription log in and sell it then log out delete the game and be happy.
---
ELI5 how they are layering raids....
---
How sweet lol
---
Also, if I take a beast with a rank 2 ability (say claw) can I learn that even if I haven’t learned rank 1?
---
It is worth to start playing right now and rush to 60 fast or there is room to wait a little bit more?
---
Hello fellow mumer :)
---
Suddenly *Nazgum the Orc* stabs you in the back.
---
That really HURT!!
---
That in vanilla they didn't do anything about it, and if they do now, it's not a true vanilla experience.
---
People would put up hundreds copies of a single silk cloth so that it was impossible for people with no addons to buy complete stacks.
---
Fishing Buddy has a classic version on Curse
---
Yeah, GM 17 years old post must be a lie.
---
You must be playing on skeram or herod
---
I'm fairly sure Tauren can't use other race mounts due to size, except for something such as rivendares death charger
---
At least Mara is color-coded.
---
 riposte (now more commonly referred to as parry haste) is really only an issue in raids. 
---
best way is to actually try several weapons while tanking to decide for yourself.
---
Kembria's angels.
---
&gt; Warden Staff
---
that one is BiS for druid tanks throughout all of Classic, iirc.
---
I don’t really see corpse camping as wPvP tbh. You got your revenge, fair, but then started acting like a little wanker and he used layering to get on with his life. 
---
I don’t see any issue.
---
Yeah, Im going to pvp either way and probably aim for rank 10 at the most. Was just making a point on how it is setup.
---
Ive been having a blast pvping already with no rewards.
---
There was at least one precedent where a guy won an argument with a GM when he did the darkshire thing, the GM let him continue. But it was way back in the day, and it's only natural that they developed a policy concerning this exploit
---
He can also rez at gym, for free, no rez sick, then just travel home in safety. Or hell hearth..
---
Yeah man I am a priest and got lucky with cathedral runs with 4 warriors level 40-42. And we rushed the shit out of it. Went from 37-39 in like 2/3 hours? And got a shit ton of gear. I’m not even holy. Shhh don’t tell anyone.
---
Played horde in vanilla and switched it up. Alliance travel points are TRASH. Our boats are garbage compared to the zeps both in terms of convenience(zeps can go to 2 locations, boats only go to 1) and where they bring you(fucking wetlands and theramore vs main hub cities and a great location in stv when leveling). And we straight up just don't have any flight points in some of the zones I'm supposed to level in right now. Looking at you, Badlands and Swamp of Sorrows.
---
Then why take mages? Might as well not waste everyone's time and invite other dps who won't get invited to aoe groups otherwise.
---
I’m not going to argue with you anymore, but if you really want to pull the “thats what you sound like” card you should read the last few comments you made and re-evaluate your life choices.
---
If your any older than 15 you need help.

Print screen contains metadata that can be used to track the players server.  There is a really reason to use a phone to take wow screenshots.

Just hit 60 as a rogue wasn’t going to world pvp until phase 2 but this sounds like a fun way to make a buck or two thanks for the idea
---
This guy games
---
Go to IcyVeins and look up classic frost mage builds. There’s multiple of them with the Winter’s Chill one being my preference.
---
Copy the WTF and Interface folders over. You will still have to do some tweaking depending on what mods you use though.
---
I left my VPN on one time while doing this, and now I can't sign in through the client anymore without getting error 519000314 'this account has been locked due to suspicious activity error, we sent you an email' (and there's no email).  now sign-in only works through launcher
---
What's phase 3? When they release battlegrounds?
---
what region did u play?
---
Yet I still only have 20g at lvl 40 now): no mount, blah to enchanting and tailoring
---
Why would you be pissed at a dps healing you so you can do the dungeon in the first place?
---
Talk about entitled.
---
You could start now and not rush.
---
Does the ZF event actually speed up if you pull and aoe the mobs vs just letting them come to you? Or do you just have to wait the same time for each wave?
---
I am trying to get exalted reputation for orgrimmar as undead. Is it possible to ride wolf mount as undead? Just making sure that i dont grind for nothing.
---
We can use orc wolves, but not undead skelehorses or darkspear raptors. I think we can use other special mounts though, just not the city related ones
---
Well I mean there are people that say L before R for left and right hands so like if it doesn't work for you what can I say. Reading left to right G before L, applying it to the map of the Monastery.
---
Easy enough. Make questing a viable levelling method, and don’t let ppl skip it. It works for several days /played in classic, no reason it can’t continue past it. It’s all in how you design it.
---
The funnest runs are always the ones with either no tank or no healer. Need to be a bit more creative in how to do things. I remember "tanking" SM as a Warlock back in Vanilla.
---
come to Whitemane.  Alliance slightly outnumbered and needs more.
---
This is correct. When your 2.7 speed sword misses a few times in a row and the DPS are impatient someone is gonna pull aggro. While a faster weapon doesn’t prevent dodge parry parry to start off the fight, it helps lower the amount of time before you get some enough rage to slap a sunder or two on.
---
You probably think you're smart considering you say something like that but you're fucking wrong and its EXACTLY HOW THIS WORKS.
---
More damage is more threat if you're taking as a warrior in defensive stance. Explain to me how that is wrong? You take more damage as 2h but you also hold more aggro. You think a shield boosts your threat or something?
---
I like those odds
---
Your moronic reply to my comment is the the most cringe of all and I hope you are stuck with this turd on your server
---
Sholo\Strat where always 5 mans.
---
Can you clarify what substance is? I played classic at launch, and never stopped.  I've been subbed since day one, and leveling in classic is just godawful. I'm 50 and I really don't want to log in and keep going, but I want to see those raids again so I'm slogging through.   It doesn't feel like an adventure, it feels like someone crafting a bunch of tasks to waste as much time as possible.  It doesn't feed verisimilitude to be told to fly back and forth across the continent twice for a single quest chain, it just feels like someone wanted it to take longer.  15 minute unsoloable escort missions that aren't marked as elite just feel like traps to new players.  I'm not feeling any substance.  I know the endgame is great and working with a team to accomplish things are amazing, but the leveling isn't fun or substantial or anything, and wasn't in 2005 when I did it the first time either.  It was just a hell of a lot LESS punishing than the other games that were out at the time.
---
What do you mean by worth it or room to wait? There's no rush to hit 60 at the moment. I mean if you do you can get a bit more molten core loot by farming it, but that's it. There's lots of time until phase 2 were all pvp begins, and even if you wait another month you can be completely ready for it, and MC gear is meh and you get it quickly over time.
---
You need to write GANK in the middle
---
These are so fucking good. Please keep going. I love them.
---
There is always alternatives for xp. Just come back later.
---
Gz, For The Horde!
---
No, very few people RP 100% of the time. There are a few RP faux pas but that's not one of them, so don't worry.
---
and then they'd have less money and i'd just continue playing on a private server (where they put guards on the roofs, because not idiots).
---
:) you are correct, I assume.  I created this:  [https://imgur.com/a/BitLEV3](https://imgur.com/a/BitLEV3) last night as a plan.  Clear hydras and walk the alt acct along the red line, stand at red X.  Main kills Princess at yellow circle.  
---
That was my plan anyway, but I had super bad RNG and ripped to Princess, so I wasn't able to formally test the range, but it sounds like you're saying that distance is within range.  
---
And of course, when ripping in Mara from the staff entrance is beyond a pain in the ass, as you can't access staff entrance while you're dead.  Further, if you spirit rez and then use the staff to re-enter the staff entrance, you actually will create a separate instance (you will not join your party member(s)).  So the alternative is to enter orange/purple instance portal and then walk back to Princess and kill.  This is fine (I didn't do it last night cuz I was tired and gave up my test), but if you are doing Mara runs, this does not provide a long term solution, as when you /camp and reset, your alt will start the new instance at the staff entrance, and YOU will go back to the oj/purple instance you entered.  
---
 If someone dies through Staff entrance, there is no way to continue your /camp mara runs unless everyone leaves the instance and re-joins a new staff portal at the same time.
---
For high-level alchemists, what's the best way to profit from your arcanite transmutes? Do you buy the mats and sell the bars on the AH, or sell your transmute to those with the materials? If the latter, do you hawk your transmute in trade chat when it's off cooldown, or wait until you see someone offering to buy transmutes?
---
Scholo/strat is 5man and ubrs 10man. Hell you can 5man rend runs in UBRS if you want to.
---
Because I find it more fun.
---
What addon tells you prices just looking at it?
---
UBRS is tuned for 10.  Everything else is 5.
---
As a resto shaman, I’ve been prioritizing spirit on my gear, thinking this is what people mean by MP5. I’m realizing I should probably be prioritizing int, is that right?
---
Ah okay :) I never really pæsy Tauren myself, so I thought it were them all
---
You misspelled undead
---
Need it for leveling 285-295. 
---
There are very few inexpensive patterns you can use. 
---
One of the other patterns you can use... runecloth gloves... Qia also sells. 
---
It also costs like 40g on the Ah.
---
this is so far above both of your heads, its saying that the hand of rag has a lot of clout around it nothing to do with this mace in the picture just the name of it
---
Ye im picturing blizzard allready preparing the bankrupcy papers in fear of this.
---
Yes, Undead can ride wolves.
---
That's a killer tabard
---
Yes you can, and your pet too can learn higher ranks without knowing the lower ranks.
---
Jokes aside, how broken would Death Grip be in classic? Ignoring that DKs dont exist.
---
How much did you pay per ingot?
---
BC was good and it did not introduce level creep for a significant impact on the overall game. As the expansions stacked and fundamental unplanned changes were made to level scaling it became absolute shit quick. By the time mists released any magic was sucked out of the game. To anyone new coming to the game at that point, it was just another game. 
---
You can't care about filthy casuals AND the dedicated player base. You get good leveling or fast leveling. Pick one.
---
Yeah man, it’s weird. But hey, he’s got his entire guild on here defending themselves so they must be legit! I call bs, even if they themselves did not exploit, one of the 7 ingots they bought more than likely was. Hopefully blizzard bans all the exploiters and the items they all farmed up.
---
Uhm whine? I was just describing how I started spitting back. Wine maybe.
---
Apologies because this probably gets asked again and again, but I've hit 40 and unlocked riding but still need to buy the mount. Currently at 25g and still have some ways to go. No profession progress, sold all my BoEs and whatever else.
---
Were to I continue to questing and sell every item I don't need would I make it to ~75g fairly quick or is AOE farming possibly more lucrative?
---
Doubtful. Most of the gold sellers make their money through hacking accounts and offloading the gold anyway.
---
My experience as a lock is the opposite. I'm specced into draintanking, so healing myself is no problem. I'll tap to top up mana, then before the pull even happens I'm suddenly back to full HP. I can just feel the healer silently judging me and finding me lacking, but i don't want to sound like an ungrateful asshole by telling him that he doesn't need to heal me most of the time so i stay silent in shame :0.
---
You'll notice that nowhere did I claim that a virtue of the Hunter was that they could do more damage on the pull.
---
When a Warrior pulls with a bow, you end up with a completely uncontrolled spawn running towards the party. This is pretty much dead last on pulling techniques. It's something anyone could do and there's absolutely no advantage in having the Warrior do it.
---
Indeed, there's at least one considerable disadvantage: if the Warrior does it, you get lumps of caster damage on the Warrior that the healer is forced to cover (and thus draw healing aggro) because the Warrior is about to take a pile of melee damage on top of that. If you had anyone else pull, they'd receive the caster damage - and there would be no particularly pressing need to heal them because the damage would stop after that point.
---
It's really not a complex issue. Warriors do not have useful pulling tools. Other classes/specs do.
---
Just had a shammy tank who couldn’t keep aggro. It’s not good
---
What if we focused on notable people like Vol'jin, Cairne or Thrall? Not including others, you think they're all stupid or bad? Obviously not. The only way you can make them out to be bad is when you include someone else. "Well with thrall, you gotta consider " or "Well Cairne died cause of " etc.
---
Been killing spiders in Hinterlands for a quest. This guy was doing the same, ran up to me with the message above. Basically - if you see me in the game, please link any boe drop you get if this is how it works :D
---
Honestly you're better off waiting for the av wolf mount. More fun to grind for and it's sick.
---
Also the Satyrs have 5 spawn points, there are currently 8 people camping them and half have high damage instants unlike you so GL with the tagging!
---
If you think people are doing this sort of thing alone, you are out of your mind. The people you see with achievements like this are playing with a group of 3 or more people who are most likely going sweaty af every night.
---
Are you projecting?
---
This is exactly my experience. There's no room for good tanks in PUGs.
---
You can skip ranks.
---
Yes? Moving the flag/ball from on end of the field to another, without the opposition getting it off you, and getting it into the "goal". There are lots of similarities.
---
We aren't running m+ here. Why does it always have to be max efficiency?
---
Never trust an undead.
---
Source: I play the game
---
As a Paladin tank, if I want the dungeon to go smooth and quickly I need at least 3 full stacks of water. I never drink to full. I will just make sure to get 1-2 ticks of drink in between each pull so I have the mana to continue the run.
---
The free water is the primary reason I invite a Mage in the first place. The AoE damage is secondary.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc
---
So ure saying thounds of ppl should be banned cus most swapped layers while lvling etc too?
---
Scholo/strat are tuned for 5man. I've only done 1 UBRS as 10man and it was pretty easy so I'm guessing people will be doing lots of it with just 5man or maybe 6-7 people.
---
Then you’re getting fucked on price because it only sorts by bid price, not buyout price
---
A genuine WoW sequel would allow us to ask fundamental questions such as"why have levels"?
---
Could you create a game where you could explore the entire world, interact with players and explore dungeons and battleground without it being meaningless if you're not in a specific level range?
---
Probably wasn’t getting shot at by a lvl 60 while getting there.. big difference
---
Stats weren't added in vanilla iirc... Achievements and stats weren't till wrath.
---
I think ferals can farm that low lvl mace with the 3 charges to increase attack speed by 50%.  As long as they have enough of them they can pull competitive numbers.
---
Look up the item that starts the quest and look at its drop rate for certain mobs.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/item=1357/captain-sanders-treasure-map#dropped-by:0-10-9+1
---
Without exposing the privacy of the users involved, it was pretty simple.  A user was accidentally given an item with immense power, that item was used inappropriately, and the damage was discovered and undone.
---
I know those involved came out with their side of the story and I don't really see any reason to dispute it.  Sometimes the simplest explanation is the correct one, and the story is fairly close to reality.  Fairly.
---
I had a priest quest by me in Un'Goro by the tar mobs that give you that crazy disease or whatever, and everytime i got it, he MCed me and took it off and re-buffed me. 
---
What a guy.
---
It's not that absurd.  9 ingots at a 33% drop rate requires 27 runs.  If across the whole server there were 10 runs week 2 and 17 runs week 3, there's 9 ingots.  And if these guilds had been communicating so they all knew there was one guild willing to pay an extremely high price for the ingots, it's not unreasonable that they would all be willing to sell their ingots to one guild.
---
Well what's weird is that i just used Beast Lore on the one i tamed and it does say that it should have the skills i am looking for.

IMO Demo is a meme and it was only worsened by the bug, now patched, which was causing Demo to generate more threat than it should against big packs.
---
For threat generation, it’s rage:threat ratio. Revenge &gt; Sunder &gt; other stuff. Slap one Sunder on a mob and they should turn. So, really, you should be target swapping – or using mouseover macros – and getting a Sunder on the mobs you’re tanking. I’ve always thought of TC and Demo as debuffs and that worked Vanilla/BC. 
---
15 years ago, MMO dps players understood that meters mean nothing if you can’t manage aggro.
---
Shadoweave will last you well into the 50s, so it's quite good to get. I took two levels off of questing to just grind mobs for mageweave in order to craft mine.
---
Fuk yea
---
Had meteor shard drop in a pug yesterday, the rogue was super pumped. Hunter won it and stated that he dual wields and is going to use it. I offered to tank another round for the rogue but he was already defeated and gave up.
---
Run dungeons, you'll get plenty of stuff to sell to vendors and also level up.
---
I have no knowledge or information on this matter. But I have seen MANY things that say added in 1.13 that in game. And were for sure added before that.
---
yeah fr
---
There is absolutely going to be paid server transfers.
---
You know what, you're right. The GM ONLY meant this for standing on a building and they designed the buildings to have certain spots just outside of guard aggro so we can have fun world pvp times inside of neutral towns without the hassle of guards. Those spots (which I didn't even know there were more than one?) are special for the players who discover them to endlessly camp the other faction, risk free!
---
Or maybe....JUST MAYBE....they're included in the exploit and are considered against the rules because you are stopping the intended behavoir of the guards. If you're safe spotting by "being out of guard aggro range" inside town where you CLEARLY should be attacked, you will be reported. You, and everyone else trying to argue "well guard aggro range isn't building exploit" know it's not intended. Stop trying to be dicks in town.
---
Ty for your reply.  
---
Yeah I am gonna try out the first dagger I come across as I lvl, and then try to make note with different weapon speeds.
---
What do y’all do with the scheduled RP time? I like to think you all just get together at a bar and just bullshit on /say. I’m guessing it’s mostly questing and farming.
---
And now you know why cross faction devilsuar mafia is super easy for those people
---
Doing it.
---
it works, at worst you have to loot the mob twice after you kill it
---
Only sells for 2g on my server. I got one to drop and I just ended up using it myself
---
Try like 15 years ago... I really don’t get why everyone is grasping for “firsts” on a game that came out in the mid 2000s.
---
Hit cap in pvp is 3% I believe.
---
Dont need to tell me, I was tanking said melee cleave groups with Ravager, thats an entirely different thing. Also i find it funny you preaching about 15sec wasted and that its not efficient but you would save nova in a cleave group in case you get aggro instead of helping to kite with it.
---
And again, as a paladin I've been tanking ton of semi-spellcleave groups and rarely ever dropped aggro, and never to the healer unless someone was stupid and started dps'ing before i could even cast a single consec.
---
That's just what I've heard. It was painful trying to get 1 pattern for myself. I wasn't even reselling it.
---
Yeah it's like this one except it has the same text as base WOW this one would probably give me a headache lol
---
Ahh I didn't actually check any of em, just saw the ! on my minimal while I was running by.
---
Leveled 1-60 once already and 3 BoE epics dropped. Everyone needed on them each time. Nobody got mad.
---
1  Fiery War Axe
---
1  Kang the Decapitator
---
 1 Blackskull Shield
---
I was a warrior and i could use all of these, gave 0 fucks about the priests/mage needing on them also.
---
Trust me i get it, people are just gonna be upset whatever happens, ive been told off even when im polite about leaving when its me and 3 friends, just the nature of it, it sucks but its how it is.
---
It's not worth using if you have 305 weapon skill already.

Better than zzirgrizz's the matrix mate

At the moment Maroon 5 got 7 songwriters for them. So it is Maroon 7 now.

This is the view from the sender. So she I'd the mum
---
I think such a manifesto would be a solid baseline. I'd like Blizzard to be able to iterate on it and bring some things that are genuinely new (I'd like the way mounts work to be completely redone) - but would be good to hash out what the magic of WoW actually is

I don't think there could be a bigger waste of time. The bosses don't even drop loot 90% of the time, and it's so short the exp isn't even worth it.
---
Benediction may fit your needs.   As of last time I checked.   Alliance has bit more in  numbers but horde has more lvl20+,    I believe it’s the closest ratio of all servers.
---
Stupid sexy Flanders.
---
No, it did not.  From the official blue post on the exploit bans for dungeon layering abuse, regarding Esfand’s MC reset:
---
&gt; Side note for the curious: that was a completely separate bug that has existed since 2004, and actually happened several times back then, it just wasn’t being broadcast to thousands of viewers at the time
---
This isn't saying we need to do things quickly, but interesting to think about the future!
---
Yeah, I've gotten used to the fact that healers will need on my shit, but I don't stoop down to that level. Cause in the end doesn't even matter
---
Prove it with screenshots then. Because we aren’t talking about 9 per week. We’re talking more like 3, 9, 15 which still isn’t likely, and all of this falls under the assumption of a faulty drop rate quote from a broken wowhead link, and all under the assumption that X guilds ran it and received Y ingots and sold them all. 
---
Get real lol.
---
Yeah but it fits better. Doesn't make sense that stealth  is faster than mount speed in retail
---
it's funny how, even in 2019, ppl don't realize alli and horde are all literally the same ppl. if ur getting ganked in stv it's because alli got sick of the 20+ horde constantly coming up from stv to gank duskwood
---
Fellow healer here. Completely agreed.
---
Elvui is actually pretty customizable. You can disable most things and only use what you need, it just takes some fiddling.
---
One of them i cant even find on the AH. Thunder one is 50s a pop.
---
I want this. HOW? Brb, deferring to the wisdom of the prophet google
---
Stupid sexy flanders
---
Ah so real life
---
I'm glad you did mate :)
---
I would go Arms, at least until Tactical Mastery. Keeping Rage between stance changes will help you tank.
---
Also, don't use Heroic Strike, Sunder Armor is a better use of your Rage and will make your normal attacks do more damage.
---
I will disagree with you on some of that.
---
I've played a tank for the better of a decade. Your job in a dungeon is absolutely to help make the run as quick as possible. Yes you should wait to let healers (and dps) drink. But so many tanks are excessively slow at pulling between packs, to a fault. The tank is essentially the leader of the group, you have to show leadership in your pacing and not actively slow down a group with poor pacing.
---
It's totally worth it to play right now however you want. Rushing to 60 or not, it's all fun.
---
ITS NOT YOUR SHIT. That's my argument lmao
---
i had a tank that allowed me to stealth and position behind mobs before charging in, i felt so pampered
---
Considering how fast they got it done (legit or not) I doubt he or his guild were making sure they had BiS before trying to get it. If you're good enough to do the content in meh gear then who cares?
---
This whole gear elitism thing lately is so stupid, we're talking about T0 and T1 here lol.
---
You're the kid that claims 'haxx!' when he loses in an arena.
---
It just makes everyone else groan and face-palm.
---
Is 100g the cost of mounts/training at 40?
---
i dont get your comment
---
I've enjoyed single target fire so far.  Points into ignite and anything with crit.  I doubt it's optimal but I've been having fun with it.
---
I am not, it’s not hard to go through the whole thing to find the cheapest buyouts
---
Any skill like that works on mobs that WOULD have given exp. So anything that's green or above for you.
---
He SAID that he had a guild talk to him for hours trying to recruit him so he said f it he'd apply. He got denied yesterday, the best part is after he applied they told him about all the benefits. He would get priority on loot and they would help him farm for the priest staff. He actually laughed out loud when he got the discord message saying they couldn’t accept his application because they had too many people already. Meh, he's a leader in his current guild and although small he knows that one day they can save the world.
---
Well, generally speaking, Team 2 (WoW dev team) didn't want Game Masters to be a visible part of the game.  I know a few here have stories of a GM popping in front of Ironforge and having fun with people for a bit but the policy on that was a swinging pendulum.  Regardless of how often exceptions took place, the norm was that you should be completely out of sight.  
---
If you flagged your character as visible (or removed your invisibility flagged), you could bet someone looked into why and made sure it was within the needs of your customer support ticket.  I was one of the few people who would be doing extraordinary things on real live production servers, and even I had to note every situation and why it was necessary.  
---
I once created an item worth about 50 silver for a hotfix test and forgot to destroy it, and it was flagged for my boss.  The oversight was relentless, and I'm glad.
---
CoE/CoR/CoS/CoW, there are 4 other warlocks with you in the raid who could have used the debuff slots for their corruptions / nightfall procs.
---
And I am pretty sure that the math would check out, that if you didn't use CoA and just spammed shadowbolt, you would increase your DPS. You have 37% crit chance according to the log, so close to a 40% chance of dealing double damage.
---
A single cast of shadowbolt &gt; ~8 ticks of CoA (average tick according to the log was 214).
---
There's a reason why warlocks who have been playing private servers for literally years, only spam shadowbolt.
---
In World PvP if I'm killing a mob?
---
Blizzard isn’t going to spend any time thinking about it until WoW is as milked as it can be.
---
How in the fuck is classic even close to as challenging as retail?
---
Fucking LFR is more challenging than most of naxx.
---
Aww it was deleted.
---
No server is reasonable enough to buy 9 on. That’s the point. You’re asking for literally all the ingots on a server, and assuming there’s were enough kills to make this happen.
---
Level arms for questing, and world pvp if you are on pvp server. You can tank with this spec as well. Early on to hold agro use, thunder clap, demo shout, and tab target + sunset on all of your enemies.   
---
It’s helpful to have a weapon swap macro, from 1h+shield to your two hand weapon and back.
---
GO TO RETAIL
---
That's what I thought.
---
Non news, don't care. 
---
I'm going back to leveling.
---
And he wrote "mourir" wrong. Rip.
---
You have to manually install the normal version, then find the classic fix for it and paste that overtop! =)
---
The talent specifically say "yields xp" isnt that different?
---
I didn't either until a Warden Staff dropped for me in Mara yesterday
---
I think it should, unless it's coded differently from other stuff that relies on targets giving XP. Otherwise locks couldn't make shards after hitting max level, period. I just fucking scared myself stiff, can you fucking imagine playing a lock in that situation, you would need to fill every slot you can with shards while leveling, go bankrupt buying bags and bank bagspace and then you would need to keep playing knowing that inevitably one day you will become a cripple with no access to most of your class defini g abilities :0.
---
I mind control and Fortitude every horde I am able to! Oddly enough i rarely get the cast off.
---
Sometimes they then take my buff and use their higher health to kill me after
---
&gt;2. last time i did runs in retail literally everyone was mauling the entire run on ez mode, no one talked to each other and it was get in get out,
---
This is literally what happens in classic. Except its more like we all afk at the entrance waiting for the last guy for 15 minutes.
---
that feeling when you see the same post 9 days in a row
---
Yeah. I like the lunatic warriors who never stop.
---
Everyone should replace the group frames with raid frames and show resource bars. It is SOOO much easier to see in what state your group is with raid frames.
---
Hardest bosses of BWL to my memory were Coordination(Razorgore), DPS (vael), and Nefarian since the dragon adds were random and could cause wipes
---
He told us that where he respawn it's instant death
---
forgot to use a flair haha, should be back
---
Assuming no levels of standard deviation , and that all ingots are sold to you and no one else. 
---
Are we going to keep making assumptions?
---
It may not be pre-raid BiS but it’s close enough and the cheaper option, Maiden’s goes for 250-300g on most servers, Underworld goes for 70-150g
---
That's a repair bill, but worth it to be an infiltrator I bet
---
The amount of time it will take for people to get bored of lvl 60  and market to get saturated with gold. 6 months or so.  Imho not worth it holding item for this long, by the time they cost those promised 100s of gold, the dude won't need that currency if he plays now.
---
So basically the usual: "OMFG UR SO BAD I WATCHED A AOE GUIDE SO I AM A MASTER SPELLCLEAVER AND I FARM AOE 1-60 Y U SO BAD YOU CAN'T BE THE FULLY PREPARED AND GEARED TEAM IN THE VIDEO???!!! FFS!!!!!"
---
No one can answer that because every server has different prices.
---
I'm sure it's already been said, but save it. You'll be able to get some rediculous amount for it in no time from a hardcore raider desperate for it. We're talking like 2kg.
---
&gt;  You can get all the actual fun pvp wars on a pve server still, but you don't have to deal with this stuff anymore.
---
You absolutely cannot get the same experience on PvE realms.
---
PvP realms create so much excitement, fear, and drama that it makes the game so much more deeper. Every single encounter with an enemy faction player is filled with emotions.
---
It really helps to have started leveling since day 1 because you don't deal with max level players coming to grief you. The worst you get is the occasional group of players who grief you but even then, most of them won't camp because they are rushing to level up.
---
But honestly, almost all my most memorable and exciting moments in Classic has been PvP encounters. I remember every PvP encounter vividly and I have enemies who I'll hate for the rest of my time in Classic.
---
Ice block in WC? Pshhhh no way
---
Sounds like a horrible experience, no loss not grouping with them again. I wouldn't feel bad leaving, you weren't the first, and I'm sure if they are like that with everyone, they are used to it.
---
lol calm down, i was aoe leveling by level 20 on my mage in vanilla.
---
Fair.
---
I fought against a level 27 Priest and mid battle he managed to full heal from around 25% life to 100% life.  I hadn't setup my weapon swap macro on my warrior at this point so I was more frustrated with not being able to Shield Bash his heals away and because he was so close to Execute range I was spamming it thinking it was over that I can't remember the name of the spell or how long the cast was even.  
---
I've tried looking at the list of Priest skills but I can't see any abilities this powerful for his level if anyone has any idea so that I can be better prepared in future.
---
AQ 40 has a decent wep which is a little bit of an upgrade or a sidegrade.
---
What’s your reck going to look like?  Mines going to be 26/25/0.   Enough for raid heals, and dungeon tanking, and should be, if I can get the gear, comparable to a ret build for damage.
---
But.. muh arbitrary metric of selfworth? :(
---
Lol 250g. Only gonna sell to the hardest of the hardcore at those prices.
---
Grinding wheat into flour
---
No, I don't regret leaving.  I left on very good terms.  I had an opportunity to join cities with my fiancee (now wife and mother of kids) and I took it.  Since then not only have I grown personally but professionally.  I also realize now the great importance in changing your company every once in a while.
---
Fuck that man, if people want to be asshats they need to learn that being an asshat has consequences. Leave em high and dry everytime if they're going to act like that. Just because they're in a guild and started a group doesnt give them license to treat people like shit, and joining their group doesnt mean you're obligated to encourage their shitty behavior and finish the dungeon with them.
---
Play dwarf.
---
I see, does this negate the human racial chosen? As in, do humans still have a bonus at max level with 5 points in swords and the racial?
---
If we progress to TBC after Naxx, it won't be Warcraft: The Burning Crusade, it's going to be something different. And we're going to be using a modified legion client with some modifications.
---
So put guards on the roof!?
---
Not everybody has sound logic 😂
---
most healers are fucking awful and make dungeons take much longer than if they had half a clue how to heal without spamming their mana bar
---
I have played vanilla thru wrath on 3 end game toons - multiple high level alts. Never got BoE epic. Yesterday I killed a gnome warlock as he was farming yetis in ferelas. The yeti I stole from him dropped a Flurry Axe :)
---
Problem with retail's difficulty is that literally everything is piss easy except heroic/mythic raids and (high level) M+
---
Blizzard's philosophy of "everyone gets to see all the content" has just destroyed any sense of challenge in the game.
---
Does classic support custom graphic UI elements? What do you guys think about an addon that would be basically a stoplight frame that healer would be able to set. Red light means wait, yellow light means "I'm drinking but you can pull", green light means "I'm fully ready to do my job, go on!"?
---
I killed a level 21 gnome mage thrice on my level 47 warlock. Gotta teach them not to trespass.
---
Nice hunter ring
---
How will twinning make you money? Sorry I’m kinda new
---
What Mac and macOS version?
---
Awww snap, that would have been so good T\_\_T
---
How viable is Druid tanking?
---
I’d like to alt a tank character and was wondering how viable Druids are at primarily dungeon tanking (I understand they can’t MT raids because they take crushing blows). 
---
All of the rest of their utility sounds amazing to me and I’d like to use it to farm herbs/leather as well and I feel that a Druid could do things like this better than a warrior.
---
Its not about you buying it or not, it is about wheter it's working for some people or not. Besides, in our culture, most thing are left to right, wheter it is video games( like platformer), reading, etc. So his argument does make sense because we are used to think that if something comes before in a linear line, the former goes left and the latter goes right. It will definitely help me in the future.
---
You can tank dungeons as fury or arms. Prot is only necessary for raids
---
Probably retail mindset. Oh the amount of times I got kicked from LFG in retail for not chainpulling for the rushing mage because I have to wait 3-5 secs for my rune cooldowns...
---
I'm leveling a priest and I'm totally going to do this
---
People had epic mounts a week ago. 
---
Never underestimate hardcore MMO players.
---
I actually don't mind using their launcher, but then don't give me desktop icons that fill up my screen when you're just going to take me to the launcher anyway.
---
Cool. Thanks for sharing!
---
Me and my friends thought the same thing back in the day. spending forever running there, res hopping through stormwind when the GY for horde is almost in redridge and it will take multiple deaths to get there, then the dungeon isn't even worth it. Me and my friends all agreed that was stupid and a waste of time and wasn't fun. I was just trying to save them an afternoon.
---
Pretty close on the first guess; go to various interesting places in the game, and converse/recap what we'd done in the world over the time between sessions.
---
I’m horde. Orgrimmar?
---
Hardly makes a difference... but here we are anyway. Makes sense.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vqypMHxJDs just gonna leave this here.
---
A rogue can roll on his bis bow with a hunter in the group.
---
A hunter can roll on dal rends and truestrike shoulders with a rogue in the group. 
---
If you think these people are ninjas your just wrong.
---
I wouldn't transfer higher populated servers can be helpful, random guys can help you with quests, finding a team for dungeon will be alot easier erc
---
We did it yesterday, we were all 42/43.
---
We tanked it upstairs, helped a lot I guess, we had however pretty good dps (1 mage and 1 rogue on adds).
---
When he’s at 20% ignore adds and burn it down.
---
Learn to read dude. He literally said
---
"I mean, you can probably do literally anything and make more silver than the time it takes you to make it into bandages."
---
Love it :D
---
How would I recognize a Twink item?
---
Maybe he just swapped to dw fury his weapon skills were super low. 
---
Not that it excuses him for not sorting that out before joining a group.
---
Until you realize you need the scarlet key to open the boss rooms :(
---
Love getting me dick pulled
---
Yeah, that’s fine. It just doesn’t click like that for me. It’s cool if it works for other people.
---
What was the update that went out today? Anybody know why it deleted all my addons? Not just made them out of date
---
I made literally 80g at levels 42-44 without trying. It definitely won't take you until 45.. are you buying all your skills? Don't do that. Also don't buy stuff from the AH or to level your professions.
---
Probably that, but I enjoy my alts as well. I think it's more a cost investment psychology going on. You're almost there, so it's just one more sprint to the finish. You enter a voluntary crunch to see that sweet 60 victory ding. Those last 10 levels is when the 'live to win' music really kicks in.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
People that pull without mana or don't pay attention to it are awful.
---
I would say it was incomplete advice. While I agree with your example, it’s pretty specific - in this instance, there is only a 1 dps difference.  
---
Very rarely is this the case in my experience. At levels higher than 20 or so, dps differences from new weapons tend to be much higher. I’m commonly jumping 5 dps from weapon to weapon, and if the difference is big enough you’re gonna wanna main it.
---
Heavy ones. They both give the same increase per silk but are done twice as fast
---
The devilsaur set is expensive. i only have 100g and i have no idea how to get the money to buy that set :c
---
Desperate Prayer for humans and dwarfs is an instant cast full heal
---
I think the key part you're missing is an actual conversation with the tank.  We aren't mind readers, so we're guessing at what point you are comfortable with the next pull.  I've had healers that want full mana, and others that are good at 20%.  I am currently working with a shaman that tells me to pull by dropping a totem....its actually super convenient.  Just talk with the tank.  Most (not all, unfortunately) care about how comfortable you are with "the next pull".  BTW, thx for healing
---
Sweet. Appreciate the info!
---
But the rest of the game is a joke and serves only the purpose of getting everyone to max level the quickest. And they've streamlined every human interaction from the leveling process. It's a terrible experience compared to Vanilla and TBC.
---
Hey that’s my server! The server of queue times! Gratz man!
---
Yes I was thinking about the Ley Orb.
---
Which addon is it that gives you that nearby frame?
---
It's super easy to farm mats when you're a higher level and gold comes much easier. I average something like 5g/hr at level 50 with just skinning and selling drops.
---
Not everyone can 100% efficient run through a dungeon from muscle memory like the stuff you see in videos. The tank has the most complicated job and often needs to think it through to make sure no hiccups happen.
---
With a pally healer it's some really good conversion ratios at least. Mana efficient heals + life tap talents means a whole lot of mana for locks to throw around (as long as they don't go overboard). I used to main a lock back in vanilla and BC and now I main a holy pally.
---
20g for training; 80g for mount, without discounts. 10% discount on both purchases if you're honored with the matching reputation which shouldn't be too hard.
---
It was either heal or flash heal by the sounds of it. Either way if it has heal in the name probably important to interrupt it!
---
if it drops next week u buy one back for nearly the same price.  if it drops in a month you had a month to use that money and prob get one cheaper
---
warriors whirlwind is all targets but the limit on sweeping strikes means 5 at most is optimal.
---
If you only level through grinding from now, you will have the mount at 40. I spent those levels in Arathi Highlands killing elementals - earth ones to vendor stones during the day, fire ones in the late night/morning hours.
---
Thankfully this data shows 100% my milkshake brings all the boys to the yard
---
That's gayer than the middle man in a three man buttfuck.
---
I'll have to double check, but it usually only does around 50 threat for me - decreasing with each mob. Which a single *thwat* with a staff would pull.
---
Thunderclap is probably 30 for me.. so it doesn't make much difference.
---
A single aoe from a mage would be a couple hundred.
---
Are shamans in classic wow? Swear I’ve never seen one and didn’t see the class when making my character
---
Oh boo. Didnt know that.
---
Druid bis helm is like a level 44 blue (dps) which you literally never replace. Lol
---
War... war never changes...
---
Most people are still in their 30's. You can wait.
---
I think there is something like this actually. I can’t remember the name of it but I remember seeing it. If I find it I’ll share a link.
---
WoW 2. There always comes time when you just need to let it go.
---
Jack of all trades.... Master of none
---
I have been playing previously and it kept asking me to update to the newest OS for a smoother experience, so I did and now it won’t open. I’m on the newest OS
---
Show me logs for 17 kills in week 3 and I’ll consider this a very small potential to have been legitimate.
---
Google. Item will likely require a level of _8 or _9
---
/r/IAmVerySmart
---
Prat can do it I think and ElvUI chat settings can.
---
If they are going slow they are doing it for a reason.  
---
Most of the time the person with this exact mindset is the one who instantly ragequits when  the group wipes from rushing.
---
Mark skull, ignore it, build threat on the rest.
---
Sounds like a waste of 5 points tbh, Imp CS build is generally better imo.
---
Or just let the guards path up there? Na, we'll just punish the players.
---
I just hit 35 last night. Thoroughly enjoying taking it slowly as RL permits. It’s encouraging me to explore more and enjoy the game instead of smashing through the grind. 
---
Last night I wasted 2 hours in a bidding war over 8 items for a total potential profit of 73s... but it was a blast yelling at the other person in my head for their audacity to think they had a right to reduce my vendor margins. 
---
Enjoy the game!
---
The guards are very friendly to and offer information to all visitors.
---
How do you deal with Drakk's conflag with a 5-man?
---
I have other questions, but that one's the most important I think.
---
nice try, sassafrassin. I'm on to you
---
I'm surprised disliking questie is a controversial opinion here, thought this sub was all about the Authentic Classic Experience.
---
Excellent!
---
I do not know what quest you are asking about.  I can only say that I had a quest once where the quest window had what seemed to have a different layout.  It was the horde lore quest where I had to read a book and answere a question.  Well I answereed the question but he kept asking me tge question again.  There was a question mark that I could also click on that I wasnt.  I kept clicking the question again for some reason.
---
Eventually I clicked the question mark and it was completed.
---
I’m usually extremely skeptical of the armchair quack, but this seems really really on point to me. OP if you see this... don’t take  it likely! You have friends here and in wow :)
---
I consider the Auction House my extended bank. Anything I'm not sure about goes into it, I get money out. If I need something specific, I pull it out of the extended bank.
---
Just mind vision him and pretend it's your character
---
Spy addon also does this and has great alerts.  Has a list of nearby enemy players and warns you when people stealth, etc.
---
Running high level dungeons is usually profitable. Quests give gold when you’re max level. What are your professions?
---
Always hunters that ninja roll.
---
Reminds me of that bounty hunting quest in Fallout New Vegas where you had to kill some raiders and bring their heads back as proof.
---
Normally you'd loot their heads from their bodies, but if you killed them with headshots (which you were warned about), you'd loot an unidentifiable mess which would give you a lower reward.
---
I always use a dps meter in dungeons and it's not to feel superior to the balance druid as mage but because you do so little to the hp bar of a boss it's satisfying to see the damage you're dealing.
---
If you're feeling competitive it's also cool to compare yourself to other mages.
---
If it's a boss fight the tank should let you drink up until you're near full before starting the fight tbh. And if he dies because you don't have mana, that's his own fault.
---
Works fine. Even as MT yeah crushing blows suck but can be worked around. (Just more stressful on healers, but even in this level of gear, druid tanks take less damage)
---
In 5-mans no issues, higher threat than warriors by far. Higher armor + health pools do wonders.
---
Do you play Alli?
---
Keep on tranglin',
---
Larry Pat
---
Okay boomer lmao
---
It seems like it would be less resource intensive to fix those exploits than banning people who exploit them.
---
https://www.vpesports.com/dota2/news/chinese-dota-2-veterans-forge-a-region-first-wow-legendary
---
Read there, gg
---
I've never met a hunter is want to play with in classic/retail. Most selfish players by far.
---
Yeah, they really need to incentivize rolling on servers where the population is skewed.  Positive rewards for rolling the weaker faction, maybe even penalize people who roll dominant faction on a pvp server.
---
Nah they only were beast pve damage once they are way over-geared.
---
Sorry I might be misunderstanding. You had two raid groups and an alt group so 3 raid groups per week for two months, 8 weeks times 3 groups = 24 runs? I’m sure there was some extra runs but isn’t that sort of in line with the drop rate he’s quoting?
---
Back in vanilla druid on druid ganking was considered bad form. All other classes were fair game but druids of all factions were special and we respected and didn't kill each other for the most part. Time moves on though I guess.
---
&lt;3
---
RemindMe! 12 hours
---
Do you play Alli? Cause shammy are horde only in classic
---
It's so average, as are most world drop epics. Kinda disappointing tbh
---
On my server, I do alright selling stacks of medium leather. I vendor light leather because there’s nearly no profit in it.
---
The demo shout bug trained so many mages and warlocks to be a warrior's enemy.
---
I don’t have any idea what else it could be used for other than the purposes you mentioned. Maybe tailoring as well. 
---
I just wanted to chime in and say that I think silk will only go down in price. The popularity of SM farming from 30-40 is incredibly high, so the rate at which silk comes into the game versus demand will probably continue to worsen as time goes on. I’ve been selling mine as it comes in.
---
They're not all bad but the 95% that are spoil it for the rest.
---
Ah… but you don’t know, tank. You don’t know.
---
I like the same thing but use it to filter our guild spam.
---
Was crafted september 17th.
---
That’s what I had chalked it up to the first couple times, then it just kept happening. Super frustrating, now I’m having to corpse camp a rogue from his same guild for revenge
---
Best tank I ever grouped with would stop after a couple pulls and discuss what the group was seeing before he continued on. Adjustments would be made by some or all and it would normally be a smooth and efficient run. Teamwork and ability to adapt is key.
---
Is rogue better to level after 30 lvl? Im 25 and I’m having hard times killing stuff.
---
Hunters are idiots. Prove me wrong.
---
Get a PC.
---
True. I definitely can see how making tons of gold is thrilling, and it's definitely not for everyone.
---
You provided a quote, not a blue post; about esfands reset, not MC resets. 
---
Let’s not lump it all together.
---
I LOVED Heroic and Mythic raiding but it killed me inside having the bosses on farm in Heroic before we really dug into Mythics..
---
Killing the end boss for the first time on Mythic was generally at least the 10th time you’d killed him in LFR / Norm / Heroic and that really detracted from my experience.
---
Everyone I find that's rude is a frost mage or a gnome. And don't get me started on gnome frost mages
---
Don’t transfer off pagle. There is never a queue.
---
Lol ok old man
---
I guess my biggest problem with this is that they go at a speed that doesn’t allow you to get in a favourable drinking position.   I can sit and drink, but if you’re double charging both out of range and out of LoS, it’s making my job difficult.  If I take the time to get in a favourable position to stand and heal when needed, they assume I’m good and pull before I can sit down.
---
Stalagg? I know thotslayer
---
I mained a mage all through vanilla and can aoe just as good or better than anyone, it's how I made my vanilla gold and I enjoyed doing it and getting better, I even used engineering to help.
---
In tbc I went druid and tanked all the raids as the ot for my guild.
---
In classic I went druid again and the amount or mages that think it's faster to pull 4 packs and spend 10 minutes trying to kill them and almost dying, or 1 minute per pack just doing them regularly baffles me. It's not faster and you're all idiots. 
---
I did 3 mage, priest, feral tank zf rwice and it was a nightmare both times. Mages dont have a clue what they're doing period.
---
haha :D I am on a pvp realm, not an rp one sadly :(
---
To a lot of people, 'clearing the run' is the primary objective, not 'the tank must have perfect aggro on every single add through every single pull the entire run no matter the HP or the debuffs on the mob'.
---

---
Everyone in APES uses the BRE which says it all for me. Not only that, if you're an orc then +5 axes is dirty. I believe even Spinal Reaper has higher dps than Sulfuras if you are an orc.
---
This is exactly why I hate this "server/world first" bullshit, most people are just assuming it's them and it doesn't matter
---
Laughs in druid
---
The player takes the rage the warrior does not get. They're inversely proportionate.
---
Never got a BoE epic myself, did 1-60 and a bunch of dungeon runs a long the way :D.
---
You are very lucky
---
This video was hilarious!!! What software did you use for screen capture and edit?  Please make more!
---
It was mine, i dropped it accidentally just send it back by post and all is well with the world.
---
Silk Bags are just a side-hustle for him. He's an Alchemist and makes most of his money from Superior Mana Potions. He's not even max level yet so he's not fully operational.
---
I’ve had tanks charge at 70%, they don’t care.
---
It’s not that bad. I am L35 now and two maces can kill anything pretty fast. Random stuns also save me a lot of trouble.
---
Im sure you can recover them. Blizz should have an option or to contact someone
---
Yeah, the dynamic is definitely different when faction imbalance is really bad.  When it's close to 50:50 there are no major faction differences, but even 55:45 can feel bad, with 60:40 feeling oppressive.  Anything beyond is a joke.
---
Prat.
---
Yes, but you could use this points only on Rip until 34.  
---
And and this point it's better to use Claw instead of spending energy on Rip.
---
The dream is alive boys
---
I got just enough of Silk to turn it for every 4 capital reps, got waaaaay more Mageweave and sold all of them in the AH.
---
Please don't assume that every party is competent enough to not get blown up instantly without your babysitting...
---
I'm a shadow priest but damn I 100% would plop that in my bank for a few months then make some baaaaaaaaaank on it
---
Auctionator
---
Indeed. At it will never change.
---
Causing wipes are the problem. Do some single target on my marked mob for a few seconds then go ham with the aoe but pulling an extra pack with multishot, doting up the wrong targets or dropping a blizzard on mobs I've LoS pulled is fucking counter productive
---
Lock player here. Quick Q guys, does increase to magical abilities on items affect my shadow and fire spells? I know there are increase to shadow and increase to fire but what exactly benefits from increase in magic dog. Thanks!
---
Yes they can. Ravager can also proc of itself.
---
Turn it into bandages and vendor it. Youll get more for bandage stacks than silk stacks at the vendor.
---
I take it you mean dps was pulling.
---
Fuck'em. Sounds like a bunch if delusional douches who think they're the shit after they top meters in LFR or something.  Nothing wrong with leaving a group that treats people like that.  People like that cant hide behind server transfer and name changes in classic.  They'll either have a group of assholes to raid with and be contained from the people who can actually function in social situations, or theyll quit if they dont figure it out.
---
Or you're trying to destroy an item in your bag but you accidentally open up trade with someone then panic shut it =/ 
---
Back in vanilla I used to have randos walk up to me in a major city, open up trade and whisper (gold plz)
---
Imagine having fun in a game where you dont even get paid to play.
---
He is not right because there is a macro that destroys totems. I use it regularly
---
Players that spit on other players would say, "fuck you" instead if they could. It's openly disrespectful and he needed to be taught a lesson.

Sounds like you are compressing your stream too much, try increasing the bitrate.

I have auctionator and it doesn’t look that clean at all

Talent &lt;3
---
You're right! All the players bring that depth and breadth with them. Makes the game so much more than it would be otherwise.
---
"Magic damage" is the generic which will apply to all your schools of magic. Anything that specifies a school will only apply to that damage type.
---
Damn didn’t know
---
finally someone who have the same problem :D yeah ill tell you if i found a solution
---
Any tips for warrior leveling? Im about to be level 10 and im struggling.
---
You can only turn in stacks of cloth for rep once per faction for all cloth that isn't rune cloth. But a good idea nonetheless
---
the meme we all NEEDED. 10/10 post. you made my day
---
I would love to live in your head for 24 hours. I am sure it would be trippy!
---
Balance in all things
---
My suggestion would be to keep farming devilsaur leather, once people actually have money they’ll buy them for 300g per set... since your realm is lower population the economy hasn’t had a chance to build itself up! People don’t have the gold to buy items like this yet because no one is buying their stuff on AH either! Once the economy begins to thrive you can make thousands of gold if you keep farming
---
You mean, you want the right to be an asshole and get away with it?
---
Strong statement
---
&gt; It’s a World first, who cares? At least I would have done it legit, without having to buy suspected mats that were exploited.
---
That's up to blizzard to chase down cheaters and ban them. Not up to the community.
---
&gt; It’s not new content, it’s the same content for decades, please point out what’s new besides layering ( WHICH MADE EVERYTHING FUCKING EASIER), and some Qol adds.
---
Still changes things dramatically. Layering DOES make things easier, the knowledge makes things 100x easier. Hence why comparing days of old to now are two different things, as exactly you said.
---
Go ahead and finish the saying now.
---
If you don't know, the saying ends with "often better than the master of one."
---
I’ve run it 4 times now and never really had a problem forming a group for it. The quests aren’t too hard to get and there’s one that starts as a ZF quest anyway. 
---
There’s also a pre raid bis caster offhand iirc. And some decent 2h wraps. Not a ton of drops for me tho haha. The exp isn’t bad either bc you have to kill a lot of trash.
---
Waste on both tbh
---
Interesting. I have family that lives in Scio.
---
&gt; Scio is a city in Linn County, Oregon, United States. The population was 838 at the 2010 census.
---
I'll have to look into the word meaning. I wonder if Scio on its own means Shadow.
---
I always tell my grp:
---
Just take a look if I am sitting and drinking feel free to pull. I will tell you when I need more time.
---
Worked greatly so far.
---
&gt;*I was then buffed by a mage, priest, and paladin. They all bowed and ran away leaving me dumbfounded and laughing.* 
---
What am I reading incorrectly or not understanding. How were you buffed by an opposing faction? That was the implication, correct?
---
I've seen posts like these since 2004. But in a hunter's mind you are redundant since their pets tank. They just want to plow ahead.
---
In my experience it was you'll give up to ganking before you can start a quest. I was surprised to find Kalimdor areas chiller than STV
---
Haha ok you win, it could be worse.
---
They slither back at 60 begging for dungeons and I whisper down "no".
---
Raid flasks need this ingredient so they will be in demand.
---
Ooh what like? I know having a “non-lorey” name is one. Like “ipwnzjoo” etc.
---
used to main mage back in days. i see so many bad mages, it hurts.  but it comes just with expirience and not all are crazy about pvp. the best compliment i have goten in wow was while i was playing in popular WOTLK private server and some dude /w me and asked if i could teach him some mage stuff i asked why me and he said "well i play in hord side, and every time i see youin bg im scared, you like best ally mage" that felt good.
---
But now i play warr in classic and i  bet i showed some of my warr fights (never played warr before), the warr main would laugh at me seeing how bad i am. doing all the little and probably not so little things wrong.
---
Use a shield until about 15 when 2handers start to pull away from 1handers. Spam sunder.
---
Can confirm, account was hacked twice back in the day
---
One of my guild leaders kept a google spreadsheet rating all the members in different criterias like sociability/helpfulness/damage contribution.
---
I wished I was joking. The most embarrassing thing was that this was for a fucking mobile game and that dude took shit too seriously.
---
&gt;I'm considering holding onto it all on a bank alt and just auctioning it way down the line when it might be less abundant...
---
It's only going to get more abundant, not less. Have you considered making an alt that uses tailoring, and sending it to them to hold until they can use it to make bags to sell?
---
Otherwise, what others have already suggested would be your only other options.
---
If you want to PVP I would definitely switch to engineering. You’re early enough that you won’t be losing much investment in blacksmithing.
---
Wotlk was definitely 85- Mandela effect strikes again
---
FYI you don't need artisan skinning until mobs are around lvl 45, so save the gold until then. Thick leather which you'll start to see around lvl 35 is definitely more valuable than the lesser leathers, at least on my server (Benediction). Heavy leather is usually 2s per unit on the AH, a little more than vendor price, while thick leather is sometimes worth double the vendor price.

i mean it's china ofc they cheated 100% guarantee

Yea that's how addiction works.

Wait til 60.  A drakonid will 2 shot a mage.

I would have sabotaged the run if it was me experienced it. I would have been furious with their shitty behaviour. There are most certainly assholes out there and you met 2-3 of them.

Lvl 49 Hunter looking to see what dungeons/quests I should be doing for gear that will help my DPS 50-60

That is not what I meant, back in Vanilla there was an official Blizzard page where they had weekly rankings. For Example you could see which mobs killed the most players, most killed mobs, most crafted items and stuff like that.

This made me scared of having kids

What if it was an accident?

I bought a bow of searing arrows for 30g and don't really care that it'll slow me down on the mount thing. People my lvl are melting in world pvp and the camps are easier to control with it.
---
I was bs until about 125, and switched to engineering. Both are pretty expensive to max and engineering has some really useful stuff for endgame raiding and pvp (mechanical dragonlings, stuns from bombs) and blacksmithing can make one of the bis 2h weapons as a weaponsmith, and 2(IIRC) BIS plate pieces for dps. It really depends on how you want to play my guy. Forging those pieces yourself doesn't remove the difficult requirement of gathering the materials to make it, you can just pay someone a tip to make it for you. But the engineering items usually require a high engineering level to use. I went eng.
---
I thought you couldn't use it in combat.
---
For PvE sure. I was talking strictly PvP.

I provided a quote from a blue post, this blue post:

Hello guys - quick hunter question here - 
---
So i am using a Snow leopard that i tamed as soon as i ding 10 and completed the taming quest in the dwarfing area. and been grinding and upgrading his abilities as soon as i possible could (so has the most upto date growl, bite and a claw) and we are both lvl 25.
---
Now i noticed in Petopia it says the snow leopard i taimed has an attack speed of 2.0. should i just keep using my first classic pet or for better DPS and taime a nightsaber with 1.4 attack speed and grind him upto my level?
---
I like to just MC alliance and run them into the opposite instance 😂
---
Warrior leveling is a struggle until after level 30.
---
Pick up a 2H weapon. Always look for the highest damage, slowest swinging 2H you can. Put your talents into the Arms tree.
---
Secondary professions help a lot to reduce downtime. First Aid should be a priority, but fishing and then cooking what you catch can provide you with low cost food.
---
Use Sunder Armor over Heroic Strike when solo leveling. Heroic Strike not only costs a bit of rage, it replaces your Auto Attack which prevents you from generating more rage. The damage it adds is not worth the rage costs. Sunder Armor will increase the damage of your Auto Attacks and doesn't cost as much rage.
---
If you are willing to tank, you will find dungeon groups instantly. You don't need to be Prot spec to tank, just keep a shield and 1h weapon in your bag.
---
those fking ally fighting behind the BRD instance portal reeee
---
I’m the same as you Op. I have been roped into becoming a tank at 60 despite hating it and preferring to fury DPS. However the reason I hate it? Other players. Tanking is fun when they let you lead. It’s fun when they don’t make your life hell by going balls to the Wall DPS right off the bat. It’s always locks or mages in my experience. Locks I understand because they generate more threat than any other character by far. Mages though? Fuck no. All these idiots that run in and drop nova and cone of cold instantly make me face palm.  
---
And I’m too nice. I almost never speak up about it. I’m too worried they’ll be assholes and the entire experience could be ruined. 
---
From what my friends tell me though the mobs at 60 are for some reason feeling easier than lowbie dungeons. Like my buddy at 58 did UBRS and said he doesn’t remember how fast shit is dying there now. There’s no room for deaths from aggro gaining because the mobs just fall over instantly.
---
Completely agree with you about the auctioneer folk who try to make the AH more difficult to use for the average gamer. See my comment history for one such discussion. These people love defending themselves and their unsavory practices.
---
Legit, as a warrior, got the same drop yesterday. Not telling my lock friend or he will try to guilt me hahaha
---
Gee, who would have thought that the AOE SPELLCLEAVE crap is having a negative impact on how players do dungeons overall.  FUCKING SHOCKING!  /s
---
I dont know about you, but my 7 is far away for my 2, also didnt change to silver input variable for the 50 either. pretty obvious scammer.
---
The real market value is the current market value. The market value changes over time. There is no guaranteed stable market value.
---
Assholes can make up reviews to taint people rep as well. People following blindly and will continue to as long as there is someone doing the work for them.
---
Would also like to give props to healers that drink. Far to many times healers are into the dungeon and ask for water after just starting. Please prep yourself before entering dungeons
---
While you are most certainly correct, also remember horde outnumber alliance on basicly all servers, which means there are a bigger number (not percentage) of horde to do the ganking, and less alliance to receive them. Which means that eventually an alliance players will have received more ganks than a horde player.
---
So even though horde and alliance will gank as much percentage wise, horde does it in greater numbers.
---
Btw I honestly don’t care, you’re not going to convince me anything done in Classic is gonna be a world first since none of its new content, as soon as they release a brand new instance and you guys kill the boss, I’ll say congrats on World first, but if I’ve killed the same boss, or knows someone who has the same items from back in the day, it’s not a world first. Congrats on your server first tho. It was fun trolling you.
---
So if someone puts a min bid of like 1c on a stack of strange dust with a buy out of 30s. Could I bid 5c and if it isn't caught get the stole stack for super cheap?

But there is a macro
---
Remove All Totems
---
/run if not UnitAffectingCombat("player")then for i=1,4 do n="t"..i CreateFrame("Button",n,UIParent,"SecureUnitButtonTemplate")_G[n]:SetAttribute("type", "destroytotem")_G[n]:SetAttribute("*totem-slot*",i)end end
---
/click t1
---
/click t2
---
/click t3

/click t4

Because this macro uses SecureUnitButtons, it needs to be run outside of combat in the current UI session before it will work in combat.
---
I don’t ninja I just don’t tank for their group in the future. 
---
And it’s only when they’re being a douche and obviously tagging mobs so I can’t get any credit. I call it karma
---
Not in this phase. You'll be able to get +frost, or +shadow on random greens and some blues that have suffixes, but you won't get plain +spell.
---
I have to wonder what dungeons youre talking about. Because greater heal takes 3 seconds to cast, and these dudes pulling 3 packs at a time in ZF die in under 6 seconds without greater heal spam. if you go do that when I'm at 10%, youre ass is gonna be corpse running, but IDK maybe I just suck for not regening mana faster, or something.
---
It's not that hard (just make sure you get consecrate from holy and pure RF on).
---
Points in prot make life easier (redoubt for bigger pulls, improved rf for better threat, etc.) The main issue is people who think they can fight like it's retail. Oh and pulling hard without engineering or linkens boomerang.
---
You're not efficient if you're slow
---
I think the Blizzard dev teams stagnated solely because of greedy corporate decisions dished out by Activison-Blizzard. I only say that because I see tons of passion and work put into their games still. It's all misplaced, though.
---
he can invite who he wants but he set up a large portion of the players to recieve his rejection message.  but he was polite about at the end.  
---
kind of unrelated but is wow some kind of communist / social score / racist hell hole?  im asking myself this
---
rambling....
---
also how are mages spell cleaving effective time wise?  it must be so though or they wouldnt do it.  because every time i look at a mage in a dungeon he sitting there drinking.  their faces so parched all the time.  thirsty bastards.  as a healer i like having a lock cause i can heal him a bit, he life taps and we keep rolling.  having a mage slows it down is my impression.  could replace the mage with someone who isnt mana starved all the time and he could dps nonstop.  always drinking.  and whats with those guys rarely giving out drinks or buffs?  i got an idea why and its not that they are bad people.  its that without mana the mage is nothing and buffing people drains it and leaves them empty.
---
i gotta make a mage and learn what its like
---
Yeah sword and board for the most part, have a shield spike but I'm slowly incorporating switching in a two-hander for my stance dance WW. This was mainly a post about a dps warrior who barely out dps'd me as a tank, I don't feel that I'm a slow tank and there isn't much downtime in between pulls. I stopped for my blood rage CD before a large pull and he exasperated about the dungeon taking too long.
---
A huge part is 60% of the warriors that I heal for just uses 2h instead of using an actual shield.
---
And the main problem for me tanking as a Druid trying to maintain aggro is the dungeon is too high level for me. All you see if dodge/parry/resist. If you are underleveled vs the dungeon, things are going to be hard.
---
Thanks for answering! I have it at 6000 kbps and my upload is 600mbps twitch has a 6k cap or it wont load the stream :(
---
3 bags, 2.5g each is 7.5g, couldn't he have just messed up and typed 750 in g rather than 7g 50s?
---
That seems more likely to me than them thinking you would fall for sending 750g, or am i naive?
---
And then they ask why you have Anathema out.
---
No it's not bad at all man. No one wants to or has to deal with that. Their blacklist means nothing and you have your side of the story. They're just salty fucks. Don't feel bad.
---
Seems like a bad "scam" what is the likelihood the unsuspecting person has 750g
---
Shield from eranikus can last you until draconoid. If you get a +def ring with str/stam or agi/stam from patrolling dragons, they will last you for a long time
---
I'm not 100%. But from experimenting with trying to swap layers and with data from the Census addon before it got killed. Servers seem to currently be two ~6000 player layers making server sizes ~12,000 players.
---
In the first week or two it was larger, there were def more layers and the census data shows more concurrent players back then.
---
I found what it is, it was a technical shorthand for a value that failed to load for me.
---
While blizzard does less moderation classic, There's legit no way in hell blizzard lets things like this slide. Especially considering the amount of logs they keep of the new classic client vs the old one.
---
And yeah, most def a scammer.
---
On the other hand I don't know why mages don't drink after a pull.
---
Like they'll pull mobs immediately and suck healer mana and then when we clear combat they just stand there looking at their penis meters while the rage pile I happened to get vanishes
---
Wait for the tank to get threat, drink after a pull, and your dps becomes literally irrelevant.
---
I'll usually say at the beginning of the dungeon "make sure to see my mana, wait for more than 50%mana only on bigpull and instacharge if I say r" working well so far
---
The pace should be dictated ultimately by the healer's mana only.  In my groups chain pulling, the quick mages aren't even there all the time.  Bottom line rushy DPS is never good under any circumstance and that's what this post is about.  Shitty mages with zero self awareness are something my party members can recognize almost instantly because of their lack of understanding this.  If a group is too slow for you, leave.
---
Yes but gl winning it
---
The Horde were better as evil marauders that sent kamikaze goblins and raised dead knights and infused them with annoying bullshit tornado magic.
---
Unfortunately running doesn’t build much muscle
---
It makes you keep a cool head because you're already used to dying.
---
It also teaches you how to pull off cheely stunts that can mean the difference between wiping or everyone surviving with like 10 hp
---
Yeah cause some talents specifically say things like "would give xp" but this one is different  in the way its worded. No one plays with spirit tap at level 60 so I wasnt sure if it even worked
---
protip for alliance players:
---
it's cheaper (and usually quicker) to get from darnassus to southern kalimdor by taking the boat from auberdine to menethil and then the boat from there to theramore
---
Shhhh
---
*downvotes*
---
Is a priest
---
Rage entanglement.
---
For my human me and my sword I know it ain’t 9% ;)
---
Well if you plan on tanking/ retribution you’ll be hunting for gear with strength and seal of command goes off weapon damage.
---
While righteousness is off spell power
---
Have I done research not really but..
---
I plan to hunt the Lightforge set and go for the lava stone hammer
---
As for rings and beach pieces I’ll go after spellpower.

&gt; Blizzard's philosophy of "everyone gets to see all the content no matter how bad at the game you are" has just destroyed any sense of challenge in the game. 
---
EXACTLY i dont like transmog that much (its pretty cool but whateves) but seeing that dude in ogrimmar or SW that had the hulking plate gear he got from doing the new raid was a phenom that is no forgotten, joining a guild to raid meant a sense of community, forcing yourself to work with these people rather than queing for LFR, they wipe 2/3 of the group leaves and now you wait forever to even move on, all with no communication it sucks man i really dont like the game being that way and i really hope blizzard makes the right move, plus bungies seperation from activision talking about how they were restricted and forced into microtransactions makes me feel that blizz shouldve never been apart of activision
---
That’s not what ur previous reply said before u deleted it, 2.50 each x3 is 7.50 its more likely he accidentally put the full amount in the gold section and didn’t split into the silver.
---
I don’t know about you but if I was trying to scam trade chat people who wanna buy bags for 2.50 I wouldn’t put in 750g, such a high amount that most wont have.
---
Now, if he did 25.50 then I would say he was a scammer.
---
I got the "Edgemaster's Handguards" the other day - its currently offered for 400g at the AH on my server - Do you think the price should go up for that item - Its the mail glove that increases weapon skills for axe, swords and daggers by +7.
---
Strange, I’m 55 and already friendly. Do all your class quests at appropriate levels? Do the quest at the end of Mara?

Nah you don’t need prot for dungeons. Spamming dungeons isn’t a bad idea though. Start with getting your princess ring and stuff from BRD, and as you get higher start with LBRS/strat/scholo
---
If I'm pulling big aoe pulls, my healer will need to heal me almost immediately if the mages slack off on the nova
---
You will be bouncing between zones and doing a few quests here at there at that level. Upper Stranglethorn Vale, Desolace, 1K Needles, Shimming Flats, and Hillsbrad Foothills all have quests in that level range.
---
There are also a number of dungeon options at that level if you'd rather not bounce around so much. Several people have leveled from 30-40 entirely in Scarlett Monastery. Gnomeregan, Razorfen Kraul, and a little while later Razorfen Downs are all good options as well.
---
Technically 44 is considered halfway time wise so you almost made it halfway
---
They promoted the priest to leader on accident so now they can't kick him
---
Opinions are like assholes, everyone has them and they all drink. Except Kim Jong
---
It was probably just Heal. It heals for about 500 at that level which is most of a priests healthbar, and there's the chance it crit too which would definitely put him to full.
---
Without shitty DPS sucking down the healer's mana and breaking up cleave groups, even bad tanks are fast in comparison.  You are throwing a lot of shade for him not specifying how he pulls with a good group.
---
Lol. Rogue main for 15 years but yeah, never played combat.
---
Even entering stealth slows your levelling speed, the damage boost from an opener isn’t worth the time lost moving slowly into position.
---
The only time I enter stealth when levelling is to skip mobs entirely to get to a quest objective or when I need to sap to deal with a tricky group.
---
Mana doesn’t appear???
---
I would be expecting a value of 7.50 which 25.50 would not be, 750 looks closer to 7.50 than 25.50 does.
---
It's the third rule of thermaldynamism
---
Unfortunately not a world first. Perhaps an EU first though, congrats!
---
This exact ring dropped for me off a naga in STV yesterday. The random rogue I was questing with won the roll. That bastard.
---
Woah wait ... like, a collection of these kinds of images or a proper story with characters and all that?
---
For 2hander you only need the yellow cap which is 9% for 300 weaponskill and 6% for 305.
---
For duelwield you can go above this because hit always helps.
---
I'm rolling a 1h arms toon (for leveling) and plan to tank. I'm sure I need to get better, but at least I know not to pull as if we are top leveled and experienced retail players. If I don't get the hang of it, I'll probably switch specs to prot.
---
So, you may only pvp in areas with guards? Cause if you pvp somewhere where guards can't go its an exploit, guess we'll only pvp in bigger cities now xD
---
Desolace or Stranglethorn Vale
---
Never had any interest in Runescape. Saw that mspaint looking game some 15+ years ago and couldn't understand the appeal.
---
But for real, rolling on a pvp realm then cowering behind guards, just go play a pve realm if you arent interested in pvp.
---
If you have it down to a science, you want to take no fall damage, and still get the forward movement across the ground to be most efficient.
---
Good tip! Got about 200 so far now back to my regular grind
---
Screw maces.
---
That's a name I haven't heard in a long time
---
It sounds like you would enjoy retail. You should check it out
---
Spellcleaves are very efficient. In SM Cath for example, you can pull the entire instance in like under 10 pulls, takes very little time and massive xp per hour. Don't even need a tank.
---
High quality content.
---
Needs a big section for "You used bloodfury then pulled aggro"
---
Arms isn't much worse than Fury for leveling, and those talents will indeed help you with Rage when stance dancing.
---
I think you’re missing the point, have a good day.
---
Look at them farmers.....they spawn like imps.
---
Yeah and the mage is 20 levels above you and has a warrior buddy, you lose, correct. What an inane discussion.
---
I respecced away from healer for this reason. Healing is easy enough that most just heal in off specs so there seems to be an abundance of healers whilst levelling. The only thing really in demand are tanks (still)
---
&gt; Btw I honestly don’t care, you’re not going to convince me anything done in Classic is gonna be a world first since none of its new content,
---
Better swing that by Method then. Their "Race to World First" was a pretty big deal and they made pretty big bank off of it.
---
Make your own group and watch it fill 4/5 within a minute. The tank'll join maybe a min or two later depending on the time of day.
---
Seriously, stop expecting everyone else to work for you, you have the 2nd best role for making grps and you're talking about struggling finding groups.
---
The two raid groups ran splits and alts  by about the 4th week. So you had something like 2,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,6,6. By the 11th week of raiding, sulfuras was built. 
---
We did it for gold and bindings more than ingots, 5x pugs at 25g/item adds up quick
---
Yeah. Truth be told, I'm just too lazy to draw two detailed figures on the same page so I'll take any artistic liberties I can if it saves me a little time :P
---
My opinion: don't bother with professions until you're 60, then do them with a mount (ofc theoretically already possible around 40). You'll have enough to do at 60, but you'll find time for professions. Right now it counts more to get to 60. At least in my opinion.
---
They care immensely if a world first [x] was achieved through means not in line with the ToS and reviews any first boss kill or other signifact feat, and that’s why a number of world firsts in the past have ended with players getting banned
---
the most efficient way to do group quests is with a full group not a group of 4 or less.
---
Hit things + get hit = maximum rage generation.
---
I would be expecting the C.O.D to total out to 7 gold 50 silver, he puts 750 since it looks a lot closer to 7.50, and if i would possibly have it he would profit it, if he puts lets say 50 gold i would be less likely to fall for it since the visual diffrence is so massive.
---
WoW has a very large fanbase in China. I mean, when the Warcraft movie was shown, lots of things like this happened in movie theaters.[warcraft movie fan with glaives](http://image.zzd.sm.cn/14888376114712052803.jpg?id=0&amp;width=510)

May be more worth your time to hit up SM Armory for a shot at the Ravager.
---
Lots of boomers in this thread
---
Equip it and enjoy your life!!
---
Blizz is going to ban as many bug abusers as they can
---
I assume you're talking about big aoe group runs, you'd have to wait for mages to get 100% mana for each big pull anyway haha
---
Meanwhile I'm in a pug with another mage that blasts me for not doing enough damage because he was blizzarding on pull where I was single targeting the mob the tank had focused and waiting to start casting until he go a hit or two in.
---
I still don't understand the cognitive dissonance required for him to not realize the reason he was dying on EVERY trash pull. Yeah dude, totally my "low" damage not your pulling aggro with aoes.
---
Is it even possible to successfully bid on something? I've got a feeling that there are literally hundreds of people to outbid you as soon as you have shown some interest even to the shittiest stuff. And if not so, anyway it will cancelled by a seller.
---
False
---
Morally grey btw
---

---
If you don't use the launcher, how will you get game-updates?
---
Completely disagree. I find the 5man dung running to be the best part of WoW, and I specifically rolled tank so I can set up the speed. Goal is to be *effective*, that doesn't mean wipes. It means you can charge in and do pack of 3 ghouls while mage has 0% mana, because the 4 other are good to go. You can do range pull and run behind the corner wile 2 of your spellcasters have 50% mana, because no one is supposed to do anything for next 5-8 seconds anyway until they reach the corner. When it's most effective to pull, I pull(/charge). Sometimes that means everyone have full health and mana, more often that's not the case.
---
It's definitely a small minority who have made a problem out of that, and it's been clear they are just plain wrong. I'm not here so mage can feel more important about themselves because we wait 20s for his mana between every pull. If due to my pace the instance ends 5 min faster, that's success. Not because we saved 5 minutes, but because it felt like the run moved forward at steady pace, so people didn't have to alt-tab and lose focus as much.
---
If you are doing the instance for first time, scratch all that. You want to learn what packs can be accidentally double pulled when charged in and you don't can't really know all that. Or you don't remember which units will fear and do other nasty stuff. That's when you do almost only corner pulls. I'll keep pulling screeching gargoyles 10 seconds back every time because fear is deadly. I will wait mage to have 100% mana before I pull the reanimated corpse  room at the bottom of Scholo. You adapt to situation, but you do it wrong if you play every run like you do your first. Optimizing your play feels right.
---
You will have issues finding tanks wherever you go, even on 10k queue servers, it's just in the nature of classic.
---
two bears high fiving
---
Yup lol, people are getting banned for farming dungeons via layering, meanwhile if you layer and farm mats/rare mobs etc in the open world it’s all fair game. Seems weird
---
Brack rotus please
---
You're getting bored because you play alone. Try questing and dungeons with other people, thats whats missing.
---
My point is not about the rules, they are good.
---
What I'm saying is that it doesn't make any sense to lock down threads *after so much time*, I've seen it happen only recently.
---
Deleting shit posts as soon as possible is the way to go, IMO ofc.
---
Most leather is vendor trash depending on your server.  I didn’t start to see it AH more than it vendors until I started to skin Thick and Rugged leathers off 40 plus mobs
---
Yup same boat, already uninstalled.
---
I always think that on the log across the waterfall in feralas.
---
Definitely considering going for the raptor mount as a forsaken at some point. Trolls get the best mounts but I don’t like the troll models or animations.
---
I sold mine for 125g
---
All this effort for 1g20s?
---
Mage secret portal trainers? Go on...
---
I'll be looking for some of these tonight thanks!
---
Funny that I happen to be a player on Blaumeux Alliance side and I am a warlock.  
---
I can help you, but I can't help you right this moment.  
---
Sawyer#5623 on discord.
---
and only 4 are PVE ?
---
it will be less abundant and have a higher price, this is because the silk lvl range will become less populated and the gold ingame will become greater, supply shortens and inflation with enough demand.
---
For dungeons I honestly prefer a bear to most warriors.  So they’re fine
---
Need more updoots. Seriously what is endgame going to look like when us normies get there?  All mortal strike and blizzard, seems like.
---
no im more talking about groups with 5 different classes that want to play pretend that theyre mage aoe groups, i.e. 3/4ths of all the pugs ive had so far in classic, at least since SM
---
That’s what I’m saying. We’re so far from the end that they don’t have to think about it yet
---
naxx should be way more challenging in vanilla, i heard most people didnt even get to step in there the difficulty was rough, LFR is  a joke i can put someone on follow blizzard trash while watching netflix, and only do my rotations on boss, all for a RNG "Chance" to get a piece of gear that has a "chance" to be the titanforged/gemmed/whatever other stats i want instead of having a chance at one boss dropping one item, the other boss another item etc. LFR is dead easy and the RNG is a joke
---
They sound like idiots so no harm in leaving them
---
Id hit em with a wand just once so they dont have to wait through the whole CC. I thought there was a hard cap of 8 seconds on CCing a player but nope. Got sheeped and was out for like 22 seconds while his buddies got ready to gank me.
---
Not just the same class but same race, hair style and color and pretty sure the same face, with the same name.  History repeats itself.
---
Priest heals are way more massive in classic and they crit big time.  Going from zero health to max is not uncommon
---
Note: if you have to drink after every pull, someone is screwing up big time.
---
Okay I added on Discord, let me know when you can.
---
Just to clarify I only need to be in a party with someone, you don't have to be within range or anything
---
And yet they still have masses playing on NA realms
---
I don't think either the diva healer posts or this post mentioned melee cleaves.
---
So many troll resource nodes in Azeroth
---
There is no reason to ever assume an enemy player will be peaceful on a PvP server.. you don't have to attack them on site unless you want too and the same goes for them. That goes for alliance and horde players.. I dont understand taking it so personal and feeling so betrayed. Just can't relate. 
---
Inb4 I'm just a dirty horde who would have done the same thing.
---
I don't think this is an exploit of mechanics since literally anyone can get up there and you can still target them as a ranged aswell.
---
It's only a struggle if you're melee.
---
Laaaaaag
---
Nah, you were just blacklisted by a group of assholes, nobody needs their toxicity
---
I’ve revolutionized Retribution Paladin. I don’t bring damage or anything but in between my 3.8 second auto attacks I can post two memes in the raid discord.
---
No it won't.
---
They didn't break /who function. No positive change will become of this.
---
No I meant strictly how broken is the ability. Like throw it on Warlock for example. Since obviously we dont have DKs and the 3.0 DK kit was broken as fuck anyways.
---
For leveling go right to heart of the wild first. Then omen. Then Furor. You do shift out to heal but getting heart of the wild first will overall improve the leveling experience. 
---
Item wise druids aren’t super dependent on items. I did fine on quest items and world green drops.
---
If you need the gear roll need.
---
Run full Mara for the quest bow reward. Might even get the ring from princess.
---
it generates high threat, is in melee range only, and is oneshotted
---
Ashenvale or farm SFK
---
Uldaman, Zul'Farak, Maraudon are good dungeons.
---
In a few levels you can start Blackrock Depths, which is where the a lot of good pre-raid loot starts to drop.
---
Have you seen metzens drawings? They are far from amature level in any capacity. Is he an amazing artist? No, but he also didn't have time to polish his skills like samwise who was a full time artist.
---
But at the time they were pretty equal.
---
Look at this paladin done by metzen.
---
https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/wowwiki/images/9/94/PaladinW2.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20080108103523
---
Then look at this ghost made by samwise around the same time.
---
http://i.imgur.com/YrqMxTp.jpg
---
They are very similar, with metzen having harsher lines.  
---
But was samwise that much better at the time?. Not really.
---
Why do you need twinks for bgs?
---
Inb4 "It's my sister"
---
You can level as fire or single target shatter (frost) spec and be just fine.  You don’t need to AOE.  In fact AOE has many drawbacks to it that may slow down your leveling ... (accidental deaths,  resists,  other people camping spawns,  if PvP sever you will get ganked etc)
---
to be fair greater heal is 2.5 with the holy talent that you’d probably have maxed by ZF
---
All the good players are on PvP-realms. No tryhard player in their right mind would ever roll on a PvE-realm in Classic. 
---
Cutting most of the content the game has to offer in the process
---
Even back in the day there were not many PVE servers. This stayed the same after the services were transferred from 9th City to Netease. Kinda makes sense they still don’t have many now.
---
That's mint. Love the dueling vid too. Subscribed :)
---
Pummeler only has 3 uses if I recall.  You are honestly better off not bothering.  Nothing should require you to use that.
---
You are the kind of person that will complain when I sell portals for 1g - Standard answer - then walk ! :D
---
The thing is, i used Beast Lore on the one i tamed, and it shows.  
---
[https://imgur.com/BDlJiy6](https://imgur.com/BDlJiy6)  
---
Havent learned shit yet
---
I didnt notice the design oversight 15 years ago, but mages save me money in dungeons while warlocks cost me money, but the mage still usually does more dps.
---
Inb4 "Good job anyway dude"
---
Huh, TIL, thanks
---
You cant be fucking real. I'm being pranked.
---
I'm not bothering with your dumbass anymore. Holy shit.
---
"Next Page" button exists on the auction house. Just click it a few times lmao
---
We veteran healers don't mind if you tank with two hand fury spec, just stay in defensive stance and have a shield at the ready. The best defense is a good offense of quickly dispatched mobs imho.
---
Queuing up heals for one guy constantly is way easier and more mana efficient than fast healing everyone else cuz you don't have agro.
---
He asked what level its possible, not for your opinion on how he should play the game.
---
Holy priest here approving, I’m just saying “r” everytime, usually about 5 secs after the pull, and when I know its gonna be hard I, I Can Wait until 80% or such
---
Yeah, you're a complete dumbass. Most likely Warden has already sniffed out your shitty WinAPI calls that you call a fishing bot, hashed them and flagged them. Next time you're going to fish with the bot, there's probably going to be a real person reviewing you.
---
I hope you get banned
---
All the raid bosses are immune to the proc though, no?
---
In all seriousness, nubs and idiots who think they know how to vanilla are not even close to the same thing. Nub on bro we were all new once.
---
Have you never used the auction house before?
---
People don’t pve as arms because mortal strike takes a debuff slot. It’s good if not better than fury for dungeons due to ww and sweeping strikes
---
Market value isn't static, value right now and in several months are wildly different. You don't just say oh well I know oil is gonna be really expensive in 100 years, right now we're just way under market value.
---
I didn't start making money until Thick Leather on Kirtonos Horde. Light, medium, heavy were all at or just above vendor value. Then Thick is selling for ~1.25g/stack. You can get up to level 47 or so mobs workout upgrading skinning.
---
Who gives a fuck if you were the asshole? Your playstyles clashed. 
---
I have put people on ignore / blacklisted them. And I bet I've been put on ignore / been blacklisted. I don't want to play with those people (or their friends who share the same mentality), so a blacklist honestly helps me. 
---
Only if you constantly are being blacklisted you need to reevaluate your behaviour.
---
Well, apparently you were uncapable of coming to that conclusion by yourself and instead decided to ask a question answered multiple times in this post.
---
Holy shit dude meaning the lv53 warlock in darkshire killing all the lowbies from on top the building should be banned to hell. Good to know lol
---
You can communicate with allys, i was shouted at "yOu SucK" or something
---
Typical horde
---
Paladins get concecration at level 20. With that you can tank all the way up to level 60 dungeons pretty easily. Jist dont expect to tank raids
---
Smells like layer abusers to me!
---
That’s normal, especially if you are just chilling and enjoying the game
---
If you wanna go hardcore grind reach max level quick there’s ways to go faster, but that is not what Vanilla is about 
---
Most people are still 30-40ish
---
&gt;I trusted a Horde-Player
---
well there's your problem right there, ya' can't trust the greenskins :p
---
Actually at about 36-40 we start becoming a class. After that its really fun and youre no longer an auto attack bot that can only solo one mob 2 levels below you without bandaging.
---
Should work then! Might just be a game of patience. I believe I read that if you melee the mob alongside your pet you’ll learn their abilities sooner (something to do with proximity). 
---
Also, keep checking your beast training. You could miss it landing there if your chat log is busy. 
---
Happy hunting!
---
I had never thought about prioritizing sunder over heroic strike...you make a really good argument here.
---
This , basically.
---
&gt; People have been told since 2004 that just cause it's in the game doesn't mean it's okay to exploit if it's clearly unintended. Apparently they still don't get it.
---
No, I get it, I do. It's just that I think this shouldn't be a thing since it is an incredibly fucking stupid way to handle things, that's all.
---
Chinese gold farming was a thing back in vanilla. We all talked about it:)
---
That was the worst thing I have ever seen in my entire life. Upvoted
---
With these kind of posts I’m just in the mindset of the healer and the tank have to be looking at each other judging what the other can handle and what their skill level is at. Some healers won’t know how to do this well and some tanks won’t know how to pull relating to a healers mana and skill. It’s all about observing the other to see what the other can handle. If both do that you’ll have a great run. Unless the DPS somehow fuck it up. :(
---
Rogue would be vastly different and you could accomplish something in that time as opposed to warrior which are tough to lvl until ~30.
---
Is that how it's spelled in game?
---
If it's that big of an inconvenience, take the 8 seconds out of your life and install the addon and stop crying.
---
"BuT iDoN'T wAnT tOo"
---
Then stop crying and live with your mildly inconvenienced life.
---
Yes it is. I don’t like the development of stories and lore but seeing such dedication to the WoW universe still makes me shed a tear. WoW is a very important part of youth for many Chinese players.
---
Looks like auctionator and the bag is bagnon.
---
I'm sure it's different based on server but for me the only leather I've been selling on the AH are Thick Leather and Rugged Leather. Each have been selling for about 1g 35s a stack. You can definitely make money selling the other ones but I just didn't see it as worth it as it was only a few extra silver compared to just quickly selling it to the vendor.
---
I'm with you but this is Blizzard's problem. They could have made different guards that can kill you from anywhere. Why not just have some flying guard that's above the town that kills people who try to get on top of buildings.
---
The game rules are the only rules and if you can do it in the game that's a mistake on the part of the developer.
---
That being said people should stop being dicks to other people.
---
I plan to level my Shaman as enhancement with some points in resto talents with a focus on group play and dungeons. I feel like it's the only spec that for me would really hit that hybrid feeling.
---
I see the character being able to be a main healer in a dungeon or a dps that can provide a high level of support through totems, off-heals, and even off-tanking in some situations.
---
I'm wondering though at what point would it be wise to actually start putting points in restoration talents? And when should I really worry about maintaining a solid set of healing gear to switch to for when I play a dungeon healer?
---
It wasnt.
---
I believe the only rules are around PvP and kill-trading for rewards.
---
Congratulations, friend.  I have yet to dig 24!
---
You don't need twinks at all, but they are a very popular thing to make. His wording seems off because twinks are literally useless until they can queue for BGs.
---
Do the SM quests soon or in a lil while the RFD quest to get a Sword of Omen or Vanquishers sword :)
---
I have never used, nor have I seen anyone else use, a layer changing addon.
---
Just say "Layer invite please - Kalimdor/EK" and then you'll get an invite. No need for an addon...
---
The memes are strong here. Great vid man
---
Don’t transfer to a lower pop server, especially if you don’t have queues.
---
Most toxic mmorpg community ever. By far.
---
Here's the thing about your own experiences with social expectations meeting the world of MMO groups. This is your game time as much as it is theirs. You should always be open to playing with others in an MMO, but if you're not enjoying yourself, go find something else you do enjoy. These guys were making it easy to dip by being unreasonable asshats, but sometimes it's not so easy to tell if someone's taking advantage of your good will, patience, or time. A good barometer is within reach at all times - your own fun. No one should be miserable playing a game.
---
The benefit of leveling crafting professions now is that the mats are dirt cheap.   I feel like I can buy mats, vendor what I craft, and break even.  In 6 months that will not be the case, and you'll be spending money to level professions.
---
I know how u feel, I only hv a laptop that's 11 years old. Wow runs so bad in it but it's all I can get right now :D
---
Rogue, priest, mage Druid
---
I’ve definitely seen you at least three times while leveling
---
Okay then. What is “optistic”?
---
Yea man for you though I'd recomend saying at the beginning of the dungeon, "hey guys I'm new at the game so please be a little patient". If you do that i guarantee 9 times out of 10 you wont get any abuse at all and you'll get a lot of people giving you advice. Most people dont like giving advice in groups because most "veterans" take it as a personal insult. But if you say you're new, you'll prob get a lot of great advice.
---
Yikes.
---
/who still works, it just is a protected function that addons are not allowed to utilize.
---
I'd do thousand needles/shadowfang keep then hillsbrad. Thousand needles is more compact than Ashenvale imo
---
if anything, if I saw a lvl 7 in STV I would be amazed, and help them

---
"Am I?"

God I miss MW2, the new Modern Warfare is not even coming close with all the changes to ADS and sprinting. RIP my beautiful prince.
---
Yeah, I had a guy in my group with that add-on.
---
Thanks!!!  There's some super cheap Thick Leather on my AH. I'm going to see if I can try to start controlling that market.
---
I think we've drilled down to semantics at this point, but taking a developer and QA team away from implementing new content to repair an infrequent issue is often not worth it to the players, let alone to the bean counters. There is an opportunity cost to consider.
---
Only need to remember library and graveyard. Other two have their names in the tooltip of the doors
---
Auctionator and the bag looks like bagnon
---
which quest is that?
---
no it dosent I remeber having like 8min res sickness at 19
---
Try it out! You will have much more Rage and you will be surprised about how much damage it adds, especially to high armor targets!
---
This is how I imagine players are when they 2v1 me when I’m half health fighting 2 tigers in STV. Cool, you did it, you’re so good.
---
You wanna keep an alternative int gear set (0cloth or leather) as early as your first dungeons. Basically any quest reward you have to keep in mind both specs and hoard healing gear instead of vendoring them. You really don't have to have resto talents to heal properly till late game dungeons but gear will help a ton.

A Comic Book made from scratch in this art style with its own characters. The current description is as follows:  
---
**Set within the World of Warcraft universe, we'll join two groups of characters as they embark in a journey filled with hardship, strife and unexpected lessons.**  
---
**One group start their journey in the harsh, rugged land of Durotar, home to the newly settled orcs of Draenor and the native Darkspear trolls. However, the winds are changing, and they utter words of dark, wicked forces gathering within the great Horde's home, Orgrimmar.**

**The other group are brought together in the seemingly peaceful Elwynn Forest which shelters the mighty capital Stormwind City. But all is not well in the shining jewel of the Alliance as rumors have it that the king, Varian Wrynn, has gone missing.**
---
**Though worlds apart, both of these parties will realize that old wounds never heal.**  
---
**They will learn that it is in time of peace that you must prepare for war.**
---
I might choose to remember this player in the future, then.
---
Or perhaps there are a lot of chinese living on the west coast?
---
No they're great. They have the highest single target DPS in the game. idk what this guy is on to think theyre trash (although personally I'm not a fan of sword builds for rogues
---
There is no item level on them. There’s a level requirement, that’s all
---
Weird flex, but ok
---
Blizzards ToS changed in 2012. Prior to that cross faction collusion was bannable, and was enforced. At least on the PvP server i played on people got banned for doing things like paying rogues to sit on their factions world buff hand in, paying for devilsaur guards, etc.
---
Here's proof; https://imgur.com/a/kF930k8
---
Honestly don't know if it's bannable nowadays, i would assume and hope so tbh because it's scummy as hell and incredibly widespread in top guilds to lock down materials so they can own specific markets.
---
On PvE use it every time it's available on a full health move.
---
 This will increase overall playtime DPS thus faster leveling.
---
I was grinding fishing in Undercity, and got at least 20 Old Skulls and two Old Teamster's Skulls
---
no but ask your mage for water and he will give you.
---
it's not fun drinking alone.
---
Actually, I’ve seen some guides floating around on shaman tanking :p i think it’s possible to make it work while leveling if you put in the effort
---
not if theres no mages in the party they arent. my point is, the majority of tanks ive encountered so far treat every group like its a well practiced cleave on comms and then want to blame everyone but themselves when we die over and over again despite being told to slow the hell down.
---
Ah, need addons for it. All good, I'll check when Im home from work.
---
some people are not trolling, they are just stupid
---
Thanks, mate!
---
Oh, yet another one of your type here. Everyone far ahead of you must be cheating or exploiting layers or something.
---
I've had my Mistsaber as a Gnome for a week. There has been plenty of time to farm thousands of gold.
---
Just stop with this shit on this sub.
---
That is when you group up. Just did them yesterday. No probs.
---
Anecdotally because I don't have the link, but the last server pop thing I saw showed Alliance massively out numbering horde on pve servers. Like 65%+ of the pve population. PVP servers favor horde but not nearly as extremely. And pvp/pve the highest horde pop server was something like 70% horde. The highest alliance pop server was a whopping 98 some odd percent. I luckily have found myself on a very balanced pop server. 
---
And didn't most of the "world first" to lvl 60 players play alliance? I wouldn't say Horde has it easier leveling wise. Sure the barrens is a huge node of quests but it takes so long to finish out the barrens, running around.
---
It's also BIS for a while as a Locks and sPriests.  Very nice ring, great find u/Lumdor !
---
You are really that lucky.
---
Aparantly I am the only one who does
---
Well it is a good thing the guy you replied to never claimed it was
---
Unless you're ok with wearing leather, Fury warrior DPS isn't viable in raids until you have gear from AQ.
---
If you're ok with wearing leather I believe you can get enough +hit to raid viably, but you'll have a lot of agi
---
pretty sure they may have done this a bit in Retail also. 
---
figured 40m max is reasonable I've noticed I don't get funnelled in PVP as much also which has def improved my survivability.
---
You just saved me some struggle, theres a button to restore deleted characters!
---
I can’t figure out how to work the camera on this. Maybe because my turn keys are now my strafe keys?
---
I dunno really. But maybe being horde and “angry” is a thing for youths in rebellion?
---
I mean yeah, good tanking is also being a good party leader, but we all have our first runs of dungeons, our first experiences playing with certain classes, and sometimes a pickup group just plays really differently to how you're used to. Expecting every tank to also be a tactical genius would be a bit unreasonable, some of us are just masochists.
---
Its crazy what all the people seem to do in the game, when this surprises them. This is literal standard for everyone who wants to raid. I mean you spend the last 5 lvls in those instances anyway.
---
Blizz would say whatever story makes gold farmers look bad.
---
Maybe some of them were hacked, but there were demonstrably gold farmer accounts that would be in Silithus (pre-AQ) or EPL or Felwood or Un'Goro 24/7.  I remember trying to track some with my guildies round the clock, and they would just not log off for a week.
---
The methane always gives them away though
---
Not sure where you get immature from. Most people playing this game is 40+. This game is not for the younger generation at all. No 16 year old in today’s time was excited about classic. We’re all grown now
---
Well, like I said about that earlier, it moreso exposed a flaw in how easy it was to create destructive test items, especially when those weren't needed (the spell system was much more robust... It checked if you should have access to a spell every time you logged or zoned).  Those items were quickly removed from the game after. 
---
It wasn't a case of power abuse, just an honest mistake.
---
No, being a horde player since release but deciding to become alliance scum for classic makes you a bitch, not a sociopath :P
---
Oh my god, failing makes you get the mats again? Jeez thank christ I had the foresight to not attempt solo
---
well u can adjust them lol
---
You might need to downscale the resolution and turn settings way down, but I'm pretty sure you can get it to be playable at least.
---
Pickpocket, and still good to open with stun against certain mobs
---
Congrats!  Were you shadow spec or not?  Also, do you mean that you didn't do any instances or that you just mainly leveled solo?   Another (mainly) solo leveler here :)
---
Yeah you only really need 100% mana for a bossfight, and that is just in case shit goes wrong.
---
Apparently the Vanilla code didn't include healing  numbers in the 3d environment, so it's not possible via add-ons. However, you can have it in a flat 2d text format if you use Miks Scrolling Battle Text or something similar. Not ideal at all and made me roll a non-healer after finding out.
---
I let my son create a character on my account when I first played. When I would finish exploring, I would log onto his toon and leave it in areas you couldn't get to easily. Although I discovered if you left a toon up high on a small ledge, it usually fell to its death.
---
Getting called a coconut treat would demoralize me, as a hater for coconut treats.
---
Yes but the pictured player is a gnome, and the Classic experience is devs not allowing Alliance to win. Ever.  
---

DansGame
---
The thing is it was advertised as no changes though, so they really went with no changes. They already solved this later right with guns on guards etc. Or they can just put a “watcher” guard on some roofs.
---
Hey, what's that sexy keyboard?
---
Also, where'd you get that mouse pad?
---
Believe what? You thought I was serious?
---
I've found that I really like using a slow 1h with a shield as well. Does a lot of dmg and you get that dense boost.
---
Not many holy specced priests in ZF
---
I bet undercity smells awful.
---
after spirit weapons its probably best to start putting points in resto, as you are getting high impact for solo gameplay, and dungeons become abit harder to heal. 
---
Just keep your healing set in the bank, and switch when going to dungeons
---
Pepega Clap
---
Well you had to do it twice so you’re not that lucky. It’s a nice item but not a super rare drop, it’s more that some people get very unlucky when trying to farm it.
---
Big ups
---
**WHAT**
---
You can always talk to your groups. And/or leave if they are not to your liking.
---
Does the alliance get an account mount as I’m trying them this go around, man that AV wolf was a great mount.
---
Honestly good tanks fuck it up for bad tanks and the difference is a person who's solely focused on tanking vs a person who isn't.
---
When you run with a good tank that has literally Zero problems holding agro no matter how full-on DPS you go, it makes you wonder why other tanks can't do the same.
---
The answer is in the damage meters. Tanks who hold agro = very very low DPS. Tanks who are focused on dpsing+tanking can't hold agro for shit and it slows the group down because dps can't go full retard.
---
Healbot
---
What would you choose orb of soranruk or the staff?
---
Does it get better as you get deeper into shadow spec?  I hear that mindflay starts being more viable around level 30.  I could see swapping between mindflay and wand on different mobs to regen mana as you continue to level while using the superior DPS of mindflay to increase leveling speed when available.  That's what I'm hoping at least (level 11 priest here, lmao)
---
Do feel free to hop along and roll a tank yourself.
---
In all fairness he was probably denied by spell cleave groups too.
---
Sup Nazgum. :D
---
Plot twist, only an average of 4 people per server aren't gold farmers
---
Embrace the shadows
---
Have you tried re-downloading WoW?
---
In order to avoid re-downloading all 4GB, I'd back-up the ``data.000``, ``data.001``, ``data.002``, and ``data.003`` in the ``/Applications/World of Warcraft/Data/data`` folder somewhere, delete ``/Applications/World of Warcraft``, re-copy those data files into the same folder structure (create the folders and drop them back in), and re-install it through the Battle net app.
---
If you don't care about re-downloading though or backing files up, can just remove the entire ``/Applications/World of Warcraft`` folder and reinstall through the B net app.
---
If you don't want to do a reinstall at all though, I'd remove the entire ``/Applications/World of Warcraft/_classic_`` folder, go to the B net client, and do a scan/repair of game data; then try starting it up.
---
Yeah, 1 minute for each level past ten. So you had 9 minutes for level 19. You literally are confirming what he said.
---
&gt;You can always talk to your groups. 
---
And they can always ignore you, and often do. 
---
&gt;And/or leave if they are not to your liking.
---
4Head
---
Did they not just add guns to guards that shot you off the roofs, at least I remember that happening after a while in Vanilla. Could be wrong tho.
---
Yeah you’d say that and get banned for 3 days. Then you’d not say that again
---
I setup a fixed camera location on my desktop first and use the [ key (seen on the right side) to return to it when I screw if up.
---
I linked you a blue post not a quote. So far you’ve provided: a 9 in 50 anecdote, proving the power of RNG (18% drop rate when it’s actually 33%), and lots of jealous supposition without a shred of evidence that layering ever worked in raids let alone that the two people with Sulfuras abused this unproven bug.
---
Jealousy is an ugly color, friend.
---
this
---
Desolace and stranglethorn are your main go to's at 33. STV starts to be ok at 33
---
You don't just randomly shift layers that's not how it works, I smell bullshit.
---
I'm not actually mad at them, it was a fun experience. That's what I love about classic after all.
---
You really think those people that get banned for 3 days are not gonna come back? Lol, more like free 3 days of sub money for blizzard
---
Pretty sure the alliance get a ram for AV. It's also pretty nice.
---
the GM convo is for another person...
---
this guy happened to post one screenshot where he's standing on the top of the ship thing and apparently that means he was camping there, according to every redditor. despite having other screenshots of scores of bodies in an area inaccessible from where he was standing, and every single comment he made in the thread denying he was camping in a spot guards couldn't path to. but sure, jump to conclusions and feel good about yourself.
---
I'm 3/3 successful pug kills on final boss with this strat:
---
Have everyone stack near the tank.
---
Tank should stand near where the first adds activate.
---
DPS burn adds as they activate.
---
When the 6 adds activate they will run to group making it easier for tank to grab them while DPS aoe them down.
---
When the 2 big adds activate for final phase, have tank pick them up and use shield wall to stay alive.  DPS burn boss.
---
Damage is normalized, not attack speed. That's why BT is way better in PvP but doesn't make much of a difference in PvE.
---
When they die, /guffaw is a good response
---
Yeah that would be a 9 minute rez sickness minus some seconds.
---
Feral druids have the most random shit for BiS.
---
Tier 1 is garbage for me
---
I recall a league of legends fan being beat up at the WoW movie premiere lol
---
Unless all you wanna do is level easily and do bgs
---
Oh tell me about it, im just gonna spam life tap and hellfire while this arms warrior and shaman tank. 3 packs, and i end up tanking the stray fireballs etc
---
+1 for the pet name (and guild name)
---
God I hope it does, or else I've been wasting my time. I'll test it with my horde buddy some time to see for sure.
---
I started selling thick leather. Medium leather took forever for my auction addon to scan, so I assumed it would make next to no money over vendoring.
---
Lmao, that's a swift bit of karma for rooftop campers!
---
Definitely not. I'm pretty sure they only suspect account sharing if the login locations are crazy distances apart, so you shouldn't get false flagged either.
---
I feel like 85 is average nowadays
---
He's you when you sleep
---
I’m a level 34 warlock and I’m interested in buying the Shadow Hood which is 3g on AH. Is it worth it or are there similar/better head pieces around my level, say through quests or dungeons?
---
Ah, I skipped mara that must be what I missed, thanks
---
Welcome To noob club, i didnt knew it either :D
---
Go play neverwinter and tell me how that goes. People will shoot you down bc you're 100 IL below them (which is nothing in that game, btw)
---
Nice place, where's that ?
---
/equip
---
You can scroll back and look in channels btw, I’m not sure if people know this or not, but it stops the scrolling text while you’re scrolling. So it’s not hard to pick out groups.
---
People are reacting this way because this is kind of the same thing that killed player to player interactions in retail.
---
I healed a shaman tank in SM and I was blown away by how well it worked. The good thing about a shaman tank is I can put power word shield on him which helped keep conserve mana. Yeh he had to drink as often as a caster but held threat just as well as a warrior. It was fun and my discord friends and guildies also thought it hilarious but it's legit.
---
Haha, thanks! xD Maybe after reaching the comic book goal, I'll be able to aim higher and assemble a small team for animated shorts. But that's wishful thinking and waaaaay ahead in the future. xD
---
I have a macro to ask the tank to wait after a pull. I tell the tank I have this macro. Then I use it if I need to.
---
Can’t justify the monthly price of 50
---
Quid
---
i'm fairly sure /mooing at taurens is considered racist nowadays
---
Notices this, Classic is a lot of 30-40 year olds who played launch.  My peeps 😁
---
Could be a reference this [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NYFq7ZJg4c)?
---
He does spawn there, but can also spawn in the room above
---
Couple days ago my group was waiting outside of Arm and Lib for our tank to show up. Some lvl 40ish ally mage makes a break for it to go from GY to Cath. I saw this and ran over to interrupt him opening the door. (Didn't use shock because it was on CD.)
---
Just as the door opened I reached the mage and, in the blink of an eye, out came a WF crit for 1,400 damage with a frost shock crit for 250ish. I had to toss a /flex out for that 1 shot. (I was lvl 39 rocking ravager.)
---
Nah, welps in the marsh.
---
+24 Shadow damage helmet from Zul’Farrak coming up. Also the shadoweave mask. I wouldn’t spend 3g on something replaced easily especially at level 34
---
Awesome, thanks! I had one that would tap down to 30% every other pull and keep asking for heals mid fight when they didn’t have aggro. Never drank to refill mana just tapped the whole run.
---
I’ll keep these tips in mind for the future!
---
But it's not. Thunderbluff is pretty amazing.
---
Dude I've spent like 5 gold on flight paths so far lol I might follow this next time I take Booty bay &gt; Kargath &gt; undercity .. it's like 14s and only 2 stop points.
---
I think there is nothing worse in classic than the purists. I figured this would be downvoted
---
the basilisk vendor trash sells for a very good price compared to most trash. I also farmed them for my mount and I remember making more off the vendor trash than i did skinning.
---
No, at first you provided a quote, not a link. 
---
Second, the drop rAte for wowhead is proven to be incorrect. 
---
Third, Golemag is not the only boss who drops. 
---
Your lack of vanilla experience is showing. I bet you know where Mankriks wife is too.
---
Ya horde Bois downvote me cuz they like playing on a 70/30 h/a server lol
---
Priest gets to actually shield them tho unlike warriors which helps alot
---
Just Auctionator, and the bagon addon.
---
You can stop it.. I really don't understand how people have a hard time putting groups together right now when there's so many players
---
I believe it’s shoulders, gloves are brd I believe
---
Twitch launcher
---
yeah lets give it to the ret pally
---
Hey it's no picnic making the trek up there, seeing your lynched countrymen along the way
---
Arena pvp is a joke now. I was a 2.2k player for years then got glad. Shouldn’t have happened.
---
I was ot for everything in tbc, we cleared all the content fairly easily and fast I had a great guild. I decided to roll druid again this time around. People underestimate me CONSTANTLY, I'm not sure what it is. I am a million times better than a warrior at 5 mans. I hold threat better, I can tank 10 mobs at once and not lose aggro, I have battle rez and innervate, and I can warstomp and heal myself if I need to. I even have the option to swap to cat, sprint away, heal, and feral charge back into the fight while holding aggro. 
---
I dont understand why people hate on druids so much. Sure we get crushing blows at 60, but they're not that common and they dont 1 shot you if you have good gear. I dont get shield wall or last stand but thats about it.
---
Most likely not going to happen unless your name violates Blizzard’s ToS.
---
Why is it that the most hideous neckbeards play female night elves.
---
It wasn't answered "multiple times" - it wasn't even answered once. It has only been speculated at as to the reason behind it. 
---
Point me to the blue post, please.
---
Enhance and ret sucks cock and BRE is better for warrior, it's just how the game is made
---
They are fine in casual guilds, or even some more hardcore guilds but make sure you know how to totem twist because that is pretty much your main job in raids. Also don't expect to be anywhere near the top on the meters.
---
Thanks for sharing the story, made me laugh.
---
Alliance can get Bonebiter, from Desolace and SM questchain
---
Fishing :)
---
Join a guild. 
---
Help other people out. 
---
Run dungeons.
---
Welps in Dustwallow Marsh.
---
You are correct. Shoulders from sunken temple dudes. The slaghide gloves from lbrs.
---
Classic is about the journey
---
Retail is about the destination
---
There are a ton of people on this reddit that says its bannable, and my ask is just some proof. Closest thing I've found is from the original vanilla ToS  [https://i.imgur.com/8yOjO53\_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&amp;shape=thumb&amp;fidelity=medium](https://i.imgur.com/8yOjO53_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&amp;shape=thumb&amp;fidelity=medium)
---
I always loved how you still get access to trade chat in enemy cities
---
I would like any UI addon that makes my party list easy to read at a glance without looking like it was designed in 8 bit paint
---
Not really. I’m at 9% plus dual wielding axes as an orc with only two raid pieces and ranked every single boss minus Rag because our other tank had better FR so I OTd that boss.
---
Found a religion where the ultimate evil has the name of your character. Then report for naming violations
---
Why not add the whisper command as a protected function instead of /who?
---
Makes more sense. There's no reason addons should be allowed to spam whisper people, but not allowed to use /who.
---
I got Humar and I'll get the 1.2 worg when I hit lvl 53. I got a theme to stick to. :D
---
I'm using it and it helps tame the lfg channel chaos
---
soggy socks
---
Hey for those that are willing to put in the effort go for it, I say. I did decide I will be MT feral for my guild. They are Superior to warrs in threat for MC gear levels, and can tank all but 2-3 fights that are virtually impossible for them. That said, I do have a warr @ 60 as a back up tank.
---
Makes sense, thanks
---
Same thing for me, after a DC the frames got moved to default and now I can't move them at all. Any help or advice would be great :(
---
So like... /following a stealthed rogue so enemy faction can locate him?
---
Interupting polymorphs intentionally to make killing enemy faction harder?
---
mindcontrolling the opposite faction to heal them so they can kill you?
---
You're right but I've gotten fucked because I switch back in too soon thinking they've stopped casting only to get caught by it.
---
How do players decide which one of them is going to receive legendary items? Is it just another roll ?
---
This man druids.
---
dwarf power
---
If you are close enough to an instance entrance I am pretty sure you can Rez behind it &amp; enter through the back side.
---
Would take BRE over that
---
If they're pulling trash and you struggle with 80% mana that person really needs to stop using flash heal.
---
This whole thread is frustrating as a priest main. "If I'm still drinking and you pull you're not getting healed". Dear god how long do you want instances to take. Or you're low on water or it's expensive? What kind of bs excuse is that. You showed up unprepared to a dungeon and you want everyone else to suffer because of it?
---
I'm thinking about rolling a paladin! I understand that at endgame I'll be healing and I'm fine with that, but I plan on rolling Ret while leveling and clearing out all the quests I can find.
---
But what about 5-mans? Do people take ret paladins for those? Could I heal them as ret? I don't think I'll be able to afford respeccing every time I need to do a 5-man. :O
---
Although I havent tested it, I noticed that the 'restore deleted character' feature is available. In theory, you could delete your character, have a friend make a character with your name, then attempt to restore your character. Given that the two cannot remain with the same name, and your friend now has that name on their account, you (in theory) should be prompted to change the characters name.
---
Again I havent tested it, but It might be worth a shot.
---
I tank all the time at 60 as fury - this man is correct
---
I know retail has gone full retard on hunters but hunters are not a melee class. Period.
---
You can heal and tank as ret while leveling
---
I was in STVietnam on my 30 undead priest the other day. Me and a warlock were partied, farming a small group of trolls. 
---
A 29 pally and his 40 rogue buddy were there as well. We waved at each other and passed off respawns to each other. We both knew it sucked being there and weren't being aggressive. 
---
A random orc warrior came running by and charged the pally. Ofc rogue buddy destroyed him before the pally could die. Then in general chat warrior starts bitching about getting ganked by a skull rogue. 
---
Mind you, the rogue and pally didn't go on a spree, they just defended themselves. They nodded to me and went back to farming.
---
I got on chat and made damn sure everyone knew the warrior started the fight unprovoked and paid for it. 
---
Noone came to defend him when I was done.
---
There used to be the wow armory but idk if that's a thing these days
---
I dunno how many times I've run wailing caverns on different rogues I've started JUST FOR THAT MACE. lol
---
That's how 30+ leveling works
---
This. Your concern for us is touching and I know it's hard to resist leaving a health bar partially full, but really, we can take care of it under normal circumstances.
---
It's a placeholder in starcraft 2 as well
---
How does this kill player to player interaction?
---
You still have to manually message anyone this addon finds. It does nothing besides comb the chat log for you to save a few minutes of hassle. Lol
---
I didn't downvote anyone in this thread.  He didn't say he vanished mid-fight.  He said:
---
&gt; he pops up, I cast shadow word pain on him, only to have it not do anything and he vanishes to what I can only assume is another layer.
---
This description of what really happened tells us actually nothing at all about what really happened.
---
And now imagine the group accidentially pulls too much or adds a pat.
---
You can’t layer raids
---
k
---
Which server is 70% horde
---
With a healing set you can heal everything up to 60...
---
If you can keep some caster gear in your bags and keep it updated then you’ll be able to heal just fine
---
I cant wait. Best fricken thing I've seen all week.
---
Ok so I’m a freak and I always remember 
---
CA
---
GL
---
California
---
Good luck
---
Can’t explain it. It’s always worked for me.
---
Awesome thank you so much man! Exactly what I was looking for
---
No it isn't?
---
Why don't they just give guards ranged weapons to attack with instead of making players restrict their use of the resources the game is handing them? Using elevation is a valid form of combat it's not like you're utilizing glitches.
---
Feral DPS in high end raids require this.
---
Hi, /u/puesjavi

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d7ecue/long_day_at_work/). 
---
&gt; Third, Golemag is not the only boss who drops. 
---
Oh thanks for bringing that up! So you’re admitting that your 9/50 is an even more irrelevant anecdote.
---
So we’ve now established that: 
---
* it’s entirely plausible that the number of people farming MC has made it possible to consolidate 9 ingots
---
* a blue post has said that the only known instance of an MC reset was not related to layering
---
* you have no evidence to the contrary
---
Great! Thanks for playing.
---
Yes, the hit table provided at the top of that section is for someone with 300 weapon skill ("without any talents or gear").
---
&gt;Getting to 308 Weapon Skill also effectively lowers your miss chance from 9% to 6%. There is negligible benefit from going over 308 Weapon Skill...
---
 [https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Attack-table#weapon-skill](https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Attack-table#weapon-skill)
---
&gt;  At 310 its I dont even know.
---
The soft-cap is 308. This has been confirmed for months. After 308 you don't reduce the glancing blow penalty and your miss chance decreases by 0.1%.
---
"while leveling"
---
in EU we got skullflame which is 70% horde. its so boring
---
There's a balance. A bad, slow tank might make a dungeon take 2 hours. A good, fast tank (that knows his groups limitations) might make it take 45 min.
---
Some tanks are slow as fuck.
---
I thought it was funny that he turned to fight me after I laughed at him lol. Sorry that got you so hot and bothered tho!
---
I feel that way about mages and warriors, mostly mages though.
---
Can you explain why?  It's strength/stamina with an awesome proc effect.  I see nothing on it that screams "Shaman".

He's literally a brain damaged invalid.

He had a few bad experiences with spell cleave and now won't even party with 1/4th the classes in the game? That's not only stupid, but also inconceivably childish and without a single drop of reason. 
---
His "sorry" preemptive self defense for what he knows is an incoherent, nonsensical, bizarrely stupid "rules" he's made up for himself
---
Did I say this addon kills player to player interaction? Or did I say this type of thing did. Not the same.
---
Because theyre the other faction and you want to give them a hard time, no? Or are we playing a different game here?
---
“You are in Razorfen Kraul. The rest of us are in Razorfen Downs.”
---
Can only quest am and late night, so many horde it’s never a 1v1. I’m the joke by taking time to stack reck bombs but it’s just too good for my mental health on this server lol
---
I always get an out of sight message when a cast would go through the dock.
---
Yeah, looking more and more like he was in the right here.
---
No pls no. I know you’re trying to do a good thing but pls no
---
Mc atonement at 55. In dreams questline and ony attunement can both be completed at 58 if I'm not mistaken.
---
If you're just starting, unless you're trying to play with a friend or something, just pick a different server. There's plenty out there with zero queues.
---
I'm 53 and I've only *seen* a single BoE blue, and that was at around level 25 which I didn't win.

I got this working with Enhanced Chat Filter:  [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/chat-filter](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/chat-filter) 
---
How to do it:
---
open panel with /cf
---
in drop down menu change from Filter to hide
---
Enable Hide modus and chat filter
---
make a list of Blacklisted words. ZF SFK etc. Ez pz

Here's a screenshot of how mine looks in action:  [https://imgur.com/a/FXPWw6p](https://imgur.com/a/FXPWw6p)
---
Nice man. I'm 48 atm and still feel light years away from 60...the grind is very real.
---
Are we only using the server discord role checks to determine faction balance or have we seen actual numbers? Kirtonos is ~350 horde vs ~alliance so that doesn’t seem bad, that’s where I play as well and I definitely still get trampled by alliance in many contested zones
---
Im guessing you've managed by now, but after doing it 5 or 6 times with some weird as comps (including me tanking as warlock with 2 paladins healing since one couldn't hold aggro) I've found the best way is a druid or warrior tank lvl 46+, a hunter to kill adds, and after that lock/rogue/hunter/mage shred the boss. Just don't ever have lock kill adds they don't have a burst option that's fast/Mana efficient enough. 
---
Oh and if you summon the boss and instantly pull up the stairs to the 4 golem room it's way easier since his 2 golem summon probably won't get there before he's dead. Cheesy but efficient.
---
You guys don’t have a zeppelin to go to STV? We have one from UC.
---
This is absolutely not the reason. Classic has nowhere near the amount of spammers that retail has had for the past decade, and yet this fix is targeted only to classic.
---
lol!!
---
That's why I/kick %t
---
"Hack your PC" - 1. No, it's not hacking -- you accepted the EULA giving them permissions to use anticheat measures on your machine. 2. Are you retarded?
---
I don't see why that would be unpopular. It's pretty standard for the tank to watch how much mana the healer typically uses for a pull and judge the wait based on that.

It’s slightly worse than the best in slot. “Bony ankles, tits could be bigger 2/10”
---
Lmao he was so hype about the win too smh
---
The amount of idiot healers in that thread was insane. Water is expensive! I might be low on water and need to make each one count!
---
Great you being unprepared is going to end up punishing everyone else in the dungeon.
---
Lawd lol my og Hunt I remember clocking at 30+ days b4 BC? maybe through BC? idk lol but it's still crazy to think about
---
We have established nothing other than you believing wowheads droprate is correct, and my statement about how many runs it took us to collect our first ingots for our first sulfuras is somehow anecdotal, yet you never mentioned that there are two bosses that drop ingots. Not one. 
---
You may have indeed played vanilla, but that doesn’t mean you experienced crafting sulfuras. Which you quite obviously did not, or you wouldn’t be defending drop rate info on wowhead for classic. 
---
Now, if you’re done blowing up my notifications about something you know nothing about....
---
Yea I mean I don't think you are bad. Based on your messages its just a fact that you have no idea what you are talking about.
---
I lose my Keybinds after logout. Why?
---
I'd say it's definitely worth it even if you're not going to raid. Raids won't be as difficult as they were back then because of the experience and availability of information, so you could still find a good PUG group after a while.
---
I see 54
---
But how are you fucked...you're a warlock, you get one of the most badass mounts in the game. I'm so confused, are you seriously grinding for a different racial mount even though you get a dreadsteed?
---
I don't plan on raiding, but I am planning on hitting AV pretty hard...
---
Completely missed the point and thought you sold 10k Runecloth to get an epic mount.
---
What're you using to do this?
---
Only when your rage bar is completely maxed.
---
If it's red it's dead!
---
Completely new to WoW. Am I supposed to be buying vendor armor as I level? My armor is pretty shoddy compared to what's being offered at the moment but everything I read says to only really buy weapons and skills. When do I get decent armor then? (Currently level 13 War)
---
I mean if you gave it a second's thought you'd realize that if this was the case, they wouldn't just break it for Classic. Retail has a ton more spammers than classic does, yet this function remains unchanged there.
---
But sure, call _them_ retarded.
---
Burst in PvP? Afaik, 31/0/20 has the higher Burst damage...
---
and here we are saying meme specs aren't viable. Apparently you don't even need to move to be viable.
---
He has over 1500 gold in his bags, an epic mount, and who knows how much on his bank alt.  By looking at his past stream broadcasts and timing, there is no humanely possible way any of this was illegitimately farmed.  
---
Are we okay with streamers getting away with it?  I thought blizzard said there isnt people sitting around with huge reaped benefits of layer exploiting?
---
Im guessing this is just bait? No one could honestly believe a random screenshot of someone’s normal bank is proof of exploiting... right?
---
Well level 30 and got whirlwind axe... feels great to enjoy this game in a relaxing way :)
---
Best healing off-hand for a while from Bloodmage Thalnos.
---
You're surprised by this why?
---
Just imagine if it dropped everything and you were carrying an entire crocodile around, then two.  You’d get those 2 kills and have to go to the vendor again.
---
Rogues for lyfe!
---
Big respect mate, gonna try even harder now
---
Heh, this was more amusing when I read it as a path straight to herpes.
---
Rogues with bad gear can still outplay people.
---
I have an owl as a hunter pet for leveling. Is it worth teaching it claw? Screech seems extremely powerful and seems to go through the owl's focus fast enough by itself so I feel like claw wouldn't really add anything good. Thoughts?
---
Fascist dictatorships can enjoy WoW too!
---
Really? I \/who warrior and start whispering warriors and by the time I've whispered my 5th one I usually have one before I fill up my DPS from trade/general chat.
---
&gt; there is no humanely possible way any of this was illegitimately farmed
---
but.. you just said...
---
Welcome to playing a mage.
---
If I recall correctly, you still needed the rep to use the mounts from PvP
---
What addon is that bar on the top
---
Is it worth levelling a mage to spec into fire? It’s probably going to be my alt and I have no idea what mage is like in classic but I enjoyed fire in retail. I know MC is a no go but how is the playstyle of fire in general and would any one recommend it?
---
Ok, wheres the difficult part? I usually just skim while sending out my own message and have no problems. I'm on a full server though so it's usually quick
---
Many of those are literally racism. Also racism doesn't neccesarily have to be about ethnicity, nationality fits in the definition too.
---
Precisely this. I know of many ways to use Gouge, interrupt, running away, bandage, etc. The fact that these guys are calling me a nub for not minmaxing its use (and worse, utilizing it as designed with daggers and Backstab) is peak elitist
---
We always knew they were there, never had a reason to visit until BFA though
---
It's a much faster walk in UC.
---
Don't use Heroic Strike unless you have more than 50 rage.
---
Rend and Sunder Armor are better damage per rage abilities.
---
My spite is a bit larger.
---
It’s annoying in IF and SW too.  I don’t go to darnassus and haven’t been horde, so cannot compare.
---
I'm so glad im not playing on the "streamer" servers
---
The warlock 100% speed mount will be available in phase 2 with dire maul, same story with the paladin epic mount I believe?
---
Thanks for the advice, I rolled a rogue and am having a fun time so far, I really like being able to move during combat compared to my priest
---
Idk about banned but it is hilarious to see how it took like a week or two for people to get more gold than hardcore players would've made in their whole vanilla career. 10k gold and hundreds of rare mats on people in the first couple weeks of playing but "layering is having no effect on the game economy"
---
I get Mayes. They think aoe is the answer to everything. Warriors though?
---
The probability of each resist is independent of the previous, so all of these being in a row isn’t actually relevant. But I do agree that the rng in classic seems rigged at times.
---
This is why I quit classic already.  Blizzard doesn't have a clue as to what they are doing. They fucked this release up.
---
You don't need one and it's not worth the effort until you're raiding. Maybe not until you're raiding BWL. Just wait until you're 60.
---
How is following a stealthed rogue to help the enemy faction kill him easier not "collusion"\`? You are quite literally communicating and working together with an opposite faction player to achieve a goal
---
Ah, I didn't realize that. Makes sense then!
---
I may be whooshing here but no you don’t have to get the mats again, you just restart quest
---
Any tips for 3k? Hoping to get a wolf for my Tauren.
---
I've never forgotten what you did to me, me. And now I have found you
---
What part of ATL are you in? I'm up in the Sandy Springs / Dunwoody area
---
Southshore to Khaz Modan always gives you this view as alliance, it’s pretty great
---
i suppose this data is a week old by now but here's the source 
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community#us-realms
---
and usually those numbers dont get any better once the snowball starts rolling....
---
even sader is the fact that ive noticed a surprising amount of multiboxers on ally side, only saw one multiboxer first day on horde side. Meaning there's even less actual people on ally side...
---
If i could i'd transfer to Mograine, a high pop server with 49% horde. Would like battlegrounds as fast as possible honestly
---
He's not high end raiding if he's asking what level he should start farming.
---
What do you mean by 'this type of thing'? Addons that simply parce a chat log for keywords? 
---
Not sure that's what killed the social interactions
---
And even then there won't be a market because everyone is saving their possible twink items.
---
"I'm gnot a gundead"
---
Feel like you are missing out an enormous part of the game if you don't engage in any PvP... but my point is that PvE is completely clearable with any race combo, but having the edge in PvP is much greater
---
But *how* does it do that? This literally just says "Hey, these people are expressing interest in this thing, message them", or is it the skimming of other peoples messages that's counting as player to player interaction?
---
You can drop flametongue to replace your damage dealing fire totems
---
Pay no heed to these heathens! They live by victory or death. This one chose death. 
---
For the Alliance!
---
What we need are twinkies
---
i have ring from maraudon and chest from arena. what spec should i be right now then?
---
There is less here is probably what they meant.
---
Says the guy defending “horde pride” on reddit in a post labeled incorrectly as a world first, and very likely (over 90%) to be the result of exploitation. 
---
You’re also basing your argument on clearly incorrect data, which has been proven long before this post. 
---
You’d hope 15 years later, there wouldn’t be people so fervently defending illegitimate “world” firsts, especially those that defy mathematics and logic. 
---
But here you are.
---
/facepalm
---
Horde and Alliance versions or only class specific?
---
See you on the battle field...
---
that too
---
What reward do you gain from it though? 
---
I got two hordies to kill a druid for me by using emotes. Is that collusion or just clever use of game mechanics?
---
qua?
---
41 rogue here and I out dps higher level mages we had 2 level 43 and they just resist and then oom. Get a rogue I brought him down all by myself by doing 80% of the damage gave them focus on the adds only
---
Didn't you get the memo?  It's 2019, everything is racist.
---
it isnt though, pre raid there isnt a ton of plate, most of their prebis is actually leather gear. Im fine with anyone rolling on prebis stuff, warrs and rogues can go for black crow all they want, but for hoj, or a bis hunter weapon like peacemaker or bonescling hatchets, im for sure rolling on those.
---
And developed full ecosystems in 4 years ?
---
I think mulgore and thunderbluff are beautiful :D
---
You can move player frames without a. Add on.
---
&gt; over 90%
---
You’re literally just making up numbers with no evidence at this point.
---
I bet most people won't care while leveling as they're not in the running for anything pvp related anyways.
---
On retail, I tested a similar addon by multiboxing with a starter edition account. If your addon is likely to be retail-compatible, you could give that a shot.
---
And again you are ignoring the screen cap at the top of this post. The GM says in response to a question about sitting on the mast at the front of the ship on top of the inn, that it is considered terrain exploiting because the guards can't get there. His disruptive gameplay involved roof camping for an hour which is why he was banned not warned like the OP in this thread.
---
Electrocutioner’s leg from Gnomer and the Vanquisher’s sword from RFD. Skip the SM 1h and get the Bonebiter Axe if you’re alliance. It’s a massive upgrade for solo play.
---
wow ur acting like i cant do one thing hoping to do the other
---
I totally get you, the only alliance race I ever played was dwarf :P
---
How much do you make per hour?
---
Thats what I was telling my friend. It doesn't really make my job harder, but its going to make healing a bitch lol
---
ok thank u for ur opinion
---
now whats the answer to my question

This speaks to me on a spiritual level, so much so that I can hear a faint echo in the distance....."oom.....oom....."

---
ambush wep swap macros exist and garrote does a huge amount of damage
---
thank you for an answer lol
---
yes and if you read the convo you would see him mention that this spot: [https://imgur.com/0VwtdEe](https://imgur.com/0VwtdEe) Is considered roof camping. The player specifically asks about this spot and GM says yes that is considered terrain exploiting.
---
The only issue I've had is getting sunscale at night more than nightfin.
---
Maybe they don't whisper you because they don't like you either.
---
Lasher farming... dire maul
---
Yes, but a lot of their population don’t have the means to play, whereas even the lower class in the US and EU can.
---
In my case it's people sitting on discord and working together to kill me so they can secure devilsaur leather and make gold off it. And it's not a one time deal.
---
I would still go Combat Swords, at least for the early levels. It outperforms daggers even in 5 man dungeons, and is just better PvE DPS overall.
---
Alchemy is neat, and a good money maker late game. As with all crafting professions, you won't get much out of it while leveling up. Having potions is nice, but replacing Alch with say Mining will allow you to make more money to buy potions and whatever else you might need.
---
Of course you can't track mining nodes and herbs at the same time, so if you don't want to have to micro manage that, you can either take skinning again or go ahead and roll with Alch.
---
Druids can tank anything, even raids. They're pretty gear dependent to do it well in raids, and there are definitely fights where a warrior is preferred, but they can do it. Skarm is a pretty well known YouTube tank guy who has covered the topic extensively.
---
The biggest problem with druid tanking is the stereotype that they can't tank. Everyone remembers patch 1.0 druids and not patch 1.12 druids. Everyone agrees druids were great in BC, but few realize that very little changed between 1.12 and BC. They were already great tanks, just no one was giving them a chance at that point.
---
"The internet is for porn"

I have no problem using it, sorry if you have trouble with this challenging task of “reading”!

Warriors in leather gear? I played a warrior in vanilla to 60 and one now. When I was 60 people didn't talk about  prebis gear. The game was too new. Haven't really played since 2005, so I'm learning new meta knowledge. Regardless I won't use leather anything. That's just so against what a warrior is to me.
---
You're dealing with the type of person who sees racism everywhere and in everything, definitions of words mean nothing to them, because they change them as they please to fit their agenda.
---
magic
---
Anal preparation
---
I also play a tank and the mindset of players is definitely getting shittier by the day. I specced prot to dungeon farm instead of questing and I'm regretting that more and more. 
---
People see streamers doing premade runs with their guild on comms zooming through zf and BRD getting 100k/hr and assume they're on that level. Meanwhile my shield spike is doing more dmg than you are and I'm top/second on the dmg charts in a group that wanted to "do big aoe pulls and clear this fast af".
---
So I pull a pack and a patrol, then the mage grabs two more packs. I don't have agro on any of them, priest hits me with a big heal, 5 mobs go on healer and we wipe. Group immediately says "wtf dude learn to tank." 
---
I mount up and leave party. Cya nerds maybe the mage can tank.
---
Same.
---
Also “pa” is spelled “pas”
---
I agree they are pretty. But they seem really huge and wide open. Walking through them kinda sucks
---
But he just said he farmed them himself?
---
If it took you this long to find a bot, I guess it's a good bot
---
39 mage at the time
---
Nobody except Blizzard knows, and the Blizzard employees are likely under NDA and couldn't talk about it.
---
What part of my reaction did you find silly?
---
I think Herod will still be overcrowded for months to come because of this idea that if players just wait patiently enough they will be rewarded with a healthy server population.
---
This may be true, but how long will the wait be for...and what is the point if you rarely get to play on it for the first year.
---
This is so good
---
Ill give you 63s for it.
---
Honestly I thought these were high res screenshots from a cartoon...great work, man
---
I love the ruggedness of Durotar and the calm beauty of Mulgore. Tirisfal has an eerie feel to it that immerses you in a land full of the dead. I personally only like Dun Morogh for Alliance as I am a huge fan of snowy zones and mountains. Elwynn is too generic and Teldrassil is too purple for my tastes.
---
Oh no, what will I ever do! Some random sperglord on the internet said that perhaps I'm not liked by gold spammers on a video game!
---
Ohhh woe is me, benighted is thine world, for not am I loved by all. Alas, I digress, to end thyself of this mortal coil and embrace oblivion.
---
Actually the guy in the screen shot did that too.
---
Any /emote X command shows up as "Player makes some strange gestures" to the opposing faction.
---
What server? Faction?
---
&gt;LOLOL!
---
It’s both.
---
&gt;Cutting most of the content the game has to offer in the process 
---
Such as?
---
Well you should have said that in the OP, you just sound like you’re whining about getting trolled. If you can prove they’re communicating about you to get devilsaur I’m pretty sure that’s bannable. But you’d need screenshots and possibly audio recordings to prove it.
---
90% certainty is my confidence in this being an exploit. Not an incorrect wowhead drop rate. 
---
Jesus. Go get a life, burner account.
---
I got you baby, I'm the tank that's okay leaving the aggro on the "off tank" if it's safe to do and means I can venture off to grab more. Maximum use of resources.
---
What? Are you saying the people spamming chat for layer swaps AREN'T exploiting?
---
It 100% worked on frost nova back in vanilla
---
Welcome to the internet.
---
I mean, that sounds about normal. People in their early 20s like to think they're grown up but most aren't.
---
Get off my lawn, whippersnappers.
---
When you're mind controlled you're a friendly player that enemies can interact with. They just cast buffs on me during this time.
---
New free transfers going on right now until next week
---
Spellcleave? Back in my days we just called it aoe..

Same here. I look specifically for "full clear" or "quest" groups.

Hey, they got some cash.

For a drop of blood.

Wow bis item fetched some money. Hold on to it

Had a Druid healer take a great cloth shoulder piece out of SM cath...I wasn’t mad but it just sucks being a cloth user not able to roll on leather. Sucks to suck!
---
And if you mouse over the doors they say Armory and Cathedral
---
you would be surprised, the middle class has exploded in china in the recent years
---
Neat! Will you be doing one for the Alliance as well?

it was really purple, unfortunately we had to destroy it since we cant exit the zone at the portal because we are not lvl 50+ :(

Wrong, works perfectly fine on both my 2016 MBP 13” and iMac 5k at work. Just don’t update the OS as soon as it comes out.

You have to change the controller settings to right click while dragging. It's complicated. Fortunately, you don't have to do it, here's a guide to import a layout with everything already good.
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d6mt45/optimized\_steam\_link\_wow\_layout\_import/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d6mt45/optimized_steam_link_wow_layout_import/)
---
Maybe I've just had some great DPS warriors but it can be really awesome having an offtank especially if the main party tank gets banalished or something goes wrong. It's definitely hit or miss but about half the arms warriors I've grouped with haven't taken aggro that much (and if they take aggro they just tank for a while) usually it's either the tank or the warrior taking damage and the arms warriors are usually beefy enough boys that they can sit at half health with a renew on them for the whole fight.
---
I was referring more the the functionality than the scenery of the zones. All of them are honestly kinda pretty or cool in their own way. to me alot of the horde zones seem HUGE and wide open which makes walking around seem like it's taking longer.
---
Yeah, there are a ton of whelps around 100g, couple of hyacinth at 400g, and oozeling at 1k on the auction house.
---
Agreed. Not condoning it either but still it’s fun as hell to know this happened.
---
Fire and Frost are both viable in PvP. Fire will die more, but also one shot people occasionally. Frost still has great damage in PvP, but significantly better survivability.
---
I can't speak much for Fire DPS in Raids, but in Phase 1 the biggest Raid is Molten Core, which features several mobs that are immune to Fire damage.
---
Overall, Frost is the better spec, at least for now.
---
There can be players though
---
I've never played a warrior, so I really have no idea. I'm just going off what the guy said. If this is the case, seems I got trolled.
---
The first guy seemed genuinely pissed tho. Believed he was not able to redo the quest at all. The second guy said he was mad cause he had to recollect all the mats. idk...
---
Just go shadow. You can heal just fine until the harder dungeons in your 50s.
---
“Go back to spellcleaves” is not polite by any means. He’s probably upset about being rejected by cleave groups, which is actually understandable. But let’s not pretend that was polite.
---
I'd just put blessing of salvation on all the DPS to start with. Save the tank and yourself the headache and let them go hard right from the start of every pull instead of holding back.
---
I’m on Kirotonos which is about a 65% horde tip and it drives me nuts because I would like to go to a better balanced server for PvP, however, not a generally lower population realm—I prefer higher pop for better playing experiences but low population would bum me out more than horde:alliance ratio.
---
I hate swamps in real life and in video games, not sure why I just do.
---
I belive you.
---
This would drive me insane honestly. But I just hate downtime in general, especially if Ive done the place more than once before.
---
For those of you unaware, Alliance starting zones were the first to be completed. Everything else was a mad dash.
---
"I'm pretty sure that's bannable" You see I strictly asked for proof to see if it actually IS bannable because half the community says it is and half says it's not. I'm not gonna waste my time gathering information like that if what they are doing is allowed.
---
I’m not about to take Blizzard-Activision’s word for it.  An add on that makes them look unfavorable comes out and a week later they patch this, yet the guild spam invite addons have existed this whole time. Why patch that now? Is the timing not in anyway suspicious to you?
---
The basic idea is that trash costs more time then the boss. One solution is spellcleaving the trash to get to the boss faster. 
---
If the trash is even the main reason for visitning the dungeon (exp) this gets even more interesting.
---
Fun fact in vanilla we had also stealth groups around the time DM came out. Almost any combination of rogues and druids works. Sneak through anything trashy and just murder the bosses you need. Two druids  could turn the boss in a classic tank and spank while more rogues could simply use evasion tanking and vanish to pass aggro to the next available rogue.
---
Real life when spending too much time on WoW.
---
My experience was that even on easy pulls, my health fell away a hell of a lot faster. So I switched back. Maybe if I ever get more gear.
---
I've made probably 60g just questing like normal since 40 (currently lvl 44). I made over 10g in ZF the other day. 
---
Just play like normal and you'll have it soon enough.
---
Forcing a tank to not roll on a 2h wep is fucked
---
A dps rolling on a shield is fucked too. 
---
About the same with healers and caster
---
Yeah, realized it wasnt Feralas after logged in, don't know where I got that from.
---
But I'm talking about instantaneous respawn. Always.  I don't remember it being like that in vanilla. 
---
But then again, it was a long time ago.
---
You're right. People just want it easier.
---
Okay, sorry for the input. You do know GMs are a thing? You vould have just asked them.
---
Maybe its just me but i could listen to nadseason, drachinifel etc for hours on end (and i have) its so SO much better then the typical overproduced-superedit ADHD YouTube narrator
---
Yeah I currently don't drink often either but when you are working with only greens passive Mana Regen usually won't be enough.
---
I’m hella down with this!
---
Good joke.  Everybody laugh.  Roll on snare drum.
---
Yeah this, he has two spawn points at least, One being where you are.
---
Does being imprisoned in this flesh cage of ugly and sad count?
---
Because they are greedy ass bitches that just want to undercut stuff for the sake of it while not noticing they actually take a loss there. Laughing at those people is all I can do
---
I appreciate the input it's just not what I'm asking for. 
---
I started a ticket before making this post but you know how blizzard response times are
---
I picture all of us sailing within eyeshot of Northrend, most aware of the danger which lurks there. Probably would be a place barely spoken about, yet feared kind of like "beyond the wall" in GoT. The most well versed in the matters would be glad there is an ocean between us and what roams the frozen north. Pandaland is basically Japan in the historically isolated phase - known to not like outsiders so people stay away.
---
You're in a world of dragons, undead, giants, demons, and elemental gods - yet the concept of an island springing up and developing an ecosystem is just too far?
---
Kink shaming is my kink
---
Yeah that’s the exact same thing I’m struggling with. I don’t want to transfer to a low pop realm, but wpvp is pretty much the reason I play this so finding out the imbalance is this severe really bums me out. I’m honestly heavily considering starting fresh on a new realm, I just hate to think that I’ve already sunk 3 days pt into this toon and I’m gonna have to repeat everything
---
Quadrac
---
That makes sense, thanks!
---
Manna biscuits are expensive br9
---
Well at least I know not to whisper him for an invite now, lol.
---
Chill out dude, either way it's just a game.
---
Side bar comment as the parent of an aspiring player who is 5. I rolled a toon on my account for him and am teaching him the basics. Have you had much success getting the 6 yr old to properly use the mouse/keyboard combo? I think my kid’s hands are just a bit too small and/or he needs a little more manual dexterity to really get it. He struggles with basic movement but really likes the game.
---
I tell every group I’m in that have a limited amount of mana and need to drink like every other healer... most are understanding but some players seem to think this is retail
---
Better odds than winning the lottery? What a profoundly stupid assertion to make. Why the hell do ignorant people talk so arrogantly about the very things they are ignorant about? Shit blows my mind.
---
Uh ... there is one.
---
It depends on the faction you're grinding too. Darkspear Trolls probably has the least reputation available from quests out of all horde factions. Orgrimmar on the other hand is all over the place and you can get revered before you're 60.
---
I mean, I see a few sales pitches in trade. Some people talk like trolls if they're playing trolls. Best part, no one does leet speak in open chat channels, which is great because I still don't know what the fuck pogger means.
---
Overall, really almost no impact, but seemingly more mature players. I turned off profanity filter and haven't seen a single Fuck or Shit yet. Barrens chat is people being kind to each other and no politics yet.
---
I hope so. Transfering to Judgement from Mograine was the biggest regret in my life. on mograine i could find any group in seconds. On judgement it takes at least 1 hour to 1.5 hour to find people and then eventually people start leaving
---
Thunderbluff, you're welcome
---
*i can be your healer, baby!*
---
I'm not sure at what point during vanilla I did this, but I'm positive my hunter was riding her raptor without [exalted Darkspear rep](https://i.imgur.com/GAC51q4.png).
---
(I'd link to her armory page but I can't find it at the moment.  I dunno)
---
mindflay does 450~ total damage on my 51 priest. you're telling me smite would do more?
---
She's at  [https://twitter.com/xilu3\_](https://twitter.com/xilu3_)
---
Tb is even better. Innkeeper, forge, anvil, bank, auction right in same area
---
So run a resto sham vs a shadow priest? They have completely different roles.
---
If you are taking about ele, they have much worse mana issues, and enhance is poor dps as well.
---
You're right.
---
All of this has been around for 14 years. Nothing has changed, and no rules have gotten progressively stricter.
---
thats not how rng works
---
There were different project managers for the horde and alliance flight paths. One of them was thinking of the players and the other one wanted to be all like RP and shit.
---
Once you get good at the pulls and recovering from mistakes or badly timed resists, yes, it can be very fast. If you didn't enjoy though, don't play that way. Do what's fun. If you need to do a few hours here and there to grind money or mats, that's different than trying to level that way.
---
Some places it works great, sm is one of them, it's super easy to pull off too. In zf its cancer if you dont kill the totems, which as a feral tank it's hard for me to do. I can get them fast with swipe, but it dumps my rage onto them so its harder to aggro other stuff. 
---
Its doable and we have some great pulls, but overall it's a pain on the ass. 
---
A lot of tanks also dont realise when a mage frost novas you back up. Theres no reason to take damage when you don't have to, especially if you have aggro.
---
Damnnn I guess that just determined my decision to not take any free transfers lol
---

---
As a healer I appreciate this a lot. I started to let dps who ran ahead to pull shit just die because they never learn. Let me drink ffs.
---
I just used it to tame Broken Tooth, it indeed does
---
Oooooooooh. I gotcha!
---
Tunics area a better flip fyi. Also depending on thick leather price it can be really good money. At 1g per stack of leather each tunic is just under 16s in profit when vendored. I always scan the ah and buy the cheap thick leather and then craft while I'm afk making dinner or something.
---
Well, there is a lore for those things. 
---
If a full continent with a full ecosystem appears over night, i'm okay to believe it as long lore explains it.
---
Anyway, Kul'tiras is in the long since years. It just did not show on the Map before you could go there. Same thing with Arthas Chill Island.
---
If you have proof you should open a ticket.
---
Fix ur gear
---
Ya, I remember finding out rooftop camping was kosher in TBC because at least players could reach you via flying mounts themselves, as opposed to wall jumping. 
---
Basically Blizzard believes in PvP problems have PvP solutions, but if the PvP solution requires you to use the same "geometry exploit" (wall jumping) then that's not a reasonable expectation to put on defending players.
---
that explains barrens chat
---
For PvP before you have the money to spend on free/limited action, gnome is a solid choice. But once you’re feared and can spend on consumables, I think orc will ultimately pay off
---
Start BRD arena runs.
---
Question. Is thick hide not important? I have it 5/5
---
What is a spell cleave?
---
This is how you parent, good job.
---
Lol your comment was incredibly unclear, but you're also wrong, they're definitely exploiting the game mechanics which isnt exactly cheating/hacking but has obviously resulted in bans before because it's clearly not how the game is meant to work. 
---
Layering dungeon bosses was in the game and that isnt working out so well for some people.
---
Either way until we saw pics of people with banks full of rare mats and 10k gold in two weeks lots of people said layering was having no effect at all on the game and it's the same as vanilla. I hope we can at least all agree now that's definitely not the case.
---
This made my day, bless you dude.
---
A vast amount of rules have gotten stricter, especially regarding trade. I have screenshots of conversations with GMs backing this up, too.
---
Puggle is ok, but after about 5-6 hour session with it, when /4 speeds up, wow starts work quite noticeable slower, so i turned it off.
---
How do you know it was unprovoked? Half the point of my last post was that you may think someone is killing you unprovoked when they are simply getting you back for shit you forgot.
---
Anyways, it seems you’re just sharing a story, not trying to make a point one direction or the other so I’m glad you enjoyed your interaction.
---
If you constantly have to deal with healing the dps more than the tank it’s probably a tank problem. A dps should tank like 1 auto before it’s taunted. If there’s no dps targets set then it’s assumed the tank can hold everything easily enough. At least this is how I tank.
---
Just let the dps tank and have the tank full dps. Until you get to ubrs all damage is easily manageable.
---
Saquan Borcley
---
OMG
---
Try this in BRD and up without Raid BIS and your dead or the healer is oom midway through the first pull.
---
I quit wow because of how boring the new server is. I wish i never transferred. I enjoyed classic a lot but i guess i will play again when paid character transfer is a thing :D
---
Ok, that's one use :p. But that cooldown though.
---
I’m always out of room. As a hunter, we do lose a slot, however I like to enjoy fishing and I pick up most min drops that are worthwhile (and that stack) along with having room for mining and skinning. I’m surprised you arent running into this more frequently
---
if you're alliance the worgen south of darkshire in duskwood have really fast spawn rate. they also drop heavy/medium leather for skinning. lvl 29-30 mobs mostly.

I was prob gonna run armory a few times anyway. May just do this if I still have trouble getting help with Cyclonian
---
can some one give this dude an award already? I am poor.
---
I went fishing and disenchanted my main weapon because I forgot I had my pole equipped.
---
Cool, so I guess we'll all just fight only people of the same level? And no low level will walk into my AOE to grief me with a DHK? And all of that totally won't discourage me from participating in WPvP at all? If you give players the ability to penalize other players (baiting them into killing a low level for a DHK) they will. It will be miserable too.
---
I am chilling out, idk if I get ganked. If anything the other guy needs to chill instead of reporting everyone and their mothers.
---
Jesus, you got the chest? Go fury my dude, arms is just way too slow of a playstyle for me personally. Devilsaur set is bit expensive but it’ll last you until AQ40 pretty much
---
Used to work in InfoSecurity. This is quite true
---
&gt; **Pet still attacking keeps me in combat even while in FD**
---
Reading comprehension does not appear to be your forte my friend.
---
Paid transfers will only make faction imbalance and overpopulated/underpopulated server problems worse. There’s virtually zero chance we’ll see them for the next 3 months at least while these things are big problems.
---
Wetlands is a cool zone.
---
KEEP YER FEET ON THE GROUND!!

---
PvP problem has PvP solutions. A strategy for all players in a PvP server is to join groups and guilds that can defend them in those situations. That's part of the meta-game of the server type.
---
Yup. While I hate what's going over there, It's important to separate the government from its people. These posts give me hope because we at least share some values, and maybe we can use those to a better future, together.
---
I mained a mage all through vanilla. Me and a lock buddy would 2 man scholo just for fun and extra cash. I'm not mental enough to think they're bad classes by any means, but when you get a bad one, I'll toss hunters into this as well, it can ruin the whole run. 
---
But any bad player can do this. It only takes 1 bad dps to keep pulling aggro so I have to use my taunt repeatedly for them so it's not up when the healer gets aggro. 
---
It gets so much worse in ubrs and the 60 dungeons.
---
Imagine how fit we would all be if they came up with some VR doohickey where we had to walk/run to actually walk/run in game.
---
I think esports would just become sports
---
Thunderbluff is where you wanna be.
---
Sure, but did it have a clock?
---
The greens start coming in from quest rewards around 14-15. You should have a green with either stam or strength on it on most slots by 17. If you don't, checking out if there's any good cheap things on the AH isn't a bad idea, ~20silver to go from a grey to a good +4stam+4strength green pants can be worth it to a struggling warrior.
---
Comments like this mean so much, thanks for the support mate!
---
You shouldn't be pulling like that without mages.  The ability to kite and mitigate damage due to frost is what allows for those big pulls
---
Took me about a year to get it in vanilla. So sad they released it on this braindead patch where you can do it in lvl 55 greens. 
---
For the smart boys: yea sure you all got 15 times better for every year that has passed. It’s just that you still do every encounter like 15 years ago
---
I'm sure some of these purchased ingots are dirty though
---
I have no way to prove it obviously, but you actually didn't even need to layer abuse to kill devilsaurs. At least not on my realm. I guess that's the advantage of not playing on any of the top 3 most populated servers of your region. I could for the most part just chill ride around while watching YouTube or a movie on my other monitor while checking in on the patrol patterns.
---
But you sound like someone that has already made up your mind about anyone that has more accumulated wealth than you.
---
Is this the correct item priority for Druid?
---
Bear: Are
---
Cat: Agi
---
Healing: Int
---
No, it was female.
---
FOR THE HORDE ! FOR THE REMINISCENCE!
---
Someone in chat said it was streamed, but couldn't find anything...
---
I've healed through Mara easily underleveled as ret.
---
I don't care about posts like this. Pure garbage.
---
You're assuming that everyone cares as much about Sulfuras as you do. It is extremely expensive to craft, it seems the majority of guilds and players would much rather have the gold from selling the ingots now and buy them back later if ever needed.
---
./ignore
---
I seriously tried to get an owl but couldn’t find any meat. Settled on the moonstalker runt just because fish was readily available in Darkshore.
---
Idk, I vastly pref ns for insta chain lightnings/bolts, also insta heals
---
I disagree and happen to really enjoy the talent that is presented on this sub. I have even reached out to some artists for commissioned work. To each their own I guess (afk blowjob time)
---
Well, considering that on retail I get gold spammed all the time, usually many times a day, and on classic I've literally not once received a single spam message of any type....
---
He can be killed with spells/ranged attacks.
---
Confirmed
---
&gt;While writing this, I sure start to feel like I'd benefit from some AH addon :) 
---
I have to admit that I kind of obsessed about these parts of the game, and I think I have 3 different AH Add-ons right now haha
---
Auto downvote for asmon crap.  It's not his build he's just copying another anyways.
---
is there a guild progression tracker for classic? even if it's manually updated? Trying to find a decent raiding guild but I have no information to go off of.
---
Who got the first Rag and Ony kills in China? And how did they place in world rankings?
---
Why is it going to get toxic? If that’s the way he wants to play, what difference does it make to anyone else?
---
No we know they are there. The only place we wouldn’t have documented knowledge of would be the gigantic wandering turtle shrouded in fog.
---
Spot on fella
---
Please Blizzard make an animated series.
---
This and also a lot of these players use internet cafe computers and their own account until they can afford a PC. I used to use google translate and have conversations with the chinese players on the private servers. Most of them were really funny but they always ask the same three questions:
---
How old are you?
---
Are you in school?
---
Are you married?
---
Something being legitimate isn't defined about what can be done, but what is allowed to be done. That's pretty much the definition of legitimate.
---
Hate to break it to you, it’s all Warcraft and laughs before you touch IRL politics and they (we) suddenly switch to the ethnic-purging racist ultra-national fascist mode. Lots of things happened during the past few years and Chinese people are no longer the ones who would use machinimas to protest against censorship a decade ago. 
---
Let’s not ruin this moment with the depressing stuff.
---
I would say the best pre-40 gathering profession for money making is Mining. Skins and Herbs you have access to pre-40 don't sell for much over their vendor value on the AH.
---
Still, even if you vendor all your herbs and skins, it's still more income. Herbalism obviously pairs with Alchemy, which is great for Priests. Leveling Herbalism now will save you time later if you do decide to go Herb/ Alch for endgame. Money can be made other ways like fishing. You will also see a lot more gold from quests and vendoring grays after level 35 or so.
---
Tailoring is a money pit unless you are very good at sniping deals for Cloth on the Auction house and then turning a profit from selling bags. It is another great choice for Priests endgame, though. You can craft great pre-raid gear including some healing Robes that could last you well beyond Molten Core.
---
If you plan to PvP a lot, Engineering is a good choice for an end game profession, and pairs well with Mining, which you could pick up now to make money pre-40.
---
just read the post..?
---
Three mages and a druid tank is the best comp for aoe runs imo. Stealth pulling the whole courtyard in SM works fucking great. As a healer, it has been the easiest and best exp for me.
---
But USA tells me China BAD and we need to wage economic warfare and ruin them!
---
Yeah, what I hate is when they’re at 30% and not drinking. You sit there a few seconds, waiting to see if they drink, and everyone is like go go go. 
---
And most of the time you shrug, pull, and it’s fine. Other times you pull, a patrol comes in or something, and the healer goes OOM and shit hits the fan.
---
Then you’re left wondering if you were the ass for pulling, or they were the ass for not drinking. And you can ask “ready?” or “need to drink?” in those situations  but by the time they respond you’ve often been standing around 30 seconds and the rest of the team is like “wtf go go go”.
---
Sometimes I feel like healers just don’t want to waste water, so they see how far they can push it and assume no pull will go wrong. I get it. Waters expensive. Just kind of a shitty situation all around.
---
I mostly just keep an eye on their mana and tell them to say “oom” or “drinking” if they definitely want me to wait.
---
Yes. That’s why I posted this thread.
---
Good one
---
It's BIS above raid gear (real BIS, not dungeon BIS) until AQ comes out.
---
It should pay for your epic mount at the very least.

Why do people call AoE "Spell Cleave?"

But but dwarves man!

---
In playing Druid and I read in guides to do item swapping for when I'm DPS and Healing. Intelligence for healing and agility for Cat form DPS.
---
I'm only level 24. 
---
Is it really a big difference swapping from gear with 8 agility combined to gear with 8 intelligence?
---
At what stat amounts does swapping really show benefits?
---
LOL, not racist btw LMAO
---
They have ranged weapons, but if you are on a roof you can LOS them indefinitely.
---
Was it? Didn't notice
---
Yeah I don’t believe you at all.
---
Hell yeah! For Reminiscence!
---
also takes an inventory slot. blink doesnt!
---
I literally just transferred to this server today. Tons of guilds recruiting for end game dungeons/raids, plenty of people looking for groups in trade and /world, and A LOT of alliance on constantly. No issues at all. Better than any other server I've been on, honestly.
---
Does more points in Intelligence increase the amount you heal by? How much intelligence affects the healing amount?
---
Honestly most dungeons are done in under 60 pulls.  Even drinking once per pull you're not making too much
---
Not applicable, because guards can technically reach them (if they did somehow aggro).
---
And I'm pretty sure China had Sulfuras first and not the posted one from today
---
&gt;once people actually have money they’ll buy them for 300g per set...
---
I've been selling the gauntlets for 74-82g and the leggings for 165-180g, so almost 300 already. But like you said, the economy on my server is getting established as we speak. Won't be the same on a completely fresh server.
---
As a new WoW alliance player, I am very jealous of the horde starting zones.
---
You've been on it a day. Give it some time.
---
Alliance quests: talk to A then run to B, all filled with great story and dialogue. Showing an evolving storyline and lineage of masons fighting back for just payment. 
---
Horde: "Where's my wife?" Go kill some boar mouthbreathers!
---
Salvation is the warning. Pray that you don't get BoPed as a melee DPS.
---
Reminds me of the older Internet days where we had computer cafes in America and the common question was A/S/L?
---
THAT TOO!
---
Can you please teach my partner how to Warrior then? NEVER has bag space and wants to go see a vendor while I've got 10 slots left and **I'm** the Hunter!
---
Respecting to resto at 60 hurts.
---
Yeah cause people that know how to play there class are totally limited to the no lifers who rush to 60. Strong equivalency
---
pretty sure he was drinking before he pulled.
---
I'm not on one of those high/full servers that almost always has a queue. I'm on Stonespine which is more of a med/high pop server
---
They are needed to craft higher level potions only but the vials the crafting menu says you need
---
You need different vials to make different potions. The more expensive the vial, the higher level the potion.
---
Not true sometimes groups are at their limit clearing a dungeon.   I started healing mara at 43 as ret with very little gear.   My mana bar was used most pulls but I drank back up
---
Money from Herb comes later, if you want to farm for your mount you should drop it for  Skinning.
---
Tailor isn't good money either. It's gives you your BIS chest for a while but don't expect to make any money, except maybe with mooncloth bags but thats much later and it's not really good either.
---
Different potions require different vials. The higher skill required the more expensive vial.
---
More expensive vials are used for higher level recipes.
---
You should buy the type of vial the recipe you're making requires, they can't be substituted.
---
I got overwhelmed when I got auctioneer and some other addon simultaneously, suddenly hovering over any unit gave me 5 lines of data about what prices they have gone for last 24hrs in AH and aaaaah. I need AH addon just won't harass me when I'm not at AH :)
---
Buy the vials*
---
That’s actually really cool in your case. And I don’t mind it in moderation. If I commissioned artists I’m sure it would be more appreciated.
---
Someone posted world first Sulfuras today or yesterday, but i thought I read somewhere China had it 2-3 days ago.
---
Better recipes require more expensive vials
---
Agreed. My favorite was having a tank one time after every pull, would stop and slowly type out "/s drink" after i had already been drinking 5-10 seconds.
---
I leveled an alliance rogue with the combat build to 30 before swapping to a horde rogue on a pvp server, speccing backstab. The teamplay is phenomenal. Soloing is definitely easier with a straight combat rogue, but with a leveling buddy who can pull the aggro and in dungeons the backstab wins by a lot. Gouge into backstab outdamages sinister strike on a combat rogue in my experience so far, too.
---
Rogue crying cause he didn't get a kill attacking a half life priest...lol
---
Whelp, there’s the sword
---
Let me put it to you this way.  Metzen's art portfolio wouldnt get him a job at Blizzard today.  It's good, but its not great.
---
I remember back in vanilla regular groups were always utilizing crowd control and smart pulls, playing carefully etc... 
---
Now in Classic groups are rarely ever doing any of that stuff and are just running in there with out a thought. So it's a lot more stressful healing and I am starting to see a lot more demand for healers in the higher levels maybe even more than tanks.
---
You don't, they are actually the original cancer of the game.  Unless blizz plays some distribution thing based on gear score, which would make these people screech, they effectively make battlegrounds up to level 39 completely unusable.  You know the level 60 camping the 20-30 zone because they are frustrated with being a bad player?  Only pure battlegrounds.
---
I guess you're trolling. Cause that never happened to me. On retail they post on trade channels sometimes (rarely) and on classic they spam invite people in the groups (constantly).
---
Western Democracy is pure and untouched by capitalist bloodsuckers btw!
---
Money is used for the greater good and not hoarded by the already wealthy who use it to control governments and populations!  Only China and Russia bad!
---
How do you come to that conclusion?
---
Well...I played horde back then. We used in Wrath to mess with the alliance in Stromwind Portal room.
---
We jumped the alliance boat from northern to Stromwind, run up the to second gate from from the docks. Jump up on the ledge in the gate, the wall above the first part of the wall didn't have any collision. We then ran under Stormwind to find the mage tower portal room. Which is/was just a whole in the ground. Then jump in it from the top and stand on the top of the bookcases. Me as resto shaman. A hunter, sometimes a mage or paladin, our Main Tank warrior, and a Deathknight. That was our most usual team. The warrior was full block gear (due to trail of the crusader), so he could more or less oneshoot shield slam. Me playing healbot, out of reach from all but range classes. And I could sometimes break LoS up there too.
---
It was great fun, because when people ported to Stormwind from elsewhere, would be pvp tagged. We could just jump them and hold the portal room. Usual we could hold the place for between 45mins to 1,5 hours, before we would be zerged down. 
---
I am pretty sure that would been a report able offence, by the above description. However, none of us, ever got any warnings or anything. And this was something we did 2-5 times a week, for a very long time.
---
When I rolled for Classic I went alliance because I had always played horde. I wanted to see the other half of the game. I think it likely many others felt the same way and rolled opposite of how they played before which would account for majority playing horde now
---
How so you show the level and class in chat
---
What should my tanking rotation be at level 22 for dungeons?
---
Thanks for that! Huge tip that I will keep in mind, especially cause that means I better only put 1 point in Weapon Expertise once I have the +4 Swords offhand sword from BWL. Anyhow, I got some more stuff to mention for ya:  
---
**Lockpicking Section**  
---
I am not sure if it is a classic specific bug or what it was, but the 70-110 section and 110-150 section are the wrong way around. (Same in this guide: https://vanillaguides.com/2018/07/30/1-300-lockpicking-guide-for-vanilla-world-of-warcraft-wow-classic/) - Go check for yourself. When I was next to the Windshear mine I could open and level at the outside boxes from 90 to above 100, but inside the mine the lockbox was red. So either you are wrong, or Blizz somehow patched it to be the other way around?  
---
**1% Dodge over 1% Parry?**  
---
Maybe you know something that I don't, but when I researched stuff, I found out that Parry is strictly superior to dodge in any way. Players can only Parry and Dodge frontal attacks, but parry unlike dodge also lowers your swingtimer. So why would you pick 1% dodge over 1% parry in some of your talent builds?
---
Only way they can out-theat my wanding to be fair.
---
You're the one who thinks genocide is fine as you jumped to defend it when China does it, so you have no ground to point at the USA.
---
&gt;  but he was polite about at the end.
---
the fuck no he wasnt lol
---
funny as fuck and your loot luck is pretty... wow.
---
Honestly with down ranking abilities, shocks, totems, disease cleansing, poison cleansing and everything else I'd recommend you having a 12 buttons mouse.  
---
I have around 36 abilities on keybinding and I'm still pression some abilities like food, drink, rez, waterwalking, breathing, etc.
---
This server is not dead! What do you consider, dead? I suggest anyone reading this reddit post to try out heartseeker on a lvl 1 and tell me that it's dead....
---
This these neck beardy types that are always horrible DPS or bad at whatever role they fill, but will never admit that. It's always everyone elses fault for pulling too fast or whatever.
---
luckily I have largely dodged this type so far, but WOW is a breeding ground for that type of "I prefer to play my own superior unique style, you wouldn't understand."
---
It.. It literally happened. All raid bosses got reset.
---
it does but a lock who knows what hes doing has a lot of utility to keep himself safe and can be super good at getting mobs grouped up for the novas and blizzards. in a pug, id rather have the warrior, but I think the 1 priest, 1 lock, 3 mage comp has the higher ceiling.
---
Tell him to HMU my girlfriend lives there
---
What's touch run farm?
---
If only it would drop loot other than the staff and shoulders! I’ve been spamming SM for 5 levels now and have yet to see any other loot.
---
I will defend pancakes unto death
---
Nah. The only reliable strat is a coordinated rush, it's been 15 years, it's a fact
---
12 buttons mouse is your solution
---
I've been full resto and I'm lvl 33 currently. It really isn't all that bad. I rock a quick dagger with flametongue and shield and even questing solo is fine. I tend to drop my searing totem with Mana or healing totem and attack away with a shock or two thrown in. Makes healing dungeons easy. I also don't have to worry about carrying multiple sets of gear. But when I was in the shimmering flats I was comparing kill times next to an enhance shaman with a 2h WF and honestly we were just about even but I didn't have to drink as often which I prefer. Also my survivability is far better and I also prefer that. 
---
But now that I just re-read your question, if you only do dungeons then log off, I would definitely be straight resto.
---
This is all my personal preference and opinion and I don't min/max so take this all with a grain of salt. Hope this helps a little
---
Need the things you are going to use. Greed the things you are going to sell. It's really that simple. Nobody deserves it more or less than the rest.
---
That was quick!
---
Thats what i was doing, so its nice to know, that i wasnt playing completly wrong :D
---
I just found it weird because in most guides it sounded like you should "only" use downranked spells if possible.
---
Thanks for the answer.
---
It's not an exploit because the mob can still reach you. Think before you type dude
---
Or transfer a level 40 and be stuck doing nothing but questing.
---
You know the big room of nonelites after 7 dwarves in BRD? Yeah those respawn really fast and give exp. So you send in your eye of kirogg or whatever its called, and pull all the mobs, and some mages aoe it down. It's stupid how fast exp this is, I've seen between 100-150k an hour.
---
destroying warriors with riposte and control is just fucking great. also solofarming brd grim guzzler and the fire ench boss is just great money making.
---
Rereleasing a game doesn’t undo all of the original achievements you spastic.
---
Oh yeah for sure assholes like that deserve to die(ingame) but just saying  that its worse then wasting 1 drink
---
What does that even mean? " a plug for some loud"?
---
I'm old.
---
The difference is night and day. A regular group with one or even two casters is pulling 3-7 mobs a pull and its taking 30-60 seconds or even more. A cleave group is pulling twice that amount and doing it in half the time. Its literally 2-4 times faster. Mana wise its about the same because if you are single targeting mobs, you are burning a ton of mana for DPS on one target. If you are AOEing, the cost is the same for a mage whether its 3 mobs or 12. Thats why its more effective, because if I can cast 1 blizzard at 500 mana and land that on 10 mobs, thats better/more efficient than doing the same to 5 mobs. Or throw out a cone of cold for 300dmg per mob and hit 10 of them, thats 3000 dmg in one cast not counting crits vs. against 4 mobs where Im doing 1200dmg. In either case I have to drink all the time and will be mostly OOM after 2-3 pulls in either group.
---
Of course OOM is relative. Without cooldowns, just having a potion/mana stone for any given fight (every 2 mins), my effective mana in every fight is about 5k mana. Add in evocation and celestial orb, I have from 8-10k mana per fight if I have those off cooldown at level 39.
---
Except for the fact that due to BGs being so far out, everyone is gonna have their twinks ready by the time they get released.
---
Lmao what.
---
OP is absolutely not the upset one here. The guy who declined him because spellcleaves exist is a buttblasted lunatic.
---
For now...until President Winnie The Pooh is done genociding people.
---
Zandalar has an ancient city on it, the other two islands existed in WC3 canon.

Farm maraudon, 25 to 50g and hour
---
Genocidal fascist dictators aren't playing WoW, people like you and I who live in China are.  Better keep immediately attacking China as soon as you hear the name though, USA will reward you.
---
What dungeons are you in right now?
---
If warlock is pulling with eye, you have a priest healer, since the eye has like 5hp. Shield eye, run around and aggro until the shield flickers and the ye dies, everything turns around and runs for the warlock. Mages slow with blizzard and everyone prays you don't have too many casters/ranged to interrupt you enough to go OOM before they are all dead.
---
Alternative is any healer and a tank that aggros shit and runs back to group it up. Warlock group is more efficient due to a 4th AOE'er (the warlock)
---
Finally, someone who knows the class in this thread. Great write up, man.  There’s so much misinformation about leveling a priest on them interwebs.
---
It's not an exploit because the mob can still reach you, think before you type and maybe people won't think you're a retard.
---
Oh and one more thing:  
---
If this is correct, Lethality is grossly overrated on Combat Rogues, maybe rather put points in something like Aggression even? 
---
http://solfyre.blogspot.com/2006/07/serrated-blades-and-deadliness.html
---
yeah i know i 90% have to heal at 60, id go resto all the way but drinking every 5 min kills me XD
---
thank you for saying this. Like, just feel out the group and move at everyone's pace. Understand casters can drink in combat if they started before combat and don't get hit.
---
Whenever I see a post on here like "MY ROLE is X and my JOB is Y and my JOB IS NOT Z and CLASS you should ALWAYS DO THIS" all I can think is "this person sounds like a strange control freak that I'd never want to run in a group with"
---
They have guns
---
Works both ways for some players. I’m far more docile when my faction outnumbers the alliance by an annoying margin. On a similar note, when alliance outnumber us I am more aggressive. 
---
I am playing a lock for now. My basic PvP mentality is you will be ganked if you’re on my kos, and if a mob is really contested, I’ll throw a warning dot on you with a /shoo or a fear. 
---
About 50% of the time they leave. The other 50% they heal up and try to fight. That’s what I want. If you can beat me or get enough friends to claim the spot more power to you- you just made my session way more enjoyable- I’m not racing to 60 my fun is NOW.
---
Doing nothing? Tell that to all the guilds recruiting, all of the people LFG in general, trade, lfg, and world chat, and all the people I’ve ran dungeons with since this morning.
---
This guy is a troll. Please, don’t let him discourage you from coming to Heartseeker. Horde or alliance

---
I recommend getting to really know your talents through and through and build your own spec suited to your needs and desires for maximum effect.
---
Classic is full of downtime.
---
If you live in China willingly then you are implicitly supporting genocide, and trying to deflect from that by pointing at other countries I have never even been to doesn't change it.
---
You're brainwashed as fuck dude.
---
Good :)..
---
What's with all this people spreading misinformation? There's no layering exploits in raids. It's a bug that exists since vanilla and it's normal that the people that got the bug could clear the raid, that they are strangers or not had no incidence. We had it happen to us (the guild I was in) twice in vanilla and each time we could clear the raid without any issues of being banned.
---
People are so envious now days, it's becoming really toxic...
---
Doesn't really work on classic as well.
---
Only Blizzard can say, but very doubtful. It's been 15 years, don't see it changing now.
---
New to WoW and the auction house. When looking at an item when should I be thinking "sell to vendor" and when should I be thinking "sell by auction"?
---
So you're cool with China being run by a fascist imbecile? You're cool with China engaging in genocide? You're cool with China murdering political dissidents? You're cool with China using racial minorities to farm themselves some free organs?
---
Without mentioning the United States, describe the bad things China does.
---
Just healed scholo with 58, UBRS with another healer at 57, and a full strat run. Healer level requirements should be relaxed, but tank and DPS will vary significantly with +2 levels as Scholo, Strat and LBRS will have enemies higher then 60 resulting in more misses/resists and depending on class lack of spell ranks.
---
Am boomer, can confirm I've never heard clout used that way by my peoples.
---
On my server you can make like 4g an hour just collecting the un goro soil. The mining is the side event.
---
Oh for sure, and I'm thankful for those systems in place, but obviously would not want to have to utilize them in the first place.
---
I mean you can all just leave and regroup
---
Sug sug. Have you been to Orgrimmar lately though? Big fire there. Very impressive. As big as dwarf head on wall in picture.
---
You seem awful invested for a person not on the server 24 hours yet....
---
to be a caught without mana as a healer while everyone is red around you is such a stressful place to be.
---
Great music too. Rather JRPG sounding
---
Carry Mara runs when you get the gear to handle it solo. You can advertise and sell it to rogues, druids, or other hunters seeking their ring. You can farm felcloth, tyrs hand, hearthglen, or satyrs. Honestly just actively ah things, pickup all loot, and finish dungeon quests. One lbrs run plus quests last night was 66g.
---
!remindme 10 hours
---
Hey! My skin isn’t green. It’s more like a mottled curdled milk with rotten spots.
---
wow, who knew running circles around an area mining ore was a way to make gold?
---
that's thinking outside of the box
---
Of course! Thank you very much for the clarification. Completely overlooked that.
---
i'm only 42 so far, but Bosses are always the easy encounters to heal. Thrash pulls are often far more taxing for my mana.
---
In fact as a Priest i often go full dps on the boss, after level 40 and shadowform/vamp Embrace.The healing from that is often more then enough to hold the tank up most of the time :)
---
got your mount yet?
---
just curious
---
&gt;	citation needed.
---
Gives citation.
---
&gt;	I don’t care everyone is so cringe.
---
Shouldn’t you be asleep ready for school tomorrow?
---
They were not going for 300-400g in vanilla. I think you are mistaking it for something else
---
good to know bruh
---
You been eating onions?
---
Also an important fact is aggro range. With 58 im fully capable of healing LBRS without effort. There are still some farm groups who only take 60s due to aggro radius and they'd have to clear quite a few more groups with a lowbie.
---
Not bis but pretty close to maiden's circle and way cheaper, at least on my server.
---
Hi, /u/Lobstercorgi555

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d7fin4/even_you_can_be_friends_with_the_enemy/). 
---
for me, low lvl dueling (either in WoW or Diablo 2) was all about min/maxing to the extreme in order to get the edge on the other dueler and less about smashing poor pubbies.
---
The proc is, you're still lose out on the weapon skill however, which is non-negligible and requires changing other gear around to compensate for. Keep in mind I didn't say BRE was *bad*, I said it *wasn't as good*.
---
BRE also gets worse the further enemy armor is reduced toward zero.
---
Yeah I discovered this while farming Stranglekelp, didn't remember that being a thing haha.
---
Nu6i6
---
Will it? 
---
I mean I hope so but there are megarealms with 20K people trying to play at prime time. You really think Blizz will just eliminate the layers and let 3,000 play while 17K wait in 15 hour queue or whatever?
---
Holy shit lmao.
---
Everyone born in a country that commits crimes has to move or else they support it!  Absolute buffoon.
---
Estimated ticket response time: 16 hours
---
Nope, 50/90g.
---
My armorsmithing has eaten up a ton of the gold. Honestly I think it’s been more gold intensive than my enchanter was.
---
a rule of thumb i use for deciding if an AH wep is: is the AH price - vendor cost more than you can get in an hour of grinding? if so i won’t buy it.
---
example: i got a green gun at level 32. it was 2g on the AH and vendored for around 1g ( if memory serves ). i easily made 1g in an hour of grinding at the time, so in the end i essentially paid 1g for the gun which i got bacn within an hour, while also greatly improving my grinding speed. 
---
so in this case the effective cost would be 5g, which is probably more than you could reliably get back hassle free. i myself got the shadowforge bushmaster ( or whatever the lv38 blue gun from uldaman trash is called )  for 3.5g AH, which is a total cost of 2.2g, which i could easily get back in an hour. 
---
so if you can get back that 5g hassle free, have a lot of bank to spare ( mount + training + around 30g ), or are sure it will last you min 4 levels, i’d advise against it. i’m still using that gun at lvl 43 so even if i’d paid 6g for it the sheer lvl speed increase would be worth it.
---
So I have that Temple quest and it says find the temple and go back to the guy in SW? Is that right? What's the point?
---
It’s called being honest. And I’ve been looking to transfer here since before it hit 10k total people.  Constantly talking to people to ask about the community, and grouping, etc. I finally transferred because I knew it would be smart.
---
Yes, it’s been less than 24 hours. And I pray I’m not wrong about everything I’m saying, but so far, this is a huge step up from Kirtonos alliance so....
---
A lot of people complaining about the drop rate, I found out the syndicate in Durnhold drop the skulls as well at a seemingly much higher rate. Stumbled across this while stealing syndicate emblems and lockpicking as a rogue.
---
This was super well done and fucking hilarious. Also you have insane luck!
---
Haha, thank you, mate! At the moment, I only have a comic book goal on my Patreon. But you never know. Maybe in the distant future some animated shorts will be possible.
---
It was a huge thing. They even made a song about it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dkkf5NEIo0&amp;t=135s
---
".. their name will pop up with a **note** saying they wiped you on an escort when you were level 30 (if you use it like me). "  
---
How do you do that?
---
Most players have played both factions over the years. Nobody really buys into any stereotype since we are mostly adults playing an old game.
---
Not a lot of competitive 1h axes for Orcs in Phase 1 though (and the best swords are also highly sought after by Rogues), leading 2h Fury to typically be better for Orcs in Phase 1, using hamstring spam to fish for Windfury procs - something Alliance can't do.
---
If only this was funny 😕
---
Maybe if their culture didnt openly encourage exploiting/cheating/rulebreaking youd have a point LMAO XXXDDDD
---
I’m 49 and I’ve seen a Nighblade drop in ZF and this ring today in Mara, but I’m not lucky enough to win them.
---
The majority of players have not even reached the 50s, you said it yourself you were in the first 50 to hit 60. You are playing with the hardcore crowd (more likely to min max) and then playing a sub optimal spec (bad for min max). Wait some time for more relaxed players to start raiding then you will be fine.
---
In paragraph 4, you joined a guild as holy, that's a mistake. If you are playing as a non optimal spec or meme spec then join as that spec that way there is no confusion or hiding it, you are either accepted or you aren't. I'm a bear tank druid and I joined my guild (before launch) as that, I am not changing nor respecing to resto (as a whole I mean, I can still change for a raid here and there)
---
In paragraph 5 this is wrong, many things were done back then that players wouldn't do nowadays because they know better and yes if you aren't useful then by all means players can and do have the right to stop you.
---
Also in the post you say you were gkicked if u didn't change which you didn't change but then in the comments you say you would leave guild like you chose to leave when you found out you couldn't actually be shadow so which actually is it?
---
You are a saint. This will be referenced for years to come.
---
The grass is always greener, right?
---
I didn't know that was even possible this early.
---
Spent 1.5h on that quest alone.
---
As a fellow healer, your "opinion" is invalid. The real good tanks wait for me to regen up before aggroing half of blackrock depths in 1 pull.
---
I've seen videos of layering as you cross into a new zone. But you aren't doing that if you are sitting.
---
Congrats!!
---
You're the one that won't acknowledge genocide in Yemen
---
Well that sucks lol. I'm on Blaumeux server by the way. Maybe it depends on level range? I'm still in the 30s doing SM so maybe that's a difference
---
This is the right answer. There are a ton of guides and addons to help point you in the right direction of where you should be levelling, where to find all the quest mobs, how to make gold, what's your pre-raid BiS... basically holding your man-child hand the entire time. In 2004 we had zero clue where to get good gear, where to find all the quest items, etc etc. It was all new and required tons of time to explore. It will never be the same as the first time but it's still fun as hell.
---
To be fair if people are selling them there is always the possibility that they were exploiting layering themselves. With how sought after they are right now it seems weird that they wouldn't have anyone in guild interested in keeping the ingots for themselves. Then again I am just speculating.
---
I use the dps warrior mentality while tanking, just charge in and beat the piss out of things
---
Links to subs?
---
Undertale - Megalovania :)
---
Wasn't enough that Stv, desolace, badlands, etc are all full of roaming bands of hordies, now they gotta invade Stormwind as well.
---
Well I guess dozens of comments from 2007 on Wowhead must be a conspiracy! Seriously though, just read the comments on the link I posted.
---
the tank is there to group them up before the mages explode them
---
Normal was more popular than PvP in retail vanilla
---
Every pack of mobs that has live trolls has a chance to have Shadow Casters which are ranged mobs. Then eventually the ones with bows come along. Dude have you ever even done it?
---
This may come as a surprise, but China is actually a country, not an ethnicity. When someone says "Chinese gold farmer," they are referencing nationality, not literal Han Chinese people. So making a dig at nationality isn't racist.
---
Think I used all my luck up on this run, get nothing now lmao
---
I'd rather see your artwork!
---
It's not "putting it on a pedestal" to acknowledge that weapon skill is pretty important; +5 (from racial) amounting to +3% hit (or \~1/3 of the total hit needed to cap). It's why the majority of raiding Warriors are Orc/Human, and Edgemaster's Handguards is BiS for every other race.
---
That isn't to say BRE isn't good, but specifically for an Orc, Sulfuras is at least equal, and there are several other factors to consider, as detailed above.
---
I like them, simply because I envy them.
---
*Laughs in Paladin*
---
Doubt it
---
False. The difference between peacemaker and Dal Rends is 6 attack power.
---
With dual wield, you enchant 15 agility, giving you 30 agility, 5 more agility, thus outweighing peacemaker.
---
Umm ok. I don’t blame the rogue. I blame missing the right key.
---
Damn him with faint praise!
---
As a new classic tank in wow, I like my healers like I like my belly. Full and happy before I do hard work. It’s not that I am waiting on you, I just don’t want dps to screw up or my aggro to screw up and you need to spend way more mana then usual.
---
I do this if i have a mage.. but if i'm consuming my own drinks, you bet your ass i'm waiting till i'm completely full to start healing.
---
So why did your guild let an orc have a druid weapon?
---
I've had the best of times with druid tanks as well :) If they are decent players they perform outstandingly in 5-mans.
---

Really..? Do we even have to bring this word up as a response to a rather harmless joke like this?
---
I'm still wondering why trolls bottle their sweat and someone would pay for that.

All tabks should be made to roll a healer before they can tank a dungion.
---
problem is all healers should beade to roll a tank before they can heal a dungion..
---
Sweet, thanks!
---
I acknowledge and condemn it, but it literally has nothing to do with this and you only point to it to try and deny another genocide.
---
Do you acknowledge and condemn the genocide that China is committing?
---
Hey man! Just a friendly reminder that you suck!
---
Blasted lands offers you a random drop chance for a green item that you can turn in for random 45-55 green loot you could disenchant, also all the beasts there drop quest item that sells for a fair chunk on AH. Also has some humanoids for cloth if you need it. I made a ton of gold from there recently
---
How do you get the chat box to show "[1]" instead of "[1: General ...]"? I didn't see a setting, is it an addon?
---
Yesterday during an Armory run I had a lvl 42 warrior who was doin g fantastic at holding aggro. Also had a Warlock that slapped a soul stone on him, and I was a shaman with reincarnation. We all agreed about half way through that we had plenty of ways to recover from a wipe and to just go ham. 
---
Was pretty fun, the tank certainly put that soulstone and my reincarnation to the test. He had 2 minutes on his soulstone so we decided to pull the last y’all before Herod and try to go as ham as possible. We wiped, but just popped right back up and kept going. 
---
Best part about the whole run was that everyone was aware and working as a group. We all laughed when we did that pull because we knew we were going to die ahead of time. I think a lot of issues from dungeons come from people assuming they are gonna be blamed for something. I typically always try to talk with the people I’m in a group with, males it easier to bring up issues or suggestions. I get the occasional person telling me to shut up when talking in between pulls, but I don’t blame them (probably the same type of person who gets mad when someone says ding/welcome/hello in guild chat).
---
Emberstone and Cookie's in one run...That's cool just ignore my ~10 runs Blizz and never even got Emberstone.
---
This seems almost impossible.
---
I pretty much only played PvP, actually. S6/s7 gladiator. But the edge in PvP doesnt matter to everyone. Lots of people don't PvP
---
Thank you
---
There wasn’t as much information available back when the game launched so people are stuck on their cookie cutter mind sets and worrying over 5-10% more dps for raids that you don’t even need a full group for.
---
Keep in mind that 1.12 is not 2004 wow. Classes are tuned for Naxxramas. It's like if we went into Emerald Nightmare with fully juiced artifact weapons.
---
There are also vastly better resources than what we had back in the day. It's very easy for someone to just google what their best items are and how to get them. Boss mechanics are all known. You're also not in a group with 1-2 players connected to the internet by semaphore. You're not in a group with 1-2 players playing on computers with the computing power of a modern smartphone. Etc.
---
Lots of factors make it much easier even before considering how much more sophisticated instanced content is in retail.
---
also, those cost mana, spunds dumb, but in bgs like warsong or arsthi it's reasonable to save that tinybit of mana by using a normal mount :)
---
At least the skulls you can do over time alongside other quests in the area. The fucking Satyrs were one of the few quests I went to, farmed for 20 minutes, then just fucking gave up realizing how long it was going to take.
---
Good idea. I wish classic was free till level 20.
---
I'll have to download the retail client
---
I believe that was from stress test and it was changed later, I've never been layered moving zones, the only time I've been layered is being invited to a party of someone in another layer.
---
Ouch, I accept invites only from warlocks or undead. I understand it. 
---
I play undead warlock..
---
Yes, but they would be a position where players could fight back, and not exploiting as described by the OP.
---
When you say "random drop chance for a green item" do you mean it zone specific that anything in that zone has a chance to drop the item that can be turned it for another random item?
---
Feral gets 2.4 AP per strength in cat form and only 1 per agility plus some crit. Crit is very important for dps as well because you get extra combo points, so up until the crit cap agility is still good, but strength is a primary dps stat. Leveling wise I've been prioritising strength personally, but you shouldn't shun agility by any means. You get a lot of crit from talents as well as prebis so that's my logic.
---
Maybe it's like gypsy tears of wow?
---
What's your damage, mate? Very few people'll have two accounts camping auctions and fighting for node spawns with 10 other people for hours on end. And the type who would would likely also not be 60 /w the requirements for Sulfuras.
---
It's really a judgement call, but I'd suggest getting the addons auctioneer so you can post items that aren't too overpriced and will actually sell.
---
To answer your question, take into consideration a few things: 
---
- vendor price
---
- average auction price
---
- cost to list it for longer than 2 hours so it actually has a chance of selling
---
Then factor in that if it doesn't sell, you will forfeit the listing fee and have to pay it again to sell it. If all of this seems like too big of a hassle for only a marginal amount of money over the vendor price, then just vendor it. Otherwise it doesn't hurt to toss the item up for 2hrs during prime time at a small discount and test your luck.
---
Heh, another Druid visited Booty Bay :)  
---
You need to create a ticket to Blizzard, it really look like a bug.
---
Aren't they useful for world PVP once they introduce honor?
---
As a warlock I don’t expect to be healed when I life tap, I have a HS for a reason. If you want to toss a HoT my way, it is appreciated, if I pull Aggro after I tap just let me die lol.
---
Only the strongest survive
---
Aww I love them for that. Their like the Great Plains / African Plains. It's gorgeous looking across the entire landscape without boring trees in the way!
---
Depends on the kind of group you are running. This is true with melee comps that chain pull but if you are pulling multiple packs and AOE'ing them down with images, you'll wanna wait for everyone's mana.
---
Healer job is to heal and you dont do your job, you think you are right here?
---
DPS job is to do damage. if he does so much damage that he keeps pulling mobs from tank then tank is either undergeared or shit tier player.
---
And before you start usual spiel on "just hit tank targets 4Head" players are not mind readers. if there is no scull , cross, whatever mark on mob its his fault.
---
Not having any 60s is probably your problem tbf
---
There’s an add on that’s called prat that I use that has general as just [1]
---
u sound big mad
---
Yeah got my first pug kill on onyxia yesterday we wiped only once because ppl didn't wait to dps in phase 3 but the content is so easy that it can be done with everyspec
---
Not on Chinese realms. I remember choosing PVE in the very beginning because I was so afraid of PVP. My choice was very limited because the list was mostly PVP realms.
---
So only half of 10% got killed?
---
Now go make some alts while you wait for phase 2
---
Oh this guy went on constantly about me not hraling him
---
Nah, just mildly annoyed.
---
/u/tcran420
---
Done the addon: [https://github.com/LionelBergen/WowClassicSelectPartyPetsAddon/tree/master](https://github.com/LionelBergen/WowClassicSelectPartyPetsAddon/tree/master)
---
Turns out WoW has a setting for this already, so my addon just turns that setting on...
---
**However, you cannot turn it off once on. So be aware if you use this addon once, you cannot go back.**
---
I use an addon suite called ElvUi and it sets this up for me. I think you can use a standalone addon called prat as well. I vouch for elvui because it comes with nearly every quality of life thing you would need and sets itself up with the click of a button. It's also highly customizable. 
---
You have to get it from their own launcher though, so just google Classic Elvui
---
They only become efficient with a good amount of + healing which you'll get at 60.  
---
Generally while levelling the highest rank is always the most efficient.   
---
Try again at 60 with +400 healing and you'll quickly see the value in downranking. When you get to +900 healing it's ridiculously strong.
---
What a random ice block, no jebaiting there needed, he did it as you were running off already. Probably a clicker fumbling to press block or something very late.
---
Classic world first hand of ragnaros!
---
Nah because you'll just end up getting stomped by a higher level and even if you did manage to amass enough honor to progress ranks (you're limited to like rank 3 at most sub 30) you can't use any of the rewards anyways. Twinks are used to stomp people of your level bracket (10-19) who aren't twinked when BGs release.
---
Sounds like the worst dungeon group ever. Fuck those people.
---
Stay as you are, we like people like you.
---
Alliance is trash, horde players are more friendly and more helpful, and of course more funnier.
---
If inside an instance and you leave group, you will be removed from the instance and teleported back to home location.
---
Even if you form a new group in the instance. If you ejected the instance owner, you are all going to be removed.
---
&gt;Cleave's 2nd attack somehow manages to hit the mob behind me.
---
What server?
---
Ohhhh yea okay that makes sense. Thanks alot!
---
I lost the sound because of some wrong Shadowplay settings, sorry
---

---
Honestly this is the only tank I want to play with after playing with a few. I love when they set what seems like a ridiculous pace. It seems crazy at first but things start to become more consistent, DPS pull less threat, and the group generally starts to feel like they are streamrolling the dungeon. Plus you’re clearing really fast. Of course the healer and tank need to be in sync, and there will always be a few pulls where the tank needs to take a bit more time because they might be tricky, but overall fast paced tanks are the best.
---
Gets really annoying later. Yeah, kicking a single shadowbolt is usually not worth switching the target. But a SHADOWBOLTVOLLEY or a heal?  Please, pretty please do so. But I rather have rogue kicking everything kickable and doing half his DPS then not kicking at all or very rarely. 
---
It would be nice to have an addon that would either tell the group when they didnt interrupt a specific spell or congratulate the player who kicked a designated spell.
---
Didn't even hear about it as alliance on ashbringer, was it just one layer or something? Didn't seem to make much of an impact.
---
10% though, that seems quite low. You really want close to full mana once you finish drinking in case someone pulls an extra pack, and drinking takes 30 seconds. No way a tank will survive that long without healing.
---
Strat and scholo are pretty tough you usually wanna be 60 unless if you got a good group.
---
Add on to this, priest you don't always have to keep a bubble on the tank. As a druid I can't generate rage effectively when I'm not taking damage. If you want me to keep aggro then please bubble when I'm about 30% health and just keep a HoT on me or a few midsize heels going. I will keep aggro as long as I can use abilities.
---
I enjoyed reading this very much.
---
It's also more beneficial once you have lots of +Healing gear because +100 healing means a lot more to a rank 3 Healing Wave in terms of improvement versus a rank 5 HW.
---
raptors in stranglethorn vale, behind the arena
---
You need to be higher level than a Warrior or Druid to tank the same instance but it's totally doable.  I've tanked RFD and SM Cath as Enchancement shaman and I could hold aggro and I wasn't taking that much damage.  I doubt you can tank highler level instances.  Mana was a big issue and I needed to drink every 1-2 pulls
---
You should zoom out some more, your field of view is awful.
---
farm SFK till 30 then go to Desolace?
---
Are you drinking actual water from vendors? Where all the mages at oO
---
Or replace the lock with an actual tank for way better and safer runs.
---
I tried this and it took one asshole on our server to not listen and ruin it for everyone. He added hours and hours to everyone grind every single day and was a total dick about it.
---
Harmless joke btw LMAO
---
Among the more mystifying PVP decisions I've always thought is trying to gank a paladin. Like it didn't work when he was fighting the elemental what makes you think it's going to work now?
---
Is barrens chat a thing on all servers? Here on Kirtonos it's filled with people talking about Trump and SJWs constantly and other cancerous shit. I assumed it was just our server (I'm getting the feeling that some of them don't even play the game but just log in to chat in Barrens chat) but I see enough references to it on this subreddit that I'm wondering if it's common to all servers. What an interesting phenomenon if it's popped up on multiple servers.
---
Firemaw has a monster pop, still regularly get 2k queues at peak time.
---
For what? Best way to make money is to level up
---
What's a key?
---
World first in classic apart from the Chinese surely?
---
Apparently you do, I just said I dont think either are bad classes and I would party with them.
---
well actualy you don't have to drink after every pull, everything depend on the team. If the tank pull a big and the dps is low you will burn your mana realy quick, but if your team have good AoE dmg then you don't have heal too much. Once I did a stocakde run with a mage and warlock, tank pulled big groups(2 room and the aisle) and the dps melted the mobs, I used all of my mana in one pull but we cleared the whole dungeon realy quick.
---
Im not an r tard.....
---
don't ever admit to that online
---
according to the average age group that plays horde you just lost all credibility
---
I agree for the most part, but it is HIGHLY dependent on the tank, the healer, the DPS, and everyone's level/gear relative to the dungeon as well.
---
I've healed dungeons as a resto druid where I only had to drink after boss fights and could throw out HoTs and passively regen on the trash.  This was because the tank knew his shit, must have had a few points in prot, and was marking targets and the DPS was focusing them down one at a time.  It was BORING.
---
I've also healed dungeons where the tank is taking more damage and/or has trouble keeping aggro and/or the DPS is pulling aggro.  When I have to start tossing heals on other party members or have to cast higher rank healing touches on the tank, I will burn through mana MUCH faster.
---
Materials tend to be better sold on the AH even if right now the market is flooded. If it's a green item with desirable stats then you can check and see what similar gear is going for. Examples are agility leather armor would be more likely to sell than intellect leather armor.
---
The lock is better because they can pull more. The tank can't hold aoe threat anyways when blizzard/hellfire does so much damage.
---
You do for bosses.
---
Was just thinking the same thing. Leveling BS and an Armorsmith eats up so much potential gold of all the mats you have to invest :D
---
Somebody wins the lottery every few weeks though. The odds of somebody winning the lottery are 100%

When does ret dps fall off? So far up to 44 it seems like I’m never NOT #1 unless it’s aoe or a really short fight
---
What server are you on?  On stalagg 4am the mining nodes are still heavily camped in every major zone
---
People really like to overstate how supposedly bad everyone was back then. We had guides, rotations, dbm etc.
---
We are playing on the latter patches that made everything easier. Instances drop better gear and were nerfed, skills got buffed etc. Just look at the change logs.
---
Then you get a fresh instance without progress.
---
yeah, but consider armor when tanking too, since druids gain a massive bonus in bear
---
I usually do, but sometimes I zoom in for the immersion feeling. 
---
A late night in Stranglethorn is a good time for that, until some asshole rogue shows up.
---
more int=more casts
---
Very much this.
---
Nobody should be using Org as their crafting homebase unless they're an enchanter IMO.
---
Dont you have some layers to seethe over?
---
In my experience this is incorrect. Maybe you tried it with an under skilled or undergeared tank?
---
Fair enough. Just figured you would have when seeing someone around you like that. :p
---
Yes, except for horde.... horde bad ;)
---
And Pandaria the island isn't the same as the turtle.
---
If you're clearing the instance you need a tank for the bosses. Ideally the mages want a macro for rank 1 fire blast for the totems and it isnt a huge deal, but getting them to do it is another story. 
---
Than you get random mages that are arcane spec for aoe, which is so bad at lower levels, but decent for raids if I remember.
---
Hey yo, fellow warrior here. Your opener needs to change. Thunderclap as your first ability is no good for generating threat. The only threat it generates is the damage it does which is nothing. It's really best used for damage mitigation as it slows enemy attacks.
---
If you want to generate the most aoe threat, this is what you do:
---
Charge, bloodlust, defense stance, battle shout, demo shout
---
From there you can either start sundering targets or if you're 2h tanking you would want to ww. If you can, rend is very good at generating threat on targets you're not actively attacking.
---
You really shouldn't be wasting rage on shield block as it doesn't generate threat. I will usually use it to dump extra rage into or if I'm actually going to die and need to block hits. 
---
Remember, in general your ability priority is: *shield bash, battle shout, demo shout, revenge, sunder, rend. Make sure you're shouting, rending, and cleaving from defensive stance as you get 10% more threat. 
---
Good luck out there!
---
Basically this repeatable quest/turn-in https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=3501/everything-counts-in-large-amounts you have to get a random green gem drop from any mob in the zone and you turn in for a random green item. There is also a blue version but is much more rare
---
This statement is the dumbest thing I've ever read, you realise this is a classic wow subreddit? Dps need to watch their damage because a tanks threat doesn't work like it does in retail first off. Second, enable target of target in your interface and congrats you can see who your tank is targeting.
---
I was wondering if console port worked for classic. This is great news! Incoming couch leveling.
---
I'm not assuming anything. All I'm saying is that Sulfuras is the best wpvp weapon till R14 and Dark Edge.

From a lore perspective: lol no

Layering doesn't work in raids.

Most likely one layer, kinda ruined it.
---
I was just gonna turn in a quest and someone said "horde in goldshire" in general, and I was gonna check it out. Barely got to the gates.
---
Maybe it's because I balance myself out with alchemy but i'm level 34 and I don't have too much problem soloing 2 mobs my level. 1 above though and im fucked.

Not full spellcleave but they wanted to do bosses as well.
---
I feel like this is a political cartoon for our current world leaders...

It doesn't work for raids

I just dislike the min/maxing that people do. Yes Ret is weak but it's probably not going to ruin my night if I run with a few. Might just take longer. Big whoop.

It's not all about running that perfect comp, it's about having fun with others and doing content.

if you got a 50 ingots from exploit and you know that banhammer is coming will you unload them for gold on other accounts/RMT or keep them with yourself?

Well technically, first you invaded the natural habitat of this poor animal. Then you enslaved him/her while very likely also killed members of his/her own pride which might even include their own cubs. Then, youve made the poor thing fight other animals/monsters at your will for god knows how long. And all that for some food you'd throw at the poor thing once in a while to make sure he/she wont run away. At this point i wouldn't be surprised if the poor animal has developed some sort of PTSD where no amount of therapy will ever be able to make that poor thing happy again.

no thanks, tired of fucking wasting my drinks only to have to stop at 60-70% mana to fucking heal them again

When someone says best weapon people assume they mean best weapon and not 4th best weapon.

Thing is, so many people are "waiting to make a twink" that it'll probably be private sever syndrome, where so many people are twinked out that no one is really a twink. Like sure, you'll have full or close to BiS but so will most other people so you'll just mostly fight other twinks instead of two shooting noobs.
---
I was flying from Ratchet to Stonetalon to run down to Desolace. The gryphon brought me SOUTH to fucking Theramore, back up past Ratchet, through Desolace which was a kick in the stones, up to AUBERDINE and back down to Stonetalon. It was ridiculous. My friend ran from Ratchet to Stonetalon and he beat me there.
---
Oh. Historically mild summers and winters. Above average amounts of rain, but spread over time (not like the downpour that Texas got recently). 
---
It's not quite like it was when I was a child several decades ago, but relative to the rest of the US it's still the mild rainy place. Haha
---
Smite is horribly mana inefficient and should almost never be used while leveling. It’s not worth the gold to keep it ranked up. Smite is the least efficient DPM spell in a priests toolkit even when spec’d into Searing Light. 
---
So comparing mindflay and smite at 30 is a pointless argument. The correct answer is: neither should be used. Mind flay shouldn’t even be talented until a full shadow respec. It has minor value in wpvp until then, but imo the talents spent elsewhere are simply more valuable.
---
Also, Shadowform, darkness, and weaving kick in between level 40-45, not the 50s. I made a comment in this thread showing reasons why you might wait to 45 or go shadow early at 40.
---
I'm asking in ally world chat and no one even seems to have heard of it, not to try and take your steam or anything but I wanted to fight and it seems to have passed people by :(

Easy there hot shit. Layering doesn't work in raids
---
For reference, since the other side doesn't know what I'm saying, I decided to just say gibberish lol
---
WTF kind of server do you play on? Haven't seen a single gold seller in classic since launch.
---
This is true depending on the pull. If it’s literally right next to the previous pull then sure.
---
I used to play 2400+ rank in 2v2 arena. No way I could've done that with this FoV.
---
Only gear that says “increases spellpower and healing by X amount” modifies spell dmg/healing
---
Had a shaman in my group today who *refused* to switch away from Rockbiter. He kept pulling threat and he kept dying, by the end of the run so much so his weapon broke. 
---
At this point we've asked him to switch multiple times. His first response was "I'm a casual and I am not ashamed of that".
---
Like what? You're not being told to play great, your only being asked to not play *bad* by clicking one damn button. Flametongue.
---
If you're Horde it starts at [Gor'Shak in Kargath](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=3981/commander-gorshak)

---
I sent in a ticket with a pretty detailed reasoning on why my character could use a transfer and even offered to pay - GM response was the devs didn’t even incorporate a way to handle transfers originally and the process for the last time was a one time thing only. Granted not all GMs have the tip top knowledge, he worded it in a way that the answer will always be “no.”
---
Exactly! I've been a little frustrated how the mythic mentality has bled into classic.
---
Pandaria was also hidden in mist after the sundering
---
oh that's pretty cool then
---
That's the good shit
---
Fucking cat. &gt;:I
---
Thank you blizzard for adding layering so people like this can abuse it. No changes btw
---
How many people fit on a realm on average?
---
Essentially they were just using layering to farm the final boss.  
---
Go in with your full group, run the raid, kill the final boss. Then people would leave the group, and the system would kick them from that instance, into their own. This means the new instances would have their own respawned mobs and bosses.  
---
Others would then join that guy's group and just kill the boss again. And repeat.  
---
At least this is how I understood it.
---
That's a shame. They ported back just after I stopped the video, so it ended very quickly. I think they wanted to go to ironforge too.
---
I need to get a raptor so bad. Being a tauren on a raptor is amazing, you cant fit in any doorways at all lol
---
heals are not instant cast mate. "healers job is to heal" i mean that sounds great to a DPS who wont stop pulling aggro but the simple fact is, I cant heal everybody in the group all at the same time in a way that is going to leave enough mana to sustain the fight. What the healers job actually is, is to keep the tank alive so that he can do his job, which is to keep mobs off the DPS, and to that end the DPS needs to concede a little bit to let the tank build threat because aggro is not just free in classic.
---
Im alliance on Stalagg and its pretty lame, if I want to go to any contested zone I have to wake up early and do it when nobody is online.
---
I will note, there is an odd occurance happening, mages aren't learning to be mages, I had a mage doing his AOE combo on single targets in my group the other day... I don't have meters as a tank, maybe it's still efficient but, seeing him Nova 1 mob, CoC then Blizzard it... Interesting to see.
---
Shadowform increases shadow wand dmg? Didnt thought this is the case
---
Maybe your groups aren't doing much damage? Unless I'm  in a group single targeting what the tank is hitting mobs just kind of peel off the tank fast. Even like an agony and corruption pulls threat a lot for me. Tanks just dont generate that much threat in vanilla, and dps can easily out threat them. Spellclesve works because you literally just dont get hit while you have enough aoe to kill the mobs very quickly, you can literally pull as much as the lock can pick up with eye of killrogg
---
you guys have no idea what layers do. You can have 1 layer with 5000 people or 5 layers with 1000 people but that is still going to have a 5000 person server.
---
Whitemane transfers were to arcanite reaper/anathema not heartseeker.
---
The different class discord are good places for theorycrafting
---
Dungeons in classic don't have a lock out or saved instance per say , there is a limit as to how many times you can enter a dungeon portal per hour  but that's about it 
---
Raids on the other hand do have a lock out and saved instances and you can look at them in the raid tab
---
Did it have a queue? I'm on Faerlina so it almost always was full when I ran it.
---
What realm are you on? Maybe we’ll run into eachother!
---
You realize every moment spent reading about or playing this game is the same monumental waste of time for everyone right? Tryhard min max orc rogues and rp feral dps’ers are both getting the same result in the end - time wasted

This is my mantra as well, brother...
---
There's no educated guess at this time.
---
questie does it
---
Magic aoe groups, 3 mages/priest/warrior. Or melee cleave, enhance sham/warriors/rogues/priest.
---
I don't mind these new terms. If you're joining a spell/melee cleave group, there is an expectation on how the run should operate. 
---
On my server (Herod) some even call non-cleave groups "normal" groups haha.
---
I think desolace is too early for 30. I did barrens, stonetalon, ashenvale then 1k needles. Now i'm in hillsbrad foothills doing the green and yellow quests. After that i'm heading to STV or desolace. I'm lvl 34 right now.
---
The irony is that idiots like this will _never_ turn down a priest healer, despite being a requirement for spellcleave.
---
That's about a 3rd of the gold you need for your mount right there
---
Do you use the addon Prat? I heard it caused stutters, especially when loot was being rolled.
---
Thrash - gives the caster 2 extra attacks. Which should mean 3 attacks at once, not 5?
---
Drop both and pick up mining and engineering, do you have any secondary professions? If not pock up first aid so you can heal while your enemy is stunned. I'd also recommend getting riposte as you'll parry a lot of attacks and be able to disarm with that and better control the damage coming in.

I feel you man! I just find it interesting how some of the meta has shifted. I rerolled a mage after getting my rogue to 46 and being completely unable to find any group for ZF over and over again..it was super demoralizing
---
When I played original vanilla, I leveled a retri paladin and played as DPS in early/mid game instances, it worked fine back then. You won't top DPS meters, but it is mostly playable.
---
I can't find the post i saw some time ago. But damn, it would be cool to play a skelly.
---
"You pull it, you tank it"
---
Should be 3 attacks at once then, not 5, right?
---
They were all about the opener and stunlocks and resets before the enemy could dot you.

They honestly weren't very good outside of 1v1 where you get the jump.

Ah thanks for the response. I will just have to live with it for now. Someone who was multi boxing was camping me today, so maybe ill cool off.
---
Nah cleave was a passive ability in wc3 dealt damage to all units in an AoE around the unit being attacked and was exclusive to melee. Ranged had splash or multishot and spells were just spells and if they did AoE damage were called AoE

This is what I've noticed too just by playing against them. They do absolutely no burst damage, but they just run off a rehearsed sequence of CC abilities.
---
Because you are using the macro engine from legion on the vanilla client. Vanilla macros didn't have conditions like swimming or outdoors.
---
YOU CLICK YOUR SPELLS H4H4H4H4

The discussion was about if using mind-flay instead of wanding. I said "nah" and used its comparison to shitty smite to illustrate that point.
---
No one was advocating for actually using smite.
---
Thank you!!!

Corpse camping isnt exactly bannable
---
If you're worried about clearing bosses then you shouldn't be doing spellcleave. Although it can handle some bosses (literally all of SM), the point of spellcleave is xp and trash drops, not gear from bosses. 
---
That said, the best weapon for casters in the 40s is from a boss in ZF who is quite easy  for spellcleave.
---
Look, a vast majority of players understand that stats &gt; looks.  Im not even saying that stats are better than looks, that it is just a common understanding.
---
A vast majority of players understand that you don’t take something for someone who could use the item because it is an improvement in stats.
---
If someone does not I will help them understand that.

Imagine having such a huge ego that you can't just go "Oh yeah, that's what he said, my bad." Yikes.  You're exactly the same as the idiots you cry about.

---
To me, it's just not fun to bring classes that are so terrible. I don't care much about meta in retail or other mmos, but in vanilla the gap is so big.
---
It has never been about whether or not my groups are able to finish a dungeon or not, because for sure the bad specs can too.
---
To me, any team game that you play with randoms is about 'bringing it'. That can mean different things for different people, but for me it includes picking a class or spec that performs well. You don't sit around waiting for a summon when the whole group needs to run. You bring water as a Mana user. You enchant your gear. Just basic shit.
---
Why would we hamstring our own group by bringing along a bad class? Why would you even want to play a bad class (seeing as they are often not very uniquely designed in vanilla - they just don't function)?
---
It just feels a little rude, honestly. 4 people play classes that bring something to the table, so why would we bring someone who adds comparatively little?
---
Just wanted to add some thoughts as to why people may refuse the lesser specs a spot, even though you may very well easily finish whatever you're doing with one in the group.
---

I'm Alliance on Nethergarde and it's great. Have literally never had a queue to get online so that's good. Groups are easy to find but I play a healer so it's kinda skewed. I don't play the AH much so can't comment on the economy but I saw on a Taliesin and Evitel video recently that it's like 70/30 Alliance/Horde which I wasn't happy about. The more balanced ones are all pvp. 
---
I wish I rolled on a pvp though coz I'm probably not gonna be a big raider
---
He's right, though. Better to go through a pack in 15s and spend an extra 20% of the healer's mana than to kill the pack in 1 minute and have the healer be mana capped the whole time.
---
Using your resources offensively instead of defensively is what good players do.

Haha, it won't be for sale tho', it will be free.
---
Im glad i play on a smaller server, I really hope it doesn't die.
---
For what its worth, Old Blanchey isnt like that. You have some people of course, but most groups I've been with are ayong the game as intended.
---
I would probably sit on it until pvp and twinking is introduced. Looks like a bis for 39 caster twinks. Someone will pay hundreds of gold for it.
---
It's funny because they still look for a tank, at lesat on Herod. So i join these groups just to be the pull mule and then i taunt stragglers off the healer and bring them back to the aoe pack. IT's really good exp though from like 50-55 in BRD then 55-58 LBRS. After that point just do Strat runs (if you can get an invite) for the best exp.
---
Just find a warlock heavy group who values Shadow Weaving. It buffs their damage as well as yours.
---
he he...
---
I have never used a down ranked spell to heal. I healed plenty of raids from vanilla through wrath. I have healed as a shaman and paladin.
---
Now I am not saying it is not something that is helpful but learning how much damage people will take, how much you need to heal them, when you need to heal them, and how much your heal will do are just as important.
---
In raids have a plan with other healers so you aren't overhearing too much.
---
My kids hands are definitely slow and it's sad watching him struggle because you can see that he is trying to do everything right but h like yours his hands are too small and the dexterity just isnt quite there yet. He does great on console but I'm either going to need to get him a smaller keyboard/mouse or figure out some key remapping for him.
---
It's one of the lower population servers, so people don't want to go
---
You have access to the same information I do, why do you need to read my mind? It's not like healing is very complicated, you should be able to tell if the healer has enough mana for the pull. If he has, then just go. 
---
What really pisses me off is when I stand around with 40% mana waiting for the tank to pull, then when I start droning the tanks runs out of range and line of sight and starts fighting a pack. You can't leave the healer out of range and out of mana. If I'm in range of you while drinking I can cast a heal as soon as you start to drop, if you're also out of range then that's 3-5 seconds of extra delay for my to first run in line of sight and then do a 3 second heal. If I'm in the other room drinking with no mana, don't go. If you have 40% health and I have no mana, don't go. In most other situations just go ahead pull the next pack.
---
If you need it, need it.
---
It's his choice. OP got butthurt from rejection and called the guy a nutcase. Who is salty?

There is a cool down period after 2 or 3 shift clicks
---
It hasn’t been conclusively answered yet you dipshit.
---
Stop being so fucking smug.
---
As a tank I usually go pretty ham for 2 or 3 pulls and then see how the priest handles low Mana. If they keep standing up right away when I pull, I start to give them a bit more time to drink. Sometimes I'll pop frenzied regeneration so they know I'm good for 10/15 seconds while they drink. My advice to tanks would be to feel out your healers play style I'm the beginning.
---
Combat swords is boring and only really optimal on human rogues.
---

---
On Herod too. Mostly spellcleaves have been a mixed bag for me, and even one mediocre mage ruins the whole thing. But when you get a full group that know the pulls? It's pretty goddam amazing.
---
The most fun I had in vanilla was as a Rogue.  Dueling can be rough because they're very cooldown dependent, but there's plenty of tools to escape.  Wait for phase 2 when you get the pvp trinket and things will be better.
---
Sapping people off the boat and distracting mounted people off cliffs is tons of fun though.
---
What kind of anime is this?
---
So if I log in and happen to be in a good layer, that's not exploiting, but if I log in to a bad layer and simply swap to a different one which I could have wound up on anyway if I was luckier, that's an exploit?
---
Maybe Classic shouldn't have had layers like I said from day 1. Blame Blizzard if it bothers you so much, not me.
---
Whats the name of that font pls
---
It's been almost a month. It's been weeks since only no-lifers and rushers were 60.
---
any warlock worth a shit knows to do this. renews or a r1 in between pulls is good enough to keep me going with melee.
---
I just finished a full clear of that place. It’s now 0646 in the morning and iv done an all nighter. 
---
We were in there for what seems like an eternity. It was fun tho, can see why it is said to be the best mmo dungeon ever created.
---
Don’t you have a guild masters veiny cock to stroke?
---
[This sums it up nicely](https://youtu.be/yQTl6lxQhoo)
---
Pretty much. I've never lost against a rogue 1v1 if it's an even and full health fight.
---
Otherwise they usually wait to jump on me when I'm low on health and I watch for the shadow reflector as I'm coming out of stun. If I can survive the initial opener and a few seconds after until the reflector fades, they usually vanish right before and I don't see them again. If they go for round 2 then it's usually 50/50 since I'm already one foot in the grave at that point. If I get a resist or can't create distance I'm hosed.
---
They are excellent at peeling, openers and pausing a fight. I never played one through end game but from what I've played through MC you've got to be on top of your game in PvP, geared to the teeth and never press a wrong button.
---
Combat daggers bruh, i do more dps than swords in dungeons bruuh
---
He went to a wow movie with wow fans trying to trigger them, what is so hard to understand lol. It's not the right thing to do of course but what the fuck do you think is gonna happen.
---
If you read the books laying around in Scarlet Monstary they reference Northrend and the Blood elf cities etc that are part of the scourge lore. They always knew they were there but they were either insignificant or inaccessible at the time of classic. Even while we are in TBC, Northrend is there chilling \*punny\* but Arthas isnt starting shit yet. Once he starts some shit the two factions gear up some ships as icebreakers and make an expedition.
---
I don’t think you did anything wrong just remember the guild and see how the rest of their members act. If they are all toxic let your guild and friends know to be wary of that guild eventually their reputation will be known across your server if they continue with their behavior
---
If all goes well, I should have my mount by 50 though.

Context is key my friend. Exploiting using the top of the Gadgetzan arena to avoid guards is against the ToS and is therefore bannable.

this makes 0 sense

The most low effort post.
---
Ngl I hate the Tauren starting zone ai many wolves that just take a chunk out of you if they aggro on.
---
That and the amount of go kill these mobs for this material feels significantly higher than other areas.
---
I could be wrong, but isn't WoW Classic the same as the 2004 version unless you choose an option in-game for all the modern effects?
---
If so, any modern PC will do the job. The AMD A6-9225 with which this PC is equipped is from Q2 2018 so you're more than fine. And a quick search on YT shows it runs even Fortnite.
---
I sincerely thought that MoP was because of the large fan base there. Am surprised there isn't more "eastern" influence in the game. Wait...what does a subscription cost there? lol
---
What are you referring to?

Banned for World PVP?

The horde sure doesn't like actually being ganked in World PVP.

Don’t like PVP don’t roll a PVP server

Horde filth.
---
1) He only told people to report people who were cheating.
---
2) He didn't say anything about trying to get people to quit the game. He said he wanted them to reroll alliance.
---
3) PvP server on a game badly designed for world PvP. This is inevitable.
---
roll a shadow priest :P
---
shut the fuck up retard
---
They gave you a laundry list of reasons to leave, why would you feel bad about bailing?
---
Tnx man
---
Yeah, you definitely need to life tap with aggro sometimes.... but it's a delicate game. Will this fear allow me to LT, drain until I'm not a liability, then get dots out/feldom a VW to help manage the pack/kill a mob? Managing the balance between your blue and green mana bars is part of the class. 
---
That said, you *really* shouldn't be having to make these kinds of choices much in group content. If you have aggro and tank is alive, don't tap. You can survive with an empty blue bar, but an empty green one is a loooooong run.
---
this is the only correct answer.
---
ask yourself how many times you wiped before rend because some dumbass playing a pet class didn't dismiss his pet before making the jump.
---
then realize 99% of the pugs you play with will be about as good as the guy described above.

go on a pve server. OLYMPUS RUNS FAERLINA.
---
You can do it with auction items too. Stuff you put up for sale that doesn’t sell. Don’t need an alt, you just only have 1 item per mail. Sometimes cheaper.
---
Go back to your Soy Latte and jump on a pve server.
---
some people in this subreddit dude
---
HOES MAD
---
Oh my god you crybabies are the WORST!  You are lame dude.
---
It's up to you. Personally I would stay dps spec up to 60. The choice is basically do you want to make your tanking 20% better at the cost of making your solo'ing 40% worse.   
---
Some people go prot for dungeon spam 56-60 which is ok, but honestly for strat/scholo/lbrs most people would much rather a lvl 60 arms warrior in greens tanking than a lvl 56 dedicated prot tank. The levels make a big difference.
---
That's surprisingly hardline. I would have loved to see them take that approach with multiboxers, never fun getting quad dotted instantly by a lock  (with a priest healer) on a PvP realm.
---
Yeah makes me think these are actually pro asmomd posts disguised as anti asmond lol. Very troll like. Like his fan claim he is
---
That’s usually what I do. Really no reason to say anything, you can also fit a few mind flays to get your spirit tap proc easier since it’s mana cost is pretty low considering DOTs at that level.
---
KEKW
---
yup tank and heals were 57 on the live run. It was v rough
---
Yeah, it seems like all three realms are heavily Alliance populated, with Nethergarde Keep having the biggest imbalance. But since I'm not into PvP at all, faction balance won't really affect me anyways.
---
Everything else sounds pretty good :)
---
Thanks for the info! &lt;3
---
Everyone telling you everything being figured out is the reason is only telling half the truth. Classic runs on the 1.12 patch which has all content severely nerfed for people to finish things up before TBC release.
---
i wouldn't attempt this with this sub. most white gamers are woefully uneducated about race.
---
Listen, these runs where everyone is low health after every pull were not the norm 12 years ago. The extra pace we've put on dungeon runs has definitely sped up the average leveling speed, but it also requires some thought from dps. Show your tanks Target somewhere on your UI and try to stay on it. Don't aoe before the tank has a second or two to generate some threat and if you get aggro tab to a different Target until the tank pulls off you. It's not that tough but when the dps knows what they are doing, runs are much smoother.
---
Is there any addon that displays enemy health bars above the mob and shows threat as well? For some reason the addons I’ve been using hasn’t worked.
---
i get mad too when i see horde players ganking my faction but i dont go on forums crying to blizz to ban the ganking raid lol
---
I guess I am not too familiar with the development of WoW as a game over the years. I really only started playing during MoP, but I really am enjoying Classic. I do see what you mean when you ask "where has the RPG gone?".
---
Lol @ quoting a comment from thottbot not any sort of official patch notes / blue post
---
Let's see:  
---
First clip he's obviously joking.
---
Second clip, staying on the roofs out of range of the guards is actually forbidden.
---
Nothing you linked is in any way reportable or bannable. Stop being such a special snowflake.
---
Yes totally agree, hes just a whine bitch fuck asmon
---
It’s a way for completely shit players to think they are good by using a stupid term that doesn’t even apply to what they are doing
---
It’s fucking AOE. You aren’t cleaving anything 
---
Anytime I see someone use the term “spell cleave” I instantly assume they are a terrible player
---
&gt; and telling them to report people trying to escape
---
You're a liar.
---
&gt; Let me add i am from the EU i am not on his server and it is not effecting me
---
Maybe you should stay on your PVE server.
---
You guys remember Atlas? a fail game from last year (december 2018), that shitty game was VERY POPULAR in China, they love pvp and stuff like that, idk why tbh.
---
Welcome to Classic. It can happen with guilds too :P
---
I mean every other race already does this for Dwarves you'll see more humans and night elves than the races that spawn into them in Dwarf and Gnome.
---
While its nice to have diversity I cant help but feel a little sad when the great Dwarf starting zone is a bunch of female humans and Night elves running around.
---
Shit like this is why I love MMOs lol
---
Link please? Having trouble finding a video of soda running around with close to 1000 other people camping an entire factions leveling zone.

But if you remove that you lose 40% of wow

Its like they don't play there own game.

You know there are PVE servers right? This has to be a troll right? no way you are this dumb

I get the same thing in booty bay where the mount lights up but can't mount.  It may be bugged there.
---
if it doesn't effect you, why do you care to post this shit
---
It’s a made up name so it probably can’t be translated. Most other realm names (like Whitemane, Bloodhoof, whatever) could be translated pretty easily
---
I had to actually google what that was. When the hell did that become a term for aoe?
---
&gt; isn't WoW Classic the same as the 2004 version
---
No, it's a recreation based on the modern client. Requirements are less than BFA because the graphics is more simple but they are more than original vanilla, even at low settings.
---
The other day I tried with my mage and blink after the jump and end up on the bottom. Teams didn’t even know I wasn’t with them and got wiped.

Sorry that you gave a vague answer then moved the goalpost after the fact. Calm down buddy.

Ah gotcha. My bad.

And of course a warrior complaining about "Useless" hunter getting all the loot, almost made me stop eating to reply to him!

Unless you want to be in a guild that's serious about clearing content you can definitely find a guild that will bring you as enhancement, especially a few months from now when everything is on farm.  Maybe not their A Team but people will be trying to gear their alts and offspecs.  Just find a more casual group.
---
Respecing like that is going to be very expensive.  Prot warriors feel your pain.
---
Shadow spec is fine for off healing up to 60. Holy isn't terrible as a levelling spec though either, although it will be a lot slower solo compared to shadow. There's no "right" way to do it.
---
I'm a Paladin tank, and some mage kept pulling for me. while I'm oom. telling me to pull more even though the Troggs in Uldaman enrage and I barely lived the 4 pull
---
Create your own run? 
---
Join a guild with your specific play style in mind?
---
That's BRM, BRD is inside.
---
The actual answer is that blizzard does not consider any of this worthy of banning someone.  It's not any more complicated than that.
---
From my perspective, Classic World of Warcraft does not immediately illustrate thoughts of a difficult PVE environment. It has been stated dozens of times; bosses usually have zero abilities beyond hitting the tank with a DE-buff. Player versus environment content is governed by statistical changes from equipment. The difference between a good mage and a bad one is just the quality of gear they have acquired, that is it. Moreover, the amount of PVE content is incredibly low. After you have gotten pre-raid gear, there is nothing further to do but raid Molten Core once a week. As Classic WoW progresses further into the planned phases, more options are available. 
---
Ahn,Qiraj and Naxxramas will still be roadblocks for most guilds. However, to clarify it will not be because of difficult coordination or strategies. If you did not know, the 25-man version of Naxxramas in Wrath of Lich King is almost untouched in terms of stats when compared to the level 60 version. This was done in an effort to make raiding content more accessible but also because the level 60 version had such high stat requirements that even with 20 levels, it was still averagely challenging ( regarding average players). Therefore, it will be difficult because everyone in any given raid will need to be maximized in terms of gear and flasks. Which, take multiple hours of farming for flasks per week as well as months of farming Tier 2 content. Classic World of Warcraft is not difficult, just time consuming. 
---
Now, for us older folks, there is a reason that The Burning Crusade is mentioned so frequently. Burning Crusade was the pinnacle of PVE raid content, if you are craving difficult PVE content, I would suggest The Burning Crusade. BC launched with Karazhan, Magtheridons Lair, Gruuls Lair, Serpentine Cavern, Tempest Keep, 15 dungeons with heroic modes and two world bosses. Instead of retail WoW and in fact Classic too, you transition from one raid to the next but within the same period. Instead of plugging away at the same raid until the next patch, there is always further content to look forward too. Furthermore, this was before item levels, stat allocation on items was correlated with the difficulty of the encounter not the tier level. Guilds progressing in Tier 6 content would still take time each week for Tier 5 raids (which is why you can tackle any boss in those instances in any order). A high-end raiding guild in Burning Crusade would have 3-5 raid nights a week. In addition, encounters were not simple hack and slashes, some of the most difficult raid bosses in the history of WoW are found in Burning Crusade. In fact, the top 10 longest living bosses are mostly made up of Burning Crusade encounters.
---
 For example, Leotheras the Blind, is a tier 5 boss for a 25-man raid and illustrates raid content for the expansion. First, three mobs have to be engaged to start the encounter, they can Mind-control tanks and need to be separated so they do not heal. As soon as the last one dies, Leothras emerges, hunter MD pull and the fight begins. Around 20 seconds after this, he drops all threat and starts whirlwinding the raid at random and leaves a damage debuff that will kill you if not healed.  This goes on for around 15 seconds, at which point another aggro drop occurs. Bosses in Burning Crusade are not tauntable, the tank will have to manual follow him around and bash him as soon as he is available. Dps must stop all damage 5 seconds before the phase ends, healers must stop healing at the same time. One frost bolt, one arrow and threat is lost, which is a wipe. He smacks the main tank like before and starts his WW session. This time, he transforms into a demon, starts casting a fireball that does a huge stacking fire damage debuff, which hits everyone within a 35-yard range. You then have your chosen Warlock with fire-resist gear tank him, everyone gives the party member enough time for threat and begins attacking. The Warlock has to be situated so he is away from the party and although not required, a paladin should be within a 40-yard range with Fire resistance Aura. Warlocks have no taunts obviously; every party member has to be extremely diligent at checking Omen, if one person pulls threat, he fireballs the entire raid dead. Ontop of this, 5 members are inflicted with Inner demons during this phase, which have Elite level 72 health and will three shot a healer. If demons are not killed with 30 seconds, the party member is Mind-controlled, even if they are battle rezzed. Only the person who has inner demons can target their demon, no one else can assist them. You can have five healers all inflicted at once, which will probably result in a wipe. The rest of the fight continues until 15% when he splits and both phases must be done at the same time. 
---
I brought this fight up because there is no margin of error for a fight like this. Either you can perform the mechanics correctly or you cannot, everything must be done perfectly or it is a wipe. This is also not a singular occurrence, even for Serpentine Cavern he is middle of the pack in terms of difficulty. It is worth mentioning that those awesome guilds from the private server community? On Netherwing, the most popular Burning Crusade server, it took 4 ½ months for the best guild to kill Lady Vashj and another two weeks for Kael'thas. 
---
A few of my colleagues were talking about this recently so it is still fresh on my mind, but the consensus on Reddit is screaming for difficult raid content. If that is so, Classic WoW is an appetizer, be excited for The Burning Crusade.
---
this hasnt been my experience at all
---
Especially when she's a cute elfette..
---
Its not even world pvp its harassment :S thier is  big massive difference you can hear it in his voice when he saw this thread.
---
It sells for less than the vendor cost of if you turned them into bandages. I don't think the price will ever drop. But I also don't think it's going to go up anytime soon, and not to a degree that will make taking up all that space is worthwhile.

Yep it's called Spy. It tells you all the people in your area and your K/D with them. You can also mark them as KOS
---
Manamana?
---
Who cares tbh. If that person is that much of a crybaby then you don’t want to play with them. Ignore list is a huge part of the game imho now that people can’t server hop so utilize it accordingly and I’d say he would immediately go on my ignore for being a little bitch.
---
That's because you share some loot with warriors, so we'd rather invite casters
---
wow that's allot more expensive than I thought.
---
Hahaha nice.
---
Keep em coming, have loved these
---
I swear I’ve seen this guy what server was this?
---
That's not an accurate interpretation of cleave.  Age old definitions don't change because of meme comps for dungeon farming.  
---
I understand wanting a unique identifier to easily get across a concept and find like minded individuals, but it's really just a catchy/edgy name that when taken at face value is just jibberish.
---
&gt;need to be 40* for ice barrier*. 
---
you dont get skills at 41 (only even numbers) and ice armor is a mage's armor/slow on hit buff. ice barrier prevents damage.
---
Yeah used to have an s14 sr20 swapped e.t.c, but sold it a few years ago, picked up an 11 wrx hatch last summer and started doing some track days again this year.

Yes bears are fantastic! Mine is 42 rn. I’m speaking feral dps.
---
In my opinion it would be way too more demotivating to see the quest go "Hey man, please kill 300 people and bring me their skulls". With all these grindy quests with low amount of items needed but stupidly low dropchances on them you'll be getting through the quest at the same pace, but every one piece of quest item will motivate you way more than what you suggested.

It's fine to be new. Just ask what to do in groups. Most people are friendly and want you to do well and have fun.
---
yeah i think ditching a 5 person group that could work because of one bad cog is a bad attitude but do you bud
---
Luckily I mostly heal for my friends but my issue with tanks has been they just don't read fucking chat. I'll call OOM and even /oom and they keep pulling.
---
So you're a pve player mainly.
---
For PvP humans are probably the worst race.
---
Night elf as we discussed.
---
Dwarf has some resistances.
---
Gnome has root break.
---
Humans have nothing as that +5 weapon bonus doesn't mean much in PvP.
---
boomers have a hard time with change
---
If you have trouble with aggro, wait 1-2 secs before unleashing your dps. Usually the tank has enough of a lead with the pull + those few seconds.
---
Yet had to comment.
---
Physical crits don't deal damage if they have ice armor up.
---
It's a term for dungeon groups consisting of 3-4 mages, 0-1 warlocks, and 1 healer, preferably priest.
---
It really makes me wish Allied races were implemented differently and Dark Iron was Horde.
---
They feel like one of the races that would make sense to swap sides.
---
I went looking for something like that after seeing this screenshot, but can’t seem to find anything that does this. Would definitely be interested if anyone knows what it is
---
&gt; You are not supposed to heal unavoidable damage
---
*Avoidable, it's avoidable damage. You don't need to stand there and eat it.
---
Where u be
---
This or Menethil FP.
---
Agreed
---
it's not bugged. all of booty bay counts as "indoors". same as if you walk over the floor of a building with no walls or roof.
---
I personally don't think Rogues were fun until TBC.  Shadowstep was the reason I enjoyed my Rogue.  Won't play one without it.
---
But, obviously this is very subjective.
---
People refuse to group with prot paladin main tanks, are they also pretty darn salty? Of course not. Use your reason.
---
Well, do you have a better term that could be used to describe a particular group make-up?
---
This should be deleted as it's an embarrassment to you both. I'll go ahead and screengrab for later memes tho, th x.
---
I always felt crafting professions benefit the player using them through gear and having long term projects to work for or plans to grind for more than being useful money makers.  Obviously there are some exceptions, like bags will most likely always sell, as well as devilsaur sets.  Blacksmithing was fun for me because I don’t like spending the gold on crafted items if I can make them, but apart from that I relied on arcane crystals or arcanite transmute from an alt to make money.
---
Awesome yet again
---
Oh cool, another passive aggressive "Dear damage dealers" whiny open letter that none of the people who need to read are going to read, we definitely don't have enough of those already.
---
NeatPlates shows aggro and spell name/cast time bars on the nameplates.
---
booty bay is considered "indoors". this is how it worked back in vanilla and on pservers.
---
The fog that appears during rainstorms is also quite something.
---
Questie will mark quest locations.   
---
VendorPrice will let you see vendor value of items, so you can pick the most valuable quest rewards or trash your least valuable item when your bags are full to make room for a more valuable item.  
---
Atlas will put coordinates on your map, mark cities and flight paths,  and AtlasLoot will show you what items drop in dungeons so you can see if there are any rewards there you'd like.
---
 Bro you don’t owe anyone shit they sounded like dicks fuck them
---
this is very good news for classic and anyone who hopes for tbc at some point
---
blizzard is more interested in the asian market than the western market and will happily put resources into anything that gives them a hold on that region 
---
very very good news for classic
---
You must tame brokentooth and throw this cat away. Nobody has to know. They look the same.
---
I'm impressed by your ability to see things in pixel soup
---
If the Alliance had any sense they would have deposed their leaders ages ago.
---
I recognized Farseer lol.
---
They were hidden in the fog of war
---

---
A lot of people were claiming Classic was going to be DOA in china.
---
Me, a professional asshole would have attacked you.
---
the Broken Isles and Kul Tiras are both hugely out of scale compared to the rest of the world map, and Kul Tiras actually wasn't even there in vanilla. It was just west of Gilneas. The Cataclysm flung it out to sea
---
Wow oh obviously don’t understand how to play the game... I was going to explain why, but someone with your absolute bullshit attitude won’t listen. Keep doing what your doing bro, great player
---
Fuck you, that is a shaman wpn!
---
&gt; I'm not the one arguing to change the game to cater to me.
---
No? I must have misread this, then.
---
"[Cool, so I guess we'll all just fight only people of the same level?](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d72dlg/using_terrain_or_buildings_to_avoid_guards_in/f0zfcyx/) And no low level will walk into my AOE to grief me with a DHK? And all of that totally won't discourage me from participating in WPvP at all? If you give players the ability to penalize other players (baiting them into killing a low level for a DHK) they will. It will be miserable too."
---
Yes, actually
---
Man I have one group of people I can play with and I'm the same way they're all level 45+ now and I'm like "I've got like 4 level 13 characters"  I'm so far behind because I couldnt settle on a class or play as much.
---
Spell cleave has different variations and can absolutely use a tank.
---
This is a fucking memsterpiece. Holy shit
---
Damn. The Chinese even beat Kevin Jordan to casting Blizzard.
---
Many horde zones hurt my damned eyes.  Like staring into a red light for 2 hours.  Durotar and barrens are pretty awesome for questing but are absolute shit for staring at for too long.  
---
Feels like snow blindness.

I honestly wonder this. He should give out the guild names he bought the ingots thru, if he bought  more than 1 or 2 ingots (honestly 2 is even pushing the limits for me) thru the same guild ima call bullshit.
---
It bothers me that you have one stack of 6
---
Don’t ask questions if you don’t want the answer then.
---
Damn, now I am even happier. I left my lvl 47 Mage to get rest for few days and made this bloke! Got all these items in 1 run. 
---
Too bad I will never ever get anything again though ._.
---
Relatable, my class is my identity.
---
So many PvP servers.
---
Star Trek costume to Star Wars premiere..
---
Oh ok, I took the free transfer to one of the newer servers so it’s at least a week behind the rest. I’m almost able to start crafting them so I guess I’ll just stockpile some sets for now

how the hell did he have 20k gold? US streamers don't even have 1k usually

What server are you on? We run a small ish guild on smolderweb called Jamaican bobsled fed, we’re always looking for new active members.
---
"I prefer a freestyle rotation" was the joke back in FFXIV
---
RFC is an instance you should tank or heal instead of DPS. You don't have Frost shock yet, and some mobs are immune to fire, so you'll want to use rockbiter and earthshock for those anyway.
---
From there up until RFK, you are equally good in all roles, but spec makes a very small difference.
---
If you start your own raid no one can deny you a spot. Having Nightfall is certainly going to help your case if you are looking to join someone else’s raid. 
---
My guildie has just rerolled Rogue from Feral Druid due to the same fears you have about finding a raid slot.
---
You wont have to wait that long to raid, I meant when you can just ride along through a raid that they already have on farm.  There's plenty of guilds clearing now/leveling up that are more casual and won't care what spec you are.  They'll just be trying to fill raid spots.
---
Just let them know you want to raid as enhancement so they don't try to push you into healing.
---
I quickly ignore those guys. Had a dude that spent 15 mins straight talking about how much he loves banging his wife, but in the way a 12 yr old would describe it. Almost as if he was winging it. 45 mins later someone in group asked if he would plz stfu so I guess he was still going lol.
---
24 is statistically the likely amount of runs it'll take. Of course they could get insanely lucky and get them in 8, but it's also possible for it to take 80.
---
I love this idea, but any research into whether you would be risking a "cease &amp; desist" from Blizzard?
---
Gaming doesnt increase violence in ppl.
---
It was always there. :D
---
I found it humorous. I snort laughed.
---
This is the best one yet.
---
Does thunder bluff have an artisan blacksmith? I have to go to org if not, that’s what the expert says at least
---
My experience has been:
---
Tauren and Troll - Chill AF. If factions could trade, they would be the ones who hands you free potions.
---
Undead - Uneasy, but sometimes friendly (Unless it's a Rogue)
---
Orc - Sniffed too much Fel energy and tries to screw with me at every waking moment (ESPECIALLY if he/she is a non-caster class)
---
Though, at least with Horde you know what their intentions are by merely a glance. The Horde themselves must have a hell of a difficult time telling Alliance apart, where only the Dwarf women are the nice ones.
---
I’ve been seeing an uncomfortable amount of China and Brazil on atiesh
---
Haven't decided on a server yet. It'll be easy coast us.
---
You will never get out :P
---
im sure you had some really enlightening stuff to say, im gonna cry myself to sleep tonight having missed it.
---
I don't understand why you're so bent out of shape. If you don't like it, switch servers. Go back to playing Archage. I get it it may be frustrating but then why play on a PvP server? 
---
 All these posts do is give him more attention. Which is fine by me I like watching his streams. He's fun to watch specially when he is doing all of the things you mentioned. 
---
He's also very good at staying within the bounds of ToS. He will not be banned until he actually fucks up with the ToS. Everything you mentioned is not against the ToS. 
---
He actually just talked about your post on stream.  I recommend you look it up. He doesn't care, and in fact loves that you're triggered enough to make a post about him. Good job man. Hurting your own cause.
---
You seem like the salty one running to reddit to cry about it tbh..
---
Back in actual classic the vast majority of grps were pretty balanced.. class wise as all brought something 
---
Try get into a grp as anything other then a warlock or mage as a dps then get back to us
---
Im honestly amazed that you managed to even make it above lvl 5 as a clicker
---
Lol, no.
---
I did that because I had no idea about the differences between parry vs dodge until you just told me (lol). Thank you! I will fix that today.
---
Will also fix the lockpicking mistake.
---
Let me know if you know your way around GitHub/Vue.js I can just give you access to the repo (it deploys automatically via Netlify). Otherwise I will fix that stuff today or tomorrow. Thank you!
---
And yes, the 308 soft-cap changes a whole lot. It changed what we consider Dagger BiS (OH BiS changed to the AQ40 one).
---
Imagine if he were a DOTA fan instead... Would he get beat up more or less?

I never knew dedmines could be this intense
---
This quest means alot to me. While doing it as a 10 year old kid in 2005 i meg a orc hunter. We decided to team up and do it together. We got along quite nice and spent the evening questing. We even jumped on skype and found out that we were the same age. 15 years later, And were still playing together. 
---
Thanks man! Keep theese up. They bring a tear to my eye
---
Except I’m already 60 and cleared all of them.
---
I was having a weird bug where when I group with a friend I get no exp, loot, or quest mobs counting. Had to leave and get reinvited and it started giving me my exp and whatnot.
---
Thanks pal, I’ll stick it out as fury for the time being then.
---
And costs infinitely more gold.
---
Chinese are very into grinding and how the play the game in general. It’s why most of the popular eastern mmos are giant grind fests.
---
AOE.

It's literally in the vanilla World of Warcraft install manual under "popular terms". It's nothing new.

Don't listen to him. Your kitty loves you.
---
Look buddy, I was raised on GTA and other violent video games - and i’ve only killed 2 hookers IRL.
---
Video Games don’t cause violence.
---
I enjoy playing my alliance lock, just like I did in classic, but I know many people decided to do something different. I wouldn’t worry about being different just for the sake of being different. Play what you’re interested in.
---
No need to defend, im just clarifying. But yes, most of the time this is true.
---
OF course there's an idiot here missing the point
---
yes if you want to
---
Hurr durr millenialz bad - you do realize millennials are in their 30s right? Approaching their 40s like you don't even know who you're trying to make fun of
---
Also i will definitely do a PVP server. But should i pick a medium or high pop server?
---
They don't, the timer works fine. Make room and have your tank kite backwards. You can also have dps focus the mines when they go down.
---
Eadiest solution (that requires less coordination imo) is to simply CC some of the dwarfs. You can make use of sap, polymorph (maybe other things as well?). Then, mark 1 dwarf with a skull so people focus target.
---
Like legitimately? or that is your observation? I am wondering if those might be tiny people but if not GAAAT DAMN!
---
Yes, ret does fine damage. Their view point is ignorance.
---
Yea, I play on Herod and they’re extremely expensive since the market is cornered

Titan panel is a great qol addon, adds a bar to the top with useful information

I'm horde and that rogue deserved that

Zoomers use it in exactly the same way that the baby boomers' parents used it in the 40s. It's synonymous with influence. They're not changing anything.

---
I'm a priest levelling with a rogue buddy and he isn't happy I want to keep doing Armoury. Nothing good for either of us in there BUT I want that damn tabard. I told him on our first run that I want the Scarlet Crusade tabard. 
---
Did it drop on the first run? Well yeah, it sure did. It was my friends loot though. BoP and he has auto loot on. I'll get it some day. 
---
Anyway to answer your question, armoury is only good for the tabard.

Here's a guide that includes threat tables showing how much flat threat (aside from damage) each rank of abilities adds.
---

Considering to role in NA being from EU (Portugal), how will the lag be? What would be my experience in PvP and PvE like?
---
Lok'tar ogar, friend.
---
Didn’t China also get word first hand of rag? I think eu tried to claim it but IIrc it was China who got it a few days back. Shows how few people know how profound the game is over there.
---
Undead got the most well balanced quests IMO. Not too much running in one direction, and the story is full of interesting shades of grey. Sometimes you're doing bad stuff, sometimes helping others in need, sometimes even turning bad guys to work for a good(er) cause. Plus the starting area has really nice aesthetics. Barrens made me quit playing as Tauren because my god that place is SO DULL.
---
Yes, but these are basics. All those things should be second nature by now, we had these mechanics for 15 years. I know not everyone has played that long, but many of us have, its very much expected that you know about those things these days.
---
Yeah but I won't have to go back to him in SW to hand it in just to go back to the temple again right? I hope that's just a bug on my addon
---
If you’re a mage, yes
---
Jesus haha. That’s top quality.
---
The only one salty here is you.
---
Only a dumbass would choose to play on a server where all streamers announced that its their server...
---
I think there is one, I've seen it in retail over the years, but don't remember the name. I never used it because it spams the chat with X interrupted Y and gets a little old. While there may or may not be one strictly for Classic, I imagine it works all the same if you can find it.
---
I don’t mind this if there’s a mage that kindly provided some water for me. I could be positioned fine and still have to cancel 15s worth of drinking. Morning glory dew ain’t cheap.
---
I have received am education and have you to thank. *hat tip*
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/gigaautoresourcestracker
---
Same, new mage here. New wow player also. Had other mages who blizzard before the tank even has stuff grouped or lined up, and at worst they took frostbite. Frostbite is fine but not if you are spacing the enemies by 50 yards each because you cant wait. All they seem to care about is dps numbers. No one cares if you are shitting numbers and triple the downtime due to chaotic fights. I can see why mages get a bad rap these days.
---
Actually I find playing with a ret in dungeons to be very safe. Sure you may be not top dps but the utility makes them very much worth it. Unlike raids more often than not you will be in a casual dungeon group and things might get messy.
---
Healer went oom. Got you covered.
---
That dps pulling aggro on trash. Blessing of Salvation / protection.
---
Tank pulled a little more than he should. Let me off tank a couple of trash.
---
Not only can shaman tank well, they can deal aggro MUCH better than a warrior. If you pull off a warrior they struggle to get it back because they need to be hit to generate sufficent rage. As a shaman this is never an issue.
---
"Hey coworkers wanna come watch me play wow? Just stay back i need to perfectly record my screen with my phone while showing yall."
---
He's making up a story for karma is what he's doing. Not very well though.
---
How do they explain the generations and rich history of say - Pandaria? 
---
4 years could potentially make sense, until you realise there are “ancient” structures and multiple generations of Pandaren in Pandaria.
---
The mechanics are still simple and the 1.12 numbers make things even easier, but coordinating 5-40 people into not acting like total schmucks is still one of the greatest challenges in video games, even 15 years later.
---
Just FYI OP is being sarcastic.... Zul Gurub isn't even out yet....
---
Ah ok I thought for a minute it would be for sale.
---
Did you have to do anything in particular to install it properly? I have added it to my addon folder but it's not showing up in my interface.
---
Lol that's a perfect expression
---
Let me guess, Final Boss? These guys are fucking ruining my server.
---
Thanks for the response, I'm going to Google some fundamental add ons like this one. I don't use any right now and that feels like a mistake. Feel free to make some suggestions if it's convenient (I play Druid if that's relevant)

---
Shadow priest here. Entirely jealous.
---
Can we please not mention RL right now...
---
I loved my rogue in Vanilla. I didnt care for it so much in BC, and I re rolled warlock.
---
It's not a layering joke and a layering joke here wouldn't be that funny now that you've ruined it
---
"tried"
---
They pretty much *succeeded*. 
---
Some of those ticking time bombs just haven't blown up yet.
---
I'm looking forward to new, actually high skill, streamers. Not that the popular ones out there aren't good at the game, but they are not popular for being good at classic. We need new players to rise to the top and get noticed for their skills,
---
Thrash Blade and Resurgence Rod both are guaranteed quest rewards, and both are good enough to carry you to 60
---
Pvpers mostly use goblin sapper charge and iron grenade. Iron grenade is dirt cheap and provides the incapitation affect and you can use it while moving. Sometimes thorium grenade is used too if they want to flex big money since it does more damage.
---
Lastly for PVE dense dynamite is also used as a dps increase between your rotation
---
"Maybe he's overgeared?" 
---
Yes, this is the answer, he has literally had tens of thousands of gold shoveled at him in the last month by followers enabling him to by every BoE upgrade on the server and has been able to master loot every item he wanted.
---
Mage is one of my characters and it works half the time. Sometimes I am at max distance and it obviously doesn't pop up, but the options are either use it and it works half the time when you are in range, or don't use it and it doesn't ever work, obviously. 
---
It's still worth it, but no, it's not something a mage or lock can rely on all the time, you still need to learn to manage your threat. That being said, Mage and Warlock do the same damage at 10 feet as they do at 30, so you don't have to be at max distance.
---
I glanced at your title and saw "My guild role plays as Alliance" I though ye were a Horde guild role playing Alliance
---
What a wonderful reason to buy my Strong Anti-Venoms off the AH
---
DOA?
---
Just buy the vials needed for whatever you're crafting at the time. Dont need to think too much into it!
---
classic wowhead is full of miss information lol
---
There what is? You made a baseless accusation that he denied. You have no proof, and he has no proof, so who knows or cares? He farmed a bunch of mats and explained his method. It's a cool accomplishment. Why do you feel the need to try and shit on that?
---
Yea, you have to change the file name when it’s in your addons folder to just “unitscan”
---
Also you can only scan manually, and you need to type /unitscan (name of unit)
---
Sure, that's an accurate term to describe the damage being done. 
---
So being the smart guy you are, you could deduce that a group is looking for mainly mages/locks if they were building a spell cleave group. At the same time, if someone was building a "magic aoe group", you'd come to a similar conclusion.  What's the problem? Who cares if people are using a different term for the comp (besides some of the triggered people in this thread).
---
\*Laughs in paladin Tank\*
---
Debatable cause most lvl 30 warriors need help to get it done. So did they earn the passage if someone helped them a lot/did it for them. 
---
 I did between 34-37 and thats the range you solo it assuming you get the mats yourself. That lvl range is where you should be getting it. Anyone at 30 with a WW is not a true warrior in my eyes.
---
confirmation bias op
---
China namba wan
---
Naughty dps get the salv
---
I’m honestly not really in to the whole streaming culture thing. I want badass world PvP videos like I used to watch on warcraftmovies every Tuesday waiting for the servers to come back up.
---
I do. It still interrupts my mana regen and uses my Shock cooldown. I don't have a problem interrupting, I have the tools, it just bothers me that most other people don't even try, especially when their tools are better.
---
Pretty lame how no life these people are taking this game. I wonder if more studies will be done like they were back in 04-06
---
Did they also roll back his gains made by said layerhopping? Bans and rollback are necessary for the greater good.
---
These are the moments in glad I play Dwarf and can just get rid of those 10 min debuffs that common enemies out on you lmao
---
you still wait the same amount if you're constantly low on mana. the only difference is you use more water. as a tank you should *always* wait for 70%\~ mana on your healer before charging into a group with no cc, especially in the 50+ dungeons.
---
is this a copypasta, or did you really write an essay for a reddit post
---
Assuming everyone in the group has played WoW is how you end up wiping. It may work most of the time, but I, for example, played WoW abit back in TBC and stopped. So I appreciate it when people stop to have a plan for each room trash mobs or not. Expecting everyone in a pug to know the mechanics will lead to a wipe when people are new. As the comment higher up said, at the end of the day, planning and communicating leads to less wiping, you make assumptions and don't talk, then you're gonna start to see mistakes being made.
---
This is why being my husband's personal healer is fantastic for both of us. Lol. We are able to communicate constantly since we're in the same room and we know each other's styles so well that to everyone else it looks seamless. Not to say we've never had an oopsie, but we rarely wipe and we move at a quick pace.
---
I always chain pull so when 1 of the pack dies I shoot another untili see low mana
---
Yeah, exactly. You're taking up a raid slot for a class that can actually make a difference in the raid.
---
Can I have it?
---
From level 1. Just check youtube for the NightElf to Stormwind Shortcut. Took me a few minutes!
---
But it has the same impact, so why does it matter?
---
He yelled "Demacia!", not "Death to Hong Kong!" or some shit...
---
If you’re frontstabbing your way to 60, enjoy your carpal tunnel.
---
Tbh.....I did not know /sit unthil mist of pandaland. My toon sat down....when I went afk...
---
I don't consider anything &lt;50 to matter except for leveling difficulty when we're talking about class balancing. It passes so quickly compared to how many hours you spend in endgame.
---
ItemRack does this I'm pretty sure.
---
There's nothing "just by running around" in 6 hours of grinding.

Tl;dr

WTF is a zoomer?
---
I practically made them against mats for my guild, I also encouraged them to send me cloth, so I could make them bags and skill my tailoring.  
---
When I had sparebags, I never sold them but distributed them for free in my guild.  
---
Now I have 300 Tailoring and finally farmed out my robe of the void.  
---
Got two band of unicorn and sold my mooncloth cooldown under the value.  
---
Im broke, but I know I can make bank by farming felcloth. I am just lazy, as my epic mount doesnt contribute to my overall damage and gear and 1000g is ao much, I get demotivated once I think about it.
---
Hunh I didn't know that strength scaled better than agi.
---
yes. a friend of mine already has an arcanite reaper, epicmount and lionheart helmet
---
Water isnt expensive, you can conjure up as much as u want
---
Exactly. There's no denying this guy in the screenie is a dummy (literally refusing to play with ALL mages and warlocks.... Wtf) but at the same time.... I've seen way worse from the spellcleave side who act like they're so smart for creating this meta that has had a pretty negative impact on community morale. That being said, I think these groups aren't as common as people think - I see them post in lfg all the time but I've only ever had 2 groups turn into a spellcleave form pugging.
---
I play a priest and have tried this it allows you to buff them but then immediately cancels the MC and removes the buff?
---
I thought whirlwind was capped at 4?
---
Type this into general chat.. wtb portal to SW.
---
There's no need to be condescending. Your post nor your comment history implied that to me, which is why i highlighted it as an oddity. 
---
Does that 90% include vanilla / classic? 
---
I am a Tank through and through and have been for the past 15 years including Vanilla as a warrior, and again as a warrior in Classic. I can relate to a lot of what this post is saying as far as my experience so far. 
---
I'm not trying to argue with you, but if your experience doesn't include tanking in vanilla / classic i feel like you might not be able to properly empathize with the situation being laid out here.
---
he is probably using mindblast which is a fuckton of threat.
---
Owls are the best pets!!!
---
Absolutely, it's about principle, which people don't seem to get. The game shouldn't punish you for exploiting something you couldn't possibly know is an exploit. It's not like somethinf serious, which gets patched straight away - it is not intuitive that you can be banned for this.
---
Who's insulting/attacking you?? my first comment only stemmed because you were just complaining about a few things that weren't in classic wow. honestly not a big deal to me. but why the hell do some downvotes/comments matter... lol idk man you need to not worry so much about reddit imo
---

lmao I'm the opposite, got to 45 on my pally before deciding on a re-roll, now I cant play a few levels of anything questioning my decision :(
---
Correct. But since this is the first one we can assume it was one of the lucky servers.
---
I helped in vanilla, but this won't happen for a couple of months given even the best of luck.
---
bump need this
---
You’re not wrong. Your group, your rules. They seem reasonable too.
---
Seems like fun. 
---
I remember we raided horde as alliance back in the day. Fun but one thing got to me....why on Earth do I raid Orgrimmar? It’s ugly ....I don’t want it... I just wanna get home to beautiful stormwind;
---
Sadly horde never raided stormwind in my sever back then. And it turned out that horde got weaker and weaker and the server ended up with 99% alliance. But...it was a pve server so...
---
300 Tailoring, 300 First Aid, 300 Skinning.  
---
Robe of the Void and two band of unicorn.  
---
80% BiS gear.  
---
Hitting 60 today.  
---
Having all that before 60 is my achievement! :)
---
Honestly, let it roll off your back, my guy. This isn’t something exclusive to WoW. If you offer a service in the real world and someone that you don’t owe anything to asks for a favor and you say “no,” regardless of how politely you do it, you’re going to have those people who are just so entitled that they get indignant and rude.

Don’t sweat it, man. Sometimes people just suck. If you find some people that are cool and roll with your attitude on offering a valuable service such as tanking for no gain, friend them if they run the dungeon well and are polite, that way you narrow down the list of people you interact with to friendly players.
---
Doesn’t look like anything to me.
---
Yes they are lol. If you refuse to group with pally tanks you're actually just dumb and don't know anything
---
Right with you brother! Me personally, I’ve played so long I’m set up for any and all types of groups and don’t really favor. Sometimes I love a good AOE run and sometimes I love a nice single target one pull at a time clean finish. Just depends, it gets a little strange when it gets into demanding territory as the post shows.
---
You can jump off the boat that goes from menthil to Auberdine and swim to a small inlet.  drown your self at the inlet and you will spawn in dun morough at the spirit.
---
Can you link the source for that?
---
It is runoff from popular arena comp names from TBC onwards, wizard cleave is a popular term for most double caster team comps (usually involving a destro lock) as well as team comps like beast cleave (enhancement/beastmastery) Mancleave (protection warrior/Arms) and Kung Fu Cleave (Marksmanship/Arms). As to why it is used in classic wow, probably because “cleave” team comps in arena are often considered as braindead and just involves sitting on one guy the whole game like a mongoloid instead of trying to get proper kill setups, and how most spell cleave dungeon groups require similar levels of brain activity to cleave arena comps.
---
The words "Spell cleave" were used, however the definition is not the same as it is now.
---
Yeah, cos there arent a shitton of melee cleaves with warriors, shamans, druids and rogues.
---
The only class getting screwed by the meta are hunters
---
Getting into a group is easy. You can use general chat while you're near the dungeon and just say "LFG \[Dungeon Name\] \[Class/Level\]" for example, "LFG Dead Mines, 20 Rouge &amp; 20 Priest" - something like that.
---
You can also type /join lookingforgroup if you want to access the main channel for group finding. It's very active, so expect lots of spam. You can adjust your chat settings to create a new window for it, if you'd like.
---
As far as learning how to run the dungeons; each one is different. Most people are pretty chill and will tell you what to do / what not to do. Early dungeons have a lot of new people, so it is expected to see people who need help. By the time you reach harder dungeons, you will have learned how things typically work.
---
With looting, you are given the option to "Pass, Greed, or Need" items that are rare or above. You've probably already experienced this if you've been partying with your friend. Unless otherwise discussed, it is common to select "Greed" on everything that you **don't** need. If no one needs it, everyone should select "Greed" and RNG will decide. If you DO need the item, it is courteous to ask "Mind if I need this?" and if the group says it's cool, you select "Need". If no one else selected "Need", you will get the item.
---
What many people rage about is when a party member selects "Need" on rare items when they clearly don't need it. Like if a Mage selects Need on a sword when there is a warrior who clearly actually needs it.
---
That should get you started. You will learn a lot and have a ton of fun in dungeons. Good luck out there!
---
Yeah I'm so angry. Rawrrr so mad right now.
---
Interface &gt; Camera &gt; Max Camera Distance. Starts at minimal by default.
---
I'm just curious how you can enjoy that
---
Haha yup that was me. Thanks for helping me be done with that bloody quest.
---
You need tank+healer+3dps for regular 5man dungeon, which almost every dungeon is before lev60 UBRS and further raids like MC.
---
Join the LookingForGroup channel, people also use trade chat while you are in city for LFG/LFM (looking for more). Just do a LF3M SM in LFG chat every now and then and you'll likely find people.
---
Tank generally takes the lead so it's beneficial if they know the route. Many dungeons=instances are bit of puzzles. If one of you isn't a tank, you can have easier time learning where to go. Most of the earlier dungeons don't have anything too fancy. It can be helpful to polymorph one target as mage on bigger packs, hunter pet to offtank sometimes etc. but that's not too important in big picture.
---
You can always mention it before you start that it's your first time, makes people more acceptable to newb mistakes and can possibly make them tell you how to avoid them. Say in advance you don't know where the entrance is, if you don't. They are a bit hidden on some dungs.
---
Use Lookingforgroup instead.
---
/join Lookingforgroup
---
It's a Blizzard-sanctioned channel, so players can't become mods of the channel. And unlike trade chat, it's available worldwide. LFG channel is way more active than world chat or trade chat on my server.
---
I thought the opposite. $5 for 66 hours of /played sounds pretty fucking cheap to me.
---
The 2 things i miss the most as a current alliance player is female orcs and Undercity.
---
Fog!
---
Actually, pulling at an acceptable pace *is* part of a tank's job.
---
How does one even ban an entire guild from open world chat?
---
Ok prologue. Ive never played wow before, and have barely used guides. I'm a lvl 51 mage. I didnt know until yesterday I could port. I've literally been running everywhere between cities. That sense of accomplishment and return is definitely there. *I made it home*.
---
Well now that I can port I feel everything is just an illusion. Oh I'm in IF. Instantly back in SW. Look I ported my whole group in an instant. Not complaining, it's very convenient, but I lost a little bit of that *home* feeling. I just feel like a wanderer in the void. Maybe that's how mages aren't meant to feel..
---
I think there is something you can add to the launcher shortcut to select your server, or was in vanilla.
---
I just see this as being a perk of a Tank, yes it probably feels a little shitty being denied because you don't want competition on an item, but its not that much different from seeing groups saying "xxx is reserved".
---
Dungeon pacing is something people need to relearn after making the switch from retail. It's fun seeing the blend of pserver and retail players all doing runs together now.
---
For reputation in a main faction, that sell a mount, you only need to make the repeatable quest to turn in cloth.  
---
You literally can do that by your own if you skip First Aid and selling cloth and pump it to the questgiver.
---
I did tanaris field testing recently and damn this was annoying. You get a 100% drop per enemy, but you have to click each drop and it has like 10% to actually count towards the quest. You need 24 within 3 hours.
---
All I was thinking about was how I fucking hate this quest. But I also thought, if it would be easier it would just be like retail.
---
At least for most quests, if you complete them you actually feel great.
---
And to be honest, give the game a few more months and every quest will be much easier. Currently everything is overfarmed.
---
Screenshot a of people going.. afk.. for BJ's? That's the content you crave? I don't wanna yuck someone else's yum, but I don't think a general wow subreddit is what you want.
---
He is, I tamed him yesterday.
---
Yes but they are all level 1 trying to sell each other gold
---
And this is why pservers had moderated world channel, big surprise someone would abuse this
---
Thank you. It's a script that you have to put in an addon.
---

Um, no? Or am i completly losing it. Maybe its diffrent cus me and my wife send and return to ones other, so diffrent accounts
---
I use the same argument for bad plots in modern Marvel Comics, just stick to the classic books, the new shit is the product of bad writing.
---
I'd get a laugh out of it. Fuck people take shit so seriously. Bunch of autists.
---
What’s the best way to find a dungeon group? Is it to ask in the zone the dungeon is located in, the dungeons general chat itself or city chat?
---
Agility gives 1 melee attack power but 2 ranged attack power.
---
It should say return delete and reply, not in that order i belive tho
---
You will always get an upvote from me!
---
Jealousy.
---
I love it, reminds me of home.
---
The key is to completely avoid Gnomeregan
---
World chat isn't open. It's a private chat controlled by a player. Due to how chat channels work, ownership bounces around.
---
Whoever got the ownership decided to ban these people. In order to get it undone, the current owner (whoever that ends up being) needs to manually unban each one.
---
LookingForGroup is blizzard controlled.
---
They used a player-created channel instead of the official LookingForGroup channel, and player-created channels are controlled by the players that created it.
---
This could be the end of the WORLD... of warcraft.
---
Best thing to do for finding a group is to advertise in a major city; Stormwind, Ironforge or Darnassus if you're Alliance and Orgrimmar, Thunderbluff or Undercity if you're Horde.
---
You'd basically state what dungeon it is, and what your roles are, so something like *Tank &amp; Healer LFG for X dungeon* or *2 dps LFG for X dungeon*. Most people use Trade Chat (type /2 and hit spacebar, then type your message and hit enter) for this, since it is viewable across all your faction's cities. You can also advertise in the zone's chat, or /1 and in the designated LFG chat (/join LFG).
---
Dungeon etiquette is pretty basic... Be polite. Stick with your group, roll greed on green quality loot, don't roll need on anything you do not need unless it's stated to do so, and roll to loot chests (/roll, whoever gets highest number gets to open it). Don't pull things the tank hasn't pulled unless they ask you to.
---
Most experienced players will be happy to help you if something confuses you during the run, too.
---
Good luck and have fun!
---
Yeah it was stupid in TBC and it's stupid now. 
---
There is no point to use this vernacular. It's so stupid and pointless.
---
i made 1.6k this week trading the AH for like.. 3 hours a night. is that still layering? or just a lot of people with gold that I can trade against?
---
I was slightly ahead of the pack levelling.  About a week behind the first 60s on the server but two weeks ahead of the "main crush" who were busy spamming for spell leave groups in cathedral and zf while I was questing in UnGoro.
---
Devilsaurs were basically untouched.  I saw several walking around while I was questing and started calling out in general coordinates whenever I saw one.  I quickly had a 60 Hunter tip me and tell me to whisper him instead of broadcasting on general whenever I saw one up.  I probably made 20g just in tips from him for the two days I was there.
---
Your the leader of the group,  it IS your job to lead us through as quickly and efficiently as possible
---
Big facts. As a healer I haaaate when tanks go slow. A dungeon with a slow tank can literally take 3-4x as long and it makes me want to yank my teeth out. I usually don't say anything because I don't wanna flame new players for not being good but part of being a good tank is learning to move fast and get threat quickly. Just like part of a good healer/DPS's job is to know how to drink and do their job in the most efficient way possible
---
Exactly. Orc fanatic here and there was no honor in this
---
Doesn't that have the same effect as the PvP templates from Legion?
---
When everyone's overtuned, no one will be.
---
Safe. Travels.
---
Me and my wife do the same, except to eachother. Its really useful this early on
---
Maybe this is an unpopular opinion but I dont think classic wow is streamer friendly. The amount of grind and doing nothing makes it addicting to play but isn't great to watch. Highlight videos are the best for classic content though, the highs are high and entertaining while the lows are cut from production. Itll get even better in phase 2 when people are thirsty for world pvp action, I expect a lot of great content coming then.
---
Actually the healer should communicate as well. All party members should communicate, because everyone benefits from it. It's kinda pissing me off how most of the party members stay silent. The majority of people don't fkn talk! Exactly like Vanilla. Glad I'm the tank and almost always the party leader, and my brother is almost always the healer, because man do most people suck on communicating. Like either people generally are afraid to interact, don't care, prefer not to speak because 'l33t people are the silent performers', have zero sense in how to teamwork, or just don't know their shit and other people's shit very well.
---
I'm doing meleecleaves mostly, but before that I ran with Mages and Locks. Fkn Mages and Locks not communicating and AoEing the shit out of my pulls way too early really pisses me off, because it's impossible to keep threat from them.
---
Anyway, what helps is if the tank has once in his life mained a healer (pre class overhaul), and vice versa for the healer.
---
Idk what's with all the haters, this reminds me of the pvp montages of old. The only thing separating them is the fact that this isn't 15 fps
---
World chat is a player created channel. Whoever was the first person on the channel to create world chat became the admin of it on that server. When that person goes offline, admin privileges pass to someone else, I think the person who's been on the server the next-longest. An admin of a chat channel and ban people from it. So either someone with a grudge against OP's guild or some random troll could ban an entire guild if they wanted.
---
If you are cool with being hated by booty bay you can kill the guards and pvp AND YOU GET A COOL PIRATE COSTUME AND NAME.
---
Oh wow, I did not know that, good luck to OP
---
Are boomers anybody over 15 now?
---
Honestly, hunters get a pass too for a lower level, ranged attacks can't glance.
---
I played both factions in vanilla. I preferred horde.
---
I have a 15 human priest and a 12 orc shaman on separate servers. Alliance chat is my speed now. Edgy kids have infected the horde.
---
ITT: Creepers
---
Additional protip for Horde druids: teleport to Moonglade and take a free flight to Thunderbluff, then a 99c flight to Orgrimmar. It takes forever but it's cheap and I get a chance to get up and throw in some laundry or dust or something so I don't feel like a complete failure at life.
---
I would rather see artwork than posts like this bashing people who having actual talent
---
Skeram!
---
Yes to all 3.
---
You can also join the looking for group channel (/join LookingForGroup), which is a global channel and spam there.
---
I usually post up in a city and look there while I have a group member look for people in the local channels.
---
Bottom text
---
"no u"
---
Thanks! got it installed. How do you scan with it manually? I have added the NPC name to the list.
---
Horde bad alliance good updoots to the left 😎
---
Ride or die &lt;3
---
I wasn’t talking about you, was referring to whomever was arguing with me for no reason above. I don’t care lol
---
I’ll stick with the Shaman then. I’m liking the spiky DPS and support role, it’s very different from my Warrior in Classic Classic and with Totem twisting, removing poisons, dispelling and interrupting I find it more of a methodical playstyle than bashing my face as a Warrior.
---
https://i.redd.it/rl6kalgkdyiz.png
---
Everyone wants to feel special.  Shedo showed them how. #churchofshedo #furries4life
---
That's a priest only bug and its getting fixed in a second lol
---
As a mage I do drink after every pull usually.  Tank never waits for me to mana up so I'm constantly between 25-50% mana
---
Spot on! Zante it is!
---
I grouped with a rogue the other day before he pulled the boss he asked me if I had my cooldowns (am priest have zero CDs over 30sec) I just said yep - lmao.  
---
Rogues have an insane amount of options
---
I could teach you, but I'd have to charge
---
This. I get it's "classic" but forcing hardware limitations/bad game design on players for authenticity is stupid. Not being able to see anything because it's blanketed by thick fog really ruins the experience for me. And the nameplate distance lock has made playing a ranged class incredibly tedious. I understand the entity view distance limit though because that would change PvP even if I think it would be better if it were increased.
---
Ok.
---
Guessing you won't see many regardless, getting the insane numbers does take a lot of work.  Much easier to just spam frostbolt.
---
Zakynthos =D
---
Just make it collect 50 skulls. 100% drop chance.
---
Even if it's similar dps it would be insanely mana inefficient. Not enough people take dpm into consideration.
---
I thought they broke Eye of Kilrogg so it wont do this anymore
---
I really think my playing schedule would fit better there. Just wanna know if the ping difference would be that big of a deal
---
He was being pretty cool about it in chat, it was OP here that went full salty in the whispers, let's be honest here dude.
---
Non-value added activity. Gotta have Lean in mind
---
Nice alt account.
---
They have 2 vanishes 2 sprints 2 evasions how can you say they have no mobility or escape tools.
---
That's a lot for classic, especially when not every class has an automated bleed in their ability, there isn't that much need for CoS. 
---
Mutliate and envenom are just fancy backstab/eviserate.
---
Undead rogue maybe?
---
Overzealous dps that don’t drop threat/run mob back to tank/kite are just as bad as tanks who spend 30 minutes per pull. It’s never the tanks job to pull a mob off a dps. It’s a dps’s job to correct their mistake if they pull threat of a tank. 
---
I would consider myself incredibly friendly in game. I enjoy helping people. I enjoy pugging dungeons and meeting new people. I also always wait for the tank not only to get threat, but also to pull (and I’m a hunter for Christ’s sake)
---
What I don’t like, is players who have an issue with shifting meta, playing in complete denial because of their self importance or willful ignorance. Games change. This tank is deciding to post some cringey slam poetry on reddit because he doesn’t want to adapt. Like I said, he will quit the game before BWL comes out. He will be ignored on his server. He will never get thunderfury (reason he filled tank obviously)
---
There are two ways to say something. All he had to say was “the meta shifting to massive aoe pulls sucks in my opinion. It’s a pain in the ass to get threat on a million mobs and I’m sick of hearing mages cry about not going fast enough. Rip my enjoyment”. 
---
Instead it’s “Woman! Woah-man! She took my cat” type “hear me roar” bullshit that makes him look like a self and terrabad player who will never adapt.
---
gotcha, sorry yo.
---
Lmao n00b get better
---
So why don’t you block channel invites..?
---
Sounds to me like you're being pedantic. In common parlance cleave just means hitting multiple targets, and the term spellcleave was created to distinguish groups interested solely in casters.
---
Whoever designed this chain should be put down
---
Not saying anything specifically about asmon.
---
A majority of the report call-to-actions I see from streamers are completely a joke and for revenge. 
---
It should at least be considered as we would if anyone made a witch hunting post on Reddit, considering how much more impacting a stream like this can be.
---
I’m a gnome rogue! But I’m nice, I swear.
---
Just make the item a bit more rare.
---
Instead of the skull, make it a undamaged skull. Instead of a good, make it a perfect hoof. 
---
It is satin the same item bit out makes more sense that it have a lower droprate
---
If you actually think they got this legitimately in only a week, I have a bridge to sell you.
---
crafted items are no where near as rare as black lotus.
---
Pretty sure it just evaded your Succubus attacks not Shadowbolt.
---
I’m a rogue and as long as I can beat the fear I have no problems against warlocks. Sometimes when it’s close I find myself frantically bandaging as to avoid dying to dots after I’ve killed them heh.
---
Like trying to tame a wild animal.  If you let your guard down you’ll get mauled to death.
---
My only thing is that I really dont want to cancel my drink when its vendor water.  If we have a mage though, no problem.
---
Alliance do not have zeppelins, just boats, and we have no direct boat to STV. We have boats to Theramore and Auburdine on Kalimdor and that’s it. To get to STV you have to run from duskwood all the way south. We also don’t have a good flight path in STV.
---
#FBI OPEN UP
---
I somewhat understand this sentiment but when I make a group I still invite casters. I just make it clear we are not AoE farming before we set foot in the instance. Anyone who complains I explain my reasons (AoE farms are not fun for me and I'm not speedrunning to 60), if they still object I kick them out.
---
the point is that his entire intent was to piss people off. he wasnt just put yelling "Demacia" minding his own business, dude was out trying to start shit with the knowledge that if anyone acts out against him, he can play the victim.
---
I have had a fair amount of success as a Warrior as long as Berserker Rage is up. Helps being able to just say no to fear and whack away
---
dead or alive
---
Not unpopular to me. This is why the old school PvP videos were the best. All of the best 2 shot crits and none of the boring grinding/killing 1000 murlocs to level.
---
It’s not good or useful, but I’m going to collect it anyways so I can do tier 0.5 in Phase 5.
---
Previous guy is wrong. It's called a sequence macro. Just Google a totem sequence macro, I would post mine but I'm on mobile.
---
just follow this ... it should keep you right!

ok I'm trying and the bird master or w/e vesprystus only takes me to darkshore
---
So if you're waiting that you should have plenty of time to make a proper screenshot
---
&gt;I understand wanting a unique identifier to easily get across a concept and find like minded individuals, but it's really just a catchy/edgy name that when taken at face value is just jibberish.
---
It baffles me how people take this shit so seriously. On the one hand you admit to understanding the intent of a term like "spellcleave" but then you go on to say it's just an edgy (lol, what?) gibberish term. It's obviously used in order to broadcast that you are looking only for casters and honestly it's astonishing to me that anyone would take issue with something so mundane.
---
In Retail leveling is not a valid form of content. It's a means to an end, which is endgame. In Classic you can very much sustain yourself solely through leveling if you choose to. Even if you only Raid, you have to obtain gold and/or consumables for the next Raid.
---
no it doesnt. dont reply if you don't know please
---
Tier 1 armor sets look cool af though
---
If you don’t add that guy to your friends that’s you’re own damn fault.
---
ADS is a hell of a disease
---
You needed at least one Druid that could at least heal a little.
---
Who cares dude are you really this pedantic or do you just see shit like this as an opportunity to show of your knowledge of niche subjects.
---
The main flaw with warlocks is they aren't super strong at duelling unless they're SL, and if they are SL, then they aren't very good at anything *except* duelling.
---
Every been on a one way cruise and told the captain to make a pit stop at an island? No i didnt think so.
---
He killed 3 horde :(
---
Or at least hold the phone straight.
---
Ah here they come, yes because there aren't anywhere from 3-5 capital cities per server because of layering. Keep enjoying your pseudo PvP.
---
Because I don't want to block the legit ones?
---
horde attacked and got beaten. fair enough. corpse camping 30 times? how is that fair
---
I want you to know I spent a good 2 hours of my Saturday slaughtering alliance scum all across Westfall and Redridge. hundreds of kills. you have been repaid
---
If you are twinking to stomp noobs you are doing it wrong.
---
The great thing about twinking is fighting other twinks. At max level, there is a much wider variance in power levels, and only the most devoted can be min/ maxed for that bracket.
---
Twinks give more people a shot at being as strong as possible for the bracket, which leads to fairer, more competitive matches.
---
Blasting away the occasional noob stepping into a BG while leveling is just icing on the cake.
---
Lol imagine caring this much about some shit like this. 
---
It's not pointless it's the name for a comp and it tells other people what you're looking for, don't be a pedant.
---
literally never heard the word spellcleave in my life. And now you both use it?
---
bad fake messages
---
I get how the lock solos Incendous, but how do they get there easily? Do they just kill everything or death run and soulstone?
---
Add me on B.net! My guild's core is a bunch of IRL friends who all played from classic-wotlk so we know the game pretty well. We're adding people slowly until we have a solid core of raiders/pvp that all mesh. We'll also be raiding and doing pvp so whenever you hop in there will be someone leveling with you, and plenty of people to help defend your grinds on this brutal server.

Killing quests.  
---
Just invite your alt into a party, accept the quests.  
---
Add everything and tank it down with reflect damage and consecration.  
---
Hand in all quests and continue.  
---
If you make a hunter, you can accept the nesingwary killquests about 10 levels prior to when it was intented for.  
---
You get a pretty good weapon, which is super powerful, as its usually too high lvl for you.  
---
But its a questreward, so it has no lvl restriction.
---
"hey look I have a gf"
---
Pick up groups are like that
---
I misread your original comment. I thought you were saying the majority played vanilla. I agree that most played wotlk or earlier, but I'm finding out there are a surprising amount of younger players around age 18 that never played wow at all.
---
Look into the fix glow macro, don't know it off the top of my head but it helps
---
I would've left the second the guy called dibs. That's now how this game works in any capacity. If you want dibs, you have to group with friends or guildies who understand you're there for that specific item,not just demand ownership over said item to random people. That's why the loot system is luck based not dibs based
---
Idk man as a new player playing a DPS caster, I’ve learned quick how much threat I can throw out to what level mobs to avoid pulling them off the tank. Sometimes I go too hard and pull Aggro, and sometimes tank can’t pull them back off me and I die or at least have to retreat and spend 20 seconds life tapping and healthstoning back up to a reasonable level.
---
Some individual pieces of tier 0 might be pre-raid bis for some classes but by and large, no, stats-wise, is not worth collecting the entire sets. Every class has better options for pre-raid bis. 
---
Now, you may collect them because they look cool and that's totally valid.
---
Uh okay
---
You're leaving damage on the table if you don't use slice and dice. I'm done trying to convince you guys of something that has been obvious for 14 years.
---
You are a bad rogue if you don't use slice and dice all the time.
---
I'd probably just hit up trade chat once you hit your big city in the starting Zones.
---
If you ask to join a guild I'm positive one is more than happy to have you.
---
Although I'd reccomend playing until you make some friends through dungeons and questing and then maybe join up with their guild as joining randos can be awkward and alot of them have a built in clique.
---
Then if the warlock is destruction and whips the ol' succubus out, it gets pretty one sided. Free soul fire into death coil and it's pretty gg. Now I have no experience at level 60 with proper gear, but I feel like warlocks scsle pretty well with gear so I don't see the match-up getting any easier.
---
Back in your day it was called cleave as well. You just weren't exposed to it.
---
If that's 40% of WoW to you you need to re-evaluate your life
---
I’ve had more allis gank, mess with me, than horde ganking on an alli that didnt mess with someone. Even had an alli guy quest in a zone filled with horde and no one touched him. Horde plays with honour.
---
I want to fit in with the spellcleave too :(, all my ZF runs have been with outcasts of the ZF GY farm. Rogues, hunters, shadpriest and dps pally.
---
Blacklist them and if a certain guild always comes in a negative way let the guild master know.
---
At least that's what I do.
---
So you mean jerks are jerks? Kinda getting annoyed at this "all mages are this" talk. I've been playing mage since I was 5. Stop focusing on people who have crap personality traits and blaming it on class
---
Im sure they all have fun cheating each others dicks off and pretending like theyre good at the game without earning anything
---
You claim you were part of the guild who achieved this so i guess you want some tips about how to not get kicked?
---
Not  Maroon 12?
---
Are you scared of Blizz tracking you? Because players don’t have access to what your on about.
---
Ah yes 0.5 - which in addition to not being or useful, is also very expensive.
---
Was this on Incendius? I swear I've seen this guy before
---
Not sure if you're trolling or making a joke or something, but spellcleave is a massive meta since launch of various setups but I believe the current vogue is 3 mage, 1 lock, 1 priest mass pulling dungeons to speed clear and level very quickly.
---
It's aids and made me just respec shadow and stop healing dungeons until 60 because the "retail brain" meme was very real.
---
Are there screenshots of that?
---
The WoW Forums and mmo-champion have a special kind of belligerent stupidity.
---
Ann damm I sent the wrong link! Damm phone!
---
So is Reddit. Where do you go then?
---
I’ve never seen anything like that, but have you checked the pre-made ones on wago.io for something like that?
---
Might just be easier to make your rage bar large enough to keep an eye on and dump rage down to 25 before swapping.
---
Fantastic, many legit LOL moments. Keep the vids coming
---
why? outside of boss fights they're on the same cd
---
Class discords pretty much
---
wtf? step into SM for literally 2 minutes and youll see at least 10 groups spamming for mages to join their spellcleaves

Wasn't an insult feller.  Have a free hug on me

The cool parry-game, not the cool hentai volleyball game.

Paladin main tanks are 100% effective in my experience with five mans.
---
Auctioneer would work as well. So you can organize searches to get to bigger stacks. (Asssuming your post is about the single pieces, right?)
---
But you can still be stealthy person with a golden tongue..... that explodes people.
---
Yeah it's very hard to lose aggro to a healer almost impossible if you switch attack targets.
---
had a resto sham roll need on the cloth belt from brd arena (spell dmge/healing and spell hit). me and another mage both needed, (BIS for mages and cloth dps). we were super pissed. 
---
if you are looking for a specific item, make your own group of people who dont need that item so you wont upset anyone, and as a tank or healer, itll be super easy to get a group.
---
Battle shout and demo shout build threat well.

Rogue is maybe first or second best class at getting away tbh! Vanish, improved sprint, all the stuns, crippling poison, blind...

Ye. It will come soon tm

They need to learn to ignore the lock tapping to 10hp on pull
---
I used to play mage back then.  
---
I rolled warlock this time and I exactly know what you mean. Back then my hearthstone was a convenient position for raiding and barely used. (kargath; badlands).  
---
Now my hearthstone is my only way to quicktravel outside of flightpoint and zeppelins.  
---
But the feeling of riding into orgrimmar with people duelling outside and a filled city and occasional onyxia head when you ride in is just epic.

I think in chronicle, there’s a more realistic to scale map of the Broken Isles and Kul Tiras. And I believe Kul Titans was moved out from the cove below Gilneas and more out to sea by the cataclysm
---
You know what? Usually I won't call people out on English skills because not everyone on Reddit speaks English as their first language and idioms/turns of phrase are hard to translate if you're not familiar. You seem like a genuinely unhappy human being because of how you came at me so let me dumb it down and explain it to you.
---
"Decimate" is a word with Latin roots. In the Roman military, it was a punishment handed out for disobedience or cowardice where legionaries were divided into lots of 10 men. The 10 would draw lots and the one with the short straw would be beaten to death by his comrades. "Decimate" came to be known as a term for losing a significant portion of your forces, but the literal meaning is to lose 10% of.
---
So no, the root comment was not a layering joke but a joke at OP's expense because they misused "Decimate." Half of the city being decimated literally means that 10% of half of the city was killed.
---
Happy to hear. You taught me about the 308 Cap and I could teach you about Parry being superior x) 
---
&gt; Let me know if you know your way around GitHub/Vue.js I can just give you access to the repo (it deploys automatically via Netlify)  
---
No idea about any of these. I tried getting an apprenticeship to learn programming, but sadly never got to it. Certainly gonna bookmark your site though. I already have my BiS written down in an excel but it still has good rogue infos I might need later down the line.
---
Is server transfer going to be an option in the future?
---
Dude was a complete asshole. 
---
We need 1% of the population to be willing to go ham and beat the shit out of these people for us to stop other people from becoming assholes with no reprecussions. 
---
So my high IQ reddit brethren, I don't suggest that YOU go beat people up. Just know that the people who are willing to go to prison for us are doing Gods work.
---
Adds damage and therefore threat, ie, you take less damage, repair less, die less, etc.
---
The way you explained it makes me feel like Mages should feel this way. There must be a sacrifice.
---
Wait like 5 seconds and then pull, depending on he tank and dung he can be basically dead before I get full mana and I'm through the cast time for the heal (as a druid)
---
To me it depends. Once I got my 40 mount my mentality switched more to save. Before that it was sell so I have a mount at 40.
---
Nah
---
DM is nice with tank. Once you hit SM/ZF you have so much survivability on a mage that tank is redundant unless you actually need something to take a beating... but most groups can just run 4 mages and a priest and good to go till the big bois show up
---
Oh dude that sounds epic. Maybe I'll witness something similar, but I am on alliance.
---
Horde definitely has a huge circle jerk about being Horde that has been going for over a decade but in my experience the people are the same on both sides
---
The guide on wowhead says that's the go to for phase 1.
---
Im gonna say it's incredibly understandable that people would be confused.
---
No, any mob can drop a purple in it's level range.
---
Right on, thanks. I rolled warlock so I don’t have to buy a mount but I still want to focus on making gold at higher levels. I went super try hard in retail during Legion and bought all the gold sink mounts besides the dinosaur and I still have 2 million on one character. I’ll def check out Hydramist.
---
Yeah it will be like 1s tops
---
"the curtains were blue"
---
Because I am fucking blind.
---
I just looked at this on the same site, but I didn't findit due my blindness.
---
Strange really.  IIRC the keyring was added in 1.11 and supposedly Classic has all of the QoL and balance changes from 1.12, so really the keyring feature should be there.
---
Regardless of if it was world first or not, it still deserves a congrats. :D
---
Of course :D it wouldn't be WoW if I wouldn't find a way to implement leveling, training, skills, etc. somehow. But I'll try to include them in a subtle way. Don't expect to see one of the characters talking to a trainer a learning 3 new fighting techniques in a second xD
---
Was it a world first like you claimed?
---
I think the warrior is extremely gear dependent so that could very well be the case. I’ve been lucky on drops. Whirlwind at lvl 30, nightblade epic mid 40’s, and a plethora of other relevant tank/dps drops. 
---
Also, I may be a little spoiled with the healer I have. ;)
---
A lot of it at 60 is just being careful to walk around mobs
---
I mean ok but that's doesn't really answer the implied question - if they were in vanilla in 1.12 why aren't they in Classic?  
---
And the answer is that they've confirmed they're coming soon, they just didn't make launch.
---
When I was levelling I came across a guy, who shouted very funny but still spell related stuff when he was casting spells. It was an addon he said. I didn't ask which one it is. I thought it would be very easy to find but it is not. I forgot the dude's name and I'm unable to find this addon. There's an addon called "SpeakinSpell" but I couldn't get it working in Classic. Any ideas?
---
Do you know when this will come?
---
Aoe is much easier than spellcleave.
---
I've never played the retail version of Rogue. I logged into my vanilla 55 rogue a few times but never really played her so I don't know even know what stuff you're talking about missing. The kit feels plenty fun to me, it might be exciting to get new stuff later or if I roll a new one on retail but this is how I remember Rogue.
---
My current relationship with the opposite faction is if I don't one-shot them with gnomish death ray I run away.
---
Congrats brother. Even though I’m alliance. On Herod.
---
I had 25 gold at 37 and bought my mount halfway through 40, it picks up
---
It was also because Pandarens were a popular joke in WC3 because they were bonus NPCs in one mission, and later Chen became a playable hero in the expansion. 
---
Combined with being popular in China and voila MoP is a thing.
---
As mage in alliance its hard man.  
---
You spawn in the mage tower and use the AH and everything. While the head is outside after the bridge at the gates. So you could easily miss it and use the flightmaster and pass it by accident. Beware my friend! :)
---
The pain lol. I tried out a Warrior and Priest. Both in the low 20s. Im hoping to stay with my Pally lol.
---
OP plays a healer and down ranks his heals for mana efficiency
---
That’s not the question that was asked. It’s if they were available in vanilla, which the website I linked states that they were added in 1.11.
---
As for why they aren’t in classic, that’s a separate question.
---
No.  In common parlance for MMOs, cleave is a 2-3 target hit, usually in front of you.
---
In all fairness it was informative, and I agree with him. Classic is fun, so is BC. I’m mostly playing classic in hopes of BC releasing in a few years.
---
Ungoro with skinning and herb. Run around, pick up soil, pick up crystals. Kill and skin everything in an area devilsaur can spawn. Ez money.
---
I’m leveling my warrior right now (level 32) and have been going an arms/fury build. Occasionally I tank the odd dungeon too. Am I going to be able to find some dungeon groups at 60 for some dps gear? Or will people only take a DW fury build after it’s geared? I’m I going to be able to tank as fury right away? Or will I have to wait a bit?
---
Yes you can fish up loot.  I fished up a level 20 robe when I was level 17 recently.
---
Exactly, find a way to circumvent that and you're exploiting.  Thanks for proving my point dumbass.
---
lol wtf ok dude. who gives a fuck what people call it if you know what they mean
---
You got nothing to lose ganking a paladin tbh, if they're bad you get a kill,  if they're good you can most likely disengage because they have no movement. 
---
Unless you get your cheeks clapped by reckoning, but that's unlikely in classic.
---
Cuz pve sucks
---
Imma have to disagree with you here. For me, I know that there's so much that can go wrong so I'd rather be at full mana just in case. It won't be the end of the world if the group waits like 10 seconds lol
---
Imagine getting this triggered by two words.
---
SPELL.
---
CLEAVE.
---
That is bs! That’s like the only fun part
---
I'm convinced that the majority of the classic wow population is between 12-18 years old. This sub is so fucking insecure about everything, why else would the top post of all time be a circlejerk about how you shouldn't level quickly.
---
I feel you, level 36 warrior without ww axe (Heartseeker is useless same with my guild) and still using green gear. All my silver goes into repair costs and food materials for cooking  because I do like approx 90 damage on auto attack with a 2h on mobs with 1200hp, and they hit me twice as fast and do the same damage. I hamstring kite as best I can but with melee leeway I usually end up sub 30% hp.
---
Undead priest - dispel dots, wotf and silence the fear.
---
Hillsbrad is alliance territory.  Horde scum keep out
---
You are a good mage.  Thank you!
---
Really? That sucks.
---
I'm only level 18 :/ I can only really play on weekends. It'll be a long time until 60 but that's just fine by me :)
---
Good job reaching 51 already man, impressive for a first time noob
---
Yeah, I think Patreon and Kickstarter are a gray area/loophole in copyright. You're not selling the IP, just getting "paid" to make it. Call it being funded and it's completely different, legally, because it amounts to fanart.   
---
But IANAL and if Activision or Blizzard actually want to hit you with a CAD they probably could.
---
:)
---
Sure...but that's your solution for a perfect world. In this world, the mobs keep poisoning the rogue, making stealth impossible.
---
Given that, you could either (a) kill mobs that don't poison you, (b) spec combat and treat the opportunities to stealth as a bonus, or (c) cry about immersion because you're temporarily inconvenienced by poison.
---
IDK about y'all, but A and B make a lot more sense than C.
---
As a 25 hunter I try to just auto attack for awhile before using my sting and aimed shot. The problem is my venomstrike can randomly Proc few times during the opening of a pull and I sometimes pull too much aggro. Should I not attack at all until 5 seconds is up? I don’t want to be that hunter that tanks hate.
---
I jump every paladin and walk away if I can't win. Call me a scumbag for taking my free kills idm.
---
Then don’t be surprised when me and the tank decide to replace you because your dps and your comeplety replaceable. Or I “accidentally” let you die.
---
As I tank I often get invited to these groups
---
I leveled prot in classic. Now Arms. I think prot would work as well or better. Arms makes it difficult to survive more than a double pull.
---
Yup it's so ridiculous to make KT that big, and they did it just to give players "a new area" for expansion #whocaresanymore. I love the lore and the world building of Warcraft so seeing them mess around like this is really irritating.
---
Undead fury warrior, undead rouge, dwarf shadow priest and I think beast master hunters have the tool sets to fight warlocks.
---
As an overall class I believe it's rouges, again beast master hunters and fury warriors. 
---
It also depends on player experience and which pet the warlock is fighting with.
---
Agree with everything about knowing but having no need to go to places ect..
---
Also - there was the cataclysm.
---
Use CC's! It might seem obvious but they really make your life different, I ran with a similar group today and we had little issues, also suggest kiting to your tank if you have classes that can slow like frost mages, hunters or warriors. Also mark priority mobs, the caster skeleton, the scarlet battle mages ecc need to be killed firstly
---
don't thunderclap its a waste of rage and probably a big reason you are having so many threat issues.   
---
Berserker rage &gt; charge mid charge switch to defensive stance (tactical mastery is invaluable). Now demo shout for Hot / small heal agro and then priority is revenge &gt; sunder switching targets. Once you've established agro you can also start shield block revenging. Another thing is you don't have to tank everything in the pull. It's totally okay to let the first target which should be a caster be tanked by a rogue or kited by a caster and just throw a taunt or an interrupt on it occasionally.  
---
Don't take this the wrong way because I'm 100 % just trying to be helpful, but your post has shown you have a lot to learn about tanking.
---
Hey Militia! Good to know you're still around. We did have some really good times raiding back in the day. I'm on Grobbulus with a cool guild I joined after classic started. If you're ever feeling the reroll or the transfer, let me know!
---
I'm sorry, but you seem to be under the belief that things that don't explicitly please you make you angry. 
---
Is this correct?
---
What exploit? There was never a raod exploit.
---
vendor it, thats an ez 62S mate
---
Nope.
---
That's surprising, makes sense though with the direction they are taking the art of hearthstone
---
I prefer improved overpower but you could change thoese 2 around!

I did the same in vanilla
---
Mage was trash anyway, jebait wasnt even necessary...
---
It's really silly. That guy saying a few items dropping at 33% drop rate is lottery level luck. Lmao.
---
The main problem with shadow in particular is gear priority. Even if you do get into a guild as shadow, you damn well better know you are dead last to get upgraded in a 40 man team, over half of which (dps and healers that all use cloth) take priority.
---
Even in dungeons I have to go out of my way to let people know I'm after shadow gear if they're cool with it. Half of them are, and half of them kick me without a word or asking me not to roll on the dps gear.
---
I essentially run with groups planning to farm until nobody a specific dps drop. The bis pants for example in lbrs I only got after a lock and mage both won theirs and were after the gloves.
---
If you arent the gm or in an irl guild, you probably wont have a good time even if you get to play shadow. Because of getting loot dead last it puts you in a cycle; by the time you start getting gear the new content is out and you're in pre-bis blue gear STILL. Its rough.
---
Dont be fooled by anyone though; priest healing is powerful enough that you can easily heal 5 mans AND raids as a 20/0/31 spec full shadow.
---
And nothing can or will be done about it
---
I like the chicken version
---
Just another beaten corpse off the road nothing to see here.

So this is where the CST realms went!

Yes I really am this pedantic.

The art is beautiful. I like it. It feels like it is a screenshot from a high quality anime scene. Make me want to see the full episode \*\_\*.
---
How did you get in there at 14 haha
---
The honor is in killing alliance. Not how you go about doing it. Kill everybody
---
Welcome onboard comrade.
---
Not in 60 / raid.
---
And in WarCraft II Kul Tiras was actually southeast of Gilneas, in the gulf.
---
I am being pedantic. Congratulations on understanding a word.
---
*laughs in unending breath*
---
Not everyone has free drinks from a mage, and I don't feel like tossing away silver just because someone does not want to wait a few extra seconds.
---
You could also just create a macro for it. A simple one would be:
---
    #showtooltip Frostbolt
---
    /s "Ice to meet you!"
---
    /cast Frostbolt
---
And make something like that for each spell.
---
All you can do is lead your own parties man. Im a druid tank and take anyone with me, haven't had any issues yet. It's upsetting when people won't even give it a chance because it's not what they've seen on stream.
---
Is time spent having fun truly time wasted?
---
This is actually a great example of everyone being civil and I can see why researchers in the past have gone to the extent of studying wow players in comparison to the general public! 
---
This is crazy from someone outside of the game to think but looking at this you can see the similarities from real life into this virtual reality.
---
I dont want to lookup raid lockouts. I want to lookup how many times I've entered a dungeon in the last hour so I dont hit the limit I can't enter more dungeons . 
---
Because in some dungeons (UBRS for example) you want to look for specific rare spawns at the beginning and reset up to 4 times.
---
It's not just capitols. As soon as you enter an opposing faction zone, pvp is toggled on automatically no matter the server type. The difference between pve and pvp servers is entering an uncontested zones on pvp servers toggles pvp on automatically.
---
so don't roll a class that is one of the best healers and worst dps in the game.
---
You only need 40 people to complete a roster and beat a raid, and a shaman enhancement is as good as anyone else.
---
There is no need for optimized composition or high-end gear to clean what is available for now, so there is no point for you to worry. Being a shaman alone is worth a place in a raid.
---
Generally I'd blindly say you were wrong, but if they flopped on critical strike damage not damaging a shield, anything is possible.
---
Please expand upon this statement
---
China Gold Farm factory  SA.
---
I spent good 10min googling what Spellcleave ment. Could have just looked in the comments
---
No reason to visit, even in BFA
---
Could you explain please
---
I am quite sure you are not a spokesperson for an entire community. 
---
In my opinion, this belongs here.
---
The one posted today was also gained from layer exploits.
---
sounds like a dick indeed
---
MP5 is good because it still works during the "5 second rule."
---
When you start casting a spell, your mana regen from Spirit stops for 5 seconds. If you are a mage and constantly casting spells to do your damage, you will get little, if any, regen from your Spirit during a fight. MP5 doesn't care about the 5 second rule, therefore becomes very valuable.
---
I’m rogue and that rogue deserved that
---
Its because it works independent of the “5 sec rule.” Yeah it’s kind rare on items.
---
Question, are you going holy spec while leveling?
---
Or is that more of a 60 spec?
---
Rolling a priest for the first time and I've been going shadow so far just because it seems easier to kill mobs.
---
Depends, I can go toe-to-toe against most classes when I have the correct demon, HS and ss.
---
But catch me without any demon, HS or SS and I'm dead to pretty much everything.
---
I didn't bother tracking the development or releases of bots for classic. But this one is a bot, and that's 100%.
---
Tank here. For us it’s the opposite; some healers never go oom and never get aggro, while others need 100% mana for every major pull, and require constant attention so that they don’t die. Dying bcs the healer is oom is probably the most common death for me, usually caused by a DPS accidentally pulling another group. Until I get a feel for how the healer and DPS function I play it safe - if I can I ramp up the speed.
---
As long as healers and DPS vary in quality, so will pulling speed.
---
Just give the warlocks salv 4head
---
I snatched a Pendulum of Doom off the AH for 49g... im thinking i will be able to flip it to 500+g at least
---
If we had unlimited mana, we'd heal you.  I try to heal my DPS when possible but if everyone is taking hits I'm going to focus on the tank.
---
I mean, china is prob going to get paid level 60 boosts in a few weeks lol.
---
Or maybe that's not how drop rates work and it's very possible that 9 guilds on the server got lucky and all got a drop. If I got that drop now I would sell it because the eye is so rare. Why hold onto them? And what alternative method are you proposing? Layering exploits didnt happen in raids.
---
once you get higher levels, you don't oom after 3 spells like you do at lvl 13.
---
We're all very proud of you.
---
It dropped on my first ZF run and I lost the roll by 2. Congrats!
---
Someone should make a Jojo Pillar Men Meme with Mages and Warlocks just to flex on this dickbag.
---
Nice. Think this is doable for another class or is stealth required to get past trash?
---
I'm gonna do you one even better. Literally just hit x on your keyboard and you'll sit.
---
On a server **Ashbriner**. derp\* :/
---
Yes it is.
---
What did you use to low level duel in d2 in terms of Class/skills?
---
I am also baffled
---
dungeons aren't hard enough to be concerned by the spec of your damage dealers as long as they aren't completely out-geared or dumb as a rock
---
He got ganked.
---
I am on Deviate Delight, have not seen any ingot even linked in /trade yet. 
---
Then again I don't often /afk in the city, but I do spend a decent amount of time in the city each time I play.
---
So you had bad rng and you are mad others had good RNG.
---
Hamstring* Since u get rage back if it fails.
---
What addon is that?
---
Mists*
---
One day you’ll be a dad gamer and you won’t like some snot nosed little shit calling you a dad gamer.
---
*LUL*
---
WELLL i am an undead lol
---
It really can throw off the pull from the tank perspective when others pull unannounced.  Please, please try communicating first?
---
ayyy benediction gang
---
I do communicate, its just over-explaining im against. Stopping to explain every pull is a waste of time, most pulls are tank and spank, few pulls have casters and sometimes there is a healer. Handling this is easy, this should never cause a wipe. What causes wipes most of the time is patrols or mobs who fear or other cc, communicating those things is enough.
---
Maybe we are misunderstanding each other and the communication you are talking about is "care patrol, pull mobs back" and if thats the case, im on your side. What i find pointless is explanations like "there are 4 mobs in this pull, two are melee and have an attack that does X damage, then there is one caster who cast shadowbolts and a ranged with a bow that sometimes slows you. Focus caster by pulling around corner while tank pick up melee. Healer should put Hots up on tank and dps with caster aggro. Dps make sure to CC ranged with bow and kill that last, also remember to run to me with aggro." Doing that every pull would kill me, even writing up that fictional scenario was painful.
---
I believe actual dungeon communication shall be short and sweet." cc moon, focus skull, interupt X" is enough. Give more time for bants and makes the run quick and easy.
---
If you are new to the game I expect you to tell me that at the start, but even if you dont ive played this game long enough to spot a beginner fairly quickly and Ill do my best to help out if thats the case.
---
Actually after playing with it, I think he just means it doesn't auto-target the npc. It will alert but not show you where to look.
---
I play a shaman and didn't know that it was possible. Had to go look for myself. I tested it and can confirm it does work.  
---

---
Holy shit did you miss the lottery point here ROFL 🤣
---
So you have two goals in classic while leveling:
---
1. Kill fast
---
2. Minimize downtime so you can keep killing fast 
---
Try both, and measure how long it takes you to kill the same mobs with both ways, and also pay attention to how many mobs you can kill before you have to bandage or eat with each way.
---
Whichever allows for better step 1 and step 2 is the winner.
---
That still has literally nothing to do with MC.
---
fyi tho command doesn't proc with reckoning while righteousness does. I've always enjoyed tanking and healing as 25/26, but obviously that's a bad dps spec

I swear I've heard decimated in my use before, I never knew it meant 1 out of 10.

No one is pissed at your comment, it just doesn’t make any sense. What difference does having multiple accounts make when it comes to his happiness in-game?
---
If you're Alliance and trying to play pacifistic on a PVP Server, please leave.  Signed, the Alliance.
---
Yep, that's it!
---
Lots of $ to be made from gold sales.

Yes! In WoW you are the hero of your own game. All NPCs talk to you as if *you are* the one to save Azeroth. All the other players are just other citizens in the game. We are all our own heroes.

Are battlegrounds out yet? What level do I need to be to access BG? If they are not out yet, any idea when WSG will be out?
---
Good to know how the alliance really feel
---
Welp, looks like it's a vendor then.
---
Curious about this as well. Interest in the prot affix ring,
---
Is this a hint that you are ready for TBC?
---
There’s a mob in badlands that doesn’t die unless you use a quest item on him. It’s the go to place to level any weapon skills.
---
They are not out yet. They won't be out until "Phase 3," which will likely be around 6 months from now. Level 10 is the minimum level, but you are better off waiting until level 19 so you are on the high end of the bracket and not getting crushed.
---
Just a tip: You don't need to buy all skills and upgrades. Just go with those you feel help with your levelling build and skip the rest. In addition, pickup Skinning + either Herbalism or Mining to gather materials along the way. Sell them for some profit on the AH. Once you're 60, keep one of the gathering professions and remove the other one in favour of a crafting profession.
---
imagine rolling a pvp server and not wanting to pvp, roll a pve server you fuckin idiot
---
It immediately cancels MC but it doesn't remove the buff. If you have built in unit frames you just might not be seeing it on their frame. However, watch their health pool increase and leave a chunk of missing life.
---
Or the wowhead data is wrong, which it is, and you nerds are trying to justify obvious exploitation.
---
Considering how many people are new to Classic, you shouldn't just assume that everyone knows every dungeon.
---
ur junky or what
---
Does buying exploited mats from others count?
---
I’d like to think Saurfang is translated as dinosaur fang
---
I have a sequence macro for my totems. Basically I spam one button 4 times to drop them all. If you have not already figured it out lemme know and I'll figure out a way to paste it in here.
---
All threat gone, if it isn't resisted
---
DUDE WEED
---
I second the other user's advice. If you spend most of your time soloing and you can group with a dependable party, stay fury. If you will be in dungeons most of the time anyway, go prot and get used to the new rotations.
---
At that point you should just delete and start over.  Itll take a good hour less than dying your way back to a reasonable spot
---
That's why you have the Spy addon.
---
Damn, your life is dull as shit.

Ganking isn't about a show of skill. Go play retail bgs with normalized stats if you want a "fair" fight.

It's not WF.

I had a skull level mage come and attack me while leveling. He got me to low health, froze me, /Lold me and then polyd me to full health and left with a /wave
---
Ah gotcha.
---
I'm on a PVP server as well, so goal #1 depends on the class I'm fighting.
---
Provide proof you could layer in raids or just leave.
---
Lol when you are in a raid you make them. You aint killing no raid boss in under 2 minutes
---
Hi, /u/Hepatitanic
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d7hsh9/if_profanity_filter_is_on_my_default_you_are/). 
---
I call this one the good ol’ nab&amp;stab
---
Nah I agree with him on alot of points here , as a new tank with a ton of game experience as healing/dps he isnt wrong. 
---
None of the dps wait for you to get any kind of threat up, and that's fine especially in instances like BRD or strat where I'm less a tank and more a peeler for whomever is doing the most aoe. But its when they bitch about it does it get infuriating. Like of course your going to get aggro "magikblaster", you just arcane explosiond the second I pulled. 
---
Simple communication solves most of these issues.
---
Where? Where were they awesome? ;)
---
i think classic aura durations does this
---
&gt; Most of the people doing these groups are the ones no one wants to play with in regular groups.
---
The only people who don't want to play with them are baddies who are mad that people aren't stuck in 2004.
---
Ita not my fault you are awful at explaining yourself. Go ahead. Explain yourself. And while you are at it link the proof you could layer in raids.
---
Rogues can pickpocket the kidney.
---
Depends how much you play lol 
---
I have 5 days 12 hours played on my classic mc. So I'd be at more than $12 by the end of the month
---
this guy gets it, and I am a mage.  the fastest way through EVERY instance is focus fire.
---
literally what i said.
---
I'm playing horde this time around,  but I rolled a dwarf hunter just to relive that first time experience.  Running up the hill to ironforge still gave me chills.
---
How do 65 classic servers compare to those currently existing for the rest of the world?
---
Shield block triggers revenge which is a consistent threat spike.
---
So make your own group.
---
There are multiple pugs a day clearing most bosses on my server. Not including guilds.
---
You’re forgetting that classic raids are a face roll, minmaxing dps isn’t important yet. You shouldn’t have any issues getting into raids imo
---
I'll post it on your mother's fridge instead next time I come over. If she asks, I left the money for last time on her nightstand.

Ask Blizzard, since they're the ones investigating the issue.

Yeah and i’m telling you I actively have been searching for them. There is a forum called OwnedCore that is the hub for all that stuff and a public bot does not exist..
---
If he’s botting the man made the program entirely himself which is impressive.
---
Well not all of them look like a skull after I bash their head in with [Execute!]
---
What exploit? You could never layer in raids. Prove it if you have information to the contrary.
---
YUH!!
---
I've tanked every dungeon and I can't wait until I'm done with pugs and my friends catch up. The current zoomer retail meta is disgustingly annoying.
---
Soon he said, should he type it louder?
---
So you have no idea what you are on about aye. Sad.
---
Not being pedantic gets you silly definitions of cleave.
---
They can stunlock you for 10 literal seconds killing anything that is not extremely geared
---
Also great at 1v2 with the amount of CC
---
People shitting on your post and calling it cringe are the real cringe. It's just a silly comic, people. Get over yourselves.
---
To be fair to wow tho maps are hard to do. Try searching for Mercator or authagraph. The latter being pretty mind-blowing if you've never seen it!
---
ganking lowbies in STV, what else?
---
I also suppose it has to do with the healing surge talent in The resto tree!
---
Still a layering joke
---
You just made us watch this long ass video without a single comment on what the fuck is your problem. Go suck a dick
---
I remember specifically a human rogue named Susan on Spinebreaker US that was ALWAYS in Silithus and was a known gold farmer. 
---
You could whisper her "ni hao" and she would respond in chinese, even dueled people from time to time while farming.  while i know that technically interrupts her farming, it also added some human nature to it
---
That's the thing I'm most excited for with phase two. I grinded the wolf back in TBC with pre-mades (best part is then you have the upper hand in AV) and it's probably the most fun rep grind there is. Going to be even easier with no cross-realm BGs and everyone having discord instead of people being split between using ventrilo and teamspeak.
---
I got downvoted into oblivion for bringing this up.
---
Like the murloks "bring proof of killing them by collecting their heads" 100 murloks later, "Sweet that makes 20!"
---
Honestly though, I'm grinding anyways, the quest is just icing.
---
If you say so.
---
Now that’s a good film adaption of a video game. Overly campy but still true to the genre. Kind of like street fighter.
---
&gt; I'm also skeptical of the 60k number. Are you pulling that out of your ass? That sounds accurate for junior game devs, but I don't believe that is the average salary for devs at Blizzard. 
---
Game designers are more around 80k according to what I've seen at blizzard however the region its in is extremely expensive heavily taxed and alot of their compensation is in "benefits" AKA how you scam retards into being paid less, source I employ people. Honestly 60k might even be too high of an estimation for the real value of it.
---
&gt;  This is absolutely scummy and I'm not going to defend Blizzard or any game studio for this practice, 
---
I don't know any legitimately good programmer who would work for these salaries, no one can force you to work for less than your worth. If your an actually talented programmer you could go make $450,000 a year working for a defense contractor or you could go make $300,000 at google or you could go make $80,000 at blizzard in California where your real value is like $40k a year after the insane taxes and cost of living
---
&gt;  target them for being "lazy" when they should be criticizing the business. 
---
Most programmers are horrible at their jobs. The top 10% of coders are 100x more productive than the bottom 90%
---
Dungeons not raids.
---
Hunters
---
Especially if you go back to enhance for some PvP “oh cool I get to level my 2h Axes again” *miss* *miss* *dodge* 1 *miss*
---
That's a bug, it's referencing Retail functions that shouldn't be possible.
---
I found a friend in the canals of stormwind fishing today. We just both leveled up to 150 just there.
---
Looks like you are the apocalypse.
---
Sad is taking a quote from blizzard about a specific issue and applying it to this case, for a failed "world first" which was beaten 2 days prior by the Chinese. 
---
Sad is looking at Wowhead loot tables for a whole 56 encounters from 10 years ago, which hasn't been updated, and assuming there' s a 33% chance to drop off of one boss, when its smaller than t hat, and drops off of two bosses. 
---
Even more sad, is continuing this discussion because you want the last word, so have at it, Frowny.

Shadowpriests are pretty nutty too. We can 1v1 basically anybody.

because they're not interchangeable terms lmao.  but go ahead and keep sounding strange it's okay

Or there is one not released for the general populace.

Or there is one which not even them know of.

I have seen hundreds of bots back in vanilla, and this one is a bot, and it is not disputable.

I have some who began in mop and one who is completely new to the game.
---
People don't play casters to enjoy raiding. Raiding is litearlly 4-8 hours a week, that's all. Everything outside of raids is what counts. And feral is shit in the world too have have to sit and farm consumes way more.
---
I kinda wished they future-proofed that original map a bit. Having areas that you couldn't access, like Hyjal, Gilneas, and Quel'thalas, still appear on the map, gave the game so much more weight and feeling of depth.
---
I'm pretty sure at least one of those islands in the classic map is supposed to be Zandalar, and another is supposed to be either Kezan or the Broken Isles, but I do always wonder why Northerend or Kul Tiras weren't on that classic map, seeing as they 1000% existed in the lore before their relevant expansions. Just imagine how different the expansions would feel if they were ALL in the vein of Cataclysm, as in you're exploring areas you've always been able to see, but never touch, up until now.
---
I get so many salty PM's
---
Yes I am an aoe mage, dont be upset at me because I enjoy my class kit. I use my abilities to steadily supply my goodies. Hell I give away boe blues because they arent worth auctioning.
---
&gt;DPS job is to do damage. if he does so much damage that he keeps pulling mobs from tank then tank is either undergeared or shit tier player
---
This is the dumbest post I've read today, have you done strat, brd, or any endgame dungeon? There is no such thing as a tank for 75% of pulls in there. You are at most a pealer for whomever is doing the most aoe. Dps will always pull mobs off tank, it's the tanks job to mitigate the amount of damage the group takes. Make sure the big hitters are aggrod and let the dps take care of the rest, otherwise every pull will take 15 minutes. 
---
Im not even gonna comment on the rest of the post but damn, you are an idiot if you play with this mindset.
---
Quick advice, it's best to use your bandages first while bubbled so you have mana to spare afterwards.
---
There are two kinds of people. Those that think they are good against everything, and those who think they are bad against everything.
---
you sir, will end up finding zero groups. opening combat puts you on the top of every mobs threat list and makes your tanks job MUCH harder, not to mention your own.
---
Why did I think it was a good idea to come into this comment section?
---
It's not though.
---
and again you are ignoring how that's a screenshot of him standing over bodies, not him fighting from that position, which he denies ever doing. which has been my whole point all along.
---
Yeah there were plenty of public bots going around until the Honorbuddy lawsuit. They are much more sparse nowadays! 
---
Think what you want, the odds of it being a bot is near zero. 
---

Of the comments you keep commenting on, pick one to continue your argument in, I'm not going to bounce back and forth between comments to answer you nonsense.

This 100%.

Sad is not being able to read usernames. Sad is arguing for hours while being unable to provide proof for your point at all.
---
It also gives another way to transfer large amounts of gold and create gold through AH investment and transfer. We used to buy high supply ah materials long ago and transfer to servers with low supply and make huge profits.
---
The xfer servers are supposed to be more restricted in terms of economy but as soon as people have enough gold and the option to transfer at will they kill markets and the whole point of a xfer fresh server with char creation disabled is to preserve the economy.
---
There's good and dumb reasons but we killed an xfer server with enchanting mats and enough gold to control the AH market for long term so it's the point I know best. 
---
Personally I would like to see less restricted transfers. Our group split up on launch because Herod was full along with most and not even half the guild transferred. Those who stayed a lot quit. Those who transfered are not logging in since their friends didn't all xfer. If there is an option ever for multiple launch servers to xfer to the same place we will take it.... And of course make as much gold as possible.

&gt; Try get into a grp as anything other then a warlock or mage as a dps then get back to us

Imagine saying he seems like the salty one and then saying this LOL

And what about last week? And the week prior?

Because that wasn't the case on the top servers two weeks ago. The point that this highly improbable, if not impossible, has eluded you apparently.

Looks like it can technically be unpacked but you’d need to reverse-engineer the encryption Blizzard uses so not really. You’d just see a shitty QR Code that means nothing without Blizz’ masterkey.

&gt;When you start casting a spell
---
It's when you finish casting a spell, not start casting it.

It might not change something for some classes, but in others you can regain mana by timing the end of your cast just after a tick, which can help
---
What VPN? I use nord and always sign in through it. Never an issue.

They seemed to have fun in TBC.

My character was stuck and I guess response time was low back then because a GM responded before my hearthstone was off cool down. He/she shot me into the air and when I landed in a tree popped up next to me as an ogre.

As somebody that has always played Horde and is now playing Alliance on Classic, I have to say that the thing I have enjoyed the most is definetely the dwarf zones. And also the storytelling in the quests.
---
Considering war is just a state of the relationship between two groups of people? You can't have war without people.
---
It is very disputable. Like this:
---
I don't think he's a bot and you have no evidence
---
Disputed, and currently I'm correct since you have no proof whatsoever.
---
&gt; It's a matter of adaptation.
---
I agree completely. The people who are playing this game like it's still 2004 need to adapt.
---
The INSTANT the first pack goes down, I'm drinking.  I'm not getting up until I'm at 3/4 mana at least (if I like you).  Or full if I don't.
---
Even in PvP servers Alliance players can't be attacked in Alliance areas, unless you attack a Horde player first, and other way around.
---
Do the Chinese players still get scourge models replaced with pieces of bread?
---
&gt;I just feel like a wanderer in the void
---
and that's what you are! you're a mage after all... you sacrifice something for this great power.
---
Its in the comments, guy. The guy who supposedly made it didn't even know how many ingots he really needed when telling his fabricated story here on reddit lol.
---
Actually no. It is also your job to set the pace of the dungeon
---
Yikes. Seek mental jelp.
---
I get this
---
If it's not in our records then it doesn't exist
---
Took me a long time to get this down when I started playing lmao. I used to have to Google it
---
Can you perhaps help me find some mental jelp?
---
Yup, wait until Bags drop and find someone who is working on an Enh Shaman 39 twink, they will pay huge money for that big dick damage for their Windfury.
---
Even for long PvP match is good to have an extra Mana source
---
Ya I don't know, I'd put myself in the upper band of classic tanks and there's a lot of dps that have zero concept of classic aggro. The meta has become this bizzare cleave snap aoe damage blitz to the end. I've seen skull die last far too many times in far too many groups. It's generally a dps problem. I even find myself with mocking taunt and cs on cooldown constantly. I've held off on engineering for now to maximize gold but it's borderline mandatory for this meta of zoomers.
---
While you're at it why dont you tell us the exact number of raids on MC on firemaw since classic release? You clearly must know according to your comments. Otherwise how could you state that there weren't 15 guilds raiding MC this week? Please enlighten the rest of us.
---
Holy spec is actually decent for leveling. Before lvl 40 you don't get shadowform anyway and there are some nice damage talents in holy.
---
You should get Wand Spec from Disc and Spirit Tap frm Shadow though.
---
That's a strange choice of deflection. You argued something that is demonstrably inaccurate, and so I've provided proof otherwise.
---
i giggled like a child on chtistmas, just reading this short tale of events. for you i feel sorry that you don't enjoy the game as much as I do I guess and for op I am thankfull! awesome thing to do guys!

That's something that I really loved about Guild Wars 1 - all terrain would break LoS, and bows even had ballistic arcs and different speeds so you could dodge arrows if you were quick enough.
---
[I'll allow it.](i.imgur.com/dVDJiez.gif)
---
Only hemo will hit harder. Evis isnt based on weapon damage. I think it is situational. I think it depends on what level you are and what talents you have. If you have the 45% ambush crit and remorseless buff active from assassination it's worth. If you have the dirty deeds talent then cheap shot has a lot of value though too. Garrote can be used without a dagger so that is a damage option from stealth if your dagger isn't great or if you dont have the ambush talents. 
---
One of the fun things in classic is that you can just test it out. Try both ways and see which way kills the mob faster. If they kill at the same speed, see which leaves you with the most health. You can make your own judgements since the answers are pretty easy to conclude on your own.
---
Can confirm. Am guildmaster of Monty Python - Mirage Raceway EU
---
Every day, we bravely run away.
---
I have both of those.  Actually don't have Shadowform yet because I put those 5 points into wand spec.  I'll get it within a couple levels.
---
Its just a name. Christ.
---
Don't worry about it, you'll get a raid spot at the very least purely because you understand how to play. Selection might have been class dependant early on, but not at this point since release as guilds are raiding with better gear.
---
This has literally always been the case, it's still true today (although obsolete).

Russia and China are the only regions where PvP is more popular.

If you are running out of all your mana after each pull, you need to start using all your lower rank heals. They are more mana efficient, and you can constantly spam them and barely feel a dent in your mana.
---
Players are shitty

You are correct, 5 second rule starts when mana is actually spent. Thanks for the correction.

Sometimes I accidentally heal my totems with my mouseover heal macros. Is there any macro conditional that can exclude my totems from the macro's target? Or will I just have to be more careful about my mouse placement?

yep, that is exactly where i burned out trying to grind while keeping a job and some sort of sleep (usually 4 hrs a night) before i got burned out, i think its a fairly common story lol

Have you ever thought that they were just bad?

You can edit your own comments

Beutifull. Lol

tbh, I enjoy classic for the exact opposite reason.
---
In modern WoW, we really are the all-powerful, God-Like Heroes of Destiny. We wielded the most powerful weapons the planet has seen, can cast down scores of enemies like they were made of paper, and are personal friends of the most powerful beings in the world.
---
In classic, even at 60, you're a cog in the machine. A foot soldier or another mage in the ranks. We can achieve some measure of greatness, no doubt, but we're still just adventurers trying to make our way, and not the Mighty Lords who cast down multiple Titans and personally defeated the leaders of the Burning Legion.
---
To expand upon this:  I played Night Elf in actual Vanilla. I remember roaming about the Feathermoon Stronghold, in reverence of how cool a place it was, trying to learn about this mystical Shandris Feathermoon for whom the place is named.
---
In BFA, I send Shandris out for coffee each morning from my Facebook table, and tip her a couple  of gold if she remembers the extra creamer.

genZ'ers (zoomers) call anyone older than genZ boomer bc its a funny word for old people, including milennials

the joke being that milennials arent THAT out of touch
---
I definitely ran into a bot killing undead in the Darkshore graveyard. It was incredibly obvious with it's immediately pathing to the closest mob whether it was tagged or not, getting stuck on objects and backing up to path around, etc.
---
I'm 100% sure it was not a person.
---
Every post about tanks wanting to slow things down is so lame-- stop living in 2005, just tank with ravager and spam whirlwind in berserker stance... I have no problems holding aggro and topping the dps meters like that... and if you're tanking pre-ravager everything should be easy enough it doesn't matter if dps or heals gets a little aggro
---
i still don't get it, that people asking simple questions on this subreddit are being downvoted. not everyone is a returning player, some of us never played classic or wow alltogether. try and keep that in mind.
---
Elemental shammy shits on sp
---
Yup how fun. As a feral its such a fun time. No interrupt, sitting the full fear and running at high speed all around aggroing some mobs on you. 10/10 fun would duel again. At least I keep one shotting them after they eat after lifetapping...
---
Here's an addon that fades that button unless u mouse over.
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/dejaprfader
---
Alright, now let's see.
---
There is a lvl 56 that doesn't mount ever. They wear only greens and greys. They are doing the same circle for hours. (Tar Lords in Un'Goro, a popular botting spot even back in 2005) They will die if another mob spawns near them while they are engaged (without using their fake death spell?) They will never regen mana by drinking and engage everything with as low as they have regened by mp5. They will not move in any way that shows "right click + wheeling your mouse to a side". Instead, they will get to a spot, stop and then immediately make a sharp side turn. They will send their pet in, but if you manage to tag a minion before they do, they will proceed killing it. Not only that but after they killed a mob, they will get to its corpse, before proceeding further (in a futile attempt to loot it).
---
Give me a reasonable explanation for this behavior (and do explain their items on lvl 56) which disproves it is a bot.
---
Fuck. I've prolly sold 50 stacks of silk to vendor. Well now I know. Thanks for the comment.
---
Something, something, Cataclysm.
---
For world first rag? That's nothing.
---
I'm up for it
---
Don't be afraid to suggest it's bugged. So much is that I wouldn't be surprised that this is another one.
---
This was me as well and it took until nearly t6 in tbc for my guild to finally get the fury prot stuff because I just snuck it in and they didn’t notice. Then I came out and showed them. I spent 1000s of gold on respecs by then. One great thing about classic is that people spent so much time on private servers that they learned how wrong they were when it came to deep prot vs fury/prot.
---
Maybe you are talking about end game or something. I'm level 37 and have done almost all the instances multiple times on the way. I haven't encountered even 1 healer I would consider "awful". They have like 3 spells it's not hard.
---
Alright, just think about this logically.
---
If your white damage and poisons are a majority of your damage (which they are, for every rogue, this isn't an argument). We can even say that auto-attacks and poisons make up 50% of your damage, SS takes 15%, Evis/Rupture/other finishers take up 35%. These are very conservative numbers because I've been away from the game for a few days and I'm trying to be fair in my argument.
---
One combo point spent on Eviscerate is going to offer a relatively marginal increase to that 35% of your damage. This is leaving out the possibility of miss/parry/dodge that is inherent in Eviscerate and other finishers. 
---
On the other hand, even ONE combo point spent on SnD is going to offer a dependable, 20% increase on that 50% of your damage. It will never miss. It is the cheapest finisher in terms of energy cost. You will ALWAYS increase that BIGGEST part of your damage by HUGE amount for the SMALLEST POSSIBLE investment.
---
To go further, you have already made my argument for me -- You always keep it up in instances. Why? Because it is the best increase overall to your damage. If you know this to be true in groups, then you should know it to be true solo. 
---
I acknowledge that there are edge cases when you might get a crit with eviscerate and that might FEEL like it's more effective than SnD. In that tiny edge case it might even have been! But you shouldn't craft your entire rotation/understanding around edge cases. 
---
Just because you're soloing, nothing changes about the nature of your damage. Fights may not last as long (even though 90% of the time you will get full benefit off of a one to two combo point SnD), but you can carry that SnD over to the next mob.
---
I don't know how else to restate my points. It is the smallest cost finisher, with the greatest impact on your overall damage. It is stupid easy to keep up. You are a bad rogue if you don't use SnD all the time.
---
For sure, I used to (still have) a 19 rogue fully geared with arena Grand Master fishing hat , shadowfang assasins blade 2 cruel Barb's feet of lynx etc with all bis enchants on retail ... And nothing is as amazing as finishing a wsg with 30+ kill streaks while holding the flag and camping the other team... 
---
Twinks were ruined imo on retail with stat squishes , enchant changes and general gear changes but they were so fun to just roll the other team .. especially having myself and my friend have twin rogues that we would just destroy.
---
Alright I misunderstood then.  I thought you were trying to negate his anecdote by implying it couldn't have happened during BC.
---
Sad is driving on the highway and not going through everything you just mentioned to ultimately wind up at the same point, which is that you refuse to believe someone bent the rules in the game just enough to get world 2nd?
---
Well the broken isles and zandalar are on both maps. Kul Tiras was supposed to be in bay between Gilneas and the Wetlands but they made that part to small in the game to fit it in.
---
Ha!  Classic.
---
Like I stated before - zero public bots avaliable atm for anything other then fishing. I’d know because I used to do it in Vanilla and it intrigued me..
---
I used bots all the way up until a banwave in WoD were I got a 2 year ban lol. When MMOGlider got sued not much changed, when Honorbuddy got sued suddenly bots became less public. Warden got drastically improved and from my understanding you barely see bots in Modern WoW anymore. 
---
When Honorbuddy got shut down suddenly BG’s didn’t have those shitty groups of bots following horrible pathing.
---
Now they still have Rotation bots - ones that execute a perfect DPS rotation, but no Questing / Grind / PvP versions.
---
So as OP said they definitely existed in Vanilla but they are much rarer nowadays for legal reasons.
---
Where was the Blind? :(
---
5 points in Spirit Tap, 5 points in wand spec, then whatever strikes your fancy for everything else. If you fancy going shadow spec, wait until lvl 42, you'll get Shadowform and 3rd level of mindflay at which point it starts being more damage. also try to get a shadow damage wand (a wand that actually does shadow damage, not a "of shadow wrath" wand), some of the shadow talents boost the shadow wand damage.
---
Lol this is why I love classic
---
Why gorilla's over basilisks? Genuinely curious.

Here’s (some of) my mapping:
---
```
---
X | 1
---
Y | 2
---
Lb | 3
---
Rb | 4
---
Left touchpad | 6-0, -, and = (it emulates 7 buttons by touching different regions) 
---
Left grip | Shift
---
Right grip | Ctrl
---
(This is the key. These buttons quadruple the number of abilities I can use with my controller: no mod, ctrl, shift, shift+ctrl)
---
Right touchpad | mouse (gyro also moves the mouse for fine motions)
---
Left thumbstick | WASD
---
Triggers | mouse buttons 
---
I like to think everything after cata is an alternate timeline lore wise.
---
I mean nightfall is just not going to be good on an enh shaman. Sure you can try to use it as a reason to justify your raid spot but any guild that knows what they are doing is going to slap that on a warrior who has far more consistent uptime. You just don’t have the same tools to keep the uptime like a hamstring warrior does.
---
I got a Bnet invite last week. When I accepted I was promptly called a no-lifer for ganking people in Stromgarde. Now I know how the little crybaby was able to add me lol.
---
This is a great example of people wasting their time
---
It’s a preference, there are 10x+ R1 players that have theirs zoomed all the way in
---
41 mage, I've had nothing but great groups for AOE/spell cleave. Occasionally need to explain it to one of the mages, but it's been great and way faster than normal runs, which I've done as well.
---
It was just as an example.
---
But looking at something like Skullflame, then it's 64% H, 36% A, which is probably the worst.
---
You're right, this was apparently fixed near the end of the beta.
---
Troll confirmed
---
Bah, Barrens is better.
---
Dogg ain't even good he just got with the right people tbh
---
If you tell us the actual name of it people will be able to give you a better idea. Generally things aren't selling super high at the moment though as no-one has the gold to pay for them. If you're in no rush waiting a couple of months would probably increase your profits substantially

I wasn’t being pedantic, he’s horde and I wasn’t sure if he knew there isn’t one in there in classic so I was letting him know. Didnt see him say BY 1k. Don’t be a dick
---
Swore I wouldnt go warrior again like I did 14 years ago.  Got a job, wife and a kid... no way. Hunter main....Got my hunter to 27... 
---
Warrior hit 33 a few minutes ago. Got my whirlwind axe. Having a blast. (I want a spriest bad to)
---
Easy get a second account and dual box two locks
---
5 man strath and scholo groups are mainly for well geared level 60s. I’d say at least a full pre BiS to do on your healer and tank. Otherwise the best way is to 10 man
---
This is a classic case of over-interpreting stuff.
---
Man, he really got to you eh?
---
Feral is one of if not THE best world pvp class, and pvp class in general.
---
Facing a warrior? blend bear and caster form together for fat deeps, roots, stun, and dots.
---
Facing a rogue? Sorry no stealth for you, also dotted, I am hotted and am in bear form, good luck taking me out with my armor and health.
---
Facing a mage? sorry no roots or slows for you, stunned, dotted, dead.
---
ect.
---
Just because you don't like a class does not mean no one else can or that it sucks.
---
Personally I think playing Enhancement Shaman is like roulette and doing good pve damage or winning a pvp fight based entirely on luck to be dumb and not fun.
---
HOWEVER! I can understand how others may find it fun and I don't go around talking shit about it because I am not an ignorant person.

Please link 3 examples of the question being answered please, thanks.

Still gonna be newbs to stomp.
---
What do you mean? Lol... Leveling in Classic is like 200 hours and then you're done forever. It took me 2 weeks to nolife 60 and now that's that for leveling. People overhype it so much because of nostalgia goggles when it took kids 2 years to max.
---
And you can't sustain yourself through leveling only if you want any meaningful items like the Epic mount or other expensive shit.
---
Yes, he is.
---
"You see, the DISHCONARY DEFNOITION says X so that means it has to always be X and the meaning can never change depending on how the usage evolves."
---
Alright, I am uploading a video of it, and I am making a new post. Do you want me to tag you?
---
WoW is quite different in China (retail st least) For example, when you die &amp; leave a little Skelton, it's a tombstone instead. Or Undead, have almost all gore removed &amp; bones covered
---
You...couldn't infer from context? Like I understand the pedantic twats complaining about what "cleave" actually means, but did you actually not understand that "spellcleave" is a group of casters doing AOE damage?
---
Oh I see. Thanks for the reply.
---
Exactly, clout isn't slang. Thank you!
---
A large part of no druid DPS was druids dps being DoT based partially. And with the cap on debuffs/dots they were not invited as much.
---
What people don't remember is that back then people SUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCKED at the game.
---
If some random feral classic druid from today went back in time to vanilla they would probably be close to if not topping DPS charts in raids.
---
The majority of people back they back peddled to move away from bad things, stood in bad things (more so than today) and were too bad at the game to click a fucking object that a priest summons for a free heal.
---
Lolollll so petty
---
Awesome thanks!
---
To some people. Again, we come back to why do you care how other people get enjoyment from the game when it doesn’t affect you in any way?
---
I wish to notify people of their reemergence. 
---
Also, I reported them already.
---
My mistake I just remember spell hit being a thing   years back
---
Can rogues disable them?
---
Against terms isnt it?
---
you'll kill everything as any spec, what matters is your efficiency in doing so. if you're having to drink after every 3 mobs even though you're killing them twice as fast, you're not gonna be faster than my disc priest shielding up and wanding stuff down with zero downtime. but honestly just play what seems more fun, that's what's important!
---
LOL that guy is scared AF now, a  reddit post has been made about him.. yikes!! 👀
---
Love this post, makes people think. 
---
Here’s my opinion, I think you have a huge community divide of people who want something fun and easy to play casually  (retail) and those who seek challenges, rewards, and superiority. Reflection of effort is what classic is about as well as community progress. I’d like to see new content that honors those values and I think generally speaking these are what most classic players are after. We want to put countless hours into game play so we can flex what we’ve achieved with that time. We want to walk into SW or IF and have people who can’t / won’t invest that much time go “whoa! Look at this guy” That goes for raid progress and PvP. Some people enjoy the lore and the story and slow progress associated with leveling in classic and that’s okay too. I think mostly what this community wants is something new that honors those core values established in vanilla and most of us would be happy with however they chose to accomplish that.
---
Just buy unicorn band and pair with eye of orgrimmar, this ring isnt that good
---
Well the real difference between 2004 and now is knowledge. Back in 2004 I was a 14 year old scrub that didn’t know about keybinding or extra action bars in the interface menu lol it was my first mmorpg after all.
---
After playing WoW and other mmos for years now, you just know exactly what you need to do and how to do it easily. It’s not that the game got easier, it’s just that you got immensely better at playing it.
---
The issue is how many pages of single stack items you have to go through to find something of reasonable price
---
This one works! thanks! Any chance you know of a way to make an icon next to minimap for it?

Not many people know about it so you can't blame yourself really.

It does take a measure of time to make them but it's easy free money.

Of course, thanks for the advice.

Might respec to Holy at 60 but I'll stick with Shadow for now since I've made it this far.

They have ranged but they are standing in areas where they can hit players but the guards range can't.

As a new WoW player playing paladin. Please explain the  moves you did at the end to wreck him

That is in fact the reason to play PVP Twinks.

I'm afk a lot, I can take advantage of that time. I'ma start doing this. I'm still grinding for my 40 mount.
---
G sheh!
---
Threat Plates
---
&gt; There has to be another guild or two on their server at least to golemagg 
---
any group of 30 people 58+ who own keyboards are "at least to golemagg" if they choose to be.
---
There was a blue post in 2005 about this. So this isnt an artificial ruling it's been decided since then.
---
That's the only thing most rogues know how to do. They never evolve beyond the "lol" stage.
---
If you mean the ability to cleave targets, yes. But that isn't what is inferred when talking melee cleave arena teams.
---
You're gonna have to be in leather to be the best dps there is, so warriors will be needing a lot of rogue gear. Most noteably, the "Mask of the Unforgiven" from strat (leather head), and "Truestrike Shoulders" from UBRS.
---
Found the rogue that tried to gank you.
---
What is dead may never die. He’s an Iron Gnome.
---
I'm not sure if it's possible (you could try using the conditional "group" to restrict the heal to targets in your party or raid but I'm not at my PC so I can't test it)
---
But with mouseover macros, you can mouse over party frames or raid frames to heal, you don't have to mouse over the actual model of the player you want to heal. Should make mouseover healing your totems on accident a lot less common.
---
Did you guys ask him if he had a wife or kids

Essentially most geographical inconsistencies from retcons are blamed on the Cataclysm. Kul Tiras moving such a long way is probably the biggest suspension of disbelief lol

Hi, /u/Carrera992

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d7ia8a/are_they_going_to_do_the_regular_patches_for/). 
---
Tank should be marking at least one Target no doubt, it can be hotkeyed and takes about no time at all.
---
If they don't, just go with the mob they pulled. As in the first faerie fire or the mob they pulled with a gun etc. If you pull aggro switch to another mob that's been sundered/FF'd. But honestly just ask the tank to mark or do it yourself. I've had nights where I was tired and forgot to mark a couple pulls so sometime else in the group did it for me and reminded me! No offense should be taken honestly.
---
I'm not sure you know what a boomer even is. Maybe you should stop using that term, because you sound just as stupid as everyone else using it.
---
I saw pvp happen in this video. What were you watching?
---
As a shaman, I feel like warlock is a fairly easy match up.
---
wtf is a spellcleave?
---
best possible gear for a level x9 to crush people in battle grounds
---
As a healer I completely disagree with this
---
So is literally everyone else who wants to be even remotely efficient.
---
I am an enha shaman, it is a pain. Sure some groups might take me for windfury totem. But 95% of the groups either wants me for heals or I can fuck off elsewhere...
---
I really dislike how heavily focused every group is on "cleave" setups at the moment.
---
Yeah you have no idea how many times so far as a tank I've had dps aoe almost immediately after pull and the  get chomped because one tclap isnt enough. And I always preface instances like strat with the fact I can't hold aoe threat perfectly. It's really not as bad as I'm making it sound, maybe one in ten dps bitch about pulling aggro then quickly get yelled at by the healer and other dps but it's still infuriating.
---
Peggle time
---
At the same time there were wandering pandarians because one is in durotar during the founding of the nation. No one really knew where they came from.
---
I’m playing WoW for the first time other than private servers. Have a gnome mage up to level 42 and started an Orc shaman to see the other side. So far I’m really not liking the horde zones. They’re just so empty and big. Thinking I might go alliance again for my second alt.
---
Fuck that shit
---
Do you have any idea what boomer even means?
---
Sorry, but if you'd have seen it I'm sure you'd agree. It's not just the movements, it's the decisions around where and when to move.
---
100% a bot.
---
&gt;yall have abilities to lesson threat but literally dont want to use them.
---
Cries in warlock.
---
Really good Warlocks are hard to beat but there's not thaaaat many of them.  
---
Warlocks rely on set up or ramp up and I went full glass cannon, so I (UD Mage) can delete a lot of them before they become a hassle. Ofc UD has a big advantage.  
---
But yeah, they can scale into tanks that shit out damage later on, still, if you can delete them before they one trick pony / whittle you down, you're golden, Warlocks are kinda unwieldy but have big guns.  
---
Worst case, just walk away, they can't really do anything against it.
---
At level 30 you want the Outlaw Sabre from BFD quest or Electricutioner's Leg from Gnomer. Sword of Omen will be a great upgrade in the mid-late 30s and Vanquisher's Sword around level 40.
---
Who says I'm not?
---
Did you actually type this and press enter.
---
Yeah, here we were grinding 4hrs a night while some no-lifer and his brother are taking turns to grind 24/7 non-stop.
---
Thinking about switching to resto (lvl 26 enh) to do dungeons more easily. But also be able to grind mobs/do quests. Is it viable? (I have some alright gear for resto)
---
A preference that, regardless of who has what, still doesn't let you see around you. It's just a disadvantage for no reason.
---
With that said I've not seen anyone who actually plays zoomed in that far or more. Who does? I'm actually curious!

Someone too old to have heard anyone use the word clout? What do you think it means?

We used to go to Red Ridge to do this in the lake.  Also for supreme shits and giggles, mind control people on boats and drop them in the middle of the ocean before zoning.
---
And it begins!
---
Really? I never knew that. I suppose that makes sense, especially given that horde only have two 10-20 zones as opposed to Alliance which has 3.
---
Smug people are always looking for a new buzzwords that automatically dismiss everything they dislike because they abuse them so much and so predictably that people start associating that word with their bullshit.
---
In a couple of months it'll be put in the recycling bin alongside "Oof" "woof" "Are you okay?" "cringe" "seethe" "cope" "yikes" "umadbro?" and other such soiled phrases.
---
What UI addon is that?
---
No you just sound rational. It only takes a few bad apples to really destroy the social aspect in a guild, and if the base isn't strong already, the base will never form.
---
Classic good, Retail bad Upvotes to the left.
---
I have made [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d7hiip/reddit_met_a_bot_this_is_helixi_eu_ashbriner/) about a very fishy 'player' behavior that I have just encountered. 
---
After being told (off) how there are no bots for Classic WoW, I decided to make a video and upload it, so you can be the judges yourselves. 
---
Also, I have already reported them via in-game methods, and this post serves just as a proof of botting reemergence in WoW classic.
---
I don't understand how these people think it wasn't a thing, lol
---
Being a complete asshole = dressing up as a video character from another game and yelling one word? I play both League and WoW and can safely say that if someone showed up at a League even dressed like an orc peon and yelled "zug zug" it would be mostly met with confused looks. Not violence.

Okay let's not get carried away here. You make it sound like he did something really bad.
---
In reality he just PvPed, but avoided NPCs getting aggroed via a bug.
---
No please lol

You can also get an add on called Leatrix plus which makes every spell dismount you if you enable it as an option. Saves you making macros for every spell :)

Damned bourgeois.

A national amusement park center? Nah man

---
Ehhhh feral druid rotation in classic at 60 has 0 dots, its literally just shred spam and ferocious bite. swap shred for claw when you cant be behind. Its really just a numbers thing and the fact that rogues get 2 AP for agility, and feral druids get 1 is really the main factor. Druids get 2 AP from str but str doesnt add to crit so :(
---
It's just trade between players, it's not buying gold for real money.
---
So shouldn't be. Pretty sure there is no issue with it.
---
Another reason I don't like modern WoW. It feels like Zandalar, Kul Tiras and the Broken Isles were blatantly shoehorned in while the Maelstrom got pushed back further and further west.
---
All cleave is aoe but not all aoe is cleave :P
---
Big grats from a fellow Incendius alliance rogue!
---
tht's pretty scummy.
---
And that's when he said "You no take candle!"
---
Or you could just mind control him 100000 times in a row. There is no diminishing returns on it. 
---
Friend of mine was mindcontrolled for an hour straight a while ago. It would log his character off even if he alt f4 the game and left. He was still in game, 20 minutes later, under mindcontrol despite him not even beinf online.
---
So does it matter less if I'm using mage armor?
---
From what I've read, shadow is quite lackluster before lv 40 and disc supposedly does better because wand is life.
---
Bene boys represent!
---
I be interested to see what they change lore wise. I imagine wotlk would be hugely problematic. Love to see how they rewrite a all powerful Lich that bring back the dead and enslaves them.
---
Dungeons were nerfed tho (respawn timers lengthened, mobs nerfed or removed), gear was added (were there was none) and stats on gear were changed to make them more appealing.
---
Every class got rebalanced between 1.6 and 1.11. 
---
Healing spells had their mana costs reduced and their healing buffed, half the mage aoe was fixed because up until 1.7 you couldnt use certain aoes on certain mob types.  The whole aoe grinding was impossible due to mobs that were immune to slowing/cc/freezing effects also being immune to the damage of the ability. So aoeing didnt work as intended.
---
Im not certain but I think it might be Luna Unit frames.
---
I think OP has it looking really good too, all the important information is nicely centralized. Im gonna need to try and replicate it with my UI.
---
One on one, it's a hard match up for most classes.  It highly depends on cooldowns and which pet is out.  In groups, warlocks are better and worse.  Pets die really easily when focused but target rich environment for dots.
---
Unfortunately.
---
There is no proof in the comments that you could layer raids. Provide it or fuck off.
---
Are you fucking stupid enough to have fucked up a let me google that for you link? Sounds like that's what just happened.

Anyway, a boomer is someone born between '46 and 64'. Anyway, sounds like you really are as dumb as I thought when I saw your first comment. My b...

low level dungeons are viable without having talents at all
---
Press the rarity tab and you get x20 stacks at top.
---
on Ashbringer? Last night in STV it was a 46, 49, 51 Alliance trio killing any hordies on sight lol and another 5 man group camping the south Raptors near Tethis out
---
Na I get the chances are somewhat low but you are vastly exaggerating it without providing an alternative.
---
The amount of overall damage you take doesn't matter, that's why they dot you. What can break you out of fear are big hits. Shadowbolt Crits, Soul Fire, Death Ray, etc. There are some tricks you can use depending on your race/class but overall there's not much more to say than...Classic PVP is unbalanced af, get used to it.
---
There's no benefit to having kids.
---
And I said “I yes take candle!”, then he laughed, I laughed, it was a good time. Then he died.
---
it means aoe, it literally has cleave in the name
---
He's upset he can't top dps charts with a single spell.
---
Well I guess I didn’t say, but for one, oily blackfish is hard to consistently farm because the pools in the water are not always there. Also having several options would be nicer so I don’t have to rely on finding the pools
---
It makes me think of that picture someone made of a possible future expansion that has like 30 continents spammed all over the map. Can't seem to find it right now.
---
boomer alert
---
I'm still relatively new to WoW and very new to Classic.  What would be the benefit of a bot? Is it just grinding for someone else?
---
Can you provide proof the rules were even possible to bend? That's literally all I am asking for. If you have that proof then the situation becomes a lot more clearly in your favor. If you dont then they deserve the benefit of the doubt. Is that not a fair position for me to hold?
---
Ok...
---
If the game runs on a computer, it can be cheated by a computer.
---
Alliance have better 1-30 zones for sure. But once you get into neutral zones at level 30+ it changes. Horde have more favorable positions in Stranglethorn, Badlands, Arathi and Ashenvale. One could argue alliance has a better situation in Feralas because they have two FPs, however getting to and from Feathermoon is quite annoying and Thalanaar is basically devoid of anything meaningful. Not really sure what it’s there for in the first place.
---
Horde also get better access to dungeons at a low level. Ragefire Chasm and Wailing Caverns are firmly theirs, and RFK and RFD are certainly more horde-friendly. Despite its proximity to Alliance territories, even BFD has a Horde FP right next to it. Alliance get Deadmines and Stockades, to be fair. However Stocks doesn’t really drop loot and just has some good quest XP available. It’s slower to farm Stocks (unless spellcleave farming) than it is to just grind mobs on your own.
---
So we agree. Not BiS.
---
Look up Boomers on Google dude.... Obviously I know what an actual "baby boomer". Get off reddit or relax
---
new to classic. isn t the ship porting though ? ofc you don t notice them if you teleport from one port to an other. you just sail out wide enough to leave the magic barrier protecting the port.
---
Then 9 kobolds were trained on me by some level 5 warrior named *Broregard* who was quite lost!
---
He doesnt deserve being beat up. Unfortunately, assholes exist. And those assholes wouldnt have beat him up if he wasnt instigating them "for the lulz".
---
The way my dad would phrase it is "if it hurts when you do that, dont". So maybe this taught him a lesson.
---
ya I'm alliance and it feels like this against all races. I sorta feel like  also resist spells a lot more than I should, with zero resists. Nothing concrete though so mostly just polling to see if anyone else has this same sentiment
---
1000% agree
---
Should i post on neutral AH now or hold for p3? Theres 2 on horde AH for 500g and 750g
---
You get it
---
Ok good, now look to the right, IN the ship you can see another pile of bodies, in the area described in this convo, he was most certainly killing people right there.
---
Not that I need to, but I looked it up on Google. It means baby boomer. Thanks though, being educated by an idiot was on my scavenger hunt list tonight.
---
Also in 2004 I was a stupid 14 year old that played some games only using pistols because I thought it was cool. I think games now are easier because I’m a little less dumb.
---
I went the herbalism-alchemy route for easier leveling, but what I’m finding out is that it’s way too costly to level it up at my level, and early on you don’t get much use out of it. Like I’m 100 alchemy and I get pots like +2 hp regent every 5 seconds, whoopy!
---
Imagine not playing dwarf 😂
---
Lol all these responses and there all wrong.
---
The spell cleave name dates back to lich King 3v3 arena. It was an arena comp with 0 hard CC. Like sheep, sap, blind. Anything that would break on 1 damage.  
---
You would just dot everyone one up and just "cleave" them all down.  Hence the name spell cleave.
---
Does the tin man have a sheet metal cock?
---
Such a boss cinematic
---
But the other one that got posted was ok and totally legal, but the chinese one not?
---
Sent you dm via reddit!

The Horde doesn’t get their “gnome” race for the Alliance to grief until BC :(

Yes.  Kt was on very early blizz maps as well.

I'm a level 43 warrior looking to do some mob grinding for a level or two while watching Netflix and I was wondering if there are any level appropriate mobs with semi decent drops I could smash out for a while
---
Got mine recently as well!

Worth.

I don't think it's a bug, I just think that the party is being asked to commit. Are we all in the room or are we all out?
---
But all of the BFA players told me Classic is "just nostalgia" and everyone will quit? How could this be happening???
---
Also Kaydee, without the spying on people near you part. Just the kills
---
like myself, but not in dungeons out in the world to level. and yeah, the only other mages i saw doing this with me were chinese though there were plenty of english written guides that i used to find the spots.
---
WPVP like God intended.
---
IIRC, Northrend *was* on the old map.
---
In this [map](https://external-preview.redd.it/dSgVpe7vbdLGMGcSrVPZE82rPKKhCNpsIxB4WWwnMrI.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=4f33f645f4eaf212f3c27ce04a00ab4ba5ddf5d0) I'm pretty sure the series of small islands north of Lordaeron were supposed to be Northrend as those stayed on the map until WoTLK and then replaced by the Northrend we know today.
---
But, I'm picking on you. Not the rest of the thread. Why do you use reddit? To post shitty memes until someone recognizes it and gives you an e-highfive?
---
When you have add-ons, I agree. Using the vanilla interface makes targeting multiple people for healing a pain.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d7h7ln/-/) has been removed for Rule 7, because it was considered to be a low effort meme.

i be nothing but a common troll, mon. me thank you for understanding de commoner's aches and burdens.
---
I’ve played both sides, and generally I do prefer Alliance - but I do love Mulgore and Thunder Bluff. The Tauren definitely get the coolest starting zone in my opinion.
---
Killed 100 Bears - seemingly only 10% actually have a heart. 
---
Wolves - half of them toothless...
---
Is that Bobby Shmurda?
---
Thank you. It's annoying when groups pull too fast, but if I need the extra time, I'll plan for that towards the end of a combat encounter and type /oom so everyone knows I need a short break before the next pull. Otherwise I'll just start chugging and join in once heals are actually needed.
---
Why me
---
Cleave was originally used to describe splash damage with minimal loss of single target dps, i.e abilities such as Cleave, whirlwind, blade flurry, multishot ect.
---
Yes!  Absolute savagery.
---
It's weird, I've noticed the exact same thing as a 45 priest. But then again very few DPS seem interested in CC or targeting the same mob, so that might be the reason.
---
Not trying to be a dick here but your dps would be much higher and you would be much more effective dotting multiple targets
---
Didnt the TCG mounts then get duped in WoD?
---
Nah, every leveling priest spec goes wand spec. Also disc priests get 20% threat reduction.
---
&gt; In reality he just PvPed, but avoided NPCs getting aggroed via a bug.
---
Which is actionable by blizzard since vanilla, and here we are.
---
Ha! That’s nothing. You know where warriors keep their armies? UP THEIR SLEEVIES!
---
I'm in a guild you fucking idiot. 10 year olds aren't 60 2 weeks into the game, neither are 40 year old drunks. Imagine calling people who aren't bad at the game elitist because they don't want to spend 2 hours doing a single emp run.
---
Doesn't look like it does. Only has the icon on the character pane.
---
I SAID THAT I HAD A PARTY TO ATTEND THAT DAY!
---
I Got It!
---
Wow, it definitely seems like you solved my problem. Replacing 'Attack' with '16' for the tooltip works perfectly. And now I know there's a dev head icon in the game. Here I was going insane trying to delete it! Lol  
---
tbf due to cross-realm sharding, most retail realms have a far lower pop than classic servers.
---
It's phase 1 there's literally no honor yet.
---
This is dumb and you should feel bad.
---
Imagine being this much of a sweaty neckbeard that you care this much about how someone else is playing WoW. Fucking omegalul.
---
Hunters can use most weapons tho
---
Is the spellcleave rush meta here to stay? The community feels awkward and hostile towards players who want to play Classic without the rush. I'm starting to feel that I'm just not welcome in the game and can't make any friends.
---
it is, but if you miss it doesnt say Evade which is almost always a pathing bug
---
As someone who ganks way lower players. It's not my fault you wanted to be an ugly Horde should have rolled the right faction.
---
Yeah hunters love daggers
---
Dang I guess all those times I’ve been camped by high level horde they were just false flag alliance players....
---
The guy in the icon is still working at blizzard today
---
This video has such an old video game montage feel, I like it
---
Found the retail zoomer.
---
I feel like people shouldn't be shamed for getting help from others in an mmo.
---
Prove it though
---
To be fair, I don't think I've ever seen cleave as an ability that hits more than 2 targets (barring an 'upgraded' Cleave ability that might hit 3.)
---
Whirlwind, Flurry or Rampage are typically the terms I've heard for AE melee attacks.
---
This is not how it goes with skilled opponents bud
---
To agree with your hunch, playing with your friends is a lot more fun in my opinion. By choosing the opposite faction you will literally never get to play with them. You can always work to find a good guild and make other friends but one of my favorite things playing classic back in the day was playing with my friends. I went alliance for friends with this release even though I’ve always been horde and thoroughly enjoying it
---
Can be seen at 14:06 in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV8E_GGFrjg) when the player turns around
---
The problem with this is due to the Succubus' invisibility. I was able to resolve this by turning it off when questing. 
---
I reported the bug to Blizzard already, but haven't gotten a response back yet.
---
Guild spammers sure, but goldsellers are already breaking the rules so one would imagine they'll just put in the extra effort of either unprotecting the function or automating their spam without using the Lua API.
---
ElvUI
---
Just was reminded of those MoC bombs at the Alb gates. Good times
---
You have that confused. Dishonorable kills are only in relation to killing non-guard NPCs. 
---
You can kill low level noobs all day long. 
---
The only real incentive to not kill people lower level than you is that they don't give you any honor. 
---
Heck, losing pvp ranks from dishonorable kills isn't going to be that big of a factor for players anyway. Getting a high pvp rank isn't something you casually do. You have to spend literally weeks of non-stop pvp grinding to get high ranks in pvp.  
---
The players that are going for high rank pvp are going to be sticking to battlegrounds, not wpvp.
---
I've been AOE grouping more often since I'm a frosty boi and hit scarlet monastery. 
---
But good to know! Thanks for taking the time to explain that!
---
Any good totem addons? Preferably on the twitch app?
---
Battlegrounds are going to be cross realm.
---
All I see here is a mage upset that someone is messing up their AoE pull.
---
It's the retail mentality. As a mage, fuck those people. Let me CC in peace, people!
---
No one can really make this decision for you.
---
Are these close, personal friends? Are they likely to play the game beyond the first few months? If either of those answers is "no," maybe you should consider doing what you prefer.
---
Get a hunter to 10 or 20
---
It's just the dynamic respawns. Sometimes it seems to work overtime.
---
Lore isn't changed, it's just some various minor graphical modifications like skeletons are skinned as zombies.
---
Depictions of undead is not a problem, it's skeletons specifically.
---
Games were always more fun before YouTube guides and being able to google everything. 
---
That's what made diablo 2 so amazing. Nobody really knew the metas and just did what they wanted to do.
---
Yea good thing sharding happened. Who wants to wait in queue to wait in line to play a game.
---
Your comments are objectively wrong.  A single large heal hits for 1000+ for several hundred mana.  A group heal hits for 300 per party member for 700+ mana.  The entire concept of aggro and tanking is to maximize dps and survivability.
---
something added in phase 3. its instanced pvp
---
People have been using it in the context I've said in retail for years.
---
Even casters in pro events use the term cleave for just any aoe/mass dmg pull.
---
Its not worth it. Nor is enchanting unless you get MC/AQ enchants.
---
The real fyi post here.
---
Viable? Sure. Will you be any where close to comparable dps other rogues/mages/warriors? Not even close. Even with chugging consumables you will go oom so fast in raids without using rank 1 shocks for Elemental Devastation procs etc. As dps you are more useful as a mobile totem for melee groups. You can do it but you may not enjoy if it you wanna be doing comparable dps.
---
100%
---
As a hunter, you can use feign death to control your threat.  I recommend getting a threat meter until you get a feel for it.    
---
One of the hunter's in my guild actually pulls for me, and then feigns death.  That way i can charge the mobs to get rage, without risking aggroing a nearby pack.  If you communicate with the tank, he will appreciate this and if he's aware of the plan, can easily pick up threat if the feign fails.
---
What’s phase 3?
---
he was also a asshole
---
You must be a cool guy :D
---
As a survival hunter, my power fantasy is literally being a Green Arrow-like superhero
---
JuSt Do CoMpEtItIvE dPs AnD dOnT gImP yOuR gRoUp
---
See? It works both ways.
---
What does it mean?
---
Northrend in WC3 was pretty massive, no way those small islands could represent it.
---
Someone is jealous
---
You're a Millenial, not a Boomer.
---
i let the healer get to 20-30% as a tank so that if things go south we have the OH SHIT mana
---
I agree.
---
The only time I really want the tank / group to wait "20 seconds" is right before a boss, after I've rebuffed everyone.
---
Otherwise, going when I'm at 50% mana or around there is perfectly acceptable.
---
Largest part of no druid dps in vanilla was before the talent trees were sorted, think it was 1.8? Feral and balance specs were not worth it before 1.8.
---
Now thats class
---
If you go with your friend as a tank I always communicated that. Now he knows me after 10 Stratholme runs and our timer gets faster and faster.
---
We fill up with guild people or randoms.
---
Casters don't need ammo pouches or bags. Wands don't gain AP only spell power AFAIK
---
I'm more impressed with how you earned *thirty six* hundred experience right as Justin is talking about how Lothar killed *thirty six* orcs with his bare hands.
---
Wow.
---
But he's different, he swears! He'll be top dps ret, you'll see!
---
You mean subjectively. Objectively it's right.
---
They might sound good or their music is fun to hear. But none of them is/were able to write lyrics like mf doom or Aesop rock or sage Francis or mos def or basically everyone above the Shakespeare line.
---
It was bug back in vanilla for a little  bit but that has since been fixed. It does not work.
---
